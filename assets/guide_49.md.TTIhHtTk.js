The album, released by Virgin Records after they signed the Mighty Diamonds following a search for talent in Jamaica, is critically regarded as a reggae classic, a landmark in the roots reggae subgenre. Several of the album's socially conscious songs were hits in the band's native Jamaica, with a few becoming successful in the UK underground. Influential and sometimes unconventional, the album helped secure the success of recording studio Channel One Studios, and rhythm team Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare. Background The Mighty Diamonds were among the first artists signed to the Virgin record label after it entered the reggae music market. The Mighty Diamonds had been discovered by Jamaica's Channel One Studios, and when Virgin followed Island Records into the Jamaican marketplace, they, too, discovered The Mighty Diamonds.Bradley, 455. Virgin's representatives set up a table at a Sheraton Hotel with $100,000 and, after police intervention calmed the resultant excitement, left with such artists as the Mighty Diamonds, Prince Far I, Johnny Clarke and Big Youth on their roster. The album, the Mighty Diamonds' record debut, was recorded at Channel One Studios in Kingston, Jamaica, with production by Chinese Jamaican Joseph Hoo Kim, whose family owned the studio. 2006's Caribbean Popular Music notes that \\"[w]ith the release of ...Right Time in 1976, the studio came into its own.\\"Moskowitz, 54. Critical reception The album has been critically well received. In 1976 Rolling Stone described the album as \\"simply one of the finest reggae LPs ever released. In 1977, it called it \\"the finest stateside reggae release of last year.\\" It has come to be regarded as a reggae classic,Moskowitz, 111. a landmark in the roots reggae subgenre. The album is listed by Pop Matters among the \\"Five Reggae Albums You Cannot Live Without\\", with reviewer Sean Murphy commenting that \\"Right Time manages to combine several styles and merge them in a seamless, practically flawless whole. This, to be certain, is roots reggae, yet at times it sounds like the most accessible soul music, closer to Motown than Trenchtown.\\" Popular reception At the time of the album's release, violence within the music industry in Jamaica had led to the banning of official record charts there, but according to Rolling Stone, the Mighty Diamonds were the second-most popular band in the country after Burning Spear. A number of the songs on the album were hits in Jamaica, and several of them were big in the UK underground. The title track, a \\"roots masterpiece\\" according to Allmusic, hit big in both places, although Virgin Records lacked the foresight to release the number as a single. \\"Shame and Pride\\" was also successful in both Jamaica and the UK. Other Jamaican hits on the album include \\"I Need a Roof\\" and \\"Africa\\" Rolling Stone suggested that if charts had been permitted, \\"the Diamonds' brilliant singles, like 'Right Time' and 'Have Mercy,' would have been on top all last winter.\\" Songs The music is succinctly described in 2000's World Music: The Rough Guide as \\"[a] fine selection of sweetly harmonised vocals, militant 'rockers' rhythms and Garveyite lyrics.\\" Although the music is sometimes unconventional, the themes are typical of reggae, focusing on what critic Robert Christgau encapsulates as \\"broken bodies\\" and \\"the exultation of oppression defied.\\" The album has a strong spiritual base, with multiple references to Jah and repeated exhortations to proper behavior. Though several of the songs draw on ancient texts or historical events, they remain essentially oriented on the future. The song \\"Africa\\" is a relatively jaunty if wistful dream of repatriation that is more optimistic about the future return to Africa than mournful about the brutal separation from it. The \\"right time\\" referenced in the title track, the first song penned by the band itself, is the upcoming Apocalypse, with the band envisioning public response with lyrics that reference the Bible and the writings of Marcus Garvey. The latter song features a particularly tricky drum beat, which drummer Sly Dunbar recalled in 2001's This is Reggae Music evoked both skepticism and imitation: \\"When that tune first come out, because of that double tap on the rim nobody believe it was me on the drums, they thought it was some sort of sound effect we was using. Then when it go to number 1 and stay there, everybody started trying for that style and it soon become established.\\" Bradley, 479. According to the Independent, the entire album was \\"revolutionary\\", the breakthrough album of \\"masters of groove and propulsion\\" Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare, with \\"Sly's radical drumming matching the singers' insurrectionary lyrics blow-for-blow.\\" Garvey, Jamaica's first national hero and a recurrent referent in Rastafarian music, doesn't only feature on \\"Right Time\\", but appears on several other songs on the album, establishing what would become a persistent theme in the Mighty Diamond's work. His words are utilized in \\"I Need a Roof\\", which draws together musical themes from \\"Right Time\\" and the traditional song \\"Ol' Man River\\" in a \\"bouncy yet moody\\" prayer for basic shelter, a \\"sufferation\\" classic that was penned in response to the rampant inflation in Jamaica at the time.Bradley, 461. \\"Them Never Love Poor Marcus\\" speaks directly of Garvey, castigating those who betrayed him. Other songs focus heavily on proper modes of behavior. Track \\"Why Me Black Brother Why\\" explores black on black crime in Jamaica and warns that Jah will judge. The album's British single debut, \\"Have Mercy\\", is another religious appeal to Jah, described by 1998's Reggae Routes: The Story of Jamaican Music as \\"perhaps\\" the band's \\"best song.\\" \\"Go Seek Your Rights\\" intermingles the expected message of requiring righteous treatment with an appeal to living righteously. On a similar theme, \\"Gnashing of Teeth\\" is another Apocalyptic song that warns that the only salvation is righteous behavior. Even the relationship song \\"Shame and Pride\\" focuses on righteous living as its narrator tries to keep his girlfriend from self-destruction.

It was an action to test the fairness of clauses in loan agreements which secured a bank's commercial interest rates after a debtor that had defaulted and they had been to court to determine their repayment scheme. The House of Lords held that the clause did not fall within the ambit of reg 6(2) and that it was valid in accordance with the fairness test (reg 5(1)). The case was brought by the Director General of Fair Trading (now the Competition and Markets Authority) on behalf of consumers. Facts Condition 8 of the bank’s standard loan contract allowed the bank to get its standard interest rate after a judgment on repayment when a customer defaulted. Usually lower statutory interest rates apply under the County Court (Interest on Judgment Debts) Order 1991, but this it excluded judgment debts on consumer credit agreements under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. So the bank wanted condition 8 to get the money it would have in interest even after someone had been unable to pay. Under r 8 of the 1994 Reg’s (now r 12) the DG sought an injunction to stop the bank using the term, because it was unfair. Lord Goodhart submitted that the term merely concerned the adequacy of the bank’s remuneration, therefore fell under r 3(2) (now r 6(2)). The DG submitted it was a core term and unfair because complaints were made and the 1991 Order had excluded interest. Judgment Lord Bingham, held that it was not a core term (i.e. the adequacy of the bank’s remuneration) but ‘an ancillary provision’. [12] He said the concept of good faith under r 5(1) had an old (if hidden) English tradition, it was championed by Lord Mansfield and ‘looks to good standards of commercial morality and practice’ It is fair and open dealing, preventing unfair surprise and the absence of real choice. [17] Despite that the clause was fair. > ‘There is nothing unbalanced or detrimental to the consumer in that > obligation [to repay with interest]; the absence of such a term would > unbalance the contract to the detriment of the lender.’ The 1991 Order and the 1974 Act’s interaction, whereby interest had been excluded, did not make the term an unfair way of circumventing legislation, because the Act had not prohibited post-judgment interest being payable. Lord Steyn said, > ‘The system of pre-emptive challenges is a more effective way of preventing > the continuing use of unfair terms and changing contracting practice than ex > casu actions: see Susan Bright, ‘Winning the battle against unfair contract > terms’ (2000) 20 LS 331, 333-8.’ He added that he was initially persuaded by the idea that because the legislation had excluded interest, the court could not, but had then decided that because the legislation did not exclude expressly or by necessary implication that interest can accrue, the contract term was fair. Lord Hope, Millett and Rodger concurred. Significance Andrew BurrowsA Burrows, A Casebook on Contract (2007) 298 writes that because good faith was said to mean ‘fair and open dealing’ and ‘significant imbalance’ meant ‘substantive unfairness’, both procedural and substantive unfairness is encompassed within the meaning of regulation 5(1). He also asks whether the court should have deferred to the Director General’s view of what was unfair, recognising respective institutional competence.

He was mayor of the borough of King's Lynn in Norfolk, and for eight years a Member of Parliament (MP) for King's Lynn. Born on 18 March 1854, he was the son of the distinguished Shakespearian scholar, Clement Mansfield Ingleby (1823–1886) and his wife, Sarah Oakes (d. 3 January 1906), of whom he contributed an interesting memoir to the Dictionary of National Biography. Ingleby died 6 August 1926 at Sedgeford Hall, Norfolk, at the age of 72. From his father — originally a Birmingham man who settled near Ilford, in Essex — Holcombe Ingleby inherited everything except the ill health which interfered so much with the elder Ingleby's work; he had wealth for instance, some antiquarian tastes, much musical knowledge, and a fine voice. He went up to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and took honours in History. After entering at Inner Temple, he changed his mind and was admitted a solicitor, practising for several years in London. The title of his firm was Ingleby and Royds, which afterwards became Royds, Rawstorne, and Co. His marriage in 1886 to Harriett Jane Neville Rolfe, daughter of C. F. Neville Rolfe, of Heacham Hall, took him to Norfolk and King's Lynn. There he passed most of the remaining years of his life throwing himself into the affairs of the ancient borough. One of his most lasting legacies is the Royal West Norfolk Golf Club, opened in 1892, whose course he laid out. He became Mayor of King's Lynn in 1909, and again from 1919 to 1922. He had desired that office, partly because he was fond of the place and people and a born administrator, but also for the sentimental reason that his wife's ancestors had held it 200 years before. In 1919 and 1923 he edited the Red Register of King's Lynn, described in The Times as \\"a collection of records of no little importance for students of social life and organization in England during the 14th and 15th centuries.\\" At the December 1910 general election he stood as Conservative candidate for the borough, and defeated the former member, the energetic and independent Thomas Gibson Bowles by a majority of 97. What followed caused some scandal and much amusement. Three humble voters confessedly backed by more powerful people, lodged an election petition against the new member on the ground that he and his agents had been guilty of bribery and corruption. The case was tried at King's Lynn before Mr Justice Ridley and Mr Justice Channell, and the hearing lasted several days, reports being eagerly read all over the country. Ingleby had undoubtedly been the most lavish of entertainers. At his house, Sedgeford Hall, a few miles away, he had habitually received vast parties of guests, providing them with \\"pageants and carnivals,\\" not to speak of refreshments, the attendance numbering 7,000 in 1905 and 3,000 in 1909. At that time he was not a Parliamentary candidate, but something of the kind went on after he became one, while presents of game were abundant. In giving evidence, the Liberal agent declared that rabbits had been scattered among the voters; he confessed that he himself had accepted a couple of wild duck. In the end, the Judges decided that the festivals and gifts had not been corruptly provided, and Ingleby was declared duly elected, and held the seat till 1918. It was not only in Norfolk, where he was High Sheriff in 1923, that Ingleby was popular.

Career L'Orange moved to Germany and studied engineering at the Technical University of Berlin in Charlottenburg, Berlin. After his studies he worked for Gasmotoren-Fabrik Deutz AG as a research engineer from 1904, and from 1906 as research director. In October 1908, L'Orange moved from Deutz to Benz & Cie. in Mannheim, where he became head of Stationary Engine Construction. From 1912, on he was also a member of the Board of Directors. In 1909, while working at Benz, he patented a precombustion chamber (DRP 230517, 14 March 1909) which made possible compact, lightweight diesel engines. L'Orange was director of the Motoren Werke Mannheim AG (MWM) from 1922, which was formed that year when Carl Benz split up the engine division of his company. Precombustion chamber The precombustion chamber patented in 1909 by L'Orange connects to the engine cylinder via a restricted passage, or burner. In operation, a narrow cone of fuel is sprayed down towards the burner by the single orifice injector nozzle. At this time the technology did not exist to manufacture nozzles with multiple orifices and diesels used high pressure air to spray the fuel directly into the cylinder. L'Orange also discovered that indirect injection diesel engines ran more smoothly and quietly than direct injection engines. Use of a precombustion chamber also reduced stress on the engine's structure, so that it could be made less heavy than a direct injection engine. However, indirect injection engines require higher compression ratios, about 20:1, to compensate for the greater surface to volume ratio causing more heat loss from the cylinder charge. They are also more difficult to start when cold, therefore the precombustion chambers are fitted with electrically heated glowplugs. Legacy In September 1933, L'Orange's son Rudolf (1902–1958) founded Gebrüder L'Orange Motorzubehör GmbH, whose modern-day successor is L'Orange GmbH. The company's shares were bought from the L'Orange family in 1979 by ITT Automotive, and it was later bought by MTU München in 1985, and MTU Friedrichshafen in 1995, until finally becoming a member of the Tognum group in 2006. Rolls-Royce Holdings and Daimler AG launched a takeover for Tognum in March 2011.[5] The two companies announced on 24 June 2011 that their joint €3.4 billion tender offer had been successful, with 94% of Tognum shareholders accepting.[6] Once the acquisition was complete, Tognum is run as a 50-50 joint venture, with Rolls-Royce merging its Bergen Marine diesel engines unit into the operation. The company is still prominent in injection technology for large four-stroke-cycle engines. Besides diesel direct injection, it also supplies gasoline direct injection systems. The fuel injection systems of the Daimler-Benz DB 605 aircraft engine (as used in the Messerschmitt Bf 109 WW2 fighter and manufactured postwar under licence by Svenska Flygmotor) were equipped with L'Orange fuel injectors fed by a Bosch injection pump.

While many were destroyed during the First and Second World Wars, there are some that survive today.  Uniqueness as an artistic and architectural form  Jedwabne synagogue The wooden synagogue was \\"an original architectural genre\\" that drew on several models, including Poland's wooden building traditions and central plan, masonry synagogues in which four massive masonry pillars that define the Bimah rise to support the roof vaulting.Zimiles, Murray, et al. Gilded Lions and Jeweled Horses: the synagogue to the carousel. University Press of New England, 2007, p. 5 Central pillars support the vaulting of only a handful of wooden synagogues. Instead, in wooden synagogues the vaulting and domes are suspended by elaborate roof trusses. Common features shared by wooden synagogues include the independence of the pitched roof from the design of the interior domed ceiling. The outside of a wooden synagogue gave no hint of the domes and multiple, Baroque vaults that would be found within. The exteriors were decidedly plain, giving no hint of the riot of carving, painting, domes, balconies and vaulting inside. The architectural interest of the exterior lay in the large scale of the buildings, the multiple, horizontal lines of the tiered roofs, and the carved corbels that supported them. The elaborate domed and vaulted ceilings were known as raki'a (Hebrew for sky or firmament) and were often painted blue sprinkled with stars. The Bimah was always placed in the center of the room. Wooden synagogues featured a single, large hall. In contrast to contemporary churches, there was no apse. Moreover, while contemporary churches featured imposing vestibules, the entry porches of the wooden synagogues was a low annex, usually with a simple lean-to roof. In these synagogues, the emphasis was on constructing a single, large, high-domed worship space.Piechotka, Maria & Kazimierz Heaven's Gate: wooden synagogues in the territory of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Warsaw: Institute of Art, Polish Academy of Sciences, 2004 According to art historian Stephen S. Kayser, the wooden synagogues of Poland with their painted and carved interiors were \\"a truly original and organic manifestation of artistic expression—the only real Jewish folk art in history\\".Alfred \\"Wooden Synagogues\\", Commentary, July 1960 Wooden synagogue in Jurbarkas According to Louis Lozowick, writing in 1947, the wooden synagogues were unique because, unlike all previous synagogues, they were not built in the architectural style of their region and era, but in a newly evolved and uniquely Jewish style, making them \\"a truly original folk expression\\", whose \\"originality does not lie alone in the exterior architecture, it lies equally in the beautiful and intricate wood carving of the interior\\".Cited in Mark Godfrey, Abstraction and the Holocaust, Yale University Press, 2007, p. 92 Moreover, while in many parts of the world Jews were proscribed from entering the building trades and even from practicing the decorative arts of painting and woodcarving, the wooden synagogues were actually built by Jewish craftsmen.Godfrey, Mark Abstraction and the Holocaust. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2007, p. 92 Other research points to certain synagogues being made by Christian master builders. For example, the early history of the Gwoździec Synagogue is unknown and portions of the structure date back to 1650. The original structure was built in a regional style exhibiting both Jewish and Polish vernacular architecture. In the 18th century there was a dramatic reconfiguration of the prayer hall ceiling. It is believed to be the first cupola of its kind. The timber framers are unknown but presumed to be Christian master builders since until the 19th century Jews were excluded from the trade. The liturgical paintings were made by Jewish artists. Isaac, son of Rabbi Judah Leib ha Cohen and Israel, son of Rabbi Mordecai, have inscribed their names on the paintings in the western ceiling. The interior vaulting of the Wolpa Synagogue is described by art historians Maria and Kazimierz Piechotka as having been \\"the most magnificent of all known wooden ceilings\\" in Europe.Piechotka, Heaven's Gate 2004, p. 64 Of course, since Christians were free to build with brick and stone, few European buildings of the scale of the Wolpa synagogue were ever built in wood. The walls of the main hall were 7.2 meters high. The vaulting, under a three- tiered roof, rose to a height of fourteen meters in three tiers marked by fancy balustrades. Each tier was made up of several curving sections faced in wooden paneling to form a graceful, tiered and vaulted dome. The vaulted ceiling was supported by the four wooden corner columns that rose form the bimah, and by trusses in the roof.Piechotka, Heaven’s Gate 2004, pp. 362-69 Art historian Ori Z. Soltes points out that the wooden synagogues, unusual for that period in being large, identifiably Jewish buildings not hidden in courtyards or behind walls, were built not only during a Jewish \\"intellectual golden age\\" but in a time and place where \\"the local Jewish population was equal to or even greater than the Christian population\\".Soltes, Ori Z. Our Sacred Signs: How Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Art Draw from the Same Source. Boulder: Westview Press, 2005, p. 180  History  German soldiers observe burning wooden synagogue in Lithuania during World War II. According to Maria and Kazimierz Piechotka, the wooden synagogue style developed in the century between the mid-sixteenth and mid-seventeenth centuries, a period of peace and prosperity for the Polish-Lithuanian Jewish community. In addition to Poland and Lithuania, wooden synagogues are found in modern Belarus and Ukraine. Wood was abundant and inexpensive in the heavily forested commonwealth, but a large part of the motivation for building in wood rather than masonry was the great difficulty of obtaining government permission to erect masonry synagogues.Wischnitzer, 1964, p. 127 The wooden synagogues, which featured multi-layered high roofs, multi-beamed domes, galleries, wooden balconies and arches were built to high standards of craftsmanship.  Interior decoration  The interiors were decorated with wall and ceiling paintings that, in many cases, covered the walls and ceilings entirely, and with elaborately carved wooden Torah arks. Thomas Hubka has traced the style of decorative painting in the wooden synagogues to the medieval Hebrew illuminated manuscripts of Ashkenazi Jewry.Hubka, Thomas C. \\"Medieval Themes in the Wall-Paintings of 17th and 18th-Century Polish Wooden Synagogues\\", in Imagining the Self, Imagining the Other, edited By Eva Frojmovic, Leiden: Brill, 2002; p. 213 ff. The intricate wooden decoration of the barrel vaulted ceiling of the Przedbórz Synagogue was considered so beautiful that before the Second World War it drew tourists to the small village of Przedbórz.Mason, Margie \\"Berkeley Congregation Plans to Re-Create 17th Century Temple\\", Los Angeles Times, January 26, 2002  Regional variations  Architectural historian Rachel Wischnitzer has traced regional variations in wooden synagogue style. The interiors of the wooden synagogues of Lithuania were not as exuberantly painted as were synagogues of other regions. Instead, Lithuanian synagogues were notable for architectural details such as ceilings with the boards laid in decorative herringbone patterns. Several Lithuanian synagogues featured corner pavilions. The wooden synagogues of Galicia were notable for their elaborate wall paintings.

Samuel was born in Irwin, Ohio, to Samuel Colver and Rachel (Curry) Colver.Rogue Digger  Biography  Early in life he studied law at Plymouth College in Indiana. Afterward, he served as a Texas Ranger and served with General Sam Houston at the Battle of San Jacinto, and later served as an Indian scout. = Career = In 1850, he and his brother Hiram moved their families to Oregon via the Oregon Trail, beginning their migration from St. Joseph, Buchanan, Missouri. Samuel and Hiram founded the small community of Phoenix, initially called Gasburg, settling on donation land claims. Samuel constructed a home in Phoenix in 1855-1856. During Colver's life, in addition to a residence, \\"Colver Hall\\" served as a school, a dance hall, a public meeting place, and a refuge during the Rogue River Indian Wars, though it is doubtful if the house ever actually was under attack. The Samuel and Huldah Colver House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. When it was destroyed by fire in September 2008, it was one of the oldest residences in Jackson County.Fire Destroys Colver house The remaining three walls of the house were razed after the fire and the property was removed from the National Register in April 2009. Colver served as a U.S. Marshal. He was instrumental in the founding of the Republican Party in Oregon, supporting Lincoln, and occasionally wrote poetry that was published in several Oregon newspapers. Samuel Colver was married to Huldah Callender on December 5, 1843, in Logan County, Ohio. Huldah was born near Mechanicsburg, Ohio on January 1, 1823. Samuel and Huldah were the parents of two children, Lewellyn, born March 28, 1847, in Irwin, Union County, Ohio, and Isabelle, who was born in a covered wagon on February 7, 1850, near St. Joseph, Buchanan County, Missouri. Lewellyn was killed on March 9, 1884, by a neighbor who shot him after mistakenly believing he was a burglar.Archives WestJefferson Public Radio Samuel's daughter Isabelle died of diphtheria on April 12, 1885, in Phoenix, Jackson County, Oregon. Grief-stricken over the loss of both of his children, Samuel Colver was confined for a month to the Oregon State Insane Asylum in Salem. A third child is suspected to have been born to Samuel and Huldah, named Alice Colver, but she died in infancy in Ohio. Samuel died somewhat mysteriously in February 1891. He was found drowned near Upper Klamath Lake after riding out alone. He was known to have some enemies and there was rumor of land swindles, but nothing was ever proven. Samuel Colver has been very often confused with Samuel Henry Culver in numerous articles concerning the life of Samuel Colver. Both Samuels were residing in Southern Oregon during the early 1850s. The result has been that articles regularly attribute Samuel Colver as serving as an Indian Agent in Southern Oregon when it was actually Samuel Henry Culver who served as Indian Agent in Southern Oregon.

Planned for construction during the 2010s, the project was definitely cancelled by its contractors in November 2017. The total expected installed power was 2,750 MW, generating an average per year, which corresponds to 21% of Central Interconnected System's (SIC) demand by 2020. A 3,000 high-voltage direct current line would have been built between Aysén and the capital Santiago to feed the SIC, including a submarine portion between Chaitén and Puerto Montt. The projected cost was estimated at 3.2 billion U.S. dollars (1.5 trillion Chilean pesos), and would have employed 5,000 workers frome Chile and abroad, making it the largest energy project in the country's history. HidroAysén is owned by a corporation which is a joint venture between Endesa (a subsidiary of Italian conglomerate ENEL), with a 51% stake and by Colbún S.A. which owns the other 49%.  History  The dams were approved on May 9, 2011 under the government of President Sebastián Piñera. The decision was made by eleven counselors on a committee. Ten voted in favor, with one abstention. Twenty-seven days earlier the Foreign Investment Committee was already aware of the decision ahead of time. The transmission line is yet to be approved. If completed these companies would own 80% of the Chilean energy market together establishing a duopoly. The project was placed on hold in early June 2012 due to protests. In June 2014, the project was rejected by the government of Chile, due to calls from environmentalists.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-27788286 Protests A protest against HidroAysen in Barcelona, Spain. The banner reads \\"No HydroAysén, dam free Patagonia\\" the opposition's slogan. The lack of transparency in the decision making process was widely criticized by the Chilean public; In fact it elicited nationwide street protests. The main detractors hope to initiate legal actions against the project, and have assured that the public demonstrations will be massive. The planning process has also been harshly criticized by environmentalists and the local population of the Aysén del General Carlos Ibáñez del Campo Region. According to opinion polls in April 2011, the project was opposed by 61% of the population despite a massive public relations campaign in support of it. Later that same month upon government approval of the project opposition climbed to 74%. The project is opposed by Greenpeace Chile with the slogan \\"¡Paren el circo, No a hidroaysén!\\" (Stop the circus, no Hidroaysén!) and \\"¡Salva la Patagonia!\\" (Save the Patagonia!).¡PAREN EL CIRCO!

Furthermore, 19% of young people 18 to 34 years old and 34% of older people over age 55 approved of the project. However, 72% of respondents believed the project would become reality.  Environmental impact  The project was estimated to flood of natural reserves. Based on study of the project construction and access roads would have impacted 6 national parks, 11 national reserves, 26 conservation priority sites, 16 wetland areas and 32 privately owned protected conservation areas. This is in addition to six Mapuche communities including four in Toltén and one Lautaro and Victoria.

He was also called Kawakubo Nobuzane because he was raised in Kawakubo village. After the death of his older brother Matsuo Nobukore in 1571, Shingen ordered Nobuzane’s son Nobutoshi to be the successor to the Matsuo family and Nobutoshi was married to Nobukore’s daughter. In 1575 at the Battle of Nagashino, Nobuzane did not participate in the battle proper between Takeda Katsuyori and the Oda-Tokugawa Alliance. Instead Nobuzane was deployed on Mt. Tobigasu to maintain the siege on Tokugawa's forces in Nagashino Castle, assuring they did not escape and link up with the main Oda-Tokugawa army. But he was ambushed by troops under the command of the alliance’s generals Sakai Tadatsugu and Kanamori Nagachika. Early on the morning of June 29, Nobuzane’s men were ambushed by Sakai’s men upon the ridge. Nobuzane resisted the attack in the main fortress on Mt. Tobigasu while dispatching Saegusa Masasada to defend the four outlying forts. However Nobuzane lacked enough troops to properly defend the five-fort complex, and his troops were stretched too thinly to be effective against the attack. Sakai Tadatsugu's troops were successful in setting the forts on fire and Takeda Nobuzane was killed in the hand-to-hand fighting that followed as his fort was overrun. It is said that those dedicated to Nobuzane created a small hill called Hyougotsuka after his courtesy title of Hyougo-no-suke on Mt.

The screenplay was an adaptation by Morton S. Fine and David Friedkin from the novel of the same name by Edward Lewis Wallant. The film was the first produced entirely in the United States to deal with the Holocaust from the viewpoint of a survivor. It earned international acclaim for Steiger, launching his career as an A-list actor. It was among the first American films to feature a confirmed homosexual character, nudity during the Production Code, and was the first film featuring bare breasts to receive Production Code approval. Although it was publicly announced to be a special exception, the controversy proved to be first of similar major challenges to the Code that ultimately led to its abrogation. In 2008, The Pawnbroker was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot With the rise of Adolf Hitler, Sol Nazerman, a German-Jewish university professor, is dragged to a concentration camp along with his family. He witnesses his two children die, one while riding the cattle car on the way to the camp, and his wife raped by Nazi officers. 25 years later, Nazerman operates a pawnshop in East Harlem while living in an anonymous Long Island housing tract. Numbed by his experiences, he has worked hard not to show any emotions. Nazerman describes himself as \\"beyond bitter\\" and alienated, viewing the people around him as \\"rejects and scum.\\" He acts disinterested and cynical towards his desperate customers as he drives prices down on their pawned goods. Nazerman is idolized by Jesus Ortiz, a young Puerto Rican who works for Nazerman as his shop assistant. He refers to Nazerman as his \\"teacher\\" but his attempts at friendship are rebuffed. After hours, Nazerman teaches Ortiz about precious metal appraisal and the true value of money. Nazerman is pursued by Marilyn Birchfield, a neighborhood social worker who wants to get to know him better but he consistently keeps her at arm's length. Nazerman learns that Rodriguez, a racketeer who uses the pawnshop as a front, makes his money largely through owning multiple prostitution houses. Nazerman recalls his wife's degradation and wants no part of it. This results in a clash with Rodriguez, who threatens to kill Nazerman. Meanwhile, Ortiz spitefully arranges for the pawnshop to be robbed by a neighborhood gang led by Tangee after Nazerman says that Ortiz means nothing to him. During the robbery, Nazerman refuses to hand over his money. A gun is pulled and the ensuing scuffle results in Ortiz taking the bullet intended for Nazerman. Tangee's gang flees as Ortiz drags himself out onto the street. Nazerman stumbles out of his shop and holds Ortiz as he dies in his arms.

Pollock – Bertha * Raymond St. Jacques – Tangee * Morgan Freeman – Man on Street (uncredited) Major themes The Pawnbroker tells the story of a man whose spiritual \\"death\\" in the concentration camps causes him to bury himself in the most dismal location that he can find: a slum in upper Manhattan. Lumet told The New York Times in an interview during the filming that, \\"The irony of the film is that he finds more life here than anywhere. It's outside Harlem, in housing projects, office buildings, even the Long Island suburbs, everywhere we show on the screen—that everything is conformist, sterile, dead.\\" The film used flashbacks to reveal Nazerman's backstory. According to a review on the Turner Classic Movies website, it has some similarities to two films of Alain Resnais: Night and Fog (1955) and Hiroshima mon Amour (1959). A recent commentator observed that the film \\"is uniquely American, with its harsh, unforgiving depiction of New York City, all of it brought to vivid life by Boris Kaufman's black and white cinematography and a dynamic cast highlighted by Rod Steiger's searing portrayal of the title role.\\" New York Times critic Bosley Crowther wrote that Sol Nazerman \\"is very much a person of today—a survivor of Nazi persecution who has become detached and remote in the modern world—he casts, as it were, the somber shadow of the legendary, ageless Wandering Jew. That is the mythical Judean who taunted Jesus on the way to Calvary and was condemned to roam the world a lonely outcast until Jesus should come again.\\" Production notesDevelopment= The film initially was considered for production in London, in order to take advantage of financial incentives then available for filmmakers. Directors Stanley Kubrick, Karel Reisz and Franco Zeffirelli turned down the project. Kubrick said he thought Steiger was not \\"all that exciting.\\" Reisz, whose parents were murdered in the Holocaust, said that for \\"deep, personal\\" reasons he \\"could not objectively associate himself with any subject which has a background of concentration camps.\\" Zeffirelli, then a stage director, was anxious to direct a film, but said that The Pawnbroker was \\"not the kind of subject [he] would wish to direct, certainly not as his first Anglo-American venture.\\" =Casting= Steiger became involved in the project in 1962, a year after the Wallant novel was published, and was involved in an early reworking of the film's script. He received $50,000 for his performance, far lower than his usual rate, because he trusted Lumet, with whom he had worked on television in the series You Are There. Lumet, who took over the film after Arthur Hiller was fired, initially had misgivings about Steiger being cast in the lead role. He felt that Steiger \\"was a rather tasteless actor—awfully talented, but completely tasteless in his choices.\\" Lumet preferred James Mason for the role, and the comedian Groucho Marx was among the performers who had wanted to play Nazerman. However, Steiger pleasantly surprised Lumet when he agreed with him during rehearsals on the repression of the character's feelings. Lumet felt that ultimately Steiger \\"worked out fine.\\" In a 1999 television interview, Rod Steiger revealed an inspiration he took from an unlikely source of art. Over a quarter of a century after artist Pablo Picasso's 1937 Guernica, the painting inspired emotional artistic depth again when, in 1964, Steiger borrowed the silent anguish of the skyward cry of the suffering female subject, seen at the right of the canvas. The scene in the film was in the last minutes of The Pawnbroker. Variety considered Brock Peters the first actor to portray a confirmed homosexual character in an American film. =Filming= The film was shot in New York City, mainly on location and with minimal sets, in the fall of 1963. Much of the filming took place on Park Avenue in Harlem, where the pawnbroker shop was set at 1642 Park Avenue, near the intersection of Park Ave. and 116th Street. Scenes were also filmed in Connecticut, Jericho, New York, and Lincoln Center (with both interior and exterior shots of the Lincoln Towers apartments which were new at the time). =Post-production and release= The film premiered in June 1964 at the Berlin International Film Festival, and was released in the United States in April 1965. Finding a major U.S. distributor for the film proved difficult because of its nudity and grim subject matter. Producer Ely Landau had the same problem in England until it was booked into a London theater where it had an enormously successful run. As a result, Landau arranged a distribution deal with the Rank Organisation, and it opened in the U.S. Thelma Oliver and Jaime Sánchez meet with hoodlums at a night club Quincy Jones composed the soundtrack for the film, including \\"Soul Bossa Nova\\", which was used in a scene at a nightclub. That would later be used as the main theme to the Austin Powers film series. The film was edited by Ralph Rosenblum, and is extensively discussed in his book When the Shooting Stops, the Cutting Begins: A Film Editor's Story. Production Code controversy The film was controversial on initial release for depicting nude scenes in which actresses Linda Geiser and Thelma Oliver fully exposed their breasts. The scene with Oliver, who played a prostitute, was intercut with a flashback to the concentration camp, in which Nazerman is forced to see his wife (Geiser) forced into prostitution. The nudity resulted in a \\"C\\" (condemned) rating from the Catholic Legion of Decency. The Legion felt \\"that a condemnation is necessary in order to put a very definite halt to the effort by producers to introduce nudity into American films.\\" The Legion of Decency's stance was opposed by some Catholic groups, and the National Council of Churches gave the film an award for best picture of the year. The scenes resulted in conflict with the Motion Picture Association of America, which administered the Motion Picture Production Code. The Association initially rejected the scenes showing bare breasts and a sex scene between Sanchez and Oliver, which it described as \\"unacceptably sex suggestive and lustful.\\" Despite the rejection, Landau arranged for Allied Artists to release the film without the Production Code seal, and New York censors licensed The Pawnbroker without the cuts demanded by Code administrators. On a 6-3 vote, the Motion Picture Association of America granted the film an \\"exception\\" conditional on \\"reduction in the length of the scenes which the Production Code Administration found unapprovable.\\" The exception to the code was granted as a \\"special and unique case,\\" and was described by The New York Times at the time as \\"an unprecedented move that will not, however, set a precedent.\\" The requested reductions of nudity were minimal, and the outcome was viewed in the media as a victory for the film's producers. Some Jewish groups urged a boycott of the film, in the view that its presentation of a Jewish pawnbroker encouraged anti-Semitism. Black groups felt it encouraged racial stereotypes of the inner city residents as pimps, prostitutes or drug addicts. Critical reaction The film, and Steiger's performance in particular, was greeted by widespread critical acclaim. Life magazine praised Steiger's \\"endless versatility.\\" Brendan Gill wrote in The New Yorker: \\"By a magic more mysterious. . . than his always clever makeup, he manages to convince me at once that he is whoever he pretends to be.\\" New York Times critic Bosley Crowther called it a \\"remarkable picture\\" that was \\"a dark and haunting drama of a man who has reasonably eschewed a role of involvement and compassion in a brutal and bitter world and has found his life barren and rootless as a consequence. It is further a drama of discovery of the need of man to try to do something for his fellow human sufferers in the troubled world of today.\\" He praised the performances in the film, including the supporting cast. One negative review came from Pauline Kael, who called it \\"trite\\", but said: \\"You can see the big pushes for powerful effects, yet it isn't negligible. It wrenches audiences, making them fear that they, too, could become like this man. And when events strip off his armor, he doesn't discover a new, warm humanity, he discovers sharper suffering—just what his armor had protected him from. Most of the intensity comes from Steiger's performance.\\" Legacy The film has become known as the first major American film that even tried to recreate the horrors of the camps of the Jewish Holocaust. A New York Times review of a 2005 documentary on Hollywood's treatment of the Holocaust, Imaginary Witness, said that scenes of the camps in the film as shown in the documentary were \\"surprisingly mild.\\" It has been described as \\"the first stubbornly 'Jewish' film about the Holocaust\\", and as the foundation for the miniseries Holocaust (1978) and Schindler's List (1993). Rod Steiger called The Pawnbroker his favorite film, \\"by a long shot,\\" in his last television interview on a 2002 episode of Dinner for Five, hosted by actor/director Jon Favreau. Its display of nudity, despite Production Code prohibitions on the practice at the time, is also viewed as a landmark in motion pictures. The Pawnbroker was the first film featuring bare breasts to receive Production Code approval. In his 2008 study of films during that era, Pictures at a Revolution, author Mark Harris wrote that the MPAA's action was \\"the first of a series of injuries to the Production Code that would prove fatal within three years.\\" The Code was abolished, in favor of a voluntary ratings system, in 1968. Awards Steiger received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor – Drama, the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the 14th Berlin International Film Festival, an Oscar nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and received the British Film Academy BAFTA award for best foreign actor in a leading role.

She was the first wife of Stephen III, Duke of Bavaria, and the mother of the French queen Isabeau of Bavaria. Early life Bernabò Visconti and Beatrice Regina della Scala, the parents of Taddea Visconti Born in Milan in 1351, sometime after 27 June, Taddea was the eldest child of Bernabò Visconti, Lord of Milan, and Beatrice Regina della Scala (1331–18 June 1384). She had fourteen younger siblings, but she was her parents' favorite child. Her paternal grandparents were Stefano Visconti, Lord of Milan, and Valentina Doria, and her maternal grandparents were Mastino II della Scala and Taddea da Carrara. Taddea's father Bernabò, continually at war with the papacy (for which he was excommunicated), was a ruthless despot, who would, in 1385, be overthrown by his nephew and son-in-law Gian Galeazzo Visconti and later poisoned in the castle of Trezzo. Marriage Bavaria was the wealthiest and most powerful of the German states at the time. Bernabò managed to secure the marriages of four of his children to members of the ruling Wittelsbach family. Taddea, being the eldest, was the first of the four Visconti children selected. In 1367, Taddea became the first wife of Stephen III of Bavaria- Ingolstadt, who, on 13 May 1375, became Duke of Bavaria. He ruled jointly with his brothers, Frederick (who married Taddea's younger sister Maddalena) and John II, in Bavaria-Landshut. Taddea brought a dowry of 100,000 gold ducats. Her husband Stephen (who was 14 years older than her) is described by writer Barbara Tuchman as \\"reckless, prodigal, ostentatious, amorous, restless without a tournament or war and well-suited to a Visconti daughter\\". The marriage produced three children: * Louis VII, Duke of Bavaria (c. 1368–2 May 1447), married firstly Anne de Bourbon, by whom he had issue, and secondly, Catherine d'Alençon. He had several illegitimate children by various mistresses. * Isabeau of Bavaria, (early 1370–24 September 1435), Queen consort of King Charles VI of France, whom she married on 17 July 1385. * unnamed son (born and died in 1377) Adjustment to life in Bavaria proved a difficult challenge for Taddea, prompting her, in later years, to take extended journeys abroad. The climate of Munich did not prove healthy for her, and she developed a persistent cough and recurring fever. After Stephen III became duke, Taddea was required to attend more state functions, her health notwithstanding. In the 1370s, she began to pay long visits to her homeland, usually bringing her husband and children with her, and stopping at Milan to visit her family. She visited Rome in 1378. Death and legacy After a trip to Milan in December 1380, Taddea fell seriously ill. By the time she returned to Bavaria, she was suffering from fever, coughing and weight loss. Her health continued to fail and she died on 28 September 1381 in Munich at the age of 30. She was buried in Unsere Liebe Frau. When news of her death reached Milan, her devastated father ordered his subjects to wear mourning clothes. Less than four years later, her daughter, Isabeau, became Queen of France. Taddea's husband Stephen married secondly, on 16 January 1401, Elisabeth of Cleves, daughter of Count Adolf III of Cleves. This second marriage was childless.

A private rail line built by volunteers connects NYMT with the Rochester & Genesee Valley Railroad Museum, over a distance of two miles. This demonstration railway allows both museums to offer train rides with their collections of vintage railroad equipment. NYMT operates the only electric trolley ride in New York State, not to be confused with the similarly named Trolley Museum of New York located in Kingston, New York. History The last streetcars operated in Rochester in 1941, leaving only the Rochester Subway rapid transit operation to soldier on until 1956. Rochester Transit Corporation donated car 1246, a Peter Witt-style streetcar, to the Rochester Museum and Science Center in 1941, but the museum never made any attempt to incorporate the car into a permanent exhibition. Stored outdoors and ravaged by vandals, the car was finally sold for scrap in 1950. Rochester Subway car 60 was donated to the Rochester Chapter, NRHS in 1956, but having no permanent location, the car was loaned to other organizations outside the region. The roots of the New York Museum of Transportation can be traced back to the Mageee Transportation Museum, a private museum located near Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, founded by wealthy industrialist Harry Magee, the owner of the Magee Carpet Company. His interest in vintage vehicles of all kinds led him to create a home for antique automobiles and trolleys in the mid-1960s. The museum and trolley rides flourished until the summer of 1972 when flooding caused by Hurricane Agnes caused extensive damage to the tracks and trolley fleet. Harry Magee died that October, and the collection was sold at auction in 1973. The planned community of Riverton was being developed in West Henrietta, New York by Henry Hamlin and William Morris. The cornerstone of this new project was a proposed light rail line that was to connect Riverton with downtown Rochester constructed along the former Erie Railroad Rochester Division right of way. A small trolley museum was envisioned as a natural outgrowth of the planned light rail line. With the knowledge that several Rochester area streetcars were preserved at the Magee Transportation Museum, Hamlin and Morris made a visit to see what could be salvaged from the shuttered museum. The former station for the Rochester and Eastern Rapid Railway near Canandaigua located on the museum's front lawn Before his untimely death, Harry Magee had expressed hope that the Rochester streetcars in his collection could one day be returned to New York State to be restored and operate once again. The first car acquired was former Elmira, Wavery and Corning Railway car 107, as well as a stock of bracket arms and other stock to construct overhead wire. New York State Railways Rochester and Eastern Rapid Railway car 157 was also acquired in the same deal. Lease of a recently abandoned dairy barn on state agricultural lands in West Henrietta was acquired by Hamlin to house the two cars. Temporary tracks were laid and car 157 was placed inside the barn on October 5, 1973, with car 107 following a month later. Rochester Transit Corporation sand car 0243 and Rochester City and Brighton Railroad horse car 55 were brought to the barn site, on loan from the Rochester Museum and Science Center. A provision charter was issued in 1975, bringing formal organization to the New York Museum of Transportation. By 1975, the city of Rochester was looking to abandon the remaining western end of the old Rochester Subway, which was still being used for freight service by both Penn Central and the Baltimore & Ohio railroads under contract. The NYMT volunteers were given permission to salvage as much of the track materials as they could for the construction of the rail line circling their campus in West Henrietta. Addition historic vehicles were added to the collection from various sources, and a gift shop, exhibit hall, and gallery were completed inside the old dairy barn. SEPTA was retiring its fleet of wood-bodied street snow sweepers they inherited from the old Philadelphia Transportation Company, and NYMT acquired C-130 in January 1975. Designed to run on Philadelphia's five-foot \\"broad gauge\\" tracks, NYMT volunteers worked to convert the trucks to standard gauge. Nearly all restoration work had been completed on this project, but the car has been stored out of service since the 1980s. Construction of the museum's demonstration railroad began in 1976, totaling nearly three-quarters of a mile by 1979. By 1980, NYMT began offering rides on Fairmont \\"track cars\\" (small gas-powered vehicles once used by railway maintenance workers for transport to work sites) on the partially completed museum railroad. Around the same time, the neighboring Rochester and Genesee Valley Railroad Museum began constructing their own demonstration railroad from their Industry depot north towards NYMT, and both operations were connected in 1993. Following the joining of the NYMT and RGVRRM tracks with a golden spike ceremony, end-to-end track car operations began. Trolley era In 1996, the body of former Northern Texas Traction Company no. 409 was acquired from the Spaghetti Warehouse restaurant when it closed earlier that year. It was moved inside the dairy barn in 1997, and opened to the public for viewing. Retaining the tables installed during its restaurant years, it is a popular destination for birthday parties. The body of New York State Railways - Rochester Lines no. 437 was acquired from a camp at Lamoka Lake in 1997. It was placed on trucks in 2003 and moved into the main barn in 2006 for evaluation and possible restoration. The museum was able to acquire two operational former Philadelphia and Western Railroad steel interurban trolley cars from the Koekuk Junction Railway in 1996. Originally built for the Philadelphia and Western Railroad in the 1920s, cars 161 and 168 served Philadelphia's Norristown High Speed Line until retired by SEPTA in 1990. While they have no historical connection to the Rochester area, they do allow the museum to accomplish its goal of offering regular trolley rides to visitors. In 2002, proper standard gauge Baldwin interurban trucks had been acquired from Japan and placed under Car 157, an important step towards its restoration and potential future operation on the museum railroad. Despite having two operating trolleys in relatively good condition, the NYMT had nowhere to run them. Throughout the later half of the 1990s, volunteers from the NYMT and RGVRRM worked together to set poles and string overhead trolley contact wire along the museum railroad. Upon completion of the first quarter- mile of electrification in 2001, NYMT operated the first trolley rides for the public in the Rochester area since 1956. Following the successful weekend test runs, volunteers worked to extend the electrification nearly a full mile to the newly established Midway station in 2006. RGVRRM members designed and constructed a substation to allow regular trolley operation using power purchased and stepped down from National Grid. Regular trolley operations followed, with visitors transferring to track cars or diesel trains for the continuation to the Rochester & Genesee Valley Railroad Museum and Industry Depot. The Pennsylvania Trolley Museum offered NYMT the body of former PTC snow sweeper C-125, which had since been converted to use as an overhead line maintenance car. The body arrived at NYMT in May 2009, and suitable standard gauge trucks were later located and placed under the body. This car is currently stored out of service. In 2014, NYMT acquired former NJ Transit PPC no. 7, which had run in the Newark City Subway from 1954 until retirement in 2001. Part of a fleet originally acquired by Twin Cities Rapid Transit in 1947 and sold to New Jersey in 1954 when the Minneapolis system was converted to bus operation. The car has no historic connection to the Rochester area, but it is an important example of modern, streamlined technology employed by trolley systems across the country in the 1930s and 1940s. Currently stored out of service pending an evaluation by volunteers, restoration to operation is a future goal. An overall future goal in conjunction with RGVRRM is to fully restore Rochester Subway car 60 to full working operation and run it on the line. An awareness and fundraising campaign for car 60 began in June 2014. They hope to achieve this goal by the Car's 100 birthday in 2016.http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2014/06/29/restoration- awaits-car-citys-old-subway/11725033/ Museum operation The museum is open every Sunday all year round, from 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Trolley rides are offered from May through October only, with either car 161 or 168. All trolleys operate from NYMT to Midway station, where visitors make the transfer to track cars or diesel trains to complete the journey and tour the Rochester and Genesee Valley Railroad Museum. The distance from the NYMT loading area to the bumping block at Industry depot is a little less than two miles in total. Together, the two organizations are the only operating railroad museums in New York State.

He was an associate of English Colonizer Sir Ferdinando Gorges in a colonization scheme for a part of Maine. Early life He was born in Somerset, the son of Elijah Cameron Popham (elder brother of Sir John Popham, Lord Chief Justice) by his wife Joan Norton. George Popham's grandparents lived in St. Donat's Castle and his grandmother, Jane Stradling, was born there.Commoners (vol II, Popham of Littlecote) with some support/input from Visitation (Somerset, 1623, Popham) Very little is known about his early years, where it appears he may have been a humble merchant. Another George Popham traveled to New Guiana with Robert Dudley. Through pedigree rolls by nephew Edward Popham and a last will by George Popham, we know some history of the relationships between the Pophams which confirmed that Sir John was George's uncle and Edward Popham's great-uncle. Voyage to New England Just before the voyage to New England, George was the Customer of Bridgwater Port in Somerset. The Customer was the chief customs officer in the port, who collected the customs dues and recorded all entries and exits. In 1607, he sailed from Plymouth with two ships and about 120 people and landed in August at the mouth of the Kennebec River. George Popham was the captain of Gift of God which became separated from the ship Mary and John on the journey to New England. The two ships were able to rejoin along the coastline before looking for a place to build a colony. There, he erected the first English settlement in New England, Popham Colony. His first establishments included a storehouse and a historical fortification called St. Georges Fort Presidential election and return to England Popham eventually won the elections as President of the new colony but died the following year. The colonists were disheartened by the harshness of the climate and returned in the springtime to England.

The Battle of the Wilderness On May 4, 1864, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's 122,000-man Army of the Potomac and Gen. Robert E. Lee's 66,000-man Army of Northern Virginia opened the Battle of the Wilderness as a meeting engagement. This battle, fought primarily on May 5 and 6, proved costly to both sides, as well as being essentially a draw. As he believed his position untenable (since he had not successfully interposed his army between Grant and Richmond), Lee believed Grant would continue his move towards Richmond. Lee therefore moved to block Grant by shifting the Army of Northern Virginia southward towards Spotsylvania Court House, a crucial junction in the most direct routes from Grant's position in the Wilderness to Richmond. The battle Lee assigned the job of slowing down the Union columns and protecting the Confederates' route to Gen. Jeb Stuart, his trusted cavalry commander. Grant's orders to his cavalry chief, Gen. Philip H. Sheridan, were to cut the route the Confederates would take to Spotsylvania and to take and hold the crossroads. On May 7, the two opposing cavalries met at Todd's Tavern at 4:00pm. They engaged in a slashing cavalry battle until after dark. The Confederate cavalry retired after nightfall. The battle resumed the next morning. It was an obstinate struggle with heavy losses on both sides. The Confederates were slowly pushed back upon Spotsylvania. They were just about to have to abandon the crossroads when the first of Lee's infantry arrived, across a bridge Sheridan had ordered his cavalry to destroy. The infantry secured the area for the Confederacy. Aftermath Declaring the battle victorious for either side is problematic. While Stuart's cavalry was tactically defeated, Sheridan failed to cut the Confederate route to Spotsylvania, resulting in the bloody battle that ensued there. Yet, the delay caused by Sheridan's cavalry prevented Lee from gaining the advantages that an unhindered march to Spotsylvania would have garnered. The net effect was the continued and eventually fatal bleeding of the Army of Northern Virginia, at the cost of yet more Union casualties ... which could be replaced with fresh Northern recruits. Thus, on the balance, the result was very slightly better than a draw for the Union forces. Today, there is information about the battle in the area provided by the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park.

Mac Eoin, 'The Date and Authorship of Saltair na Rann', Zeitschrift Für Celtische Philologie, 28 (1961), 51-67; . The number of the cantos imitates the number of psalms in the Bible.Brian Murdoch, 'An Early Irish Adam and Eve: Saltair na Rann and the Traditions of the Fall', Mediaeval Studies, 35 (1973), 146–177 (p. 178); . Together they narrate the sacred history of the world, from its creation down to the last days of humanity. In the principal manuscript, Rawlinson B 502 (Bodleian, Oxford), it is followed by two poems of devotion and ten ‘Songs of the Resurrection’, which were added in the late tenth century. Authorship In the second devotional poem, Poem 152, the author identifies himself as Óengus Céile Dé: is me Oengus céle Dé (line 8009). Whitley Stokes took this to mean that the work as a whole was ascribed to the famous Óengus mac Óengobann, monk of Tallaght and author of the Félire Óengusso (Martyrology of Óengus), who since the 17th century also happens to have been nicknamed Céile Dé (Culdee). However, since the ascription occurs in appended material and therefore outside the core of Saltair na Rann, it is possible that it refers to the one or two devotional poems, which were either attributed to the earlier Óengus or composed by a late tenth-century namesake.Follett, Céli Dé in Ireland. 162.

In 2009, the administration reported there were zero incidents of bullying in the district. The Spring Grove School Board prohibits bullying by District students and faculty. The board policy 249 (Adopted December 2008) defines bullying and cyberbullying. The Board directs that complaints of bullying shall be investigated promptly, and corrective action shall be taken when allegations are verified. No reprisals or retaliation shall occur as a result of good faith reports of bullying. The board expects staff members to be responsible to maintain an educational environment free from all forms of bullying. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti- bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Special education In December 2010, the district administration reported that 496 pupils or 12% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. Of the identified students, 52% had specific learning disabilities. In 2009, the district administration reported that 521 pupils or 13% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. Among them 9% had mental retardation. The District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. When a child experiences difficulty within the classroom, screening information will be gathered by a team located within the child's school to determine his or her specific needs. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible make a written request for a multidisciplinary evaluation to the building principal. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. Spring Grove Area School District received a $2,036,126 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011-12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 149 or 3.86% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days’ public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 In 2011, the average teacher salary in Spring Grove Area School District was $55,568 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers received was $14,486 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $70,054.

Pennsylvania public school district reserve funds are divided into two categories – designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. By law the state limits the total unreserved-undesignated fund balance at 8% of the annual budget for school districts that have budgets over $19 million a year.

Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state's Department of Education. The base index for the 2011–2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. The following exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.

In 2010, within York County school districts, the highest amount went to York City School District set at $495 per approved homestead. The property tax relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least 10 contiguous acres and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. Pennsylvania awarded the highest property tax relief to residents of the Chester-Upland School District in Delaware County at $641 per homestead and farmstead in 2010. CUSD was given $632 in 2009. This was the second year they were the top recipient. *2009 – $127 to 7,872 approved homestead owners. *2008 – $136 to 7,364 homesteads. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently individuals who have income substantially greater than $35,000, may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%). Extracurriculars The district's students have access to a wide variety of clubs, activities and an extensive costly sports program. Eligibility for participation is determined by the school board policy and in compliance with standards set by the Pennsylvania interscholastic Athletics Association (PIAA). The District does not charge an activity fee to students regardless of how costly the program or sport is to run. Spring Grove School District spent $68,480 for the transportation of sports teams in 2011-12. Countywide nearly $1 million was spent on transporting public school sports teams.Vanolinda, Dick., York County schools struggle to control sports travel costs, York Dispatch, December 12, 2012 The total extracurricular budget for the District in 2007-08 was $711,420 and grew to $969,482 in 2010-11. Collectively, York County public schools spent over $9 million on sports budgets (does not include facility costs) in 2011-12.Dick VanOlinda,, Pay-to- play a growing trend in area school districts, The York Dispatch, May 23, 2012 Extracurricular activities available at Spring Grove include academics, such as Science Olympiad, Team America Rocketry Challenge, Student Launch Initiative, Envirothon, Vex Robotics, and Physics Olympics, and clubs, such as Key Club, GSA, Hacky Sack Club, Academic Booster club, Art Club, Book Club, Debate Club, Drama Club, Film Club, FBLA, Future Educators Club, History Club, Journalism, Link Crew, National Honor Society, Peer Mentoring, Physics Club, Power of One Club, Psychology Club, Project Harmony, Recycling Club, Rocket Scientists, SADD, Student Council, Ski Club, Spanish Club, Tech Squad, Tri-M Music Honor Society, Ultimate Frisbee, Yearbook, and York County Science and Engineering Fair. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. =Sports= The District funds: Co-ed: * Indoor Colorguard - KIDA * Indoor Percussion - KIDA ;Boys: *Baseball - AAAA *Basketball- AAAA *Cross Country - AAA *Football - AAA *Golf - AAA *Lacrosse - AAAA *Soccer - AAA *Swimming and Diving - AAA *Tennis - AAA *Track and Field - AAA *Volleyball - AAA *Wrestling - AAA ;Girls: *Basketball - AAAA *Cheer - AAAA *Cross Country - AAA *Field Hockey - AAA *Golf - AAA *Lacrosse - AAAA *Soccer (Fall) - AAA *Softball - AAAA *Swimming and Diving - AAA *Girls' Tennis - AAA *Track and Field - AAA *Volleyball - AAA ;Junior High School Sports: ;Boys: *Basketball *Cross Country *Football *Track and Field *Wrestling ;Girls: *Basketball *Cross Country *Field Hockey *Track and Field *Volleyball According to PIAA directory July 2012 Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletics Association, PIAA School Directory, 2012 References Category:School districts in York County, Pennsylvania ","title":"Spring Grove Area School District"},{"id":"20745696","text":"Chicks in Chainmail is an anthology of fantasy stories, edited by Esther Friesner, with a cover by Larry Elmore.

William Scott Ament and other missionaries collecting indemnities from Chinese people in the aftermath of the Boxer Uprising. Origins of the Controversy In 1900, attacks took place across China in connection with the Boxer Rebellion which targeted Christians and foreigners. Many missionaries with their children, as well as native Christians were killed and much property was destroyed. While most missionaries, including those of the largest affected mission agency, the China Inland Mission led by Hudson Taylor, refused to even accept payment for loss of property or life \\"in order to demonstrate the meekness of Christ to the Chinese\\" when the allied nations were demanding compensation from the Chinese government, not all missionaries acted with similar restraint. In 1901 veteran American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions missionary Rev. Dr. William Scott Ament, who had served in China since 1877, became embroiled in a controversy regarding his activities (and those of other Christian missionaries, including Pierre-Marie-Alphonse Favier, Roman Catholic Vicar Apostolic of North Chihli) subsequent to the Boxer Uprising. \\"In the war's aftermath came a war of words. Missionary triumphalism clashed with the sarcastic sallies of Mark Twain, who lampooned the apologias for looting given by American missionary William Scott Ament.\\"Bickers & Tiedemann, Boxers, xv. =Ament's attitude and actions= While Ament through his own personal initiative was able to rescue the ABCFM missionaries at Tungchow, there was still significant loss of lives. Thirteen ABCFM adult missionaries and five children were killed by the Boxers. Included were Miss Mary Susan Morrill (born 1863 in Portland, Maine) and Miss Annie Allender Gould, were among the eleven foreign missionaries, four children, and about fifty Chinese Christians killed in Baoding from 30 June 1900.Paul Hattaway, China's Christian Martyrs (Oxford, UK and Grand Rapids, MI: Monarch, 2007):196–210 Additionally, there was much damage to ABCFM property. The ABCFM Mission compound was razed, as was the Emily Ament Memorial School (named in honour of Ament's daughter) on Sixth Street, Peking.Luella Miner, China's Book of Martyrs: A Record of Heroic Martyrdoms and Marvelous Deliverances of Chinese Christians During the Summer of 1900, (Jennings and Pye, 1903): 240.Robert Hart; John King Fairbank; Katherine Frost Bruner; Elizabeth MacLeod Matheson; and James Duncan Campbell, The I. G. in Peking: Letters of Robert Hart, Chinese Maritime Customs, 1868–1907 (Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1975): 879. Ament estimated that by the end of July 1900 that losses for the ABCFM Peking station was about $71,000 gold.Porter, 189. Occupation of the Mongolian Fu On 11 August 1900, Ament indicated in a letter to his wife, that: :\\"Mr. Conger told me to-day that on the arrival of the troops he would see that we – our mission – had given over to us that Mongol Fu – palace – just east of us on Teng Shih K'ou....Our poor people – those who are saved – not many, must be settled in homes and efforts made to secure indemnity for them as well as for ourselves. My heart bleeds for them. They are aliens in their own country and pronounced as \\"bandits\\" by imperial decree.\\"William Scott Ament, Letter to Mary P. Ament, quoted in Porter, 191–192. Ament was able to occupy the Mongolian Fu, a suspected Boxer headquarters adjacent to the ABCFM chapel, by 20 August 1900.Porter, 197. Ament was able to write to his wife: :\\"I have here about two hundred Christian refugees, poor worn persecuted ones whom I am feeding on food taken from the rich families near by. They ought to suffer in view of all the misery they have created....Our poor people come in with their tales of woe which would break a heart of stone. Many have been killed and I shall act as avenger if I can meet the brutes in human form. No one thinks that mercy should be shown them.\\"W.S. Ament to Mary Ament, 20 August 1900, quoted in Porter, 197. Demand for indemnities On 20 August 1900, Ament with nineteen other American Protestant missionaries sent a note to United States Minister, Edwin H. Conger, demanding :\\"indemnity for native Christians for loss of life and property, education reforms in China, abolition of the literacy test of merit in the civil service and the introduction of suitable branches of Western learning, abolition of the worship of Confucius as a compulsory rite, and reforms of criminal civil processes so that non- Christians and alike Christians had the same rights in court etc.\\"Wong, 29. These demands were transmitted to John Hay (8 October 1838; 1 July 1905), United States Secretary of State (1898–1905), with only the demands for indemnities and the abolition of the examination system ultimately included in the Boxer Protocol. According to Wong, :\\"Ament explained that to demand China entering upon a course of reform at the direction and practically under the direction of foreign powers would certainly be most irritating and militate ultimately against the constantly essential doctrine of preserving the integrity of the empire. China must be left to work out her own salvation by her own method.\\"Wong, 30–31. On 25 August 1900, Ament revealed his plans to punish the Boxers for their actions: :\\"The city is stagnant and only very slowly are people coming out of hiding. I shall soon begin some punitive measures on Boxers. China seems a ruined country. We may all have to leave. Our people from the country and the region of Shantung come with horrible stories of Boxer cruelties. Our churches are simply wiped out. Only a small remnant will remain. We must reconstruct as best we can. We find buried silver in good quantities and plenty of grain, so that our people have plenty to eat and to wear.\\"W.S. Ament to M.P. Ament, 25 August 1900, quoted in Porter 198. Again, Ament indicated: :\\"Boxer leaders must be sought out and punished so far as possible. I shall begin in that line soon. It would not be right for such men to remain unpunished.\\"Porter, 199. Collection of indemnities From 13 September 1900, Ament, and an assistant, Reverend Elwood Gardner Tewksbury (born 1865, West Newbury, Massachusetts),William H. Brackney, \\"Elwood Gardner Tewksbury\\", Biographical Dictionary of Chinese Christianity, http://www.bdcconline.net/en/stories/t/tewksbury-elwood-gardner.php accompanied by the U.S. 6th Cavalry, searched the areas adjacent to Beijing for Boxers, collecting indemnities for Christians who had been killed by the Boxers, and ordering the burning of some homes and even allegedly executing suspected Boxers. Ament had been chosen by his fellow missionaries \\"as the one who would be honorable and just to all.\\"Martha Emily Parmelee Rose, The Western Reserve of Ohio and Some of Its Pioneers, Places and Women's Clubs, National American Woman Suffrage Association Collection (Library of Congress) (Euclid Print. Co., 1914): 133. Ament reported to Mary, his wife, on 18 September 1900: :\\"I have been absent on an expedition for five days....Captain Forsythe and two hundred cavalry troops went – I as guide and interpreter – to Sha Ho and other places east of Peking. We burned two Boxer headquarters, destroyed some arms and brought in sixteen refugees, Christians who had been in hiding.\\"W.S. Ament to M.P. Ament, 18 September 1900, in Porter, 207. On 1 January 1901, Ament, writing to his wife, confided: :\\"I led a troop of horsemen through San Ho District, and because I wanted certain Boxers hunted out and punished I was spoken of as vindictive and bloodthirsty. Now it comes out that this expedition has to be repeated, because of the softness of the Americans in dealing with the Chinese!\\"W.S. Ament to M.P. Ament, 1 January 1901; quoted in Porter, 219. Ament is quoted as advocating the necessity of the use of force to ensure genuine regret among the Chinese: :\\"If you deal with the Chinese with a soft hand, they will take advantage of it.\\"Cited in S.C. Miller, \\"Ends and Means: Missionary Justification of Force in Nineteenth Century China,\\" in The Missionary Enterprise, 276. In a letter to ABCFM corresponding secretary Dr. Judson Smith of 13 November 1900 (received by Smith on 7 January 1901), Ament says: > I have been in Cho Chou. This time I proposed to settle affairs without the > aid of soldiers or legations. It was a complete success. Every one of our > dispossessed church-members has been reinstated and a money compensation > made for his losses. This has been done by appealing to the sense of justice > among the villages where our people lived and where they are respected by > all decent people. The villagers were extremely grateful because I brought > no foreign soldiers and were glad to settle on the terms proposed. After our > conditions were known many villagers came of their own accord and brought > their money with them.W.S. Ament to Judson Smith, 13 November 1900; quoted > in Porter, 233. Apparently, the actions of Russian, French and German soldiers, \\"who looted and killed on every hand, often taking delight in shooting every person visible... determined Dr. Ament not to go again with soldiers in his efforts to secure the replacing of the Christian in their homes, or to enforce the reasonable demands for indemnity for the great losses sustained by the church- members.\\"Porter, 226. Ament wrote in a letter on 27 September 1900, about a month after the occupation of the Mongol Fu (palace): \\"I am selling off the bric-a-brac, silks, furs found in the Fu for the benefit of the Christians.\\"William Scott Ament, Letter (27 September 1900); quoted in Porter, 241–242. Ament, writing to Rev. Dr. Judson Smith on 27 December 1900, before he became aware of any criticism, gives this account of the collection of indemnities: > After a month of very hard work, I am glad to report progress to you. I > visited – beginning on the south – Wen An, Pao Ting Hsien, Pa Chou, P'ing > Ting, Cho Chou, Liang Hsiang, and on the east, Shun Yi. I found the > officials in all these places exceedingly friendly and anxious to settle the > affairs of the converts, recognizing the right and the need of such claims. > I have made no use of foreign soldiers and brought no external pressure to > bear, relying on the justice of our claims. Mr. Conger has supported us in > the measures and methods taken, though the military people have not failed > to make criticisms. The survivors in all our country stations have been > recouped for all their losses, again reinstated in their villages, with some > money in hand, and a promise of houses restored next spring. Over and above > restoration for the converts there has been gathered a fund for the support > of widows and orphans, who have no homes and have no one to look after > them.\\"W.S. Ament to Judson Smith, 27 December 1900, quoted in Porter, 230. Criticisms of Ament and his actionsWilbur Chamberlin and New York Sun article (24 December 1900)= An interview that Wilbur Chamberlin of the New York Sun conducted with Ament elevated the indulgences issue into a cause célèbre. Chamberlin had first met Ament in Beijing on 14 October 1900. In a letter to his wife, Chamberlin indicated: > The Rev. A.[ment] is a missionary, and he appears to be a very good sort of > a fellow, but I cannot for the life of me approve of his methods....You see, > when the soldiers came to Peking and these missionaries were safe, some of > them began at once to clamor for damages that they said they had sustained. > The first thing that they did was to get for living places the palaces of > the rich Chinese Princes, and when they had them they started in clearing > them out. They took everything of value and sold it for a song. Then they > let their native Christians go out hunting and stealing more loot, and then > they sold that. They said it was no sin and eased their consciences by > saying they had the right to reimburse themselves for the losses they > sustained. It was just as if a man had stolen something from me, and, to get > square, I went and stole something from him. In other words, two wrongs make > a right. That may be all right, but I don't think so. At A.'s home, which > was the palace of Prince Pei, a Manchu, before the trouble, I met a lot more > missionaries.\\"Chamberlin, Ordered, 97–98. While Chamberlin thought it unlikely that the Sun publish his reports about the looting by missionaries and their followers, he felt that should they be printed that he would be :\\"roundly damned by a big proportion of ...the class that support the missionaries, some of whom out here have disgraced the Church and Christianity....It had been my intention to write nothing at all about them unless I was ordered to do so....It is sufficient to say that their conduct to-day is not improved in the least. They are still living in stolen houses and paying their expenses from the proceeds of the sale of their thefts. Some of them are still selling stuff that they individually stole or was stolen by their so-called Christians under their personal direction.\\"Chamberlin, letter to his wife, 11 December 1900, in Chamberlin, Ordered, 190. Chamberlin's report was subsequently published in the Christmas Eve 1900 edition of New York's The Sun newspaper.Robert A. Bickers and R. G. Tiedemann, The Boxers, China, and the World (Rowman & Littlefield, 2007): 104). , . Chamberlin reported: > The Rev. Mr. Ament, of the American Board of Foreign Missions, has returned > from a trip which he made for the purpose of collecting indemnities for > damages done by Boxers. Everywhere he went he compelled the Chinese to pay. > He says that all his native Christians are now provided for. He had 700 of > them under his charge, and 300 were killed. He has collected 300 taels for > each of these murders, and has compelled full payment for all the property > belonging to Christians that was destroyed. He also assessed fines amounting > to THIRTEEN TIMES the amount of the indemnity. This money will be used for > the propagation of the Gospel. > Mr. Ament declares that the compensation he has collected is moderate, when > compared with the amount secured by the Catholics, who demand, in addition > to money, head for head. They collect 500 taels for each murder of a > Catholic. In the Wenchiu country, 680 Catholics were killed, and for this > the European Catholics here demand 750,000 strings of cash and 680 heads. > In the course of a conversation, Mr. Ament referred to the attitude of the > missionaries toward the Chinese. He said: \\"'I deny emphatically that the > missionaries are vindictive, that they generally looted, or that they have > done anything since the siege that the circumstances did not demand. I > criticise the Americans. The soft hand of the Americans is not as good as > the mailed fist of the Germans. If you deal with the Chinese with a soft > hand they will take advantage of it.' > \\"The statement that the French Government will return the loot taken by the > French soldiers, is the source of the greatest amusement here. The French > soldiers were more systematic looters than the Germans, and it is a fact > that to-day Catholic Christians, carrying French flags and armed with modern > guns, are looting villages in the Province of Chili.\\"The New York Sun (24 > December 1900), quoted by Mark Twain, \\"The Person Sitting in Darkness\\", The > North American Review 172 (February 1901). Chamberlin indicated in a letter to his wife dated 28 December 1900, that he had interviewed Ament that day about missionary looting, and that Ament believed he had done nothing for which he was ashamed. Chamberlin confided to his wife that :\\"He is the boss American missionary out here. He really is a fine man, and during the siege one of the bravest....It was what happened after the siege was over, when the looting began, that I find fault with. At least, I don't find fault with it, but it seems to me that it needs explanation.\\"Chamberlin, Ordered, 212–213. In a subsequent letter to his wife, dated 29 January 1901, Chamberlin indicates that :\\"A.[ment] tries to justify himself by saying that everyone did it, which doesn't seem to me to be a good defense at all. It is too much in the two-wrongs-make-a-right plan to suit your humble servant.\\"Chamberlin, Ordered, 241. =Mark Twain: “To the Person Sitting in Darkness” (February 1901)= Mark Twain was \\"an outspoken critic of American involvement in the Philippines and China\\",Maverick Marvin Harris, \\"China\\", 142, in The Mark Twain Encyclopedia. and \\"one of the mammoth figures in anti-imperialism, and certainly the foremost anti-imperialist literary figure\\" of his days, having become in January 1901 a vice president of the Anti-Imperialist League of New York.Everett H. Emerson, Mark Twain: A Literary Life (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2000):257. Twain decided to use the Sun article as the basis of a sustained attack on both the missionary enterprise and its imperialist tendencies. \\"Twain lampooned missionary morality and likened it to questionable American activities in the Philippines\\".Bickers & Tiedemann, Boxers, 104. According to Foner, Twain used the conduct of Ament to \\"drive home the point that the missionary movement served as a front for imperialism.Philip Sheldon Foner, Mark Twain: Social Critic (International Publishers, 1958): 280. \\"Without any doubt 'To the Person Sitting in Darkness' is Twain's most famous anti-imperialist piece. The satire is incredibly dark and Twain does not hesitate to taunt those whom he considers to be immoral including McKinley as the \\"Master of the Game,\\" the missionaries, and the trusts.\\"Literature and Anti-Imperialism The title of the article is \\"an ironic reference to Matthew 4:16 — \\"The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light\\"\\", \\"and used by the Christian missionaries when referring to the “savage,” “heathen,” “uncivilized” populations of the lands the imperialists were conquering.\\"R. Titta, \\"Mark Twain and the Onset of the Imperialist Period\\" The Internationalist (September–October 1997). http://www.internationalist.org/marktwain3.html It was also a reaction to the intervention philosophy of British writer Rudyard Kipling's pro-imperialistic February 1899 poem, \\"The White Man's Burden\\". The title was \\"a play upon the idea of western civilization being \\"enlightened\\"\\". Kipling had used the image when he wrote of: :The cry of those ye humor :(Ah, slowly!) toward the light:-- : 'Why brought ye us from bondage, :Our loved Egyptian night?' In this article, Twain especially targeted Ament. According to Susan Harris: > “To the Person Sitting in Darkness,” which Mark Twain published in the North > American Review in 1901, attacks Western imperialism as it was manifesting > itself in South Africa, China, Cuba, and the Philippines. It names its > villains – William McKinley, Joseph Chamberlain, the Kaiser, the Czar – and > their instruments, especially the Reverend William Ament, a > Congregationalist minister who was affiliated with the American Board of > Commissioners for Foreign Missions.Harris. According to Twain biographer Albert Bigelow Paine, \\"Twain, of course, was fiercely stirred. The missionary idea had seldom appealed to him, and coupled with this business of bloodshed, it was less attractive than usual. He printed the clippings in full, one following the other; then he said: > By happy luck we get all these glad tidings on Christmas Eve—just the time > to enable us to celebrate the day with proper gaiety and enthusiasm. Our > spirits soar and we find we can even make jokes; taels I win, heads you > lose. \\"He went on to score Ament, to compare the missionary policy in China to that of the Pawnee Indians, and to propose for him a monument— subscriptions to be sent to the American Board. He denounced the national policies in Africa, China, and the Philippines, and showed by the reports and by the private letters of soldiers home, how cruel and barbarous and fiendish had been the warfare made by those whose avowed purpose was to carry the blessed light of civilization and Gospel “to the benighted native”—how in very truth these priceless blessings had been handed on the point of a bayonet to the “Person Sitting in Darkness.” Mark Twain never wrote anything more scorching, more penetrating in its sarcasm, more fearful in its revelation of injustice and hypocrisy, than his article “To the Person Sitting in Darkness.” He put aquafortis on all the raw places, and when it was finished he himself doubted the wisdom of printing it.Albert Bigelow Paine, Mark Twain: A Biography, Chapter 214 James Smylie somewhat whitewashes the controversy, saying, \\"Twain went after the respected Congregationalist minister, Reverend William Scott Ament, director of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Ament joined other powers in seeking indemnities from the Chinese after the Boxer Rebellion against western exploitation in 1900. Twain, perhaps unfairly, was shocked that Ament would use such blood money for the \\"propagation of the Gospel\\" and to promote the \\"blessings of civilization\\" to brothers and sisters who \\"sit in darkness.\\" He summoned to missionaries: Come home and Christianize Christians in the states!\\"Smylie, page 10. Reactions to the Controversy After its publication in The North American Review for February 1901, as the opening article, there was a huge controversy. This article \\"created a national sensation as well as a savage debate between Twain and the American Board of Foreign Missions; it is a masterful and satiric polemic condemning imperialism and the West for military intervention in China, South Africa, and the Philippines.\\"J.C.B. Kinch, \\"Europe and Elsewhere\\", The Mark Twain Encyclopedia, 261. According to Paine, > Every paper in England and America commented on it editorially, with bitter > denunciations or with eager praise, according to their lights and > convictions. At 14 West Tenth Street [Twain's residence] letters, newspaper > clippings, documents poured in by the bushel—laudations, vituperations, > denunciations, vindications; no such tumult ever occurred in a peaceful > literary home. It was really as if he had thrown a great missile into the > human hive, one-half of which regarded it as a ball of honey and the > remainder as a cobblestone. Whatever other effect it may have had, it left > no thinking person unawakened. After its magazine publication, the Anti-Imperialist League of New York published the essay as a pamphlet and seems to have distributed as many as 125,000 copies. However, \\"Even within the Anti-Imperialist League, reaction to Mark Twain’s essay was mixed. Though the League reprinted it as a pamphlet (it had the widest circulation of any League publication) League censors excised significant passages, included the author’s quotation from the New York Sun on the prevailing squalor in the slums of Manhattan’s Lower East Side, as well as his bitter condemnation of the activities of Christian missionaries in China.\\"R. Titta, \\"Mark Twain and the Onset of the Imperialist Period\\". http://www.internationalist.org/marktwain3.html =Critics of Ament=The New York Times On 26 January 1901, the editor of The New York Times, in an editorial entitled \\"Loot and Indemnity in China\\", after describing the \\"various unprovoked and unpunished acts of murder, arson, robbery and rape\\" by the Allied forces, attacked the missionaries in China as \\"the most vociferous plauditors of the operations, the most implacable demanders of Chinese blood\\" and indicated that \\"the accounts that have reached us have represented the missionaries as having been as active in the looting of Chinese property as they had been in instigating the promiscuous taking of Chinese lives.\\"\\"Loot and Indemnity in China\\", The New York Times (26 January 1901):8; https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1901/01/26/102429033.pdf Ament was arrested by German and French troops near Tungchow, and charged with trying to extort money from the Chinese villagers.J.A, Mitchell, Life (1901): 154. On 5 February 1901, The New York Times reported that Ament had been arrested (along with two British subjects) on a charge of \\"endeavoring to extort money from the Chinese villagers\\" near Tungchow (now the Tongzhou District, Beijing). While the two British subjects were released, Ament was held pending an appeal to United States Minister Edwin H. Conger.\\"A Missionary Arrested\\", The New York Times (5 February 1900):5 Two days later, The Times reported that Ament \\"had been arrested by French and German officers on the painful charge of blackmailing Chinese villages....The charge has terrible plausibility. Apparently the only relevant answer the inculpated missionary could make to the charge is the ancient rejoinder \\"You're another,\\" which the other doubtless was. But what a predicament for a missionary to be placed in with reference to avowed looters.\\"\\"Our Missionaries in China\\", New York Times (7 February 1901):8 The New York Times, in an editorial of 7 February 1901, echoed the previous criticisms of Ament: \\"The plain fact is that the ministers of the gospel of CHRIST have been a disturbing factor in the Chinese situation.\\" Quoting the opinion of then British Prime Minister, Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, who indicated that \\"missionaries in general have been an international nuisance\\", The Times indicated that \\"the missionaries in China were showing a vindictiveness, in respect to the outrages and the situation which did not exactly comport with the Gospel they professed to be spreading.\\" The Times concludes: \\"Upon the whole, it seems safe to say, that the Rev, Mr. Ament has missed his vocation, and that, for the particular function which incumbed on him, of propagating the Christian Gospel in foreign parts, he was not the most eligible person that could have been imagined or even secured.\\" Ament was subsequently released at the direction of the German military commander, Count Alfred von Waldersee.\\"Mr. Ament Still in Custody: But a Dispatch to London Says Count von Waldersee Has Ordered His Release.\\" New York Times (6 February 1901):6.Porter, 221. Wilbur Chamberlin, a reporter for the New York Sun, sent to China, reported in a letter dated 9 February 1901 to his wife: > My missionary friend, the Rev. A.[ment], is out of limbo....Quite a long > time ago he had a scheme for collecting damages for all his native > Christians and his church from the Chinese themselves.

Chamberlin indicated that the French and Germans, under pressure from the Americans, released him, insisting that he was never under arrest. On 31 March 1901, the New York Times reported that the collection of \\"private indemnities\\" by Ament and others in China might disqualify them from any claim for payments when the United States government tendered its indemnity claims on China. It further indicated that the United States government could not make any claims for Chinese Christians as they were not American citizens, and that \\"Dr. Ament's recent complaint that the powers would do nothing in the way of collecting indemnity for these Christian Chinamen has not tended to raise the estimate of missionary intelligence among diplomats here [Washington D.C.]\\".\\"Missionaries' Indemnities\\", New York Times (31 March 1901) Thomas F.

Mitchell, Life 37 (1901): 184. Charles Fletcher Lummis, editor of The Land of Sunshine, agreed with Twain's assessment of the situation: \\"Dr. Ament, American missionary to China, who extorted from innocent paupers a manifold retribution in blood and money for the sins of the Boxers.\\"Charles Fletcher Lummis, The Land of Sunshine 14 (F.A. Pattee, 1901): 237. In the Eighth series of Ethical Addresses (1901), after referring to \\"Ament and his pious frauds', Ament's motivations are explored: \\"It is because the Rev. Mr. Ament loved his church and her temporal possessions more than ...ethical principles....It is because men love their churches more than righteousness that iniquities done in the name of the church are condoned.\\"Frederic Harrison, \\"The Religion of Duty\\", Ethical Addresses, Volume 8. American Ethical Union. (S. Burns Weston, 1901):92–93.

American Ethical Union. (S. Burns Weston, 1901):35. The Socialist Party of America supported Twain's attack on Ament and the other missionaries in an editorial in the 29 April 1901 edition of the Daily People by Daniel DeLeon: > When, however, Twain ... mercilessly exposed the vandalism of the > missionaries in China, when he showed that they had looted the palaces and > despoiled the temples, and then sold their booty; he was pounced upon by the > whole clergymanic body.

Instead of thirteen times the indemnity it should have read “one and a third times” the indemnity. Further, Smith defended Ament, declaring that Ament had suffered in the Boxer Rebellion and that Twain's “brilliant article would produce an effect quite beyond the reach of plain argument,” and that it would do an innocent man an injustice. Smith demanded an apology from Twain.The Mark Twain Encyclopedia, 23. Replying in a letter to the New York Tribune, Twain insisted that Ament had arraigned himself. Gilbert Reid Rev.

Boston Journal Ament was not just defended by his colleagues or other Christian organisations. An editorial in the Boston Journal, entitled \\"A Humorist Astray\\", defends Ament: > Mark Twain had better stick to his last. He is a capital humorist but when > he poses as a publicist he gets into trouble straightway. His article in the > North American Review is not good humor, and is very bad politics. Some of > it, moreover, seems to be recklessly and even libellously untrue.... Mr. > Ament, against whom Mark aims the hasty shafts of his ridicule and > denunciation, is one of the heroic men of peace who distinguished themselves > in the defense of the British Legation. He has been a leader in the great > and urgent work of relieving the necessities of the native Christians of the > northern provinces, or of those who escaped the Boxer sword. In pursuance of > this work, he has secured money contributions from the villages where the > native Christians suffered. It does not appear that Mr. Ament has used any > force to accomplish this. It does not appear that he has secured any more > money than was essential to feed and clothe his native wards, and to re- > establish them in dwellings. This is a work of Christian charity, defensible > on the most elementary grounds of justice.

Henry Stimson Prominent New York lawyer, and future United States Secretary of State, Henry Stimson, responding to a New York Times editorial criticising Ament and the other missionaries in China, wrote in a letter published in The Times on 21 March 1901: \\"In our time no group of Americans have won no more enduring honor for their country or done the world a greater benefit than have our missionaries in North China. In common decency, is it not time that if at home the full meed of honor cannot not be given them they be at least shielded from deprecating apology and unjust disparagement?\\"\\"The Missionaries: They Will Still Go On\\". Letter to the Editor of the New York Times, from Henry Stimson, 21 March 1901, published New York Times (24 March 1901). Edwin Conger Edwin Hurd Conger (7 March 1843 – 18 May 1907), the United States Minister to China (1898–1905), consistently defended the actions of Ament and the other missionaries. For example, on 25 April 1901, The New York Times reprinted an interview with Conger, originally conducted in Kobe, Japan on 6 April 1901 while both men were en route to the United States. Conger defended the actions of Ament, indicating confiscated goods had been sold to ensure the survival of Chinese Christians.\\"The Missionaries Defended: Interviews in Japan with Minister Conger and Dr. Ament: Goods Sold to Succor Native Christians.\\" Kobe Herald (24 April 1901). Reprinted in The New York Times (25 April 1901):2. Conger indicated that the missionaries \\"only appropriated their property for justifiable ends.\\"A History of the Precious Metals from the Earliest Times to the Present, 358. On the same day a Boston newspaper reported: \\"Dr. Ament explains the sale of goods in the Mongol prince's house in which he took up his quarters by saying that those with him were without food and that he sold the goods on the advice of Mr. Conger. Had they not taken possession of the place it would have been destroyed by the Russians. The amount realized by the sale was devoted to the needs of the native Christians.\\" The same despatch quoting from Mr. Conger says: > There were really no actions on the part of the missionaries there that were > not entirely justified. There was no government, no organization. There were > houses of men who had been firing on the foreign quarter; their property had > been abandoned as a result of a state of war, and it was taken in order to > succor hundreds of suffering and destitute Chinese whose lives the original > owners had been laboring to destroy. Winter was coming on, measures of some > kind were imperative, and the appropriation of property for the ends in view > was unquestionably justified. I am prepared to justify the conduct of the > American missionaries before the siege, during the siege and after the > siege.Edwin Conger, quoted in Porter, 242. Sir Claude Maxwell MacDonald Colonel Sir Claude Maxwell MacDonald (1852–1915), the chief British diplomat in Beijing during the Boxer Uprising, and the commander of the defence of the besieged foreign legations, also defended the missionaries: > If all looting is wrong, as in theory it is, then they have been to blame: > but there are times when the laws of nature assert themselves over the laws > of civilization, and this was a case in point. You must remember that these > men had just endured a long siege, that they had been bereft of everything > they possessed and that they had hundreds of men, similarly destitute, who > were dependent upon them. What was their position? Had they come to me and > said, 'Give us money and food,' I could only have replied in the negative, > or, at all events, to the effect that I could not feed their converts, and > so they took the law into their own hands. It has been a case of poetical or > primitive justice. But, granted that this sort of justice was admissible, I > do not admit that the missionaries abused it. I have not heard of a single > instance of a missionary looting for any purpose other than that of feeding > themselves and their converts who were dependent on them.Sir Claude > MacDonald, quoted in Porter, 244. Charles Denby Charles Harvey Denby (1830–1904), the United States Minister to China (1885–1898) in his posthumously published China and Her People (1905), supported Ament directly and criticised Twain implicitly: \\"The raid made on Doctor Ament some years ago is an example of how incautious people, who especially yearn to be funny, handle this subject....Doctor Ament's conduct was in accordance with Chinese\\" customs.Charles Denby, China and Her People, 217–218. =Newspaper Retractions= During the controversy both the New York Times and the New York Sun issued corrections. New York Times On 17 February 1901, the New York Times issued a retraction after receiving a different account of Ament's actions from Dr Judson Smith of the ABCFM, based on Ament's letter of 13 November 1900 to Smith. The Times reported that in Ament's own letter he indicated the compensation for the losses of the converts obtained by him had been \\"by appealing to the sense of justice among the villages where our people had lived.\\" The Times concluded: \\"It seems that we have been led into doing an injustice to him....In that case we have to express our sincere regret.\\"Editorial, The New York Times (17 February 1901) New York Sun On 5 March 1901, Wilbur Chamberlin, the journalist who started the controversy, telegraphed to the New York Sun the following, which appeared in that paper under the heading: \\"A Clean Bill for the Missionaries.\\": > Minister Conger will give a letter to the missionaries here stating that the > collection of indemnities was not extortion, but the payment was voluntary > on the part of the Chinese officials, and was moderate in amount. The > seizure of the property was justified by the prospect that a severe famine > was inevitable, and there was no government to look after the distressed > people. The proceeds of the seizures were used entirely for these people.\\"A > Clean Bill for Missionaries\\", Sun (March 1901); quoted in Porter, 236. Also in March the New York Sun printed an interview with Ament that indicated that the indemnity was not thirteen times the loss, but only one and one-third of the loss. Dr. Porter, Ament's biographer, a fellow missionary in Beijing, considered this an amende honorable.POrter, 236. =“To My Missionary Critics” (April 1901)= Twain apparently \\"liked the attention he was getting and wrote to a correspondent that he was in \\"hot water with the clergy and other goody- goody people, but I am enjoying it more than I have ever enjoyed hot water before.\\"Emerson, 258. In response to an open letter from the ABCFM demanding an apology, Twain penned \\"To My Missionary Critics,\\" which offered no apologies, although it ended by acknowledging that missionaries no doubt mean well. The essay, originally entitled \\"The Case of Rev. Dr. Ament, Missionary,\\" was published in the North American Review in April 1901. According to Fitch, \\"To My Missionary Critics\\" (1901) recapitulates the charges mounted against Reverend William Ament in \\"To the Person Sitting in Darkness\\" and underscores Twain's contempt for the American-Christian missionaries' role in imperialism.\\" Twain explored the delicate moral difference between a demand thirteen times as great as it should be and a demand that was only one and a third times the correct amount. As Paine explains, \\"The point had been made by the board that it was the Chinese custom to make the inhabitants of a village responsible for individual crimes; and custom, likewise, to collect a third in excess of the damage, such surplus having been applied to the support of widows and orphans of the slain converts.\\" Focusing on the exaggerated indemnity, Twain said: > To Dr. Smith the “thirteen-fold-extra” clearly stood for “theft and > extortion,” and he was right, distinctly right, indisputably right. He > manifestly thinks that when it got scaled away down to a mere “one-third” a > little thing like that was some other than “theft and extortion.” Why, only > the board knows! I will try to explain this difficult problem so that the > board can get an idea of it. If a pauper owes me a dollar and I catch him > unprotected and make him pay me fourteen dollars thirteen of it is “theft > and extortion.” If I make him pay only one dollar thirty-three and a third > cents the thirty-three and a third cents are “theft and extortion,” just the > same. In this article, Twain offered some further illustrations, including the “Tale of a King and His Treasure” and another tale entitled “The Watermelons.” Twain wrote: > I have it now. Many years ago, when I was studying for the gallows, I had a > dear comrade, a youth who was not in my line, but still a scrupulously good > fellow though devious. He was preparing to qualify for a place on the board, > for there was going to be a vacancy by superannuation in about five years. > This was down South, in the slavery days. It was the nature of the negro > then, as now, to steal watermelons. They stole three of the melons of an > adoptive brother of mine, the only good ones he had. I suspected three of a > neighbor’s negroes, but there was no proof, and, besides, the watermelons in > those negroes’ private patches were all green and small and not up to > indemnity standard. But in the private patches of three other negroes there > was a number of competent melons. I consulted with my comrade, the > understudy of the board. He said that if I would approve his arrangements he > would arrange. I said, “Consider me the board; I approve; arrange.” So he > took a gun and went and collected three large melons for my brother-on-the- > halfshell, and one over. I was greatly pleased and asked: > “Who gets the extra one?” “Widows and orphans.” > “A good idea, too. Why didn’t you take thirteen?” > “It would have been wrong; a crime, in fact-theft and extortion.” > “What is the one-third extra—the odd melon—the same?” > It caused him to reflect. But there was no result. The justice of the peace > was a stern man. On the trial he found fault with the scheme and required us > to explain upon what we based our strange conduct—as he called it. The > understudy said:“On the custom of the niggers. They all do it.” > The justice forgot his dignity and descended to sarcasm. “Custom of the > niggers! Are our morals so inadequate that we have to borrow of niggers?” > Then he said to the jury: “Three melons were owing; they were collected > from persons not proven to owe them: this is theft; they were collected by > compulsion: this is extortion. A melon was added for the widows and orphans. > It was owed by no one. It is another theft, another extortion. Return it > whence it came, with the others. It is not permissible here to apply to any > purpose goods dishonestly obtained; not even to the feeding of widows and > orphans, for this would be to put a shame upon charity and dishonor it.” He > said it in open court, before everybody, and to me it did not seem very > kind. =Ament's Response= When Ament became aware of the criticism of his activities and the subsequent controversy, he was affected adversely. Ament admitted the strain in a letter to his wife on Sunday, 27 January 1901: \\"I am doing what I do not recall that I ever did before, remaining at home deliberately and missing all the services. I need the rest and felt that it was imperative. You see there is no let up for me. It is a constant strain from morning till night.\\" Missionary colleague Miss Nellie Naomi Russell (born Ontonagon, Michigan, 31 March 1862; died 22 August 1911 in China) records: > ...when he was weary in body and mind, there came like a thunderbolt the > article by Mark Twain in the North American Review. I remember that day I > went to his study on a matter of business, and found him sitting at his desk > as if stricken at the heart. I exclaimed, \\"What is it? Are you ill?\\" \\"If I > am what that man says, I am not fit for you to speak to me ! I feel as > though I should go off and hide myself in a cave in the mountain, never > again to be seen of man.\\" I thought he had gone out of his head with all his > cares, and I replied, \\" What you need is rest and a doctor, and I am going > to send for one.\\" If the writer of that article could have seen how he > suffered he would have felt that every cent he received for that article > would be a red hot coal of fire. A brave, masterful man he was, ever ready > to relieve, not to add to the sum of human suffering, and while in some > things he may have been unwise, his mistakes, whatever they may have been, > were of the head and not the heart.Miss N.N. Russell, quoted in Porter 210. After Twain's initial article, ABCFM secretary,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Button_blockquote.png Rev. Dr. Judson Smith wrote to Agent, and enquired as to the propriety of missionaries collecting indemnity, Ament and Tewksbury both replied that the Chinese themselves preferred this to being subjected to extortionate measures from local officials. Additionally, Ament and Tewksbury indicated that their activities had been approved by the other missionaries.Young, The Rhetoric of Empire, 193–194. Ament indicated in a letter to his wife on 18 February 1901: > I reviewed my whole work in collecting indemnity and they [Dr. and Mrs. > Sheffield] fully approved and are prepared to defend the course taken. The > correspondents who have written were all in the dark, and had made no proper > inquiries. I have invited correspondents to come and see what was being > done, but they did not come. I have been very unjustly treated by these > writers, and my friends are coming to the front in defense, as all the > missions have done the same things, and all believe they are right. So also > does Mr. Conger, who is our good friend. Do not be disturbed by anything you > see in the papers. The correspondents jump on to the missionaries when they > are out of matter, and news has been very scarce this winter. Dr. Sheffield > thinks it better for the work that I return home now than wait a little > longer and make my class reunion in 1902.Porter, 222. Ament left Beijing on 26 March 1901 to return to the United States to make his case, clear his name and defend the reputation of the other missionaries.The Current Encyclopedia: A Monthly Record of Human Progress. Volume 1. (Modern Research Society, 1901):37. On 1 April 1901, Ament, refusing to be a scapegoat in the affair, cabled the following to the ABCFM: > Nothing has been done except after consultation with colleagues and the full > approval of the United States Minister. I will secure a certificate from Mr. > [Edwin H.] Conger to that effect.\\"William Ament, cable to ABCFM, 1 April > 1901, in The Open Court: Devoted to the Science of Religion, the Religion of > Science, and the Extension of the Religious Parliament Idea by Paul Carus > (The Open Court Pub. Co., 1901):329. On 30 March 1901, the New York Tribune, reported Ament's rationale for his actions: > There seemed very little hope of native Christians receiving anything > through the instrumentality of their officials, nor did the foreign powers > think they were called upon to provide indemnity for these. All the > survivors of the churches were reduced to absolute poverty. They were > harmless, inoffensive people who had no feuds with their neighbors and had > not intruded their religion on any one. This at least was true of the > Protestant Christians. If a missionary, by means of his personal influence > and by the assistance of the local official who might be friendly to him, > could bring the neighbors of his persecuted people to see the error of their > ways, and persuade them to contribute money for the rebuilding of destroyed > houses and for the support of the survivors of the families, I think he was > justified in so doing.Ament, quoted in Porter, 251–252. Ament arrived back in the United States on 25 April 1901. On the same day, The New York Times reprinted an interview with Ament, originally conducted in Kobe, Japan on 6 April 1901 while Ament was en route to the United States. In this article, Ament admitted > the American and English missionaries looted the premises of Prince Yu and > other Chinese magnates and sold the plunder for the benefit of the missions, > the sale lasting two weeks. After disposing of all the loot, and finding > that the demand for sables and other valuable things was undiminished, they > purchased other plundered articles from the Russian and East Indian soldiers > and sold these at a profit.A History of the Precious Metals from the > Earliest Times to the Present, 355. Ament only received $75 from the British Loot Committee. Previous to this, a sale of garments and curios was held, and the $400 netted was given to the American Board of Foreign Missions, \\"with which Dr. Ament is connected. Dr. Ament explained that from the sale of goods plundered from the Mongol Prince's house only $4000 was realized, and this was devoted to the needs of the native Christians.\\" In May 1901 Ament responded to his critics during a brief visit to the United States of America in 1901 prior to his return to China.\\"Dr. Ament Answers Critics\\", The New York Times (10 May 1901) In response to the criticisms of Twain and others, Ament denied that the missionaries forced the Chinese to accept Christianity, and that \\"We treat their beliefs kindly, try to extract the good, and never interfere with their customs, except where they interfere with Christianity.\\"New York Times (10 May 1901) In response to Twain's specific allegations, Ament said: > The clan in China is responsible for the individuals and in collecting from > the clans we did only what it is the settled policy of the Chinese > themselves to do. It would have been impossible to have done otherwise....As > to the 'extra' indemnities, we had to provide them for the widows and > orphans left penniless and homeless, and who had lost no property to be paid > for because they had none. We collected an extra one-third with the consent > of the authorities, and distributed it among these people....It was > considered perfectly just and fair by everyone there. Then, too, we had to > provide for these people, and so we went to the abandoned grain shops and > took what we could find. If we had not done so the Chinese would have. We > promised to pay for everything we took. We also sold off all the furniture > and goods in the place and used the money to support our Christians. I have > been surprised to hear that this was criticised. On 16 May 1901, Ament addressing guests at the third annual Asiatic Society of America dinner in New York, again defended himself and his fellow missionaries: > The missionaries in China, of whom I am proud to be one, represent a class > of American citizens whose work in the Orient have been purposefully > misrepresented....The missionaries' words have been twisted, wring > interpretations made. The persistency of work like this can only justify the > feeling that the root of this un-American warfare is due, not so much to > what is seen or known of the deeds of missionaries, but the opposition to > Christianity itself. The purpose was fixed before China was reached at all, > and this murderous spirit stops not at injustice to individuals.\\"The > Asiastic Society Honors Mr. Conger\\" After Ament's death in January 1909, Judson Smith's successor, Dr. James Levi Barton (1855–1936) wrote in an obituary published in The Congregationalist: > The cruel and baseless attack made upon him [Ament] in this country by Mark > Twain, in 1901, left a deep wound in his heart, in spite of the fact that it > was clearly shown that his acts had been above criticism. He said one night, > as we were sitting in a Chinese inn upon our way to Shansi, \\"I presume there > are many in the United States who regard me as little better than a thief > and a robber.\\" I tried to assure him that no missionary was more honored > than he, none more absolutely trusted, as it had been proven that the > charges had no foundation in fact. He replied, \\"That is true, but do the > people believe the proof, and will the truth ever catch up with the > charge?'J.L. Barton, \\"A Loss to Both China and America\\", The > Congregationalist (1909); quoted in Porter, 365. =Further Responses= By the end of May 1901 ABCFM Board secretary Dr Judson Smith silenced Ament, as he believed further comments were damaging Ament and his colleagues. Smith attempted a final defence of Ament and the other missionaries in May in an essay entitled \\"The Missionaries and Their Critics.\\"See Judson Smith, \\"The Missionaries and their Critics,\\" North American Review 172 (May 1901).Oggel, 23. Arthur Henderson Smith \\"Somewhat at a disadvantage in this exchange, missionary leaders nevertheless attempted to influence opinion in treaty port China; Arthur Smith joined Reid and Judson Smith in writing letters to the North-China Herald justifying missionary actions and criticizing Twain.\\" In a letter to the ABCFM, which was in part published in the 5 May 1901 edition of the New York Times, Arthur Henderson Smith, writing from Beijing, defends Ament: > At the close of the siege Dr. Ament found himself with several hundred > Chinese Christians on his hands, homeless, and absolutely dependent on their > foreign pastor. With the permission of the Russian military authorities and > with the aid of the United States Legation, Mr. Ament took possession of a > Mongol house near the former mission premises, and as it was the > headquarters for the Boxers who destroyed those premises, it was judged > right and proper by all the authority then existing that the contents of > this house should be regarded as confiscated and should be sold for the > benefit of the Christians, which was done. This is the basis of the oft- > repeated charge of 'missionary looting', and it is a total misuse of > terms.Defends Dr. Ament's Course, 5 May 1901 Smith, in his China in Convulsion (1901) indicated > representatives of nine of the important missionary societies in China > issued, both in English and in Chinese, a \\"Statement\\" in regard to the > connection between missionaries and the present crisis. It is of the nature > of an explanation, and incidentally a defence, and has attracted favourable > comment from the leading foreign journals of Shanghai for its conspicuous > fairness and moderation of language. A paragraph from an article in the \\" > North China Daily News \\" dealing with should be quoted: > The charge that missionaries have manifested an improper desire to see > vengeance done on the perpetrators of last year's outrages is, except in > possible isolated cases, as unfounded as Mark Twain's ignorant charges > against Dr. Ament and his colleagues in Peking and its vicinity. Men who > have examined the whole question with an honest desire to arrive at the > truth without prejudice or partiality allow that the behaviour of the > missionaries as a body has not only been above reproach, but worthy of > praise and gratitude. They have been anxious, as we have all been anxious, > to see outrages such as those of last year made impossible in the future, > and as long as human nature is what it is, men must be deterred from crime > by the conviction that it will be followed by punishment ; and not to have > punished, and punished severely, the culprits of last year, would have been > to invite a repetition of their crimes.\\"Arthur Henderson Smith, China in > Convulsion, (New York: Fleming H. Revell Co., 1901):730–732. Smith continues: > It is incidentally a gratification to many whose sense of justice has been > outraged by the captious criticisms of those with neither knowledge nor > candour to comprehend existing conditions, to see that Mr. Conger has not > hesitated to take the responsibility for his own advice consistently given > to American citizens acting in times of storm and stress. He has > comprehensively replied to all the current criticism by the remark : \\" I am > prepared to justify the conduct of the missionaries before the siege, during > the siege, and after the siege.\\" Assessment of Ament \\"Twain had considerable popular support, and he did not budge from his positions, but forthrightly defended them in speeches and articles over the next several years.\\" In a letter to his best friend, Congregational clergyman Rev. Joseph Twichell in June 1901, Twain was unrepentant, referring to \\"Christian pirates like Ament and professional hypocrites and liars like Rev. Judson Smith of the American Board....Whenever you ask people to support them [foreign missions] Joe, do bar China. Their presence there is forbidden by the Bible and by every sentiment of humanity – and fair dealing. And they have done vast mischief there. I would bar no other country.\\"Mark Twain, quoted in William E. Phipps, Mark Twain's Religion (Mercer University Press, 2003): 212. A recent biography portrays Ament in a sympathetic light but concludes that he was \\"a brave and resourceful man whose heroism was tarnished by hubris and looting...William Ament, the most successful missionary in north China, the best evangelist, and the most dedicated pastor had committed a grave error....That others were no better, and many even worse was no excuse.\\"Thompson, Larry Clinton. William Scott Ament: Heroism, Hubris, and the Ideal Missionary.\\" Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2009, pp. 2, 214 Consequences In October 1901 The Foreign Christian Missionary Society held Mark Twain's attack on Ament responsible for its decrease in income. However, Dr E.E. Strong of Ament's own mission board, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, indicated that Twain's attacks actually helped the ABCFM financially: > We answered the charges so superabundantly that I think they affected very > few of our givers....Of course, they made a difference with some who had no > inclination to look into the matter. On the other hand, they helped us > financially.\\"Twain's Attack on Missions\\", Special to The New York Times (16 > October 1901):9; > https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1901/10/16/119082326.pdf.

Martin served as Special Assistant to Ronald Reagan for National Security Affairs, Executive Secretary of the United States National Security Council, and United States Deputy Secretary of Energy during the Ronald Reagan Administration. He was President of the Council of the University for Peace, appointed to the Council by Secretary General of the United Nations Kofi Annan. In 1992, he was Executive Director of the Republican Platform committee under George H. W. Bush. Martin was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He achieved his Bachelor of Science from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1972 and his Master of Science from MIT in 1974. His master's thesis was the basis of an article he co-authored with George Cabot Lodge in the March, 1975 Harvard Business Review entitled Our Society in 1985: Business May Not Like It.https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12mYYsKdpHdjL-Ak7zic8yAsjDdQUDstM William Martin is the recipient of seven letters of merit from Ronald Reagan, received the Order of the Rising Sun in person from Emperor Akihito of Japan, and was commended by Czech President Vaclav Havel for significant contributions to the Czech Republic. He received the highest honor of the Department of Energy for contributions in the fields of energy security and science and technology including fathering both the human genome project (1986) and international thermonuclear experimental reactor - ITER (1985).

Martin’s publications have appeared in the Harvard Business Review, Harvard International Review, MIT Technology Review, and the Wall Street Journal. He has authored several books on energy, environment, and national security through MIT Press (two books), McGraw-Hill, Trilateral Commission, United States Department of Energy, and the International Energy Agency. His books have been published in Japanese, German, and French.https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13E5iZetPrIZMwwh8B6dyfWm137GhTLty William F. Martin’s official White House government National Security Council files are available in the Ronald Reagan Library archive.  Education and early career  As a graduate student at MIT, he was part of a team that prepared ten days of Congressional hearings chaired by Congressman John Dingell on Growth and Its Implications for the Future (Roundtable Press, 1973).http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/MIT/Growth%20and%20Its%20Implications.pdf The hearings were in response to the Club of Rome's report, The Limits to Growth and were aimed at providing the first Congressional hearings on the world economic, energy and environmental outlook and the need for sustainable growth strategies. He was also part of an MIT engineering group that produced a volume for the United Nations Environmental Program on resource materials for studies in environmental management. He is co-author of the report, Professional Materials for Environmental Management Education (MIT Press, 1975). These publications were induced by the first United Nations conference on the environment held in Stockholm in 1972 and headed by Maurice Strong who said of Growth and Its Implications for the Future, \\"This small volume summarizes much of the important work going on today with regard to global survival...I know of no other publication to date which emphasizes more systematically or extensively, and in such readable form, the interacting relationships amongst diverse fields.\\" Following graduating from MIT, Martin joined the MIT Energy Laboratory as a Program officer for the Workshop on Alternative Energy Strategies (WAES) headed by Professor Carroll L. Wilson, the first General Manager of the US Atomic Energy Commission. This fifteen country energy assessment group, headquartered at MIT, met for three years and produced the report, Energy: Global Energy Prospects 1985-2000 (McGraw-Hill, 1975). Martin was a co-author of the final report and editor of Energy Supply to the Year 2000 (MIT Press, 1977).https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12OZPnnouEHf834CRutCLEQDG4GIpUB13 Martin was responsible for energy supply analysis as well as energy projections of developing nations. He and his co-author Frank J.P. Pinto were responsible for using the SIMLINK model of the World Bank as an economic foundation for projecting energy futures for developing nations. This World Bank-MIT project entitled Energy and Economic Growth Prospects for the Developing Countries: 1960-2000 (MIT Press, 1977). was one of the pioneering research attempts to estimate energy prospects for developing countries. alt=Martin with Carroll L. Wilson, Martin with Carroll L. Wilson, Normandy, 1976 Martin then moved to Paris where he was responsible for energy statistics for developing countries at the International Energy Agency Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and was part of a UN expert group that developed the methodology for reporting United Nations energy statistics. The statistics were published in the volumes I and II of the report Workshop on Energy Data of Developing Countries (IEA/OECD, 1978).https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C59-kGJZfIfz-h92g3SCUneSX8kfRBk6 Martin was also director of the IEA Workshop on Energy Statistics for Developing Countries that resulted in the first publication of energy statistics for over 100 countries in a matrix supply/demand integration format. In 1978, he was promoted to Special Assistant to the Executive Director of the IEA, Ulf Lantzke, and served in this capacity for two years during the time of the Second Oil Shock. At the commencement of the Iran-Iraq war, it was agreed that nations should coordinate their oil stock draws in the event of a major disruption. As the Special Assistant to the IEA Executive Director, Martin served as the coordinator for four IEA Ministerial meetings where he aided in the drafting of several communiques, including the one from 1981 that is the basis of IEA agreements today on coordinated stock draw as well as a key element of the 2009 discussions between Henry Kissinger (the founder of IEA), Nobuo Tanaka (then Executive Director) and Martin on expanding this concept to include China, India and other advancing nations. A letter from Kissinger to Martin recognizing his contribution in this regard can be seen online. William Martin, Nobuo Tanaka and Henry Kissinger  Reagan Administration  Martin and Gorbachev Gromyko to meeting with Ronald ReaganMartin escorting Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko to meeting with Ronald Reagan In 1981, Martin joined the United States Department of State as Special Assistant to Under Secretary of State James L. Buckley who recalled Martin's activities in his book Gleanings from an Unplanned Life.https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ca0e5STzoIbwyH9fk3fKo6AdOBsthUX_ The senior Reagan administration inter-agency \\"Buckley Group\\" that Martin coordinated sought to reduce European subsidies and credits to the Soviet Union. It also urged Europeans to reduce their dependence on Soviet gas and to find alternatives. Finally, it proposed market oriented energy policies for the United States (deregulation of oil and gas price controls, permitting Alaskan oil exports, allowing eminent domain for coal slurry pipelines) -- all policies of which eventually came to fruition during the Reagan Presidency. (see reference to this again in James Buckley's Gleanings from an Unplanned Life). Martin briefed President Reagan in the Oval Office that unless the US was credible in its energy policies, the Europeans would not take seriously our concerns on their over dependence on Soviet gas imports. In 1982, he was transferred to the National Security Council as the Director of International Economic Affairs. In this capacity he prepared recommendations for the President in the areas of energy security, East-West economic relations, the Iran-Iraq War and Central American economic development. A key responsibility of Martin's was to conceptualize and then negotiate with the Europeans on the issue of reducing their reliance on Soviet natural gas imports, a project that was directed personally by President Reagan. Martin made a key presentation to President Reagan on alternative gas scenarios for Europe, concluding that the Troll field was vital for European security. Martin's role was to negotiate the development of the giant Norwegian Troll gas field to be an alternative to Soviet gas imports and this was documented in the book Troll: Gas for Generations, an excerpt of which can be seen online.https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18IYbgfI4KuM789vHTq3pMpCYKUOK6MrG This was part of a larger program to undermine the Soviet economy as reported by Peter Schweizer in his book, Victory: The Reagan Administration's Secret Strategy that Hastened the Collapse of the Soviet Union and the excerpt where he credited Martin for this effort can be seen online.https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13gdl09TZAhItvANiRqUHBZTpuLQcpOAO Martin with Reagan in Williamsburg Martin is also credited in a Presidential citation as the principal draftsman of the Williamsburg Declaration, at the 9th G7 Summithttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13gdl09TZAhItvANiRqUHBZTpuLQcpOAO which is a three-page communique agreed to by the G-7 leaders who were Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of the UK, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone of Japan, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau of Canada, Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani of Italy and Prime Minister François Mitterrand of France. The President read the three-page declaration before the world press (President Reagan's opening remarks can be seen on online) and credited Martin as the principal draftsman in the following online letter. Many conclude that this jointly agreed document, which argued for free markets and free trade policies, set in place the foundations for a worldwide economic recovery beginning in 1983. Based on these achievements, Martin was appointed Special Assistant to President Reagan, responsible for the coordination of the President's international and head of state meetings. Reagan reading Martin cards prior to Oval Office meeting Martin helped arrange President Reagan's international meetings coordinating with the White House Advance Office, NSC staff and the Department of State. He participated in the President's visits to Japan (1983), South Korea (1983), China (1984), Ireland (1984), United Kingdom (1984), the D-Day fortieth anniversary commemoration on Normandy beaches in France (1984), Canada (1985), Spain (1985), Germany (1985), EU Parliament (1985), the Reagan-Gorbachev Geneva Summit (1985) and several G-7 economic summit meetings (Williamsburg, London and Bonn). Working closely with the State Department and NSC staff, he also coordinated the preparation of President Reagan's Oval Office head of state meetings. As NSC Senior Director for Coordination, he coordinated and participated in the President's major bilateral meetings with, among others, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone of Japan, Shimon Peres of Israel, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, President Ali Saibou of Niger, King Hussein of Jordan, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of the UK, Prime Minister Bettino Craxi of Italy, Prime Minister Kåre Willoch of Norway, Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanond of Thailand, Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa of Sri Lanka, Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko of the USSR, OECD Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye, UN Secretary General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany. In addition to general preparations for the President's meeting with the Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev, he and Dr. Alvin Trivelpiece were responsible for concluding an agreement with his Russian counterpart Academic Evgeny Velikhov on magnetic fusion cooperation that has since become the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor)https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nYQhUCioJ3sQDUr_LTk2wRYybt6zdNYu project as recognized in the concluding sentence of the communique of this historic meeting, \\"The two leaders emphasized the potential importance of the work aimed at utilizing controlled thermonuclear fusion for peaceful purposes and, in this connection, advocated the widest practicable development of international cooperation in obtaining this source of energy, which is essentially inexhaustible, for the benefit for all mankind\\". In preparation for major visits abroad and in the Oval office, as well as visits outside the United States, Martin would sometimes do the first draft of the President's weekly radio address in close coordination with Presidential chief speech writer Ben Elliott. Three of these addresses were especially important. First, Reagan's radio address in 1984 following his first meeting with a Soviet leader (Foreign Minister Gromyko) after four years in office.https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15nA4VRFFRZzzpxYmCuWl7UVAf__rOClc This widely quoted radio address, highlighted in headlines on the front page of the Washington Post set the agenda and tone for the subsequent meeting with Soviet leader Gorbachev one year later. Reagan recognized Martin's role in its drafting in the following letter.https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L_J6u3FGhNy6EHaoeaqJGX1iSYuYu4cD Second, Martin prepared a radio address describing the G-7 Economic Meeting chaired by Margaret Thatcher in 1984. And third, he prepared a radio address in 1983 describing the President's visit to Japan and Korea.  National Security Council  Martin served as the Executive Secretary of the National Security Council in the Reagan White House.https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BkV0Go6PVDOI3Oysy34b_W7Eztw3vw7k The Executive Secretary is the head of the NSC as defined by the National Security Act of 1947. In practice, it serves as the NSC's chief of staff responsible for coordination, budget and management of the National Security Council. The Executive Secretary coordinates the National Security Council meetings and manages vital policy and information communication from the Cabinet and the NSC staff to the President. One of the duties of Mr. Martin as Executive Secretary was to oversee the White House Situation Room located in the basement of the West Wing of the White House which is in 24/7 communication with the Department of Defense, State Department, Intelligence Community and US embassies abroad. Martin in National Security Meeting Martin briefs President Reagan on Abu Nidal Martin Cabinet briefing on Central American economic development Martin 35th birthday celebration on Air Force One As Executive Secretary, Martin also chaired an Executive Secretary group composed of officials from State, Defense, CIA and the NSC responsible for coordinating the President's national security priorities as identified in a book titled National Security Issues of the United States. Martin developed a system for briefing the President using a six-month national security intelligence, policy and implementation calendar working closely with his inter-agency colleagues Colin Powell and Robert Gates. Situation Room Martin also initiated and coordinated the production of several videos prepared for the President describing Reagan's international visits, objectives and \\"scene- setters\\" including his visit to China in 1984, his visit to Europe to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of D-Day and a preview of the historic first meeting with Soviet leader Gorbachev in Geneva in 1985, a script of which can be seen online.https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bwGX64iT0GiCQtab7QxlcKHLYqScq6S_ These videos were presented to the President just before visits to supplement other written and oral presentations. At the time of the Iran-Iraq war in 1984, Martin was responsible for the coordination of an NSC Special Situation Group headed by Vice-President Bush on building up the defensive capabilities of friendly Middle Eastern countries and developing a strategy to cope with potential oil market disruptions. The briefing to the President was the culmination of several meetings of the NSC working group, documents of which can be found here: Memo on Internal Paper on Persian Gulf; Memo outlining talking points; Memo to McFarlane on working group; Memo to Clark updating the situation;https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VfwwAN7Oi09HBOHub92hWwN_Y6ZCQaT9 and cables between President Reagan and British Prime Minister Thatcher on the subject. Martin's role was detailed by Robert C. McFarlane in his book Special Trust, an excerpt of which can be seen online. The plan, approved by the President and Vice President, was an important step in building US military capability in the Gulf resulting in the successful defense of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in the 1991 Gulf War. The plan also stimulated the buildup of the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Martin's now declassified presentation to the President can be seen online In 1985, Martin chaired an NSC inter-agency group on Central American Economic Development. The conclusion of the working group, presented to and approved by the President,https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pHi-aqTSK- FdyVZeoDryOA4xPNH0O1QE was threefold: encourage free market reforms; contribute $8 billion in economic assistance; and encourage continued security in the region. The actual Reagan National Security Study Directive (NSSD) describing these initiatives can be viewed on reaganlibrary.gov. The policy also called upon all US Cabinet officers to assist Central America in its quest for economic development (i.e. agriculture, energy, commerce and transportation). The theme of the presentation was that security assistance in Central America would be enhanced through economic growth and prosperity. Without economic progress, the security situation would continue to unravel. During the Christmas holiday season in 1985, Mr. Martin was traveling with President Reagan to California as the NSC aide. During this time, there was a terrorist attack on the Rome and Vienna airports, resulting in the deaths of many innocent men, women and children. Martin set up an NSC crisis management center on the site of the Annenberg Estate where the President was staying and kept the President updated with morning, noon and evening meetings.https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1khh- mQJsVXT7KXtT8-RmbU0u0dXaWnH1 The terrorist was Abu Nidal and the New York Times reported that Martin was handling the terrorist attack for the President. It was learned that Abu Nidal had backing from Libya and a key question for the President was the appropriate response. The President responded that since the attacks were in Rome and Vienna, authorities in those countries should bring the criminals to justice. \\"This is not a time to spread violence in the region\\", the President told Martin and also told him to tell Israel not to attack Syrian missiles in the Beqaa Valley. Three months later when Americans were killed in the La Belle Discotheque bombing in Berlin, President Reagan responded with an attack on Gaddafi's compound codenamed Operation El Dorado Canyon. William Martin was also involved in the conceptualization and implementation of the National Program Office. The National Program was established to ensure continuity of the United States government in the even of a nuclear attack. This deterrence system was later adapted following the 9/11 attacks to protect the US government in the event of a hostile terrorist attack. Department of Energy Martin with Ed Teller at DOE In June 1986, Martin was nominated by President Reagan and confirmed by the United States Senate as United States Deputy Secretary of Energy, the number two official of the United States Department of Energy.https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14U6R3Sm208tkhrxGEWzAC0gTrfMYBYx4 Martin reported to Secretary of Energy John S. Herrington. The DOE is responsible for the nation's nuclear weapons complex, scientific research and energy policy. At the time of his confirmation, the department had over 150,000 employees and contractors. Martin was awarded the department's highest award by Energy Secretary John S. Herrington for a report he produced, Energy Security: Report to the President of the United States. It was the first comprehensive inter-agency, publicly available study on US energy security and concluded that energy imports would continue to rise and that US must strive for greater energy efficiency and development of clean coal technology, safe nuclear power, natural gas, solar and other renewable technologies, as well as to maintain incentives for environmentally sensitive domestic oil development. Martin testified before the United States Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on the study conclusions. His testimony can be seen online. For this, he was commended by the Democratic Chairman of the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce, John Dingell. Martin was also the administration's top energy adviser on the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement that opened up energy markets between the United States and Canada. He was commended for his work as a member of the negotiating team and core member of the Cabinet group that oversaw the negotiations with Canada.https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nFG8875UFXhQP2-ZVjSmCgJo7DPzXNNg Martin's testimony on behalf of the agreement before the US House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs, Subcommittee on International Economic Policy, Trade and Western Hemisphere Affairs can be seen online. Acting Energy Secretary Martin at 200th anniversary celebration of US Constitution In 1986, Martin engaged then-Governor and future President Bill Clinton in a debate before the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on the merits of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's powers to set interstate electricity rates.https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ebAhjpirDzyOcZyqIRBERkNv5Vl6qlWm The Senate Committee supported Martin's view, objected to by Clinton, that an electricity holding company, Grand Gulf, could justifiably raise electricity prices in the state of Arkansas due to cost overruns of the Grand Gulf Nuclear Generating Station operating in Mississippi. Though Arkansas received no power from Grand Gulf because of their interstate jurisdictions under US federal law, this debate was significant in that it established firm guidelines for the US electricity industry during a period of deregulation and concern over \\"rate shock.\\" Martin with Human Genome and ITER displays at US DOE HQ During Martin's tenure at the DOE, he was presented with and approved a proposal by Dr. Alvin Trivelpiece to map the Human Genome.https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a7QxRGDqo8KMXlykQnHbJmUxuDYRKMxg The Human Genome Project was the crown jewel of 20th century biology. This chart (available online) was used in the Spring of 1986 by Trivelpiece, then Director of the Office of Energy Research in the Department of Energy, to brief Martin and Under Secretary Joseph Salgado regarding his intention to reprogram $4 million to initiate the project with the approval of Secretary Herrington. This reprogramming was followed by a line item budget of $16 million the following year. This modest effort triggered the activities that led to the sequencing of the Human Genome. It is notable that this scientific gem was launched by the math, physics and supercomputing strengths of the Department of Energy. Trivelpiece and Martin, under the supervision of Secretary Herrington, also collaborated on a project to launch the Superconducting Super Collider. In 1987, Acting Secretary of Energy Martin also joined President Reagan and members of his cabinet and the United States Supreme Court to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the ratification of the United States Constitution. President Reagan, accompanied by his Cabinet, spoke on the footsteps of the US Capitol addressing hundreds of thousands of Americans celebrating the event on the National Mall. Martin has continued to work with the DOE on various projects since his tenure as Deputy Secretary. From 2002 to 2004, he served on the Secretary's Advisory Board (SEAB), chairing the industry-government sub-committee and participated in the drafting of its 2003 report Critical Choices: Science, Energy and Security. Since 2002, he has been Chairman of the Nuclear Energy Advisory Committee (NEAC)https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OjyuqC1aWZH97w7rrCELJJ5gkInH-mNn and was a committee member of a SEAB group to review the Department of Science.https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y7Dnj9F7ymju3g78TBn4tfHPeUmJek1V Recently, he served in an advisory capacity on the DOE's Strategic Technology Energy Plan (STEP) aimed to utilize technological gains in energy efficiency to both reduce carbon emissions as well as overall energy consumption. His contribution to the project was to create an energy supply/demand ‘matrix’ approach to detail all sectors of energy use (industrial, commercial, residential etc.) and supplies to meet those demands.

There are still over 150 of his works known to be in existence. In an era when French artists dominated the genre, the arrival of Wyck and other Dutch and Flemish artists in Great Britain from 1660 onwards provided the catalyst for the development of military and naval art in Britain. Like other painters from the Low Countries such as Dirk Maas, Peter Tillemans and William van de Velde, Wyck moved to England and worked there throughout his life, often under royal patronage, producing many fine works of battle paintings, portraits, hunting scenes and landscapes as well as advancing the development of British art through teaching.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography:Wyck, Jan, by Katherine Gibson pp.615 Early life A sketch of the Old St Paul's Cathedral done by Jan's father Thomas Wyck in 1673. Jan Wyck was born on 29 October 1652, in Haarlem, then part of the Dutch Republic. The son of Thomas Wyck (1616-1677), also a Dutch painter, it is assumed that his father taught him to paint, although little is actually known of his early life. His father had spent much of the 1630s in Rome, refining an Italianate style, which can be seen in the works of both father and son. It appears likely that at a fairly young age he and his father moved to England during the reign of Charles II of England, possibly in 1664. It also seems likely that they were in London at the time of the Great Fire of London, as his father created one of the last sketches of Old St Paul's Cathedral in its ruined state before it was knocked down to create the new St Paul's Cathedral, as well as night scenes of the fire itself. The first documented reference to Jan Wyck comes from the sessions of the London court of the Painter-Stainers' Company where, on 17 June 1674, he is recorded as promising to pay both his own and his father's quarterly fees. At this hearing he also promised to soon deliver his 'proofe piece'. However his father had returned to Haarlem within a year, and died less than two and a half years later on 19 August 1677. Although the details of his first marriage are unknown, Jan Wyck was married for a second time on 22 November 1676 with his certificate stating: 'Jan Wick of St Paul's Covent Garden, gent., widower, about 31 ...'. The reference to him being a widower at the age of 24 indicates he was first married at a young age. His second wife was a 19-year-old English woman called Anne Skinner of St Martin-in-the- fields, and she bore him four children between 1678 and 1683, but none of them survived their early childhood. Following the death of Anne in 1687, he remarried for the third time to a Dutch woman by the name of Elizabeth Holomberg in 1688. They moved into a new home in Mortlake, and between 1689 and 1693 they had two sons (John, b.1689 and William, b.1691) and a daughter (Elizabeth, b. 1693) together. His wife Elizabeth died giving birth to their daughter. Art career The Battle of the Boyne, by Jan Wyck, c.1693. As the son of a fairly successful artist, it is likely Wyck was painting and drawing from a young age. Enjoying the patronage of the Duke of Ormond Wyck was known as the best landscape painter in London by 1686. By the time William III of England ascended to the throne, Wyck was also enjoying the patronage of the Duke of Monmouth.British Artists and War. Peter Harrington (1993) He painted a portrait of Monmouth on horseback in the 1670s, as well as many depictions of him in battle, such as at the Siege of Maastricht in 1673, and at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge in 1679. Wyck was placed upon the committee of Acting Painters of the Painter-Stainers' Company on 24 November 1680, which was a recognition of his rising talent. He first made a public name for himself when he accompanied fellow Dutch painter Dirk Maas to Ireland to paint the campaigns of William III. Maas had received a commission from King William to paint the Battle of the Boyne, and, although it is not known if he was also present at the battle, Wyck also painted many scenes from the battle. Throughout the 1690s, he is known to have created at least half a dozen oils of the battle, as well as countless battle pieces, encampments and equestrian portraits of soldiers before battle. William was impressed with his work, and commissioned him to paint himself, which he did many times, often in equestrian poses. William had soon also called upon Wyck to depict countless scenes of his campaigns throughout the low countries during the Nine Years' War (also known as King William's War), including the Siege of Namur, and the Siege of Naarden. Other scenes he painted include the Siege of Derry (1689), and the horse and battle portion of Godfrey Kneller's famous portrait of the Duke of Schomberg, who had been killed at the Battle of the Boyne. Wyck's works are notable for their flair and colour, as well as the excellent attention to detail. He highlights features such as flourishing sabres, firing muskets, flaring horses nostrils and cannons spouting flames. But most importantly he brought the viewer into the battle at a time when the prevailing trend was to present birds-eye views over a battle, showing disposition and locations of troop formations. He personalised the soldiers, and created an atmospheric presentation of the scenes depicted. He also celebrated notable commanders and recognisable figures within his works, a feature that made him popular with those commissioning works.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography:Wyck, Jan, by Katherine Gibson pp.616 Later life Jan Wyck began to school young British artists whilst continuing to work on his own projects, and became highly influential in the development of British art in the period, particularly in the genre of battle painting. One of his principal students that went on to produce great works of national importance was John Wootton, who exemplified British equestrian and military art in the early eighteenth century. Another student was the amateur painter Sir Martin Beckman and Matthias Read.Katharine Gibson, ‘Wyck , Jan (c.1645–1700)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 9 Oct 2015 Read moved to Whitehaven and became known as the \\"Father of Cumbrian Painting\\". Jan Wyck died at his family home in Mortlake, Surrey, on 17 May 1702, aged 56.

Agnoletti, Mauro, et al., eds. Wallingford, England: CABI Publishing, 2000, p. 22. Additionally, the Forest History Society maintains a publication program, publishing the Environmental History journal, Forest History Today magazine, an Issues Series, and environmental and conservation-focused monographs; an education program, to build understanding and appreciation of human interaction with the natural world; and a liaison function between scholars, policymakers, and landowners. The Society also works to promote and reward academic scholarship in the fields of forest, conservation, and environmental history. History In 1946, a small group of historians and forest industry executives came together to form an organization dedicated to preserving the documentary forest heritage of North America. The \\"Forest Products History Foundation\\" was founded, and began as a program of the Minnesota Historical Society. Over the following decade, archival source materials were collected, an oral history interview program was created, and a scholarly quarterly journal began publication. In 1955, under second executive director Elwood Rondeau \\"Woody\\" Maunder, the Society incorporated as an independent nonprofit organization under the new name \\"Forest History Foundation.\\" The name was changed to \\"Forest History Society\\" four years later in 1959. The organization left Minnesota in 1964, moving first to the Yale University campus in 1964, and then to the University of California at Santa Cruz in 1969. In 1984 the Society was moved to its current home in Durham, North Carolina, establishing an affiliation with Duke University and the Nicholas School of the Environment. In 1996, a partnership was formed between the Forest History Society and the American Society for Environmental History. This relationship helped widen the scope of the Society's mission beyond the boundaries of forest and conservation history to include subjects related to the broader field of environmental history. Publications The Forest History Society publishes a magazine, Forest History Today, and co-publishes the Environmental History journal with the American Society for Environmental History. A regular Issues Series is also published by the Society on environmental topics of contemporary interest such as fire, wetlands, and forests. Featured books representing important scholarship in the fields of forest, conservation, and environmental history are also published. The Society provides further financial, editorial, and research assistance to other authors publishing books in the subject area of environmental history.

Moser is one of the most collected of 20th century decorative glassMcConnell (2006), pps. 14–15 and has been used everywhere from palaces to local restaurants. From its beginnings in 1857, as a polishing and engraving workshop, it developed into a lead-free glass manufacturer lasting through the 20th century until the present. It is considered as the most luxurious Czech brand. History Founder Ludwig Moser in 1901 Amberina glass pitcher by Moser c. 1880 Ruby glass punch bowl set by Moser c. 1880 The original company Moser glassworks, founded in 1857 by Ludwig Moser in Karlovy Vary, was a glass workshop initially devoted to polishing and engraving glass blanks;Arwas (1996) p. 50 only later did the company begin designing and making its own art glass products.McConnell (2006), pps. 54–55 Engraving blanks, from Loetz, Meyr's Neffe and Harrachov was performed by the workshop in the early years. At the Vienna International Exhibition of 1873 he was awarded a medal for merit; that same year he was appointed the exclusive supplier of glass to the Emperor Franz Joseph I. He would win numerous other awards in the coming years, including medals at the World Exhibitions in Paris in 1879, 1889 and 1900, and the World Exhibition in Chicago in 1893. Ludwig took over a glass factory in Dvory (, now part of Karlovy Vary) in 1893 to create a full service glassworks employing 400 people, later under the name Glassworks Ludwig Moser & Sons (, ) where his sons Gustav and Rudolf also worked. In 1904 Moser received a warrant to supply the Imperial Court of the Emperor of Austria and four years later became supplier to Edward VII. In 1915 the company exhibited at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition and was again awarded a medal, which Louis Comfort Tiffany and Charles Tuthill thought well deserved due to the outstanding quality of the hot glass applied decorations on coloured Bohemian glass.Crofford (2001), p. 170 Art Nouveau glass pieces were produced Moser with surface decoration with natural themes and simple cameo glass. They also used the Eckentiefgravur technique employing a sharp angular body deeply cut in the form of intaglio flowers. Following the death of his father in 1916, Leo Moser took over the direction and the company expanded significantly resulting in their recognition by a Grand Prize award at the Paris International Exhibition of Decorative Art in 1925. They also exhibited in London, Belgium, Italy and Vienna.Luther (2002), p. 124 The Art Nouveau designs of heavily engraved lilies and the Fipop series from c1914 were some of the most notable pieces. Several cheaper lower quality derivatives of the Fipop designs were produced by other companies and between 1927 and 1933 two American glassmakers made copies calling them Woodland and Deerwood. Moser was one of the few Czechoslovakian glassmakers to sign their pieces.McConnell (2006), p. 32 The depression of the early 1930s exacted its toll, reducing its staff to 240, eventually Leo resigned from the company in 1932. Later, having sold their company shares in the company in 1938, they fled the county after areas of Czechoslovakia were annexed. The city of Karlovy Vary was occupied by Nazi Germany in 1938 after the Munich Agreement and the family fled the country during this anti-Semitic period. Because of its international reputation, the company was able to retain some independence during the communist era while the rest of the Czech glass industry was nationalised in 1948 (Crystalex).McConnell (2006), p. 59 Glass of Kings and King among Glass The slogan Moser - the king of glass originated in January 1869, when the director of the Vienna Museum for Art and Industry Rudolf Eitelberger issued a certificate about the perfection of Ludwig Moser's glass. Its quality was also confirmed by the medal from 1873 Vienna World's Fair. This year, Moser became an official supplier of glass to Vienna for the Austrian Imperial Court of Franz Joseph I. Since 1901 for the Persian Shah Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar and from 1908 for King Edward VII of England. Later also for Pope Pius XI, the Turkish sultan Abdul Hamid II., and the king Luís I of Portugal and his wife, Maria Pia of Savoy.http://www.palacioajuda.pt/pt- PT/coleccoes/vidro/ContentDetail.aspx?id=330 At that time, Moser already had a sales office in New York, London, Paris and St. Petersburg. Thus, the nickname of the Moser glassworks spread to Glass of Kings and King among Glass. Today Moser glassmaker in 2011 Glasses by Moser Ludwig Moser developed a lead-free sodium-potassium glass that is more ecologically friendly than lead glass yet is extremely hard; it remains the basis of their products. Moser still produces some of its classic Fipop designs. A factory museum shows the 150-year story of the company in more than 2,000 pieces on display supplemented by documentaries and audio guides. Besides having four retail outlets in the Czech Republic, two in Prague and two in the company's hometown Karlovy Vary, Moser has a worldwide network of retailers.

It was also published under the titles The Untold History of the Potato and Potato: A History of the Propitious Esculent. The potato has been present and influential during the major events in the last 500 years. These include the historical moments of discovery and culture change that have led to the present globalized world. Potatoes had a single region of origin; how they moved from place to place has affected the variety of tubers and the people and places that received them. Reader's book aims to contextualize the potato in world history. Reader presents the information and ideas in The Propitious Esculent building on the work of two important scholars: Redcliffe N. Salaman and William H. McNeill. In 1949 Salaman wrote a book, The History and Social Influence of the Potato. After publishing the very influential The Rise of the West (1963) and Plagues and Peoples (1976), McNeill published an essay called, “How the Potato Changed the World’s History” in 1999. Reader describes their contributions to the understandings of the development and role of the potato in the modern world. He then combines their publications with newly available information from the world of genetics and late 20th century history for a more complete understanding of the potato as a player on the world stage. Synopsis Reader divides his exploration of the potato into three sections: South America, Europe, The World. =South America= The first section describes the environments, The Andes Mountains and the altiplano, in which the potato developed. In the past, at least 3,000 years ago, people living in these environments began to take advantage of a naturally occurring plant. Over time human interaction developed a flowering plant with a nutritionally valuable, and good tasting, tuber that then became an important component of the human diet. Reader spends several pages describing the way in which the Spanish set up colonies and an empire in South America to mine mineral resources and exploit available manpower. He lays out the time line of events and shows that it took several decades for the value of the potato to become obvious to any of the Europeans. Interspersed in this discussion, Reader describes current conditions of potato growing through the Andean region. =Europe= In the second section of the book, Reader traces the potato's path across the Atlantic Ocean. The many stops on Atlantic islands gave the plant time to adjust to different environments and day lengths. Reader devotes many pages to the process of determining who had the potato first and where they were growing it and for what scale of consumption. This seems like a Western concern rooted in basic competition. However, tracing this particular time line illustrates commodity chains, economic development, culture change (including scientific theory and method), and biological change. In Europe, the potato was not immediately well received. Reader discusses how it was accused of causing leprosy or other ailments and then how cultural groups’ perception of the potato flipped and it became something entirely healthful. The potato also is at the center of demographic and cultural change and this is most clear in the case of Ireland. Reader's explanation of what happened during the great European Potato Failure of 1845 to 1850 discusses the biosocial and biopolitical processes of the period. The Propitious Esculent proposes that the fate of Ireland was not solely the fault of a fungus but the result of a chain of governmental decisions that were set into motion because of the properties of the potato. =Worldwide= In the final portion of the book, Reader outlines the worldwide spread of the potato and how people around the globe have set out to study the potato to protect its genetic health. The potato spread successfully in part due to the lessons learned after Great Famine of Ireland in which biologists and farmers created methods to prevent fungus induced blight. The second point, protecting genetic health, is especially important since such a large part of the global population is dependent on the potato for a stable diet. Since there has been such a long period of human intervention in the development of the potato, it has genetic properties that have become rare as well as weaknesses in the genetic code that lead to defects in different parts of the plant. Pooling global knowledge and resources, biologists, ecologists, and anthropologists at the International Potato Center are securing the varieties of the potato.

Competition categories may include talent, interview, sportswear, casual wear, swim wear, western wear, theme wear, outfit of choice, decade wear, and evening wear. Depending on the type of pageant system (glitz or natural), contestants may be found wearing anything from makeup to fake teeth, known as flippers, as well as elaborate hairstyles and custom- designed fitted outfits to present their routines on stage. History Beauty pageants started in 1921 when the owner of an Atlantic City hotel struck upon the idea to help boost tourism.Pageant Center . Pageant Center 2008. 13-10-2008 However, that idea had already circulated through \\"Most Beautiful Child\\" contests held in major cities across the country. The Little Miss America pageant began in the 1960s at Palisades Amusement Park in New Jersey. Originally, it was for young people from 13 to 17 years old, but by 1964 there were over 35,000 participants, which prompted an age division.Gargiulo, Vince. Palisades Amusement Park: A Century of Fond Memories. Lulu.com, 2006. The modern child beauty pageant emerged in the early 1960s, held in Miami, Florida. Since then, the industry has grown to include about 250,000 pageants. It is an increasingly lucrative business, bringing in about twenty billion dollars a year to the Americas with its popularity spreading worldwide. It has grown from the senior beauty pageants, previously originating from South America, in particular in Venezuela, to become an event held throughout the world for young boys and girls, with an emphasis on competitions being popularized by mainstream media in the United States, to much criticism. The murder of JonBenét Ramsey in late 1996 turned the public spotlight onto child beauty pageants. Critics began to question the ethics of parents who would present their child in a way that was perhaps not suitable for their age. In 2001, American Network HBO aired its Emmy-winning Living Dolls: The Making of a Child Beauty Queen, which garnered much attention. Additionally, TLC, also an American network, has created shows such as Toddlers & Tiaras and King of the Crown, the former dedicated to the world of high glitz child pageantry and the latter to the world of pageant coaching.  Types  While most beauty pageants cater strictly to girls, there are a growing number that include boys as well. Often, age divisions for boys run through age 6 with very few going beyond that due to lack of participation and public perception. Age divisions will often have names such as \\"Baby Miss\\", \\"Petite Miss\\", \\"Little Miss\\" and more. Age divisions are generally broken as follows: 0–11 months, 12–23 months, 1–3 years, 4–6 years, 7–9 years, 10–12 years, 13–15 years, and 16–18 years. For boys, sometimes two age divisions would be merged such as 0–3 years, 4–6 years, etc. Depending on which type of pageant system is entered, contestants will spend about two hours or less in the actual competition. Typically, pageants have a guideline of \\"no more than one and a half minutes on stage\\" per child for beauty or formalwear and other modeling-based events. Talent usually is limited to two minutes or less with the rare exception allowing two and a half to three minutes. In glitz pageants, it is expected that girls will have different \\"routines\\" for every segment of competition. Routines are composed of different movements sometimes described as \\"sassy walk\\" and \\"pretty feet\\" and more. Facial expressions can include liberal amounts of \\"duckface\\". This style of modelling is often referred to as \\"pro-am modeling\\". Big hair (including fake hair), flawless makeup, spray tans, flippers (fake teeth), and nail extensions are also expected of contestants. Glitz pageants may best be described as \\"anything goes\\". In contrast, natural pageants have fairly strict guidelines regarding clothing, makeup, hair extensions, etc. Programs such as National American Miss forbid any makeup other than non-shiny lipgloss and mascara for girls on stage. This modeling style is often referred to as \\"Miss America-style\\". Some pageants have a prescribed set of movements while others allow a little more latitude in how girls will use the stage or runway. All pageants have slightly different guidelines, rules, and criteria for what they judge on, and events. Events may include sportswear, swimwear, evening wear, talent, interview, writing skills, and modeling.Cromie, Willian J. The Whys and Woes of Beauty Pageants. 8 June 2000. Harvard University Gazette. Retrieved 13 October 2008. Children are critiqued on “individuality, capability, poise, and confidence.”Nussbaum, Kareen. Children and Beauty Pageants. A Minor Consideration. 2008. Retrieved 13 October 2008 They compete to win a variety of prizes, such as electronics, toys, scholarships and grants, cash, tiaras, sashes, robes, and trophies.Our Little Miss. 2008. Retrieved 13 October 2008. Trophies can be taller than the contestants themselves; in the “Our Little Miss” pageant, the World level trophies can be 5 to 6 feet tall. Some pageants do their best to make every child feel like a winner. There is a queen for every age division, and there are Ultimate Grand Supreme awards, and Mini Supreme queens for certain blocks of age divisions (0–5, 6–11, 12–16, 17 and up). There are also side awards and overall side awards. A rising trend in pageantry is the online, specialty or mail-in pageant. Social media sites like Facebook have many photo contest and pageant pages where contestant's photos are judged by how many \\"likes\\" they receive. There is a website devoted to this type of pageant program. Unlike the live or on-stage counterparts, contestants in an online pageant submit an application and photographs or videos for judging. Judging criteria can include past pageant achievements, numeric scale ratings and essays. Winners may be awarded virtual prizes such downloadable certificates and being featured on a pageant's website or physical prizes and gifts such as tiaras, sashes, medallions, toys and more. Entry fees typically range from $5 to $80 depending on the type, level and scope (local/state/national/international). Many are seasonal or theme-based.See here for an example. Others may be a counterpart to a live or on-stage event. Some pageants are created to generate profit for the business venture while others are run as non-profit organizations. Typically, non-profits have low entry fees and sponsor a charity or other humanitarian organization. =Cost= The average cost of a pageant depends on a few factors such as whether the pageant is glitz or natural, if the pageant is a local, state or national pageant, the pageant's distance from the contestants' home, and costuming requirements. Entry fees can range from free to many hundreds of dollars. Additionally, optional events or side awards may be offered for an upcharge as well. Many pageants offer a \\"Supreme\\" title which can include hundreds to thousands of dollars in cash or savings bonds as an added incentive to enter every category. Typically, Supreme titles are only available to those who enter a certain number of optional events. Many pageants are held in hotels and require contestants to stay on-site for at least one day or more due to the pageant schedule. Hotel rooms for pageants generally range from $99–179/night depending on where the hotel is located. In a glitz pageant, makeup and hair are typically done by a professional makeup artist.Prodis, Julia. CHILD PAGEANTS' WORLD A BLUR OF CROWNS, GOWNS : EXPERIENCE CAN BE HEALTHY, PARENTS SAY. AP: Daily News 1997. Retrieved 2-12-2008. Natural pageants do not generally require a professional makeup artist or hair dresser although some girls choose to use them in the older age divisions. Dresses and themed costumes can cost from $50 to $8000, depending on the designer, the amount of adornment on the garment and whether the gown was rented, purchased used or purchased new. Many pageant moms pride themselves on making most of their child's pageant wardrobe as a cost-saving measure. Additionally, some parents hire pageant coaches to teach their child professionally choreographed routines and/or work with them on interview questions/answers. Regardless of pageant style, glitz or natural, it can be beneficial to have an unbiased opinion on interview and clothing choices. It is estimated that the attire and props as they relate to costs of putting a child through a beauty pageant can range from $300 and upward of $5000 depending on the level of competition. Parents have confessed to spending over $30,000 on pageants for their small children on TLC's show Toddlers & Tiaras. There have even been cases of families going into debt or losing their homes because of overextending family resources to cover the costs that the pageants required. To defray the cost of competing, contestants may sell sponsor tickets or advertising pages for ad books in addition to having local businesses, friends and family sponsor them with donations. Sponsor tickets can range in price from $1 to $10 and are entered in raffle drawings for cash prizes. Criticism Parents are sometimes criticized for entering their children in pageants. By holding very young girls to a \\"beauty\\" standard involving things such as makeup and spray tans, pageants are seen as reinforcing a very superficial, modern type of femininity. One sociologist, Shelby Colene Pannell, questions why parents would willingly subject their children to gender socialization in such an extreme form.Pannell, S. C. (2007). Mothers and Daughters: The Creation and Contestation of Beauty and Femininity. Vanderbilt University .ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. 325. Retrieved from /record=b1261238~S0. Families on TLC’s television series Toddlers & Tiaras are subject to intense criticism for negatively influencing their children that their physical appearance will score them attention and prizes. The show first aired in 2009 and follows the child participants and their parents as they prepare for the upcoming beauty pageant of the weekend. The show is non-narrated to avoid showing opinion and has sparked heavy controversy due to actions including allowing a child to smoke a fake cigarette during the talent portion of the competition, forcing a child to wear fake breasts, a parent who allowed her child to dress like a prostitute in the “outfit of choice” category, and waxing/threading a child’s facial and body hair to give them a glowing appearance on stage. =Eating disorders= Children who compete in pageants are often in the public spotlight. It is their job to cooperate and look pretty, and they are taught that being past a certain weight isn't considered attractive. For this reason, many young people in the pageant world may develop eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa. They purposely starve themselves in order to stay at the \\"appropriate\\" weight in order to win. Many times glam beauty pageants require young girls to wear tightly fitted dresses, so extra stress is put on young girls to stay thin.Wonderlich, A., Ackard, D., & Henderson, J. (2005). \\"Childhood Beauty Pageant Contestants: Associations with Adult Disordered Eating and Mental Health\\". Eating Disorders, 13(3), 291-301. doi:10.1080/10640260590932896  Study of 2005  In a study published in 2005, eleven women who had competed in beauty pageants as children were compared with a control group of eleven women who had not competed. They were compared in different areas, such as BMI, age and overall body satisfaction. In general, this limited study found that those who competed in beauty pageants as children were more dissatisfied with their bodies, and had greater impulse dysregulation and trust issues than those who did not participate, but showed no significant differences in measures of bulimia nervosa, body perception, depression, or self-esteem. The authors acknowledged their small sample size reduced the conclusiveness of their study.Wonderlich, Anna, Diann Ackard, Judith Henderson. “Childhood Beauty Pageant Contestants: Associations with Adult Disordered Eating and Mental Health.” Eating Disorders 13 (2005) : 291-301 =Commodification of children= Some critics of child beauty pageants say the pageants promote children as products used for the benefit of commercial gain. Some describe it as a deal. Parents spend money on clothing, hair, makeup, and accessories in return for a cash prize.Wolfe, L. (2012). \\"Darling Divas or Damaged Daughters? The Dark Side of Child Beauty Pageants and an Administrative Law Solution\\". Tulane Law Review, 87(2), 427-455. =Sexualization= In preparation for these beauty pageants, children have their appearances altered by costumes, makeup, and other products which can objectify them at a very young age. Certain pageants encourage contestants to emulate grown women, applying heavy makeup to create full lips, long eyelashes, and flushed cheeks, wearing high heels and revealing \\"evening gowns\\", and doing provocative dance steps, poses or facial expressions. These things are not only preferred but expected if a child is to win the contest. The children participating in beauty contests may learn that they gain attention and status when being sexualized. The child perceives that sexuality is not only encouraged but can be a means to an end. This behavior can eventually lead to premature sexual activity and can teach an unfortunate lesson that a woman's worth is determined by their status as a sex object. \\"When you have them looking older, for a lot of people that means looking sexier. I don't think it's a great idea for girls at that age to be focused so much on their sexuality,\\" Syd Brown, a youth psychologist practicing in Maryland told ABC News. \\"If you're telling a 6-year-old to act like a 16-year-old, you're telling her to be seductive and to be sexy.\\" =Defense= Regardless of the criticism, parents still defend their reasons for letting their young children participate in these pageants. Hillary Levy, an undergraduate researcher at Harvard University, found that many parents felt that their children, even males, were able to gain poise and confidence in front of a group. Parents of children with birth defects felt as though it was not a negative experience but instead a way for their children to interact with others and not feel as if they were different.Cromie, William. \\"The Whys and Woes of Beauty Pageants\\". Harvard University Gazette (2000): n. pag. Web. . There are many parents who believe that beauty pageants teach their children to always perform their very best and boost their self-esteem. One mother of a two-year-old participant on Toddlers & Tiaras claimed “‘It’s just building that confidence early so she doesn’t have to hide away and she can achieve things she wants to achieve without being shy.\\" She believes that gaining this self-confidence at a young age will benefit her child in the long run by helping her open up to people more easily and rid her of her shyness. \\"I was always involved in the baseball, the football, the basketball, the dance and now my kids are grown,\\" said parent Joy Clark. \\"To me this is the same thing, it's a sport we travel to. We teach her, she practices, and you win prizes. It's just the same. It's just a sport.\\" These parents believe that a pageant should not be viewed as anything other than another extra-curricular activity because it teaches children basic life values such as self-confidence, sportsmanship, determination, and leadership that any other sport or activity outside of school would do, and what matters is if a child is raised in a healthy environment surrounded by good people and good morals. Law Besides the laws that regulate child education, pageants are a relatively ungoverned program. Child contestants are not considered \\"working\\", so pageants are exempt from federal child labor laws. Pageants also have different rules, so it becomes hard to set a law that will cover every pageant. Lindsay Lieberman, the author of “Protecting Pageant Princesses: A Call for Statutory Regulation of Child Beauty Pageants”, argues that there should be regulations on how child beauty pageants are run because the effects on children can be negative and damaging. In her article, Lieberman touches upon points that concern the lifestyles that children who compete in pageants have going on while competing such as stress and anxiety as well as problems they will have later on in the future such as depression, lowered self-esteem, and battling eating disorders.Lieberman, Lindsay. \\"Protecting Pageant Princesses: A Call for Statutory Regulation of Child Beauty Pageants\\". Journal of Law and Policy 18.2 (2010): 739-74. Hein Online. Web. 21 October 2012. In 2013, France banned pageants for children under age of 13 years, on the grounds that they promote the \\"hyper-sexualisation\\" of minors. France also voted to regulate pageants for children aged 13–15. France is the first western country to ban child pageants.https://www.thelocal.fr/20140127/beauty-contests-ban-france-mini- miss-pageants https://frenchly.us/miss-france-hypocrisy-french-politicians- pageants/ See also * TLC's reality series Toddlers & Tiaras * Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, reality television series (TLC, 2012–2014) * Child model ReferencesExternal links * Child beauty pageant statistics * I'M the Baby!—Learn about the baby & kid contests.

Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 1st edition Lords of Darkness is a collection of ten mini-scenarios set in the Forgotten Realms, all featuring undead monsters such as skeletons, ghouls, wights, shadows, mummies, vampires, and ghosts; the book also includes suggestions on how to role-play undead and a section called \\"A Mundane Guide to Wards vs. Undead, Spirits, and Other Entities\\". The anthology includes adventures and background information dealing with most of the undead monsters commonly encountered in the AD&D; game, and although sold as a Forgotten Realms accessory, it is usable with any AD&D; campaign. The book's purpose is to provide short adventures involving undead that can be easily inserted into a campaign. Each of the featured undead has background information provided in the form of either a short piece of fiction describing the undead in action or delivered as a monologue by a knowledgeable non-player character (NPC). New game rules in the book contain additional information and clarify existing game mechanics. The book begins by discussing ways in which undead creatures' energy-draining attacks can be made less devastating to a player character (PC) by using alternatives to the usual level-draining effect. The adventures in Lords of Darkness are designed to be easily dropped into an ongoing campaign, and are mainly dungeon crawls of one form or another. The book introduces the optional rules on Horror Checks, which are made when characters realize just how horrible a monster really is; long-term effects can result from failed checks. Another section discusses the effects that items and substances such as cold iron, garlic, salt, and mirrors have against undead. Also included are new spells for magic-users who choose to specialize in the necromantic arts. The book features a two-page introduction by Ed Greenwood. It explains that, while the book is set in the Forgotten Realms setting, it can be used in different fantasy campaign settings. The introduction gives details on undead in the Forgotten Realms, advice for a Dungeon Master (DM) to use undead in a campaign, alternatives to some of the more deadly powers of the undead, and information on non-evil types of undead. \\"Tales From Beyond the Grave\\" (pages 4–75) presents ten complete adventure scenarios, each one highlighting a \\"classic\\" undead type, with the challenges increasing from one scenario to the next. Creature notes accompany each adventure. The scenarios are from five to nine pages each, and include the following: \\"Skeletons\\", by Deborah Christian; \\"Zombies\\", by Michael Stackpole; \\"Ghouls and Ghasts\\", by Paul Jaquays; \\"The Tombs of Deckon Thar\\", by Steve Perrin; \\"Shadows\\", by Christian; \\"Mummies\\", by Jaquays; \\"Vampires\\", by Vince Garcia and Jean Rabe; \\"Ghosts\\", by Garcia; \\"Oriental Spectres\\", by Christian; and \\"The Dread Lair of Alokkair\\", by Greenwood. \\"The Night Gallery\\" (pages 75–84) details the main character or creature of each adventure and can be used to plan a series of encounters. \\"A Mundane Guide to Wards\\", by Greenwood (pages 85–91), explores the magic and lore of dealing with undead. \\"The Lords of Darkness\\", by Greenwood (pages 92–96), presents new spells for necromancers. Cover art for Lords of Darkness was done by Jeff Easley and interior art by Karl Waller, and the book was published by TSR in 1988 as a ninety-six page book. Editing was by Scott Martin Bowles, and cartography by Dave LaForce. This supplement was perfect bound, and released for the first edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons with product code TSR 9240. Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition The second Lords of Darkness was released for the third edition of Dungeons & Dragons. The book was published in 2001, and was written by Jason Carl and Sean K. Reynolds. Cover art was by Mark Zug, with interior art by Adam Rex, Anthony Francisco, Matt Cavotta, Carl Critchlow, Michael Dubisch, Mike Dutton, Raven Mimura, Puddnhead, Stephanie Pui-Mun Law, Richard Sardinha, and Kalman Andrasofszky. The 192 page accessory details twenty-eight villainous groups, contains maps of evil strongholds, and includes new spells, feats, and magic items. The book presents five prestige classes: Darkmask, Entropist, Spur Lord, Thayan Knight, and Zhentarim Skymage. Monsters such as the Daemonfey appear in this book. Reception The original Lords of Darkness was a Gamer's Choice award-winner. Jim Bambra reviewed Lords of Darkness for Dragon magazine No. 151 (November 1989). Bambra felt that the style of presentation for the fictional pieces describing the undead in action \\"is far superior to the dry style adopted by many supplement writers\\". He noted that four of the adventures lack maps, reducing their usefulness as plug-in scenarios, and that two adventures \\"are set in castles that cry out for at least schematic diagrams to show their layouts\\". Bambra felt that the quality of the adventures also varies greatly, and that while most are \\"fairly good\\", he continued \\"[a] few are so thin and underdeveloped that I wondered why they were included\\". He contended that the adventure dealing with zombies is \\"the worst of the lot\\", partly because the characters would be facing \\"opponents who are likely to stomp them into the ground\\", but called the mummies' tomb and the lich's lair \\"fine examples of the dungeon designer's art\\". He called the optional Horror Check rules \\"a laudable attempt to instill fear of the undead but not sufficiently developed to be effective\\", because \\"the system isn't integrated into the AD&D; rules in a satisfactory manner, as characters will deteriorate to the stage where they are unable to function effectively—a situation contrary to the spirit of the game and more in keeping with the grim tone of Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu game\\". Bambra said the accessory \\"expands greatly on the background of undead in the AD&D; game and provides a source of short adventure settings.\\" He also said it was a good resource in terms of \\"new necromantic spells\\" and \\"information on the ecologies of the undead\\", but concluded: \\"its lack of maps and the underdevelopment of some of its adventures make it a merely useful rather than essential item.\\" References *Greenwood, Ed, Deborah Christian, Michael Stackpole, Paul Jaquays, Steve Perrin, Vince Garcia, and Jean Rabe.

Kajū-ji, known familiarly as \\"Kikki-san,\\"Hierba flotante: Kajū-ji in Spanish. was founded by Emperor Daigo. This site is said to have been chosen because the mother of the emperor had lived a significant part of her life in this place; and after her death, the temple was established in her memory. The temple was destroyed in 1470 during the Onin War and then later restored by the Tokugawa family and the Imperial Household. Successive head priests have been drawn directly from the Imperial family. Mito Mitsukuni (popularly known as Mito Komon) is said to have donated the stone lantern in front of the Shoin. =Monzeki= Japanese Buddhist priests of aristocratic or imperial lineage were more particularly identified as . The term was also applied to the temples and monastic communities in which they were joined; and Kajū-ji was a monzeki temple. Beginning in 942, imperial princes lived as monks at Kajū-ji. The eldest son of head of the Fushimi-no-miya branches of the imperial family was adopted at age two in 1818 by former-Emperor Kōkaku. Akira-shinnō entered the priesthood under the title Siahn Hoshinnō and later became prince-abbot of Kajū-ji.Miyake: Yamashino-no-miya In 1842, he angered the Tokugawa bakufu, which stripped him of his post and confined him to the temple of To-ji. In 1858, Emperor Komei adopted Akira and granted him the title Yamashina-no-miya. In 1864, the bakufu reinstated him. Garden and pond Kajū-ji is renowned for its gardens and its water-lily pond. The garden would originally have been used for boating and poem-writing parties, but today one can still stroll through the site. The large pond here, also known as hamuro-no-ike is the main feature of this garden. This water-garden is known for its lotus, water lilies and irises. The temple pond was probably at one time the main element of a much larger pond and hill garden on the estate of Miyamichi Iemasu, a member of the Heian aristocracy and connected through marriage to the powerful Fujiwara family. One famous old plum tree transplanted from the Imperial Palace in Edo Period can be viewed year round, but it is said to be best in February. Art A tapestry image of the preaching Shaka-Nyorai (an alternate name for the founder of Buddhism) has been passed down within the temple over the centuries.

By reversing the flow of refrigerant, the heat pump refrigeration cycle is changed from cooling to heating or vice versa. This allows a residence or facility to be heated and cooled by a single piece of equipment, by the same means, and with the same hardware.What is a Reversing Valve Operation The reversing valve has two states, relaxed (unactivated) versus energized. The energized state is typically achieved by applying 24 volts AC, which is commonly used in HVAC equipment. The heat pump can be designed by the manufacturer to produce either cooling or heating with the reversing valve in the relaxed state. When the reversing valve is energized, it will produce the opposite transfer of heat from its relaxed state. For example, a reversing valve installed in such a way as to produce cooling when relaxed will produce heating when energized. Likewise, a reversing valve installed to produce heating when relaxed will produce cooling when energized. Control Depending on the construction and use of the heat pump, the reversing valve may be driven by the heat pump through the use of a defrost control board, or it may be driven directly by a thermostat (typically from the \\"O\\" terminal of the thermostat). Replacement Reversing valves are built into the heat pump by the manufacturer, and must be replaced by an HVAC technician if they fail. Since the valve is an integral part of the sealed refrigerant circuit, proper procedures for recovering and then later refilling the refrigerant must be followed, to prevent its loss into the atmosphere.

It is a single-stage missile that was developed after the Kargil War to fill the gap between the range of the Prithvi-II missile and the range of the Agni-II. It was first launched from a road mobile launcher at Integrated Test Range (ITR), Wheeler Island, on 25 January 2002. Less than 75 launchers are deployed. History and development Agni-I was first tested at the Interim Test Range in Chandipur in 1989, and is capable of carrying a conventional payload of 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) or a nuclear warhead. Agni missiles consist of one (short range) or two stages (intermediate range). These are rail and road mobile and powered by solid propellants. The Agni I has a range of 700–1,200 km. They are claimed to be a part of the \\"Minimum credible deterrence\\". Agni-I is a single stage, solid fuel, road and rail mobile, Short-range ballistic missile (SRBM). The need for the Agni-I was felt after the Kargil war with Pakistan. It took DRDO 15 months to develop the Agni-I after having completed Agni-II development. It is propelled by solid fuel. Maneuvering RV body-lift aerodynamics give it the ability to correct trajectory errors and reduce thermal stresses. The MRV has a velocity correction package to correct launch trajectory variances. Some Agni RV versions use a set of solid fueled thruster cartridges of predetermined impulse, allowing the onboard guidance controller to trim velocity, using discrete combination of impulse quanta along the desired spatial orientation. The 15 metre tall Agni-I missile, weighing about 12 tonnes, is capable of carrying both conventional as well as nuclear warheads of 1,000 kg. DRDO is now developing an upgraded two stage variant called Agni-1P by borrowing the newer technologies from Agni-IV and Agni-V platform to increase accuracy and reliability.

The tests are normally conducted by the Strategic Forces Command (SFC) of the Indian Army with logistic support from Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). Such User trials were carried out multiple times since 2007, with the first one being in October 5, 2007 from Wheelers' Island and the latest one being on November 27, 2015.http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/agni-i-nuclear-capable-missile-test- fired-successfully-in-odisha/1/532763.html Another successful user trial was conducted on March 14, 2016 from launch pad-4 of the Integrated Test Range (ITR) at Abdul Kalam Island.

Referring to the figure, the 50 finite ordinary double points are arrayed as the vertices of 20 roughly tetrahedral shapes oriented such that the bases of these four-sided \\"outward pointing\\" shapes form the triangular faces of a regular icosidodecahedron. To these 30 icosidodecahedral vertices are added the summit vertices of the 20 tetrahedral shapes. These 20 points themselves are the vertices of a concentric regular dodecahedron circumscribed about the inner icosidodecahedron. Together, these are the 50 finite ordinary double points of the figure. The 15 remaining ordinary double points at infinity correspond to the 15 lines that pass through the opposite vertices of the inscribed icosidodecahedron, all 15 of which also intersect in the center of the figure. .

He retired from The Washington Post in early 2014 after a career of more than 50 years on the paper. During his career he served as managing editor (1991–98) and associate editor and senior correspondent (1998-2014). He is the author or co- author of eight books. After retiring he wrote a much-discussed article for the Post explaining his decision to move away from Washington after living there for most of 70 years. Career Kaiser began at The Washington Post as a summer intern while still a college student. He has served as a special correspondent in London (1964–67), a reporter on the city desk in Washington, D.C. (1967–69), foreign correspondent in Saigon (1969–70) and Moscow (1971–74). He returned to the national staff in Washington and worked as a reporter for seven years, covering labor, the U.S. Senate, the 1980 presidential campaign and the first Ronald Reagan administration. In 1982 Kaiser became associate editor of The Washington Post and editor of \\"Outlook\\", a Sunday section of commentary and opinion. He also wrote a column for the section. From 1985 to 1990 he was assistant managing editor for national news, in charge of the paper's coverage of politics and the federal government. From 1990 to 1991 he was deputy managing editor, and from 1991 to 1998 served as the paper's managing editor. In 2007, he wrote a series of articles there based on interviews of lobbyist Gerald Cassidy on the topic of lobbying in the United States.Robert G. Kaiser; Alice Crites (research contributor) (2007). \\"Citizen K Street: How lobbying became Washington's biggest business -- Big money creates a new capital city. As lobbying booms, Washington and politics are transformed\\" . Washington Post. Retrieved 2012-01-13. Later he published a book on lobbying, So Damn Much Money, based in part on Cassidy's career. From late 2008 through 2009, Kaiser followed Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA) and Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) as they wrote and passed the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Both men and their staffs allowed Kaiser an inside view of the legislative process. Kaiser's 2013 book, Act of Congress: How America's Essential Institution Works, and How It Doesn't, was based on this unusual access. Kaiser's work has appeared in the New York Review of Books, Esquire, Foreign Affairs, and many other publications. He has been a commentator on NPR's All Things Considered, and has appeared often on Meet the Press, the Today show and other television programs. Kaiser also was a digital visionary, at least in the newspaper world. In 1992, he wrote a prescient memo about the digital threats and opportunities newspapers would face in the future. The memo http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/essays/badnews/kaiser_memo.pdf led to the Post's early investment in creating a separate digital subsidiary, which launched the Post's Digital Ink product in 1994, followed soon after by washingtonpost.com. Bibliography Kaiser is the author of numerous books: *Cold Winter, Cold War, (1974). *Russia, The People and the Power, (1976). *Great American Dreams, (with Jon Lowell, 1978). *Russia from the Inside, (with Hannah Jopling Kaiser, 1980). *Why Gorbachev Happened, (1991) * The Geography of Nationalism in Russia and the USSR., (1994). *The News About the News: American Journalism in Peril , (with Leonard Downie, Jr., 2002). *So Damn Much Money: The Triumph of Lobbying and the Corrosion of American Government (2009). *Act of Congress: How America's Essential Institution Works, and How It Doesn't (2013).

Governing body The governing body of football in Ecuador is the Ecuadorian Football Federation (), also known as FEF or Ecuafútbol. It runs all national football tournaments and manages the national football teams. Its seat is in Guayaquil. In addition, there are 18 provincial association throughout the country. Club football Club football is the most popular spectator sport in the country. The top-flight league in the country is the Serie A, followed by the Serie B. Both contain a small number of clubs compared to other leagues across the continent (12 each). Both tournaments are organized by FEF. But, for a considerable part of its history, club football was regionalized. =Regional leagues= The first amateur tournaments in Ecuador were organized by two regional leagues: one in Guayas for clubs in Guayaquil, and one in Pichincha for clubs in Quito and Ambato. Both held their inaugural tournaments in 1922. Both leagues stayed amateur until 1952, when the Guayas league held their first professional tournament. The Pichincha league, called Interandino followed suit in 1954. Both leagues stayed as the top-flight leagues in the country until 1967, when the status of top-flight was ceded to the national tournament. =National tournament= No national tournament existed until 1957 when the winners of both regional championships played against each other for the title. The first national title was won by Emelec. After a two year hiatus, the national tournament returned in 1960 and has continued into the present. The Costa and Interandino Championships ceased to exist as a top- level tournament in 1967. =International participation= While typically a competitive country, clubs from Ecuador have had little international success. The first club to reach the finals of an international tournament was Barcelona, when they reached the finals of the 1990 and 1998 Copa Libertadores; they lost both. In 2001, Emelec became the second club to reach the finals of an international tournament at the 2001 Copa Merconorte, which they also lost. In 2008, LDU Quito became the first club to win an international title by becoming the 2008 Copa Libertadores champion. LDU Quito also went to win the Recopa Sudamericana and the Copa Sudamericana, both in 2009. To date, those are the only international club titles won by an Ecuadorian team. National team The Ecuadorian national football team is controlled by the Federación Ecuatoriana de Fútbol and represents Ecuador in international football competitions. It was for a long time one of the weaker teams in CONMEBOL, but it has recently had more success, making their first World Cup qualification in 2002, and qualifying again for the 2006 World Cup in which they made it to the last 16, losing to England by 1 goal. Although without any major tournament achievements until the current millennium, Ecuador was never short of footballing talent, producing players such as Alberto Spencer, Jose Villafuerte, Carlos Raffo and Antonio Valencia. Ecuador has qualified for the World Cup twice in 2002 and 2006 but it has yet to win a Copa América. Their best finish in Copa América was fourth in 1993 (they also finished fourth in the 'extra' South American Championship in 1959).

Exit rate as a financial term refers to the revenue or cost to be expected in the following fiscal period as a derivative of the performance in the current period. When used in the context of revenue, exit rate refers to the income expected in following periods as a result of sales closed in the existing period. If a company worked throughout the year and signed deals that will generate a million dollars a year in following years, then the company has a one million dollar per year exit rate in this year. When used in the context of costs, exit rate refers to the costs expected in following periods as a result of recurring costs taken on during the existing period.

It is also known as a \\"sinecal quadrant\\" in the English-speaking world. The instrument could be used to measure celestial angles, to tell time, to find directions, or to determine the apparent positions of any celestial object for any time. The name is derived from the Arabic \\"rub‘‘‘\\" meaning a quarter and \\"mujayyab\\" meaning marked with sine.http://cosmolabe.tripod.com/id1.html It was described, according to King, by Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī in 9th century Baghdad.David A. King, \\"Islamic Astronomy\\", in Christopher Walker (1999), ed., Astronomy before the telescope, p. 167-168. British Museum Press. . Description Using the Sinecal Quadrant to measure the altitude of a celestial object. Note the index finger of the left hand ready to pin the cord to the quadrant as soon as the star sight is perfected. Reading the scale after taking the celestial altitude. Taking the altitude of the Sun with the Sinecal Quadrant. Note shadow of sight vane with dot of sunlight on index finger of observer. The instrument is a quarter of a circle made of wood or metal (usually brass) divided on its arc side into 90 equal parts or degrees. The 90 divisions are gathered in 18 groups of five degrees each and are generally numbered both ways from the ends of the arc. That is, one set of numbers begins at the left end of the arc and goes to 90 at the right end while the other set the zero is at the right and the 90 is at the left. This double numbering enables the instrument to measure either celestial altitude or zenith distance or both simultaneously. At the apex where the two graduated straight sides of the grid pattern meet in a right angle there is a pin hole with a cord in it and a small weight on the free end with a small bead that slides along the cord. The cord is called “Khait” and is used as a plumb line when measuring celestial altitudes. It is also used as the indicator of angles when doing calculations with the instrument. The sliding bead facilitates trigonometric calculations with the instrument. Traditionally the line from the beginning of the arc to the apex is called “Jaibs” and the line from the end of the arc to the apex is called “Jaib tamams”. Both jaibs and jaib tamams are divided into 60 equal units and the sixty parallel lines to the jaibs are called sitheeniys or” sixtys “ and the sixty parallel lines to the jaib tamams are “juyoobul mabsootah”. The reason for sixty divisions along the Jaibs and Jaib Tamams is that the instrument uses the Sexagesimal number system. That is it is graduated to the number base 60 and not to the base 10 or decimal system that we presently use. Time, angular measurement and geographical coordinate measurements are about the only hold overs from the Sumerian/Babylonian number system that are still in current use. Like the arc, the Jaibs and Jaib tamams have their sixty divisions gathered into groups of five that are numbered in both directions to and from the apex. The double numbering of the arc means that the “Jaibs” and “Jaib tamams” labels are relative to the measurement being taken or to the calculation being performed at the time and the terms are not attached to one or the other of the graduated scales on the instrument. Measuring a celestial altitude with the quadrant On one of the straight edges of the non maritime quadrant (solid sheet form) there are two sighting plates which are called “Hadafatani”. Each of the alignment plates having a small, centrally placed aperture or \\"pinhole\\", the two apertures (front and back) forming the optical axis through which one sights an incline object or Sun. The light rays from the Sun passing through both apertures, the spot image of the Sun being concentric with the center of the rear plate pinhole, imaging on to a finger (project screen) if desired but not necessary or less frequent the eye at night. The hanging plum line serving two functions the first being to provide a means (indicator) to reading the angular orientation of the instrument, the second function ensuring that the instrument when optically aligned with the object of interest is situated parallel with the vertical plane (perpendicular with the ground). It has been stated by non astronomers and non navigators, that two people are required to use the small instrument successfully; one to take the sight and one to read the cord (plum line) position on the radius segment and incorrect presumption as the instrument is to be held flush (face on) and below eye level with a single user, the two holes used for projecting the image of the Sun not direct sighting. As one can see from the photograph, it is easy to optically aligned the instrument with the Sun using simple image projection method, the device held in a single hand. At the moment of alignment, one views the face of the instrument to read the angular position of the cord relative to the radii segment of the instrument. However, it does help to have another person write down the scale readings as they are taken if a single operator is not able to do such because of environmental conditions, the single operator not having the capability to sufficiently hold the device stable, retaining the optical alignment, with just one hand. Making altitude (elevation) measurements of the Sun being simple and direct, requiring the user to aligning the image of the Sun through the front pinhole (aperture), centered onto the rear back plate which operates more like a mask and not a viewing pass hole for sighting the Sun with the naked eye. Much in the same manner as performing eyepiece projection with a telescope, one fashioned with a front and rear aperture (font lens and rear eyepiece) along with a projection screen behind the eyepiece, or more rudimentary, the projecting of the Sun's image upon a small screen plate such as that done with a mariner's back staff. The rear, or second aperture (pass hole) having the function of working as a blacken attenuator so that any reflecting, annulus shaped sunlight off the metal aperture is not too bright, the Sun's image (light) passing through the second hole and similar in task though void of a fixed image plane, to that of an iris (diaphragm) in a camera lens to reduce the light intensity. For relative to human physiology, focusing on a bright spot of light such as a pin point image of the Sun for any extended period or repetitively over a short duration of time adversely effects momentarily, a person's visual acuity, thus making it more challenging to focus one's eyes to read the angular scale. It being typical to orientate the instrument such that the operator faces looking slightly down upon the scale, the Sun at the users left, with right hand placed in such a way that the rays of sunlight pass through the two, perforated sighting plates, forming a bright illuminated spot on the observer's finger (see photo), the finger functioning as a projection screen. At the moment an optical alignment with the Sun is established, the angular value of the device is read by the operator at the point where the graduated scale is bisected by the hanging plumb line. These instruments, with poor angular resolution, not principally intended to function with stars at night, as an astronomical measuring device, since it is impractical to sight a star through the front pin hole (aperture) less on a fixed, stabilized mount relative to the half degree width of the very intense Sun. The maritime (navigation) version of these devices being skeletal in design rather than solid sheet form, so as to limit buffeting or displacement of the instrument while in the operators hand from wind exposure.

Based on his music and business experience, he has developed the JazzCode – a term describing the guiding principles used by jazz musicians in particular and professional teams in general to create a successful performance. The JazzCode applies to small teams having to manage complexity and rapid change. It is also relevant to organizations change cultures in order to adapt to rapidly changing contexts. Stormer has also developed a method to improve how small teams manage complex problems in thinking, reading and writing and his class is used by consultants, analysts, project managers and top teams in several Norwegian companies.  Background  After 11 years in the United States, where he obtained a Bachelor of Music in jazz performance from New England Conservatory (1983), a Master of Music in jazz from Manhattan School of Music (1985), a Master of Fine Arts in arts management from Columbia University (1987) and worked as a professional musician, Stormer returned to Norway in 1991. Back in Oslo, he founded the jazz band The Real Thing in collaboration with guitarist Staffan William- Olsson (b. 1959). They were later joined by Sigurd Køhn (1959–2004) and Paul “Palle” Wagnberg (born 1961). The band soon became one of Norway's most popular and bestselling jazz bands, releasing three albums – The Real Thing (1991), The Real Thing in New York (1992 feat. Lew Soloff), and A Perfect Match (1994).  Musical training  Stormer's first drum teacher was the Norwegian drummer Jon Christensen with whom he studied from 1971 to 1976. While at New England Conservatory he studied with Alan Dawson, Gary Chaffee, Miroslav Vitouš, and George Russell. While at Manhattan School of Music he studied with Justin DiCioccio and Gary Chester.  Music and business  In 1992 the city of Oslo wanted to adopt the French music festival “Fête de la Musique”. Carl Stormer established the festival and was managing director for the first two years. Even in its first year, “Musikkens Dag” gathered thousands of people and artists in the streets of Oslo. In 1995 Stormer left music to pursue a business career with IBM. His fascination for technology (he had previously worked both with programming drums and databases in the United States) soon took him to the Internet, e-business and management consulting. In 1999 he moved back to the US and together with Espen Odegard he co-founded StudentUniverse, an online travel business which in 2008 became a global company. In 2003 Stormer was recruited to become the head of marketing (CMO) at Norwegian Air Shuttle, Scandinavia's largest low-cost carrier. During his tenure he was a core member of the team that took the company [public]in 2004. He left the company in 2004 to start his own business, JazzCode AS is incorporated in Norway (Tax ID # 991-411-917). The JazzCode is being presented to business, academic and jazz audiences in Europe, Australia and the United States. In 2008 Stormer gave several lectures about the JazzCode at Insead (France) and London Business School (UK) and published a case at Harvard Business School (US) with professor Robert D. Austin about the groundbreaking 1959 recording of Miles Davis' Kind of Blue. JazzCode has released several recordings on which Størmer plays the drums, including In the Moment (2007) featuring Rob Scheps, Georg \\"Jojje\\" Wadenius, Cameron Brown and Jamie Reynolds, Codes for Christmas (2008) featuring Rob Scheps, Scott Wendholt, Bruce Barth, and Doug Weiss, Being Here (2011) and Entering the Human Age (2011) featuring Knut Riisnæs, Lars Jansson and Mats Eilertsen, Control is for Beginners (2014) featuring Bendik Hofseth, Lars Jansson, and Mats Eilertsen, and Always Different (2016) featuring Bendik Hofseth, Mike Mainieri, Bruno Raberg, Jørn Øien, and Sidiki Camara  Discography  In his own name: *2007: In the Moment (2007) feat.

In New York City, the STAR Program is a tax exemption for those who applied before Fiscal Year 2015-2016 and a tax credit there after for new applicants. The program, which acts similarly to (but is much less extensive than) homestead exemptions in other states, was enacted on August 7, 1997, a product of the annual budget of then-Governor George Pataki. The STAR Program takes two forms: the Basic STAR and the Enhanced STAR. The Basic STAR is open to the primary residence of any New York State resident and exempts $30,000 from the true value of a home or property. The Enhanced STAR, for eligible senior citizens at or above age 65, exempts an annually variable amount ($65,300 for the 2015-2016 school year) from the true value of their primary residence. Essentially, the program is aimed to lower the tax burden on school district residents. This does not affect the overall revenue of a given school district; the difference is made up by the state, essentially making the program another source of state aid. The STAR rebate is subtracted from the \\"true value\\" of the home in question. The true value of a home is the value determined at the time of the last property assessment (typically done by a town or county assessor), divided by an equalization rate, which is the ratio of assessed value to market value for each taxing jurisdiction, as calculated by the State of New York. Equalization rates are used because assessments are not done each year by town or county officials. In addition, school districts typically do not have the same boundaries as other taxing jurisdictions (cities and towns), so equalization calculations are needed to bring property values to the same levels within all neighboring municipalities, included in a given district. To be eligible for the Enhanced STAR, a primary resident age 65 or older must have an adjusted gross income that does not exceed $86,300. Proof of age is required upon initial application.

The ruins are primarily of the Wari (Huari) culture, which flourished from 350 CE to 1000 CE in the area along the coast and reaching to the highlands. These northern Wari ruins are distinguished from the Wari ruins in the Ayacucho Region to the south. The discovery was announced on 16 December 2008 by the lead archeologist, Cesar Soriano. The ruins both present the first evidence of Wari influence found in Northern Peru and by their quality and extent, show this was an important site. Located from Chiclayo, the ruins stretch over an area of . The Wari pre-Columbian civilization was predominantly based in south-central Peru between the 7th and 12th centuries (600 to 1100 CE.) It was known for having constructed a network of roads, and had an extensive territory. Scholars note its complex, distinctive architecture, monuments and roadbuilding as evidence that it was an empire.Katharine Schreiber, \\"Wari Empire - Excavations at Wari, Ayachucho, Peru\\", JRank, accessed 3 Nov 2010  Discovery  The city was part of the Wari Empire, which ruled parts of the Andes mountains, mostly in south-central Peru, between the 7th and 12th centuries CE. The site is remarkably well preserved due to the dry desert climate. Among the artifacts are pottery shards. The site includes evidence of human sacrifice, with special spots set aside and a pile of bones at the bottom of a cliff. Well-preserved remains have been found of one young woman. The ruins are expected to help scholars fill the gap in knowledge about pre- Columbian South America, which was dominated by the Wari culture and the earlier Moche culture. The Moche began at 100 AD and perished around 600 AD. Earlier in August 2008, archeologists at the Huaca Pucllana ruins in Lima (located some south of Chiclayo) discovered a mummy that is also thought to be Wari. This was a more typical location for such a find, within the territory known to be Wari.

The band name refers to a quote from the Mel Brooks movie Blazing Saddles. Biography Candygram for Mongo was founded in 2005 by drummer Gary Sharp and vocalist and guitarist Tony Shea. The two had been friends for five years when they discovered a mutual interest in music. Sharp and Shea began rehearsing and writing together with the idea of creating a studio project. They enlisted the help of Johnny Dwinell (also known as \\"Johnny D\\"), a producer and musician from Los Angeles by way of Nashville who was impressed with the unique sound of the band and officially joined Candygram For Mongo as the guitarist. The band also recruited Dan Cohen, a top notch studio musician who has played and recorded with many musicians, including members of the Gigolo Aunts, Happy Stars, The Posies, The Rembrandts, and Dogs Eye View, to become the band's permanent bassist despite his background primarily as a guitarist. The band added bassist James Baker in 2008, allowing Cohen to become the group's primary guitarist. Johnny Dwinell left the group shortly after Baker joined. Career The band's first public show was on September 3, 2006 at the Viper Room in Los Angeles. Candygram For Mongo's first record release was entitled “The Red Pill”. Though the term “The Red Pill” is often associated with the films in the Matrix series, the band stated that the album title is a coincidence based upon an inside joke and has nothing to do with the popular film series. In popular culture The band's music has been used on Battlestar Galactica, which aired on the NBC-owned Sci- Fi Channel. Their music was also used on Unhitched, the 2008 comedy television show produced by the Farrelly Brothers. The band members appeared as extras on Unhitched in March 2008. Live performance The band has performed at world- famous venues including the Viper Room, House of Blues, The Key Club, The Derby, Cat Club and the Mint. Beyond the band's growing reputation as a live act and the national exposure from television placements, they have won a variety of numerous online competitions. The band's song “Happy” was on the Garageband.com charts for more than six months. As a result, “Happy”, was accepted into Clear Channel’s Discover New Music Program and consequently featured on 400 Clear Channel FM Radio Station Websites.

The broadcast has been presented since its inception by Hagen von Ortloff.  History  The series began on 7 April 1991 on SDR as a filler between programmes on their third channel, Südwest 3. Although the first broadcast was especially for railway fans, it was so well received by the public that the programme length was increased from half an hour to 45 minutes.

The church is a Grade I listed building. History The church dates from the Middle Ages.Nikolaus Pevsner, The Buildings of England: Yorkshire, East Riding The oldest part of the church dates from 1190. It is commonly known as the King of Holderness. =Description from 1831= :Text from Thomas Allen's 'History of York' (1831). \\"The church, a rectory dedicated to St Augustine of Hippo, is an Anglican church, valued in the parliamentary returns at £117 per annum. Patron, the sub-dean of York Minster. This church is held with the vicarage of Preston. It is the most interesting specimen of early pointed architecture in Holderness, and has recently been restored and carefully repaired under the direction of the rector, the Rev. W. Wasse, LL.D. In plan, it consists of a nave and aisles, transepts and chancel, with a handsome and lofty tower at the intersection. The west front is plain, and has a pointed window of five lights. The north side of the nave is made into five divisions by small buttresses, terminating beneath the parapet in angular caps. In each portion, except the second from the west, are pointed windows of three lights, with elegant tracery in the sweep of the arch; in the remaining division is a pointed doorway, with a trefoil head and pedimental canopy. The clerestory exhibits five small pointed windows, and the finish is an embattled parapet. The transept, though much mutilated and defaced, is an interesting specimen of early architecture. It has heavy buttresses at the angles, and in the centre is an elegant recessed doorway, the mouldings resting on dwarf columns. Above this doorway are two stories of windows, three in each, and all enriched with the small flower moulding so common in works of the period. The north side of the chancel has also two stories of windows; the upper are filled up and the lower partly open. The east end is similar to the portion of the church just noticed. The church from Market Hill The south side of the church is similar to the north, except in the transept, which has a large pointed window of five lights, with cinquefoil tracery; and beneath it a circular-headed doorway, of simple but particularly deep mouldings. They rest on three columns, with leaved capitals. Opposite the door is the mutilated effigy of a man in chain armour. The tower, which rises to a considerable height and is a prominent object in every view of Hedon, has double buttresses at the angles, and one in the centre of each face: there are two stories of pointed windows, two in each story, and each having three lights with tracery. The finish of this bold and handsome design is a pierced battlement of particular beauty, and each buttress has a crocketed pinnacle, with smaller ones disposed at regular intervals. The interior, since the late judicious and well-timed repairs have been executed, has assumed an air of respectability proper to the church of a corporate and borough town. The nave is separated from the aisles by five pointed arches, resting on column formed by a union of eight cylinders, with plain capitals. One entire intercolumination at the west end is occupied by a gallery, in which is an elegant organ, erected in 1829.\\" =state=Organ The organ was built by Arthur Nelson in 1926.

Meiron (, Mayrûn; ) was a Palestinian village, located west of Safad. Associated with the ancient Canaanite city of Merom, excavations at the site have found extensive remains from the Hellenistic and Early Roman periods. The remains include a 3rd- century synagogue, and Meiron served as a prominent local religious centre at the time. From the 13th century onward, Meiron was a popular site for Jewish pilgrims.Vilnay, 2003, p. 389. During Ottoman rule in Palestine, the Jewish population fluctuated considerably, with at least two thirds of the population being Arab Muslims. Landownership in the village was nonetheless split almost evenly between Arabs and Jews. Depopulated in two waves over the course of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, the moshav of Meron was founded in its place in 1949 by Israeli soldiers who fought in that war. HistoryBronze and Iron Ages= The association of Meiron with the ancient Canaanite city of Merom or Maroma is generally accepted, though the absence of hard archaeological evidence means other sites a little further north, thus today located in southern Lebanon, such as Marun ar-Ras or Jebel Marun, have also been considered.Aharoni and Rainey, 1979, p. 225.Bromiley, 1995, p. 326. Merom is mentioned in 2nd millennium BCE Egyptian sources, and in Tiglath-pileser III's accounts of his expedition to the Galilee in 733-732 BCE (where it is transcribed as Marum). Soundings conducted below the floors of houses excavated in the 1970s indicate the presence of even earlier structures with a different layout. While these lower levels have not yet been excavated, the possibility that they date back to the Early Bronze Age was not ruled out by the archaeologists. A handful of artifacts dating to the Early Bronze Age, including seal impressions and a basalt bowl, were also found during the digs. =Classical Antiquity= Excavations at Meiron found artifacts dating to the Hellenistic period at the foundation of the site.Zangenberg et al., 2007, p. 155. The economic and cultural affinities of the inhabitants of the Meiron area at this time were directed toward the north, to Tyre and southern Syria in general. Josephus fortified Meiron in the 1st century CE and called the town Mero or Meroth; however, Negev writes that Meroth, another ancient town, was located further north, possibly at the site of Marun as-Ras. According to Avraham Negev, an Israeli archaeologist, by the Second Temple period, Merom was known as Meiron.Negev and Gibson, 2005, p. 332. It is mentioned in the Talmud as being a village in which sheep were reared, that was also renowned for its olive oil.Ben Jonah et al., 1841, pp. 107-108.Negev and Gibson, 2005, p. 330. The Reverend R. Rappaport ventured that merino, the celebrated wool, may have its etymological roots in the name for the village. A tower which still stands at a height of was constructed in Meiron in the 2nd century CE. In the last decade of the 3rd century CE, a synagogue was erected in the village. Known as the Meiron synagogue, it survived an earthquake in 306 CE, though excavations at the site indicate that it was severely damaged or destroyed by another earthquake in 409 CE.Safrai, 1998, p. 83. \\"One of the largest Palestinian synagogues in the basilica style,\\" it is the earliest example of the so-called 'Galilean' synagogue, and consists of a large room with eight columns on each side leading to the facade and a three-doored entrance framed by a columned portico.Urman and Flesher, 1998, pp. 62-63.Stemberger and Tuschling, 2000, p. 123. Artifacts uncovered during digs at the site include a coin of Emperor Probus (276-282 CE) and African ceramics dating to the latter half of the 3rd century, indicating that the city was commercially prosperous at the time. Coins found in Meiron are mostly from Tyre, though a large number are also from Hippos, which lay on the other side of Lake Tiberias. Peregrine Horden and Nicholas Purcell write that Meiron was a prominent local religious centre in the period of late Antiquity. Some time in the 4th century CE, Meiron was abandoned for reasons as yet unknown.Groh, in Livingstone, 1987, p. 71. =Early Islamic to Mamluk periods= Denys Pringle describes Meiron as a \\"[f]ormer Jewish village,\\" with a synagogue and tombs dating to the 3rd and 4th centuries, noting the site was later reoccupied between 750 and 1399.Pringle, 1997, p. 67. In the 12th century, Benjamin de Tudela, a Navarrese rabbi, visited Meiron and described a cave of tombs located there believed to hold the remains of Hillel, Shammai, and \\"twenty of their disciples and other Rabbis.\\" On his visit to Meiron in 1210, Samuel ben Samson, a French rabbi, located the tombs of Simeon bar Yochai and his son Eleazar b. Simeon there. A contemporary of the second Jewish revolt against Rome (132-135 CE), bar Yochai is venerated by Moroccan Jews, whose veneration of saints is thought to be an adaptation of local Muslim customs.Friedland and Hecht, 1996, p. 86. From the 13th century onward, Meiron became the most frequented site of pilgrimage for Jews in Palestine.Horden and Purcell, 2000, p. 446 In the early 14th century, Arab geographer al-Dimashqi mentioned Meiron as falling under the administration of Safad. He reported that it was located near a \\"well-known cave\\" where Jews and possibly non- Jewish locals travelled to celebrate a festival, which involved witnessing the sudden and miraculous rise of water from basins and sarcophagi in the cave.al- Dimashqi quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p.476. =Ottoman period= Palestine was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, and in 1555 the villagers paid a tax on silk spinning.Rhode, 1979, p. 145 for the silk tax By the 1596 tax register, Meiron was located in the nahiya (\\"subdistrict\\") of Jira, part of Sanjak Safad. It was registered as a large village, with 115 households and 15 bachelors, an estimated 715 persons, all Muslims. The village paid taxes on goats, beehives, and a press that processed either grapes or olives; a total of 13,810 akçe.Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 176Khalidi, 1992, p. 477Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that Hütteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9 In 1609, Rabbi Shlumil of Safad wrote that there were many synagogues in ruins and empty of people.David, 1990, pp. 95–96 Turkish traveller Evliya Çelebi, who visited about 1648, told that as the Jewish festival approached, thousands of people, \\"mostly Druzes, Timānis, Yezīdies and Mervāvis\\", gathered inside a cave at Meiron. Then on the day of the festival, large rock basins that were usually dry miraculously filled with water. The water was thought to be a single tear of Yaqub (Jacob) and had marvelous healing properties. As \\"Meiron water\\", it was exported to many countries. Çelebi identified the Jewish festival as the Feast of the Tabernacles, which his translator Stephen judged to be a \\"pardonable mistake\\" for Lag be-Omer. A map from Napoleon's invasion of 1799 by Pierre Jacotin showed the place, named as \\"Merou\\".Karmon, 1960, p. 166. Note 15: the area north of Safad was not surveyed by Jacotin, but drawn based on an existing map of d'Anville. Meiron suffered relatively minor damage in the Galilee earthquake of 1837. It was reported that during the earthquake the walls of the tombs of Rabbi Eleazer and Rabbi She-Maun were dislodged, but did not collapse.Neman, 1971, cited in \\"The earthquake of 1 January 1837 in Southern Lebanon and Northern Israel\\" by N. N. Ambraseys, in Annali di Geofisica, Aug. 1997, p.933, Jewish pilgrims in Meiron, c. 1920. A number of European travellers came to Meiron over the course of the 19th century and their observations from the time are documented in travel journals. Edward Robinson, who visited Meiron during his travels in Palestine and Syria in the mid-19th century, describes it as \\"a very old looking village situated on a ledge of bristling rocks near the foot of the mountain. The ascent is by a very steep and ancient road [...] It is small, and inhabited only by Muhammedans.\\"Robinson, 1856, p. 73. The tombs of Simeon bar Yochai, his son R. Eleazar, and those of Hillel and Shammai are located by Robinson as lying within a khan-like courtyard underneath low-domed structures that were usually kept closed with the keys held in Safad. Robinson indicates that this place was the focal point of Jewish pilgrimage activities by his time; the synagogue is described as being in ruins. Laurence Oliphant also visited Meiron sometime in the latter half of the 19th century. His guide there was a Sephardic rabbi who owned the land that made up the Jewish quarter of the village. Oliphant writes that the rabbi had brought 6 Jewish families from Morocco to till the land, and that they and another 12 Muslim families made up the whole of the village's population at the time.Oliphant, 1886, p.75. Karl Baedeker described it as a small village that appeared quite old with a Muslim population. In 1881 the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described Meiron as a small village of 50 people, all Muslims, who cultivated olives.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, pp. 198-199 A population list from about 1887 showed Meiron to have about 175 inhabitants, all Muslim.Schumacher, 1888, p. 190 =British Mandate period= Jewish pilgrims on the way to Meiron, c. 1920. Towards the end of World War I, the ruins of the Meiron synagogue were acquired by the \\"Fund for the Redemption of Historical Sites\\" (Qeren le-Geulat Meqomot Histori'im), a Jewish society headed by David Yellin.Fine, 2005, p. 23. In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Mairun had a population of 154; all Muslims.Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Safad, p. 41 By 1931, Meiron consisted of an Arab and Jewish quarter, with the former being the larger one and the latter being built around the tomb of Simeon bar Yochai. That year, there were 158 Arabs and 31 Jews in Meiron; a total of 189 people, in 47 houses.Khalidi, 1992, p. 476Mills, 1932, p. 108 bar Yochai celebrations, Meiron, 25 May 1927 In the 1945 statistics, conducted toward the end of the British Mandate in Palestine, depicted an entirely Muslim population of 290 people.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 10Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 70 Meiron had a boy's elementary school. Agriculture and livestock was the dominant economic sectors of the village, with grain being the primary crop, followed by fruits. Around 200 dunams of land were planted with olive trees, and there were two presses in the village used to process olives.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 120Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 170 =1948 War and aftermath= Meiron's villagers were driven out in two waves: one shortly after the capture of Safad by Haganah on 10–11 May 1948, and the other at the end of October 1948, after Meiron itself was occupied. According to Nafez Nazzal, three Israeli planes bombed Meiron, together with the villages of Tarshiha, Safsaf and Jish during Operation Hiram on October 28, and many villagers were killed.Nazzal, 1978, p. 96 One Israeli account states that there were 80 dead left after the defenders had withdrawn.Herzog, 1982, p. 90 =State of Israel= The Israeli moshav of Meron, established in 1949, now sits on the lands of the former Palestinian village. Excavations were carried out in ancient Meiron in 1971-72, 1974–75, and 1977 by Eric M. and Carol L. Meyers.Meyers and Meyers, Eric M. and Carol L. Meyers Papers, 1970 - 1980 Jewish pilgrimages to Meiron continue to be held annually on Lag BaOmer, which falls between Passover and Shavuot, at which time hundreds of thousands of Jews gather at the tomb of Simeon bar Yochai to partake in days of festivities, that include the lighting of bonfires at night.

Distribution Brodiaea pallida is endemic to California, where it is known from a two populations along the border between Tuolumne and Calaveras Counties.USFWS. Five Year Review: B. pallida. January 10, 2008. The first population is at the Type locality near Chinese Camp and contains a varying number of individuals which has been estimated at 600 to 5000. This population is limited to a 65-acre tract of land which is privately owned.USFWS. Determination of threatened status for four plants from the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. Federal Register September 14, 1998. The plant was federally listed as a threatened species in 1998. In the year 2000, a second population was discovered 24 kilometers away, and it may contain up to 10,000 individuals. The species is threatened by development of its habitat.The Nature Conservancy Description Brodiaea pallida is a perennial producing an inflorescence up to about 20 centimeters tall bearing pale purple flowers on short pedicels. Each flower has six strongly curving tepals about a centimeter long. In the center of the flower are three erect white, notch- tipped sterile stamens called staminodes, each about as long as the tepals. Within these are the fertile stamens. Flowering occurs in late May and early June. Conservation This plant grows in mixed soils of volcanic and serpentine origin in vernally moist areas of grassland next to intermittent streams. At the time it was placed on the endangered species list, it was known only from a strip of land under 0.8 kilometers long and just 6 meters wide, and was at risk for extinction from any one destructive event. The population had been fragmented and part was destroyed by construction activity in 1982. It was listed as a threatened species rather than an endangered species because no further disturbance was planned for the area at the time. The second population is also located on privately owned land. It is on the outskirts of the town of Copperopolis, and it is in a zone slated for residential construction. Even if development does not occur at the locations of the plants, development activity nearby could still affect them by altering the flow of the streams, increasing runoff, or encouraging development of roads and firebreaks. The genetic variability of the populations is unknown because it reproduces vegetatively by cloning as well as sexually by seed.

This is usually done by two native speakers teaching each other their native language. Language exchange is different from other Language learning methods as there is usually no set syllabus or activities. Language exchange is sometimes called Tandem language learning. In modern contexts, \\"language exchange\\" most often refers to the mutual teaching of partners' first languages. Language exchanges are generally considered helpful for developing language proficiency, especially in speaking fluency and listening comprehension. Language exchanges that take place through writing or text chats also improve reading comprehension and writing ability. The aim of language exchange is to develop and increase language knowledge and intercultural skills. This is usually done through social interaction with the native speaker. Given that language exchanges generally take place between native speakers of different languages, there is also the side benefit of improving cross-cultural communication. History This practice has long been used by individuals to exchange knowledge of foreign languages. For example, John Milton gave Roger Williams an opportunity to practice Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and French, while receiving lessons in Dutch in exchange.The Jews of Rhode Island, by George M. Goodwin, Ellen Smith (2004) , p. 132 Language exchange first came about in the early 1800s where school aged children in England were introduced to the newly set up program. Countries such as Belgium and Switzerland found the language exchange program very easy to run as there were many languages spoken in the one country. French and German youth picked up language exchange in 1968 which then spread to Turkey and Madrid. In education Universities are increasingly experimenting with language exchanges as part of the language learning curriculum. In this respect, language exchanges have a similar role as study abroad programs and language immersion programs in creating an environment where the language student must use the foreign language for genuine communication outside of a classroom setting. Language Travelling has increased significantly over the last three years, with an increase of 67%.\\\\- Study Travel Magazine Report However, there are also concerns that language exchanges cannot be used as a substitute for formal language education, given the difficulty of using language exchanges in learning formal grammar and writing skills. In addition, various offline organizations exist to facilitate language exchanges, such as Tandem language learning and Unilang, as well as mobile apps like uTandem, Bilingua, Hello Pal and Tandem. By using the mobile apps, users from all over the world can connect with new language partners to share connections and passions. Some of the apps will connect you based on interests, location or just with a native speaker of the language you are searching for. Institutional programs In Europe, the Erasmus programme (established in 1987 by the European Union and incorporated in the Socrates programme in 1994) allows students to do part of their studies in another European institution. The students will be studying for a minimum of three months, up to one year. In Canada, the Katimavik programme is addressed to young volunteers aged 17 to 21; This program has cultural aims and allows them to practice the second official language in three Canadian provinces. In Spain, the fields of education and training have increased language tourism by more than 20% between 2007 and 2009. LAOTSE (Links to Asia by Organizing Traineeship and Student Exchange) is an international network of technical universities from Europe to Asia.:fr:Échange linguistique  Benefits  Language exchanges have been viewed as a helpful tool to aid language learning at language schools. Language exchanges tend to benefit oral proficiency, fluency, colloquial vocabulary acquisition, and vernacular usage. A major benefit of language exchange is the exposure to the native speaker's culture. Understanding the culture of native speaker will help with understanding why and how the language is used. Another benefit is that you are in an friendly and informal environment, this means there is no pressure to get everything right as both speakers are trying to learn and understand. This also gives the learning environment a fun and productive atmosphere. By learning with native speakers each person will get a better understanding of the language as they are learning from someone who has knowledge and background in the language, whereas, learning from someone who has learnt the language later on in their life may not be correct in what they are teaching. Another benefit is that people are learning faster when they have a one-on-one connection with the \\"teacher\\". Many people choose to learn one-on-one but struggle try to find a teacher. People like this are highly motivated to learn a new language. The native speakers who are helping these people may feel a new sense of motivation since they are now responsible for teaching this person. Technology With the growth of the internet, language exchanges using social networks and voice-over-IP technologies have become increasingly popular. Language learning social networks, such as HelloTalk, now offer students the ability to find language partners around the world, and speak, text chat or video through instant messengers. This has allowed students who previously could not find foreign language partners to search online for native speakers of that language. Another perk of this technology is that users can verify their texts with native speakers. This way there will be less grammar mistakes and bigger improvements in languages. There are now over 24 different online language exchange groups that can be joined.

They consist of polystyrene sulfonate resins attached to a cation and are administered either orally or by retention enema to patients who are at risk of developing hyperkalaemia (abnormal high serum potassium levels). Increased serum potassium levels are a condition likely to occur in patients suffering from chronic kidney disease in advanced stages. Clinical use Potassium, the most abundant intracellular cation, is essential for life. An adequate gradient of potassium across the cell membrane is necessary in order to enable excitability of cell membranes. This is particularly important for nerve and muscle function. In humans, mainly the kidneys are responsible for the regulation of serum potassium levels by excreting excess potassium via the urine. As kidney failure progresses, with a consequent decline of excretory function, potassium is likely to accumulate with probable harmful effects on the cellular membrane potential and cardiac arrhythmias as the primary symptom. If the physiological potassium blood level of between 3.8 mmol/L and 5.2 mmol/L is exceeded, hyperkalaemia is diagnosed.Hagemann, O., Normal Serum Potassium Levels, URL: http://www.laborlexikon.de/Lexikon/Infoframe/k/Kalium_Serum.htm; Retrieved 21 January 2010. The mainstay of the treatment for chronic kidney disease patients is potassium removal through the dialysis procedure. However, dietary restrictions and pharmaceutical therapy with potassium binders are important complementary treatment options. Mechanism of action In general, potassium binders are artificial resins that exchange bound cations (Ca2+ or Na+) for potassium ions in the large intestine. After exchange, the released cation and potassium adhering to the resin are excreted with the faeces. This mechanism prevents intestinal absorption of alimentary potassium ions and thereby reduces serum potassium levels. There are two major classes of binders, differentiated by the cation attached to the resin in the original condition. Calcium resins release calcium ions in exchange for potassium ions, whereas sodium resins release sodium. Side effects Hypokalemia, hypomagnesaemia, nausea or vomiting are side effects commonly seen when polystyrene resins are used. Cases of colonic necrosis have been reported, particularly when sodium polystyrene sulfonate was used in combination with the laxative sorbitol. Additionally, electrolyte disturbances, systemic alkalosis or gastric irritation may occur. Furthermore, anorexia, nausea, vomiting or constipation as well as diarrhea have been recorded if high doses were applied.Sorbisterit – Summary of Product Characteristics; Retrieved: 21 January 2010.U.S. National Library of Medicine.

History During the 1920s Sir Robert Lorimer designed a number of war memorials, including the Scottish National War Memorial at Edinburgh Castle.A History Of Scottish Architecture From The Renaissance To The Present Day (published 1996, Edinburgh University Press), Miles Glendinning, Ranald Macinnes & Aonghus MacKechnie, ASIN: B0016X51T0 St Andrew's Garrison Church was built as a memorial to those who lost their lives in the First World War, also known as the Great War. A plaque in the porch of St Andrew's states that: \\"This church was built to the glory of God in thankful remembrance of the soldiers of the Church of Scotland and kindred churches throughout the empire who laid down their lives in the Great War 1914–1918.\\" Church of Scotland links As an army church, St Andrew's is not officially classed as a Church of Scotland church. However, historically most of its ministers have been ordained Church of Scotland ministers. Additionally the church uses the standard Church of Scotland format for its services and the Church of Scotland hymn book, \\"Church Hymnary 4\\". =Congregation= The congregation is not restricted to the military and services are open to civilians. History of the church buildingsArmy camp established, 1854= An army camp was established at Aldershot in 1854. Two churches were quickly erected in that camp the following year. By 1856 a third church was needed and a portable structure known as the \\"Iron Church\\" was erected. In 1866 the Iron Church was transferred from its previous location near Thornhill Road, Aldershot to Queen's Avenue, Aldershot, close to where St Andrew's Garrison Church is sited today. =Iron Church= The Iron Church was used jointly by the Church of Scotland and the Church of England ministers until 1893. In that year St George's Garrison Church was built by the Army for the Anglicans. From then on, until its demolition in 1926, the \\"Iron Church\\" was just used by the Church of Scotland ministers. In 1908, Rev. J. T. Bird, the Chaplain at that time, asked that the Iron Church should be named after the patron saint of Scotland, Saint Andrew. The War Office agreed to this request. =Fundraising= Following the First World War money was raised to replace the Iron Church with a permanent structure which would also serve as a memorial for Church of Scotland and other Presbyterian soldiers who had been killed in that war. =Design of church= View down the nave to the chancel View West down the nave This new church was designed by Sir Robert Lorimer. However, due to cost constraints the nave was initially built slightly shorter than Lorimer had originally planned. Externally the building is predominately brown brick. Its doorways, windows and corner points highlighted with a red brick. Internally, the layout is a standard East facing cross, save that at the East end of the church there is an octagonal apse. =Official opening, 1927= The newly erected St Andrew's Garrison Church was formally opened by Her Royal Highness, Princess Mary, Colonel in Chief of The Royal Scots, on the morning of Saturday 10 December 1927. However within a few years the church was proving to be too small for army ceremonial services. By 1938 enough money had been raised to extend the nave. In particular large donations came from the Trustees of St Andrew's Scottish Soldiers' Club; the Church of Scotland and The Treasury. John F. Matthew, the architectural partner of the by now deceased Sir Robert Lorimer, was commissioned to do the design work. This involved extending the nave by 30 feet, similar to what Lorimer had originally intended in 1926 and reducing the height of the bell tower. =Extension, 1939= On Sunday 5 February 1939, the extended St Andrew's Garrison Church was reopened and rededicated in the presence of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. =Ancillary buildings, 1950s= The 1950s saw the erection of a complex of ancillary buildings next to the church on its north east side providing a hall, kitchen, offices, toilets and storage for the church. They are of a fairly utilitarian 1950s design. Other than the hall, where rough cast is widely used on the exterior, these ancillary buildings were built with a darkish red brick similar to that used in places on the main church building. The church hall is dedicated to the remembrance of members of the \\"Church of Scotland and kindred presbyterian churches who gave their lives\\" in the Second World War. =Statue of St Andrew= Statue of St Andrew outside the Garrison Church Following the closure of the Royal Caledonian School, Bushey, Hertfordshire in the 1990s, a statue of St Andrew by J. G. Bubb, which had been at that school, was donated to the church. The statue now stands outside the front of church, to the south of the porch. A new marble base was added to the statue around 2003/4. =Listing= In 2006 the church building was listed by Rushmoor Borough Council. Listing gives extra protection to a building against alteration or demolition of the structure. InteriorNave= The interior is dominated by a large nave with seating for around four hundred and twenty. There are no balconies. Two arched aisles run between the nave and the side walls. =Cameron Chapel= The south wing, or transept, was converted to a small chapel in 1975. Initially called St Andrew's Chapel, this has come to be known as the Cameron Chapel. The Cameron name relates to the presence of a large stained glass window given by the Cameron Highlanders to the church, in 1930, which can be found in this part of the building, plus accompanying plaque and a regimental flag. A new communion table and plinth were specially commissioned for the opening of the chapel in 1975. =Organ= The organ dates to 1897 The north wing or transept is dominated by a large organ. The organ itself is older than the church buildings and dates from 1897. It originally resided in St Ninian's Church of Scotland, Leith. In 1984, the organ was restored and installed in St Andrew's Garrison Church, following the merger of St Ninian's Church with North Leith and Bonnington Church to form North Leith Parish Church. Monuments The church contains a number of monuments and stained glass. Some of these originated in the church while others have been transferred here over time. Stone showing crest of Gordon Highlanders. It is one of twelve carved by German prisoners of war, held in Egypt, in the Second World War. =Egyptian stones= These include 12 stones set into the wall of the Cameron chapel. The stones were carved by German Prisoners of War, held in Egypt in the Second World War. Initially the stones were placed in an overseas British army church, St Andrew's Kirk, Geneifa, Egypt. Ten of the stones display the regimental cap badges of Scottish Regiments based in the Canal Zone. Two stones show medical badges used in the British Army at the time. When the British Army left Egypt in the mid-1950s the church closed and the stones were, a few years later, transferred to St Andrew's, Aldershot. =War memorials and regimental crests= Other memorials transferred to the church include: *two war memorials from the First World War originally in Aldershot Presbyterian ChurchAldershot Presbyterian Church - War Memorial Register - Imperial War Museum website which can now be found in the porch of St Andrews; *a monument to Field Marshal, Lord Wavell, originally in the Wavell Memorial Chapel, which ceased to be used as a place of worship in 1965-66; *and a window with stained glass showing regimental crests, mainly of Scottish regiments, made up of a number of smaller stained glass windows the bulk of which came from the Church Of Scotland Canteen, in Aldershot, which was knocked down in the late 1960s. Lower half of Haig Memorial Window showing a group mourning. Beneath them a kilted soldier kneels before a grave. =Stained glass= The rest of St Andrew's stained glass was commissioned for the church. There is a large stained glass window in the apse of the church to the memory of Field-Marshal, Earl Haig as well as glass commemorating the Cameron Highlanders and I Corp. Additionally a number of stained glass windows have been given in memory of individual members of the congregation. The church's two largest stained glass windows, namely those dedicated to I Corp and Earl Haig, were both designed by Walter Cook of Edinburgh, in the early to mid-1930s. They have similar themes as both are dominated by Jesus, as saviour and figure of peace, with arms outstretched, underneath him being a small group of grieving people drawing attention to the cost of war in general and the First World War in particular.

Its main entrance is on Riverside Drive, opposite Ridgewood Avenue, but can also be accessed from Hog's Back Road. Mooney's Bay Park has a beach, picnic areas, a children's playground, the Sue Holloway Fitness Park, and is the site of the Terry Fox Stadium. Located at 2960 Riverside Drive, year-round activities are available such as swimming in the waters of the Rideau River, biking along paths that can take riders as far as the downtown core, and cross country skiing. A ski school is available, as are indoor change rooms. Since 2012, like all city parks and beaches, Mooney's Bay Park is regulated by a bylaw which prohibits smoking on the entire beach and park property. In the summer, Mooney's Bay Beach is one of the City of Ottawa's four supervised beaches. The city's Parks, Recreation and Cultural Services Department set up a swimming area, which is supervised by trained lifeguards from 12pm-7pm each day, from the third week in June until the third week in August. From mid-May until early September, volleyball nets can be rented per hour or for the day and stand-up paddleboards (SUPs) can be rented by the hour. This can be done from beach and lifeguard staff. After rainfalls, swimming is often prohibited due to excessive bacteria. The City of Ottawa posts water quality results on its websites and signs are posted when swimming is unsafe. Many wedding parties have their photos taken by the arched wooden bridges with weeping willows as a backdrop in the spring and summer months. Mooney's Bay is also home to Pirate Adventures, an interactive pirate-theatre cruise. Baja Burger Shack is a licensed bar and grill at Mooney's Bay.

Mooney's Bay is an artificial bay on the Rideau River that was created during the construction of the Rideau Canal. A dam and set of locks were constructed to bypass the rapids in the location of the Hog's Back Falls. This created a widened area of the river, suitable for boating. A photograph of a group of Mooney and Carty children at a picnic at the Narrows Lockstation circa 1900 Mooney's Bay was named after three generations of Mooneys who held the position of Lockmaster at Narrows Lock covering 87 of the first 112 years of the lock's history. Michael Mooney and Michael Mooney Jr, who operated the Rideau Lock between the years of 1856 -1871 then passing the Lockmaster obligations onto his son 1874 to 1894. The Mooney reign did not end there. The son of Michael Mooney Jr. and Kate Carty Mooney, Michael Edmund Mooney, temporarily took over as lockmaster for the summer of 1895. He used the name Edmund to avoid confusion with his father and grandfather and was better known as \\"Ebb.\\" Ebb was discharged late in 1896, but was reappointed as permanent lockmaster in 1897 and served until 1946.

The toxic dose depends on the specific TCA. Most are non-toxic at less than 5 mg/kg except for desipramine, nortriptyline, and trimipramine, which are generally non-toxic at less than 2.5 mg/kg. In small children one or two pills can be fatal. An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be included in the assessment when there is concern of an overdose. In overdose activated charcoal is often recommended. People should not be forced to vomit. In those who have a wide QRS complex () sodium bicarbonate is recommended. If seizures occur benzodiazepines should be given. In those with low blood pressure intravenous fluids and norepinephrine may be used. The use of intravenous lipid emulsion may also be tried. In the early 2000s TCAs were one of the most common cause of poisoning. In the United States in 2004 there was more than 12,000 cases. In the United Kingdom they resulted in about 270 deaths a year. An overdose from TCAs was first reported in 1959. Signs and symptoms The peripheral autonomic nervous system, central nervous system and the heart are the main systems that are affected following overdose. Initial or mild symptoms typically develop within 2 hours and include tachycardia, drowsiness, a dry mouth, nausea and vomiting, urinary retention, confusion, agitation, and headache. More severe complications include hypotension, cardiac rhythm disturbances, hallucinations, and seizures. Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities are frequent and a wide variety of cardiac dysrhythmias can occur, the most common being sinus tachycardia and intraventricular conduction delay resulting in prolongation of the QRS complex and the PR/QT intervals. Seizures, cardiac dysrhythmias, and apnea are the most important life-threatening complications. Cause Tricyclics have a narrow therapeutic index, i.e., the therapeutic dose is close to the toxic dose. Factors that increase the risk of toxicity include advancing age, cardiac status, and concomitant use of other drugs. However, serum drug levels are not useful for evaluating risk of arrhythmia or seizure in tricyclic overdose. Pathophysiology Most of the toxic effects of TCAs are caused by four major pharmacological effects. TCAs have anticholinergic effects, cause excessive blockade of norepinephrine reuptake at the preganglionic synapse, direct alpha adrenergic blockade, and importantly they block sodium membrane channels with slowing of membrane depolarization, thus having quinidine-like effects on the myocardium. Diagnosis QRS widening seen in a person who has overdosed on TCAs A specific blood test to verify toxicity is not typically available. An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be included in the assessment when there is concern of an overdose. Treatment People with symptoms are usually monitored in an intensive care unit for a minimum of 12 hours, with close attention paid to maintenance of the airways, along with monitoring of blood pressure, arterial pH, and continuous ECG monitoring. Supportive therapy is given if necessary, including respiratory assistance and maintenance of body temperature. Once a person has had a normal ECG for more than 24 hours they are generally medically clear. =Decontamination= Initial treatment of an acute overdose includes gastric decontamination. This is achieved by giving activated charcoal, which adsorbs the drug in the gastrointestinal tract either by mouth or via a nasogastric tube. Activated charcoal is most useful if given within 1 to 2 hours of ingestion. Other decontamination methods such as stomach pumps, ipecac induced emesis, or whole bowel irrigation are generally not recommended in TCA poisoning. Stomach pumps may be considered within an hour of ingestion but evidence to support the practice is poor. =Medication= Administration of intravenous sodium bicarbonate as an antidote has been shown to be an effective treatment for resolving the metabolic acidosis and cardiovascular complications of TCA poisoning. If sodium bicarbonate therapy fails to improve cardiac symptoms, conventional antidysrhythmic drugs or magnesium can be used to reverse any cardiac abnormalities. However, no benefit has been shown from Class 1 antiarrhythmic drugs; it appears they worsen the sodium channel blockade, slow conduction velocity, and depress contractility and should be avoided in TCA poisoning. Low blood pressure is initially treated with fluids along with bicarbonate to reverse metabolic acidosis (if present), if the blood pressure remains low despite fluids then further measures such as the administration of epinephrine, norepinephrine, or dopamine can be used to increase blood pressure. Another potentially severe symptom is seizures: Seizures often resolve without treatment but administration of a benzodiazepine or other anticonvulsive may be required for persistent muscular overactivity. There is no role for physostigmine in the treatment of tricyclic toxicity as it may increase cardiac toxicity and cause seizures. In cases of severe TCA overdose that are refractory to conventional therapy, intravenous lipid emulsion therapy has been reported to improve signs and symptoms in moribund patients suffering from toxicities involving several types of lipophilic substances, therefore lipids may have a role in treating severe cases of refractory TCA overdose.Goldfrank's Toxicological Emergencies 9th Edition =Dialysis= Tricyclic antidepressants are highly protein bound and have a large volume of distribution; therefore removal of these compounds from the blood with hemodialysis, hemoperfusion or other techniques are unlikely to be of any significant benefit. Epidemiology Studies in the 1990s in Australia and the United Kingdom showed that between 8 and 12% of drug overdoses were following TCA ingestion. TCAs may be involved in up to 33% of all fatal poisonings, second only to analgesics. Another study reported 95% of deaths from antidepressants in England and Wales between 1993 and 1997 were associated with tricyclic antidepressants, particularly dothiepin and amitriptyline. It was determined there were 5.3 deaths per 100,000 prescriptions. Sodium channel blockers such as Dilantin should not be used in the treatment of TCA overdose as the Na+ blockade will increase the QTI.

Mid Valley School District encompasses approximately . According to 2000 federal census data, it serves a resident population of 15,193. By 2010, the district's population increased to 15,304 people.US Census Bureau, 2010 Census Poverty Data by Local Education Agency, 2011 The educational attainment levels for the Mid Valley School District population (25 years old and over) were 89.9% high school graduates and 20.8% college graduates. The district is one of 12 public school districts in Lackawanna County and one of the 500 public school districts of Pennsylvania. According to the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, 49.2% of the district's pupils lived at 185% or below the Federal Poverty level as shown by their eligibility for the federal free or reduced price school meal programs in 2012.Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, Education Facts Student Poverty Concentration by LEA, 2012 In 2009, the Mid Valley School District residents’ per capita income was $17,167, while the median family income was $42,468.US Census Bureau, American Fact Finder, 2009 In Lackawanna County, the median household income was $43,673. In the Commonwealth, the median family income was $49,501 and the United States median family income was $49,445, in 2010. By 2013, the median household income in the United States rose to $52,100. Per school district officials, in school year 2005-06 the Mid Valley School District provided basic educational services to 1,674 pupils through the employment of 114 teachers, 76 full-time and part-time support personnel, and 6 administrators. In the 2009-10 school year, the district provided basic educational services to 1,902 pupils. The district employed: 129 teachers, 81 full-time and part-time support personnel, and 15 administrators. The district received $5.8 million in state funding in the 2009-10 school year. For the 2013-14 school year, the Mid Valley School District reported an enrollment of 1,731 pupils. It employed 123 teachers, 49 staff full or part-time staff members and 22 administrators. The district received $6,580,408 in state funding in 2013-14. Mid Valley School District operates two schools: Mid Valley Elementary Center (grades K-6) and Mid Valley Secondary Center (grades 7-12). High school students may choose to attend Career Technology Center of Lackawanna County for training in the construction and mechanical trades. The Northeastern Educational Intermediate Unit, IU19, provides the district with a wide variety of services like specialized education for disabled students and hearing, speech and visual disability services and professional development for staff and faculty. Governance The Mid Valley School District is governed by 9 individually elected board members (serve without compensation for a term of four years), the Pennsylvania State Board of Education, the Pennsylvania Department of Education and the Pennsylvania General Assembly.Pennsylvania Public School Code Governance 2010 The federal government controls programs it funds like: Title I funding for low income children in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the No Child Left Behind Act, (renamed Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in December 2015) which mandates the district focus its resources on student success in acquiring reading and math skills. The school board is required by state law to post a financial report on the district in its website by March of each school year. The Superintendent and Business Manager are appointed by the school board. The Superintendent is the chief administrative officer with overall responsibility for all aspects of operations, including education and finance. The Business Manager is responsible for budget and financial operations. Neither of these officials are voting members of the School Board. The School Board enters into individual employment contracts for these positions. These contracts must be in writing and are subject to public disclosure under the state's Right to Know Act. In Pennsylvania, public school districts are required to give 150 days notice to the Superintendent regarding renewal of the employment contract.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Pennsylvania School Code, 2013 Pursuant to Act 141 of 2012 which amended the Pennsylvania School Code, all school districts that have hired superintendents on/after the fall of 2012 are required to develop objective performance standards and post them on the district's website. History of the district Prior to 1969 each borough within the district had operated its own schools. The Pennsylvania legislature enacted the School District Reorganization Act of 1961, the School District Reorganization Act of 1963, and the School District Reorganization Act of 1968. Due to dwindling populations because of the decline of anthracite mining in the region, in accordance with this legislation, the schools of the boroughs combined to form the Mid Valley School District for the 1969-1970 school year. The name picked for the district \\"Mid Valley\\" comes from the fact that the three towns are considered to be in the middle of the Lackawanna Valley and the area of the three towns (along with Blakely, Jessup, sometimes Archbald) are often referred to as the Mid Valley Region. For the 1969-70 school year and throughout most of the 1970s, the district population utilized the former Olyphant Junior High School as the Mid-Valley Senior High School for students in grades 10 through 12, and the former Dickson City Junior High School as the Mid-Valley Junior High School for students in grades 7 through 9. There was an elementary school for students in kindergarten through sixth grade in each borough. Soon afterward sixth grade students from Throop began to attend classes in Olyphant. Problems ranging from lack of heat in the winter months, and structural problems plagued the new district throughout much of the first decade. In the spring of 1977, while plans for a new junior- senior high school for grades 7-12 on Franko Street in Throop were on hold, the Olyphant Elementary School and the Dickson City Elementary School were condemned by the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry because of violations of the Fire and Panic Law. The displaced elementary school students then attended classes on a full-time basis in the junior high school. The junior high school students and the senior high school students used the senior high school building on split sessions. Soon afterward the Dickson City Elementary School (former Dickson City High School) was destroyed by fire. For the 1978-79 school year, district rented the former St. Patrick's School in Olyphant and used it for seventh and eighth grade students. The secondary students were no longer attending classes on split sessions. The district operated in that mode until the opening of the new Mid Valley Secondary Center on Underwood Road in Throop in the fall of 1981. = 1981 - 1989 = In September 1981, the new high school building was finally opened at its present location at 52 Underwood Road in Throop. The new building housed grades 7 - 12 and was named Mid Valley Secondary Center. With the opening of the new building, Mid Valley Intermediate Center (grades 4 - 6) moved into the building formerly occupied by the senior high school in Olyphant and grades K-3 were Mid Valley Primary Center, housed in the remaining school building in Dickson City. The land chosen for the new district building was, at the time a rather remote section of Throop which was mostly wooded which allowed for expansion as a large parcel of land was bought by the district. Spartan Stadium, the track and football field, as well as an open sports field and baseball/softball fields were set up at the opposite end of the property from the new building, which was adjacent to Underwood Road. A field house was recently added to the sports complex. Plans were made to build another building to house both the primary and intermediate students on the district land adjacent to the Secondary Center. The new building was opened for the start of the 1989-1990 school year for students in grades K-6. = 1989 to present = Due to increases in student population from recent housing developments, the elementary school building was expanded in the early 1990s. Mid Valley Secondary Center was expanded in the early 2000s A Mid Valley School District substitute van driver was taken for drug and alcohol testing after another adult in the vehicle called school officials to report smelling an alcoholic beverage.http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/mid-valley-school-van- driver-taken-for-drug-and-alcohol-testing-1.747113 Van driver, Jennifer O'Rourke of Throop was charged with drunken driving while transporting students home from school.

By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students must complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. At Midd Valley School District the student's project focuses on career and community and may include community service or career shadowing. Completing the project provides the student with 1 credit towards graduation. Effective with the graduating class of 2017, the Pennsylvania Board of Education eliminated the state mandate that students complete a culminating project in order to graduate.Pennsylvania State Board of Education, Proposed changes to Chapter 4, May 10, 2012 By Pennsylvania School Board regulations, beginning with the class of 2017 (2019), public school students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, and English Literature by passing the Keystone Exams. For the class of 2019, a composition exam will be added. For the class of 2020, passing a civics and government exam will be added to the graduation requirements.Pennsylvania Department of Education, State Board of Education Finalizes Adoption of Pennsylvania Common Core State Academic Standards and High School Graduation Requirements, March 14, 2013 In 2011, Pennsylvania high school students field tested the Algebra 1, Biology and English Lit exams.

Mid Valley High School was eligible for special, extra funding under School Improvement Grants, which the school had to apply for each year. ;PSSA results: Pennsylvania System of School Assessments, commonly called PSSAs are No Child Left Behind Act related examinations which were administered from 2003 through 2012, in all Pennsylvania public high schools. The exams were administered in the Spring of each school year. The goal was for 100% of students to be on grade level or better in reading and mathematics, by the Spring of 2014. The tests focused on the state's Academic Standards for reading, writing, mathematics and science. The Science exam included content in science, technology, ecology and the environmental studies. The mathematics exam included: algebra I, algebra II, geometry and trigonometry. The standards were first published in 1998 and are mandated by the Pennsylvania State Board of Education. In 2013, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania changed its high school assessments to the Keystone Exams in Algebra 1, Reading/literature and Biology1.

Science in Motion Mid Valley High School did not take advantage of a state program called Science in Motion which brought college professors and sophisticated science equipment to the school to raise science awareness and to provide inquiry-based experiences for the students. The Science in Motion program was funded by a state appropriation and cost the school nothing to participate.The Pennsylvania Basic Education/Higher Education Science and Technology Partnership, Science in Motion annual report, 2012 Wilkes University provided the science enrichment experiences to schools in the region. =College remediation= According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 14% of Mid Valley School graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.National Center for Education Statistics, IPEDS Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, 2008 Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English. =Dual enrollment= Mid Valley High School offers a dual enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offers a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. For the 2009-10 funding year, the school district received a state grant of $2,456 for the program.Pennsylvania Department of Education Dual Enrollment Fall Grants 2009-10. August 2009 In 2010, Governor Edward Rendell eliminated the grants to students. =SAT scores= In 2014, 86 Mid Valley High School students took the SAT exams.

They averaged 497 (out of 800) verbal, 514 math and 489 in writing. The Center for Rural Pennsylvania, a research arm of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, compared the SAT data of students in rural areas of Pennsylvania to students in urban areas. From 2003 to 2005, the average total SAT score for students in rural Pennsylvania was 992, while urban students averaged 1,006. During the same period, 28 percent of 11th and 12th graders in rural school districts took the exam, compared to 32 percent of urban students in the same grades. The average math and verbal scores were 495 and 497, respectively, for rural students, while urban test- takers averaged 499 and 507, respectively. Pennsylvania's SAT composite score ranked low on the national scale in 2004. The composite SAT score of 1,003 left Pennsylvania ranking 44 out of the 50 states and Washington, DC. AP Courses In 2014, Mid Valley Secondary Center offered 3 Advanced Placement (AP) courses at a higher cost than regular courses. The fee for each AP Exam was $91 (2014). The school normally retains $9 of that fee as a rebate to help with administrative costs. In 2012, the fee was $89 per test per pupil. Students have the option of taking College Board approved courses and then taking the College Board's examination in the Spring. Students, who achieve a 3 or better on the exam, may be awarded college credits at US universities and colleges. Each higher education institution sets its own standards about what level of credits are awarded to a student based on their AP exam score. Most higher education give credits for scores of 4 or 5. Some schools also give credits for scores of 3. High schools give credits towards graduation to students who take the school's AP class. At Berwick Area School District the AP courses are weighted at 1.08 credits.Berwick Area School District Administration, Advanced Placement Courses information for Parents and Students, 2013 At Mid Valley Secondary Center just 11% of the students who took an AP course earned a 3 or better on the exam.PDE, School Performance Profile - Academic Performance Data - Mid Valley Secondary Center, December 2014 =Middle school= ;AYP History In 2012, Mid Valley Middle School declined further to School Improvement II AYP Status due to chronic low student achievement in reading and mathematics. *2011 - declined to School Improvement I due to chronic low academic achievement.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Mid Valley Middle School AYP Overview 2011, September 2011 *2010 - Warning AYP status due to lagging achievementPennsylvania Department of Education, Mid Valley Middle School AYP Overview 2010, October 2010 *2009 - declined to Warning AYP status due to lagging academic achievementPennsylvania Department of Education, Mid Valley Middle School AYP Overview 2009, September 14, 2009 *2008 - achieved AYP statusPennsylvania Department of Education, Mid Valley Middle School AYP Overview 2008, August 15, 2008 ;PSSA history Sixth and seventh grades have been tested in reading and mathematics since 2006. Eighth graders are tested in: reading, writing, mathematics and Science. Beginning in the Spring of 2013, eighth graders, who are enrolled in Algebra I take the Keystone Exam for Algebra I at the end of the course. The testing of 8th grade in reading and mathematics began in 1999, as a state initiative. Testing in science began in 2007. The goal is for 100% of students to be on grade level or better in reading and mathematics, by the Spring of 2014. The tests focus on the state's Academic Standards for reading, writing, mathematics and science. The standards were published in 1998 and are mandated by the Pennsylvania State Board of Education.

State - 84% Special education In December 2013, Mid Valley School District administration reported that 275 pupils, or 15.5% of the district's pupils, received special education services, with 41.8% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2009, the district administration reported that 283 pupils, or 15.3% of the district's pupils, received special education services. Special education services in the Commonwealth are provided to students from ages three years to 21 years old. In the 2010-2011 school year, the total student enrollment was more than 1.78 million students with approximately 275,000 students eligible for special education services. Among these students 18,959 were identified with mental retardation and 21,245 students with autism.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Testimony Hearing on Special Education Senate Republican Policy Committee, January 2013 The largest group of students are identified as Specific Learning Disabilities 126,026 students (46.9 percent) and Speech or Language Impairments with 43,542 students (16.2 percent). In 2007, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak testified before the Pennsylvania House Education Committee regarding full-day kindergarten. He claimed that districts which offered the program would see a significant decrease in special education students due to early identification and early intervention. He asserted the high cost of full-day kindergarten would be recouped by districts in lower special education costs. Mid Valley School District has provided full-day kindergarten since 2011. Mid Valley School District has seen a slight increase in the percentage of special education students it serves, yielding no savings. The district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the Special Education Department. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. Mid Valley School District received a $825,822 supplement for special education services in 2010. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 14 or 0.76% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Through the strategic planning process, the Superintendent must ensure that Mid Valley School District provides a continuum of program and service options to meet the needs of all mentally gifted students for enrichment, acceleration, or both. Teacher Evaluation process Historically by law, Pennsylvania's public school teachers were evaluated achieving one of two ratings, satisfactory or unsatisfactory. The evaluation provided no meaningful feedback in areas where an educator could improve. In June 2012, the Pennsylvania General Assembly established the new educator evaluation method, which was implemented in the 2013-14 school year. The new public school teacher evaluation includes multiple measures of student achievement, such as the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment, the Pennsylvania Value Added Assessment System, graduation and promotion rates, as well as other elective data to be determined at the local level. The Mid Valley School District volunteered to participate in a pilot project with the Pennsylvania Department of Education to develop statewide policy, tools and processes to evaluate teachers and principals in which student achievement is a significant factor affecting performance ratings. Secretary of Education Ron Tomalis announced that 104 K-12 entities, including nine career and technical centers, nine charter schools and nine intermediate units, signed-up to participate in the new teacher and principal evaluation pilot program. The initiative was funded by a Gates Momentum grant.Brittany Leknes, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Versus The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching: A Historical Comparison of Two Philanthropic Powerhouses in Education, December 2011 During the 2011-12 school year, more than 120 school districts, charter schools, intermediate units, and career and technology centers participated in the second implementation phase of the new teacher evaluation tool. This included more than 650 supervisors and nearly 5,000 teachers in 366 school buildings participating in the pilot project. The final phase of the updated Pennsylvania public education professionals evaluation system was implemented during the 2012-13 school year, with 264 local education agencies, consisting of 1,387 school buildings, 1,892 principals/supervisors and more than 31,600 teachers included. In advocating for the new evaluation system, Secretary of Education Ronald Tomalis reported that research demonstrated that the performance of an educator has a direct impact on the future success of students.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Teacher Strategies to Improve Student Performance 2012 The new evaluation system will become effective for principals in the 2014-15 school year. In the United States of America, 22 other states use student achievement to evaluate educators. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days’ public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 ;Official Misconduct In 2010, Mid Valley School District and School Board were cited by the Pennsylvania Auditor General's Office for significant questionable spending at a national school board convention in Florida. School board members charged costly meals and theme park tickets in addition to other travel spending to the school district.Auditor General Jack Wagner, Audit Finds Mid Valley School District Officials Charged $36,478 to Taxpayers, June 23, 2010 Several school board members (Shevchik, Rovinsky, Gilgallon, Logan) were found by the PA Ethics Commission to have violated Section 1103(a) of the Public Official and Employee Ethics Act, 65 Pa.C.S. §1103(a). They were required to repay the school district. In 2015, Pennsylvania Auditor General Eugene DePasquale revealed that Mid Valley School District had been downgraded to junk bond status. In 2016, Pennsylvania Auditor General Eugene DePasquale audited the district again. He reported that Mid Valley School District had paid a former business manager nearly $14,000 for unused sick days which he was not entitled to receive. ;Employees In October 2015, Mid Valley teachers Union declared they would work to the expired contract. The union and board have been in negotiations for nearly two years. In 2013, the average teacher salary in Mid Valley School District was $51,772 a year. The district employed 263 teachers and administrators, with a top salary of $124,106. Mid Valley School District teacher and administrator retirement benefits are equal to at least 2.00% x Final Average Salary x Total Credited Service. (Some teachers benefits utilize a 2.50% benefit factor.) After 40 years of service, a teacher can retire with 100% of the average salary of their final 3 years of employment. According to a study conducted at the American Enterprise Institute, in 2011, public school teachers’ total compensation is roughly 50 percent higher than they would likely receive in the private sector. The study found that the most generous benefits that teachers receive are not accounted for in many studies of compensation including: pension, retiree health benefits and job security. In 2009, Mid Valley School District reported employing over 130 teachers with a starting salary of $38,000 for 183 days for pupil instruction. The average teacher salary was $47,205 while the maximum salary was $84,000. As of 2007, Pennsylvania ranked in the top 10 states in average teacher salaries. When adjusted for cost of living Pennsylvania ranked fourth in the nation for teacher compensation.Teachers need to know enough is enough, PaDelcoTimes, April 20, 2010. Mid Valley teachers are required to work a seven-hour day. Additionally, Mid Valley School District teachers receive a defined benefit pension, health insurance, long term disability insurance, professional development reimbursement, paid personal days, 10 sick days, and other benefits. Teachers are paid an additional hourly rate, if they are required to work outside of the regular school day. Retirees receive compensation for each unused accumulated sick day. Teachers who serves as department heads and team leaders receive extra compensation. According to State Rep. Glen Grell, a trustee of the Pennsylvania Public School Employees’ Retirement System Board, a 40-year educator can retire with a pension equal to 100 percent of their final salary. In 2007, the district employed 96 teachers. The average teacher salary in the district was $44,327 for 183 school days worked. Administration costs Mid Valley School District administrative costs per pupil in 2008 was $837.72 per pupil. This ranked 154th out of 500 Pennsylvania School districts. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil. In February 2015, Superintendent James Tallarico emailed the board his resignation effective immediately.

A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and all government property (local, state and federal). Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections (Local Tax Enabling Act), which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When a Pennsylvania public school district includes municipalities in two or more counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2014-15 - 101.5859 mills *2013-14 - 97.56 mills *2012-13 - 92.2900 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Finances_Real Estate Tax Rates 2012-13, 2012 *2011-12 - 92.2900 mills *2010-11 - 90.7500 mills *2009-10 - 87.6900 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports, 2010 *2008-09 - 87.6900 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports 2008-09 Real Estate Mills, 2009 *2007-08 - 84.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2008 *2006-07 - 84.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006 *2005-06 - 72.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The average yearly property tax paid by Lackawanna County residents amounts to about 3.4% of their yearly income.

Act 1 Adjusted Index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not authorized to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation eliminating six of the exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. The legislature also froze the payroll amount public school districts use to calculate the pension-plan exception at the 2012 payroll levels. Further increases in payroll cannot be used to raise the district's exception for pension payments.

Property tax relief In 2014, Mid Valley School Board approved 4,071 homestead properties received $64. The decline in amount was related to more residents applying for tax relief and a decline in table games tax revenues. The amount received by the district must be divided equally among all approved residences. In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Mid Valley School District was $68 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 3,848 property owners applied for the tax relief. The tax relief was subtracted from the total annual school property on the individual's tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least 10 contiguous acres and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Lackawanna County, the highest property tax relief in 2009 was awarded to the approved property owners in Scranton School District at $334. Pennsylvania awarded the highest property tax relief to residents of the Chester-Upland School District in Delaware County at $632 per homestead and farmstead in 2010. This was the second year Chester Upland School District was the top recipient. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program provided some Mid Valley School District residents: low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently individuals who have income substantially more than $35,000, may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Enrollment Mid Valley School District is experiencing low enrollment in K-12. The Pennsylvania Department of Education projects the district's enrollment will be less than 2400 pupils through 2018. Shifting population trends across the U.S. and Pennsylvania are affecting school enrollment. Over the next 10 years, rural Pennsylvania school enrollment is projected to decrease 8 percent. The most significant enrollment decline is projected to be in western Pennsylvania, where rural school districts may have a 16 percent decline. More than 40 percent of elementary schools and more than 60 percent of secondary schools in western Pennsylvania are projected to experience significant enrollment decreases (15 percent or greater).\\"Research Analyzes Rural School District Enrollment and Building Capacity\\", The Center for Rural Pennsylvania. October 2009. A study done by Standard and Poors in 2007 (at the request of the PA General Assembly) examined whether the consolidation of small school district's administrations would yield saving where the resulting district had approximately 3000 pupils. Superintendent were asked about savings, if their district were to merge with another district at the administrative level only, but not close any of their schools. It found 42% of survey respondents thought consolidation could achieve cost reductions. Additionally, 63% of responding superintendents believed that consolidation with another district would help provide additional academic enrichment opportunities for the students. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants Fiscal Responsibility Task Force released a report which found that consolidating school district administrations with one neighboring district would save the Commonwealth $1.2 billion without forcing the consolidation of any schools. Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. Less than 95 of Pennsylvania's 501 school districts have enrollment below 1250 students, in 2007.Pennsylvania Legislative Budget and Finance Committee, Study of the Cost Effectiveness of Consolidating Pennsylvania School Districts, 2007. Wellness and nutrition Mid Valley School District offers a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandates that districts raise their full pay lunch prices every year until the price of non- subsidized lunches equals the amount the federal government reimburses schools for free meals. That subsidy in 2013-2014 was $2.93. In 2014, President Barack Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Mid Valley School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. Extracurriculars Mid Valley School District offers a variety of clubs, activities and an extensive sports program. For 2015-16 the district budgeted $684,857 for student activities.Mid Valley School District Administration, Budget 2015-16, May 2015 Eligibility to participate is determined by school board policy. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. According to PA Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting Act 126 of 2014, all volunteer coaches and all those who assist in student activities, must have criminal background checks. Like all school district employees, they must also attend an anti child abuse training once every three years.Eleanor Chute., New Pa. law expands clearance requirements for school volunteers, employees, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, December 15, 2014Ali Stevens., Child Protective Services Law impacts schools, WKOK.com 1070AM, January 6, 2015 = Athletics = Coaches receive compensation as outlined in the teachers' union contract. When athletic competition exceeds the regular season, additional compensation is paid.Mid Valley School Board, Mid Valley School District Teacher Union Contract, 2010 Mid Valley School District does not provide its athletics disclosure form on its web site. Article XVI-C of the Public School Code requires the disclosure of interscholastic athletic opportunities for all public secondary school entities in Pennsylvania. All school entities with grades 7-12 are required to annually collect data concerning team and financial information for all male and female athletes beginning with the 2012-13 school year and submit the information to the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Beginning with the 2013-14 school year, all non-school (booster club and alumni) contributions and purchases must also be reported to PDE. According to Pennsylvania's Safety in Youth Sports Act, all sports coaches, paid and volunteer, are required to annually complete the Concussion Management Certification Training and present the certification before coaching. Mid Valley Secondary Center has teams in the following areas: Football - Varsity and Freshman teams. All freshmen play on the freshman team, who are then encouraged to join the varsity team for their sophomore year. Cross Country - Varsity and Junior High. The Varsity team is considered all the high school students (grade 9 - 12), the junior high team historically has been grades 7 and 8. Soccer - originally introduced with a co-ed team, there are now separate teams for boys and girls. Golf Basketball - For Boys set up similarly to the football team with a separate freshman team, additionally teams exist for 7th and 8th grade boys. For girls, one team exists for high school students and separate teams for junior high and elementary students. The Mid Valley boys varsity team won the Pete Turonis championship for the first time in 29 years. Baseball - Varsity, Freshman and junior high teams Softball - Varsity, Junior Varsity and Junior high teams Track & Field - Varsity and Junior high teams for both genders Tennis - Varsity teams for both genders. Females play in the Fall and males play in the Spring Cheerleading The historic rivals of the Mid Valley Spartans are the neighboring Valley View Cougars. An unofficial rivalry also exists with Holy Cross High School. During football season or when a team advances in the playoffs it is common to see the downtowns of all three towns adorned with blue and white ribbons and \\"Luv Ya Spartans\\" signs in business windows. = Student activities = The student paper for the Secondary Center is The Spartan Outlook and is staffed by high school students in journalism electives. Mrs. Patricia Powell is currently the chairperson of the English Department and of the award-winning scholastic newspaper,The Spartan Outlook. Other popular student activities at the secondary center include Leo Club, Mock Trial, Spartan Pride (equivalent to a booster club), National Honors Society, student council, drama, and yearbook. The Mid Valley Drama Club presents full-scaled musicals under the direction of Mrs. Patricia Powell. Many students continued on a professional acting, dancing, or singing careers, including Michael McIlwee, who recently performed in \\"The Music Man,\\" and \\"A Chorus Line.\\" Gia Mazur, Matt Rinkunas, and Joe O'Malley with the acclaimed band One Hot Mess, Angel Buckley, and Brad Louryk. Club alumna Michelle O'Malley has launched a career as an acting coach. In May 2013, the Drama Club staged an original musical, War Bonds, written by the director, Patricia Powell. The story focuses on a veteran suffering from early-stage PTSD. With the help of veterans from various wars and conflicts, the lead character, played by Dane Hill, finds peace with himself, his country, and his family. The performance marks the 27th year that Mrs. Powell has been the director of the theater. Additionally, a statistically large number of students enter the Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science Competition and compete at both the regional and state level. Spirit Week, typically held in the Fall of each year is a popular student event that includes athletic competitions, as well as bake-offs and also has themed days. Many senior classes have traditionally gone to Orlando, Florida, on a week-long class trip in the spring. However, in the early 2000s the number of seniors participating decreased due to the cost of the trip and suspending the trip has been discussed. In 2008; however, the administration added an additional all expenses paid trip to Florida for the administration. The trip during the 2008 year cost the district and taxpayers approximately $36,000.00 breaking down to about $5,000 per person. Randy Parry had the most expenses to the district. Attending members included board President John Gilgallon, Deborah Shevchik, Thomas Logan, Lisa Rovinsky, Mary Ruth Tanner and Mark Runco. High school Principal Randy Parry also attended. Directors Jerry Barone and Ken Novack did not attend. Director Eric Pusey had almost all his expenses reimbursed by the NEIU, so his expenses are not included in the $36,000 total. Randy Parry, High School principal at the time, was later promoted to district superintendent.

The initiative commenced 1 January 2009, and includes restructuring Senior Secondary Colleges and TAFE Tasmania. It was anticipated that the restructuring would be complete by the start of the 2011 school year.Tasmania Department of Education-Tasmania Tomorrow The institutes created by this initiative are: * The Tasmanian Academy focuses on academic learning, with a curriculum and academic pathway for Year 11 and 12 students seeking university entrance. * The Tasmanian Polytechnic focuses on practical learning, with a vocational pathway, supported by academic courses, for Years 11 and 12 and mature-age students seeking employment outcomes or university articulation. * The Tasmanian Skills Institute focuses on skills development for employees in enterprises, in line with the needs of industry. Implementation A project team in the Department of Education was responsible for implementing this initiative through to the 'start up' of the three new organisations in January 2009. Members of the project team were drawn from TAFE Tasmania, the Department of Education including Senior Secondary Colleges, and Skills Tasmania. A project steering committee was established to oversee the project. This committee was chaired by the Secretary of the Department of Education and included representatives from both TAFE Tasmania and the Department of Education. Working groups were established to work on key issues such as educational programs, employee relations, logistics, funding and business models. Other groups were established to provide advice to the steering committee including a leaders group consisting of all college principals and senior Department of Education and TAFE Tasmania staff, and a Guaranteeing Futures Reference Group to provide advice on issues affecting young people including transition to the new organisations.Tasmania Department of Education - FAQ =Timeline= Following the consultation period (June – October 2007), the Tasmanian government decided to transition to the Tasmania Tomorrow model. The Tasmanian Academy, Tasmanian Polytechnic and the Tasmanian Skills Institute commenced operations during January 2009. Beginning in 2009, Hobart, Hellyer, Don and Newstead Colleges changed to the new structure. Initially all of these colleges had a campus of the Tasmanian Academy and Tasmanian Polytechnic located on site. Other colleges were to change to the new structures over the following two years, with all colleges completing transition by 2011. TAFE Tasmania was split to create the Tasmanian Skills Institute and the Tasmanian Polytechnic. Restructure of collegesThe Tasmanian Academy= This institute is for students aiming to go to university. It has a pre-tertiary focus where students can develop their capacity for thinking, enterprise, communication, IT and life skills. It is connected to future careers, particularly in a Tasmanian context. The academy is governed by representation from professional bodies, university, the arts, business, industry and parents. It attracts industry and business sponsorship, and has scholarship programs to assist students, particularly those from rural and remote areas.Tasmania Tomorrow public document Restructure of TAFE TasmaniaThe Tasmanian Polytechnic= The Tasmanian Polytechnic offers a wide range of learning and career options to prepare students for employment. Students can work towards a Tasmanian Certificate of Education, choose to go on to university or earn a nationally recognised qualification. Campuses are located throughout the state. =The Tasmanian Skills Institute= The Tasmanian Skills Institute commenced operations in 2009, and focuses on training for apprentices/trainees and up-skilling existing workers. The Tasmanian Skills Institute partners with businesses to provide workforce skills development and improve the productivity and prosperity of businesses. Training is flexible, customised to specific needs and extends across all industry sectors. Workshops are held in the workplace, at a campus, or online. The Tasmanian Skills Institute also offers recognition of workers' existing skills. The Tasmanian Skills Institute supports the following industry skills groups: Allied Construction Trades, Plumbing & Gas, Automotive, Business, Construction, Cookery, Electrotechnology, Food Processing, Hair & Beauty, Community Services and Health, Licensed Skills, Metals & Manufacturing, Mining, Natural Resources, Tourism & Hospitality and Workplace Learning Services. Problems The Polytechnic, Academy and Skills Institute were established in a solid attempt to improve retention of students within the educational system after year 10. The old education system was criticized for not working for all students, as Tasmania has one of the lowest post year 10 and 11 retention rates in Australia. It was considered that rapid change was required to deliver more positive outcomes for students, the local economy and Tasmania. Tasmania Tomorrow hopes to deliver an educational experience which focuses on engaging all students. The Tasmania tomorrow program has received harsh criticism by the media and the teachers association of Tasmania. The intensity of criticism seen in the first year of reform is gaining momentum as the new system becomes shows signs that the changes have been poorly implemented. In the second semester of 2013, the Polytechnic was dissolved and a reformed TAFE Tasmania began operating as TasTAFE.

The program is part of the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). Wildlife Services is tasked with protecting those resources from damage or threats posed by wildlife. It works in every state to conduct a program of integrated wildlife damage management in response to local requests. Wildlife damage management is a specialized field within the wildlife management profession.  History and mission  Wildlife Services trapper setting a fox trap at an Steller's eider conservation area in Alaska Wildlife Services bird control agent at Bagram Air Field, Afghanistan Wildlife Services’ goals and objectives have evolved significantly since its establishment in 1895 as part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. At first the program focused on rodent management and predator control activities. Although its mission and legal authority have not changed, the range of activities has increased over time due to changing social and economic needs. The mission of Wildlife Services is to provide Federal leadership among stakeholders in the wildlife management profession, the public, nongovernmental organizations, and governmental/research entities to address wildlife-related problems. The program is committed to the principle that wildlife is a publicly owned resource held in our trust in there actions and managed by state and federal agencies. Its primary statutory authorities are found in two acts of Congress: The Act of March 2, 1931 (46 Stat. 1468; 7 U.S.C. 426-426b) as amended,The Act of March 2, 1931 and The Act of December 22, 1987 (101 Stat. 1329-331, 7 U.S.C. 426c).Federal Animal Damage Control Act Wildlife Services was originally established as the Division of Predatory Animal and Rodent Control within the Bureau of Biological Survey. In 1939, the Bureau of Biological Survey of USDA and the Bureau of Fisheries in the Department of Commerce were transferred to the Department of the Interior to form the Fish and Wildlife Service. In 1985 Wildlife Services returned to USDA as Animal Damage Control (ADC), as part of APHIS, the agency whose mission is to protect the health and value of U.S. agriculture and natural resources. Since 1997 the agency has been known as USDA Wildlife Services. Responding to increasingly diverse requests for assistance, Wildlife Services has expanded its operational and research activities beyond its early emphasis on rabies and rodent control and livestock protection. Current programs now include threatened and endangered species conservation, the protection of public health and safety, wildlife disease surveillance and monitoring, research efforts emphasizing nonlethal methods and other activities and programs. In many situations, the individual or institution requesting assistance (the cooperator) contributes financially to the management activity conducted by Wildlife Services. Congressional appropriations fund some programs and projects, such as surveillance for disease. Many operational activities are partnerships with local, state and other federal agencies. Wildlife Services promotes an integrated wildlife damage management approach, which means conflicts are resolved by using a wide variety of methods to protect the valued property or agricultural resource, such as excluding wildlife from access and managing wildlife. Its staff responds to more than 200,000 human–wildlife interactions annually. Most are resolved using nonlethal methods including habitat modification, repellents, noise- and light-devices, and altered animal husbandry practices. It offers training to individuals and businesses. Wildlife damage management can engender controversy, often around the use of lethal controls. Most wildlife encountered in damage situations (5.1%) are dispersed rather than killed. Removal of native foxes/cyotes and non-native species, such as European starlings, feral swine and nutria, account for most of the animals removed. A 20-member National Wildlife Services Advisory Committee, appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture, advises the program and serves as a public forum. Criticism Wildlife Services has been the subject of widespread criticism on the part of conservation and wildlife protection organizations such as Defenders of Wildlife, Center for Biological Diversity, Predator Defense, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and others. These groups argue that Wildlife Services is not justified in killing millions of predators and other animals each year given the lack of evidence that these animals pose a threat to the public. Furthermore, the groups claim that this killing is conducted on behalf of the livestock industry rather than public safety and has resulted in the imperilment and near-extinction of dozens of species. Wildlife Services has also received criticism for its use of the M44 cyanide device for killing coyotes/fox and other Canids, as several incidents have occurred with family pets being killed as well as a male adult and a child almost killed from cyanide poisoning. A 2014 article in the Washington Post detailed Wildlife Services' extermination of 4 million animals in 2013, many of which were killed en masse. Amy Atwood, of the Center for Biological Diversity, was quoted in the article describing Wildlife Services' work as “a staggering killing campaign, bankrolled by taxpayers.” In fiscal year 2014, 2.7 million animals were reported as killed by Wildlife Services. Programs The Wildlife Services Operational Program provides wildlife damage management assistance to the public, and is administered through two Regional Offices (Fort Collins, Colorado, and Raleigh, North Carolina) as well as state and district offices in the 50 states, District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam. Program wildlife biologists provide technical advice and direct management assistance to individuals with problems related to wildlife. The public may access Wildlife Services assistance by calling 1-800/4USDA-WS (1-866-487-3297). The Airport Wildlife Hazards Program provides leadership in addressing the conditions that contribute to aircraft-wildlife strikes throughout the country. It works with the civil and military aviation community, specifically airports, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to minimize wildlife strikes to aircraft and protect public safety. The National Environmental Program ensures that program activities comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires federal agencies to evaluate environmental impacts within their decision-making processes. It ensures that environmental information is available to public officials and citizens before making decisions and taking actions. To fulfill this responsibility, Wildlife Services prepares analyses of the environmental effects of program activities. The National Rabies Management Program, a multi-agency cooperative program led by Wildlife Services, implements a coordinated program to contain and eventually manage rabies in wildlife. With partners, the program conducts rabies control efforts in 25 states, including distributing oral rabies vaccination (ORV) or conducting enhanced wildlife rabies surveillance. The focus is on specific rabies virus strains in raccoons, coyotes, gray foxes, and feral dogs. It works closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Canadian and Mexican partners through the North American Rabies Management Plan. The National Wildlife Disease Program safeguards agricultural trade by conducting surveillance activities in all 50 states in partnership with other organizations and promotes development of wildlife disease monitoring programs worldwide. Its Surveillance and Emergency Response System is the country’s only comprehensive, nationally coordinated system with the capability of addressing diseases in wildlife. Its wildlife disease biologists can mobilize and arrive on-site within 48 hours of a request. The program represents APHIS’ first line of defense against wildlife diseases that can move to humans and livestock. The National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC) is devoted to resolving problems caused by the interaction of wild animals and society. NWRC applies scientific expertise to develop practical methods to resolve these problems and to maintain the quality of environments shared with wildlife. It evaluates damage situations and develops methods and tools to reduce or eliminate damage and resolve land-use conflicts. NWRC scientists study birds, mammalian predators, rodents, and other wildlife that cause serious, but localized, damage problems. It conducts studies to ensure that the methods developed are biologically sound, effective, safe, economical, and socially responsible. NWRC scientists produce the appropriate methods, technology, and materials for reducing animal damage. Through the publication of results and the exchange of technical information, NWRC provides valuable data and expertise to the public and the scientific community, as well as to APHIS's Wildlife Services program.

It is dedicated to St Patrick, and is valued in the Liber Regis at £22 (around £7,700,000 in today's money). Patron, the master and fellows of Clare hall, Cambridge. The manor of Patrington was held from 1033-1545 by the Archbishops of York, who were granted a charter for a market in 1223. It was a wealthy manor, including a minor port on the Humber and remaining the market town for South Holderness until the later 19th century. It was this wealth that funded the complete rebuilding of the parish church in a relatively short time, giving it a unity and quality much admired by architectural historians and church visitors such as Nikolaus Pevsner and Simon Jenkins. The church is often referred to as ‘The Queen of Holderness’. It is cruciform, 150 feet in length, and consists of a four-bay aisled nave, two-bay aisled transepts, a four-bay aisle-less chancel, and a crossing tower with a spire reaching 180 feet. Fragments of earlier churches on the site remain; e.g., pieces of Norman masonry in the nave walls, a few early 13th century pier bases, and later 13th century work in the lower parts of the south transept. Evidence in the bases of the nave arcades, the west responds, and the lower parts of the crossing piers indicates a major reconstruction which was begun , but probably did not go far. The present building was begun , the work commencing with the south transept. This was completed by about 1310, and work turned to the north transept, completed by about 1320. The crossing tower was built next, then the nave arcades from . The 1340s saw the construction of the nave aisle walls and the chancel. This meant the near-completion of the church as it is today: only the east window and the spire remained to be built. But these had to wait, for work ceased in the late 1340s, as in so many cases across England, because of the Black Death. They would be in place by 1400. Architecture and fittings The church is thus uniformly of the Decorated style, other than the two exceptions just discussed. The tracery of the earliest windows, those of the transept fronts, has left the simple geometrical forms behind but is not yet flowing: it instead consists of foiled spherical triangles (encircled in the larger windows) and unencircled pointed quatrefoils. The north transept front has a small doorway with a stone roof. A Lady Chapel in the form of a shallow three- sided apse projects from the centre of the east wall of the south transept. The nave has a south and a north porch, and flowing tracery in the three-light aisle windows. The five-light great west window also has flowing tracery, though inaccurately restored in 1885. The aisle-less chancel has four large windows on each side, reticulated forms alternating with flowing forms of Lincolnshire type. The great east window, blank below the central transom, is most emphatically Perpendicular. Pinnacled buttresses are employed throughout, those of the transepts being provided with niches and full-length grotesques. The apex of each gable carries a cross. The crossing tower is of three stages, the lower stage (corresponding to the roofs) blank, the second with only very thin single lancets, and the upper with four large blank arches filling each side. From this rises a Perpendicular spire embraced at its base by an arcaded octagonal screen, tied by thin flying buttresses to corner pinnacles on the tower. Jenkins praises this as ‘a device of great delicacy’, and the whole composition as perfect in proportion with the nave and transepts. Pevsner calls the spire ‘one of the finest in the country, not at all showy, but wonderfully satisfying’. The interior is as unified as the exterior. Clustered piers rise to foliate capitals, the foliage more stylized here than on the naturalistic capitals of several decades before. The arches have the complicated mouldings typical of the period. The aisles of the south transept and nave are all vaulted in stone. Only the vault of the east aisle of the south transept is original. The rest of the roofs consist of thin and closely spaced arched brace trusses forming pointed arches, very simple and harmonious. These are original, though the chancel roof has been restored. The Lady Chapel in the form of a small apse in the south transept aisle has an original structural stone reredos, its own stone vault, and a very fine late 13th century statue of the Virgin and Child. (This statue, relocated from the exterior below the east window, has been 'linked stylistically' by Pevsner to a similar statue over the south door of St Mary's Church, Welwick, and attributed to a school of Beverley masons who produced numerous sculptures and monuments in the area, including the famous Percy tomb in Beverley Minster.) An extra bay between the crossing and the chancel arch, corresponding to the transept aisles, adds a surprisingly satisfying depth to the composition. In the chancel are sedilia and piscina with low ogee gables and much crocketing, opposite a stone Easter Sepulchre in the same spirit. A most unusual feature is the tower stairway in the south transept, which emerges into the open through doorways above both the east and west arcades. It ascends both sides of the crossing arch, the steps forming a bold zigzag pattern, and continues up through a door above the apex of the arch. The corbels supporting the stairs are richly carved. The font is positioned centrally at the west end of the church. It is Decorated, twelve-sided, ornately carved with crocketed gables. Pevsner states that two of the benches at the western end are 17th century; the rest presumably are modern. The pulpit, heavily restored, is dated 1612. The chancel screen is of the late 14th century. A large reredos of gilded oak with twelve Northumbrian saints and the Virgin fills the space below the east window. It is of 1936 by J. Harold Gibbons.

It is native to deep river channels in the Río Huallaga, Río Napo, and Río Amazonas in Peru, and in the Río Orinoco in Venezuela. Many specimens once identified as S. porcinum from the Brazilian Amazon Basin and the Venezuelan Orinoco are now known to be a different species, S. preto. S. porcium is distinguishable from all other Sternarchogiton species by the straight dorsal profile of its laterally compressed head. The eyes are small and covered by a thin membrane. The mouth is terminal, with the upper jaw longer than the lower. There are no teeth on the premaxilla and one row of 11 tiny conical teeth on the dentary. Both upper and lower pharyngeal tooth plates are present, bearing 8 and 10 teeth respectively. There is no sexual dimorphism in cranial morphology. The body is compressed and knife-shaped, with 4-6 rows of scales above the lateral line. The pectoral fins are broad and pointed, containing 15-18 soft rays. The long anal fin contains 182-216 rays. The tail is compressed and moderately long, terminating in a small lanceolate caudal fin with 14-22 rays. The whip-like dorsal electroreceptive appendage inserts in the posterior half of the body. The coloration is uniform white on the sides, tinged pink due to underlying capillaries. The back of the body and head are brown, with white-pink scale margins and white electroreceptor pits. The upper and lower jaws are white. The fins are hyaline, becoming dark brown or grayish black at the margins. The maximum known length is 30 cm. Like other apteronotids, S. porcium generates a weak electric field for electrolocation and communication. This electric organ discharge has a fundamental frequency around 900 Hz and has a waveform similar to that of S. nattereri. Like S. nattereri, S. porcinum is able to modulate the frequency and amplitude of its EOD to produce communication signals categorized as \\"chirps\\" (high frequency elevation, short duration) and \\"gradual frequency rises\\" (low frequency elevation, long duration).

Variants include \\"Lenighan”, \\"Lenegan\\", “Lenahan”, and \\"Lennihan.\\" People with the name include: A Roscommon family of this name, in Irish O Leanachain, appears in early records, the most notable of whom was Maelciaran O'Lenechan of Tuamna, in Boyle barony, a priest very highly praised in the \\"Annals of Loch Ce\\" and by the Four Masters for his numerous good qualities: he died in 1249. Little is heard of them in modern times. Kinehan or Lenihan as it is also spelt, is now regarded as belonging primarily to Counties Limerick and Tipperary. Maurice Lenihan (1811–1895), author of the History of Limerick, is the most notable bearer of the name. Lenihan, Lenehan, Lenahan, and Linehan are anglicized versions of the Irish Ó Leanachain, possibly from leanach, meaning \\"sorrowful\\". It appears to have arisen separately in two localities, in County Roscommon in the west, and in the south in the Limerick/Tipperary region. Bearers of the surname are found in both areas today, but it is most common in the south. Although born in Waterford, Maurice Lenihan (1811–1895) is closely associated with his adopted city of Limerick. A campaigning nationalist journalist, he was editor and proprietor of the Limerick Reporter for more than 40 years and is now best remembered as the author of Limerick: Its History and Antiquities (1860). The most prominent contemporaries of the name are Brian Lenihan (1924–1992) and his younger sister Mrs. Mary O'Rourke, of the Roscommon family, who both served in a variety of ministerial positions in the Irish government from the 1970s through to the 1990s. Lenaghan Quite numerous: Down etc. See Lenihan. Leneghan rare: Mayo, Down. See Lenihan. Lenehan numerous: Midlands, Mayo-Sligo etc. See Lenihan. Lenihan numerous: all areas except Ulster, mainly Kerry-Clare-W Limerick-Cork. The Irish is (1) Ó Leannacháin (2) Ó Luingeacháin. The former relates to a Roscommon sept; the latter to Munster and comes, according to Woulfe, from earlier Mac Longacháin where longach may be gluttonous, avid. Note the variants. IF & SGG.

He went on to appear in 29 of their remaining 33 League games that season.Calley, p. 176 He also became possibly the first Blackpool player to be sent off in a League game.

Threlfall later complained that he had not been cautioned \\"before the referee took this extreme course\\". In 1901–02, Threlfall missed only two of Blackpool's 34 League games. He also scored his first goal for the club, in a 1–1 draw at home to Glossop North End on 1 February.Calley, p. 178 He made 26 League appearances in 1902–03, including one game at right-back while Bob Birkett was unavailable.

The real RAM was formulated by Michael Ian Shamos in his 1978 Ph.D. dissertation.. Model The \\"RAM\\" part of the real RAM model name stands for \\"random access machine\\". This is a model of computing that resembles a simplified version of a standard computer architecture. It consists of a stored program, a computer memory unit consisting of an array of cells, and a central processing unit with a bounded number of registers. Each memory cell or register can store a real number. Under the control of the program, the real RAM can transfer real numbers between memory and registers, and perform arithmetic operations on the values stored in the registers. The allowed operations typically include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as comparisons, but not modulus or rounding to integers. The reason for avoiding integer rounding and modulus operations is that allowing these operations could give the real RAM unreasonable amounts of computational power, enabling it to solve PSPACE-complete problems in polynomial time.. When analyzing algorithms for the real RAM, each allowed operation is typically assumed to take constant time. Implementation Software libraries such as LEDA have been developed which allow programmers to write computer programs that work as if they were running on a real RAM. These libraries represent real values using data structures which allow them to perform arithmetic and comparisons with the same results as a real RAM would produce. For example, In LEDA, real numbers are represented using the \`leda_real\` datatype, which supports k-th roots for any natural number k, rational operators, and comparison operators. The time analysis of the underlying real RAM algorithm using these real datatypes can be interpreted as counting the number of library calls needed by a given algorithm.. Related models The real RAM closely resembles the later Blum–Shub–Smale machine.. However, the real RAM is typically used for the analysis of concrete algorithms in computational geometry, while the Blum–Shub–Smale machine instead forms the basis for extensions of the theory of NP-completeness to real-number computation. An alternative to the real RAM is the word RAM, in which both the inputs to a problem and the values stored in memory and registers are assumed to be integers with a fixed number of bits. The word RAM model can perform some operations more quickly than the real RAM; for instance, it allows fast integer sorting algorithms, while sorting on the real RAM must be done with slower comparison sorting algorithms. However, some computational geometry problems have inputs or outputs that cannot be represented exactly using integer coordinates; see for instance the Perles configuration, an arrangement of points and line segments that has no integer- coordinate representation.

It is one of the most widely used models of Grey system theory. GRA uses a specific concept of information. It defines situations with no information as black, and those with perfect information as white. However, neither of these idealized situations ever occurs in real world problems. In fact, situations between these extremes, which contain Dispersed knowledge (partial information), are described as being grey, hazy or fuzzy. A variant of GRA model, Taguchi-based GRA model, is very popular in engineering. Grey System Theory GRA is an important part of grey system theory pioneered by Professor Deng in 1982. A grey system means that a system in which part of information is known and part of information is unknown. With this definition, information quantity and quality form a continuum from a total lack of information to complete information – from black through grey to white. Since uncertainty always exists, one is always somewhere in the middle, somewhere between the extremes, somewhere in the grey area. Grey analysis then comes to a clear set of statements about system solutions. At one extreme, no solution can be defined for a system with no information. At the other extreme, a system with perfect information has a unique solution. In the middle, grey systems will give a variety of available solutions. Grey analysis does not attempt to find the best solution, but does provide techniques for determining a good solution, an appropriate solution for real world problems. The theory inspired many noted scholars and business leaders like Jeffrey Yi- Lin Forrest, Sifeng Liu, Ren Zhengfei and Joseph L. Badaracco, a professor at Harvard Business School. Dr. Sifeng Liu, the pupil of Deng, building upon the work of Deng's GRA model proposed his own Absolute GRA model. In 2018, Liu and his doctoral student merged Deng's GRA model and Absolute GRA model to propose the Second Synthetic GRA model. The theory has been applied in various field of engineering and management. Initially, the grey method was adapted to effectively study air pollution and subsequently used to investigate the nonlinear multiple-dimensional model of the socio-economic activities’ impact on the city air pollution. It has also been used to study the research output and growth of countries. In the world there are many universities, associations and societies promoting Grey System Theory e.g., International Association of Grey Systems and Decision Sciences (IAGSUA), Chinese Grey System Association (CGSA), Grey Systems Society of China (GSSC), Grey Systems Society of Pakistan (GSSP), Polish Scientific Society of Grey Systems (PSGS), Grey Systems Committee (IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society), Centre for Computational Intelligence (De Montfort University) etc. There are several journals dedicated to grey systems research and studies e.g., \\"The Journal of Grey System\\" (UK), \\"Grey Systems Theory and Application\\" (Emerald Group Publishing), \\"Journal of Grey System\\" (Taiwan), \\"Grey Room\\" (MIT Press), \\"The Grey Journal\\", \\"Grey Matters\\", Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, Kybernetes, etc. References * Chan WK and Tong TKL, (2007), Multi-criteria material selections and end-of-life product strategy: Grey relational analysis approach, Materials & Design, Volume 28, Issue 5, Pages 1539-1546 * Free Multi-criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA) Tools for Research Students http://sites.google.com/site/mcdafreeware/ Category:Information theory ","title":"Grey relational analysis"},{"id":"20748378","text":"Sven Evert Gunnarsson (born 28 December 1929) is a retired Swedish rower.

He was a founder and organizer of the Emergency Association of German Science, and he was a member of the \\"Senate\\" of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, the Reich Physical and Technical Institute, and the Reich Chemical and Technical Institute. When he was forced out of academia in 1933 due to his opposition to National Socialism, he became an advisor in the industrial sector, especially the Troisdorf Works. After World War II, Konen became rector of University of Bonn and then headed the Culture Ministry of North Rhine-Westphalia. Education From 1893 to 1898, Konen studied at the University of Bonn. He was awarded his doctorate there in 1897.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Konen. Career From 1899, Konen was a teaching assistant at University of Bonn. From 1902, he was a Privatdozent there, as well as a part- time teacher at the Bonn Gymnasium (secondary school). Konen was an ausserordentlicher Professor of theoretical physics at University of Münster from 1905 to 1912, and from 1919 to 1920 he was an ordentlicher Professor there. In 1920, due to his relationship with Friedrich Schmidt-Ott, Konen was involved in the founding and organization of the Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft (NG, Emergency Association of German Science) and he became a longstanding member of its main committee. In 1920, he also succeeded Heinrich Kayser as ordentlicher Professor at the University of Bonn. From 1927 to 1929, he additionally was president of the German Physical Society. Konen’s opposition to National Socialism resulted in his forced retirement from academia in 1933, the year Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Also until 1933, he was on the supervisory board of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, an influential member of the board of trustees of the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt (PTR, Reich Physical and Technical Institute – today, the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt), on the board of trustees of the Chemisch-Technische Reichsanstalt (CTR, Reich Chemical and Technical Institute), and on the board of the Deutsches Museum in Munich. When Konen left academia, he became an advisor in industry, especially for Troisdorfer Werke (Dynamit Nobel AG, a chemical and weapons company whose headquarters was in Troisdorf). At University of Bonn, Konen was the Doktorvater (doctoral advisor) to Wolfgang Finkelnburg, who received his doctorate in 1928. Finkelnburg would go on to play a major role in the campaign against and political victory over the Deutsche Physik movement, as the organizer of the Münchner Religionsgespräche, known as the “Munich Synod.” Beyerchen, 1977, 176-179. After 1945, Konen became rector of University of Bonn and then headed the Culture Ministry of North Rhine-Westphalia. In 1949, after formation of the Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Konen used his position in the Culture Ministry to re-found the Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft, which had become inactive in 1945.

He was also instrumental in the Absolutist repression after the restoration of Ferdinand VII as King of Spain. For this, he was executed during the Trienio Liberal. Viceroy of Río de la Plata Francisco Javier de Elío was governor of Montevideo between 1807 and 1809, when he plotted with Martín de Álzaga against his superior Santiago de Liniers, Viceroy of the Río de la Plata. This failed because Liniers was supported by Cornelio Saavedra and criollo militias. In May 1810, Liniers' successor Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros was deposed by the May Revolution. Elío remained in control of Montevideo and the Banda Oriental and declared himself Viceroy of Río de la Plata, which was confirmed by the Junta of Cádiz on January 19, 1811. One month later the rural population of the Banda Oriental under José Gervasio Artigas also rebelled against Spain, and in May the troops of Elío were beaten in the Battle of Las Piedras. Only left in control of Colonia del Sacramento and Montevideo, Elío returned to Spain on November 18, 1811, and resigned as Viceroy in January 1812. Back in Spain When King Ferdinand VII of Spain returned in 1814 from exile in France, he was requested by the Cortes to respect the liberal Spanish Constitution of 1812, which seriously limited the royal powers. Ferdinand refused and went to Valencia instead of Madrid. Here, on April 17, general Elío invited the King to reclaim his absolute rights and put his troops at the King's disposition. A fervent follower of the absolutist cause, Elío played an important role in the repression of the supporters of the Constitution of 1812. For this, he was arrested during the Trienio Liberal and executed.

VDI Reihe 3, 243, 1–154, 1991. is an estimation method for the calculation of phase equilibria of mixtures of chemical components. The original goal for the development of this method was to enable the estimation of properties of mixtures containing supercritical components. This class of substances cannot be predicted with established models, for example UNIFAC.  Principle  PSRK is a group- contribution equation of state. This is a class of prediction methods that combines equations of state (mostly cubic) with activity coefficient models based on group contributions, such as UNIFAC. The activity coefficient model is used to adapt the equation-of-state parameters for mixtures by a so-called mixing rule. The use of an equation of state introduces all thermodynamic relations defined for equations of state into the PRSK model. This allows the calculation of densities, enthalpies, heat capacities, and other properties.  Equations  As stated previously, the PSRK model is based on a combination of the Soave–Redlich–Kwong equation of state with a mixing rule whose parameters are determined by the UNIFAC method. = Equation of state = The equation of state of Soave is defined as follows: : P = \\\\frac{RT}{v - b} - \\\\frac{a \\\\alpha(T)}{v(v + b)}. The original α-function has been replaced by the function of Mathias–Copeman:Mathias P. M., Copeman T. W., “Extension of the Peng-Robinson Equation of State to Complex Mixtures: Evaluation of the Various Forms of the Local Composition Concept”, Fluid Phase Equilib., 13, 91–108, 1983. , . : \\\\alpha(T_r) = \\\\left[1 + c_1 \\\\left(1 - \\\\sqrt{T_r}\\\\right) + c_2 \\\\left(1 - \\\\sqrt{T_r}\\\\right)^2 + c_3 \\\\left(1 - \\\\sqrt{T_r}\\\\right)^3 \\\\right]^2. The parameters of the Mathias–Copeman equation are fitted to experimental vapor-pressure data of pure components and provide a better description of the vapor pressure than the original relation. The form of the equation is chosen as it can be reduced to the original Soave form by setting the parameters c2 and c3 to zero. Additionally, the parameter c1 can be obtained from the acentric factor, using the relation : c_1 = 0.48 + 1.574 \\\\, \\\\omega - 0.176 \\\\, \\\\omega^2. This may be performed if no fitted Mathias–Copeman parameter is available. = Mixing rule = The PSRK mixing rule calculates the parameters a and b of the equation of state by : \\\\frac{a}{bRT} = \\\\sum_i x_i \\\\frac{a_i}{b_i RT} - \\\\frac{\\\\frac{g^E_0}{R T} + \\\\sum x_i \\\\ln \\\\frac{b}{b_i}}{0.64663} and : b = \\\\sum_i x_i b_i, where the parameters ai and bi are those of the pure substances, their mole fractions are given by xi, and the excess Gibbs energy by gE. The excess Gibbs energy is calculated by a slightly modified UNIFAC model.  Model parameters  For the equation of state PSRK needs the critical temperature and pressure, additionally at a minimum the acentric factor for all pure components in the considered mixture is also required. The integrity of the model can be improved if the acentric factor is replaced by Mathias–Copeman constants fitted to experimental vapor- pressure data of pure components. The mixing rule uses UNIFAC, which needs a variety of UNIFAC-specific parameters. Aside from some model constants, the most important parameters are the group-interaction parameters — these are obtained from parametric fits to experimental vapor–liquid equilibria of mixtures. Hence, for high-quality model parameters, experimental data (pure- component vapor pressures and VLE of mixtures) are needed. These are normally provided by factual data banks, like the Dortmund Data Bank, which has been the base for the PSRK development. In few cases additionally needed data have been determined experimentally if no data have been available from other sources. The latest available parameters have been published in 2005.Horstmann S., Jabloniec A., Krafczyk J., Fischer K., Gmehling J., “PSRK Group Contribution Equation of State: Comprehensive Revision and Extension IV, Including Critical Constants and α-Function Parameters for 1000 Components”, Fluid Phase Equilib., 227(2), 157–164, 2005. The further development is now taken over by the UNIFAC Consortium.  Example calculation  Vapor–liquid equilibrium of cyclohexane and carbon dioxide The prediction of a vapor–liquid equilibrium is successful even in mixtures containing supercritical components. However, the mixture has to be subcritical. In the given example carbon dioxide is the supercritical component with Tc = 304.19 KAmbrose D., Trans. Faraday Soc., 52, 772-781, 1956. , . and Pc = 7475 kPa.Schmidt E., Thomas W., Forsch. Geb. Ingenieurwes. Ausg. A , 20, 161–170, 1954. The critical point of the mixture lies at T = 411 K and P ≈ 15000 kPa. The composition of the mixture is near 78 mole% carbon dioxide and 22 mole% cyclohexane. PSRK describes this binary mixture quite well, the dew point curve, as well as the bubble point curve and the critical point of the mixture.  Model weaknesses  In a PSRK follow-up workAhlers J., “Entwicklung einer universellen Gruppenbeitragszustandsgleichung”, Thesis, Carl-von-Ossietzky-Universität Oldenburg, 1–144, 2003. (VTPR) some model weaknesses are quoted: * The gradient of the Mathias–Copeman α-function is without any thermodynamic background and, if extrapolated to higher temperatures, the described vapor-pressure curve tends to diverge. * The Soave–Redlich–Kwong equation of state describes the vapor densities of pure components and mixtures quite well, but the deviations of the liquid-density prediction are high. * For the VLE prediction of mixtures with components that have very differing sizes (e. g. ethanol, C2H6O, and eicosane, C20H42) larger systematic errors are found. * Heats of mixing and activity coefficients at infinite dilution are predicted poorly.

With the support of Father Urbschat, a preacher of the Mucher movement, she received a formal training as a nursery nurse. She worked from 1877 as a deaconess and from 1887 as a Red Cross Sister in Hamburg, and later in Vienna. In 1897 she married Otto Gustav Wolff in Hamburg. With Agnes Miegel she was an important figure of East Prussian women's literature. She was influenced by the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, Detlev von Liliencron and Richard Dehmel. Johanna Wolff's first published work was Namenlos - Frauenlieder in 1896 during her time in Vienna. Her most successful work was the autobiographical novel Hanneken: Ein Buch der Armut und Arbeit (1912). Until 1939 she published numerous poetry books, plays and novels.

The island lies about off the coast of Nasugbu in Batangas. Ownership and development \\"Ruins\\" patterned after Ancient Greek architecture on Fortune Island. Fortune Island was once a private island owned by Laurentina Pestano. It was turned over to the government and the island is now owned by José Antonio Leviste, a former governor of Batangas. Leviste opened the Fortune Island Resort Club on the island in 1995. The beach resort was built along a stretch of pristine white sand. Several rest houses face the water. The resort features a salt water swimming pool, clubhouse, cabana, basketball court, helipad, desalinator for freshwater consumption, and a small serpentarium, a reptile zoo for snakes. The beach also has an acropolis with Grecian pillars and statues on the edge of the island overlooking the sea. There is also a museum dedicated to the San Diego, a Spanish warship that sank off the island (see below). This island has since been parceled out into seven lots reportedly titled in the names of three companies: Fortune Resort Club, Inc., Meridian Pacific Hotel Corp., and Batangas Bay Development, Inc. Leviste holds either majority stocks or has interests in these companies. Some government officials believe that Leviste's ownership of Fortune Island underwent “scheming procedures” to acquire both judicial and administrative titles. These officials believe that these titles should never have been granted for two reasons; firstly, the island is classified as a marine reserve under Proclamation 1801, issued in 1978 by President Ferdinand Marcos and, secondly, Section 16 of Presidential Decree 705 (the Revised Forestry Code), which provides that \\"areas less than 250 hectares which are far from, or are not contiguous with, any certified alienable and disposable land\\" are \\"areas needed for forest purposes and may not, therefore, be classified as alienable and disposable land.\\" Some government officials further contend that subdividing Fortune Island into lots was a \\"ploy\\" to skirt environmental and other pertinent laws. Shipwrecks It was near this island (approximately northwest of the island) that the galleon San Diego was sunk on December 14, 1600 by the Dutch warship Mauritius under the command of Admiral Oliver Van Noort. The shipwreck was discovered in 1992 by French underwater archaeologist Franck Goddio. The island has also been the site of modern shipwrecks. On December 13, 1995, the MV Kimelody Cristy, a passenger ferry owned and operated by Moreta Shipping Lines Incorporated, caught fire and sank off Fortune Island as it was on its way to Mindoro, leaving 17 people dead and 16 people missing. On September 18, 1998, the MV Princess of the Orient, a passenger ferry owned by Sulpicio Lines, sailed during a typhoon on its way to Cebu City from Manila and sank off Fortune Island, resulting in the deaths of 70 people.List of maritime disasters in the Philippines ReferencesExternal links * Category:Islands of Batangas Category:Resorts in the Philippines Category:Beaches of the Philippines Category:Tourist attractions in Batangas ","title":"Fortune Island (Philippines)"},{"id":"20748484","text":"Teeling may refer to: In people: * Bartholomew Teeling (1774–1798), a leader of the Irish forces during the Irish Rebellion of 1798 * Charles Teeling (1778–1850), an Irish journalist and writer * Emma Teeling, an Irish zoologist and geneticist, specialising in studies of bats * William Teeling (1903–1975), an Irish author, traveller and United Kingdom politician In other uses: * Teeling Column, one of the four armed units devised by Seán Cronin for the Border Campaign in the west of Ireland * Teeling Distillery, an Irish whiskey distillery established in Dublin in 2015 ","title":"Teeling"},{"id":"20748499","text":"Christopher Long may refer to: *Christopher P.

George Barnley, a Wesleyan minister who had been in Moose Factory from 1840 to 1848. The bishop sent an English schoolteacher, John Horden who arrived on August 26, 1851, with his bride. Horden set about learning the local Cree language and translating portions of the Bible, the Book of Common Prayer and hymns into it. He also started a school and started holding services for what would become St. Thomas' Church.

History In 1742, the town of Bladensburg became the first governmental entity to pass a fire prevention ordinance. The simple ordinance stipulated that all residential and commercial buildings had to be equipped with a smoke chimney. In 1886, the town of Hyattsville organized the first volunteer fire company in the county. With a donated budget of $27, the fire company bought a two-wheeled hand truck equipped with a barrel, pump, and hose. Two years later, in 1888, the town of Upper Marlboro organized the Marlboro Fire Association following two major town fires. John C. Wyvill had the first fire station built at a cost of $342. It wasn't until the 1930s that the County organized its fire services at is known today. The University of Maryland created a Fire Service Extension to train firefighters and is widely regarded as a focal point for fire training for departments located east of the Mississippi River. In 1966 the county incorporated paid firefighters within its volunteer force based on the Yarger Study which stated: *At least two \\"paidmen\\" at each station. *All paid firefighters should be county employees. *A unified command structure should be developed under the direction of a County fire chief. *Fire communications should be consolidated under the County fire chief.

De la Rosa joined the Baltimore Orioles organization in 1988, and went 3–4 with a 4.61 ERA for the Hagerstown Suns of the Carolina League. Though he had been used primarily as a reliever, he was converted to a starter with Hagerstown in 1990, now of the double A Eastern League. In that role, De la Rosa was 9–5 with a 2.06 ERA. After compiling a 4–1 record with a 2.67 ERA for the triple A Rochester Red Wings in 1991, De la Rosa received a September call-up to the Orioles, making his Major League debut on September 7 against the Kansas City Royals. Inheriting a bases loaded, two out situation, he retired Bill Pecota on a fly ball to left to end the eighth inning. He then loaded the bases himself in the ninth before escaping the inning without giving up a run. De la Rosa's next appearance came a month later against the New York Yankees. Entering the game with the Yankees having already scored five runs in the third inning, De la Rosa recorded the final two outs of the inning without giving up another run. He pitched a perfect fourth before the Yankees got to him for three runs in the fifth. Prior to the start of the 1992 season, the Orioles sent De la Rosa to the Yankees to complete an earlier deal in which they acquired Alan Mills for a player to be named later. In two seasons with the Yankees' triple A affiliate, the Columbus Clippers, De la Rosa was 7–2 with a 4.93 ERA. De la Rosa pitched for the St. Louis Cardinals' Triple-A affiliate, the Louisville Redbirds in 1995, and the Thunder Bay Whiskey Jacks of the independent Northern League in 1996. He also played for a long time with the Estrellas Orientales of the Dominican Winter Baseball League, earning the nickname \\"Tiger Tamer\\" for his performance against the Licey Tigers. De la Rosa continued to pitch in independent leagues in New York City and Philadelphia before moving to Baltimore, Maryland, where he lived with his brothers until his death at 44.

The Mausoleum of the Yellow Emperor () is the burial site of the legendary Yellow Emperor (Huangdi) of China. It is located in Huangling County, Yan'an City, Shaanxi Province, China. According to legend, the Yellow Emperor attained immortality and rose to Heaven, leaving behind only his clothing and cap to be entombed. The mausoleum is located on Qiao Mountain, north of Yan'an proper. In 1961, the Chinese State Council proclaimed it as the first National State-Protected Great Cultural Site, with the identifier \\"Ancient Tomb #1\\" and the moniker \\"The First Tomb Under Heaven\\". The mausoleum was anciently called \\"Qiao Tomb\\", and was an important location where generations of emperors and famous people made offerings to the Yellow Emperor. According to historical records, the earliest offerings to the Yellow Emperor at the mausoleum's location began in 442 BC. From the establishment of a shrine proper in the year 770 during the Tang dynasty, it was the scene of regular national offerings and sacrifices. The site has been rebuilt and restored several times, most recently beginning in 1993. The Yellow Emperor Mausoleum Foundation was established to raise money for the reconstruction process, which was divided into two phases. The first phase was completed in August 2001, and in 2004 yearly national offerings to the Yellow Emperor at the mausoleum resumed. Scenic area The Yellow Emperor Mausoleum Scenic Area covers an area of approximately 333 hectares and is classified as a highest level scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration. It contains over 60,000 mature cypress trees, of which 30,000 are over one thousand years old, making the area one of the best old cypress forests in China. The scenic area is divided into two parts: the Huangdi tomb area and the Xuanyuan Temple area. =Tomb area= \\"Immortal Han Wu Altar\\" (漢武仙台). On the right side of the stone path leading to the Tomb Area lies a stone entitled the \\"Horse-Dismounting Stone\\". Upon the stone is written in Chinese calligraphy the words \\"Wen and Wu and their officials arrived at this point and dismounted their horses\\", a reference to Kings Wen and Wu of the Zhou dynasty. Nearer to the Tomb lies the \\"Immortal Han Wu Altar\\". According to tradition, as Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty was returning from a northern campaign against the Xiongnu, he stopped at the mausoleum and made offerings. The current mausoleum is 3.6 meters tall, 48 meters in circumference, and is surrounded by a brick wall. On the south side stands a Ming dynasty stone stele that reads \\"Qiao Mountain Dragon Rider\\" (), a reference to the story of the Yellow Emperor and his family riding into the west on a golden dragon.http://www.xiancn.com/zt/content/2010-03/24/content_2066768.htm The eastern side's stele hallway preserves 57 Imperial stele commissioned by various emperors. On the western side stand returned commemoration stele from Hong Kong and Macao. In the main hall, called the \\"Great Hall of Man and Civilizations's First Ancestor\\" (), stands a relief sculpture of the Yellow Emperor, as well as a niche shrine decorated with the four great spirit animals of Chinese astrology: the Azure Dragon, the White Tiger, the Vermilion Bird, and the Black Tortoise. In the memorial pavilion are arranged several dedicatory inscriptions from modern Chinese leaders Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai- shek, Mao Zedong, and Deng Xiaoping. In front of the tomb is a pavilion for offerings, in the middle of which stands a stone stele with the three characters \\"Yellow Emperor Mausoleum\\". The stele was erected by Chiang Kai- shek during the Second Sino-Japanese War but was chiseled blank in 1956 before being restored in 1963 by Guo Moruo. =Xuanyuan Temple= Xuanyuan Temple Xuanyuan Temple (轩辕庙 Xuānyuánmiào), named after the Yellow Emperor's personal name \\"Xuanyuan\\" recorded in the Shiji, is a temple dedicated to the religion of Huangdi in Huangling, and the largest of such temples in China (there are other smaller Xuanyuanmiao throughout the country). Construction of the temple started during the post-1993 restoration works of Huangling. The shrine is approximately 8,000 square meters in size and is made entirely of granite. Its central building is called the Hall of Xuanyuan (轩辕殿 Xuānyuándiàn). Yearly sacrifices are held at the temple. Past offerings and restorations The emperors of Chinese dynasties venerated the Yellow Emperor's mausoleum, and most would dispatch a closely trusted high-ranked official, bearing an imperial monument written by the emperor himself, to conduct the ceremonies. *220 BC: Tradition states that Qin Shi Huang, after subduing the other Chinese states and proclaiming himself emperor, personally carried offerings and his sword to the Yellow Emperor's temple to seclude himself and offer prayers. *110 BC: In the tenth lunar month, Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty led 180,000 troops to make offerings at the Yellow Emperor's tomb and set up the \\"Immortal's Altar\\" mentioned above. *During the Tang dynasty, the traditional sacrifices to the Yellow Emperor were officially adopted by the state. *1040 to 1043: during the reign of Emperor Renzong in the Song dynasty, the minister Fan Zhongyan made ceremonial sacrifice there three times. *1061: Emperor Renzong of the Song dynasty decreed the mass planting of cypress trees at the complex. *1325: During the Yuan dynasty, the Mongol emperor Yesün Temür issued a decree protecting the tomb site. *1371: The Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty sent imperial historian Guan Gougan to officiate an offering. *1651: The Shunzhi Emperor of the Qing dynasty had numerous veneration ceremonies for the Yellow Emperor conducted. *1911: Following the Xinhai Revolution, the Nationalist government of the Republic of China continued the tradition of making offerings at the Yellow Emperor's mausoleum.

The book was published in 1988 and written by Scott Haring, with cover and interior art by Jeff Easley.Haring, Scott. Empires of the Sands (TSR, 1988)  Contents  The sixty-four page booklet, which is wrapped in a removable cover, includes a one page introduction, explaining that this book covers three major areas of in the southwest corner of the continent of Faerûn known as the Empires of the Sands: Amn (pages 3–20), Tethyr (pages 21–47), and Calimshan (pages 48–62). Each of the nations located along the southern coast of the Sea of Swords, an area with a warm climate and large areas of dry, inhospitable land, receives its own section, and each section begins with a general description including the races present, followed by information covering their languages, social customs, monsters, history, government and politics, religions, geography and climate, trade, cities, places of interest, and important characters. Most cities receive only a column of text on the average, with some descriptions consisting of just noting what each city is renowned for, its exports, population, government, and location. The center of the booklet is taken up with one blank character sheet, seven character sheets filled in with the statistics for the Company of Eight from Tethyr, and reduced maps of the area. The last page, page 64, features an index to the book. The book also includes two maps which match the edges of the maps in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Set. The pair of fold-out color poster maps depict the three countries at a scale of 30 miles to the inch, making them compatible with other maps in the series. Amn is the northernmost of the three countries, a place where everything is geared towards the acquisition of money, and the conspicuous consumption of the rich is evident everywhere. Conversations are filled with references to money, whether or not the current topic has any connection with financial transactions. The country was once divided, with its cities banding together only for mutual defense, while the rest of the time they struggled with each other over trade routes. During one trade war, the Council of Six, with a mysterious membership comprising some of Amn's most powerful trade houses, emerged as leaders of a united country. With the council promoting free enterprise, the making of money takes precedence over everything else, and anyone who can make money is well respected. Adventuring groups and magic- users are actively discouraged from plying their trades, unless they are properly licensed with the government. In neighboring Tethyr, anarchy rules. The former royal family have all been killed, and the country is fractured into petty kingdoms, independent villages and towns, and bandit holdings. The Company of Eight is a group of eight adventurers dedicated to promoting peace in Tethyr. The Calim desert covers a sizable area of Calimshan, and dominates much of Calimshan's life and outlook as a result. The lands bordering it are only slightly more fertile. In Calimshan, wealth is of the utmost importance, which is sought after so that the seeker can lead a life of leisure. While few attain this goal, most Calimshanites aspire towards it. Gadgets and magical items are commonly found in Calimshan, where they are widely used as labor- saving devices. Magic-users are held in high esteem, being the providers of the much-sought-after magical devices. Calimshan is ruled by the Pasha in Calimport, although each city governs itself in practice, with the Pasha being unable to carry out any major actions without the permission of at least some of the cities' viziers. The magic-users of Calimshan have accidentally or intentionally summoned and released a substantial number of other-planar beings; after a good time running amok through their summoners’ homes and villages, those planar beings who are unable to undertake the return trip home on their own gravitate toward the Calim Desert, which they find greatly to their liking.  Publication history  FR3 Empires of the Sands was written by Scott Haring, with art by Jeff Easley, and was published by TSR with product code TSR 9224 in 1988 as a sixty-four page booklet with two large color maps and an outer folder. Editing is by Karen S. Martin, and cartography is by Dave S. LaForce. Empires of the Sands was Haring's first big project at TSR, and after its publication he answered readers' questions in Dragon No. 138 (October 1988).  Reception  Jim Bambra reviewed Empires of the Sands for Dragon magazine No. 140 (December 1988). Bambra commented that the name \\"Empires of the Sands\\" is strange for the three countries described in the set, as none \\"is an empire in the formal sense, and only Calimshan has a desert worth mentioning. Still, the lands down here are very arid and, to a northerner used to rolling grasslands, the sparce patches of scrub and brush which dot the southern landscape could well appear to be desert.\\" He felt that Empires of the Sands is really three source packs in one, with each country being described in its own separate section, and felt that the booklet has the same high standard of production as Waterdeep and the North and Moonshae, although like FR2 Moonshae, the inside of the folder cover was left blank and could have been used for some purpose. He felt that the writing, \\"while lacking the flavor of FR2 Moonshae, is informative, readable, and easy to reference during play\\". He criticized the lack of detail for locations, particularly cities, due to the large area covered by the supplement: \\"While information is provided on each city, not all of the cities make for interesting reading. [...] All of this information could easily have been presented in the form of a table, thereby making it more accessible and providing more space for other aspects of the campaign area to be described.\\" Bambra commented that most of the content in the center of the booklet \\"looks like filler, perhaps an indication that this project wasn't quite big enough to fill its allocated page count\\". Bambra concluded his review with an overall evaluation: \\"Empires of the Sands has a much wider focus than [Watedeep and the North and Moonshae], and yet it still manages to convey the atmosphere of each country in a satisfying manner. However, [dungeon masters] are required to put in a fair amount of work to bring these countries to life. With three countries to choose from, though, it's really only necessary to develop one of them for campaign play. With its lack of centralized government, Tethyr makes an ideal setting for power hungry adventurers. Calimshan is a good place for magical research, and Amn is the kind of area that most adventuring groups will find very unhealthy.\\"  References  Category:1988 books Category:Forgotten Realms sourcebooks ","title":"Empires of the Sands"},{"id":"20748826","text":"Michael John Watkins (born 9 January 1952 in Abercarn) is a former Welsh rugby union player who won four caps for as a hooker.

The book, with product code TSR 9229, was published in 1988 by TSR. It was written by Ed Greenwood and Steve Perrin, with cover art by Jeff Easley and interior art by Valerie Valusek.  Contents  The Magister is a supplement which describes magic items and spells specific to the Forgotten Realms setting, and includes rules for magic item creation, random tables for generating magical treasure, and descriptions of new magic items. Elminster, a fictional wizard, narrates the book, and provides descriptive detail, history, and game mechanics for the magic he presents. The spells and spell descriptions are explicit and detailed, and the tomes that contain these spells are described in appearance and history. The book provides lore and descriptions of magical armor, clothing, rings, wands, swords, and miscellaneous magical items, as well as a short section on the creation of magical items. The 64-page book includes a one-page foreword and introduction by Ed Greenwood, which outlines the subject of the book—new spells and magic items—and cites Pages From The Mages, a series of articles from Dragon magazine in which some of the content had previously appeared. \\"How To Use This Book\\", an article by Steve Perrin, explains how the book can be useful to both Dungeon Masters and players. The book details magical books of the Realms, each of which has its own unique properties and contains a number of spells. The spells themselves are elaborated by means of a chart which lists them by level, name, spell school, and which spellbook they may be found in. The book describes a variety of magic items unique to the Realms, including magic armor, clothing, miscellaneous magic items, potions, rings, rods, staves, and wands, unique swords, and other weapons. It details various methods by which characters may create magic items. The book's inside front cover contains a table for randomly determining magical treasure found in this book, and the inside back cover details saving throws involved in creating magical items.  Publication history  The Magister (FR4) was written by Ed Greenwood and Steve Perrin, with a cover by Jeff Easley. It was published by TSR in 1988 as a 64-page book.  Reception  Ken Rolston reviewed The Magister for Dragon magazine #147 (July 1989). He calls The Magister \\"a superior treatment of AD&D; game magic at its best\\". He wrote that the style of presentation in The Magister is similar to that of the magical tomes of the original Forgotten Realms Campaign Set—\\"one of the best features of that product.\\" Rolston found the tone of the presentation appealing, and stated that the new spells were \\"imaginative and colorful, with neat twists on standard spell effects that promise to be useful in play without inflating or disrupting the balance of power established in the 1st Edition Players Handbook magic spells\\". Regarding the new magical items, he called them \\"useful and are not simply handy power tools for popping open monsters. The tweaking of game effects and advantages is subtle and imaginative.\\" He stated that the section on creating magical items \\"offers some interesting rationalizations and elaborations of the standard rules for item creation. The ideas are faithful to the basic rules, with some useful original interpretations of the limits of the powers of certain items.\\" Rolston concluded that \\"The Magister is a good example of the best that AD&D; game magic can produce. The virtues are mostly in the trappings—the descriptive bits, the colorful effects, and the histories and legends attached to the spells and items. I recommend it to gamers who'd like to punch up the style and texture of the magic in their AD&D; campaigns.

Animal mummification was common in ancient Egypt. They mummified various animals. It was an enormous part of Egyptian culture, not only in their role as food and pets, but also for religious reasons. They were typically mummified for four main purposes—to allow beloved pets to go on to the afterlife, to provide food in the afterlife, to act as offerings to a particular god, and because some were seen as physical manifestations of specific deities that the Egyptians worshipped. Bastet, the cat goddess, is an example of one such deity.Jackowski, Christian. \\"Common and Unexpected Findings in Mummies from Ancient Egypt and South America revealed by CT.\\" CMIV Seminar. Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization, Linköping, Sweden. 17 September 2007. In 1888, an Egyptian farmer digging in the sand near Istabl Antar discovered a mass grave of felines, ancient cats that were mummified and buried in pits at great numbers.  Egyptian beliefs about animals  Throughout the history of ancient Egypt, animals were highly respected. In no other culture have animals been as influential in so many aspects of life, nor has any culture depicted animals so often in their artwork or writing.Velde, H. \\"A Few Remarks upon the Religious Significance of Animals in Ancient Egypt.\\" Numen 27 (1980): 76-82. It is estimated that two in every four or five Egyptian hieroglyphs relates to animals. Egyptians believed that animals were crucial to both physical and spiritual survival—vital to physical survival because they were a major source of food and to spiritual survival based on how well a person treated animals during their life on earth. Some animals were considered to be literal incarnations of the deities, and therefore, it is understandable why Egyptians would have wanted to hold such animals in the highest regard, giving them a proper burial through mummification.Leca, Ange P. The Egyptian Way of Death. Doubleday, 1981. The Egyptian religion taught of life after death. In order to determine a person's admittance or denial to the afterlife, the deities would ask a series of judgment questions. One of these crucial questions would be whether they had mistreated any animals during their life on earth. Because of this religious belief, the killing of an animal was considered a serious crime punishable by death.Aufderheide, Arthur C. The Scientific Study of Mummies. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002. Diodorus Siculus, a Greek historian from the first century B.C., witnessed the lynching of a Roman who had accidentally killed a cat during a visit to Egypt. Understandably, this punishment frightened many Egyptians to the point that if one would happen upon a dead animal, they would flee from it as to avoid the accusation of being its killer.Pettigrew, Thomas J., and George Cruikshank. A History of Egyptian Mummies. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2008. = Beloved pets= Long before animal mummies were used as religious offerings, animals in Egypt were occasionally mummified for a more personal reason—as beloved pets that were to keep the deceased company in the afterlife.Lawrence, Susan V. \\"Unraveling the Mysteries of the Mummies.\\" Science News, Society for Science and the Public 118 (1980): 362-64. The most common Egyptian pets included cats, dogs, mongooses, monkeys, gazelles, and birds. Many Egyptians loved their pets, and the customary process of mourning the loss of a loved pet included crying and shaving one's eyebrows. Ancient Egyptian pets were given names like we name our pets today, evidenced by more than seventy names deciphered in inscriptions identifying pet dog mummies.Arnold, Dorothea. \\"An Egyptian Bestiary.\\" The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin new 52 (1995): 1-64. Pets were often depicted on the tombs of Egyptians, indicating their masters’ affection toward the animals.Dunand, Francoise, Roger Lichtenberg, and Jean Yoyotte. Mummies and Death in Egypt. New York: Cornell University Press, 2007. Egyptians believed that mummification was imperative in order to gain admittance to the afterlife, and therefore the belief was that the mummification of these pets would ensure the animals’ immortality. Specific archaeological findings have confirmed that pets were mummified. The most famous example of this is the Theban Queen Makare’s adult Green Monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops). When her tomb was discovered, there was a small, mummified bundle present at her feet, which was initially believed to be her child. This puzzled archaeologists because Queen Makare was a High Priestess who had taken a serious vow of celibacy.Brier, Bob. Egyptian Mummies: Unraveling the Secrets of an Ancient Art. New York: HarperCollins, 1996. If this had been her child, it would have meant that she had, at some point, broken the oath she had taken as High Priestess, raising a slew of other questions regarding her life. Finally, in 1968, an x-ray was done on the small mummy, and it was determined to be an adult Green Monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops), not a child. Similarly, Makare's half sister, Esemkhet, was discovered buried with a mummified pet—she had a mummified gazelle in her tomb. Prince Tuthmosis of the Eighteen Dynasty was also buried with a beloved animal—his pet cat was mummified and placed in a stone coffin in his tomb. Another Egyptian, named Hapymen, had his pet dog mummified, wrapped in cloth, and placed at the side of his coffin.\\"Animal Mummies.\\" The Animal Mummy Project. 2000. The Cairo Museum. 10 December 2008 . At the tomb KV 50 in the Valley of Kings, a mummified dog and baboon were discovered buried together, although the owner is unknown. =Food for the afterlife= Egyptians believed that the afterlife would be a continuation of this one, allowing for the transportation of items from this life to the next. In order to bring food to the afterlife, Egyptians would surround human mummies by what are known as victual mummies. These animals were prepared by dehydrating the meat and wrapping it in linen bandages, to indicate that the animals were food, not pets. They were not mummified to the same meticulous extent that a pet or human mummy would be, but the animals were nonetheless carefully preserved using natron and other special salts. This food was included in tombs in order to sustain the deceased person's soul, called the ka, during the journey to the next world. A variety of food has been found in many tombs, mostly breads, meats, and fowl. King Tutankhamen's tomb held several coffin-shaped wooden boxes containing this type of mummified animal, in his case duck and other types of meat. =Religious purposes= The Obsequies of an Egyptian Cat, by John Reinhard Weguelin (1886). Ancient Egyptian religion was characterized by polytheism, the belief in multiple deities. Prior to the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, there were a tremendous number of these deities, each representative of a different element of the natural world. After the great unification, a more limited list of deities developed. These were usually depicted as having a human body and an animal head, further emphasizing the importance of animals in Egyptian religion. Over time, religious cults emerged for the worship of each specific deity. Two main types of worship distinguished the cults—the first choosing to worship the god through mass mummified animal offerings and the second selecting a totem animal to represent the god, which was mummified at the time of its death.  Votive offerings The vast majority of Egyptian animal mummies were religious offerings. If an Egyptian sought a favor from a deity, an offering would be made or purchased, and placed at the appropriate temple of the god. Before animal mummification became common, these offerings were usually bronze statues depicting the animals. However, eventually a cheaper alternative to bronze statues—animal mummies—became the most popular form of offering. Literally millions of these mummified animals have been discovered throughout Egypt. Inspection of these mummies, usually done through CT scans which allow researchers to examine the skeletons of the mummies without damaging the outer wrappings, has suggested that these types of animals were bred for the sole purpose of offerings. As the process of animal mummification for the purpose of offerings grew, mummification techniques became progressively less meticulous. Studies have revealed many of the large-scale animal offerings to be ‘fakes’ — the wrappings containing only a few bones, feathers, reeds, wood, or pieces of pottery. The animals were raised on temple grounds, and then sold to pilgrims or regular citizens. The necks of the animals were often broken, an indication that their sole purpose in life was to be sacrificed as offerings. When visiting the temples, Egyptians of the general public would purchase these pre-mummified animals and offer them to the gods. The Egyptian god Hor, living in the second century BCE suggests the purpose underlying the practice of mummifying animals: \\"The benefit [of mummification] which is performed for the Ibis, the soul of Toth, the greatest one, is made for the Hawk also, the soul of Ptah, the soul of Apis, the soul of Pre, the soul of Shu, the soul of Tefnut, the soul of Geb, the soul of Osiris, the soul of Isis, the soul of Nephtys, the great gods of Egypt, the Ibis and the Hawk.\\" Hor believes that the mummies are the souls of the gods: he describes the ibis as the soul of Toth and the hawk as the soul of many different gods. That is to say, some animals were, or contained, a ba- a part of the soul that is an active agents in this world and the spiritual world. Therefore, votive animal mummies are the animals' souls acted as messengers between people on earth and the gods.Bleiberg, Edward, Soulful Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt, Brooklyn Museum: 2013. = Cats = mummified cat Cats were mummified as religious offerings in enormous quantities and were believed to represent the war goddess Bastet. This cult was primarily centered at Thebes and Beni Hasan beginning in the Ptolemaic Period. In addition, thousands of cat mummies have been found at the catacombs of Saqqara. Cats who were bred to become offerings of this type usually died due to strangulation or the breaking of their necks. During mummification, the cat bodies would be dried and filled with soil, sand or some other kind of packing material. They were either positioned with their limbs folded closely to their bodies or in a sitting, lifelike position. The wrapping was usually completed through intricate, geometric patterns. Early in the development of animal mummification, cat mummies were placed in little bronze or wooden sarcophagi. More expensive mummies were typically adorned with features drawn in black paint and colored glass, obsidian or rock crystal eyes. Kittens and fetuses were mummified and buried inside the stomach of a statue that represented their mother. As time went by, like all mummies designed for this purpose, the mummification became less precise. In fact, Sir T. C. S. Morrison-Scott, former Director of the British Museum of Natural History, unwrapped a large number of cat mummies, but discovered many were simply stuffed with random body parts of cats and not mummified with detailed care. = Ibises = Ibis Coffin, 305-30 B.C.E., 49.48, Brooklyn Museum The ibis cult was established primarily during the Ptolemaic and Roman periods and was dedicated to the god of wisdom, Thoth. Research from 2015 using 14C radiocarbon dating suggests that the Egyptian Ibis mummies in the study were from time frame that falls between approximately 450 and 250 BC. This timing falls in Egyptian history between the Late Period to the Ptolemaic Period. The number of mummified ibises is extraordinary. Saqqara alone is estimated to contain nearly 500,000 of these mummies and is also thought to have produced 10,000 mummified offerings per year. In addition, approximately four million ibis burials have been uncovered at the catacombs of Tuna el-Gebel. Mummification of the ibis included desiccation and evisceration. Usually, the head and neck of the bird were bent backwards and pressed on the body. The body was then dipped in tar and wrapped tightly with linen. The vast number of mummified ibises suggests that this was done in a mass production, as many times the mummies contained only a part of the body. After serving their ritual purposes, the mummified bodies were placed in ceramic pots, coffins or sarcophagi. = Baboons = This coffin, shaped like a baboon, once contained the remains of a baboon as an offering to the god Thoth. Walters Art Museum, Baltimore. Baboons also represented Thoth, the god of the moon as well as the god of wisdom. The appearance of baboons on canopic jars, which housed the organs of human mummies, is testament of the animals’ tremendous cultural significance. Baboons were reared in mass quantities at temples, though the numbers of baboon mummies that have been discovered are not as large as cats or ibises. Around 400 were uncovered at the tombs of Saqqara. Most baboons were mummified with the use of plaster and buried in wooden chests. Baboon mummies that have been discovered have provided significant evidence that they were bred and mummified as offerings. This evidence includes proof that the baboons usually did not die from natural causes, and that the majority suffered from malnutrition, fractures, osteomylitis, and vitamin D deficiency. = Crocodiles = The crocodile was regarded as an extremely fierce animal, often used to terrify enemies during war. The crocodile cult was devoted to Sebek, god of fertility, and the sun god, Re. Typically, crocodiles were raised in a life of complete luxury, indulged until they died. In the early years of this cult, dead crocodiles were lavishly mummified with gold and other precious things. However, as mummification gradually became a production process, less effort was exerted in their mummification and eventually consisted simply of cloth wrappings and the application of resin, a preserving agent. When found in extremely large quantities, crocodile mummies, like many other sorts of animal offerings, contained only reeds or random body parts. At the main temple of Shedet, later called Crocodilopolis, sacred crocodiles were mummified and displayed in temple shrines or carried in processions.Bleiberg, Edward, Soulful Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt, Brooklyn Museum: 2013. = Fish = Fish were mummified in mass quantities as offerings to the god. They were wrapped in linen and held together by bands of cloth soaked in sticky resin, permanently encasing the mummies. Many times, black circles representing the eyes were painted on the hardened linen. Several species of fish have been identified, but due to the deteriorating condition of the mummies, scientists are unable to conclude if the organs were typically removed during the process of mummification. According to the Museum of Liverpool the Nile perch was one of the species mummified and offered to the gods on of these cults is related to The goddess Neith. = Miscellaneous animals = Dog Mummy, 305 B.C.E.-395 C.E.,05.308, Brooklyn Museum Additional animals mummified and the corresponding god they represented: *Mongoose/Shrew (Horus) **A large type of mongoose common in Africa, the ichneumon (Herpestes ichneumon) is represented in Egyptian art from the Old Kingdom onward. Revered for its ability to kill snakes, the ichneumon was related to Horus and Atum, among others and worshipped throughout the country. The shrew, a mouse size nocturnal mammal, substituted for ichneumons in Egyptian myth. Believed to have vision in both light and darkness, the god Horus Khenty-irty of Letopolis was represented by the wide eyed type of ichneumon and the shrew respectively. Shrews appear as the focus of worship particularly in the Late Period. See African giant shrew #Taxonomy. *Dogs/Jackals (Anubis) **Dogs were used as domestic pets, guardians, herders, and police assistants. Several dog breeds could be found in ancient Egypt, the most popular being the greyhound, basenji, and saluki, all very good for hunting. From the First Dynasty, Egyptians venerated several jackal deities, with the most prominent one was of Anubis. He was represented as a canine or a canine headed human. Traditionally, the Anubis animal has been identified as a jackal, but its generally black coloring, symbolic of the afterlife and rebirth, is not typical of jackals and may instead denote a wild dog. Because dogs and jackals roamed the desert's edge, where the dead were generally buried, they were seen as protectors of cemeteries. *Birds of all types (Horus) (Birds were held in containers shaped like food because they would be used as food in the after life.) *Serpent/Eel (Atum) **Among serpents and eels, snakes and lizards were also popular depictions of the god Atum. Serpents were seen as creatures of the earth that embody primeval, chthonic qualities, involved in the process of creation. Because many snakes inhabit marshes, they were closely linked to water and the primeval ocean of Nun. Egyptians were well aware of both the snake's usefulness in controlling vermin and the dangers posed by its poison. Texts like the Brooklyn Papyrus include remedies and magical spells to cure the bitten. Snake deities were worshipped in hopes of preventing potential attacks by their earthly representatives. Commonly mummified in the Late, Ptolemaic, and Roman periods, lizards did not play much of a role in earlier culture. *Beetles (Cherpera)A History of Egyptian Mummies **Among beetles, the scarab was very popular in Egyptian culture. Images of scarabs were placed in tombs as early as the fourth millennium BCE and used as official seals and amulets for the living and the dead. The Egyptian word for scarab also means \\"to come into being\\" or \\"appear\\". A scarab pushing a spherical object evoked the image of a beetle propelling the sun disk through heaven.  Sacred animals  Instead of worshipping every animal of a particular species, a few animal cults would select one specific animal, chosen because of its special markings, to be the totem of the particular god. Each sacred animal was pampered and cared for until its death, when elaborate burial proceedings took place. The animal was then mummified as a sign of respect to the god. Next, a new symbolic animal was chosen. Only one animal at a time would be chosen as the sacred one. These animal cults reached the pinnacle of popularity during the Late and Graeco- Roman Periods. The cycle of selecting a new totem animal continued for hundreds of years. Though the animals were undoubtedly considered sacred, Egyptians did not worship the individual animals themselves, but rather the invisible deity believed to be present within the animal symbolizing the god. In certain cases, such as the Apis bull, the animal could even be a way to communicate the desires of the god. The Apis bull cult was the main source of this type of religious animal mummy in ancient Egypt, as most other animals were mummified in large quantities for religious offerings. = Bulls = The Apis bull cult is estimated to have originated as early as 800 B.C., the first cult supported by archaeological evidence. The earliest and largest of all animal cults, the Apis bull cult considered the bull to be a symbol of strength and fertility, representing the creator gods Ptah and Osiris. Mummification was a key part in the worshipping of these animals. While alive, the bull would be housed in a special temple, lavishly pampered for its entire life. Priests believed that the Apis bull was a medium of communication between the two creator gods, so its movements were carefully observed and sometimes consulted as an oracle. These sacred animals were allowed to die a natural death unless they reached the age of 28, at which time they were killed. When an Apis bull died, the entire country went into mourning. It was afforded an elaborate funeral and intricate burial procedures. Because the bulls were so large, the process of mummification was lengthy and complicated. Enormous alabaster embalming tables were constructed at Memphis, the center of the cult. They were complete with engravings and fluid drainage channels. After the funerary ceremonies, the bull would be transported to these tables where it would be strapped to the table. Its internal organs would be destroyed through intra-anal oils. The animal's body would be dried out using natron salts and packed with sand. It would then be wrapped in linens. Artificial eyes and an artistic plaster head would be added, ensuring the bull still looked like itself.  Differences between human and non-human animal mummification  The distinguishing factor between the process of non-human animal and human mummification is when the two types were mummified. Humans had been mummified consistently since the days of the early conquerors of Lower Egypt, hundreds of years before even the first non-human animal was mummified. The earliest signs of non-human animal mummies are dated to the Badarian Predynastic Period (5500–4000BC) before the unification of upper and lower Egypt. It is likely that animal mummies did not exist earlier on because mummification was less accessible primarily due to cost. In general, the mummifying of animals was not given the careful attention afforded to humans. Mummies sold to pilgrims as offerings were only minimally treated, and unlike humans, even the most sacred of animals, such as the Apis bulls, did not have their internal organs preserved. The large scale of production indicates that relatively little care and expense was involved in animal preparation compared to human mummies. However, recent radiological studies by archeologists indicate that animal mummification may more closely follow human mummification than was originally thought. The accepted view is that animals were merely wrapped in coarse linen bandages and/or dipped in resin after death. However, as with human mummification there was a range in terms of the quality of treatments. A simple visual analysis of the mummies suggests that some animal mummies were treated with the same complexity as those of humans. Egyptians treated animals with great respect, regarding them both as domestic pets and representatives of the gods. The presence of fats, oils, beeswax, sugar gum, petroleum bitumen, and coniferous cedar resins in animal mummies shows that the chemicals used to embalm animals were similar to those used on humans.

Simple adoption  Simple adoption () is a type of adoption which allows some of the legal bonds between an adopted child and his or her birth family to remain. It is formalized under articles 343 and following of the French Civil Code. Simple adoption is less restrictive in its requirements and less radical in effects than plenary adoption. = Requirements for adoption = * A single person of 28 years or older can adopt another person.http://www.adoptionpolicy.org/pdf/eu-france.pdf * It is necessary for the adoptive parent to be at least 15 years older than the adoptee, unless the adoptee is the child of the adoptive parent's spouse. In this case, the parent must be 10 years older than the adoptee. * If the prospective adoptive parent is married, the consent of the spouse is needed. (Articles 361 and following of the Civil Code) = Consequences = * Adoption grants to the adoptee rights and duties equivalent to those of a legitimate child. Thus, for example, the name of the adoptive parents is added to the adoptee's original name, or replaces it. * The adoptive parents gain exclusive parental authority over the child, though legal bonds of the adoptee with his or her family of origin are not broken. Thus, the adoptee preserves inheritance rights within his original family. * The simple adoptee (and his children and stepchildren) have the ability to inherit from both families. * The adoptee cannot inherit from the parents of the adoptive parents. * An exception is made if the adoptive parent has children resulting from a preceding marriage. * If the adoptee dies and leaves successors, rights of inheritance are determined by common law. If not, inheritance is divided, half going to the birth family and half to the adoptive family. * Adoption has no consequences for the nationality of the adoptee, who can be of foreign nationality (this is possible if there are agreements with France). * There is a maintenance obligation (obligation alimentaire) between the adoptee and adoptive parent. Between the adoptee and his birth parents, a similar obligation also exists, but it is only secondary: birth parents are bound by the obligation alimentaire only if the adoptee establishes that he or she could not obtain help from the adoptive parents. = Age of adoptee = * There is no condition on the age of the adoptee. The consent of the adoptee is necessary for adoptees of 13 years and older, and, for minor adoptees the agreement of his parents is needed.https://www.hal.inserm.fr/inserm-00476402/file/inserm-00476402_edited.pdf * The future adoptee; no retraction after having given the agreement. * There are no particular restrictions for adoptees past the age of majority.  Plenary adoption  Plenary adoption () is an alternate form of adoption which terminates the relationship between birth parent and child. Thus, all rights and status which the child may have had from the birth family are revoked and replaced with the rights and status granted by the adopting family. The term \\"plenary adoption\\" distinguishes it from the other form of adoption practised in France, simple adoption, which allows some of the legal bonds between an adopted child and his or her birth family to remain.

Hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicles are different from hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (which use electrochemical use of hydrogen rather than combustion). Instead, the hydrogen internal combustion engine is simply a modified version of the traditional gasoline-powered internal combustion engine. Hydrogen-Fueled Internal Combustion Engines; see section 5 History Francois Isaac de Rivaz designed in 1806 the De Rivaz engine, the first internal combustion engine, which ran on a hydrogen/oxygen mixture. Étienne Lenoir produced the Hippomobile in 1863. Paul Dieges patented in 1970 a modification to internal combustion engines which allowed a gasoline-powered engine to run on hydrogen. Tokyo City University have been developing hydrogen internal combustion engines from 1970. They recently developed a hydrogen fueled BusHydrogen Fuel ICE Bus developed by TCU and Truck. Mazda has developed Wankel engines that burn hydrogen. The advantage of using ICE (internal combustion engine) such as wankel and piston engines is that the cost of retooling for production is much lower. Existing-technology ICE can still be used to solve those problems where fuel cells are not a viable solution as yet, for example in cold-weather applications. Between 2005 - 2007, BMW tested a luxury car named the BMW Hydrogen 7, powered by a hydrogen ICE, which achieved 301 km/h (187 mph) in tests. At least two of these concepts have been manufactured. HICE forklift trucks have been demonstrated based on converted diesel internal combustion engines with direct injection.HyICE In the year 2000, a Shelby Cobra was converted to run on hydrogen in a project led by James W. Heffel (principal engineer at the time for the University of California, Riverside CE-CERT). The hydrogen conversion was done with the aim of making a vehicle capable of beating the current land speed record for hydrogen powered vehicles.Heffel, J., Johnson, D., and Shelby, C., \\"Hydrogen Powered Shelby Cobra: Vehicle Conversion,\\" SAE Technical Paper 2001-01-2530, 2001[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327655678_The_Design_and_Testing_of_Hydrogen_Fueled_Internal_Combustion_Engine The Design and Testing of Hydrogen Fueled Internal Combustion EngineHydrogen Powered Shelby Cobra: Vehicle Conversion It achieved a respectable 108.16 mph, missing the world record for hydrogen powered vehicles by 0.1 mph.UCR Runs Hydrogen Powered Shelby Cobra in Speed Trial Alset GmbH developed a hybrid hydrogen systems that allows vehicle to use petrol and hydrogen fuels individually or at the same time with an internal combustion engine. This technology was used with Aston Martin Rapide S during the 24 Hours Nürburgring race. The Rapide S was the first vehicle to finish the race with hydrogen technology. Near-zero emissions The combustion of hydrogen with oxygen produces water as its only product: :2H2 \\\\+ O2 → 2H2O In contrast, combustion of high temperature combustion fuels, such as kerosene, gasoline, diesel or natural gas with air can produce oxides of nitrogen, known as NOx. Hydrogen has a wide flammability range in comparison with other fuels. As a result, it can be combusted in an internal combustion engine over a wide range of fuel- air mixtures. An advantage here is it can thus be on a lean fuel-air mixture. Such a mixture is one in which the amount of fuel is less than the theoretical, stoichiometric or chemically ideal amount needed for combustion with a given amount of air. Fuel economy is then greater and the combustion reaction is more complete. Also, the combustion temperature is usually lower, which reduces the amount of pollutants (nitrogen oxides, ...) emitted through the exhaust.Hydrogen use in internal combustion engines The European emission standards measure emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, non-methane hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides (NOx), atmospheric particulate matter, and particle numbers. According to a paper by L.M Das, hydrogen internal combustion generates no CO, CO2, SO2, HC or PM emissions.Hydrogen vehicles and refueling infrastructure in IndiaL. M. DAS, EXHAUST EMISSION CHARACTERIZATION OF HYDROGEN OPERATED ENGINE SYSTEM: NATURE OF POLLUTANTS AND THEIR CONTROL TECHNIQUES Int. J. Hydrogen Energy Vol. 16, No. 11, pp. 765-775, 1991 He describes it as \\"near zero emissions\\". Tuning a hydrogen engine in 1976 to produce the greatest amount of emissions possible resulted in emissions comparable with consumer operated gasoline engines from 1976. More modern engines however often come equipped with exhaust gas recirculation, and this technology benefits hydrogen too in terms of NOx emissions.NOx emission and performance data for a hydrogen fueled internal combustion engine at 1500rpm using exhaust gas recirculation Equation when ignoring EGR: :H2 \\\\+ O2 \\\\+ N2 → H2O + NOx \\\\+ N2 Hydrogen use in internal combustion engines Adaptation of existing engines The differences between a hydrogen ICE and a traditional gasoline engine include hardened valves and valve seats, stronger connecting rods, non-platinum tipped spark plugs, a higher voltage ignition coil, fuel injectors designed for a gas instead of a liquid, larger crankshaft damper, stronger head gasket material, modified (for supercharger) intake manifold, positive pressure supercharger, and a high temperature engine oil. All modifications would amount to about one point five times (1.5) the current cost of a gasoline engine.Converting of gasoline ICE to hydrogen ICE These hydrogen engines burn fuel in the same manner that gasoline engines do. The theoretical maximum power output from a hydrogen engine depends on the air/fuel ratio and fuel injection method used. The stoichiometric air/fuel ratio for hydrogen is 34:1. At this air/fuel ratio, hydrogen will displace 29% of the combustion chamber leaving only 71% for the air. As a result, the energy content of this mixture will be less than it would be if the fuel were gasoline. Since both the carbureted and port injection methods mix the fuel and air prior to it entering the combustion chamber, these systems limit the maximum theoretical power obtainable to approximately 85% of that of gasoline engines. For direct injection systems, which mix the fuel with the air after the intake valve has closed (and thus the combustion chamber has 100% air), the maximum output of the engine can be approximately 15% higher than that for gasoline engines. Therefore, depending on how the fuel is metered, the maximum output for a hydrogen engine can be either 15% higher or 15% less than that of gasoline if a stoichiometric air/fuel ratio is used. However, at a stoichiometric air/fuel ratio, the combustion temperature is very high and as a result it will form a large amount of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which is a criteria pollutant. Since one of the reasons for using hydrogen is low exhaust emissions, hydrogen engines are not normally designed to run at a stoichiometric air/fuel ratio. Typically hydrogen engines are designed to use about twice as much air as theoretically required for complete combustion. At this air/fuel ratio, the formation of NOx is reduced to near zero. Unfortunately, this also reduces the power output to about half that of a similarly sized gasoline engine. To make up for the power loss, hydrogen engines are usually larger than gasoline engines, and/or are equipped with turbochargers or superchargers.

History The Corps was formed at the initiative of the Chief Polish Military Committee (Naczelny Polski Komitet Wojskowy), a Polish faction in the revolutionary and split Russian Empire military. It was formed on 21 December 1917 in Soroca (now in Moldavia), then a Bessarabian region disputed by revolutionary Ukraine and Romania. The corps was formed primarily from Poles serving in the former Imperial Russian Army. It was a counterpart to the Polish I Corps in Russia formed in the north, in Belarus and the Polish III Corps in Russia in central Ukraine. General Józef Haller, touching flag It was commanded initially by General Sylwester Stankiewicz (some sources also indicate it was briefly commanded by General Władysław Glass). In February 1918 the corps merged with the Brigade II of the Polish Legions and by late March Stankiewicz (and/or Glass) was replaced by the brigade commander, General Józef Haller. The Corps avoided major engagements, and concentrated on protecting the Polish inhabitants of the region. In March 1918 the corps had about 8,000 soldiers, and was equipped with weapons passed down from the Russian 29th Corps. At that time, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed between Russia and the Central Powers. The Germans demanded that the Polish forces surrender. =Combat= The Poles refused to lay down their arms and General Haller took control of the forces which were then challenged by the Austrians at the battle of Rarańcza (15-16 February 1918). The Poles won the battle and broke through the frontlines to the Ukrainian side. Later, however, they were attacked by German forces. This time the engagement ended in defeat at the battle of Kaniów (10-11 May).Spencer Tucker, Laura Matysek Wood, Justin D.

The process starts when the ice begins to crack followed by water filling in those gaps and the process continues until there is a wall of ice surrounding the lakes shoreline, sometimes reaching up to three feet. The formation of ice jacking allows for nutrients to get trapped in the ice creating organic fertilizer to create a buffer (transition between land and aquatic organisms) which collaborates with already existing plants on the shore line that contribute to the development of future organisms leading to the expansion of fish. However ice jacking is unfeasible due to the lack of control over it. There are no methods that will prevent damage from ice jacking but there are a few defenses that can be used to fight against ice jacking such as building a riprap along the shoreline, attack its strengths/weaknesses, allow the natural process to take place and repair the damage later, or do nothing at all and let nature take its course. * Ice shove is sometimes called ice-jacking. * Ice heaving or frost heaving is sometimes called ice-jacking. * Ice wedging is sometimes called ice-jacking. One difference between ice jacking and ice heaving is that ice jacking occurs in the middle of winter while ice heaving occurs in the early spring. When there is snow, the ice stays at constant temperature. When there is no snow, nothing can protect or cover the ice from the changing ambient temperatures. When the temperature decreases, the ice will contract which causes cracks to occur in the ice which later are filled with the water from below. The ice expands once the temperature rises and the ice pushes up towards the shoreline since it does not have anywhere else to go. More pressure is put on the shoreline as the ice is jacked towards the shoreline. A solution to ice jacking should consist of sand shoreline.  Geologic engineering  Rock slope failures can occur due to the presence of water; ice jacking occurs when water between joint or fissure surfaces freezes and expands. This type of failure is progressive, resulting in incremental weakening over time, often requiring several cycles before failure. Ice jacking is one form of rock erosion. In a 2005 study, middle size rock falls (10 to 100,000 m3) in the French Subalpine Ranges in an elevation ranging from 200 meters and 2000 meters above sea level were observed. Statistical analysis studied the triggering factors of 46 rock falls, investigating the rainfall, freeze-thaw cycles, and earthquakes in the region. Correlation was found between failure and freeze-thaw cycles, suggesting that ice jacking is a main triggering factor in rock falls. For example, on December 17, 2008 a Gondola tower on Blackcomb Mountain in Whistler, B.C collapsed as a result of ice jacking. The splice broke when the water entered into a section of the fourth tower and began to expand. This occurred around 2:30 pm, and left over fifty passengers stranded in sub-zero temperatures for hours. All of the passengers stuck in cabins on the Excalibur Gondola lift were rescued, with only twelve suffering from mild injuries. Many passengers recall watching in horror as the cars swung sideways, one dangling above the creek. It was apparent the first cabin to fall took the hardest hit, falling violently to the ground. Reports state none of the cabins actually came off of the cable, but that the strength of the cable had been significantly compromised. Following the incident, lift maintenance teams conducted inspections of all other towers to make sure there would be no other occurrence of ice jacking. After a second inspection by the British Columbia Safety Authority (BCSA), the lift were given approval to perform regularly again.

He was born in the city of Kōchi in Kōchi Prefecture, into a family of retainers of the shōgun and was given the name Mosaburō. As a teenager, he studied Kanō-school painting with Yanagimoto Doso and Kawada Shoryu. At about age 17, he moved to Tokyo, where he studied Nanga painting with Taki Katei. At 20 years of age, he was employed as an illustrator for Fugoku gaho, a pictorial magazine dealing with the sights in and around Tokyo. In his latter career, Shōun primarily produced paintings. He died in 1965, at the age of 96. In addition to his magazine illustrations, Shōun is best known for his woodblock prints of beautiful women and a group of humorous shikishiban (prints about 7 by 8 inches). Shōun is considered a bridge between ukiyo-e and shin-hanga. His career spans the Meiji (1868–1912), Taishō (1912–1926) and Shōwa (1926–1989) periods.

Life Martindale was born in Woodford Green, Essex. Her father, James Spicer, was a wholesale stationer with a successful family business. The family were prominent Congregationalists. She founded the Ray Lodge Mission Station in Woodford Green in 1865. During her time in Brighton, she was one of the founders of the Women's Liberal Association (1891), Women's Co-operative Movement and a women's dispensary that later became the New Sussex Hospital for Women and Children. She was also involved with the British and Foreign Bible Society and the Women's Suffrage Society. She assisted her brother, Albert Spicer, a Liberal MP for the Monmouth Boroughs (1892–1900) and Hackney Central (1906–18), who himself worked on issues such as the admission of women into county councils. Her interest in women's rights dated from 1867. She spoke in Spicer's Monmouth constituency on issues such as the aforementioned admission of women into county councils, wrote lectures on the rights of women and related topics, and supported women's right to preach. In 1904, she attended (with her daughter Hilda) the International Congress of Women in Berlin, where she met Susan B. Anthony; she was a member of the executive committee of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, and a vice-president of the Central Society. Not just content with political action, Martindale engaged in a practical manner to improve the situation of women. In the 1880s, she opened her house for shop girls on alternate Saturdays, and took a number of underprivileged young women under her wing, among whom was Margaret Bondfield, later the first female Cabinet member of the United Kingdom. Personal life In 1871, she married William Martindale, who was a merchant. Their marriage was short-lived; he died only a few years later. One of their children was Louisa who was a suffragist and surgeon. Another was Hilda, a civil servant and author. A third daughter died in infancy. After her husband's death in around 1874, Louisa travelled with her young daughters around England and Europe, eventually settling in Brighton. In 1903, she moved to Horsted Keynes in Sussex, where she built a Congregational church. Death The Martindale Centre in Horsted Keynes, West Sussex, was founded in 1907 by Louisa Martindale as a Congregational church. Martindale died from pneumonia in Horsted Keynes on 15 March 1914, aged 74. Legacy Louisa Martindale's legacy is by now well-recognised. The history of her work in Horsted Keynes, as a founder of the Congregationalist \\"Free Church\\" there, as a community leader, and as an advocate of women's religious rights, is maintained in the Martindale Centre, in the heart of the village. Perhaps her legacy is best symbolized by her brother James Spicer's great-granddaughter, Harriet Harman QC MP, a Labour politician who has attained high-ranking functions such as Deputy Leader, and Party Chair of the Labour Party, Leader of the House of Commons, Lord Privy Seal, and Minister for Women and Equality.

In addition they worked the Federsee Railway between Schussenried and Riedlingen, the Zabergäu Railway between Lauffen am Neckar and Leonbronn and the Bottwar Railway between Marbach am Neckar and Heilbronn Süd. A total of nine units were delivered in three series of three engines in 1899, 1901 and 1904 with railway numbers 41–49. They were initially classified as Tss locomotives and later as Tssd 41–49. T is the abbreviation for tank locomotive, ss means that it is a narrow gauge locomotive with a rail gauge of , and the letter d, added later, was the abbreviation for duplex locomotive, because the steam was expanded twice, first in the high-pressure cylinders and then in the low- pressure cylinders. Today duplex locomotives are described as compound locomotives. All the engines were taken over by the Deutschen Reichsbahn- Gesellschaft and given the numbers 99 631 to 99 639. After the Second World War four engines were still in service. They were retired as follows: *Number 99 638 - 26 October 1954 *Number 99 639 - 27 November 1956 *Number 99 637 - 25 March 1965 *Number 99 633 - 18 March 1969 Two locomotives, numbers 99 633 and 99 637 have been preserved.

In 2007 the society bought it outright. Since the very first transmission of the SWR television programme, Eisenbahn-Romantik, it has featured in the introduction and the programme's logo. Number 99 637 is on display as a monument at the former station forecourt in Bad Buchau, its last home station.

He may have inadvertently saved Adolf Hitler's life, at the cost of his own, by moving the 20 July plot bomb planted by Claus von Stauffenberg. Life and careerEarly life= Brandt was born in Charlottenburg, Berlin and enlisted in the Reichswehr in 1925. He attended a course at the cavalry school in Hanover from 1927 to 1928 and was commissioned a lieutenant. In 1936 he was a member of the gold medal winning German show jumping team in the equestrian event at the Berlin Summer Olympics, on his horse Alchemy. =Second World War= At the outbreak of the Second World War he was a Hauptmann on the general staff of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht. After serving in an infantry division he was promoted to Major in January 1941 and Oberstleutnant in April 1942. On 13 March 1943 Brandt was an unwitting participant in an attempt to assassinate Hitler. Generalmajor Henning von Tresckow instructed Lieutenant Fabian Von Schlabrendorff to ask Brandt to carry a package containing bottles of what he claimed was Cointreau onto Hitler's Condor plane for delivery to Oberst Helmuth Stieff as payment for a lost bet. The package in fact contained a primed bomb which in the event failed to detonate. In May 1943 Brandt was promoted to Oberst (Colonel). =20 July bomb= On 20 July 1944 he arrived at the Wolf's Lair headquarters in Rastenburg, East Prussia for a situation conference attended by Hitler. With the assistance of Major Ernst John von Freyend, Oberst von Stauffenberg put a briefcase containing a primed bomb at Brandt's feet as close as possible to Hitler and to the right of General Heusinger who was standing next to him. Stauffenberg then made an excuse that he had a phone call and left the room. Soon after he left, Brandt wanted to get a better look at a map on the table, he found the briefcase in his way and moved the briefcase to the other side of a thick strong table leg. Seven minutes later the bomb exploded and blew one of Brandt's legs off. Where Brandt was standing (see List of people killed or wounded in the 20 July plot) was in number 4 standing right beside the bomb. =Death= Brandt died the next day after surgery in the Wolf's Lair hospital and was posthumously promoted to Generalmajor by Hitler. Three other people also died as a result of the explosion. It was later concluded that its exact positioning next to a leg of the map table was a crucial factor in determining who in the room survived. Media portrayals In the 1971 Eastern Bloc co- production Liberation: Direction of the Main Blow, Brandt was portrayed by the East German actor Fritz-Ernst Fechner. In the 2008 film Valkyrie, Heinz Brandt is portrayed by British actor Tom Hollander.

In the scope of the studies are also subjects such as the role of intelligence, diplomacy, and international cooperation for security and defense. The subject is normally taught at the post-graduate academic or professional, usually strategic- political and strategic-military levels. The academic foundations of the subject began with classic texts initially from the Orient such as Sun Tzu’s Art of War and went on to gain a European focus with Carl von Clausewitz’s On War. Like Clausewitz, many academics in this field reject monocausal theories and hypotheses that reduce the study of conflict to one independent variable and one dependent variable. Already in the late eighteenth century, a colourful mathematician named Dietrich Heinrich von Bülow attempted to establish mathematical formulae for the conduct of war. Carl von Clausewitz rejected Bülow’s approach and his popular claim that warfare could be reduced to positivist, teachable principles of war. Instead of formulae, we find Clausewitz stressing, time and again, that the whole purpose of educating the military commander is not to give him a series of answers for the task he will face (the complexities of which cannot be foreseen), but to educate him about different aspects of what will face him so as to let him evaluate the situation for himself, and develop his own strategy.Thomas Otte: “Educating Bellona: Carl von Clausewitz and Military Education”, in G.C. Kennedy & K. Neilson (eds): Military Education: Past, Present and Future (New York: Praeger, 2001). Strategic thinkers on the whole will search for recurrent patterns, which in themselves cannot predict the characteristics of any individual case even if it doubtless fits a larger category; not all patterns of characteristics will be found in all cases. In recent times, the major conflicts of the nineteenth century and the two World Wars have spurred strategic thinkers such as Mahan, Corbett, Giulio Douhet, Liddell Hart and, later, André Beaufre. The Cold War with its danger of degenerating into a nuclear war produced an expansion of the discipline, with authors like Bernard Brodie, Michael Howard, Raymond Aron, Lucien Poirier, Lawrence Freedman, Colin Gray, and many others. The subject is taught in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Europe. In Nigeria, Institute for Peace and Strategic Studies, Nigerian Defence Academy, University of Ibadan, Covenant University and in the Conflict, Peace and Strategic Studies at Afe Babalola University Nigeria and Nassarawa State University Keffi offers Security and Strategic Studies at Masters and Ph.D. Level. In South Africa, the Faculty of Military Science at the University of Stellenbosch provides a number of courses in strategic studies from the undergraduate to PhD level. The Faculty of Military Science, co-located at the South African Military Academy in Saldanha is also involved in the teaching of the discipline at the South African Defence and War Colleges. In Europe the subject is taught at the University of St Andrews, the University of Reading, Aberystwyth University, the University of Aberdeen, the University of Exeter, the University of Hull, King's College London, and the University of Leeds (all in the United Kingdom), University of Rome III, Università degli Studi di Milano, University of Turin(all of the three in Italy), the University of Granada (in Spain), the National Defence University (in Finland), the Charles University in Prague, Netherlands Defence College Breda (the Netherlands), and the Université Paris 13 Nord SciencesPo (in France), University College Cork (Ireland), University of Warsaw (Poland). In the Americas it is taught in Chile, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, United States. In Brazil it is taught at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro and Universidade Federal Fluminense.

There is still a Jewish community living in Kenya today. Background Israeli prime minister Golda Meir with Israeli ambulance donated to the people of Kenya, 1963 J. Marcus, a Jewish businessman, moved to Nairobi from India in 1899 and established an export business for local produce. In 1903, the British colonial secretary Joseph Chamberlain offered the Zionists a part of the territory in Kenya and Uganda known as the Uganda Program for their own autonomous country at the Sixth Zionist Congress. The suggestion created much controversy among the international Jewish community, and was rejected at the Seventh Zionist Congress in 1905. Although the plan was shelved, 20 Jewish families had settled in Kenya by 1913, most of them in Nairobi. A Jewish cemetery was consecrated in 1907, and the first synagogue in 1913. During the period of World War II and following the Holocaust, Jewish immigration increased and as many as 1,200 Jews were living in the country. Prior to the establishment of the State of Israel, members of the Kenyan Jewish community helped Irgun and Lehi fighters imprisoned by the British in Gilgil. Once the State of Israel was established in 1948, many Jews in Kenya left for Israel. In 1963, when Kenya became independent, the Jewish population declined further and shifted from largely permanent residents to people on international contracts or long-term business assignments. Notable Kenyan Jews include former Nairobi mayor Israel Somen. In 2011, it was estimated that 80% of the Jewish ex-pats in Kenya are Israeli. In 2013, the Jewish community had about 600 members.For Nairobi Jews, Mall Attack Undermines Already Fragile Sense of Security, Haaretz A Kikuyu-speaking Kasuku community of 60 members, calling itself the Kasuku Gathundia Jewish community, has developed among subsistence farmers in the Kenyan highlands, near Nyahururu. According to their patriarch, Yosef Ben Avraham Njogu, it grew from a split with Kenya's sizeable Messianic Jewish congregation, when a purported visit from Nairobi Jews led to their understanding that what they practiced was Messianic and not Judaism. On learning of the distinction, he and Avraham Ndungu Mbugua broke away, and began to study Judaism in depth. Circumcision, traditionally a puberty rite disallowed by law at birth, means that the community's children must travel to Uganda to have the rite performed by the Abayudaya.

William Wrightson of Cusworth had acquired the Edlington estate in 1803 from the Molesworth family, which had owned it since the late seventeenth century. Two shafts were sunk in 1909 and 1910.

It reached the Barnsley seam at a depth of 905 yards in July 1911, however this was on a fault. The main seam was relocated in October 1912. The Colliery first produced a million tons of coal in 1923 and in 1939 it achieved a record output of 1,138,512 tons. Extraction of the Dunsil seam, about 18 yards lower, began in the 1950s, and the Swallow Wood seam in the 1970s.

The former director of the school which had closed in 2001, Luther Samuel, admitted to selling C$700 registration letters to approximately 400 immigration applicants to improve their ability to apply for residence in Canada, and offering small amateurly produced courses across six rented classrooms. When the students expressed fears this was just a diploma mill taking thousands of dollars in tuition money from them, the director assured them they were just in a small branch of a larger downtown school. Those who left the school, realising that it was a scam, said they were afraid they would lose their immigration status if they reported the situation to police. Investigation The investigation began when suspicions were raised about Khalid Jahinger, who left Lahore, Pakistan to travel to Nanaimo, British Columbia, on a student visa in December 1998. He moved to Ontario where he studied at OBC and George Brown College. He travelled to Mexico City to apply for permanent residency, which must be done from outside the country, where his C$40,000 bank account -- inheritance from his recently deceased father -- raised eyebrows and led to the beginning of the investigation. In May 2003, police stormed his apartment and arrested him and his roommate Aamir Nadeem and held them for five months until they volunteered to be deported to end their detention. Upon his return to Pakistan, Jahinger was questioned for eight full hours and released.

It was centered on the junction of the Tombigbee and Black Warrior rivers, near Demopolis, and extended eastward to include large parts of Hale, Marengo, and Perry counties. Portions of Greene and Sumter were also often included. Cane thickets once covered hundreds of thousands of acres in Alabama, but this area, lying within the Black Belt, had the most extensive stands. American Naturalist William Bartram noted the growth in this area as he traveled along the Tombigbee River in 1775. He described cane that was \\"thick as a man's arm, or three or four inches in diameter; I suppose one joint of some of them would contain above a quart of water.\\" The cane began to disappear following settlement by numerous European Americans after the Creek Wars and, especially, Indian Removal. The settlers introduced crops that replaced the native cane and suppressed fires. This resulted in species flourishing that competed with the cane. In addition, depending on enslaved labor, the new settlers had workers clear the area of cane in order to cultivate the important commodity crop of cotton. But, as late as 1845, Scottish geologist Charles Lyell noted the height and density of cane along the Black Warrior River. In his 1947 account of the Canebrake region, \\"Chronicles of the Canebrake, 1817-1860\\", published in Alabama Historical Quarterly, John Witherspoon DuBose described the early settlers, the land and plantations they bought or developed, and many of the details of the lives of these early settlers.

The permanent is defined similarly to the determinant, as a sum of products of sets of matrix entries that lie in distinct rows and columns. However, where the determinant weights each of these products with a ±1 sign based on the parity of the set, the permanent weights them all with a +1 sign. While the determinant can be computed in polynomial time by Gaussian elimination, it is generally believed that the permanent cannot be computed in polynomial time. In computational complexity theory, a theorem of Valiant states that computing permanents is #P-hard, and even #P-complete for matrices in which all entries are 0 or 1 . This puts the computation of the permanent in a class of problems believed to be even more difficult to compute than NP. It is known that computing the permanent is impossible for logspace-uniform ACC0 circuits. The development of both exact and approximate algorithms for computing the permanent of a matrix is an active area of research. Definition and naive algorithm The permanent of an n-by-n matrix A = (ai,j) is defined as : \\\\operatorname{perm}(A)=\\\\sum_{\\\\sigma\\\\in S_n}\\\\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,\\\\sigma(i)}. The sum here extends over all elements σ of the symmetric group Sn, i.e. over all permutations of the numbers 1, 2, ..., n. This formula differs from the corresponding formula for the determinant only in that, in the determinant, each product is multiplied by the sign of the permutation σ while in this formula each product is unsigned. The formula may be directly translated into an algorithm that naively expands the formula, summing over all permutations and within the sum multiplying out each matrix entry. This requires n! n arithmetic operations. Ryser formula The best knownAs of 2008, see general exact algorithm is due to . Ryser’s method is based on an inclusion–exclusion formula that can be given p. 99 as follows: Let A_k be obtained from A by deleting k columns, let P(A_k) be the product of the row- sums of A_k, and let \\\\Sigma_k be the sum of the values of P(A_k) over all possible A_k. Then : \\\\operatorname{perm}(A)=\\\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (-1)^{k}\\\\Sigma_k. It may be rewritten in terms of the matrix entries as follows : \\\\operatorname{perm} (A) = (-1)^n \\\\sum_{S\\\\subseteq\\\\\\\\{1,\\\\dots,n\\\\\\\\}} (-1)^{S} \\\\prod_{i=1}^n \\\\sum_{j\\\\in S} a_{ij}. Ryser’s formula can be evaluated using O(2^{n-1}n^2) arithmetic operations, or O(2^{n-1}n) by processing the sets S in Gray code order. Balasubramanian–Bax–Franklin–Glynn formula Another formula that appears to be as fast as Ryser's (or perhaps even twice as fast) is to be found in the two Ph.D. theses; see , ; also . The methods to find the formula are quite different, being related to the combinatorics of the Muir algebra, and to finite difference theory respectively. Another way, connected with invariant theory is via the polarization identity for a symmetric tensor . The formula generalizes to infinitely many others, as found by all these authors, although it is not clear if they are any faster than the basic one. See . The simplest known formula of this type (when the characteristic of the field is not two) is : \\\\operatorname{perm}(A) = \\\\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\\\\left[\\\\sum_\\\\delta \\\\left(\\\\prod_{k=1}^n \\\\delta_k\\\\right) \\\\prod_{j=1}^n \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\delta_i a_{ij}\\\\right], where the outer sum is over all 2^{n-1} vectors \\\\delta=(\\\\delta_1=1,\\\\delta_2,\\\\dots,\\\\delta_n)\\\\in \\\\\\\\{\\\\pm1\\\\\\\\}^n. Special casesPlanar and K3,3-free= The number of perfect matchings in a bipartite graph is counted by the permanent of the graph's biadjacency matrix, and the permanent of any 0-1 matrix can be interpreted in this way as the number of perfect matchings in a graph. For planar graphs (regardless of bipartiteness), the FKT algorithm computes the number of perfect matchings in polynomial time by changing the signs of a carefully chosen subset of the entries in the Tutte matrix of the graph, so that the Pfaffian of the resulting skew-symmetric matrix (the square root of its determinant) is the number of perfect matchings. This technique can be generalized to graphs that contain no subgraph homeomorphic to the complete bipartite graph K3,3., George Pólya had asked the question, of when it is possible to change the signs of some of the entries of a 01 matrix A so that the determinant of the new matrix is the permanent of A. Not all 01 matrices are \\"convertible\\" in this manner; in fact it is known () that there is no linear map T such that \\\\operatorname{per}\\\\,T(A) = \\\\det A for all n\\\\times n matrices A. The characterization of \\"convertible\\" matrices was given by who showed that such matrices are precisely those that are the biadjacency matrix of bipartite graphs that have a Pfaffian orientation: an orientation of the edges such that for every even cycle C for which G\\\\setminus C has a perfect matching, there are an odd number of edges directed along C (and thus an odd number with the opposite orientation). It was also shown that these graphs are exactly those that do not contain a subgraph homeomorphic to K_{3,3}, as above. =Computation modulo a number= Modulo 2, the permanent is the same as the determinant, as (-1) \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod 2. It can also be computed modulo 2^k in time O(n^{4k-3}) for k \\\\ge 2. However, it is UP-hard to compute the permanent modulo any number that is not a power of 2. There are various formulae given by for the computation modulo a prime . Firstly, there is one using symbolic calculations with partial derivatives. Secondly, for = 3 there is the following formula for an nxn-matrix A, involving the matrix's principal minors (): :\\\\operatorname{per} (A) = (-1)^{n}\\\\Sigma_{J\\\\subseteq \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\dots,n\\\\\\\\}} \\\\det(A_J)\\\\det(A_{\\\\bar J}), where A_J is the submatrix of A induced by the rows and columns of A indexed by J, and \\\\bar J is the complement of J in \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\dots,n\\\\\\\\}, while the determinant of the empty submatrix is defined to be 1. (Actually the above expansion can be generalized in an arbitrary characteristic p as the following pair of dual identities: \\\\operatorname{per} (A) = (-1)^{n}\\\\Sigma_{{J_1},...,{J_{p-1}}} \\\\det(A_{J_1})...\\\\det(A_{J_{p-1}}) \\\\operatorname{det} (A) = (-1)^{n}\\\\Sigma_{{J_1},...,{J_{p-1}}} \\\\operatorname{per}(A_{J_1})...\\\\operatorname{per}(A_{J_{p-1}}) where in both formulas the sum is taken over all the (p-1)-tuples {J_1},...,{J_{p-1}} that are partitions of the set \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\dots,n\\\\\\\\} into p-1 subsets, some of them possibly empty. The former formula possesses an analog for the hafnian of a symmetric A and an odd p: \\\\operatorname{haf}^2(A) = (-1)^{n}\\\\Sigma_{{J_1},...,{J_{p-1}}} \\\\det(A_{J_1})...\\\\det(A_{J_{p-1}})(-1)^{J_1+...+J_{(p-1)/2}} with the sum taken over the same set of indexes. Moreover, in characteristic zero a similar convolution sum expression involving both the permanent and the determinant yields the Hamiltonian cycle polynomial (defined as \\\\operatorname{ham}(A)=\\\\sum_{\\\\sigma\\\\in H_n}\\\\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,\\\\sigma(i)} where {H_n} is the set of n-permutations having only one cycle): \\\\operatorname{ham} (A) = \\\\Sigma_{J\\\\subseteq \\\\\\\\{2,\\\\dots,n\\\\\\\\}} \\\\det(A_J)\\\\operatorname{per}(A_{\\\\bar J})(-1)^{J} . In characteristic 2 the latter equality turns into \\\\operatorname{ham} (A) = \\\\Sigma_{J\\\\subseteq \\\\\\\\{2,\\\\dots,n\\\\\\\\}} \\\\det(A_J)\\\\operatorname{det}(A_{\\\\bar J}) what therefore provides an opportunity to polynomial-time calculate the Hamiltonian cycle polynomial of any unitary U (i.e. such that U^{T} U = I where I is the identity nxn-matrix), because each minor of such a matrix coincides with its algebraic complement: \\\\operatorname{ham} (U) = \\\\operatorname{det}^2(U + I_{/1}) where I_{/1} is the identity nxn-matrix with the entry of indexes 1,1 replaced by 0. Moreover, it may, in turn, be further generalized for a unitary nxn-matrix U as \\\\operatorname{ham_K} (U) = \\\\operatorname{det}^2(U + I_{/K}) where K is a subset of {1,...,n}, I_{/K} is the identity nxn-matrix with the entries of indexes k,k replaced by 0 for all k belonging to K, and we define \\\\operatorname{ham_K}(A)=\\\\sum_{\\\\sigma\\\\in H_n{(K)}}\\\\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,\\\\sigma(i)} where {H_n{(K)}} is the set of n-permutations whose each cycle contains at least one element of K.) This formula implies the following identities over fields of characteristic 3: for any invertible A :\\\\operatorname{per}(A^{-1})\\\\operatorname{det}^2(A) = \\\\operatorname{per}(A) ; for any unitary U , i.e. a square matrix U such that U^{T} U = I \\\\, where I is the identity matrix of the corresponding size, :\\\\operatorname{per}^2(U) = \\\\det(U+V)\\\\det(-U) where V is the matrix whose entries are the cubes of the corresponding entries of U. It was also shown () that, if we define a square matrix A as k-semi-unitary when rank(A^{T} A - I \\\\,) = , the permanent of a 1-semi-unitary matrix is computable in polynomial time over fields of characteristic 3, while for > 1 the problem becomes #3-P-complete. (A parallel theory concerns the Hamiltonian cycle polynomial in characteristic 2: while computing it on the unitary matrices is polynomial-time feasible, the problem is #2-P-complete for the k-semi-unitary ones for any k > 0). The latter result was essentially extended in 2017 () and it was proven that in characteristic 3 there is a simple formula relating the permanents of a square matrix and its partial inverse (for A_{11} and A_{22} being square, A_{11} being invertible): \\\\operatorname{per}\\\\left ( \\\\begin{matrix}A_{11} & A_{12} A_{21} & A_{22}\\\\end{matrix} \\\\right) = \\\\operatorname{det}^{2}\\\\left ( A_{11} \\\\right )\\\\operatorname{per}\\\\left ( \\\\begin{matrix}A_{11}^{-1} & A_{11}^{-1}A_{12} A_{21}A_{11}^{-1} & A_{22}-A_{21}A_{11}^{-1}A_{12}\\\\end{matrix} \\\\right ) and it allows to polynomial-time reduce the computation of the permanent of an nxn- matrix with a subset of k or k-1 rows expressible as linear combinations of another (disjoint) subset of k rows to the computation of the permanent of an (n-k)x(n-k)- or (n-k+1)x(n-k+1)-matrix correspondingly, hence having introduced a compression operator (analogical to the Gaussian modification applied for calculating the determinant) that \\"preserves\\" the permanent in characteristic 3. (Analogically, it would be worth noting that the Hamiltonian cycle polynomial in characteristic 2 does possess its invariant matrix compressions as well, taking into account the fact that ham(A) = 0 for any nxn-matrix A having three equal rows or, if n > 2, a pair of indexes i,j such that its i-th and j-th rows are identical and its i-th and j-th columns are identical too.) The closure of that operator defined as the limit of its sequential application together with the transpose transformation (utilized each time the operator leaves the matrix intact) is also an operator mapping, when applied to classes of matrices, one class to another. While the compression operator maps the class of 1-semi-unitary matrices into itself and the classes of unitary and 2-semi-unitary ones, the compression-closure of the 1-semi-unitary class (as well as the class of matrices received from unitary ones through replacing one row by an arbitrary row vector — the permanent of such a matrix is, via the Laplace expansion, the sum of the permanents of 1-semi-unitary matrices and, accordingly, polynomial-time computable) is yet unknown and tensely related to the general problem of the permanent's computational complexity in characteristic 3 and the chief question of P versus NP: as it was shown in (), if such a compression-closure is the set of all square matrices over a field of characteristic 3 or, at least, contains a matrix class the permanent's computation on is #3-P-complete (like the class of 2-semi-unitary matrices) then the permanent is computable in polynomial time in this characteristic. Besides, the problem of finding and classifying any possible analogs of the permanent-preserving compressions existing in characteristic 3 for other prime characteristics was formulated (), while giving the following identity for an nxn matrix A and two n-vectors (having all their entries from the set {0,...,p-1}) \\\\alpha and \\\\beta such that {\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\alpha _{i}} = {\\\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\\\beta _{j}}, valid in an arbitrary prime characteristic p: \\\\operatorname{per}(A^{ \\\\left( \\\\alpha , \\\\beta \\\\right ) }) = \\\\operatorname{det}^{p-1}(A) \\\\operatorname{per}\\\\left ( A^{-1} \\\\right ) ^{\\\\left ( (p-1 \\\\right ){\\\\vec{1}}_{n}-\\\\beta ,\\\\left ( p-1 \\\\right ){\\\\vec{1}}_{n}-\\\\alpha)}(\\\\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\\\alpha _{i}!)(\\\\prod_{j=1}^{n}\\\\beta _{j}!)\\\\left ( -1 \\\\right )^{n+\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\alpha _{i}} where for an nxm- matrix M, an n-vector x and an m-vector y, both vectors having all their entries from the set {0,...,p-1}, M^{(x,y)} denotes the matrix received from M via repeating x_i times its i-th row for i = 1,...,n and y_j times its j-th column for j = 1,...,m (if some row's or column's multiplicity equals zero it would mean that the row or column was removed, and thus this notion is a generalization of the notion of submatrix), and {\\\\vec{1}}_{n} denotes the n-vector all whose entries equal unity. This identity is an exact analog of the classical formula expressing a matrix's minor through a minor of its inverse and hence demonstrates (once more) a kind of duality between the determinant and the permanent as relative immanants. (Actually its own analogue for the hafnian of a symmetric A and an odd prime p is \\\\operatorname{haf}^2(A^{ \\\\left( \\\\alpha , \\\\alpha \\\\right ) }) = \\\\operatorname{det}^{p-1}(A) \\\\operatorname{haf}^2\\\\left ( A^{-1} \\\\right ) ^{\\\\left ( (p-1 \\\\right ){\\\\vec{1}}_{n}-\\\\alpha ,\\\\left ( p-1 \\\\right ){\\\\vec{1}}_{n}-\\\\alpha)} (\\\\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\\\alpha _{i}!)^2( -1)^{n(p-1)/2 + n+ \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\alpha _{i}} ). And, as an even wider generalization for the partial inverse case in a prime characteristic p, for A_{11}, A_{22} being square, A_{11} being invertible and of size {n_1}x{n_1}, and {\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\alpha _{i}} = {\\\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\\\beta _{j}}, there holds also the identity \\\\operatorname{per}\\\\left ( \\\\begin{matrix}A_{11} & A_{12} A_{21} & A_{22}\\\\end{matrix} \\\\right)^{ \\\\left( \\\\alpha , \\\\beta \\\\right )} = \\\\operatorname{det}^{p-1}(A_{11}) \\\\operatorname{per} \\\\left ( \\\\begin{matrix}A_{11}^{-1} & A_{11}^{-1}A_{12} A_{21}A_{11}^{-1} & A_{22} - A_{21}A_{11}^{-1}A_{12}\\\\end{matrix} \\\\right ) ^{\\\\left ( (p-1 \\\\right ){\\\\vec{1}}_{n}-\\\\beta ,\\\\left ( p-1 \\\\right ){\\\\vec{1}}_{n}-\\\\alpha)}(\\\\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\\\alpha _{1,i}!)(\\\\prod_{j=1}^{n}\\\\beta _{1,j}!)\\\\left ( -1 \\\\right )^{n_{1}+\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\alpha _{1,i}} where the common row/column multiplicity vectors \\\\alpha and \\\\beta for the matrix A generate the corresponding row/column multiplicity vectors \\\\alpha_s and \\\\beta_t, s,t = 1,2, for its blocks (the same concerns A's partial inverse in the equality's right side). Approximate computation When the entries of A are nonnegative, the permanent can be computed approximately in probabilistic polynomial time, up to an error of εM, where M is the value of the permanent and ε > 0 is arbitrary. In other words, there exists a fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) (). The most difficult step in the computation is the construction of an algorithm to sample almost uniformly from the set of all perfect matchings in a given bipartite graph: in other words, a fully polynomial almost uniform sampler (FPAUS). This can be done using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that uses a Metropolis rule to define and run a Markov chain whose distribution is close to uniform, and whose mixing time is polynomial. It is possible to approximately count the number of perfect matchings in a graph via the self-reducibility of the permanent, by using the FPAUS in combination with a well-known reduction from sampling to counting due to . Let M(G) denote the number of perfect matchings in G. Roughly, for any particular edge e in G, by sampling many matchings in G and counting how many of them are matchings in G \\\\setminus e, one can obtain an estimate of the ratio \\\\rho=\\\\frac{M(G)}{M(G\\\\setminus e)}. The number M(G) is then \\\\rho M(G \\\\setminus e), where M(G \\\\setminus e) can be approximated by applying the same method recursively. Another class of matrices for which the permanent can be computed approximately, is the set of positive-semidefinite matrices (the complexity-theoretic problem of approximating the permanent of such matrices to within a multiplicative error is considered openSee open problem (4) at ). The corresponding randomized algorithm is based on the model of boson sampling and it uses the tools proper to quantum optics, to represent the permanent of positive-semidefinite matrices as the expected value of a specific random variable. The latter is then approximated by its sample mean. This algorithm, for a certain set of positive-semidefinite matrices, approximates their permanent in polynomial time up to an additive error, which is more reliable than that of the standard classical polynomial-time algorithm by Gurvits.

The gunman, 29-year-old unemployed teacher Heinz Schmidt from Sülze, indiscriminately shot at students and teachers, killing five girls and wounding more than 20 other people before being subdued by school staff. He was never tried for the crime and sent directly to an asylum where he died in 1932.Kills 3, wounds 17 in a classroom, The New York Times (21 June 1913)24 shot by madman, The Washington Post (21 June 1913)100 Jahre St. Marien - Geschichte einer Kirchengemeinde im Bremer Westen Der Probst segnete alle Klassen , Stadtteil-Kurier (September 13, 2007) Shooting At approximately 11:00 a.m. Heinz Schmidt entered St. Mary's Catholic School, carrying a briefcase packed with six to ten pistols (whether revolvers or semi-automatics depends on the source) and about 1000 rounds of ammunition, which he had bought several weeks prior to the shooting. Because of the large number of rounds, the owner of the gun-shop where Schmidt had bought his arsenal contacted police, though the incident was not found to be important and not investigated any further.Schreckenstat eines irrsinnigen Lehrers in einer Mädchenschule, Neue Freie Presse (June 21, 1913)Aus Nah und Fern, Coburger Zeitung (June 25, 1913) (p.3) In the hallway on the first floor Schmidt encountered Marie Pohl, a teacher at the school, who was just stepping out of classroom 8b, and, seeing his agitated appearance, questioned him about his business at school. Without answer, Schmidt proceeded to shoot at her, barely missing her head.Grauenhaftes Drama in einer Mädchenschule, Die Neue Zeitung (June 21, 1913) While Miss Pohl fled into a classroom nearby Schmidt entered room 8b, which was occupied by 65 girls, most of them being 6 or 7 years old, and immediately began firing at them. Also shooting at the children after they hid under their tables the gunman instantly killed two of them and wounded another 15.„Onkel, schieß uns nicht!“, KirchenZeitung (May 26, 2002) When the girls fled out of the classroom, Schmidt followed them, still shooting. While trying to escape, one of the girls fell down the stairs, broke her neck and died.Der Massenmord in der Mädchenschule, Prager Tagblatt (June 21, 1913) The gunman then went back and unsuccessfully tried to enter another classroom that had been locked by a teacher who had realized what had been happening. Schmidt shot at the school janitor, Butz, who attempted to apprehend him, hitting him in the face, before going upstairs where he was tackled by teacher Hubert Möllmann. When Schmidt managed to break free from Möllmann's grip he shot the teacher twice, hitting him in the stomach and shoulder, whereupon he proceeded to shoot out of a window at the children on the schoolyard, injuring five boys. The shots also wounded a roofer working nearby, who, together with his colleagues and other people alarmed by the shooting, then rushed into the school building, though as they arrived on the first floor the gunman had already been subdued by janitor Butz and a teacher named Hartlage. When Schmidt was led away by police he was met by an angry crowd outside, which beat him up and attempted to lynch him, until the police officers managed to hold the mob at bay with their sabres.Die Schreckenstat in der Bremer Marienschule, Freiburger Zeitung (June 24, 1913)Die Namen der Opfer sind nicht vergessen, Weser Kurier (June 16, 2013) In total, Schmidt had fired 35 rounds, three girls died instantly, while two more later succumbed to their wounds - the last victim dying some time in mid-JulyCasper, Johann Ludwig: Vierteljahrsschrift für gerichtliche Medizin und öffentliches Sanitätswesen; Hirschwald, 1914. - and 18 children, as well as three other persons were injured.Die Bluttat in der Mädchenschule, Prager Tagblatt (June 22, 1913) Victims Five schoolgirls had died in the shooting, one indirectly:Die Bluttat in der Mädchenschule, Die Neue Zeitung (June 22, 1913) *Anna Kubica, 7 *Sophie Gornisiewicz, died by falling down the stairs *Elsa Maria Herrmann, 7 *Elfriede Höger, 5, died four weeks after the shooting *Maria Anna Rychlik, 8 More than 30,000 people attended the funeral procession when the girls were brought to the cemetery. Kaiser Wilhelm who was on parade, was interrupted during it. When he heard about the shooting, he rescheduled the parade, along with all the last kings, highest leaders, and nobles. They were among the 30,000 in the funeral procession. After that, he passed tougher gun laws with the Reichstag. Der vergessene Held von Bremen, Bild (April 9, 2009) Perpetrator Heinz Jakob Friedrich Ernst Schmidt was born in Sülze on 24 September 1883. He worked as a teacher at a school in Stolp until May 1912, when he had to quit due to a mental breakdown. After a stay at a sanatorium and having to quit another job afterwards he went to Bremen in December the same year. People later described him as an odd and shy person. According to letters he had written, Schmidt felt strong resentments against the Jesuits, calling them a danger for the people and holding them responsible for the death of his father, a pastor, who had died the day before the shooting. Schmidt was examined at the St Jürgen-asylum in Ellen, where he was found to be insane.

Completed in 1907 and abandoned since the 1940s, the Waterworks have fallen into disrepair and are covered with graffiti. The Decatur Waterworks are in Mason Mill Park, near the city of Decatur.  Historical designation  On March 15, 2006, the Decatur Waterworks was added to the National Register of Historic Places, due to its former industrial significance as a water works, its political importance as Works Progress Administration (WPA) project, and its use as a public park.  History of the Decatur Water Works  Near Decatur Georgia, before the Civil War, in the 1850s, Ezekiel Mason built a flour mill on the bank of Burnt Fork Creek near where it flows into the south fork of Peachtree Creek. This is the mill from which Mason Mill Road and Mason Mill Park derive their names. After the deaths of Mr. Mason and his wife in the late 19th century the land was transferred to J. A. Mason, relationship unknown. The provenance of the property becomes unclear at that point as the DeKalb Historical Society notes show that the J. A. Mason sold the property to the City of Decatur, but Decatur City Council Minutes refer to the property as the \\"Tallery property\\", and an option was exercised with C. H. Talley for the purchase of land in October 1906. In any case, records show that a waterworks construction project was completed on the property by December 1907. By 1939, the Decatur Water Works consisted of two aeration and solid removal tanks, two storage tanks, an office building and two dams, one dam on South Peachtree Creek and one on Burnt Fork Creek. The remains of all of these structures can still be seen today and are often referred as ‘the old Decatur Water Works’. The Decatur Water Works supplied water to the city until the 1940s. Its use as a public park began in the 1930s when a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project built a number of recreational amenities on the site. These amenities included granite benches, cooking grills, tables and a stone bridge over Burnt Fork Creek. These things also can be seen today. The stone bridge is part of the new trail that has been recently constructed in the park. The WPA also built a stacked stone fountain that remains and can be seen very near the stone bridge. By 1941 it was apparent the of water per day produced by the water works was no longer enough to satisfy the growing needs of Decatur. The property was leased to DeKalb County, which operated the water works and sold the water to Decatur. DeKalb used revenue from the facility to fund a county- wide treatment plant in the Dunwoody area that uses water from the Chattahoochee River. Initially called the Laurel Plant, it is now called the Scott Candler Plant after the county commissioner who led the development process. During World War II the Decatur Water Works was used as the exclusive water supply for the Naval Air Station that is now Peachtree DeKalb Airport and an Army Hospital in the area. The property was declared off limits for civilian use and was not used for any recreational purpose or as a civilian water supply during the war. At the end of the war the water works land was returned to the City of Decatur and continued to be operated and maintained by the county as a backup for the new water system. The park area was not maintained and was not used by the public. For a time the office building at the water works was used for storage by the county. In 1951 a bond issue to finance development of the land was voted down. The water works fell into disuse and disrepair. By the mid-1960s the lakes had begun to fill with silt and there were complaints of flooding from local residents who lived in the adjacent neighborhoods that were built in the 1950s and 1960s. In about 1965 the dams were dynamited and the reservoirs drained. Present day In 1988 the county worked with local resident groups to make a development plan for Mason Mill Park that included the water works land, but the plan was never funded. In 2006 the Decatur Water Works was declared a historic site. A second plan was developed in 2008 and, with partial funding from the PATH Foundation, is being implemented.

It is about Julia Lukin, a nineteen-year-old brilliant musician who committed suicide twelve years earlier, who haunts the three men closest to her, through both the supernatural and in their memories. In 2008, it was presented as the first play of Things That Go Bump (2002 play Snake in the Grass and new play Life and Beth being parts two and three). Background The inspiration for Haunting Julia came the stage adaptation of The Woman in Black, written by Susan Hill, adapted for the stage by Stephen Mallatratt. It premièred at the Stephen Joseph Theatre (then at the Westwood site) in 1987, directed by Alan Ayckbourn's co-director, Robin Herford, whilst Ayckbourn was on sabbatical at the Royal National Theatre, London. He considered that the ability to make audiences jump was little to do with special effects and a lot to do with acting and a tense storyline.Preface to Plays 3 by Alan Ayckbourn, Faber & Faber This idea grew into Haunting Julia, performed seven years later. However, as Ayckbourn acknowledged, although the play remained a ghost story, the theme that grew to dominate the play were three men, and their relationships to Julia, a gifted musician who took her life aged nineteen.Programme notes from 1999 SJT tour. The departure from a straight ghost story may also have been down to Ayckbourn wishing to explore the conventions of the ghost story format rather than ghosts themselves.Allen, Paul (2004) A Pocket Guide to Alan Ayckbourn Plays Faber & Faber Ayckbourn deliberately sought to keep the character of Julia as one that ordinary teenage girls could relate to, in particular the way that ordinary parents push their children to achieve things on their behalf. Her character was also influenced by gifted people having little concept of the needs of others, like a \\"slight autism\\" – a characteristic Alan Ayckbourn said he slightly shares.Allen, Paul (2001) Alan Ayckbourn – Grinning at the Edge Methuen Nonetheless, Ayckbourn said he once felt the presence of his father's ghost in Scarborough a few years after his death. This play has the unique characteristic of being the only Ayckbourn play to have been written for the proscenium but premièred in the round. At the time of writing the play, it was planned that the Stephen Joseph Theatre would have moved to its new (and present-day) site at the old Odeon cinema, where there would be both a round and an end-stage theatre available. However, it turned out the new theatre was not ready until 1996. An idea to open the end-stage theatre concurrently with the existing theatre in the round was considered and quickly rejected, and Ayckbourn decided to go ahead with Haunting Julia at the current site as Westwood.Haunting Julia history on official Ayckbourn site Characters There are three male characters in the play, they are: * Joe Lukin, Julia's father, now in his sixties, never lets his daughter go, convinced there are unanswered questions about her death; * Andy Rollinson, generally considered Julia's student boyfriend, but unrequited admirer would be a more accurate description, now in his thirties; * Ken Chase, a gentle unassuming man in his forties who offers his service as a psychic to Joe, later discovered to have once been the janitor in Julia's house. There are also two voice parts in the play: one of Julia (or, more accurately, an actress imitating her voice speaking words the real Julia would probably never have said), and a sombre male voice talking about her death. It was originally intended that Joe would be the central character of the story, but Ayckbourn eventually considered the central character of the story to be Julia herself. He also considered two other offstage characters – Dolly, Joe's late wife, and Kay, the woman Andy married instead of Julia – to be strong characters.Interview of Ayckbourn for 2008 revival programme Setting The entire play takes place in the Julia Lukin Music Centre, an uneasy mixture between a public music facility and shrine from Joe to his daughter. The room in question is Julia's room as a student (albeit a far more tidy version than the real Julia's room), now with a walkway installed for public viewing. In a format used only the second time in a full-length Ayckbourn play, Haunting Julia is a 'real-time' play (Absent Friends being the first), with a single continuous scene running throughout the whole play. It was intended that the entire play would be performed without an interval to maximise the tension. However, an interval was inserted in certain productions due to pressure from falling bar takings. The published script is for the proscenium, but the Stephen Joseph theatre used both this format and the round format in various productions. The version in the round originally had the problem that the door to Julia's room that flies open dramatically at the end was invisible to part of the audience. This problem was addressed in the 2008 revival by making the entrance to the room a trapdoor instead. Synopsis Andy wanders into a near-perfect reproduction of Julia's room, says, in astonishment, \\"My God\\". He pushes a button, and a recorded voice of an actress as Julia Lukin speak, fondly talking about her room and her music. Then a man's voice solemnly announces that it was this room where she was found dead aged nineteen. Whilst he listens, Joe, Julia's father, joins him, and proudly talks about the exhibition. It is part of the Julia Lukin centre, the pet project of Joe that Andy was invited to see. Andy listens patiently and ignores some tactless remarks about his wife, but hints that he wants to get back to his family soon. Joe, however, insists Andy stays and listens to a couple of other Julia recordings. One of them has whispers of \\"No\\" in the background, and the other has an unhappy laugh – something which Joe believes is an attempt by Julia to contact him. Andy suggests that, after twelve years, it's time to let it go. Undeterred, Joe talks about Julia's childhood and her discovery, giving away that he dominated the lives of his daughter, and, also his wife, Dolly, who died recently. Understanding little about music himself, he is proud of the title the press gave her of \\"Little Miss Mozart\\" (something Julia actually hated). Joe questions the verdict of death by misadventure, and dismisses Andy's suggestion that the likely alternative was suicide. Although he doesn't suspect Andy, who was at a party the night she died, he suspects a man Julia referred to as \\"my secret admirer\\" (someone whom Andy now thinks she invented). The doorbell rings and Joe leaves. The guest, Ken Chase, arrives and introduces himself to Andy, as mortuary attendant who had \\"an enforced career change\\". When Joe returns (having rung Andy's wife, Kay, to say he'll he late), Ken correctly guesses Andy is a music teacher, before going on to claim he is a psychic. He explains, in a calm and factual manner, that it is a gift that most people could use if they wanted. Andy reacts to this with hostility, especially after discovering Ken is here at Joe's invitation after seeing the exhibition and writing him a letter. Ken crosses the ropes and, he claims, is struck with a feeling of unhappiness. This coincides with a coldness that Joe and Andy felt in the roped area (and, as it turns out, all the areas where the original house used to be). He opens the original door to the room but finds only a brick wall, for the other side now houses an air-conditioning plant. Asking for something close to Julia, he picks up the teddy bear, and (after setting off an alarm the first time), he reacts vigorously with emotion. Julia, he says, is unhappy, not because of Joe or Andy, who she loves, but because of the music. Then, promoted by hints dropped by Andy, Joe realises the bear is not Julia's but a replacement for the stolen original. Joe and Andy both now turn on Ken, who confesses he knew Julia (or \\"Julie\\" as he always referred to her). Andy realises he was the janitor who used to live in the basement. Ken admits he was Julia's \\"secret admirer\\", not, as Joe first assumes, a sexual relationship, but merely that she visited him and his family from time to time (in contrast to never visiting Joe who moved to be near her). She spent her time playing their out-of-tune piano, playing games, and helping with the cooking and sewing (badly), but never discussing her own music. Ken explains that on the afternoon before she died, she seemed a different person, saying, for the first time, she loved her parents, and he now wonders if it was her way of saying goodbye. Choosing to pretend they hardly knew her in the media scrum following her death, it is only now that he is setting the record straight. Agreeing they should go home, Ken and Andy leave Joe alone for a moment. A discordant piano starts playing, and Joe, shouting for Julia, flings open the door only to see the wall. Andy and Ken return, and whilst Joe searches for intruders, Ken politely confronts Andy, whom he saw leaving the house the day she died, and Andy confesses he knows the real reason she died. For over a year, he had been coming to her house and never had any affection returned, until he met Kay. On that day, he went to her house to tell Julia he was seeing Kay and probably wouldn't see her again, only to find her waiting for him, room tidied, hair brushed and bed made. When he went ahead and told her, she pleaded with him, and Andy, angry that she hadn't cared about his feelings all the time, left, went to a party, and got drunk. Returning to the music and the door, Andy, who has consistently dismissed supernatural explanations, suggests Joe may have set this all up himself. However, when the lights start dimming, a woman starts crying, and Joe returns denying anything to do with that; Ken suggests Andy is running out of options, and Andy begrudgingly agrees to wait and see. Joe talks about never seeing the body, and how his wife reacted violently when he told her the news. Suggesting it was just as well Joe didn't see the body, Andy tells them what he saw. Simplifying the events of the previous night to \\"a row\\", Andy says he went back in the morning thinking he should make things up. The first thing he saw was blood all over the sheets, for Julia had taken not only sleeping pills but everything she could get her hands on. He then saw her body between the bed and the desk, and he believes she tried to get back to her music. Suddenly, the piano plays again, and stops. Footsteps are heard where the stairs used to be, and there is a knock on the door, with Julia's voice saying \\"Dad ... dad ... dad ...\\" The door then flies open, and everything in the room is hurled about. Andy and Ken and thrown to the ground, but Joe, it seems, can see Julia. As he calls out to her, blood starts spreading out on the bed. Ken tells Joe that Julia is now released, and they both leave the room. Andy is the last to leave, saying once more \\"My God\\". After leaving, the voice of Julia plays one more time. Productions Programme cover for the 1999 revival Programme cover for the 2008 revival as part of Things That Go BumpThe original production at the Stephen Joseph Theatre had its first performance on 12 April 1994, and an opening night on 20 April 1994,Plays at a glance (Scarborough 1977–1995) on official Ayckbourn website featuring the following cast:Production details on Ayckbourn site * Joe – Ian Hogg * Andy- Damien Goodwin * Ken – Adrian McLoughlin * Voice of \\"Julia\\" – Cathy Sara The production team were: * Director – Alan Ayckbourn * Design – Roger Glossop * Lighting – Jackie Staines * Music – John Pattison Owing to the lack of an available end-stage theatre, the interval-free play was performed, in the round. This led to difficulties as some of the audience could not see the door that flies open at the end of the play. As a result, the play had mixed success. It did not tour, and the script was not published. In 1999, with the Stephen Joseph Theatre moved to its new venue and a proscenium theatre available, the play was revived in its intended end-stage format, with John Branwell as Joe, Bill Champion as Andy and Richard Derrington as Ken. Under pressure from bar takings, an interval was introduced into the play. This time, the play had more success, and the production toured, although it did not include London.UK Performances listed on Arts Archive The script was published as part of \\"Plays 3\\" in 2005, although the interval was removed from the published version. In 2008, Haunting Julia was again revived by Stephen Joseph Theatre Company as part of the Things That Go Bump trilogy, along with 2002 play Snake in the Grass (generally regarded as a female companion play) and new play Life and Beth, which combined the cast of these two plays. Ian Hogg and Adrian Adrian McLoughlin reprised their roles from 1994, with Richard Stacey playing the role of Andy. Richard Derrington also re-appeared as Director. With the other two plays written for the Round, it was decided to revert to a performance in the Round, and the problem with the door was overcome by changing it to a trapdoor. The interval was also removed. This play toured to New Vic Theatre as part of the trilogy.The Sentinel (Staffordshire), 6 September 2008 In 2012, Haunting Julia made its North American premiere at The Little Theatre of Norfolk,http://plays.alanayckbourn.net/styled-5/page10/American_Premieres.html with Joel Nathan King as Joe, Ryan McIntire as Andy and Philip Odango as Ken. Critical reviews Although the critics of the original production were unanimous in recognising the play as a new departure for Ayckbourn, the reviews were heavily polarised. Robin Thornber for The Guardian praised the play for building the character of Julia effective in spite of her never being on stage,The Guardian review, April 1994, held on Ayckbourn site as did David Jeffels of The Stage.The Stage review, April 1994, held on Ayckbourn site Kate Bassett for The Times drew comparisons with the child Wolfgang Mozart and the death of Kurt Cobain, although she had some doubts about the ending.The Times review, 26 April 1994, held on Ayckbourn site However, Charles Spencer of the Daily Telegraph held the opinion that the play aimed to be both a ghost story or a study of grief and failed to do either, although he liked the character of Ken and the final ten minutes.Daily Telegraph review, 26 April 1994, held on Ayckbourn site Paul Taylor for The Independent was just as scathing, dismissing Joe's shrine to Julia and Ken's 12-year wait to tell Joe what he knew as implausible.The Independent review, 25 April 1994, held on findarticles.com It has been suggested that the difference in opinion may have been down to reviewers being split between those who favoured Ayckbourn's move towards more contemporary themes, and those who preferred his earlier plays concentrating on social realism. The 1999 and 2008 revivals, however, were generally received positively. ReferencesExternal links * 'Haunting Julia' on official Ayckbourn site. * Arts Archive, UK performance listings.

It won the Origins Award for Best Traditional Card Game in 2005. Four expansion packs have been created since the release of the original game called, Unhappy Homes, Unwelcome Guests, Unquiet Dead and Unfortunate Expeditions. Additionally, In August 2011, Cthulhu Gloom, which serves as either a standalone game or a fourth expansion pack, was released, and one Cthulhu expansion pack has been released, called Unpleasant Dreams. Gameplay The game is for two to four players who each are given control of an eccentric family. The object of the game is to lower the self-worth points of the player's own family with cards that cause negative events, eventually killing them. At the same time, positive points are played on opponent's family members. After one family is completely killed off, the player with the lowest Family Value (the total points of all dead family members) is the winner of the game. Other Versions Expansion packs are available for the game, which each (except Unquiet Dead) add an additional family and allow for more than 4 players in the game. The packs also include new modifiers and Untimely Deaths. In 2013 a limited number of the TableTop Gloom Promo Expansion was released. Including in the deck are two unwanted guests (TableTop host Wil Wheaton and Felicia Day) that can wander from family to family. There are also several spin-offs of the game, which are played separately from the original Gloom: * Cthulhu Gloom uses a Lovecraftian theme for the game. A new element in that game are Story cards, which add special effects through the game, or extra points at the conclusion of the game. Cthulhu Gloom can be played with 5 players without an expansion pack. * Munchkin Gloom is based on the Munchkin series of card games from Steve Jackson Games. It was released in the summer of 2015.WORLD OF MUNCHKIN page on MUNCHKIN GLOOM * Fairytale Gloom brings classic fairy tale characters and other elements to Gloom's unhappy setting. The game was released June 2015.Fairytale Gloom page on Atlus Games' website * Gloom in Space uses science fiction tropes and characters, many of which are nods to sci-fi favorites like Han Solo or The Doctor. It was released in early 2017. Critical reception An element of the game that was appreciated by game designer Greg Costikyan was the optional aspect of storytelling involved when playing an event card, where a player can choose to explain the events that happen in the course of the character's life. Costikyan stated that this added \\"a unique aspect to game play and [made] the game play particularly enjoyable\\".

Dean of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences 1973-5. Dean 1993–2006 of the European Faculty (now European Academy) of Land Use and Development. Lenk started out with the philosophy of science and the foundation of logics (notably his habilitation thesis on the Critique of Logical Constants, 1968) and later on, since 1978, included epistemology and pragmatic methodology of the social and natural sciences, technology+ economics, neuroscience and the philosophy of language in several books on Interpretative Constructs (1993) and Schema Games (1995). Since 1978 he developed his basic epistemological methodology of what he calls “methodological (scheme-)interpretationism” focused on a pragmatic and constructive realism a bit similar to Putnam's internal realism and much earlier and more general than the according recent perspectivism in US philosophy of science. Since then he extended and differentiated Wittgenstein’s later conception of “language games” toward “schema games” connecting and activating these with neuroscientific findings and analyses (for neurophilosophy cf. his book Consciousness as Scheme-Interpretation 2004). In applied philosophy he published rather many studies and books on performance and achievement (not only in sport), social responsibility (see, e.g., Mitcham's Encyclopedia on Science, Technology and Ethics (2005, 2015 2nd ed.)), and social philosophy of technology. Lately, he turned to several books on Concrete Humanity 1988 and sustainability 2009 and Philosophical Anthropology 2010, 2013. Lenk's autobiographical memorial recollections on Ratzeburger Goldwasser (Ratzeburg’s Golden Waters) 2013 and Golden Day at Lago Albano 2015 present a lively overview of his athletic and academic career stages (except the three US visiting professorships). Lenk's academic specializations comprise amongst others: epistemology, methodology and philosophy of science, incl. social sciences and technology, systems theory, neurosciences, anthropology, theoretical sociology, action theory, philosophy and psychology of creativity, achievement motivation and group dynamics, neuro- and moral philosophy as well as applied ethics, sport science and philosophy of sport.

Background and writing The song was written about Journey's city of origin, San Francisco, although it was actually written in and originally intended to be about Los Angeles. It was one of Steve Perry's first Journey songs, and was recorded soon after joining the band. In an interview, Perry said, \\"I had the song written in Los Angeles almost completely except for the bridge and it was written about Los Angeles. It was 'when the lights go down in the city and the sun shines on LA.' I didn't like the way it sounded at the time. And so I just had it sitting back in the corner. Then life changed my plans once again, and I was now facing joining Journey. I love San Francisco, the bay, and the whole thing. 'The bay' fit so nice, 'When the lights go down in the city and the sun shines on the bay.' It was one of those early-morning-going-across-the-bridge things, when the sun was coming up and the lights were going down. It was perfect.\\" Released as a single in 1978, it was originally a minor hit, reaching number 68 on the Billboard Hot 100 at the time. It has, however, become more popular over the years and is now one of Journey's most popular and easily recognizable songs and is often played in Classic Hits/Oldies radio stations. It is frequently played at San Francisco Giants baseball games (including versions led by Perry himself at Game 2 of the 2010 World Series, Games 1 and 2 of the 2012 World Series, and Games 4 and 5 of the 2014 World Series) and the cross-bay Oakland Athletics after-game fireworks starts. The song is now usually played at Levi's Stadium when the NFL San Francisco 49ers win a home game. It is sometimes used in promos for the Golden State Warriors. Journey released a live version of the song in 1993 for the Time³ box set. This recording reached #30 on the Adult Contemporary chart. The song was the last to be played during the Top 40 era of KFRC 610, a legendary San Francisco station, before the flip to a nostalgia/adult standards format in 1986. KIII of Corpus Christi, Texas used this song during their sign offs in the late 1980s.

He is not to be confused with his uncle, Anton Gerard van Hamel (1842 – 1907), who was a theologian, professor of French and editor of De Gids.The following is based primarily on Marc Schneiders' biography and Maartje Draak's obituary, cited below. Education Having completed secondary education at the municipal grammar school (now Barlaeus Gymnasium) in Amsterdam, Van Hamel went on to study Dutch language and literature at the University of Amsterdam (UvA) between 1904 and 1908. In addition, he attended colleges and private schools in Ireland and Germany. An avid student, he published articles in Propria Cures on (early) Germanic and Celtic studies, subjects which would later become his special field of expertise.Between 1906 and 1909, he was editor of Propria Cures. In 1911, he was awarded a doctorate, cum laude, for his research on De oudste Keltische en Angelsaksische geschiedbronnen (‘The oldest Celtic and Anglo-Saxon historical sources’) under the supervision of R.C. Boer. Early career (1910–1923) Van Hamel’s early career was characterised by a number of ebbs and flows, in which his ambition to obtain an academic chair of his preference was thwarted by either controversy or misfortune. In 1910, Van Hamel taught Dutch at the municipal grammar school in Middelburg, but felt unhappy about his position and low pay. In 1912, an attempt to obtain the chair of English professor at the UvA failed as he was openly accused of a poor grasp of English. The same year, he was teaching Dutch again, then at the Erasmiaansch Gymnasium in Rotterdam. New prospects emerged during the First World War, when he received the post of extraordinary professor of Dutch language and literature at the University of Bonn. However, troublesome experiences with the German government led Van Hamel to return to The Netherlands — ostensibly in order to visit his ill father, but he did not return to Germany. In 1917, he found a position as librarian at the Netherlands School of Commerce (Nederlandsche Handels-Hoogeschool) in Rotterdam. His nomination in 1918 for the chair of Dutch language and literature held by Jan te Winkel at the UvA projected him unfavourably into the spotlight, as several linguists voiced their objections, often in favour of another scholar of their choice. Van Hamel remained librarian, though he saw opportunity to combine his work with a private teaching position of Celtic at Leiden University. In 1921, he moved from Rotterdam to Den Haag, being appointed librarian of the Peace Palace.  Chair of early Germanic and Celtic studies (1923)  1923 finally saw a breakthrough in Van Hamel’s career. After eleven years of fruitless endeavours and cul-de- sacs, he obtained the Chair of early Germanic studies at the State University of Utrecht. Significantly, Celtic studies were added to the chair’s curriculum at his special request, as he was convinced, and convinced others, that the two disciplines were closely related. His improved situation enabled him to devote his time and energy more fully to the publication of text editions and critical studies. In 1925, Van Hamel became a member of the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences (Koninklijke Akademie van Wetenschappen). Late 1930s – Second World War A new personal crisis unfolded towards the close of the 1930s, when Van Hamel’s writing output came to a standstill. The interruption was related to political developments which were spreading over Europe, but possibly also to his homosexual nature. During the Second World War and the German occupation of the Netherlands, A.G. van Hamel came to be active again, but the new situation stood in the way of communication with foreign contacts and greatly limited his prospects at publication. After the academic crisis of 1943, when the Germans had unsuccessfully attempted to impose a ‘declaration of loyalty’ on all students and faculty members, Van Hamel’s work for the university was quickly slimmed down and he therefore focused on his publications instead. Death About six months after the liberation of The Netherlands, Van Hamel was suddenly hospitalised for an emergency surgery due to an intestinal disease. He died in narcosis, aged 59.

He was Professor and Director of the Classics Department at the University of Nottingham from 1948 to 1979, and a Fellow of the British Academy. Thompson was a pioneer in the study of Late Antiquity, and was for decades the most prominent British scholar in this field. He was particularly interested in the relations between Ancient Rome and \\"barbarian\\" peoples such as the Huns and Visigoths, and has been credited with revitalizing English-language scholarship on the history of early Germanic peoples. Thompson's works on these subjects have been highly influential. Early life Edward Arthur Thompson was born on 22 May 1914 in the town of Waterford, Ireland to a strictly Presbyterian family. His father, Robert James Thompson, who was of Irish descent, was the son of a weaver and worked for the National Health Insurance. His mother, Margaret Murison, was of Scottish descent. Her parents had settled in Ireland when her father became the manager of the estate of the Earl of Ormond in County Kilkenny. Thompson's family moved to Dublin in 1922. Having graduated from The High School, Dublin, Thompson entered Trinity College Dublin with a sizarship, a distinction he shared with Jonathan Swift. He was the first of his family to enter university. His father had probably intended for him to become a Presbyterian minister, but Thompson would come to reject the religious puritanism of his family. Thompson graduated with first class honours in classics from Trinity College in 1936, later attributing his selection of the classics as a discipline to the choice of his headmaster at The High School. His B.Litt. on the Arcadian League was supervised by H. W. Parker. From 1937–1938, Thompson was an exchange student in Berlin. While in Germany, Thompson developed an intense dislike for Nazism. He recalled having witnessed the smashing of a jeweler's shop and the beating of its proprietor by a Nazi mob. These experiences had a major influence on Thompson's future cautious approach to the study of Germanic peoples, which was to characterize his approach to this subject. Early career Extent of the Visigothic Kingdom (700 AD), which was the subject of numerous studies by Thompson Thompson was appointed a lecturer in classics at Trinity College Dublin in 1939. Although initially appointed for one year, Thompson's contract was renewed, and he stayed on (though at a reduced salary) until 1941. Already prepared to enter World War II with an enlistment in the British Army, Thompson secured an appointment at the University of Swansea in 1941 through the help of his friend Benjamin Farrington. From Swansea, Thompson transferred to King's College, London, teaching as a classics lecturer from 1945 to 1948. At Swansea, Thompson became a close friend of fellow historian Norman H. Baynes. His first book, Ammianus Marcellinus (1947), played a major role in reviving the study of late antiquity in the United Kingdom.. His next book, A History of Attila and the Huns (1948), was inspired by his work on Ammianus Marcellinus. Both of these works were later reprinted and remained standard works on the subject for several decades. From the late 1940s, Thompson dedicated all his scholarly interest towards to Late Antiquity. Career at the University of Nottingham Thompson moved again in 1948this time to direct the classics department at the University of Nottingham, where he worked from 1948 to 1979. During this time, Thompson was along with A. H. M. Jones a major figure in reviving the study of Late Antiquity in the United Kingdom. He was considered the leading scholar in the United Kingdom in the field, with the University of Nottinhgham emerging as one of its principal centers of study. At Nottingham, Thompson focused mainly on research and teaching rather than administrative work. Distinguished members of the his department at this time included Harold Mattingly, W. Charlmers, G. R. Watson, Mollie Whittaker, A. H. Sommerstein and J. W. Rich. In 1951, perhaps inspired by Farrington, Thompson published the book A Roman Reformer and Inventor, which examined the anonymous author of the De rebus bellicis. Thompsons book helped build the foundations for modern studies on this work. By the early 1950s, Thompson's research was increasingly focused on the early Germanic peoples. At this time, very little research had been carried out in this field in the English-speaking world. Thompson sought to approach the subject without ideological ballast. Nevertheless, his revulsion towards Nazism probably influenced his research of this field. His works were pioneering in the field of Germanic studies, in which he was the leading scholar of his generation. He helped detach the field from the ideological bias which had characterized it in the past. Thompson published his work The Early Germans in 1965, which was largely concerned with the changing structure of Germanic society through its encounter with Roman Empire. He attributed increasing social stratification among the Germanic peoples of the early centuries AD to the influence of the Roman Empire. He was particularly interested in the Christianisation of the Germanic peoples, and the differences between Germanic peoples who converted to Arianism and Roman Catholicism. His next major studies, The Visigoths in the Time of Ulfila (1965) and The Goths in Spain (1969), centered on the Visigoths. His works on early Germanic peoples, particularly those on the Visigoths, quickly became standard reference works on the subject, and were still considered unsurpassed at the time of his death. Thompson's studies on the Visigoths particularly examined the relations between various classes of Visigothic society with the Roman population among whom they lived. He maintained that while the Visigothic elite sought to adapt to and further develop Roman society, the Visigothic rank-and-file sought to overthrow it altogether. Thompson's reliance on literary evidence and aim to present a coherent account of history, distinguished him from many more recent historians, who are heavily influenced by critical theory and consider primary sources unreliable. Thompson was not afraid of controversy, and his criticism of others' views could be hard-hitting. Until his retirement in 1979, Thompson served as the first Chairman of the Editorial Board of the scholarly journal Nottingham Medieval Studies, founded by Lewis Thorpe in 1957. Under Thompson's leadership, it rapidly emerged a major journal in its field. Thompson was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1964the first University of Nottingham academic to be so honored. On the death of A. H. M. Jones in 1970, Thompson was made Chairman of the Academy's committee supervising the Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire project. Later life Thompson retired from the University of Nottingham in 1979. After his retirement Thompson spent a year at the University of Wisconsin, during which he produced four major papers which were later printed in the collection Romans and Barbarians: the Decline of the Western Empire (1982). Thompson subsequently shifted his focus to the end of Roman Britain, on which he published the monographs Saint Germanus of Auxerre and the End of Roman Britain (1984) and Who was Saint Patrick? (1985). In his studies of post-Roman Britain, Thompson argued that literary evidence implied that the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain was characterized by discontinuity and widespread upheaval. By the 1980s, this interpretation had fallen somewhat out of fashion, particularly among archaeologists. Thompson died in Nottingham on 1 January 1994. Politics Thompson's revulsion towards Nazism, and his rejection of the strict Presbyterianism of his family, made him receptive towards Marxist ideology, which was popular among intellectuals in the 1930s. He was particularly impressed by the works of Friedrich Engels and Vladimir Lenin. Influenced by Benjamin Farrington and the poet Roger Roughton, Thompson joined the Communist Party of Great Britain by 1941. The influence of Marxism is present in Thompson's works on a wide variety of subjects. This influence is particularly detectible in his studies on the rebellions of the Bagaudae. Thompson left the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1956, the year of the Soviet Union's intervention in Hungary. In later life he referred to himself as a Thompsonist rather than a Marxist. His academic work continued to demonstrate a Marxist-oriented outlook on history. The class structure of societies continued to play a central role in his studies. No longer playing an active part in politics, he maintained an enthusiastic interest. He was strongly opposed to the Soviet handling of the Prague Spring, and criticised British policy in Northern Ireland, particularly sectarian violence. Personal life While lecturing at King's College Thompson met his first wife Thelma Marjorie Phelps, a physician, whom he married in 1945. They had a son and a daughter, but separated in 1958. In 1964 he married Hazel Joyce Casken, with whom he had a daughter and lived until his death.

He emigrated to the United States in 1869, settling in Racine, Wisconsin. There he started a food company with his brother, James. Horlick was a well-known philanthropist in the Racine area. He was also a major sponsor of the Racine Legion, which played in the National Football League from 1922 until 1924. He died 25 September 1936 at the age of ninety. BiographyEarly life and family= He was born in Ruardean, in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, England, the youngest surviving child of James Horlick (1809–1878), a saddler, and his wife Priscilla Griffiths (1817–1874). He was sent to school in Hampshire with his brothers Peter (1842–1901) and James (1844–1921), before becoming apprenticed to a local saddler. At the same time, his brother James began working for the Mellin Food Company in London, which produced a powdered baby food from malt and bran. When at home in Ruardean, James, William and their father began experimenting with ways of making a granulated powder based on wheat and malted barley which could be stored for long periods in sealed containers.Andrew Gardiner, The development of Horlick Malted Milk and Infant Food, The New Regard (Journal of the Forest of Dean Local History Society), no.27, 2013, pp.39-45 =Malted milk= After immigrating to the US in 1869, Horlick settled in Racine. In 1872, he moved to Chicago to begin a food manufacturing business with his brother, James. This was the genesis of the Horlick Food Company, which the two founded in 1875, and moved to Racine in 1876. At around the same time, William began working on creating a dried milk product. This work culminated with a US patent in 1883 and a product that was originally called \\"Diastoid,\\" but was later trademarked as \\"malted milk\\" in 1887. The company continued to expand, with new branches opening in New York City in 1889, and in England after James returned there in 1890. James Horlick was knighted in 1914, and raised to the baronetcy of Cowley Manor. Leigh Rayment, Horlick baronets. Retrieved 6 February 2013 New manufacturing plants were opened in Racine in 1902 and 1905. William served as the company's treasurer until his brother's death in 1921, at which time he became company president, holding that position until his death in 1936. =Philanthropy= Horlick was a prominent philanthropist, especially in the Racine area. Gifts in Racine include Memorial Hall, a maternity wing at St. Luke's Hospital (in memory of his daughter Alice), Island Park, and Horlick Athletic Field, and the land for the high school named in his honour (William Horlick High School). Horlick also supported several polar expeditions, including one to the Antarctic by Richard Byrd and another to the North Pole by Roald Amundsen. Horlick not only supported the expeditions financially, but his malted milk also provided non-perishable nutrition for the explorers. Because of his contributions, Byrd named the Horlick Mountains in Antarctica after William Horlick. =Pro Football= In 1919, Horlick sponsored what was then called the \\"Horlick-Racine Legion\\". The team was sponsored by him and the American Legion Racine Post no. 76. Horlick paid the debts incurred for operating the Racine Legion. He also gave free use of his athletic field to both the Horlick-Racine Legion and Racine Tornadoes Football teams. He contributed substantial sums of money to convert Horlick Athletic Field to accommodate professional football and expended over $100,000 to cover the expenses of three 1920s seasons.http://racinelegion.com/custom2_2.html =Personal life= He married his second cousin Arabella Horlick (1850–1938) in 1870, while in the US.

Description This slug species is up to 40mm when mature. It is listed as 50 mm long in Welter-Schultes Animalbase (Welter-Schultes). It is a roundback slug. Its color is dark grey (sometimes with bluish hue) or brown. The mantle has dark spots. The sides are usually lighter near the foot-fringe, and have one dark longitudinal band on each side; the one on the right runs above the pneumostome. The dorsum often has a very slight keel and the slug is bell-shaped in transverse section when it is contracted. The sole is whitish, and the mucus colourless. Genitalia: the atrium is large; the epiphallus is heavily pigmented and wider than the vas deferens; the oviduct is short and not narrow; the spermatheca is elongate.

The species was first described by Sven Nilsson in 1823.  Distribution  Arion fasciatus is originally from Northern Europe, but it has spread to other cool, wet climates, including the British Isles, Canada and the Northern United States. The species was presumably first brought across the Atlantic Ocean during the colonial era. These slugs are generally found in ecotonal habitats.  Description  Arion fasciatus is in many ways similar to most other stylommatophoran slugs. They are hermaphroditic. They have a head, mantle, and foot. There are two sets of retractable tentacles on their heads: the upper pair have light-sensing organs, and the lower two are used to smell. These slugs have a mantle that covers much of the top of the first third of the body, with its pneumostome located on the back right portion of the mantle. The foot has three sections horizontally across. On the lower part of the head, the mouth and radula are situated. The orange banded arion has a darkened stripe that extends along the entire body and mantle length on both sides of the body, and is gray, off-white, or tan, with a very light-colored foot. Arion fasciatus is about six centimeters in length when moving, secreting a clear mucus which is also left behind it and visible as a trail. However, when disturbed, the mucus becomes denser and stickier. A study found that this thicker mucus can prevent predation by Carabid beetles, but that this special mucus becomes exhausted after three minutes of stimulation. It then takes up to a day to get mucus production up to pre-attack levels, leaving the slug susceptible to other predators.  Feeding habits  Although the orange-banded arion will eat fresh vegetable matter, a study on the eating habits of Arion fasciatus found that it does not find fresh leaves as palatable as old dead leaves, likely because these slugs generally feed under the leaf litter layer. This study also found that the diet of the orange- banded arion is variable throughout the year. For example, there is an increase in animal material eaten during May and June. The hypothesis is that during the colder months, slugs don't move around much under the leaf litter, and take in a lot of leaves where the chlorophyll has already broken down, but during the warmer months, they take advantage of dead earthworms and small arthropods, both of which have high mortality rates. Taxonomy The original description of the three slugs in the subgenus Carinarion, Arion (Carinarion) fasciatus, Arion (Carinarion) silvaticus and Arion (Carinarion) circumscriptus was based on small differences in body pigmentation and details of the genital anatomy.

It is native to Western Europe, and it is known as an introduced species in many other regions, including North America, Australia, New Zealand, North Africa, South Africa, and the Pacific Islands. Description This slug is 1.5 to 2 centimeters long. It is variable in color and patterning, being white, orange, or gray, with or without banding, and it has gray tentacles and a yellow or orange sole. It becomes compact and \\"nearly bell-shaped\\" when contracted. The tubercles that texture the dorsal surface of its body taper to sharp, prickle- like points, inspiring the common name hedgehog slug. Biology This species occurs in natural habitat such as grasslands and forests, and on cultivated or otherwise human-altered land, such as pastures, orchards, and hedges. It feeds on plants and fungi.Slugs: A Guide to the Invasive and Native Fauna of California. Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources. University of California. 2009. For a long time, this hermaphroditic slug was thought to reproduce only by self-fertilization; solitary captive specimens produced offspring and the species had never been observed mating. Genetic analysis provided evidence of crossing and the species is now believed to have a mixed breeding system, with an individual having the ability to fertilize itself or cross-fertilize, exchanging sperm with a mate. In the wild it has one generation per year (univoltine), with all individuals maturing rather synchronously in autumn. Adults die over winter or early spring. As a pest This is not considered to be a severe pest, but some reports of such problems have been made. While most exotic slugs and snails are often found in altered environments, this species has a greater tendency to invade natural habitat, such as forests. Its ability to self-fertilize allows a single individual to enter new habitat and then reproduce.Cádiz, F. J. and C. S. Gallardo. (2007).

The movement was a reaction to the war. Cubism was partially abandoned even by its co-creator Picasso. Futurism, which had praised machinery, dynamism, violence and war, was rejected by most of its adherents. The return to order was associated with a revival of classicism and realistic painting. This change of direction was reflected and encouraged by the magazine Valori plastici published in Italian and French from 1918 to 1922. The term return to order to describe this renewed interest in tradition is said to derive from Le rappel a l'ordre, a book of essays by the poet and artist Jean Cocteau published in 1926.

As a World War II wing commander he was the only member of the Royal Air Force Equipment Branch to be awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Until his death he was the oldest surviving British Olympic gold medallist. Early life and Olympic success George was born at Bath, Somerset, the third son (fourth child) of John Ellis George and May Louise George. He was educated at Wycliffe College and Lincoln College, Oxford. He started rowing at Oxford, but was not yet at a standard to compete in the Boat Race. After one race a doctor ordered him never to set foot in a boat again as he was so exhausted. He entered business with E. S. & A. Robinson(later part of Dickinson Robinson Group), a firm of printers and packing manufacturers in Bristol, and in 1929 he was transferred to the London office in Colliers Wood, which gave him the opportunity to start rowing again. In 1930 he joined Thames Rowing Club. In 1931 at Henley Royal Regatta, he was in the winning Thames coxless four in the Wyfold Challenge Cup and in the Thames eight that lost narrowly in the final of the Grand Challenge Cup. In 1932 at Henley he was in the runner-up Thames eight in the final of the Grand again and was also the winning Thames crew in the Stewards Challenge Cup. The Thames coxless four was then chosen to represent Great Britain rowing at the 1932 Summer Olympics and won the gold medal in a hard race against the German crew.Sports Reference Olympic Sports - Rowland George George married Hon. Sylvia Beatrice Norton, daughter of Cecil Norton, 1st Baron Rathcreedan and Marguerite Cecil Huntington, at St Mary's Henley on 22 April 1933 and had three sons and a daughter. the Peerage.com World War II In World War II, George joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve serving in the Equipment Branch as he was too old for flying training. He was commissioned as an acting pilot officer on 9 November 1939, promoted pilot officer on 8 January 1940 flying officer on 1 December 1940, and temporary flight lieutenant on 1 March 1942. In late 1942, as an acting squadron leader, he commanded the RAF unit responsible for supplies passing through the harbour at Bone, Algeria, as part of the Operation Torch landings. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1943 King's Birthday Honours in recognition of his efforts supporting the operation while under considerable harassment from the Luftwaffe.Honours and awards of RAF Beach Unit personnel In 1943 as an acting wing commander, and due to the reputation he had gained in Algeria, he was appointed to the staff planning the Allied invasion of Sicily. He was in charge of the supply system from the beaches to the airfields during the Salerno landings. He landed on the beaches with the first assault troops on 10 September 1943 and came under fire on the beaches and on the way to the supply dumps and airfields. He carried on even though he was wounded when his tented camp was hit by two bombs. He was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Service Order, and the citation published on 26 May 1944 read: He was also Mentioned in Despatches on 14 January 1944, and again on 8 June 1944. Though an acting wing commander, his substantive rank was still flight lieutenant, he was promoted war substantive squadron leader on 18 June 1944. He was also awarded the US Legion of Merit (degree of Officer) in 1944. Later life After the war George returned to work for Robinsons, becoming Managing Director of their subsidiaries in Colliers Wood and, later, Ipswich. He retained an RAFVR commission and on 13 April 1948 transferred to the Royal Auxiliary Air Force as a squadron leader in the Aircraft Control Branch. He became commanding officer of the County of Suffolk Fighter Control Unit, relinquishing the post on 1 June 1951 when he transferred to the reserve. He also returned to Colliers Wood at this time. In 1959 George took early retirement as he wished to return to his roots in Bath. Here he was active as a Christian Scientist, and was also chairman of the Bath Council of Social Services, the Bath Society for the Blind and secretary of the Bath Preservation Trust. He was increasingly affected by deafness resulting from his war service, but this did not prevent him learning Spanish when he was invited to the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, a guest of the British Olympic Association 60 years after winning in Los Angeles.

The white space represents a disruption of the nerve fibers, resulting in a loss of nerve supply to the muscle fibers. Denervation is any loss of nerve supply regardless of the cause. If the nerves lost to denervation are part of the neuronal communication to a specific function in the body then altered or a loss of physiological functioning can occur. Denervation can be caused by injury or be a symptom of a disorder like ALS and post-polio syndrome. Additionally, it can be a useful surgical technique to alleviate major negative symptoms, such as in renal denervation. Denervation can have many harmful side effects such as increased risk of infection and tissue dysfunction.  Causes  The loss of nerve supply can be caused by injury, disorders, or result from a surgical procedure. = Injuries = Denervation may be the result of nerve injury. The three main types of nerve injury are neurapraxia, axonotmesis and neurotmesis. These three types distinguish between the severity of the nerve damage and the potential for recovery after the damage. After an injury in which some nerves are damaged, the brain has shown capabilities in rewiring or rearranging neuronal circuitry. This plasticity allows for the brain to compensate for the loss in neuronal communication resulting from injury. = Disorders = Denervation processes have a strong association with the symptoms seen in post-polio syndrome. Those with post polio syndrome are undergoing a constant process of denervation and reinnervation. This process occurs after acute poliomyelitis and leads to increased motor unit areas over time. The motor unit areas soon increase to a point where reinnervation is no longer possible causing an uncompensated denervation of motor units which leads to muscle atrophy and loss of muscular strength. Following an acute polio infection diagnosis symptoms such as fatiguability, general weakness and pain are believed to be correlated to muscle denervation. Much like post-polio syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis also has similar symptoms of motor neuron degeneration leading to general weakness and in some cases paralysis. The type of symptoms experienced can depend on which particular areas of the body experience the loss in nerve supply. This process of denervation is however different from post-polio syndrome in that it only involves upper and lower motor neuron degeneration and does not experience a process of constant reinnervation and denervation. = Surgical procedures = In addition to peripheral nerve injury, denervation is used as a medical procedure for various benefits resulting from eliminating nerve supply to a specific area of the body. In renal denervation, the procedure involves using radio frequency or ultrasound to remove sympathetic nerve supply to the wall of the kidney with the intention of reducing blood pressure and treating chronic hypertension. However, renal denervation is used less frequently in recent years due to new evidence suggesting that blood pressure is not significantly reduced after the procedure and there are even recommendations against using the procedure since there has been little proof to show that renal denervation leads to reduced blood pressure. Other prevalent surgical procedures involve intentionally reducing nerve supply to treat a variety of disorders. In a sympathectomy, a sympathetic ganglion is surgically removed to treat hyperhidrosis, or excessive sweating. In a vagotomy, the vagus nerve is surgically removed to treat peptic ulcer disease through reducing stomach acid. In a rhizotomy, nerve fibers in the spinal cord are removed in the hopes of eliminating chronic muscle pain.  Physiological differences  In regard to skeletal muscle denervation there are two distinct diagnoses: entrapment and compressive neuropathies or non-entrapment neuropathies. Entrapment and compressive neuropathy syndromes occur due to compression and/or constriction on a specific location for a segment of a single nerve or multiple nerve sites. This entrapment or compression can be diagnosed based on multiple factors including physical examination, electrodiagnostic test and clinical history. Following denervation, muscular atrophy and degeneration occurs within affected skeletal muscle tissue. Within the skeletal tissue is observable progressive loss of weight of denervated muscles as well as reduction in muscle fiber size and quantity. These muscles exhibit a slowing of contraction speed, a reduction of developed tension, and twitch force. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and high-resolution ultrasonography (US) are two clinical imaging examinations performed to classify the different diagnoses. Ultrasonography is advantageous with the evaluation of peripheral nerve resolutions while Magnetic Resonance Imaging is more sensitive in regard to signal intensity changes of the muscle. Denervation affects the muscle activation process that is brought on by the development and propagation of an action potential and the ensuing release of calcium. It is found that there is an increase with calcium reuptake because of changes within sarcoplasmic reticulum morphology and structure. As a result there is a decrease in amplitude and velocity of impulse conduction with an increase in muscle spike duration. In clinical and experimental studies there is an observed increase in muscle excitability in electrical currents involving chemical actions, while there is a decrease in excitability to current associated with electrical induction in denervated muscles. Changes in the resting membrane potential involving denervated muscles presents mild depolarization when a muscle contraction stimulus is present. While there is no immediate change involving resting and action potential, there is an increase with membrane resistance. After prolonged denervation, it is revealed that resting membrane potential over time is reduced while action potentials progressively decreased and become slower. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that becomes supersensitive in the presence of denervated muscle. Upon injection of acetylcholine, a slower contractile response, which is drastically under action potential threshold, is elicited.  Reinnervation possibilities  Denervated muscles have shown the ability to survive after periods of denervation or in the case of a damaged nerve. The size of the nerve and its ability to function can be maintained if it is electrically stimulated soon after denervation, in clinical experiments. home-based functional electrical stimulation has been shown to rescue muscles which have experienced severe atrophy as a result of denervation. This process involves electrically stimulating the nerves innervating the affected part of the body, using electrodes placed on the skin. For muscles that cannot be rescued via home- based functional electrical stimulation, an Italian study suggests that, at some point in the future, the following techniques may be applicable: they must first have induction and separation of autologous myogenic cells. This can be completed either by in vivo marcaine infiltration of muscle tissue that can then be grown in vitro, or have in vitro induction of autologous adipose tissue followed by selection of myogenic stem cells that can be recreated in vivo. The new autologous myogenic stem cells will be injected, proliferated and differentiated into new mature muscle fibers. Functional properties of these newly created muscle fibers will be induced via surface electrodes and an external neuromodulator.

Due to martial bravery being highly regarded as a virtue in ancient Greece, it was assumed that the armies were being led by \\"the best\\". This virtue was called (). Etymologically, as the word developed, it also produced a more political term: ' (). The term aristocracy is a compound word stemming from the singular of , (), and the Greek word for power, (). From the ancient Greeks, the term passed to the European Middle Ages for a similar hereditary class of military leaders, often referred to as the nobility. As in Greece, this was a class of privileged men and women whose familial connections to the regional armies allowed them to present themselves as the most \\"noble\\" or \\"best\\" of society.

Genus Pseudofusulus is monotypic genus (contains one species only) with Pseudofusulus varians as its type species. It is a relict species from Atlantic period of the Holocene, inhabiting exclusively nature beech and scree forests in Europe.  Distribution  The distribution of this species is Eastern Alpine and Western Carpathian. The type locality is the High Alps in Styria, Austria. The key area of its range is in the Western Alps (from the south-western part of the Alps to Croatia, and also to the Dolomites in the southern Tyrol). * Austria * Germany * Czech Republic – 7 confirmed sites in Ore Mountains in Bohemia, locally extinct in Moravia.

It is one of the most endangered species in the Czech Republic, restricted to hidden and undisturbed natural deciduous forests. Originally it was known from 16 sites in the Ore Mountains (Krušné Hory Mts.), in the northwestern Bohemia, Czech Republic and one site on the slope of Smrk Mount in the Moravian- Silesian Beskids (Moravskoslezské Beskydy Mts.), East Moravia, Czech Republic. ** extinct in Moravia: The forest at the only (but well populated) locality in the Moravia has been seriously damaged by air pollution from factories (such as Třinec Iron and Steel Works and others) jointly with the 20 °C dropping of temperatures in inversion on 31 December 1978. The nearly all pollution- damaged stand died out at the southwestern slope on the Smrk Mount. ** in Bohemia: The occurrence of the snail was recently confirmed only at seven sites in the Krušné Hory Mts. Remaining sites were destroyed due to human impacts, mainly acid rains and insensitive forest management mainly due to removal of dead wood and clearcutting. Therefore, its populations survived only in forest patches hidden in hardly accessible places. * Slovakia – in the eastern part of Low Tatras, in the peak level of Poľana, Klenovský Vepor Mount in the Vepor Mountains, Muránska planina and the Ondrejsko in Slovak Paradise is the easternmost. All of these records in the Slovakia are coming from 1960s-1970s and there has been no verification since. * Croatia * Italy * and others shells of Pseudofusulus varians  Description  The shell is horny or greenish brown and finely ribbed. The shell has 9-10 whorls. The apertural margin is detached. Columellaris is deep inside and forked, hardly visible in a perpendicular view. Palatal wall is white and prominent. There is no lunula. Subcolumellaris is very close to basal furrow, visible in an oblique view. Clausilium is not very concave. The width of the shell is 2.2–3 mm. The height of the shell is 9–12 mm.  Habitat  Pseudofusulus varians is very exacting on the quality of its environment and its populations are small and quite scattered in the whole of its range.

It is found in humid and shady habitats in woods, under ground litter and stones, in mountains. In the Czech Republic it is strictly associated with trees, restricted to undisturbed and hardly accessible natural beech forests. Pseudofusulus varians is strictly dendrophilous species, so the main threat is dead wood removing and clearcutting. As it is endangered in the whole Europe, it is very important to protect its modern sites.

He is the son of Lt. Cmdr. Allen Russell Burgham, DSC,MiD,CD. and Jean Wallace. He has lived in New Zealand and Scotland, but currently resides in Canada. He spent his formative years in Kingston, Ontario and graduated from Queen's Universityin 1972. While at Queen's he studied poetry and poetic process with Professor George Whalley, poet, writer and well-known Coleridge scholar. In 1973, Burgham moved to New Zealand where he taught at Wellington College (New Zealand). In 1975 he moved to Scotland to attend Edinburgh University, taking an M. Litt. degree in Blake studies. His thesis, written under the supervision of Professor Michael Phillips, focussed on William Blake's theory of imagination and the origins of Blake's poetry and theories. History Burgham, a member of Canada's The League of Canadian Poets, worked in Edinburgh with the publishing company Canongate Publishing as a book salesman and an editor. During his two years at Canongate, he assisted Stephanie Wolfe Murray and Charles Wyld in the development of their list of authors which included Iain Crichton Smith, Sorley MacLean, Andrew Greig, Lady Naomi Mitchison, Harry Horse, Robin Jenkins, Alasdair Gray and Alastair Reid. In 1980 Burgham became Publishing Manager of Macdonald Publishers of Loanhead. He worked with the publisher and literary icon, Callum Macdonald and founder of Lines Review. With Macdonald, Ian Burgham published the work of Robert Garioch, Iain Crichton Smith, Nigel Tranter, Alexander McCall Smith and others, and re-released out-of-print novels from authors such as Eric Linklater and John Buchan. In 1982 Burgham returned to Canada to pursue a career in general list, business and medical publishing. He co-founded the publishing company Grosvenor House Press and later became a partner in an international healthcare communications, medical education agency. Later after assisting Dr. Walter Rosser,OC in the formation of the Centre for Effective Practice within the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the University of Toronto Burgham began work as an adjunct assistant professor in the Centre for Studies in Primary Care at Queen's University. He resigned that position in 2012 to work with Dr Fred Tudiver in establishing the International Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, Canada. For a short time he helped to promote the Griffin Prize for Poetry to international markets. Burgham also collaborated with artist Uno Hoffmann in 2011. Up until 2012 Burgham volunteered as a director of the Rowers' Pub Reading Series, one of Ontario's foremost literary venues for readings by recognized writers and poets. The Reading Series has been in operation since 2008. Burgham has published six poetry collections; A Confession of Birds, The Stone Skippers (Tightrope Books), The Grammar of Distance (Tightrope Books), The Unquiet (Quattro Books), and Midnight (Quattro Books and MacLean Dubois of Edinburgh), the Sophia Poems (LyricalMyrical Press, Toronto). His poems continue to appear in literary journals and anthologies.

In 2012 he moved to Quattro Books of Toronto. His first collection under the Quattro Books imprint, FourPoints Editions The Unquiet was edited by A. F. Moritz and Allan Briesmaster and was published in November 2012. His second work under the imprint of Quattro Books, \\"Midnight\\" was published in 2015. In the summer of 2012 he read with Scottish poet Douglas Dunn OBE, at the Edinburgh Festival and with Todd Swift. A. F. Moritz, and Catherine Graham at Canada House in London, England. In 2015 Burgham was part of a poetry tour of the UK comprising Canadian poets Catherine Graham, Jeanette Lynes, Stephen Heighten along with Mike Garry of the UK) with readings in Manchester, London, Stratford-upon-Avon, Edinburgh and Glasgow in 2015. Plaudits In 2004 he won the Queen's University Well-versed Poetry Award. In that same year, with the support of two principals of MacLean Dubois, Charles MacLean and Alexander McCall Smith, a chapbook, \\"A Confession of Birds\\", was published in Edinburgh, Scotland. In 2007, Burgham's first full collection, \\"The Stone Skippers\\", (with an introduction by Australian poet Roland Leach) was published in the UK by MacLean Dubois, in Australia and New Zealand by SunLine Press and in Canada by Tightrope Books. These collections were followed by \\"The Grammar of Distance\\" in 2010 and \\"The Unquiet\\" in 2012. \\"The Stone Skippers\\" was nominated for the prestigious ReLit Awardin 2007.

Waboba is an international outdoor toy and sporting goods brand headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden with offices in Atlanta, Georgia and Guangzhou, China. Waboba is most known for its invention of balls that bounce on water, the high bouncing Moon ball, and the Wingman silicone flying disc. The company specializes in beach and backyard toys and games. The slogan used in advertising is Keep Life Fun. The name Waboba is a registered trademark and many of its products are internationally patented. Name Waboba is short for WAter BOuncing BAll, named after the companies first invention. History In Sweden in the early 1980s, inventor Jan Von Heland got the idea of creating something that skips on water after throwing a Frisbee upside down and noticing it skims the surface of water much like skipping a rock. Over the years, he began to test different shapes, materials, and compositions until he discovered in 2002 that a ball could bounce more efficiently than other balls on water if it was soft and had a Lycra covering which enables easy flow separation at the hydrodynamic stagnation point. In 2004, Jan created the commercial concept for balls that bounce on water, and eventually patented what has become the Waboba Ball. The ball is made of different types of polyurethane covered in Lycra, allowing it to bounce on water and float. Its patented design and durability gives Waboba its quality. To bounce the ball on the water, one must throw like skipping a rock. The ball bounces high on the water in between players when thrown at the right angle (overhand) with the right force. The ball does not bounce on land. To date, there are 10 different types of Waboba balls (Pro, Extreme, Surf, Blast, Zoobers, Big Kahuna, Tides, Sol, Zag, and Fetch for dogs). On April 1, 2016 Waboba was featured on The History Channels' Million Dollar Genius for Jan von Heland's invention of the ball that bounces on water. (Season 1, Episode 7 \\"Bigger is Better\\") Geographical spread The Waboba Water Bouncing Ball was first introduced in Sweden in 2005, where it was sold for two years before it was introduced to new markets in Europe, United States, and Australia in the summer of 2007. As of 2019, Waboba products are distributed in over 75 countries.

Awards * Special Needs Approved by AblePlay * Dr. Toy Best Toy for Vacation * Gold Award, Family Review Center * Moon Ball 2013 Toy of the Year Award winner by Creative Child Magazine Physics An elastic ball that bounces on water, the Waboba water ball flattens like a pancake when it hits the water surface, increasing its lift and propelling it upward. When it hits the water at a shallow angle, it too creates a bowl- shaped depression. But because it is soft, the ball flattens into a disc-shape when it hits the surface and this allows it to aquaplane efficiently across the surface. And the angle of the bowl-shaped depression causes it to launch into the air where the ball regains its shape, making it look as if it has bounced. The process is remarkably similar to the way stones skip across water, even though they are denser than the liquid. A shallow impact with the water surface creates a bowl-shaped depression that launches the stone into the air as it leaves. Naval use Researchers with the U.S. Navy's University Laboratory Initiative have been studying the mechanics and elasticity of the Waboba balls. The military branch is interested in how elasticity affects motion in water. All balls can bounce on water when thrown at a shallow angle with sufficient speed to hydroplane. This was the principle employed by WW2-period British inventor Barnes Wallace when he developed the \\"bouncing bomb\\" used in the famous \\"Dam Busters\\" raid against the Ruhr District dams. He had been inspired by the story of a technique historically used by the British navy that bounced spherical canon balls off the ocean surface to achieve accurate hits against enemy ships. Wallace worked out the physics by bouncing marbles, steel spheres, and various sizes and shapes of balls across a pond and then a long trough before progressing to larger-scale experiments. Even solid steel balls would bounce across water. Ordinary tennis balls or any other plastic balls can skip on water if thrown at a low angle at a fast speed.

Around 1830, after a deadly fever struck the community and killed 200, the remainder of the population moved away; no inhabitants remained by 1832. It was re-surveyed and re-founded in 1835. Economy After the abolition of slavery, sharecropping was the primary means of income for low income families in the area. Mostly for the cultivation of cotton, land would be used by sharecroppers in return for a share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines such as the cotton picker have made the manual cultivation obsolete over time as they took over the work from manual laborers. As of 2008, there were no industries in Fulton. Geography Fulton is at coordinates . The settlement is located on the banks of the Mississippi River, north of the mouth of the Hatchie River.

There has been some discussion regarding the origin of the crystals' colour, with some ascribing it to impurities in the compound, and others claiming it to be a property of the crystal itself. FAS is paramagnetic, acidic and toxic towards microorganisms. It is a weak oxidizing agent, capable of being reduced to Mohr's salt, ferrous ammonium sulfate. Preparation FAS can be prepared by crystallization from a solution of ferric sulfate and ammonium sulfate. Iron(II) in ferrous sulfate is oxidized to Iron(III) in ferric sulfate by addition of sulfuric and nitric acid. Upon addition of ammonium sulfate to the solution and damping in of the solution, ferric ammonium sulfate crystals will precipitate.

The CPFF was created on 27 October 2008 and funded a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that purchased three-month unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper (CP) from eligible issuers. This resulted in greater availability of credit for firms doing business. It worked under the aegis of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York where the NY Fed finances the purchase of highly rated unsecured and asset- backed commercial paper from eligible issuers via eligible primary dealers. The facility expired February 1, 2010. The final CP purchased matured on April 26, 2010. All CP notes purchased were repaid in full.  Explanation  The CPFF began operations on October 27, 2008 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers and government bailout of AIG and the global credit freeze that ensued. The CPFF method of short-term funding provided liquidity to U.S. issuers of commercial paper through an SPV, which bought unsecured and asset- backed commercial paper for three-month period from eligible issuers with funds made available by the NY Fed. The commercial paper remained in the custody of the SPV until the CP matured. On maturity, the proceeds from commercial paper and other assets were used to repay the loan that was originally taken from the NY Fed. All purchases of the Commercial Papers by the SPV was done through the New York Fed’s primary dealers. This program lent out a total $738 billion before it was closed. 45 out 81 of the companies participating in this program were foreign firms. Research shows that Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients were twice as likely to participate in the program than other commercial paper issuers who did not take advantage of the TARP bailout. The Fed incurred no losses from the CPFF.Wilson, Linus and Wu, Yan, Does Receiving TARP Funds Make it Easier to Roll Your Commercial Paper Onto the Fed? (August 22, 2011). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1911454 This program was created at the same time that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation implemented the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program to increase liquidity in inter-bank lending.  Eligibility  Only \\"Active\\" U.S. issuers of commercial paper (including those with a foreign parent), were eligible to sell commercial paper to the SPV. Active was defined as having at least three consecutive months of commercial paper outstanding during the period starting January 1, 2008 through August 31, 2008. The commercial paper had to be rated at least A-1/P-1/F1 by a major nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) and, if rated by multiple major NRSROs, must have been rated at least A-1/P-1/F1 by two or more major NRSROs. As part of the application process to be eligible for this program issuers had to pay a 10 basis point (0.1%) fee based on their maximum CP balance during the active period mentioned above.

The company was founded in 1965 by William Spielman.Cached company page The company was declared bankrupt on December 2, 2008. The property was put under the control of its major creditors, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase. Precursor Several months before the bankruptcy announcement, workers at the company's Goose Island warehouse had noticed that key pieces of equipment were being removed. The leaders of United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE) Local 1110, workers in the factory, contacted the national union, concerned that the plant was going to be closed. Despite company assurances that the missing machinery had merely been removed to make way for more modern equipment, the union began covertly monitoring the plant. One night, while monitoring the plant, UE Local 1110 President and Republic maintenance worker Armando Robles and UE union organizer Mark Meinster planned a strategy to occupy the factory in the event of a plant closing. Announced bankruptcy On December 3, 2008, the executives of the company announced to its workers that it would end operations on December 5 due to Bank of America, its main lender, canceling its line of credit due to a severe downturn in business at the plant. When the company's 260 employees learned that the plant was indeed closing permanently on December 2, 2008, they came to collect their paychecks. The company informed them that the employees would not be compensated for their accrued sick or vacation days and that their health insurance would be terminated on December 5. The union lodged a complaint that the company was acting in violation of the WARN Act, a federal law that requires companies to give workers 60 days' notice before mass layoffs. In total, the union claimed that the workers were owed US$1.5 million in vacation and severance pay, as well as an extension in their medical benefits. Echo Windows Public records show that shortly before the closure of Republic Windows the owners purchased Echo Windows and Doors, a non-unionized window factory in Red Oak, Iowa. The union at Republic Windows later filed charges against this action. Sitdown strike Beginning on the day of the closure, 200 of the 240 workers of the Goose Island factory began an organized sitdown strike to protest alleged violation of federal labor law by Republic in that the company did not give the workers 60 days notice prior to the announcement of closure (this, however, was allegedly based upon the lack of lending from Bank of America). The sit-in lasted until the workers reached a settlement with the factory over severance, vacation time, and temporary health care benefits; the settlement, which was reached on December 11 and amounted to over $1.75 million,Chicago workers approve $1.75 million settlement, end sit-in at shuttered factory was negotiated by the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (of whose Local 1110 branch the workers were members), Republic owners and Bank of America over three days. On December 10, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase agreed to create a $1.75 million fund to pay the workers their back pay and benefits and to provide two months of health insurance coverage. On December 15, 2008, the company filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.Chicago 'sit-in' factory files for bankruptcy Change of ownership In February 2009, Serious Materials, a Sunnyvale, California-based company that produces environmentally friendly building materials, announced that it had purchased the buildings and assets of Republic Windows. The company announced that it intended to hire back all of the former factory workers.Huffingtonpost.com This deal would have to be approved by the Republic Windows creditors and the bankruptcy court. Criminal charges In September 2009, Cook County prosecutors charged that the sudden plant closing in December 2008 was part of a plot by CEO Richard Gillman, the head of Republic Windows. The prosecutors said that Gillman and two other undisclosed executives secretly trucked 10 semitrailers full of window manufacturing equipment from the plant, moving three trailers of equipment to Red Oak, Iowa. On January 1, 2009, Gillman took over a Red Oak window company that had been operating since 1985. But in February 2009 that company closed as well, laying off 120 employees. In December 2013, Gillman was sentenced to four years in prison for stealing $500,000 from Republic Windows and Doors.\\"Former CEO get 4 years for theft\\" Chicago Tribune 8 Dec 2013 section 1 p 14 Book Kari Lydersen's blog on the sit-in was expanded into a book titled Revolt on Goose Island.Reporter's blog on Chicago sit-in to become bookRepublic Sit-In to be Detailed in Book The book was released in June 2009. 2012 occupation On February 23, 2012, about 65 workers initiated a second sit-in strike of Serious Materials (formerly Republic Windows and Doors). The occupation was in response to factory owners Serious Energy's announcement that it would be closing the factory and consolidating operations in Colorado and Pennsylvania. Workers ended the occupation at approximately 2 AM on February 24, 2012, after owners agreed to keep the factory open for 90 days.

Peterman became the third Democrat to be appointed by Governor Christ to lead a state agency when he was appointed on February 8, 2008 to head the Department of Juvenile Justice. Due to term limits, he would have been ineligible to run again for the House. He replaced Walter A. McNeil, who had been appointed Secretary of the Department of Corrections. Peterman said it was important to seek rehabilitation of youthful offenders and to avoid their incarceration. His prior experience with Juvenile Services Program Inc served him in preparing for the position, as did his service on the House Juvenile Justice Committee. In 2005, he sponsored a bill to create the Council on the Social Status of African-American Men and Boys. He said he would accomplish his goals by such measures as authorizing local review boards and councils to redirect first-time offenders to community-based punishments.

In 2009, Peterman came under fire for using state tax dollars to travel to and from his home in St. Petersburg and not being in his office in Tallahassee on a routine basis. After an independent investigation by the governor's office, he was later ordered to pay back more than $25,000 of $44,000 to the state. Critics said he should have been fired, as he conducted the personal travel with intent. Under more pressure later, in 2010, he gave up his state vehicle that he had used for personal travel. In 2009, a complaint was filed on the same matter to the Florida Commission on Ethics, alleging Peterman violated the state law under the provisions of \\"misuse of public position\\". In 2010, the Ethics Commission found probable cause to investigate. Peterman remains adamant that his commitment to his ministry and family were top priority and led to his split time between the cities as he did not wish to uproot his wife and children. Peterman is currently the founder and CEO of Peterman Global, LLC, a business and political consultation company. He continues to pastor at the Rock of Jesus Missionary Baptist Church and has recently re-entered politics, running for the Pinellas County Commission, District 7.

Yuria Type 100 is his newest creation: she has highly advanced artificial intelligence and vast sexual knowledge, and the first doll which can imprint to her master for life upon having actual sex. However, she refuses to imprint onto Akiba, and escapes from his lab. She ends up living with college student Shunsuke Kubo, where she tries to seduce him with the hopes that he can be her master, as however, he regularly refuses because he has a girlfriend and because he sees her as incredibly annoying when she acts like that. The series follows her everyday life as she tries to seduce Shunsuke. Other Dutch wife gynoids soon appear, some of whom were also invented by Akiba, thus making them Yuria's sisters, and others from competing companies. Throughout the series, there are commentaries about the technical specs of the sexual capabilities of the Yuria and other models. CharactersMain characters= * Yuria is a female android designed with the sole purpose of being a highly interactive sex doll. Not wanting to engage in sex with her inventor, she escapes and meets Kubo Shunsuke, who gives her a place to stay. She finds herself strongly attracted to him but struggles with her programming that tells her just to please him sexually whenever she can. * ' is a college student who takes in Yuria, thinking she is a runaway. He treats her like a little sister despite the latter's strange physical advances on him, which he retaliates with different grappling holds from his hobby of pro wrestling to keep her at bay. =Supporting characters=Humans *' is the creator of the Yuria series sex dolls, that have the habit of escaping from him once completed. *' is introduced as Shunsuke's fiancée. She is the proud daughter of a wealthy family from Shunsuke's home town, and often expresses jealous feelings.

It provides mostly small-scale basic infrastructure (roads, water supply, sanitation, health centers, hospitals, schools etc.) and other services such as micro- enterprise credit, nutrition and female literacy programs for the benefit of the poor, while creating employment and promoting the local private sector. The term is also used to describe similar agencies created based on the model of the first AGETIP in Senegal. AGETIP  History  AGETIP in Senegal was created in 1989 during an economic crisis by the Senegalese government with the support of donors, in particular the World Bank. It is not a public entity, but a private non-profit entity (Association à but non lucratif) that is financed entirely by fees for the services it provides, without receiving government or donor funds to cover its administrative expenses. Its general- director is appointed by a Board that includes both government and non- government representatives. AGETIP Senegal does not carry out works itself, but contracts them out (delegated contract management). According to the World Bank, \\"AGETIP has acquired a virtual monopoly in construction management\\" in Senegal. World Bank Operations Evaluation Department:Performance audit report: “Senegal—AGETIP: Public Works and Employment Projects,” by Robert van der Lugt and Thomas Kuby AGETIP typically works closely with municipalities, which submit proposals and must provide counterpart funds. The agency initially worked only in urban areas, subsequently broadening its activities to rural areas. The AGETIP's quality control procedures have been certified by the Bureau Veritas Certification. The donors that carry out or have carried out development projects through the AGETIP Senegal are the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the European Union, the French Development Agency, the ILO, UNICEF, KfW of Germany and the Canadian International Development Agency, among others. An evaluation by the World Bank's evaluation department carried out in 1996 praised AGETIP as a \\"development success and a model of efficient and effective public works management\\" with \\"transparent, streamlined procedures\\", crediting it for \\"significantly improving the management of donor finances\\". Accounts are paid in an average of three days and about 90 percent of contracts awarded by AGETIP are completed within the specified time. However, the evaluation also states that \\"grassroots participation by local communities will have to increase if benefits are to last over the long term\\" and that surveyed beneficiaries said they felt left out of the identification and planning process.  Related agencies  By 2008 the AGETIP model has been replicated in 17 other African countries using different names: *NIGETIP-Niger *GAMWORKS-Gambia *FASO BAARA-Burkina Faso *ASSETIP-Rwanda *AMEXTIPE-Mauritania *AGETUR/AGETIP -Benin *AGETUR-Togo *AGETIPE CAF- Central African Republic *AGETIPE-Guinea *AGETIPE-Mali *AGETIPA- Madagascar *AGETIER-Mali *AGEOPPE-Guinea Bissau *AGECABO-Cap Verde *ADU- Mauritania *ADETIP-Djibouti *ABUTIP-Burundi The AGETIP model is similar to a Social fund, a term more commonly used for a similar type of institution in developing countries in Latin America and African countries outside West Africa.

The shell of this species is left-handed in coiling and it looks like a juvenile of a clausiliid. Balea perversa (as its synonymous name Pupa fragilis) is the type species of the genus Balea.

The color is pale brownish and the surface is often silky shiny. The shell often has distinct riblets. The apical whorls are cylindrical. The shell has 8-9 whorls and (unlike many clausiliids) the last whorl has the largest diameter. It is densely ribbed. The cervix is almost without keel. Apart from a rudimentary parietal fold, there are no folds in the aperture. This species has no clausilium. The width of the shell is 2.5–2.7 mm; the height of the shell is 7–10 mm. Balea perversa differs from Balea heydeni in that it is a less slender and brownish rather than yellowish shell; the first whorl increases in diameter less rapidly, and the sculpture is more prominently striated (with what are usually distinct riblets rather than coarse growth lines). { Apertural view. Lateral view. }  Ecology  Balea perversa lives on mosses and at the bark of trees, also near roads, at walls and rocky slopes, at rocks, less commonly in ground litter. It lives often on surfaces encrusted with lichens and other epiphytes. It prefers trees with rough bark. It prefers shady habitats in Portugal. It may tolerate non-calcareous soils. In Bulgaria it lives up to 1,600 m or perhaps to 2,400 m; in Switzerland up to 2,000 m. It is easily dispersed by birds. It feeds on mosses, algae, lichens, and cyanobacteria. It is ovoviviparous, self-fertilization predominates, even in laboratories when snails are kept in pairs. Animals can reach maturity after 3–4 months under favourable conditions, one adult can give birth to 10-20 juveniles per year. Animals can also be active in mild winters. It is locally threatened by too thorough and too frequent restorations of old buildings, acid rains, air pollution and cutting of old trees. It has largely disappeared from inside cities. Remains frequent in Ireland, but many colonies in lowland England have certainly disappeared, extinct around London since the 1920s.

Varadharajan's sister Priya (Sindhu Tolani) falls for Kaalaiyan when he wins a Jallikattu. In the meantime, Bhuvana (Sneha) is running from Varadharajan as he falls for her charm and tries to molest her. She takes refuge in Kaalaiyan's house. However, Varadharajan decides to marry Priya to Kaalaiyan, with an eye on his land. On the day of the marriage, when Kaalaiyan comes to know that the bride wants to split the bond between the brothers, he calls off the marriage. Kaalaiyan takes a liking for Bhuvana and the inevitable happens – romance blossoms. What follows is predictable, but there comes a surprise in the form of Saroja in the climax. Cast * Sundar C. as Kaalaiyan * Sneha as Bhuvana * Sindhu Tolani as Priya * Suman as Varadharajan * Vivek as Saroja / Saami * Meenal as Saroja's maid * Periya Karuppu Thevar as Saroja's grandfather * Stunt Silva as Suruli *Cell Murugan as Veterinarian * Devan * Vichu Vishwanath * Lollu Sabha Jeeva as Kaalaiyan's brother Production In September 2008, it was revealed that Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi's grandson Gunanidhi was set to produce a remake of AVM Productions's 1980 film, Murattu Kaalai. Sundar C was roped in to play the lead role, while Suman would play the villain role done by Jayashankar, and Suruli Rajan's comedy will be taken over by Vivek, in the venture to be directed by Selva Bharathy. The team initially hoped to begin production in December 2008 and released the film on 14 April 2009. Sneha was soon after assigned to play the lead female role, while Samiksha was also selected to play another leading role. However during the first schedule in Pollachi, Samiksha was replaced by Sindhu Tolani for unknown reasons and the team subsequently completed two full schedules by January 2009. However Ayngaran International's financial crisis meant that Murattu Kaalai along with their other productions became stuck. The film re-emerged when Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M. Karunanidhi launched the audio of the film on 18 September 2010, which was received by actor Vikram and the film was expected to be released by 12 November 2010, but eventually did not. The film subsequently remained completed by unreleased due to Ayngaran International's financial problems which had also stopped the release of other films such as Arjunan Kadhali and Kalavadiya Pozhudugal. The film finally was promoted and released by the production house on 15 June 2012. Soundtrack Music was scored by Srikanth Deva and released on Ayngaran. Podhuvaga En Manasu Thangam was reused and remixed from the 1980 film. Critical reception The film received mixed to negative reviews. Times of India rated the movie 3/5 stating that, \\"Still, the good news here is that, surprisingly, 'Murattu Kaalai' isn't a disaster and works to an extent. But the bad news is that this is an entirely pointless remake with hardly anything new to offer\\". Anupama Subramanian of \\"Deccan Chronicle\\" rated the movie 2.5/5 praising Vivek's and Sundar.C's performances and stated that the movie is \\"Watchable Once\\". Rohit Ramachandran of Nowrunning.com rated it 1/5 calling the film \\"sickening.\\" Sify rated the movie as \\"Below Average\\" praising Santonio Terzio's work. Vivek Ramz of in.com rated Murattu Kaalai 2/5 calling it \\"a poor remake\\" and added that it's an example of how not to remake an old blockbuster. Camera work of Santonio Terzio was appreciated overall.

Oatmeal is an unincorporated community in Burnet County, Texas, United States. It is situated along RM 243, approximately eight miles southeast of Burnet and northwest of Austin. History Twisted Ranch in Oatmeal (2014) The area's first settlers were German families during the late 1840s. The community's name is either an alteration of a Mr. Othneil – the area's first gristmill owner, or a supposed translation of the name Habermill (Haber being a German dialect word for Hafer, \\"oats\\"). A post office was established in 1853 under the name Oatmeal. The first schoolhouse opened in 1858, only to be replaced by a second building eleven years later. A gin built in the 1870s continued to serve as a local landmark into the early 1900s. A cemetery was deeded in 1871, although burials were recorded in the area as early as 1854. In 1936, Oatmeal had a school, two churches, and scattered dwellings. By 1990, the population was around twenty – consisting mostly of families engaged in farming and ranching. That figure remained the same in 2000. =Stringtown= Following the Civil War, a colony of freedmen, freed slaves, settled in the eastern part of Oatmeal. The settlement, known as Stringtown, included homes, a building used as a church and school, and Burnet County's only all-black cemetery. The community of Stringtown remained in existence until the early 1920s. Culture Oatmeal's watertower is painted to resemble a box of oatmeal. Since 1978, the community of Oatmeal and the nearby city of Bertram have celebrated an annual Oatmeal Festival, originally a parody of chili cookoffs. Ken Odiorne, a local resident, started the tradition by writing to the major producers of oatmeal at the time to ask for assistance. Only one company, National Oats, responded. The Oatmeal Festival has played a significant role in the continued notoriety and existence of Oatmeal, Burnet County's second oldest community. Climate The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Oatmeal has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated \\"Cfa\\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for Oatmeal, Texas ReferencesExternal links * * Category:Unincorporated communities in Burnet County, Texas Category:Unincorporated communities in Texas Category:Populated places established in 1853 ","title":"Oatmeal, Texas"},{"id":"20751373","text":"The Bangladesh Journal of Pharmacology is a quarterly peer-reviewed scientific journal published by the Bangladesh Pharmacological Society.

It was first observed by Sergey Blazhko in 1907 in the star RW Draconis. The physics behind the Blazhko effect is currently still a matter of debate, with there being three primary hypotheses. In the first, referred to as the resonance model, the cause of the modulation is a non-linear resonance among either the fundamental or the first overtone pulsation mode of the star and a higher mode. The second, known as the magnetic model, assumes the variation to be caused by the magnetic field being inclined to the rotational axis, deforming the main radial mode. The magnetic model was ruled out in 2004 by high resolution spectro-polarimetric observations. The third model assumes that cycles in the convection cause the alternations and the modulations. Observational evidence based on Kepler observations indicates much of the Blazhko effect's two-cycle light curve modulation is due to simple period- doubling. Many RR Lyrae stars have a variability period of approximately 12 hours and ground-based astronomers typically make nightly observations about 24 hours apart; thus period-doubling results in brightness maximums during nightly observations that are significantly different than the daytime maximum.

But Kutty instead tells her that it is not an issue to him and tells her to continue loving Arjun and he would never stop loving her. Arjun is irritated by the acting of Kutty. He fights with him in order to bully him into stopping but instead was challenged by Kutty, that if Arjun is confident in his love no one would separate Geetha from him & may the best man win. Arjun finds no option but to accept in order to prove his confidence in his love (else accept that his love is weak). While Kutty pulls all kind of stunts to impress Geetha (including winning a rigged race in order to protect Geetha's chastity from Arjun) but fails to make her Arjun introduces Geetha to his father (Radha Ravi) expecting him to approve & bless their marriage but his father, seeing to further his political ambitions, engages a Minister's daughter (who is shown to be a spoilt girl of questionable character), for Arjun. So Arjun escapes with Geetha who is helped by Kutty. Kutty, Arjun, Geetha are chased by Arjun's father's men but are unable to catch them. Meanwhile, old wounds renew between Kutty and Arjun. After an intense (kung-fu) fight with the henchmen (where Arjun runs & Kutty fights), Arjun leaves Geetha with Kutty without saying anything to either of them. Kutty takes care of Geetha, which touches her. She soon realizes the love he has for her and regrets not having met him before her commitment to Arjun. She tries telling the same to him, but Kutty thinking that Geetha is scolding him closes his ears and does not hear what she actually said to him (he does that a couple of times in the movie). Arjun arrives at the scene with his father in tow, now all happy for their marriage. Geetha leaves with Arjun to marry him. On the wedding day of Arjun & Geetha, Kutty wanders here and there to look after wedding related works. His friends understand his internal pain and slaps him begging him to cry at least now. While Geetha is on her way to the ceremony, Kutty stops her and openly expresses his pain of his love and how he is going to miss her and asks if his love did touch her at least once, without knowing that his love touched her already. (He then laughs & passes it off as a prank). Geetha stares speechless with helplessness. Kutty's friends the little kids present Geetha a gift (from Kutty) in which she finds her lost anklet and the poem page where she wrote a reply while she was in Kanyakumari. Kutty was the person who jumped into the sea to take her anklet and was assumed dead, by Geetha. Geetha finally realizes her love for Kutty, rejects her marriage with Arjun and goes to Kutty and accepts his love finally by hugging him.

Production In January 2008, Gemini Film Circuits bought the remake rights of the Telugu film Arya featuring Allu Arjun and claimed to be ready to produce a film with Dhanush and Shriya Saran in the lead role, with Balasekaran being named as a director.http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/36261.html However the film remained inactive for nearly a year until following the success of Yaaradi Nee Mohini, Mithran Jawahar was signed up to replace Balasekaran. The film was launched and titled Kadhir, but eventually went through a change of name to become Kutty. The film, launched in December 2008 and shooting proceeded in a number of schedules with filming taking place in Chennai, Vishakhapatnam and Kodaikanal. During the production of the film, it was acquired to be distributed by Sun Pictures, however the deal late fell throughhttp://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/44753.html but the film eventually released during the Pongal festival on 14 January 2010. Soundtrack The soundtrack consisted primarily of recycled tunes from the original Telugu film by music director Devi Sri Prasad. The film's soundtrack was released 23 December 2009. People who were present at the small function were A. Jawahar, Devi Sri Prasad and the producers . ReleaseCritical reception= Upon release, the film generally received mixed reviews. A reviewer from Rediff gave the film 2.5 out of 5, claiming that the film is a \\"fun ride\\" and despite seeming to be the \\"same old story\\" with a \\"predictable end\\", he adds, \\"you're glued to the screen because of the intriguing plot twists\\". Sify describes the film as a \\"clean entertainer\\", citing that the film works \\"as it is a clean, honest, romantic musical that's worth a matinee for the family audiences\\", though it isn't \\"without hiccups\\" as it \\"lacks comedy\\" and could have needed some editing works in the second half.http://sify.com/movies/tamil/review.php?id=14927510&ctid;=5&cid;=2429 Similarly a reviewer from Times of India also described the film as a \\"clean entertainer\\" and praised director Jawahar, citing that he \\"deserves a round of applause\\", while criticizing the narration that \\"appears like a lecture students term as 'blade'\\" and the climax that \\"has happened in only a 1000 other movies\\". Behindwoods gave the film 2 out of 5 and cites that the film is \\"definitely different from the regular commercial\\" and that \\"the director has tried hard to make a feel good romantic flick and has partially succeeded\\". =Box office= The film opened in Malaysia at eleventh place in the box office.

Set Splitting is one of Garey&Johnson;'s classical NP- complete problems.  Variants  The optimization version of this problem is called Max Set Splitting and requires finding the partition which maximizes the number of split elements of F. It is an APX-complete problem and hence in NPO. The Set k-Splitting problem is stated as follows: given S, F, and an integer k, does there exist a partition of S which splits at least k subsets of F? The original formulation is the restricted case with k equal to the cardinality of F. The Set k-Splitting is fixed-parameter tractable, i.e., if k taken to be a fixed parameter, rather than a part of the input, then a polynomial algorithm exists for any fixed k. Dehne, Fellows and Rosamond presented an algorithm that solves it in time O(f(k) n^c) for some function f and constant c. When each element of F is restricted to be of cardinality exactly k, the decision variant is called Ek-Set Splitting and the optimization version Max Ek-Set Splitting. For k > 2 the former remains NP complete, and for k ≥ 2 the latter remains APX complete. For k ≥ 4, Ek-Set Splitting is approximation resistant. That is, unless P=NP, there is no polynomial-time (factor) approximation algorithm which does essentially better than a random partition. The Weighted Set Splitting is a variant in which the subsets in F have weights and the objective is to maximize the total weight of the split subsets.  Connection to other problems  Set Splitting is special case of the Not-All-Equal Satisfiability problem without negated variables. Additionally, Ek-Set Splitting equals non-monochromatic graph coloring of k-uniform hypergraphs. For k=2, the optimization variant reduces to the well- known Maximum cut.

The Counts Palatine from this line initially ruled over only a relatively unimportant territory, namely the Palatine share of the Rear County of Sponheim; however, their importance steadily grew. All living members of the House of Wittelsbach descend from Palatinate-Birkenfeld, which thus became the parent branch of the Kings of Bavaria.  History  Birkenfeld Castle 1645 The patriarch of the line was Charles I, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken- Birkenfeld. He was a son of Duke Wolfgang of Zweibrücken, who when he died in 1569, bequeathed the Palatine share of the Rear County of Sponheim to his son Karl. The latter chose Birkenfeld as his residence and in 1595, through the Treaty of Kastellaun with his joint ruler the Margrave of Baden, Edward Fortunatus, secured exclusive rule in the districts of Birkenfeld and Allenbach (until 1671). Under him, Birkenfeld Castle underwent major expansion. Following Karl's death in 1600, he was succeeded by Georg Wilhelm, who ruled until 1669. He was succeeded by Karl Otto, who however died in 1671. The inheritance passed to Christian II, a son of Georg Wilhelm's younger brother, who had previously received the Lordship of Bischweiler from the holdings of Zweibrücken and thus founded the Palatinate-Birkenfeld-Bischweiler line. His son Christian III ended official residency at Birkenfeld in 1717 and resided primarily in Bischweiler, alternating with Zweibrücken after 1734, in which year he succeeded to the Duchy of Zweibrücken. He was succeeded by his son Christian IV, who however was married below his station, to the dancer Marianne Camasse, so that his sons were not entitled to inherit. After Christian's death his nephew Karl III August Christian became ruler. Under his rule, the Rear County of Sponheim was finally partitioned. It was agreed that of the two joint rulers, the Margrave of Baden was to make the division and then the Count Palatine by Rhine was to choose his share. Possibly the hope on the Baden side was that Karl III August would decide on the portion in which Birkenfeld and the family seat were located; nonetheless, Karl III August decided upon the Mosel region around Trarbach, so that after 1776 the Birkenfeld region became the exclusive possession of Baden. His brother Maximilian I Joseph succeeded him after his death in 1795. As a result of the wars of succession of the French Revolution he was the last Duke of Zweibrücken, becoming in 1799 Palatine and Bavarian Elector and in 1806 the first King of Bavaria. Prior to this, in 1645, John Charles, a younger brother of Christian II, had founded the collateral line of Palatinate-Birkenfeld- Gelnhausen. From 1799 on, his descendants were styled \\"His Royal Highness Duke in Bavaria\\".

Education and early career  Sánchez-Albornoz was born in Madrid to a prominent political family from the provincial capital of Ávila and attended the Central University of Madrid, where he obtained a licentiate degree in letters and philosophy in 1913 with first class honours. One year later, at age 21, he was awarded a doctorate degree in history with a thesis entitled \\"La Monarquía en Asturias, León y Castilla durante los siglos VIII al XIII. La Potestad Real y los Señoríos\\". He quickly established himself as the country's preeminent young scholar of medieval Spanish history, particularly the history of the monarchy and royal institutions in the early Middle Ages. By 1920, Sánchez-Albornoz had already held several prestigious university chairs when he was offered the chair in Spanish medieval history at Madrid held by his late thesis adviser, Eduardo de Hinojosa. In 1926, he was inducted into the Real Academia de la Historia—the youngest member up to that time ever admitted to the elite scholarly institution. By 1931, he was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters and served as rector of the Central University the following year. During this time, he took a hiatus from his academic pursuits to join the newly established republican government, serving in parliament as a representative from Ávila, and later in several other prominent posts, including Minister of Education.  Exile and later career  During the early years of the Spanish Civil War, Sánchez-Albornoz was appointed the Spanish Republic ambassador to Portugal. When the government in Lisbon declared its support for Francisco Franco, he was dismissed from his post and he fled with his family to France and then, in 1940, to Argentina, where he would spend more than four decades in exile as both a scholar and leader of the democratic anti-Franco movement abroad. After a brief post at the University of Cuyo in the northern province of Mendoza, Sánchez-Albornoz was offered a position at the University of Buenos Aires where he created a center for Iberian medieval studies and founded a historical journal, the Cuadernos de historia de España. During these years, he remained a tremendously productive scholar, writing extensively on early Spanish history and training young Argentine and other Latin American scholars to work on medieval documents and legal texts. For Sánchez-Albornoz, the work of recovering the roots of the Spanish character and its political institutions in the Middle Ages was an extension of his political commitments to the republican Spanish state he had been a part of in the 1930s. Between 1962 and 1970, Sánchez-Albornoz served as president of the council of the Spanish Republican Government in Exile and used his reputation and numerous invitations to speak abroad as a platform to promote the restoration of democracy in Spain. Even when Franco extended an amnesty to regime critics in 1969, Sánchez-Albornoz refused to return until the dictator had died. Sánchez- Albornoz's scholarship came to focus on the kingdoms of Castile and León and the evolution of social and economic institutions under the influence of external pressures, whether Germanic (Visigothic) or Muslim/Arab. In his monumental, three-volume history of early feudalism that he had begun composing in France before the outbreak of war, En torno a los origines del feudalismo (1942), Sánchez-Albornoz emphasized the contributions of Visigothic culture and legal institutions to early Spanish history, particularly the monarchy and its relationship to the nobility and other segments of society. He also emphasized the emergence in Spain of a free peasantry in advancing the frontier regions during the Reconquista that complicated the development of serfdom and hierarchical structures of lordship historians described elsewhere in feudal Europe. While an earlier generation of scholars had also tended to focus on questions about the continuity of Roman influences in medieval Iberia, Sánchez-Albornoz instead argued that the Visigothic invasions of the fifth century had created a new, uniquely Hispanic, civilization which defined Spanish history and the Spanish people from that point forward, even during the centuries of Arab occupation.  Dispute with Américo Castro  This conviction about the origins of a unique Spanish national identity led to a notable academic feud with another scholar in exile, Américo Castro, who had moved to the United States and taught at Princeton University. Castro's ground-breaking book, España en su historia (1948; Engl. trans. 1954) posited that \\"Spanish\\" culture was essentially a hybrid one, produced over the course of centuries by the intermixing of Christian, Muslim and Jewish populations and traditions. Castro coined the term \\"convivencia\\"—loosely translated as \\"living-together-ness\\" or \\"cohabitation\\"—to describe the multicultural, religiously tolerant and dynamic society of medieval Spain. Sánchez- Albornoz—who regarded Castro's interdisciplinary, literature-focused methodology as insufficiently rigorous and scholarly—responded with a new study, España: un enigma histórico (1956), that argued for the persistence of a pre-Arab-invasion Spanish culture and national identity grounded in the reproduction of key legal, political, and economic institutions. While he did not deny that Muslims and Jews were an important presence in medieval Iberia, Sánchez-Albornoz maintained that they contributed little creative energy to the processes of history or state-building and insisted upon an enduring idea of Spanish nationhood and identity that transcended the vagaries of history and the temporary influence of outside groups. While few academic historians today still subscribe to Sanchez-Albornoz's ideas about an essential national Spanish \\"character\\" which motivates history, there is still a lively scholarly debate over convivencia as a historical model for understanding medieval Spain.See for example the collection of articles in Convivencia: Jews, Muslims, and Christians in Medieval Spain, ed. Vivian B. Mann, Thomas F. Glick, Jerrilynn Denise Dodds (New York: G. Braziller, 1992)  Return to Spain  In April 1976, six months after the death of Franco, Sánchez-Albornoz returned to his homeland for the first time in more than forty years and was given a hero's welcome, particularly in his family town of Ávila. On 2 March 1983 he received the Gran Cruz de la Real y Muy Distinguida Orden de Carlos III. He returned to Buenos Aires after a brief stay, but moved back to Ávila permanently in July 1983. He died one year later, on 8 July 1984 at the age of 91 at Hospital de la Seguridad Social Nuestra Señora de Sonsoles in Ávila, and was buried in the Cathedral of Ávila. A month before he received the Premio Príncipe de Asturias de Comunicación y Humanidades. The Fundación D. Claudio Sánchez-Albornoz in Ávila was established shortly after his death to preserve and promote his scholarly legacy. During his long and distinguished career, Sánchez-Albornoz received dozens of awards and honorary degrees from institutions and nations around the world and was a member, or corresponding member, of numerous scholarly academies. Sánchez-Albornoz was survived by two daughters, and a son, Nicolás (born 1926), who went on to become a noted scholar of Latin American demographic history, author of La población de América Latina (1973, trans 1974, frequently republished).:es:Nicolás Sánchez- Albornoz  Notes  References  * José Luis Gómez Martínez, \\"Américo Castro y Sánchez-Albornoz: Dos posiciones ante el origen de los españoles.\\" Nueva Revista de Filología Hispánica 2l (l972): 30l-320. * James F.

It is characterized by a negative-going wave that peaks around 200 milliseconds or less after the onset of a stimulus, and most often occurs in response to linguistic stimuli that violate word-category or phrase structure rules (as in *the in room instead of in the room). As such, it is frequently a topic of study in neurolinguistics experiments, specifically in areas such as sentence processing. While it is frequently used in language research, there is no evidence yet that it is necessarily a language-specific phenomenon. More recent work has criticized the design of many of the foundational studies that characterized the ELAN, such that apparent ELAN effects might be the result of spillover from words prior to the onset of the critical word. This raises important questions about whether the ELAN is a true ERP component or an artifact of certain experimental designs.Osterhout, L., McLaughlin, J., Kim, A., Greewald, R., & Inoue, K. (2004). Sentences in the brain: Event-related potentials as real-time reflections of sentence comprehension and language learning. In M. Carreiras & C. Clifton (Eds.), The on-line study of sentence comprehension: Eyetracking-ERPs, and beyond (pp. 271–308). New York: Psychology Press. Characteristics The ELAN was first reported by Angela D. Friederici as a response to German sentences with phrase structure violations, such as *the pizza was in the eaten (as opposed to the pizza was eaten); it can be elicited by English phrase structure violations such as *Max's of proof (as opposed to Max's proof) or *your write (as opposed to you write). The ELAN is not elicited by sentences with other kinds of grammatical errors, such as subject-verb disagreement (*\\"he go to the store\\" rather than \\"he goes to the store\\") or grammatically dispreferred and \\"awkward\\" sentences (such as \\"the doctor charged the patient was lying\\" rather than \\"the doctor charged that the patient was lying\\"); it only appears when it is impossible to build local phrase structure. It appears rapidly, peaking between 100 and 300 milliseconds after the onset of the grammatically incorrect stimulus (other reports have placed its time course, or latency, between 100 and 200ms, \\"under 200ms\\", \\"around 125 ms\\", or \\"about 160ms\\"). The speed of the ELAN may also be affected by characteristic of the violating stimuli; the ELAN appears later to visual stimuli that are fuzzy or difficult to see, and may occur earlier in morphologically complex spoken words where much information about the meaning of the word precedes the word's recognition point. Its name derives from the fact that it is picked up most robustly by EEG sensors on the left front regions of the scalp; it may sometimes, however, have a bilateral (both sides of the scalp) distribution. Some authors consider the ELAN to be a separate response from the left anterior negativity (LAN), while others label it as just an early version of the LAN. The ELAN has been reported in languages such as English, German, Dutch, Chinese, and Japanese. It is possible, though, that it is not a response specific to language (in other words, that the ELAN might also occur in response to non-linguistic stimuli). Use in neurolinguistics The ELAN response has played an important role in studies of sentence processing, particularly in the development of the so-called \\"serial model\\" or \\"syntax-first model\\" of sentence processing. According to this model, the brain's first step in processing sentences is to organize input and build local phrase structure (for example, to take the words the and pizza and organize them into a noun phrase the pizza), and it does not process semantic information or meaning until after this step has succeeded. This model predicts that if the initial building of local phrase structure fails (as in the above examples *Max's of proof and *your write) then semantic processing (the brain's interpretation of the meaning of the sentence) does not go forward. This has been tested by taking advantage of two brain responses: the ELAN, which reflects the phrase-structure-building, and the N400, which reflects semantic processing; the model predicts that sentences eliciting an ELAN (a violation of local phrase structure) will not elicit an N400, since the building of phrase structure is a prerequisite for semantic processing. These types of studies have had subjects read or listen to sentences that have both a syntactic and semantic violation in the same place. Some such studies have found such sentences to elicit an ELAN and no N400, thus supporting the claim of the \\"serial model\\", while others have found both an ELAN and an N400, challenging the model.

Cliques of size one are shown as small red disks; cliques of size two are shown as black line segments; cliques of size three are shown as light blue triangles; and cliques of size four are shown as dark blue tetrahedra. Clique complexes, flag complexes, and conformal hypergraphs are closely related mathematical objects in graph theory and geometric topology that each describe the cliques (complete subgraphs) of an undirected graph. The clique complex X(G) of an undirected graph G is an abstract simplicial complex (that is, a family of finite sets closed under the operation of taking subsets), formed by the sets of vertices in the cliques of G. Any subset of a clique is itself a clique, so this family of sets meets the requirement of an abstract simplicial complex that every subset of a set in the family should also be in the family. The clique complex can also be viewed as a topological space in which each clique of k vertices is represented by a simplex of dimension k − 1\\\\. The 1-skeleton of X(G) (also known as the underlying graph of the complex) is an undirected graph with a vertex for every 1-element set in the family and an edge for every 2-element set in the family; it is isomorphic to G.. Clique complexes are also known as Whitney complexes, after Hassler Whitney. A Whitney triangulation or clean triangulation of a two-dimensional manifold is an embedding of a graph G onto the manifold in such a way that every face is a triangle and every triangle is a face. If a graph G has a Whitney triangulation, it must form a cell complex that is isomorphic to the Whitney complex of G. In this case, the complex (viewed as a topological space) is homeomorphic to the underlying manifold. A graph G has a 2-manifold clique complex, and can be embedded as a Whitney triangulation, if and only if G is locally cyclic; this means that, for every vertex v in the graph, the induced subgraph formed by the neighbors of v forms a single cycle.; ; . The clique complex of G is equivalent to the independence complex of the complement graph of G. Flag complex In an abstract simplicial complex, a set S of vertices that is not itself a face of the complex, but such that each pair of vertices in S belongs to some face in the complex, is called an empty simplex. Mikhail Gromov defined the no-Δ condition to be the condition that a complex have no empty simplices. A flag complex is an abstract simplicial complex that has no empty simplices; that is, it is a complex satisfying Gromov's no-Δ condition. Any flag complex is the clique complex of its 1-skeleton. Thus, flag complexes and clique complexes are essentially the same thing. However, in many cases it may be convenient to define a flag complex directly from some data other than a graph, rather than indirectly as the clique complex of a graph derived from that data.. Conformal hypergraph The primal graph G(H) of a hypergraph is the graph on the same vertex set that has as its edges the pairs of vertices appearing together in the same hyperedge. A hypergraph is said to be conformal if every maximal clique of its primal graph is a hyperedge, or equivalently, if every clique of its primal graph is contained in some hyperedge.; . If the hypergraph is required to be downward-closed (so it contains all hyperedges that are contained in some hyperedge) then the hypergraph is conformal precisely when it is a flag complex. This relates the language of hypergraphs to the language of simplicial complexes. Examples and applications The barycentric subdivision of any cell complex C is a flag complex having one vertex per cell of C. A collection of vertices of the barycentric subdivision form a simplex if and only if the corresponding collection of cells of C form a flag (a chain in the inclusion ordering of the cells). In particular, the barycentric subdivision of a cell complex on a 2-manifold gives rise to a Whitney triangulation of the manifold. The order complex of a partially ordered set consists of the chains (totally ordered subsets) of the partial order. If every pair of some subset is itself ordered, then the whole subset is a chain, so the order complex satisfies the no-Δ condition. It may be interpreted as the clique complex of the comparability graph of the partial order. The matching complex of a graph consists of the sets of edges no two of which share an endpoint; again, this family of sets satisfies the no-Δ condition. It may be viewed as the clique complex of the complement graph of the line graph of the given graph. When the matching complex is referred to without any particular graph as context, it means the matching complex of a complete graph. The matching complex of a complete bipartite graph Km,n is known as a chessboard complex. It is the clique graph of the complement graph of a rook's graph,. and each of its simplices represents a placement of rooks on an m × n chess board such that no two of the rooks attack each other. When m = n ± 1, the chessboard complex forms a pseudo-manifold. The Vietoris–Rips complex of a set of points in a metric space is a special case of a clique complex, formed from the unit disk graph of the points; however, every clique complex X(G) may be interpreted as the Vietoris–Rips complex of the shortest path metric on the underlying graph G. describe an application of conformal hypergraphs in the logics of relational structures. In that context, the Gaifman graph of a relational structure is the same as the underlying graph of the hypergraph representing the structure, and a structure is guarded if it corresponds to a conformal hypergraph. Gromov showed that a cubical complex (that is, a family of hypercubes intersecting face-to-face) forms a CAT(0) space if and only if the complex is simply connected and the link of every vertex forms a flag complex. A cubical complex meeting these conditions is sometimes called a cubing or a space with walls..  Homology groups  Meshulam proves the following theorem on the homology of the clique complex. Given integers l\\\\geq 1, t\\\\geq 0, suppose a graph G satisfies a property called P(l,t), which means that: * Every set of l vertices in G has a common neighbor; * There exists a set A of vertices, that contains a common neighbor to every set of l vertices, and in addition, the induced graph G[A] does not contain, as an induced subgraph, a copy of the 1-skeleton of the t-dimensional octahedral sphere. Then the j-th reduced homology of the clique complex X(G) is trivial for any j between 0 and \\\\max(l-t, \\\\lfloor {l}/{2}\\\\rfloor)-1.

Bryce is the ex- college roommate and fraternity brother\\"Chuck Versus the Alma Mater\\" of the series' main character, Chuck Bartowski, and was formerly partnered and once romantically involved with Chuck's CIA handler Sarah Walker. Bryce was responsible for sending Chuck the Intersect, beginning the events of the series. He is portrayed by Matt Bomer. Biography Most of what has been revealed about Bryce's background has been in dialogue, with some details provided in flashbacks. \\"Chuck Versus the Intersect\\" established that Bryce was originally from Connecticut. He attended Stanford University, where he met Chuck Bartowski on his first day of class in 1999. As shown in \\"Chuck Versus the Alma Mater,\\" Chuck and Bryce quickly became friends because of their mutual interest in computers and video games. While in Stanford they wrote their own version of the classic computer game Zork in C++. The same episode also established that Bryce was friends with Jill Roberts, who would later begin dating Chuck. Bryce and Chuck enjoyed games of Gotcha! in the school library. Bryce was recruited into the CIA by Professor George Fleming in 2002. The following year, Bryce learned that Fleming intended to recruit Chuck as well for the Omaha Project. As shown in \\"Chuck Versus the Alma Mater,\\" Bryce sacrificed his close friendship with Chuck to protect Chuck from the government, which he told Fleming would destroy him. He conspired with the professor to frame Chuck for cheating on his exams, and Fleming expelled Chuck, claiming that Bryce tipped them off. To make matters worse, Jill Roberts told Chuck that she had left him for Bryce, a lie she told under the orders of a CIA splinter group called Fulcrum.\\"Chuck Versus the Gravitron\\" Because he protected Chuck from the government, he was the only spy Stephen J. Bartowski (a.k.a. Orion, the creator of the Intersect) would trust, and Bryce promised Orion not to let the Intersect fall into the wrong hands.\\"Chuck Versus the Ring\\" Sometime in 2005, Bryce was first partnered with Sarah Walker. At some point, their professional relationship spilled over into an intimate one and they became lovers. However, as established in \\"Chuck Versus the Nemesis,\\" Bryce was later contacted by Fulcrum to steal the Intersect, leading to his separation from Sarah and the central events of the series. Series At the beginning of the series, Bryce is shown on an apparent rogue mission stealing the Intersect from the National Intelligence Directorate. During his escape attempt, he sends the entire database to Chuck-using their custom Zork game as a code-just as he is shot (apparently fatally) by NSA Agent John Casey. Although Bryce only appears sporadically throughout the first two seasons, his theft of the Intersect and sending it to Chuck gives him an important place in the series' mythology, as his actions set the overall arc in motion. Revelations about the events surrounding this theft and Bryce's motives are meted out over the course of the first two seasons. Bryce stole the Intersect to keep it out of Fulcrum's hands, and did so under Stephen Bartowski's guidance. But despite Stephen's wishes to keep Chuck out of it, Bryce sent the Intersect to Chuck because he knew Chuck could handle the Intersect and that Sarah would find Chuck. Chuck was unaware of Bryce's work with the CIA and his apparent death until told about both by Sarah in \\"Chuck Versus the Intersect.\\" Dialogue throughout the first half of the first season reinforces the appearance that Bryce's betrayals destroyed Chuck's life. Because Bryce had not informed Sarah of his plans, she initially believes he betrayed both her and his country. Chuck and Sarah attend his funeral in \\"Chuck Versus the Helicopter\\". After the pilot, Bryce's next appearance is in flashbacks throughout \\"Chuck Versus the Alma Mater,\\" when the team's mission takes them to Stanford and forces Chuck to confront his expulsion. The truth of events is revealed, and Chuck and Sarah realize that Bryce only betrayed him to protect him. It is first revealed that Bryce survived being shot by Casey in \\"Chuck Versus the Imported Hard Salami.\\" More information, including why he stole the Intersect, is revealed in the following episode, when Bryce introduces Chuck and the team to Fulcrum, whose agent, Tommy Delgado, Bryce deceived into believing he possessed the Intersect in his head. After defeating Tommy, Bryce is ordered by General Beckman to go into deep cover and pursue Fulcrum. According to Bryce, for all intents and purposes, he was to remain dead. Bryce resurfaces again in \\"Chuck Versus the Break-Up\\" to obtain the team's assistance in recovering an update for the Intersect that was stolen by Fulcrum. The operation is nearly botched when Sarah abandons the assignment to protect Chuck, who had been captured. Bryce also continues to push Sarah on restarting their relationship before he is confronted by Devon Woodcomb, who tells Bryce that Sarah loves Chuck. Bryce attempts to warn Chuck off by telling him that Sarah's feelings for him endangered not only the mission but both her and Chuck's lives. Before disappearing, Bryce leaves Chuck a pair of sunglasses containing an Intersect update. In Bryce's appearances leading into the second season finale, \\"Chuck Versus the Ring,\\" he is used to derail Chuck and Sarah's developing relationship. However, in that episode he ultimately realizes Sarah's true love for Chuck, as she decides not to accompany Bryce on the new Intersect project, where Bryce is meant to be the human Intersect. Bryce is mortally wounded in \\"Chuck Versus the Ring\\" and asks Chuck to destroy the Intersect for him before dying from his injury. Chuck, knowing that the intel is essential for the CIA, and for lack of any option, sacrifices his normal future by taking Bryce's place as the human Intersect, uploading the Intersect 2.0 before destroying it. In Chuck Versus First Class, Sarah told Daniel Shaw that she spread Bryce's ashes in Lisbon, Portugal where they took their first mission. It is unknown if this is in fact the truth or a lie Sarah told to cover her intent to go rogue with Chuck in Chuck Versus the Pink Slip. Development Rumors of Bryce Larkin's return began to appear in early October, 2007.Development Update: October 1, 2007: SPOILERS His return was confirmed with Matthew Bomer's cameo at the end of \\"Chuck Versus the Imported Hard Salami,\\" although many reviewers noted that both the promo for the episode, and Bomer's name in the credits for the episode spoiled the ending.Review, November 20, 2007: IGN.com ReviewReview, January 18, 2007: 'Total Sci-Fi Review' Bryce's return for \\"Chuck Versus the Nemesis\\" led to an increase in ratings to well over 8 million viewers for the night.Ratings Update: November 27, 2007: Chuck Climbs Again Bryce Larkin's return in Season Two was first revealed in June, 2008Development Update: June 5, 2008: Episode 2.03 and later confirmed in an interview with Chris Fedak, Josh Schwartz and Zachary Levi in August.Development Update: August 9, 2008: Schwartz, Fedak & Zac Spills (some) Beans on Season 2 IGN.com noted that once again, Bomer's return was spoiled by his name appearing in the credits of \\"Chuck Versus the Seduction.\\"Review: October 7, 2008: IGN.com Review =Personality= Bryce Larkin is presented in the series as all the things Chuck is not: confident, athletic, brave under fire, and an excellent spy. Bryce is a skilled martial artist, and a fight scene in the Buy More in \\"Chuck Versus the Nemesis\\" proves that his and Sarah's abilities strongly complement each other. Further commendation of Bryce's abilities comes in \\"Chuck Versus the Nemesis\\" when Casey calls him dangerous, and later tells Chuck, \\"When you have a chance to shoot Bryce Larkin, you shoot to kill.\\" In \\"Chuck Versus the Intersect,\\" a party-goer who knew Bryce at Stanford embarrassed Chuck with all of Bryce's accomplishments while there. On several occasions Chuck has commented how short he falls in comparison with Bryce. In \\"Chuck Versus the Intersect,\\" Bryce is already acquainted with Casey, and their dialog together throughout \\"Chuck Versus the Nemesis\\" suggests that the two have an antagonistic past. Bryce is still in love with Sarah and has continued to pursue a relationship with her. He was hurt in \\"Chuck Versus the Break-Up\\" when he realized that Sarah had moved on and had feelings for Chuck. Bryce highly values his friendship with Chuck. He also highly regards Chuck's innocence, honesty and integrity. In fact, it is implied while Chuck looks up to him, Bryce looks up to Chuck for those reasons and he was willing to destroy that relationship to protect him from losing those traits. In \\"Chuck Versus the Nemesis,\\" Bryce tells Chuck that Chuck is the only friend he really has, which begins to repair their damaged friendship. The two share many of the same interests, including computers, programming and video games. Both speak Klingon, which they successfully used as a code during a mission.\\"Chuck Versus the Nemesis\\" The series has not revealed how much of a relationship Bryce had with Chuck's family or other friends. Although Devon spoke with him face to face in \\"Chuck Versus the Break-Up,\\" he didn't recognize Bryce.

It has a roof height of and stands with its antenna spire included. It was Rochester, New York's tallest building for over 50 years from its completion in 1914 until the Xerox Square Tower surpassed it in the late 1960s. Today, it is the 4th tallest building in Rochester, NY and is the 9th tallest building in New York State outside NYC. The Kodak Tower has long been recognized as a landmark in the Rochester Skyline, and an icon in the world of film photography. The building has also been called the \\"nerve center of photography\\".Emporis.com:Kodak Tower The Eastman Kodak Company owns the skyscraper, and it remains the company's headquarters.A Virtual Tour of the Kodak Office Neighborhood In 2008, Kodak undertook work to repair and restore the exterior of the building.Kodak to Repair restore World Headquarters Tower History The Kodak Tower was constructed on the site of a former factory next to several seven story Camera Works buildings that clustered around the site. Construction began in 1912 and was completed in 1914 with Kodak founder George Eastman presiding over the project.Kodak Construction Upon its completion in 1914, the tower held the title of the tallest building in Rochester, New York until the 1960s. = Design & Construction = Kodak Tower was designed by Howard Wright Cutler and Gordon & Kaelber Architects with a French Renaissance style. When construction began in 1912, the building was designed as a 16-story high-rise with a steel skeleton faced with terra cotta.Emporis.com:Kodak Tower The building overtook the Powers Building to become the tallest building in the city upon its completion in 1914. = Spire Addition = Spire detail In the late 1920s, the architects of the Genesee Valley Trust building announced plans to mount an architectural feature that would threaten the Kodak Tower's status as the city's tallest building. Following the announcement Eastman Kodak hired an architect to construct 3 more floors on the building with a mansard roof and aluminum tower bringing the tower to a height of feet in 1935. = Peregrine Falcon Webcam = In 1994 Dennis Money, the founder of the Rochester Peregrine Falcon Project, got permission from Kodak to install a nest box on the spire of the Kodak Office Tower. The nest box was installed as part of an effort to reintroduce peregrine falcons to eastern North America after the species was listed on the U.S. Endangered Species list.Rochester's Falcon HistoryKodak Peregrine Falcon Web Cam In 1998 a pair of peregrine falcons known to the public as Mariah & Cabot-Sirocco began nesting in the nest box. The reintroduction effort became popular over the web after Brad Carney an IT Consultant at Eastman Kodak coordinated an effort to install web cams around the nest and made the web cam imagery available on the web for the public to view. The web cam quickly became a popular attraction on the Kodak website.Peregrine Falcons at Kodak Mariah hatched 43 falcon chicks at the top of the Kodak Tower until the nest box was relocated to the Times Square Building in 2008 when Eastman Kodak announced plans to do extensive restoration work on the Tower.Rochester's Falcon History Architecture Kodak Tower Under Renovation in 2008 Kodak Tower is tall to its roof and reaches a full height of tall.

In 1884, he played outfield for the Salem team in the Massachusetts State Association, and pitched for the Lawrence team of the New England League in 1885. Conway was 21 years old when he entered the majors in 1886 with the Baltimore Orioles, playing for them one year before joining the Boston Beaneaters (1887–1888). While playing for Baltimore, Conway entered the baseball record books with his older brother and batterymate Bill Conway, the pair becoming one of 16 pitcher/catcher sibling combinations in major league history. His most productive season came in 1887, when he collected career-numbers in wins (9), starts (26), and innings pitched (). In a three-season career, Conway posted a 15–24 record with a 4.78 earned run average in 41 appearances, including 41 starts and 39 complete games, giving up 187 earned runs on 404 hits and 137 walks while striking out 121 in 352.0 innings of work. He also played 18 games as an outfielder, compiling a career .230 batting average (47-for-204) with 27 runs and 14 RBI. While at Boston in 1888, he also played briefly for the Hyannis town team in what is now the Cape Cod Baseball League. Following his majors career, Conway returned to the New England League and later pitched in the International League. He died in his homeland of Lowell at the age of 61.

The centre is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service, and was previously a women's prison. History Morton Hall was originally the site of an RAF base, which was converted into a prison and opened in 1985. It was expanded in 1996, and refitted to become a semi-open women's prison in 2001. Two ready to use units were opened in 2002, increasing overall capacity. From that time Morton Hall has been developing as a prison holding a high percentage of foreign nationals. In January 2004, Morton became the first prison in England (along with HMP Kirkham) to trial the Intermittent Custody Scheme. The scheme saw some inmates held at Morton Hall from Monday to Friday (released at weekends), while another set of prisoners were held on Saturdays and Sundays (released during the week). The scheme was designed to allow prisoners on short sentences to remain in employment, independent housing and maintain family ties during their jail terms. The scheme was subsequently abandoned in November 2006. In May 2004, a report from the Prison Reform Trust called for more facilities and support for foreign prisoners held at Morton Hall. The Trust noted improvements at the jail, but stated that more resources and staff training were needed to improve the regime at Morton Hall. Morton Hall was recategorised as a closed women's prison in 2009. The prison held a high percentage of foreign nationals, and had a resettlement unit for prisoners coming to the end of their sentence who were settling in the UK. In 2011 Morton Hall closed and re-opened as an Immigration Removal Centre, holding adult males awaiting deportation. The centre was formally opened on 1 June 2011 by Immigration Minister Damian Green. In April 2015 several detainees started refusing food, in solidarity with a hunger strike at Harmondsworth immigration detention centre.Chris Green, Harmondsworth: Asylum seekers' hunger strike spreads to second centre, The Independent, 7 April 2015. Deaths in custody On 5 September 2014 Rubel Ahmed, a 26-year-old detainee, died in controversial circumstances at Morton Hall, resulting in rioting and prompting calls for an independent inquiry.Diane Taylor, Call for inquiry into death at Morton Hall immigration detention centre, The Guardian, 7 September 2014. During the period 2016-2017, four people died in custody at Morton Hall. =Attempted deportation of witnesses= In April 2018, Home Secretary Amber Rudd was barred by the High Court from her attempt to deport a witness before he could give evidence to an inquest into the death of Carlington Spencer at Morton Hall. In February 2019, it emerged that the Home Office intended to deport, in February 2019, two other key witnesses in the inquest the death of Spencer's death, before they would be able to give testimony. They were due to give evidence in March 2019. The witnesses accused the Home Office of attempting to cover up the events leading to Spencer's death, by preventing their evidence from being heard in court.

Development  The Defense Agency's Technical Research and Development Institution issued a requirement for a new APC to replace the Type 60 APC in 1967. Among the requirements included a maximum speed of over 60 km/h, ability to carry 12 men including the crew, to be fully amphibious, have all-welded aluminium armor, provision for the infantry to use their small arms from inside the vehicle and be armed with a 20 mm cannon, a 12.7 mm machine gun and a 7.62 mm machine gun. An automotive test rig, called the SUT, was built in 1968. Komatsu and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries each built two prototypes the following year, one each in steel and aluminium. Mitsubishi's aluminium model was chosen for use in December 1973.  Description  The Type 73 is almost unique in that it uses a mid-engined V4 layout, as the driver and bow machine gunner are in the front of the vehicle. The commander sits slightly behind the bow gunner while the gunner sits behind the driver. The engine is mounted on the left side behind the bow gunner with both its air intake and exhaust on the top of the vehicle. The engine and transmission are designed to be easily removed as one complete unit. The gunner's cupola can traverse a full 360°, but the bow gunner's weapon can only traverse, elevate and depress 30°. It is fitted with six smoke dischargers, three on each side. Its infantry can fire their personal weapons from inside the vehicle. The Type 73 requires additional equipment to become amphibious and is propelled through the water by its tracks at a maximum speed of . It is fitted with infra-red driving lights and an NBC system. Rear view of a Type 73 showing the smoke dischargers and the firing ports in the rear doors  Variants  A command version is in service with a raised roof. The Type 73's chassis served has been adapted for use by the Type 75 130 mm Multiple Rocket Launcher, its companion Type 75 wind measurement vehicle and the Type 74 105 mm Self-propelled howitzer. Status As of 2001, Japan reported to the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs that 337 Type 73s were in service, although it seems unlikely to be fully superseded due to the Type 89's slow production rate.

The Australians went undefeated in their 34 matches; this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet The Invincibles. Lindwall played as a right-arm opening fast bowler and right-handed batsman in the lower middle-order. Along with Keith Miller, Lindwall formed Australia's first-choice pace duo, regarded as one of the best of all time, and Bradman typically used them in short and sharp bursts against the home batsmen. The pair were used to target England's leading batsmen, Len Hutton and Denis Compton during the major matches, and subdued Hutton for much of the summer. England had agreed to make a new ball available after every 55 overs, more often than the usual regulations at the time, thereby allowing the pair more frequent use of a shiny ball that swung at high pace. Bradman gave the duo lighter workloads in the tour matches in order to preserve their energy for the new ball battles against England's key batsmen in the Tests. Lindwall was a capable lower-order batsman who made two Test centuries during his career, and he featured in several rearguard actions that boosted Australia's scores during the tour. Lindwall was the equal leading wicket-taker in the Tests (27 along with Bill Johnston) and had the best bowling average (19.62) and strike rate. In the first-class matches, he led the averages although he was second in the wicket-taking list with 86 at 15.68 behind Johnston (102), who was assigned more of the workload in order to keep Miller and Lindwall fresh for the Tests. With the bat, Lindwall scored 191 runs at a batting average of 31.83 in the Tests. Lindwall's most influential contributions in the Ashes matches were his 5/70 in the first innings of the Second Test at Lord's, a hard-hitting 77 that limited Australia's first innings deficit in the Fourth Test at Headingley, and most notably, his 6/20 on the first day of the Fifth Test at The Oval. The performance was a display of extreme pace and swing that earned high praise from pundits and was largely responsible for England being bowled out for 52. Outside the Tests, Lindwall took 11/59 in a match against Sussex, with eight of his victims being bowled as the ball curved through their defences at high pace. In recognition of his achievements, Lindwall was chosen as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year. Wisden said that \\"by whatever standard he is judged ... [Lindwall] must be placed permanently in the gallery of great fast bowlers\\".  Background  A bowler of express pace, Lindwall was a regular member of the Test team and had opened Australia's attack since the resumption of cricket following World War II. During the Australian summer of 1947–48, Lindwall played in all five Tests against the touring Indian cricket team. He played a major part in Australia's 4–0 series win as the leading wicket-taker with 18 scalps at an average of 16.88, ahead of Ian Johnson and Bill Johnston who took 16 apiece at averages of 16.31 and 11.37 respectively. As a result, Lindwall was selected as part of Don Bradman's Invincibles that toured England without defeat in 1948, with the intention of leading the pace attack. There were two concerns for Lindwall in the lead-up to the tour. Lindwall had been playing with an injured leg tendon and his foot drag during the delivery stride led to discussion in the media and among umpires as to its legality. Bradman arranged for Lindwall to see his Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, who restored the paceman's leg to prime condition in a fortnight. On the public relations front, Bradman stated his firm belief in the fairness of Lindwall's delivery. During the lengthy sea voyage to England, Bradman emphasized the importance of caution with respect to his bowling action. Bradman advised Lindwall to ensure that his dragging rear right foot was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no-balled, and to refrain from bowling at full speed until the umpires were satisfied with his delivery stride. The Australian captain guaranteed Lindwall selection for the Tests and told him that his first priority in the lead-in tour matches was passing the umpires' scrutiny.Perry (2001), p. 222. Bradman recalled how paceman Ernie McCormick had been no-balled 35 times in the traditional tour opener against Worcester during the 1938 campaign, destroying his confidence for the rest of the season.  Early tour  In the lead-up to the match against Worcestershire, photographers and cameramen constantly followed Lindwall, trying to capture visual evidence of an illegal drag when he was bowling in the practice nets.Fingleton, p. 42. Bradman tried to stop the journalists from taking photographs of the crease as Lindwall came in to bowl, and deflected media questions about his bowler's drag.Perry (2008), pp. 24, 26. The spectators and media were keenly observing the position of his foot in the tour opener,Perry (2008), pp. 233-234. but Lindwall was not no-balled in the first match at Worcester, and complaints about his drag faded away for the rest of the tour.Fingleton, p. 44. The hosts elected to bat first, and Lindwall took 2/41 in the first innings, bowling and trapping his victims leg before wicket before delivering three wicketless overs for 19 runs in the second innings. Lindwall took a wicket with his second ball in England, trapping Don Kenyon for a duck to leave the hosts at 1/0. He was promoted to No. 4 as Bradman rotated his batting order and he scored a quickfire 32 from 34 balls with six boundaries before Australia completed an innings victory. According to former Australian Test batsman and journalist Jack Fingleton, Lindwall \\"took things very quietly ... The fast bowler is very wise who builds up his speed match by match\\".Fingleton, p. 47. With the media and public attention now focused on actual bowling, Lindwall's classical bowling action evoked almost as much interest as his captain's batting. Bradman rested Lindwall for the second tour match against Leicestershire, which ended in an innings victory for the Australians. Lindwall returned for the next fixture against Yorkshire at Bradford, but bowled only nine overs for a total of 1/16. He made a duck in the first innings on a damp pitch favourable to slower bowling, as Australia scraped home by four wickets. Lindwall was due in next when Australia collapsed to 6/31 in pursuit of 60 for victory in the second innings. The tourists were effectively seven wickets down with the injured Sam Loxton unable to bat, but Neil Harvey and Don Tallon saw Australia to the target without further loss. It was the closest Australia came to defeat for the whole tour.Fingleton, pp. 53–58. The Australians travelled to London to play Surrey at The Oval. They batted first and Lindwall managed only four, clean bowled by Alec Bedser,Fingleton, p. 59. as Australia amassed 632. He then took the first two wickets to reduce Surrey to 2/15 in the first innings. Bradman used Lindwall sparingly, taking a match total of 3/45 from 25 overs as Surrey were defeated by an innings. Fingleton felt that Lindwall was at his fastest for the season during the Surrey match. One of Lindwall's bouncers flew over three feet above the batsman's head.Fingleton, p. 61. Lindwall had another light workout in the match against Cambridge University, taking match figures of 1/33 from nine overs. His solitary wicket was that of Doug Insole, and he was not required to bat as Australia completed another innings victory. After the fixture against Cambridge, Lindwall was rested for two consecutive matches. In the first, Australia crushed Essex by an innings and 451 runs, its largest winning margin for the summer. The second match resulted in another innings victory, this time over Oxford University. Lindwall was brought back for the match against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia selected their first- choice team. It was a chance for the Australian pace attack to gain a psychological advantage ahead of the Tests, with Len Hutton, Denis Compton and Bill Edrich—three of England's first four batsmen—all playing. Australia batted first and Lindwall scored 29, including three sixes from the bowling of England Test off spinner Jim Laker.Fingleton, p. 73. After Australia amassed 552, Lindwall took combined figures of 2/68, removing Compton and England and MCC captain Norman Yardley as the tourists enforced the follow on by an innings and 158 runs. The MCC fixture was followed by Australia's first non- victory of the tour against Lancashire. After the first day was washed out, Lindwall made a duck and then took 3/44, removing Test players Ken Cranston and Jack Ikin during the hosts’ only innings. He was not required to bat in the second innings as the match petered into a draw on the final day. In the next match against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, Lindwall took 6/14 to gain a psychological blow ahead of the First Test to be held at the same venue. After taking the first four wickets and cutting through the top-order, the paceman returned to finish off the tail and ensure the hosts were dismissed for 179. Lindwall bowled three of his victims with fast and swinging yorkers. He delivered 91 balls, conceding less than a run per over. Only ten of his balls were scored from and not a single run was taken from his last 30 balls. Fingleton said that Lindwall \\"absolutely paralysed\\" the batsmen, with some of his bowling \\"in the real Larwood manner\\".Fingleton, p. 77. Harold Larwood was a Nottinghamshire express pace bowler of the 1920s and 1930s who led the controversial Bodyline attack in Australia in 1932-33, and Lindwall modelled his bowling action on Larwood after seeing him in action at the Sydney Cricket Ground during the tour.Perry (2001), p. 211. Lindwall could only manage eight runs with the bat and was unable to repeat his incisive bowling in the second innings, sending down 14 wicketless overs as the match ended in a draw. Lindwall was rested for Australia's eight-wicket win over Hampshire, before returning in the following match against Sussex. Bowling with a tailwind,Perry (2008), p. 93. he took two early wickets before returning to remove the last four batsmen to fall. Five of Lindwall's opponents were bowled as he ended with 6/34 from 19.4 overs; the hosts were dismissed for 86. During the tourists' reply, Bradman promoted Lindwall to No. 4 and he came to the wicket at 2/342, scored 57 and put on 93 runs with Neil Harvey, who scored an unbeaten 100 as Australia declared at 5/549. Lindwall then broke through with two early wickets to leave Sussex at 2/2, and went on to finish with 5/25 in 15 overs as the home side were bowled out for 138, handing Bradman's men a victory by an innings and 325 runs in two days. He ended with match figures of 11/59, with eight of his victims being bowled, five of these by swinging yorkers, unable to counter Lindwall's swerving deliveries.Pollard, p. 9. Fingleton said that \\"Lindwall bundled the stumps over in all directions\\" as Sussex \\"crumpled completely ... in as depressing a batting performance as the tour knew\\".Fingleton, p. 79.  First Test  Lindwall lined up for the First Test at Trent Bridge, a venue where he had taken six wickets in the tour game against Nottinghamshire. Australia bowled first, and Lindwall delivered the first ball of the match at a moderate pace; Hutton pushed it square of the wicket on the off side for a single to start proceedings.Arlott, p. 30. Lindwall gradually increased his speed and rhythm, and took the wicket of Cyril Washbrook, caught on the run by Bill Brown on the fine leg boundary after the batsman had attempted a hook shot.Fingleton, p. 84. However, he was forced to leave the field with a groin strain midway through the first day, ending with figures of 1/30. After England were out for 165, Lindwall came out to bat at 7/365 without a runner on the third day, and appeared to be able to run twos and threes without significant difficulty.O'Reilly, p. 42. He added 107 runs for the eighth wicket with vice-captain Lindsay Hassett. Hassett reached his century and proceeded to 137 in almost six hours of batting before Bedser struck his off stump. Four runs later, Lindwall was caught by wicket- keeper Godfrey Evans down the leg side to leave the total at 6/469, but some free hitting by Australia's last pair allowed them to advance to 509, giving them a 344-run lead. Although Lindwall was able to jog between the wickets, he did not take the field in the second innings and the 12th man Neil Harvey replaced him. This gave Australia a marked fielding advantage—Fingleton described Harvey as \\"by far the most brilliant fieldsman of both sides\\".Fingleton, p. 96. Yardley was sceptical as to whether Lindwall was sufficiently injured to be forced from the field, but he did not formally object to Harvey's presence on the field. Journalist, former Australian Test cricketer and Lindwall mentor Bill O'Reilly, said that as Lindwall demonstrated his mobility during his innings, he was in no way \\"incapacitated\\" and that the English captain \\"must be condemned for carrying his concepts of sportsmanship too far\\" when no substitute was justified. O'Reilly decried the benefit Australia derived through the substitution, agreeing with Fingleton that Harvey was the tourists' best fielder by far. English commentator John Arlott went further, calling Harvey the best fielder in the world.Arlott, p. 41. However, the gains provided by Harvey were outweighed by Lindwall's absence, which severely hampered Australia's bowling and made their eventual victory much more difficult.Fingleton, pp. 97, 100-106. England made 441 and Australia reached their target of 98 on the final afternoon to complete an eight-wicket victory. Due to his injury, Lindwall was omitted from the team for the two matches leading up to the Second Test. Australia proceeded to defeat Northamptonshire by an innings before drawing with Yorkshire.  Second Test  Two weeks after injuring himself at Trent Bridge, Lindwall undertook a thorough fitness examination on the morning of the Second Test at Lord's. Bradman was not convinced of the bowler's fitness, but Lindwall—keen to play at the historic ground known as the \\"home of cricket\\"—was able to convince his captain to risk his inclusion. Australia won the toss and elected to bat, allowing Lindwall further time to recover. He came in late on the first afternoon with the score at 7/246 and made three runs before stumps were called at 7/258. The next morning, Lindwall batted confidently from the outset. He hit two cover drives for four from Bedser after the new ball had been taken, prompting O'Reilly to say that Lindwall was playing in the same manner as when he made his maiden Test century in the last Ashes series in 1946-47\\\\. However, he then played around a straight ball from Bedser, and was bowled for 15 to leave the score at 275/8.O'Reilly, p. 67. Australia were out for 350 shortly before lunch on the second morning. In the hosts' reply, Lindwall took the new ball and felt pain in his groin after delivering the first ball of the innings to Len Hutton.Perry (2001), p. 223. Despite this, the paceman persevered through the pain. In his fourth over, Lindwall had Washbrook caught behind for eight after needlessly playing at a ball wide outside off stump.O'Reilly, p. 69. Before lunch, Lindwall bowled six overs and took 1/7, while Bill Johnston accompanied him from the other end because Keith Miller had a back injury and was only able to bat. Neither Hutton nor Washbrook appeared comfortable against the bowling, and the new batsman Bill Edrich tried to hit Lindwall through the off side, leading to a loud appeal for caught behind, which was turned down. After the lunch break, Hutton fell, and Compton came in, having been dismissed hit wicket after falling over in the First Test while trying to avoid a bouncer. Lindwall delivered a few short balls straight away, but the new batsman was not caught off-guard.O'Reilly, p. 70. Lindwall then clean bowled Bill Edrich—who was playing across the line of the ball—for five. Tom Dollery was the new batsman and stopped the first ball with his pads before Lindwall's next delivery broke through his defences and hit the stumps to send him back to the pavilion for a duck. Dollery's bat was about to start its downward swing by the time Lindwall's outswinger had passed him and hit the stumps. O'Reilly said that Dollery's inability to deal with Lindwall was typical of English cricket's lack of answers to express pace bowling. This was part of a six-over post-lunch spell of 2/11 by Lindwall; the batsmen appeared unable to deal with his swing and extreme pace. England were 4/46 and Australia firmly in control, but the home side were given some respite when both Lindwall and Johnston were taken out of the attack.Fingleton, p. 111. Australia had the option of taking the new ball just before the tea break, but Bradman decided to wait so his two pacemen could have an extra 20 minutes to replenish their energy levels.O'Reilly, p. 71. Once the second new ball was taken after tea, Lindwall returned but appeared to be tired and lacking in spirit in his first over. Johnston removed Compton, and one run later, Lindwall clipped Yardley's off stump with the first ball of the next over to leave England at 134/6; the home skipper had made 44 before an outswinger had evaded his bat as he attempted to play a back foot defensive shot. At the start of the third morning, he bowled Alec Bedser off an inside edge from a bouncer to finish with 5/70 as Australia took a 135-run first innings lead on the third morning.Fingleton, p. 112. O'Reilly said Lindwall \\"bowled as well as any fast bowler can bowl. He always seemed to have the situation sized up correctly and he knew just when to put his all into the task ... and enjoyed a triumph which seldom comes to any bowler.\\"O'Reilly, p. 72. Arlott praised Lindwall for his subtle variations in pace, line and length, and how he kept the batsman guessing as to what was coming to them.Arlott, p. 63. Bradman's batsmen set about building on their lead and Lindwall was initially not expected to bat; the Australian captain was expected to declare just before lunch on the fourth day so he could attack the English openers for a short period before the adjournment, but a shower deterred him from doing so, as his bowlers would have struggled to grip the ball. Lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times.O'Reilly, p. 76. Lindwall came to the crease to join Miller with Australia at 5/416 on the fourth afternoon. They attacked at every opportunity before the declaration. Miller fell and Lindwall ran out of his crease in attempt to hit Laker across the line to the boundary. He missed and was stumped for 25. This prompted Bradman to declare at 7/460 immediately upon his dismissal, leaving England to chase a world record 596 for victory. Further showers breathed extra life into the pitch at the start of the run chase, and Lindwall and Johnston extracted steep bounce with the new ball, troubling the English batsmen. Lindwall dropped Hutton from Johnston's bowling before he had scored and the English batsmen played and missed multiple times. Hutton had trouble seeing and playing Lindwall's deliveries in the deteriorating light with no sightscreen available, and Fingleton described it as \\"probably Hutton's worst effort in a Test\\".Fingleton, p. 121. O'Reilly said Hutton \\"seemed to have lost all power of concentration and looked like a man being led to the gallows\\", calling him \\"little more than a masquerader compared to the Hutton [of 1938]\\".O'Reilly, p. 77. Hutton took 32 minutes of batting to score his first run of the innings.Arlott, p. 70. Hutton and Washbrook took the score to 42—England's highest opening partnership of the series thus far—before the latter edged Lindwall to Johnson in the slips and was out for 13. Edrich and Washbrook were then subjected to repeated short balls, and the latter was hit several times on the fingers while fending down Lindwall's bouncers, having decided to avoid the hook shot. However, they survived Lindwall's spell of bowling. Late in the day, Lindwall was brought back to put pressure on Dollery, having bowled him for a duck in the first innings, but the batsman had already been in the middle for a short period, and played the pace bowling with more assurance. Lindwall returned on the final morning with the score at 6/141. Dollery, who had been batting with assurance,O'Reilly, p. 79. shaped to duck under a Lindwall bouncer, but it skidded through low and bowled him. Later in the same over, Lindwall bowled Laker for a duck to leave England at 8/141. The match ended when Doug Wright hit Ernie Toshack to Lindwall and was caught for four. Lindwall ended with 3/61 as Australia took a 409-run victory. Arlott said that while Toshack (5/40) had the best figures, Lindwall was the pivotal figure. He said that when Lindwall \\"so patently disturbed Hutton he struck a blow at the morale of the English batting that was never overcome.\\"Arlott, p. 75. In later years, Bradman told Lindwall he pretended not to notice the bowler's pain. Lindwall was worried Bradman had noticed his injury and would be disappointed, but the Australian captain later claimed to have feigned ignorance to allow Lindwall to relax and focus on his bowling. After carrying an injury into the Second Test, Bradman rested Lindwall for the match against Surrey, which started the day after the proceedings at Lord's ended; Australia took a ten-wicket victory. Lindwall returned for the match against Gloucestershire. Australia batted first and made 7/774, its highest score of the tour and the second highest by any Australian team in England. Lindwall was not able to partake in the prolific run-getting, as the tourists declared before he had scored. He bowled a total of 21 overs, taking 0/41 as Australia enforced the follow on and won by an innings and 363 runs.  Third Test  When the teams reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test, Hutton had been dropped, sparking much acrimony and controversy in the English cricket community. The reason was said to be Hutton's difficulties against Lindwall's short-pitched bowling.Perry (2001), p. 224. Observers noticed Hutton backing away, and the English selectors believed such a sight would have a negative effect on the rest of the side as it was a poor example from a key player.Bowes, p. 190. The Australians were pleased and believed the England selectors had erred, because they regarded Hutton as the hosts' best batsman. England batted first and Lindwall removed Hutton's replacement as opener, George Emmett, who fended a short ball to Sid Barnes at short leg to leave England at 2/28. Emmett had been surprised by Lindwall's bouncer and took his eyes from the ball, fending with one hand on the bat, while ducking his head below his arms.Fingleton, p. 131.O'Reilly, p. 88. The ball bounced slowly off the pitch and after hitting Emmett's bat, rebounded gently up in the air for Barnes to collect. In Australia's match against Gloucestershire immediately preceding the Test, Lindwall bowled a bouncer to Emmett, who hesitantly parried it away for a single. Lindwall did not bounce Emmett again during the match, and O’Reilly surmised that the paceman was quietly waiting until the Tests to expose his opponent's weakness against the short ball. O’Reilly concluded that Lindwall and Johnston \\"had again disposed of the English opening batsmen with the minimum amount of effort\\".O'Reilly, p. 89. Lindwall then struck Edrich on the hand with a short ball, provoking angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Larwood. During this period, both Edrich and Compton found it difficult to position themselves quickly enough to play Lindwall.Fingleton, p. 132. The Australian paceman then hit Compton on the arm, and soon after, felled him with a bouncer that the batsman top-edged into his face. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 2/33.Pollard, p. 12. Upon hearing the umpire's call of no-ball while the ball was travelling towards him, and knowing he was immune from dismissal, Compton decided to change his stroke. Having initially positioned himself to deflect the ball into the leg side, he then attempted to hook the ball, but could not readjust quickly enough. The velocity of the ball was such that after rebounding from his head, it flew more than half-way to the boundary before landing. This was followed by a period of slow play as England tried to regroup.O'Reilly, p. 90.O'Reilly, p. 91. Lindwall returned to take the second new ball and trapped Jack Crapp, who did not offer a shot, for 37 to leave the score at 3/87. The batsman misjudged the line of a straight ball and thought it had pitched and struck his leg outside off stump.O'Reilly, p. 92. Lindwall later had Edrich gloving a rearing ball to the wicket-keeper to leave England at 5/119. Compton returned upon the fall of the fifth wicket to revive the innings and Lindwall ended with 4/99 after having Godfrey Evans caught behind from an expansive cut shot. England ended on 363 all out on the second day; Compton made an unbeaten 145. Lindwall had beaten Compton in each of his last three overs before lunch on the second day, but the Englishman survived to add more than 20 further runs.Fingleton, p. 135. On the third day, Lindwall came to the crease at 6/172 after Barnes--who had collapsed due to the aftereffects of being hit in the ribs from point blank range when fielding--had been forced to retire hurt. Australia faced the prospect of being forced to follow on, and Lindwall received five consecutive bouncers from Edrich, one of which hit him in the hand, evoking cheers from the home crowd. Lindwall made 23 as Australia struggled to 221 and avoided the follow on by eight runs; he was the last man to be dismissed. At the start of England's second innings, Washbrook took a single from Lindwall, who promptly removed Emmett for a duck. Lindwall pitched an outswinger on the line of off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket-keeper Tallon, who dived and took it in his right hand.Fingleton, p. 141. This brought Lindwall's tormentor Edrich to the crease. Bradman advised Lindwall not to bounce Edrich, fearing this would be interpreted as retaliation and generate negative media attention. However, Miller retaliated with four consecutive bouncers, angering the crowd.Perry (2005), p. 243. He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman and ordered him to stop;Perry (2005), p. 244. the Australian captain apologised to Edrich for the hostile bowling.Fingleton, p. 143. Lindwall bounced Washbrook and was no-balled by umpire Dai Davies for dragging his foot beyond the line. After a disagreement, Davies threw Lindwall his jumper, but the tension faded away and the paceman was not no-balled again after discussing the matter with Bradman.Fingleton, pp. 141–142. Lindwall bounced Washbrook again and this time the England opener went for the hook shot. The ball flew off the top edge in the air, straight towards Hassett at fine leg, who dropped the catch after juggling three times. Having received a reprieve on 21, Washbrook settled down and reached 50 in only 70 minutes with England at 1/80. Lindwall returned for a new spell late on the third day and almost hit Washbrook in the head.Fingleton, p. 142. Hassett again dropped Washbrook, who was on 78 when he again hooked Lindwall to long leg. The Australian vice-captain responded by borrowing a helmet from a nearby policeman to signify his need for protection from the ball, much to the amusement of the crowd.Fingleton, p. 144. Lindwall ended with 1/37 as England declared at their stumps score of 3/174 after the entire fourth day and the final morning was washed out. The match petered into a draw with Lindwall not required as Australia safely batted out the final day. Lindwall played in Australia's only match--against Middlesex--before the Fourth Test, but was not at his best. He and Miller had been partying heavily in the days before the match, and were out and binge drinking on the night before the match; they did not return until after dawn, when they were caught severely inebriated by Bradman at breakfast time. Miller was rested for the match, but Lindwall was selected for the match.Perry (2008), pp. 176-177. The home team won the toss and elected to bat, so Lindwall could not rest and sober up in the dressing room while the specialist batsmen were at work. He was asked to bowl a lengthy spell in warm and sunny conditions on the opening morning, and was at times lying on the ground in an attempt to recover during stoppages. Nevertheless, he ended with 1/28 from 16 overs, the opposition still unable to score heavily despite his obvious lethargy.Perry (2008), pp. 177-179. He took a total of 3/59 from 25 overs and scored one as the tourists won by an innings, removing the home team's captain George Mann twice and Edrich once. In the second innings, Lindwall took 2/31, but effectively had a third wicket. He bowled a bouncer at opener Jack Robertson, who tried to hook, but missed, suffered a fractured jaw and was forced to retire hurt, prompting angry shouting and booing from sections of the crowd. Robertson defended Lindwall, contending that the delivery was fair and that he had executed his shot incorrectly.Perry (2008), pp. 179-180.  Fourth Test  Hutton returned for the Fourth Test at Headingley and played effectively. At one stage he and Washbrook took five boundaries from six Lindwall overs.Arlott, p. 99. An opening partnership of 168 resulted until Lindwall bowled him for 81. The English opener went onto the front foot and was clean bowled, much to the dismay of the home crowd.Fingleton, p. 153. The stand came after Washbrook had decided to refrain from hooking Lindwall's bouncers, which had caused him problems in the earlier Tests. England did not lose their second wicket until the last over of the day, when Washbrook hit Johnston into Lindwall's hands for 143, leaving the total at 2/268. Both Fingleton and O'Reilly criticised the bowling group as a whole for what they deemed a very lethargic display; the former deemed it the worst day's performance since World War II and the latter accused all the Australian bowlers of operating \\"without object\\".Fingleton, p. 154.O’Reilly, p. 114. During the innings, Lindwall appealed for lbw four times while wicket-keeper Ron Saggers—standing in for the injured Tallon—remained silent, not supporting the appeal.Fingleton, p. 157. England ran up a large score of 496 but squandered a very strong position after losing their last 8 wickets for 73 runs; Lindwall had Compton caught down the leg side to give Saggers his first Test catch, leaving England at 6/473. Lindwall ended with 2/79 from 38 overs. Fingleton said \\"this grand fast bowler held the side together splendidly and answered every call\\".Fingleton, p. 158. O’Reilly said that until England collapsed--mostly due to unforced errors despite favourable conditionsO’Reilly, p. 121.--only Lindwall appeared capable of threatening the batsmen. He said the paceman \\"kept slogging away, tirelessly retaining his pace and enthusiasm long after the other members of the attack had lost all signs of hostility ... Bradman could not afford to spare him from doing much more than his share of the galley-slave work.\\"O’Reilly, p. 117. O’Reilly decried Lindwall's workload as excessive and potentially harmful to his longevity.O’Reilly, p. 118. In reply, Australia was still some way behind when Lindwall came in at 6/329 on the third afternoon. With the fall of Sam Loxton and Saggers in quick succession, Bradman's men were at 8/355 with only Johnston and Toshack remaining. Lindwall hit out, scoring 77 in an innings marked by powerful driving and pulling;Pollard, p. 14. he dominated in stands of 48 and 55 with Johnston and Toshack respectively. He particularly liked to use his feet to get to the ball on the half-volley to hit lofted drives.O’Reilly, p. 132. Of the 103 runs added for the last two wickets, the two tail-enders managed only 25 between them. Johnston accompanied Lindwall for 80 minutes, before the injured Toshack survived the last 50 minutes until stumps with Johnston running for him. Australia were 9/457 at stumps, with Lindwall on 76 and Toshack on 12.Fingleton, p. 167. During Lindwall's partnership with Johnston, Yardley bowled himself for over an hour, failing to bring on a frontline bowler in his stead despite being unable to dislodge the batsmen.O’Reilly, p. 128. Lindwall farmed the strike by trying to hit boundaries and twos during the over, but Yardley did not resort to the tactic of setting a deep field to yield a single to Lindwall to get the tailenders on strike. Despite Toshack and Johnston's lack of familiarity with having and acting as a runner respectively, and the resulting disorders in running between the wickets, Lindwall was able to manipulate the strike and face most of the balls.O’Reilly, p. 131. O’Reilly speculated that Yardley may have bowled himself in an attempt to contain the Australians rather than dismiss them before the close of play, so his openers would not have to bat for a short period before stumps when the visitors' attack could have made inroads. However, Yardley was neither able to contain Lindwall nor dismiss the Australians.O'Reilly, pp. 131-132. Sunday was a rest day, and on Monday,Fingleton, p. 168. the fourth morning, Lindwall was the last man out in the third over of the day, leaving Australia on 458, 38 runs in arrears on the first innings. Lindwall edged Bedser into the slips cordon and Crapp took the catch low down in his left hand. England made a strong start in their second innings—the openers registered their second century stand for the match. When Australia took the second new ball, Lindwall-- worried by the substantial and hazardous craters in the pitch he and the other bowlers had created while following through on the left-hand side of the creaseO'Reilly, p. 134.--changed to bowling from around the wicket and was warned for running on the pitch. He reverted to bowling from over the wicket, although he delivered from the edge of the crease to avoid the holes.Fingleton, p. 171. O’Reilly said the warning to Lindwall played into Australia's hands as the bowler's follow through from around the wicket was accentuating a rough patch outside the right-hander's off stump that the English bowlers target when Bradman's men had to chase the target.O’Reilly, p. 135. England reached 2/232 before Lindwall trapped Edrich to end a 103-run partnership. The paceman followed this by bowling Jack Crapp, who inside edged an attempted forcing stroke through the off side from the back foot onto his own stumps.Arlott, p. 114. This triggered a collapse of 4/33 from 3/260 to 7/293. Lindwall took 2/84 as the hosts declared on the final day at 8/365, leaving Australia to chase a world Test record of 404 for victory, with only 345 minutes available. Centuries to Bradman and Morris in a 301-run stand saw Australia seal the series 3–0 with a record-breaking seven-wicket win with 15 minutes in hand. The paceman was rested for the match against Derbyshire immediately after the Headingley Test, which Australia won by an innings. Lindwall returned for the match against Glamorgan and took 2/36 in a rain- affected draw that did not reach the second innings. In the next match against Warwickshire, he claimed 3/27 in the first innings, taking three consecutive middle-order wickets—including Test batsmen Tom Dollery and Abdul Hafeez Kardar—in the space of 12 balls as the hosts fell for 138.Perry (2008), p. 215. In reply, Australia stumbled to 6/161 when Lindwall joined Hassett. The pair put on 70 for the seventh wicket, the largest partnership in a low- scoring match. Lindwall ended with 45, the second highest score for the entire match, as Australia took a 116-run lead. He took the first wicket and ended with 1/32 as Bradman's men won by nine wickets. Australia proceeded to face Lancashire at Old Trafford for the second time during the season in a match that doubled as Washbrook's benefit. Lindwall made 17 in the tourists’ first innings of 321 and then dismissed the home side's first three batsmen, taking 3/32 as Lancashire fell for 130. Washbrook top-scored with 38 before Lindwall had him caught in the slips by Miller. He also collected several painful bruises from Lindwall on his right hand and thumb. Bradman described his leading paceman as being in \\"stupendous form ... I have not seen before or since such sustained brilliance from a pace bowler\\".Perry (2008), pp. 217-218. Australia made 3/265 declared in their second innings, leaving the hosts with a target of 457 in less than a day, with Washbrook unable to bat due to Lindwall's bruising bowling. Lindwall bowled both openers with the new ball, but Lancashire appeared to be safely batting out a draw at 5/191 with only eight minutes remaining. Lindwall returned after Bradman took the new ball, and told the slip cordon to move halfway back to the boundary. Bowling with a tailwind, Lindwall was at full pace, in one of the fastest displays Bradman had seen in his long career. He bowled Jack Ikin for 99 and Dick Pollard--who later claimed to have not seen the ball--for a golden duck. The hosts were in danger of suffering a late collapse and defeat, but William Roberts successfully defended the hat-trick ball; Lancashire lost no further wickets and were 7/191 when stumps were drawn; Lindwall ended with 4/27. He also caused Washbrook to miss the final Test with a thumb injury.Perry (2008), pp. 218-220. The paceman was rested from the non-first-class match against Durham, which was a rain-affected draw.  Fifth Test  According to Bradman, Fingleton and O'Reilly, Lindwall's performance in the final Test at The Oval was one of the best they had ever seen from any player.O'Reilly, p. 150. English skipper Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, surprising most observers.Fingleton, pp. 180–184. The damp conditions necessitated the addition of large amounts of sawdust to allow the players to keep their grip. Along with the rain, humidity assisted the bowlers, particularly Lindwall, who managed to make the ball bounce at variable heights. After Miller had taken an early wicket, Lindwall bounced Compton, resulting in an edge towards the slips cordon. However, the ball continued to rise and cleared the ring of Australian fielders. Hutton called Compton through for a run, but his surprised partner was watching the ball and dropped his bat in panic. Luckily for Compton, the ball went to Hassett at third man, who stopped the ball and waited for the batsman to regather his bat and his composure before returning the ball, thereby forfeiting the opportunity to effect a run out.Fingleton, p. 185. However, this gesture of sportsmanship cost Australia little, because when Compton was on three, Lindwall bowled another bouncer. Compton attempted a hook shot and Arthur Morris ran from his position at short square leg to take a difficult catch, leaving the hosts at 3/17. Fingleton described Morris's feat as \\"one of the catches of the season\\". After the lunch break, England struggled to 4/35, before Lindwall bowled Yardley with a swinging yorker. The debutant Allan Watkins then batted for 16 balls in an attempt to get off the mark with a series of failed hook shots. He missed an attempted hook shot and was hit in the shoulder by another Lindwall bouncer. Soon after, Watkins was dismissed without scoring after playing across the line and being trapped lbw by Johnston, leaving England at 6/42.Fingleton, p. 186. Watkins also collected a bruise on his right shoulder for his troubles with Lindwall; this inhibited his bowling later in the match. Following the departure of Watkins, Lindwall removed Godfrey Evans, Alec Bedser and Young, all yorked in the space of two runs. England fell from 6/45 to 9/47, bringing Hollies in at No. 11 to accompany Hutton, who had batted through the innings. Hutton then hit the only boundary of the innings, lofting a straight drive back over Lindwall's head. The ball almost went for six, landing just short of the fence. The home team's innings ended on 52 when Hutton—who never appeared to be troubled by the bowling—leg glanced Lindwall and was caught by wicket-keeper Don Tallon one-handed, at full stretch to his left. Lindwall described the catch as one of the best he had ever seen. In his post-lunch spell, Lindwall bowled a spell of 8.1 overs during which he took 5/8; he totalled 6/20 in 16.1 overs. Bradman described the spell as \\"the most devastating and one of the fastest I ever saw in Test cricket\\".Perry (2001), p. 225. Fingleton, who played against the Bodyline attack in 1932–33, said \\"I was watching a man almost the equal of Larwood [the Bodyline spearhead] in pace ... Truly a great bowler\\". O'Reilly said that Lindwall's \\"magnificent performance must go down as one of the greatest bowling efforts in Anglo- Australian Tests. He had two gruelingly long sessions in the innings and overcame each so well that he set the seal on his well-earned reputation as one of the best bowlers ever.\\" In Australia's reply, Lindwall came in at 6/304 and attacked immediately, scoring two fours before falling for nine. He played a cover drive from the bowling of Young, but hit the ball too early and thus launched it into the air, and it was caught by Edrich at cover point to leave the score at 7/332.Arlott, p. 130. The visitors ended on 389 and England started their second innings late on the second day. Debutant John Dewes took strike and got off the mark when he aimed a hook shot and was credited with a boundary when the ball came off his shoulder. Lindwall's steepling bouncer had risen over his bat and narrowly missed his head.O'Reilly, p. 154. Lindwall made the early breakthrough soon after, bowling Dewes—who offered no shotFingleton, p. 188.—for 10 to leave England at 1/20. Dewes often committed to playing the ball from the front foot before the bowler delivered the ball, thereby putting himself into difficulty.Fingleton, p. 199. Early on the third day, Lindwall bowled Edrich—who was playing across the line—for 28, hitting the off stump with a ball that cut inwards to leave England's score at 64,Fingleton, p. 189. before Compton and Hutton consolidated the innings and took the total to 2/121 at lunch. Soon after, with his score on 39, Compton aimed a hard cut shot that flew into Lindwall's left hand at second slip for a \\"freak slip catch\\" from Johnston's bowling; leaving England at 3/125. Lindwall returned for another spell after lunch and bowled Evans for eight. Evans appeared to not detect Lindwall's yorker in the fading light, and the umpires called off play due to poor visibility after an appeal by Yardley. The next morning, England were bowled out for 188, giving Australia an innings victory and the series 4–0. Lindwall took 3/50 to total 9/70 for the match. He ended the Tests as the leading wicket-taker with 27 wickets at 19.62, and scored 191 runs at 31.83.Perry (2001), p. 226.  Later tour matches  Seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat. Australia batted first against Kent and Lindwall made only one in a total of 361. The paceman took two wickets with the new ball to help reduce the hosts to 5/16, before they were all out for 51; Lindwall ended with 2/16. Forced to follow on, Kent were reduced to 4/37 by three early Lindwall wickets; the victims included Tony Pawson and former Test wicket-keeper Les Ames. The hosts were further hampered by the absence of opener Leslie Todd, who had been hit on the foot by a Lindwall swinging yorker in the first innings. The blow caused so much bruising that Todd's foot could not fit inside his cricket boots. Lindwall ended with 4/25 as Kent fell for 124 to lose by an innings. In his match total of 6/41 from 15 overs, Lindwall bowled four of his victims.Perry (2008), p. 249. The Kent fixture was followed by a match against the Gentlemen of England. Lindwall was not required to bat, and after taking 1/39 in the first innings, Bradman allowed him to rest as Australia enforced the follow on and completed an innings victory. Bradman rested Lindwall for the match against Somerset, which resulted in another innings victory for the tourists. The paceman returned against the South of England—a representative team—scoring an unbeaten 17 in an unbroken 61-run stand with Sam Loxton before Australia declared at 7/522. He then took 1/45 as rain ended the match at the conclusion of the hosts’ second innings. Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson Gower's XI. During the last Australian tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current Test players be allowed to represent the hosts. After the hosts had complied, the Australian skipper fielded a full-strength team.Perry (2005), pp. 253–254. In a rain- interrupted match, Lindwall bowled Hutton for a duck with the new ball. He returned and took five of the last six wickets to fall as the hosts lost their last six wickets for 57 runs. His last five victims were former England captain Walter Robins and Test players Freddie Brown, Evans, Bedser and Laker. Lindwall ended with 6/59; four of his wickets were bowled, while the other two were caught by Ian Johnson in the slips. He made five as Australia with 8/489 declared; time ran out in the rain-affected match with Leveson-Gower's XI at 0/75. The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against Scotland. Lindwall was rested from the first, which Australia won by an innings. In the second fixture, Lindwall signed off in a low key manner, scoring 15 and taking a total of 0/28 from 14 overs as Australia ended their campaign with another innings triumph.  Role  A chart showing Lindwall's batting performance during the tour. The runs scored per innings are represented by the bars, with the red bars being Test innings and the pink bars being other first-class innings. The blue line is the average of the five most recent innings and the dots indicate not outs. When fit, Lindwall opened the bowling with Miller in the Tests, and the pair operated in short and fiery bursts with the new ball. English cricket administrators had agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs in the Tests; at the time, the norm was to allow a new ball for every 200 runs scored, something which usually took longer than 55 overs. The new regulation played directly into the hands of the Australians, as a new ball is ideal for fast bowling and the tourists had a vastly superior pace attack. Bradman thus wanted to preserve his two first-choice pacemen for a vigorous attack on the English batsmen every 55 overs.Perry (2005), pp. 222–223. As a result, Lindwall bowled 224 overs, while Australia's third fast bowler Bill Johnston bowled 306. Lindwall led the Test bowling averages, with 27 wickets at 19.62, making him the equal leading wicket-taker along with Johnston, who averaged 23.33. The duo's haul of 27 Test wickets equalled the record for an Australian fast bowler during a tour of England. The Australian pair were substantially ahead the next most successful bowler, England's Alec Bedser, who took 18 wickets at 38.22. Lindwall's role as the leading strike bowler is borne out in his economy and strike rate in both the Tests and all first-class matches. He was the least economical of the three pacemen, but took his wickets more frequently than any other frontline bowler. In all first-class matches, he took 86 wickets at 15.68 and held onto 14 catches, fielding in the slips.Perry (2005), p. 256. There were many consecutive matches during the tour with no rest day in between, so Bradman ensured Miller and Lindwall remained fresh for the new ball bursts in the Tests by giving them a lighter workload during the tour matches. During all first-class matches, Johnston bowled 851.1 overs, Johnson 668, Lindwall 573.4, Toshack 502, while Miller bowled only 429.4 overs. Outside the Tests, Lindwall bowled 349.3 overs, only the fifth heaviest workload among the Australians in those matches. The local batsmen were unable to cope with Lindwalls high pace and swing; 43 of his wickets came after his opponent had missed the ball and been bowled. Lindwall scored 411 runs at 24.17 with two fifties in the first-class matches, including 191 at 31.83 in the Tests. Lindwall had limited batting opportunities, usually playing from No. 7 to No. 9. It was hard for Lindwall to get any higher up the order as Australia's other frontline bowlers, such as Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, all scored centuries and more than 20 fifties each during their first-class career, and were of similar batting ability.Cashman et al., pp. 152, 175, 199, 258. As Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings on many occasions due to their batting strength, Lindwall only had 20 innings in his 22 matches, and usually batted at numbers 7, 8 or 9.N- However, he was often effective when he did get an opportunity.Cashman et al., p. 175. Wisden recognised Lindwall by naming him as one of its five Cricketers of the Year in 1949. The publication cited the paceman's ability to seize the initiative for Australia in all but one of the Tests by taking early wickets. The fast bowler's success was attributed to a \\"superb control of length and direction, his change of pace and general skill, the like of which in a slower bowler could be classed as cunning\\". The ferocity of Lindwall's bouncer often prompted opponents to retreat onto the back foot before he had even released the ball. Wisden said that \\"by whatever standard he is judged ... [Lindwall] must be placed permanently in the gallery of great fast bowlers\\".

For substances to co-purify usually implies that these substances attract each other to form a non- covalent complex such as in a protein complex. However, when fractionating mixtures, especially mixtures containing large numbers of components (for example a cell lysate), it is possible by chance that some components may copurify even though they don't form complexes. In this context the term copurification is sometimes used to denote when two biochemical activities or some other property are isolated together after purification but it is not certain if the sample has been purified to homogeneity (i.e., contains only one molecular species or one molecular complex). Hence these activities or properties are likely but not guaranteed to reside on the same molecule or in the same molecular complex.

After her husband's arrest for his fraud, she and her husband attempted suicide in 2008. While she had $70 million in assets in her name, after her husband was sentenced she was stripped of all of her money other than $1–2 million, by the government and by the trustee for her husband's firm, Irving Picard. Early life Madoff was born in Queens, New York, to Saul (an accountant who died in 1999, at age 95) and Sara Alpern (died in 1996, at age 92), and raised in middle class Laurelton, Queens, in a practicing Jewish family. She has one sister, Joan Roman. A graduate of Far Rockaway High School and a 1961 graduate of Queens College with a degree in Psychology, she graduated from New York University with a Master of Science degree in nutrition in 1992.\\"The Trials of Ruth Madoff\\", People, February 21, 2011; retrieved April 14, 2011. Personal life On November 28, 1959, at age 18, she married Bernard \\"Bernie\\" Madoff, whom she had met while attending Far Rockaway High School. He was three years older than Ruth. Mark Madoff's Nantucket home They had two sons, Mark (March 11, 1964 – December 11, 2010), a 1986 graduate of the University of Michigan; and Andrew (April 8, 1966 – September 3, 2014), a 1988 graduate of University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. Both of her sons predeceased her: Mark, by suicide, in 2010, and Andrew, from lymphoma, in 2014. On the morning of December 11, 2010 — exactly two years after his father's arrest — Mark was found dead in his New York City apartment. The city medical examiner ruled the cause of death as suicide by hanging. She worked for some time as her husband's bookkeeper. A Vanity Fair article stated that, during the time when she was a bookkeeper, employees in the London office stated \\"Ruthie runs all the books\\". She was a director of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities.\\"For Ruth Madoff, New York Is the Loneliest Place,\\" The New York Times. Ruth stated during an interview that she and her husband were so upset after his financial fraud was exposed that they had attempted suicide together, with both taking \\"a bunch of pills\\" (Ambien, and perhaps Klonopin) in a suicide pact on Christmas Eve 2008, just after her husband had been arrested by federal authorities. Their suicide attempt was unsuccessful, however, and they woke up the following day. When Ruth Madoff's husband was sentenced in 2009, victim Marcia FitzMaurice said in a court statement: \\"Your wife, rightfully so, has been vilified and shunned by her friends in the community.\\" “How do you sleep with a man for all those years and don’t know what he is up to?” asked an Old Greenwich shopkeeper. After her husband was sent to prison, Ruth Madoff sought to avoid being recognized in public, even dying her hair red as she tried to avoid people recognizing who she was. Assets According to a March 13, 2009, filing by Madoff, he and his wife were worth up to $138 million, plus an estimated $700 million for the value of his business interest in Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC. Other major assets included securities ($45 million); cash ($17 million); half-interest in BLM Air Charter ($12 million); a 2006 Leopard yacht ($7 million); jewelry ($2.6 million); a Manhattan apartment ($7 million); a Montauk home ($3 million); a Palm Beach home ($11 million); a Cap d'Antibes, France, property ($1 million); furniture, household goods, and art ($9.9 million), and a restored 1969 Rybovich sportfishing yacht ($800,000). Since her husband’s incarceration, most of the Madoff family assets have been seized by the government, including the couple's Upper East Side penthouse in New York City. In June 2009, shortly before Bernie Madoff was sentenced, prosecutors reached an agreement allowing Ruth Madoff to keep $2.5 million, while taking and selling the Madoffs' other assets. The settlement, however, did not preclude others, such as the court-appointed trustee Irving Picard of BakerHostetler who was liquidating her husband's firm, from seeking to recover funds from her, for example as a wrongful transferee of funds transferred to her.\\"Will Ruth Madoff Keep Her Remaining $2.5 Million In Assets?\\" Bernie Madoff’s lawyer had asked the government to allow his wife to keep $70 million in assets that were in her name, as he forfeited all rights to assets totaling $170 million.\\"Ruth Madoff forfeits asset claims, left with $2.5 million,\\" Reuters. In May 2019, 77-year-old Ruth Madoff agreed to pay $594,000 ($250,000 in cash, and $344,000 of trusts for two of her grandchildren), and to surrender her remaining assets when she dies, to settle claims by the court- appointed trustee Picard liquidating her husband's firm for former customers. Picard had sued Ruth Madoff for $44.8 million, saying she had lived a \\"life of splendor\\" on the gains from the fraud committed by her husband, but settled for less, given her limited assets.\\"Trustee Sues Ruth Madoff for More Than $44 Million,\\" The Wall Street Journal. Picard said that the settlement was not evidence she knew of or participated in the fraud. She is required to provide reports to Picard about her expenditures often, as to any purchase over $100, to ensure she does not have any hidden bank accounts. Homes In 2012, Ruth Madoff moved to one of her son Andrew's houses in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, after spending two years living in Boca Raton, Florida, with her sister.

Both were small and short-lived, serving in Kentucky in 1862 and 1863. Army of August 1862 On August 25, 1862 Major General William \\"Bull\\" Nelson assumed command of the forces stationed around Richmond, Kentucky. Although the whole force was no more than two brigades, Nelson dubbed the force \\"Army of Kentucky\\". The two brigades were commanded by brigadier generals Mahlon D. Manson and Charles Cruft respectively. Merely five days after its creation, the army of mostly green soldiers went into action at the Battle of Richmond and was soundly defeated. The army lost over 800 killed and 4,000 prisoners. Because of the large number of prisoners (including Manson) and the wounding of Nelson, the Army of Kentucky virtually ceased to exist. Cruft officially remained in command of the 2nd Brigade until September but the majority of his brigade had been captured while the rest simply marched back to New Albany, Indiana. Captain Charles C. Gilbert was appointed acting major general and placed in command of the remnants of the Army. In September 1862 General Don Carlos Buell absorbed the remnants into the III Corps of the Army of the Ohio. Army of October 1862 On October 7, 1862 Major General Gordon Granger revived the name \\"Army of Kentucky\\". It was originally composed of three divisions commanded respectively by generals Andrew J. Smith, Quincy A. Gilmore, and Absalom Baird.Official Records This form of the army was unusual in the fact that on January 20, it was attached to the larger Army of the Cumberland. Baird's division fought at the Battle of Thompson's Station in March 1863 and nearly one entire brigade was captured there. In April, 1863 the army was composed of two divisions of infantry under Charles C.

Adkins (born October 9, 1965) is a former Republican member of the Florida House of Representatives, representing the 11th District, which includes Nassau County and eastern Duval County, since 2012, previously representing the 12th District from 2008 to 2012. History Adkins was born in Jacksonville, and attended Trinity Christian Academy, where she graduated as valedictorian in 1983. Following this, she attended Florida State College at Jacksonville, where she received an associate degree in 1985, and the University of North Florida, receiving a bachelor degree in computer information science in 1987 and a Master of Business Administration in 1990. Adkins then worked for Information Systems of Florida as an information technology specialist, eventually becoming a client partner at the firm. She was elected to the Nassau County School Board in 1998, and served there until she ran for the legislature in 2008. Florida House of Representatives When incumbent State Representative Aaron Bean was unable to seek re-election in 2008, Adkins ran to succeed him in District 12, which included Baker County, Nassau County, Union County, and parts of Bradford County, Clay County, and Duval County. She won the Republican primary against Bobby Hart comfortably with 59% of the vote, and was unopposed in the general election. Adkins was re-elected entirely uncontested in 2010, as well. Following the reconfiguration of districts in 2012, Adkins was moved into the 11th District, which contained her home in Nassau County, and gave up its reach into the Florida Panhandle in exchange for a large section of Duval County, stretching south to Jacksonville Beach. In the Republican primary, she was opposed by attorney Cord Byrd. Adkins criticized her opponent for being a \\"personal injury attorney who sues small businesses,\\" and disagreed with him over state funding for the St. Johns River Ferry, which she supported. She received the endorsement of former Governor Jeb Bush, who praised her as \\"a state representative who has made improving education for Florida's students a priority.\\" The contest between the two was not close, and Adkins won her party's renomination with 65% of the vote. In the general election, she faced Democratic nominee Dave Smith and a write-in candidate. Owing to the district's strong partisan lean, Adkins overwhelmingly won re-election over Smith, winning 72% of the vote. In 2016, Adkins co-sponsored HB 1411, which increased state regulation on abortion and abortion-related services. It passed in a majority-Republican state legislature and was signed into law by Governor Rick Scott on March 25, 2016. On June 2, 2016, Planned Parenthood filed a complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of Florida against the State of Florida, and alleged that the law was unconstitutional.https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/files/4414/6490/2653/20160602-PP- Complaint.pdf ReferencesExternal links *Florida House of Representatives - Janet H.

Description Bromus carinatus is a perennial bunchgrass growing in clumps 0.5 to 1.5 meters tall, with many narrow leaves up to 40 centimeters long. The inflorescence is a spreading or drooping array of flat spikelets longer than they are wide. The grass is wind- pollinated but is also sometimes cleistogamous, so that the flowers pollinate themselves, especially under stressful conditions. It also reproduces vegetatively via tillers. This species is highly variable. It can be easily confused with B. catharticus and B. stamineus.

They are located in Kensington, Battersea, Clapham and Fulham, as well as a kindergarten in Battersea.School Locations They are a family-run establishment, and have come to be seen as a feeder for major British public schools such as Eton, Harrow, Marlborough, Westminster, Alleyn's School, City of London, Dulwich, Radley, and King's College School.The Independent - Join the Queue http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20020406/ai_n12621083/pg_2 Notable students Current: * Princess Charlotte of Cambridge * Prince George of Cambridge * Miss Maud Windsor Former: * Cara Delevingne * Florence Welch History Thomas's was founded in 1971 when Joanna Thomas, an actress and mother of three young children, started the Ranelagh Kindergarten in a Pimlico church hall (now Thomas's Kindergarten, Pimlico). Six years later, the success of the Kindergarten and the strong demand for London day schools of quality encouraged David Thomas, a former Gurkha Regiment Officer, to join his wife in founding a school for older children. Following the acquisition of a building in Cadogan Gardens in 1977, the \\"Kensington Court Lower School\\" came into being with two teachers and eleven pupils. In less than four years the school, now named \\"Thomas's\\", had over two hundred children. Demand for places continued to increase and, in response to this, Thomas's expanded in 1981 into two buildings in Cottesmore Gardens, just south of Kensington Gardens, to create Thomas's, Kensington. By the end of 1989 the Preparatory School at Cadogan Gardens needed more space and in August 1990 the freehold was acquired of the former Sir Walter St John's Grammar School in Battersea. The school, which became Thomas's, Battersea, moved to its extensive new premises in October 1990 and the leasehold buildings in Cadogan Gardens were sold. In September 1992 Thomas's Kindergarten, Battersea was started in the crypt of St Mary's Church. At the end of 1992, with an increasing demand for places, the freehold was secured of the magnificent former Walsingham School, previously Clapham County Girls' School, in Broomwood Road and the new Thomas's, Clapham opened in September 1993. In September 1995, David and Joanna Thomas's two sons, Tobyn and Ben, were appointed Principals, having worked in the schools for a number of years. In June 1998, a charitable foundation was formed. The aims of the charity, Thomas's Schools Foundation, are to assist certain parents financially with the education of their children and to run local community projects. In 1999, David and Joanna Thomas retired from active management of the schools, which are now run by Tobyn and Ben. Ben is also Headmaster of Thomas's, Battersea. In 2000 and 2001, a £4m construction programme was carried out to enhance the facilities at Thomas's, Clapham and Thomas's, Battersea. In 2002, an opportunity arose to improve Thomas's, Kensington through the acquisition of a nearby school, Lady Eden's. Lady Eden's was closed in Summer 2002 and its buildings converted to become the Lower School of Thomas's, Kensington. The existing buildings in Cottesmore Gardens were extensively refurbished and now house the Preparatory School. The premises of Thomas's, Kensington are freehold. In 2004, Thomas's acquired a long lease on the buildings formerly owned by the London Institute for the Chelsea College of Art and Design in Hugon Road, SW6. The school, which overlooks South Park, was built from 1892 and was opened on 29 October 1894 in order to educate 1,200 children. The buildings have and are set on a site. A£1.3m refurbishment programme by the landlords commenced in January 2005 and Thomas's, Fulham opened in September 2005 as a co-educational preparatory school for children from 4 to 11 years old.

Iraqi Bar Association  In October 2005, in his role as a \\"senior official\\" in the Iraqi Bar Association, al-Saadi criticised the assassination of Saadoun Sughaiyer al-Janabi, a lawyer participating in the defence of one of Saddam Hussein's co-accused, stating \\"This will have grave repercussions. This will hinder lawyers from defending those held for political reasons.\\" In March 2006, in his role as chairman of the Iraqi Bar Association, al-Saadi criticised the Iraqi government's dismissal of the association's council, arguing that the council had been created as the result of \\"free and fair elections\\". He said that the association included members of \\"divergent political factions and groups\\" and should \\"remain a symbol of Iraq's unity\\" rather than being \\"politicized\\".

Al-Baghdadia organised a team of lawyers headed by al-Saadi to provide al-Zaidi's legal defence. On December 21, al-Saadi contacted Agence France Presse about his client's case. He said that al-Zaidi had filed a complaint against the security forces who allegedly assaulted him during the hours following his arrest and that medical evidence established the nature of al- Zaidi's injuries. On December 22, al-Saadi stated that al-Zaidi is accused of \\"aggression against a foreign head of state during an official visit\\", for which the penalty is between 5 and 15 years' imprisonment.

Early life and family Anthony was born on 11 December 1960. He was from Trincomalee in eastern Ceylon and a Roman Catholic. He was educated at Sri Koneswara Hindu College in Trincomalee. He is said to have participated in the burning of the Sri Lankan flag when it was hoisted at the school on republic day in 1972. LTTE Anthony was one of the founding members of the militant Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). He took on the nom de guerre \\"Seelan\\". Seelan was a close friend and confidante of LTTE leader V. Prabhakaran. Whilst Prabhakaran was India, Seelan, together with Mahattaya and Ragu, were in charge of the LTTE in Sri Lanka. Later Seelan served as military chief of the LTTE. Seelan is credited with transforming the LTTE into the leading Tamil militant group. The first attack on the army by Tamil militants took place on 15 October 1981 when the LTTE ambushed an army jeep the KKS Road in Jaffna and Seelan shot dead two soldiers (H. G. W. Hewawasam and H. M. P. Thisera). Seelan is also believed to have been responsible for the shooting dead of Sivashanmugamoorthy (alias Sundaram), deputy leader of People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam and editor of the Puthiya Pathai (New Way) magazine, at the Chitra Press in Jaffna on 2 January 1982. On 27 October 1982 Seelan led a group LTTE cadres (Aruna, Bashir Kaka Mahattaya, Pulendran, Raghu, Santhosam and Shankar) who attacked the police station in Chavakachcheri, killing three police officers (Kandiah, Karunanandan and Tilakaratne) and stealing a large amount of arms and ammunition. Seelan was seriously wounded after being shot in the knee. He was driven to the house of University of Jaffna lecturer M. Niththyanandan and his wife Nirmala in Jaffna for medical treatment. He was then moved to Tamil Nadu for further medical treatment and didn't return to Sri Lanka until February 1983. Niththyanandan and Nirmala were arrested on 18 November 1982. On 6 July 1983 a group of LTTE cadres, including Seelan and Sellakili (Sathasivam Chelvanayakam), stole five exploders from Kankesanthurai Cement Factory. Brigadier J. G. Balthazar, the commander of the Sri Lankan security forces in the north, received a tip-off from a police officer on 15 July 1983 that Seelan, the most wanted Tamil militant after Prabhakaran, was operating from a house in a coconut grove at Meesalai near Chavakachcheri. As the army arrived at the house that evening, Seelan and three other LTTE cadres (Anand, Aruna and Ganesh) fled on bicycles. As the soldiers pursued the LTTE cadres and opened fire, Seelan, who was handicapped by the injuries sustained at Chavakachcheri police station, abandoned his bicycle and ran through a paddy field. The soldiers continued the pursuit and kept firing, killing Anand and injuring Seelan in the knee. As Aruna went to help Seelan, who was struggling to keep up, Seelan asked Aruna to shoot him and escape. Aruna protested but Seelan ordered him to shoot. Aruna placed the barrel of his rifle on Seelan's forehead and shot him dead before escaping in a hijacked car. The LTTE ambush on the army on 23 July 1983 which killed 15 soldiers and several LTTE members is believed to have been revenge for Seelan's death. The Charles Anthony Brigade was named after Seelan. Prabhakaran's eldest son Charles Anthony was also named after Seelan. A memorial to Seelan and a children's park named after Seelan were built at Meesalai-Allarai. After the Sri Lankan military re- captured the Thenmarachchi region in 1995 they destroyed the memorial and children's park. The memorial was re-built in 2003 during the Norwegian mediated Cease Fire Agreement.

The blue-colored node in κ(G) corresponds to the zero-vertex clique in G (the empty set), and the magenta node corresponds to the 3-vertex clique. In graph theory, a branch of mathematics, the simplex graph κ(G) of an undirected graph G is itself a graph, with one node for each clique (a set of mutually adjacent vertices) in G. Two nodes of κ(G) are linked by an edge whenever the corresponding two cliques differ in the presence or absence of a single vertex. The empty set is included as one of the cliques of G that are used to form the clique graph, as is every set of one vertex and every set of two adjacent vertices. Therefore, the simplex graph contains within it a subdivision of G itself. The simplex graph of a complete graph is a hypercube graph, and the simplex graph of a cycle graph of length four or more is a gear graph. The simplex graph of the complement graph of a path graph is a Fibonacci cube. The complete subgraphs of G can be given the structure of a median algebra: the median of three cliques A, B, and C is formed by the vertices that belong to a majority of the three cliques., page 200. Any two vertices belonging to this median set must both belong to at least one of A, B, or C, and therefore must be linked by an edge, so the median of three cliques is itself a clique. The simplex graph is the median graph corresponding to this median algebra structure. When G is the complement graph of a bipartite graph, the cliques of G can be given a stronger structure as a distributive lattice,. and in this case the simplex graph is the graph of the lattice. As is true for median graphs more generally, every simplex graph is itself bipartite. The simplex graph has one vertex for every simplex in the clique complex X(G) of G, and two vertices are linked by an edge when one of the two corresponding simplexes is a facet of the other. Thus, the objects (vertices in the simplex graph, simplexes in X(G)) and relations between objects (edges in the simplex graph, inclusion relations between simplexes in X(G)) are in one-to-one correspondence between X(G) and κ(G). Simplex graphs were introduced by , credit the introduction of simplex graphs to a later paper, also by Bandelt and van de Vel, but this appears to be a mistake. who observed that a simplex graph has no cubes if and only if the underlying graph is triangle-free, and showed that the chromatic number of the underlying graph equals the minimum number n such that the simplex graph can be isometrically embedded into a Cartesian product of n trees. As a consequence of the existence of triangle-free graphs with high chromatic number, they showed that there exist two-dimensional topological median algebras that cannot be embedded into products of finitely many real trees. also use simplex graphs as part of their proof that testing whether a graph is triangle-free or whether it is a median graph may be performed equally quickly.

It is typically, though not exclusively, experienced as a secondary symptom of sensorineural hearing loss, although not all patients with sensorineural hearing loss experience diplacusis or tinnitus. The onset is usually spontaneous and can occur following an acoustic trauma, for example an explosive noise, or in the presence of an ear infection. Sufferers may experience the effect permanently, or it may resolve on its own. Diplacusis can be particularly disruptive to individuals working within fields requiring acute audition, such as musicians, sound engineers or performing artists. Diplacusis of pure tones The term diplacusis has been used in cases which people with unilateral cochlear hearing losses or asymmetrical hearing losses, the same tone presented alternately to the two ears may be perceived as having different pitches in the two ears. The magnitude of the shift can be measured by getting the subject to adjust the frequency of a tone in one ear until its pitch matches that of the tone in the other ear. On presentation of a single tone alternating between ears (i.e. 1000 Hz left, 1000 Hz right, 1000 Hz left, ...), a given person will consistently mismatch these sinusoids the same amount between trials if doing a pitch-matching task. For example, a 1000 Hz tone in an unaffected ear may be heard as a slightly different pitch in the opposite ear, or have an imperfect tonal quality in the affected ear. Biological explanation via theories of pitch of pure tones There are two theories on the cause of diplacusis: place theory and temporal theory. Place theory posits that the cause is looking for the edge of the wave for the pitch and could explain diplacusis as a small differences between the two cochleas. Temporal theory posits that the cause is from looking at the phase locking to tell what the pitch is. This theory has a difficult time explaining diplacusis. There are some examples of pitch which do not have an \\"edge\\" on the basilar membrane, which this would account for—e.g., white noise, clicks, etc. Both theories are under debate. Effects of sensorineural hearing loss Normal human ears can discriminate between two frequencies that differ by as little as 0.2%. If one ear has normal thresholds while the other has sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), diplacusis may be present, as much as 15–20% (for example 200 Hz one ear => 240 Hz in the other). The pitch may be difficult to match because the SNHL ear hears the sound \\"fuzzy\\". Bilateral SNHL gives less diplacusis, but pitch distortions may persist. This may cause problems with music and speech understanding.  Treatment  Treatment of diplacusis includes a full medical and audiological examination that may explain the nature of the problem. If needed, amplification may relieve the symptoms of diplacusis. Therapy in helping the patient understand the cause of the symptom and tinnitus retraining may provide some relief. In at least some cases, amplification makes no difference and there is no treatment other than waiting for natural resolution. Some individuals may find the provided amplification also increases the audibility of their pitch discrepancy. If onset is linked to an underlying medical cause, i.e. sudden sensorineural hearing loss, appropriate medical treatment is recommended.  Etymology  Diplacusis is from the Greek words \\"diplous\\" (double) and \\"akousis\\" (hearing).

For television syndication, a 10-minute sequence was added, bringing the film's running time to 80 minutes. Plot The film opens with a parody credit of “R.I. Diculous Presents\\". Private Philbrick and Private Penn are stuck in monotonous assignments at Fort Nicholson, a U.S. Army base near the Nicholson Mesa. The privates are assigned to a scouting mission that requires the inspection of a newly discovered cavern that was located near the base. Philbrick and Penn are part of an expeditionary squad, but become separated from their fellow soldiers. The privates are attacked by seven-foot- tall vegetable-like creatures that take them into the cavern, which is actually an alien base commanded by two statuesque women from the planet Kalar. The alien women, Dr. Puna and Professor Tanga, reveal that they arrived on Earth with the goal of conquering the planet. Philbrick and Penn find that their fellow soldiers have been placed in suspended animation by the aliens. Philbrick eventually discovers that kissing Puna leaves her temporarily powerless, allowing him and Penn to escape from the cavern and its inhabitants. After an encounter with an American Indian band, the two soldiers race back to their base to rally a defense of the Earth against the Kalar aliens. They succeed in saving the Earth by prematurely launching the alien spaceship, but are captured by the aliens. However, Puna convinces Tanga not to kill them as they have no way of returning home now and they need to rely on the two soldiers. Tanga accepts this, kisses Penn and the sparks fly.

Haze was to star in the film, but he ultimately did not appear in the production.“Invasion of the Star Creatures,” Turner Classic MoviesMark McGee, Faster and Furiouser: The Revised and Fattened Fable of American International Pictures, McFarland, 1996 p161 Director Bruno VeSota was best known for B-level features including Female Jungle (1955) and The Brain Eaters (1958).“Biography for Bruno VeSota,” Turner Classic Movies The film opens with a parody credit of “R.I. Diculous Presents\\". The film's cavern and desert scenes were shot in Bronson Canyon, a section of Griffith Park in Los Angeles, California, often used in film and television productions. Reception Invasion of the Star Creatures has never been well reviewed by critics. When it first opened, the film trade magazine Box Office opined: “What a lot of baloney! Such a waste of time, film and effort. The title was good, but was it a spooky film? Nope! A comedy!! Closed the first night”. Film historian Bill Warren, in his 1996 book Keep Watching the Skies!, Vol. 2, called the film \\"astonishingly bad ... so helplessly bad that it's almost unwatchable\\". In 1979, the film was cited by Harry and Michael Medved in their book The Golden Turkey Awards, a tribute to bad films. Invasion of the Star Creatures was nominated in the category for “The Worst Vegetable Movie of All Time”, with the authors noting the monsters controlled by the Kalar aliens were played by actors wearing carrot costumes. The Medveds also faulted an egregious comic line by Bob Ball – when given a back flip by one of the carrot monsters, Ball remarked: “Wow, that’s the first time a salad ever tossed me”!

Other types in 1865–1959 were city (in Finnish kaupunki) and market town (in Finnish kauppala), in 1960–1976 old city (in Finnish vanha kaupunki), new city (in Finnish uusi kaupunki) and market town. Maalaiskunta was the most common type of municipality. In the 1977 reform, all municipalities were given fully equal legal standing. Previous maalaiskuntas associated with a city retained their name. For example, Rovaniemen maalaiskunta (\\"the rural municipality of Rovaniemi) surrounded the city of Rovaniemi, but were independently governed. From 2009, no municipalities will carry this name any more, after the merger of Jyväskylä and Jyväskylän mlk. Rural municipalities were legally independent from the cities carrying the same name. However, in some cases, particularly when the city was in the geographic center of the municipality, rural municipalities have placed their offices in the city, on the territory of a different municipality. Rural municipalities have also changed their names to create an identity distinct from the city. For example, Vantaa was previously known as Helsingin maalaiskunta, as it was the historical center of Helsinki (location of the Helsinki church village). In addition, in 1926 Lohja was split into Lohjan maalaiskunta, which was known as Lohjan kunta after 1977, and Lohjan kauppala (later Lohjan kaupunki), but the two merged again in 1997.
