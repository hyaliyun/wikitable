Pavan was also the Study Leader for the ground breaking TEEB (The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity) study commissioned by G8+5 and hosted by UNEP. Under his leadership, TEEB sized the global problem of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation in economic and human welfare terms, and proposed solutions targeted at policy-makers, administrators, businesses and citizens. TEEB presented its widely acclaimed Final Report suite at the UN meeting by Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in Nagoya ( Nagoya Protocol), Japan. He is the Founder-CEO of GIST Advisory, a specialist consulting firm which helps governments and corporations discover, measure, value, and manage their impacts on natural and human capital. In recognition of his continuing work in helping governments and corporations transition towards a Green Economy, UNEP appointed Pavan as the UNEP Goodwill Ambassador in the year 2012.

Green Accounting for Indian States Project  Pavan is the Founder-Director of the Green Accounting for Indian States Project, an initiative of the Green Indian States Trust (GIST) to set up an economic valuation and national accounting framework to measure sustainability at the State level for India, including the hitherto ignored but significant economic externalities from sectors such as forestry, agriculture, fresh water, health, and education.  Conservation Action Trust  Pavan is the Co-founder and Chairperson for the first six years of Conservation Action Trust, an Indian NGO dedicated to achieving ecological sustainability for India by originating and proving model conservation projects, by educating and lobbying decision-makers and the public about the importance of forests for our water and food security, and when all else fails, through public interest litigation.  The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity  Pavan was appointed by Germany's Environment Minister Gabriel and EU Environment Commissioner Dimas as the Study Leader for their G8+5 study on The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB). TEEB's Interim Report (2008), was welcomed globally for its fresh economic outlook, for demonstrating the economic significance of the loss of nature's services, and for connecting the economics of biodiversity and ecosystems with ethics, equity, and the alleviation of poverty. The Interim Report of TEEB was presented at the Ministerial session at COP-9 of the Convention of Biological Diversity (Bonn,2008) and the final reports (a series of five solution- oriented studies) were presented at CBD Cop-10 (Nagoya, 2010). These reports have gained considerable currency with governments in both developing and developed nations, with business leaders, and with conservation NGO's. Later, in 2011, as part of his activities as the McCluskey Fellow, 2011, Pavan designed and delivered a 25-lecture, full 3-credits, post-graduate course on TEEB at Yale's School of Forestry & Environmental Studies.

He speaks at the Forum's annual meetings at Davos. Corporation 2020 Pavan launched a global campaign called \\"Corporation 2020\\" at the Rio+20 conference in 2012. This campaign focusses global attention on the challenge of re-designing the Corporation through critical changes in four key areas of corporate performance (reporting, leverage, advertising, and taxation) to deliver a ‚Äògreen economy' from the micro-level upwards in order to achieve the goals of sustainable development. 2017 President of World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) International From 2017 he is president of the World Wide Fund for Nature and succeeded Yolanda Kakabadse in this position.

The station adjoins Goongarrie National Park, which was also once a station that was taken up in 1924 but that was never fully developed as it was too difficult to establish watering points. Adelong is currently owned and managed by the Menzies Aboriginal Corporation. Adelong is operating under the Crown Lease number CL186-1969 and has the Land Act number LA3114/801. Lake Ballard is on the northern boundary of the station. The property has a mix of Mulga, saltbush and bluebush as well as native grasses suitable for feed. The Adelong Dunes, a stable and vegetated dune system, lie to the south of the station. The station occupied an area of in 1929 and had five wells, each with its own windmill attached.

DGH's stated mission is \\"To improve health and foster other human rights with those most in need by accompanying communities, while educating and inspiring others to action.\\" The work of this organization is guided by a series of core values outlined in the DGH Principles of Action document. History =The El Salvador Civil War= From 1979 to 1992, widespread violence swept over El Salvador, immersed at the time in a brutal civil war. The decade-long war produced devastating effects throughout the country, during which countless violations of human rights were perpetuated, with more than 75,000 people killed, and many others disappeared or forced into exile. The civilian population of many guerrilla-controlled areas were assumed the enemy and suffered brutal war crimes, murders, killings and disappearances. One of these war-torn areas was the department of Moraz√°n in northeastern El Salvador. It was in this isolated region that, in the aftermath of the war, several medical volunteers with Medecins du Monde were accompanying local communities, working on a \\"Health as Reconciliation project\\", rebuilding lives and working with health promoters. The community work inspired a new discipline called Liberation Medicine, and resulted in the creation of the Salvadoran association Campesinos para el Desarrollo Humano (Peasants for Human Development). Dr. Lanny Smith was among the group of volunteers accompanying these communities who concluded that a new organization was needed to attend to the needs of these people in their struggle to implement primary health care and public health services. In July 1995, DGH was founded and incorporated in Georgia as a 501(C)3 tax-exempt charitable organization. The foundation of DGH was underpinned by a philosophy that stressed the promotion of health and human rights around the globe. Overview Hundreds of people of varied backgrounds and areas of expertise have assisted with the work of DGH both at home and abroad, including health workers, teachers, artists, students, and many others. Today, with a global membership of over 5000 people, DGH offers many opportunities for people to participate in its mission to improve health and social justice around the world, both locally and internationally. =Organizational Structure= DGH is an all-volunteer 501(c)3 NGO founded in 1995 and based in Atlanta, Georgia. There is no office or paid staff in the US; phone, fax, and travel expenses to volunteer overseas, attend board meetings and the Annual DGH General Assembly are all donated. Board members and members from around the world carry out the work of the organization, both domestically (e.g. through committee work) and internationally. The board of directors, international volunteers, and general membership include health providers (doctors, nurses, physical and occupational therapists, paramedics, and students in these disciplines), teachers, psychologists, engineers, artists, lawyers, and dedicated people from all walks of life. Anyone who agrees with and affirms DGH's mission and principles can become a member. There is no membership fee. A DGH member who has been actively involved in the organization for at least a year, upon approval by the board, can become a voting member. DGH has a very active 18-member board and up to three board alternates who are elected by the DGH voting membership to serve 3-year terms. Six board members are elected each year to provide continuity while allowing new board members to be elected. Board members convene biannual board meetings in addition to monthly conference calls. =Funding= As a registered charity, DGH mainly receives funds from individual donors who support its mission and goals. DGH is also supported by private foundations. DGH follows specific guidelines regarding foundation and corporate support that reflect the DGH principles of action, which state that 'DGH is vigilant to ensure that its projects, programs, affiliations, and fund raising efforts don't involve even subtle compromise of its values.' DGH does not seek any government funds and does not allow more than thirty percent of funding to come from any one source. Board members and international volunteers pay all of their own expenses, including airfare, room and board. This allows 92 percent of DGH funds to go directly to its program activities. Organizational philosophy =Principles of Action= DGH has its own principles of action, which outline the basics of the organization's values, among these 10 principles are references to the use of artistic expression within the organization's work and commitments towards advocacy and social justice. Guided by these principles, DGH works locally and internationally at the synergy of health, human rights, education and art > What's unique about our work and philosophy is the combined emphasis on > health and human rights and our commitment to long-term accompaniment of the > communities we support. We only work where we are invited and we try our > best to 'accompany' communities and support them in pursuing the goal of > better health without imposing our own views of how to achieve the goals. =Liberation Medicine= DGH defends an inextricable link between health and human rights through the practice of \\"liberation medicine\\", defined as \\"The conscious, conscientious use of health to promote human dignity and social justice.\\" DGH uses liberation medicine as a means to seek ways for making a concrete, positive difference in people's lives by accompanying them in the process of attaining their own freedom and life-improvement, not 'liberating' them. The distinction between liberation and development is important to the work of DGH. Development has acquired a negative connotation in recent years because it usually implies a connection to groups that are closely tied to organizations and governments that control the world economy. DGH employs liberation medicine so that the poor can decide what they need and are empowered to explore different ways of achieving their goals. Once the poor are empowered, true development and liberation for health and healing can occur. By using studied action, DGH seeks ways for making a concrete, positive difference in people's lives by accompanying them in the process of attaining their own freedom and life-improvement, not 'liberating' them. Central to the concept of Liberation Medicine is the act of community accompaniment and treating people with respect. Members of the DGH community have been instrumental in presenting the ideals of Liberation Medicine at many venues. For example, DGH members conducted the first comprehensive Liberation Medicine Workshop at the American Public Health Association (APHA) Annual Conference in 1999. DGH has organized workshops and presentations on Liberation Medicine at subsequent APHA conferences, as well as at many other meetings and universities around the world. =Community Accompaniment= DGH works with marginalized populations through community accompaniment. According to DGH, this term implies \\"being invited rather than arriving without prior community knowledge or approval, as well as a participatory process with the community rather than imposing our way of thinking or doing things.\\" DGH only works in areas where it has received a written invitation by the local population, who determine their own priorities. The combination of capacity-building and friendship-building of volunteers is an essential component of the organization, which can be differentiated by the work of other organizations in that it seeks to build long-term solutions with communities where DGH is invited to work. =Advocacy= DGH works with its global partners and other organizations to bear witness for human rights and against human rights violations. Advocacy work is carried out through various means including educational articles, position statements, and activism. As stated on the official organization webpage, DGH prioritizes its work to focus on the following: * Human rights violations and local policies that negatively influence or affect the communities that we accompany; * Universal health care access. We join in solidarity with groups with which we are affiliated and support and encourage the advocacy work of the People's Health Movement to promote the right to health care for all in our own country and abroad; * Highlight the human and other costs of wars, and gross human rights violations by the United States; * Immigration issues nationally and internationally. The DGH Human Rights and Advocacy Committee leads an ongoing series of campaigns on these and other topics. Recently, DGH has joined in letters of solidarity and action items for death threats and assassinations of community activists in El Salvador. DGH supports the DREAM Act and other immigrants' rights issues, supports the work of SOA Watch, Office of the Americas and others in the peace movement, and believes healthcare is a human right for all. DGH strongly supports the Occupy Wall Street Movement, and its members are involved in Occupy Public Health. Projects and worldwide activities =Morazan, El Salvador= DGH was born out of work that began in the communities of La Estancia, El Salvador in the mid 1990s. This remote mountainous area was heavily affected by loss and destruction during the country's twelve-year civil war. In 2001, members of the community joined together to form La Asociaci√≥n de Campesinos para el Desarrollo Humano (Peasants for Human Development, C.D.H.), which was officially recognized as a Salvadoran nonprofit organization in August 2004. Today, DGH supports C.D.H. as it runs the local community health center and six early childhood development centers as well as broader community health and development projects. =Santa Marta, El Salvador= Santa Marta is a rural community in the Department of Caba√±as. DGH supports the work of the Community Rehabilitation Center, currently managed by two community health promoters. The Center has evolved since the 1990s to provide a wide array of services including physical therapy and other body work techniques, specifically developed to address the needs of war wounded, injured, and people suffering from chronic muskuloskeletal conditions. DGH has consistently provided volunteer medical students and other health care providers to work alongside Salvadoran physicians, health promoters, and other staff at the Ministry of Health Clinic. Additionally, DGH also raises funds for COCOSI (COmite COntra SIda), a youth led organization which uses theater and role playing to educate their peers and adults on the risk of HIV and sexually transmitted disease, together with gender related issues. Recently, COCOSI received international recognition for their work when they were awarded the 2010 Red Ribbon Award as a group demonstrating outstanding community leadership and action in reducing the spread and impact of AIDS. =Chiapas, Mexico= DGH has been present in Chiapas since receiving an invitation by the local community in 1996. Here, DGH works with 6 of the Zapatista autonomous municipalities. The work consists of teaching health promoters and conducting public health work, together with an in-country coordinator: Dr. Juan Manuel Canales. The 2006 Jonathan Mann Award for Health and Human Rights was recently awarded to Dr Canales for his lifelong dedication to building community health services and speaking out against the violations of human rights among marginalized and excluded communities. =Uganda= DGH has been involved in Southwest Uganda since 1999, when it partnered with the Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST), one of only 2 Ugandan medical schools at that time. Today, the DGH collaboration currently sponsors a range of initiatives, including nursing and village health worker programs as well as cervical cancer screening, psychiatry and disability initiatives. =Guatemala= In the fall of 2007, DGH was approached by a Guatemalan NGO, Primeros Pasos. Working in Quetzaltenango, Primeros Pasos provides comprehensive health care services to the poor indigenous community in the Palajunoj valley nearby. DGH directs qualified interested volunteers to this site to support the day-to-day functioning of the Primeros Pasos clinic. =Burundi= In 2008, DGH was invited to join a community project called Village Health Works in the town of Kigutu (Burundi) to provide community service experience, introduce the liberation medicine approach, and to help recruit humble expert volunteers to assist. DGH has since then been promoting health and social justice in Kigutu. =Oaxaca= In Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, Doctors for Global Health works in partnership with El Centro Popular de Apoyo y Formaci√≥n para La Salud (CEPAFOS- The Community Center for Health Training and Support). For over two decades, CEPAFOS has provided greatly needed health services to the marginalized populations of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, recovering ancestral knowledge of medicinal plants and natural therapies, and organizing and training groups of health promoters throughout the diverse regions of the Isthmus. Ongoing health promoter training takes place in 6 geographic regions, with over 150 health promoters. There is also a medical clinic in the city of Tehuantepec which offers allopathic medical care integrated with indigenous medicines and therapies such as massage and acupuncture. The promotion of traditional healing practices as natural and inexpensive alternatives to conventional medicine is the cornerstone of the vision of CEPAFOS to empower communities to strengthen their own wellbeing, and embodies the mission to put \\"la salud en manos del pueblo\\" =United States ‚Äì education and advocacy= In the United States, DGH offers many opportunities to volunteer for the organization on a local level. Domestic volunteers can dedicate their time to the work of different committees such as the Development and Finance Committee, the Human Rights and Advocacy Committee, the Communications Committee or the International Volunteer Committee. Additionally, DGH promotes the work of local groups in the US. The Tulane University School of Medicine student branch takes part in volunteer activities throughout the community and hosts educational events at the Medical and Public Health Schools. DGH-Los Angeles continues to work with other advocacy groups locally on immigrants' rights issues, the peace movement, and campaigns to advance healthcare for all. =Europe= In 2007, DGH members in Europe convened to form 'DGH- Europe'. The primary goal of the group is to support the work of DGH by taking action at a local level and to promote the organization in Europe, building networks with other like-minded groups. DGH-Europe is committed to raising funds to support existing projects and to assist in the recruitment of volunteers. DGH-Europe has hosted a number of events in France, Italy and Spain. Affiliations People's Health Movement: In December 2000, five representatives from DGH traveled to Bangladesh to join over 1,500 activists from more than 94 countries in the first People's Health Assembly. The gathering culminated in the writing of the People's Charter for Health, of which DGH was a co-signer. DGH continues to work closely with People's Health Movement to promote human rights internationally. DGH works jointly with members of the Italian NGO Psicologi per I Popoli on several projects focused on improving the mental health of the communities in which DGH has a presence.

There is a separate ranking between EU and non-EU candidates, therefore the minimum scores to enter each university differ between the two as well. * University of Bari (42 EU spaces, 8 non-EU spaces) * University of Bologna (75 EU spaces, 15 non-EU spaces) * University of Campania 'Luigi Vanvitelli' (40 EU spaces, 40 non-EU spaces) *University of Messina (30 EU spaces, 20 non-EU spaces) *International Medical School at the University of Milan (34 EU spaces, 16 non-EU spaces) * University of Milan- Bicocca (22 EU spaces, 13 non-EU spaces) *University of Padua (54 EU spaces, 9 non-EU spaces) * University of Pavia (70 EU spaces, 40 non-EU spaces) *Sapienza University of Rome (38 EU spaces, 10 non-EU spaces) * University of Rome Tor Vergata (25 EU spaces, 10 non-EU spaces) * University of Siena (26 EU spaces, 12 non-EU spaces) *University of Turin (70 EU spaces, 31 non-EU spaces) *University of Naples Federico II (15 EU spaces, 10 non-EU spaces) Applicants for the existing courses taught in Italian currently take an Italian admissions test (developed by the Italian Commission), with the available places awarded to those scoring highest on the test. In 2011, MIUR asked Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing to develop and deliver the English language equivalent of this Italian admissions test. The English- language version is called the International Medical Admissions Test (IMAT). Humanitas University in Italy also uses IMAT for its Medicine and Surgery degree course. Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University (RNRMU) uses the test for admission to its bachelor's degree in Biomedicine (English taught, with the University of Turin) and Medicine and Surgery degree (English taught, with the University of Milan). The candidates can sit for the IMAT either in Italy or in test centers located in over 20 countries worldwide. In order to apply for a spot in the medicine course, the candidates must rank the universities in order of preference. The candidates who choose Italy as their test center must sit for the IMAT at their first-choice university. Disabled candidates and candidates with dyslexia are allowed extra time to complete the test. Format and Timing Recently the format of the test has consisted of the following four sections: *Section 1: Logical Reasoning and General Knowledge. This section tests generic skills in problem-solving, understanding argument, data analysis and inference; general knowledge. It is made up of 22 multiple-choice questions. *Section 2, 3 and 4: Scientific Knowledge. These sections test a candidate's ability to apply scientific knowledge from school science. They are made up of 38 multiple-choice questions: Biology (18 questions), Chemistry (12 questions), Physics & Mathematics (8 questions). Recently candidates have been allowed a total of 100 minutes to complete the test (60 questions). All questions had five options, of which one was correct. A correct answer was awarded 1.5 points, a blank answer 0 points and a wrong answer subtracted 0.4 points from the final score. The score for each section is calculated separately, then combined and ranked. If two candidates have the same combined score, the one who scores higher in Logical Reasoning and General Knowledge will be ranked higher. If the score in Section Logical Reasoning and General Knowledge is also the same, then the ranking is based on the one who scores higher in Biology, followed by Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics. If the scores for each section are the same, then the candidate who has an English Language certification (IELTS, TOEFL) will be ranked higher. If both candidates have all the necessary documents, then younger candidate will be ranked higher. For Italian and EU candidates, there is a minimum cumulative score of 20 points in order to be eligible for entry. For Non-EU citizens, the minimum cumulative score for entry is more than 0. The format of the test is confirmed when the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR) publish the IMAT decree. IMAT takes place in September. The enrollment is normally opened in June or July for about 2 to 3 weeks. The IMAT test date and registration process for Humanitas University and Russian National Research Medical University are different from the main IMAT session and candidates should visit the respective university websites for more information.http://www.admissionstesting.org/for-test-takers/imat/about-imat/ Accessed 2018-05-24 In 2019, there were 10,450 candidates competing for 500 available seats in Medicine in English in all of Italy.

Etymology The name hamonado is the native spelling of Spanish jamonado, meaning \\"[prepared] like hamon (ham)\\". However, hamonado should not be confused with hamon (jam√≥n), which is also commonly cooked in the Philippines during the Christmas Season.

Hamonado or hamonada is also a colloquial term for the sweet variant of the Filipino longganisa sausages (properly longganisang hamonado). Description Pork hamonado from Bulacan with hotdogs and star anise Typically meat (usually fatty cuts of pork, but can also be chicken or beef) is marinated overnight in a sweet sauce made with pineapple juice, brown sugar, soy sauce, and various spices. It is then pan-fried until the meat is browned. The meat is then simmered in stock and the marinade with added pineapple chunks until the meat is very tender. It is served on white rice. Variations of the dish sometimes does not include a marinating period, and instead slow cooks the pork until very tender, especially when using cuts with tough meat like pata (ham hock) or beef sirloin. Calamansi juice, carrots, raisins, pickles, longganisa, and hotdogs may also be added in some family recipes. Some hamonado variants may be cooked afritada-style, using tomato sauce or banana ketchup. Similar dishes Hamonado is similar to pininyahang manok, braised chicken made with pineapples.

Padang, Pariaman, Silungkang, Sawah Lunto, Alahan Panjang, and Suliki of West Sumatra have been cited as an area which was particular active in communism. History Hendricus Sneevliet In May 1914, Hendricus Sneevliet (alias Maring) established the Indies Social-Democratic Association (ISDV), which became the Communist Association of the Indies (Perserikatan Komunis di Hindia) in May 1920 and the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) in 1924. Backed by the Communist International (Comintern) in Moscow, the PKI became active among trade unionists and rural villagers in Sumatra. In 1926 and 1927, despite advice by Tan Malaka, a Comintern agent from Sumatra, to the contrary, local leaders instigated rural insurrections in western Java and Sumatra. The government moved decisively to crush the insurrections and imprison communist leaders. Some, like Tan Malaka, fled into exile. But 1,300 communists were exiled to the grim Boven Digul penal colony in West New Guinea. The PKI all but disappeared, not to be an important actor on the political stage until after independence. Perhaps the most prominent outbreak was the 1927 Communist Uprising in Sumatra. When the Japanese invaded Sumatra in 1942, the Communist party in North Sumatra refrained from joining in the resistance against the Japanese. Incidentally, Hadji Abdullah Ahmad, a noted anti-communist and religious leader was from the Minangkabau Highlands, where communism was active. Numerous examples of anti-communist resentment also occurred, for instance during the Indonesian killings of 1965‚Äì1966, PKI- organised squatters' movements and campaigns against foreign businesses in Sumatra's plantations provoked quick reprisals against Communists. Repression against alleged PKI members and sympathizers continued for several years. As late as 1976 mass lay-offs of former members of the communist plantation workers' union Sarbupri members took place in Sumatra, actions motivated by the communist past of these individuals.Stoler, Ann Laura.

He was born into the equestrian order, possibly in North Africa. He held the traditional series of military, administrative and judicial positions of steadily increasing responsibility which aspiring upper class Romans were expected to progress through, known as the cursus honorum. He had a long and distinguished military and political career under the reigns of the emperors Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius and Commodus. He was appointed a special representative of the Emperor on several occasions. He was governor successively of four turbulent Roman frontier provinces. He acquired a reputation as a capable, if brutal, military commander and suppressed a number of internal and external threats. He was used by the emperors he served under as something of a trouble shooter. He was appointed consul in AD 175 or 176 by Emperor Marcus Aurelius as a reward for his loyalty and ability during a revolt by General Avidius Cassius. Hospes received numerous awards for personal gallantry. Biography =Early career= Originally a member of the equestrian order, Gaius Vettius Sabinianus may have originated from Roman North Africa.Mennen, pg. 129Potter, pg. 74 At some point he was adopted by the aristocratic Vettii Sabini.Arnheim, pg. 62 He began his military career as the praefectus cohortis, a junior officer position, of II Commagenorum, a battalion sized army unit. He was promoted to the rank of military tribune, a senior officer position, in Legio I Italica. Sabinianus returned to Rome to participate in the magistracies of the cursus honorum, the sequential mixture of military and political administrative positions held by aspiring politicians in the early Roman Empire.Birley (2000b), pg. 115 In succession he was appointed: quaestor, a junior position administering the public treasury; plebeian tribune, a senior position within theoryextensive powers over the legislature; and praetor, a senior administrative and judicial position reporting directly to the emperor. He was then appointed legatus, commander of a legion, under the proconsular governor of Asia. Vettius Sabinianus‚Äô next appointment was a special command, functioning as the imperial legate responsible for investigating the status of the Cyclades in relation to their administration by the Roman province of Asia.Buraselis, pg. 145 =Later career= Roman Empire at the time of Vettius Sabinianus At the beginning of the reigns of Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, Sabinianus was the senior judge for the Italian regions of Aemilia; Etruria and Liguria. Around 165 Emperor Marcus Aurelius raised a new legion, Legio III Italica, to fight in the Marcomannic Wars and Sabinianus was appointed its first commander as a legatus legionis, senior legionary commander.Maxfield, pg. 42 This was followed by another special appointment, as Legatus Aug. Rationibus putandis trium Galliarum or legate in control of the urban finances of the three Gallic provinces, again reporting directly to the Emperor.Birley (2000a), pg. 160 This appointment may reflect a growing debt problem in the province, triggered by the demands of the Marcomannic Wars.Grant, pg. 154 His next appointment was legatus legionis of another legion, XIV Gemina, together with military and civil jurisdiction over Pannonia Superior, following a Roman defeat in the province in about 170 and the death of the governor.Kov√°cs, pg. 196; Birley, pg. 176 After a brief period in Rome as praefect of the aerarium Saturni (state treasury), he was again posted to the frontier, this time as legatus Augusti pro praetore, imperial governor, of Pannonia Superior, where he served from around 170 to 175. Here he fought in the First Marcomannic War, taking part in several battles against Germanic tribes. For his services Marcus Aurelius rewarded him with a large share of the booty from the campaign. The emperor Marcus Aurelius, whom Vettius Sabinianus loyally supported during the rebellion of Avidius Cassius. During the usurpation of Avidius Cassius in AD 175, Vettius Sabinianus was sent by Marcus Aurelius to take charge of the vexillations (detachments) from Illyricum and defend Rome against a possible advance by Cassius.Birley (2000a), pg. 187 Positioning himself in Rome, Sabinianus also had to ensure that those within the city opposed to the continued war against the Germans, headed by the family of Lucius Verus, did not take advantage of Cassius' rebellion to undermine imperial authority.McLynn, pg. 370 As a reward for his loyalty during the crisis, Vettius Sabinianus was appointed consul by the emperor around AD 176.Alf√∂ldy, p. 190 Becoming a consul was the highest honour of the Roman state, and as such candidates were chosen carefully by the emperor. He was then appointed proconsular curator of Puteoli, followed by a tenure as curator aedium sacrarum, curator of the temples, a senior religious position. Next he was appointed legatus Augusti pro praetore (imperial legate) of Dalmatia in AD 177, with instructions to deal with the bandits which infested the areas around modern Albania and Montenegro, which the previous governor Didius Julianus had been unable to eradicate.Birley (2000a), pg. 198 From 179 to 182 Vettius Sabinianus held the post of imperial governor of Tres Daciae, during which he subdued some 12,000 Free Dacians on the border of the province and settled them inside the provincial border.Dumitrascu, pg. 179 He was probably the governor who fought in a victorious but brutal war against the Buri until 182, which saw the creation of a five mile wide security zone along the borders of the province.Kov√°cs, pg. 260 This was followed by his posting as imperial legate of the province of Pannonia Superior. The last position Sabinianus is recorded to have held, in around AD 191, was proconsular governor of Africa which, because of the reliance of the city of Rome on its grain, was considered the most important Roman governorship. =Decorations and family= Vettius Sabinianus was awarded the civic crown, the second highest military decoration to which a Roman citizen could aspire, three times.Only the grass crown was held in higher regard. A chaplet of common oak leaves woven to form a crown, it was reserved for Roman citizens who saved the lives of fellow citizens by slaying an enemy. He was also awarded the Hasta pura, a decoration for military valour and the Vexilla twice each.Maxfield, pg. 42 He was married to the daughter of Servius Cornelius Scipio Salvidienus Orfitus, proconsular governor of Africa in AD 163/164. His grandson was Gaius Vettius Gratus Sabinianus, who was consul in AD 221.

Written by Bradford Ropes, Betty Burbridge, and Peter Milne, based on a story by Peter Milne and Connie Lee, the film is about a singing cowboy and ranch foreman responsible for completing an important irrigation project and for the three spoiled grandchildren of his former boss who come out West to the ranch they inherited.Magers, pp. 154‚Äì155. Plot Following the death of rancher John Dodge, foreman Gene Autry (Gene Autry) is left the responsibility of taking care of Rancho Grande ranch and Dodge's three spoiled grandchildren raised in the east. Gene is also responsible for completing a major project started by Dodge‚Äîthe construction of an irrigation system that would bring valuable water to the faithful Rancho Grande employees in the southern part of the valley. Dodge mortgaged his ranch in order to finance the project. When Dodge's grandchildren, Tom (Dick Hogan), Kay (June Storey), and Patsy (Mary Lee), arrive from the east, they are unimpressed with life on the ranch. Tom and Kay are madcap college types who think ranchlife is boring and long to return to the big city. They resent Gene's authority and dismiss his talk of developing a work ethic and the importance of the irrigation project. Meanwhile, crooked lawyer Emory Benson (Ferris Taylor) is planning to seize the mortgage to Rancho Grande. After meeting Tom and Kay, he decides to take advantage of their discontent in order to slow the irrigation project and prevent the bank from renewing the mortgage. Gradually, Gene is able to win Kay over to his way of thinking, but Tom falls in with a group of partying tenderfoots from the east. He invites them to stay at Rancho Grande, where they get in everyone's way. Gene and his sidekick Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette) finally succeed in scaring the dudes off the ranch. Angered by Gene's actions, Tom and Kay decide to leave. When a rockslide at the irrigation project site injures Jose, a faithful Rancho Grande employee, Tom and Kay come to their senses and pledge to help complete the project on time. Continuing his plan of terror, Benson dynamites a train carrying the pipe needed to complete the project. When Gene and his men ride to salvage the pipe, Benson and his gang are waiting for a showdown. In the gunfight that ensues, Gene captures Benson and his gang, insuring the timely completion of the irrigation project and the grandchildren's continued ownership of Rancho Grande.

It is the 22nd Barney Bear short. It was directed by Dick Lundy using the Tex Avery unit while Avery was gone from the studio. Plot The cartoon begins at Barney's house, who lives next door to William Wildcat. Barney overhears William Wildcat scolding at his son, Willie Wildcat. Barney walks next door just in time to find Willie running from his dad who catches him, carries him over to a tree stump, sits down on it while turning Willie over his knee. He pulls down his pants and begins a blistering spanking on his bare bottom. Without realizing that Willie was being punished for being disobedient, takes him to his house and attempts to get along with him through child psychology. Willie starts his troubles by burning Barney's foot and putting it in gasoline. Barney tries playing \\"Pin the Tail on the Donkey\\" with Willie, but accidentally pins the tail on a real donkey and ends up getting kicked into a sign by the donkey. Barney then tries playing football with Willie, but Willie puts a rock inside the football and Barney hurts his foot after trying to kick it. Barney then decides to \\"go along with the gag\\" by pretending to be a damsel in distress on a toy train track, but Willie uses a real train to run over Barney. Barney decides to \\"develop Willie's love of true nature\\" by gardening, but Willie pours Quick- Grow Plant Food on the two trees that Barney's hammock is tied to and they grow very tall and Barney lands in a barrel of tar which Willie wheelbarrows him down to a clothes washing machine. Barney then tries to \\"give him a hobby\\" through photography but Willie slips a giant bullet into the camera and turns it around, making Barney fire himself. Barney then tries \\"winning his undying attention\\" by baking him a cake but Willie puts a gashose into the cake, which turns into a bomb cake that explodes when Barney lights the candle. Barney then reads the final rule of the child psychology book he was reading throughout the cartoon, which reads \\"If all else fails, Bottom's Up!\\" So Barney puts Willie over his knee and he and William both spank Willie's bottom. This time making the mistake of Not baring his bottom, only to have sore hands because of Willie hiding the book in his pants.

It is home to the Minangkabau people who refer it as Alam Minangkabau, or \\"the world of Minangkabau\\". This area formed a kingdom known from at least the 7th century as Malayu. It is probable that wet rice cultivation evolved in the highlands long before it appeared in other parts of Sumatra, and predates significant foreign contact. Inscriptions in the area have been found from the rule of Adityavarman (1347‚Äì1375). The Dutch began exploiting the gold reserves in the highlands in the 1680s. They dominated the trade in the area, severely restricting the trade outlets between the highlands and the ports on the coast between 1820 and 1899, bringing about a marked decrease in rice production. The highlands consist of three major valleys: Tanah Datar Valley, Agam Valley, and Limapuluh Valley. The village of Belimbing in the highlands is well known for its examples of surviving Minangkabu architecture.

Produced by V. S. Rajkumar under the studio Leo Vision, it was distributed by J. Satish Kumar, under his banner JSK Film Corporation. It stars Vijay Sethupathi, Gayathrie Shankar, Vigneshwaran Palanisamy, Bagavathi Perumal and Rajkumar, thus marking the acting debut for Rajkumar, Vigneshwaran and Bagavathi. The plot is based on a true story that involves a young man who experiences retrograde amnesia after a cricket incident two days before his wedding. The music and background score of the film are composed by Ved Shankar and Siddharth Vipin respectively. The cinematography of the film was handled by C. Premkumar and editing was done by R. Govindaraj. The film released on 30 November 2012 to widely positive reviews from critics, and became a cult hit. Owing to the film's success, it was remade in six languages as Pusthakamlo Konni Pageelu Missing (Telugu), Kwatle Satisha (Kannada), Medulla Oblangata (Malayalam), Suna Pila Tike Screw Dhila (Odia), Dokyala Shot (Marathi) and Shu Thayu? (Gujarati). Plot C. Prem Kumar (Vijay Sethupathi) is set to marry his lover Dhanalakshmi (Gayathrie). Two days before his wedding, Prem decides to try his hand at playing cricket with his friends Bagavathi alias Bugs (Bagavathi Perumal), Balaji Tharaneetharan alias Bhaji (Rajkumar) and Saras (Vigneshwaran Palanisamy). The game gets a little serious as Prem, in a bid to catch a ball, falls down, only to get injured in his head. He quickly gets back on his toes as the injury is not serious. Soon after the match, the friends are in for a shock. Due to the injury, Prem develops retrograde amnesia and short-term memory loss, wherein he remembers the chain of events which leads to the injury but forgets the last one year of his life and fails to remember everything after the injury. He remembers his life until college and recognises his friends but is clueless about his upcoming wedding and about Dhana herself, as it is during the last one year that he met her, fell in love with her, and decided to marry her. Fearing trouble, his friends take him to a doctor, who says that he could recover anytime. Hence, his friends plan to keep him in their company, enact a drama until he ties the wedding knot, with the hope that he would get back his memory soon, while covering his disorder from everyone else. In the end, everything works out well, and Prem gets his memory back. Cast * Vijay Sethupathi as C.

Balaji Tharaneetharan, who was present with him, began writing a script based on the incident, besides directing it as well. One of the other witnesses, Bagavathi Perumal agreed to play himself in the film, while the victim Prem Kumar handled the cinematography himself. It took two months for lead actor Vijay Sethupathi to a lengthy dialogue that begins with the lines \\"Enna aachu? Cricket valadnom? Nee thane ball potte? Slip aaitena? Keezha vizhundhutena? Okay okay\\" (What happened? We played cricket? You threw the ball? Did I slip and fall?

History The Shirley family had lived in Staunton Harold for many generations. Sir Robert Shirley built the church in the hall grounds in 1653 in the Commonwealth era. The present hall was originally a Jacobean building built for Robert Shirley, 1st Earl Ferrers as a family seat for the newly ennobled Shirley family and remained so until the 20th century. The fourth earl, Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers, was tried, condemned and hanged for killing his steward. The hall was rebuilt in its present form in 1763 for Washington Shirley, 5th Earl Ferrers. It is a Georgian two-storey brick house with stone dressings in the form of a square enclosing a quadrangle. Sewallis Shirley, 10th Earl Ferrers inherited the hall in 1859 and sold most of the land. Robert Shirley, 12th Earl Ferrers gifted the church to the National Trust and put the estate up for auction. In 1955 it was acquired by Leonard Cheshire for use as a Cheshire Home and sold in 1980 to be used as a Sue Ryder Care home. In 2003, after 50 years of institutional use, the Hall is again family owned and occupied by the Blunt family. Part of the building is used for weddings and conferences. The stable block is occupied by a number of small craft enterprises as the Ferrers Centre for Arts and Crafts.

Biography An ethnic Dargin, Vagabov was born in the Dagestani village of Gubden. In 1990, he took part in rallies, led by the Salafist Sheikh Muhammad Bagauddin, for Soviet Muslims to be allowed to make the Hajj pilgrimage. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, a group of Arabs in the Islamic missionary organisation Tablighi Jamaat visited his native village in 1992. Vagabov, who spoke Arabic, served as their interpreter, and travelled with them around Dagestan. In 1994 the 19-year-old Vagabov went for religious instruction in Pakistan, where he memorized the Koran. He moved on to Karachi, where he studied Shariah and learnt Farsi and Urdu. In 1997 he returned to Dagestan and open a mosque in Gubden. In the same year he reportedly travelled to Chechnya and attended a training camp ran by the Arab field commander Khattab. He returned to Dagestan, and took part in militant activities before he turned himself into the authorities in 2001 during an amnesty. He would return to militancy and work his way up the ranks of Shariat Jamaat. In mid-July 2010, Dokku Umarov appointed Vagabov as both the emir of Vilayat Dagestan and the Qadi of the Caucasus Emirate Sharia court, filling the positions previously held by the late Umalat Magomedov and Anzor Astemirov respectively. In 2010 he took part in organizing the 2010 Moscow Metro bombings, killing 40 people and wounding more than 100. It was reported that one of the suicide bombers, Mariam Sharipova, was his wife, although her father denied this. Vagabov and 4 other militants were killed during a raid by the FSB in the village of Gunib in August 2010.

Lee, 358 U.S. 217 (1959), was a landmark case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the State of Arizona does not have jurisdiction to try a civil case between a non-Indian doing business on a reservation with tribal members who reside on the reservation, the proper forum for such cases being the tribal court. The Navajo tribe has lived in the southwestern United States and first came into contact with the United States government in 1846, signing a treaty with the government in 1849. In the early 1860s, the government removed the tribe from their traditional area to eastern New Mexico at the Bosque Redondo. In 1868, the United States and the tribe signed a new treaty to put it back on a reservation in their traditional lands, where the tribe focused on raising sheep and goats.  Background  = History of the tribe = Reenactment of the Long Walk The Navajo tribe came into contact with the United States in 1846 after General Stephen W. Kearney marched to Santa Fe during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War., 36 (2002). The tribe signed its first treaty with the United States in 1849,Act of Sept. 9, 1849, ; 1 583 (Charles J. Kappler ed. 1904); , 9 (4th ed. 2013). and signed another treaty in 1868.Act of June 1, 1868, ; Kappler, 1 at 1015. The 1849 treaty was immediately suspect among tribal members because of the actions of Colonel John Macrae Washington that resulted in the death of Navajo leader Narbona., at 40-41; , at 9-10. With relations strained, in 1862 the United States began a military campaign under Kit Carson to remove the tribe from the mountains of Arizona to the Bosque Redondo on the Pecos River near present-day Fort Sumner, New Mexico, which resulted in the Long Walk of the Navajo, removing the tribe from their home and relocating them to eastern New Mexico., at 50-53; Bethany R. Berger, Sheep, Sovereignty, and the Supreme Court: The Story of Williams v. Lee, in 359, 362 (Carole Goldberg, Kevin K. Washburn, & Philip P. Frickey, eds. 2011). The 1868 treaty was signed at Fort Sumner and provided for the tribe's return to the current reservation and traditional homeland, but also for 15,000 head of sheep and goats and 500 cattle to be provided to the tribe by the U.S. government.; Kappler, 1 at 1015; , at 11-12. Unlike many other treaties, it was celebrated by the Navajo as preserving the majority of their land for the tribe., at 40-41. = Reservation = Map of the Navajo reservation (in orange) The Navajo reservation was originally established in eastern Arizona / western New Mexico. Although the tribe was promised , the tribe actually received ., at 68. Unlike most other reservations, the Navajo reservation actually expanded over the following years., at 69. Presidential executive orders added significant land to the reservation beginning in 1878 and running through 1901.Kappler, 1 at 875. By 1934 and the last Congressional adjustment, the reservation contained . At the same time the tribe was increasing its land, it was increasing the amount of livestock, particularly sheep. In the 1930s, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) estimated that the reservation supported 575,000 sheep and 186,000 goats., at 76. The livestock was overgrazing the land, and the experts estimated that the land could support only half the number that was being grazed. The BIA then began an aggressive stock reduction program that reminded many Navajo of the imprisonment at the Bosque Redondo and was opposed by the tribe.Berger, Sheep at 361-62; O'Neal. At the same time, the Navajo began to develop a more detailed system of self-government, including a court system.Berger, Sheep at 365; O'Neal. In 1949, Congress passed the Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation bill; its Fernandez Amendment which would have granted the states jurisdiction over tribal lands.Berger, Sheep at 364-65. President Harry S. Truman vetoed the bill and requested Congress to send it back to him without the Fernandez Amendment, which it did the following year.Berger, Sheep at 365. = Indian traders = Navajo trading post in the 1890s The first licensed trading with the Navajo began in 1849, and Auguste Lacome was the first trader recorded., at 21-22. After the return from the Bosque Redondo, Army sutlers at the military posts such as Fort Defiance, Arizona began to trade extra rations for Navajo wool., at 22. By 1883, traders were buying 1.3 million pounds of wool in addition to other products raised or produced by the tribe, at 79. The traders, who were largely Mormon, often pushed for maximum immediate production rather than a long-term sustainable yield., at 76-77. About 1885, the traders began to transform from a barter economy to a credit system., 44-45 (2008). The traders had a monopoly and created a virtual system of debt bondage by being the only ones to offer credit for goods needed by tribal members., at 44, 46. However, after 1890, the US government prohibited traders collecting for old debts and require them to use cash instead of trader script or \\"tin\\" money., at 53-54. Part of that was due to the nature of the trading system, where the trader could not own their own store or land, which had to be leased from the Navajo., at 24. In addition to the restriction on land, the trader had to post a $10,000 bond with the BIA. Long-term traders, such as John Lorenzo Hubbell or William Keams, established relationships with tribal members to foster long-term repeat business., at 23-24. They began to market Navajo blankets for use in mining camps and as area rugs in the eastern United States., at 28-29. By 1943, there were over 140 trading posts on the reservation., at 44. = Credit dispute = Navajo sheep on reservation Hugh Lee was an Indian trader who operated a trading post on the reservation. Lee was licensed by the BIA to operate the trading post and he sold goods on credit to members of the tribe. Paul Williams and his wife, Lorena, were enrolled tribal members of the Navajo tribe and resided on the Navajo reservation. Williams bought goods on credit and did not make payment. In 1952, Lee filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of Apache County, Arizona and obtained a writ of attachment for sheep belonging to Williams.  State court  Williams moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the state court did not have jurisdiction on the reservation. In the meantime, Lee was granted an order authorizing the Apache County Sheriff to sell at auction the sheep belonging to Williams. In 1954, the trial court finally issued a ruling denying the motion to dismiss and in 1955, it found for Lee. Williams appealed to the Arizona Supreme Court.Williams et ux. v. Lee, 319 P.2d 998 (Ariz. 1958).  Arizona Supreme Court  At the Arizona Supreme Court, Williams argued that the proper jurisdiction was the Navajo tribal court and that a state officer did not have the authority to sell the sheep. The court held that the state had jurisdiction to hear civil cases involving Indians and non-Indians since there was no Congressional prohibition against it. The court ruled, however, that federal regulations prohibited the sale of Indian livestock without the approval of BIA. Williams then appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case and issued a writ of certiorari.  Supreme Court  Justice Hugo Black, author of the unanimous opinion = Arguments = Norman M. Littell argued the case for Williams. Littell argued that Congress had plenary power to end tribal immunity but had not done so, and other federal laws preempted state jurisdiction. William W. Stevenson argued the case for Lee. He argued that the Navajo tribe was a creation of the federal government and not a longstanding tribe, like the Cherokee. His position was that there was no tribal sovereignty. Solicitor General J. Lee Rankin filed an amicus curae brief at the request of the court, urging reversal. While Rankin supported reversal, he did so on narrow grounds, based on federal regulations of Indian traders. = Decision = Justice Hugo Black delivered the opinion of a unanimous court. He noted that in 1830, the state of Georgia had tried to extend its laws to the Cherokee reservation and that Worcester v. GeorgiaWorcester v. Georgia, . clearly established that state law and jurisprudence did not reach into the confines of a reservation. He then stated that the question was whether, absent Congressional authorization, a state infringed on the right of the tribe to govern itself., State Power over Indian Reservations: A Critical Comment on Burger Court Doctrine, (1981). The Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation ActNavajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act of 1950, April 19, 1950, ch. 92, , . 498-502 (Charles J. Kappler, ed. 1971). was designed by Congress to strengthen the tribal government and tribal courts. Black observed, \\"Significantly, when Congress has wished the States to exercise this power it has expressly granted them the jurisdiction which Worcester v. Georgia had denied.\\" Finally, he noted that the Navajo tribal court has jurisdiction to hear civil cases brought by non-Indians against tribal members and that no federal statute gave Arizona jurisdiction to hear such cases., 1-3, 106 (1988). Black stated that allowing the exercise of state jurisdiction would undermine tribal sovereignty and that only Congress had the authority to do so., 209-210 (2002). The case was reversed.Williams v. Lee, . Subsequent developments Williams has been cited as the initial case in the modern era of federal Indian law. It is widely cited in cases dealing with tribal sovereignty and state infringement on tribal rights. Some claim that Williams formed the basis for the Indian self-determination era and for the Indian Self-Determination Act.Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, Jan. 4, 1975, . The case was also the first of a series of cases that limited Arizona's authority within the Navajo reservation.Dewi Ioan Ball, William v. Lee - 50 Years Later: A Reassessment of One of the Most Important Cases in the Modern-Era of Federal Indian Law (2010)., Williams v. Lee and the Debate over Indian Equality, (2009)., 276 (1997). The case is considered a landmark case involving tribal sovereignty., xi, 27-28 (2009). 65 (2003).

She was launched on 13 July 1770 at Chatham Dockyard, and completed there on 21 November 1770. She took part in the American Revolutionary War, enforcing the blockade of the Delaware Bay, and served in the Battle of Turtle Gut Inlet, near Cape May, New Jersey. While under the temporary command of Lieutenant Hugh Christian, she was burnt by her own crew to avoid capture on 7 August 1778 in Narragansett Bay during the Battle of Rhode Island. Service history Kingfisher was commissioned in September 1770 under Commander Thomas Jordan, and sailed for North America on 1 August 1771. In September 1772 command passed to Commander Jacob Lobb, then on 9 April 1773 Commander George Montagu, and in November 1775 under Commander Alexander Graeme. =Norfolk= Kingfisher under Commander Montagu arrived at Norfolk, Virginia on 8 September 1775, along with under Commander Graeme and under Commander Matthew Squire. On 30 September 1775, the mayor and council of Norfolk wrote to Lord Dunmore about the \\"illegal and riotous\\" behaviour of the crews of Kingfisher and Otter. On 1 January 1776, she began a heavy bombardment of Norfolk along with Liverpool and Otter, setting the town on fire. =Delaware Bay= In early June 1776, while enforcing the blockade of the Delaware Bay, Commander Henry Bellew of and Commander Graeme reported to Vice Admiral Molyneux Shuldham about their encounter with the American ships , , and . Later in the month, on the afternoon of 28 June 1776, Kingfisher spotted the American privateer sailing toward Cape May and began chase, followed by with Commander Charles Hudson. Early on the morning of 29 June 1776, Kingfisher and Orpheus resumed chase. Nancy, to evade capture of her supplies of gunpowder and arms, ran aground at Turtle Gut Inlet. She was assisted by the American ships Lexington, Reprisal, and . In the ensuing battle, Nancy was set on fire and exploded, killing the master's mate and six men on longboats from Kingfisher. Also during 1776, Orpheus and Kingfisher captured the Adrian, which was sailing from Philadelphia to France with a cargo of tobacco, flour, bread and staves. =Narragansett Bay= On 27 August 1777, Kingfisher under Commander Graeme engaged the newly built 14-gun Oliver Cromwell under Captain Samuel Chace, Jr., ran her ashore, and burnt her. During the fight, the brigantine escaped. On 7 February 1778, Kingfisher under Lieutenant Hugh Christian was stationed in the Sakonnet Passage to Narragansett Bay. On 30 May, Christian led the boats of the squadron, which were carrying a detachment of troops, in an attack on the saw mills on a creek near Taunton River. The attack was successful. Between 29 May and 18 July, the British captured a number of vessels: the sloops Sally and Fancy, snow Baron D'Ozell, Olive Branch, sloop Betsey, and schooner Sally. Kingfisher shared the prize money with , , , and the galley . French Admiral d'Estaing's squadron arrived in Narragansett Bay on 29 July 1778 to support the American army under General George Washington during the battle of Rhode Island. As Kingfisher lay in Sakonnet Passage, Christian moved her into Foglands Bay. There she landed all her guns and stores. On 30 July he and her crew abandoned her and set her on fire to prevent the French from capturing her. The Royal Navy ended up having to destroy ten of their own vessels in all. Lieutenant Christian went on to command the armed ship Vigilant, of 20 guns and 150 men.

The genus is solely known from fossil amber found in Cantabria, northern Spain, dating to the Albian age of the Early Cretaceous Period. Currently the genus comprises a single species Cantabroraphidia marcanoi. History and classification Cantabroraphidia marcanoi is known only from one fossil, the holotype, specimen number ES-07-6, which is housed in the Museo Geominero in Madrid, Spain. The specimen is composed of an almost entirely complete adult insect of unidentified sex. Preserved in a transparent mass of amber, the specimen is fixed in association with a large amount of plant debris and one adult dipteran. Despite the amount of debris obscuring portions of the individual, enough details are present and visible to show the specimen was not from a previously described genus. The fossil was recovered from outcrops of the Las Pe√±osas Formation in the Cave of El Soplao near R√°bago, part of the Cantabria autonomous community in Northern Spain. Cantabroraphidia was first studied by group of paleoentomologists led by Ricardo P√©rez-de la Fuente of the University of Barcelona and including Enrique Pe√±alver, Xavier Delcl√≤s, and Andr√© Nel. Their 2010 type description of the new genus and species was published in the French journal Annales de la Soci√©t√© Entomologique de France. The genus name Cantabroraphidia was coined by the researchers as a combination of the snakefly genus Raphidia and \\"Cantabria\\" which is in reference the Cantabria autonomous community where the outcrops that produced the fossil are located. The specific epithet marcanoi is from in honor of Francisco Javier L√≥pez Marcano as recognition for his efforts to have the El Soplao ambers studied. Cantabroraphidia marcanoi is one of six described snakefly species found in the Albian deposits of Cantabria, and was the first Raphidiopteran to be described from El Soplao. Description The lone specimen of Cantabroraphidia marcanoi is a nearly complete adult. The hyaline forewings are partially preserved and display brown vein structuring that hosts strong setae. While partial, the forewings are complete enough to show the full length to be and a maximum of in width. The elongated pterostigma is faintly infumate, long and lacks crossveins except for the basal crossvein that closes the cell. Excluding the prothorax most of the thorax and all of the abdomen were crushed prior to entombment in the liquid sap. As such very little can be determined about these areas of the insect. Overall the thorax and abdomen appear to be of similar length as the prothorax and head. One of the few identifiable characteristics on the top of the prothorax is a small line of spines along the front edge.

Dipterocarpus intricatus. In: IUCN 2012. IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2012.1. . Downloaded on 7 August 2012. The tree, itself deciduous, is found in dense deciduous forests and clear forests. It is often met in pure stands in deciduous, periodically flooded lowland forests, but can also be found in dense forest at up to 1300m altitude. In Thailand it sometimes occurs growing gregariously with D. obtusifolious, D. tuberculatus, Shorea robusta and S. siamensis, sometimes in pure stands forming the climatic dry deciduous dipterocarp forest. This forest type covered a large area of eastern, north-eastern and northern Thailand, from peneplain at 150-300m elevations to slope and ridges up to 1300m above sea level. It does also occur in Lowland dipterocarp forest (0-350m) in Thailand. In Vietnam, it is described as common in dry forests. The tree prefers poor, sandy and lateritic soils derived from granitic and sandstone formations. Seedlings develop hardy rootstock and thick rough bark on the stout stem, affording fire-protection in the ground-fire prone early hot dry season. Coppicing occurs freely up to a moderate size. In Thailand leaves are shed from November, defoliation is complete by February, with leaf starting at this time, or sometimes a little before. Flowering occurs from February to April, fruiting from April to May, though in certain areas or some years with a late rainy season these periods start up to 3 months earlier. The species grows from 15 to 30m tall. The fruit has 2 prominent, elongated, netted wings, 6‚Äì8 cm long x 1.5‚Äì2 cm wide, on top of an ovoid or ellipsoid fruit-body, 1.5‚Äì2 cm long x 1-1.5 cm wide, with undulate ribs, 2-3mm wide.Tucker, A.O., A.J.

He was captured by the Gestapo near Montlu√ßon in 1944 and deported to Buchenwald concentration camp where he remained until its liberation by American forces in 1945.  Biography  Little is known of Maurice Southgate's early life, but it is understood he was educated in Paris, attending a technical college, which later allowed him to start his own upholstery business. With the coming of World War II, Southgate was part of the British Expeditionary Force, and in June 1940 was evacuated from Saint-Nazaire on the , which was later sunk by German aircraft. Fortunately, Southgate was able to swim away, being picked up by another vessel which later docked in Falmouth, Cornwall. In England he was posted by the RAF to the Air Ministry, where notably, he became reacquainted with his childhood friend Pearl Witherington. In May 1942 his name was passed through to SOE's French Section, where he was accepted for training in July. His superiors were impressed with his serious and thorough approach, resulting in him being readied for the job of organiser for the newly established STATIONER circuit. In January 1943, after parachuting near Clermont-Ferrand with his wireless operator Jacqueline Nearne, Southgate began establishing communication networks around Vierzon, Ch√¢teauroux and Limoges, and also in the far south-west, around Tarbes. Towards the end of the summer STATIONER began to attack railway targets, power stations and aircraft works, in the hope that more adventurous sabotage was possible. In September a courier, Pearl Witherington, arrived to assist, and a month later Southgate was flown back to London to report on his progress. Returning to France to help with the incoming Allied invasion, Southgate landed near Toulouse in January 1944. Burdened with a considerable workload, including assisting a 2,500 man resistance group, on 1 May 1944, a weary Southgate was caught by a Gestapo trap in Montlucon, where he missed the secret signal. After interrogation, Southgate was deported to Germany, to the Buchenwald concentration camp, where 16 of his compatriots were hanged. He escaped this fate through feigning illness and was admitted to the camp hospital. Southgate spent several more weeks being genuinely ill. After which he was moved to work in the tailor's shop, where he kept a low profile and remained until American forces liberated Buchenwald on 11 April 1945.

On the trip, they defend a young woman who boards the ship from her pursuers‚Äîand who is also intent on reaching Nome as soon as possible. Glenister immediately begins to fall for the young beauty, who turns out to be Helen Chester, niece of Judge Arthur Chester, recently appointed as the first federal judge for the Alaska Territory‚Äîthe \\"law\\" is coming to the wild northern frontier. Except it turns out the law is crooked. The Judge and the federal marshall are really under the thumb of strongman politician Alexander McNamara. After reaching Nome, McNamara succeeds in being appointed receiver of all the most lucrative mining claims in the region, based on fraudulent disputes over the validity of the miners' claims. Glenister, Dextry, and a number of naive Swedes are dispossessed of their lands. The miners hire lawyers to fight on the legal side, and also form a vigilante group to fight the \\"law\\". McNamara rules ruthlessly, running the mines himself. Glenister sinks into despair, believing that Helen is in on the conspiracy against the miners, and almost loses his stake in the Midas in a night of reckless gambling. He is only saved from that fate by Cherry Malotte, whose unrequited love for Glenister has brought her to Nome. Helen slowly learns about the scheme being perpetrated by McNamara, her uncle, and others, while her affections are torn between Glenister and McNamara. Historical basis The novel is loosely based on actual events that occurred during the Nome Gold Rush while Rex Beach was in Nome. Beach himself documented the non-fiction version in a series titled \\"The Looting of Alaska\\", which was published in the January through May 1906 issues of Appleton's Booklovers Magazine. \\"Alexander Macnamara\\" of the novel is a fictionalized version of Alexander McKenzie, an influential behind-the-scenes politician who had the federal judge at Nome, Arthur H. Noyes, make him the receiver of valuable gold placers. The principal victims were a trio of prospectors enviously called \\"the three lucky Swedes\\" (actually two naturalized US citizens of Swedish birth, and a Norwegian), Japhet Lindeberg, Erik Lindblom, and John Brynteson. The scheme was halted when McKenzie was arrested by federal marshals sent to Nome by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. He served three months in jail for contempt of court before being pardoned by President McKinley.

It is an 18th-century manor ensemble with main manor house and other manor buildings and a Baroque-style park.  History  From 1553, the noble Plater family owned the Indrica Manor. In 1729 Janis Ludwig Plater, Starosta at Daugavpils and later at the Inflanty Voivodeship (1735-1736), also owned the KrƒÅslava Manor, formerly property of Wolff von L√ºdinghausen. His son Konstantin Ludwig Plater (1722-1778) married daughter of Prince August Ogi≈Ñski and around 1750 began building a two-story stone building with a mansard roof near the ruins of the Kraslava Order Castle on the Theater Hill. Contraction was completed in 1791 by his youngest son, August Hyacint Plater. It is speculated that the Baroque-style palace project may have been designed by Jan Valentin Didrei≈°ten, architect of the Kraslava Town Hall, or was designed in collaboration with Antonio Paroko, architect of the Kraslava Roman Catholic Church. In 1824 the building was rebuilt according to the canons of classicism. Next to the palace were also other manor buildings: steward's and gardener's house, canaries, stable, ice cellars, orangery. Around the New Palace on the slopes of the Daugava valley was established a landscape park of approximately 22 ha. Following the October Revolution in Russian Empire, during 1917-1919 Plater's palace was plundered and damaged. Count Gustav Christoph Plater, the last owner of the estate, died in Riga in 1923, and his wife, Mary Plater, emigrated to Spain, where she died in 1949. In 1923 the Kraslava Gymnasium was opened in the nationalized palace. The first Gymnasium director was Valery Salem. In 1944, the school was renamed Kraslava Secondary School No. 1, started training in field of manufacturing, and set up workshops in the old stables of the manor to teach mechanics. In 1972 the 1st Secondary School was moved from the old palace to building on 25 Rai≈Üa Street, which was built in 1964 for the 2nd Secondary School. In 1984, exploration of the interior walls resulted in the discovery of ancient palace wall paintings. Currently, the Kraslava Museum of History and Art operates in the territory of the manor complex. At the end of 2011, with the support of the European Regional Development Fund, the historical appearance of the Kraslava Manor Park was restored according to the 1824 plan. The park's pond has been cleaned, walking paths have been set up along the park's terraces and in the courtyard of the palace, and new stairs have been built in their historical place.

At the 2012 Summer Olympics, she competed in the super-heavyweight category and finished fifth. However, four years later in 2016 samples taken at London 2012 from the Armenian bronze medalist Hripsime Khurshudyan were tested positive for prohibited substances. Therefore, Egypt‚Äôs Nahla Ramadan, who initially placed fifth, came fourth place.  Achievements  Al-Ahram Weekly In 2003 at the world junior weightlifting Grand Prix championship in Budapest, Nahla Ramadan became the game's top- ranked athlete after collecting three gold medals and breaking two world records in the process, an unprecedented accomplishment for an Egyptian of any sex in the sport. When she was just 18 years old, she has set a new world record of 145 kg in the jerk, two kilograms more than that of Bulgaria's Krenz Geuiguny. Ramadan's second world record was in the total number of kilograms lifted: 260 kg, again at Geuiguny's expense and her previous record of 255 kg. In the snatch, Ramadan heaved 115 kg to clinch her third gold medal but this time failed to break the world record.

Its informal name comes from the name of an earlier tax shelter, BOSS (\\"Bond and Option Sales Strategy\\"), which it somewhat resembles. There were at least 7 legal cases still under way at the end of 2016. Details The term was coined by U.S. Treasury officials to describe a variety of tax shelters that sought to wipe out taxes on capital gains from the sale of a business or other appreciated asset; for example, by artificially inflating the basis of a partnership by contributing an asset paired with a contingent liability. The partnership contribution rules at the time ignored the contingent liability that effectively offset the asset. The result was an inflated basis that allowed the taxpayer to claim a loss from the partnership's subsequent unwinding. The shelters involved creating paper losses to offset real gains. All resembled an earlier shelter marketed as \\"BOSS,\\" short for \\"Bond and Option Sales Strategy.\\" Beginning in the late 1990s, advisers at some accounting and law firms marketed the Son of BOSS transaction in various forms. It is likely several thousand taxpayers used the shelter before 2000 when the Treasury and the Congress began taking steps to block its tax benefits. The Son of BOSS schemes involved 1,800 people and cost the government $6 billion in lost revenue, according to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) estimates. Of the $6 billion, the government has recovered more than half. The IRS started cracking down in 2000. By 2005, 1,165 people had settled Son of BOSS cases with the IRS. The complex structures used in the schemes were difficult, however, for the IRS to unravel. Reuters News Service reported that the IRS was losing some court challenges to its crackdown.  Significant rulings In 2000, the Internal Revenue Service issued IRS Notice 2000‚Äì44,2002 C.B. 255, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury. asserting that Son-of-BOSS transactions were invalid. The Son of BOSS scheme has been ruled to be invalid for Federal tax purposes. For background, see generally 527 F.3d 443 (5th Cir. 2008). American Boat Company LLC v. United States;583 F.3d 471 (7th Cir. 2009). and Klamath Strategic Investment Fund v. United States.568 F.3d 537 (5th Cir. 2009). In IR-2005-83, Aug. 29, 2005, the IRS reported that in the largest criminal tax case ever filed, KPMG admitted that it engaged in a fraud that generated at least $11 billion in phony tax losses which, according to court papers, cost the United States at least $2.5 billion in evaded taxes. In addition to KPMG's former deputy chairman, the individuals indicted include two former heads of KPMG's tax practice and a former tax partner in the New York, New York office of a prominent national law firm. The only Son of BOSS case which has been decided by the U.S. Supreme Court is United States v. Home Concrete & Supply, LLC, which was decided in 2012. This case concerned primarily whether the statute of limitations was properly applied, and not the validity of scheme itself. Home Concrete & Supply was a limited liability company formed in 1999 to facilitate a Son of BOSS scheme for two North Carolina businessmen, Robert Pierce and Stephen Chandler, who owned a small oil-and-coal company. The two filed their 1999 tax returns in 2000. They were audited by the Internal Revenue Service in 2006, and were billed that year for unpaid taxes totaling $6 million. The Home Concrete partners sued, arguing the IRS violated a three-year statute of limitations on its power to claim unpaid taxes. The IRS replied it was within its power to bill taxpayers up to six years back when more than 25 percent of a taxpayer's gross income was involved. The Home Concrete partners lost in District Court but won in February 2011 on appeal. The IRS appealed and the Supreme Court in November decided to take up the case. On April 25, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Home Concrete & Supply, stating that the six- year statute of limitations did not apply when a taxpayer understated his income by overstating his basis, only the three-year statute applied. In the interim, the law firm that helped the Home Concrete partners set up their Son of BOSS transactions, Jenkens & Gilchrist, closed. Two of its partners were found guilty of tax evasion. Joe B. Garza of Garza and Harris (Dallas Texas) in conjunction with Deutsche Bank had created the tax instruments marketed by the law firm. Despite numerous lawsuits Garza had been using Son of a boss shelters for 2 decades and has been the subject of articles highlighting his activities in Forbes and others.Dallas Morning News February 6, 2018 In February 2018 more than 40 FBI and IRS agents raided the law offices of Joe B.Garza.  IRS collections  According to the IRS, the IRS collected more than $3.7 billion from taxpayers in 2005 who voluntarily participated in a parallel civil global settlement initiative related to Son of BOSS. The BLIPS and SOS shelters are part of the Son of BOSS family of tax shelters.  2012 Presidential campaign  In a campaign advertisement released on August 9, 2012, incumbent President Barack Obama made specific reference to his GOP opponent Mitt Romney and Romney's presumed involvement in a Son of BOSS tax avoidance as a Marriott International board member.

It was originally described, along with the species Baiyankamys shawmayeri by Hinton in 1943 after he found the remains of a single individual in south east of the Bismarck Mountain Range, north east New Guinea. Tate, in 1951 and, Laurie and Hill in 1954, confirmed the existence of both the species and genus. Distribution of the murine rodent genera Baiyankamys, Crossomys and Hydromys (except for the widespread Hyperolius chrysogaster) on New Guinea Classification Hinton described Baiyankamys as similar in appearance to the species Hydromys habbema but differed due to its unreduced pinnae and its lower teeth. It was described as having three lower molars on both sides of the lower jaw, whereas other genera of amphibious murines in New Guinea have only two. In 1968 Mahoney discovered that the specimen of B. shawmayeri was a composite resulting from an incorrectly associated mandible of the species Rattus niobe and the skull of a small water rat. When the correct mandible was found in the BMNH collections Mahoney proposed that, based on their similarity B. shawmayeri should be classified as a synonym of H. habbema. However, Musser and Carleton (1993, 2005) and Flannery (1995) later proposed that the species Hinton described should be classified as Hydromys shawmayeri, closely related but distinct from H. habbema, based on the fact that they are easily distinguished by external and cranial traits,. In 2005 Helgen proposed that generic name of Baiyankamys be used for shawmayeri and habbema, removing them both from the genus Hydromys. This was due to morphological differences in phallic anatomy, and many external and craniodental traits. Appearance Baiyankamys is distinguished by soft, dense, frosted grey upperparts; a tail that is longer than its head-body length; a long, narrow snout, and extremely narrow incisors. Habitat Baiyankamys habbema is found in a small region of the upper montane forests of the Snow Mountains of western New Guinea, between 2800 and 3600 m. Baiyankamys shawmayeri is found in lower to upper montane forests between 1500 and 2600 m in eastern and central highlands regions of Papua New Guinea.

He is known as Khateeb-e-Millat (\\"Orator of the Nation\\") by his followers. He is the son of Khateeb-e-A‚Äôzam Muhammad Shafee Okarvi, who was founder of the Jamaa'at-e-Ahle-Sunnat, main Sunni Barelvi organisation of Pakistan. Early life and education Okarvi was born in Karachi, Pakistan. Before his birth in a family of eleven brothers and sisters, His two eldest brothers had died. He is from a business family of Yeman who accepted Islam through Abu Bakr. The members of his family came to India for business and settled there hundreds of years ago. His elders were mostly businessmen by profession but personally they had spiritual temperament in nature. In his book, Deoband to Bareilly he writes, \\"To tell you the truth, I am a mere seeker of knowledge in the fields of religion, spirituality, and scholastic matters. This little bit recognition of letters and words and the skills of experimenting with them that have come to me, it is mostly because of my environment which was due to my kind parents, paternal grandfather, maternal grandmother, teachers and holy people. These revered and respected personalities have guided my learning at every stage of my life.\\" Okarvi's early childhood was spent in Okara, Pakistan. He received his early religious and worldly education at Jaami‚Äôah Ashraf ul Madaris in Okara. He memorized the Quran at the age of eleven years, taught by Muhammad Abdul Lateef Amjad Sa‚Äôeedi.

At the age of 13 he established an organization of students and youth called \\"Bazm-e-Shaheen Pakistan\\". Its main purpose was to inculcate religious principles, support poor students, and organize competitions of Qira‚Äôat, Na‚Äôat and speeches and to celebrate Islamic festivals. He also took leave from the school for one and a half years so he could memorize the Qur'an. In 1957 and 1971, during the war between Pakistan and India, he collaborated with the National Defense and Boys Scouts.

In 1964 he received discipleship in Salaasil-e-Tareeqat on the holy hand of Ghaus-e-Zamaan Ganj-e- Karam Peer Saiyyid Muhammad Ismaa‚Äôeel Shah Bukhaari known as Karmaa Waala. Later he received discipleship of blessing (Baie‚Äôat-e-Tabarruk) on the hands of Saiyyid Ahmad Saeed Kaazimi and from the family of Ghaus-e-A‚Äôzam from Peer Saiyyid Taahir ‚ÄòAlaa-ud-deen Geelaani. He has spiritual permission from many Sufi saints of the Arab and non-Arab world. Okarvi's disciples are all over the world.

In 1967 his first radio program was broadcast. He received ten rupees for a show and in 1969 he appeared on television, for which he received twenty rupees for a show. To date, three thousands of his shows have been televised. In twenty eight years after the departing of his beloved father he has only been able to thoroughly explain seven parts of the holy Qur'an, due to his research in each topic in the Friday congregation in Jaame Masjid Gulzar-e-Habeeb, Karachi. His live and recorded shows are broadcast regularly from many TV channels in Pakistan. In many foreign countries like the Middle East, Africa, India, U.S., U.K and Bangladesh his television shows are televised. He is interviewed by many prominent TV personalities on different magazines, newspapers. Personal life When asked why he has no interest in politics, he replied, \\"I can't lie, I don't like hypocrisy and breaking promises. I don't want to gather bad prayers (du‚Äôaa) of the people. There are only two topics of my life: purity and sincerity. Everything which is pure; it is good. People should not sit idle they should work and stay busy. I demand perfection and quality in everything. Whoever work it may be it should be good.\\" When asked how he developed his humor he replied, \\"Gham Sehh kar Hansna Hansaana Aa gaya\\" (\\"I learned to laugh and make others laugh after enduring pain\\").

I witnessed this strange phenomenon among the adherents of Islam living in my own homeland and also far away from the homeland that they are after (each other‚Äôs throat) their own collars. Why point accusing fingers at others? Even the so-called wayfarers of the road to Madinah, the preachers are changing the truth and truthfulness, and the standard-bearers of peace and security (self-proclaimed) are with their tongues, pens and deeds, disgracing their own Millat and group, their own Masjid and pulpit.\\" The book was first published in English by Maulana Okarvi Academy (Al-A'lami) in South Africa and then in Urdu in Pakistan.

The head of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) compared the deluge to the Kevin Costner film Waterworld. In response to the flooding, the NDRRMC allocated approximately worth of relief funds and deployed 202 personnel to assist in search and rescue missions. The search and rescue missions were hampered by strong currents in flooded streets. Philippine President Benigno Aquino ordered officials to maximize the effort on rescuing and aiding affected residents. On 8 August, more than 1 million families were already affected.

In Anhui Province, officials temporarily closed access to the Huangshan mountain range, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Approximately 19,000 people in the area were also evacuated due to the threat of high winds and heavy rain. Across Zhejiang Province, Haikui caused widespread and severe damage.

Local officials \\"vowed to make all-out efforts to locate the missing\\" according to the Xinhua News Agency. Local residents feared the death toll could rise significantly as many people living in the area were undocumented migrant workers from other provinces. There has also been criticism over the effectiveness of the rescue effort, with one resident stating that it took an hour for rescue personnel to arrive in the area after the dam collapsed. Hospitals around the disaster area were reportedly overwhelmed with an influx of casualties stemming from the collapse, though no number was stated.

Known locally as the Polish Museum, it is housed in a lumber yard office built by the Laird-Norton Lumber Company in 1890. The Polish Cultural Institute The north side of the building with Polish and U.S. flags The Laird-Norton Building was purchased in 1977 by Father Paul Breza, a Winona-born priest of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Winona. It was intended to store historical materials pertaining to Polish immigrants in Winona, but disagreements within Winona's Polish community led to the formation of two separate organizations: the Polish Heritage Society and the Polish Cultural Institute. Under Fr. Breza's leadership, the Polish Cultural Institute was formally incorporated in 1979 to continue renovating the Polish Museum and to otherwise foster an appreciation of Polish contributions to the Winona community.http://polishmuseumwinona.org/ The status of Winona as \\"Kashubian Capital of America\\" is also recognized by the Polish Museum. In 2010, the Polish Heritage Society inducted Fr. Breza into its Polish Heritage Hall of Fame, formalizing a reconciliation between the two organizations. The Winona Post, April 8, 2010 Plans are underway for the Polish Heritage Society to be merged into the Polish Cultural Institute. Another Kashubian-American activist associated with the Polish Cultural Institute is the writer and educator Anne Pellowski, who was born in Trempealeau County, Wisconsin, but attended high school in Winona and lives there in her retirement. The Polish Museum The first floor of the Museum building contains exhibits and other materials relating to Polish immigrant life in Winona and the surrounding areas. A gift shop offers for sale books, clothing, music and other items, many of which are imported from Poland. In recent years, two nearby buildings have been acquired: the Schultz House is being renovated to serve as a heritage house, and the Annex serves as a site for cultural events, such as dances and musical performances. The Annex also features a 165-foot mural illustrating the lives and contributions of Polish immigrant families in Winona. The Diocesan Collection The second floor of the Museum building is devoted to a collection of artifacts recovered from churches in the Diocese of Winona, such as the Basilica of Saint Stanislaus Kostka. While this collection has been acquired and curated by Fr. Breza, the items themselves remain the property of the Diocese. The collection is extremely extensive and includes statuary, sanctuary furniture, vestments, and other semi-forgotten accoutrements of nineteenth-century Polish Catholicism in the United States. Occasionally, items from the collections are lent out to area Catholic churches seeking to enhance the historicity of their worship spaces. Cultural Activities The Polish Cultural Institute has always been active in fostering an understanding of Polish culture, whether the immigrant culture of Winona or that of modern Poland. In recent years, as appreciation of Kashubian-American culture has increased, the Polish Cultural Institute has featured Kaszubian customs (such as the Blessing of Flowers and \\"Smaczne Jablka\\" or Apple Fest) and reached out to Kaszubian Poles, especially in the town of Bytow, which is one of Winona's sister cities. One regular activity is the exchange of high school students between Bytow and Winona. Winona Daily News, August 2, 2012 Another is musical presentations at the Annex, which range from local polka bands to the performance of recently discovered music written by Polish immigrants.

The central issue concerned the construction of statutes relating to mechanic's liens and how they attach to land and the oil and gas severed from it, which issue had generated conflicting rulings in the Canadian courts. Background Earl F. Wakefield Company had entered into an arrangement with Harding and McMullen and commenced drilling an oil well before 10 September 1949. On 19 September, Harding and McMullen incorporated Oil City Petroleums (Leduc) Ltd., which entered into a formal contract with Wakefield on the matter. On 24 September, Oil City entered into an agreement with other companies (including the assignee of the oil lease in the property) and H. and M., therein described as \\"agents\\", wherein it was recited that the latter \\"have assisted in arranging for the drilling of the said wells\\" and Oil City covenanted to \\"commence to drill or cause to be commenced to be drilled\\" the well which had in fact been commenced by the plaintiff. Drilling was suspended on 23 September by Wakefield because of non-payment by Oil City, and Wakefield registered mechanic's liens in October 1949 and commenced actions within the time limit prescribed. About three months after the cessation of work, arrangements were made with others under which the well was completed and brought into production. In June 1950, a receiver was appointed to sell the oil won, and, subject to stated deductions, to deposit the proceeds in a special trust account to the credit of the action. The plaintiff's action did not come to trial until more than six years had elapsed from the registration of the lien, and no renewal statement had been filed as required by what was then s. 29(7) of The Mechanics' Lien Act of Alberta.The Mechanics' Lien Act, RSA 1942, c. 236, having become RSA 1955, c, 197 at the time of the SCC ruling, subsequently replaced by The Mechanics Lien Act, 1960, SA 1960, c. 64, which itself was replaced by the current Builders' Lien Act, RSA 2000, c. B-7 The courts below In the Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, McLaurin C.J.T.D. held that the lien was valid, and duly entered judgment against all defendants. On appeal to the Appellate Division, the judgment was reversed. In the majority ruling by Porter J.A., it was held that there was no evidence that disclosed facts that supported the plaintiff's entitlement to any of the moneys held by the trustee. A concurring ruling by McBride and Johnson JJ.A. held that if such liens did arise they had ceased to exist before the date of the trial of the action, by reason of the failure of the appellant to file a renewal statement as required by the Act. The Appellate Division's ruling was overturned on appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, which held: :* unanimously that a valid lien in favour of the plaintiff arose in 1949 for the value of the work actually doneEarl F. Wakefield Company v. Oil City Petroleums (Leduc) Ltd. et al., per Rand J at p. 369370 :* by 3-2 that, while the lien on the land ceased to exist because of the failure to file the necessary renewal statement before the expiration of six years, the transferred lien or charge on the moneys in the hands of the receiver was not affected by this failureEarl F. Wakefield Company v. Oil City Petroleums (Leduc) Ltd. et al., per Locke J at p. 376 Ponoka-Calmar Oils Ltd. and American Leduc Petroleums Limited were assignees of some of the oil leases on which drilling had taken place, and were respondents in the action at hand. They appealed the issue of their liability in the matter to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Ruling by the Privy Council In a ruling delivered by Viscount Simonds, it was held that the SCC's ruling was correct. Because of the nature of the agreements that had been executed, both appellants were considered to be \\"owners\\" within the meaning of the Alberta Act, and were thus included within the liability for the liens that had attached.

The dolls, a spin-off of the company's popular franchise Bratz. Bratzillaz dolls are marketed as witches with special powers that make each character unique. The Bratzillaz girls are cousins of the Bratz and most of the characters have a similar name to a Bratz character. Starting with the Summer/Fall 2013 doll lines, MGA began to use \\"House of Witchez\\" in the main logo to emphasize the Bratzillaz's \\"witchy\\" nature after they were thought to be copying Monster High, a line of monster-themed fashion dolls by MGA's competitor Mattel. The commercials for the \\"Back to Magic\\" and \\"Witchy Princesses\\" lines never said Bratzillaz in them, only \\"House of Witchez\\". Due to the hiatus that MGA took in 2014 to rebuild the Bratz brand, production of Bratzillaz dolls ended and they were discontinued. Dolls Each doll (with the exception of the Core (Basic Line) dolls) has glass eyes with an articulated, posable body. The dolls come with a broom hair brush, and some come with a spell scroll and a doll stand. Some have a unique pet, which is sold separately, and most have a personal witch mark symbol. Character cards come with the first edition dolls. They reveal augmented reality content when held up to a webcam: virtual doll animation and a character video. The Core (Basic Line) dolls are part of an inexpensive budget line and have a non- articulated body and painted eyes as opposed to the usual glass eyes. =Releases= Summer/Fall 2012 *First Edition (Basic Line) - Yasmina Clairvoya, Meygana Broomstix, Sashabella Paws, Cloetta Spelletta, and Jade J'Adore. *Pets - Winkers, Wingzy, Fluffinscruff, Barkthalameow, and Kissifuss. *Fashion Packs - Midnight Magic, Changed-Up Chic, Blood Red Charm, Romantic Spell, and True Blue Style. *Accessory Packs - Academy Style, Wicked Night Out, and Charmed Life. *Cafe Zap Playset *Crystal Ball Set *Secret Message Pad Winter/Spring 2013 *Midnight Beach - Yasmina, Meygana, Sashabella, Cloetta, Jade, and Fianna Fins.

Website and media The official Bratzillaz website launched in July 2012. The website included character bios, parallax scrolling, and games. In a first for MGA Entertainment, Bratzillaz games are available on apps for smartphones. It was closed on 2016. =Webisodes= On July 13, 2012, the official theme song for the dolls was revealed in a live-action music video, which was shot at the Canfield-Moreno Estate. In August, MGA released the first Bratzillaz webisode to the official website and YouTube channel. A second webisode was released weeks later on September 11, 2012. The first season aired until January 4, 2013. A second season was expected to be released due to a leaked unreleased webisode titled \\"Fashion Bites\\" and parts of it being featured at the end of \\"Midnight Beach\\" when Yasmina looks into the future. However, due to MGA taking a hiatus with the Bratz line in 2014 to rebuild the brand, production of the dolls ended and a second season was never completed. From June 24, 2013 to July 22, 2013, there was a short series of videos about the Witchy Princesses titled \\"Witchy Princesses Adventure\\" which was not considered part of the webisode series. =Witchy Princesses Adventure= * \\"Week One\\" (June 24, 2013) The Bratzillaz seek for information about the Witchy Princesses after Sashabella hears the three birds of the three Princesses crying. * \\"Week Two\\" (July 1, 2013) The Bratzillaz seek to find a book about the Witchy Princesses, only to find it is missing pages. * \\"Week Three\\" (July 8, 2013) The Bratzillaz look for two of the pages in Caf√© Zap and in the Toola Twins' room. * \\"Week Four\\" (July 15, 2013) The Bratzillaz look for the third missing page to finally restore the book. * \\"Week Five\\" (July 22, 2013) The Bratzillaz repair the book to discover what happened to the Witchy Princesses. Characters =Bratzillaz= The Bratzillaz are the witch cousins of the Bratz, according to the Bratzillaz theme song. Also according to the song, it was revealed that all of the Bratzillaz found out their witchy identities at age 16. Yasmina Clairvoya is assumed to be the cousin of Yasmin, Cloetta Spelletta is Cloe's cousin; Meygana Broomstix is Meygan's cousin (Though Meygan was never the main character in the Bratz franchise); also Sashabella Paws is the Bratz' Sasha's cousin though Sashabella is nicknamed \\"Sasha\\", which is her human cousin's name, by Cloetta in the episode \\"Pur-Fecting Boy Chat\\". Also Jade J'Adore is the cousin of Jade, having the same first name as Jade, her cousin. The others are original characters with only Fianna being based on another Brat. Vampelina, Victoria Antique, Illiana Honestly, and Angelica Sound are all original characters. Each Bratzilla has a witch's birthmark known as a \\"witchmark\\". Unlike the original Bratz, the Bratzillaz all have revealed last names. None of them are the cousins of the Bratz shown in the Bratz television series: the franchise about a magazine; though the webisodes of Bratzillaz (House of Witchez) do have a pair of evil blond female twins. Main Bratzillaz Yasmina Clairvoya - (similar to Yasmin): Yasmina has the power to see the future. She loves vintage romantic looks, retro style and funky braided hair. With her spellbinding style and oddball pet, Winkers, she stands out as a unique individual. Her witchmark is an Egyptian eye, and her color is purple. She is very dedicated to always having good fashion, as in the web series for the webisode: \\"Rrr-runway\\", when Sashabella said: \\"Exactly. Imagine how you would feel if you had no stylish clothes\\", Yasmina responded with: \\"Are you trying to give me nightmares?\\" Yasmina's surname \\"Clairvoya\\" is a pun on the word \\"clairvoyant\\", referring to her witch power to predict the future. Introduced in the Summer/Fall 2012 First Edition basic line as one of the core five girls. She is the Bratz girl Yasmin's witch cousin. Cloetta Spelletta - (similar to Cloe): Cloetta and her mixed up cat/dog pet, Barkthalameow, has the power to mutate people into anything they want. She adores two-tone fashions, over-the-knee boots, sparkly capes and hair that goes straight and curly. She loves looks in two-sided colors. Her witchmark is a moon & stars, and her colors are pink and black. She has heterochromia. Cloetta's family name \\"Spelletta\\" is a play on the word \\"spell\\" referring to her metamorphosis magic. Introduced in the Summer/Fall 2012 First Edition basic line as one of the core five girls. She is the Cloe Brat's cousin. Meygana Broomstix - (similar to Meygan): Meygana and her winged pet, Wingzy, not only have the power to fly, but also make dreams come true. She loves all shades of the blue sky, late night parties, cloud hopping, fluttery capes and helping people's wildest dreams take flight. She loves sporty supernatural looks. Her witchmark is a pair of wings, and her color is blue. Meygana's last name \\"Broomstix\\" refers to how in traditional witch folklore or stereotypes of witches float on a broomstick. The name is a reference to the term \\"broomsticks\\", which is also referring to her ability to \\"make dreams take flight\\". Even Meygana's ditzy and free-spirited personality represents her power. Introduced in the Summer/Fall 2012 First Edition basic line as one of the core five girls. She is Meygan's cousin. Sashabella Paws - (similar to Sasha): Sashabella has the animal kingdom under her spell; she can communicate with creatures everywhere. Her favorite animal to talk to is her pet furball, Fluffinscruff. She loves mixing up faux fur with fuzzy boots. She also loves other fur clothing. Her witchmark is a tribal cat, and her color is light green. Her last name is a pun on the fact that her ability is \\"animal chat\\". Introduced in the Summer/Fall 2012 First Edition basic line as one of the core five girls. Sasha from Bratz is her cousin. Jade J'Adore - (similar to Jade): Jade loves everything about love. With her devilish pet love monster, Kissifuss, by her side, she has the power to heal a broken heart. She loves punky glam looks, luxurious lace, mysterious eyes and hearts on everything. She also loves urban witchy looks. Her witchmark is a heart arrow, and her color is red. Jade's surname is a pun on the French word \\"j'adore\\" which can mean \\"I love it\\" or \\"I adore it.\\" Introduced in the Summer/Fall 2012 First Edition basic line as one of the core five girls. Her human cousin is Jade. Other Bratzillaz The minor characters who can also be called \\"Bratzillaz\\" also consist of witches with surnames based on their powers. The only one who is not a witch is Vampelina, being a vampiress, or at least being a vampiric witch. Their abilities are linked in their names. While Vampelina can see in the dark because she is a vampire, the other minor Bratzillaz have abilities that only a solid witch would have. Fianna is a \\"sea witch\\": similar to a mermaid but is not exactly a mermaid. Vampelina was shown to be a friend of Jade in \\"Midnight Beach\\". All of them have personalities that match up with their abilities and their surnames. Fianna Fins - (similar to Fianna): Fianna is a sea witch who has the power to control weather. Her pet is Ripple. Her witchmark is a mermaid tail. Introduced in the Winter/Spring 2013 Midnight Beach line. Her human cousin is Fianna. Vampelina - Vampelina is a vampiress who has the power to see in the dark.

Victoria Antique - Victoria is an exchange student from China who has the power to turn old things back to new. Being from the country of China may or may not be a nod to her ability to fix old things, since some people in real life collect a substance called \\"china\\", which people use for many years as a decoration. Her witchmark is a snake. Introduced in the Summer/Fall 2013 Back to Magic line. Illiana Honesty - Illiana is an exchange student from India who has the power to make anyone tell the truth.

Notes * In the UK and other countries, the First Edition basic dolls came with the pets included. * The black-and-white witch featured in the Switch-a- Witch Wave 1 Double Pack can be seen as a background character in many of the webisodes, but was not given a name so she is not an official character. * The Cafe Zap playset is also sometimes called Starbrews, though the official name is Cafe Zap. * The Summer/Fall 2013 season was the only season not to feature Yasmina and Cloetta, two of the five core Bratzillaz. However, their Bratz counterparts, Yasmin and Cloe, are the two most produced Bratz dolls. * Despite the fact, that the 2013 commercials only says \\"House Of Witchez\\" in them, the UK versions of both commercials also say \\"Bratzillaz\\" in some places.

Microbial food cultures carry out the fermentation process in foodstuffs. Used by humans since the Neolithic period (around 10 000 years BC) fermentation helps to preserve perishable foods and to improve their nutritional and organoleptic qualities (in this case, taste, sight, smell, touch). As of 1995, fermented food represented between one quarter and one third of food consumed in Central Europe. More than 260 different species of microbial food culture are identified and described for their beneficial use in fermented food products globally, showing the importance of their use. The scientific rationale of the function of microbes in fermentation started to be built with the discoveries of Louis Pasteur in the second half of the 19th century. Extensive scientific study continues to characterize microbial food cultures traditionally used in food fermentation taxonomically, physiologically, biochemically and genetically. This allows better understanding and improvement of traditional food processing and opens up new fields of applications.  Historical overview  Microorganisms are the earliest form of life on earth, first evolving more than three billion years ago. Our ancestors discovered how to harness the power of microorganisms to make new foods, even if they did not know the science behind what they were doing. Milestones 1665‚ÄîRobert Hooke and Antoni Van Leeuwenhoek first observe and describe microorganisms. 1857‚Äì1876‚ÄîLouis Pasteur proves the function of microorganisms in lactic and alcoholic fermentation. 1881‚ÄîEmil Christian Hansen isolates Saccharomyces carlsbergensis, a pure yeast culture, which is today widely used in brewing of lager beers. 1889‚Äì1896‚ÄîHerbert William Conn, Vilhelm Storch and Hermann Weigmann demonstrate that bacteria are responsible for the acidification of milk and of cream. 1897‚ÄîEduard von Freudenreich isolates Lactobacillus brevis. 1919‚ÄîSigurd Orla-Jensen classifies lactic acid bacteria on the basis of the bacteria's physiological response patterns. Starting from 1970s‚Äîproduction of first industrial concentrated cultures, frozen or freeze-dried cultures, for the direct inoculation of processed milk, improving the regularity of production processes.  Function of microbial food cultures in food  Microbial food cultures preserve food through formation of inhibitory metabolites such as organic acid (lactic acid, acetic acid, formic acid, propionic acid), ethanol, bacteriocins, etc., often in combination with decrease of water activity (by drying or use of salt). Further, microbial food cultures help to improve food safety through inhibition of pathogens or removing of toxic compounds. Microbial food cultures also improve the nutritional value and organoleptic quality of the food. The microbial food cultures used in food fermentation can be divided into three major groups: bacteria, yeasts and moulds. = Bacteria = Bacterial food cultures can be divided into starter cultures and probiotics. Starter cultures have mainly a technological function in the food manufacturing. They are used as food ingredients at one or more stages in the food manufacturing process and develop the desired metabolic activity during the fermentation or ripening process. They contribute to the one or multiple unique properties of a foodstuff especially in regard to taste, flavour, colour, texture, safety, preservation, nutritional value, wholesomeness and/or health benefits. Probiotics have a functional role, which refers to the ability of certain microbes to confer health benefits to the consumer. Generally, the bacteria used as starter culture are not the same used as probiotics. There are, however, cases when one bacterium can be used both as starter culture and as probiotic. The scientific community is presently trying to deepen understanding of the roles played by microbes in food processing and human health. The most important bacteria in food manufacturing are Lactobacillus species, belonging to the group of lactic acid bacteria. Bacterial food cultures are responsible for the aroma, taste and texture of cheeses and fermented milk products such as yogurts, ayran, doogh, skyr or ymer. They contribute to developing the flavour and colour of such fermented products as salami, pepperoni and dried ham. Lactic acid bacteria converts the unstable malic acid that is naturally present in wine into the stable lactic acid. This malolactic fermentation gives the stability that is characteristic of high-quality wines that improve on storage. Lactic acid bacteria are also used in food supplements as probiotics which help to restore the balance in human intestinal biota. = Yeasts = The most familiar yeast in food production, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been used in brewing and baking for thousands of years. S. cerevisiae feeds on the sugars present in the bread dough and produces the gas carbon dioxide. This forms bubbles within the dough, causing it to expand and the bread to rise. Several different yeasts are used in brewing beer, where they ferment the sugars present in malted barley to produce alcohol. One of the most common is S. cerevisiae. The same strain of S. cerevisiae which can also be used in breadmaking is used to make ale-type beers. It is known as a top-fermenting yeast because it creates a foam on the top of the brew. Bottom-fermenting yeasts, such as S. pastorianus, are more commonly used to make lagers. They ferment more of the sugars in the mixture than top-fermenting yeasts, which gives a cleaner taste. The alcohol in wine is formed by the fermentation of the sugars in grape juice, with carbon dioxide as a by-product. Yeast is naturally present on grapeskins, and this alone can be sufficient for the fermentation of sugars to alcohol to occur. A pure yeast culture, most often S. cerevisiae, is usually added to ensure the fermentation is reliable. Other yeast cultures like Pichia, Torulaspora and Kluyveromyces are naturally present or added to create special flavours in the wine. Sparkling wine, including champagne, is made by adding further yeast to the wine when it is bottled. The carbon dioxide formed in this second fermentation is trapped as bubbles. Yeasts are also used to produce kefir products, semi-soft ripened cheeses and fermented soy drinks. = Moulds = Three main types of cheese rely on moulds for their characteristic properties: blue cheese, soft ripened cheese (such as camembert and brie) and rind-washed cheese (such as √©poisses and taleggio). To make blue cheese, the cheese is treated with a mould, usually Penicillium roqueforti, while it is still in the loosely pressed curd form. As the cheese matures, the mould grows, creating blue veins within it which gives the cheese its characteristic flavour. Examples include stilton, roquefort and gorgonzola. Soft ripened cheese such as brie and camembert are made by allowing P. camemberti to grow on the outside of the cheese, which causes them to age from the outside in. The mould forms a soft white crust, and the interior becomes runny with a strong flavour. Rind-washed cheeses like limburger also ripen inwards, but here, as the name suggests, they are washed with brine and other ingredients such as beer and wine which contain mould. This also makes them attractive to bacteria, which add to the flavour. Traditionally, inoculations of sausages with moulds were done with the indigenous biota of the slaughters. Different moulds (such as P. chrysogenum and P. nalgiovense) can be used to ripen surfaces of sausages. The mould cultures develop the aroma and improve the texture of the sausages. They also contribute to shortening of the ripening period and preserving the natural quality. This expands the shelf life of the meat product. In the past, soy sauce has been made by mixing soybeans and other grains with a mould (Aspergillus oryzae or A. sojae) and yeast. This mixture was then left to ferment in the sun. Today soy sauce is made under controlled conditions. The key flavour ingredients formed in this process are salts of the amino acid glutamic acid, notably monosodium glutamate.  Production of microbial food cultures  The industrial production of microbial food cultures is carried out after careful selection process and under strictly controlled conditions. First, the microbiology laboratory, where the original strains are kept, prepares the inoculation material, which is a small quantity of microbes of a single (pure) strain. Then, the inoculation material is multiplied and grown either in fermenters (liquid) or on a surface (solid) under defined and monitored conditions. Grown cells of pure culture are harvested, eventually blended with other cultures and, finally, formulated (preserved) for subsequent transportation and storage. They are sold in liquid, frozen or freeze-dried formats. Another and traditional way of starting a food fermentation is often referred to as spontaneous fermentation. Cultures come from raw milk, i.e. milk that has not undergone any sanitation treatment or from the reuse of a fraction of the previous production (back-slopping). The composition of such cultures is complex and extremely variable. The use of such techniques is steadily decreasing in developed countries. Some countries even prohibit the back- slopping technique because of the \\"potential to magnify pathogen loads to very dangerous levels\\".  Safety and regulatory aspects  Microbial food cultures are considered as traditional food ingredients and are permitted in the production of foodstuffs all over the world under general food laws. Commercially available microbial food cultures are sold as preparations, which are formulations, consisting of concentrates of one or more microbial species and/or strains including unavoidable media components carried over from the fermentation and components, which are necessary for their survival, storage, standardisation and to facilitate their application in the food production process. Safety of microbial food cultures, depending on their characteristics and use, can be based on genus, species or strain levels. = Microorganisms with documented history of safe use in food = The first (non-exhaustive) inventory of microorganisms with a documented history of useHealth Canada, 2003. Amendment (Schedule No. 948) to Division 28 of the Food and Drug Regulations, Sections B.28.001‚Äì003. Food and Drugs Regulations in food was for the first time compiled in 2001 by the International Dairy Federation (IDF) and the European Food and Feed Cultures Association (EFFCA). In 2012, this inventory was updated. It now covers a wide range of food applications (including dairy, fish, meat, beverages and vinegar) and features a reviewed taxonomy of microorganisms. = US = In the United States of America, microbial food cultures are regulated under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Section 409 of the 1958 Food Additives Amendment of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, exempts from the definition of food additives substances generally recognized by experts as safe (GRAS) under conditions of their intended use. These substances do not require premarket approval by the US Food and Drug Administration. Because there are various ways to obtain GRAS status for microbial food cultures, there is no exhaustive list of microbial food cultures having GRAS status in the US. = European Union = Within the European Union, microbial food cultures are regarded as food ingredients and are regulated by Regulation 178/2002, commonly referred to as the General Food Law. Since 2007, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has been maintaining a list of microorganisms having qualified presumption of safety (QPS). The QPS list covers only a limited number of microorganisms, which have been referred to EFSA for safety assessment.Anon, 2005. EFSA Scientific Colloquium‚ÄîMicroorganisms in Food and Feed:Qualified Presumption of Safety ‚Äî 13‚Äì14 December 2004, Brussels, Belgium. . It has been conceived as an internal evaluation tool for microorganisms used in the food production chain (e.g. feed cultures, cell factories producing enzymes or additives, plant protection) that need an evaluation by EFSA scientific panels before being marketed in the EU. Microbial food cultures with a long history of safe use are, however, considered to be traditional food ingredients and are legally permitted for use in human food without EFSA evaluation.  Denmark  From 1974 to 2010 Denmark required premarket approval of microbial food cultures. The positive list of microbial food cultures is available on the website of the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration. In 2010, the regulation changed. Approval is no longer needed but a notification should be made to the Veterinary and Food Administration.

If the holder's nationality is shown as a British overseas territories citizen; a British overseas citizen; a British subject; a British national (overseas); or a British protected person then the holder will not be able to use the ePassport gates. citizens of the following countries holding valid biometric passports became eligible to use ePassport gates, provided that they are aged either 18 and over or 12 and over travelling with an adult: {style=\\" ; background-color: white; border: 1px solid white; padding: 5px;\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  * Australia * Canada * Japan * New Zealand valign=top * Singapore * South Korea * United States } Upon successfully using the ePassport gates, citizens of the above countries entering as a visitor are granted 6 months' leave to enter (subject to conditions prohibiting employment and recourse to public funds)The Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order 2000, Article 8B (as amended by ) and do not receive a passport stamp or any written notice/endorsement.The Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order 2000, Article 8ZC (as amended by ) However, citizens of the above countries who wish to enter the UK as a short-term student (for up to 6 months), with a Tier 5 (Temporary Worker - Creative and Sporting) Certificate of Sponsorship (for up to 3 months), on a permitted paid engagement, or to accompany or join an EU/EEA/Swiss citizen family member are not eligible to use the ePassport gates, as a passport stamp must be obtained in these situations.

For example, landlords are legally required to check the immigration status of tenants before the start of a tenancy agreement.Immigration Act 2014, section 22 The Home Office advises that where a prospective tenant is a non-visa national who used an ePassport gate to enter the UK, the landlord should accept any documentary evidence (such as a ticket or boarding pass) that establishes the date of arrival in the UK within the past 6 months. Use To use the ePassport gates, the traveller must have a biometric passport from the United Kingdom and certain other countries (these ePassports have the biometric logo on the front cover). The ePassport gate scanner reads all the information contained in the chip inside the passport, while a camera takes a picture of the traveller and an officer at a control station behind the gates checks that the image captured by the camera matches the one on the passport (facial recognition). Once the data verification and facial recognition process is complete, doors will automatically either open, signifying that the traveller is permitted to enter the country, or remain closed and a stop icon illuminate, demonstrating that the traveller has failed the security checks and will personally meet with immigration officials. Availability At present, ePassport gates are available at the following locations: * Birmingham Airport * Bristol Airport * Cardiff Airport * East Midlands Airport * Edinburgh Airport * Eurostar Brussels-South Terminal (juxtaposed controls) * Eurostar Paris Nord Terminal (juxtaposed controls) * Gatwick Airport (both terminals) * Glasgow Airport * Heathrow Airport (all terminals) * London City Airport * Luton Airport * Manchester Airport (all terminals) * Newcastle Airport * Stansted Airport Suspension At some airports, the UK Border Force temporarily suspends the operation of ePassport gates when certain flights that are deemed to be 'high risk' arrive. For example, at Glasgow Airport, the UK Border Force has on occasions disabled the operation of ePassport gates when flights arrive from Romania, as it regards those flights to be 'high risk' from a safeguarding perspective. By requiring all arriving passengers to use a staffed immigration counter, UK Border Force officers are better able to identify potential victims of trafficking and modern slavery.

Northup was a fairly early settler of Providence in the Rhode Island colony, but accounts claiming that he settled the area with Roger Williams are inaccurate, since Northup was an infant or child when Williams first came to Providence in the spring of 1636. Northup lived in Providence from 1655 to 1666, after which he moved to the Narragansett country (what is now North Kingstown, Rhode Island), which land was claimed by both the Rhode Island and Connecticut colonies. He may have owned or operated a grist mill, and is credited with building a house that still stands and is used as a private residence. Northup was married, had six known children, and lived until at least 1687, when he was taxed. He was the great grandfather of Capt. Henry Northup who left Rhode Island to settle in Hoosick, New York, and took his slave Mintus who was manumitted in 1797. Mintus assumed the surname Northup, and had a free-born son, Solomon Northup, the subject of the Academy Award-winning film 12 Years a Slave.  Providence  The origins of Stephen Northup are unknown. Published sources are silent as to his provenance, but online sources have offered two possibilities. One is that he was born in 1633 as the son of Hampton Northup of Flintshire, Wales. The other is that he was born in 1625, the son of Henry Northup of Whaddon, Cambridgeshire, England. Though there is no marriage record, and the name of his wife does not appear in any public record, online sources indicate that Northup married about 1654 Elizabeth Harrington, the daughter of Benjamin Harrington, and genealogist Virginia Chappell also says that his wife was a daughter of Benjamin Harrington. Austin's Genealogical Dictionary of Rhode Island does not show a Benjamin Harrington, but does show a Benjamin Hearnden with wife Elizabeth and nine children, but no daughter Elizabeth. As it turns out, these two Benjamins are the same person, and though the name of the family in the early records favors \\"Hearnden\\", most descendants use the name \\"Harrington\\" or \\"Herrington\\" with a few other intermediate spelling variants such as \\"Herrendine\\" or \\"Herrendeen\\". Despite no record showing Northup's wife to be a Hearnden/Harrington, there is a connection between the two families that is significant. In southern North Kingstown Rhode Island is a cemetery that is called the Ancient Northup Burial Ground (Rhode Island Historic Cemetery North Kingstown #51), and though most of the graves are only marked with field stones, there are some Northups that have inscribed markers, and there is also a crude handwritten inscription on a marker that reads \\"Ebenezer Hearrandain, desesed June 17, 1713. He worse borne June 21, 1681.\\" The Genealogical Dictionary of Rhode Island shows this Ebenezer to be a grandson of Benjamin Hearnden. So, here is a connection between the two families that lends credence to the supposition that Northup's wife may have been a Hearnden/Harrington. To make the relationship between the two families even more plausible, Staples, in 1843, published a list of 28 early Providence settlers who each received 25 acres of land, beginning in 1646. On this list of names is Stephen Northup, as well as Benjamin \\"Herendeen\\", the latter with his name signed by a mark, this very likely being a relative of Northup's wife. There has been misinterpretation as to when Stephen Northup arrived in Providence. The list in Staples' book giving the names of some early Providence settlers is dated \\"The 19th of 11 mo. 1645,\\" which means 19 January 1646, since in the Julian calendar in use, March was the first month, and January the 11th. The list consists of 28 individuals \\"whose names are hereafter subscribed, having obtained a free grant of Twenty-five acres of land, apiece...\\" However, Staples then notes that \\"The appearance of the signatures to the original document indicates they were not made at the same time.\\" Staples states that adjustments, written in the margin, were made to the original agreement \\"after the establishment of the Commonwealth of England,\\" which took place in 1649 and lasted until 1660. Therefore, the placement of Northup's name on the document may have taken place at a date later than 1646. The next record indicates that it was later, in fact many years later. With the exception of the preceding document, the first time Northup's name appears in a public record is on 2 October 1655 when \\"the town meetinge of Providence, in the Colony of Rhode Island, granted to Stephen Northup, twenty-five acres of land\\". This 1655 date should be considered his earliest arrival in Providence. On 27 August 1656, at another town meeting, \\"it was ordered that Stephen Northup have a home-lot laid out to him over against Christopher Smith's lot; also, that he have commonage equal to any other townsman; and that he be allowed to vote with the other inhabitants of the town.\\" He built his house at the north end of the town, between the main street and the Moshassuck River. Austin states that he was made a freeman in Providence in 1658, but this may just mean that his name appears on a list of freemen, because he had already been given the privilege of voting two years earlier. On 27 July 1659 Northup sold 60 acres of land at Rocky Hill to William Carpenter, and on 4 June 1660 he was selected as the Town Sergeant for Providence. During his service as sergeant John Clawson, a Dutchman and protege of Roger Williams, was murdered by an Indian not far from Northup's house. Northup then went about \\"warning the town about the prisoner,\\" and was paid three shillings for his efforts. Northup spent four days taking the prisoner to Newport and attending the trial. In 1662 Northup sold all of his rights to land between the Pawtucket and Pawtuxet Rivers to William Hawkins, and in 1665 he obtained a lot in a division of lands in Providence. The last record for him in Providence occurred when on 28 March 1666 he witnessed a deed there, but two months later his name does not appear on a list of those in Providence taking an oath of allegiance to the King, thus he had likely moved to Kingstowne by then.  Kingstowne  The house begun by Stephen Northup in the 17th century still stands in North Kingstown, Rhode Island. After leaving Providence, Northup moved to the Narragansett country, which was organized as Kingstowne in 1674, and later split into North Kingstown and South Kingstown in 1722, the former being where Northup lived. On 19 May 1671 he took the oath of allegiance here, and in August 1672 he was called to appear before the Connecticut court. The Narraganset country was in dispute between the Connecticut and Rhode Island colonies, and both jurisdictions claimed these lands. Northup's reply to the Connecticut court was, \\"I denie to obey any warrant from ye authority of Conecticot; if ye government of Roade Island send any I will obey them but not this warrant nor any from Conecticot Colony.\\" Sometime in the 1660s or 1670s Northup had purchased some of the Pettaquamscutt lands from Samuel Wilbur and other Pettaquamscutt purchasers. Title to the land was in dispute with the Humphrey Atherton Company, but on 5 December 1679 Northup and others were entitled to keep their lands. Northup had 120 acres of land on the west side of Pettaquamscot Pond, not far from the Gilbert Stuart Birthplace. He is last found in the public record in September 1687 when he was taxed 5s 1/2 d. There are so few extant records concerning Stephen Northup in Kingstowne, that much of the portrayal of his life there is anecdotal. For instance, his occupation does not appear in any existing records, but a family researcher in the 1930s, Lester Burgess, wrote this: \\"The Northups owned or operated the grist mill at the Gilbert Stuart place, the foundations of which are now (1939) barely visible. I believe the first dam there was built by old Stephen Northup.\\" The story of the Stephen Northup House is just as enigmatic. While an establishment date of 1660 appears in some sources, this date is problematical for two reasons, the first being that in 1675 and 1676 there was a devastating war in the area, and most historians agree that all houses south of Providence were destroyed during the war, with the noted exception of John Smith's stone-built \\"castle\\" in Warwick. The second reason is that Northup's residence in Providence continued at least through 1666, and there is no record of him in Kingstowne before 1671. There doesn't appear to be any documentary evidence supporting the 1660 construction of the house. The National Park Service, in their report on historic North Kingstown properties, only gives a general timeframe for the house's construction: \\"The Stephen Northup House at 99 Featherbed Lane is another house in which the seventeenth-century core has been preserved by an eighteenth-century addition.\\" North Kingstown historian, Tim Cranston, gives the date of the house as \\"1680-1690s\\" with additions made in the 18th and 19th centuries.  Family  Genealogical compiler John O. Austin only attributes four children to Northup and his wife, but family historian Virginia Chappell adds two more. Of the six children that have been credited to the couple, the oldest was likely Stephen (1660-1733), who married Mary Thomas of Jamestown and had eight children. The next son, Benjamin (1662-1750), married in 1681 Susannah Almy. He was originally buried in a small family plot on land that belonged to Wilbur Hazard, but was, before 1880, moved to Elm Grove Cemetery. However, the Elm Grove Cemetery book shows no record of his being buried there, so his marker may be defunct or illegible, or else he may not have had a marker moved to the new burial location. The next son, Henry (1663-1740) married Mary Kingsley and had four known children. The only daughter, Mary, married John Mowry and died in 1724. The next son, Joseph (died before 1726) was married and had several children, but the wife given him by Austin actually belongs to a nephew of Joseph. David, the presumed youngest son, (died in 1725) married Susanna Congdon, the daughter of Benjamin Congdon and Elizabeth Albro, and the granddaughter of Major John Albro who was an early magistrate of the colony. David and Susanna had four known children. Northup is an ancestor of Stephen Arnold Douglas, who sparred with Abraham Lincoln in a series of famous debates in 1858, prior to a senate race, and later lost to him in the 1860 presidential election.see Stephen A.

Dunaway on a horse-drawn limbers and caissons during a military funeral procession at Arlington National Cemetery, 2008. A military funeral in the United States is a memorial or burial rite conducted by the United States Armed Forces for a Soldier, Marine, Sailor, Coast Guardsman, or Airman who died in battle, a veteran, or other prominent military figures or a president. A military funeral may feature guards of honor, the firing of volley shots as a salute, drumming and other military elements, with a flag draping over the coffin. In the United States, the United States Army Military District of Washington (MDW) is responsible for providing military funerals. \\"Honoring Those Who Served\\" is the title of the program for instituting a dignified military funeral with full honors to the nation's veterans. As of January 1, 2000, Section 578 of Public Law 106-65 of the National Defense Authorization Act mandates that the United States Armed Forces shall provide the rendering of honors in a military funeral for any eligible veteran if requested by his or her family. As mandated by federal law, an honor guard detail for the burial of an eligible veteran shall consist of no fewer than two members of the Armed Forces. One member of the detail shall be a representative of the parent armed service of the deceased veteran. The honor guard detail will, at a minimum, perform a ceremony that includes the folding and presenting of the flag of the United States to the next of kin and the sounding of Taps which will be played by a lone bugler, if available, or by audio recording. Today, there are so few buglers available that the United States Armed Forces often cannot provide one. However, federal law allows Reserve and National Guard units to assist with funeral honors duty when necessary. Eligibility A military chaplain seen leading honor guards derived from the United States Marine Corps as they carry the casket of General Robert H. Barrow to the place of burial. Generally, federal law allows for military funeral honors for all veterans who were discharged under circumstances \\"other than dishonorable.\\" Funeral directors will require the veteran's DD Form 214 to establish eligibility. Those who are eligible for military funerals and full honors in the United States include the following: * Active duty or Selected Reserve in the United States Armed Forces. * Former active duty or Selected Reserve who departed under conditions other than dishonorable in the United States Armed Forces. * Former enlisted servicemen or servicewomen who completed at least one term or period of initial obligated service in the Selected Reserve and departed under conditions other than dishonorable. * Former servicemen or servicewomen who were discharged due to a disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty. Ceremony A bugler sounds Taps during the funeral of former United States Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger in Arlington National Cemetery, 2006.Escort platoons marching during the military funeral of Admiral Thomas Hinman Moorer in Arlington National Cemetery, 2004. In the United States, there are several types of military funerals such as those performed at Arlington National Cemetery, which include and omit certain components depending on the status of the deceased (active, retired, veteran, rank/occupation). Standard honor military funerals include the following: * A military chaplain for family members. * A casket draped in the flag of the United States and as a pall. * A casket team serving as honor guards in a ceremonial role over the remains and as pallbearers. * For funerals for an enlisted non-commissioned officer of E-9 and Officers, the casket is transported via a horse-drawn limbers and caissons. For all other funerals, the casket is transported using a hearse. * Fighter jets in missing man formation by the United States Air Force may perform an aerial flyover. * The formation of a rifle party consisting of an odd number of service members, between 3 and 7, will fire a three-volley salute (size varies according to the rank of the deceased). * The sounding of Taps is performed by a lone bugler or an audio recording, at a distance 30 to 50 yards from the grave site while a \\"Final Salute\\" is given. (In specific cases with the United States Military Academy, a muffled drum roll might accompany the bugler.) Full honor military funerals include all standard honors in addition to the following: * For funerals of commanding officers of O-6 (Colonel/Captain) and above, a caparisoned, riderless horse, symbolizing a fallen leader, will follow the limbers and caissons. * For funerals of general officers and flag officers of O-10 (four-star rank), a 17 gun salute is fired; O-9 (three-star rank), a 15 gun salute is fired; O-8 (two-star rank), a 13 gun salute is fired; O-7 (one- star rank), an 11 gun salute is fired. * A military band and an escort platoon participate (size varies according to the rank of the deceased). Armed forces military funerals include all standard and full honors in addition to the following: * Escort platoons from all five branches of the United States Armed Forces participate. * These funerals are reserved for the President of the United States (as commander-in-chief), the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and officers granted multiple-service command. * For funerals of presidents, a 21 gun salute using artillery and battery pieces is fired (not to be confused with a three-volley salute), while all other high state officials receive 19 gun salutes. When a spouse or other dependent of a current or former member of the United States Armed Forces is buried, the military service in which the primary party served will provide a casket team and a chaplain. No other military honors will be rendered unless the spouse served in the military. Sailors from the United States Navy fold the flag of the United States during a military funeral at Arlington National Cemetery for Captain Laurie Mosolino, a former United States Navy Medical Corps surgeon.Sequence for folding the flag of the United StatesMembers of the 86th Airlift Wing honor guard conduct a flag-folding ceremony at Ramstein Air Base, Germany, 2009.Inspector General of the Marine Corps Brigadier General Kenneth J. Lee presents a folded flag to Laurence E. Pope, the eldest son of Medal of Honor recipient Major Everett Pope during the burial service for Major Pope held at Arlington National Cemetery on September 15, 2009. The flag of the United States draped over the casket is meticulously folded thirteen times by a total of six honor guards, three on each side of the casket. When the flag is completely folded, the stars point upwards, which remind Americans of their national motto, In God We Trust. After the flag is completely folded and tucked in, it takes on the appearance of a tricorne hat, reminding Americans of the soldiers who served under General George Washington, and the sailors and Marines who served under Captain John Paul Jones, who were followed by their comrades and shipmates in the United States Armed Forces. An honor guard composed of one or more branches of the United States Armed Forces, presents the flag to the next of kin. The presenter, if possible a member of the same service as the deceased, will lean forward while presenting the folded flag, with the straight edge of the flag facing the recipient. The presenter then recites the following wording, which was standardized on April 20, 2012: Three spent shell-casings, each representing one of three volleys, were sometimes slipped into the folds of the flag before its presentation to the next of kin. The intention was to convey that the presence of the shell-casings proved that a rifle volley had taken place in connection with the member's funeral. However, this practice has become infrequent and is rarely seen today as Title 4, Section 8(h) of the United States Code specifies that the flag should not be used as a receptacle for holding anything. Ramp ceremonies A \\"ramp ceremony\\" is a memorial ceremony, not an actual funeral, for a soldier killed in a war zone held at an airfield near or in a location where an airplane is waiting nearby to take the deceased's remains to his or her home country. The term has been in use since about 2005 and became common during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Gallery File:Funeral henry bell.jpgThe military funeral of U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Henry H.

They can be found from Paraguay in South America up to Texas in the southern United States. They are generally brown in their overall coloration, with two bands of white straddling the middle of the upper surfaces of the wings, and a patch of orange on the tips of their forewings. The upper surfaces of the wings of the males are overlaid by an iridescent blue-purple sheen. The females of the species closely resemble members of the unrelated genus Adelpha. The larvae of Doxocopa pavon feed on the leaves of hackberries, while the adults are primarily nectar-feeders. Taxonomy Original illustrations of a female Doxocopa pavon theodora by Hippolyte Lucas (1857) Doxocopa pavon is classified under the genus Doxocopa of the subfamily Apaturinae (emperors) in the brush-footed butterfly family Nymphalidae. It was originally described as Nymphalis pavon by the French zoologist Pierre Andr√© Latreille in 1809. The type specimen was collected from Loja, Ecuador. Doxocopa pavon is usually divided into two subspecies: Doxocopa pavon theodora and the nominal subspecies Doxocopa pavon pavon. D. p. theodora was originally described by the French entomologist Hippolyte Lucas in 1857 as Apatura theodora. Its type specimen was collected from Fernardina de Jagua, Cuba (now the city of Cienfuegos). The subspecies was also collected by the French lepidopterist Jean Baptiste Boisduval in 1870 and described as the species Chlorippe mentas. Several other authors also described it under other names. The German entomologist Hans Fruhstorfer described it as [Chlorippe] pavon inumbratus and [Chlorippe] pavon cuellinia in 1907, with specimens collected from Paraguay and Mexico respectively. And in 1916, the German entomologist Julius R√∂ber also named it [Chlorippe] pavon subtuniformis. The latter names are now considered synonyms and are invalid. Doxocopa pavon are commonly known as the Pavon emperor, or simply Pavon. Description A female from Mission, Texas Doxocopa pavon have wingspans between . They are sexually dimorphic, having two distinct forms for the male and female. Both sexes have a small orange patch on the tips of their forewings. The upper surfaces of the wings of the male of the species are predominantly brown overlaid with a vividly iridescent bluish purple. In the middle of the upper surfaces of both forewings and hindwings is a white band that is usually only barely visible. The undersides of the wings are a pale brown. At the tip of the forewing is a small orange patch. The female of the species is also predominantly brown on the upper surfaces of the wings, but it lacks the purple coloration of the males. It also has a band of white in the middle of the upper surfaces of both forewings and hindwings. Unlike in the male, this band is very distinct and broad, though it does not touch the front edge of the forewings. The species closely resembles the silver emperor (Doxocopa laure) but differs in that the undersides of the wings of D. laure are covered in a silvery sheen, while it is a plain pale brown in D. pavon. Both sexes also lack the pointed tips in the hindwings which is present in D. laure. The males of D. laure also have extended forewings with squarish tips and a much larger orange patch than in D. pavon. The females of D. pavon also closely resemble both sexes of some species of the unrelated genus Adelpha (sisters). Particularly the band-celled sister (Adelpha fessonia), pointed sister (Adelpha iphiclus), Celerio sister (Adelpha serpa), Bredow's sister (Adelpha bredowii), Arizona sister (Adelpha eulalia), and the California sister (Adelpha californica). They can be distinguished from A. fessonia in that the white bands in D. pavon never reach the front edge of their forewings. While the white bands in A. bredowii, A. californica, and A. eulalia are broken into spots on the forward edge of their forewings. Adelpha and Doxocopa are thought to be part of a large mimicry complex, as some members of Adelpha are unpalatable to predators. Distribution and habitat This species occurs from Bolivia and Paraguay in South America to northern Mexico in North America. At times, it can also be found in the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas. The subspecies D. p. theodora has a more limited range, being found in Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. They are generally found in tropical and subtropical forests (including rainforests) at altitudes of about above sea level. Life cycle and ecology The larvae of D. pavon are green with yellow-white dots running along their sides, and an indistinct series of yellow-white blotches on the upper surface. The body tapers strongly towards a pointed tail. The head is green with black eyes and black mandibles. Two white and black stripes on the front also extend up towards the two long, forward-projecting horns. The horns are green with a forked black tip. The larvae feed on the leaves of hackberries (genus Celtis). In the United States, they are usually found on the desert hackberry (Celtis pallida), while in Mexico they can be found on the iguana hackberry (Celtis iguanaea). The chrysalis is camouflaged as a leaf, similar to that of other members of the subfamily. It is greenish in color, strongly arched, flattened laterally and with ridges running along the abdomen. The adults feed on nectar; including those from the flowers of bocotes (genus Cordia) and rushfoils (genus Croton). They can also be commonly found in sunlit areas in forests engaging in mud-puddling on moist mineral- laden soil or rock, rotting fruit, carrion, or bird droppings. The males are the most often encountered, as they have a habit of perching on trees in full sunlight (especially at midday) waiting for females. Females, however, are more rarely seen as they spend most of their time in the forest canopy. Conservation The species is considered secure globally (G5) by NatureServe, though it might be rare near the boundaries of its range. In Guatemala, the species is listed under the country's local wildlife red list due to low-level hunting by butterfly collectors (averaging at three specimens a month).

Zgodovinski ƒçasopis 26: 367‚Äì381, p. 379. A 1936 survey stated that the Slovenes living in Zaderc had been Germanized and were only weakly conscious of their ethnic Slovene identity. Zaderc was not listed in the Gottschee land registry of 1574, in the 1770 census, or in Karl Julius Schr√∂er's 1870 dictionary because it was formerly administratively part of the Dominion of Poljane instead of Gottschee County. The village had three farms in 1576. Before the Second World War, the main activity in the village was farming and peddling, and the village had 15 houses and a population between 33 and 37. The original inhabitants of the village were expelled in October 1941, and the village was later burned. In 1953 it was inhabited by two Roma families (Brajdiƒç and Hudorovac), who worked at the gravel pit at ƒåeplje. Cultural heritage The ruins of a chapel dedicated to Saint Francis Xavier are located in Zaderc. The chapel was destroyed during the Second World War.Gottscheer Pfarren und Kirchen The ruins are located east of the crossroads in the settlement. The chapel dated from the mid-18th century and had an octagonal altar section walled on three sides and a stone portico. The outer walls of the chapel are preserved as well as the linden tree that stood next to it. The site is heavily overgrown.

The swing bridge is the 13th bridge from the river's mouth at Newark Bay and is upstream from it. Opened in 1903, the Warren through truss rim-bearing bridge was substantially rehabilitated in 1975‚Äì1976, its original working parts are now part of the collection of the Newark Museum. It is listed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places (ID#5153) and is eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. The lower of the 90-mile (140 km) long Passaic River downstream of the Dundee Dam is tidally influenced and navigable. The Clay Street Bridge was built to replace an 1889 wrought iron structure. It is one of three functional vehicular and pedestrian swing bridges in the city, the others being the Jackson Street Bridge and the Bridge Street Bridge. Since 1998, rules regulating drawbridge operations require a four-hour notice for them to be opened, which occurs infrequently. At its eastern end Clay Street Bridge enters the Clark Thread Company Historic District, crossing the river at a point which remains in use for industry, manufacturing, and distribution. The western end enters the neighborhood of Newark sometimes known as Lower Broadway. The US Army Corps of Engineers is undertaking restoration and rehabilitation of the Lower Passaic, including oversight of environmental remediation and reconstruction of bulkheads. In 2012, the New Jersey Department of Transportation allocated funds for the reconstruction of the bridge. As of 2014 the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority in conjunction with the counties, is conducting Local Concept Development (LCD) Study, an earlier phase in addressing the deterioration and structural deficiencies of the bridge, which due to its age, can no longer address with routine maintenance. In 2015, it was determined that a replacement is the preferred option, which would cost approximately $70 million.http://www.theobserver.com/2015/06/new-bridge-requires-big-bucks/ The Observer.

History In 1839 and 1841 surveyors James Warner, Granville Stayplton and Robert Dixon were directed by incoming Lieutenant Owen Gorman to prepare the Moreton Bay Penal Colony for civil administration and private (rather than convict only) occupation. In particular Warner surveyed Norman Creek from (present day) Stones Corner, Hilliard's Creek and Tingalpa Creek to the Brisbane River, suggesting on his survey a road from Coopers Plains (then called Cowpers Plains) to Cleveland Point (the only eligible site that a mooted port could be located) along a line approximately south of where Old Cleveland Road is today. A subsequent 1841 survey proposed a slightly different alignment, crossing over Tingalpa Creek only once.Fr. Michael A. Endicott O.S.A., M.A. (November 1975) 'The Origins of Old Cleveland Road'. In Coorparoo and Saint James' Church. Accessed from the University of Queensland Library. Retrieved 8 August 2012. In 1849, Major Thomas Mitchell, Surveyor-General of the Colony of New South Wales directed that a town at Cleveland Point be surveyed as per Warner's suggestion in the 1941 survey. Warner submitted his Survey of a practicable road from Brisbane in the County of Stanley to the proposed Town of Cleveland in the same County on 22 May 1850, the first definitive plan and (subsequent) construction of a road on the current's approximate alignment. The first sale of blocks of land at Cleveland occurred on August 13, 1851 after Warner submitted a survey of allotments for the new town on 25 April of that same year. Carina, 2015 Old Cleveland Road's alignment was variously altered by various surveyors, including Warner and Gould, and the New South Wales and (subsequent) Queensland colonial and State governments until 1961, the route of which remains largely unchanged to this day. Oddly, a 1926 Brisbane City Council map called the road Cleveland Road whilst today's Mt. Gravatt-Capalaba Road was labelled by council as Old Cleveland Road. A 1975 Brisbane City Council proposal to rename the current Old Cleveland Road was halted after the Redland City council objected to the change. Between 1912 and 1926, part of the Belmont Tramway ran along the road at Carina. Between 1948 and 1969, Brisbane City Council electric trams ran along Old Cleveland Road between Logan Road and Belmont.

Pulakeshin was killed in the battle and Vatapi was burnt to ground to avenge the defeat of Mahendravarman by Pulakeshin in the battle of Pullalur in 618 CE.  Vatapi Ganapathi  During the dawn of war, Paranjothi worshipped a Ganesha sculpture on the walls of Vatapi fort. On the return from the victorious battlefield, he took the statue of Ganesha to his birthplace Tiruchenkattankudi to be worshipped as Vatapi Ganapathi. The statue and shrine to Vathapi Ganapathi is located in a temple in Tiruchenkattankudi in Nagapattinam district in the Tamil Nadu state of India. This is the oldest evidence for worshiping Ganesha in Tamil Nadu.  Sirutthondar  On the victorious battle field Paranjothi underwent a change of heart and devoted himself to Lord Siva. Paranjothi became an ardent devotee of Lord Siva and was then called as Sirutthondar. He later became one of 63 Nayanmar Saints. Sirutthondar's life and devotion are narrated in Sekkizhar's Periya Puraanam.

Biography =Early life= Gerald W. Thomas was born at home on the Daniel Thomas ranch on Medicine Lodge Creek, Small, Idaho on July 3, 1919. His parents were Daniel Waylett Thomas and Mary Elizabeth Evans. Thomas was the second oldest of six sons. =Education= Thomas attended the local Medicine Lodge school through the 11th grade, the last grade the school offered. He moved to Pasadena, California and finished high school at John Muir High School. He attended Pasadena Junior College for two years and then obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Forestry in February, 1941, from the University of Idaho, at Moscow, Idaho. In 1950, he enrolled in Texas A&M; University, at College Station, Texas, where he obtained a MS degree in Wildlife Management in 1951 and a Ph.D in Wildlife Management in 1954 (called Range Management then). =Military Service= On February 5, 1942, Thomas volunteered for the Navy. He passed his \\"B-check\\" in a N3N \\"Yellow Peril\\" at the ‚ÄúElimination Base‚Äù at Los Alamitos, California, on July 2, 1942. Assigned to Naval Aviation School, Corpus Christi, Texas, he graduated with an Ensign Commission on November 27, 1942. He then received six weeks of dive-bomber training at Naval Air Station Miami in Opa-locka, Florida. In January, 1943, Thomas was assigned to Torpedo Squadron Four (VT-4) attached to the . VT-4 was a 9-plane Grumman TBF Avenger unit with 12 pilots and 2 non-flying officers. It was a part of Air Group 4 along with a 16-plane fighter squadron (VF-4) and a 16-plane dive bomber squadron (VB-4). Thomas' first combat action was Operation Leader, a strike on German shipping along the coast of Norway on October 4, 1943. On that strike, while attacking a freight barge carrying 40 tons of ammunition, Thomas' plane was hit by anti-aircraft fire. The engine began burning and it appeared the plane was going down. Thomas ordered his crew of two to bail out and had just opened the cockpit and was climbing out when his turret gunner yelled, \\"Don't jump, don't jump.\\" The other crewman had accidentally opened his parachute in the belly of the plane. With bailing no longer possible, Thomas considered his options and decided their best chance was to fly the plane toward the carrier as far as it would go. Surprisingly, in spite of the considerable engine damage, the plane made it back to the Ranger, where Thomas crash-landed. That landing was his 13th official carrier landing.Thomas, Gerald W. Pilot Flight Log Book. On June 26, 1944, Air Group 4 was ordered off the Ranger and to the West Coast of the United States for an assignment in the Pacific. After some time on the West Coast and some time training in Hawaii, Air Group 4 was ordered aboard the on November 4, 1944. On the Bunker Hill, Thomas participated in strikes against Ormoc Bay, Manila Bay, and Cavite in the Philippines. During this combat period, Air Group 4 lost seven pilots and four crewmen. On November 18, 1944, Air Group 4 was assigned to the . On the Essex, Thomas participated in strikes against Santa Cruz, San Fernando, Lingayen, Mindoro, Clark Field, Aparri, Formosa, French Indo-China, Saigon, Pescadores, Hainan, Amami O Shima, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, and Japan. The attack on Japan was the first attack on Japan from an aircraft carrier since the \\"Doolittle Raid.\\" While on the Essex, just after Thomas had returned from a strike on Santa Cruz, the ship was hit by a Kamikaze flying a Yokosuka D4Y dive bomber. The Kamikaze attack killed 16 crewmen and wounded 44. Returning from a strike on Hainan, off the Chinese coast, Thomas' plane ran out of fuel. After a harrowing water landing, Thomas and his crewmen succeeded in inflating and launching rubber boats. After a long day in pre-Typhoon weather with 40 foot swells, they were rescued by the . On March 2, 1945, Air Group 4 was assigned non-combat duty and transferred off the Essex. Thomas was awarded 3 Distinguished Flying Crosses, 2 Air Medals, and 2 Presidential Unit Citations for his combat actions in World War II. =NMSU President= Thomas was the 17th NMSU president, and the second longest serving president. When he became president, NMSU had about 900 faculty and the main campus enrollment was about 8,000. By his retirement, the faculty had grown to 1,700 and enrollment was more than 12,500 students.

Typical of heavy-duty internal combustion engines used in industrial applications, EMD engines are designed to allow the cylinder liners, pistons, piston rings and connecting rods to be replaced at overhaul without removing the entire engine assembly from its application location. This increases engine value, reduces downtime and allows the engine to be returned to true new engine performance. Other terms such as cylinder pack, liner pack, cylinder assembly and cylinder kit are used in the engine industry to describe similar assemblies. In the large- engine industry, the term \\"power assembly\\" has also become generic and is often used to refer to the assemblies used in non-EMD engines where \\"power pack\\" may be the preferred term, although both terms are functionally the same. Because of the size and weight of the engine assembly and the difficulties of removing and transporting them for repair, they are typically serviced on-site in stationary applications and in the ship or locomotive in transportation applications. Designing the engine for \\"easy\\" service is done out of necessity rather than the desire to increase engine serviceability. Power assemblies are large and heavy and overhead lifting equipment sufficient to lift the fixture and assembly are required. An EMD power assembly consists of the following components: #Cylinder head assembly (including valves, springs, keepers etc.) less fuel system components #Cylinder liner #Piston and piston rings #Piston carrier #Connecting rod In an EMD diesel engine, since two power assemblies share a common connecting-rod journal, and since the power assemblies are directly opposite each other rather than staggered as in a typical V-type engine, two different power assemblies are required in a single engine. The difference between the two assemblies is in the connecting rods. One connecting rod \\"big end\\" has to fit inside that of its companion rod and the two types are referred to as \\"blade rods\\" and \\"fork rods\\". The \\"fork rod\\" is logically the \\"master\\" as only it has a \\"rod cap\\", in this specific case referred to as a \\"basket\\", whereas the \\"blade rod\\" is logically the \\"slave\\" as its \\"big toe\\" is designed to fit completely within, and is guided by, and is retained by the \\"fork\\", and both are retained by the single \\"basket\\". Several situations can require power assembly replacement. Most are due to failure within the power assembly itself such as a dropped valve, broken piston or internal coolant leak. Less common are replacements to repair catastrophic failures such as broken connecting rods or a \\"hydro-locked\\" power assembly that has been broken or knocked out of the cylinder block when the cylinder filled with coolant during engine operation and the inability of the piston to compress the liquid caused catastrophic failure. Complete power assembly replacements, where all of the assemblies in an engine are replaced, are least common and are normally done as part of a comprehensive engine overhaul. In a normal in-service power assembly replacement situation, the replacement will follow an inspection of the engine specifically performed to find internal engine failures. With the engine crankcase access and cylinder block airbox covers removed, a visual inspection of the engine's rotating and reciprocating assemblies can be performed. The use of a fiber optic endoscope (flexible borescope) may facilitate this inspection and evaluation, but this is not a requirement, nor is it a part of EMD's maintenance program. The engine airbox covers (the upper covers observed on the side of an EMD engine - they cover the \\"airbox\\" that allows air to flow through the cylinder block to the power assemblies) are removed to allow visual inspection of the inside of the cylinder liners and the piston crowns, skirts and rings. The crankcase access covers (the lower covers observed on the side of an EMD engine) are also removed to inspect for coolant leakage, damaged components and excessive wear. A proper inspection requires filling and pressurizing the cooling system to check for leakage from the power assemblies. To inspect the engine, it can be manually \\"barred over\\" with a lever, but manual engine rotation is slow and inefficient. In some applications manually barring the engine over can be difficult or impossible. The preferred tool for engine rotation is an electrically powered, hydraulically operated \\"turning jack\\". The turning jack uses a hydraulic cylinder and ram assembly that automatically advances to engage a hole in the flywheel. When the ram reaches its limit, it automatically retracts and advances again to engage another hole. The engine is then progressively rotated through its cycle and can be rotated in either direction by installing the jack on either side of the engine. Not only is a turning jack faster and more efficient, it is also safer since there is no risk of a barring lever coming loose and causing injury or damage. Also, with a turning jack, there is no need for the mechanic to be in physical contact with the engine at any point during the inspection process. A turning jack also allows a complete top deck and crankcase inspection to be performed by one mechanic in minutes, and inspecting the engine with the components in motion produces a better inspection. Rocker arm rollers can be inspected for proper rotation, potential valvetrain problems such as insufficient or excessive clearance can be observed, piston ring movement in the ring grooves indicating excessive groove wear can be observed, broken valvesprings can be more easily seen, and so on. A turning jack also allows the mechanic to observe the flywheel timing marks while the engine is rotating to time the engine properly for maintenance or post-repair engine valve-train and fuel- system adjustments. Claims of power assembly replacement being possible with \\"ordinary tools\\" in a \\"few hours\\" are subjective, as the tools necessary are hardly \\"ordinary\\" in typical mechanic shops and actual repair times can vary widely depending on the situation. At the minimum, large sockets and high- capacity torque multipliers are necessary to enable the large nuts retaining the hold-downs to be removed and retorqued to proper specifications. Various other special tools, while not strictly required, make the job much easier. Additionally, there are special tools required for adjustment of the fuel system after assembly replacement. As far as repair time goes, power assembly replacement is typically performed by at least two mechanics so the labor involved is at least twice the repair time required. If the engine comes in for inspection or repair \\"hot\\", the unit may need to cool for several hours before repairs can begin. If parts are not readily available, the delays will increase. Typically, for a power assembly replacement in an engine cool enough to work on and with the proper tools and necessary parts readily at hand, two mechanics can replace a power assembly properly and safely in a 4-hour period. Rarely are major repairs involving expensive engines and components and significant safety hazards rushed to create \\"efficiency\\" at the expense of safety and reliability. The quality and layout of the work area also has a big effect on the time required and the quality of the work. Proper equipment and tools make the job \\"easy\\". Poor working conditions and having to make do without the appropriate tools and equipment can make the replacement process a nightmare. The aforementioned \\"barring over\\" with a lever versus having a turning jack is a good example of being properly equipped. A properly equipped repair shop for mobile equipment (locomotives) or individual engines (rebuild/overhaul shop) or the area where stationary engines are permanently installed (marine applications where the engine cannot be practically removed for service or electrical power plants, etc.) will be equipped with sufficient overhead lifting equipment to allow the assemblies to be safely and efficiently handled, removed and installed. Although the components are large and heavy and specialized tools are required, the replacement process is straightforward and simple. The engine coolant is drained, the test valve \\"snifter\\" is removed, the rocker arm assembly and fuel system components are removed, the connecting rod is disconnected from the crankshaft, the power assembly hold-downs (commonly called \\"crabs\\") are removed, the cooling system plumbing is disconnected, piston cooling tube is removed, the lifting fixture is installed and the power assembly is lifted out of the cylinder block. The process is reversed to install the replacement power assembly. Following installation of the replacement assembly, all hardware is torqued to specs, the cooling system is refilled, the engine crankshaft is properly timed to allow the valves and fuel injector of the new power assembly to be adjusted, the valve train and fuel injection system is adjusted using appropriate gauges, the fuel system is primed and the engine is started and checked for proper operation and leaks within the cooling system, if any, are identified. As in any other situation where an engine is rebuilt, there is a \\"break-in\\" period for replacement power assemblies that should include operating the engine at varying speeds and loads for a specified period of time to seat the cylinder rings before the engine is placed into normal service.

It is located at the tip of the Nantasket Peninsula, in Boston Harbor. History Historic manuscripts have called the location \\"Windmill Point\\" since the 1820s. The windmills for which the point were named were used by two brothers to pump seawater into vats to be used for harvesting salt. The salt would then be used to pack fish. On July 13, 1909, fourteen-year-old Rosie Pitenhof swam across the Hull Gut from Peddocks Island to Pemberton Point and back, believed to be the first to do so. Hull High School, the town's public high school, opened on the point in 1957. Wind turbines alt=Hull Wind 1 wind turbine An Enertech 40 kW wind turbine was installed on Pemberton Point and started energy production in March 1985. The turbine was funded by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources, and was sited adjacent to the high school. It was damaged beyond repair by a storm in March 1997, and was removed after a new wind turbine, nicknamed \\"Hull Wind 1\\", was installed nearby at the end of 2001. =Hull Wind 1= Hull Wind 1, a new Vestas V47 turbine capable of producing 660 kW, began producing power on Pemberton Point in December 2001\\\\. It stands tall. It is the first commercial wind turbine on the East Coast of the United States and in the whole of New England. It is also the first commercial urban turbine in North America. During its first year of operation, it saved Hull over 100,000. In 2003, planning began for an additional wind turbine known as \\"Hull Wind 2\\". It was initially suggested that it be located near Hull Wind 1, but after concerns were expressed by nearby residents over having two in close proximity, the new Vestas V80 1.8 MW wind turbine was installed on a landfill to the east, away from Pemberton Point, and began operation in May 2006. Facilities The United States Coast Guard Station Point Allerton was built in 1969 and is located near the point. It was commissioned on April 18, 1970. Point Allerton Lifesaving Station, which opened on October 15, 1889, used to hold the United States Coast Guard before the present station was built.

She discovers through the cards that her friend Mollie Rourke (McGinnis) is doomed to marry. Although Mollie's father objects, Frances aids Mollie in her elopement, and at the ceremony meets a blonde young man. As her cards have told her that a blonde man would enter her life, she accepts her new acquaintance as the gift of fate. Maurice Rennard (Valentino), an adventurer, makes up his mind to marry the money attached to Frances and, after consulting her cards and finding that a dark man would cross her path, Frances submits. The wedding, however, is postponed after a black cat crosses Frances' path. Frances takes refuge in Mollie's apartment, which is vacant as Mollie and her new husband have left town. The blonde young man also takes refuge there, down at heart both by the failure to win Frances and the fact that, in order to land a contract for a farm, he will likely have to wed the silly daughter of Rockaway Smith (Fawcett), the man who is to let the contract. Burglars also enter the \\"empty\\" apartment. A chase from room to room takes place with not one of the occupants seeing the others. The burglars finally succeed in putting the blonde young man and Frances to sleep with a billy club and proceed to ransack the place. Mollie, Mollie's husband, and Maurice enter the flat and discover Frances and her blonde friend. The burglars are also captured. Maurice decides that Sally Smith (Chichester), daughter of the man with the contract, is good enough for him, and thus relieves the blonde gentlemen of her. Frances and the blonde man set out to marry, but because it is raining postpone it, as marrying in rainy weather is bad luck.

He is the father of journalist Barbara Walters. Early life Lou Walters was born in London in 1896Bloom, p. 549. to Isaac Abrahams and Lillian Schwartz.Walters, pp. 8-9. He was one of 7 children, and the eldest son. As a child, he lost one of his eyes, and thereafter wore a glass eye.Walters, p. 7. Isaac Abrahams was a tailor, and during a strike in the clothing business in 1906, he moved the family to Belfast. Three years later, Isaac and his sons moved to New York, with his wife and daughters following seven months later. There, the family changed their surname to Walters.Walters, p. 10. Lou Walters found a job working as an office boy at a vaudeville booking office, and soon began booking acts himself. By his early 20s, Walters had opened his own booking agency in Boston, Massachusetts. His business originally booked only vaudeville acts, but as the popularity of vaudeville declined, he branched out to book acts into nightclubs and supper clubs. According to the memoir of his daughter Barbara, Walters discovered comedians Fred Allen and Jack Haley.Walters, p. 13. Walters was not an imposing man, standing at only 5'4 and weighing about 125 lbs. In 1920, he married Dena Seletsky in Boston.Walters, p. 8. Over the next ten years, they had three children: Burton, who died of pneumonia as a toddler, Jacqueline, who had a mental disability (died from ovarian cancer in 1988), and Barbara, a television journalist and anchor. Latin Quarter In 1937, Walters opened his first nightclub, Latin Quarter, with a partner, E.M. Loew. The venture took his entire savings; on opening night he had only 63 cents to his name. The club was very successful, and within three years was grossing more than $500,000 per year. Walters moved his family to Miami Beach, Florida, where he took over the Palm Island Club from Earl Carroll and relaunched it as another Latin Quarter. Two years later, in 1942, Walters opened a Latin Quarter nightclub on Times Square in New York City. The club was extremely popular, and in its first year grossed over $1.5 million. Over 5 million people visited the nightclub during its first ten years in operation. Walters's nightclubs were known for their luxurious atmosphere and good food. Walter once told an interviewer that \\"'It's a popular fallacy in this business ...to say that your money is made or lost in the kitchen. The man who goes to a nightclub goes in a spirit of splurging, and you've got to splurge right along with him.'\\" The nightclubs offered three shows per evening, each featuring some of the top talent of the time, including Milton Berle, Frank Sinatra, Mae West, and Mickey Rooney, mixed with performances by chorus girls. The chorus girls were cast after auditions in London, Paris, and major cities in the United States. The dancers were skimpy costumes designed by leading fashion designers, including Ert√©. During this time, Walters branched into producing theatrical shows. In 1943, Walters produced a successful revival of the Zeigfeld Follies on Broadway, which ran for 553 performances.Bloom, p. 550. He produced two other Broadway shows, Artists and Models, and Star Time, but neither were popular. Cafe de Paris Walters sold his share of the Latin Quarter chain to Loew in 1956 for $500,000.Walters, p. 88. He was convinced that he could recreate his success with a new chain of clubs called Cafe de Paris. He opened the first in Miami in 1957. A combination of poor national economy and unusually frigid Miami winter resulted in a sharp decline in the number of tourists who visited Miami that year. The Miami club failed to attract enough visitors and closed after its first season. A second version of the Cafe de Paris opened in New York in May 1958, in the former Arcadia Ballroom. It was the largest nightclub in New York, able to seat twelve hundred people. Both of the Cafe de Paris locations were very close to the existing Latin Quarter nightclubs. Loew won an injunction that prevented Walters from advertising his ownership of either of the Cafe de Paris nightclubs.Walters, p. 89. Although opening week was successful, the club was too large, and the rent too high, for Walters to cover his expenses. Facing bankruptcy, Walters attempted suicide in June 1958.Walters, p 91. His family covered this up, convincing the press that Walters had only had a heart attack.Walters, p. 92. Following his release from the hospital, Walters moved his family back to Miami. All of their assets in New York were seized to pay creditors.Walters, p. 93. Walters was also sued by New York for failing to pay income or payroll taxes while he operated the Cafe de Paris. The court case lasted two years, and Walters began missing court appearances, claiming he did not have the funds to travel to New York. A judge issued a warrant for his arrest. According to the memoir of Walters' daughter Barbara, she contacted her friend, powerful attorney Roy Cohn, to let him know about the charges, and within a week the charges were dropped and the case was settled.Walters, p. 103. Las Vegas In Miami, Walters regained his equilibrium. The Hotel Deauville hired him to produce their nightly shows. That work led to an offer from the Tropicana Las Vegas to manage their stage shows as Entertainment Director.Walters, p. 102. At the Tropicana, he introduced the Folies Berg√®re to Las Vegas. This was the first time the Folies had been licensed outside of Paris. This became the longest running theatrical production in the world. Walters later produced entertainment for the Casino de Paris in Lake Tahoe, Nevada. In 1965, Walters returned to managing the Latin Quarter chain, now as an employee rather than owner. Death and legacy Walters retired in 1967. He died of a heart attack in 1977. In 1978, the Boston Center for the Arts named a rehearsal hall for Walters. In 2006, New York City renamed a street near the old Latin Quarter nightclub \\"Lou Walters Way\\".

In 1621 he also received the Bohemian County of Kladsko as a fief from the hands of his brother, Emperor Ferdinand II. Life Born in Graz, Styria, Charles was the youngest son of Archduke Charles II of Austria (1540‚Äì1590), ruling over the Inner Austrian estates of the Habsburg Monarchy, and his consort Maria Anna (1551‚Äì1608), daughter of the Wittelsbach duke Albert V of Bavaria. Born less than a month after his father's death, he was nicknamed \\"Charles the Posthumous\\" (Karl der Posthume). As the last of 15 siblings, Charles, like his brother Leopold V was destined for an ecclesiastical career. In 1602 he was appointed to a canonry of Salzburg Cathedral and in 1605 to a canonry of Passau. Further canonries in Trent and Brixen followed in 1606, and in Cologne Cathedral in 1618. These were for the most part absentee appointments that provided him with an income from ecclesiastical revenues. On 7 July 1608, at the age of 17, he was elected Prince-bishop at Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw); he entered the city on December 14. In 1613 Charles also became Bishop of Brixen, however, he left the governance of the diocese to an administrator as he had chosen Neisse (Nysa) for his permanent residence. He did not receive holy orders until 1615, due to his young age. In 1619 he succeeded his cousin Archduke Maximilian III of Austria as Grand Master (Hochmeister) of the Teutonic Knights.Matthias Schnettger, \\"Karl [III.], Erzherzog von √ñsterreich\\", in Biographisch-Bibliographisches Kirchenlexikon, vol. 17 (Bautz, Herzberg 2000), pp. 759‚Äì762. Charles was a staunch Catholic. Upon his appointment as Breslau prince-bishop, he strongly protested against the 1609 Letter of Majesty, issued by his cousin Emperor Rudolf II to treat all religions equally in the Bohemian crown land of Silesia, and failed to succeed as a Silesian Landeshauptmann governor. When after the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War in 1618 the Protestant Silesian estates rebelled and acknowledged Frederick V of the Palatinate as king, the prince-bishop fled to the Polish court of King Sigismund III Vasa and later moved to Brixen. After the 1620 Battle of White Mountain he returned to forcefully reintroduce Catholicism in his Duchy of Nysa. He founded a Jesuit college Carolinum(Nysa) there in 1622. After he had received the Bohemian County of Kladsko from Emperor Ferdinand II in 1621, he had the area likewise occupied by Imperial troops and forcefully reverted to Catholicism. In 1624 he travelled to Madrid, at the request of his nephew King Philip IV of Spain, who planned to appoint him Viceroy of Portugal. However, he fell seriously ill and died in late December before taking up his post. His mortal remains were buried in the Royal Site of San Lorenzo de El Escorial, while his heart was transferred to the newly erected St Mary's Jesuit Church in Nysa.

Manufactured by Austin at Longbridge, Northfield, Birmingham, it was the first variant from Austin's initial plans for a two model range of a 15 hp (RAC 27 hp)‚Äîwhich they had dropped‚Äîand a 25 hp (RAC 33 hp) car. Tax rating was still new and manufacturers preferred their own output estimates.

It took 25-30's place in the catalogue. The engine's crankshaft runs in no fewer than five bearings. Power was transmitted to the live rear axle through a multiple-disc clutch with phosphor bronze and steel friction surfaces and a gearbox with sliding spur-wheel gears, providing four forward speeds and reverse, using a shaft fitted with two universal joints. The gearbox, of unusually strong design including an extra bearing on the inner end of the engine driven shaft, is operated on the gate principle. Unusually by 1907 the engine was fitted with a governor mounted on the fan spindle operating on the car's throttle. The Krebs carburettor initially fitted was replaced by an Austin design.

He is the Craig Reynolds Professor of Sleep Medicine at Stanford Medical School, Stanford University. Career Dr. Emmanuel Mignot completed his Science Doctorate in Molecular Pharmacology at the Universit√© Pierre and Marie Curie and went to medical school at Necker-Enfants Malades, Universit√© Ren√© Descartes, with subspecialisation in Psychiatry. Dr. Mignot is a former student of √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure (Ulm). Following a postdoctoral fellowship at the Stanford Sleep Center, Mignot believed that understanding narcolepsy could lead to breakthrough in new understanding of sleep. He was appointed Assistant Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University in 1993, Professor in 2001 and Director of the Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine in 2011, succeeding William C.

Background Salazar, a Moro native of Zamboanga, lived with his common-law wife, M√°xima Pacho, in Barangay San Nicolas. Due to his suspicions that his wife had an affair with her sister's husband, Fortunato Nares, and that the child she was pregnant with was not his own, he planned to vindicate his honour by exacting his vengeance from them. Killings On the morning of October 11, 1956, the 42-year-old Salazar asked his wife to accompany him while gathering nipa for the repair of their house. M√°xima's pregnant sister, Romana, arrived and invited her to accompany her to her house to get palay. M√°xima refused to join her husband, which infuriated him. Salazar armed himself with a spear and a bolo knife and first killed Romana, before fatally attacking his pregnant wife and his nephew, Fortunato Nares Jr. Salazar afterwards made his way through the village and entered four houses, murdering everyone he found therein. At the school compound, he stabbed Manuel Adion in the back with his spear; though severely wounded, Adion was able to escape. Salazar then chased two other men, Pablo P√°z and Severino Adion, and threw his spear at them, hitting neither, before trying to enter the schoolhouse. The teacher present had already locked and barricaded the schoolhouse's door and windows, and Salazar was unable to force his way in. He lastly went to the local chapel and tolled the bell, calling for everybody to come. He asked to be killed, but no one dared to obey. Eventually, two armed guards and a barrio officer arrived at the scene and persuaded Salazar to surrender. They did so by promising that they would shoot and kill him at the wharf, but only after he had signed a piece of paper that was to protect them from repercussions from higher authorities. When Salazar lay down his arms and was about to affix his thumbmark on the paper, he was subdued and arrested. Aftermath On October 24, 1956, Salazar's physical and mental state was examined by the chief of the Puerto Princesa Hospital, who declared him normal and sane. After he had plead guilty, Salazar was sentenced to death once for each of the 16 murders, as well as multi-year prison sentences for frustrated and attempted murder. He was also fined, required to pay the heirs of his victims ‚Ç±3,000. During his appeal hearing on June 30, 1959, the sentence was retained, but the court found his confession and admission of guilt mitigating, so his conviction for the murders of his wife M√°xima and Romana Pacho, as well as of Fortunato Nares, was changed to reclusi√≥n perpetua.

Pro- Syrian government militias, Iraqi Shia militias that are part of the Iraqi Government-sanctioned Popular Mobilization Forces and the Yemeni Houthi movement (officially: \\"Ansar Allah\\") are also considered part of the alliance. Despite the alliance's differing ideologies, for example secular Ba'athism and Shia Islamism, they are united to oppose NATO, Israeli and Saudi Arabian activities in the region. Abdul-Malek al-Houthi History Bashar al-Assad The term was used by the Libyan daily newspaper Al-Zahf Al-Akhdar in response to American president George W. Bush's claim that Iran, Iraq and North Korea formed an \\"axis of evil.\\" In an article titled \\"Axis of evil or axis of resistance,\\" the paper wrote in 2002 that \\"the only common denominator among Iran, Iraq and North Korea is their resistance to US hegemony.\\" The Iranian newspaper Jomhuri-ye Eslami subsequently adopted the language in reference to the Shia insurgency in Iraq, writing in 2004 that \\"if the line of Iraq's Shi'is needs to be linked, united and consolidated, this unity should be realized on the axis of resistance and struggle against the occupiers.\\" In 2006, the Palestinian minister of the interior, Said Saim, used the term during an interview an Al-Alam television to refer to common political goals among Arabs in opposition to those of Israel or the United States. Noting the large number of Palestinian refugees in Syria, Saim stated, \\"Syria is also an Islamic Arab country and is also targeted by the Americans and the Zionists. Hence we see in Syria, Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas an axis of resistance in front of these pressures.\\" The term \\"axis of resistance\\" was used as early as August 2010. After two years, Ali Akbar Velayati, senior advisor for foreign affairs to Iran's supreme leader, used the term and said: The phrase was used again on August 2012 during a meeting between Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, Saeed Jalili, regarding the Syrian Civil War. He said: The Syrian state-run news agency, SANA, has stated that the two governments discussed their \\"strategic cooperation relationship\\" and \\"attempts by some Western countries and their allies to strike at the axis of resistance by targeting Syria and supporting terrorism there.\\" The alliance has been described as an \\"Axis of Terror\\" by the prime minister and ambassadors of Israel.50 tons of weapons seized by Israel, Telegraph, 16 March 2011Israel pursues strikes on Lebanon, BBC, 14 July 2006GILLERMAN FINGERS 'AXIS OF TERROR', JPost, 22 Feb 2006 Background Hassan Nasrallah At first, the alliance consisted of the Syrian government and Lebanese Hezbollah. Years later Iran, already closely aligned with Syria and Hezbollah, would form stronger relations between the three, creating the axis. Iraqi and Yemeni militants coordinating with Iran came in as the newest members of this alliance. After the beginning of Russian involvement in the Syrian Civil War, a slew of posters showing images of Nasrallah, Assad, Khamenei, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, have appeared with an Arabic caption meaning \\"Men who bow to no one but God.\\" The posters suggest another emerging regional Axis of Resistance, according to The Hill. Analysis The axis has \\"reshaped the strategic balance in the Middle East\\" and according to Marisa Sullivan, it has two main pillars; shared regional objectives and shared support. The current ruling minority of Syria is primarily made up of Alawites, who are a sect of Shia Islam, which is also the majority religion of Iran. The Alawi capture of power in Syria, Middle Eastern Studies, 1989 This common background has made them strategic allies on various issues, including defense. The Sunni Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas has also at times been considered part of the axis due to its opposition to Israel and the United States. However, as of March 2012, the group has since pulled its headquarters out of Damascus and thrown its support behind the anti-Assad Syrian opposition. =Iran‚ÄìSyria= According to Jubin Goodarzi, an assistant professor and researcher at Webster University, the Iranian‚ÄìSyrian alliance that was formed in 1979 is of great importance to the emergence and continuity of the axis of resistance. Both countries are in key locations of the Middle East, and they have been affecting Middle Eastern politics during the past three decades. Also, the alliance is considered to be an enduring one, lasting 34 years \\"in spite of the many challenges that it has faced and periodic strains in the relationship\\". =Axis of resistance vs. Israel= The axis claims to be against Israel in order to shore up popular support across the Islamic world, according to Tallha Abdulrazaq writing in the Middle East Monitor, and it took a severe blow after Israeli Mazraat Amal air strike. Three days before that air strike against Hizbollah convoy, Hizbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah said: \\"...we consider that any strike against Syria is a strike against the whole of the resistance axis, not just against Syria.\\" = Axis of resistance vs. ISIL = Hezbollah rejects the idea of Lebanon helping in the U.S.-led intervention in Iraq arguing that it may lead to the U.S domination in the region or \\"substituting terrorism with flagrant US occupation\\".

It is in five books, comprising 30,117 lines in ten-syllable couplets. The poem's major source is Guido delle Colonne's Historia destructionis Troiae.Lydgate1998, pp. 1, 13.Gray 1970, p. 323. Background Troy Book was Lydgate's first full-scale work. It was commissioned from Lydgate by the Prince of Wales (later Henry V), who wanted a poem that would show the English language to be as fit for a grand theme as the other major literary languages, > Ywriten as wel in oure langage > As in Latyn and in Frensche it is.Prologue, line 114 . Lydgate tells us that he began writing the poem at four o'clock on the afternoon of Monday, 31 October 1412; he completed it in 1420. It has been argued that Lydgate intended Troy Book as an attempt to outdo Chaucer's Trojan romance Troilus and Criseyde, and certainly the frequent recurrence of tributes to Chaucer's excellence as a poet is a notable feature of the poem. The poem emphasizes the disastrous results of political discord and militarism, and also presents the conventional medieval themes of the power of Fortune to influence earthly affairs and the vanity of worldly things. Publication Troy Book survives in 23 manuscripts, testifying to the popularity of the poem during the 15th century.Lydgate 1998, p. 14. It was printed first by Richard Pynson in 1513, and second by Thomas Marshe in 1555. A modernized version sometimes attributed to Thomas Heywood, called The Life and Death of Hector, appeared in 1614. Troy Book exercised an influence on Robert Henryson, Thomas Kyd, and Christopher Marlowe, and was one of Shakespeare's sources for Troilus and Cressida.Lydgate 1998, p. 2. Criticism Modern critics have generally made moderate claims for Troy Book‚Äôs literary merit. Antony Gibbs judged the poem to be of uneven quality, adding that \\"its couplet form indulges Lydgate's fatal garrulity.\\" Douglas Gray found some good writing to praise, and particularly singled out the eloquence and pathos of some of Lydgate's rhetorical laments, descriptions, and speeches.Gray 1970, p. 323. Reference edition The reference edition of Troy Book is that by Henry Bergen, published as volumes 97, 103, 106 and 126 of the Early English Text Society Extra Series between 1906 and 1935.Lydgate 1998, p. 18.

The program features contestants who play from their homes via webcams, answering trivia questions relating to current events. On November 4, 2013, it was announced that Scripps planned to launch Let's Ask America nationwide through a distribution deal with MGM Television. Contestants participate by Skype from the comfort of their own home, an inexpensive technology negating the need for travel expenses. In sweeps months, the show features celebrity editions featuring local news talent from the stations carrying the series such as meteorologists and anchors playing the game from their station's studios for local charities. The program was hosted from its premiere through the summer of 2014 by Kevin Pereira. In July 2014, Bill Bellamy confirmed he had begun taping episodes as the host for the program's third season set to begin in the Fall of 2014. Produced by paraMedia and Telepictures, the program was created for the E. W. Scripps Company, and initially premiered on seven of its television stations alongside another Scripps-created program, the news magazine program The List. The premiere of the two programs are part of a strategy being undertaken by Scripps to replace existing syndicated programming in the valuable pre-primetime hour with new \\"home-grown\\" programs. These new programs would allow Scripps complete control over advertising inventories during the hour for better profitability, unlike Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy!, which Scripps staff felt were too expensive and underperforming in comparison. Wheel and Jeopardy! were replaced by The List and Let's Ask America on the Scripps stations that carried them. Warner Bros. Television Distribution began to syndicate Let's Ask America to other markets at beginning of the 2013 season. The program is executive produced by Jeff Apploff, Jack Martin and Todd Stevens and is co-produced by Ben Betts and Casey Green. Let's Ask America was canceled on March 24, 2015 due to low ratings, with the show's final episode airing three days later; reruns continued to air until the end of the season. Gameplay In the first round, there are four contestants, and each of them attempt to answer the four multiple-choice questions. In this round, questions have two possible answers. The host first reads the two answers and then follows with the question. All four contestants then have approximately 30 seconds to write down their answers onto the card included in their game kits. Once all contestants have verbally acknowledged that they have written down their answers, the host asks them each to reveal their answers in a sequence determined by the producers. The host then reveals the correct answer, and each contestant that answered the question correctly is awarded the prize money assigned for that question. Contestants who answered incorrectly receive no prize money. After the correct answer to the first question has been revealed, all four contestants are given the next question. The process is then repeated with three additional questions. The first question is worth $100, with subsequent questions increasing by that amount, up to $400 for the fourth question. The lowest scoring contestant at the end of the round is eliminated and leaves with nothing. If two or more contestants are tied for the lowest score, a tiebreaker determines which contestant is eliminated. The tied contestants play a special game called \\"Dash for Ca$h\\". The host gives the contestants a name of an item they must find within their home. The contestant who finds the required item last or fails to find the item is eliminated. Some rounds feature specific rules the contestants must follow while searching for the item, a certain activity that must be completed once the item is found, or starting in the second season, the host gives the contestants a question with two answers, and the contestants must find the correct item related to the answer first to move on. The second round is conducted in the same manner, with each question having three possible answers. Question values begin at $500 and increase by that amount, up to $1,500 for the third question. Again, the contestant with the lowest amount of money is eliminated and leaves with nothing. The third round features the two remaining contestants competing against each other in a two-question showdown. Each question features four possible answers. The first question is worth $2,000 and the second is worth $4,000. The higher-scoring contestant at the end of the third round is the winner and keeps the money earned, and the runner-up is eliminated and leaves with nothing. =Bonus round= During the commercial break, the winning- contestant writes down a wager for the final question. The question is then presented along with four possible answers, and the contestant must answer the question within 30 seconds. A correct response adds the wager to the contestant's final total, while an incorrect response deducts that amount. However, if the contestant wagers any money earned to that point and answers correctly, the wager is paid out at 5-to-1 odds (e.g., if a contestant wagered their maximum of $10,000 and is correct, the contestants maximum win up to $50,000). During its three-season run, David Luea from Boston, MA was the only contestant able to play a perfect game and take home the top prize of $50,000. In the first season only, a contestant who wagered their entire winnings on the final question and failed to provide a correct answer was given a $1,000 consolation prize (or merchandise if the contestant's final score was less than $2,000 before the start of the bonus round). Starting in the second season, contestants who wager their entire score but are incorrect leave with nothing. Reruns Reruns of the show have aired on GSN in the past. Philippines version A short-lived version of Let's Ask America titled Let's Ask Pilipinas airs in the Philippines on TV5 and is hosted by Aga Muhlach in Seasons 1 and 2 followed by Ogie Alcasid in Season 3. The program is part of the network's Everyday All the Way weekday primetime block, and has aired on the network originally on October 14, 2013 until March 28, 2014. However, the series was revived on July 7, 2014 until its cancellation on November 21, 2014 after three seasons. Cincinnati version A locally- produced version of Let's Ask America for Cincinnati, Ohio titled Let's Ask Cincinnati which was hosted by Bob Goen, airing on Scripps's WCPO-TV in 2014. The format was the same as the regular version, with Cincinnati celebrities and personalities playing for local charities.

Biography Velarde was trained at the Liverpool School of Architecture from 1920, and from 1928 taught at the school. In 1957 he was awarded the OBE. His works are located mainly in Merseyside and Northwest England, and most of them were churches. He was influenced by architectural developments on the Continent, in particular by the German Dominikus B√∂hm. It is unlikely that he was at all influenced by his Chilean father who died when he was five years old. He was later destined for a career in the merchant navy but was conscripted from there into the RNVR and served in the trenches to be gassed at Paschendale, thus inevitably shortening his life. On leaving the army he went to Liverpool art school where he was discovered by Charles Riley and given a place at Liverpool School of Architecture. His design of St Gabriel, Blackburn, is considered to be \\"one of the milestones in the development of English church architecture towards Modern Movement style\\". Although Pollard and Pevsner state that he \\"worked exclusively for the Roman Catholic Church\\", he did design one Anglican church, St Gabriel, Blackburn. Five of his churches have been recorded in the National Heritage List for England as designated listed buildings. The Church of St. Monica, Bootle, was upgraded from Grade II to Grade I status in 2017; the Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes in Blackpool, and English Martyrs' Church, Wallasey are listed at Grade II*, and listed at Grade II are St Teresa's Church, Upholland and Holy Cross Church, Bidston. He also designed Roman Catholic schools, one of which is in Birkdale. His Church of St Vincent de Paul and St Louise of Marillac in Potters Bar (Hertfordshire) was completed in 1962, after his death, but subsequently demolished. The practice continued after his death as F. X. Velarde Partners whose work includes St Michael and All Angels Church, Woodchurch, Birkenhead, by Richard O'Mahony (1965).

The novel is the fifth in a series that includes Night Watch, Day Watch, Twilight Watch, Last Watch and Sixth Watch. The series revolves around two opposing supernatural groups (known as \\"Others\\"): the Night Watch, an organization dedicated to policing the actions of the Dark Others ‚Äî and the Day Watch, which polices the actions of the Light Others. New Watch was sent to the publishing house in January 2012, with release to the Russian market in summer 2012. New Watch was published in English on May 2, 2013 ( Publisher: William Heinemann, 2013), in UK Only. Scheduled release for the US is April 2014. Structure and style New Watch has the typical structure of the Watch novels, excluding Day Watch. New Watch is divided into three stories - \\"Vague objectives\\", \\"Troublous times\\" and \\"Vague deeds\\". Each story begins with a prologue followed by eight numbered chapters and, changing the usual structure, without an epilogue. Except for the prologues, the events of each story are written in a first person narrative using the voice of the Higher Magician character Anton Gorodetsky, a member of the Night Watch. Events in each of the prologues are written in a third person narrative. The entire novel is written in the past tense. Plot summary =Vague objectives= Anton Gorodetsky, while seeing a foreign colleague off at the airport, encounters an overweight 10-year-old boy named Kesha, who tries to prevent his mother from boarding a plane, claiming that the plane will crash. Anton scans the boy and determines that Kesha is an uninitiated high-level Other, possibly a prophet. Anton influences Kesha's mother not to board the plane. Meanwhile, Sergeant Pastukhov of the Moscow police, who gained an ability to see Others (he calls Light Others \\"dogs\\" and Dark Others \\"wolves\\") in the first novel, sees an extremely powerful entity whom he labels a Tiger. The Tiger can remove a human's aura, which leaves the person completely indifferent to anything. The Night Watch sends Semyon to initiate the boy, although Geser is very disturbed by the events at the airport, as the plane does not crash as prophesied (unlike predictions, prophecies cannot be changed). Geser calls a meeting of all Light Great Others (including Anton's wife Svetlana and daughter Nadya). They then travel by car (through Twilight) to Kesha's apartment in order to protect him from this strange new creature. The Tiger intercepts them and proves to be more than a match for four Great Mages. It only leaves when Zabulon joins the battle. Anton realizes that the Tiger is a creature of the Twilight whose purpose is to hunt prophets before they utter their first complete prophecy. If this prophecy is heard by a human, then it becomes inevitable. If an Other hears it, then he or she becomes the Tiger's next target. While the Night Watch is attempting to hold off the Tiger, Kesha utters the prophecy in an empty room (a prophet does not hear his or her own key prophecy), causing the Tiger to leave. However, Anton has previously asked Kesha to press the record button on a toy phone. Anton then copies the phone's recording onto a flash drive. =Troublous times= Geser summons Anton and sends him on a business trip to London to meet Erasmus Darwin, a Dark Other who is a prophet and the grandfather of Charles Darwin. Erasmus was able to trick the Tiger. Erasmus meets Anton and explains how, while his teacher (Zabulon himself) was desperately fighting the Tiger, the young Erasmus shouted the prophecy into an oak. Erasmus then gives Anton a goblet he made from that oak and claims that his prophecy can be revealed, although he refuses to tell Anton how. At a local pub, Anton meets the former witch Arina, who tells Anton that, a hundred years ago, she prevented a prophecy that would destroy Russia from happening (although it resulted in the Russian Revolution). She convinces Anton to go with her to Taiwan to meet Fang Wan- Yang, whose friend was a prophet. Fang reveals that the Tiger can leave the Others alone if they can prove beyond doubt that they will never reveal the prophecy (Fang had to kill his friend and honors his memory by keeping the secret). Arina, who has figured out that Anton has a recording of Kesha's prophecy, steals the flash drive and flees using an untraceable artifact. =Vague deeds= Arina once again appears to Anton and explains that the boy's prophecy concerns his daughter and urges Anton to listen to it. Anton gets a call from Erasmus, who reveals that he has made a second goblet and listened to it. Anton hears as the Tiger kills Erasmus. Anton, who has backed up the recording of Kesha's prophecy on his old mini-disc player, listens to it and hears that Nadya, an Absolute Other, is capable of destroying the Tiger and, with it, the Twilight itself. Anton decides to destroy Erasmus's oak goblet. At that moment, Nadya, Kesha, and Arina enter the apartment. Instead of destroying the goblet, fire reveals Erasmus's prophecy to the four. The prophecy claims that Nadya will destroy the Tiger and the Twilight. Seeing the Tiger, who is determined to kill them all to prevent the prophecy from coming true, Anton uses Arina's teleportation artifact to flee to her cabin. Arina, who has decided that magic is evil and must be destroyed, tries to provoke Nadya to kill the Tiger. Anton walks outside and talks to the Tiger. The Tiger explains that a prophecy is merely the manifestation of the will of humanity, but not all of them must happen. If the Tiger dies, then the Others will lose their magic. Anton returns and makes Kesha and Nadya promise never to reveal the prophecy. He then traps himself and Arina in a Sarcophagus of Time for all eternity. However, the Tiger pulls Anton out, fearing that Nadya might kill it to try to get her father back. Arina remains in the Sarcophagus with the depleted teleportation artifact (which Anton believes can be recharged in 5 years). Satisfied, the Tiger leaves. Characters =Light Others= *Anton Gorodetsky - Protagonist of the book, Grand Light Mage. Married to Svetlana Gorodetskaya (n√©e Nazarova), with whom he has a daughter, Nadezhda, the only currently living absolute (zero-leveled) Other in the world. A programmer for the Moscow Night Watch in his beginning days as an Other, Anton's rise in rank among the Others was significantly noticeable, to the point where he rose as a Grand Other thanks to the ritual of Fuaran, performed by his former friend and High Vampire Kostya Saushkin. Due to his observance of young Innokentiy Tolkov, a potential High-level Prophet, at the Sheremetyevo International Airport, he's sent to London by Gesar to investigate the origin and powers of the Tiger with Erasmus Darwin, a retired Dark Other Prophet who, rumour has it, has survived an encounter with the Tiger. Anton sees the Tiger as a nice, simple man. *Boris Ignatyevich/Gesar - Grand Light Mage. Head of the Moscow Night Watch who, if one trusts the words of the Dark Witch/Light Healer Arina, \\"sets his roots\\" wherever there are interesting events regarding the Night and Day Watches (according to his own words, he's lived in Tibet, China, India, Belgium, the Netherlands, and, to present-day, Russia). He's in a relationship with Olga, a grand light Sorceress who's been together with him for many centuries. Known as an intrigant and cunning person, he set in motion a series of events, along with consultations with Zavulon, head of the Moscow Day Watch, and the Inquisition (the consultation part was discovered during the novel New Watch) which resulted in the birth of absolute sorceress Nadezhda Gorodetskaya. He also has a son with Olga, Timur, with whom he had no contact until the events of the novel Twilight Watch, when he managed to turn him into a low-level Light Other with the ritual of Fuaran. Gesar sees the Tiger as a wise man well in his ages. *Svetlana \\"Sveta\\" Gorodetskaya (n√©e Nazarova) - Grand Light Healer and wife of Anton Gorodetsky, with whom she has a daughter, Nadezhda, the only currently living absolute Other in the world. Before she was initiated into the Night Watch, she was a doctor who Gorodetsky accidentally ran into during his field assignment with a vortex clinging above her head, which could only be cast by a very powerful Dark Mage (later on, in the other series of the books, it was discovered that the entire \\"accidental encounter\\" was planned by Gesar). Because of the large difference of power between her and Anton during the events of Night Watch, which threatened to crush their relationship, she withdrew from the Night Watch, although in several times she performed a role that only a Night Watch member would be allowed to perform (e.g. representing the Night Watch during the murder of Witezislav). *Olga - Grand Light Sorceress and love interest of Gesar. Olga was assigned as a partner to the new field agent of the Moscow Night Watch, Anton Gorodetsky, while she was still in the body of what seemed to be a stuffed owl in Gesar's cabinet. Later it was discovered that she was assigned to help Anton because Gesar wanted to lower the punishment she received for, as she said, \\"making a compromise with the Dark Others during a conflict\\". Over the course of the books, it is seen that she shows great interest in Anton's psychological state, and carefully tracks his movements during certain major events, giving him advice on how to react in such situations. During the events of Twilight Watch, she manages to find her and Gesar's long lost son, Timur, and while under the mask of old Russian actor Oleg Strizhenov, she promises her son anything and swears it on the primordial force of the light. Timur cunningly asks to be turned into an Other himself, but not through the source of vampires/shifter-mages. Gesar then starts a number of events that allowed him to turn his and Olga's son into a Light Other. Olga sees the Tiger as an agile and cunning woman. *Nadezhda \\"Nadya\\" Gorodetskaya - Absolute Light Sorceress and daughter of Grand Light Mage Anton Gorodetsky and Grand Light Healer Svetlana Gorodetskaya. Given her absolute state, she is the only currently living Other in the world who does not emit, but only absorb the magic from everything living around her. Aged ten during the events of New Watch, Nadezhda still keeps her childlike innocence, despite the incredible power she can use anytime she pleases. She meets the potential Zero-level Prophet Innokentiy \\"Kesha\\" Tolkov, during the Tiger's siege of the Night Watch headquarters, where she persuades him in speaking his first prophecy by, as she said, \\"punching him in the nose and threatening to tell everyone he got beat up by a girl unless he says that stupid prophecy\\". During the event Troublous Times, they became classmates as students of the Night Watch. When Anton, Nadya, Kesha and Arina hear Erasmus' prophecy, they find out that Nadya has the power to destroy the Tiger, thus to destroy the Twilight itself. Nadezhda sees the Tiger as a big, strong, flaming-eyed tiger. *Innokentiy \\"Kesha\\" Tolkov - A high-level Prophet (first indications by Anton Gorodetsky presumed a Grand Prophet, while later it was discovered that the boy's potential could be the first, maybe second level), initiated by Semyon into the Night Watch. He was accidentally discovered by Grand Light Mage Anton Gorodetsky in the Sheremetyevo International Airport where he did not want to board the plane, screaming to his mother that it will crash. With his arrival at the Night Watch headquarters after initiation, the Tiger soon came for him, given the fact that he did not say his first prophecy yet. Nobody managed to persuade him into doing it, so Anton called his daughter Nadezhda to try, while Glyba, Zhermenzon and the others blocked the Tiger's path as long as they could. Later on in the book, he seems to have befriended Nadezhda, and it was discovered that the first part of his prophecy was almost as identical as the one Erasmus Darwin said centuries ago. Once approached by the Tiger and told by him that he, the Tiger, must kill him, Kesha, for his own good, Kesha refuses, to which the Tiger confirms the constatation and disappears. *Alexander \\"Las\\" Ulyanov - A Seventh-level Light Mage with a strange sense of humour, and an even stranger look on the world of normal humans, despite him being a Light Other. Before meeting Anton during the events of Twilight Watch, Las was a human who owned an apartment in the Assol living complex. In his free time, he wrote songs and played them with his bass guitar while standing on the window of his apartment. During the encounter between Anton and Kostya Saushkin he witnessed, he was turned into a Light Other by Kostya, who used the book of Fuaran to perform the ritual. Since then, Las has been appointed in the Moscow Night Watch. During the events of New Watch, Las has an argument with Anton about the purpose of protecting people throughout the world from Dark Others when they find reasons to cause great unhappiness themselves, and says that Anton has risen himself above the normal people and that he could not live as a normal human for even a couple of hours, to which Anton blocks his abilities for one day to prove Las wrong. *Semyon - A First-level Light Mage who is experienced in many things that other Others usually learn through magic usage. His age, knowledge, and experience give him a cynical look on the world. Despite this, he's still in the Moscow Night Watch, most commonly performing the job of the Watch's designated driver. During the events of New Watch, Semyon openly confronts Anton about his relationship with his wife, Svetlana, advising him to start changing their friendly feelings toward one another, so as the relationship does not break apart due to the lack of the love that the two had before Nadya was born. He was also assigned to initiate Kesha Tolkov into the Night Watch after Anton accidentally found him. *Alisher Ganiev - A Fourth-level Light Mage from Uzbekistan whose father was a devona to Gesar. Because of Gesar's kindness of turning his (Alisher's) father from a mentally challenged person to an intelligent person, Alisher felt it was his duty to swear his own loyalty to Gesar as thanks for turning his father into a normal person, despite the spell was not permanent. He despises Dark Others, especially Dark Witch Alisa Donnikova, who killed his father. Alisher, hailing from Middle Asia, assisted Anton in locating the ancient Mage Rustam during the events of Final Watch. In New Watch, he was present in the Night Watch headquarters when the confrontation with the Tiger emerged, and helped the other Grand Others in slowing him down while Kesha spoke out his first prophecy. *Valentine \\"Valya\\" Loktev - A Fourth-level Light Mage who drained the joy of humans during a concert in order to remoralize the entire Moscow government, from the president, all the way down to the janitor. He used the Sphere of Denial spell in order to prevent anyone in interfering with him while he's draining the power from the surrounding people. Anton, who joined his co-workers in this event, hit him on the head with a baton, disappointed that the young mage did not use a simple Mage's Shield, since the Sphere of Denial only blocks all magical attacks, and not physical ones. *Anna Tikhonovna - A Light Other whose level has not been written in any of the books. She's employed as a teacher to the newcoming students of the Moscow Night Watch. During the events of all the books she has a minor role, although her role in New Watch is a bit more relevant than in the other books, since she was the only one who knew the exact address of Erasmus Darwin. *Fan Wen Yang - A Fourth-level Light Other of Taiwanese origin. His friend, Lee, was a prophet who the Tiger was chasing in the past. To prove to the Tiger that the two would never tell the prophecy to anyone, people or Other, they arranged that Fan is offered as a tribute by Lee. But Lee tricked Fan into the exact opposite - Fan sacrificed Lee. Wen Yang is considered a homosexual when it comes to his relationship with his deceased friend. However, he says that they were bound together not only like that, but like brothers. He was visited by Anton and Arina, with whom he discussed the odd behavior the Tiger expressed during his siege of the Moscow Night Watch headquarters. *Mark Emmanuilovich Zhermenzon - A Grand Light Battle Mage in retirement. Zhermenzon is of Jewish origin and shows incredible talent when it comes to constructing golems. According to the teachings of the Night Watch, it takes a long time to create a fully functional golem out of clay, metal, stone etc. However, during the encounter with the Tiger on the way to Kesha's home where Semyon was unable to contact anyone via Twilight, Zhermenzon managed to create a golem in a matter of seconds in order to succumb the Tiger. After an injury he obtained in an unknown way, he withdrew from service to the Night Watch. Zhermenzon sees the Tiger as a wise, old Jewish man. *Sergey Glyba - A Grand Light Prophet who withdrew from service to the Night Watch to live the life of a human. He's popular among the Yellow Pages, from where Anton recognizes him. Glyba is known to predict events before they occur, however, before the siege of the Tiger on the Moscow Night Watch headquarters, he could not predict anything, which pointed out that they may be facing a Mirror, since a Mirror acts on intuition, and does not plan anything. *Galina Stanislawowna - A 52- year old Light Other who was a teacher prior to her initiation into the Moscow Night Watch. She is the oldest student in the group that's presented in New Watch. *Dennis - A Light Other, who is a student in the Moscow Night Watch. Prior to his initiation, he was a military member who was discharged during the reforming of the army. Anton assumes that he could grow to be a potentially powerful Battle Mage. *Farhad - A Light Other, who is a student in the Moscow Night Watch. Prior to his initiation, he was (and still is) a manager of an oil company in Kazan, who was very successful and has achieved success in business, which surprised Anton, given the fact that the type of men like Farhad rarely become Light Others. *Pavel - A Light Other, who is a student in the Moscow Night Watch. As Anton describes him, he's a man who grew up with computer games and books about Harry Potter. *David Sakhyan - A seventeen- year old Light Other who was initiated into the Moscow Night Watch, and is now a student in the same. =Dark Others= *Zabulon/Zavulon - A Grand Dark Mage and head of the Moscow Day Watch. His age matches Gesar's. During the events of the New Watch, when Anton was experiencing the thoughts of Erasmus Darwin, it was discovered that Zavulon was Erasmus' teacher, and that he had educated him well, not only in magic usage of the Others, but a historical and philosophical one. It is also discovered, once the goblet that contained the prophecy was broken, that Zavulon did not give up on Erasmus when the Tiger gave chase, but tried to fight him, and, once that was proven to be futile, pleaded for mercy. The Tiger departed since Erasmus had yelled out the prophecy into an oak tree. Zavulon's Twilight form is known to be a hairy, demonic humanoid, larger than usual. He had known of the Tiger during the first encounter with him, but he did not share the information with Anton. It is possible that Gesar knew who they were dealing with but neither did he say anything about it. Zavulon sees the Tiger as a giant, gross demon. *Erasmus Darwin - A high-level Dark Prophet, student of Zavulon who resides in London after retirement from the Day Watch. Due to his lack of contact with the human world, it appears that he has kept his archaic way of speaking. However, after a long conversation with Anton Gorodetsky, Gorodetsky realised that Erasmus was recently in contact with his teacher, and had consulted with him about the arrival of him, Anton. Eventually, he told Anton that he had made two goblets, and that he kept one for himself, but could not resist to not hear his own prophecy. Once he did, his fate was sealed and the Tiger came for him. =Others/Unaffiliated= *Arina - A former Grand Dark Witch and current Grand Light Healer. She's also the thirteenth and last leader of the Witch Conclave. In 1931, under the agreement of both the Moscow Night and Day Watches, and the cautious eye of the Inquisition, she conducted a mass experiment on humans which resulted in the creation of communism. Seeing the consequences of the newly formed society, she went into hibernation for 60 years. After her reawakening, she was shocked to see the advance of not only technology, but medicine as well. Between the events of Twilight Watch and Final Watch she changed her colour, turning from a Dark Witch into a Light Healer, and tried to obtain the Crown of all things, created by Merlin, which she, along with her allies, the Inquisitor Edgar and High Vampire Genaddy \\"Genna\\" Saushkin, thought could bring back all the fallen Others to life. During the events of New Watch, Arina had managed to obtain the copy of the prophecy young Kesha had said during her trip with Anton Gorodetsky to Taiwan. When she heard it, she pleaded her case to Anton again, hoping to correct her mistakes when she heard that no prophecy that was foretold could be defied, but only slowed down or delayed. Arina told Anton the prophecy is regarding his daughter, Nadya, prompting Anton to destroy the goblet which contained the prophecy. Ironically, this activated the prophecy hidden within the goblet. To prove to the Tiger that they will never tell anyone about the prophecy, Anton trapped himself and Arina into the Sarcophagus of Time, a 10-by-10 round room with no exits on any level of the Twilight. It is described as an \\"infinite time capsule floating through the Twilight\\". However, the Tiger rips a hole in the Sarcophagus, pulls Anton out and leaves Arina in a unique situation: No one could escape from the Sarcophagus, however, Arina had the unique Inquisition artefact, the Minoan Sphere, which could open portals anywhere. Due to the pull of 4 Others recently, Anton assumes that the sphere will need some time to recharge if it is not completely depleted. *Tiger - The Tiger, as he explained to Anton himself, is a physical manifestation of the Twilight. He had many names throughout history, Tiger being the most recent, as he was named like that by officer Dmitriy Pastukhov, who can, although human, recognize Light and Dark Others (the first he calls \\"Guard dogs\\" and the Dark Others \\"Wolves\\"). He was thought by most of the Others to be a prophet hunter. Recent information has proven that the Tiger does not hunt prophets, but actually pokes and persuades them into prophesying. Zavulon is the only Other who encountered the Tiger twice (and lived to tell about it), as the Tiger had a confrontation with Zavulon while he was a teacher to young Erasmus Darwin. The Tiger is not a blood-hungry manifestation of the Twilight. If he sees that his prophets will not tell the prophecies to anyone, he does not kill them. Unnecessary victims are what he avoids. He also discovers to Anton, while they are talking outside Arina's cabin, that prophecies are the will of the people of the world, but not all of them have to be realised. In the end of the book, he confirms the doubts that Nadezhda Gorodetskaya can destroy him, and thus, the Twilight. After Kesha does not want to be slain by the Tiger, he agrees and leaves. *Dmitriy \\"Dima\\" Pastukhov - A Human police officer who gained the ability to see and split Light and Dark Others as \\"guard dogs\\" and \\"wolves\\". This ability has manifested since his incident with Anton Gorodetsky during the events of Night Watch, where Anton had to get the officers out of his way fast, and the only thing he could think of is making them to go buy vodka and get drunk. Pastukhov saw Gorodetsky on the Sheremetyevo the same day he saw the Tiger for the first time. He was so scared when he saw him that he defecated in his pants, while his colleague quit his job as he thought life was pointless, and guarding was also pointless. Pastukhov gave Anton the name of \\"the Tiger\\" and also made another appearance when he was invited to the Night Watch as a special guest during Olga's lecture. He also joined Anton when they fought Valentine Loktev in the music concert, as he was uncomfortable to be left alone with a vampire, despite the vampire was \\"on- duty\\" and watched the conversation between Anton and Valya. Trivia * William Blake's poem The Tyger is revealed to be written about the Tiger in the novel. Two Russian translations and two lines from the original English are used to figure out when the Tiger will come for the prophet. * A phrase is uttered in Hebrew by a Jewish Grand battle mage as an order to a golem: ◊©◊ô◊ú◊ö ◊ê◊ì◊ï◊†◊ô ◊î◊†◊õ◊ë◊ì ◊û◊î◊û◊ß◊ï◊ù ◊î◊ñ◊î. The phrase is roughly translated as \\"may the honored sir leave this place\\" (note: ◊ê◊ì◊ï◊†◊ô is more accurately translated as sir, gentleman or mister, than the literal translation of 'my lord').

It occurs at moderate depths in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea and often has a colonial coral growing over the surface. The type locality is Puerto Rico. Description The brown tubular sponge is a large sponge forming mounds that may be a metre (yard) across. The base is encrusted on the substrate or may develop lobes but above this there are several dozen large vertical tubes, narrowing at the top, each with a hollow centre or atrium and a large hole or osculum at the apex. They are up to long and wide and are soft, elastic and resilient. The walls are strengthened by a skeleton of spongin fibres and tiny calcareous spicules. On the side of these tubes there are deep grooves and shallow cup shaped depressions up to across each occupied by a dark reddish brown zoanthid (Parazoanthus sp.). This is a colonial coral living symbiotically with the sponge and the polyps are connected together by tissue called coenenchyme inside the atrium of the sponge. The general colour of the sponge is brownish orange or brick red. Distribution and habitat The brown tubular sponge is found in the Caribbean Sea, the Greater Antilles, Puerto Rico, the northern coast of Brazil and the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico. It typically occurs on reefs at depths between in positions where there is a strong current and the water is clear. Biology The brown tubular sponge is a filter feeder. The current flowing over the top of the sponge draws in water through small pores near the base called ostia. These are lined by flagellated cells called choanocytes. The food particles are engulfed by these and the water exits through the osculi. Only very small particles can enter the sponge and 80% of its nourishment comes from bacteria sized particles. The brown tubular sponge produces a secondary metabolite, sceptrina, an alkaloid with antimicrobial properties.

The objectives of the organization focus on prayer, Bible study and service to the community with an emphasis on evangelism through fraternal outreach and \\"the spread of Christ's Kingdom among men.\\" History The Brotherhood was first organised on St. Andrew's Day, 30 November 1883, as a prayer and Bible study group at St. James Church in Chicago. Initially led by James Lawrence Houghteling, a Yale graduate, local YMCA President, and son of a prominent Chicago business family, the organization grew rapidly. Its mission (the average age of the dozen founding members was about 17 years old) was similar to the older YMCA, and would be similar to Mott's Student Volunteer Movement (1888) and World Student Christian Federation (1895) ‚Äì in that all sought to evangelize the laity by the laity. By 1887, the Brotherhood had 115 chapters and a total membership of more than two thousand men and boys. By a decade later, chapters had been added in England, Japan and China. By 1906, two years after Robert Hallowell Gardener had succeeded Houghteling as President, the BSA had grown to about 17,000 young men and boys in more than 1200 brotherhoods, with the American brotherhoods served by four (soon to be five) traveling secretaries. An Act of Congress incorporated the Brotherhood in 1908. Current activities Operationally independent, but a similar organization was formed in the Scottish Episcopal Church. Active chapters of the Brotherhood exist in Anglican provinces of Australia, Canada, Brazil, Korea, and Japan. Daughters of the King is a sister lay Anglican religious organization to the Brotherhood affiliated with the Episcopal Church. Today, the organization continues its mission to bring others closer to Christ through regular study of the Scriptures (Bible) and bring others to the Church. Many Episcopalian chapters perform charitable works in their communities, raising funds and supplies for charitable organizations as part of Church outreach and aiding members and their families within the community with prayer and support. Additionally, chapters may hold events to raise funds and increase outreach for their parent churches.

In a racing career which lasted from August 2000 to October 2001 she ran seven times and won two races. After winning once from three starts as a two-year-old, she won the Classic 1000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse on her first appearance of the 2001 season. Her subsequent career was disappointing, as she finished unplaced in her three remaining races. At the end of her three-year-old season she was retired from racing to become a broodmare. Ameerat was not regarded as one of the better classic winners. Background Ameerat, a bay horse with a white star and three white socks, was bred in England by her owner Ahmed Al Maktoum. Ameerat was sired by Mark of Esteem an \\"outstanding\\" miler who won the 2000 Guineas and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in 1996. He went on to become a successful stallion, siring The Derby winner Sir Percy and the European champion sprinter Reverence. Her dam, Walimu, won three minor races for Ahmed Al Maktoum and was a granddaughter of the racemare Roussalka who won the Coronation Stakes and two editions of the Nassau Stakes in the mid-1970s. As a descendant of the broodmare Mumtaz Begum, she is a member of the same branch of Thoroughbred family 9-c which produced Shergar, Risen Star and Oh So Sharp. Ameerat was trained at Newmarket, Suffolk by Michael Jarvis and was ridden in all but one of her races by Philip Robinson. Racing career Ameerat began her racing career in a seven furlong maiden race at Goodwood in August 2000. According to the Daily Telegraph she had already acquired a \\"glowing reputation\\" on the basis of her performances in training. She started 3/1 favourite and won comfortably by two lengths from Sayedah, leading the Racing Post to describe her as \\"promising\\". A month later, Ameerat was moved up in class for the Group Three May Hill Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse. Ridden by Frankie Dettori, Ameerat had a troubled race, struggling to obtain a clear run in the straight and then being hampered in the last strides as she finished second by a length to the favourite Karasta. In October, Ameerat started 4/1 second favourite for the Group Two Rockfel Stakes at Newmarket, but finished sixth of the sixteen runners behind Sayedah and Imagine. Ameerat did not contest any of the early trial races in the spring of 2001, but reportedly pleased Jarvis with her performances in training. On 6 May, Ameerat made her three-year-old debut in the 1000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile course. She started at odds of 11/1 in a field of fifteen runners, with Karasta being made the 9/2 favourite. Robinson positioned the filly just behind the front-running Godolphin filly Muwakleh before moving up to challenge for the lead a furlong from the finish. In the closing stages, Ameerat overtook Muwakleh and won by a neck, with Toroca one and three quarter lengths further back in third. Ameerat's victory gave Jarvis his first British classic winner in a thirty-three year training career. He described the moment as \\"a great thrill\\", while Robinson described the winner as a \\"remarkable filly\\". Ameerat's form deteriorated after her classic win. Her next start came in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot where she made little impression, finishing fifth behind the French-trained filly Banks Hill. Matched against colts and older horses in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood in July, Ameerat started a 16/1 outsider and finished eighth of the ten runners behind Noverre. The filly was dropped in class for her final start in the Group Two Sun Chariot Stakes at Newmarket in October. Ameerat was never in serious contention and finished seventh behind Independence. Ameerat remained in training in 2002, and was entered in the Eclipse Stakes, but did not race again. Stud record Ameerat became a broodmare for the Maktoum family's Darley Stud. She has produced several minor winners, but nothing of top class.

Reyes Ferreira began painting on cr√™pe paper, a delicate material not meant to last, as a way of decorating paper meant to wrap sales from his antiques/art store. The decorated paper became popular enough to be sold on its own. Although he began this activity in Guadalajara, he did not produce the bulk of his work until after he moved to Mexico City when he was 58 years old. Here he continued collecting and selling objects such as colonial art and Mexican handcrafts and folk art, being one of the early exponents for the appreciation of these objects. He also spent several hours a day painting. His work was first exhibited in 1950 with his first individual exhibition in 1967 at the Palacio de Bellas Artes after a half century of painting. As a self-taught painter, his works are relatively simple and often are dismissed as folk painting but they were and his aesthetics were praised by famous artists and architects at the time. Life Reyes Ferreira was born on October 17, 1880 in Guadalajara to Buenaventura Reyes y Zavala and Felipa Ferreira Flores. His childhood home was on Morelos Street in Guadalajara, a typical house for the area, with a central courtyard, rooms connected by halls lined with railings and flowerpots. Today the structure is the Museo de los T√≠teres or Marionette Museum. His family was cultured and his father was eccentric and very strict. He was initially homeschooled by his father, but completed primary school at the Liceo de Varones, where he took art classes. After primary school he worked at a number of jobs. While working at a chocolate factory, he noticed the interesting patterns that the grease made on the wrapping paper. He had his first contact with art in 1894, becoming an apprentice at the Loreto y Ancira lithography and print shop. He then worked an art supply store called Casa Pellandina in Guadalajara. He started as general help but then moved onto creating displays and decorating the store‚Äôs windows. From there he began to become known for the decoration of event spaces such as rental halls and churches for events such as weddings and baptisms for wealthy families. Interested in handcrafts and folk art, he frequently visited the El Rincon del Diablo fireworks workshop to watch them paint the Judas figures and fireworks frames. He also worked in silver shops learning how to cast the metal. He designed a number of pieces, some of which remain in the family. He met Amelia Rivas while working at the art store. He began to court her but she died shortly thereafter of tuberculosis . His father died in 1911, leaving him the house and a collection of art, handcrafts and antiques, prompting interest in these areas. The house became something a haven for artists and other bohemian types as he used part of it to sell antiques and art. Another section became something of a museum. He became well known not only to Guadalajara artists but also a number of artists from Mexico City. Reyes was considered eccentric. When Reyes Ferreira bought a book, he always bought two copies, one to cut up to create a new design and the other to keep intact. He began drawing and painting on the crepe paper used to wrap purchases from his store, these drawings became popular and soon clients were buying the paper for its own sake. In 1938, he was denounced for unusual ‚Äúsexual preferences.‚Äù He was arrested along with a number of youths from upper society. He was beaten by police and forced to wear a sign saying that he was a corrupter of youth. The incident forced Reyes Ferreira to sell his childhood home and move to Mexico City. He was helped in his move by artist friends from the capital including Andr√© Breton and Frida Kahlo . He moved into an old colonial house on Milan Street in Colonia Ju√°rez, where he lived with his two sisters, Antonia and Maria. He decorated it unusually, with lighted cubes, various colors and niches for religious objects. The courtyard was used as a studio for painting and he continued to sell antiques and art. He also continued to have his house open to writers, intellectuals and artists such as Carlos Pellicer, Salvador Novo, Juan Soriano, Ra√∫l Anguiano, Jorge Enciso, Diego Rivera as well as architects such as Luis Barrag√°n and Matias Goeritz . When he was 87 years old he traveled for the first time outside Mexico, heading to Paris, Rome, Madrid. A year later he went to the Middle East. He also visited New York. He died on August 6, 1977 at the age 96 in Mexico City. Career Reyes Ferreira is principally known for being a painter and an collector/vender of antiques and art. Despite his early interest in art, he had no intention of becoming an artist. As an antiques vender in Guadalajara, he began painting the crepe paper used for wrapping sales just as a way to decorate it. Sales of his paintings began when customers came to the store to buy the painted paper. Despite the sales of the paper in Guadalajara, he produced 85% of his artwork after he moved to Mexico City when he was 58 years old. He spent several hours a day painting on crepe paper and cardboard in courtyard of his house. His work was exhibited in New York in 1942, London in 1945 and at the Galer√≠a Arquitac en Guadalajara. In 1961 he participated in the Exposici√≥n de los Hartos, an international art event at the Galer√≠a Antonio Souza. However, he did not have his first individual exhibition until 1967, at the Palacio de Bellas Artes after a half century of painting. This was followed by exhibitions at the Casa de la Cultura Jalisciense in 1968, the Galer√≠a Pecanins in Barcelona in 1972, the Ex-convento del Carmen in Guadalajara in 1973 and his last exhibition at the Galer√≠a Pecanins of Mexico City in 1975. Before his death, there was a retrospective of his work at the ExConvento del Carmen in Guadalajara. His work achieved popularity in the United States, South America and Europe as well as Mexico. His works have since been displayed at the Foggs Museum in Boston and the Haymarket Gallery in London. He was a collector and seller of antiques and art, especially colonial art and Mexican handcrafts and folk art. He was one of the pioneers of the movement to appreciate these forms in the 20th century. He was an important promoter of folk and colonial art in Mexico, stating that it was important to understanding the fine arts of the 20th century in Mexico. In both his homes in Guadalajara and Mexico City he sold art and antiques, as well as added to his own collection. He had a good eye for art and antiques, winning the admiration of other collectors such as Franz Mayer. By the time he died, the collection included thousands of objects including 180 paintings, sculptures and other arts from the 17th to 19th centuries which were exhibited in a show called La Mirada Estetica de Jesus Reyes Ferreira at the Museo de Arte Moderno in 2002. He also worked with architects as an advisor on color schemes and decoration. He worked with Luis Barrag√°n in San √Ångel in the 1950s. His first recognition as an artist was in 1962 from the Palacio de Bellas Artes. In 1972 a gallery in San Angel was named after him, holding an exhibition of his work. In 1977 he was honored at the Universidad de Guadalajara along with Ra√∫l Anguiano, Carlos Orozco Romero and Pedro Medina ‚ÄúEl Charro‚Äù receiving the Jos√© Clemente Orozco medal. His biography by Lily Kassner was published by Editorial RM in 2000. Artistry One unique aspect to Reyes Ferreira‚Äôs work is that it was painted mostly on fragile crepe paper and sometimes cardboards, materials not made to last. He generally painted early in the morning for the light and never used an easel. He laid the crepe paper out over a silk base flat on a table in order to withstand the painting process. A scientific analysis shows that he mixed oils, plant based paints and gouaches. The works are fragile and degrade with time, making documentation the only way to preserve them. His works have simple lines with a na√Øve quality, but also with bold colors. It shows influence from Mexican folk art, colonial art and pre Hispanic art as well as popular architecture. The images he painted include roosters, circus acts, angels, skeletons, horses and flowers. There is influence from traditional handcrafts in the depictions of toys. His depictions were not always traditional and included dolls dressed as prostitutes. He was religious which led him to paint images of Christ and the Virgin Mary as well as monks, saints, Adam and Eve, cherubs, angels and devils. He also painted images of dead girls with a sense of Christian piety depicting them as angels. His work has been described as Surrealist, and his use of reduced forms described as Expressionist. His images use bold colors which stray from their forms. He was self-taught, never accepting the title of ‚Äúpainter.‚Äù He claimed that he did not paint but rather ‚Äúcover in mud‚Äù or ‚Äúsmear colors.‚Äù However, his work impressed others. Reyes Ferreira met Marc Chagall when the latter came to Mexico for a performance of the Aleko Ballet. Reyes Ferreira went to the Palacio de Bellas Artes to give some of his paintings to the Russian, which he humbly called ‚Äúpapers.‚Äù Chagall was impressed with the work, calling Reyes Ferreiro the ‚ÄúMexican Chagall.‚Äù On one occasion Picasso remarked about his work that it was fresh and it must be from a young artist, when Reyes Ferreira was 70. Carlos Monsiv√°is called his work ‚Äúa song of happiness.‚Äù Reyes Ferreira‚Äôs two main influences were Jos√© Clemente Orozco, also from Guadalajara and Jos√© Guadalupe Posada, as can be seen with images of skulls with flowers. Unlike these two, his work was not social criticism. His images are based on popular and folk art but without obvious effort to promote Mexican identity such as was the case with Mexican muralism even though Reyes Ferreira admired Orozco. He influenced a number of architects in color schemes such as Luis Barragan, Mathias Goeritz, Max Cetto, Juan Sordo Madaleno and Ricardo Legorreta . He was admired by many architects and others for his sense of aesthetics although his wilder ideas were not or could not be executed. There has been no systematic or in-depth study of his work. One reason for this is that for many years, art critics dismissed his art as folk painting, with his activities as a collector and antiques dealer considered more important. Although part of a number of museum collections, they are generally not on display or in museum catalogs of the most important Mexican museums such as MUNAL or the Museo de Arte Moderno. The Fundaci√≥n Luis Barrag√°n holds 194 of his works which were either sold or given to the architect. Despite the lack of museum attention, the works have been frequently forged.

Saumarez was a prolific writer, with advanced ideas regarding the subject of medicine and medical education. Coleridge identified and praised Saumarez for his \\"masterly force of reasoning, and the copiousness of induction, with which he has assailed, and (in my opinion) subverted the tyranny of the mechanic system in physiology; established not only the existence of final causes, but their necessity and efficiency to every system that merits the name of philosophical; and, substituting life and progressive power for the contradictory inert force, has a right to be known and remembered as the first instaurator of the dynamic philosophy in England.\\" (Biographia Literaria, Chapter 12) Life The Circus in Bath Saumarez was born in Guernsey on 13 November 1764 to Matthieu Saumarez and Cartarette Le Marchant. Both parents died when he was young, and he later went to London to study medicine at the London Hospital. His older brothers were Admiral James Saumarez, 1st Baron de Saumarez and General Sir Thomas Saumarez Saumarez trained under Sir William Blizard. He was admitted a member of the Company of Surgeons on 7 April 1785. He married Martha Le Mesurier on 7 January 1786 in Guernsey. She died in 1801 and on 29 May 1804 he married a widow, Mrs Elizabeth Hetherington (n√©e Enderby). He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1834. In 1788, Saumarez became surgeon to the Magdalen Hospital, Streatham, until 1 March 1805 when he was appointed an honorary governor. Saumarez had a large and lucrative practice in London until 1818. He then retired to Bath, where he died at 21 The Circus on 28 January 1835.  New Physiology  = Bacon, Hunter and True Science = Saumarez dedicates his book on physiology to Dr. John Hunter amongst others. :To the late MR. J. HUNTER, to DR. GOODWIN, SPALLANZANI, and a few others, we are eminently indebted for many valuable facts obtained through the medium of experiments ... thereby manifesting the natural condition of things without altering it. Saumarez also praises Bacon for having set down a true method of approach to nature, through direct observation based on clear ideas, not just the collection of facts. :The carpenter who chips the timber, and the mason who polishes the marble, are not to be considered as the men of science; but he alone, who, from a precise knowledge of principles and of causes, is able to direct those materials to be arranged with order, form, and symmetry. It was with that end in view, that his lordship analysed before he generalised; that he has separated the individual from the species; the species from the genus; and, from a multitude of effects, endeavoured to arrive at cause. True science for Saumarez is designed to analyse facts to arrive at the necessary historical understanding and basic or first principles which takes sense impression to understanding. :Without the full possession of these permanent and universal facts, a general, not a particular knowledge of any subject can ever be obtained: without history, we can never have definition; and without axiom, there can be no science. :Knowledge, properly so called, does not simply consist in the impressions made on the senses by the operations of external phenomena; true knowledge can only be admitted to exist, when we are in full possession of the cause whence the effects are derived; and he alone can be denominated the man of science, who is able to connect the cause with the effect. Saumarez argued that the level of knowledge in his day was poor and corrupted by false principles. In particular, the study of chemistry was not only still ignorant of the principles of \\"elective attraction,\\" but sought to extend the principles that only held for dead and common matter to the realm of living matter. :It is greatly to be lamented that the pursuits of the chemists, instead of being confined to their proper objects‚Äîto the examination of the qualities of matter, dead and common‚Äîhave been equally, but improperly, directed and extended to the investigation of living matter also; hoping to explore the causes of animation, and of vital action, from chemical phenomena, which are the inevitable attributes of decomposition and decay. = Three Systems of Matter = Instead of the usual classification into animal, vegetable and mineral, Saumarez proposes a classification based on 'matter.' :I shall class the whole system of nature, as it has been called, and the matter of which it is composed, under the three distinct heads,‚Äî of common,‚Äîof living,‚Äîand of dead matter. :FIRST, By living matter, I comprehend the various orders of living beings with which the universe is replenished and adorned. :SECONDLY, By dead matter, I confine myself to the exuvi√¶ of animals, and of vegetables; as well as to the whole substance of which these beings are composed, after the actions of life are at an end, and the state which is known by the appellation of death. :THIRDLY, By common matter, I mean the primitive, or original materials, or elements, of which the world is composed; matter which either, has never received the participation of life, or having received, has lost it, and been resolved back into a common state. Saumarez distinguishes between the property of living matter that is general and diffused through the whole system, and active - materia vitae diffusa - and that which is particular and dormant. The former maintains the preservative (sustentive) and participative (generative) capacity of a living organism. The principle of life is the principium vitae diffusum. We could also say that the former is the inherent capacity of the system to respond, and the latter is the result of the interaction of the former with the exciting powers, the stimuli of Dr. Brown and the Brunonian system of medicine. Saumarez claims that Hunter preceded Brown with his principle of a living principle, which Brown then expressed in the idea of excitation as the stimuli for bringing potential life or excitability to actual life or excitement. Saumarez then also distinguishes between physiology and physics. :To physiology, belongs the province of investigation [of] the properties of living matter. To physics such as is dead, or common... = Different Laws for Different Systems of Matter = Each system of matter \\"not only in the progress of its evolution, but in the actions it performs, is governed and impelled by laws, distinct and peculiar\\". The laws and principles governing dead or common matter (chemistry) cannot be employed to any useful end in understanding living matter (physiology). As an example, the \\"assimilating and convertible power\\" or \\"converting power of the assimilating organ\\" found in digestion, as \\"proved by Mr. Hunter and Spallanzani\\" cannot be explained by chemical laws and actions, but must be performed by a \\"living power resident in the organ and its secretions, in this case, that of the gastric juice of animals and man.\\" From all of his observations of the facts from previous experiments, Saumarez is led to the logical conclusion that \\"the process of digestion...is not a chemical, but a living, act.\\" He is further led to conclude that this living power, which is able to first dissolve, diffuse and then re-arrange external matter into a new unified form, \\"pervades throughout the whole range of animated existence\\" whether animal or vegetable. And the essence of this living power is that it is able to overcome the chemical laws, so that they resist being reduced to the elements (entropy). Saumarez also addresses the living power of the mind which is necessary to relate to living sense experience. :Although the organs of sense are the avenues through which impressions from external objects are first made, it is from the native vigor and power of the mind, that ideas are made to flow; while the spark comes from without, the flame resides within; although it is set in motion by external means, it is from the power of mind alone, by which those ideas and motions ought to be directed. :The mind on the contrary, which subsists not like the organs in parts, but as a whole total and universal, receives the impressions wholly and totally, and contemplates altogether, and at once, the various attributes of the body, a perception of which the organs of sense had separately obtained. While the organs of sense, therefore, distinguish the particular attributes of a body, the mind, on the contrary, receives and conceives these perceptions, universally; things partible it views impartibly; things divisible, indivisibly; things temporal, eternally. This correlates with his contemporary Coleridge's view of the imagination as a creative power (governed by laws that are 'the very powers of growth and production\\"), that is \\"vital, even as all objects (as objects) are essentially fixed and dead\\"). As with Coleridge, Saumarez sees mind and consciousness to be a creative function that is higher and greater than sense-experience, indeed, as Coleridge puts it, \\"in the mind's self-experience there are evidently two powers at work, which relatively to each other are active and passive; and this is not possible without an intermediate faculty, which is at once both active and passive.\\" :Thus, the act of thinking presents two sides for contemplation, ‚Äì that of external causality, in which the train of thought may be considered as the result of outward sensations, of accidental combinations, of fancy, or the associations of memory, ‚Äìand on the other hand, that of internal causality, or of the energy of the will on the mind itself. In philosophical language, we must denominate this intermediate faculty in all its degrees and determinations, the IMAGINATION, the compleating power which unites clearness with depth, the plenitude of the sense with the comprehensibility of the [intellect], impregnated with which the [intellect] itself becomes [understanding]‚Äì an intuitive and living power. (Biographia Literaria) = Duality of Living Power = Saumarez also sees that the nature of this living power is both sustentive and generative, and has been spoken of throughout history in different ways, including most recently by Dr. John Brown. :It is by the energy of this same living power, resident in the seed of plants, and in the fecundated ova of animals, that the acorn becomes evolved into an oak,‚Äîthe infant foliage expanded into leaves,‚Äîand the whole process of nutrition and of growth carried on. It is this power which constitutes the architect and the fabricator, by which the whole machine is erected; it is the base on which the whole stands, it forms the bond of its elementary parts,‚Äîthe cement that unites them into one whole; it is the cause primary and efficient, whence the individuality of every living system arises, in which the form and the sex it assumes, essentially reside; by which, the human species differs from the brute, the brute from the vegetable, the vegetable itself from matter inanimate and common; this power it is, which I call life. The matter, which this power has assimilated and organised, it is, which I call living matter. It is this principle, which has been named by ARISTOTLE, eidoz,‚Äîby HARRIS, form‚Äîby STAHL, vis medicatrix natur√¶‚Äîby HALLER, vis vit√¶‚Äîby BLUMENBACH, nisus formativus‚Äîby J. BROWN, excitability ... and by HUNTER, principle of life. This last term appears to me so appropriate and distinct, that I shall consequently retain it. The principle of life may be defined to be \\"that power, by whose energy different species of matter are assimilated to one kind, a living system organised and formed; and the various parts of which it is composed, are protected and preserved from decomposition and decay. = Organization of Life = Thus, what we see in living organisms is simply an organisation of powers, forces and energies according to real prototypes or ideas in the non-material, super-sensible domain. It is by way of this living power that health and disease derive. :Admitting these undeniable truths, the conclusion presses itself upon the mind with force irresistible, that these attributes must, of necessity, belong to a principle immaterial, and incorporeal, by whose activity, matter formless becomes organised;‚Äîby whose vivacity it becomes endowed with the power of action, and of motion; exerting the same influence, and governing by the same laws, every particle of this matter which it has assimilated; and constituting the power whence the organisation originates‚Äîthe fountain, whence health and disease are made to flow. This living power exists prior to any \\"organic action\\" and this pre- existing state Saumarez terms 'pre-disposition'. Like Brown, he also sees that the potential or dormant living power must be brought into action and motion. :It is the same thing with respect to the living principle, and the different organs which it has produced; it not only demands a certain state and temperature of the medium in which it is placed, but particular kinds of food, as well as particular conditions of it, before that dormant power can become power active, and the phenomena be produced of organic action. Saumarez sees in the regular, organised functions and processes of living beings a unifying cause within the system itself, the living principle that keeps everything operating in a harmonious whole, both through the power of expansion, growth and that of containment or formation. :When we behold the regularity with which the actions of vegetables are performed, as well as the simplicity in the construction of their frame,‚Äîwe are naturally led to conclude, that those actions, constant and definite as they seem to be, must flow from the operation of causes which exist uniformly and invariably the same, without any opposing or controlling power; residing within the system itself, by the energy of which those actions can either be suppressed, or prevented... = Living Power Not Simply Irritability = This living power is not to be equated or reduced to the nervous or sensitive power of plants and animals. The first is extensive throughout and the second is more limited in extent, as not all plants and animals have it, or it does not operate throughout the organism, absolutely or equally (in health). The sensitive power, however, is generally prevalent in animals and gives them knowledge of the external world. The cause of sensation lies not so much in the object, but in the sensory organ receiving the impression. This sensitive power is the basis for the pleasure principle, and in its lower form, the instincts and their actions. In humans, however, there is something else besides the instincts. = Polarity Between Instinct and Consciousness = :In terms of the capacity for instinct and the use of the sensory organs, man is inferior compared to a given animal. Vegetables, equally, have a superior power of propagation to that of animals and man. As one rises higher, the power of propagation is exchanged for that of sensation, and sensation exchanged for something else in man - mind or consciousness. In man, the animal instincts must be mastered and converted by a higher power, that of self-consciousness through the power of rational thought. Instinctual action is not freedom, but the path of degeneration for man. Saumarez also speaks of the power of the mind to integrate sensations. These connect with Locke's ideas on self-consciousness (see Romantic medicine) and Coleridge's ideas, noted above regarding the power of imagination, both primary and later, in a more conscious way, secondary imagination. :Although the organs of sense are the avenues through which impressions from external objects are first made, it is from the native vigor and power of the mind, that ideas are made to flow; while the spark comes from without, the flame resides within; although it is set in motion by external means, it is from the power of mind alone, by which those ideas and motions ought to be directed.  Mind and Consciousness  Man is a reasoning and ideating being, not simply an instinctual one, and the development and evolution of consciousness allows him to direct and free himself from the compulsion of the instincts. As Saumarez states, :the more he indulges his senses, the power of his mind becomes progressively weakened; that instead of attaining the prerogative of being a free agent, he continues in the condition of a child, or of a man who lives like a brute, impelled and chained down. And this power of thought, an internal experience, is higher than that of sense experience (\\"the objects of intellect [cognition] cannot be derived from objects of sense; otherwise, they would be subordinate, and not superior to sensible things\\"). The objects of sense experience are there to help man perfect his self-awareness and self- consciousness and \\"perfect\\", that is, raise his mind and consciousness to higher levels, all the way up to spirit, the main concern of Romantic epistemology (to overcome the split between Nature and God or Spirit). :Instead of being confined, like vegetables, to the production of the species; or, as in the brute, to the gratification of the senses; these objects constitute, in man, the lowest of the ends which he is designed to attain: those which are most congenial to his nature, and which form the true end of his existence, more especially consist, in the perfection of his MIND. Like Brown, it is also those experiences that are agreeable or \\"congenial\\" that act to raise the mind and consciousness, and these resonant experiences then activate the mind to dwell on a higher and deeper, objective need against the subjective wants derived from the baser instincts. :It is by the proper exercise of these powers... directed to those objects which seem to be congenial to its nature, that man feels conscious that he constitutes the first of all generated beings; that although excited by appetite and sense, he is nevertheless able to resist, to subdue, and even to act in opposition to those wants; often compelling the body to fast, when it craves for food,‚Äîto receive medicines which convey impressions nauseous and painful;‚Äîto expose itself to the inclemency of the seasons, and to various dangers: to labor and to fatigue; and patiently to submit to death itself. This power of the mind (cognition) for Saumarez is self-contained and self-referential. :It is, however, very plain that we have a power of interrupting a train of thoughts, and of dwelling more intensely upon particular ideas, and even of occasionally directing our reflections and contemplations into new channels; and this power alone, is sufficient to constitute man, a free agent.  Physiology: Examples  Saumarez provides many examples of living actions which cannot be explained by or reduced to chemical/physical processes. After vegetable or animal food has been digested by a living system, the commutation it has sustained is total and complete... :The process of digestion therefore, by means of which different kinds of food are assimilated into one kind, is not a chemical but a living [alchmical] act... :... it is lawful, and we are from necessity led to conclude, that the commutation food obtains in the living system, is a vital and not a chemical act, and that the efficient cause of this commutation does not arise from any active property which the food contains, but is owing to the power of the system in which it is received, and by which the new arrangement of its parts is formed. :.. the quality of the matter acted upon and changed by the organ, bears no similitude to that which it originally possessed: instead therefore of things external acting upon the living system, it is the living system that acts upon things external. :Far different indeed are the effects that are produced when things external act upon the living system, when the organs have not the power of acting upon, or even resisting the action of, the substances they receive...Instead of animal or vegetable matter being converted into chyle, putrefaction and fermentation take place. :It is to the power by the energy of which every living system is protected and preserved from decomposition and decay, and by which the different substances it receives are assimilated and changed, that I attach the idea of Life; the Vis Medicatrix Natur√¶ of Stahl; the Vis Vit√¶ of Haller; the Nisus Formativus of Blumenbach; the Living Principle of Mr. Hunter; the Excitability of Dr. Brown... Saumarez also takes from Hunter his example concerning the action of plant sap in a living and isolated context. :Such is the nature of the vegetable system, that the temperature of its parts seems in a considerable degree to depend on that of the surrounding medium. Mr. Hunter, in a number of experiments which he made upon the sap of different trees, found it frequently to be as low as 15 degrees of Fahrenheit, and that then it preserved its natural and unfrozen state; but, on the contrary, when it was taken out of the vessels of the tree, it would freeze at the elevated temperature of 32¬∞. The cause of this diversity evidently arose from the different circumstances under which it was situated: in the one it was in union with the whole of the living system, resisting, by virtue of its living power, the external operation of cold; its vitality therefore preserved its fluidity: in the other, the loss of vitality which the sap had sustained by separation from the system to which it belonged, weakened its powers of preservation and of resistance; it therefore underwent the same changes of congelation that matter of an inanimate kind is found to sustain. In another case that Saumarez provides we can also see the degeneration of living fluids, in this case hepatic bile, from a yellow, active state, to a greenish, almost black state when it becomes cystic bile. For Saumarez, this is a function of a law of nature governing organic action and involving a polarity between 'sensible' properties and 'living' properties, or between living matter and common matter. :The question then is, whether the sensible properties of cystic bile above enumerated, arise from any addition it receives from the gall-bladder, or whether they do not proceed from a privation of its living principle, the loss of which makes the whole to be decomposed into its constituent parts. :It seems more probable that the sensible properties cystic bile ultimately assumes, arise from a deprivation of its preservative power, by which it begins to lose the identity of its own nature, and undergoes nearly the same changes by residence in the gall-bladder that it would have done out of the living system. :It is a law universally true, that the further effects depart from their causes, the power of retaining their own qualities is proportionally weakened and diminished. :Since then the gall-bladder is the part of the whole hepatic system most remote from the liver (the cause and source of biliary secretion), every instant of time bile remains in the gall- bladder, it is constantly changing from a better to a worse condition ‚Äî from a living to a dying state. It is by the principle of this law that we are to take hepatic bile as the standard by which the quality of cystic bile is to be measured, and by which we are to conclude that the sensible qualities it assumes are foreign to the excellence of its nature. In this regard, Saumarez also refers to functions of the mind, which increase as corporeal powers or vitality wanes, an idea also correlative to Coleridge's views on the creative imagination and mind, but also the reverse. :If I were disposed to admit that maternal desires or propensities could have any influence on the offspring, it would only be a stronger proof of the imperfection of the species; it would shew, that when the imagination is most strong the power of corporeal perfection is most weak; weaker, therefore, in the most enlightened than in the most imbecile of mankind; and, finally, weaker in the brute than in the vegetable tribe.

The system was first noted as a weak tropical disturbance on October 27, to the north of the Northern Cook Islands. Over the next few days atmospheric convection surrounding the system remained disorganized, as it moved towards the southwest and was affected by strong upper-level north-easterly winds and moderate to strong vertical wind shear. The system was subsequently named Martin during October 31, after it had rapidly developed further and shown a marked improvement organization. Meteorological history On October 27, 1997 the Fiji Meteorological Service started to monitor a weak tropical disturbance, that had developed to the north of the Northern Cook Islands. Over the next few days, atmospheric convection surrounding the system remained disorganised, as the system moved to the southwest and was affected by strong upper-level north-easterly winds and moderate to strong vertical wind shear. Late on October 30, the United States Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Center (NPMOC) designated the disturbance as Tropical Cyclone 04P, as it had become a tropical depression. During the next day the system started to show a marked improvement in organisation and began rapidly developing, before the FMS named it Martin at 1500 UTC after it had developed into a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. When it was named, Martin was located about to the west of Manihiki Atoll in the Northern Cook Islands and had started to re-curve and move towards the south-east during that day. Early on November 1, the FMS reported that the system had become a category 2 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale, before the NPMOC reported that Martin had become equivalent to a category one hurricane on the Saffir- Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS). During that day as the cyclone season officially started, Martin continued to intensify and became a category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale, as it passed about to the south of Manihiki. During November 2, the system continued to intensify as it moved towards the southeast and became equivalent to a category 2 hurricane on the SSHWS, as it moved towards the French Polynesian Society Islands of Bellingshausen, Mopelia and Scilly. During the next day, Martin passed near the Society Islands as it developed an eye, before the FMS reported at 06:00 UTC that the system had peaked as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone with 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 155 km/h (100 mph). The NPMOC also reported at around that time that Martin had peaked with 1-minute sustained windspeeds of 185 km/h (115 mph), which made it equivalent to a category 3 hurricane on the SSHWS. After peaking in intensity Martin started to weaken, as it interacted with a frontal system and started to accelerate towards the south- southeast. During November 4, Martin passed within of Tahiti as it became a category 2 tropical cyclone and started to transition into an extratropical cyclone. Later that day, the NPMOC issued their final advisory on system as it had become equivalent to a tropical depression, vertically sheared with its surface center dislocated about from its upper level center. During November 5, Martin weakened below tropical cyclone intensity, before it was last noted on November 8 in the Southeastern Pacific Ocean over to the southeast of Adamstown in the Pitcairn Islands. Preparations, impact and aftermath Martin caused significant damage and 28 deaths as it affected the Cook Islands and French Polynesia, while the name was retired from the lists of tropical cyclone names for the region due to the impact of this system. Martin devastated Manihiki in the Cook Islands. Almost every building on the island was destroyed by the storm surge, 10 people were killed, and 10 more persons reported missing and were later declared dead by the Cook Islands Coroner. 360 people were evacuated to Rarotonga, with most never returning. When the centre was closest to the island, the automatic weather station reported a lowest pressure of 994hPa, sustained winds of 20 m/s, and a highest gust of 29 m/s. However, this was the last meteorological report from the station before it was destroyed by storm surge. Within the Cook Islands, Martin was the deadliest known tropical cyclone to affect the Cook Islands in over a century, after it caused 19 deaths within the Islands.
