It may be congenital, surgically created for hemodialysis treatments, or acquired due to pathologic process, such as trauma or erosion of an arterial aneurysm. Presentation =Associated conditions= *Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia =Complications= Just like berry aneurysm, an intracerebral arteriovenous fistula can rupture causing subarachnoid hemorrhage. Causes * Congenital (developmental defect) * Rupture of arterial aneurysm into an adjacent vein * Penetrating injuries * Inflammatory necrosis of adjacent vessels * Intentionally created (for example, Cimino fistula as vascular access for hemodialysis). Blood must be aspirated from the body of the patient, and since arteries are not easy to reach compared to the veins, blood may be aspirated from veins. The problem is that the walls of the veins are thin compared to those of the arteries. The AV fistula is the solution for this problem because, after 4-6 weeks, the walls of the veins become thicker due to the high arterial pressure. Thus, this vein can now tolerate needles during hemodialysis sessions. Mechanism When an arteriovenous fistula is formed involving a major artery like the abdominal aorta, it can lead to a large decrease in peripheral resistance. This lowered peripheral resistance causes the heart to increase cardiac output to maintain proper blood flow to all tissues. The physical manifestations of this typically consist of a relatively normal systolic blood pressure accompanied by decreased diastolic blood pressure, resulting in a wider pulse pressure. Normal blood flow in the brachial artery is 85 to 110 milliliters per minute (mL/min). After the creation of a fistula, the blood flow increases to 400–500 mL/min immediately, and 700–1,000 mL/min within 1 month. A brachiocephalic fistula above the elbow has a greater flow rate than a radiocephalic fistula at the wrist. Both the artery and the vein dilate and elongate in response to the greater blood flow and shear stress, but the vein dilates more and becomes \\"arterialized\\". In one study, the cephalic vein increased from 2.3 mm to 6.3 mm diameter after 2 months. When the vein is large enough to allow cannulation, the fistula is defined as \\"mature\\".Vascular, Vol. 14, Supl. 1, Nov. 2006, p. S1 An arteriovenous fistula can increase preload. AV shunts also decrease the afterload of the heart. This is because the blood bypasses the arterioles which results in a decrease in the total peripheral resistance (TPR). AV shunts increase both the rate and volume of blood returning to the heart.

It centers on Naomi Armitage, a highly advanced \\"Type-III\\" android. In 1996, the series was edited into a film called . The series was followed up in 2002 with a sequel, set some years after the original story. Plot =Armitage III and Poly- Matrix= In 2046, the overpopulation of Earth has led to the colonization of Mars—with the aid of the \\"first type\\" androids, men were able to begin terraforming the unfriendly environment of Mars and build the city Saint Lowell. Some time after the start of colonization, the city is completed and inhabited by great numbers of people and \\"Second type\\" robots, much improved versions of the \\"First types\\". Ross Sylibus, a middle-aged policeman from Chicago, flies to Saint Lowell using a space shuttle. Sylibus asked to be transferred to the Martian Police Department to escape from his past and haunting memories of his previous partner being killed by a robot. At the Saint Lowell's space port he is to meet his new partner—a young woman named Naomi Armitage. On the same shuttle as Sylibus travels Kelly McCanon—\\"the last country singer in the Universe\\". As the shuttle nears the terminal, a mysterious man is seen entering the cargo section; soon after this, the intruder is noticed and the alarms go off. Later, as Ross gets off the shuttle, he witnesses a disturbing scene at the airport. He bumps into the mysterious man with a big suitcase and two guards. Soon after that, Armitage orders the men to stop and get their hands up. Puzzled, Ross notices a few drops of blood spilling from the mysterious man's suitcase. The two robot guards are killed by Armitage and the mysterious man is wounded, but flees. However, he leaves his suitcase behind—inside of which is the dead body of Kelly McCanon. To everybody's surprise and horror, McCanon turns out to be a robot: a new, never-seen-before \\"Third type\\" android that is superficially identical to humans. Later, the mysterious man hacks into the public television system and replays the security camera footage. The tape shows the man killing Kelly McCanon and reveals the fact of her being a robot to the entire city. The mysterious man, René D'anclaude, reveals that the Third types have been among the regular people for a long time and nobody can tell them apart from humans. He also reveals a list of Thirds—and it turns out that a lot of well-known people are actually robots. Riots begin in the city as people start to capture and burn all the Thirds they can find. Meanwhile, René D'anclaude proceeds with his extermination of the Thirds. The two main characters start their investigation and eventually realize that the victims are women. One of the dying victims, Jessica Manning, sends out a message with the list of Thirds to save them from being slaughtered. Armitage receives it and pursues D'anclaude. Armitage is eventually revealed to be a third and goes into hiding as the police hunt for her. Ross seeks her out as she enlists the help of a male third named Julian Moore. D'anclaude then attacks them and is revealed to be a second. While the police drop the case with D'anclaude's supposed capture, Armitage and Julian search a databank for information on her origins. Armitage eventually defeats D'anclaude, but is too late to stop Julian from being killed. She and Ross break into the hospital D'anclaude was recovering in, branding themselves as criminals after the rescue. Armitage and Ross later go off in search of her \\"father\\", Dr. Asakura, only to learn he had lost his mind, as explained by a gentler, reprogrammed version of D'anclaude, living with delusions of creating \\"Fourths\\". They learn that the Thirds were originally \\"assassinroids\\" - deadly robots with organic components, capable of infiltrating secure facilities by masquerading as humans. This project was re- purposed to bolster the low Martian birth rate, itself a result of Earth's strongly feminist society encouraging the immigration of males and discouraging the immigration of females. However, Earth's discovery of the Thirds incensed its leadership, forcing Mars to reverse its plans; Earth demanded that the Thirds be annihilated, offering female immigrants as a reward - and threatening war if not obeyed. The assassinroid program was thus re-activated to hunt and destroy the Thirds, which had vanished into the Martian population after their creation. These revelations shock and dismay Armitage, leading her to seek comfort in Ross, who affirms her value as a living being before consummating their relationship. The next day, after Asakura deactivates Armitage so he can install angelical wings and particle cannons on her chassis, the military kills Asakura, and Armitage and Ross eventually finish off the military. Months later, Ross returns to Mars, using false IDs, however Armitage throws hers away after Ross Sylibus' arrival. Armitage tells Ross that she is pregnant with their child. =Dual-Matrix= It had been several years since the events of the previous OVA. Naomi Armitage and Ross Sylibus, now living under assumed identities, are living in St. Lowell on Mars, along with their daughter Yoko. Ross now works for a company seeking to restore oceans to Mars by using ice asteroids. However, a new effort to restore the Third project prompts Naomi to travel to Earth to figure out what is happening. Meanwhile, Ross saves a facility from a group of terrorists and is declared a Martian hero. When Armitage arrives on Earth, she confronts Colonel Strings, hero of the First Error, which was a suppression of a robot uprising, which in reality, was to cover up the existence of the Thirds. But then he is shot by agents of an Earth Robotronics Corporation. Its vice president, Demetrio Mardini, asks Armitage to give the data on how Thirds can conceive so humanity can create a race of beings who exist to serve. She refuses so he resorts to force and unleashes a robot that scrambles her eyes. She manages to use her telepresence abilities to hack into its system and overload it. She then escapes but is damaged and is found by a repairer third named Mouse, who prides himself on his skill and frequently brags that he's a \\"genius\\". However, Mouse is also an informant to Demetrio and presents the data he found on Armitage; but he only got the recent data and Demetrio wants the conception data. Mouse claims that he did not know about the conception data, and also that if it existed it would be with what he gave him; but Demetrio refuses to believe either of these and tries to brutally force it with two clones of Armitage, who severely injure Mouse. He does not get anything and throws Mouse in the trash. Mouse swears revenge. Back on Mars, prime minister Fredrick O'Hara sends Ross to Earth to represent the planet in the support of robot rights, promising amnesty from the charges against them. However, Demetrio's agents captured Yoko while Ross was away from the hotel, and is threatened that he will not see Yoko again if he votes for the Rights Bill. With a little reluctance, Ross remains neutral on the bill. Demetrio's agents, however, reveal that they were planning on killing Ross from the start, contrary to their deal. After a car chase, Armitage is able to save him at the very last moment. Together, they vow to rescue their daughter. They storm Demetrio's compound; Armitage deals with Demetrio while Ross saves Yoko. The same robot Armitage encountered earlier had been upgraded to withstand her telepresence attack. Meanwhile, Ross manages to locate Yoko in a freezer. Elsewhere, Demetrio demands the secret in exchange for forgetting the damages they committed against him and his company. Armitage lures him closer, presumably to tell him what he wants to know; but she ends up kicking him in the crotch and telling him that Third conception is not simply data, it is about true love. With that she escapes again, forcing Demetrio to unleash the clones on her. She manages to evade the two and meets up with Ross and Yoko. Yoko is overjoyed to see her mother but recoils when she sees Armitage's metal shoulder that was scraped off by the clones. Just then, they attack. While Armitage holds them off, Ross and Yoko make their way to an unused space elevator. It is here that Yoko shows that she has a photographic memory, leading them to the space elevator whose location she determined from a map she saw minutes beforehand (Ross comments that she is \\"quite the little genius\\"). Soon, Armitage flees to Mouse, who repairs the damage and gives her a program that will allow her to go beyond her limited fighting abilities. He tells her that the password is \\"Heaven's Door\\"; but that if she exceeds more than her internal battery can handle, she will \\"be knocking at the Pearly Gates for real\\". She also has him do her one more favor: broadcast the footage of the Third massacre attempts all over Earth and Mars (upon seeing it himself, Mouse comments, \\"I think it's inhuman, and I'm a robot!\\"). This compels Demetrio to command the clones to prevent the family from leaving. After both clones are beaten, Demetrio tries having the elevator's defenses fired on their shuttle only to be killed by the last remaining clone, who is at the time controlled by what was left of Poly-Matrix's Julian Moore. Without Demetrio's authorization, the turrets do nothing. A hologram of Julian Moore then appears, wishing the family goodbye. The movie ends with the family enjoying a day at the beach on Mars, on Naomi's birthday. In a post-credits scene, Mouse salvages one of the Armitage clones for himself. Characters =Main characters= ; : :Naomi Armitage is an illegal \\"Third type\\" android—the most human-like robot ever. Armitage's creator is Dr. Asakura, whom she refers to as \\"papa\\". Armitage becomes Ross Syllabus' partner when he joins the Mars Police Department. She and Ross ultimately fall in love. Although she is simply called Armitage by most of the other characters, including Ross in Poly-Matrix, Ross mostly calls her Naomi in Dual-Matrix. ; : :A police officer who transferred to the Mars Police Department from Earth's Chicago Police Department after an incident with a robot that left him crippled and his partner dead. He is only able to walk using a cybernetic leg. This incident is the cause for his disdain of robots. During his assignments with Armitage, he loses his arm as well, requiring another replacement cybernetic limb to be put in place. This causes him some grief, as he is slowly becoming what he hates the most. He soon falls in love with his new partner Naomi, and becomes a renegade cop in order to help her. Years later, he changed his name to Kevin Oldman and lives with Armitage and their daughter, Yoko. =Supporting characters= ; : :Dr. Asakura is an artificial intelligence researcher and, along with René D'anclaude, the creator of the thirds. Naomi considers him her father. At some point in the past, Asakura's mind was altered–this causes him to appear really crazy at times and prone to violent outbursts, when at other times, he is completely sane and rational. Realizing that the government has tracked Armitage and Ross to his laboratory, he completes an upgrade upon Armitage's chassis, one which gives her the power of flight and two particle cannons (Naomi comments that the wings are \\"too angelic for my taste\\", but does not deny that they are useful). Consequently, he stays in the lab and dies among his projects after the government destroys the entire complex with a tracking missile in an effort to destroy both Armitage and Ross. ; : :René D'anclaude is a doctor that worked with Dr. Asakura to create the Third types. His appearance is used for the line of \\"assassinroids\\" that were later used to destroy all the Third types, as well as a base template for their creation. After Armitage and Ross go rogue, D'anclaude is moved to a secretive section of a Mars hospital and the surrounding area is barricaded by official government tanks and droid troops. Armitage and Ross easily face this challenge and smuggle him out, having to avoid the assassinroid D'anclaude in the process. ; : :Julian, whose alias is \\"Pluto\\", is the last model of the Third series, and the only male. He helps Naomi discover her true identity and her origin. An adept hacker, Julian attempts to help Armitage by delving into the files surrounding the creation of the Thirds. His attempt however, is hijacked by the D'anclaude assassinroid who controlled him via a planted computer virus. Armitage destroys the viral link, but it also causes Julian's body to self destruct. His last words to her is that maybe he'll get to meet the \\"real\\" D'anclaude. Sometime after his death, Armitage mourns his loss until Ross reminds her that Julian had backed up his programming into the main registry. Therefore, it might be possible to bring him back. He returns in Dual-Matrix, but only as a ghost program in the systems. He does provide information and remote control aid to Armitage. ; : :Randolph is the lieutenant of the Martian Police and head of the Technical Criminal SWAT division. He provides indiscriminate advice and opinions to those under him, as well as observations. Although he cannot do a thing to help Armitage and Ross through official channels, he does give them a well- deserved pep talk–signing off surrounded by all of their comrades within the squad. ; : :Mardini is the vice president of an Earth Robotics Corporation and an admirer of Dr. Asakura's work. The antagonist of Dual-Matrix, he attempts to recreate his idol's work on Thirds, but his clones are unable to give birth to humans. Due to the declining birth rate on Mars, Demetrio plans to create human labor forces that never complain, soldiers who aren't afraid of dying, and increase the human population. He finds out that the original Armitage is still alive and tries to capture her to learn her reproduction secrets. He also attempts to blackmail Ross into not voting for the Robotic Rights Bill by holding Yoko hostage. He is subsequently killed by his own clones (controlled by Julian), when Armitage and her family make their escape. =Other characters= ; : :Ross's wisecracking colleague in the Martian Police Department.

As far as Demetrio can tell, she is pure human. ; : :A third who assists Armitage's repairs. ; :O'Hara is the chairman of the Mars Foundation. He sends Ross, under the alias of Kevin Oldman, to Earth to vote in favor of the Robotic Rights Bill, promising amnesty for his and Armitage's previous crime. He strongly believes that giving robots' rights will be beneficial to the future of humanity. Production and release In the text notes on the English DVD edition of Poly-Matrix, Chiaki Konaka, the script writer, says that Armitage III was influenced by H.P. Lovecraft's story The Dunwich Horror, one of Lovecraft's best known works and a key text in the Cthulhu Mythos; one of the main characters in the tale is a Dr. Armitage. Armitage III was originally released as a four-episode original video animation (OVA) in Japan between February 25, 1995, and November 25, 1995. Pioneer USA released an English-dubbed version of the OVA series in VHS & LaserDisc format in North America in four volumes, each containing a single episode, between March 29, 1995, and December 5, 1995. The Region 1 DVD from Geneon of Poly-Matrix was one of the few releases from the company to feature THX-certified audio and video, and it was digitally remixed and remastered for superior picture quality and optimum audio presentation. Reception Helen McCarthy in 500 Essential Anime Movies claims that the image quality of Armitage III: Poly- Matrix \\"isn't up to big screen standards, though it still holds well on home screens\\". She praises the design and scripts, while saying that the \\"basic plot is simply a retelling of Pinocchio - the toy that wants to be real, or, in science fiction terms, the robot yearning for love and acceptance as a person, not just a product\\".McCarthy, Helen. 500 Essential Anime Movies: The Ultimate Guide. — Harper Design, 2009. — P. 14. — 528 p. — References Further reading  * * External links  Category:1995 anime OVAs Category:1997 anime films Category:2002 anime films Category:Action anime and manga Category:Anime International Company Category:Cyberpunk anime and manga Category:Cyborg films Category:Fictional gynoids Category:Fictional Martians Category:Funimation Category:Geneon USA Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese-language films Category:Mars in fiction Category:NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan Category:Shōnen manga Category:Tokuma Shoten manga ","title":"Armitage III"},{"id":"2344157","text":"The Committee on Regional Development (REGI) is a committee of the European Parliament.

The Energy Technology Engineering Center site is in the flat Area IV at the lower left, with the Rocket Test Field Laboratory sites in the hills at the center. (Spring 2005) The Santa Susana Field Laboratory is a complex of industrial research and development facilities located on a portion of the Southern California Simi Hills in Simi Valley, California. It was used mainly for the development and testing of liquid-propellant rocket engines for the United States space program from 1949 to 2006, nuclear reactors from 1953 to 1980 and the operation of a U.S. government-sponsored liquid metals research center from 1966 to 1998. The site is located approximately northwest from the community of Canoga Park and approximately northwest of Downtown Los Angeles. Sage Ranch Park is adjacent on part of the northern boundary and the community of Bell Canyon along the entire southern boundary. Throughout the years, about ten low-power nuclear reactors operated at SSFL, in addition to several \\"critical facilities\\" that helped develop nuclear science and applications. At least four of the ten nuclear reactors had accidents during their operation. The reactors located on the grounds of SSFL were considered experimental, and therefore had no containment structures. The site ceased research and development operations in 2006. The years of rocket testing, nuclear reactor testing, and liquid metal research have left the site \\"significantly contaminated\\". Environmental cleanup is ongoing. The public who live near the site have over the years strongly urged a thorough cleanup of the site, citing cases of long term illnesses, including cancer cases at rates they claim are higher than normal. On March 30, 2018, a 7-year-old girl living in Simi Valley died of neuroblastoma, prompting public urging to thoroughly clean up the site; despite the fact that there is insufficient evidence to identify an explicit link between cancer rates and radioactive contamination in the area. Introduction Santa Susana Field Laboratory administrative areas, and the surrounding communities Since 1947 the Santa Susana Field Laboratory location has been used by a number of companies and agencies. The first was Rocketdyne, originally a division of North American Aviation-NAA, which developed a variety of pioneering, successful, and reliable liquid rocket engines. Some were those used in the Navaho cruise missile, the Redstone rocket, the Thor and Jupiter ballistic missiles, early versions of the Delta and Atlas rockets, the Saturn rocket family, and the Space Shuttle Main Engine. The Atomics International division of North American Aviation used a separate and dedicated portion of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory to build and operate the first commercial nuclear power plant in the United States, as well as for the testing and development of compact nuclear reactors, including the first and only known nuclear reactor launched into Low Earth Orbit by the United States, the SNAP-10A. Atomics International also operated the Energy Technology Engineering Center for the U.S. Department of Energy at the site. The Santa Susana Field Laboratory includes sites identified as historic by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and by the American Nuclear Society. In 1996, The Boeing Company became the primary owner and operator of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory and later closed the site. Three California state agencies and three federal agencies have been overseeing a detailed investigation of environmental impacts from historical site operations since at least 1990. Concerns about the environmental impact of past disposal practices have inspired at least two lawsuits seeking payment from Boeing and several interest groups are actively involved with steering the ongoing environmental investigation. The Santa Susana Field Laboratory is the focus of diverse interests. Burro Flats Painted Cave, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is located within the Santa Susana Field Laboratory boundaries, on a portion of the site owned by the U.S. government. The drawings within the cave have been termed \\"the best preserved Indian pictograph in Southern California.\\" Several tributary streams to the Los Angeles River have headwater watersheds on the SSFL property, including Bell Creek (90% of SSFL drainage), Dayton Creek, Woolsey Canyon, and Runkle Creek. History Aerial view looking north, of the Energy Technology Engineering Center in Area IV (1990).SSFL was slated as a United States government facility dedicated to the development and testing of nuclear reactors, powerful rockets such as the Delta II, and the systems that powered the Apollo missions. The location of SSFL was chosen in 1947 for its remoteness in order to conduct work that was considered too dangerous and too noisy to be performed in more densely populated areas. In subsequent years, however, the Southern California population grew, along with housing developments surrounding \\"The Hill\\". Today, more than 150,000 people live within of the facility, and at least half a million people live within . The site is divided into four production and two buffer areas, (Area I, II, III, and IV, and the northern and southern buffer zones). Areas I through III were used for rocket testing, missile testing, and munitions development. Area IV was used primarily for nuclear reactor experimentation and development. Laser research for the Strategic Defense Initiative (popularly known as \\"Star Wars\\"), also was conducted in Area IV. The 2018 Woolsey Fire began at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory site. =Rocket engine development= North American Aviation (NAA) began its development of liquid propellant rocket engines after the end of WWII. The Rocketdyne division of NAA, which came into being under its own name in the mid-1950s, designed and tested several rocket engines at the facility. They included engines for the Army's Redstone (an advanced short- range version of the German V-2), and the Army Jupiter intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) as well as the Air Force's counterpart IRBM, the Thor. Also included among those developed there, were engines for the Atlas Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM), as well as the twin combustion chamber alcohol/liquid oxygen booster engine for the Navaho, a large, intercontinental cruise missile that never became operational. Later, Rocketdyne designed and tested the J-2 liquid oxygen/hydrogen engine which was used on the second and third stages of the Project Apollo spacecraft. While the J-2 was tested at the facility, Rocketdyne's huge F-1 engine for the first stage of Apollo was tested in the Mojave desert near Edwards Air Force Base. This was due to safety and noise considerations, since SSFL was too close to populated areas. =Nuclear and energy research and development= SSFL: the Atomics International Snap reactorThe Atomics International Division of North American Aviation used SSFL Area IV as the site of United States first commercial nuclear power plant and the testing and development of the SNAP-10A, the first nuclear reactor launched into outer space by the United States. Atomics International also operated the Energy Technology Engineering Center at the site for the U.S. government. As overall interest in nuclear power declined, Atomics International made a transition to non-nuclear energy- related projects, such as coal gasification, and gradually, ceased designing and testing nuclear reactors. Atomics International eventually was merged with the Rocketdyne division in 1978. Sodium reactor experiment The Sodium Reactor Experiment-SRE was an experimental nuclear reactor that operated at the site from 1957 to 1964 and was the first commercial power plant in the world to experience a core meltdown. There was a decades-long cover-up of the incident by the U.S. Department of Energy. The operation predated environmental regulation, so early disposal techniques are not recorded in detail. Thousands of pounds of sodium coolant from the time of the meltdown are not yet accounted for. (see sections 2.1.7.4, 2.2.3, 4.4.2 and 9.3 for discrepancies concerning sodium amounts) The reactor and support systems were removed in 1981 and the building torn down in 1999. The 1959 sodium reactor incident was chronicled on History Channel's program Engineering Disasters 19. Energy Technology Engineering Center The Energy Technology Engineering Center-ETEC, was a government-owned, contractor-operated complex of industrial facilities located within Area IV of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory. The ETEC specialized in non-nuclear testing of components which were designed to transfer heat from a nuclear reactor using liquid metals instead of water or gas. The center operated from 1966 to 1998. The ETEC site has been closed and is now undergoing building removal and environmental remediation by the U.S. Department of Energy. Accidents and site contamination =Nuclear reactors= Throughout the years, approximately ten low-power nuclear reactors operated at SSFL, in addition to several \\"critical facilities\\": a sodium burn pit in which sodium-coated objects were burned in an open pit; a plutonium fuel fabrication facility; a uranium carbide fuel fabrication facility; and the purportedly largest \\"Hot Lab\\" facility in the United States at the time. (A hot lab is a facility used for remotely handling or machining radioactive material.) Irradiated nuclear fuel from other Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and Department of Energy (DOE) facilities from around the country was shipped to SSFL to be decladded and examined. The hot lab suffered a number of fires involving radioactive materials. For example, in 1957, a fire in the hot cell \\"got out of control and ... massive contamination\\" resulted.NAA-SR-1941, Sodium Graphite Reactor, Quarterly Progress Report, January–March 1957, p. 27 At least four of the ten nuclear reactors suffered accidents: 1) The AE6 reactor experienced a release of fission gases in March 1959. 2) In July 1959, the SRE experienced a power excursion and partial meltdown that released 28 Curies of radioactive noble gasses. The release resulted on the maximum off- site exposure of 0.099 millirem and an exposure of 0.018 millirem for the nearest residential building which is well within current limits today. 3) In 1964, the SNAP8ER experienced damage to 80% of its fuel. 4) In 1969 the SNAP8DR experienced similar damage to one-third of its fuel. A radioactive fire occurred in 1971, involving combustible primary reactor coolant (NaK) contaminated with mixed fission products.Rockwell International, Nuclear Operations at Rockwell's Santa Susana Field Laboratory – A Factual Perspective, September 6, 1991 The reactors located on the grounds of SSFL were considered experimental, and therefore had no containment structures. Reactors and highly radioactive components were housed without the large concrete domes that surround modern power reactors. =Sodium burn pits= Toxic substances burn and are released into the air. The sodium burn pit, an open-air pit for cleaning sodium-contaminated components, was also contaminated by the burning of radioactively and chemically contaminated items in it, in contravention of safety requirements. In an article in the Ventura County Star, James Palmer, a former SSFL worker was interviewed. The article notes that \\"of the 27 men on Palmer's crew, 22 died of cancers.\\" On some nights Palmer returned home from work and kissed \\"his wife [hello], only to burn her lips with the chemicals he had breathed at work.\\" The report also noted that \\"During their breaks, Palmer's crew would fish in one of three ponds ... The men would use a solution that was 90 percent hydrogen peroxide to neutralize the contamination. Sometimes, the water was so polluted it bubbled. The fish died off.\\" Palmer's interview ended on a somber note: \\"They had seven wells up there, water wells, and every damn one of them was contaminated,\\" Palmer said, \\"It was a horror story.\\"”The Cancer Effect”, October 30, 2006, Ventura County Star Other spills and releases occurred over the decades of operation as well. In 1989, a DOE investigation found widespread chemical and radioactive contamination on the property. Widely publicized in the local press, the revelations led to substantial concern among community members and elected officials, resulting in a challenge to and subsequent shutdown of continued nuclear activity at the site, and the filing of lawsuits. Cleanup commenced, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was brought in at the request of local legislators to provide oversight. A worker disposes of toxic chemicals by blowing up full barrels with a rifle shot (the reaction to the shot caused an explosion). On December 11, 2002, a Department of Energy (DOE) official, Mike Lopez, described typical clean-up procedures executed by Field Lab employees in the past. Workers would dispose of barrels filled with highly toxic waste by shooting the barrels with rifles so that they would explode and release their contents into the air. It is unclear when this process ended, but for certain did end prior to the 1990s.\\"Rocketdyne, it's the pits\\", Ventura County Reporter, December 12, 2002; also see SB990, a bill before the California legislature relating this procedure On July 26, 1994, two scientists, Otto K. Heiney and Larry A. Pugh were killed when the chemicals they were illegally burning in open pits exploded. After a grand jury investigation and FBI raid on the facility, three Rocketdyne officials pleaded guilty in June 2004 to illegally storing explosive materials. The jury deadlocked on the more serious charges related to illegal burning of hazardous waste. At trial, a retired Rocketdyne mechanic testified as to what he witnessed at the time of the explosion: \\"I assumed we were burning waste,\\" Lee Wells testified, comparing the process used on July 21 and 26, 1994, to that once used to legally dispose of leftover chemicals at the company's old burn pit. As Heiney poured the chemicals for what would have been the third burn of the day, the blast occurred, Wells said. \\"[The background noise] was so loud I didn't hear anything ... I felt the blast and I looked down and my shirt was coming apart.\\" When he realized what had occurred, Wells said, \\"I felt to see if I was all there ... I knew I was burned but I didn't know how bad.\\" Wells suffered second- and third-degree burns to his face, arms and stomach. =Wildfires and contamination= In 2005, wildfires swept through northern Los Angeles County and parts of Ventura County. The fires consumed most of the dry brush throughout the Simi Hills where SSFL is located. The facility received substantial damage. Since the fire, allegations have emerged that vast quantities of on-site contamination were released into the air. Most recently, Los Angeles County firefighters who were assigned to SSFL during the fire have been sent for medical testing to see if any harmful doses were ingested or inhaled while protecting the facility. While community members and firefighters have expressed concern about the amount of exposure, Boeing officials stand by their position that no contamination of the air resulted from the fire, and that any contamination that may have been consumed by the fire was negligible. California Department of Toxic Substances Control also says no significant contamination occurred as a result of the fire. Although the Field Lab is under current criticism for violating almost 50 discharge permits, state agencies have been silent on the issue. Recently, lawyers disclosed to the California State Water Resources Control Board that over 80 exceedances of Boeing's discharge permits were found in the preceding year alone. In January 2006, the State Water Resources Control Board finally stepped in, and refused some requests by Boeing for even lighter standards. On November 8, 2018, the Woolsey wildfire scorched portions of the SSFL, causing the Southern California Edison's Chatsworth electrical substation to trip offline at 2:22 pm. However, the Woolsey Fire is reported to have begun at 3:30 pm on November 8, 2018, at Rocketdyne in Simi Valley. Although the Los Angeles County Public Health stated that no contamination was spread and that the California Department of Toxic Substances Control, which is overseeing cleanup of the site, also said that \\"previously handled radioactive and hazardous materials were not affected by the fire,\\" Dr. Bob Dodge, President of Physicians for Social Responsibility-Los Angeles, said, “The Woolsey Fire likely released and spread radiological and chemical contamination that was in SSFL’s soil and vegetation via smoke and ash. All wildfire smoke can be hazardous to health, but if SSFL had been cleaned up long ago as DTSC promised, we’d at least not have to worry about exposure to dangerous radionuclides and chemicals as well.” He added, \\"When it burns and becomes airborne in smoke and ash, there is real possibility of heightened exposure for area residents.\\" =Medical claims= Also in October 2005, plaintiff Margaret-Ann Galasso, in a suit against Boeing, criticized her attorneys, whom she claimed accepted a $30 million settlement with Boeing without her approval. The attorneys stand to collect $18 million, or 60% of the settlement amount after their costs and fees are subtracted. The plaintiff who disclosed the allegedly tainted deal, is splitting the rest of the settlement with other plaintiffs and will only receive around $30,000, insufficient for the amount she would need for extensive future medical treatments for diseases that were linked to contamination from the SSFL facility. In October 2006, the Santa Susana Field Laboratory Advisory Panel, made up of independent scientists and researchers from around the United States, concluded that based on available data and computer models, contamination at the facility resulted in an estimated 260 cancer related deaths. The report also concluded that the SRE meltdown caused the release of more than 458 times the amount of radioactivity released by the Three Mile Island accident. While the nuclear core of the SRE released 10 times less radiation than the TMI incident, the lack of proper containment such as concrete structures caused this radiation to be released into the surrounding environment. The radiation released by the core of the TMI was largely contained. According to studies conducted by Hal Morgenstern between 1988 and 2002, residents living within 2 miles of the laboratory are 60% more likely to be diagnosed with certain cancers compared to residents living 5 miles from the laboratory. This 2-mile region includes small sections of far southeastern Simi Valley and most of Bell Canyon. Part of Chatsworth and Canoga Park, as well as most of West Hills and Simi Valley are within 5 miles of the laboratory. Cleanup During its years of operation widespread use of highly toxic chemical additives occurred, in order to power over 30,000 rocket engine tests and to clean the rocket test-stands afterwards. As well as considerable nuclear research and at least four nuclear accidents, which has resulted in the SSFL becoming a seriously contaminated site and an offsite pollution source, requiring a sophisticated multi-agency Cleanup Project. An ongoing process to determine the site contamination levels and locations, cleanup standards to meet, methods to use, costs, timelines and completion requirements – are still being debated, and litigated. =Standards history= In 1989, the DOE found widespread chemical and radioactive contamination at their site, and a cleanup program commenced. In 1995 EPA and DOE announced that they had entered into a joint policy agreement to assure that all DOE sites would be cleaned up to standards consistent with the EPA's Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) standards. However, in March 2003, the DOE reversed its position and announced that SSFL would not be cleaned up to EPA standards. While the DOE simultaneously claimed compliance with the 1995 joint policy agreement, the new plan included a cleanup of only 1% of the contaminated soil, and the release of SSFL for unrestricted residential use in as little as ten years. The EPA responded to this announcement by claiming that the DOE was not subject to EPA regulation due to the fact that the DOE existed as a separate entity under the executive branch of the federal government, and refused to take steps to force DOE adherence to the 1995 agreement. In August 2003, the Senate Appropriations Committee issued a report on Energy and Water Appropriations, urging the DOE to meet its commitments in the 1995 agreement and clean up SSFL to the EPA's CERCLA standards. The DOE responded to the Senate, claiming it was in fact consistent with both the agreement and EPA's CERCLA standards. In December 2003, soon after DOE's announcement that it was consistent with the 1995 agreement, EPA determined that the cleanup was not consistent with its CERCLA standards, and that sufficient contamination would remain at levels that would be dangerously inappropriate for unrestricted residential, and that the only safe use under DOE's revised cleanup standards would be restricted day hikes with limitations on picnicking. Critics point out that if the DOE-Boeing cleanup plan was followed through and the site was released for unrestricted residential use, the property would likely become a Superfund site subject to EPA standards. After the sale, the site would no longer be a DOE facility, and thus, the exemption from CERCLA standards would no longer be in effect. The end result being that the site would only be brought into compliance with CERCLA cleanup standards after Boeing has sold the property, relieving the company of any burden of cleanup costs. The costs would likely be passed on to taxpayers, and not those responsible for the actual contamination. In early May 2007, a Federal Court in San Francisco issued a major ruling which concluded that DOE has not been cleaning up the site to proper standards, and that the site would have to be cleaned up to higher standards if DOE ever wanted to release the site to Boeing, which in turn, would most likely release the land for unrestricted residential development. Judge \\"Conti's ruling requires DOE to prepare a more stringent review of the lab, which is on the border of Los Angeles County. Conti wrote that the department's decision to prepare a less-stringent environmental document prior to cleanup is in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act and noted that the lab 'is located only miles away from one of the largest population centers in the world.'\\" Runoff issues On July 26, 2007, staff at the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board recommended a $471,190 fine against Boeing for 79 violations of the California Water Code during an 18-month period. From October 2004 to January 2006, wastewater and storm water runoff coming from the lab had increased levels of chromium, dioxin, lead, mercury and other pollutants, the board said. The contaminated water flowed into Bell Creek and the Los Angeles River in violation of a July 1, 2004, permit that allowed release of wastewater and storm water runoff as long as it didn't contain high levels of pollutants. Parkland In October 2007, Boeing announced that \\"In a landmark agreement between Boeing and California officials, nearly of land that is currently Boeing's Santa Susana Field Laboratory will become state parkland. According to the plan jointly announced by California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Boeing, and state Sen. Sheila Kuehl, the property will be donated and preserved as a vital undeveloped open-space link in the Simi Hills, above the Simi Valley and the San Fernando Valley. The agreement will permanently restrict the land for nonresidential, noncommercial use.\\" =Cleanup developments 2007–present= SB 990 The California state senate bill SB 990, passed into law in 2007, set the standards for the site's cleanup. To achieve them, the R.P.s (responsible parties) consisting of Boeing, DOE, and NASA, need to sign agreements of acceptance and cleanup compliance. Boeing Boeing has contested the law, filing a lawsuit in September 2009 to release it from compliance, with a court date set for summer 2011. Boeing won the suit and claims it will clean up the site, although to levels far below those outlined in SB 990.Healy, Patrick and Lloyd, Jonathan (April 29, 2011) \\"Judge Sides With Boeing in Rocket Site Cleanup\\" NBC Southern California DOE and NASA In September 2010 DOE and NASA agreed to meet the stringent cleanup standards set for the site in the state's SB 990 legislation, and to cover all costs for their cleanup's implementation. This agreement is significant progress in the SSFL cleanup sequence. In 2014, NASA issued a final environmental impact statement containing mitigation measures that would demolish all structures and remediate soil and groundwater contamination. NASA issued a 2014 report highlighting cleanup technology feasibility studies, soil and groundwater fieldwork, and additional archaeology surveys that would be performed in preparation for the demolition of the structures. NASA determined that substantially more soil needed to be removed from its part of the site than what it estimated in the 2014 report so a supplemental report was prepared in 2019. Demolition of abandoned buildings on the site was scheduled to start in early 2015 after abatement of asbestos, lead paint and other regulated materials. The test stands would follow and are the most complex to tear down but all demolition were to be completed in 2016. Because of their historical significance, one test stand and one control building will remain if the cleanup goals can still be met. The cleanup was projected to be completed in 2017. In 2019, the U.S. Department of Energy announced that it has decided to demolish and remove 13 of 18 remaining structures. In 2020, an agreement was reached to demolish 10 of the most highly contaminated structures. =Community involvement= PPG – Public Participation Group The CA-DTSC: SSFL Project, the lead regulatory agency for the site cleanup, is forming a new [Sept. 2010] PPG – Public Participation Group, in response to their community 'Listening Sessions' held earlier in the year and the proposed Listening Session Response Plan. Applications from all the 'stakeholder' I.P.s – interested parties: the public, community groups, neighbors, local environmental and cultural groups, and others are being accepted currently [Sept. 2010]. SSFL Workgroup Every quarter, the SSFL Workgroup holds meetings regarding the cleanup and are open for public attendance. The SSFL Workgroup is the current version of the Santa Susana Advisory Panel. The workgroup consists of representatives from the California Department of Toxic Substances Control, the U.S. EPA, public policy organizations, and community representatives. The Boeing Company, current owner of the SSFL site, and the DOE are also invited. Other organizations and private companies also attend as part of the workgroup depending on the topic pending. The meetings are usually held at The Simi Valley Cultural Arts Center, and are posted on the DTSC-SSFL Calendar page of their website. Community advisory group A petition to form a \\"CAG\\" or community advisory group was denied in March 2010 by DTSC.http://cleanuprocketdyne.org/cleanuprocketdyne.org/Community_Advisory_Group/Community_Advisory_Group.html. accessed 8/30/2010 In 2012, the current CAG's petition was approved, and their website is at ssflcag.net. The SSFL CAG recommends that all responsible parties execute a risk-based cleanup to EPA's suburban residential standard that will minimize excavation, soil removal and backfill and thus reduce danger to public health and functions of surrounding communities. However, SSFL Panel believes the CAG has a conflict of interest, as it is funded in large part by a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy, and three of its members are former employees of Boeing or its parent company, North American Aviation. The CAG tried to keep the source of its funding, over $34,000, anonymous. Physicians for Social Responsibility The Los Angeles chapter of the Physicians for Social Responsibility has been working with the SSFL Work Group and Rocketdyne Cleanup Coalition. PSR expressed concern over conflict of interest involving Boeing, CAG, DTSC and others related to the cleanup that were revealed in a 55-page report, Inside Job – How Boeing Fixers Captured Regulators and Derailed a Nuclear and Chemical Cleanup in LA's Backyard, published in 2014 by Consumer Watchdog.

It is the naval equivalent of Marshal of France and was one of the Great Officers of the Crown of France. History The title was created in 1270 by Louis IX of France, during the Eighth Crusade. At the time, it was equivalent to the office of Constable of France. The Admiral was responsible for defending the coasts of Picardy, Normandy, Aunis, and Saintonge. In times of war, it was his responsibility to assemble French merchant ships into a navy. He had to arm, equip, and supply the ships for the course of the war, and give letters of marque to corsairs. In peacetime, he was responsible for the maintenance of the royal fleet (when one existed). He was also responsible for maritime commerce and the merchant fleet. During the modern era, few admirals were sailors — moreover, with the exception of Claude d'Annebault, none of them actually commanded the fleet. It must be said that the actual power of the admiral was rather small, partly because of the creation of other admirals (the Admiral of the Levant for Provence, the Admiral of Brittany, and the Admiral of the West for Guyenne), and because of the creation of the General of the Galleys and the Secretary of State for the Navy. The title, like the title of Constable, had much more political importance (which would eventually lead to the suppression of both titles). It was also a lucrative position: the admiral was allocated a part of the fines and confiscations imposed by the admiralty, and he had a right to unclaimed ships and shipwrecks as well as a tenth of the spoils taken in battle. He also had juridical rights, comparable to those exercised by the constable and the marshal. This was known as the Table de marbre, after the seat of the admiralty in Paris. A second headquarters of the admiralty was established at Rouen, and about 50 other headquarters were set up at various other places around the coast of France. These tribunals judged cases dealing with fishing disputes and any crimes committed in the country's ports. The Admiralty was suppressed in 1627 by Cardinal Richelieu, who had been named to the newly created post of Grand Master of Navigation and who wanted to bring all naval authority under one position. The position was recreated in 1669, but was now only an honorific title. The first new admiral was Louis, Count of Vermandois, who at the time was only 2 years old. Thereafter, only Louis Alexandre, Count of Toulouse involved himself in maritime affairs. It was suppressed once more in 1791, restored in 1805 in the person of Marshal of France Joachim Murat. Currently, the most recent Admiral of France was François Thomas Tréhouart, in 1869. This dignity remains fully valid today as a 2005 law article recalls: \\"The title of Marshal of France and that of Admiral of France, is a dignity in the state.\\"Article 19 of Law No. 2005-270 of 24 March 2005 on the general status of militaries Admirals * Florent de Varennes 1270 - First admiral of France * Aubert II de Longueval, dead in naval combat in 1283 along the coasts of the Crown of Aragon * Othon de Torcy : 1296-1297 * Mathieu IV of Montmorency : 1297-1304 * Rainier I of Monaco, Lord of Cagnes 1304-1314 * Hugues Quiéret 1335-1340Ernest Prarond Histoire de cinq villes et de trois cents villages, hameaux et fermes, T.2, p.272, 1863 * Nicolas Béhuchet, 1338-1340 * Antonio Aithone Doria, 1339Froissart's Chronicles, T.2, 1824, p.29 * Robert de Houdetot, 1340 * Luis de la Cerda, prince of Fortunate Isles, 1341 * Charles I, Lord of Monaco, 1342 * Pierre Flotte de Revel, March 28, 1345-1347Anselme de Sainte-Marie, Histoire généalogique de la maison royale de la France et des grands officiers de la couronne, p.752 * Jean de Nanteuil 1347-1356 * vacancy in the office 1356-1359 * Enguerran de Mentenay 1359 * Jean « Baudran » de la Heuse : 1359-1368 * François de Perilleux 1368-1369 * Aymeri VI, Viscount of Narbonne 1369-1373 * Jean de Vienne 1373-1396 * Renaud de Trie, lord of Sérifontaine 1397-1405 * Pierre de Bréban, called Clignet 1405-1408 * Jacques de Châtillon, lord of Dampierre 1408-1415 * Robert de Bracquemont called Robinet : 1417-1418 * Jeannet de Poix : 1418 * Charles de Recourt, viscount of Beauvoir : 1418-1419 * Georges de Beauvoir de Chastellux : 1420 * Louis de Culant 1421-1437 * André de Laval-Montmorency, seigneur de Lohéac and baron de Retz 1437–1439 * Prégent VII de Coëtivy 1439-1450 * Jean V de Bueil de Montrésor 1450-1477 * Jean de Montauban : 8 of October, 1461-1466Musée national de Versailles Galeries historiques du Palais de Versailles, book 7, p. 102, Imprimerie royale, 1842 * Louis de Bourbon, comte de Roussillon, bastard son of Charles I, Duke of Bourbon 1466-1486 * Charles II d'Amboise 1508-1511 * Louis Malet de Graville 1511-1516 * Guillaume Gouffier, seigneur de Bonnivet 1517-1525 * Philippe de Chabot seigneur de Brion (called Amiral de Brion), comte de Charni 1525–1543 * Claude d'Annebault 1543-1552 * Gaspard de Coligny, seigneur de Châtillon-sur-Loing 1552-1572 * Honorat II de Savoye, marquis de Villars 1572-1578 * Charles de Guise, duc de Mayenne 1578-1582 * Anne de Joyeuse 1582-1587 * Jean Louis de Nogaret de La Valette, duc d'Épernon 1587-1589 * Antoine de Brichanteau, marquis de Nangis 1589-1590 * Bernard de Nogaret de la Valette 1589-1592 * Charles de Gontaut, duc de Biron 1592-1594 * André de Brancas, marquis de Villars 1594-1595 * Charles de Montmorency-Damville, duc de Damville : 1596-1612 * Henri II de Montmorency 1612-1626 _Period of grand masters of navigation :_ * Cardinal Richelieu 1626-1642 * Jean Armand de Maillé-Brézé 1642-1646 * Anne of Austria 1646-1650 * César, Duke of Vendôme 1651-1665 _Restoration of title Admiral of France_ * Louis, Count of Vermandois 1669-1683 * Louis Alexandre, Count of Toulouse 1683-1737 * Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon, Duke of Penthièvre 1737-1789 * Charles Hector d'Estaing : 1792 * Joachim Murat 1805-1814 * Louis-Antoine d’Artois, Duke of Angoulême : 1814-1830 * Guy-Victor Duperré : 1830 * Laurent Truguet 1831 * Albin Roussin 1840-1847 * Ange René Armand 1847-1854Ernest Lehr, L'Alsace noble: suivie de Le livre d'or du patriciat de Strasbourg, Volumes 1 to 3, p.336 * Charles Baudin 1854 * Ferdinand-Alphonse Hamelin 1854 * Alexandre Ferdinand Parseval-Deschenes December 2, 1854 * Armand Joseph Bruat 1855 * Joseph Romain-Desfossés 1860 * Charles Rigault de Genouilly 1864 * Léonard Charner 1864 * François Thomas Tréhouart 1869 = English admirals = Henry VI of England appointed two English aristocrats during the ministrations of Louis de Culant and André de Laval-Montmorency.

The municipality was founded in 1530 and today comprises 70 villages, over 300 hamlets, and around 100,000 inhabitants. It is North-East of Tegucigalpa, the country's capital. Olanchito is in the Central Time Zone, with a UTC offset of -6 hours. The city is the birthplace of many exponents of Honduran literature, such as Ramón Amaya Amador. Olanchito has his manuscripts, his collection of books, the table at which he wrote, and even his ashes. Known locally as the Civic City, Olanchito's main industry is based around agriculture. History The conquest of Honduras began with the arrival of several expeditions sent by Hernán Cortés to extend the domain of Spain in Central America. In 1525 he seized the town of Trujillo, which would become an important Atlantic port and the first capital of Honduras. Truxillo served as an outpost for the colonisation of the hostile territory of Olancho Valley. Hernando de Saavedra, Governor of Honduras, had a dispute with his counterpart in Nicaragua, Pedrarias Davila, on the rich gold deposits and rivers of Olancho. After several battles between rival groups of Spanish for control of the area, the town of San Jorge de Olancho was established. But because of the mistreatment of the natives of Olancho, they unexpectedly rebelled and attacked the place, destroying it completely. In this rebellion, Captain Juan de Grijalva, one of the conquerors of the Aztec empire, was killed. The survivors were scattered, some to the town of Border of Caceres, in 1526, and others to the Valley of Aguan. With the death of Diego de Salcedo, Governor of Honduras in 1530, the province was in chaos. But the important issue of extending the settlement and continuing the conquest of people who were not yet subjugated continued. Stories differ as to who founded the settlement that became Olanchito and are somewhat confusing. According to the statistical yearbook of Antonio Vallejo, this town was founded by Captain Diego de Alvarado in 1530, with the name of San Jorge de Olanchito.\\"José Milla and Vidaurre. History of Central America continued by Gomez Carrillo, Chapter XI, p, 228, Vol I, 1879–1905 Guatemala The Guatemalan historian José Mata Gavidia explains: \\"With these and other graces came to Guatemala D. Pedro de Alvarado, for the year April 30. bringing people of Mexico, and some that found here in Nicaragua, Diego de Alvarado sent brother Jorge to found the city, called Olanchito, in the province of Honduras.\\"Jose Mata Gavidia (1969) p, 136. Guatemala No. 189 C: A: It follows that the town of San Jorge de Olanchito was founded in 1530, located on the right bank of the Aguán river. Its first inhabitants were the few survivors of San Jorge de Olancho and others sent by Pedro de Alvarado, becoming a stage of El Camino Real, which led from Truxillo to Olancho. Ten years later (1540) the Governor Francisco de Montejo, was ordered to continue the colonisation of Olancho and sent his officer Alonzo Caceres, who established a settlement with the same last name: \\"San Jorge de Olancho\\" (The Viejo). Years later Alonzo de Reinoso founded the village of \\"New Salamanca\\", which was rapidly depopulated due to continuing native rebellions. Olancho as a mining town was flourishing, producing huge amounts of gold and silver that were shipped from the port of Truxillo and Puerto Caballos. San Jorge de Olancho later became known as El Boqueron, and in 1611 was completely destroyed. Historians attribute it to a volcanic eruption, or an earthquake, and some legends to divine causes, such as Biblical case of Sodom and Gomorrah. The survivors of this catastrophe, migrated in several directions as their ancestors had done a century earlier. Some founded the city of Juticalpa and others headed to San Jorge de Olanchito and Truxillo. Over the years, some people moved to the left bank of Aguán river, and on the route leading to the native village of Agalteca, established a place they called \\"San Jorge de Olancho\\" (The New). With the move all of the residents of the town to the new place, it took its name \\"San Jorge de Olanchito\\", and the old site was known then as \\"Old City\\" or \\"San Juan El Sevillano\\". It is unknown the exact date of the foundation of the present city of Olanchito but this may have occurred between 1613–1620. The settlers were colonising the upper valley, and the road leading to Yoro, sites were established \\"Santa Barbara\\" in 1657, by Captain Pedro de Aliendo and Subiñas and \\"Santa Cruz\\" in 1682 by Don John of the Cross.\\"New Lands File Index\\" National Printing 2nd edition 1901.

Economic development Today the city of Olanchito is the most important city in the department of Yoro thanks to its growing achievements in education, industry, livestock, and agriculture. The economic development of the city was influenced by the presence of the Standard Fruit Company, an American company which settled in the Aguan Valley in 1899.

It is the most widely read newspaper in Lincoln and has the second- largest circulation in Nebraska (after the Omaha World-Herald). The paper also operates a commercial printing unit. History The Lincoln Journal Star is the result of a 1995 merger between the city's two historic newspapers. The Lincoln Star, established in 1905, was Lincoln's morning newspaper while the Lincoln Journal was distributed in the evenings. The Journal was itself the conglomeration of several previous Lincoln newspapers. = The Lincoln Journal = In September 7, 1867, Charles Henry Gere founded the Nebraska Commonwealth. A member of the prominent Gere family, Gere was a New York native and Civil War veteran. As an attorney who had studied law in Baltimore, Gere quickly became an important figure in Nebraska, serving as the private secretary of the state's first governor. Gere spearheaded numerous local issues, specifically favoring the idea that all state government functions should be housed in one city as opposed to scattering them across the state. As such, Gere became an important voice in the nascent state capital, Lincoln, and the Nebraska Commonwealth became its first newspaper. In 1869, Gere changed the name of the publication to the Nebraska State Journal. The following year, the newspaper became a daily. As his publication grew, Gere retired from law to become an active part of his newspaper. Having served in the first governor's administration, the state constitutional convention, the state senate, the education commission, the committee on railroads, and the University of Nebraska Board of Regents, Gere's long history of involvement in local politics and strongly-held views impacted the editorial tone of the paper. In one editorial in 1890, Gere famously likened the Farmer's Alliance and its candidates to \\"a herd of hogs,\\" criticizing the party for disrupting Republican party politics in the state. In 1897, J.C. Seacrest, a former reporter for the Nebraska State Journal, purchased the Lincoln Evening News which was published by the State Journal as an evening edition. By 1922, Seacrest had changed the name of the Lincoln Evening News to the Lincoln Evening Journal and become the majority owner of the State Journal Company. Seacrest merged the two publications to create to create the Lincoln Evening Journal & Nebraska State Journal. James C. Olson and Ronald C. Naugle, History of Nebraska. Third Edition. Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, (p. 376). = The Lincoln Star = In 1902, Lincoln utilities tycoon and millionaire D.E. Thompson established the Lincoln Daily Star. In 1910, Thompson sold the Daily Star to local grain operator Herbert E. Gooch. The Great Depression caused Gooch to sell the publication to the Lee Group of Davenport, Iowa, now Lee Enterprises, for one million dollars in 1930. As the Depression wore on, financial circumstances forced the Seacrests and Lee Group to buy minority interest in each other's companies in 1931 to stay afloat. However, the two publications remained independent and controlled their own content. = Merger = The two papers had been minority interest holders in each other's companies since 1931. In 1937, J.C. Seacrest created a trust which ensured that the Journal would remain in the possession of the Seacrest family throughout the lifetimes of his sons, Joe W. and Fred S. Seacrest, and their children. However, financial realities forced greater cooperation between the Journal and Star and in 1950, the State Journal Printing Company and Star Printing Company merged into the Journal-Star Printing Company. Despite being owned by the same company and sharing offices and production facilities, the publications maintained competing news teams and ran separate stories. In 1971, Joe W. Seacrest chose his son Joe R. Seacrest and his nephew Mark Seacrest to run the Lincoln Evening Journal. In 1990, the two papers began running combined weekend and holiday editions. In 1995, Lee Enterprises bought the Journal from the Seacrest family, and merged it with the Star. The first edition of the merged Lincoln Journal Star rolled off the presses on August 7, 1995.

It is pale brown or grayish coloured, with eight wide, dark stripes on its back and sides. Grandidier's mongoose is larger than the related broad-striped Malagasy mongoose, G. fasciata, and its stripes are not as wide. The species is named after Alfred Grandidier. This species has been called one of the rarest carnivorans in the world. With a few exceptions, the majority of records of G. grandidieri come from a narrow zone at the western edge of the Mahafaly Plateau in the Parc National de Tsimanampetsotsa, making it the Madagascan carnivore with the smallest range. Nocturnal and crepuscular, this species lives in pairs which produce one offspring a year, in the summer. They hunt primarily by searching through ground litter and in rock crevices. The diet of Grandidier's mongoose varies markedly between the dry and wet seasons. Whereas food consists mainly of invertebrates throughout the year, small vertebrates are the most important food by biomass, comprising 58% during the dry season and 80% during the wet season. Grandidier's mongoose weighs 1.1 to 1.3 lb (500 to 600 g).R. Andriatsimietry et al.

The species is sympatric with two other carnivores, the fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) and the introduced Indian civet (Viverricula indica). However, there seems to be virtually no range or dietary overlap between these animals and Grandidier's mongoose. From sub-fossil evidence, it is clear that the region underwent drastic climatic change during the last 3000–2000 years. It is presumed that the distribution of this mongoose was notably broader and the proportion of prey types different in earlier times than today. Grandidier's mongoose must have adapted to dryer conditions, which have resulted in its very limited distribution and the exploitation of notably small prey. The animals can be vocal, with a cooing mew, and are described as sociable and playful.BBC, Island of Marvels, Part 3.

She was built to transfer passengers and mail to and from and , and is the only surviving White Star Line vessel in existence today. Background Nomadic was one of two vessels commissioned by the White Star Line in 1910 to tender for their new ocean liners and , which were too large to dock in Cherbourg harbour. She and her running mate ferried passengers, their baggage, mail and ship's supplies to and from large ocean liners moored offshore. It is the only surviving vessel designed by Thomas Andrews who also designed . The keel of Nomadic was laid down in the Harland and Wolff shipyards, Belfast in 1910 (yard number 422). She was built on slipway No. 1 alongside RMS Olympic and RMS Titanic, which were constructed on slipways 2 and 3, of the Arrol Gantry, respectively. She was launched on 25 April 1911 and delivered to the White Star Line on 27 May, following sea trials. Construction The ship is long overall and wide, with a gross registered tonnage of 1,273 tons. Propulsion was provided by two single-ended coal-fired boilers and two compound steam engines, each driving two triple-bladed propellers of in diameter, which gave a service speed of . Nomadic is of steel construction, with steel frames, beams, bulkheads and riveted hull plating. She had four working decks with various hold spaces beneath. She could carry up to 1,000 passengers when fully loaded. Passenger accommodation consisted of lower and upper deck passenger lounges and open deck areas on the bridge and flying bridge decks. The vessel was divided into first and second class passenger areas, with first class passengers enjoying the fore areas of the ship. A small area in the aft end of the lower deck was assigned for overspill of third-class passengers from SS Traffic. Internally, Nomadic was fitted out to a similar standard as the liners Olympic and Titanic, which she was built to serve. As such, she had more luxuries than most tenders of her day, with cushioned benches, tables, porcelain water fountains, sex-specific bathrooms and a buffet bar. She contained ornate decorative joinery and plasterwork, particularly in the first class lounges of the ship. Nomadic was built in the United Kingdom, but as she was operated in French coastal waters by a French crew, she had a number of peculiarities, such as imperial and metric draft marks on opposing sides of the hull. Service history Cherbourg in 1911.alt=left Nomadic arrived in Cherbourg on 3 June 1911 to begin her tendering duties for the White Star Line. On 10 April 1912 she transported 274 passengers to RMS Titanic for the liner's maiden voyage, including New York millionaire John Jacob Astor IV with his new wife Madeleine, Sir Cosmo Duff Gordon and his wife, couturière, Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, American journalist and United States Army officer Archibald Butt, Denver millionairess Margaret Brown, and mining tycoon Benjamin Guggenheim. During World War I and until 1919, Nomadic was requisitioned by the French government, and she saw service as an auxiliary minesweeper, also ferrying American troops to and from the harbour in Brest (France). After the war, she returned to her tendering duties, but in 1927 she was sold and continued to tender under the ownership of the Compagnie Cherbourgeoise de Transbordement. Following the 1934 merger of White Star and Cunard Line and the opening of the enlarged port at Cherbourg, Nomadic ceased her tendering duties. She was sold to the Société Cherbourgeoise de Sauvetage et de Remorquage (SCSR or Cherbourg Tow & Rescue Society) and renamed Ingenieur Minard. During World War II, Nomadic again saw service; on 18 June 1940 she took part in the evacuation of Cherbourg. She was subsequently requisitioned by the Royal Navy and based in Portsmouth harbour, she operated as an accommodation ship. During the war, Cherbourg port was heavily damaged, so large ocean liners could no longer dock there. Nomadic was saved from the shipbreakers and again returned to tendering duties for the SCSR from Cherbourg. She served the ocean liners of the day, such as Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth. She finally retired from these duties on 4 November 1968. Nomadic as she appeared in 2000, docked on the left Nomadic lay idle for five years but was subsequently bought by a private individual, Yvon Vincent, saving her from scrap once again. She was extensively converted into a floating restaurant and function vessel, and in October 1974 was relocated to the Seine in Paris. A depiction of Nomadic was briefly seen alongside the Titanic in Cherbourg in James Cameron's 1997 film Titanic. By 1999, the business was in financial difficulties and Nomadic was seized by the Paris harbour authorities in 2002. The authorities removed some of Nomadic's superstructure to tow her below the Seine's bridges. On 1 April 2002 she was towed out of Paris to Le Havre. Following Vincent's death in March 2005, the authorities sought to dispose of the vessel and attempted to find a buyer for Nomadic, if no buyer was found, she risked being sold for scrap value. On learning of her fate, heritage and maritime enthusiasts (including the French Titanic Society, Belfast Industrial Heritage, Belfast Titanic Society and the Save Nomadic appeal) began campaigns to raise funds to buy the vessel. These campaigns were well supported by the public, particularly in Northern Ireland, but were unable to raise sufficient funds to meet Nomadic's reserve price. The campaigns, however, gained political and governmental support, and on 26 January 2006, the Northern Ireland government Department for Social Development bought the vessel at auction for €250,001 (the reserve price being €250,000). SS Nomadic left Le Havre to return to Belfast on 12 July 2006, and arrived close to where she was built, on 18 July 2006. The vessel was welcomed back by the Department for Social Development Minister, David Hanson MP and the Deputy Lord Mayor of the City of Belfast, Councillor Ruth Patterson and a number of well-wishers. Nomadic arrived \\"piggy backed\\" on a marine transportation barge,https://twitter.com/NomadicCollect1/status/1152546602910961664 which had been contracted by the department. Nomadic Charitable Trust The Northern Ireland Department for Social Development set up a voluntary charitable trust, the Nomadic Charitable Trust (NCT) in December 2006, to take ownership of the vessel and oversee her conservation and restoration. The NCT's stated aim is; \\"To restore the SS Nomadic and to make her accessible to the public, to ensure she can play a key role in the ongoing celebration of Titanic, ensure a lasting legacy to celebrate our maritime and industrial heritage and as a catalyst for tourism, social and economic development\\". The NCT transferred ownership of Nomadic to the Titanic Foundation in April 2015. The ship is now run by Titanic Belfast Nomadic Limited and incorporated into the Titanic Belfast visitor attraction. Nomadic Preservation Society The Nomadic Preservation Society (NPS) was also founded in 2006. Its stated aims include collaboration with the NCT and all other parties involved in preserving Nomadic, including raising and donating funds, conducting historical research and publicising Nomadic as a tourist attraction. SS Nyanza In 2006 the NPS had found and made aware to the NCT of the 1907-built cargo ship on Lake Victoria in East Africa, , that has boilers and triple-expansion engines of a similar size to those originally installed in SS Nomadic. Nyanzas owner intended to convert her to diesel power and scrap her steam engines and boilers, so NPS suggested that NCT buy them to install in Nomadic. In 2008 the NPS alleged that Nyanzas owner had heard nothing from the NCT for 18 months and that Nyanzas engines and boilers were in danger of being removed and scrapped. NPS launched an independent fundraising appeal to rescue the engines and boilers but this never came to fruition. Restoration and conservation Nomadic at Barnett Dock, before restoration On appointment, the NCS began essential maintenance works, fund raising and preparation for the planned restoration. A study by Belfast City Council estimated the cost of restoring Nomadic at £7 million. The NCS has subsequently secured funding in excess of £6.5 million; major benefactors include the UK Heritage Lottery fund, EU Peace III fund, Northern Ireland Tourist Board, Belfast City Council and Ulster Garden Villages. In August 2008, Nomadic was considered by National Historic Ships and was entered into the National Register of Historic Vessels as part of the National Historic Fleet. This recognises Nomadics historic significance as the register includes a list of vessels, including Cutty Sark, Mary Rose and the Royal Yacht Britannia. In August 2009 Nomadic was moved to Hamilton Graving Dock, on Queen's Road, Belfast. This dry dock, itself a piece of maritime heritage, was partly refurbished in a joint partnership between the Belfast Harbour Commission and Titanic Quarter Ltd. The dock is believed to be where Nomadic was originally fitted out and has now been leased as a permanent location for Nomadic. By late 2009 the NCS had sufficient funding to begin major conservation and restoration works. In February 2010, major works commenced with external blasting and priming of the steel hull, preventing further deterioration of the steelwork. Nomadic during her restoration in November 2011 Nomadic in March 2012, in Belfast, Northern Ireland painted in full White Star colours, after the first phase of restoration Nomadic in dry dock in 2016 In February 2011, Harland and Wolff were appointed by the NCS to undertake steelwork restoration and repair, rekindling a 100-year link with the ship's original builders. The value of the contract was £2 million and included re-creation of the missing bridge and flying bridge decks, hull repairs and painting of the vessel in her original White Star Line livery. These works were completed in February 2012. The ship is still not fully restored, most notably the forward mast and subsequent rigging is still missing, although it is to be installed at a later date. The final phase of restoration works includes conservation and restoration of the luxurious interior, featuring plaster panelling and ornate joinery. Original SS Nomadic timber panelling was purchased from a French museum by the Nomadic Preservation Society, using funds raised during the Save Nomadic appeal. The panelling has since been loaned to the NCS for sympathetic restoration and reinstatement back on board the vessel. This phase of works also includes restoration works to the historic Hamilton Graving Dock and pumphouse, converting the dock area and ship into a tourist attraction. Lifeboats As far as is known, the remaining lifeboat from Nomadic is one of the last two White Star Line lifeboats still intact in the world, the other being Lifeboat 6 from . Nomadic originally had two lifeboats, believed to have capacity for about 28 people each when fully loaded, to serve up to 1,200 passengers and crew in an emergency. They were later supplemented by life-rafts. Nomadic's lifeboats were removed around October 1974 after Vincent moved the ship to Paris. They lay onto the quayside opposite Nomadic for 13 years, being vandalised and having pieces stolen. In 1987 Jean-Charles Arnault made a deal with Vincent to loan him the two lifeboats for Le Musée Maritime Chantereyne at Cherbourg. The lifeboats were left outdoors and, over time, the weight of the boats resulted in their shape collapsing, the wood itself rotting. Eventually, the museum deemed Lifeboat 1 damaged beyond rescue and destroyed it by burning. Then, historian Philippe Delaunoy rediscovered the remaining lifeboat. In 2007 it was purchased from the museum. To transport the lifeboat back to Belfast by lorry a special cradle was built to support the boat, and it was taken to Petticrew Marine. Over the next five years the boat hung from a cradle there and slowly returned to its original shape. At the same time funds were being raised to restore the boat, and a grant was awarded from the Heritage Lottery Fund. With it back in its correct shape, work started on restoration, replacing missing timbers and re-fabricating missing parts. One of the stipulations from the Heritage Lottery Fund was the use of original materials. A new keel had to be made and put into place for the clinker-wood construction to connect with. When this was complete, work progressed restoring the hull, replacing missing or damaged wood with original materials. The lifeboat nameplate had been stolen, so this was reconstructed by a benefactor using archive photographs. With the lifeboat nearing completion there was some dispute as to how it would be put on public display. Originally the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum had agreed to take it as an exhibit, but they withdrew as there was not space for it. Attempts were made to return the lifeboat to Nomadic, to be displayed alongside her in a weatherproof box, but this was unsuccessful. As of 2014 the boat has been structurally restored with the original paint colours. The lifeboat is displayed on the Queen Mary, in Long Beach, California. The lifeboat is near the entrance to the engine room. She arrived in June 2017 and is still there as of 2020, thanks to White Star Memories, who have loaned it to them.

Reeder, Esther Jacobson, Scythian gold: treasures from ancient Ukraine. San Antonio Museum of Art - 1999 - p. 352 (Чорноліська культура) is an Iron Age archaeological unit dating ca. 1025–700 BC. It was located in the forest-steppe between the Dniester and Dnieper Rivers, in the (Чорний ліс) of Kirovohrad Oblast in central Ukraine. This location corresponds to where Herodotus later placed his Scythian ploughmen. From 200 BC, the culture was overrun by the arrival of Germanic and Celtic settlers to the region. Features Chernolesian settlements include open sites and also fortified sites surrounded by multiple banks and ditches. Houses were usually surface-dwellings and of substantial size, ~ 10 x 6 m. Artifacts found in settlements include stone and bronze axes, weapons, bronze ornaments, and iron tools. Cultivated wheat, barley, and millet were staples. The economy was agricultural, with stockbreeding. Bronze artefacts indicate significant contact with Scythian nomads, and finds of finer ceramic wares suggest contact with Thrace and Black Sea Greek colonies. Inhabitants practised biritual burials: inhumation under barrows and cremation in urnfields (the latter predominated in later periods). Development Classical Chernoles period finished c. 500 BC, corresponding to a simplification in the material culture, interpreted to represent a pauperization due to the political domination of the forest-steppe communities by Scythians. In these latter stages, we see an increase in fortified settlements, perhaps representing a defensive measure against the nomads (with earthen ramparts, ditches and timber walls). Despite the difficulties, settlement density actually increases, and the socio-cultural traditions continued. Notes References * James P.

Bamasaba live mainly in the Mbale District of Uganda on the slopes of Mount Elgon. Ancestor The Masaba, Bukusu and Luhya people believed that their ancestors were Kundu and Sela. The people of Ethiopia and the Ethiopian Highlands have no name for Kundu, except that it is a mountain peak in Oromiya. The Bamasaba ancestor, Maswahaba migrated from the Ethiopian Mountains traveling via Lake Turkana to Sironko and settled around Bududa where he fell in love with a Maasai girl who was known as Nabarwa. The family of Nabarwa demanded that in order for Maswahaba to marry their daughter he had to undergo their rite of circumcision. He agreed to do so. Culture Circumcision in Africa is an old culture as practiced by the Bamasaaba in Eastern Uganda. The culture of circumcision was adopted by the Bamasaba from their in-laws the Maasai people. The men among the Bagisu tribe undergo initiation ceremonies known as Imbalu. The initiation ceremonies among the Bamasaaba are held every two years during August. The Bamasaaba ancestors lived on bamboo shoots also known as maleya in the Lugisu language. These bamboo shoots are collected from bamboo trees on top of Mt. Elgon. Origin of the name Bagisu Maswahaba's first son with Nabarwa was Mwambu who was nicknamed Nkisu by his Maasai uncles who had stolen his fathers cows from him. Masawahaba failed to pronounce the nickname of Nkisu meaning a bull in Maasai language, given to his son his uncle and he pronounced it as Mugisu. The name Bagisu originated from the nickname Nkisu given to Mwambu by Maswababa's Maasai Brother-in-law. The Gisu speak a dialect of the Lumasaba language called Lugisu, which is fully understandable by other dialects, and is also understood by the Bukusu. The Bagishu share alot of things with the Bukusu from Kenya. They share culture and according to the Bukusu the bagishu are their real brothers its only the border that divides them.

Their language is also called 'Masaba'. They are closely related to the Bukusu and Luhya of Western Kenya. They are a mainly agricultural people, farming millet, bananas and sorghum on small-holder plots. Maize became popular with the coming of Europeans in late 1890s. The Bamasaaba are famous for their traditional male circumcision ceremonies, held every even year. In a three-day ceremony of dancing and feasting, preceding a couple of months preparations, the initiates are admitted into adulthood and expected to begin their formal contribution to the growth of their respective communities. The name Bamasaaba is sometimes used interchangeably with the name Bagisu, even though the latter is actually a tribe of the Bamasaaba nation. The current Babukusu of western Kenya are believed to have migrated from the Bamasaaba, particularly from areas around Bubulo, in current Manafwa District. Many clans among the Babukusu have their origins among the Bamasaaba, a testimony to this linkage. Masinde Muliro, once a veteran politician and elder of the Babukusu from Kitale, was from the Bakokho clan, with its base at Sirilwa, near Bumbo in Uganda. Other clans common to both sides include Batiiru Babambo, Baata, Bakitang'a and Batiiru. There are other clans whose names, however, that are only on one side, such as Babichache and Balonja who are mainly among the Babukusu. The common cultural ties are a further indication of close relations among the two sister ethnic groups. During the Constituent Assembly that led to the 1995 Constitution of Uganda, Mulongo Simon, a Delegate from Bubulo East, introduced Babukusu as one of the ethnic groupings of Uganda, acknowledging the fact that both groups, Bamasaaba and Babukusu are intertwined.  The Bamasaaba and Politics  Before the arrival of Europeans, Bamasaaba were organised in a decentralized way, but maintained strong clan system that brought them together as a community. They had a strong fighting force of youths, whose pre-occupation was to herd livestock and to train in warfare. They warded off attackers from neighbouring communities such as the Luo, Iteso, Elgon Masaai (Sabot and Sebei). Earlier, when the Maasai were still dominant in the eastern part of Mt. Elgon, they were the traditional hostile neighbours. The dual economic activity of both crop and animal husbandry generated a resilient economy that supported their livelihoods and developed into an independent cultural community that endured centuries of hostility. The advance of the European missionaries in late 1890s, facilitated by Kakungulu, a British Muganda agent, established a base for the British colonial rule in the area. This changed drastically the geo- political settings of the Bamasaaba form there onwards. The Church Missionary Society (CMS) led by Bishop Tucker, assisted by Kakungulu, established British and particularly Anglican systems in the area. They built, through forced labour, road infrastructure and established administrative units. By independence in 1962, Bamasaaba had had several western educated personalities with some schools, such as Nabumali High School, excelling in national examinations. Mbale town was the cleanest in the country. Professors Timothy Wangusa, Bigala and later Dani Wadada Nabudere were among the leading academics from the Bamasaaba. George Masika, the Chief Justice and Masette Kuuya, a youthful minister during Obote II in the 1980s, James Wambogo Wapakhabulo, the foreign Minister in the Museveni regime, and Hon. Emmanuel Bwayo Wakhweya, former Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, are examples of leading personalities from the Bamasaaba.

Biography Born in Lynn, Massachusetts, into a prominent family engaged in the manufacture of patent medicines (his great-grandmother was Lydia E. Pinkham), he studied organ performance and music theory at Phillips Academy, Andover, with Carl F. Pfatteicher. \\"The single event that changed my life was a concert [at Andover] by the Trapp Family Singers in 1939, right after they had escaped from Germany,\\" Pinkham once recalled. \\"Here, suddenly, I was hearing clarity, simplicity. It shaped my whole outlook,\\" he said in a 1981 interview with The Boston Globe. At Harvard, he studied with Walter Piston; Aaron Copland, Archibald T. Davison, and A. Tillman Merritt were also among his teachers. There he completed a bachelor's degree in 1942 and a master's in 1944. He also studied harpsichord with Putnam Aldrich and Wanda Landowska, and organ with E. Power Biggs. At Tanglewood, he studied composition with Samuel Barber and Arthur Honegger, and subsequently with Nadia Boulanger. Pinkham taught at the Boston Conservatory beginning in 1946, and at the New England Conservatory of Music from 1959 until his death in 2006; while there, he created and chaired the program on early music performance. In 1951, Pinkham conducted ten works by Boulanger Award winners in their Boston performance première in a special Peabody Mason Concert series commemorating the Paris Bi-Millennial year.Harold Rogers, \\"Contemporary Music in Boston Première\\", Christian Science Monitor (May 16, 1951). He also taught at various times at Simmons College (1953–1954), Boston University (1953–1954), and Harvard University (1957–1958). Among Pinkham's notable students were the jazz musician and composer Gigi Gryce (1925–1983) and the composer Mark DeVoto. For forty-two years (1958–2000),Daniel Pinkham, \\"Daniel Pinkham: Composer \\". Daniel Pinkham home page, 2007 (Accessed 6 November 2012). Pinkham was the organist of King's Chapel in Boston, a position which gave him much exposure to and opportunity to write church-related music; the Sunday evening concert series he created there celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2007. He was also a frequent guest on the E. Power Biggs program on the CBS Radio Network. He performed regularly with the Boston Symphony Orchestra as an organist and as a harpsichordist, and he performed extensively with noted violinist Robert Brink, with whom he commissioned a duo for violin and harpsichord from Alan Hovhaness. Pinkham died in Natick, Massachusetts, of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, at the age of 83. He is survived by his longtime partner, the organist Andrew Paul Holman. Compositional career Pinkham's enormous output represents a broad cross- section of 20th-century musical trends. He produced work in virtually every genre, from symphonies to art songs, though the preponderance of his music is religious in nature, frequently choral and/or involving organ. Much of his music was written for use in church services or other ceremonial occasions, and reflected his longstanding relationship with King’s Chapel. At various points in his career, he embraced plainchant, medievally-influenced modal writing, and 17th-century forms (in the 1930s and 40s, under the influence of Stravinsky and Hindemith and reflecting his commitment to the early music revival), dodecaphony and serialism (in the 1950s and 60s), electronic music (beginning in 1970),Sabine Feisst, \\"Pinkham, Daniel (Rogers)\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publisher, 2001). and the neo-baroque idiom. Some of Pinkham's best-known works are designed for services: the Christmas, Advent, and Wedding cantatas, the latter of which is performed particularly often. In 2003, he gained further notice with his commissioned piece, written for the Boston Landmarks Orchestra, of Make Way for Ducklings. In keeping with the name of the ensemble, the work was designed to be performed for families at the Boston Public Garden, near the famous sculptures based on Robert McCloskey's endearing picture book. Pinkham's scholarship and work were recognized with a Fulbright Fellowship in 1950 and a Ford Foundation Fellowship in 1962. He received honorary degrees from the New England Conservatory of Music as well as from Nebraska Wesleyan University, Adrian College, Westminster Choir College, Ithaca College, and the Boston Conservatory. In 1990, Pinkham was named Composer of the Year by the American Guild of Organists. In 1995, he was awarded the Brock Commission from the American Choral Directors Association. Retrieved March 2016 In 2006 Pinkham was named Musician of the Year by the Boston Musicians' Association, AFM Local 9-535.

It spans approximately from Alberta's border with British Columbia in the west to its border with Saskatchewan in the east. The route is a divided expressway throughout the province with the exception of a section in central Calgary where it is an arterial thoroughfare.

It generally travels in a southeast direction along the Bow River through Banff National Park (Improvement District No. 9), passing by the Hamlet of Lake Louise and the Town of Banff. The segment of Highway 1 through the national park is maintained by the Government of Canada. Upon exiting Banff National Park, Highway 1 is maintained by Alberta Transportation for until it reaches Calgary. This segment of the highway generally travels in an east direction through the rural municipalities of the Municipal District of Bighorn No. 8 and Rocky View County. It also briefly crosses a portion of Kananaskis Improvement District. For urban communities, this segment passes by the Hamlet of Harvie Heights, through the Town of Canmore, and by the hamlets of Dead Man's Flats and Lac des Arcs.

Certain stretches of 16 Avenue N function as either a freeway or an expressway, while other stretches function as an urban arterial road, particularly between Bow River and Bowness Road and between Crowchild Trail and Deerfoot Trail where there are numerous at-grade intersections. As a result, speed limits on 16 Avenue N drop as low as . Stoney Trail (Highway 201) provides an alternate controlled-access freeway route across the city.

East of Medicine Hat, Highway 1 is maintained by Alberta Transportation for until it enters the Province of Saskatchewan, continuing as Saskatchewan Highway 1. This segment of the highway generally travels in an east direction through Cypress County. For urban communities, this segment passes through the Hamlet of Dunmore and by the hamlets of Irvine and Walsh.  History  A review of historical Alberta Official Road Maps shows that Highway 1 was numbered Highway 2 prior to 1941 (while Highway 2 as it is known today was numbered Highway 1 prior to 1941). Exit numbering along Highway 1 began in 2005. As of March 2010, only the stretch of Highway 1 between Banff National Park and Calgary had been assigned exit numbers. Between 1964 and 1972, a completely new route from Calgary to Canmore was built. The route included new overpasses, bridges, the Canmore Bypass, and 4 lane divided highway. In 1976, Parks Canada began twinning Highway 1 through Banff National Park, with the highway twinned to Banff by 1985 and to Castle Junction by 1997. Twinning of the section between Castle Junction and the British Columbia border was completed in 2014, with the final of Highway 1 between Lake Louise and the British Columbia border opening to traffic on June 12 of that year. Between 1973 and 1990 the highway was twinned from Calgary to the Saskatchewan Border.  Future  Alberta Transportation has long term, conceptual plans for Highway 1 to have a phased upgrade to a freeway standard within its area of jurisdiction (outside Banff National Park and Calgary city limits). Currently, areas that have been studied are a proposed interchange located between Garden Road and Conrich Road, Rainbow Road near Chestermere, and Highway 36 near Brooks. There is not timeline for construction of these interchanges. = Strathmore = Alberta Transportation has plans for a bypass around the Town of Strathmore. Initial proposals included a realignment northwest of Gleichen, continuing west to run south of Eagle Lake and then continuing northwest where it will rejoined the existing alignment near Cheadle, between Highway 24 and Strathmore, as well as a link to the Highway 22X corridor. The final proposal is a more scaled back realignment around Strathmore to the south, bypassing approximately of existing Highway 1, and the right-of-way is currently designated as Highway 1X. There is no timeline for construction. = Medicine Hat = The Trans- Canada Highway has a few remaining signalized intersections within Medicine Hat, and Alberta Transportation is studying both a long-term realignment of Highway 1, as well as possible upgrades to the existing alignment. The realignment would bypass Redcliff, Medicine Hat and Dunmore to the south, bypassing approximately of existing Highway 1, and the right-of-way is also currently designated as Highway 1X. Possible upgrades to the existing alignment include a new interchange at 1 Street SW and intersection closures at 6 Street SW and 16 Street SW. There is no timeline for the bypass construction or any upgrades to the existing alignment.

Froeschner, eds. (1988) , Catalog of the Heteroptera, or True Bugs, of Canada and the Continental United States In the state of California alone the bug causes US$30 million in damage to cotton plants each year, and at least US$40 million in losses to the state's strawberry industry. *The European tarnished plant bug (Lygus rugulipennis) is distributed throughout Europe, where it will feed on over 400 types of crop plant from peach trees to wheat to lettuce.British Bugs Description These insects appear as small oval creatures. Adult lygus are approximately 3 mm wide and 6 mm long, colored anything in a range from pale green to reddish brown or black. The bugs can be solid shaded or mottled, and have a distinctive triangle or V-shape on their backs. Adults are capable of flight, and will often thus escape when approached. Nymphs are wingless, and being light green in color, are often mistaken for aphids. However, lygus nymphs have harder exoskeletons, are typically more active, gain spots as they age, and lack aphid cornicles.[7] Biology Lygus bugs are known for their destructive feeding habits - they puncture plant tissues with their piercing mouthparts, and feed by sucking sap. Both the physical injury and the plant's own reaction to the bugs' saliva cause damage to the plant. The females insert their eggs directly into the plant tissues using piercing ovipositors, and the newly emerged nymphs are voracious consumers of plant tissue juices. Signs that a plant has been attacked by lygus bugs include discoloration, deformation of shoots and stems, curling of leaves, and lesions on the plant tissues. Economic importance The more well-known lygus bugs are those that have agricultural impacts. Some lygus bugs are very serious agricultural pests. General Lygus Information Some methods of biological pest control have proved useful against lygus bugs. For example, wasps of the genus Peristenus are parasitoids of lygus bugs; an adult wasp will inject an egg into a lygus nymph, and once the egg hatches the wasp's larva will consume the nymph from the inside out.

She was the daughter of George I of Greece and Olga Constantinovna of Russia. She died of childbirth complications.  Early life Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark was born on at Mon Repos, the summer residence of the Greek royal family on the island of Corfu. She was the third child and eldest daughter of King George I of Greece and his wife, Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia. Alexandra's father was not a native Greek, but he had been born a Danish prince named Christian Wilhelm of Schleswig-Holstein- Sonderburg-Glücksburg, a son of Christian IX, King of Denmark, and he had been elected to the Greek throne at the age of seventeen. Five of his sons (Constantine, George, Nicholas, Andrew and Christopher), and two daughters (Alexandra and Maria), attained adulthood. The Greek royal family was not wealthy by royal standards and they lived with simplicity. King George was a taciturn man, but contrary to the general approach of the time, he believed in happy rambunctious children. The long corridors of the royal place in Athens were used by Alexandra and her siblings for all types of play and sometimes a \\"bike ride\\" would be led by the King himself. Raised by British nannies, English was the children's first language, but they spoke Greek between themselves. They also learned German and French. Alexandra, nickname \\"Aline\\" within her family, or Greek Alix, to distinguish her from her aunt and godmother, Alexandra, Princess of Wales, had a sunny disposition and was much loved by her family. \\"She had one of those sweet and lovable natures that endeared her to everybody who came in touch with her,\\" recalled her brother, Nicholas. \\"She looked young and beautiful, and ever since she was a child, life looked as it had nothing but joy and happiness in store for her.\\"Mager (1998), p. 124 Alexandra's playmates were her brother Nicholas and her sister Maria, who followed her in age. Alexandra spent many holidays in Denmark visiting her paternal grandparents. In Denmark, Alexandra and her siblings met their Russian and British cousins in large family gatherings.

When she was eighteen years old, she was married to Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia, her maternal first cousin once removed and the youngest child and sixth son of Emperor Alexander II and his first wife, Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine. They had become close when Grand Duke Paul spent winters in Greece due to his frequent respiratory illnesses. The Greek royal family also frequently spent holidays with the Romanov family on visits to Russia or Denmark.Zeepvat (2004), p. 49 Their engagement was announced on 10 November 1888.Zeepvat, Dear, Unforgettable Alix, p. 8 The wedding took place on in St. Petersburg, at the chapel of the Winter Palace.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818-1959, p. 126 They had two children: * Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna (1890–1958) * Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich (1891–1942) Death Seven months into her second pregnancy, Alexandra took a walk with her friends on the bank of the Moskva River and jumped directly into a boat that was permanently moored there, but fell as she got in. The next day, she collapsed in the middle of a ball from violent labour pains. She gave birth to her son, Dimitri, lapsed into a fatal coma, and she died six days later in the Romanovs' estate Ilyinskoe near Moscow. The Grand Duchess was buried in the Peter and Paul Cathedral, St. Petersburg. Her grieving husband had to be restrained from throwing himself into the grave with her.Zeepvat (2004), p. 179 Her husband later morganatically remarried Olga Karnovich. Alexandra’s son would be involved in the murder of Grigori Rasputin, a favorite of Tsarina Alexandra Feodorvna, in 1916. In 1939 when Alexandra's nephew George II of Greece was reigning, the Greek government obtained permission from the Soviet government under Joseph Stalin to rebury Princess Alexandra in Greece. Her body was removed from the vault in Leningrad and transferred by a Greek ship to Athens. It was finally laid to rest near the Tatoi Palace. Alexandra's marble tombstone over an empty tomb is still in its place in the Peter and Paul Cathedral. The \\"Alexandra Maternity Hospital\\" (now \\"Alexandra General Hospital\\") in Athens was later named in her memory by another nephew, King Paul; it was affiliated with the University of Athens with a special remit to research and combat postpartum maternal mortality.

It was adapted from a short story which originally appeared in The Saturday Evening Post - \\"Criminal Mark\\" by John and Ward Hawkins.. Plot 'Doc' Penny (Ted de Corsia) and two other members of his gang, who have recently broken out of San Quentin, rob a gasoline station. In the process a police officer is killed and one of the gang members is wounded. As a city-wide search ensues, a hard-nosed detective named Lieutenant Sims (Sterling Hayden) searches records in an effort to determine if there might be an ex-con the thugs might contact. Sims rejects professionalism and logic and operates on raw emotion. He feels that Steve Lacey (Gene Nelson) is a good candidate the killers may contact, though he has been out of prison for two years and is trying hard to maintain his new life. Steve regularly receives phone calls from ex-cons who pass through town, each trying to \\"put the bite\\" on him. When Sims' man phones Steve, he does not answer; he has already got an anonymous call from someone both he and his wife, Ellen (Phyllis Kirk) assume is yet another former prisoner, and she persuades him to not pick up. This sparks Sims to suspect Steve of being involved in the crime. Morgan, the wounded man, knocks at Steve's door. The criminal has already summoned a disreputable, alcoholic former doctor who is now a veterinarian, Otto Hessler (Jay Novello), whom both men knew in prison; Steve demands Morgan leave, but he says he is \\"hurt bad\\" and cannot move. Shortly after he says this, he dies. The doctor arrives and confirms this, grabs some money from the dead man's jacket, and leaves. Steve recognizes that the other two escapees, Penny and Hastings, will likely arrive soon. Ellen convinces him to phone his parole officer; while they are talking, Sims shows up. He grills Steve, demonstrating that he believes \\"once a crook, always a crook\\" and takes him to jail for three days, threatening him with fresh charges if he does not help catch Penny and Hastings. Steve refuses. When Steve and Ellen get home after his release, the two men turn up and impose themselves. Fearing for Ellen's safety, Steve resigns himself to having them there for \\"a couple of days.\\" Sims visits Hessler and persuades him to go to Steve's to ascertain if he has heard, or expects to hear, from his old prison mates. The vet does what he is told and happens to overhear men's voices in the apartment, though he does not see anyone other than Steve. After Hessler is shaken up by Steve and leaves, Hastings follows him, in Steve's car, to the dog and cat hospital where he prevents Hessler's phone call to the police by murdering him. Penny, meanwhile, is laying out the details of his plan to rob a bank. Steve insists he will not be involved but when Hastings returns to report that he has \\"fixed\\" Hessler \\"real good\\" and, because someone heard the commotion and summoned police, he had to leave Steve's car behind, Penny notes that Steve is involved whether he wants to be or not. Penny then decides that all four will leave the apartment and set the bank job in motion. Sims finds the car and immediately orders an All Points Bulletin be issued for Steve Lacey, \\"wanted for murder.\\" Penny and Hastings direct Steve, in a stolen car, to a hideout where two other thugs are waiting. The deal is set that Steve must help with the robbery, as getaway driver, or Ellen will be harmed. When they pull the job, the criminals are ambushed; the entire bank is staffed with police officers. Steve takes off for the hideout, with Sims in pursuit. At the hideout, Steve fights off the gang member who is holding Ellen hostage. Sims takes the couple away in his car. After revealing that the note Steve left in his medicine cabinet, alerting police to the robbery, was found and helped to set the trap, Sims lectures Steve about how he chose to handle the situation - \\"Next time, Lacey, call me...you got trouble, you need help, call me.\\" He then sends the two home.

At least one 1952 location, Sawyer's Pet Hospital at the corner of San Fernando Road and Alma Street in Glendale, is still standing and still a pet hospital, albeit with a different name. Several locations seen onscreen, like the Bank of America on the southwest corner of Brand Boulevard and Broadway in Glendale (where the film's big robbery attempt takes place), as well as the distinctive dental building across Brand Boulevard, have been torn down and replaced. The final chase scene from the bank in Glendale to Chinatown in downtown Los Angeles, though edited, follows the actual route, including Brand Boulevard and the Glendale Boulevard fork on the Hyperion Viaduct, until Steve Lacey reaches the house (possibly on Maple Street, just east of Los Angeles Street in the Chinatown district) where the crazed Johnny Haslett is holding Lacey's wife. The gas station in the film's opening scene was on Wall Street just south of East 3rd Street, near Boyd Street, but has since been demolished. Other specific downtown Los Angeles locations include Los Angeles Union Station and the L.A. City Hall Building (including interiors of the Homicide Bureau). The final scene, where Lt. Sims sends Steve and Ellen home, was shot on the 200 block of North Main Street, with Sterling Hayden leaning against the side of the City Hall Building.

This mock-up is part of the archives of Coutts at their head office at 440 Strand Mary Peagram, the granddaughter of John Campbell, who married James Coutts in 1755 The \\"Three Graces\\", the daughters of Thomas Coutts The bank which was to become Coutts & Co, was originally a goldsmith-banker's shop. It was formed in July 28, 1692 by a young Scots goldsmith-banker, John Campbell of Lundie, Scotland. He set up business in the Strand, London, under a sign of the Three Crowns, as was customary in the days before street numbers.E. Healey, 'The Portrait of a Private Bank 1692-1992', Hodder & Stoughton, 1992, p. 3 Today, the Coutts logo still has the three crowns, and its headquarters is still on the Strand. Campbell died in 1712, leaving the business to members of his family. The dominant force was Campbell's son in law, George Middleton, who had become Campbell's partner in 1708. During Middleton's stewardship, the bank was buffeted by one crisis after another. The Jacobite rising of 1715 threatened the stability of the banking system, John Law, the Comptroller of France's finances, owed a great deal of money to the bank when the Mississippi Company bubble burst in 1720 and the English stock market collapsed in the same year. Stability for the bank did not return until 1735. John's son, George Campbell was also a partner, and ultimately became the sole partner after the death of Middleton in 1747, after which the bank was renamed the \\"Bankers of 59 Strand\\". In 1755, John Campbell's granddaughter, Mary (known as \\"Polly\\"), married a merchant and banker, James Coutts. Polly was George Campbell's niece and George immediately made James a partner. The bank became known as Campbell & Coutts, with James running the business and becoming sole partner following Polly's and George's deaths in 1760. George bequeathed most of his fortune, and the bank, to James. =Thomas Coutts= In 1761 James took his brother Thomas Coutts into the business, which was now named James and Thomas Coutts. James and Thomas did not always get on and eventually James drifted into politics, leaving the running of the bank to Thomas. James retired from the bank in 1775 due to ill health. The bank in the Strand became known as Thomas Coutts & Co. Thomas Coutts married twice. His first wife, a servant named Susannah Starkie, gave him three beautiful daughters nicknamed \\"The Three Graces\\" who eventually married leading figures in British society: the Earl of Guilford, the Marquess of Bute and Sir Francis Burdett. Thomas also had four sons who died in infancy. When Susannah died, he remarried just four days after the funeral. Thomas Coutts was 80 years old, and his new wife, Harriot Mellon, was 40 years younger and an actress, which stirred considerable comment. On Thomas' death in 1822 the bank was renamed \\"Coutts & Co.\\" Thomas' widow, Harriot, inherited £900,000 from Thomas along with a 50% share in the bank. Although she did not get on with her stepdaughters, she wanted to keep the bank in the Coutts family. Harriot died in 1837. In her will, the Coutts fortune was passed on to Thomas's granddaughter, Angela Burdett, the daughter of Sophia Coutts and Sir Francis Burdett. The will contained three conditions: firstly, Angela's 50% share in the bank must be held in trust; secondly, the heir must take the name Coutts; and thirdly, the heir must never marry a foreigner. =Angela Burdett-Coutts= Upon receipt of her inheritance, Angela Burdett-Coutts became the wealthiest woman in Britain. She devoted her life to philanthropy, giving away an estimated amount of between £3 million and £4 million. Her charity ranged widely: she supported the Church of England and its Anglican offshoots overseas, as well as the arts, but the main thrust of her charity was directed toward improving the lives of the poor. A sewing school in Spitalfields, cotton gins in what is now Nigeria, boats and nets for the Irish fishing industry, and ragged schools in the poorest sections of cities were but a few of her projects. Gladstone, the Prime Minister, and Queen Victoria resolved to acknowledge her philanthropic spirit formally. In 1871, she was granted a peerage in her own right as Baroness Burdett-Coutts of Highgate and Brookfield in the County of Middlesex. In 1880, it became known that the baroness wished to marry her young American secretary William Ashmead-Bartlett, who was her junior by thirty-seven years. The partners of the bank were aghast at the prospect of such a marriage, as were many dignitaries; they saw Bartlett as an adventurer, only interested in her money. Archibald Tait, the Archbishop of Canterbury, attempted to forestall such a marriage from occurring, while Queen Victoria herself, with whom the Baroness had often dined, tried to prevent what she called the \\"mad marriage\\". In a letter, the Queen wrote to Lord Harrowby stating that it would grieve her much \\"if Lady Burdett-Coutts were to sacrifice her high reputation and her happiness by such an unsuitable marriage\\". This letter was passed on to Lady Burdett-Coutts, who asked Lord Harrowby to reply that he had no knowledge of the subject alluded to—quite a snub to the Queen. One potential stumbling block to the marriage was her step-grandmother's (Harriot's) will which forbade marriage to an alien. As Bartlett was an American, the marriage would cause her to be disinherited. If this eventuality occurred, her younger sister, Clara, as next in line, was set to inherit. Angela Burdett-Coutts managed to get Clara to waive her rights. Clara's son Francis (known as Frank) was not, however, so easily dissuaded, and consulted his lawyers thinking to forestall the marriage by standing on their rights. Finally Bartlett himself, in the face of immense pressure from society, offered to release the Baroness from his offer of marriage. She, however, remained determined, refusing to release Bartlett from his promise, in spite of various scandalous accusations being made against him involving another woman, and even his fathering of an illegitimate child. In February 1881, at the age of 67, Angela Burdett-Coutts broke the terms of the will by marrying Bartlett in Christ Church, Down Street, Piccadilly. The partners of the bank rushed to reassure the press that the heiress was neither a partner in the bank, nor could she touch the capital. An argument sprang up over the inheritance and, in particular, over whether Her Ladyship should give up the bank to her sister Clara. The newlywed fought back claiming that Bartlett was only half American and therefore not technically an \\"alien\\". Her sister, Clara, then claimed the fortune, and the bitter dispute continued. In anticipation of victory, Clara and her son Frank took the name \\"Coutts\\"as required by the will. Finally, a compromise was struck, with the majority of the Coutts fortune set to pass to Clara and her heirs. Angela Burdett-Coutts, however, kept two fifths of the income until her death in 1906. On changing her name, Clara Burdett, who had married James Money in 1850, became Clara Burdett Money-Coutts. Her son Francis' full name became Francis Burdett Thomas Nevill Money-Coutts. He was better known as Francis (or Frank) Coutts, a writer and poet. He became 5th Baron Latymer in 1913 and died in 1923. The following appeared in Punch at the time: > Money takes the name of Coutts, Superfluous and funny For everyone considers > Coutts, Synonymous with Money. :—Vere Carpenter The Panic of 1890 forced the bank to change from a partnership to an unlimited liability company in 1892. At that time, limited liability was seen as risky by depositors. As a partnership, the Coutts family would have been personally liable to any depositor for his bank deposit in a crisis. However, there was no crisis. Despite this, there was little change in the organisation—the working partners were divided between managing and junior managing partners.E. Healey, The Portrait of a Private Bank 1692–1992, Hodder & Stoughton 1992, p. 375 =Further expansion= In 1904, the bank moved to its current premises at 440, The Strand. In 1914, Coutts took over the bank of Robarts, Lubbock & Co. in the City, obtaining a branch office and a clearing house seat in the process. In 1919, Coutts merged with the National Provincial & Union Bank of England but retaining the Coutts & Co. name and board of directors. Throughout the 20th century, Coutts opened more branches. The first West End branch outside 440 Strand was opened in 1921 in Park Lane. Further London branches were opened in the West End (1921), Cavendish Square (1927), Sloane Street (1929), Mayfair (1932), London Wall (1962), Brompton Road (1975), and Kensington (1978). It was not until 1961 that the Bank moved outside the capital, opening its first out-of-town branch at Eton. This was followed by a branch in Bristol in 1976. In 1969, National Provincial Bank (and its District Bank subsidiary) merged with Westminster Bank to form National Westminster Bank. Coutts embraced modern technology, becoming one of the first banks to bring in machine-posted ledgers at the end of the 1920s. In 1963 it was the first British bank to have a fully computerised accounting system. In 1987, Coutts gained international representation when Coutts established operations in Geneva. Between 1974 and 1978, Coutts' Strand headquarters were redeveloped by Frederick Gibberd and Partners. Francis Burdett Coutts's great grandson, Sir David Burdett Money-Coutts, became chairman in 1976, retiring in 1993, leaving his cousin Crispin Money-Coutts (heir to the title of Baron Latymer) as the last remaining Coutts name until his resignation. In October 1990, Coutts and NatWest decided to strengthen their representation internationally and the Coutts Group was created when subsidiaries already owned by Coutts and NatWest were merged. In 2000, NatWest was purchased by the Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS) in one of the largest corporate transactions in the European banking sector. RBS Group became NatWest Group in 2020. =Recent years= In 2003, Coutts acquired Zürich-based Bank von Ernst & Cie and in 2008, Coutts Bank von Ernst and other Coutts International subsidiaries became RBS Coutts Bank. These traded as RBS Coutts International to align them with the parent RBS Group until 2011, when RBS Coutts was renamed Coutts & Co. Limited. The international division was re-named Coutts International prior to its sale to Union Bancaire Privée in March 2015. RBS sold Coutts International to Union Bancaire Privée (UBP) on 29 March 2015, for an undisclosed figure. The sale was part of the Group's strategy to reduce the number of countries it operated in, in favour of a greater focus on the United Kingdom. Coutts' confirmed that it expected the transfer of its business in Europe and the Middle East to UBP to be completed by the end of 2015, and its business in Singapore and Hong Kong would follow in early 2016. UBP were required to rebrand the business.  Locations  Headquarters of Coutts in Strand at night The bank is headquartered at 440 Strand, which serves as its flagship client-facing office and branch. It reduced its London footprint in 2013 with the closure of its Canary Wharf, St Mary Axe, Cadogan Place and Fleet Street offices. It further reduced that footprint by exiting from Premier Place in London in 2017. It has 28 offices in the UK and formerly international offices in Zurich, Berne, Geneva, Hong Kong, Montevideo, Singapore, Dubai, Jersey, Isle of Man, Miami, Monaco and Cayman Islands. Following the sale of Coutts International in 2015, the bank's businesses in Switzerland, Monaco, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Singapore and Hong Kong transferred to UBP in October 2015. Its remaining businesses in Asia are due to transfer in 2016.  Clients  Until the 20th century Coutts was a clearing bank to the nobility and landed gentry, but today it is a wealth manager to a wider range of clients, including entrepreneurs, entertainers, sportsmen, professionals and executives. The British Royal Family are notable clients. There are stringent requirements to being accepted as a client, not just based on average and total financial assets. Prospective clients need at least £1,000,000 in investable assets, not including real estate.  Design  Coutts often collaborates with British fashion designers, including previous designs for its distinctive credit and debit cards. In 2004, British fashion designer and Savile Row tailor Ozwald Boateng designed the super-premium Coutts World Charge CardCoutts & Co to introduce 'super-premium' credit card designed by Ozwald Boateng Marketing Week while in 2006 Stella McCartney was commissioned to design the Coutts Visa debit card. The card included a translucent Coutts logo which could only be seen if held up to the light. In 2013 Coutts replaced its purple 'World' charge card, which had been designed by Boateng, with the new ‘Silk’ Charge card. The silk design was inspired by the traditional Chinese wallpaper brought back by Britain’s first ambassador to China, Earl Macartney in 1794, and presented to Thomas Coutts, which lines the walls of the boardroom at the Strand headquarters.  Sponsorship  Coutts sponsorship focuses on causes and organisations that share the Coutts values and traditions. In the early nineteenth century, Thomas Coutts became a shareholder of the Royal Opera House. Today, Coutts sponsors productions at the theatre, such as the 2013 production of La rondine. Since May 2011, Coutts has also been the principal sponsor of the Royal Court Theatre, the UK's leading new writing theatre based in Sloane Square. Since 2011, Coutts has also supported the London Design Festival - an annual event, held to celebrate and promote London as the design capital of the world, and as the gateway to the international creative community. Malpractice =Breaches of money laundering rules= In March 2012 Coutts was fined £8.75m for breaches of money laundering rules after three years of \\"serious\\" and \\"systemic\\" problems in handling the affairs of customers vulnerable to corruption because of their political links. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) fined Coutts because of an \\"unacceptable risk\\" that the bank could have been handling the proceeds of crime for a three-year period up to November 2010 after failing to properly deal with customers classified as \\"politically exposed persons\\". Following an industry-wide review in 2010, the FSA found that Coutts was not conducting robust enough checks on such high-risk customers and was not monitoring relationships with them properly. The FSA reviewed a sample of 103 high-risk customer files, and identified deficiencies in 73 of them. The FSA's acting director of enforcement and financial crime, Tracey McDermott, said that \\"Coutts's failings were significant, widespread and unacceptable. Its conduct fell well below the standards we expect and the size of the financial penalty demonstrates how seriously we view its failures\\". Coutts's bonus system rewarded bankers for opening accounts, providing an incentive to bring in new business without too much scrutiny, and the bank's anti-money laundering team, intended to act as a check in identifying high-risk customers, failed to identify enough \\"politically exposed persons\\". In two cases reviewed by the FSA, bankers did not conduct appropriate checks on the customers, and failed to identify serious criminal allegations against them. There were five cases where sources had provided \\"adverse intelligence\\" such as allegations of criminal activity, in each case the accounts were approved by Coutts. A spokesperson for Coutts said that there was no evidence that money laundering took place as a result of its deficient controls, and said that \\"We recognise our systems weren't totally adequate in the past and we've taken steps to improve these\\". Coutts would have been fined £12.5m if it had not agreed to settle at an early stage in the investigation. =Mis-selling of AIG savings product= In November 2011 the Financial Services Authority (FSA) fined Coutts £6.3m for mis-selling the American International Group (AIG) Enhanced Variable Rate Fund between December 2003 and September 2008. The FSA forced Coutts to compensate all customers who suffered a loss as a result of its failings in selling the AIG Life Premier Bonds. A significant proportion of the fund's assets were invested in riskier asset-backed securities. A run was started on the fund following the late-2000s financial crisis. Coutts customers still had £748m invested in the fund when it was suspended in September 2008, but were only allowed to withdraw half of their investment. Many transferred the remaining 50% to a non-interest bearing recovery fund until July 2012. The FSA said Coutts failed by giving advisers inadequate training around the risks of the product. Coutts recommended the fund to some customers even though it might have exposed them to more capital risk than they were willing to accept and many customers were advised to invest too large a proportion of their overall assets in the fund. Coutts agreed to settle at an early stage in exchange for a 30% discount on its fine, which would otherwise have been £9m.  References in culture  Coutts is mentioned in the 1889 Gilbert and Sullivan Savoy opera The Gondoliers in the following lyrics: > The Aristocrat who banks with Coutts— The Aristocrat who hunts and shoots— > The Aristocrat who cleans our boots— They all shall equal be! Robert Louis Stevenson mentions Coutts in his 1886 classic novella Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde as being the bank of choice for Dr Jekyll: \\"...and presently came back with the matter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts's drawn payable to bearer,...\\" In the first episode of Michael Palin's Around the World in 80 Days, Palin visits the bank to inquire about the safeguarding and ease of replacing money while on his trip. His bank manager suggests a code-word, which will alert a less knowledgeable member of his staff that Palin is indeed who he says he is, the code-word in question being Jabberwocky. In chapter three of Bram Stoker's novel, Dracula, Jonathan Harker lists the recipients of several of Dracula's letters in his journal, including: \\"... the third was to Coutts & Co., London\\".

Steam Locomotive 61264 at Crown Point TMD. The smokebox can be clearly seen, with the number affixed to the smokebox door. A smokebox with ash residues A smokebox is one of the major basic parts of a steam locomotive exhaust system. Smoke and hot gases pass from the firebox through tubes where they pass heat to the surrounding water in the boiler. The smoke then enters the smokebox, and is exhausted to the atmosphere through the chimney (or funnel). Early locomotives had no smokebox and relied on a long chimney to provide natural draught for the fire but smokeboxes were soon included in the design for two main reasons. Firstly and most importantly, the blast of exhaust steam from the cylinders, when directed upwards through an airtight smokebox with an appropriate design of exhaust nozzle, effectively draws hot gases through the boiler tubes and flues and, consequently, fresh combustion air into the firebox. Secondly, the smokebox provides a convenient collection point for ash and cinders (\\"char\\") drawn through the boiler tubes, which can be easily cleaned out at the end of a working day. Without a smokebox, all char must pass up the chimney or will collect in the tubes and flues themselves, gradually blocking them. The smokebox appears to be a forward extension of the boiler although it contains no water and is a separate component. Smokeboxes are usually made from riveted or welded steel plate and the floor is lined with concrete to protect the steel from hot char and acid or rainwater attack. Blower To assist the passage of the smoke and hot gases, a blower is often used. This is a pipe ending in a ring containing pin-sized holes, which creates a \\"ring\\" of steam jets. The steam forces out the smoke and draws further gases through the tubes. This in turn causes air to be drawn through the grate and firehole, making the fire burn hotter. Blastpipe When the locomotive is in motion, exhaust steam passes through the blastpipe, which is located within the smokebox. The steam is ejected through the chimney, again drawing the fire. The blastpipe is what produces the characteristic \\"chuff\\" sound. The dimensions of the blastpipe and chimney are critical to the steam generating capacity of the locomotive and its fuel economy, since there is a natural trade-off between a high-velocity steam jet giving a strong draw on the fire, and back-pressure on the exhaust. Small changes to this \\"front end\\" design can have a dramatic impact. More complex exhaust designs such as Kylchap, Lempor and Giesl, can achieve better results than the simple blastpipe and chimney arrangement. Smokebox door Ashes and soot which may be present in the smoke are often deposited in the smokebox. The front of the smokebox has a door which is opened to remove these deposits at the end of each locomotive's working day. The handle(s) must be tightened fully to prevent air leaks, which would reduce the draw on the fire and can also allow any unburnt char at the bottom of the smokebox to catch fire there. Some smokebox doors have a single handle in the form of a wheel; many British-built locomotives have a pair of smokebox door handles resembling the hands of a clock; other designs also exist. On many steamrollers an extension to the body of the smokebox also houses the bearing which supports the front roller. Due to limitations of space, these rollers usually have a drop-down flap instead of a circular smokebox door. Steam pipes The smokebox incorporates the main steam pipes from the regulator (or superheater header), one leading to each valve chest, a part of the cylinder casting. These may pass through the smokebox wall to join with the cylinder (outside steam pipes) or may stay within the profile of the smokebox (inside steam pipes). Inside steam pipes do not require lagging as the smokebox keeps them warm, but outside steam pipes are more common for locomotives with cylinders outside the frames. Some locomotive classes used both types depending on the date the batch was constructed (e.g. LNER Class V2). Lagging Because heat losses from the smokebox are of little consequence, it is not usually lagged. In most cases it appears to be the same diameter as the boiler in the finished locomotive but this only because of the boiler cladding; the boiler is narrower. Tank engines usually had their water tanks stop short of the unlagged smokebox as it could raise the temperature of the water sufficiently to cause problems with the injectors. Self-cleaning smokebox British Railways standard classes use this design, where a robust mesh grille is incorporated into the smokebox, forming a filter between the front tubeplate and the exhaust. Any large pieces of char passing through the boiler tubes tend to be broken up on impact with the mesh, creating finer particles which are swept up the chimney instead of accumulating in the bottom of the smokebox. This does not negate the need to clean out the smokebox but reduces the amount of work that has to be done. In the best case, smokebox cleaning could be avoided between boiler washouts, typically at intervals of two weeks. Locomotive layout The classic layout of a steam locomotive has the smokebox and chimney at the front of the locomotive, referred to as travelling \\"smokebox-first\\". Some designs reversed the layout to avoid problems (asphyxiation and poor visibility) caused by having the exhaust blowing back onto the crew; these were called cab forward locomotives. Spark arrester Model steam locomotive showing spark arrester mesh A spark arrester is often installed within the smokebox. This may take the form of a cylindrical mesh running from the top of the blast pipe to the bottom of the chimney. The purpose of a spark arrester is to prevent excessively large fragments of hot ash from being exhausted into the environment where they may pose a fire risk. For this reason, spark arresters are generally installed on locomotives running through dry environments. They should not be confused with the external spark arrestors fitted to some locomotives. The presence of a spark arrester may have a thermodynamic effect, distorting the draw of air over the fire and thereby reducing total power output. Thus their use can be contentious. Superheating Superheater viewed from the smokebox. Top center is the superheater header, with pipes leading to cylinders. Tubes below feed steam into and out of the superheater elements within the flues. Locomotives fitted with a superheater will usually have a superheater header in the smokebox. Steam enters the header as \\"wet\\" (saturated) steam, and then passes through a superheater element. This takes the form of a pipe which runs twice through an enlarged smoke tube in the boiler. The steam enters a separate chamber in the header, this time as superheated or dry steam. The advantage of superheating is that the steam has greater expansive properties when entering the cylinders, so more power can be gained from a smaller amount of water and fuel.

Eklingji is believed to be the ruling deity of Mewar Princely State and the Maharana rules as his Dewan.  History  According to the 15th century text Ekalinga Mahatmya, the original temple at Eklingji was constructed by the 8th century ruler Bappa Rawal. The original temple and Vigraha (idol) were destroyed during invasions by the Delhi Sultanate rulers. The earliest extant idol was installed by Hamir Singh (14th century), who also carried out extensive renovations to the main temple. Rana Kumbha (15th century) rebuilt the temple, in addition to constructing a Vishnu temple. His 1460 inscription describes him as \\"the personal servant of Ekling\\". In the late 15th century, Ghiyath Shah of Malwa Sultanate attacked Mewar, and devastated Eklingji. Kumbha's son Rana Raimal (r. 1473–1509) defeated and captured him, and obtained a ransom for his release. With this ransom, Raimal patronized the last major rebuilding of the temple complex, and installed the present murti at the main temple. Originally, the temple likely belonged to the Pashupata sect, and was subsequently in the custody of the Nath sect. In the 16th century, it came under the control of the Ramanandis.

Background Broué was born in Privas, Ardèche, around 1926. His father was a civil servant and mother a school teacher: they had \\"strong republican views\\". Career In 1936, Broué supported a French general strike as well as the Spanish Republic. By 1940, with Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia in a non-aggression pact, he helped organize a Communist party cell at the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. The French Communist Party expelled these organizers; they said Broué suffered from Trotskyism. The accusation piqued his interest, and he began reading about Trotsky from the private library of teacher Élie Reynier. With the Party, he fought in the French resistance against Nazi occupiers during Second World War. When Joseph Stalin disbanded the Comintern in 1943, Broué became strongly critical of Stalinism, resigning from the FCP as a result. By 1944, he became a Trotskyist, joined the Fourth International, and remained a Trotskyist for the rest of his life. In 1952, he followed Pierre Lambert during a split in the movement and continued as a \\"Lambertist\\" for many years. He was active in the Internationalist Communist Party and then the Internationalist Communist Organisation before expelled in 1989. He became a secondary school teacher, until 1965 when he became lecturer in history at the University of Grenoble and then professor. In 1977, he set up the Trotsky Institute, to publish in French all of Trotsky's writings (so far, 27 volumes). He also founded and edited the Cahiers Léon Trotsky, devoted to the history of Trotskyism. Between 2003 and his death, he was a close collaborator and supporter of the International Marxist Tendency. Personal life Broué married three times. His third wife Andrée died in 1989 from cancer. Former student Jean-Pierre Juy was a long-time friend. Alan Woods was a late-life friend and admirer. Broué died in Grenoble, France, in his sleep in the early hours July 27, 2005, age 79. He had prostate cancer. Five children survived him: two sons and three daughters. His son Michel Broué is a notable mathematician.  Works  The basic inspiration for Broué's books was his desire to explain Stalinism. His book Trotsky (1988) counters the work of Isaac Deutscher. He worked for three years at Harvard, to which Trotsky had sold his papers in 1940. Broué and assistants were the first researchers to use them since the archive opened in 1980. Alan Woods has called it \\"a very healthy antidote to the superficial and pretentious philistinism of Isaac Deutscher\\". The recent republication of Trotsky's autobiography, My Life, has a foreword written by Broué. =Books written= The U.S. Library of Congress lists the following books. * Revolución y la guerra de España (with Émile Témime), translated by Francisco González Aramburo (1962) * Parti bolchévique; histoire du P.

The airline had its head office in Kaloum, Conakry.\\"Bienvenue.\\" Air Guinée. Retrieved on 26 February 2010. Founded in 1960, the airline had flights from Conakry International Airport. The company was privatised in 1992, and was eventually dissolved in 2002. History =Formative years= When the idea of Air Afrique was being mooted, Guinea and Mali opted not to join the consortium with other, mainly French West African, nations, and instead chose to form their own national airlines. In March 1960 the Guinean government signed a series of agreements with the Soviet Union, one of which provided for the supply of aircraft, crews and other technical assistance, ostensibly aimed at upgrading Conakry's airport. The company was founded by decree N°048/PRG/ on 31 December 1960, with technical support from the Soviets, who also supplied an aircraft: an Ilyushin Il-14. The aircraft originated from Czechoslovakia and was crewed by Czechoslovakian crews. Operations began before the end of the year, with flights from Conakry to Boké and Kankan, both of which had previously been operated by Union Aéromaritime de Transport. Service to Bamako commenced shortly afterwards, and the route was shared between Air Guinée, UAT and Air France. In April 1961, Air Guinée was nationalised. Over the years services to Dakar, Freetown and Monrovia were started, with plans to service Paris and Moscow also raised; however, these services were not implemented because Guinea failed to obtain traffic rights to France. Before the relationship between Air Guinée and the Soviets concluded in 1963, the airline had obtained one Yakovlev Yak-40, four Antonov An-24s and two Antonov An-12s. In December 1962 Air Guinée signed a contract with Alaska Airlines which saw the American airline providing management expertise, in addition to two Douglas DC-6s. The deal would have seen Alaska Airlines contracting with the airline over a seven-year period; however, the contract ended after only six months, leading to the United States Agency for International Development paying a US$700,000 debt owed by the Guinean airline to Alaska Airlines. Services from Conakry to Dakar with the Il-18 were inaugurated on 24 August 1962, and the route was later extended to Lagos via Monrovia, Abidjan and Accra. The Il-18 was later replaced by two Douglas DC-4s which were purchased from Alaska Airlines, and the airline also obtained four LASA-60s. By mid-1963 the Air Guinée fleet comprised six Avia-14s, three Ilyushin Il-18s, two Douglas DC-4s, two LASA-60s, one Aero 145, one Mil Mi-14 helicopter, five Yakovlev Yak-18s, three Antonov An-2s and one Yodel. In 1965 Pan American World Airways was contracted to provide technical personnel and a DC-4 for the airlines' use; however, the agreement did not last for long, and the Soviets returned to the airline, supplying an Antonov An-24 for delivery in 1966-1967. In December 1965, the airline temporarily suspended operations as only one route was showing a profit, and the aircraft were suffering frequent breakdowns. On 9 July 1967 one of the airline's Il-18s was written off in an accident at Casablanca. The aircraft was on a scheduled flight to Prague when due to bad weather it was diverted to Casablanca. On landing, its left wing hit a building, causing the aircraft to crash into \\"rough ground\\". There were no fatalities amongst the 102 occupants on board, but the aircraft had to be written off. In the 1970s the fleet was expanded with the addition of one Boeing 707, one Boeing 727-100 and one Boeing 737-200. An Air Guinée Il-18 crashed at Conakry on 3 September 1978, killing 15 of the 17 on board. In 1985 an Airbus A300 was delivered to the airline in order to allow it to commence services to Paris and Brussels. By the early 1990s, Air Guinée operated domestic services from Conakry to Boké, Faranah, Kankan, Kissidougou, Labé, Macenta, Siguiri and Nzérékoré, and international flights to Abidjan, Bamako, Dakar, Freetown, Lagos and Monrovia. By the late 1980s, the airline had cost the country some US$4 million and had no prospects for turning a profit for its shareholder, the Guinean government. The company was privatised in 1992, and was eventually dissolved in 2002.

He was acting president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters from 1967 to 1971, and president from 1971 to 1981. Early life Frank Fitzsimmons was born on April 7, 1908, in Jeannette, Pennsylvania, to Frank and Ida May Fitzsimmons. His father was a brewer who moved the family to Detroit, Michigan, in 1924 when Frank was 16. His father died of a heart attack when Fitzsimmons was 17 years old, and Frank dropped out of high school to support his family by working in an automobile hardware store. In 1932, he got a job as a bus driver in Detroit, Michigan, and New York City before becoming a truck driver in Detroit in 1935. He joined Teamsters Local 299, and became friendly with the local union's president, Jimmy Hoffa. Fitzsimmons was elected Local 299 business manager in 1936, Local 299 vice president in 1940, and (at Hoffa's insistence) an international union vice president of the Teamsters in 1961. He was appointed secretary-treasurer of the 80,000-member Michigan Conference of Teamsters in 1949, and vice president of Teamsters Joint Council 43 in Detroit in 1959. During this time, Fitzsimmons became known as \\"a figure of ridicule\\" in the Teamsters; he was inarticulate, chubby, passive and easily embarrassed, and Hoffa and others frequently had him make coffee or hold chairs and rarely gave him any authority or duties. Nonetheless, Fitzsimmons was considered an adept manager and a very skilled contract negotiator. Despite Hoffa's many legal problems and the routine emasculation, Fitzsimmons remained the Teamsters president's staunchest supporter. Teamsters presidency =Acting president= When Harold J. Gibbons resigned as Hoffa's executive assistant in December 1963 after a failed coup against the indicted Teamsters president, Hoffa appointed Fitzsimmons to the office.Pomfret, John D. \\"Bid to Oust Hoffa Expected in Union.\\" New York Times. December 7, 1963. In 1964, Hoffa was sentenced to an aggregate 13 years in prison for jury tampering, conspiracy, mail and wire fraud. Fitzsimmons was initially not considered to be politically popular enough to succeed Hoffa.Stetson, Damon. \\"Teamsters' Power Struggle to Succeed Hoffa Breaks Into Open.\\" New York Times. November 23, 1965. But Fitzsimmons was elected General Vice President of the Teamsters in July 1966, which to many Teamsters leaders signalled Hoffa's intention to make Fitzsimmons his heir-apparent in the event Hoffa was imprisoned.\\"Board Acts on Succession.\\" New York Times. March 1, 1967; Jones, David R. \\"Successor Choice Named By Hoffa.\\" New York Times.

June 29, 1966; Jones, David R. \\"Hoffa Re-Elected Teamsters' Chief.\\" New York Times. July 8, 1966. On February 28, 1967, the Teamsters executive board passed a resolution appointing Fitzsimmons \\"acting president\\" in the event Hoffa was no longer able to carry out his duties. After failed appeals, Hoffa entered prison in March 1967, and attempted to run the union from jail through Fitzsimmons.Jones, David R. \\"Hoffa Plans Way to Retain Power.\\" New York Times. June 15, 1966. Fitzsimmons, however, was to be nothing more than a glorified gofer: > But there is no certainty that Hoffa intends to let Fitzsimmons run > anything. Indeed, few other Teamster big wigs even pretend that the chunky, > amiable Hoffa right bower has the capacity to hold the union together for > long. \\"He's just a peanut butter sandwich; he'll melt in no time,\\" is the > unflattering comment of one union insider.Raskin, A.H. \\"Hoffa Will Run the > Union From Behind Bars-Maybe.\\" New York Times.

March 9, 1967; Jones, David R. \\"Truck Talks Reported Progressing Despite Absence of Hoffa.\\" New York Times. March 20, 1967. Although the pact expired and the union struck for three days, Fitzsimmons was able to negotiate a new agreement (with a federal mediator's help) which some believed was richer than any Hoffa could have obtained.Jones, David R. \\"Mediator Hails Pact.\\" New York Times. April 12, 1967; Jones, David R. \\"Teamster Leader Sees Pact Backed.\\" New York Times. April 26, 1967. He negotiated a second contract three years later which provided a 27 percent wage increase over three years.Lydon, Christopher. \\"Drivers Approve Teamsters Pact.\\" New York Times. May 19, 1970. Fitzsimmons rapidly solidified his own hold on the Teamsters presidency throughout 1967. He had permitted the International vice presidents greater latitude in their own affairs and delegated significant authority to them, winning their allegiance.Jones, David R. \\"Teamsters Curb One-Man Control.\\" New York Times. May 6, 1967; \\"Head of Teamsters Denies Power Shift.\\" Associated Press. May 8, 1967. He defeated an executive board attempt to oust him in July, and followed it up by demoting a number of Hoffa aides and promoting his own supporters (including Weldon Mathis) to high positions in the union. By August, he had openly declared he would run for the presidency of the union. He further enhanced his popularity by negotiating in October 1967 a national master contract in the trucking industry which brought 40,000 Northeastern truckers into the contract for the first time, and by negotiating a new contract which ended a five-month steel haulers' strike.Jones, David R. \\"Hoffa's Stand-in Is Making Headway.\\" New York Times. October 1, 1967. Fitzsimmons also began taking the union in new directions. In July 1968 he and Walter Reuther, president of the United Auto Workers formed a new national trade union center, the Alliance for Labor Action, to organize unorganized workers and pursue leftist political and social projects.Janson, Donald. \\"U.A.W. and Teamsters Form Alliance.\\" New York Times. July 24, 1968; Stetson, Damon. \\"2 Biggest Unions Set Up Alliance.\\" New York Times. May 27, 1969. Fitzsimmons and Reuther offered the AFL-CIO a no-raid pact as a first step toward building a working relationship between the competing trade union centers, but the offer was rejected.Flint, Jerry M. \\"No-Raiding Pact Offered Meany.\\" New York Times. November 24, 1968. The Alliance's initial program was ambitious,Stetson, Damon. \\"New Labor Group Offers Program.\\" New York Times.

July 6, 1971; Salpuka, Agis. \\"A Labor Alliance to Be Dissolved.\\" New York Times.

June 4, 1971; Salpuka, Agis. \\"Teamsters Elect Fitzsimmons To Succeed Hoffa as President.\\" New York Times. July 9, 1971. By year's end, Fitzsimmons had purged a number of Hoffa supporters from the union's top offices.Salpuka, Agis. \\"Teamster Aide Expects Ouster.\\" New York Times. December 14, 1972. In 1973, he resigned his position as vice president of Local 299 and his son, Richard, was appointed his successor.\\"Job in Local Left By Fitzsimmons.\\" New York Times. August 31, 1973. On July 10, 1975, a Lincoln Continental used by Richard Fitzsimmons was destroyed by a bomb outside a bar where he was having a drink. Fitzsimmons engaged in a notorious jurisdictional and organizing dispute with the United Farm Workers (UFW) from 1972 to 1977, raiding the smaller union and establishing a new national farm workers' union to compete with it. The series of raids and counter-raids, repudiated contracts, and public relations attacks began in December 1972 when Fitzsimmons ordered a 1967 no-raid and organizing non-compete agreement with the UFW dissolved and Teamsters contract negotiators to re-open contracts.According to the Teamsters, these contracts had purposefully low wages and benefits so as not to make the UFW contracts look bad. See: \\"Teamsters End a Truce With Chavez's United Farm Workers.\\" New York Times. December 15, 1972. The UFW sued, the AFL-CIO condemned the action, and many employers negotiated contracts with the Teamsters rather than with the UFW.Turner, Wallace. \\"Teamsters Sued by Chavez's Union.\\" New York Times.

In October 1973, Fitzsimmons ended a long-running jurisdictional dispute with the United Brewery Workers, and the Brewery Workers merged with the Teamsters.\\"Brewery Workers Merger With Teamsters Is Backed.\\" New York Times.

Hoffa had been released from prison on December 23, 1971, when President Richard Nixon commuted his sentence to time served. According to the United States Department of Justice and White House officials, Hoffa's release was granted on the condition that he not participate directly or indirectly in union activities until 1980.Crewdson, John H. \\"Mitchell Is Cited in Hoffa Release.\\" New York Times. May 30, 1974. But Hoffa contended that he had never agreed to any such condition, and unsuccessfully sued to have the restriction overturned.Shabecoff, Philip. \\"Hoffa Denies Bar on Role in Union.\\" New York Times. February 8, 1974; Shabecoff, Philip. \\"Hoffa Sues Nixon for Free Role in Union.\\" New York Times. March 14, 1974; \\"White House Denies Hoffa's Allegations.\\" New York Times. March 15, 1974; Salpuka, Agis. \\"Judge Upholds Conditions Barring Hoffa From Regaining Union Leadership.\\" New York Times. July 20, 1974. But Fitzsimmons supported the government's position, and Charles Colson, special counsel to President Nixon who helped negotiate Hoffa's release, backed Fitzsimmon's interpretation of the release agreement.There is some evidence that Colson's support may have been given because the Teamsters had shifted their legal counsel to Colson's firm, Morin, Dickstein, Shapiro and Galligan, In December 1972 shortly before Colson left government service. See: Rugaber, Walter. \\"Teamsters Union Plans to Shift To Law Firm With Tie to Nixon.\\" New York Times. December 9, 1972; Shabecoff, Philip. \\"Frank Fitzsimmons of Teamsters Dies.\\" New York Times. May 7, 1981. In 1977, convicted murderer and FBI informant Ralph Picardo alleged that Fitzsimmons had secretly funneled $1 million to President Richard Nixon in 1973 to bar Hoffa from seeking election as Teamsters president, but Picardo's claims were widely dismissed. See: Thomas, Jo. \\"Teamster Informant Drawing Skepticism.\\" New York Times. August 3, 1977. Hoffa intended to publish a book accusing Fitzsimmons of \\"selling out to mobsters\\" and giving large low- and no-interest loans from Teamsters pension funds to mob-related businesses.Kihss, Peter. \\"A Book by Hoffa Accuses Fitzsimmons of Mob Link.\\" New York Times. September 12, 1975.Hoffa may also have intended to have Fitzsimmons murdered. Charles Allen, a self-described mob killer, later testified before the U.S. Senate that Hoffa had asked him to kill Fitzsimmons while they served time in prison together, and again in 1975 after Hoffa's release. See: Treaster, Joseph B. \\"Mob Killer Says Hoffa Told Him to Slay Successor.\\" New York Times. June 23, 1982. But Jimmy Hoffa disappeared on July 30, 1975, removing the last significant opposition to Fitzsimmons' re- election.\\"Hoffa Is Reported Missing.\\" New York Times. August 1, 1975; Salpuka, Agis. \\"Hunt for Missing Hoffa Focuses On Figures in Organized Crime.\\" New York Times. August 2, 1975. Fitzsimmons was, for a time, a suspect in the disappearance. Fitzsimmons continued to solidify his hold on the Teamsters throughout 1975 and 1976.Dembart, Lee. \\"Chicago Teamsters Grain in Power Shift.\\" New York Times. January 18, 1976. Fitzsimmons oversaw national trucking negotiations again in 1976, which led to major wage gains. Once again, the contract expired and the Teamsters engaged in a national trucking strike.Salpuka, Agis. \\"Teamster Strike Begins As Talks Falter.\\" New York Times. April 1, 1976. But the strike ended after just three days, and union members ratified a contract which included a cost of living adjustment as well as a 30 percent rise in wages over three years.Salpuka, Agis. \\"Most Teamsters Accept Contract With Truckers.\\" New York Times. April 3, 1976; Salpuka, Agis. \\"Teamsters Agree On New Contract To End Walkout.\\" New York Times. April 4, 1976. =Second presidency= Fitzsimmons was re-elected General President of the Teamsters in Las Vegas, Nevada, on June 16, 1976. An insurgent reform group, which later adopted the name Teamsters for a Democratic Union, issued a massive report accusing Fitzsimmons and other Teamsters of corruption and suppressing democracy in the union and picketed the June Teamsters convention.Raskin, A.H. \\"Teamster Rebels Doubt A Shake-Up.\\" New York Times. May 29, 1976; Dembart, Lee. \\"Teamster Dissidents Picket Convention.\\" New York Times. June 14, 1976. Fitzsimmons attacked the dissidents for trying to \\"destroy the union\\".Dembart, Lee. \\"Teamsters Chief Scores Dissidents.\\" New York Times. June 15, 1976. He famously raged from the podium: > To those who say it's time to reform this organization, that it's time that > the officers quit selling out the membership, I say to them, go to > hell.Serrin, William. \\"No Shift Is Foreseen in Teamsters' Course.\\" New York > Times. May 7, 1981. Delegates to the convention were not persuaded by the attacks on the union leadership: They voted Fitzsimmons a 17 percent pay raise, bringing his salary to $516,250 a year ($ million today) and re-elected him to a second full term.Dembart, Lee. \\"Teamsters Vote Chief A Big Raise.\\" New York Times. June 16, 1976; Dembart, lee. \\"Teamsters' Head Wins Re-Election.\\" New York Times. June 17, 1976. In the late fall of 1976, Fitzsimmons oversaw a 10-week strike at United Parcel Service. The strike, which affected 15 Eastern states and included 18,000 warehouse workers and drivers, ended after the union reached an agreement to give workers a 33 percent wage increase over three years and restrict the employer's ability to replace full-time workers with part-time employees.Stetson, Damon. \\"Tentative Accord Reported in Strike At United Parcel.\\" New York Times. November 13, 1976; Dembart, Lee. \\"Accord Is Announced in Parcel Walkout.\\" New York Times. December 4, 1976. Fitzsimmons was investigated in 1976 for failing to perform his fiduciary duties as a trustee on the Teamsters' Central States Pension Fund, and forced to resign from the board of trustees in 1977. The U.S. Departments of Labor and Justice first began investigating the fund in January 1976.Stetson, Damon. \\"Teamster Funds Under New Audit.\\" New York Times. January 28, 1976. He was subpoenaed by both the U.S. Senate's Committee on Labor and Public Welfare and by the Labor Department, and testified in public and private regarding loans the pension fund made to certain mob-related businesses and the fund's operations.Dembart, Lee. \\"Teamster Chiefs Under Subpoena.\\" New York Times.

Much of his final term as president was spent fighting deregulation of the trucking industry. Deregulation had first been proposed by President Gerald Ford in 1975,Blumenthal, Ralph. \\"Ford Offers Bill on Deregulating Trucks and Buses.\\" New York Times. November 14, 1975. and President Jimmy Carter followed through by seeking and winning passage of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980.\\"Fitzsimmons Assails Bid to Cut Truck Regulations.\\" New York Times.

Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution Press, 1985. One of the last national negotiations Fitzsimmons oversaw was another national trucking contract. With deregulation moving forward, the negotiations (which began in early 1979) were particularly difficult.Shabecoff, Philip. \\"Fitzsimmons Keeps His Hold on the Driver's Seat.\\" New York Times. March 25, 1979. Fitzsimmons gambled and decided to engage in a series of whipsaw strikes in order to pressure the employers to agree to terms, but the trucking companies responded with a lockout on April 2.Shabecoff, Philip. \\"A 'Selective' Strike Is Called By Teamsters as Talks Fail.\\" New York Times. April 1, 1979; Shabecoff, Philip. \\"Trucking Leaders Call for Lockout of 300,000 in Strike by Teamsters.\\" New York Times. April 2, 1979. The Carter administration had imposed wage and price controls which sought to hold collective bargaining wage and benefit increases to 7.5 percent a year, but Fitzsimmons sought 10 percent a year.\\"Issues in Walkout by Teamsters.\\" New York Times. April 2, 1979. Four days into the labor dispute, layoffs in the automobile manufacturing industry reached 100,000, putting significant pressure on Fitzsimmons to lower his contract demands.Stuart, Reginald. \\"Teamster Talks Resume as Auto Industry Layoffs Continue to Climb.\\" New York Times. April 6, 1979. The strike and lockout were a short one due to these pressures, and Fitzsimmons reached an agreement on April 11, 1979, which met the President's wage control guideline.Shabecoff, Philip. \\"White House Endorses Teamsters' Pact as a Gain in Anti-Inflation Effort.\\" New York Times.

Death After suffering shortness of breath at a Teamsters executive board meeting, Fitzsimmons underwent surgery in late December 1979 which removed a non-malignant tumor in his bronchial passage.\\"Fitzsimmons, Teamsters Chief, Is Back on the Job After Surgery.\\" New York Times. January 7, 1980.Serrin, William. \\"Health Rumors On Union Chief Stir Speculation.\\" New York Times. January 11, 1980. In early January 1980, the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner published a story claiming that Fitzsimmons was suffering from abdominal cancer, setting off widespread rumors that Fitzsimmons was dying and that a power struggle over his succession was raging in the Teamsters. Fitzsimmons denied that he had cancer. Nonetheless, by July, Fitzsimmons admitted he had lung cancer and had undergone chemotherapy for the past seven months.\\"Teamsters President to Seek Re- election Despite Cancer.\\" New York Times. July 11, 1980. However, he also declared himself cancer-free and fit to run for re-election in 1981. Fitzsimmons' cancer returned in January 1981, leading to repeated hospitalizations, tests, weight loss, hair loss, and bouts of depression.\\"Fitzsimmons, Ailing, May Quit Union Job.\\" New York Times. April 16, 1981. Although he returned to work in mid-March, he was so ill by early April that many felt he might not attend the union's executive board meeting later that month. Although the deadline for announcing his re-election bid was June 1, anonymous union officials believed he was so ill that he would announce his retirement before the board meeting. Planning began to name Ray Schoessling, the union's 75-year-old secretary-treasurer, interim president. As news of Fitzsimmons' deteriorating health spread, a number of union leaders began to fight to take over the union. Fitzsimmons' illness led to a significant deterioration in labor relations in the trucking industry. Deregulation had led to fierce competition and significantly lower rates in the industry, and a number of trucking companies let it be known that they would not pay the wage and benefit increases Fitzsimmons had negotiated two years before. Before entering the hospital again in late March, Fitzsimmons wrote a letter to the employers demanding that they adhere to the contract. On May 1, 1981, Roy Lee Williams announced his candidacy for the presidency of the Teamsters.\\"Teamster Aide Is Ready To Seek Fitzsimmons Post.\\" United Press International. May 2, 1981. Williams made it clear, however, that if Fitzsimmons' health improved he would back the ailing general president. Williams made his announcement after rumors spread that union officials had visited Fitzsimmons in the hospital in La Jolla, California, and Fitzsimmons had agreed to retire. Fitzsimmons died of lung cancer in San Diego, California, on May 6, 1981. He was survived by his second wife, Mary, and his four children. Four mourners attended his private funeral mass at Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church in Palm Desert, California.\\"Fitzsimmons Rites Held With Few in Attendance.\\" United Press International.

The property is open seven days a week with the mission of engaging the public with the enduring legacy of Madison's most powerful idea: government by the people. Montpelier was declared a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. It was included in the Madison-Barbour Rural Historic District in 1991. In 1983, the last private owner of Montpelier, Marion duPont Scott, bequeathed the estate to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The National Trust for Historic Preservation (NTHP) has owned and operated the estate since 1984. In 2000, The Montpelier Foundation formed with the goal of transforming James Madison's historic estate into a dynamic cultural institution. From 2003–2008 the NTHP carried out a major restoration, in part to return the mansion to its original size of 22 rooms as it was during the years when it was occupied by James and Dolley Madison. Extensive interior and exterior work was done during the restoration. Archeological investigations in the 21st century revealed new information about African-American life at the plantation, and a gift from philanthropist David Rubenstein enabled the National Trust to restore the slave quarters in the South Yard and open a slavery exhibition, The Mere Distinction of Colour, in 2017. History =Madison family= In 1723, James Madison's grandfather, Ambrose Madison, and his brother-in-law, Thomas Chew, received a patent for of land in the Piedmont of Virginia. Ambrose, his wife Frances Madison, and their three children moved to the plantation in 1732, naming it Mount Pleasant. (Archaeologists have located this first site near the Madison Family Cemetery.) Ambrose died six months later; according to court records, he was poisoned by three enslaved Africans. At the time, Ambrose Madison held 29 slaves and close to . After his death, Frances managed the estate with the help of their son, Colonel James Madison, Sr. Madison, Sr., expanded the plantation to include building services and blacksmithing in the 1740s, and bought additional slaves to cultivate tobacco and other crops. He married Nelly Conway Madison (1731–1829) and had 12 children. James Madison, Sr.'s first-born son, also named James, was born on March 16, 1751 at Belle Grove, his mother's family estate in Port Conway, where she had returned for his birth. James Madison spent his early years at Mount Pleasant. In the early 1760s, Madison, Sr., built a new house half a mile away, which structure forms the heart of the main house at Montpelier today. Built around 1764, it has two stories of brick laid in a Flemish bond pattern, and a low, hipped roof with chimney stacks at both ends. His son James Madison later stated that he remembered helping move furniture to the new home. The building of Montpelier represents Phase 1 (1764–1797) of the construction. Upon completion, the Madisons owned one of the largest brick dwellings in Orange County. Phase 2 (1797–1800) of construction began in 1797, after son James returned to Montpelier with his new wife Dolley Madison. He was then 39 and she was a young widow with a child. At this time Madison added a thirty-foot extension and a Tuscan portico to the house. Madison's widowed mother, Nelly, still resided in the house following the death of her husband, James, Sr., in 1801. In the last period of construction, Phase 3 (1809–1812), Madison had a large drawing room added, as well as one-story wings at each end of the house and he directed construction of single-story flat-roofed extensions at either end of the house; these provided space for the separate household of the newlyweds James and Dolley Madison. After his second term as president, in 1817 Madison retired there full-time with his wife Dolley. James Madison died in 1836 and is buried in the family cemetery at Montpelier. His widow Dolley Madison moved back to Washington, D.C., in 1837 after his death. In 1844 she sold the plantation to Henry W. Moncure. After Dolley Madison died in 1849, she was buried in Washington, D.C., and later re-interred at Montpelier near her husband James. After Dolley Madison sold the estate to Henry W. Moncure in 1844, the property was held by a total of six additional owners before the du Ponts bought Montpelier in 1901. The various owners and the dates associated with the site include: Benjamin Thornton (1848–1854), William H. Macfarland (1854–1855), Alfred V. Scott (1855–1857), Thomas J. Carson and Frank Carson (1857–1881), Louis F. Detrick and William L. Bradley (1881–1900) and Charles King Lennig (1900). =The name Montpelier= The origins of the name Montpelier are uncertain, but the first recorded use of the name comes from a 1781 James Madison letter. Madison personally liked the French spelling of the name Montpellier. The city of Montpellier, France, was a famous resort. Clues from letters and visitor descriptions suggest these origins of the plantation's name. =Slavery at Montpelier= The work of Montpelier was done primarily by its about 100 enslaved African slaves during James Madison's tenure as owner. Slaves served in a variety of roles: field workers, domestic servants in charge of cleaning, cooking, and care of clothing; and as artisans for the mill, forge, wheelwright, and other carpentry and woodworking. During the time that the Madisons owned the estate, \\"five, six, and possibly seven generations of African Americans were born into slavery at Montpelier.\\" The most well-known slave from Montpelier was Paul Jennings, Madison's body servant from 1817-1835. When Jennings went to the White House at age 10, he served at table and did other work. Daniel Webster purchased Jennings and allowed him to work to pay off his freedom, but this was unrelated to the death of James or Dolley Madison. Born in 1799, Jennings was purchased from Dolley Madison and freed in 1845 by the northern senator Daniel Webster after Madison's death. Jennings continued to live in Washington, DC, where he worked and became a property owner. In 1848 he helped plan the largest slave escape in United States history, as 77 slaves from the Washington, DC area took to The Pearl, a schooner, intending to sail up the Chesapeake Bay to a free state.\\"Reading 2: Slavery at Montpelier\\", National Park Service LessonsG. Franklin Edwards and Michael R. Winston, \\"Commentary: The Washington of Paul Jennings—White House Slave, Free Man, and Conspirator for Freedom,\\" White House History, I, no.1 (1983): 61 They were captured and most were sold to the Deep South. Jennings was noted for his account of Madison, A Colored Man’s Reminiscences of James Madison (1865), which is considered the first White House memoir. Archaeological research and documentary analysis has revealed much about the life of Montpelier-born slave, Catherine Taylor (ca. 1820 – after 1889). Catherine married Ralph Taylor, a house slave, and had four children with him. When Dolley Madison moved to Washington, D.C. in the years after James Madison's death, Ralph was chosen to accompany her to serve her in the capital. Dolley kept Catherine at Montpelier for several months after she brought Ralph to D.C., and then brought Catherine to D.C. later Dolley Madison transferred (or deeded), most of the enslaved people to her son, John Payne Todd. He stipulated in his will that upon his death, the slaves would be manumitted. However, due to legal and financial complications after Todd's death, the slaves were not manumitted. The Taylors petitioned James C. Maguire, the administrator of the estate, for their freedom. After being officially freed in 1853, they chose to live in Washington, which had a large free black community and opportunities for varied work. The Montpelier staff continues to research the enslaved community by a variety of methods: studying historical documents such as court records and autobiographies, conducting archaeological excavations, contacting current descendants, and document the contributions and sacrifices of the enslaved community. =The duPont family= After some renovations in the later 19th century (c. 1855 and c. 1880), the house was acquired in 1901 by William and Annie Rogers duPont, of the duPont family. A horse enthusiast, William duPont built barns, stables, and other buildings for equestrian use. The duPonts were among several wealthy families in the Upper South who were influential in the development of Thoroughbred horse racing in the United States. The duPont family also added a Hodgson House to the property. These were known as \\"America's First Organized Prefabricated House Manufacturer before Aladdin, Sears, and Montgomery Ward,\\" emphasizing that the homes could technically be built in a day. Still located on Montpelier's property, it is now known as the \\"Bassett House.\\" William and Annie had a daughter, Marion duPont, and a son William duPont, Jr. Upon William duPont, Sr.'s death in 1928, William duPont, Jr. inherited the family's Bellevue estate in Delaware, whereupon he had the estate's mansion converted into a replica of Montpelier (now preserved as a state park), and Marion inherited the Montpelier estate. Marion preserved much of the core of the Madison home, gardens, and grounds as a legacy for all Americans. After her father's death, Marion made only one change to the house; she remodeled her parents' music room in the latest Art Deco style, using modern and innovative materials such as laminated plywood, chrome, glass block, and plate glass mirrors. A weather vane was installed on the ceiling, which allowed wind direction to direct the hounds for fox hunting. An exact replica of the Art Deco room can be seen in the DuPont Gallery, in the Visitors' Center at Montpelier. Prior to her parents moving into the property, they enlarged the house considerably, adding wings that more than doubled the number of rooms to 55. Her parents also had the brick covered with a stucco exterior for a lighter look. Hunt Races In 1934 Marion and her brother William founded the Montpelier Hunt Races, to be held on the grounds. Natural hedges were used as jumps for the steeplechase. The races continue to be held annually, the first Saturday each November. Marion duPont Scott died in 1983 and bequeathed the property to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, with $10 million as an endowment to buy and maintain it. Her father's will had stated that if she died childless, the property would go to her brother William duPont, Jr. and his children. As he had died in 1965, his five children legally inherited the property. In 1984 the heirs of Marion duPont Scott, in accordance with her wishes, transferred ownership of Montpelier to the National Trust for Historic Preservation.Marjorie Hunter (NY Times News Service), \\"James Madison's Montpelier to become museum:, Gainesville Sun, 18 November 1984 National Trust Property Since the National Trust for Historic Preservation took ownership in 1984, the organization has worked to restore Montpelier to the Madison era. It has paid tribute to Marion duPont Scott's influence by retaining one of her favorite rooms in the newly renovated and expanded Visitor's Center, along with the annual Montpelier Hunt Races. In 2000, the National Trust established Montpelier as a co-stewardship property, administered by The Montpelier Foundation. The Robert H. Smith Center for the Constitution provided an Education Center for students and teachers. It sponsors the \\"We the People\\" program to promote the understanding of civics for upper elementary and secondary students, along with national and state programs for teachers, such as the National Advanced Content Seminars, which focuses on historical content and teaching methods. In conjunction with the James Madison University Field School, Montpelier has been the site of annual, seasonal archeological excavations from April to November. Under a four-year collaborative research grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, four quarters have been excavated related to the lives of enslaved African Americans: including the Stable Quarter (2009), South and Kitchen Yards (2011), Tobacco Barn Quarter (2012), and Field Quarter (2013).\\"With Thanks from Montpelier\\", Caroline Godfrey's blog The excavations have revealed early structures in those areas, including possible slave quarters, as well as a variety of artifacts dating to the Madison residency and their slaves. The artifacts are helping researchers form a much broader and deeper picture of the lives of the slaves at Montpelier. \\"The four residential locations provide a unique opportunity to compare and contrast the conditions of chattel slavery of the period. Differences and similarities between these locations – particularly architectural styles and household goods such as ceramics, glassware, and clothing items – reflect the relationship of individual households to each other, the community to which they belong, their relationship to the overarching plantation complex, and regional patterns of both market access and cultural traditions. From 2003–2008 the National Trust carried out a $25 million restoration to return the mansion to its 1820 state; it is again less than half the size of the expanded residence created by the DuPont family. The National Trust is conducting a search for furnishings either original to the property or of its era. =Restoration= Aerial photo of the front of the mansion at James Madison's Montpelier View of the Blue Ridge Mountains from the second floor of the front of James Madison's Montpelier, Orange County, VA. A $25 million restoration project launched in October 2003 was completed on Constitution Day, September 17, 2008. A Restoration Celebration was held with major funding by National Trust Community Investment Corporation. The restoration returned Montpelier to its 1820 appearance: it demolished additions made to the house by the duPont family, removed the stucco exterior to reveal the original brick, restored the original brick exterior, and reconstructed the house's interior as it appeared during Madison's tenure as owner. Authentic materials were used in the restoration, including horsehair plaster, and paint containing linseed oil and chalk. The Collections staff and archaeologists are working to understand the decorations of each room and recreate room settings as closely as possible to what the Madisons knew. A wing in the visitors' center has been dedicated to the duPont family. It includes a restored art deco Red Room from the Marion duPont Scott era, moved from the mansion and permanently installed here. Entrance to the gardens at Montpelier Restored Montpelier train depot is now a civil rights museum =The Mere Distinction of Colour= In 2017, Montpelier added to its existing interpretations of slavery – including the Gilmore Cabin and the Jim Crow–era Train Station, both of which are permanent installations – with the opening of the exhibition, The Mere Distinction of Colour.The Mere Distinction of Colour This exhibition, funded by a donation from philanthropist David Rubenstein, explores the history and legacies of American slavery both at Montpelier and nationwide. The Mere Distinction of Colour spans the cellars of the Madison house, the south cellar exploring the Montpelier slavery story, and the north cellar analyzing the economics and legacies of slavery. The exhibition is the culmination of decades of archaeological and documentary research conducted by Montpelier staff and advisors. One of the unique features of this exhibition is that it was guided by living descendants of the slaves who once inhabited Montpelier and the surrounding area. Montpelier has an active descendant community, some of whom have genealogical proof of their ancestry, and others who are connected through oral histories that have been passed down through generations.

Three particularly draw large crowds: the Montpelier Hunt Races, Wine Festival, and the Fiber Festival. The annual Montpelier Hunt Races, an autumn steeplechase event, were started by Marion duPont Scott and her brother William duPont, Jr. in 1934. The races are held the first Saturday in November. Montpelier has one of the few steeplechase tracks in the country that use traditional hedgerows for jumps. Montpelier hosts seven races at this event. Guests may watch the races directly at the rail for a close experience. The Montpelier Wine Festival showcases distinctive arts and crafts, specialty food vendors, local agricultural products, and Virginia wine from approximately 25 different wineries in the state. The Fall Fiber Festival is held each October and is a popular regional event. The event showcases every aspect of textile manufacturing, from the production of wool to the finished product. Events include sheep shearing, craft demos, and a host of other activities. The most popular feature of the Fall Fiber Festival is the Sheep Dog Trials. Other events include: summer programs for children, such as the \\"Mud Camp,\\" a barbecue held in the summer with local barbecue cuisine, Archaeology Expeditions, civil war demonstrations, and, in December, a candlelight tour of Montpelier in the evening. Montpelier Forest A forest on the property known as the Montpelier Forest (also known as the Landmark Forest) was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service in 1987. The forest was recognized as being one of the best examples of a mature Piedmont forest dominated by tulip poplar and spicebush; various species of oak and hickory are also common in the forest. The relatively undisturbed forest contains several trees up to 300 years old. Ideal growing conditions at the site, including fertile soils, allow for the trees to attain great size; tulip poplars attain heights of up to by the time they reach 50 years of age, and some trees have been measured to have diameters of up to .

He was renowned for speculation in the local pastoral industry as well as industrial activities such as his Ice-Works in Sydney's Darling Harbour and dry dock and engineering works at Balmain. Businessman T S Mort's Statue, Macquarie Place, Sydney photographed about 1900–1910 Mort was born in Bolton, Lancashire, England in 1816. In 1878, he was associated with the Australian Mutual Provident Society. In 1849, he was one of a committee, which funded a company to promote sugar growing at Moreton Bay. In 1850 Mort was a member of the Sydney Exchange Co, and in 1851 he was a director of the Sydney Railway Co. and was also involved in mining (gold, later also copper and coal) and other enterprises. In the 1850s, he opened Mort's Dock in Sydney, a business that was not as successful as he wished. In 1843, he established Mort & Company, in Sydney, and held the first wool auction there,Interpretive signage in the small museum display about the wool industry at the 'Big Merino', Goulburn, N.S.W. (accessed Nov. 2018) which was the beginning the wool auction system. Mort returned to England for a visit in 1857–59. During that visit he bought many furnishings, pictures and other goods, in particular at a sale of the possessions of the Earl of Shrewsbury. He commissioned the architect Edmund Blacket to build a house to add to his house to display the new possessions. His gallery was open to the public. From 1856, Mort began acquiring land near Moruya on the south coast of New South Wales. In 1860, Mort acquired the Bodalla estate near the mouth of the Tuross River. Mort eventually owned in the district, a very substantial holding in that fertile area. Bodalla is alleged to have been originally known as 'Boat Alley'. Mort's vision for Bodalla was as a country estate to retire on and to demonstrate model land utilisation and rural settlement. Mort wished to have a tenanted dairy estate run as an integrated whole. Mort replaced the beef cattle that had been farmed there and carried out extensive improvements including clearing land, draining river swamps, erecting fences, laying out farms, sowing imported grasses, and providing milking sheds, cheese and butter-making equipment. Butter and cheese were produced for the Sydney market. By the 1870s, the tenants were disgruntled sharefarmers and the estate was in Mort's control again run as three farms with hired labour. In 1866, Mort expanded his dry dock into an engineering works. Mort offered shares to his employees and in 1875, the company was incorporated with limited liability having been managed beforehand by a committee that included four leading hands. This was one of the earliest attempts at co-operation between capital and labour in Australia, and although the effort at sharing ownership was only partially successful, Mort always had good relations with his employees. Also in the mid-1860s, Mort had been looking at refrigeration as a way of developing manufacturing orders, to ensure better access to the Sydney market for the butter and cheese he was producing at Bodalla and to offset the vulnerability of being exposed to falling wool prices. Mort financed experiments by Eugene Dominic Nicolle, a French born engineer who had arrived in Sydney in 1853 and registered his first ice-making patent in 1861. In 1861 Mort established at Darling Harbour the first freezing works in the world, which afterwards became the New South Wales Fresh Food and Ice Company. The first trial shipment of frozen meat to London was in 1868. Although their machinery was never used in the frozen meat trade, Mort and Nicolle developed commercially viable systems for domestic trade, although the financial return on that investment was not a great success for Mort. As a part of his refrigeration works, Mort developed a large abattoir at Lithgow where sheep and cattle from western New South Wales were slaughtered and refrigerated for later transport. Mort was a prominent Anglican layman. He donated the land for St Mark's Church, Darling Point, and commissioned Edmund Blacket to design the church. Mort contributed to the upkeep of the church and also to the building of St. Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney and St Paul's College, University of Sydney. He was also the founder of Christ Church School in Pitt Street, Sydney. Death and legacy The unveiling of Mort's statue in Macquarie Place in 1883. Thomas Mort died of pneumonia at Bodalla on 9 May 1878. At the time of his death he was spoken of as \\"the greatest benefactor the working classes in this country ever had\\". Within a week, a meeting of working men in Sydney had resolved to show their esteem; a sculpture in Macquarie Place by Pierce Connolly was unveiled in 1883. Mort is also commemorated by All Saints Church, Bodalla, built in his honour by his family, to a design by Blacket, using granite quarried on Mort's property. The foundation stone was laid in 1880. It was completed in 1901. The church has one of seven small Henry Willis & Sons organs.

The battle took place in the Baengma River (백마강; 白馬江) or Baek River (백강; 白江), which is the lower reach of the Geum River in Jeollabuk-do province, Korea. The Silla-Tang forces won a decisive victory, compelling Yamato Japan to withdraw completely from Korean affairs and crushing the Baekje restoration movement. Background In the first half of the first millennium CE, the Korean Peninsula was divided into three kingdoms – Baekje, Silla, and Goguryeo. Despite sharing similar cultures and using mutually-intelligible languages (while the language of Silla is described in modern-day scholarship as Old Korean, the languages of Baekje and Goguryeo are poorly-attested; although contemporary records suggest that the languages of the three kingdoms were mutually-intelligible, some research suggests that, for instance, Baekje may have used two languages - one related to Silla's Old Korean and another linked to what is called Peninsular Japonic; tradition and some contemporary sources indicate that Baekje and Goguryeo used the same language, as Baekje is said by these sources to have been founded by migrants from Goguryeo), these three kingdoms were rivals, and had engaged each other in wars for dominion over the peninsula for several centuries. In addition to the inter-Korean rivalry, Goguryeo had been engaged in frequent warfare with the Chinese Sui and Tang dynasties. While the three Korean kingdoms were not always military enemies, their alliances frequently shifted; a kingdom would become allies with one of the other two, only to later turn against that kingdom and (sometimes) become allies with the other kingdom against whom it had fought earlier. For example, Silla and Baekje would be allied against Goguryeo (as they were from the late 420s to the early 550s), and later Silla (or Baekje) would betray the other (as happened in 553, when Silla wrested control of the entire Han River basin from Baekje ). By 660, this state of affairs had been going on for some 3–4 centuries. Silla had an ongoing alliance with the Tang dynasty dating roughly to the Tang rise to power in the 620s. The Tang made a series of assaults against Goguryeo, but were never able to conquer it. All the Tang invasions had been from the north attacking south. Tang decided that the best strategy might be to attack Goguryeo from both the northern front and a southern front simultaneously with their ally Silla. However, in order to do so, they (Tang and Silla) had to eliminate Baekje (at the time allied to Goguryeo) and secure a base of operations in southern Korea for a second front. The military campaign against Baekje began in 660. Together, Silla and Tang invaded Baekje and effectively eliminated it when they captured the capital of Sabi, Baekje's last king Uija, and most of the royal family. Soon afterwards, however, the Baekje people revolted and threw off Silla and Tang rule in large areas of northern Baekje. The Baekje general Boksin attempted to take back the 40 lost counties still under Silla-Tang control. He also recalled Prince Buyeo Pung from Japan (a number of members of the Baekje royal family resided in Japan as guests of the Japanese state), sent 100 Tang prisoners to the Yamato court, and requested military aid. General Boksin proclaimed Prince Buyeo Pung as the new king of Baekje. Although the restoration forces had some initial success against Tang and Silla troops, by 662, they were in serious trouble, and their area of control was confined to the fortress of Churyu and its immediate vicinity. As their situation went from bad to worse, Buyeo Pung had Boksin killed for fear of insurrection. Baekje and Yamato Japan had been long-standing allies by this time, and their royal houses were related.http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/IntSP_2_JapaneseSP.pdf The fall of Baekje in 660 came as a terrible shock to the Yamato royal court. Empress Saimei said: > \\"We learn that in ancient times there have been cases of troops being asked > for and assistance requested: to render help in emergencies, and to restore > that which has been interrupted, is a manifestation of ordinary principles > of right. The Land of Baekje, in its extremity, has come to us and placed > itself in our hands. Our resolution in this matter is unshakable. We will > give separate orders to our generals to advance at the same time by a > hundred routes.\\" Crown Prince Naka no Ōe, later to become Emperor Tenji, and Empress Saimei decided to dispatch an expeditionary force led by Abe no Hirafu (阿倍比羅夫) to help the besieged Baekje restoration forces. The troops were largely local strongmen (kuni no miyatsuko) drawn from mostly western Honshū, Shikoku, and especially Kyūshū, although some warriors were also from Kantō and northeastern Japan. Empress Saimei moved the capital to the Asakura temporary palace near the shipyards in northern Kyūshū to personally oversee the military campaign. As the main fleet set sail, the Man'yōshū records Empress Saimei composing a tanka:Kudō Rikio, Ōtani Masao, Satake Akihiro, Yamada Hideo, Yamazaki Yoshiyuki, ed. SNKBT: Man'yōshū, 4 vols.

The Empress died in Tsukushi shortly after the last waves of Yamato troops departed for Korea. The Crown Prince (Tenji) carried her remains back to Asuka. Tenji, dressed in white mourning clothes, set up his residence in the Nagatsu temporary palace in Kyūshū, and continued to oversee the expeditionary operation. Around August 661, 5,000 soldiers, 170 ships, and the general Abe no Hirafu all arrived in territory controlled by the Baekje restoration forces. Additional Japanese reinforcements, including 27,000 soldiers led by Kamitsukeno no Kimi Wakako (上毛野君稚子) and 10,000 soldiers led by Iohara no Kimi (廬原君), arrived in 662. The battle In 663, Baekje restoration forces and the Yamato navy convened in southern Baekje with the intent to relieve the capital of the Baekje restoration movement in Churyu, which was under siege by Silla forces. The Yamato navy was to ferry ground troops to Churyu via the Geum River and lift the siege. However, Tang also sent 7,000 soldiers and 170 ships to blockade Yamato reinforcements from relieving the capital. On 4 October 663, the advance guard of the Japanese fleet tried to force their way, but Tang ships held firm, repelling the attacks and maintaining disciplined ranks. On 5 October 663, the second day of the battle, the arrival of Japanese reinforcements made their forces several times larger than the Tang fleet arrayed against them. However, the river was narrow enough where the Tang fleet could cover their front and protect their flanks as long as they maintained their ordered battle lines. The Japanese were confident in their numerical superiority and attacked the Tang fleet at least three times throughout the entire day, but the Tang fought off each attack. Towards the end of the day, the Japanese became exhausted, and their fleet lost cohesion through their repeated attempts to break through Tang lines. Sensing the right moment, the Tang fleet moved reserves and counterattacked, breaking both the left and right flanks of the Japanese, enveloping their fleet and crowding in the ships so they could not move or retreat. Many Japanese fell into the water and drowned, and many of their ships were burned and sunk. The Yamato general Echi no Takutsu was killed after striking down more than a dozen men in close quarters combat. Japanese, Korean, and Chinese sources all point to heavy Japanese casualties. According to the Nihon Shoki, 400 Japanese ships were lost in the battle. Chinese sources claim 10,000 Japanese deaths. Silla participation in the battle involved cavalry forces that defeated Baekje restoration ground troops which were supporting the Yamato navy on the banks of the river. It is not clear whether or not this took place before or during the time that the Japanese navy went to battle the Tang ships. On 13 October 663, without Yamato troops to lift the siege, the fortress of Churyu surrendered to Silla and Tang forces. Buyeo Pung took a boat and fled with several followers to Goguryeo. Aftermath The Battle of Baekgang was Japan's greatest defeat in its premodern history. Japan's losses were enormous. Japan also lost a key ally on the East Asian continent in Baekje as well as a direct link to continental technology and culture. Due to the scale and severity of their defeat, the Yamato court feared an invasion from either or both Tang or Silla. In response, they built a huge network of shore fortifications throughout the rest of the 600s. In 664, the Yamato court established frontier guards and signal fires in Tsushima Island, Iki Island, and northern Kyushu. Also, embankments storing water were built around the fortresses in Kyushu, which were collectively called the Water Fortress. In 665, the Yamato court sent Baekje generals and artisans to construct a rampart in Nagato province, and two ramparts in Kyūshū. In 667, a rampart was constructed in the Yamato region, another one at Sanuki, and yet another at Tsushima island. Unaware of the outbreak of the Silla-Tang War (670-676), the Japanese would continue to build fortifications until 701, after finding out that Silla was no longer friendly with Tang. For Baekje, the battle was the knockout blow that ended any hope of reviving the kingdom. Many Baekje people fled to either Goguryeo or Japan. Baekje royalty who fled to Japan were given the same ranks and titles in the Yamato court and non-royal Baekje refugees were given de facto citizenship status or special artisan status. The victory gave Tang control of all former Baekje lands in Korea and a secure base in southwest Korea to launch a two-pronged invasion of Goguryeo with their ally Silla. The Silla–Tang alliance first launched attacks on Goguryeo from the south in 661, and the Goguryeo capital at Pyongyang finally fell in 668. In the same year, Tang established the Protectorate General to Pacify the East to control the Korean Peninsula. Retrospective issues The battle introduces interesting questions regarding Japan's relations with the Korean states and their level of development at the time. For example, why did the Japanese fare so badly against the Tang army? According to several scholars, it is clear that, in the 7th century at least, the Chinese had better weapons and, more importantly, their troops and officers were better trained and disciplined. Despite years of reforms modeled after mainland examples from China, the Yamato armies did not adopt the organized infantry tactics of Chinese armies. Furthermore, Yamato Japan was still a nascent and developing state run in practice by local strongmen (although in theory by the royal court) and without any real form of unified command. In addition, Japanese soldiers were drawn from many corners by local \\"strongmen\\" that controlled their own territories (in an early form of feudalism). Among the Japanese, any standardization in either weapons or unit tactics is believed to have been minimal at best. Many scholars have also puzzled over why Yamato went through so much effort to protect Baekje. Bruce Batten summarized: > \\"Why the Japanese should have thrown themselves with such vigor into a war > that, if not quite an intramural Korean conflict, had at least no direct > bearing on Japanese territory, is not easy to answer.\\" The battle, as well as all the preparation behind it, clearly illustrates (aside from any other documentation) the strong ties between Yamato Japan and Baekje of Korea transcending the usual interstate military, political, or economic interests. The linguist J. Marshall Unger suggests, based on linguistic evidence, that Baekje could represent a remnant proto-Japanese or para-Japanese community, which had stayed behind on the Korean peninsula after the Yayoi migrations, but still maintained a conscious connection to the Yayoi people and their descendants.The Role of Contact in the Origins of the Japanese and Korean Languages, University of Hawai'i Press, 2009 In any case, the phenomenon of elite refugees fleeing political conflict on the peninsula and settling in Yamato had been recurring in waves since at least the 5th century.Herman Ooms, Imperial Politics and Symbolics in Ancient Japan, University of Hawai'i Press, 2009 See also * Naval history of Korea * Naval history of China * Naval history of Japan * Largest naval battle in history Notes References Bibliography * Aston, W.

The group signed with the Avex Group Holdings Inc. sub-record label Maximum10 and their distributing label Avex Music Creative Inc.; they signed a deal with London label JPU Records for European distributions. After a series of buzz singles between 2013 and 2014, FEMM released their debut studio album Femm- Isation in October 2014 as a digital release. FEMM's major debut and first physical release, Pow!/L.C.S., was released in February 2016. FEMM are a music project that portrays \\"real-life mannequins\\", whilst RiRi and LuLa are recognized as the leaders of the FEMM Agency Syndicate, an agency that supports the independence and rights of mannequins (hypothetically their fan base). RiRi is managed by agent Honey-B, and LuLa is managed by agent W-Trouble. Honey-B and W-Trouble communicate on RiRi and LuLa's behalf because mannequins cannot talk. Despite the group's lack of charting success, FEMM have received prospects from several Western social media websites and journalists alike. The group have been widely commended for their fashion style and their commercial appeal, alongside the accompanying songs they have recorded. FEMM have been cited as the world's \\"first mannequin duo\\", and have been highlighted by publications including The Huffington Post and Perez Hilton online as future prospects for mainstream music. Career = 2013–early 2014: Formation and early work = FEMM consists of RiRi and LuLa. Little is known about FEMM's formation or meeting prior to being signed; in an interview on February 24, 2016, W-Trouble stated that her and Honey-B \\"met at FEMM's Agency Syndicate. Details are top secret.\\" In October 2013, the group launched a YouTube channel and uploaded a teaser video; The video shows RiRi and LuLa walking around the streets of Japan, talking about their quest of rescuing mannequins. This teaser was used to launch FEMM's website, which uses interactive elements to communicate with their fanbase. FEMM signed with the Avex Group Holdings Inc. sub-record label Maximum10 and their distributing label Avex Music Creative Inc. In February 2014, FEMM premiered two music videos; \\"UFO\\" and \\"Astroboy\\" on their YouTube channel; the former track is a cover song originally recorded in 1977 by Japanese pop duo Pink Lady, whilst the latter track featured guest vocals from FEMM's agents, Honey-B and W-Trouble. Despite the initial lack of popularity, FEMM included both songs in the group's debut extended play (EP) Astroboy on April 2, 2014. \\"Astroboy\\" was recognized by Western critics as FEMM's first original song by the group. The videos were directed by creative unit IKIOI, who had previously worked with other Japanese artists at the time. = Mid-2014–2015: Femm-Isation, international recognition, and further promotion = On April 12, 2014, FEMM released their debut single, \\"Wannabe\\", from their then-upcoming studio album. This marked their first single handled by Western producers and composers; \\"Wannabe\\" was produced by Australian production team Dreamlab, and Avex Music Creative Inc. hired several more Western producers for the album. The second, third, and fourth singles from the album; \\"Kiss the Rain\\", \\"White Noise\\", and \\"We Flood the Night\\" were released on April 30, May 7 and 14 that same year. Avex Music Creative Inc. had hired European producers, such as Swedish producer Andreas Carlsson and Danish production team GL Music. At the end of May, FEMM released their fifth single \\"Kill the DJ\\" alongside an accompanying music video on their YouTube channel. The music video, alongside the recording, was the beginning of FEMM's international recognition and received a large amount of favourable feedback, praising the concept, its convenient use of cosplay and otaku culture, and choreography. In June 2014, FEMM premiered their sixth single \\"Fxxk Boyz Get Money\\" onto YouTube, and released it a month later on July 30 through iTunes Store. The song was critically acclaimed from many music critics, many whom praised the song's commercial nature and lyrical message. An accompanying music video was shot for the single; its features FEMM singing and twerking in an overlapped lyric video. The video received a large amount of favourable feedback, and attracted large attention from several online figures including American blogger and journalist Perez Hilton, American YouTube star Miles Jai, among others. Due to its increasing popularity, the song was featured on the Twerk' em All compilation in July that same year, and gained more international fans from all over the world. In November 2015, \\"Fxxk Boyz Get Money\\" surpassed one million views on YouTube; this marks FEMM's highest viewed and first video to reach the one million mark. In mid-July 2014, the duo performed at Tokyo in Tulsa, an anime convention in Oklahoma, which was their first performance in North America. After the success and increasing popularity of \\"Kill the DJ\\" and \\"Fxxk Boyz Get Money\\", Avex Music Creative Inc. continued to hire several producers and composers from different European, Oceanic and North American regions. FEMM collaborated with American producer's and songwriter's Dan Book and Alexei Misoul on \\"Party All Night\\", the seventh single from their then- upcoming studio album. FEMM released their eighth single \\"Dead Wrong\\" on August 27 through iTunes Store. The single was produced by New Zealand-born Australian musician Leah Haywood, and accompanying producers Daniel James and Kevin Ross. \\"Unbreakable\\" served as FEMM's ninth single from the then-upcoming studio album, and was singled out as the only ballad by Honey-B and W-Trouble; the latter agent highlighted it as LuLa's favourite single. FEMM released their final single from the album, entitled \\"Whiplash\\". FEMM announced the release of their debut studio album, Femm-Isation, and was released on October 3 that same year. Despite the lack of success in their native Japan, Femm- Isation reached the top ten on the US Billboard World Albums chart; this marks FEMM's first charting release to date. The instrumental version of the album was released on December 24 through iTunes Store. FEMM promoted the album and its accompanying singles with performances at small clubs or other public events in Japan. FEMM were part of a one-night only show for the Japanese leg tour of Dutch recording artist and songwriter Eva Simons, and FEMM performed all the album tracks on their Femm-Isation Vol.3 concert the following day; this gig was hosted at Hatsudai Tamai Hospital. FEMM performed alongside electronic musicians Afrojack, Alesso, Fedde Le Grand, Kaskade, and Martin Garrix amongst others at the annual Ultra Music Festival in Tokyo; this was FEMM's first musical performance at a live festival tour. FEMM performed at the Versace after party in Tokyo, and performed on several other concert gigs until December 2014. In August 2015, FEMM returned to the U.S. to perform at Rage, a gay bar and dance club in West Hollywood, California. In the same weekend, they were headline acts at the J-Pop Summit in San Francisco along with other Japanese music acts such as Eir Aoi, JAM Project, and Gacharic Spin, amongst others. The group's final performance promoting material from Femm-Isation was for the 2015 YouTube FanFest Japan, where YouTube personalities and artists gathered together for a live streaming event. The duo introduced their new song, \\"PoW!\\", which was a returning track from their live performances. FEMM also released a collaboration music video with Japanese girl group FAKY with a Japanese cover of Sak Noel's \\"No Boyfriend\\" on the producer's YouTube channel on November 27, 2015. = 2016: Pow!/L.C.S. and other ventures = In early December 2015, FEMM confirmed in a press release through Avex Group Inc. that they would release their debut physical album, which was revealed to be entitled Pow!/L.C.S.. FEMM confirmed the EP would include two new tracks; the studio version of \\"Pow!\\", and \\"L.C.S.\\", alongside old remixes of their previous singles; they commented that they would add new re-edited versions of different tracks that didn't appear on their debut studio. In late January 2016, FEMM announced through a press release with Avex Group Inc. that they would release a double album in late February 2016 that included a physical copy of Femm-Isation. Regarding the material, FEMM agent Honey-B stated \\"The original order of the songs was already carefully mapped out, but this time round we got to put in segues in between songs which made a big difference. The songs flow so smoothly, it will seem like it all happens in a split second and like you have travelled in time.\\" On February 3, Pow!/L.C.S. was released digitally through iTunes Stores and served a physical released on February 23. The music videos to \\"Pow!\\" and \\"L.C.S.\\" premiered on FEMM's YouTube channel in January and February 2016. On April 27, 2016, they re-released YouTube videos of \\"White Noise\\" and \\"Whiplash\\" with minor changes to lyrics and new camera angles. On the same day, FEMM, FAKY and Yup'in were confirmed to be in a new Avex project group called \\"FAMM'IN\\" and released their first digital EP, FAMM'IN and music video of their title song, \\"Circle\\" on YouTube. Artistry =Musical style and themes= FEMM's music has been described by several music critics and scholars as electronic dance music (EDM), with a variety of sub-elements including hip-hop, electronica, eurodance, and house music. According to Mike Kanert from Metropolis Magazine, he felt FEMM's music moved towards Americanized music, including hip-hop and club culture. A staff member from Arcadey.net commented that \\"FEMM's music mostly consists of regurgitated American EDM, dance-pop, and hip-hop, all of which is just as enjoyable as it is generic. I'm guessing it's supposed to be some kind of meta commentary on mainstream music and manufactured pop stars or something...\\". FEMM's debut studio album Femm-Isation shows several elements of electronic dance music; Greg Hignight from J-Generation.com reviewed the album and noted they album's ability to use J-Pop music and English language to convey messages to the Western audience; \\"Each song is its own little pop universe. The album's English lyrics also allow for an instant emotional connection with listeners, circumventing the language barrier that's often been a challenge for J-Pop.\\" For FEMM's 2014 pop ballad \\"Unbreakable\\", the entire production relied on live orchestral instruments and was considered a \\"versatile\\" move by both fans and critics; According to W-Trouble, the song \\"relies on human feelings rather than of a mannequin.\\" W-Trouble commented \\"Unbreakable' is probably the song that expresses those feelings the most. The other songs are pretty rigid so I think they're closer to the image of mannequins.\\" The song writing to FEMM's music material explore themes of girl power, feminism, and freedom of speech; two examples are the tracks \\"Fxxk Boyz Get Money\\" and \\"Girls Night Out\\", which lyrically discusses female empowerment and not relying on male labor or assistance. Honey-B commented to an interviewer at Arama! Japan by stating, \\"We leave it to the listeners to decide about the message or feel of this track, but as for FEMM, they're singing about \\"girl power\\". It's okay to be sexy, just don't let them take advantage of you. \\"Fxxk Boyz Get Money\\" has very aggressive lyrics, but lots of women seem to relate to it. They call it their life anthem.\\" For their first extended play Astroboy, both agents did not yet have any professional experience in singing. Honey-B and W-Trouble stated that the first time recording and appearing in a music video was challenging as they are not usually the ones in front of the camera. FEMM expressed that they would be honored to collaborate with any producers and songwriters who understand their message. Molly Osberg from Vice noted that FEMM combined Japanese fashion and music together. She commented \\"At least, that's how I imagine we get acts like FEMM, the mesmerizing J-pop electro duo with a backstory more inventive than anything on the SyFy channel right now.\\" Osberg praised the producers and songwriters for being hidden pioneers in order to popularize the group, as she felt producers now were more \\"the frontmen\\". Corynn Smith from MTV Iggy was impressed by their English language skills and commented \\"The pair's overwhelmingly English discography has something for everyone with electronic taste, whether you're feeling like a romantic trance trip a la \\"We Flood the Night\\", craving a techno remix of '70s J-pop hit \\"UFO\\", or in a twerk-tastic, rubber-maid-outfit-clad \\"Fxxk Boyz Get Money\\" kinda mood.\\" =Image= FEMM portray themselves as two plastic dolls, known as mannequins (pictured at the J-Pop Summit in 2015). There are two roles that play out through the FEMM project; the mannequins and the agents. According to Honey-B, RiRi is a \\"combat\\" mannequin that wears \\"rather aggressive designs\\". According to W-Trouble, LuLa is described as a \\"babyfaced... housekeeper\\" that wears more \\"reserved\\" and \\"softer\\" designs of clothing. In a \\"fictional\\" description of the mannequins, Honey-B stated; \\"RiRi uses her combat skills to fight the anti-mannequins. She is really aggressive and takes on any challenge. She feels most comfortable in her military gear. LuLa's responsibility is to heal wounded mannequins, including RiRi. They depend on one another.\\" Honey-B and W-Trouble are the \\"voices\\" of RiRi and LuLa, as the mannequins are portrayed with the inability to talk or vocally communicate. Honey-B stated, \\"For the musical nuances, it's listening that's important: the key is to match the sound and flow. If the nuance reveals a kind of attitude, it's partly due to the songwriting and partly due to [Honey-B]. According to FEMM, their tagline \\"Do Dolls Have Feelings? Do Their Songs Move People?\\" represents their virtual goal is to free all mannequins from human oppression. FEMM's fan base are also recognized as agents and although they are categorized by their attributes, such as: military, pilot, medical, maid, spies, RiRi and LuLa are exclusive- attribute and exclusive-rank FEMM without any of the attributes and that is indicated in their serial numbers 000000. While performing and in public areas, FEMM stay in character and move with robot-like actions; they are sometimes carried on and off stage by staff members to underline mannequin characteristics. FEMM's live performances and music videos are choreographed by Japanese choreographing team Hidali, whilst many of the latex outfits are made by Shoichiro Matsuoka of GM Atelier. =Recognition= Several critics have commended the group for their diverse imagery and fashion style. A couple music critics from Singles Jukebox noted that FEMM were more widely noticed by Western audiences than the audience from Japan or J-pop culture. Kimi Li from What's a Greek blog compared the Japanese music towards Western culture, and stated \\"Japan's music industry has been seen to largely play catch up with the rest of the world. Major labels are slow to embrace streaming services. Japan's iTunes store is a wealth of anison, electro and pop but only a small fraction of that is available globally.\\" Li found that although Korean pop music \\"catapulted\\" into Western culture, Li stated that FEMM were one of very few Japanese acts to emphasize an Americanized appeal. The group have found success through Western publications and have been listed in their top acts list; In October 2014, MTV Iggy listed FEMM as their \\"Artist to Watch\\" from a public vote. Colin McQuistan from The Huffington Post listed FEMM as one of their top six acts of 2016; McQuistan stated \\"I'm talking about FEMM, a deceptively slick production from Japan featuring two very real humans Honey-B and W-Trouble (sigh) who claim to 'stand up for the rights of mannequins worldwide' (double sigh). But who cares what their shtick is; the music is super commercial, catchy and very cleverly written pop.\\" Activism In 2015, FEMM uploaded videos to their YouTube channel of them and female back-up dancers performing \\"Fxxk Boyz Get Money\\" and \\"Anaconda\\" by Trinidian-American recording artist and rapper Nicki Minaj in a Tokyo bath house. The short videos were in support of the \\"Dance is Not a Crime\\" campaign that were hosted by FEMM, which was in protest of Japan's legislation where night clubs would be closed at midnight and prohibited \\"no dancing\\" signs at several clubs and areas. The Businesses Affecting Public Morals Regulation Act, which was introduced in 1948, prohibited people to dance within 66 metres from night clubs after a certain cut-off time, despite public retaliation; law and police department enforcements increased by 2011. FEMM protested the law throughout 2015, using hashtags on several social media websites and through music videos; the video was advertised by Japanese record label Dimension Point, which is owned and foundered by Japanese recording artist Namie Amuro and included \\"Fxxk Boyz Get Money\\" on their compilation album. Vice.com confirmed that the law will be lifted during 2016.  Discography  Studio albums * Femm-Isation (2014) * 80's/90's J-Pop Revival (2017) Extended plays * Astroboy (2014) * Pow!/L.C.S.

The actual resolution of forces will depend upon the design. If no horizontal thrusting forces are generated this becomes an arch-shaped truss, essentially a bent beam – see moon bridge for an example. If horizontal thrust is generated but the apex of the arch is a pin joint, this is termed a three- hinged arch. If no hinge exists at the apex, it will normally be a two-hinged arch. In the Iron Bridge shown below, the structure of each frame emulates the kind of structure that previously had been made of wood. Such a wood structure uses closely fitted beams pinned together, so the members within the frames are not free to move relative to one another, as they are in a pin-jointed truss structure that allows rotation at the pin joint. Such rigid structures (which impose bending stresses upon the elements) were further developed in the 20th century as the Vierendeel truss.

Modern town  It has 21,000 inhabitants (2003). It is situated at 844 m above sea level, in the Hoya de Baza, a valley of the Sierra Nevada, not far from the Gallego River. This town gives its name to the Sierra de Baza. The dome- shaped mountain of Jabalcón overlooks the town from the north-west. The Municipality lies at the southern edge of the Altiplano de Granada  History  Town Hall of Baza The sculpture of the Lady of Baza is a prehistoric artifact discovered in this area on 22 July 1971. The city was founded by the Iberians in the 4th century BC and named Basti, the name by which it was known in Roman times. As part of the Roman province of Tarraco, it was an important commercial center and an early bishopric (see below). Under the Moors, Baza was an important frontier post along the border with the kingdom of Murcia. It was also a major commercial center, with a population upward of 50,000, making it one of the three most important cities in the Kingdom of Granada. Under Islamic rule (713 – 1489), the cathedral, founded by the Visigoth king Reccared in about 600, and whose traditional site is occupied by the ancient church of San Máximo, was converted into a mosque and the bishopric was doomed. In 1489, during the Granada War, the city fell to Queen Isabella I of Castile, after a stubborn defense lasting seven months. The cannons still adorn the Alameda. On 10 August 1810, French forces under Marshal Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult defeated a large Spanish force near the town.  Ecclesiastical history  The bishopric of Basti was in existence by 306, the date of the Council of Elvira, which was attended by its bishop Eutychianus. The names of other bishops of Basti also are known through their participation in various Councils of Toledo. The cathedral was founded by the Visigoth king Reccared in about 600; its traditional site is occupied by the ancient church of San Máximo. The diocese survived for some time the Moorish conquest but was suppressed in the 8th century, perhaps with errant bishops, while under Islamic rule (713 – 1489), the cathedral was converted into a mosque and the bishopric disappeared in the 13th century, but was restored in 1306. After the Reconquista, the territories of the two historical sees of Basti and Ancient Acci were united on 21 May 1492 as the modern Diocese of Guadix, a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Granada. A collegiate church, the Colegiata de Nuestra Señora Santa María de la Encarnación, Baza, was established at Basti/Baza. This was reluctant to accept rule from Guadix. As a compromise, the collegiate church was given authority, under the bishop, over twelve parishes, and the bishopric adopted a second name, diocese of Guadix-Baza, indicating a union of two dioceses under a single bishop. This continued until 1851, when the collegiate church became a simple parish church and the diocese resumed the name of Diocese of Guadix.Bibliothèque sacrée, ou Dictionnaire universel, t.

The specific epithet borealis means \\"of the north,\\" which alludes to the fact that the species tends to thrive in the boreal forests of eastern Canada and northeastern United States. Clintonia borealis is commonly known as bluebead, bluebead lily, or yellow clintonia. The term \\"bluebead\\" refers to the plant's small blue spherical fruit, perhaps its most striking feature. However, the term can be misleading since all but one of the species in genus Clintonia have blue fruits (notably, the fruit of C. umbellulata is black). Thus yellow clintonia is probably a better name for C. borealis since the adjective refers to the color of the plant's flower, an unique character among Clintonia species. Compound names such as yellow bead lily or yellow bluebead lily are also in use. Other less common names include corn lily, poisonberry, or snakeberry. Some authors refer to C. borealis as Clinton’s lily but that name may be more appropriate for the genus as a whole. Description Clintonia borealis is a small (5–10 in) perennial plant, usually found in homogeneous colonies. At full growth, a shoot has 2–4 clasping and curved, slightly succulent leaves with parallel venation. The flowers are arranged in small umbels at the extremity of a long stalk. They have 6 stamens and 6 yellow tepals (i.e. very similar sepals and petals). In rare cases more than one umbel is found on a shoot or shoots from a clone. The fruits are small dark blue, lurid berries, which are semi-poisonous. A white-berried form (f. albicarpa) also exists.Ker Gawler, John Bellenden. (1811).

The latter was first described by Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1832. The species C. borealis was previously classified within the genus Convallaria. Distribution Clintonia borealis is a wide-ranging species in eastern North America, from Newfoundland and Labrador across New England into the Great Lakes region west to Manitoba and Minnesota. Its range extends southward into the Appalachian Mountains where it is allopatric with C. umbellulata, that is, the ranges of the two species do not significantly overlap but are immediately adjacent to one another. In the Appalachians, C. umbellulata prefers hardwood forests less than while C. borealis populates coniferous or mixed forests up to . C. borealis is globally secure but threatened in Maryland and Tennessee. It is an endangered species in Ohio and Indiana. Ecolgy Clintonia borealis is not found in open spaces, only growing in the shade. It is extremely slow to spread, but established clones can usually survive many later modifications, as long as sunlight remains limited. Whereas crossed pollination is more efficient in producing seeds, self-pollination will still produce seeds, allowing the plant to propagate. Like other slow-growing forest plants, such as Trillium species, Clintonia is extremely sensitive to grazing by white- tailed deer. =Cultivation= Culture is difficult, due to the need to avoid direct sunlight and the difficulty posed by germination. Transplanting is not recommended. Usage =Medicine= The rhizome contains diosgenin, a saponin steroid with estrogenic effects. =Food= The young leaves of the plant are edible while still only a few inches tall. The fruit however, is mildly toxic, and is quite unpleasant tasting. Folklore Hunters in North Quebec were said to have rubbed their traps with the roots because bears are attracted to its odor. According to a Mi'kmaq tale, when a grass snake eats a poisonous toad, it slithers in rapid circles around a shoot of the bluebead lily to transfer the poison to the plant.

Fasciation may also cause plant parts to increase in weight and volume in some instances. The phenomenon may occur in the stem, root, fruit, or flower head. Some plants are grown and prized aesthetically for their development of fasciation. Any occurrence of fasciation has several possible causes, including hormonal, genetic, bacterial, fungal, viral and environmental causes. Causation Fasciation can be caused by hormonal imbalances in the meristematic cells of plants, which are cells where growth can occur.Galun, Esra (2007). Plant Patterning: Structural and Molecular Genetic Aspects. World Scientific Publishing Company. p. 333. Fasciation can also be caused by random genetic mutation. Bacterial and viral infections can also cause fasciation. The bacterial phytopathogen Rhodococcus fascians has been demonstrated as one cause of fasciation, such as in sweet pea (Lathyrus odoratus) plants, but many fasciated plants have tested negative for the bacteria in studies, hence bacterial infection is not an exclusive causation. Additional environmental factors that can cause fasciation include fungi, mite or insect attack and exposure to chemicals. General damage to a plant's growing tip and exposure to cold and frost can also cause fasciation. Some plants, such as peas and cockscomb Celosia, may inherit the trait. Fasciation is not contagious, but bacteria that cause fasciation can be spread from infected plants to others from contact with wounds on infected plants and from water that carries the bacteria to other plants. Occurrence Although fasciation is rare overall, it has been observed in over 100 vascular plant families, including members of the genera Acer, Aloe, Acanthosicyos, Cannabis, Celosia, Cycas, Delphinium, Digitalis, Echinacea, Euphorbia, Forsythia, Glycine max (specifically, soybean plants), Primula, Prunus, Salix and many genera of the cactus family, Cactaceae. Cresting results in undulating folds instead of the typical \\"arms\\" found on mature saguaro cactus. Some varieties of Celosia are raised especially for their dependably fasciated flower heads, for which they are called \\"cockscomb\\". The Japanese fantail willow (Salix sachalinensis 'Sekka') is another plant that is valued for its fasciations. Prevention Fasciation that is caused by damage to genetic material and by bacteria can be controlled by not using fasciated plants and disposing of fasciated plants. Avoiding injury to plant bases and keeping them dry can reduce the spread of bacteria. Avoidance of grafting fasciated plants and the pruning of fasciated matter can also reduce the spread of bacteria.

The phrase was not associated with a \\"school\\" of singing until the middle of the 19th century, when writers in the early 1860s used it nostalgically to describe a manner of singing that had begun to wane around 1830.Toft, Bel Canto: A Performer's Guide, pp. 3–4 Nonetheless, \\"neither musical nor general dictionaries saw fit to attempt [a] definition [of bel canto] until after 1900\\". The term remains vague and ambiguous in the 21st century and is often used to evoke a lost singing tradition.  History of the term and its various definitions  The bel canto–era composer Gioachino Rossini: portrait painted circa 1815 by Vincenzo Camuccini As generally understood today, the term bel canto refers to the Italian-originated vocal style that prevailed throughout most of Europe during the 18th century and early 19th centuries. Late 19th- and 20th-century sources \\"would lead us to believe that bel canto was restricted to beauty and evenness of tone, legato phrasing, and skill in executing highly florid passages, but contemporary documents [those of the late 18th and early 19th centuries] describe a multifaceted manner of performance far beyond these confines.\\"Toft, Bel Canto: A Performer's Guide, 2013, p. 4 The main features of the bel canto style were: * prosodic singing (use of accent and emphasis) * matching register and tonal quality of the voice to the emotional content of the words * a highly articulated manner of phrasing based on the insertion of grammatical and rhetorical pauses * a delivery varied by several types of legato and staccato * a liberal application of more than one type of portamento * messa di voce as the principal source of expression (Domenico Corri called it the \\"soul of music\\" – The Singer's Preceptor, 1810, vol. 1, p. 14) * frequent alteration of tempo through rhythmic rubato and the quickening and slowing of the overall time * the introduction of a wide variety of graces and divisions into both arias and recitatives * gesture as a powerful tool for enhancing the effect of the vocal delivery * vibrato primarily reserved for heightening the expression of certain words and for gracing longer notes. The Harvard Dictionary of Music by Willi Apel says that bel canto denotes \\"the Italian vocal technique of the 18th century, with its emphasis on beauty of sound and brilliancy of performance rather than dramatic expression or romantic emotion. In spite of the repeated reactions against bel canto (or its abuses, such as display for its own sake; Gluck, Wagner) and the frequent exaggeration of its virtuoso element (coloratura), it must be considered as a highly artistic technique and the only proper one for Italian opera and for Mozart. Its early development is closely bound up with that of the Italian opera seria (A. Scarlatti, N. Porpora, J. A. Hasse, N. Jommelli, N. Piccinni).\\"Apel, Willi, Harvard Dictionary of Music, Second Edition, Revised and Enlarged, Cambridge Massachusetts, Belknap Press, 2000, p. 88. = Bel canto in the 18th and early 19th centuries = Since the bel canto style flourished in the 18th and early 19th centuries, the music of Handel and his contemporaries, as well as that of Mozart and Rossini, benefits from an application of bel canto principles. Operas received the most dramatic use of the techniques, but the bel canto style applies equally to oratorio, though in a somewhat less flamboyant way. The da capo arias these works contained provided challenges for singers, as the repeat of the opening section prevented the story line from progressing. Nonetheless, singers needed to keep the emotional drama moving forward, and so they used the principles of bel canto to help them render the repeated material in a new emotional guise. They also incorporated embellishments of all sorts (Domenico Corri said da capo arias were invented for that purpose [The Singer's Preceptor, vol. 1, p. 3]), but not every singer was equipped to do this, some writers, notably Domenico Corri himself, suggesting that singing without ornamentation was an acceptable practice (see The Singer's Preceptor, vol. 1, p. 3). Singers regularly embellished both arias and recitatives, but did so by tailoring their embellishments to the prevailing sentiments of the piece.Toft, Bel Canto: A Performer's Guide, pp. 140, 163 Two famous 18th- century teachers of the style were Antonio Bernacchi (1685–1756) and Nicola Porpora (1686–1768), but many others existed. A number of these teachers were castrati. Singer/author John Potter declares in his book Tenor: History of a Voice that: :For much of the 18th century castrati defined the art of singing; it was the loss of their irrecoverable skills that in time created the myth of bel canto, a way of singing and conceptualizing singing that was entirely different from anything that the world had heard before or would hear again.Potter 2009, p. 31 = Bel canto in 19th-century Italy and France = In another application, the term bel canto is sometimes attached to Italian operas written by Vincenzo Bellini (1801–1835) and Gaetano Donizetti (1797–1848). These composers wrote bravura works for the stage during what musicologists sometimes call the \\"bel canto era\\". But the style of singing had started to change around 1830, Michael Balfe writing of the new method of teaching that was required for the music of Bellini and Donizetti (A New Universal Method of Singing, 1857, p. iii),Toft, Bel Canto: A Performer's Guide, p. 92 and so the operas of Bellini and Donizetti actually were the vehicles for a new era of singing. The last important opera role for a castrato was written in 1824 by Giacomo Meyerbeer (1791–1864).Jander 1998, pp. 380–81 The phrase \\"bel canto\\" was not commonly used until the latter part of the 19th century, when it was set in opposition to the development of a weightier, more powerful style of speech-inflected singing associated with German opera and, above all, Richard Wagner's revolutionary music dramas. Wagner (1813–1883) decried the Italian singing model, alleging that it was concerned merely with \\"whether that G or A will come out roundly\\". He advocated a new, Germanic school of singing that would draw \\"the spiritually energetic and profoundly passionate into the orbit of its matchless Expression.\\" French musicians and composers never embraced the more florid extremes of the 18th-century Italian bel canto style. They disliked the castrato voice and because they placed a premium on the clear enunciation of the texts of their vocal music, they objected to the sung word being obscured by excessive fioritura. Hand-written note by contralto Marietta Alboni about the decay of bel canto in the late 19th century. The French text reads: \\"The art of singing is going, and it will only revert with the sole real music of the future: that of Rossini. Paris, 8 February 1881.\\" (signature) The popularity of the bel canto style as espoused by Rossini, Donizetti and Bellini faded in Italy during the mid-19th century. It was overtaken by a heavier, more ardent, less embroidered approach to singing that was necessary to perform the innovative works of Giuseppe Verdi (1813–1901) with maximum dramatic impact. Tenors, for instance, began to inflate their tone and deliver the high C (and even the high D) directly from the chest rather than resorting to a suave head voice/falsetto as they had done previously – sacrificing vocal agility in the process. Sopranos and baritones reacted in a similar fashion to their tenor colleagues when confronted with Verdi's drama-filled compositions. They subjected the mechanics of their voice production to greater pressures and cultivated the exciting upper part of their respective ranges at the expense of their mellow but less penetrant lower notes. Initially at least, the singing techniques of 19th-century contraltos and basses were less affected by the musical innovations of Verdi, which were built upon by his successors Amilcare Ponchielli (1834–1886), Arrigo Boito (1842–1918) and Alfredo Catalani (1854-1893). = Bel canto and its detractors = One reason for the eclipse of the old Italian singing model was the growing influence within the music world of bel canto's detractors, who considered it to be outmoded and condemned it as vocalization devoid of content. To others, however, bel canto became the vanished art of elegant, refined, sweet-toned musical utterance. Rossini lamented in a conversation that took place in Paris in 1858 that: \\"Alas for us, we have lost our bel canto\\".Osborne 1994, p. 1 Similarly, the so-called German style was as derided as much as it was heralded. In the introduction to a collection of songs by Italian masters published in 1887 in Berlin under the title Il bel canto, Franz Sieber wrote: \\"In our time, when the most offensive shrieking under the extenuating device of 'dramatic singing' has spread everywhere, when the ignorant masses appear much more interested in how loud rather than how beautiful the singing is, a collection of songs will perhaps be welcome which – as the title purports – may assist in restoring bel canto to its rightful place.\\" In the late-19th century and early-20th century, the term \\"bel canto\\" was resurrected by singing teachers in Italy, among whom the retired Verdi baritone Antonio Cotogni (1831–1918) was a pre-eminent figure. Cotogni and his followers invoked it against an unprecedentedly vehement and vibrato-laden style of vocalism that singers increasingly used after around 1890 to meet the impassioned demands of verismo writing by composers such as Giacomo Puccini (1858–1924), Ruggero Leoncavallo (1857–1919), Pietro Mascagni (1863–1945), Francesco Cilea (1866-1950) and Umberto Giordano (1867–1948), as well as the auditory challenges posed by the non-Italianate stage works of Richard Strauss (1864–1949) and other late-romantic/early-modern era composers, with their strenuous and angular vocal lines and frequently dense orchestral textures. During the 1890s, the directors of the Bayreuth Festival initiated a particularly forceful style of Wagnerian singing that was totally at odds with the Italian ideals of bel canto. Called \\"Sprechgesang\\" by its proponents (and dubbed the \\"Bayreuth bark\\" by some opponents), the new Wagnerian style prioritized articulation of the individual words of the composer's libretti over legato delivery. This text-based, anti-legato approach to vocalism spread across the German-speaking parts of Europe prior to World War I. As a result of these many factors, the concept of bel canto became shrouded in mystique and confused by a plethora of individual notions and interpretations. To complicate matters further, German musicology in the early 20th century invented its own historical application for \\"bel canto\\", using the term to denote the simple lyricism that came to the fore in Venetian opera and the Roman cantata during the 1630s and '40s (the era of composers Antonio Cesti, Giacomo Carissimi and Luigi Rossi) as a reaction against the earlier, text- dominated stile rappresentativo. Unfortunately, this anachronistic use of the term bel canto was given wide circulation in Robert Haas's Die Musik des BarocksRobert Haas: Die Musik des Barocks (1928), p. ? and, later, in Manfred Bukofzer's Music in the Baroque Era.Bukofzer 1947, p. ? Since the singing style of later 17th-century Italy did not differ in any marked way from that of the 18th century and early 19th century, a connection can be drawn; but, according to Jander, most musicologists agree that the term is best limited to its mid-19th-century use, designating a style of singing that emphasized beauty of tone and technical expertise in the delivery of music that was either highly florid or featured long, flowing and difficult-to-sustain passages of .  Revival  In the 1950s, the phrase \\"bel canto revival\\" was coined to refer to a renewed interest in the operas of Donizetti, Rossini and Bellini. These composers had begun to go out of fashion during the latter years of the 19th century and their works, while never completely disappearing from the performance repertoire, were staged infrequently during the first half of the 20th century, when the operas of Wagner, Verdi and Puccini held sway. That situation changed significantly after World War II with the advent of a group of enterprising orchestral conductors and the emergence of a fresh generation of singers such as Montserrat Caballé, Maria Callas, Leyla Gencer, Joan Sutherland, Beverly Sills and Marilyn Horne, who had acquired bel canto techniques. These artists breathed new life into Donizetti, Rossini and Bellini's stage compositions, treating them seriously as music and re- popularizing them throughout Europe and America.\\"Opera: Back to Bel Canto\\", Time magazine, 20 January 1967 Today, some of the world's most frequently performed operas, such as Rossini's The Barber of Seville and Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor, are from the bel canto era.Opera statistics on operabase.com Many 18th-century operas that require adroit bel canto skills have also experienced post-war revivals, ranging from lesser-known Mozart and Haydn to extensive Baroque works by Handel, Vivaldi and others.  Teaching legacy  Mathilde Marchesi (1821–1913), a leading Paris-based teacher of bel canto sopranos Musicologists occasionally apply the label \\"bel canto technique\\" to the arsenal of virtuosic vocal accomplishments and concepts imparted by singing teachers to their students during the late 18th century and the early 19th century. Many of these teachers were castrati. \\"All [their] pedagogical works follow the same structure, beginning with exercises on single notes and eventually progressing to scales and improvised embellishments\\" writes PotterPotter 2009, p. 47 who continues, \\"The really creative ornamentation required for cadenzas, involving models and formulae that could generate newly improvised material, came towards the end of the process.\\" Today's pervasive idea that singers should refrain from improvising and always adhere strictly to the letter of a composer's published score is a comparatively recent phenomenon, promulgated during the first decades of the 20th century by dictatorial conductors such as Arturo Toscanini (1867–1957), who championed the dramatic operas of Verdi and Wagner and believed in keeping performers on a tight interpretive leash. This is noted by both Potter (page 77) and Michael Scott.Scott 1971, pp. 135–36 Potter notes, however, that as the 19th century unfurled: :The general tendency ... was for singers not to have been taught by castrati (there were few of them left) and for serious study to start later, often at one of the new conservatories rather than with a private teacher. The traditional techniques and pedagogy were still acknowledged, but the teaching was generally in the hands of tenors and baritones who were by then at least once removed from the tradition itself. Early 19th-century teachers described the voice as being made up of three registers. The chest register was the lowest of the three and the head register the highest, with the passaggio in between. These registers needed to be smoothly blended and fully equalized before a trainee singer could acquire total command of his or her natural instrument, and the surest way to achieve this outcome was for the trainee to practise vocal exercises assiduously. bel canto–era teachers were great believers in the benefits of vocalise and solfeggio. They strove to strengthen the respiratory muscles of their pupils and equip them with such time-honoured vocal attributes as \\"purity of tone, perfection of legato, phrasing informed by eloquent portamento, and exquisitely turned ornaments\\", as noted in the introduction to Volume 2 of Scott's The Record of Singing. Major refinements occurred to the existing system of voice classification during the 19th century as the international operatic repertoire diversified, split into distinctive nationalist schools and expanded in size. Whole new categories of singers such as mezzo-soprano and Wagnerian bass-baritone arose towards the end of the 19th century, as did such new sub-categories as lyric coloratura soprano, dramatic soprano and spinto soprano, and various grades of tenor, stretching from lyric through spinto to heroic. These classificatory changes have had a lasting effect how singing teachers designate voices and opera house managements cast productions. There was, however, no across-the-board uniformity among 19th- century bel canto adherents in passing on their knowledge and instructing students. Each had their own training regimes and pet notions. Fundamentally, though, they all subscribed to the same set of bel canto precepts, and the exercises that they devised to enhance breath support, dexterity, range, and technical control remain valuable and, indeed, some teachers still use them. Manuel García (1805–1906), author of the influential treatise L'Art du Chant, was the most prominent of the group of pedagogues that perpetuated bel-canto principles in teachings and writings during the second half of the 19th century. His like-minded younger sister, Pauline Viardot (1821–1910), was also an important teacher of voice, as were Viardot's contemporaries Mathilde Marchesi, Camille Everardi, Julius Stockhausen, Carlo Pedrotti, Venceslao Persichini, Giovanni Sbriglia, Melchiorre Vidal and Francesco Lamperti (together with Francesco's son Giovanni Battista Lamperti). The voices of a number of their former students can be heard on acoustic recordings made in the first two decades of the 20th century and re-issued since on LP and CD. Some examples on disc of historically and artistically significant 19th- century singers whose vocal styles and techniques exemplify bel canto ideals include the following: Sir Charles Santley (born 1834), Gustav Walter (born 1834), Adelina Patti (born 1843), Marianne Brandt (born 1842), Lilli Lehmann (born 1848), Jean Lassalle (born 1847), Victor Maurel (born 1848), Marcella Sembrich (born 1858), Lillian Nordica (born 1857), Emma Calvé (born 1858), Nellie Melba (born 1861), Francesco Tamagno (born 1850), Francesco Marconi (born 1853), Léon Escalais (born 1859), Mattia Battistini (born 1856), Mario Ancona (born 1860), Pol Plançon (born 1851), and Antonio Magini-Coletti and Francesco Navarini (both born 1855).  Quotations  *\\"There are no registers in the human singing voice when it is accurately produced. According to natural laws of voice, it is made up of one register that constitutes its entire range\\"Marafioti 1922, p. 51 *\\"Bel-canto is not a school of sensuously pretty voice-production. It has come to be a generally recognised thing that voice, pure and simple, by its very composition, or \\"placing\\", interferes with the organs of speech; making it impossible for a vocalist to preserve absolute purity of pronunciation in song as well as in speech. It is because of this view that the principle of \\"vocalising\\" words, instead of musically \\"saying\\" them, crept in, to the detriment of vocal art. This false position is due to the idea that the 'Arte del bel-canto' encouraged mere sensuous beauty of voice, rather than truth of expression.\\" *\\"Bel-canto (of which we read so much) meant, and means, versatility of tone; if a man wish to be called an artist, his voice must become the instrument of intelligent imagination. Perhaps there would be fewer cases of vocal-specialising if the modern craze for 'voice-production' (apart from linguistic truth) could be reduced. This wondrous pursuit is, as things stand, a notable instance of putting the cart before the horse. Voices are 'produced' and 'placed' in such wise that pupils are trained to 'vocalise' (to use technical jargon) the words; i.e., they are taught to make a sound which is indeed something like but is not the word in its purity. 'Tone' or sound is what the average student seeks, ab initio, and not verbal purity. Hence the monotony of modern singing. When one hears an average singer in one rôle, one hears him in all.\\" *\\"Those who regard the art of singing as anything more than a means to an end, do not comprehend the true purpose of that art, much less can they hope ever to fulfil that purpose. The true purpose of singing is to give utterance to certain hidden depths in our nature which can be adequately expressed in no other way. The voice is the only vehicle perfectly adapted to this purpose; it alone can reveal to us our inmost feelings, because it is our only direct means of expression. If the voice, more than any language, more than any other instrument of expression, can reveal to us our own hidden depths, and convey those depths to other souls of men, it is because voice vibrates directly to the feeling itself, when it fulfils its 'natural' mission. By fulfilling its natural mission, I mean, when voice is not hindered from vibrating to the feeling by artificial methods of tone production, which methods include certain mental processes which are fatal to spontaneity. To sing should always mean to have some definite feeling to express.\\"Rogers 1893, p. 33 *\\"The decline of Bel Canto may be attributed in part to Ferrein and Garcia who, with a dangerously small and historically premature knowledge of laryngeal function, abandoned the intuitive and emotional insight of the anatomically blind singers.\\"Newham 1999, p. 55 *\\"Voice Culture has not progressed [...]. Exactly the contrary has taken place. Before the introduction of mechanical methods every earnest vocal student was sure of learning to use his voice properly, and of developing the full measure of his natural endowments. Mechanical instruction has upset all this. Nowadays the successful vocal student is the exception.\\"Taylor 1917, p. 344  References  Notes Sources Jander, Owen (1998), \\"Bel canto\\" in Stanley Sadie, (Ed.), The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, Vol. One.

Enuff Z'Nuff has continually recorded and toured throughout their career of more than 30 years, releasing 14 studio albums and 22 CDs to date. Their songs have been recorded by several other musicians, including Paul Gilbert, the Wildhearts, and Nelson. The group has appeared on MTV, Howard Stern and David Letterman. In addition to their independent label releases, their music has been released on the major labels Atco Records and Arista Records. History =Formation (1984–1989)= Enuff Z'Nuff formed in 1984 as \\"Enough Z'Nuff.\\" The band soon grew a live following and recorded their first demo songs, some of which would be officially released later in their career.

Boeski and guitarists Gino Martino and Alex Kane, the latter of which moved on to lead guitars for Life, Sex & Death and eventually formed the band AntiProduct. =Major label recordings (1989–1993)= By 1989, Enough Z'Nuff had revised their band name to \\"Enuff Z'Nuff\\" and released their first major label offering, a self-titled debut album on Atco Records. For this recording, founding members Donnie Vie and Chip Z'Nuff were joined by ex- Le Mans guitarist Derek Frigo and drummer Vik Foxx. The band had two charting hits with the psychedelic-flavored pop rock songs \\"New Thing\\" and \\"Fly High Michelle\\", both of which received steady airplay on MTV. A few years later, the band's heavy glam rock appearance in the music videos would be parodied on Beavis & Butthead. Frontman Donnie Vie has expressed disappointment that the label marketed the group as a glam metal act during this period instead of as a power pop group, which he considered to be a better descriptor of their sound, and suggested that the group would have retained their popularity had they been promoted as such. For their follow-up album, 1991's Strength, the band consciously toned down their glam image. Strength was released in 1991 on Atco to strong reviews, including Rolling Stone magazine calling the group \\"The Hot Band of the Year.\\"Hot Issue Hits and Misses: Coldplay and Enuff Z'Nuff Rolling Stone.

However, this follow-up album did not sell nearly as well as their first. The band filed for bankruptcy and left Atco Records, but soon after was picked up by Clive Davis' Arista Records label for their 1993 album Animals with Human Intelligence. Before this album's release, drummer Vikki Foxx quit the band to join Vince Neil's solo band. Foxx would be airbrushed out of the album cover, despite performing on each track of the recording. Foxx was replaced by New Jersey resident and former War and Peace member Ricky Parent, who also appeared for most of the album's promotional material. The band performed on Letterman again and shot a video for the single \\"Right by Your Side\\".

Its focus is the SMTP HELO-identity of mail transfer agents. CSV was designed to address the problems of MARID and the ASRG, as defined in detail as the intent of Lightweight MTA Authentication Protocol (LMAP) in an expired ASRG draft. As of January 3, 2007, all Internet Drafts have expired and the mailing list has been closed down since there had been no traffic for 6 months.  Principles of operation  CSV considers two questions at the start of each SMTP session: *Does a domain's management authorize this MTA to be sending email? *Do reputable independent accreditation services consider that domain's policies and practices sufficient for controlling email abuse? CSV answers these questions as follows: to validate an SMTP session from an unknown sending SMTP client using CSV, the receiving SMTP server: #Obtains the remote IP address of the TCP connection. #Extracts the domain name from the HELO command sent by the SMTP client. #Queries DNS to confirm the domain name is authorized for use by the IP (CSA). #Asks a reputable Accreditation Service if it has a good reputation (DNA). #Determines the level of trust to give to the sending SMTP client, based on the results of (3) and (4) If the level of trust is high enough, process all email from that session in the traditional manner, delivering or forwarding without the need for further validation. If the level of trust is too low, return an error showing the reason for not trusting the sending SMTP client. If the level of trust is in between, document the result in a header in each email delivered or forwarded, and/or perform additional checks. If the answers to both of the questions at the top of this article are 'Yes', then receivers can expect the email received to be email they want. Mail sources are motivated to make the answers yes, and it's easy for them to do so (unless their email flow is so toxic that no reputable independent accreditation service will vouch for them). CSV is designed to be efficient and elegant, and in this respect it certainly beats SPF's coverage of HELO identities.

History The arena opened in 1973 and has undergone very few changes since its opening, mainly due to the unusual physical construction of the building in which the lower concourse is supported by beams underneath the walkways that run the length of the building as well as the media section being placed at half court on the West side of the arena. Due to the prior home of the Mean Green being famous for noise, the Coliseum was designed specifically to retain noise and as such, the Mean Green have maintained a high winning percentage at the facility. In recent years upgrades, however, have been few and far between with the exception of the seats being repainted green from their original color of brown and the stadium's sound and video boards undergoing a massive renovation with the introduction of 4 center-hung LED scoreboards. Despite the building's main usage as the home of the Mean Green, over the years it has hosted many famous concerts, notably Pearl Jam in 1993 and J. Cole in 2014. In addition to concerts, the arena routinely holds area graduations, festivals, cheer, dance and gymnastic competitions and has hosted the 1988 Southland Conference Tournament. It was also highly lauded upon completion, holding first and second round games of the 1976 NCAA Basketball Tournaments. North Texas has compiled a winning percentage of over .640 at the Pit. During the 1975–1983 era under men’s coach Bill Blakeley, North Texas, playing primarily as an independent, recorded three 20-win seasons, its first-ever top-20 ranking, the four biggest crowds in Super Pit history and memorable wins over Texas, Kansas State and a sell-out crowd against SMU, which to this date, is the highest-attended basketball game at the arena. Due to the facility's age, the current UNT administration is looking into large-scale renovations of the aging facility, citing the notoriously poor lighting and need for improved infrastructure.

He was born in Bizen Province (now Wake, Okayama) to a family of politically important, devoted Buddhists who hoped to keep Buddhism and politics separate through religious reform. He became a trusted advisor to Emperor Kanmu, a position which he used to encourage the development of Buddhism in a direction which would prevent it from posing a threat to the government. According to the Shoku Nihongi, he was sent to the Usa Shrine to receive a divine message; stating that only those of descent from Amaterasu could become emperor, it refuted the previous divine message claiming Dōkyō was to be the next emperor after Empress Kōken (later Empress Shōtoku). This report angered Dōkyō, who used his influence with the Empress to have an edict issued sending Kiyomaro into exile; he also had the sinews of Kiyomaro's legs cut, and only the protection of the Fujiwara clan saved him from being killed outright. The following year, however, Empress Shōtoku died. She was succeeded by Emperor Kōnin, who in turn exiled Dōkyō to Shimotsuke Province and not only recalled Wake no Kiyomaro from exile, but also appointed him as both kami (governor) of Bizen Province and Udaijin (junior minister of state). The following year, he petitioned the governor of Dazaifu to send officials to Usa to investigate allegations of \\"fraudulent oracles\\"; in his later report, Wake no Kiyomaro stated that out of five oracles checked, two were found to be fabricated. This resulted in the government relieving Usa no Ikemori of his position as head priest and replacing him with the previously- disgraced Ōga no Tamaro. Following this, Wake no Kiyomaro returned to Yamato. He remained a trusted advisor to Emperor Kammu; in the spring of 793, he convinced the emperor to abandon the delay-plagued construction of a capital at Nagaoka and instead seek another location to the northeast, at Heian-kyō (modern-day Kyōto.

Murphy Athletic Center (commonly known as the Murphy Center) is the name of the main athletic department building at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. The building opened December 11, 1972, and is named in honor of former athletics director Charles M. \\"Bubber\\" Murphy, a standout athlete at the college in the 1930s, who also served as head coach of Middle Tennessee State's football (1947–1968), basketball (1948–1949), and baseball (1951, 1953–1955) programs. Located on the northwest edge of MTSU's campus, adjacent to Johnny \\"Red\\" Floyd Stadium, Murphy Center houses most of the university's athletics offices, some classroom space, multiple practice gymnasiums, training rooms, locker rooms, weight rooms, dance studios, racquetball courts and, most notably, the 11,520-seat multi-purpose Monte Hale Arena. The building's campus abbreviation is MC. Though the building appears to sit atop a hill, it is actually two levels high, with most of the first floor situated behind a berm. The first level contains Murphy Center's offices and facilities, which are positioned in a square under the arena's seating bowl. The arena floor itself is also on the first level, and is accessible from any of four portals. The main arena concourse makes up the second level, which is entirely above ground, and its exterior walls are composed completely of windows and metal frames. As a result, Murphy Center has earned the nickname \\"The Glass House\\". During the day, the interior of the arena is bathed with natural sunlight, so much so that a curtain was installed on the western side of the building to prevent glare during afternoon events. The bleacher sections on the concourse also help to shield the arena floor from the light. Monte Hale Arena Monte Hale Arena is home to the MTSU Blue Raiders men's and women's basketball teams, and features a bowl of permanent box seats around the basketball floor and 17 (originally 18) sections of retractable bleachers on the concourse above the bowl. The bleachers usually remain in their retracted state and are only opened for events in which the expected attendance is larger than the bowl of box seats will allow. The arena's seating structure is designed to be identical to the original configuration of the Joyce Center at the University of Notre Dame. The arena itself is named in memory of Monte Hale, MTSU Athletics' radio play-by-play voice from 1961 to 1981, although it is most often simply called \\"Murphy Center\\", the name of the building that houses it. =Basketball= The first basketball game at Murphy Center featured the MTSU men's team hosting Vanderbilt on the arena's opening night. The Commodores defeated the Blue Raiders 69–57. Murphy Center has hosted countless basketball games, and a few of those have been sold out. The largest crowd ever to witness a game on the hardwood of Monte Hale Arena was 11,807 on February 26, 2004, when the Blue Raiders defeated the WKU Hilltoppers 73–59. Other sold out sporting events include the women's basketball team's game on November 25, 2009 against the Tennessee Lady Vols. A crowd of 11,802 witnessed a close game but UT victory, 69–52. The arena has also hosted the Ohio Valley Conference men's basketball tournament three times: 1975, 1985 and 1987; and hosted the Sun Belt Conference men's and women's basketball tournaments in 2006. Monte Hale Arena also serves as home to the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association's (TSSAA) boys and girls Division I state high school basketball championships each March. =Volleyball= Select matches of the 2010 Sun Belt Conference Volleyball Tournament were held inside Murphy Center. The final matches of the TSSAA volleyball championships are held inside Murphy Center each October. The Lady Raiders volleyball team staged matches in Murphy Center until 2002, when the program moved to the neighboring Alumni Memorial Gymnasium. =Indoor Track and Field= When the bleachers are retracted, the upper concourse of the arena can also serve as an indoor track and field facility. The texture of the concourse's floor is designed to accommodate such events, and the lines for the running lanes are permanently painted onto the floor. Murphy Center has been home to 24 total Ohio Valley and Sun Belt Conference Indoor Championships. Murphy Center is also famous for the creation of NCAA Indoor Last Chance Meets. In 1976, MTSU head coach track and field coach Dean Hayes got together with several other coaches looking for one final opportunity for their athletes to qualify for the NCAA Indoor Championships. The coaches held a meet at Murphy Center the week before the nationals, that would later go on to be known as NCAA Last Chance Meets. Today, there are at least six Last Chance Meets around the nation including; Ames, Iowa (Iowa State), South Bend, Ind. (Notre Dame), Blacksburg, Va. (Virginia Tech), Lincoln, Neb. (Nebraska), Fayetteville, Ark. (Arkansas), and Gainesville, Fla. (Florida). =Music venue= Especially during the 1970s and 1980s, but even through the late 1990s, Murphy Center was one of the Nashville area's premier concert venues, having the largest capacity of any suitable indoor facility in the region. Notably, Elvis Presley played a series of five sold out shows in the arena in 1974 & 1975\\\\. On February 20, 1989, Bon Jovi played to a sold-out, standing room only crowd as part of their New Jersey Syndicate Tour at the Center. U2 played the Center in 1987 to a sold-out crowd as part of their The Joshua Tree Tour. However, the frequency and notability of concerts began to drop as trends changed. Large touring shows became more elaborate and demanded larger and more modern venues, such as Starwood Amphitheatre in Antioch (built in 1985, closed in 2006) and Bridgestone Arena in Nashville (built in 1996). Occasional concerts are still staged at Murphy Center, although they are typically geared toward the MTSU student body and feature lower-tier artists that draw smaller crowds. In 1991, Murphy Center gained notability as the site of The Judds' farewell concert as regular touring act (though they have since performed several shows together). Portions of Garth Brooks' 1992 NBC television special, This Is Garth Brooks, were also filmed at Murphy Center. =Convocations= Monte Hale Arena inside Murphy Center is used for occasional convocations of MTSU students, including CUSTOMS events for incoming freshmen and transfers. Homecoming week festivities and student- oriented concerts are also held inside the arena. MTSU's graduation ceremonies take place at Murphy Center each May, August, and December. Several area high schools also regularly use Murphy Center to host graduation ceremonies. History The idea of a new arena for then-Middle Tennessee State College was conceptualized by school President Quill E. Cope in the early 1960s, as a response to MTSC's growth. Crowds for basketball games were getting too large for Memorial Gymnasium (now Alumni Memorial Gymnasium) to hold. Original plans had called for a 7,500-seat basketball-only facility and a separate building for the athletic department offices and field sports. When Cope retired in 1967, new University President Mel Scarlett combined the two concepts into one facility and envisioned a larger arena that could accommodate sports and other events, with a side benefit being the ability to move graduation ceremonies indoors. An architect was hired in 1968, construction began on Murphy Center in 1971, and the building opened on December 11, 1972. In April 2012, the retractable bleachers in Section D were destroyed when the retraction motor malfunctioned and caused the structure to collapse. The arena was not in use at the time and no one was injured. , the section of bleachers has not been replaced. After the incident, the remaining 17 bleacher sections passed inspection and showed no further issues, but as a precautionary measure, their motors were replaced later that year. In a 2011 interview with The Daily News Journal, MTSU Athletics Director Chris Massaro envisioned a new indoor track facility elsewhere on campus that would allow the bleachers to be removed and replaced with suites. The building underwent significant renovations in recent years to modernize the roof, lighting, air conditioning system, concession stands, and restrooms. In addition, adjustable curtains were installed over some of the eastern and southern windows of the arena to further prevent sunlight glare during afternoon events, especially for the benefit of those viewing the events on television. The $12.64 million project began in December 2013, and was completed prior to the 2014-15 basketball season. The upgrades were completed in phases in order to prevent total closure and keep the building functional for most events through the renovation period, although area high school graduations were moved elsewhere. As a result of the 2014 renovations, the white foam waffle-shaped ceiling panels, a highly-visible and distinctive characteristic of Monte Hale Arena, were permanently removed. The tiles had been an aesthetic design element upon the arena's construction, and also acted as an acoustic buffer. Following the renovations, Murphy Center's ceiling was painted black, and acoustic curtains were installed to help absorb noise. Other improvements implemented since 2002 include a new wooden floor, all-new blue seats in the reserved seating sections, two new scoreboards (one above the bleachers at each end of the court) with HD videoboards included, four new LED video scoreboards (one above each of the four tunnels at the corners of the court), a new sound system, and modernizing the existing bleacher sections (painting gray, replacing retraction motors, and bringing to ADA standards). The court's design was rotated 180 degrees, along with correspondingly moving the benches, scorers' table, and media row to the opposite sides in order to better accommodate television broadcasts. The locker rooms for the men's tennis and men's & women's basketball teams have been completely renovated as well.

The first son of Minamoto no Yoriyoshi, he proved himself in battle with the Abe clan in the Zenkunen War (Early Nine Years' War) and the Kiyohara clan in the Gosannen War (Later Three Years' War). Subsequently, he became something of a paragon of samurai skill and bravery. After his death, Yoshiie was elevated to Kami status: renamed \\"Hachimantaro\\", lit. \\"son of Hachiman\\", the Shinto god of war, and was made by the Minamoto Clan into their Patron Ancestral Kami. The Zenkunen War Minamoto no Yoshiie holds a Japanese war fan which has a symbol of the Japanese sun disc In 1050, Abe no Yoritoki wave the post of Chinjufu-shōgun, as the Abe clan had for many generations; he was the chief commander of the defense of northern Honshū against the native Ezo (Ainu) people. Effectively, however, Yoritoki commanded the entire region, denying the official Governor any true power. As a result, Yoshiie's father was appointed both chinjufu shōgun and governor, and Yoshiie traveled north with him to resolve the situation. The campaign against the Abe clan lasted twelve years (nine, with three years truce). Yoshiie fought alongside his father in most if not every battle, including the Battle of Kawasaki and the Siege of Kuriyagawa. Abe no Yoritoki died in 1057, but his son Abe no Sadato took up command of his father's forces. > Yoriyoshi's first son, Hachimantarō, gave hot pursuit along the Koromo River > and called out, 'Sir, you show your back to your enemy! Aren't you ashamed? > Turn around a minute, I have something to tell you.' When Sadato turned > around, Yoshiie said: Koromo no tate wa hokorobinikeri (\\"Koromo Castle has > been destroyed.\\" or, alternatively, \\"The warps in your robe have come > undone.\\") Sadato relaxed his reins somewhat and, turning his helmeted head, > followed that with: toshi o heishi ito no midare no kurushisa ni (\\"Over the > years its threads became tangled, and this pains me.\\") Hearing this, Yoshiie > put away the arrow he had readied to shoot, and returned to his camp. In the > midst of such a savage battle, that was a gentlemanly thing to do.Heian > Period Yoshiie returned to Kyoto in early 1063 with the heads of Abe no Sadato and a number of others. As a result of his dramatic prowess in battle, he earned the name Hachimantaro, referring to him as the \\"son of Hachiman\\", the god of war. The following year, Yoshiie took several followers of the Abe, who he had taken as captives, as attendants. The Later Three Years' War The Later Three Year War Over twenty years later, Yoshiie was the chief commander in another important conflict of the Heian period. Beginning in 1083, he battled the Kiyohara family, who had fought alongside him and his father against the Abe, but who had since proven themselves poor rulers of the northern provinces. Named Governor of Mutsu province in 1083, Yoshiie took it upon himself, without orders from the Imperial Court, to bring some peace and order to the region. A series of disputes between Kiyohara no Masahira, Narihira, and Iehira over leadership of the clan had turned to violence. There emerged a series of battles and skirmishes between Yoshiie's forces and those of the various Kiyohara sub-factions. Everything came to a head in 1087, at the Kanazawa stockade. Yoshiie, along with his younger brother Minamoto no Yoshimitsu and Fujiwara Kiyohira, assaulted the position held by Kiyohara no Iehira and his uncle Kiyohara no Takahira. After many months of failed starts and skirmishes, the stockade was set aflame, and the Kiyohara defeated; Takahira and Iehira were killed. The Minamoto forces suffered great losses as well, and it is said that Yoshiie was an especially skilled leader, keeping morale up and preserving a degree of discipline among the warriors. Later life \\"Yoshiiye returned to Kyoto, where he and his comrades resumed their military posts in command of Palace Guards and the Sovereign's Escorts.\\" The only drama occurred when his eldest son, Yoshichika was banished to Sanuki. Escaping to Izumo, Yoshichika started a revolt which was put down in 1108 by Taira general Masamori, father of Taira no Tadamori.

The venue can seat 3,500 for theatrical presentations, 7,354 for front-of-arena concerts, 8,777 for the circus and auto racing, and 10,800 for full-arena concerts. The arena contains of arena floor space, of meeting rooms space and an additional in the Globe area, where the Waterman Globe is located. The arena's eight-sided center-hung scoreboard has four video screens. There are 16 ticket windows, a 14,000-watt sound system, a portable stage, four dressing and two team locker rooms, a training room, a production office and in-house catering. The arena measures 63'8\\" from the floor to the roof. There is parking for 4,450 cars within a ten-minute walk of the arena, including 450 at the arena itself. The Mitchell Center hosted the 2001 and 2008 Sun Belt Conference men’s basketball tournaments. The Mitchell Center hosted its first ever NBA basketball game between the New Orleans Hornets and Miami Heat on October 23, 2008. In the spring of 2011, the Mitchell Center was home to the Mobile Bay Tarpons of the Southern Indoor Football League. On the May 8, 2007, edition of \\"Lunch with Lee\\" on WNSP in Mobile, recently hired head basketball coach Ronnie Arrow called the Mitchell Center \\"the best arena in the state of Alabama.\\" Waterman globe The Mitchell Center's north entrance is graced by the Waterman Globe which originally rested in the Waterman Building (now the Wachovia Building) from 1948 through 1973 and was a major attraction in downtown Mobile. The Rand McNally Map Company painted the original aluminum exterior of the diameter globe, which depicts countries as they were in the 1940s. The reconstructed globe rotates once every three minutes and 50 seconds. The globe's axis is identical to the Earth's. The Waterman Globe was part of a total display of painted murals until it was cut into 300 pieces of scrap. Former USA President Frederick P. Whiddon saved the globe and stored it for more than 20 years, anticipating its restoration. USA engineering technician Lanny McCormick completed the arduous task of reconstructing the globe in 1996. Local artist Joe Wilson worked as a modern-day Michelangelo, lying on his back at the globe's new home in the Mitchell Center to restore the paint. The railing around the globe is original but augmented by new vertical brass safety bars. The globe’s steel base was recycled from a retired USA campus soccer goal. The globe made its second Mobile debut at the May 1999 USA Spring Commencement, which marked the opening of the Mitchell Center.

The population was 39 at the 2010 census. The town is just north of the east- west highway route shared by Interstate 70, U.S. Route 6 and U.S. Route 50, between Crescent Junction and Cisco. Moab, the county seat, is to the south. Thompson Springs is located in high desert country at an elevation of , with the Book Cliffs just to the north. The town's ZIP code is 84540. History Evidence of human habitation or use of the Thompson Springs area can be dated back to the Archaic Period, when beautiful pictographs were left in Thompson Canyon. Subsequent Anasazi, Fremont, and Ute tribes have also left their mark upon the area. The site of this rock art in Thompson Canyon has been designated as the Thompson Wash Rock Art District. Thompson station was last used in 1997 and was demolished in early 2016, October 2006 photograph. Thompson Springs was named for E.W. Thompson, who lived near the springs and operated a sawmill to the north near the Book Cliffs. The town began life in the late nineteenth century as a station stop on the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&RGW;), which had been completed through the area in 1883. A post office at the site was established in 1890, under the name \\"Thompson's\\". (The official designation by the United States Postal Service is still \\"Thompson\\".) The town was a community center for the small number of farmers and ranchers living in the inhospitable region, and it was also a prominent shipping point for cattle that were run in the Book Cliffs area. Stockmen from both San Juan and Grand counties used Thompson. Thompson gained importance in the early twentieth century due to the development of coal mines in Sego Canyon, north of town. Commercial mining in Sego Canyon began in 1911, and that year the Ballard and Thompson Railroad was constructed to connect the mines with the railhead at Thompson. The railroad branch line and mines continued operating until about 1950. For many years the city was served by various D&RGW; passenger trains, including the Scenic Limited, the Exposition Flyer, the Prospector, the California Zephyr, and the Rio Grande Zephyr. Although Amtrak (the National Railroad Passenger Corporation) took over nearly all passenger rail service in the United States in 1971, the D&RGW; continued service through the area until 1983. Subsequently, for the next fourteen years, the city was served by various Amtrak trains, including the California Zephyr, the Desert Wind, and the Pioneer. Construction of I-70 two miles south of Thompson Springs drew traffic away from the city as the former Old Cisco Highway (US 6 and US-50) (now named Frontage Road) was no longer used. The later movement of the passenger train stop about to the west in Green River (Green River station) in 1997 led to further economic hardship for Thompson Springs. The original name for this settlement was \\"Thompson Springs\\", a name that was reinstated in 1985. Much of the town is uninhabited today, although there are still some operating businesses in the immediate vicinity of I-70. The Moab Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action (UMTRA) Project is a uranium tailings removal and relocation project that promises to bring jobs to the area as tailings from the Atlas Mineral Company's tailings ponds outside of Moab will be moved to Crescent Junction, about west of Thompson Springs. Demographics As of the census of 2010, there were 39 people living in the CDP. There were 43 housing units. The racial makeup of the town was 94.9% White, and 5.1% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0% of the population. Transportation While the community is situated just north of Interstate 70/U.S. Route 6/U.S. Route 50 (I‑70/US‑6/US‑50), the community is connected to that transportation corridor by State Route 94, which runs south from the center of town to an interchange with I‑70/US‑6/US‑50\\\\. Prior to the construction of I‑70, the I‑70/US‑6/US‑50 ran through the center of town, Thompson Wash Rock Art District Fremont petroglyphs in Thompson Canyon, July 2010 photograph The Thompson Wash Rock Art District (which is also referred to as the Sego Canyon Rock Art Interpretive Site by the Bureau of Land Management) is an archeological site located in Thompson Canyon (about north of Thompson Springs) that was named after Thompson Wash and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The district includes several well-preserved groups petroglyphs (images etched into the rock surface) and pictographs (images painted onto the rock surface) left by early Native Americans in three different styles (each with their own panel): Fremont, Ute and Barrier Canyon. As such it provides fairly rare opportunity to compare all three the styles in one location, particularly a site that is easily accessible. Some of the images may date back more than 4000 years. The Fremont culture thrived from A.D. 600 to 1250 and was contemporary with the Anasazi culture of the Four Corners area. The Archaic period dated from 7000 B.C., while the Barrier Canyon period from around 400 A.D., and the Ute tribe dating from A.D. 1300.

It was established as the \\"Army Hospital\\" in July of 1775 to coordinate the medical care required by the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War. The AMEDD is led by the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army, a lieutenant general. The AMEDD is the U.S. Army's healthcare organization (as opposed to an Army Command), and is present in the Active Army, the U.S. Army Reserve, and the Army National Guard components. It is headquartered at Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, Texas, which hosts the AMEDD Center and School (AMEDDC&S;). Large numbers of AMEDD senior leaders can also be found in the Washington D.C. area, divided between the Pentagon and the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC). The Academy of Health Sciences, within the AMEDDC&S;, provides training to the officers and enlisted service members of the AMEDD. As a result of BRAC 2005, enlisted medical training was transferred to the new Medical Education and Training Campus, consolidating the majority of military-enlisted medical training in Fort Sam Houston. The current Surgeon General of the U.S. Army and commander of the U.S. Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) is LTG R. Scott Dingle. History Both the AMEDD and the Army Medical Corps trace their origins back to July 27, 1775, when the Continental Congress established the \\"Army Hospital\\", which was at that time overseen by the \\"Director General and Chief Physician.\\" Congress provided an Army medical organization only in times of war or emergency until 1818, at which point it created a permanent \\"Medical Department.\\" The Army Nurse Corps originated in 1901, the Dental Corps began in 1911, the Veterinary Corps in 1916, the Medical Service Corps emerged in 1917, and the Army Medical Specialist Corps came into existence in 1947.AMEDD Corps History . Office of Medical History. U.S. Army Medical Department (AMEDD). Retrieved 2011-08-26. The Army Organization Act of 1950 renamed the Medical Department to \\"Army Medical Service\\" and on June 4, 1968. The Army Medical Service was renamed the Army Medical Department. Heraldry =Coat of arms= A regimental coat of arms was devised for the Medical Department and was most likely first used in 1818. The twenty white stars on a blue background and the red and white stripes represent the U.S. flag of 1818. The green staff entwined with a green serpent combined two symbols: the rod of Asclepius from classical mythology symbolizing medicine and healing, along with the color green associated with the Medical Corps during the last half of the 19th Century. The colors Argent (silver/white) and Gules (red) are associated with the flag of the United States. The rooster is associated with the ancient Greek and Roman god of healing and medicine, Aesculapius. The ancient Greeks believed that the rooster's crowing at dawn drove away the evil disease-spreading demons from the temples so that it could be a place of healing. The torse (twisted rope) below the rooster shows alternating blue and silver colors which were representative of the Army in 1818. The Latin motto Experientia et Progressus (Experience and Progress) is meant to convey the steady and unfailing progress of the Army Medical Department since 1775. =Regimental insignia (crest)= The AMEDD Regimental Insignia The design of the AMEDD regimental insignia (crest) is derived from the regimental coat of arms. It is one of the US Army's fourteen regimental corps insignias. The insignias are worn over the right breast pocket on the Army Service Uniform (ASU) and signify a service member's branch of service. The \\"new\\" AMEDD insignia was approved on October 27, 2014. =Branch (corps) insignia= :See also: Rod of Asclepius and Caduceus as a symbol of medicine In 1851, \\"a caduceus embroidered in yellow silk on a half chevron of emerald green silk\\" was first authorized and worn by hospital stewards of the Medical Department. The caduceus in its present form was approved in 1902. Today, the AMEDD branch corps insignia is a gold color medal caduceus, 1 inch in height. With the exception of the Medical Corps, each Corps is identified by a black enamel letter (or letters) centered on the caduceus indicative of the specific branch. The insignia for Medical Service Corps is silver. Rooted in classical mythology and associated with the Greek god Hermes, the US Army's long-standing use of the caduceus has made it a well-known emblem of physicians and medical staff throughout the world. (Purists often assert that the rod of Asclepius, with its single serpent, is the more proper medical emblem.) Medical special branches There are currently six special officer branches (corps) in the AMEDD. =Medical Corps (MC)= The Medical Corps consists of commissioned medical officers who are physicians (Doctors of Medicine and Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine) who have completed at least one year of post-graduate training (internship) or have been promoted from O-1 to O-3 following completion of medical school through USUHS or the HPSP.right The MC traces its origins to 27 July 1775, when the Continental Congress created \\"a Hospital\\", essentially a Medical Department and corps of physicians, for the Continental Army. Medical officers in the United States Army were authorized uniforms only in 1816 and were accorded military rank only in 1847. Congress made the designation of \\"Medical Corps\\" official in 1908, although the term had long been in use informally among the AMEDD's regular physicians. Today, members of the MC work around the world at all echelons of the Army. The Chief of the MC is a major general, whereas the senior Army Medical Department officer is the Surgeon General (a lieutenant general). Military physicians serve in one of several general career fields. The three main fields are operational field, clinical field, and research field. Operational Medicine is the field of Army medicine that provides medical support to the soldier and his/her Chain of Command. Many operational physicians serve as Division, Brigade and Battalion level surgeons (the word \\"surgeon\\" is used to identify a physician that is assigned to a unit as a primary care provider and not necessarily as a General Surgeon). These physicians are either assigned through the \\"PROFIS\\" system or through permanent assignment (PCS). Deployments with units to combat theaters are for the duration of a deployment and the jobs are mostly filled by primary care physicians. A PROFIS provider can expect to be deployed away from their family for a total of 16 months (1 month before deployment, 12 months in theater, and 3 months for \\"stabilization\\" after return to the assigned units home station). This means that primary care physicians are deployed for longer periods than most \\"specialist physicians\\". A specialist (i.e. General Surgeon, Pulmonologist, Cardiologist, Trauma Surgeon, Rheumatologist) are usually deployed for 6 months. Operational Physicians should expect that more than 60% of their time will be spent in administrative roles and non-patient care. 40% of the operational providers time is spent caring for soldiers or supervising unit Physician Assistants (PA). With the recent Brigade Combat Team (BCT) restructuring, the demand for operational surgeons have increased. It is possible that the low retention rates of Captains and junior Major rank Physicians in the primary care fields are due to the discrepancies in deployment length and deployment frequency between primary care and specialty physicians. Clinical Medicine is the field of Army medicine in which a physician in uniform performs similar functions to a physician in the civilian arena. These physicians are assigned to a PROFIS unit in one of the various Army MEDCEN (Medical Centers) and MEDDAC (Medical and Dental facilities). Primary care physicians usually deploy to fill battalion level surgeon positions. Medical specialists deploy to support CSH (combat support hospitals) Research Medicine is filled by a minority of military physicians. Most of these research physicians are based in larger Army Medical CentersArmy Medical Department (AMEDD), \\"Training, history, education, FAQ\\"; Available from www.amedd.army.mil/ and the research institutes. =Nurse Corps (AN)= right The Army Nurse Corps became a permanent corps of the Medical Department under the Army Reorganization Act (31 Stat. 753) passed by Congress on 2 February 1901. Its motto is \\"EMBRACE THE PAST – ENGAGE THE PRESENT – ENVISION THE FUTURE\\" and its mission statement declares \\"All actions and tasks must lead and work toward promoting the wellness of Warriors and their families, supporting the delivery of Warrior and family healthcare, and all those entrusted to our care and ultimately, positioning the Army Nurse Corps as a force multiplier for the future of military medicine.\\" =Dental Corps (DC)= right The Dental Corps (DC) consists of commissioned officers holding the Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) degree or Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD) degree. The chief of the Dental Corps is a major general. Enlisted soldiers may be assigned as dental assistants, although their collar insignia lacks the 'D' and is the same as that worn by medics. Army Dental Corps Officers may train further in the following advanced training programs after Dental School: * Advanced Education in General Dentistry * Comprehensive Dentistry (2-year AEGD) * Endodontics * Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery * Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics * Pediatric Dentistry * Periodontics * Prosthodontics * Public Health Dentistry * Oral Pathology The US Army currently offers fellowship training in the following areas for Dental Corps Officers (applicants must have already completed a recognized specialty training program): *Oral-facial pain *Maxillofacial prosthodontics *Healthcare Administration *Dental informatics The following ADA recognized specialties are not represented in the US Army Dental Corps: * Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology The chief of the Army Dental Corps is Major General Thomas R. \\"Rob\\" Tempel, Jr. His father, Major General Thomas R. Tempel, Sr. served as Chief of the Army Dental Corps from 1990 to 1994. =Veterinary Corps (VC)= right The U.S. Army Veterinary Corps was established by an Act of Congress on 3 June 1916. Recognition of the need for veterinary expertise had been evolving since 1776 when General Washington directed that a \\"regiment of horse with a farrier\\" be raised. The US Army Veterinary Corps plays a significant role in current operations. Veterinary units are critical in ensuring remarkably low food borne illness rates. This is in great measure a result of veterinary inspection of subsistence in the United States as well as the approval of safe food sources around the world. Army veterinarians ensure the health of military working dogs and assist with host-nation related animal emergencies. Veterinary staff advisors also play key roles regarding issues involving chemical and biological defense. In the United States, military veterinary supervision of operational ration assembly plants, supply and distribution points, ports of debarkation, and other types of subsistence operations are critical to ensuring safe, wholesome food for our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and their family members. The large segment of the Veterinary Corps involved in Medical Research and Development missions contribute immeasurably to the overall military effort. Vaccine, antitoxin, and antidote development, directed toward the protection of military personnel, has been and will continue to be, heavily reliant on military veterinary expertise. Today, the Army Veterinary Corps, composed of approximately 800 veterinarians and warrant officers in both active and the Army Reserves, has an over 100 years of historic achievements about which it can be tremendously proud. Accomplishing its broad functions of food safety and security, animal health care, veterinary public health, and research and development, will continue to be essential as long as the need for military forces remain. The Chief of the Veterinary Corps is Colonel Steven Greiner. =Medical Service Corps (MS)= right The Medical Service Corps consists of commissioned and warrant officers. Members are required to hold at least a bachelor's degree before receiving a commission. The MSC has the greatest range of duties performed by personnel. These may include administrative and support duties, such as healthcare administrators, health services officers in operational units, healthcare comptrollers, healthcare informatics officers, patient administrators, health service human resource managers, health physicists, toxicologists, sanitary engineers, medical operations and plans officers, medical logisticians, health services maintenance technicians, and medical evacuation pilots. MSC officers serve in clinical support roles as clinical laboratory science officers, environmental science officers, pharmacists and preventive medicine officers. Medical Service Corps officers serve as commanders of field medical units in garrison and combat environments, and provide healthcare to patients as psychologists (PhD, PsyD), social workers (MSW with state license), optometrists, pharmacist, podiatrists, and audiologists. The Medical Service Corps also functions as a transitional branch, encompassing commissioned medical, dental, and veterinary students who have not completed their training through the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) or the Health Professions Scholarship Program (HPSP). Medical Service Corps officers are drawn from the various Army commissioning sources (USMA, ROTC, and the federal and state Officer Candidate Schools) following a branch- immaterial curriculum. Since a primary function of the Medical Service Corps is to manage combat health support activities, its officers hold general command authority and can compete for company and field grade command of medical support formations and detachments, as well as logistics and aviation commands along with officers of the \\"Army competitive category\\" branches, such as infantry, ordnance, quartermaster. In contrast, Medical Corps, Veterinary Corps and Dental Corps officers are limited to command billets specific to their respective corps (e.g. AMEDD Immaterial commands for Medical, Nurse, and Medical Specialist Corps officers; branch specific commands for Medical, Dental, and Veterinary Corps officers).AR 600-20, Army Command Policy The 19th Chief of the Medical Service Corps is Major General Dennis P. LeMaster effective 18 June 2019. =Medical Specialist Corps (SP)= right The Army Medical Specialist Corps consists of commissioned officers. Members hold professional degrees and serve as clinical dietitians, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and physician assistants.

D'Amico, Theory and Practice in Renaissance Textual Criticism. Beatus Rhenanus Between Conjecture and History. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988. and book collector. Rhenanus was born in Schlettstadt (Sélestat) in Alsace. His father, Anton Bild, was a prosperous butcher from Rhinau (the source of his name \\"Rhenanus\\", which Beatus Latinised from his father, who was known as the \\"Rhinauer\\", the \\"man from Rheinau\\"). Anton emigrated to Schlettstadt and eventually became one of its Burgermeisters. He was able to provide his son with an excellent education. Rhenanus attended the famous Latin school of Schlettstadt, and in 1503, went to the University of Paris, where he came under the influence of Jacobus Faber Stapulensis, an eminent Aristotelian. In 1507, he returned to Schlettstadt and then moved to Strassburg (Strasbourg), where he worked for the printer Mathias Schurer and made the acquaintance of the great Alsatian humanists, including Jakob Wimpfeling, Johann Geiler von Kaisersberg and Sebastian Brant. In 1511, he relocated to Basel, where he befriended Desiderius Erasmus and played an active role in the publishing enterprises of Johann Froben. He returned to Schlettstadt in 1526 to devote himself to a life of learned leisure. He continued a lively correspondence with many contemporary scholars, including his friend Erasmus, and supervised the printing of many of Erasmus's most important works. Rhenanus died in Strasbourg. Rhenanus's own publications include a biography of Johann Geiler von Kaisersberg (1510), the Rerum Germanicarum Libri III (1531), and editions of Velleius Paterculus (Froben, Basel, 1520), based on the sole surviving manuscript, which he discovered in the Benedictine monastery at Murbach, Alsace.A.J.

Unlike other post-industrial genres, martial industrial is typically interested more in a particular worldview or philosophy than pure experimentalism. History Laibach were one of the first bands to incorporate military marches in their industrial music and display politically provocative aesthetics. Boyd Rice and Douglas P., the noise and neofolk pioneers, respectively, adopted such attitude at several occasions to its extreme. Allerseelen, either through ritual hymns or alchemical folklore followed in the same vein. Similarly militant but less provocative and more esoteric were the heroic choral outputs of ACTUS. Les Joyaux de la Princesse developed the genre further, offering a particularly mesmerizing style of dark ambient intermingled with historical samples, speeches and interbellum chansons. The Moon Lay Hidden Beneath a Cloud / Der Blutharsch enriched this tradition, adding darkwave medieval melodies to the mix. Finally, In Slaughter Natives and Puissance expanded the genre towards orchestral and neoclassical paths, respectively. Characteristics The term 'Martial' does not necessarily refer only to military drumming but in general to ominous/dramatic atmospheres and a particular thematology, style, aesthetics and Weltanschauung. Similarly, the term 'industrial' does not denote only old- school industrial music, but rather the broad spectrum of post-industrial scene (from neofolk acoustics to harsh noise). Thus, sonically diverse bands like Genocide Organ (power electronics), Oda Relicta (sacral), Stahlwerk 9 (industrial), N.K.V.D. (industrial black metal), Die Weisse Rose (darkwave), Axon Neuron/Vagwa (dark ambient), Feindflug (EBM), Gae Bolg and the Church of Fand (medieval), H.E.R.R. (neoclassical) and Scivias (neofolk) can all be grouped under the umbrella of 'martial industrial'. Martial industrial music frequently uses imagery related to war, totalitarian regimes, European nationalism, military displays, and political mass gatherings – contexts, in short, where the individual is subsumed by history and the mass will. A range of philosophical, political, or religious themes with an illiberal, anti- cosmopolitan, and anti-egalitarian bias predominate, such as Friedrich Nietzsche's Overman, Oswald Spengler's pessimistic vision of Western decline, Mircea Eliade's theories about sacred practice and symbolism, René Guénon's writings on the \\"spiritual degeneration\\" of the West, Ernst Jünger's ideas about the renewing power of war and adversity, Julius Evola's reactionary apoliteia and mysticism, Nazi mysticism, and pre-Christian paganism. Martial industrial is produced world-wide. However, the scene is particularly strong in Germany, Hungary, France, Italy, Poland and Russia. Accusations of Fascism Some bands (Von Thronstahl) openly declare interests in learning of fascistic ideology, while others (Kraschau) favor monarchism, but some others (Militia) are eco-anarchists and National Bolsheviks (N.K.V.D.). Some explore the erotic dimension of history and uniform aesthetics (Ordo Rosarius Equilibrio). Occasionally martial industrial artists do not even touch historical/political issues. Other bands that touch such issues and use politically incorrect imagery (Turbund Sturmwerk) refuse to disclose their real convictions.

It is the capital of the department, which borders two countries, Guatemala and El Salvador. The department covers 1630 square kilometres, is mostly mountainous, and has a population of 111,474 (2006). Its main economic activities are agricultural, including coffee, corn, cabbage, sugar cane, and onions. Due to its favourable location just a few kilometres away from the border with El Salvador at El Poy, as well as the border with Guatemala at Agua Caliente, Ocotepeque has the economic benefit of being a tri-country centre of business. It also attracts residents of smaller neighbouring towns, who come to Ocotepeque to purchase things or to study. Location Directly to the north are the municipalities of Sinuapa and Concepción; to the south is El Salvador; to the east is Sinuapa; and to the west is the municipality of Santa Fe. About three hours by bus to the north is the larger city of Santa Rosa de Copán. The closest airport in Honduras is located approximately 5–6 hours to the north in San Pedro Sula. Tegucigalpa, where Honduras' other major airport is located, is 10–12 hours away by bus. Ocotepeque is also located about 3 hours from San Salvador, the capital of El Salvador, where another major airport is located. Areas of interest The Trifinio biosphere reserve is a nature preserve shared by Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Ocotepeque also boasts the Güisayote Biological Reserve, located about 35 minutes out of town. The city of Esquipulas, Guatemala is approximately 45 minutes from Ocotepeque and is home to one of the oldest churches in Central America, and what many consider to be the most sacred shrine in Central America. Ocotepeque has a few hotels, including the Hotel Internacional and Hotel Ocotepeque. Ocotepeque is accessible by several major bus lines from the major cities, including Sultana and Congolon. Many of these buses run a main route up the western border of the country, with San Pedro Sula and Ocotepeque as their first/last stops, and stop at many towns in between, including La Labor, La Union, Cucuyagua, Santa Rosa de Copán, and La Entrada. History * Ocotepeque was founded in 1530. In the first Political Territorial Division in 1825, it formed part of the territory of Santa Rosa in the department of Gracias. On 13 April 1843, it was given the title of \\"town\\", and in July 1870, it received the title of \\"city\\". It was then a municipality of Copán until February 1906. When the department was divided up in 1926, it became a district, formed by the municipalities of Sinuapa, Concepción, and Santa Fe. * On 7 June 1934, the city was destroyed by massive flooding of the Marchala River, and it was decreed that Sinuapa would be the provisional capital of the district. After a year of reconstruction, the new town of Nueva Ocotepeque was founded and declared to be the head of the department. By 1958, just \\"Ocotepeque\\" was used to refer to the new city, and the original town became called \\"Antigua Ocotepeque\\". Today, the only things remaining from the pre- flood era in Antigua Ocotepeque are a church and a massive tree in the town centre. * In 1969, Ocotepeque and the mountains surrounding it became part of the battlegrounds for the four-day Football War between Honduras and El Salvador, which began over land rights disputes and was supposedly sparked by a tense soccer game between the two countries. Education Ocotepeque has a great number of public school and has been selected as the best public education in the whole country.

During the Genpei War, he controlled his territory independently of the central government; however, he was the official imperial governor for Mutsu Province as of 1181. He offered shelter to the young Minamoto no Yoshitsune, who had escaped from Kyoto. For many years, Hidehira was Yoshitsune's benefactor and protector, and it was from Hidehira's territory that Yoshitsune joined his brother at the start of the Genpei War. Later, when Yoshitsune incurred his brother Minamoto no Yoritomo's wrath, he returned to Hiraizumi, and lived undisturbed for a time. Yoshitsune was still Hidehira's guest when the latter died in 1187. Hidehira had his son, Fujiwara no Yasuhira, promise to continue to shelter Yoshitune and his retainer Benkei, but Yasuhira gave in to Yoritomo and surrounded the castle with his troops, forcing Yoshitsune to commit seppuku and resulting in the famous standing death of Benkei. Yasuhira then had Yoshitsune's head preserved in a jar of sake and sent to Yoritomo. This did nothing to appease him, and Yoritomo destroyed the Fujiwara domain and killed Yasuhira, son of Hidehira in 1189.\\"Minamoto Yoshitsune.\\" Encyclopædia Britannica. 30 January 2007 According to legend Hidehira was raised by wolves.熊野の説話／滝尻王子、藤原秀衡の子捨て References Category:1120s births Category:1187 deaths Category:Ōshu-Fujiwara clan Category:People from Iwate Prefecture Category:People of Heian-period Japan Category:Heian period Buddhists Category:Kamakura period Buddhists Category:People of Kamakura-period Japan Category:Year of birth uncertain ","title":"Fujiwara no Hidehira"},{"id":"2344811","text":"Sensenti is a municipality in the Honduran department of Ocotepeque.

In India and China it is known as a troublesome weed. Description Celosia argentea is a tender annual that is often grown in gardens. It blooms in mid-spring to summer. It is propagated by seeds. The seeds are extremely small, up to 43,000 seeds per ounce. The flowers are hermaphrodites. Cultivation As these plants are of tropical origin, they grow best in full sunlight and should be placed in a well-drained area. The flowerheads can last up to 8 weeks, and further growth can be promoted by removing dead flowers. = Cultivars = Celosia argentea var. cristata 'Flamingo Feathers' is a cultivar that can grow up to 2 feet in height. The colors are predominantly pink to light violet, and the leaves are a darker green than other cultivars. The Century cultivars are usually taller (1–2 feet), and are bright red, yellow, orange, or pink. The Kimono cultivars are generally smaller (4 inches – 1 foot), and have more muted colors, though similar to the Century cultivars. Other colors, such as white, burgundy, orange-red, etc., can be found. Certain varieties will grow to 3–4 feet in height. Celosia plumosa, also known as Prince of Wales feathers, is a synonym for Celosia argentea. Seeds may be sold as mixtures. The following strains have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017): *C. argentea var. cristata (Plumosa Group) 'Smart Look Red' *C. argentea var. cristata (Plumosa Group) 'Fresh Look Orange' (Fresh Look Group) *C. argentea var. cristata (Plumosa Group) 'Glow Red' *C. argentea var. cristata (Plumosa Group) 'Century Rose' (Century Group) *C. argentea var. cristata (Spicata Group) 'Flamingo Feather' = Taxonomic issues = Horticultural usage may be very confusing. For instance Celosia cristata may be listed as a separate species, or a variety of C. argentea. Other names for C. argentea var. plumosa include Celosia argenta var. pyrimidalis and C. spicata. Other classifications consider three variants: *C. argentea var. argentea *C. argentea var. cristata *C. argentea var. plumosa Voss  Uses  It is used in Africa to help control growth of the parasitic Striga plant.

He is the associate editor and chief economics commentator at the Financial Times. Early life Wolf was born in London, in 1946. His father Edmund was an Austrian Jewish playwright who escaped from Vienna to England before World War II. In London, Edmund met Wolf's mother, a Dutch Jew who had lost nearly thirty close relatives in the Holocaust. Wolf recalls that his background left him wary of political extremes and encouraged his interest in economics, as he felt economic policy mistakes were one of the root causes of World War II. He was an active supporter of the Labour Party until the early 1970s. Education Wolf was educated at University College School, a day independent school for boys in Hampstead in north west London, and in 1967 entered Corpus Christi College at Oxford University for his undergraduate studies. He initially studied Classics before starting the Philosophy, Politics and Economics Course. As a graduate student Wolf moved on to Nuffield College, also at Oxford, which he left with a master of philosophy degree in economics in 1971. Wolf has said that he never pursued a PhD, because he \\"didn't want to become an academic\\". Career In 1971, Wolf joined the World Bank's young professionals programme, becoming a senior economist in 1974. By the start of the eighties, Wolf was deeply disillusioned with the Bank's policies undertaken under the direction of Robert McNamara: the Bank had been strongly pushing for increased capital flows to developing countries, which had resulted in many of them suffering debt crises by the early 1980s. Seeing the results of misjudged intervention by global authorities and also influenced from the early 1970s by various works critical of government intervention, such as Friedrich Hayek's The Road to Serfdom, Wolf shifted his views towards the right and the free market. Wolf left the World Bank in 1981, to become Director of Studies at the Trade Policy Research Centre, in London. He joined the Financial Times in 1987, where he has been associate editor since 1990 and chief economics commentator since 1996. Up until the late 2000s, Wolf was an influential advocate of globalisation and the free market. Wolf at the World Economic Forum in 2013. In addition to his journalism and participation in various international forums, Wolf had also attempted to influence opinion with his books; he has stated that his 2004 book, Why Globalization Works, was intended to be a persuasive work rather than an academic study. By 2008, Wolf had become disillusioned with theories promoting what he came to see excessive reliance on the private sector. While remaining a pragmatist free of binding commitments to any one ideology, Wolf's views partially shifted away from free market thinking back to the Keynesian ideas he had been taught when young. He became one of the more influential drivers of the 2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence, and in late 2008 and early 2009, he used his platform on the Financial Times to advocate a massive fiscal and monetary response to the financial crisis of 2007–2010. According to Julia Ioffe writing in 2009 for The New Republic, he was \\"arguably the most widely trusted pundit\\" of the crisis. Wolf is a supporter of a land value tax. Between 2010 and 2011, Wolf served on the Independent Commission on Banking. In 2012, Wolf stated in remarks for the Financial Times that public goods are building blocks of civilisation: security and safety, knowledge and science, a sustainable environment, trust, the Rechtsstaat, and economic and financial stability. Regarding the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Wolf called it the \\"biggest economic disaster since the Depression of the 1930s\\" in an editorial on the Financial Times titled \\"The world economy is now collapsing\\". Awards and recognition Wolf was joint winner of the Wincott Foundation senior prize for excellence in financial journalism in both 1989 and 1997. He won the RTZ David Watt memorial prize in 1994. In 2000. Wolf was awarded the CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire). He was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters, honoris causa, by the University of Nottingham in 2006, and was made Doctor of Science (Economics) of University of London, honoris causa, by the London School of Economics in the same year. In 2018, on the occasion of the KU Leuven Patron Saint‘s Day he received a doctorate honoris causa of the university Wolf is a regular participant in the annual Bilderberg meetings of politicians and bankers. He is visiting fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford, a Special Professor at the University of Nottingham and an honorary fellow of the Oxford Institute for Economic Policy. He has been a forum fellow at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos since 1999. Wolf has been named in the top 100 lists of global thinkers by Prospect and by Foreign Policy magazine. Wolf is regarded as \\"staggeringly well connected\\" within financial circles. His friends include leading financiers such as Mohamed A. El-Erian; politicians such as Manmohan Singh, Timothy Geithner and Ed Balls; many leading economists; central bankers such as Mervyn King: according to Wolf, he knows all significant central bankers. Despite Wolf's close connections with the powerful, he is trusted for his independence and is known to criticise initiatives promoted by his friends when he considers it to be in the public's interests. Wolf is widely regarded as one of the most influential economics journalists in the world. Lawrence H. Summers has called him \\"the world's preeminent financial journalist.\\" Mohamed A. El-Erian, former CEO of the world's largest bond investor, said Wolf is \\"by far, the most influential economic columnist out there\\". Paul Krugman wrote of him that \\"Wolf doesn't even have a PhD. And that matters not at all; what he has is a keen sense of observation, a level head, and an open mind.\\" Prospect magazine described him as \\"the Anglosphere's most influential finance journalist\\", while economist Kenneth Rogoff has said, \\"He really is the premier financial and economics writer in the world\\". In 2012, he received the Ischia International Journalism Award. In 2019, Wolf received the Gerald Loeb Lifetime Achievement Award from the UCLA Anderson School of Management.

He was the grandson of Emperor Gao of Han and one of the sons of Liu Fei, the Prince of Qi. In 182 BC, Grand Empress Dowager Lü created him the Marquess of Dongmou and summoned him to the capital Chang'an to serve as an imperial guard commander. After the destruction of the Lü Clan in 180 BC, Liu Xingju was initially promised the Principality of Liang for his role in the conspiracy by the new emperor, Emperor Wen (Liu Heng). When, however, the new emperor became aware that Liu Zhang had initially wanted to make his brother Liu Xiang, the Prince of Qi as emperor instead of him, he became very displeased. The new emperor therefore denied Liu Xingju the larger Principality of Liang and only created him the Prince of Jibei (a smaller principality carved out of his brother's principality) in 178 BC. Unhappy over this slight, Prince Xingju planned a rebellion. In summer 177 BC, when Emperor Wen was on a visit to his old Principality of Dai, Prince Xingju mistakenly thought that Emperor Wen was going to lead a military campaign against the Xiongnu, and therefore felt this was a suitable time to start his rebellion. When Emperor Wen heard of Prince Xingju's rebellion, he ordered Chai Wu (柴武), the Marquess of Jipu, to lead an army against Jibei forces. In autumn 177 BC, after military defeats, Prince Xingju killed himself.  References  * Records of the Grand Historian, vol. 52. * Book of Han, vol. 38. * Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 13.

It is the largest municipality in Central America in terms of area. Overview Catacamas, called the Florida City by the great poet and writer Froylán Turcios, extends over a vast plain irrigated by the Rio Guayape in the heart of the luxuriant department of Olancho. The city is situated 210 km. north- east of the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, and is easily accessible by paved road. Catacamas has historically been characterised by the hospitality, resilience, and progressive spirit of its people, as well as its rich natural setting, which is suitable for both agricultural and forest production. It is located in a valley 450 meters above sea level. The North White Stone Mountain, part of Agalta Mountains National Park, is located near the city, which is home to a variety of botanical species such as conifers, broadleaf plants, and some 80 varieties of orchids, as well as a rich fauna, including wild cats and the quetzal. To the north and west are the mountains \\"Cerro de la Cruz\\" and the hill \\"El Cuartel\\", among others, where you achieve the best panoramic views of the city, including the sports centre and cultural park \\"Ramón Díaz López\\". Approximately five km to the east of Catacamas, one can find the world-famous Talgua Caves (Cuevas de Talgua) discovered in 1935. A recent discovery in the caves is that of the \\"Glowing Skulls,\\" Pech Indian skeletons from approximately three thousand years ago. About 6 km to the south of Catacamas runs the Guayape gold, which forms the river Guayambre Patuca, the second longest river in Honduras, after the Segovia. Between the two rivers stretches the Cordillera Entre Ríos, which is part of the Municipality of Catacamas.

They have had a few seasons in the top tier of Honduran football but currently play in the Honduran second division. Economy Catacamas is a town rich in dairy, meat and basic grains. Of the three sectors of the municipality: Primary (Agriculture, Livestock), Secondary (Industry) and Tertiary (Services and Trade), the last produces 45 percent of the gross value of production (GVP). But the town is still dominated by its productive rural areas. The growing productive sub-sector has a gross production value of over 1.9 billion Lempiras annually. The main agricultural products include beans and corn as well as coffee and cassava. The main industrial products are the production of milk, sand blocks, sewing and breads. (Data source: PDEM Catacamas, 2007 y Base de Datos del Dpto. Control Tributario Municipalidad de Catacamas 2009). (1)The construction sector, for example, has been strengthened with new projects of subdivision/development. Many of the houses and land are bought by originating Catacamans living abroad or through their relatives. (2) Another growth area is tourism. Recently, a public private table implemented activities that strengthen this sector according to a common strategy of the municipalities Santa María del Real and Dulce Nombre de Culmí, supported by the German Cooperation. Currently, we are working on the design of eco-tourism routes and in training for service providers (tour guides, restaurants, hotels, etc.). (3) Another innovative process is the certification of several coffee farms in the region with the Rainforest Alliance Certificate which is a certificate for sustainable coffee production. The certification can achieve better prices for coffee while preserving the environment. Portal Virtual de Negocios Talgua caves Among the area's most famous tourist attractions are the Talgua caves, also known as \\"The Cave of the Glowing Skulls,\\" is located a couple miles north-east of Catacamas. The caves were used as a burial site by the native peoples, and over time, the bones left there were covered by the calcite dripping from the ceiling Radiocarbon testing indicated that the burials were made around 900 B.C., well before the rise of the Maya and other civilizations. The ossuary chamber was discovered in 1994 by a Peace Corps Volunteer named Timothy Berg, along with two Catacamas locals named Desiderio Reyes and Jorge Yánez, and research is still being conducted in the area.

The bread is leavened and allowed to rise and is shaped in various ways, usually with cheese in the middle and a crust which is ripped off and used to dip in the cheese. The filling contains cheese (fresh or aged, most commonly sulguni), eggs and other ingredients. It is very popular in Georgia, both in restaurants and as street food. As a Georgian staple food, the price of making khachapuri is used as a measure of inflation in different Georgian cities by the \\"khachapuri index,\\" developed by the International School of Economics at Tbilisi State University. It is Georgia's national dish that is inscribed on the list of the Intangible cultural heritage of Georgia.Jones, A. Khachapuri Granted Cultural Heritage Status Georgia Today, 2019 On the behalf and initiative of Gastronomic Association of Georgia, the 27th of February was announced as the National Khachapuri Day, to celebrate Georgia's timeless signature pastry as well as to promote its recognition internationally. Types There are several distinctive types of khachapuri in Georgian food from different regions of Georgia: * Imeretian (Imeruli), Khachapuri is the most popular form, made by pastry infused with yeast and white Imeretian salted cheese. * Adjarian (Acharuli/Adjaruli) A boat-shaped Khachapuri, with cheese, butter and egg yolk in the middle. It is thought to originate from the Lazi people, who were sailors. Khachapuri is a certain representation of the boat, sea and sun. * Megrelian khachapuri (Megruli), similar to Imeritian but with more cheese added on top. * Achma, from Abkhazia, which has multiple layers and looks more like a sauceless lasagna. * Gurian (Guruli) khachapuri has boiled eggs inside the dough and looks like a calzone. Arguably, it is not a type of khachapuri. Gurians make them for Christmas and call them simply 'Christmas pie'. In the rest of Georgia, it is called 'Gurian pie'. * Ossetian (Osuri) khachapuri, which has potato, as well as cheese in its filling. It is commonly called Khabizgini. * Svanuri Lemzira * Rachuli khachapuri * Samtskhe–Javakhetian Penovani khachapuri is made with puff pastry dough, resulting in a flaky variety of the pie. Outside Georgia Georgian restaurant in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York City Khachapuri is popular in the post-Soviet states, including Russia, where it is usually a simple puff pastry with cheese filling (the same pastry with meat filling is called \\"samsa\\"). It was reported that 175,000 khachapuris were consumed during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Khachapuri is a popular street food in Armenia, where it is widely served in restaurants and school cafeterias. It has become increasingly popular as a brunch food in Israel, where it is brought over by Georgian Jews.

Situated in a broad river valley alongside the Rio Juticalpa, the town is a commercial centre for much of Olancho's ranching and agricultural economy. Its Catedral de la Inmaculada Concepción, devoted to the immaculate Conception, is the cathedral episcopal see of the suffragan Roman Catholic Diocese of Juticalpa.  Geography  The Juticalpa area encompasses the Guayape River valley, bordered by the Sierra de Agalta range. Among the most notable of the small villages in the area is La Concepción and La Empalizada. The nearest town is Catacamas, 30 miles to the northeast. =Climate= The climate is significantly warmer than Tegucigalpa or nearby Campamento because of the Valle de Juticalpa's elevation. Several thunderstorms occur during the period of May through September (wet season). October, November and December are cooler and often cloudy with drizzle. From January through April, the region receives very little rain (Dry Season). During this season field fires are often observed, some are intentionally created due to an old unlawful practice for renewing crops, and others are the result of severe heat or arson; these fires create a thick blanket of smoke that settles over the Juticalpa Valley for almost a month. The air improves after the first rain. During the rainy season, the incidence of dengue fever is quite high due to the many mud puddles that become breeding grounds for mosquitoes.  Layout  The town is divided into twelve major neighbourhoods, called Barrios or \\"Colonias\\": Barrio El Centro, Barrio de Jesús, Barrio Calona, Barrio La Hoya, Barrio Belén, Colonia San Miguel, Barrio El Portillo, Barrio El Campo, Colonia El Campo Uno, Colonia El Campo Dos, Barrio El Cementerio, Barrio El Chicle and Barrio de la Cruz. The majority of town lies on a gradual slope on the southwestern side of the Juticalpa river. There are many smaller communities in the surrounding area. Juticalpa's sister city, Catacamas, is located at the easternmost terminus of the paved Olancho highway. The Boulevard Los Poetas connects Barrio El Centro to the Olancho highway and receives Honduran intercity bus traffic. The main bus station is located at the beginning of the \\"Boulevard Los Poetas\\" and several bus companies serve all of Olancho's 23 counties or \\"municipios\\". Two bus companies, Discovery and Aurora, send regular and executive service buses to Tegucigalpa and Catacamas. Juticalpa also has two public parks, Parque Central located in Barrio El Centro with the cathedral dedicated to the Virgin of Concepción on one side, and the city hall (alcaldía) on the opposite side. The second smaller park Parque Infantil is located in Barrio Belén across the Santa Clara school. Remnants of pre- Columbian civilisations can be found occasionally in Barrio Belén.Humphrey, Chris. Moon Handbooks: Honduras Economy Juticalpa's economy is primarily agricultural and commercial. Olancho's wide, fertile river valleys support maize, cattle and dairy farms. Queso Olanchano a hard and salty cheese, and \\"Mantequilla Crema\\" white cream, are produced in great quantities at several dairies and exported throughout the country, the Central American region, and United States. Because of its proximity to successful farms and its position on the only paved highway in Olancho, Juticalpa's economy has led to relative prosperity. Despite its strong agricultural base, unemployment in Juticalpa is high. To support themselves, many citizens of Juticalpa run small stores called pulperías where they sell household items and food stores to neighbors. Juticalpa contains a number of small businesses, many restaurants (ranging from taco stands to dine-in establishments with air conditioning), a hospital donated by the Japanese government, medical clinics, and a number of public and private schools. ATMs are easily found throughout the town and inside local bank branches. A new mall opened at the beginning of Boulevard Los Poetas, and four fully supplied supermarkets are well distributed across town. Recent road paving projects were finished in Barrio El Centro and Barrio de Jesús, but most of the town peripheral streets remain unpaved. The area serves as a transit hub for the tourists headed to The Sierra de Agalta National Park, and for tourists visiting The Cuevas de Talgua, limestone caves containing the calcified phosphorescent remains of ancient inhabitants of the area. In Honduras, Juticalpa is most famous for the production of an alcoholic palm Coyol tree wine known as coyol wine. Residents knock down palm trees in the middle of the dry season (March and April) and enjoy the wine at the sites, or transport the beverage to the marketplace in plastic bottles. The easiest place to find the drink is in the village of La Concepción, a few kilometers west of Juticalpa on the highway to Tegucigalpa.  Education  The city is served by various public and private schools, high schools and universities. One private bilingual school is Day Star School School, started by two Americans from Minnesota that serves pre-kindergarten to 12th grade.  Culture and entertainment  =City fair= Juticalpa's fair is celebrated on 8–14 December and is dedicated to \\"The Virgin of Concepción\\". During this period several activities take place across the city's main streets, at the Parque Central and at the AGAO \\"Asociación de Ganaderos y Agricultores de Olancho\\". =Gastronomy= Being the commercial centre of Olancho, Juticalpa is able to offer a variety of local cuisine based on fresh produce, dairy and meat. Typical dishes include Carne Asada (one of the best offered in the country), the renowned Tapado Olanchano, Yuca con Chicharrón, Baleadas, Tacos, Tajaditas, Enchiladas, Pastelitos de Carne, and other local delicacies. Rosquillas, quesadillas and hojaldras are corn and cheese based; due to the extensive cheese resources, and the high production of corn in the area, the best are found in Juticalpa, specifically in the village of La Concepción. In late years tilapia farms have been a success in the area, giving way to popularity and availability of fresh tilapia fish in many of Juticalpa's restaurants. = Sports = The City's football team is Juticalpa F.C., nicknamed \\"Los Canecheros\\", your stadium is called Juan Ramón Brevé Vargas.

History  =Early history= La Unión was elevated to municipality status in 1877 and was part of the District of Salamá.Fiallos, Carmen. 1989. Los Municipios de Honduras. As early as 1852, there was a village called San Francisco de Yocon, which was burned by guerrillas under the command of General José María Medina, who became President of Honduras in 1868. In that time he encouraged a civil war in the Department of Olancho, a product of the intentions of separating this department in an independent republic by its inhabitants in retaliation for the high taxes that the government asked of it from Comayagua (Tithes of Olancho). Between the years 1876–1883 La Unión was reestablished by decree from President Marco Aurelio Soto. The first houses were those of Mrs. Mary Dilia Vivas, Ms. Paula Almendares, and Lady Camilla Cruz. The municipality's urban growth was partially because of the regulations that forced the citizens of rural communities near the village that possessed sufficient financial resources to build homes in urban areas, even if they did not live in them. Some families were Los Vargas from farmhouses of El Paraiso, Los Funes of the villages of Palala, Los Zaldivar from the farmshouses of Los Salitres among others. Among the first mayors to serve La Unión were Mr. Tomas Herrera and Mr. Macario Vargas. =Modern history= The Catholic Church, dedicated in honour of the patron saint San Francisco de Asis, was founded in 1906. The first telegraph line was installed in 1925 by Mr. Martin Murillo. The first school was founded in 1930 and given the name of Francisco Morazan. In 1983 a committee composed of parents and others was formed by Mrs. Alejandro Carcamo, Rigoberto Rivera, Eleazar Puerto for the construction of a High School Education Center then called Instituto Privado Nocturno Superacion Franciscana. When the government of President Roberto Suazo Córdova with guidance from the deputy for Olancho, Mr. Alejandro Carcamo, formalised its operation they renamed it Instituto Superacion Franciscana.

It is recognizable from the outside for its hyperbolic paraboloid roofline, similar to Alfond Arena at the University of Maine. It replaced the still-existing Villanova Field House, later renamed the \\"Jake Nevin Field House,\\" a small arena-auditorium built in 1932. The first men's game played at the Pavilion took place on Saturday, February 1, 1986, versus the University of Maryland.

The free-culture movement is a social movement that promotes the freedom to distribute and modify the creative works of others in the form of free content or open contentThe Alternative Media Handbook by Kate Coyer, Tony Dowmunt, Alan Fountain Open Access: What You Need to Know Now by Walt CrawfordOpen Content - A Practical Guide to Using Creative Commons Licences by Wikimedia Deutschland by Till Kreutzer (2014) without compensation to, or the consent of, the work's original creators, by using the Internet and other forms of media. The movement objects to what it considers over-restrictive copyright laws. Many members of the movement argue that such laws hinder creativity. They call this system \\"permission culture.\\"Robert S. Boynton: The Tyranny of Copyright? The New York Times, January 25, 2004 The free-culture movement, with its ethos of free exchange of ideas, is aligned with the free and open-source-software movement, as well as other movements and philosophies such as open access (OA), the remix culture, the hacker culture, the access to knowledge movement, the copyleft movement and the public domain movement.  History  = Precursors = In the late 1960s, Stewart Brand founded the Whole Earth Catalog and argued that technology could be liberating rather than oppressing.. He coined the slogan \\"Information wants to be free\\" in 1984. against limiting access to information by governmental control, preventing a public domain of information.. = Background of the formation of the free- culture movement = In 1998, the United States Congress passed the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, which President Clinton signed into law. The legislation extended copyright protections for twenty additional years, resulting in a total guaranteed copyright term of seventy years after a creator's death. The bill was heavily lobbied by music and film corporations like Disney, and dubbed as the Mickey Mouse Protection Act. Lawrence Lessig claims copyright is an obstacle to cultural production, knowledge sharing and technological innovation, and that private interests – as opposed to public good – determine law. He travelled the country in 1998, giving as many as a hundred speeches a year at college campuses, and sparked the movement. It led to the foundation of the first chapter of the Students for Free Culture at Swarthmore College. In 1999, Lessig challenged the Bono Act, taking the case to the US Supreme Court. Despite his firm belief in victory, citing the Constitution's plain language about \\"limited\\" copyright terms, Lessig only gained two dissenting votes: from Justices Stephen Breyer and John Paul Stevens. = Foundation of the Creative Commons = In 2001, Lessig initiated Creative Commons, an alternative \\"some rights reserved\\" licensing system to the default \\"all rights reserved\\" copyright system. Lessig focuses on a fair balance between the interest of the public to use and participate into released creative works and the need of protection for a creator's work, which still enables a \\"read-write\\" remix culture. The term “free culture” was originally used since 2003 during the World Summit on Information SocietyWSIS (2001). \\"PCT WORKING GROUP EVENT\\" to present the first free license for artistic creation at large, initiated by the Copyleft attitude team in France since 2001 (named free art license). It was then developed in Lawrence Lessig's book Free Culture in 2004.Quart, Alissa (2009). \\"Expensive Gifts\\", Columbia Journalism Review, 48(2).

Following this, the \\"Definition of Free Cultural Works\\" was created as collaborative work of many, including Erik Möller, Lawrence Lessig, Benjamin Mako Hill and Richard Stallman.Definition of Free Cultural Works.

The web site of the organization has a number of resources, publications, and other references related to various copyright, patent, and trademark issues. The student organization Students for Free Culture is sometimes confusingly called \\"the Free Culture Movement,\\" but that is not its official name. The organization is a subset of the greater movement. The first chapter was founded in 1998 at Swarthmore College, and by 2008, the organization had twenty-six chapters.Hayes, Christopher (2009). \\"Mr. Lessig Goes to Washington\\", The Nation, June 16, 2008 The free-culture movement takes the ideals of the free and open-source software movement and extends them from the field of software to all cultural and creative works. Early in Creative Commons' life, Richard Stallman (the founder of the Free Software Foundation and the free software movement) supported the organization. He withdrew his support due to the introduction of several licenses including a developing nations and the sampling licensesinterview for LinuxP2P (6 February 2006) and later restored some support when Creative Commons retired those licenses. The free music movement, a subset of the free-culture movement, started out just as the Web rose in popularity with the Free Music Philosophy by Ram Samudrala in early 1994. It was also based on the idea of free software by Richard Stallman and coincided with nascent open art and open information movements (referred to here as collectively as the \\"free-culture movement\\"). The Free Music Philosophy used a three pronged approach to voluntarily encourage the spread of unrestricted copying, based on the fact that copies of recordings and compositions could be made and distributed with complete accuracy and ease via the Internet. The subsequent free music movement was reported on by diverse media outlets including Billboard, Forbes, Levi's Original Music Magazine, The Free Radical, Wired and The New York Times. Along with the explosion of the Web driven by open source software and Linux, the rise of P2P and lossy compression, and despite the efforts of the music industry, free music became largely a reality in the early 21st century. Organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Creative Commons with free information champions like Lawrence Lessig were devising numerous licenses that offered different flavors of copyright and copyleft. The question was no longer why and how music should be free, but rather how creativity would flourish while musicians developed models to generate revenue in the Internet era.  Reception  = Skepticism from the FSF = Initially, Free Software Foundation founder Richard Stallman did not see the importance of free works beyond software. For instance for manuals and books Stallman stated in the 1990s: Similarly, in 1999 Stallman said that he sees \\"no social imperative for free hardware designs like the imperative for free software\\".Richard Stallman -- On \\"Free Hardware\\" on linuxtoday.com \\"I see no social imperative for free hardware designs like the imperative for free software.\\" (Jun 22, 1999) Other authors, such as Joshua Pearce, have argued that there is an ethical imperative for open-source hardware, specifically with respect to open-source- appropriate technology for sustainable development. Later, Stallman changed his position slightly and advocated for free sharing of information in 2009. But, in 2011 Stallman commented on the Megaupload founder's arrest, \\"I think all works meant for practical uses must be free, but that does not apply to music, since music is meant for appreciation, not for practical use.\\"Boot up: Google and Facebook work on antiphishing tool, Richard Stallman on MegaUpload arrests, and more on The Guardian (January 30, 2012) In a follow up Stallman differentiated three classes: Works of practical use should be free, Works representing points of view should be shareable but not changeable and works of art or entertainment should be copyrighted (but only for 10 years).Correcting The Guardian's paraphrase by Richard Stallman (Jan 22, 2012) In an essay in 2012 Stallman argued that video games as software should be free but not their artwork.Nonfree DRM'd Games on GNU/Linux: Good or Bad? on fsf.org by Richard Stallman \\"Nonfree game programs (like other nonfree programs) are unethical because they deny freedom to their users. (Game art is a different issue, because it isn't software.\\" (May 31, 2012) In 2015 Stallman advocated for free hardware designs.Hardware Designs Should Be Free. Here’s How to Do It by Richard Stallman on wired.com (03.18.2015) = Copyright proponents= Vocal criticism against the free-culture movement comes from copyright proponents. Prominent technologist and musician Jaron Lanier discusses this perspective of Free Culture in his 2010 book You Are Not a Gadget. Lanier's concerns include the depersonalization of crowd-sourced anonymous media (such as Wikipedia) and the economic dignity of middle-class creative artists. Andrew Keen, a critic of Web 2.0, criticizes some of the Free Culture ideas in his book, Cult of the Amateur, describing Lessig as an \\"intellectual property communist.\\"Keen, Andrew (May 16, 2006). Web 2.0; The second generation of the Internet has arrived. It's worse than you think. The Weekly Standard The decline of news media industry's market share is blamed on free culture but scholars like Clay Shirky claim that the market itself, not free culture, is what's killing the journalism industry.

No complete deck has survived; rather, some collections boast a few face cards, while some consist of a single card. They are the oldest surviving tarot cards and date back to a period when tarot was still called Trionfi (\\"triumphs\\" i.e. trump) cards, and used for everyday playing.Emily E. Auger. Tarot and Other Meditation Decks: History, Theory, Aesthetics, Typology, McFarland, 2003, , , pages 145, 164, 195, 212-3.Giordano Berti & Tiberio Gonard. Visconti-tarot. Buch und Karten.: Das älteste Tarot der Welt., Königsfurt Verlag, 1999, , , 120 pages. They were commissioned by Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, and by his successor and son-in-law Francesco Sforza. They had a significant impact on the visual composition, card numbering and interpretation of modern decks.Sandra A. Thomson. Pictures from the Heart: A Tarot Dictionary, St. Martin's Griffin, 2003, , , 544 pages. Overview The surviving cards are of particular historical interest because of the beauty and detail of the design, which was often executed in precious materials and often reproduce members of the Visconti and Sforza families in period garments and settings. Consequently, the cards also offer a glimpse of nobiliary life in Renaissance Milan, which the Visconti called home since the 13th century. The three most famous collections are discussed in more detail below. =Pierpont Morgan Bergamo= This deck, also known as Colleoni- Baglioni and Francesco Sforza, was produced around 1451.Janina Renée. Tarot for a New Generation, Llewellyn Worldwide, 2001, , , page 6. Originally composed of 78 cards, it now contains 74, i.e. 20 trumps, 15 face cards, and 39 pip cards. The Morgan Library & Museum in New York City has 35, the Accademia Carrara has 26 in its catalogue, while the remaining 13 are in the private collection of the Colleoni family in Bergamo. Trumps and face cards have a gilt background, while the pip cards are cream-coloured with a flower and vine motif. The two missing trumps are the Devil and the Tower. Modern published reproductions of this deck usually contain attempted reconstructions of missing cards. The figures on the suit of bastoni wear silver pleated garments and carry a long staff; a large vessel tops either end except for the King, whose staff has a finial only at the top. Those on the suit of cups wear gold garments, embellished by the heraldic device of sun and rays; each figure holds a large chalice, as it is often the case with the suit. The suit of spades shows figures dressed in full armour, carrying a large sword. Curiously, the characters represented on denari wear garments decorated with blue ribbons wound around circular suns. The Knight of this suit is the only one not wearing a ducal crown. File:Visconti-Sforza, The Fool.jpgThe fool. File:Dama di spade.jpgThe Empress. File:Re di spade.jpgThe EmperorVisconti-Sforza.

File:Sette di denari.jpgSeven of denari. =Cary-Yale= Named after the Cary Collection of Playing Cards, absorbed into the Yale University Library in 1967, it is also known as the Visconti di Modrone set, and has been dated back to around 1466.Naomi Ozaniec. The Watkins Tarot Handbook: The Practical System of Self-Discovery, Sterling Publishing Company, Inc., 2005, , , pages 5, 174, 179. Some scholarsHajo Banzhaf. The Crowley Tarot: The Handbook of the Cards, U.S. Games Systems, Incorporated, 1995, , , page 10. have, conversely, suggested this may be in fact the oldest of sets, perhaps commissioned by Filippo Maria Visconti at the onset of the project. 67 cards (11 trumps, 17 face cards and 39 pip cards) have survived, which has led to the (disputed) suggestion that, given the distribution of the Pierpont Morgan deck, the total number of cards when this set was produced should have amounted to 86. In the 2007 book \\"The history of the tarot\\", scholar Giordano Berti proposes that the deck was produced between 1442 and 1447, because the denari (coin) cards bear the recto and verso of the golden florin coined by F. M. Visconti in 1442 and withdrawn from circulation at his death, in 1447. The Cary-Yale is the only historical Western deck with six ranks of face cards, as the \\"Damsel\\" and the \\"Lady on horse\\" supplement the traditional King, Queen, Knight and Jack. Their ranks can be determined by their positions: standing, mounted on a horse, or enthroned. The trumps also contain the three theological virtues which appear only here and in Minchiate decks. All trump cards have a gilt background, while the pip cards have a silver one.

Place. The Tarot: History, Symbolism, and Divination, Jeremy P. Tarcher/Penguin, 2005, , , pages 16 ff. Since 1971 the deck has been in the catalogue of the Brera Gallery in Milan. Apparently commissioned to Bonifacio Bembo by Francesco Sforza in 1463, it now consists of 48 cards with only two trumps - the Emperor and the Wheel of Fortune. All face cards have a gilt background, while the pip cards have a silver one. The seven remaining face cards are: Knight and Jack of cups; Knight and Jack of denari; Knight, Jack and Queen of bastoni. Almost all pip cards have survived, as this set is only missing the four of denari.

Meyer Arena, which is part of the Ferrell Center, is an arena in Waco, Texas. Built in 1988 and located adjacent to the Brazos River, it is home to the Baylor University Bears basketball and volleyball teams. It is named for Charles R. Ferrell, a Baylor student and legacy who died in 1967, and whose family's estate was a major benefactor of the arena. The building replaced the Heart O' Texas Coliseum as the school's primary indoor athletic facility. Dimensions and layout The brick and concrete building is capped by a round, gold-plated dome across and above the playing surface at its apex. It contains 41 rows of seats, seven of which can be retracted for other events. The dome weighs approximately 175 tons and is constructed of structural aluminum beams covered with anodized gold panels with 4\\" of vinyl faced insulation on the back (in) side on the panel. The dome is fastened together with Huck fasteners, which are manufactured in Waco. Temcor is the manufacturer of the roof. The surface area of aluminum panels is approximately . During erection, the dome was suspended by 32 cables on a 220' tall tower. The tower was stabilized during erection with 7 guy cables. Concrete poured to date . Structural steel is approximately 500 tons. General description of construction: Drilled piers with concrete support beams for seating bowl. Slab on grade, slabs and structural pan deck slab (over sub-concourse). Precast concrete construction for seating bowl. Exterior facade is architectural precast with white concrete and 5/8\\" thick brickettes cast into the panels. The panels are attached to a steel structure. Within the center is the Paul J. Meyer Arena which seats 10,284 for basketball, 6,000 for volleyball, 8,000 for concerts, and can seat up to 1,000 for banquets. During the summer of 2010, the Ferrell Center received a brand new, HD center-hung scoreboard. This consists of 4 new HD video screens, and 2 LED 360 degree rings on top and bottom, supplying fans with stats, replays, and more. Along the 4 corners, there are 4 side panels, also providing additional stats. With the addition of the new basketball playing floor the Bears and Lady Bears have the opportunity to be on the hardwood more days out of the year with less conversions time between events and games or practice times. In addition a basketball practice facility was constructed in 2006 on the north west side of the building. It contains 2 full practice courts, a strength and conditioning center, and new offices for the men and women's basketball staff. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" align=\\"right\\" width=\\"185px\\" + Baylor Basketball at the Ferrell Center -----  Year  Men  Women -----  1988–89  4–11  1-9 -----  1989–90  9–6  2–11 -----  1990–91  6–8  5–6 -----  1991–92  7–7  4–7 -----  1992–93  11–3  5–5 -----  1993–94  11–3  6–4 -----  1994–95  7–8  8–6 -----  1995–96  7–7  8–7 -----  1996–97  14–3  8–5 -----  1997–98  10–4  13–2 -----  1998–99  5–10  10–6 -----  1999–00  11–7  6–7 -----  2000–01  14–3  12–2 -----  2001–02  12–4  16–2 -----  2002–03  10–6  17–4 -----  2003–04  6–11  12–2 -----  2004–05  8–9  14–0 -----  2005–06  4–4  12–1 -----  2006–07  13–5  16–3 -----  2007–08  12–4  18–1 -----  2008–09  14–5  14–2 -----  2009–10  15–1  15–2 -----  2010–11  15–3  21–0 -----  2011–12  14–3  19–0 -----  2012–13  15–5  17–0 -----  2013–14  13–4  19–2 -----  2014–15  16–2  17–0 -----  2015–16  14–5  18–0 -----  2016-17  15-2  17-1 ----  2017-18  13-5  20-0 ----  2018-19  13-5  19-0 ----  Total  338–163  389–97 } Notable events The inaugural event held in the area was a political rally for former President Ronald Reagan. Through the years, the arena has hosted many famous acts on its stage including: George Strait, Garth Brooks, Keith Urban, Hootie and the Blowfish, Neil Diamond, Dolly Parton, Steven Curtis Chapman, Michael W. Smith, Amy Grant, the Harlem Globetrotters, and many more. Many world leaders have also spent time on the stage including Colin Powell, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and former President George W. Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush, all part of the President's Forum Lecture Series. Fans have also seen the best of college basketball on the court including major upsets over former conference foe Arkansas in the early 1990s and more recently with the Bears defeating #4-ranked Kansas in 2001, and the Lady Bears knocking off top-ten ranked Iowa State the same year. Since the start of the 2010–11 season, the Men's team is a combined 128–34 at home while the Women's team is a combined 167–3 in the same span, making the Ferrell Center one of the toughest places to play in the Big 12. The Baylor and Waco communities have made the Ferrell Center a tough place to play basketball with record crowds in attendance since the arrival of Kim Mulkey, including a facility record crowd of 10,550 while winning the 2005 women's Big 12 Conference regular season title. Following the record crowd, Mulkey led the Lady Bears to a first ever NCAA Women's National Championship, marking the first national championship for the Big 12 in women's basketball. The arena also plays home to Baylor Volleyball.

Opened in early 1969, Maples underwent a $30 million renovation in March 2004 and reopened ahead of schedule, in time for conference play that December. It was named after its principal donor, Roscoe Maples. Maples was an Oregon lumber magnate Upon his death in 1963, Maples bequeathed most of his $2 million estate to the university. A member of the class of 1904, he left school before graduating to support his parents, and later went on to success in the lumber business. Prior to 1969, Stanford played at the Old Pavilion, opened in 1922. Maples is home to multiple Stanford Cardinal athletics teams, including men's and women's basketball, men's and women's gymnastics and women's volleyball. The raucous student section that roots for the men's basketball team is called the \\"6th Man\\" and it is located in several rows along courtside. Prior to the renovation, the original floor at Maples had a very springy feel to it. Designed by Stanford graduate John Carl Warnecke (1919–2010), it was installed when the Pavilion opened in 1969. Nine inches (23 cm) of crosshatched wood and air was supposed to create a coil-spring effect preventing injuries, but often had the opposite effect. It caused a \\"Missed Stair Effect,\\" a phenomenon that occurs when the body senses where the floor should be upon landing after a jump. With the springy feeling of the floor, often the level would be different from when the player jumped, causing a strange sensation throughout the body. On October 14, 2010, the Dalai Lama advocated a secular approach to compassion to a standing room only crowd.

The name is derived from the Nahuatl ilamatzapotl, of which the rough translation is \\"old woman's sapote\\". The name is also applied to a similar fruit, soncoya or cabeza de negro (Annona purpurea). The ilama fruit is eaten halved, by scooping the flesh out of the rind, and usually chilled when served. It is sometimes served with cream and sugar to intensify the flavor, or with a drop of lime or lemon juice to highlight a tart and bitter note. The ilama is probably the finest annonaceous fruit which can be grown in the tropical lowlands and the ilama may be termed the cherimoya of the lowlands. Fruit 120px The ilama has a compound fruit, which is either cone-shaped, heart-shaped, or ovular. Resembling the cherimoya, it is about six inches (15 cm) long and may weigh as much as two pounds (900 g). Generally, the ilama is covered with more-or-less pronounced, triangular lobules, though some fruits on the same tree may vary from bumpy to fairly smooth. There are two types of ilama, green and pink. The green type has a flesh that is white and sweet, while the pink type has rosy-colored flesh with a tart taste. The rind, or skin, of the ilama varies from a pale-green color to a deep-pink or purplish color, coated with a thick layer of velvety, gray- white bloom. It is about 1/4 inch thick (6 mm), leathery, fairly soft, with a grainy surface. The flesh towards the fruit's center is somewhat fibrous, but smooth and custardy near the rind. The flesh varies from being dryish to being fairly juicy, and contains 25 to 80 hard, smooth, brown, cylindrical seeds, about 3/4 inch (2 cm) long, and 3/8 inch (1 cm) wide. Each seed is enclosed in a close-fitting membrane that, when split, allows the seed to slip out. Tree The tree which produces the ilama stands erect at about 25 feet (7.5m), often branching at ground level. It is distinguished by its aromatic, pale-brownish-grey, furrowed bark and glossy, thin, elliptic to obovate or oblanceolate leaves, two to six inches (5–15 cm) long. Clasping the base of the flowering branchlets are one or two leaf-like, nearly circular, glabrous bracts, about 1 to 1-3/8 inches (2.5 - 3.5 cm) in length. New growth is tinged a reddish or coppery color. The solitary flowers have three minutely hairy, long and narrow petals, maroon in color, with small, rusty, hairy sepals, and stamen-like, pollen-bearing inner petals. =Cultivation= Fruit harvest of the ilama tree occurs in late June in Mexico, and only lasts about two weeks. In Guatemala, the harvest season extends from late July to September, and from July to December where the ilama is cultivated in Florida. According to tradition, the fruits are not to be picked until cracking occurs, but they can be picked a little earlier and held up to three days for softening to take place. If the ilama is picked too early, it will never ripen. The yield of the ilama is typically low. During the normal fruiting period, some trees will have no fruits; others only three to 10, while exceptional trees may bear as many as 85 to 100 fruits per season. History Francisco Hernandez was one of the first people to document the ilama. He was sent by King Philip II of Spain in 1570 to take note of the useful products of Mexico. For many years, people confused it with the soursop or the custard apple. The ilama is native and grows wild in the foothills of the southwest coast of Mexico and of the Pacific coast of Guatemala and El Salvador. It is strictly a tropical plant. It does not grow naturally higher than 2,000 feet (610 m) in Mexico; although in El Salvador it is cultivated at 5,000 feet (1,524 m), and in Guatemala, it is cultivated up to 5,900 feet (1,800 m). The ilama survives best in climates where there is a long dry season followed by plentiful rainfall. The tree is irrigated in areas where rainfall does not fall periodically. Nutrition According to analyses made in El Salvador, the food value per 100 g of edible portion of the fruit is as follows: * Moisture, 71.5 g * Protein, 0.447 g * Fat, 0.16 g * Fiber, 1.3 g * Ash, 1.37 g * Calcium, 31.6 mg * Phosphorus, 51.7 mg * Iron, 0.70 mg * Carotene, 0.011 mg * Thiamine, 0.235 mg * Riboflavin, 0.297 mg * Niacin, 2.177 mg * Ascorbic Acid, 13.6 mg Trivia The ilama fruit was used as a plot device in the 1997 Malayalam film Guru, directed by Rajeev Anchal. This was India's official entry to the 1997 Academy Award, to be considered for nomination for the Best Foreign Film. Unlike its portrayal in the film, eating ilama fruit does not cause blindness, nor does the seed cure one of blindness. References *Davidson, Alan.

Through the first part of the 2015–16 basketball season, it was home to the University of Mississippi Rebels men's and women's basketball teams, but was replaced by a new arena, The Pavilion at Ole Miss, in January 2016. It has also hosted many concerts, including Widespread Panic in September 1995 and The Allman Brothers with Gov't Mule in November 1995. Inside The circular building, similar to many arenas constructed at the time, has a diameter white steel-framed, Neoprene-covered roof which tops out at above the court. From its exterior, it looks like a giant hub cap. The floor, 130' from end to end with its Rebel red and blue trim, is located below the surrounding ground level. The seats were replaced in 2001 with navy blue upholstered seats. In 2010 the Tad Pad was upgraded. These upgrades included a unique new center hung video display, featuring four LED boards approximately high by wide. Two ring displays are also part of the center hung structure and are able to show a variety of graphics, animations and statistical information. Overall the display measures approximately high by wide and also features four dedicated scoring sections. In addition to this upgrade, Daktronics provided a custom sound system for the newly renovated arena. The outside of the building includes red Mississippi brick and blue vinyl-covered steel siding. It is located to the southwest of the center of campus, west of Vaught–Hemingway Stadium and across the street from the Robert C. Khayat Law Center. A Confederate cemetery lies behind the building. The building opened during 1965–1966 as Rebel Coliseum. It was renamed on March 25, 1972, to honor C. M. \\"Tad\\" Smith, former three-sport letterman, coach, and athletic director at the university. The largest crowd ever at the building was on February 10, 2007, when 9,452 fans watched the Rebels defeat the No. 18 Alabama Crimson Tide. Prior to the building of the Coliseum, the team played in Old Gym (now the Martindale Student Services Center), a 2,500-seat gym built in 1929. In July 2014, Ole Miss broke ground on a new arena named The Pavilion at Ole Miss, which was completed during the 2015–16 basketball season. The final game for the men's team at Tad Smith Coliseum was on December 22, 2015, with the Rebels defeating Troy 83–80 in overtime. The final game overall was on January 3, 2016 when the Ole Miss women defeated Vanderbilt 55–52. The men's team opened the new arena on January 7 against Alabama, with the women's basketball team making their debut in the new arena on January 10 against Florida.

He argued that Mussolini was a revolutionary modernizer in domestic issues but a pragmatist in foreign policy who continued the Realpolitik policies of Italy from 1861 to 1922.James Burgwyn, \\"Renzo De Felice and Mussolini's Foreign Policy: Pragmatism vs. Ideology,\\" Italian Quarterly (1999), Vol. 36, Issue 141/142, pp. 93–103 Historian of Italy Philip Morgan has called De Felice's biography of Mussolini \\"a very controversial, influential and at the same time problematic re-reading of Mussolini and Fascism\\" and rejected the contention that his work rose above politics to \\"scientific objectivity\\", as claimed by the author and his defenders. Biography De Felice was born in Rieti and studied under Federico Chabod and Delio Cantimori at the Sapienza University of Rome. During his time as student, he was a member of the Italian Communist Party. After the Soviet repression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, De Felice was among 101 Italian intellectuals who sharply criticized the party for backing of the Soviets. He broke with it and joined the Italian Socialist Party. He taught history at the University of Rome. He was married to Livia De Ruggiero. He died in Rome. Mussolini biography De Felice is best known for a massive four-volume, eight-book biography of Benito Mussolini that was almost finished when he died. De Felice was the founder and editor of the influential journal Storia Contemporanea. De Felice, a liberal Jew, also wrote a well-regarded history of Jewish life under the Fascist government and articles on Italian Jacobinism. De Felice's leading interest was in Fascism. In his view, there were two types of Fascism, \\"Fascism as a movement\\" and \\"Fascism as a regime\\". De Felice saw Fascism, especially in the \\"movement\\" stage, as a revolutionary middle-class ideology that had deep roots in the Age of Enlightenment. Moreover, De Felice insisted that it was not caused by fear of a proletarian revolution on the part of the lower middle classes, as leftist historiography maintained; but it was an assertive movement, originated by an emerging middle class in search for its proper role. Fascism, as a regime, was seen by De Felice as nothing more than Mussolini's policy, which tended to make of fascist ideology just the superstructure of Mussolini's dictatorship and personal power. De Felice felt that fascism should be seen as valid political ideology, not just something to be demonized and dismissed in simplistic terms. He argued that studies on Fascism should get out from the political debate and become a historiographical issue based on scientific assertions. Furthermore, De Felice insisted that there was no connection or valid comparisons to be drawn between Italian Fascism and German National Socialism, which De Felice saw as being a completely different political ideology. Critics on the Left attacked De Felice for being too sympathetic to Italian Fascism. Giuliano Procacci, Paolo Alatri, Nicola Tranfaglia and others even accused De Felice of supporting Fascism. However, Italian communist leader and intellectual activist Giorgio Amendola came to de Felice's defence and rejected many of the criticisms of Tranfaglia and Ferrara in 1975, calling for more civil dialogue on fascism and antifascism.Giorgio Amendola, \\"Per una nuova storia dell' antifascismo,\\" in I’Unità, Italian Communist Party newspaper) 20 July 1975 Although he acknowledged many of de Felice's discrepancies, Amendola endorsed some of De Felice's ideas, including the \\"revolutionary aspect in Fascism\\" and the theory that Mussolini's Fascist movement attracted many adherents among the populace.Aurora G.

Detail of capitals. Mouth of Truth, believed to have originated in the temple and been moved later to the nearby Basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin. The Temple of Hercules Victor ('Hercules the Winner') () or Hercules Olivarius is a Roman temple in Piazza Bocca della Verità, in the area of the Forum Boarium close to the Tiber in Rome, Italy. It is a tholos - a round temple of Greek 'peripteral' design completely encircled by a colonnade. This layout caused it to be mistaken for a temple of Vesta until it was correctly identified by Napoleon's Prefect of Rome, Camille de Tournon.\\"...houses built into the round Temple of 'Vesta', which de Tournon correctly identified as of Hercules Victor, were removed\\" in 1811 (Salmon 1995, 150). Despite (or perhaps due to) the Forum Boarium's role as the cattle-market for ancient Rome, the Temple of Hercules is the subject of a folk belief claiming that neither flies nor dogs will enter the holy place.Leone Battista Alberti, Architecture, trans. James Leoni (1755), p. 117. The temple is the earliest surviving marble building in Rome. The Hercules Temple of Victor is also the only surviving sacred temple in ancient Rome that is made of greek marble. Today it remains unsolved who this temple was dedicated for and for what purpose. Description Dating from the later 2nd century BC, and perhaps erected by L. Mummius Achaicus, conqueror of the Achaeans and destroyer of Corinth,For its dating, see Ziolkowski 1988, 314ff; Ziolkowski's argument for its dedicator and criticisms of other scholars' candidates: 316ff. the temple is 14.8 m in diameter and consists of a circular cella within a concentric ring of twenty Corinthian columns 10.66 m tall, resting on a tuff foundation. These elements supported an architrave and roof, which have disappeared. The original wall of the cella, built of travertine and marble blocks, and nineteen of the originally twenty columns remain but the current tile roof was added later. Palladio's published reconstruction suggested a dome, though this was apparently erroneous. The temple is the earliest surviving marble building in Rome. The temples original dedication is dated back to circa 143-132 BCE, a time when intense construction was taking place in Portus Tiberinus. Identification Its major literary sources are two almost identical passages, one in Servius' commentary on the Aeneid (viii.363)sed Romae victoris Herculis aedes duae sunt, unam ad Portam Geminam, alia ad Forum Boarium. and the other in Macrobius' Saturnalia.Noted by Ziolkowski 1988:309 and notes; the other temple was that of Hercules Invictus ad Circum Maximum. Though Servius mentions that aedes duae sunt, \\"there are two sacred temples\\", the earliest Roman calendars mention but one festival, on 13 August, to Hercules Victor and Hercules Invictus interchangeably.Adam Ziolkowski 1988:311 and note 6 demonstrates the interchangeability that developed for the two originally separate epithets. C.W. Eckersberg, Vesta Temple in Rome, 1814-1816, Nivaagaards Malerisamling. Post-Classical history In the 1st century CE the temple was hit with some sort of disaster as 10 columns were replaced with Luna marble, which is similar to the original but not an exact replica. By 1132 the temple had been converted to a church, known as Santo Stefano alle Carozze (St. Stephen 'of the carriages'). In 1140, Innocent III converted the temple into a Christian church dedicating it to Stan Stefano. Additional restorations (and a fresco over the altar) were made in 1475. A plaque in the floor was dedicated by Sixtus IV.In the 12th century CE the cella wall was replaced with brick faced concrete and windows were added as well. In the 17th century the church was rededicated to Santa Maria del Sole (\\"St. Mary of the Sun\\").The temple and the Temple of Vesta in Tivoli were an inspiration for Bramante's Tempietto and other High Renaissance churches of centralized plan. Between 1809 and 1810 CE, the surrounding ground level was lowered and the temple was restored once again. The temple was recognized officially as an ancient monument in 1935 and restored in 1996.See Alessandro Pergoli Campanelli, Restauro del cosiddetto Tempio di Vesta, in \\"AR\\", XXXV, 32, novembre-dicembre 2000, pp. 26-30.

It is formed by El Tigre Island and its satellite islets and rocks in the Gulf of Fonseca. It has an area of and a population of 2,482 as of the census of 2001 (of which 4 people were living on Isla Comandante). Thanks to a natural deep channel, and despite lacking modern infrastructure, Amapala long served as the main Honduran port in the Pacific Ocean. History The name of the island on which Amapala is based is due to the fact that in the 16th century a group of pirates operated by the pirate Francis Drake operated on the island, he and his men were considered by the inhabitants of the area as wild and bloody beasts , so they called the island \\"Cerro de El Tigre\\". The name Amapala derives from Nahuatl and means \\"close to amates\\", however there is another version that assures that it comes from the words \\"ama\\" (corn) and \\"palha\\" (hill) of the Goajiquiro dialect, and therefore would mean \\"hill of corn\\". Amapala was founded in 1838, and its port was opened and declared free in 1868. During the 19th century it exported large quantities of gold, silver and other ores, although its progress was retarded by the delay in constructing a transcontinental railway from Puerto Cortés. By the mid 1970's, Amapala was gradually replaced in importance by the port of San Lorenzo on the mainland. A description of the town in 1881 can be found in the book A Lady's Ride Across Spanish Honduras by Mary Lester (a.k.a. Mary Soltera). It was intended to be the capital of the Republic of Central America in the late 1890s. Climate This area typically has a pronounced dry season.

At this point, debris that has accumulated by plucking and abrasion, and has been pushed by the front edge of the ice, is driven no further and instead is dumped in a heap. Because the glacier acts very much like a conveyor belt, the longer it stays in one place, the greater the amount of material that will be deposited. The moraine is left as the marking point of the terminal extent of the ice. Examples Terminal moraines are one of the most prominent types of moraines in the Arctic. One notable terminal moraine is Trollgarden in Norway, once thought to be magically constructed by trolls. In North America, the Outer Lands is a name given to the terminal moraine archipelago of the northeastern region of the United States (Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, Block Island and Long Island).

It was one of the most successful and critically acclaimed films of Hitchcock's British period. The film is Hitchcock's first film using this title and was followed later with his own 1956 film using the same name featuring a significantly different plot and script. The second film featured James Stewart and Doris Day, and was made for Paramount Pictures. The two films are very different in tone. In the book-length interview Hitchcock/Truffaut (1967), in response to filmmaker François Truffaut's assertion that aspects of the remake were by far superior, Hitchcock replied, \\"Let's say the first version is the work of a talented amateur and the second was made by a professional.\\" However, it has been said this statement cannot be taken at face value. The 1934 film has nothing except the title in common with G. K. Chesterton's 1922 book of the same name. Hitchcock decided to use the title because he held the film rights for some of the stories in the book. Synopsis Bob and Jill Lawrence (Leslie Banks and Edna Best), a British couple on a trip to Switzerland with their daughter Betty (Nova Pilbeam), befriend Frenchman Louis Bernard (Pierre Fresnay), who is staying at their hotel. Jill is participating in a clay pigeon shooting contest. She reaches the final but loses to a male sharpshooter, Ramon (Frank Vosper), because at the crucial moment she is distracted by a chiming watch belonging to Abbott (Peter Lorre). That evening, Louis is shot as Jill dances with him. Before he dies, he tells Jill where to find a note intended for the British consul; she in turn tells Bob. Bob reads the note, which warns of a planned international crime. The criminals involved in the shooting kidnap Betty, and threaten to kill her if her parents tell anyone what they know. Unable to seek help from the police, Bob and Jill return to England, where they discover that the group, led by Abbott, have hired Ramon to shoot a European head of state during a concert at the Royal Albert Hall. Jill attends the concert and throws Ramon's aim off by screaming at the crucial moment. The criminals return to their lair behind the temple of a sun-worshipping cult. Bob had entered the temple searching for Betty, and both are being held prisoner in the adjoining house. The police surround the buildings and a gunfight ensues. The criminals hold out until their ammunition runs low and most of them have been killed. Betty climbs up to the roof, fleeing from Ramon, who follows her. A police marksman dares not shoot at him because Betty is so close. Jill grabs the rifle and shoots Ramon, who falls off the roof. The police storm the building. Abbott, the criminal mastermind, is hiding inside but he is betrayed by the chiming of his watch, and is shot and killed by the police. Betty is reunited with her parents.

The deal for an adaptation fell through, and the frame of the plot was reused in the script for The Man Who Knew Too Much, the title itself taken from an unrelated G.K. Chesterton compilation.\\"The Making of The Man Who Knew Too Much\\", The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956) DVD The story is credited to Bennett and D. B. Wyndham Lewis. Bennett claimed that Lewis had been hired to write some dialogue that was never used and provided none of the story, though this account has been disputed.Pat McGilligan, \\"Charles Bennett\\", Backstory 1, p25 It was Peter Lorre's second English-language film, following the multiple-language version of M (1931). But he was still unable to speak English, having only recently fled from Nazi Germany, and learned his lines phonetically. The shoot-out at the end of the film was based on the Sidney Street Siege, a real-life incident that took place in London's East End (where Hitchcock grew up) on 3 January 1911.TimeOut Review: \\"shootout re-enacting the Sidney Street siege\\" The shoot- out was not included in Hitchcock's 1956 remake.TCM.com Hitchcock hired Australian composer Arthur Benjamin to write a piece of music especially for the set piece at the Royal Albert Hall. The music, known as the Storm Clouds Cantata, is used in both the 1934 version and the 1956 remake. Alfred Hitchcock's cameo appears 33 minutes into the film. He can be seen crossing the street from right to left in a black trenchcoat before Bob and Clive enter the chapel. Release The Man Who Knew Too Much opened in London in December 1934. The film received its opening in New York on 21 March 1935. Reception Contemporary reviews were positive, with C.A. Lejeune of The Observer stating that he was \\"happy about this film [...] because of its very recklessness, its frank refusal to indulge in subtleties, to be the most promising work that Hitchcock has produced since Blackmail\\". The Daily Telegraph referred to it as a \\"striking come-back\\" for Hitchcock, while the Daily Mail stated that \\"Hitchcock leaps once again into the front rank of British directors.\\" The New York Times praised the film as the \\"raciest melodrama of the new year\\", noting that it was \\"excitingly written\\" and an \\"excellently performed bit of story-telling\\". The review praised Hitchcock as \\"one of England's ablest and most imaginative film makers\\" and stated that Lorre \\"lacks the opportunity to be the one-man chamber of horrors that he was in [M]\\" but \\"is certainly something to be seen,\\" comparing him favourably to actor Charles Laughton. The film has an approval rating of 88% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 7.76/10.

The film is Hitchcock's second film using this title following his own 1934 film of the same name featuring a significantly different plot and script. In the book-length interview Hitchcock/Truffaut (1967), in response to fellow filmmaker François Truffaut's assertion that aspects of the remake were by far superior, Hitchcock replied \\"Let's say the first version is the work of a talented amateur and the second was made by a professional.\\" The film won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for \\"Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)\\", sung by Doris Day. It premiered at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival on April 29. Plot An American family – Dr. Benjamin \\"Ben\\" McKenna, his wife, popular singer Josephine “Jo” Conway McKenna, and their son Henry \\"Hank\\" McKenna – are vacationing in French Morocco. Traveling from Casablanca to Marrakesh, they meet Frenchman Louis Bernard. He seems friendly, but Jo is suspicious of his many questions and evasive answers. Bernard offers to take the McKennas to dinner, but cancels when a sinister-looking man knocks at the McKennas' hotel-room door. At a restaurant, the McKennas meet friendly English couple Lucy and Edward Drayton. The McKennas are surprised to see Bernard arrive and sit elsewhere, apparently ignoring them. The next day, attending a Moroccan market with the Draytons, the McKennas see a man chased by police. After being stabbed in the back, the man approaches Ben, who discovers he is Bernard in disguise. The dying Bernard whispers that a foreign statesman will be assassinated in London and that Ben must tell the authorities about \\"Ambrose Chappell\\". Lucy returns Hank to the hotel while Ben, Jo and Edward go to a police station for questioning about Bernard's death. An officer explains that Bernard was a French Intelligence agent. Ben receives a phone call at the police station; Hank was kidnapped but will not be harmed if the McKennas say nothing to the police about Bernard's warning. Knowing Hank was left in Lucy's care, Ben dispatches Edward to locate him. When Ben and Jo return to the hotel, they discover Edward checked out. Ben realizes the Draytons are the couple Bernard was looking for and are involved in Hank's abduction. When he learns the Draytons are from London, he decides he and Jo should go to London and try to find them through Ambrose Chappell. In London, Scotland Yard's Inspector Buchanan tells Jo and Ben that Bernard was in Morocco to uncover an assassination plot; they should contact him if they hear from the kidnappers. Leaving Jo and her friends in their hotel suite, Ben searches for a person named Ambrose Chappell. Jo realizes that \\"Ambrose Chapel\\" is a place, and the McKennas arrive at the chapel to find Edward leading a service. Jo leaves the chapel to call the police. After Edward sends his parishioners home, Ben confronts him and is knocked out and locked inside. Jo arrives with police, but they cannot enter without a warrant. Jo learns that Buchanan has gone to a concert at Royal Albert Hall, and asks the police to take her there. Once the police and Jo leave, the Draytons take Hank to a foreign embassy. In the hall's lobby, Jo sees the man who came to her door in Morocco. When he threatens to harm Hank if she interferes, she realizes he is the assassin sent to kill the foreign prime minister. Ben escapes the chapel through its bell tower and reaches the hall, where Jo points out the assassin. Ben searches the balcony boxes for the killer, who is waiting for a cymbal crash to mask his gunshot. Just before the cymbals crash, Jo screams and the assassin misses his mark, only wounding his target. Ben struggles with the would-be killer, who falls to his death. Through a spy in the embassy, the police find out the Draytons are there and conclude that Hank is likely to be with them, but that it is sovereign and exempt from an investigation. The McKennas, desperate to find Hank, secure an invitation from the grateful prime minister. In a dialogue with Edward, the ambassador reveals that he organized the plot to kill the prime minister and blames the failed attempt on the Draytons. Knowing that Hank can testify against them, he orders the Draytons to kill the boy. The prime minister asks Jo to sing. She loudly performs \\"Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)\\", so that Hank will hear her. Lucy, who is guarding Hank while Edward prepares to murder him, is distressed at the prospect of killing a child, so she encourages the boy to whistle along with the song. Ben finds Hank. Edward tries escaping with them at gunpoint, but when Ben hits him, he falls down the stairs to his death. The McKennas return to their hotel suite. Ben explains to their now-sleeping friends, \\"I'm sorry we were gone so long, but we had to go over and pick up Hank.\\" Cast * James Stewart as Dr. Benjamin \\"Ben\\" McKenna * Doris Day as Josephine “Jo” Conway McKenna * Brenda de Banzie as Lucy Drayton * Bernard Miles as Edward Drayton * Ralph Truman as Inspector Buchanan * Daniel Gélin as Louis Bernard * Mogens Wieth as Ambassador * Alan Mowbray as Val Parnell * Hillary Brooke as Jan Peterson * Christopher Olsen as Henry \\"Hank\\" McKenna * Reggie Nalder as Rien * Richard Wattis as Assistant Manager * Noel Willman as Woburn * Alix Talton as Helen Parnell * Yves Brainville as Police Inspector in Marrakech * Carolyn Jones as Cindy Fontaine * Alexis Bobrinskoy as the Prime Minister (uncredited) * Richard Wordsworth as Ambrose Chappell, Jr. (uncredited) * Betty Baskcomb as Edna, the organist.

In The Man Who Knew Too Much he can be seen 25:42 into the film, in the lower left corner, watching acrobats in the Moroccan market, with his back to the camera, wearing a light gray suit, and putting his hands into his pockets, just before the spy is killed. Production Alfred Hitchcock first considered an American remake of The Man Who Knew Too Much in 1941, but only brought back the idea in 1956 to make a film that would fulfill a contractual demand from Paramount Pictures. The studio agreed it was a picture that could be well- adapted to the new decade. The Royal Albert Hall sequence drew some inspiration from H.M. Bateman's comic \\"The One-Note Man\\", which followed the daily life of a musician who plays only one note in a symphony, similar to the cymbal player in the film.Hitchcock/Truffaut, p. 92 =Writing= Screenwriter John Michael Hayes was hired on the condition that he would not watch the early version nor read its script, with all the plot details coming from a briefing with Hitchcock.DeRosa, Steven. Writing with Hitchcock. The Collaboration of Alfred Hitchcock and John Michael Hayes. Faber and Faber, 2001. Only the opening scenes of the script were ready when filming began, and Hayes had to send by airmail the subsequent script pages as he finished them. =Casting= Hitchcock again brought James Stewart to be his protagonist as he was considering the actor a creative partner, and Paramount wanted a sense of continuity between his works. The director requested blonde Doris Day for the main female role as he liked her performance in Storm Warning, though associate producer Herbert Coleman was reluctant on Day, whom he only knew as a singer. Coleman strongly suggested that the more serious blonde actresses like Lana Turner, Grace Kelly, or Kim Novak be cast in the role, or a suitable brunette, like Jane Russell, Gene Tierney, or Ava Gardner. However, Day was eventually cast in the female lead. =Soundtrack= Hitchcock's frequent composer Bernard Herrmann wrote the \\"background\\" film score; however, the performance of Arthur Benjamin's Storm Clouds Cantata, conducted by Herrmann, is used as source music for the climax of the film. In addition, Doris Day's character is a well-known, now retired, professional singer. At two points in the film, she sings the Livingston and Evans song \\"Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)\\", which won the 1956 Best Song Oscar under the alternate title \\"Whatever Will Be, Will Be (Que Sera, Sera)\\". The song reached number two on the US pop chartsWhitburn (1987), p. 87 and number one in the UK. Herrmann was given the option of composing a new cantata to be performed during the film's climax. However, he found Arthur Benjamin's cantata Storm Clouds from the original 1934 film to be so well suited to the film that he declined, although he did expand the orchestration, and insert several repeats to make the sequence longer. Herrmann can be seen conducting the London Symphony Orchestra with mezzo-soprano Barbara Howitt and chorus during the Royal Albert Hall scenes. The sequence in the Royal Albert Hall runs for 12 minutes without any dialogue from the beginning of Storm Clouds Cantata until the climax when Doris Day's character screams. Reception Reviews for the film were generally positive, although some critics expressed a preference for the 1934 original. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote, \\"James Stewart tops his job in 'Rear Window' as the man who knows too much, and Doris Day is surprisingly effective as the mother who is frantic about her child ... Even in mammoth VistaVision, the old Hitchcock thriller-stuff has punch.\\" Variety wrote that while Hitchcock draws \\"the footage out a bit long at 119 minutes, he still keeps suspense working at all times and gets strong performances from the two stars and other cast members.\\" Harrison's Reports called the film a \\"highly exciting and entertaining suspense thriller\\" that \\"grips the audience from start to finish.\\" Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post also liked the film, calling it \\"a dandy of its popular kind\\" if \\"a wee bit too leisurely.\\" John McCarten of The New Yorker wrote in a negative review that while the remake was \\"unquestionably bigger and shinier than the original, it doesn't move along with anything like the agility of its predecessor. There can be no doubt, of course, that Mr. Hitchcock at one time was a master of celluloid suspense, but increasingly of late he has been turning out movies that are too overweight to indulge in the tricks of his salad days.\\" The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote: \\"Although a quite entertaining thriller, with some characteristically shrewd and caustic Hitchcock touches, it is likely to disappoint devotees of the first film. It lacks the earlier pace and excitement; the peculiarly English charm of the original has been exchanged for a vague VistaVision and Technicolor cosmopolitanism; the dentist episode and the siege climax are unhappily missing.\\" C. A. Lejeune of The Observer wrote that the plot had \\"a tendency to meander\\" with \\"jokes that may have looked more humorous in typescript,\\" concluding that the film was \\"strong\\" as long as it stuck to the main plot, \\"But the first 'Man Who Knew Too Much' was stronger in every way.\\" The film was a commercial success. Filmed on a budget of $1.2 million, it grossed $11,333,333 at the domestic box office, earning $4.1 million in US theatrical rentals.'The Top Box-Office Hits of 1956', Variety. January 2, 1957. The film has a score of 87% at the review- aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes based on 38 reviews. The site's consensus is; \\"Remaking his own 1934 film, Hitchcock imbues The Man Who Knew Too Much with picturesque locales and international intrigue, and is helped by a brilliantly befuddled performance from James Stewart.\\" In 2004, American Film Institute included the song \\"Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)\\" as #48 in AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs. Home video The Man Who Knew Too Much was kept out of re-release by Hitchcock until 1983 when it was acquired by Universal Pictures. The film has been released on home video by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment in VHS, Laserdisc, DVD and Blu-ray formats. The 2000 DVD has a documentary on the making of the film, including interviews with Hitchcock's daughter Patricia Hitchcock and members of the production crew.

An interpreter of classical and baroque music, Růžičková was the first harpsichordist to record Johann Sebastian Bach's complete works for keyboard, in recordings made in the 1960s and 1970s for Erato Records. As a teenager, Růžičková was imprisoned in the Nazi concentration camps of Terezin and Auschwitz and transported to the Bergen-Belsen death camp. After the camp's liberation in April 1945, she returned to Plzeň later that year. Růžičková was the wife of Czech composer Viktor Kalabis. The couple both refused to join the Czechoslovak Communist Party which held power from 1948-89, and faced political persecution as a result. Růžičková performed across the world for 50 years, recorded over 100 records, and taught such prominent musicians as Christopher Hogwood, Ketil Haugsand, Jaroslav Tůma, and Mahan Esfahani. Early years Růžičková was born in Plzen in 1927. Her family owned a department store, and her father had spent four years in Chicago in the 1920s, working at the Ginsburg Department store. Although he had experienced success in the United States, her father returned to Czechoslovakia. Růžičková learned English from her father. Růžičková characterized her childhood as \\"very sweet\\" and her parents as \\"very much in love\\".Interview with Zuzana Ruzickova, 27 March-1 April 1991. According to Růžičková, her family was historically Jewish. Her mother was an Orthodox Jew, but her father was an atheist. Růžičková described herself as not particularly religious. Růžičková began taking piano lessons after suffering from pneumonia aged nine, as a reward for her recovery. Her piano teacher, Marie Provaníková, introduced her to the works of Bach and encouraged her to take up the harpsichord. Impressed by Růžičková's talent, Provaníková wrote to French- Polish musician Wanda Landowska, asking her to accept Růžičková as a pupil at her École de Musique Ancienne in the Paris suburb of Saint-Leu-la-Forêt once she had finished her obligatory schooling at 15. In the end, Růžičková was not able to attend due to the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938, and the implementation of the Nuremberg Laws. Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia and World War II In 1941, the Gestapo began organizing transports to move Jews from Plzen to Terezín. The camp's first inmates, known as the Aufbaukommando, were tasked with converting the fortress and surrounding walled town into a concentration camp, known as Theresienstadt. In Plzen, 13-year-old Růžičková was among Jewish children used by the Gestapo to deliver \\"invitations\\" to members of the town's Jewish community, informing them of the date they would be deported to the camp, which Růžičková later described as seeing \\"life at its very worst. It was a nightmare\\". In January 1942, three weeks after receiving notice from the Gestapo, Růžičková and her family were forcibly relocated from Plzen to Theresienstadt by train. Upon arrival, Růžičková met Fredy Hirsch, a 25-year-old German Jew, who assumed the responsibility of caring for the camp's children by arranging activities and exercise for them, and reserving two barracks for what were called Children's Homes. =Internment in Theresienstadt= Theresienstadt was originally designated by the Nazis as a \\"model community\\" for educated, middle-class Jews from Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Austria. Růžičková, along with other children at the camp, did agricultural work, applying manure to fields and working in vegetable gardens, and was therefore able to sneak food from the gardens to her family. Although forced to work during the day, Růžičková was able to continue her education at Theresienstadt, and could attend concerts and lectures staged by the residents after work. She was able to see opera singer Karel Berman perform, take Latin lessons from a former university professor and harmony lessons from pianist Gideon Klein, and join a children's choir. Růžičková's father and grandfather died in the camp. Her father died in Spring 1943, but Růžičková was able to remain with her mother. In December 1943, the two were sent to Auschwitz after nearly two years in the camp. She was given the option to remain in Theresienstadt, but chose to go with her mother. Before her transport to Auschwitz, Růžičková transcribed a Bach piece onto paper to bring with her to the camp. =Internment in Auschwitz= After three days on the transport, Růžičková and her mother arrived in Auschwitz by night, and those on the transport were immediately placed in barracks, many suffering from hunger and dehydration. The next day, she and the other prisoners were taken to another barracks, stripped, and tattooed. They were then forced to sign a document stating that they had been arrested in Theresienstadt for anti-German activities, and accepted their sentence. Soon after her arrival, Růžičková was reunited with Hirsch, who advised her to lie about her age and say she was sixteen, rather than fifteen. Růžičková later credited Hirsch with her survival, as if she had not lied about her age it is likely that she would have been gassed. Hirsch was organising the children's barracks as he had in Theresienstadt, and Růžičková began working there as a teaching assistant, which kept her from more dangerous jobs and protected her from the many diseases spreading through the camp. In this role, she was exposed to the extreme reality of Nazi racial theory; German doctors, including Fritz Klein, the \\"Chief Selector\\" of the camp and colleague of Josef Mengele, whom Růžičková had met in Theresienstadt, visited the children's barracks to take physiological measurements or select children to be removed for experimentation. In May 1944, Růžičková and the other inmates who had traveled with her from Terezin to Auschwitz were scheduled to be gassed. However, their execution was slated for June 6—D-Day. After going through another selection process, Růžičková and her mother were instead sent to Germany. =Slave labor in Hamburg= Růžičková was sent to Hamburg, which was being bombed regularly by the British and Americans. Under the auspices of the Neuengamme concentration camp, laborers were assigned to work in sub-camps in the area around Hamburg. Růžičková was put to work protecting and repairing an oil pipeline and maintaining gas tanks, which were subject to daily bombardment. She was able to remain with her mother, but suffered greatly from hunger and dangerous working conditions. However, she was able to earn some extra food from other prisoners by singing for them. In addition to working on the oil pipeline, she worked in the shipyards of Hamburg. In January 1945, Růžičková was moved to the Tiefstack sub-camp, where she worked in a cement factory. As Allied forces advanced, the prisoners were made to dig booby-traps for tanks. =Internment in Bergen-Belsen= At the end of February, Růžičková and the other laborers were transported to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. She later commented that \\"if ever there was Hell, this was the lowest part of Hell. This was an extermination camp—it was really meant for us to die in.\\" At this point, Bergen-Belsen was disorganized, overcrowded, and stricken with disease. When her mother fell ill, Růžičková was forced to sneak out of the camp to gather turnips in order to survive. In April 1945 Růžičková and the other prisoners who could still walk were ordered to march from the camp to a railway station two miles away. They returned to the camp and woke the next morning to discover the Germans had gone. The guards had abandoned the camp, leaving no food, and had disconnected the water supply. A few German and Hungarian troops remained outside the camp, randomly shooting into the barracks on occasion. On 15 April 1945 British and Canadian soldiers arrived at Bergen-Belsen. =Liberation and aftermath of WWII= Růžičková, along with many prisoners suffering from starvation, became seriously ill after eating the food rations provided by soldiers. At the time of liberation, she weighed only 70 pounds. She was taken to a hospital and treated for ulcers, typhus, malnutrition, and eventually diagnosed with malaria. Since she spoke English and several other languages, Růžičková worked as a translator for the medical staff as she recovered. Although Růžičková's mother remained seriously ill, they were able to return to Czechoslovakia in July 1945, where they found their family home occupied and possessions stolen. One of the first people Růžičková met upon her return to Plzen was her former piano teacher, Marie Provaníková. Růžičková later said that when Provaníková saw the conditions of her hands after four years in concentration camps, she wept. The four years Růžičková had spent in concentration camps had not only hurt her physically and psychologically, but also caused a significant delay in her progress as a musician. To be accepted into a music school, Růžičková had to pass a series of examinations. She started in classes with children to regain her fundamental skills, and managed to advance every few months, from a third grade level to the required eight grade level. Růžičková began studying piano again with Bohdan Gsölhofer in Plzeň. Post-war career In 1947, Růžičková was accepted into the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague where her professors included pianists Albín Šíma, František Rauch and harpsichordist Oldřich Kredba. Despite her rapid improvement, one of her professors discouraged her from being a professional musician, but she continued her studies, specializing in the harpsichord and early music. She completed a BA and went on to complete an MA. After the 1948 coup by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ), Růžičková was pressured to join the Communist Youth Movement, but refused. As a student in Prague, Růžičková was called in front of a committee when she was discovered reading the works of Sigmund Freud, whose literature had been banned. In 1950, Růžičková secured a position at the Academy, teaching composers to play the piano. One of her students was her future husband, Czech composer Viktor Kalabis. She gave her first harpsichord recital in 1951. As a faculty member at the Academy of Performing Arts, Růžičková was subject to performance reviews that evaluated her both professionally and politically. As a Jew, Růžičková was still vulnerable to persecution under the Communist government. In the context of high-profile anti-Semitic political events such as the Slánský show trials of 1952, Růžičková tried to persuade Viktor Kalabis not to marry her, but they married in December 1952. In 1956 Růžičková won the ARD International Music Competition in Munich, and was offered a scholarship from jury member Marguerite Roesgen-Champion to continue her harpsichord studies in Paris. Kalabis was also invited to study in Paris, but the couple was not allowed to travel abroad together in case they defected. Kalabis went to Paris, but Růžičková remained in Czechoslovakia. Although she was unable to study in Paris, her win at the International Music Competition led to further invitations to perform across Europe. Since she was highly paid for these performances, the government allowed her to travel, but confiscated much of the foreign currency that she earned. She performed at Bach festivals in various European cities, including Leipzig, Stuttgart, Heidelberg, Ansbach, Frankfurt, Schaffhausen, and Bath. Although her success made her valuable to the state, as a non-party member Růžičková remained under suspicion from the Communist government, and was not allowed to teach music to Czech students. Furthermore, her participation in the Czech Philharmonic was restricted due to her Jewish heritage. The pressures on Růžičková were eased slightly following the death of Joseph Stalin and the relaxation of his policies. She was able to travel more freely, and occasionally with her husband. However, Růžičková did not try to defect, as she and Kalabis still had family members living in Czechoslovakia. For the first time, Růžičková was able to record music for international distribution, increasing her fame and strengthening her association with the music of Bach. This coincided with the revival of baroque music in Western Europe. In 1962, she co-founded the Prague Chamber Soloists with conductor Václav Neumann, and in 1963 she formed a successful duo with violinist Josef Suk. Other chamber music partners included János Starker, Pierre Fournier, Jean-Pierre Rampal, Aurèle Nicolet and Maxence Larrieu. She also worked with conductors including Serge Baudo, Paul Sacher, Herbert Blomstedt, Libor Pešek, Neville Marriner and Helmuth Rilling. Her recorded repertoire is extensive, including works from the English virginalists through to modern composers such as Bohuslav Martinů, Francis Poulenc, Manuel de Falla and Frank Martin. The music of Bach, however, always remained central to her career, and in 1965 Růžičková was contracted by the French label Erato Records to record the complete keyboard works of Bach. She completed the task in 1975, becoming the first person to record them in their entirety. Following the Prague Spring of 1968, the Czech government was under pressure to appear stable and progressive. Růžičková was given several state-sponsored rewards, which served as propaganda for the regime. Růžičková was unable to refuse these rewards and was often forced to accept them with great ceremony. She was a soloist with the Czech Philharmonic from 1979-90. After the Velvet Revolution Following the Velvet Revolution of 17 November 1989, Růžičková participated in the protests against the government, going on strike from the Academy of Music and the Czech Philharmonic. When the Communist regime was overthrown in December, Růžičková received the title of \\"Professor\\", which she had not been granted despite teaching at the Academy since 1951, and was able to serve as a committee member for music competitions. She also established a harpsichord class at the Music Academy in Bratislava, where she had been guest professor from 1978-82. For twenty-five years she gave master classes in Zürich, as well as other classes in Stuttgart, Kraków, Budapest, Riga, and Tokyo. She stopped performing publicly in 2004 after Kalabis fell ill. Following Kalabis' death in 2006, Růžičková became more involved in various musical organizations and committees dedicated to the interpretation and preservation of early music, and to the discovery of young musicians. She was the president of the Viktor Kalabis & Zuzana Růžičková Foundation, vice- president of the Prague Spring International Music Festival Committee, and a member of the advisory boards of the Czech Chamber Music Society and the Concertino Praga International Competition. She was a supporter of the Hans Krása Initiative, dedicated to the life and music of composer and fellow Theresienstadt prisoner Hans Krása, who was murdered in the Holocaust. She was also active in the Terezín Initiative,http://www.holocaustchild.org/index.php/about/chapters/the-terezin- initiative/ through which she was able to fund a memorial for Fredy Hirsch. Later years and legacy Růžičková was married to Viktor Kalabis for 54 years, and inspired him to compose several major works for harpsichord: Six Two-Part Canonic Inventions (1962), Aquarelles (1979), Preludio, Aria e Toccata (1992), and Concerto for Harpsichord and Strings (1975). Contemporary composers have also dedicated works to her, including Jan Rychlík's Hommagi clavicembalistici (1964), and she premiered works by Emil Hlobil, Hans-Georg Görner and Elizabeth Maconchy. Růžičková was also an influential teacher. Among her students were the late British harpsichordist and conductor Christopher Hogwood and the Iranian-American harpsichordist Mahan Esfahani. In 2013 Supraphon released new CDs of Růžičková's work, and British harpsichordist Pamela Nash wrote about her in the June 2013 edition of the British Sounding Board magazine: > Acclaimed as 'The first lady of the harpsichord,' and recognized by many as > Landowska's successor, her career has left the harpsichord world a legacy, > documented by over 100 recordings, spanning half a century... this timely > commemoration serves as a timely reminder of Ruzickova's invaluable role in > promoting the harpsichord in the 20th century. She made enormous strides to > establish the instrument as a solo and ensemble concert instrument, and > there can be no doubt that the status of the harpsichord today owes much to > her pioneering efforts. Embarking on a career when early harpsichord > repertoire was barely acknowledged, or else relegated to the piano, she > resolved to re-connect Baroque keyboard music to the instrument for which it > was written; in her own words 'to rid the harpsichord of its museum nature > and make it a living instrument.'\\" Pamela Nash, \\"Celebrating the 85th > Birthday of Zuzana Ruzickova\\", Sounding Board, June 2013.

Near the end of its existence, the organizations also used the names American Cadets and U.S. Junior Military Forces. The ABS was the rival of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) similar to the situation in the United Kingdom with Baden Powell's Boy Scouts and the British Boys Scouts who did not like the militarism of early British Scouting. For the most part there were only minor differences between the ABS and the BSA despite the BSA's charges that the ABS was drilling Scouts with rifles and Scouts were soliciting funds in uniforms. Purpose Among the objectives of the organization was to prepare boys for the obligations and duties of citizenship. History In May 1910, Hearst called an organizational meeting to form a new Scouting group. Hearst was aware of the Boy Scouts of America, formed months earlier by rival publisher William D. Boyce but pursued his own vision of Scouting and incorporated the ABS in June 1910 in New York along with James F. McGrath and James R. O'Beirne. Edgar M. Robinson and Ernest Seton requested that Hearst unite the ABS with the BSA but were rejected. In June 1910, the ABS started organizing the Department of New England which was operational in August or September under Chief Department Scout General William H. Oakes. Additional departments were also formed: Atlantic (New York City), Middle West (Chicago), Northwest (San Francisco) and Southwest (Los Angeles). The national committee members were also the officers of the Atlantic Department with Hearst as president, Jefferson M. Levy first vice president, Charles P. Devare second vice president, James R. O'Beirne treasurer and James F. McGrath secretary. The honorary vice presidents and founders included Col John Jacob Astor, William K Vanderbilt Jr., Major General Fred D. Grant, Lieutenant General Nelson A. Miles, General EA McAlpin, and Lieutenant General Adna R Chaffee. The American Boy Scouts of Rhode Island was founded by Charles E. Mulhearn on August 29, 1910, with the meeting of an executive committee. The next day, the Rhode Island committee requested a charter from the ABS New England Department Headquarters. Hearst had conflicts with the ABS directors over the methods of financing and the improper and unauthorized use of his name for the solicitation of money. He also expressed his disdain at fund raisers being allowed to keep 40% of funds raised without his knowledge. Hearst and other leaders resigned in December 1910. General James O'Beirne, the ABS treasurer, replaced Hearst as president. Hearst referred the matter to the District Attorney which the organization claimed was over Hearst's dismissal. A grand jury was formed and the ABS indicated that they would sue Hearst for making a false statement. Citing ABS mismanagement, the New England Division left the ABS in 1910 and formed the New England Boy Scouts. On March 12, 1911, the Rhode Island group voted to break away from the American Boy Scouts and formed the Rhode Island Boy Scouts. The ABS joined the Order of World Scouts in 1911. In August 1911, General Edwin A. McAlpin was elected national president and Chief Scout. In March 1912, an ABS Scout in uniform shot and killed a boy with a rifle after a Scout function. Remington Arms designed the 4S Boy Scout Rifle and advertised it as the \\"Official Rifle of the American Boy Scouts\\" and sold it from 1913 to 1914. =United States Boy Scout= The American Boy Scouts were often confused with the Boy Scouts of America, which sometimes caused problems with fund raising and misattributed publicity. The ABS board of directors voted in October 1913 to change the name of the organization to the United States Boy Scout (USBS), primarily to prevent the confusion. In 1915, BSA President Livingston claimed that the USBS carried guns as part of the program. In 1916, the USBS sought but did not receive a federal charter. After the BSA received a federal charter in 1916, Chief Scout Executive James E. West pressed the USBS to change its name without success. The BSA filed a lawsuit for an injunction order to restrain the USBS from using the term \\"Boy Scout\\" in 1917. L.W. Amerman, executive officer and treasurer, acknowledged that the USBS was a more military organization than the ABS. It was also alleged that the USBS had used the names of prominent men on its letterhead, such as Elbert Henry Gary, in their fund raising efforts without permission and that donations or endorsements were made to the USBS in the mistaken belief that they were the BSA. The BSA was represented by Charles Evans Hughes, former Governor of New York and former U.S. Supreme Court Justice. Testimony included an affidavit from Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the international Scout Movement, on the origins of the Scout Movement. In 1919, the New York Supreme Court, a trial court, granted the BSA an injunction and the USBS was barred from using the terms \\"Boy Scout\\", \\"Scout\\", \\"Scouting\\", or any variation thereof. =Dissolution= The organization changed its name and carried on for a few more years as the American Cadets and the U.S. Junior Military Forces before finally dissolving.

Plot The manga is about a high school student Yuu Sakagami who, raised separately, is reunited with his mother, Misako, and his sister, Eri, who both become infatuated with him. When Yuu becomes sexually aroused his inner demons take over and he is unable to control his actions, and the women in his family, his English teacher from America, and a female neighbor (who is later revealed to be the boy's aunt), are quick to take advantage of this. The situations and humor are similar to the non-sexual manga, Ranma ½, but nearly always have a sexual focus. Yuu starts out having slept with his sister Eri, but eventually one night he and both his mother and sister get drunk and they have a threesome. The insanity continues when Yuu gets disgusted with what he is doing and leaves the house, only to be taken in by his English professor, who seduces him. This ends with him swearing to give up sex because of how he gives in to his dark desires. Next we find Yuu and Eri making wishes for what appears to be New Year's, Yuu wanting to \\"get it on\\" with a woman, Miss Sakura. Eri later witnesses said woman having sex with a man, but doesn't tell Yuu. Yuu decides to get his fortune told, and it comes back with these words; \\"Doom. Death. Defeat. Despair.\\" Also it has a tiny message at the bottom; \\"sorry, kid\\". Next we see an encounter between Yuu and Misako, in which Yuu is eating food made by Misako. Misako is wearing nothing under her apron, and tries to seduce Yuu. Yuu tries in vain to keep from getting aroused, but Misako sits on his lap and that's that. Yuu envisions his \\"reason\\" getting run over by a train marked \\"instinct\\" and it's off to the races again. Yuu and Misako have sex, after which Yuu looks in horror on what happened and comments that he's going to hell. Yuu and Eri next arrive home to find their mother passed out after a session of phone sex with her boyfriend. This ends with Eri seducing Yuu again and Yuu giving in once more. Next, Yuu has an encounter with the woman next door, who has the nickname \\"virgin killer\\". She mistakes Yuu for a virgin and seduces him using special chocolates. Yuu gives in to instinct again and has sex with her. During her climax it is revealed that the woman next door is actually his aunt. When Yuu gets home, Eri accosts him with an even larger batch of more potent love chocolates. Yuu then has another encounter with his Mom, Misako, in which she forces his darker side to stay active so she can have sex with him. Yuu has sex with Eri again, in which he violates her against her will and hurts her pretty badly. Misako talks with Yuu and it is revealed that Yuu's dad had the same problem Yuu does, and that it why he's not around anymore. Misako implores Yuu to keep control saying that it is all a matter of willpower. Yuu ponders this and envisions a battle within his mind between Reason and Instinct, both attractive women in this vision, the actual \\"battle\\" being a lesbian scene between the two. Yuu eventually chooses Reason, and he defeats his dark side. He wakes up and Misako tells him he has won, but soon realizes the regular Yuu is a virgin. She teaches him all about sex in a last encounter, and Yuu goes back to being himself. The story ends with Yuu stating how far he is come since that time, and admitting that he and Eri still have sex. Publication One of the most cited hentai titles about incest, Super Taboo is the name given by the English translation of the manga Super Family Complex. Super Family Complex, whose abbreviation is a pun on \\"Super Famicom\\", the original name of the Super Nintendo, was originally published in Japan into two tankōbon volumes by Fujimi Publishing between 1993 and 1994. An English translation was released in twelve issues published between 1995 and 1996 by Fantagraphics Books through its Eros Comix imprint. The series was republished into two collected editions by Fantagraphics between 1998 and 1999. Fantagraphics also published two related series, Super Taboo Extreme and Super Taboo XXX, each in a series of five issues published in 2001 and 2006, respectively. The latter was forbidden to be acquired in Canada by its Border Services Agency because it qualifies as obscene under Canada's Criminal Code. Both series, originally titled and , were originally published in a single volume each in 1999 and 2002, respectively. Bakara was republished by Fujimi Publishing in 2014. Reception Derek Guder, writing for Manga: The Complete Guide, affirmed \\"the art and the sex are both extremely simple\\", comparing its character designs to a Sunday paper's one. However he praised it mainly because of its humor sense that makes it stands out and keeps it \\"from being just a simply drawn romp between family members\\". Timothy Perper and Martha Cornog in Sexuality & Culture said Super Taboo and Super Taboo Extremes \\"plots have no relationship to the realities of incest, but present an amused and sardonic vision of the foibles and powers of sexual desire\\". They also argue that \\"the humor serves to reduce reader anxiety about prohibited desires at the same time the fantasy setting makes it clear that one should not—and need not—emulate the characters\\".

She was scrapped in 1931. History Shirk was named for James W. Shirk. She was laid down on 13 February 1919 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, San Francisco, California; launched on 20 June 1919; sponsored by Miss Ida Lawlor Dunnigan; and commissioned on 5 February 1921, Lieutenant Commander G. M. Ravenscroft in command. Shirk arrived in her homeport, San Diego, California, on 7 March 1921 and, after three weeks of exercises, was placed in reserve there until October. She conducted exercises off San Diego from late in the year until sailing with the fleet on 27 June 1922 for exercises off Puget Sound. The ship returned to San Diego on 19 September and resumed operations there. Shirk departed San Diego on 6 February 1923 with the fleet and participated in combined exercises off Panama from 26 February to 31 March. Returning to San Diego on 11 April, she underwent overhaul at Mare Island from 9 July to 1 September and resumed operations at San Diego on 9 September. She sailed again with the fleet on 2 January 1924 and transited the Panama Canal on 19 January. Between 23 January and 3 February, she called at Veracruz, Mexico (where the cruiser had been wrecked on 16 January), and at Tampico, before rejoining the fleet at Culebra on 10 February. On 1 March, she departed the Canal Zone for Mare Island, where she was overhauled between 19 March and 7 May. Between 26 June and 12 July, she acted as plane guard for aircraft flying from San Diego to Seattle and rejoined the fleet in Puget Sound on 13 July. She returned to San Diego on 1 October. On 27 April 1925, Shirk arrived at Pearl Harbor with the United States Fleet for combined exercises. On 1 July, the Battle Fleet sailed on a goodwill cruise to the Southwest Pacific, and Shirk visited Melbourne; Lyttelton and Wellington; and American Samoa before returning to San Diego on 26 September. She was overhauled at Mare Island from 11 January to 26 February 1926 and operated out of San Diego until departing on 14 June for summer exercises off Washington. She returned to San Diego on 1 September 1926 and again received repairs at Mare Island from 30 December 1926 to 4 February 1927. On 7 February 1927, Shirk sailed from San Diego and participated in exercises off Panama and, after transiting the Canal on 5 March, operated in the Caribbean with the fleet. She departed the Caribbean on 22 April and visited New York, and conducted a joint Army and Navy exercise in Narragansett Bay before arriving at Hampton Roads on 29 May 1927 for the Presidential review. She arrived in the Panama Canal Zone on 9 June 1927 for duty off Nicaragua with the Special Service Squadron, protecting lives and property of American and other foreign nationals there supporting peacekeeping operations. She patrolled off Nicaragua from 1 to 23 July, and returned to San Diego on 23 August. During operations off San Diego, she rescued a disabled man on SS Georgian and carried him into port on 29 August. Shirk underwent overhaul at Mare Island from 26 February to 11 April 1928 and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 28 April with the fleet, having participated in Fleet Problem VIII en route. She returned to San Diego on 23 June and operated there for the rest of the year. Between 27 January and 6 February 1929, she participated in fleet exercises off Panama, and then underwent overhaul at Mare Island from 24 February to 20 June. Fate She then operated at San Diego until she was decommissioned there on 8 February 1930. Shirk was struck from the Navy list on 22 July 1930, scrapped at Mare Island, and her hulk sold there on 27 January 1931 to P. J. Willett. As of 2012, no other U.S. Navy ship has been named Shirk.

It is the biggest general aviation airport in the Netherlands. The first flights were in 1971 and it became an official airport in 1973. Schiphol Group became owner of the airport in 1993. It is home to the aviation museum Aviodrome, which has a former KLM Boeing 747-200 on display. The airport serves Lelystad, the province of Flevoland and Amsterdam.  History  In 1966 it was decided that the newly created Flevopolder required a central airport. A suitable location with room for future expansion was found to the south of Lelystad. The first flights from this location took place in 1971, but it was not until 1973 that it received official status as an airport. At first Lelystad had grass taxi- and runways, but it was found that the clay could not support the traffic, as tracks started to form. Because of the often poor condition of the terrain, the airport suffered from frequent closure. To resolve this problem, in 1978 the first of the taxiways was hardened and in 1981 the runway was hardened. In 1991 the runway length was increased to , to try to attract more business aircraft. A Jetstream 32 from AIS Airlines at Lelystad Airport with aircraft of AIS Flight academy in the background In 1993 the Schiphol Group became the owner of the airport. The Aviodrome museum moved to Lelystad Airport from Schiphol in 2003. Local flying school AIS Flight Academy started an airline in 2009, AIS Airlines, and is still headquartered at Lelystad Airport, although they do not operate any scheduled flights from Lelystad. Because of the museum, various aviation events are frequently held at the airport. Expansion An expansion of the airport is underway. The runway (05-23) is being extended to a total length of 2700 meters with a TORA of 2460 meters and an ASDA of 2700 meters, which is long enough to facilitate all aircraft of the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 families and also is suitable for operations with wide bodies like the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 although not at maximum take off weight. The ILS (instrument landing system) was tested in June 2018. The new terminal will be built in phases, easily expandable when the airport grows. In 2018 the terminal building will be finished, capable of handling 25,000 flights per year. The building can be doubled on the RDW-location, capable of handling eventually up to 45,000 flights (7 - 8 million passengers per year). The same strategy is used for the airside apron with the aircraft stands, starting with 4 stands and ending up at 12 stands or more. The number of allowed aircraft movements is much discussed in the Netherlands and will start the first year of operation at only 4,000 per year, which means only around 11 movements daily. In 2021 and 2022, 7,000 and 10,000 flights respectively will be allowed. The air routes are not capable for more flights, because of Schiphol air routes. In 2023 the air routes to all Dutch airports will be changed to make more flights to Lelystad Airport possible. The low maximums for the first years are expected to be discussed much more in the upcoming months/years as the demand is much higher than that because of the fast growth of air travel to the Netherlands. Other airports, like Amsterdam Schiphol, Rotterdam and Eindhoven, are already reaching their maximum allowed number of flights. Discussion includes raising the number of allowed flights to Amsterdam Schiphol airport of 500,000. Legally Lelystad airport is allowed up to 45,000 movements of passenger flights per year in the future. General aviation flights do not count for this maximum of Lelystad Airport. The airport will have its own exit from the A6 motorway, which connects with Amsterdam, with travel times around 40–45 minutes when traffic allows. A public bus service also takes travelers to the Lelystad Centrum railway station, where trains run frequently in the direction of Amsterdam (6 trains each hour), Schiphol Airport and The Hague (4 trains each hour), Zwolle and Groningen. The number of intercity trains to Amsterdam and Schiphol will be raised to six each hour in a few years. Parking lots with a capacity of 3,000 cars are planned for the first phase and will be close to the terminal. In the future more parking lots will be constructed at the RDW-location next to the airport. A 10-year concession for all handling (landside and airside) is awarded to Viggo, a Dutch handling company which has run all handling at Eindhoven Airport successfully for many years. The expansion of Lelystad Airport was driven by the fact that the main airport in the Netherlands, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, is at its maximum allowed aircraft movements of 500,000 and will need to focus on transfers passengers by the KLM group and partners and freight flights. Lelystad Airport is conveniently designed for passengers who have Amsterdam/The Netherlands as their destination, as well as being conveniently located, being 67 km away from main Amsterdam by road. Therefore, Transavia and Ryanair already expressed interest in operating from the airport. Dutch tour operator Corendon also wants to fly from Lelystad Airport, starting with one airplane having its base at the airport.

In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006), the Court ruled that the military commissions as set up by the United States Department of Defense were flawed and unconstitutional. DOD continued to hold Hamdan as an enemy combatant at Guantanamo. After passage of the Military Commissions Act of 2006, Hamdan was tried on revised charges beginning July 21, 2008, the first of the detainees to be tried under the new system. He was found guilty of \\"providing material support\\" to al Qaeda, but was acquitted by the jury of terrorism conspiracy charges. He was sentenced to five-and-a-half years of imprisonment by the military jury, which credited him for his detention as having already served five years of the sentence. A Pentagon spokesman noted then that DOD might still classify Hamdan as an \\"enemy combatant\\" after he completed his sentence, and detain him indefinitely. In November 2008, the U.S. transferred Hamdan to Yemen to serve out the remaining month of his sentence. He was released by the government there on January 8, 2009, permitting him to live with his family in Sana. On October 16, 2012, Hamdan's entire conviction was overturned on appeal in the US Court of Appeals in Washington, DC, and he was acquitted of all charges. Hamdan and his brother-in-law Nasser al-Bahri were the subjects of the award-winning documentary, The Oath (2010), by the American director Laura Poitras, which explored their time in al-Qaeda and later struggles. Early life Salim Hamdan was born in 1968 in Wadi Hadhramaut, Yemen. He was raised as a Muslim. He married and had daughters with his wife. He went to Afghanistan to work, where he was recruited to al-Qaeda by Nasser al-Bahri, also a Yemeni. Hamdan had first worked on an agricultural project started by Osama bin Laden. He started working as his driver because he needed the money. Capture in Afghanistan Salim Hamdan was captured in southern Afghanistan on November 24, 2001. According to documents obtained by the Associated Press, he was captured in a car with four other alleged al-Qaeda associates, including Osama bin Laden's son-in-law. Three of the men were killed in a firefight with Afghan forces. The Afghans turned over Hamdan and the other surviving associate in the car to U.S. forces. Initially held in Afghanistan, he was transferred to then newly-opened Guantanamo Bay detention camp in 2002. Trial timeline On July 14, 2004, the Department of Defense formally charged Salim Ahmed Hamdan with conspiracy, for trial by military commission under the President's Executive Order of November 13, 2001. On October 22, 2004, General John D. Altenburg, the retired officer in overall charge of the commissions, removed three of the six original Military Commission members to avoid the potential of bias. On November 8, 2004, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia halted Hamdan's military commission because no \\"competent tribunal\\" had determined whether Mr Hamdan was a POW (as required by the Geneva Conventions), and because regardless of such determination, the commission violated the procedures of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). The Bush administration appealed the ruling. In the meantime, the Department of Defense started Combatant Status Review Tribunals of all the Guantanamo detainees to determine whether each was an enemy combatant or not. The tribunals extended from July 2004 through March 2005. On July 17, 2005, a three-judge panel on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned the lower court's ruling against the military commission, and supported the government. The panel said that the Geneva Convention does not apply to members of al-Qaeda. John Roberts, soon to be appointed as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, was then one of the judges on the Court of Appeals. He voted for the government's position. The military commissions were set back in motion at Guantanamo. Responding to an appeal by Hamdan's attorneys, on November 7, 2005, the Supreme Court issued a writ of certiorari, agreeing to review the decision of the DC Circuit Court. Roberts, now on the Supreme Court, recused himself due to his earlier participation in the case. On June 29, 2006, the Supreme Court ruled in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld that the military commissions had procedural flaws and were invalid, as they violated the UCMJ and protections of the Geneva Convention adopted in both the US civil and military systems of law. Supreme Court opinion On June 29, 2006, the Supreme Court ruled in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld. It also considered whether the Supreme Court had the jurisdiction to enforce the articles of the 1949 Geneva convention and whether Congress had the power to prevent the Court from reviewing the case of an accused enemy combatant before it was tried by a military commission, as had happened in this case. It asserted it had that authority. In a 5-3 plurality, the Court held that the military commissions lacked \\"the power to proceed because their structures and procedures violate both the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949.\\" (As the US had signed them, it effectively adopted them as law.)[ Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, Supreme Court Syllabus], pg. 4., point 4. Specifically, the Court ruled that Common Article 3 of the Third Geneva Convention was the provision violated. In response, Congress passed the Military Commissions Act of 2006, at the request of the Bush administration, to provide the authority for the executive branch to create and operate the commissions and to respond to concerns of the Supreme Court. President George W. Bush signed it on October 17, 2006. Hamdan's trial was scheduled to begin in June 2007. Charged under the Military Commissions Act After having been detained for five years at the Guantanamo camp, Hamdan was charged under the new act on May 10, 2007, with conspiracy and \\"providing support for terrorism.\\" According to the Houston Chronicle, Lieutenant Commander Charles Swift, Hamdan's lawyer, argued that conspiracy charges were inappropriate for such junior people as Hamdan. Commander Jeffrey Gordon, a DoD spokesman, disputed the assertion that Hamdan was a \\"low-level player.\\" Charges dismissed In two separate military rulings, on June 4, 2007, the court dropped all charges against Hamdan and Omar Khadr, a Canadian citizen. Army Judge Colonel Peter Brownback and US Navy Judge Captain Keith J. Allred ruled that the men's Combatant Status Review Tribunals had simply confirmed the men's status as enemy combatants status. While the Military Commissions Act authorized the Guantanamo Military Commissions the authority to try \\"unlawful enemy combatants\\", the judges asserted that the commissions lacked the jurisdiction to try the men as \\"enemy combatants\\". This meant that all the detainees' cases would have to be reviewed to determine if each was an \\"unlawful enemy combatant\\", as only then could a detainee be tried under the MCA. James Westhead of the BBC said that the court ruling, which affects all 380 Guantanamo detainees, represented a \\"stunning blow\\" against the Bush administration's efforts to bring the detainees to trial. According to the BBC, following the rulings, the US government appeared to have three legal options: * Scrap the legal process and start again. * Redefine the inmates as \\"unlawful\\" enemy combatants at separate hearings. * Appeal the court ruling. No appeals court to review \\"military commission\\" decisions has yet been set up. (Later the Court of Military Commission Review was established for this purpose.) The Washington Post, reported that the ruling made it likely that passage would be achieved for a Senate bill restoring access to the US Court system to the Guantanamo captives. The Washington Post speculated that the ruling might force whatever trials take place to be administered in the existing systems of the civilian courts or the military courts under the courts martial system. Deemed an \\"illegal enemy combatant\\" On December 21, 2007, Judge Allred heard arguments, and ruled that Hamdan was an \\"illegal enemy combatant\\", who could thus be tried by a military commission. Lieutenant Brian Mizer, one of Hamdan's lawyers, said his team had introduced evidence: February 8, 2008 hearing A hearing was convened on February 8, 2008. =Mental stability= Hamdan's lawyers filed a request with Allred requesting the detainee be moved out of solitary confinement. They argued that prolonged solitary confinement was having such a negative effect on his mental stability that it was impairing his ability to assist in his own defense. The attorney Andrea Prasow wrote: His attorneys said he had been allowed only two exercise periods in the previous month. Hamdan had been housed in camp 4, the camp for the most compliant captives until December 2006. Captives in camp 4 wear white uniforms, sleep in communal dormitories and can use an exercise yard and mingle with other captives for up to 20 hours a day. After that date, he was moved to camp 5, where captives spend almost the entire day in isolation in a windowless cell. Emily Keram, a psychiatrist, examined Hamdan and, according to the Seattle Post Intelligencer: Hamdan's lawyers compared the treatment accorded to the Canadian citizen, Omar Khadr, with that accorded to Hamdan. They requested Allred to hear Khadr to explain why he was housed in Camp Four. They pointed out that Khadr had been allowed a phone call to his family. According to the International Herald Tribune, Hamdan's lawyers said =Missing records= Hamdan's Defense expressed a concern that the Prosecution had been withholding some of the detainee's records from them. Lieutenant Commander Timothy Stone told Allred that they had turned over copies of records, except for those from 2002—which they had been unable to locate. He assured Allred they were still looking for them. Chief Prosecutor Colonel Lawrence Morris suggested that the missing files contained \\"generally innocuous stuff\\". =Access to the high-value detainees= In February 2008, Hamdan's lawyers requested access to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the thirteen other high value detainees in order to gather more information for their defense, which Morris opposed. Allred postponed ruling on Hamdan's lawyer's request. Boycott On April 29, after seven years of cooperation, Hamdan announced he was joining the ongoing detainee boycott of Guantanamo Military Commissions, saying: > America tells the whole world that it has freedom and justice. I do not see > that ... There are almost 100 detainees here. We do not see any rights. You > do not give us the least bit of humanity ... Give me a just court ... Try me > with a just law.Colson, Deborah.\\"Another Boycott at Guantánamo, Another Test > for the Military Commission System\\", Human Rights First, April 30, 2008 July trial Hamdan's trial began on July 21, 2008. =Jury selection= Thirteen candidates for the military commission jury went through voir dire. Six jury members, and an alternate, were selected on July 21, 2008. Reuters reported that the jurors identities were being kept secret. An officer who knew the captain of the , which was bombed by terrorists, was turned down. Reuters reported he was a former police officer. =Not guilty plea= Hamdan pleaded not guilty to all charges. =Court proscribed evidence from testimony produced under coercion= According to USA Today Hamdan's Presiding Officer, Keith Allred, ruled that prosecutors could not use confessions Hamdan made when in American custody in Bagram Theater Internment Facility and a detention facility in Panjshir. At the time, he was subjected to what were described by the administration as enhanced interrogation techniques, more generally held to be torture. Carol Rosenberg, writing in the Miami Herald, reported that on July 28, 2008, prosecution witnesses \\"allege his crimes cover the era of the embassies car bombings and a suicide attack by an explosives-laden boat on the USS Cole in 2002, even though he neither plotted nor knew about the terror attacks beforehand.\\" On July 24, 2008, Michael St. Ours, a Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) agent, testified that Abdellah Tabarak had been in charge of Osama bin Laden's security detail. According to Rosenberg of the Miami Herald, St. Ours \\"looked stunned\\" when Hamdan's defense counsel said that Tabarak had been released without charge. Andrew Cohen, a legal affairs commentator for CBS News, called the testimony that Tabarak had been released a \\"colossal embarrassment\\" to the government. Hamdan's prosecution did not provide documents from the detainee's interrogations until July 28, 2008. One confirmed Hamdan's account that female interrogators had subjected him to sexual humiliation during earlier interrogation. Harry H. Schneider Jr., said that after reading this document, he found Hamdan's account of sexual humiliation was \\"right on the money\\". The prosecutor John Murphy disputed that what the interrogation document described should be described as coercion. He said: \\"It casts a sort of black cloud over the agents and those who work with detainees, and what's been put forth doesn't show it.\\" =Robert McFadden's testimony = The defense tried to block the admission of testimony by Robert McFadden, a former FBI agent who had interrogated Hamdan. The Presiding Officer had already ruled that the testimony of most of Hamdan's first interrogators at Guantanamo was inadmissible, due to their use of coercive techniques. On July 29, 2008, the Presiding Officer ruled that he was going to penalize the Prosecution for failing to release documents to the Defense by disallowing McFadden's testimony from May 2003. The key testimony expected from McFadden was his having heard Hamdan confirm that he had sworn \\"Bay'ah\\", a kind of oath of fealty, to Osama bin Laden. However, Judge Allred decided to allow McFadden's testimony. Conviction and acquittal The jury acquitted Salim Ahmed Hamdan of conspiracy and convicted him of material support for terrorism. While he was waiting for the decision, he was allowed his first call to his family in Yemen. It was the 107th call made by a detainee. Sentencing On August 7, 2008, Hamdan was sentenced by the military jury to five and a half years (66 months) imprisonment. Prosecutors had urged a sentence of 30 years-to-life, while Hamdan's defense had recommended less than 45 months. At the time he was already credited for having served 61 months, so the sentence imposed five months additional imprisonment. A Pentagon spokesman noted that Hamdan's status could revert to \\"enemy combatant\\" after his sentence was served, and as such he could be indefinitely detained. Allred, the Presiding Officer of his Commission, called Hamdan a \\"small player,\\" and said this sentence meant Hamdan would be eligible to having his continued detention reviewed by an Administrative Review Board (a form of appeals court) when his sentence was completed. He told Hamdan: > I hope the day comes that you return to your wife and daughters and your > country, and you're able to be a provider, a father and a husband in the > best sense of all those terms. Reactions Former Chief Prosecutor, Air Force Colonel Morris Davis commented: *\\"The decision showed what the jury thought Hamdan was worth.\\" *\\"There is a perception that trying people in front of the military was going to be a rubber-stamp process. This shows they are conscientious, following instructions and are making rational decisions.\\" According to the Associated Press, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Detainee Affairs Charles \\"Cully\\" Stimson wrote an e-mail regarding the sentence: > The lesson I hope the government learns from this case, among other things, > is ... don't bring skimpy or weak charges of conspiracy. The American Civil Liberties Union's spokesman Ben Wizner, said: > If the government heard the jury's message, it will not use a flawed war > court to prosecute conduct that does not violate the laws of war. On August 10, 2008, Josh White, writing in the Washington Post, reported that in late 2006, the Hamdan prosecution and defense had discussed a plea deal. He reported that Charles \\"Cully\\" Stimson, then the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Detainee Affairs, had agreed to make a case for a negotiated sentence of ten years. According to White, Stimson said more senior Bush officials \\"were stubborn\\" and \\"rejected the notion of a 'mere 10 years.'\\" On August 11, 2008, Jess Bravin of the Wall Street Journal reported on interviews with one of Hamdan's jurors. The juror said the verdict was not intended to be a rebuke to the Bush administration, rather, \\"...it came down to the evidence that we were allowed to see.\\" Request for new sentencing hearing On September 26, 2008, Army Colonel Lawrence Morris, Guantanamo's Chief Prosecutor, asked for a new sentencing hearing for Hamdan. He asked that Hamdan not be granted credit for time served, and serve an additional six years. The Department of Defense continued to say that it could continue to hold enemy combatant captives as detainees after they served their sentences assigned by the Military Commissions. Hamdan's military lawyer, Lt. Cmdr. Brian Mizer said: > The government, having stacked the deck, is now complaining about the hand > it was dealt. On October 31, 2008, Judge Allred ruled that Hamdan's sentence would not be reconsidered. Return to Yemen In November 2008, the United States transferred Hamdan to Yemen, where the government had agreed to keep him in custody until he served the remaining month of his sentence. His family were not allowed to meet him at Sanaa International Airport.\\"Bin Laden driver arrives in Yemen\\", Al Jazeera, November 26, 2008 Chuck Schmitz, one of Hamdan's translators in Guantanamo, has been asked by a publisher about co- writing a book with Hamdan about his experiences. A Fulbright Scholar when asked in 2004 to translate for Hamdan, Schmitz is now a Professor at Towson University. Appeal and dismissal of charges  Hamdan continued to appeal his conviction after his release. It was upheld in 2011 by the Court of Military Commission Review and appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On October 17, 2012, that Court vacated Hamdan's conviction, on the grounds that the acts he was charged with under the Military Commissions Act of 2006 were not war crimes by international law at the time he committed them. This meant that his prosecution was ex post facto and unconstitutional. Decided by a three-judge panel, the decision was written by Judge Brett Kavanaugh, with judges David Sentelle and Douglas Ginsburg largely concurring.

The Backs is a picturesque area to the east of Queen's Road in the city of Cambridge, England, where several colleges of the University of Cambridge back on to the River Cam, their grounds covering both banks of the river. Simon Jenkins rates the view of The Backs and King's College as one of the top ten in England.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/countryside/10341432/Our- glorious-land-in-peril.html The name alt= The name \\"the Backs\\" refers to the backs of the colleges. The area consists of the rear grounds of the following colleges (north to south): *St John's — buildings on both sides of the river, spanned by the St John's kitchen bridge and the Bridge of Sighs *Trinity — buildings on the east bank, spanned by Trinity bridge. *Trinity Hall — buildings on the east bank but with no rear grounds on the west bank. *Clare — buildings on the east bank, spanned by Clare bridge. *King's — buildings on the east bank, spanned by King's bridge. *Queens' — buildings on both sides of the river, spanned by the Mathematical Bridge. Historically, much of the land was used by the colleges for grazing livestock or growing fruit. Cattle can still be found grazing behind King's College. The river was also an important commercial thoroughfare to the mill at Silver Street. History One of the earliest drawings of The Backs, contained in a plan of Cambridge engraved by Richard Lyne in 1574. Lancelot Brown, 1779. St John's College's New Court (left) was the first major college building built on the west side of the River Cam.New Court - St John's College In the 16th century, the area consisted of pasture, gardens and orchards owned by colleges of the University, with wooden bridges across the Cam. Over time, the colleges planted avenues of trees and built sturdier bridges. In 1772, St John's College consulted English landscape architect Lancelot (\\"Capability\\") Brown (1716–1783), who laid out a \\"wilderness\\" on the college side of Queen's Road which still exists today. In 1779, Brown presented a plan to the University of Cambridge to create country-house style parkland with its focus on King's College's Gibbs Building. The plan would have involved removing avenues, transforming the river into a lake, and planting clumps of trees to screen the other colleges. It was never implemented, possibly because it would have removed historic college boundaries and three important bridges. In response to many elm trees succumbing to Dutch elm disease, a Backs Committee was formed in 1979 so that a joint approach could be taken to the problem facing The Backs. As a result of the committee's work, trees were cut down and new ones planted in their place. However, the committee stopped meeting in 1994. In 1995, English Heritage listed The Backs as a Grade 1 Historic Park. Present-day and future development King's College, looking north. In the 2000s, six University colleges on The Backs commissioned Robert Myers, a landscape architect who had studied at Girton College, to prepare a new landscape management plan for the area. The report, entitled The Backs Cambridge Landscape Strategy, was completed in November 2007 and released on 1 December 2007. It sets out proposals for the evolution of The Backs over the next 50 years. Myers' proposal is to improve the \\"legibility, coherence and visual quality of the landscape as a whole\\"The Backs Cambridge Landscape Strategy, above, para 5.8 on page 19. by retaining and enhancing the existing structure of the landscape and sight lines, while screening off the traffic on Queens Road. Over-mature and inappropriately-sited trees will be removed and new ones planted. In addition, there will be a phased replacement of avenues, an extension of the \\"wilderness\\" planting behind St John's and along the edge of Queens Road, and the creation of a \\"wildlife corridor\\". In particular, as regards Queens' Green at the southern end of The Backs, which is owned by Cambridge City Council, there is a proposal to extend an existing avenue of beech trees to the Queens Road to create an additional \\"rung\\" to the \\"ladder effect\\" created by other tree avenues, and to plant more trees and wilderness to partly enclose a stretch of grass. The colleges are currently in consultation with the City Council and English Heritage regarding the report, and if it is approved will carry out the suggested work in their own time using their own funds. In December 2007, The Daily Telegraph reported that \\"there has been a remarkable degree of consensus between institutions [i.e., the colleges of the University owning parts of The Backs] well known for prizing their autonomy\\".

The program was an exclusive showcase for hip hop music videos, and features interviews with and freestyles from popular rappers, and often has guest DJs serve as co-hosts. History =Conception= The show was created by former BET VJ/producer Alvin Jones, a.k.a. \\"The Unseen VJ\\". This was a spin-off of the \\"Rap Week\\" segment of Video Vibrations, also hosted by \\"The Unseen VJ\\". While its competitor Yo! MTV Raps, which is now discontinued, mainly focused on all of the popular rappers, Rap City also included videos from up and coming underground rappers. In the Spring of 1999, Stephen G.Hill President of Music Programming took Rap City from its format as a traveling show that went into the cities of the hottest rappers in the country, to a in studio format. Stephen G. Hill along with Senior Producer Craig Henry and Producer John Tucker was credited with creating a new show to fit a studio format the show was re-titled Rap City: Tha Basement Senior Producer Craig Henry created a 360° basement set that gave the illusion of a real basement and not a studio set. Producer John Tucker is noted for creating the iconic performance in the bathroom that became “The Booth”. =Hosts and timeslots= Among notable previous hosts of the show are Chris Thomas (the first host of the show from 1989–1991). Throughout his run, Thomas was also known as \\"The Mayor of Rap City\\", or simply \\"The Mayor\\". Other hosts included Hans Dobson aka Prime (1989–1993), Prince Dejour (1991–1994), Joe Clair (1994–1999), Leslie Segar (a.k.a. Big Lez) (1994–1999), Big Tigger (1998–2005), Mad Linx (2005–2006), J-Nicks (2005–2006) and Q-45 (2006–2008). On September 13, 1999, Stephen G.Hill President of Music Programming along with Senior Producer Craig Henry and Producer John Tucker credited with creating a new show to fit a studio format for Rap City the show was re-titled Rap City: Tha Basement and newly hosted by Big Tigger (a.k.a. Tigger), who succeeded Joe Clair and Big Lez. On August 28, 2000, BET moved the show to a new time slot at 4 p.m. On January 18, 2005, the show was repackaged and host Big Tigger was replaced by Mad Linx, a DJ and radio personality. The transition was explained that Tigger's \\"mother\\" sold the basement and forced Big Tigger out to live with his father. On October 3, 2005, Mad Linx went on hiatus to host BET Road Show. For several months, the show was hosted by J-Nicks, a native of St. Louis. Occasionally, special guests (such as a hip hop star) would host Rap City. The network also shortened the shows run time from two to one hour. On December 28, 2005, BET returned the show to its original 5 p.m. time slot. Mad Linx returned to his weekday routine on February 2, 2006. J-Nicks left to work as a weekday radio DJ for WHTA Hot 107.9 FM in Atlanta. On August 14, 2006, Q45 replaced Mad Linx on the show. On September 25, 2006, the time slot for Rap City changed to 4 p.m., and then flipped back to 5 p.m. in October 2006. From that moment on, Q45 hosted the show on Weekdays. Mad Linx hosted Rap City Top 10 on Saturdays and Big Tigger hosted the show as Rap City Presents... specials. On September 17, 2007, BET changed the time slot of Rap City to 1 a.m. Eastern time. A time slot previously held by re-runs of The Parkers and other syndicated shows. In the timeslot that Rap City previously occupied, random music videos are now being shown. In October 2007, due to drop of ratings Rap City returned to its previous time slot at 5 p.m. In September 2008, Rap City obtained a new time of 3 p.m. =The Freestyle Booth= One of the most prominent and most popular segments of the show has been the freestyle booth. The was booth a was segment that was added when Rap City, becomes a studio format, renamed Rap City Tha Basement. Producer John Tucker is credited with creating the now iconic segment The Booth located in the basement bathroom, the elements gave a real grass roots raw feel the show. In these particular segments, the guests would lay exclusive new vocals on the spot. This came to place around Big Tigger's tenure, which also included a guest DJ every week. Seemingly, this concept was scrapped when \\"Tha Basement\\" concept left but it has since returned. This is now seen as a major staple of Rap City, although no hosts other than Joe Clair and Big Tigger have joined in during the freestyle sessions. On several occasions back in the early 2000s (decade), the freestyle booth was mostly, if not completely uncensored. Also when special guests come and leave they leave with a signature, in the booth, on the wall. =Finale= On October 1, 2008, BET officially canceled Rap City, its last airing was Saturday, November 8, 2008, and was replaced by now-cancelled The Deal on November 10, 2008. On Friday, June 12, 2009, a Rap City: Relapse special was aired on BET hosted by Big Tigger with guest Eminem. On November 6, 2013, Rap City returned with another special called EM360 with guest Eminem to promote his album The Marshall Mathers LP 2.

It is located south east of Charing Cross. It lies within the Historic County of Kent. Located midway between Sidcup and Bexley, Albany Park is situated on high ground overlooking the valleys of the River Cray and the River Shuttle. Originally a rural area used as farmland, the settlement was established by a commercial housing developer, New Ideal Homesteads, during the 1930s. They built two estates at the site, Albany Park Estate and Royal Park Estate, which were sold at cheap prices to working-class families emigrating from Inner London. The company also brought about the foundation of Albany Park railway station in 1935, providing transport links to the estates along the Dartford Loop Line. Following decades saw a number of schools and both a Baptist church hall and an Anglican church constructed in the area, the latter of which has attracted attention for its architectural innovation. History The Albany pub, a Mock Tudor building created in the 1930s During the 1930s, New Ideal Homesteads were the largest commercial developer active in Northwest Kent, known for keeping costs at a minimum by using prefabricated materials. They built the Albany Park estate in the middle of that decade, on land that had formerly been the Tanyard and Hurst Farms, part of the estate of the Vansittart family who lived at nearby Foots Cray. Most of the area had consisted of fields and spinneys, although nearby there was both an eighteenth-century mansion known as Hurst or Hurst Place, and Sidcup cemetery, which had been established in 1912. The company invented the name \\"Albany Park\\" for the housing estate that they were constructing. They built at almost double the housing density that had been recommended to them by the local Bexley council, and sold their houses at low prices, enabling them to be purchased by working-class families leaving Inner London. The estate was adjacent to the Dartford Loop Line, which had existed 1866, although NIH ensured that Albany Park railway station was opened on this line in July 1935. Next to this station were built a number of shops and the Mock Tudor Albany Hotel. Just prior to the Second World War, NIH began expanding the settlement in a south-eastward direction by beginning to build the Royal Park Estate; it was finished after the war by Bexley Borough Council. NIH had advertised their estate with a sales brochure in which they stated that \\"the charming countryside shall permanently retain the rural character of its vistas and shall not suffer disfigurement in any way\\". The Hidden London website later commented that this claim was \\"implausible\\", characterising Albany Park as \\"a lacklustre pair of estates\\". In 1935, Hurst Council Infant School was opened on Dorchester Avenue, with an adjacent junior school being added the following year. The two were later merged as Hurst Primary School. In 1951, Kent County Council then opened Footscray Place County Primary School on Riverside Road in 1951; it was renamed and enlarged as Royal Park School in 1954. In 1954, the Hurst Place mansion was also taken over as a community centre. St. Andrew's, an Anglican church in the centre of the estate Local Anglicans living on the estates found that they were two miles from the nearest Anglican church, and urged the Church of England to aid them. In 1944 the vicar of All Saints Church in Footscray began holding Anglican communion services in a room over the shops in Lewis Road, but by 1946 they were using a hall in Wren Road for this purpose. In 1954 a vicar was appointed to the town, and the Anglican community subsequently secured a plot of land in the centre of the estate on which to build a church; construction began in 1964 and was completed the following year. The historian of architecture Nikolaus Pevsner later described it as \\"ingenious, fashionable and slightly absurd\\". In 1969, Albany Park was granted parochial status by the Church of England, a special dispensation given that the area contained far fewer than the 10,000 residents normally required for such status to be granted. In 1955, the local Baptists erected a church hall in Stansted Crescent; they had intended to construct a larger church, although this never materialised. In 2001, a number of trees were planted along the railway line adjacent to the south side of Canterbury Avenue, with the area named the Millennium Woodland. The shops on Norman Parade were later demolished and replaced by an apartment block with a convenience store; this was named Cedarwood Place and was constructed by the Belgravia Homes company. Geography Nearest places are: * Bexley * Bexleyheath * Sidcup * Foots Cray Transport Albany Park station serves the area with services to London Charing Cross and London Cannon Street via both Lewisham and Woolwich Arsenal as part of a loop service. There are also services to Gravesend. Albany Park is served by three Transport for London bus services, 229, 269 and B14.http://content.tfl.gov.uk/bus-route-maps/sidcup.pdf that connect the area with Bexleyheath, Sidcup, Bromley, Orpington and Thamesmead. Amenities Farmland to the north of the area Albany Park is served by two churches; the Baptist church in Stansted Crescent and the Anglican church of St Andrews which is situated on the corner of Maylands Drive and St Andrews Road and which was completed in 1965. There are a range of local shops which adjoin the main station entrance in Steynton Avenue. These include a number of restaurants and take-aways as well as two mini- markets, a dry cleaner, a hardware store, a pet supplies shop, a party and card shop and a hairdresser. The local pub, The Albany is also situated here as is a petrol station. Albany Park no longer has a GP surgery following the purchase of the one that had previously been situated in Longmead Drive by another local practice. After a short while, this was closed down and no alternative provision made. The building was subsequently sold and became a Vet's practice. The area's younger children are served by the Royal Park Primary School.

The story is about a rich Chinese man, Kin-Fo, who is bored with life, and after some business misfortune decides to die. Style The book is a traditional adventure, similar in style to Around the World in Eighty Days, which is one of the author's more well-known books. However, it does contain more humour as well as criticism of topics such as the British opium trade in China. Plot summary Kin-Fo is an extremely wealthy man who certainly does not lack material possessions. However, he is terribly bored and when news reaches him about his major investment abroad, a bank in the United States, going bankrupt, Kin-Fo decides to die. He signs up for a $200,000 life insurance covering all kinds of accidents, death in war, and even suicide; the philosopher Wang (Kin-Fo's old mentor) and Kin-Fo's fiancée are to be the beneficiaries. He rejects seppuku and hanging as means of dying, and is about to take opium laced with poison when he decides that he doesn't want to die without having ever felt a thrill in his life. Kin-Fo hires Wang (actually a former warrior of the Taiping Rebellion) to murder him before the life insurance expires. After a while news reaches Kin-Fo that the American bank he had invested in was not bankrupt, but instead had pulled off a stock market trick and is now wealthier than ever. Unfortunately, Wang has already disappeared. Together with two bodyguards assigned by the insurance company, and his loyal but lazy and incompetent servant Soun, Kin-Fo travels around the country in an effort to run away from Wang and the humiliation from the affair. One day he receives a message from Wang, stating that he can't stand the pain of having to kill one of his friends, and instead decided to take his own life while giving the task of killing Kin-Fo to a bandit he once knew. Kin-Fo, Soun and the two bodyguards now try to get to the bandit, planning to offer money in return for his life. The ship they travel with is hijacked, and they are forced to use their life vests with built-in sails to return to land. After being kidnapped by the bandit they were looking for, they are blindfolded and returned to Kin-Fo's home, where his old friends (including Wang, who we now find out staged this entire history to teach him a lesson about how valuable life is) are waiting for him. He marries his young, beautiful fiancée after all and they live happily forever after.  Translations  An English translation was serialized in The Leisure Hour in 1880.

Uesugi Tomosada of the Ogigayatsu branch of the Uesugi clan was joined by his more powerful relative Uesugi Norimasa, by Ashikaga Haruuji, the Kantō kubō in Koga, and by a host of anti-Hōjō daimyō from the Kantō region. Despite an overwhelming attacking force, numbering around 85,000, the 3,000 men in Kawagoe Castle's garrison, led by Hōjō Tsunashige, held off the siege until the relief force arrived. The relief force, numbering only 8,000, was led by Tsunashige's brother, Hōjō Ujiyasu. One warrior was sent to sneak past the Uesugi siege lines to inform the garrison of the relief's arrival. Though still strongly outnumbered, ninja spies informed the Hōjō forces that the attackers, Ashikaga Haruuji in particular, had relaxed their vigilance due to their overconfidence in victory. The Hōjō tried a risky tactic, coordinating a night attack between the garrison and the relieving force. Going against battlefield custom, the samurai were ordered to leave behind any heavy armor, which would slow them down and perhaps reveal their position, and to not bother taking the heads of their defeated enemies. This would deny the warriors much honor, as their triumphs would not be known or recorded, but the intense loyalty of the Hōjō samurai caused them to follow these orders. The tactic succeeded, Uesugi Tomosada was killed in battle, and the Hōjō foiled the siege. This defeat for the Uesugi would lead to the near-extinction of the family.

Mattel originally released the game as Armor Battle for its Intellivision console.  Gameplay  Armor Ambush is a game that gives players control over tanks that battle one another over terrain that offers varying degrees of texture and traversability. Dueling tanks was a theme familiar to owners of the Atari 2600 since Combat, the game packaged with nearly every Atari 2600 system, had a very similar premise. However, Armor Ambush expands upon the simple battles available to players of Combat. The game takes place on a different randomly selected battlefield each round. Additionally, players can drop mines on the battlefield by simultaneously pressing the fire button and pulling down on the joystick. The mines remain active for the duration of the battle, destroying either tank that runs over them. Players are able to control two tanks and switch between them on command. The terrain is more diverse, featuring areas of foliage, water, and natural barriers. But as with \\"Combat\\", there is no AI for the computer, and the game cannot be played solo.

Along with Hu Zongnan and Xue Yue, Tang was one of the Kuomintang generals most feared and respected by the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Life =Early life and war with Japan= Former residence of Tang Enbo in Nanjing. Born in 1898 in Wuyi, Zhejiang, Tang Enbo was a graduate of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, and therefore was familiar with the tactics of his Japanese enemy during the Second Sino- Japanese War. Tang's early resistance to the Japanese invasion was most ineffective, but this had nothing to do with his personal capabilities, but more to do with the political situation in China— Tang's superior Chiang Kai- shek was reluctant to devote his best troops to fight the Japanese invaders, wishing instead to use them to exterminate the Communists. Limited in troops and materiel, any commander would have had great difficulties in fighting such a superior enemy, and Tang Enbo was no exception. Furthermore, the battle plans though successful on paper rarely materialized on the battlefield during this stage because local Chinese warlords were only interested in maintaining their forces and largely ignored Chiang Kai-shek's orders. Although Tang did contribute to the victory at Battle of Taierzhuang, he was unable to stop the Japanese assaults during the 1944 Battle of Henan-Hunan-Guangxi, losing 37 cities and towns within 36 days. =Chinese Civil War= After World War II, Tang Enbo participated in the struggle against the communists, who attempted to win Tang Enbo. Tang was hesitant at the first due to his military failure in the Chinese Civil War, but soon his fourth concubine convinced him to firmly follow Chiang Kai-shek and stay with Kuomintang. As a result, Tang Enbo informed Chiang Kai-shek that his teacher and superior Chen Yi had asked him to turn to the communists and Chen was then arrested and later executed. Chen Yi was executed at Machangding, Taipei, on June 18, 1950 and was buried in Wugu, Taipei County. The fallout of all this was that Tang Enbo had now lost the trust of Chiang Kai-shek. Tang's position was further weakened when other Nationalist cadres such as Gu Zhenggang (谷正纲) discovered and revealed to Chiang Kai-shek that during the Shanghai Campaign Tang was preparing to flee to Japan by asking his close associates Wang Wencheng (王文成) and Long Zuoliang (龙佐良) to seek out a home in Japan. =Death= On May 6, 1949, a close friend of Tang's wired half a million US dollars to an American friend's account, and subsequently, the money was sent via this account to Wang Wencheng and Long Zuoliang in Japan. In July, 1949, Wang Wencheng and Long Zuoliang purchased a mansion with 22 rooms in a Tokyo suburb. However, all of this was accidentally made public on February 2, 1950 when Reuters issued the news in Tokyo claiming that Chiang Kai-shek had purchased a mansion in a Tokyo suburb via a top ranking Chinese official. It was rumored that Tang's political enemies within the Kuomintang had long been tracking Tang's every move and waited for the right opportunity to bring him down, but such a claim has yet to be confirmed. The result was Tang's complete falling out of favor with Chiang, who reportedly angrily shouted: \\"No wonder our defeat was so rapid in Shanghai and the southeastern coast— he (Tang Enbo) was already prepared to flee!\\" After fleeing to Taiwan with the retreating Republic of China government, Tang Enbo became ill and was sent to Japan for treatment. However, Tang died after surgery in Tokyo in 1954.

Matchmaker.com was the first online dating service. It was founded in 1986 and first operated via a bulletin board system. Members completed a questionnaire that enabled the platform to rank potential matches based on compatibility. History Matchmaker.com originated from a bulletin board system created by Gregory Scott Smith in San Antonio, Texas in March 1983. It began as a dial-up system running on a single Apple II+ with a modem. Shortly afterwards, it was ported to a Microsoft Xenix–based Tandy 6000 microcomputer and re-written in MBASIC, and then re- written again in C by programmer Jon Boede. It was originally conceived as a pen-pal network for everyone. There were no membership fees and the system operated on user donations. In 1985, the system was relocated to Houston, Texas and operated on four dial-up lines. The following year, two other systems were networked and allowed users in San Antonio, Texas and San Jose, California to join the \\"date-a-base\\". The original site started in 1986 was in the form of a bulletin board system. Each system catered to a geographic area (code) allowing users to find like interests. The original BBS based system only catered to local computer savvy users within a local telephone area code. However, exchange of email between systems and profiles was later implemented using sendmail and uuencoding making uucp and, ultimately the internet, the Matchmaker network backbone. The Matchmaker network was featured in the first edition of \\"!%@:: a directory of electronic mail addressing and networks\\" as one of the larger email networks prior to the rise of the Internet. In 1987, the software became available to franchise from the programmer, Jon Boede. The number of local systems grew to about a dozen, and became funded by user subscriptions. This business model allowed for each system to be moved into a commercial office environment for stability. In late 1992, the ASCII BBS style was extended to also be a telnet-based service, allowing access from anywhere in the world without the need for telephone long distance charges. A year later, the web-based front end was created. The first Matchmaker system to receive the new version was the largest of the communities at the time, \\"Christie's Matchmaker\\" (see below). Other Matchmaker franchises quickly also adopted the web based front-end. The site went online in 1996. Phil Moerschell, a founder and owner of multiple matchmaker franchises at the time, acquired the domain 'matchmaker.com' and began using it to link to the 15 matchmaker sites he was running. Matchmaker.com Stock Certificate in 1999. In 1998, each of the franchisees agreed to consolidate, centralize, and combine their resources. Matchmaker incorporated and relocated all of the Matchmaker servers to Bedford, Texas. In September 1998, the system became burdened by having to provide direct dial-in over modems and a decision was made to move to the Internet exclusively. At the height of the distributed franchise model in 1998, the number of national systems exceeded 60. An agreement was reached to centralize in Bedford, Texas and incorporate with the name Matchmaker.com. Private stock was issued and there were approximately 12 administrators and employees. Patrick M. O'Leary became the company's president. In 2000, Matchmaker was acquired by Lycos for $44.5 million cash. The site had 4 million users at that time. In February 2006, the site was purchased by Avalanche, LLC. In 2016, the site was shut down. See also * Carafano v.

It was written by Dennis Koble who also wrote Trick Shot, Solar Storm, and Shootin' Gallery for Imagic. Atlantis was ported to the Atari 8-bit computers, VIC-20, Intellivision, and the Magnavox Odyssey 2.\\"Atlantis\\". Moby Games. Retrieved on March 8th, 2009. The game was inspired by Taito's 1981 Colony 7 arcade game. Atlantis was the subject of Destination Atlantis, a video game competition in which players of the Atari 2600 version were encouraged to mail photos of their high scores to Imagic to receive a special edition of the game named Atlantis II.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot of the Atari 2600 version The player controls the last defenses of the City of Atlantis against the Gorgon invaders. The city has seven bases, which are vulnerable to attack. Three of these have firepower capabilities to destroy the Gorgon ships before they manage to fire death rays at one of the settlements. The gun bases have fixed cannons; the center base fires straight up, while the far left and far right bases fire diagonally upwards across the screen. The center cannon also creates a shield that protects the settlements from the death rays, so once the center cannon is destroyed, the remaining settlements become vulnerable to attack. The enemy ships pass back and forth from left to right four times before they enter firing range, giving an ample opportunity to blow them away. Lost bases can be regained by destroying enough Gorgon ships. Regardless of the player's efforts to avert the tragedy, Atlantis is doomed. The only way the game can end is when all bases are destroyed. However, a tiny ship then rises from the rubble and speeds away, making a connection with another Imagic game, Cosmic Ark. The Intellivision version features two gun turrets with a movable cursor that can be aimed onto enemy ships. There is also a deploy-able ship to take on enemies one-on-one. The game features day, dusk, and night settings, with the night setting limiting visibility to two moving searchlights. Destination Atlantis Destination Atlantis was a competition held by Imagic in 1982. Imagic invited players of Atlantis to take pictures of their high scores on their television screens and mail them to the company. Those who had the highest scores were then rewarded with a copy of Atlantis II. The latter game, rather than being a mass-produced sequel to Atlantis, was a special edition of the original featuring faster enemy ships which were worth fewer points. The concept behind this was to create a more difficult game that would \\"determine the true champion\\". As very few cartridges were created, Atlantis II is now a rare and highly valued collectors item. Prices as of 2010 can reach US$6000. Reception According to Dennis Koble, over two million Atlantis cartridges were sold, and it was Imagic's second biggest selling game. Video Games favorably reviewed the Intellivision version of Atlantis, calling it \\"a great shoot-'em-up for\\" the console. Antic liked the Atari 8-bit version's \\"very attractive and colorful\\" graphics, but said that gameplay \\"may take a bit of getting used to\\". The Atari 2600 version was a runner-up in the \\"Video Game of the Year\\" category at the 4th annual Arkie Awards.

It is geographically the largest of the 17 Wards of New Orleans. On the south, the Ninth Ward is bounded by the Mississippi River. On the western or \\"upriver\\" side, the Ninth Ward is bounded by (going from the River north to Lake Pontchartrain) Franklin Avenue, then Almonaster Avenue, then People's Avenue. From the north end of People's Avenue the boundary continues on a straight line north to Lake Pontchartrain; this line is the boundary between the Ninth and the city's Eighth Ward. The Lake forms the north and northeastern end of the ward. St. Bernard Parish is the boundary to the southeast, Lake Borgne farther southeast and east, and the end of Orleans Parish to the east at the Rigolets. While there is substantial overlap, the 9th Ward should not be confused with city planning designation of the ninth planning district of New Orleans. The 9th Ward includes land in planning districts 7, 8, 10, and 11 (not to be confused with New Orleans East, the 7th, 8th, 10th, and 11th wards .) Among the famous natives and residents of the 9th Ward are music legend Fats Domino, Magic, NBA player Eldridge Recasner, NFL Player Marshall Faulk, authors Kalamu ya Salaam and Poppy Z. Brite, actor John Larroquette, trumpeter Kermit Ruffins, and the prominent Batiste musical family. From 2012 to 2016, the 9th Ward was represented in the Louisiana House of Representatives by Democrat Wesley T. Bishop. When Bishop was elected in 2015 to the Louisiana State Senate, another Democrat, Jimmy Harris, a lawyer and long-term government employee, filled the District 99 state House seat. Monument arch commemorating 9th Warders who served in World War I is in the Bywater neighborhood of the 9th Ward Neighborhoods of the Ninth Ward The Ninth Ward can broadly be divided into three sections, from where the ward is divided from north to south by the Industrial Canal, and where the area east of the Industrial Canal is divided east to west by the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway/Mississippi River Gulf Outlet. * St. Claude * St. Roch * Bywater * Florida * Desire =Lower 9th Ward= The smallest of these pieces is the area south and east of these canals. The portion of the Ninth Ward along the river down-river from the Industrial Canal stretching to the St. Bernard line is called the \\"Lower 9th Ward\\" or \\"Lower Ninth\\". It includes the Holy Cross neighborhood, the twin Doullut Steamboat Houses and the Jackson Barracks. Until Hurricane Katrina, the Lower Ninth Ward had the highest percentage of black homeownership in the city. =Upper 9th Ward= The area west or \\"above\\" the Canal has sometimes been called the \\"Upper Ninth Ward.\\" Such distinctions arose when the Industrial Canal bisected the neighborhood in the 1920s. The portion of the Ninth Ward along the riverfront between Faubourg Marigny and the Industrial Canal is known as Bywater. Further back are the Infamous St. Claude and Florida area and Desire neighborhood. This part of the Ward contained two of the Housing Projects of New Orleans. The Desire neighborhood was home to the notorious Desire Projects, until they have demolished concurrent with HOPE VI policy. Just across Florida Avenue from that are the Florida Projects once stood. Nearby was the Agriculture Street Landfill, an old city dump that was covered over and made into a neighborhood of low-income housing, then became a Superfund toxic cleanup site. History Flooding after Betsy, 1965 The area along the riverfront was developed first, at the start of the 19th century, followed by the natural highland along Gentilly Ridge. The designation of this area as the \\"9th Ward\\" dates from 1852 when the Wards of New Orleans were redrawn as part of the reorganization of the city from three municipalities into one centralized city government. Along the lakefront were various fishing camps built on piers, the most famous collection being Little Woods. Such camps were common along the lakefront in the 19th and early 20th century, but the collection at Little Woods was the longest-lasting concentration, many surviving until Hurricane Georges in 1998. The area of the 9th Ward on the backside of St. Claude Avenue experienced the city's most significant and longest-standing flooding from the New Orleans Hurricane of 1915 due to a break in the protection levee at Florida Avenue. The Industrial Canal was dredged through the neighborhood at the start of the 1920s. Most of the area between Gentilly Ridge and Lake Pontchartrain was a swamp, not drained and developed until the mid and late 20th century. Lincoln Beach was an amusement park along the lakefront for African-Americans during the era of racial segregation. The nearby \\"Pontchartrain Beach\\" was the corresponding amusement area for whites. Parts of the 9th Ward flooded during Hurricane Flossy in 1956, and the Lower 9th Ward experienced catastrophic flooding in Hurricane Betsy in 1965. =Hurricane Katrina = 22 December 2005 view inland from the inner (southern) of the two major breaches in the lower side of the Industrial Canal levee & floodwall into the Lower 9th Ward, one of the more famous of the multiple levee failures which devastated much of the Ward at the time of Hurricane Katrina The 9th Ward neighborhood was thrust into the nation's spotlight in the aftermath of 2005's Hurricane Katrina. Much of the area on both sides of the Industrial Canal experienced catastrophic flooding. The majority of the damage was caused by storm surge. There were multiple severe levee breaks along both the MRGO and the Industrial Canal. Eastern New Orleans was flooded from multiple sources. The most severe was due to multiple breaches in the MRGO to the south. Some heavy waves during the storm topped the lake level to the north, which may have contributed to the flooding in some places. Lakefront Airport, outside the main protection levees, was heavily damaged by the surge from Lake Pontchartrain. Some water also overtopped a section of the Industrial Canal levee. Most of Eastern New Orleans experienced flooding, generally all areas except the Gentilly/Chef Menteur Ridge and Michoud areas. The Upper Ninth was flooded by the levee and floodwall failures near the Desire neighborhood, across the Industrial Canal from the junction with the MRGO. Flooding in this part of the ward joined with that of the bulk of the City's east bank to the west, with water flowing in from the London Avenue Canal breaches. The old high ground of the section of Bywater on the Mississippi River side of St. Claude Avenue was the only substantial neighborhood to escape significant flooding. A few areas on the very highest part of Gentilly Ridge and along the lakefront fill were also above the floodwaters. The Lower Ninth Ward flooded most catastrophically, with storm surge coming through two large breaches in the Industrial Canal flood protection system, creating violent currents that not only flooded buildings but smashed them and displaced them from their foundations. Floodwaters propelled the barge ING 4727 into the neighborhood on the other side of the levee from the Industrial Canal. During several days of the hurricane aftermath, live television news coverage from reporters and anchors who had little familiarity with New Orleans frequently included misinformation, such as referring to the Lower 9th Ward simply as \\"the 9th Ward\\" and misidentifying helicopter shots of the Industrial Canal breach as the 17th Street Canal breach (which was actually at the nearly opposite end of the city.) The Lower 9th Ward, not yet dry from Katrina, was re-flooded by Hurricane Rita a month later. During Mardi Gras 2006, the 9th Ward was a popular spot for visitors. The national attention the area received due to the hurricane and the events following the disaster provided Carnival revelers with an additional destination during their celebration. Visitors, however, were not the only ones to venture into the area. Locals flocked to the devastated neighborhoods of the ward as well. Hundreds of people gathered near the Florida housing project in the Ninth Ward on Fat Tuesday. In the quasi- celebratory spirit of a jazz funeral, many residents made their first trip back to take part in a massive block party in their former neighborhood. Blue house on N. Robertson St., Upper 9th Ward. The door reads, \\"We will be back.\\" Since Katrina, the 9th Ward has witnessed an uneven resurgence, with the Vietnamese community in New Orleans East establishing themselves as a dining destination and commercial hub, even as Vietnamese and other fishermen further down the Parish are suffering from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of April 20, 2010, and despite 2010 layoffs at NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility with the retirement of the space shuttle fleet. However, the Michoud Assembly Facility continues to be an source of employment as it is the site of fabrication of the core stage of the Space Launch System. Roads in the 9th Ward continue to improve. Streets neglected for years before Katrina have been resurfaced, such as St. Claude Avenue and Poland Avenue, Chartres Street and parts of Desire Street, but numerous smaller neighborhood roads remain a patchwork of potholes and uneven dips and humps. = 2015 shooting = A shooting took place at Bunny Friend playground on November 22, 2015.

Their home stadium is Bellavista, which they share with city rivals Técnico Universitario. History =Foundation= In July 1939, a group of young students from Colegio Nacional Bolívar gathered to form an independent sporting club, and shortly afterwards entered a minor tournament under the name 'Independiente'. However, in searching for further guidance, they talked to Army Captain Galo Molina (a student's relative) and together they formed Macará, naming the team after Ecuador's southern army stronghold. They offered the presidency to Mr. Jorge Vicente Alvarez, and he pronounced the following words: \\"Del Carchi al Macará... Macará ganará\\" (From Carchi to Macará... Macará will win); thus accepting the position. =The beginning of Primera A= Whilst Macará took part in Ecuadorian regional tournaments, the introduction of a National Championship saw them struggle to find a place among the best in the early 1960s. It took a while for the team to become strong and earn a permanent place in Primera A. Great players in the late 1960s and early and mid-1970s, such as Ítalo Estupiñán, Rómulo Dudar Mina, Arnaldo Sanchez Perrone (one of the best defenders Ecuador had in the late 1960s pretended from Barcelona of Guayaquil, Everest, and Ecuadorian Nacional team to play for his country in \`\`London World Cup\`\` in 1965) and Polo Carrera, made the team competitive. They were relegated in 1978 but eventually returned to Primera A. =80's decade: the peak= With such class players as Peruvian all-time great Germán Leguía, fellow countryman and international Juan Martín Caballero, Uruguayan playmaker Rodolfo Abalde and such leading Ecuadorian players as Geovanny Mera, Jorge Alvear, Angel Buenaño, Juan Carlos Suárez, Ricardo Porras and Milton Rodríguez; the team became serious title contenders in the late 1980s and, although never becoming champions, they were recognized as a great national footballing side that would on several occasions maul the country's greatest teams including Barcelona and Liga, and their classic rivals, Técnico Universitario. They also had an amazing ball boy named Edisson Velasquez who now lives a happy life with his wife and 13 year old kid. =The team since 1990= In the early 1990s, the team lost consistency and would eventually get relegated to Primera B in 1991, and to Segunda Categoría in 1992, although they only stayed there for one season. In 1998, the club won the second division championship, and was promoted to Primera A, under chairman Miller Salazar. The team consolidated its position in the 2000 season and the center forward, Christian José Bottero, finished as the top scorer in Primera in 1999. At this time they had a good group of players including Daniel Garrido, John Ordoñez, Lino Sánchez and Héctor Lautaro Chiriboga, that would remain for the next season. However, the Ecuadorian economic crisis of 1999 and 2000 was a painful hit for the club, and added to that, their key player, Lino Sánchez's, suffered an injury in 2000 that would finish his career. In 2002, the club was forced to sell their stars Garrido and Patricio Urrutia and their performance suffered and they were relegated from Primera A at the end of the year. After that, Miller Salazar was less effective as manager, and was replaced by young businessman Ricardo Callejas. He brought fresh ideas and much needed investment and introduced better financial management. The team acquired fine players in Matías Urbano and Oscar Pacheco, among others. However, the club sold Urbano to Deportivo Quito by midyear, due to the player being unprepared to play in a lower division league. The team earned promotion for the 2004 season. 2004 was an unsatisfactory year, because, although having good players in Cristian Mora and Oscar Monge and others, it became difficult for the team to reach the last 6's group and be in contention for the title and the expenditure for appointing renowned coach Dussan Draskovic did not succeed as well as was hoped. The 2005 season saw the team relegated but they would be back again to the first division by 2007. =Today= For the second half of the Ecuadorian Campeonato Nacional in 2007, Macará started with Roque Raúl Alfaro as coach, but lack of positive results had him and the team in a very difficult position. The base of national players had a fairly good performance in most of the games, particularly Luís M. Garcés, Marvín Pita and goalkeeper Jacinto Espinoza, not to mention U18 players, one of which just returned form the Panamerican Games in Rio de Janeiro with a gold medal; but the problem wasn't the nationals, the problems came from the foreign players, with the exception of defender Matías Gonzáles, who even scored a few times, the rest were a disappointment. Paraguayan striker Fabio Escobar was unstable, some games he had solid performances, like the one against Barcelona S.C in Guayaquil, where he performed his tactical role of distracting the opposition´ defense very well, but when it came to scoring, he wasted most of his chances, but to be fair, it might have been more the coach's fault for giving him duties he was not used to. The worst case was Mariano Monroy who never found his place on the field and looked lost in every single game he played; Lezcano was not everything the team needed him to be. With that scenario, the team's management decided it was time to part ways with Roque Raúl Alfaro. After he left, they signed Argentinian, Raúl Urquiza, who did a much better job on the last stretch of the tournament, lining up players that were overlooked by the former coach and contributing to the development of more effective plays, which reached its peak at Ibarra's Olympic Stadium on 3 October 2007, when Macara's offensive power burst in full force, scoring 4 goals in the first half and receiving just 1 in the second. Now, both teams were at risk of descending to section B of Ecuadorian first division, Macará had a better goal difference and there was still one more game left, another very favourable fact was that Imbabura had to play away against Deportivo Azogues in the south part of the country and Macará was hosting Emelec in Bellevista Stadium in Ambato. With a large number of fans cheering for them on 7 October 2007 and confirming their good moment, they defeated Emelec 2–0 and Macará had for the second year in a row, kept its place on the premier section of Ecuador's Campeonato Nacional. Considering that, next tournament would be much more competitive, given that there will be two more teams, game attendance is a must, because it is key to a team's spirit and positive attitude on the field, as well as from the city's business community where Macará has many fans and which could be a positive contributor in order to form a strong, competitive group of players. For 2008, Macará hired Colombian coach Jaime De La Pava to the club, and replaced a significant part of the squad. They saw three of their best players leave the club, Luis Miguel Garcés went to cash-rich Barcelona, Mariano Mina transferred to Deportivo Cuenca and Christian Botero switched to Universidad Católica, where he played for a few months before going into retirement (and swiftly returning to Macará as an academy coach). The team struggled for the major part of the first semester, which meant repeated fates for successively fired coaches De La Pava and Argentinian Jorge García. For the second part of the year, and with the arrival of Mario Jaquet to lead the coaching staff, Macará looked impressive and secured first place in their qualification group and consequently, earned themselves a place for the finals, something not achieved since 1989. However, Macará did not qualify for the Copa Libertadores de América. Jaquet was later confirmed as first team coach for the 2009 season. During the 2011 season, Macara was in Primera B and moved up as the runners up at the end of the season with its rival Tecnico Universitario. Kit Macará's kit manufacturer has been Marathon Sports since 2009 when they finished their relationship with Astro. Historically, Macará has had their kit produced by local and national manufacturers, but since late 1990s it has changed at the rate of almost a brand per year. These include: Marathon Sports, Puma, Diadora, Le Coq Sportif, Joma and Astro. The majors sponsor are Universidad Tecnológica Indoamérica, local footwear company Venus, Makrotubo, L. Gilbert, Hotel Casino Emperador and Ecuavisa, which also broadcasts the team's home games. As regards kit producers, the sponsorship deals vary from year to year, with the most recent main sponsors being Cerveza Pilsener, Banco del Pichincha, Mazda, Sunny Juices and Daihatsu. Rivalries The club has two major rivalries: fellow ground-sharers and city rivals Técnico Universitario, the derby games referred to as the Clásico Ambateño; and Centro Deportivo Olmedo with whom they contest the Clásico Interandino.

From 1948 to 1949 he served as Aide-de-camp to King George VI. He worked in the Royal Household as Marshal of the Diplomatic Corps from 1950 to 1961. When he retired he looked to combine his love of France with his home in Hambledon, Hampshire. As a result, in 1951 he planted an acre of vines (Seyval Blanc), which was later expanded and in 1954 produced the first crop. This was the first commercial vineyard in the UK for about twenty years and led to the now flourishing production of English wine. In the 1960s and 1970s 'Hambledon' became synonymous with English wine. He was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order on 20 December 1961.The London Gazette (22 December 1961) https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/42546/page/9297/data.pdf He wrote the biography of the distinguished French general, Jean de Lattre de Tassigny. He married Hilda Violet Helena de Bunsen, daughter of Sir Maurice de Bunsen, 1st Baronet on 10 November 1931. His daughter, Mariette Helena, married Nathaniel Fiennes, 21st Baron Saye and Sele.

This was the first successful gene mapping work and provides important evidence for the Boveri–Sutton chromosome theory of inheritance. The map shows the relative positions of allelic characteristics on the second Drosophila chromosome. The distance between the genes (map units) are equal to the percentage of crossing-over events that occurs between different alleles. Gene mapping describes the methods used to identify the locus of a gene and the distances between genes. Gene mapping can also describe the distances between different sites within a gene. The essence of all genome mapping is to place a collection of molecular markers onto their respective positions on the genome. Molecular markers come in all forms. Genes can be viewed as one special type of genetic markers in the construction of genome maps, and mapped the same way as any other markers. Genetic mapping vs physical mapping There are two distinctive types of \\"Maps\\" used in the field of genome mapping: genetic maps and physical maps. While both maps are a collection of genetic markers and gene loci, genetic maps' distances are based on the genetic linkage information, while physical maps use actual physical distances usually measured in number of base pairs. While the physical map could be a more \\"accurate\\" representation of the genome, genetic maps often offer insights into the nature of different regions of the chromosome, e.g. the genetic distance to physical distance ratio varies greatly at different genomic regions which reflects different recombination rates, and such rate is often indicative of euchromatic (usually gene-rich) vs heterochromatic (usually gene poor) regions of the genome. =Gene mapping= Researchers begin a genetic map by collecting samples of blood., saliva, or tissue from family members that carry a prominent disease or trait and family members that don't. The most common sample used in gene mapping, especially in personal genomic tests is saliva. Scientists then isolate DNA from the samples and closely examine it, looking for unique patterns in the DNA of the family members who do carry the disease that the DNA of those who don't carry the disease don't have. These unique molecular patterns in the DNA are referred to as polymorphisms, or markers. The first steps of building a genetic map are the development of genetic markers and a mapping population. The closer two markers are on the chromosome, the more likely they are to be passed on to the next generation together. Therefore, the \\"co-segregation\\" patterns of all markers can be used to reconstruct their order. With this in mind, the genotypes of each genetic marker are recorded for both parents and each individual in the following generations. The quality of the genetic maps is largely dependent upon these factors: the number of genetic markers on the map and the size of the mapping population. The two factors are interlinked, as a larger mapping population could increase the \\"resolution\\" of the map and prevent the map from being \\"saturated\\". In gene mapping, any sequence feature that can be faithfully distinguished from the two parents can be used as a genetic marker. Genes, in this regard, are represented by \\"traits\\" that can be faithfully distinguished between two parents. Their linkage with other genetic markers is calculated in the same way as if they are common markers and the actual gene loci are then bracketed in a region between the two nearest neighboring markers. The entire process is then repeated by looking at more markers that target that region to map the gene neighborhood to a higher resolution until a specific causative locus can be identified. This process is often referred to as \\"positional cloning\\", and it is used extensively in the study of plant species. One plant species, in particular in which positional cloning is utilized is in maize. The great advantage of genetic mapping is that it can identify the relative position of genes based solely on their phenotypic effect. Genetic mapping is a way to identify exactly which chromosome has which gene and exactly pinpointing where that gene lies on that particular chromosome. Mapping also acts as a method in determining which gene is most likely recombine based on the distance between two genes. The distance between two genes is measured in units known as centimorgan. A centimorgan is a distance between genes for which one product of meiosis in one hundred is recombinant. The further two genes are from each other, the more likely they are going to recombine. If it were closer, the opposite would occur. =Physical mapping= Since actual base-pair distances are generally hard or impossible to directly measure, physical maps are actually constructed by first shattering the genome into hierarchically smaller pieces. By characterizing each single piece and assembling back together, the overlapping path or \\"tiling path\\" of these small fragments would allow researchers to infer physical distances between genomic features. The fragmentation of the genome can be achieved by restriction enzyme cutting or by physically shattering the genome by processes like sonication. Once cut, the DNA fragments are separated by electrophoresis. The resulting pattern of DNA migration (i.e. its genetic fingerprint) is used to identify what stretch of DNA is in the clone. By analyzing the fingerprints, contigs are assembled by automated (FPC) or manual means (pathfinders) into overlapping DNA stretches. Now a good choice of clones can be made to efficiently sequence the clones to determine the DNA sequence of the organism under study. In physical mapping, there are no direct ways of marking up a specific gene since the mapping does not include any information that concerns traits and functions. Genetic markers can be linked to a physical map by processes like in situ hybridization. By this approach, physical map contigs can be \\"anchored\\" onto a genetic map. The clones used in the physical map contigs can then be sequenced on a local scale to help new genetic marker design and identification of the causative loci. Macrorestriction is a type of physical mapping wherein the high molecular weight DNA is digested with a restriction enzyme having a low number of restriction sites. There are alternative ways to determine how DNA in a group of clones overlaps without completely sequencing the clones. Once the map is determined, the clones can be used as a resource to efficiently contain large stretches of the genome. This type of mapping is more accurate than genetic maps. =Mapping of mutational sites within a gene= In the early 1950s the prevailing view was that the genes in a chromosome are discrete entities, indivisible by genetic recombination and arranged like beads on a string. During 1955 to 1959, Benzer performed genetic recombination experiments using rII mutants of bacteriophage T4. He found that, on the basis of recombination tests, the sites of mutation could be mapped in a linear order.Benzer S. Fine structure of a genetic region in bacteriophage. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1955;41(6):344-354. doi:10.1073/pnas.41.6.344Benzer S. On the topology of the genetic fine structure. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1959;45(11):1607-1620. doi:10.1073/pnas.45.11.1607 This result provided evidence for the key idea that the gene has a linear structure equivalent to a length of DNA with many sites that can independently mutate. In 1961, Francis Crick, Leslie Barnett, Sydney Brenner and Richard Watts-Tobin performed genetic experiments that demonstrated the basic nature of the genetic code for proteins.Crick FH, Barnett L, Brenner S, Watts-Tobin RJ. General nature of the genetic code for proteins. Nature. 1961 Dec 30;192:1227-1232. These experiments, involving mapping of mutational sites within the rIIB gene of bacteriophage T4, demonstrated that three sequential nucleobases of the gene's DNA specify each successive amino acid of its encoded protein. Thus the genetic code was shown to be a triplet code, where each triplet (called a codon) specifies a particular amino acid. They also obtained evidence that the codons do not overlap with each other in the DNA sequence encoding a protein, and that such a sequence is read from a fixed starting point. Edgar et al.Edgar RS, Feynman RP, Klein S, Lielausis I, Steinberg CM. Mapping experiments with r mutants of bacteriophage T4D. Genetics. 1962;47:179–186. PMC 1210321. performed mapping experiments with r mutants of bacteriophage T4 showing that recombination frequencies between rII mutants are not strictly additive. The recombination frequency from a cross of two rII mutants (a x d) is usually less than the sum of recombination frequencies for adjacent internal sub-intervals (a x b) + (b x c) + (c x d). Although not strictly additive, a systematic relationship was demonstratedFisher KM, Bernstein H. The additivity of intervals in the RIIA cistron of phage T4D. Genetics. 1965;52 (6):1127–1136. PMC 1210971. that likely reflects the underlying molecular mechanism of genetic recombination. =Genome sequencing= Genome sequencing is sometimes mistakenly referred to as \\"genome mapping\\" by non-biologists. The process of \\"shotgun sequencing\\" resembles the process of physical mapping: it shatters the genome into small fragments, characterizes each fragment, then puts them back together (more recent sequencing technologies are drastically different). While the scope, purpose and process are totally different, a genome assembly can be viewed as the \\"ultimate\\" form of physical map, in that it provides in a much better way all the information that a traditional physical map can offer. Use Identification of genes is usually the first step in understanding a genome of a species; mapping of the gene is usually the first step of identification of the gene. Gene mapping is usually the starting point of many important downstream studies. =Disease association= The process to identify a genetic element that is responsible for a disease is also referred to as \\"mapping\\". If the locus in which the search is performed is already considerably constrained, the search is called the fine mapping of a gene. This information is derived from the investigation of disease manifestations in large families (genetic linkage) or from populations-based genetic association studies.

It was broadcast weekly on Pacifica radio station KPFK in Southern California from 1972 to 2000. In its heyday, Hour 25 featured numerous interviews with famous authors of science fiction and fantasy, in addition to luminaries of the scientific community. On its archival website, there is an extensive archive of older shows featuring interviews with popular authors, including Terry Pratchett, Larry Niven, Laurie R. King, Frank Kelly Freas, and Neil Gaiman. The program was hosted by Mike Hodel (working with a series of co- hosts) from 1972 to 1986; Hodel was succeeded by Harlan Ellison, who was the regular host in 1986-87. Notable science fiction authors Steven Barnes, Arthur Byron Cover, David Gerrold and J. Michael Straczynski also hosted the show at various times in the 1980s and 1990s. The show left radio in 2000, but continued as an increasingly erratically-scheduled internet-only broadcast, hosted by Warren James. Interviews were phased out, the frequency of new shows dropped dramatically, and after about 2006, the show was only heard a few times a year. The final internet broadcast to date occurred in December, 2018. History Hour 25 was one of the longest-running science fiction radio programs, surpassed by only Hour of the Wolf, and surpassing Shockwave Radio Theater's 28 year run. In its first years, Hour 25 functioned almost as a science fiction \\"web page\\" for the Los Angeles area fan base, before computer technology made it much simpler to keep up-to-date on news and events in the relatively small world of science-fiction fandom. It was also one of the earliest programs to be taken seriously by both authors and publishers. Hour 25 was originally hosted by Katherine Calkin and Mitchell Harding, who were quickly joined by Mike Hodel after the first few months. The trio's appreciation for the genre and differing tastes brought a unique quality to the program, which was an eclectic mixture of science fiction news, reviews, readings, filk music, occasional on-air listener phone calls, interviews, and playing of science fiction radio shows such as \\"X Minus One\\" and \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\". The show has gone through a number of hosts, and can be usefully subdivided into different eras by host tenure: =Mike Hodel era (1972-1986)= ;Co-hosts: :Katherine Calkin (1972-1976) :Mitchell Harding (1972-1981) :Mel Gilden (1981-1986) Hour 25 first took to the air in January 1972, and was created by Mitchell Harding, Katherine Calkin, Mike Hodel and Terry Hodel. Though Mike Hodel was involved in the show's creation from the very beginning, he was initially unable to host it due to other commitments, and Hour 25 was originally hosted by Katherine Calkin, with engineer Mitchell Harding serving as de facto co-host, often identifying himself on-air as \\"John Henry Thong\\". (\\"Mitchell Harding\\" was itself also a pseudonym—his real name was Eugene Loring Ware.) Mike Hodel would join the on-air cast within the first few months, and with a now permanent trio of co-hosts in place, Hour 25 began to take on its most well- remembered form. The show took a certain amount of pride in fostering the LA science fiction community. Terry Hodel, Mike Hodel's wife, maintained and read on the air each week a calendar of science fiction related events in the Los Angeles area, which before electronic media and the internet was the only way many science fiction fans learned of conventions and book signings. Hour 25 also adopted a fan-friendly method of operation in Southern California; the outer door of the station was deliberately propped open during the program, allowing fans to come and go as they pleased. Fans would often drop by the station to meet the evening's guests, or to deliver refreshments. Originally, the three-hour show aired Friday nights from 10:00 PM to 1:00 AM, but when the management at KPFK threatened to cancel the show, the producers were able to negotiate a schedule change. The last hour of the program, which was largely devoted to playing old-time radio shows, was eliminated, and beginning in May 1975, Hour 25 aired on Saturday morning from midnight to 2:00 AM. In October, 1976, the show moved back to its original starting time, Fridays at 10:00 PM, and ended at midnight. It would then continue airing in this timeslot for the next two decades. As the show became more of a fixture in the LA science- fiction community, noted authors began to make appearances on the show. Theodore Sturgeon was the first author to be interviewed by the show, in 1973; in the years following, Hour 25 interviewed virtually every major writer in the field. One well-known recorded interview was with author Philip K. Dick in 1976, in which Mike Hodel talked with Dick about his new book, \\"A Scanner Darkly\\", and Dick read some passages which he said were inspired by his own use of drugs. The original recording was over three hours long, but the broadcast version was edited to be much shorter. Some time after being aired, Hodel realized that neither version of the interview could be found in the station archives, but a 75-minute version of the Dick interview is now available and a transcript is held on the Internet Archive. Hour 25 was also one of the first US radio programs to introduce the American audience to \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" before NPR gained rights and aired it. It was broadcast as two series of six shows with a \\"bridge\\" episode, and was replayed until NPR gained the rights. Hour 25 later featured Douglas Adams as an in-studio guest. Calkin, one of the show's original creators and co-hosts, departed in 1976 for a position at KUSC, and was not replaced. After co- host/engineer Mitchell Harding departed from Hour 25 in 1981 to take a position at KCRW-FM, Hodel co-hosted the show with science fiction and television writer Mel Gilden, who was then just beginning his career. At this same time, Harding's engineering duties were taken over by Joe Adams, who would occasionally co-host shows that featured discussions of various comics. Later, Burt Handlesman, who was often affectionately identified on-air as \\"Burt Handlesman, Crack Engineer\\", would become the program's engineer and announcer. As well, for several years in the early 1980s, Bill Warren was a once-a-month \\"media\\" co-host. One frequently discussed concept in the show was the \\"Group Mind\\", which consisted of all the listeners. Hodel often said there was no topic that some \\"cell\\" of the Group Mind wouldn't have information about.Mike Hodel, \\"The Group Mind\\": undated document retrieved from https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q;=cache:FXcHp3LRg90J:207.56.179.67/steve_hodel/The%2520Group%2520Mind%2520by%2520Mike%2520Hodel.pdf+%22The+Hosts+Of+Hour+25%22&hl;=en&pid;=bl&srcid;=ADGEESgtiPFeis1fQQB5VdwmsD7r1y3UYXSojE4esNFhWJPchFYEzsMspyqKV4GonchHXP_H_I_afBjLX7MFyXMPczDrvHmcxtH2G1PVOgtFVjhixKoipdX4Nt53BBi5_tNYOnG8IQV_&sig;=AHIEtbQHk_n- pdHcZQ61TQXH8sA0E-iRGw Many times members of the \\"Group Mind\\" would call in with answers as the show aired, presaging live shows today which have chat rooms for the same function. Harlan Ellison was a frequent and favorite guest on the program. On August 14, 1976, he was the guest and after explaining what would happen that night he started work on a story. He began with the audience suggesting words and phrases he could use. He picked three and began typing, describing what he was doing and occasionally asking the hosts and audience for help. This continued so long that the host of the following show gave him more air time. The show lasted over 3 and 1/2 hours, but he was unable to finish the story that night. Ellison came back on August 28 and continued writing. He returned once more on September 4, 1976 and read the completed story, \\"Hitler Painted Roses.\\" Ellison later \\"immortalized\\" Hour 25 (and some of its staff) in a story, \\"The Hour That Stretches\\", which featured the radio show as a central element. =Harlan Ellison era (1986-1987)= When Mike Hodel became gravely ill in early 1986, Ellison took over co-hosting the show with Mel Gilden. After Mike Hodel died on May 6, 1986, Ellison became the official new co-host on May 9, the memorial program for Mike Hodel. Gilden left the show a month later, leaving Ellison as the sole host. Terry Hodel continued with the show as executive producer, and also continued to maintain and read the calendar listings. Ellison opened each program by reading vignettes of his own composition while music from the opening credits of Dark of the Sun played in the background. Ellison renamed the program \\"Mike Hodel's Hour 25\\", and began closing each show by saying \\"Goodnight, Mike.\\" As the sole host of Hour 25, Ellison began to find it challenging to create two hours of original content every week; the Harlan Ellison FAQ (which is overseen by Ellison) also mentions that Ellison felt that the people at Pacifica Radio/KPFK were being \\"less than civil\\" and \\"abusive\\" to him.http://harlanellison.com/text/newsfaq.txt Ellison left the show after the broadcast of June 19, 1987. =J. Michael Straczynski/Larry DiTillio era (1987-1989)= ;Frequent substitute host: :David Gerrold (1988-1989) When Harlan Ellison decided to leave Hour 25, he contacted writer J. Michael Straczynski and asked him to take over the show as its weekly host. Straczynski brought Larry DiTillio on as co-host; the two hosted Hour 25 for a little over two years, although David Gerrold was a frequent substitute host during this era. The show continued to interview such guests as Ray Bradbury, Norman Corwin, John Carpenter, Dean Koontz, Walter Koenig, Neil Gaiman and scores of other writers, directors and actors. =Rotating hosts era (1989-1992)= Beginning in 1989, the show moved to using a series of rotating hosts. The hosts sometimes worked solo, more often in pairs or even trios with little week-to-week continuity. Amongst the regular pool of hosts and co-hosts during this era were Straczynski, DiTillio, Arthur Byron Cover, Steven Barnes and Warren W. James. Author David Gerrold hosted one show solo and co-hosted at least one show with DiTillio during this era, though he was not a regular host. In 1992, Straczynski, DiTillio and Cover all left Hour 25 due to creative differences with KPFK station management—particularly with regard to language used on the air, and management's request for advance notice of the program's content. This left only James and Barnes as hosts. =Warren James era (1992-2018)= ;Regular substitute host: :Steven Barnes (1992-1995) As of 1992, the show was now hosted primarily by Warren James, with Steven Barnes taking over as host approximately once a month. After a few years, Barnes left the show to move to the Pacific Northwest, leaving James as the show's sole host, although Jeff Laube, Nick Smith and Sandy Rymer occasionally (and individually) co-hosted the show with James on an informal basis. A special 25th anniversary show aired in January, 1997, and featured several co-hosts from years past, including Mitchell Harding, Katherine Calkin, Mel Gilden and J. Michael Straczynski. In 1998, the show was cut from its longstanding two- hour running time to one hour. Terry Hodel continued as the executive producer of the show (and as the presenter of the calendar listings) until her death in March 1999. At this time, Suzanne Gibson became producer, and also took over as the compiler and presenter of the calendar listings. Gibson also frequently functioned as an unofficial co-host, participating in interview segments and story readings. The show left KPFK in the fall of 2000, and became an internet-only radio show at that time. With the time restrictions of fitting into a specific radio station timeslot lifted, Hour 25 episodes now lasted anywhere from 60 to 150 minutes, depending on the subject matter and material available for broadcast. After the first few weeks as an internet-only show, calendar listings were no longer read on the air but were instead posted on the show's website — although even this practice petered out in early 2002. The show kept to a weekly schedule through mid-2002, after which the frequency with which new episodes were produced started to decline. New episodes were generally heard approximately twice a month through 2004, then roughly once a month in 2005. Dedicated author interviews became rare: from 2006-2011, Hour 25 produced between 2 and 6 new episodes each year, usually centred around reports from Loscon, or readings of Christmas and/or Hallowe'en-themed science fiction stories. After 2008, episode lengths were consistently kept to under an hour, and Loscon reports were discontinued after 2010. The show seemed to have wound down with an episode of Hallowe'en readings broadcast in 2011, but after exactly a one-year absence, Hour 25 returned with another episode of Hallowe'en readings on October 31, 2012. In the show's opening segment, show host James explained that Hour 25's dramatically reduced production schedule was due to a number of factors, including medical and financial difficulties. However, he also stated that \\"reports that Hour 25 has ended are most certainly in error.\\" An episode of Christmas readings followed on December 25. A 92-minute interview with author David Brin (following 20 minutes of Hour-25-news) was recorded in February 2013 and posted in March.Hour 25 Homepage, February 22, 2013 This was the first episode of Hour 25 since 2010 not to consist of Hallowe'en or Christmas readings. 2014 also had two episodes with non-holiday content (out of four overall), but after 2015, Hour 25 reverted to two episodes per year, consisting solely of Hallowe'en and Christmas readings. The show once again appears to have wound down, as no new Hour 25 episodes have been posted since December, 2018.

This show and Australian hit Hi-5 used to swap the timeslot in order to film new seasons. The show revolves around a farm in the country owned by Milly and Max and occupied by six farm animals: Henry the Horse, Daisy the cow, Dash the Duck, Percy the Pig, Shirley the Sheep, and Charlotte the Hen. The show is aimed at pre-schoolers, and is of a light- hearted nature. It includes short sequences related to the show's plot, and sequences of singing and dancing with Max, Milly and some other children (who are older than pre-school age). Max is a forgetful, funny and energetic farm worker, who often gets his foot stuck in a bucket. Milly, on the other hand, is an intelligent, helpful and caring farmhand, who often helps Max out of his sticky situations. Each episode is half an hour long. The name of the show suggests that it was inspired by the classic children's song Old McDonald Had a Farm. Which is quite suitable, as it is not exactly what you would call an olden day farm, but the exact opposite, except for the good old windmill. Animatronic designer and puppeteer Ian James Colmer, who also plays the voice of Charlotte the Hen, now runs a film production company Destiny Pictures (www.destinypictures.net). Charlotte the Hen got her name from a competition winner named Charlotte with initial S. All songs for the show are provided by a team of writers from Sony/ ATV Music Publishing. Recording & production of all music is done by Jay Collie, who is also known for his performance, songwriting and production work in the popular country/rock/pop band, Jonah's Road. Format The farm is tying into the title's name \\"New McDonald's Farm\\". The logo (on the entrance to the farm) is a yellow sun with the title name on it (in yellow, blue and orange. A running gag is that whenever the sign falls down, Max is desperate to fix it. The \\"Song of the Day\\" segment is after the intro of the show. Max and Milly are played by 3 Brisbane actors and one actor from Britain, Tim Mager, Nikki Payten, Heidi Luchterhand and John Tobias who wear large foam and fabric costumes with animatronic heads. The controls are very simple and involve servo motors to actuate the eye blink, eye turn and mouth open and close. This is a very basic system, which relies on the character performers off screen to watch and listen to the pre-recorded audio track, and try to sync the mouth movement. The animals are cable controlled and have limited movement, sometimes requiring the performers to pick them up and physically move them around to create the illusion of life. Inside their suits, Tim, Nikki, Heidi and John must wear cold vests, which are made of a gel. These are frozen, and then slowly thaw out as the actors wear them. The suits are extremely hot to wear. After the first season, James Colmer was commissioned to re-design and re-build all the head animatronics, making them lighter, stronger, and easier to maintain. A full kilogram of weight was shaved off, by the use of lightweight aluminium. For the third season they were re-designed and re-built again, this time by Dan Carlisle. These heads proved to be the most reliable and actor friendly. They required next to no maintenance and were much lighter compared to the heads of the first and second series. The new mechanisms also provided a much greater range of movement. One of the makers have worked on dozens of other children's shows including Simon Hopkinson who wrote Petals, the animated feature film The Magic Pudding, Raggs, Chuck Finn, Dive Olly Dive! and Bananas in Pyjamas, Ron Saunders was well known as the creator of Spellbinder and Johnson and Friends and Ian Munro who also directed Hi-5, Bananas in Pyjamas, Johnson and Friends, Magic Mountain, Cushion Kids and Toybox.

Family He was the son of Sir James Butler, Lord Deputy of Ireland, Lord of the Manor of Advowson of Callan (1438–1487) and Sabh Kavanagh, Princess of Leinster, daughter of Donal Reagh Kavanagh, MacMurrough, King of Leinster (1396–1476).Edwards, D.

He married Lady Margaret FitzGerald, daughter of Gerald FitzMaurice FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare and had 9 children by that marriage: 3 sons and 6 daughters. Claims to the title During the prolonged absence from Ireland of the earls, his father Sir James Butler (d. 1487) Royal Descents and Pedigrees of Founders' Kin, Pedigree CXXI, by Sir Bernard Burke (1864) had laid claim to the Ormond land and titles. This had precipitated a crisis in the Ormond succession when the seventh earl later died without a male heir. On 20 March 1489, King Henry VII appointed him High Sheriff of County Kilkenny. He was knighted prior to September 1497. The following year (1498) he seized Kilkenny Castle and with his wife, Margaret FitzGerald (d. 1542), the dynamic daughter of the earl of Kildare, probably improved the living accommodation there.

Aided by the king's Chancellor, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, Butler was granted the earldom of Ossory. =Restoration of title= On 22 February 1538, the earldom of Ormond was restored to him.

He was imprisoned under the Communist regime in 1963 until not too long before his death on the charges of sending religious newsletters to his parishioners. He was beatified under Pope Benedict XVI on 19 June 2005 though the pontiff delegated that Cardinal Józef Glemp preside on his behalf in Warsaw. Life Władysław Findysz was born on 13 December 1907 to Stanisław Findysz and Apollonia Rachwal and he was baptized the day after in the local parish church. His early education was overseen by the Felician Sisters while he later joined the Marian Solidarity movement as a young student. His studies concluded in 1919. Findysz entered the major seminary in Przemyśl in the autumn of 1927 where he was a spiritual student of Jan Wojciech Balicki; he was later ordained to the priesthood on 19 June 1932 before being appointed as the assistant parish priest at Borysław on 1 August 1932 while remaining there until 17 September 1935 when he assumed the duties of an assistant parish priest at Drohobych. Father Findysz was stationed there until 1 August 1937 when he was reassigned to Strzyżów until 10 October 1940 when he was appointed to Jasło. He later was made the parish administrator and parish priest at Nowy Żmigród on 8 July 1941. On 3 October 1944 he and many others were expelled from the town due to the retreating Nazi army and he later returned on 23 January 1945 in order to rebuild his damaged parish while also caring for the refugees and displaced peoples; he also saved several Greek Catholic families that the Communists began to persecute and exile while from 1946 until his death he was observed by the secret police's surveillance officials. He was made an honorary canon in 1946 due to his good works. He was ordered to stop teaching catechism in 1952 and was ordered to live outside of his parish on two occasions in 1952 and 1954 in an attempt by the Communists to hinder his work. He was made vice-dean of the Nowy Żmigród deanery in 1957 and was later appointed as its dean in 1962. In 1963 he established the Conciliar Works of Charity. On 25 November 1963 he was arrested and jailed two months after he had surgery to remove a thyroid gland; his show trial on 16 and 17 December 1963 saw him sentenced for 30 months for the crime of \\"forcing\\" religion on people in the area. Father Findysz was transferred to a prison hospital on 25 January 1964 where he suffered from esophageal cancer though surgery was postponed and he was left to suffer before his release on 29 February. By this stage the tumors were deemed to be inoperable and so he was forced to live in pain until his death a few months later. He was admitted to hospital in April 1964 to see a specialist who advised against surgery. The priest died on 21 August 1964 in the morning due to his cancer and was buried that same day. A total of 130 priests attended his funeral. Beatification The beatification process was authorized to commence on 23 May 2000 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints (C.C.S.) issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" to the cause and titled him as a Servant of God as the first official stage in the process. The diocesan process spanned from 27 June 2000 until its successful closure on 18 October 2002 and received C.C.S. validation in Rome on 13 December 2002 before the C.C.S. received the Positio dossier in 2003. Theologians voiced their approval of the cause on 28 September 2004 while the C.C.S. themselves also approved it on 16 November 2004. Pope John Paul II approved the beatification after he confirmed that the late priest died \\"in odium fidei\\" (in hatred of the faith) and scheduled the beatification for 24 April 2005 in Rome. This was suspended after the pope died in 2005 and so new Pope Benedict XVI delegated Cardinal Józef Glemp to preside in his name on 19 June 2005 in Warsaw. His cause was the first successful cause for one killed - or one who died - under the Communist persecution of Poland. The current postulator for this cause is the Rev. Piotr Tarnawski.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine, a space station located near a stable wormhole between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the Milky Way Galaxy. This episode is part of the Dominion War storyline, in which the United Federation of Planets is at war with the Dominion, an aggressive empire from the Gamma Quadrant, which has already absorbed the nearby planet of Cardassia. In this episode, the genetically engineered Dr. Julian Bashir works with a group of genetically engineered, socially maladjusted savants to try to help them become productive members of society. Meanwhile, Deep Space Nine hosts peace negotiations with the Dominion. This episode guest stars Jeannetta Arnette as Dr. Loews, Tim Ransom as Jack, Hilary Shepard as Lauren, Michael Keenan as Patrick, Faith Salie as Sarina Douglas, with Casey Biggs and Jeffrey Combs reprising their recurring roles as Cardassian leader Damar and Dominion representative Weyoun. Background In the Star Trek science fiction universe, it is illegal for parents to genetically engineer their children, due to laws passed centuries before, when genetically engineered \\"supermen\\" tried to take over Earth. The episode \\"Doctor Bashir, I Presume\\" in Deep Space Nine's third season revealed that the parents of Dr. Bashir, chief medical officer on Deep Space Nine, had him illegally genetically re-engineered as a child to improve his mental and physical abilities. When Bashir's secret was uncovered, his parents cut a deal for him to be allowed to retain his position as a physician and in Starfleet—both career paths from which genetically augmented individuals are normally banned. Plot Dr. Bashir has volunteered to help treat four genetically augmented individuals who, due to unintended neurological side effects of their augmentation, are unable to function in society: hyperactive, paranoid Jack; hypersexual Lauren; childlike Patrick; and silent, catatonic Sarina. Bashir realizes that their primary problem is boredom: as Jack points out, they are forbidden from pursuing any profession where they could put their enhanced brain power to work. Meanwhile, Damar, the new leader of Cardassia, proposes peace talks with the Federation. Watching his speech, the augments make several accurate guesses about Damar and how he came to power. Bashir convinces Captain Sisko to allow the augments to review the peace negotiations to see if they can determine the Dominion's agenda. Based on subtle clues in Damar and Weyoun's speech and behavior, the augments deduce that the Dominion wants to draw the border to secure a planet that has the raw materials needed to make ketracel white, the drug used to control the Dominion's Jem'Hadar soldiers. Knowing this gives the Federation negotiators a huge advantage in the talks. Starfleet provides the augments with further intelligence in order to develop a statistical model to predict the future. The augments soon come to the conclusion that the Federation is doomed to lose the war and suffer casualties in the hundreds of billions. As a result, they recommend surrender, which will save those lives and still leave the Federation in a position to rise up against the Dominion in the future. Bashir is convinced the augments are right and argues the case before Sisko. However, Sisko and Starfleet reject the suggestion out of hand. The augments decide to leak Starfleet's strategic plans to the Dominion, hoping to shorten the war and minimize the casualties. When Bashir objects to this treasonous plan, Jack, Lauren, and Patrick overpower him. Bound hand and foot, and left alone with Sarina, Bashir convinces her that her fellow augments' actions will result in their imprisonment and separation. Sarina frees Bashir in the nick of time, and Bashir intercepts the augments on their way to the meeting with the Dominion negotiators. Bashir realizes that the augments believed they couldn't possibly be wrong because of their superior intellect; but despite the presumed infallibility of their statistical model, the actions of one person (Sarina) completely altered history. The augments return to their institution, promising to continue work on a plan for defeating the Dominion. Reception In 2011, this episode was noted by Forbes as one of the top ten episodes of the franchise that explores the implications of advanced technology, in the case genetic manipulation. They praised the episode for exploring the tragic implications for technological enhancement gone wrong. Forbes also suggested the episode \\"The Masterpiece Society\\" for its exploration of a genetically engineered society encountered by the Enterprise D. Forbes notes that one reason the Federation has banned genetic augmentation, was because of a large war in the 1990s called the Eugenics war, in the Star Trek timeline. They tied the exploration of Bashir's character, the Star Trek story, and the other augmented character's under a concept that despite the promises of a technology's benefit, things can go wrong.

Professor Bolt was known as a pioneer of engineering seismology. He served for 15 years on the California Seismic Safety Commission leading public debate on earthquake safety in that state, and acted as a consultant on major projects throughout the world. As well, Bolt published a number of popular and technical books on seismology. His research led to construction of earthquake resilient bridges and buildings. Bolt was elected to the National Academy of Engineering \\"for application of the principles of seismology and applied mathematics to engineering decisions and public policy”. Since 2006, there is an award with his name, the Bruce A. Bolt Medal, to recognize individuals worldwide whose accomplishments involve the promotion and use of strong-motion earthquake data and whose leadership in the transfer of scientific and engineering knowledge into practice or policy has led to improved seismic safety. Early life and career Bolt was born in Largs, New South Wales just north of Maitland in 1930. He studied at the University of Sydney obtaining his bachelor's degree in 1952, a master's degree in 1955 and a doctorate in applied mathematics in 1959. He also lectured at Sydney University in mathematics but developed an interest in mathematical modelling of the Earth's interior. He obtained a D. Sc from Sydney University in 1972 while working at Berkeley. After visiting the Lamont Geological Observatory in New York, he visited the Department of Geodesy and Geophysics at Cambridge University where he met Professors Perry Byerly and John Verhoogen of UC Berkeley who invited him there. Career at Berkeley and consultant on seismology base-isolated building model (right) at UCSD Bolt started as director of the Berkeley Seismological Stations (now the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory) in 1963 and served in that position until 1991. In that position, he was at the forefront of seismology especially as a pioneer of engineering seismology. He identified the impact of near-fault effects of earthquakes as well as the \\"fling\\" where the fault slips during an earthquake which has a strong impact on structures near the quake. Professor Bolt was elected to the US National Academy of Engineering in 1978 as recognition for his contribution to that profession. As director of the Berkeley Seismology Center, Bolt pioneered the use of digital recordings rather than paper readouts to read data. Bolt identified that the epicenter of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake was near Daly City, California not near Olema, California in Marin County as had been previously thought. He also helped to design a simulation of the 1906 quake at the California Academy of Sciences museum in Golden Gate Park which has been seen by millions of people. He has written a number of works including Earthquakes: a Primer in 1978 and Inside the Earth: Evidence from Earthquakes in 1982. Professor Bolt served on the California Seismic Safety Commission for 15 years including a year as chairman in 1986. In that position, he had a significant impact on California's earthquake safety legislation and helped to create that states mandatory system of earthquake hazard mapping. Bruce retired from teaching in 1993 and became professor emeritus of seismology, thus continuing his academic activities until his death. He was a consultant on seismology for every major earthquake engineering project including on the Diablo Canyon Power Plant as well as international projects including the Aswan Dam, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System and BART tube under the San Francisco Bay. After the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, he started to work on characterizing the seismic sources and assessing tsunami risk. This probably was his last work as consultant on seismology. Bolt died of pancreatic cancer in July 2005 at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Oakland. He was a citizen of the US at the time of his death. Scientific and academic positions and recognitions During his career, professor Bolt served as a member of a number of important scientific and academic organizations, including: * President of the California Academy of Sciences between 1982 and 1985; * Member of the Board of Trustees for the California Academy of Sciences between 1981–92 and again in 1999; * President of the Academic Senate at Berkeley in 1992-93; and * President of the Faculty Club at Berkeley between 1994 and 2004; * President of the Seismological Society of America in 1974; * Bulletin editor of the Seismological Society of America between 1965 and 1972; and * President of the International Association of Seismology and Physics of the Earth's Interior between 1980 and 1983. * Chairman of the California Seismic Safety Commission. Bruce Bolt received many awards for his scientific achievements, among them: * The Berkeley Citation in 1993. * Alfred E. Alquist Special Recognition Medal, in 1994. * Distinguished Lecture Award of the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute, in 1998. * George W. Housner Medal, in 2000. In 1995, Bolt delivered the fifth Mallet-Milne memorial lecture (entitled From Earthquake Acceleration to Seismic Displacement) for the Society for Earthquake and Civil Engineering Dynamics, in London. In 2006, the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute jointly with the Seismological Society of America established an award in his name, The Bruce A.

Chase the Chuck Wagon is a 1983 promotional video game written by Mike Schwartz for the Atari 2600 and distributed by Purina. It was available only via mail order by sending in proofs of purchase to Purina. In the 1970s and 1980s, popular television commercials for Purina dog food included a dog chasing a tiny chuckwagon. The gameplay is loosely based on this premise.  Gameplay  Chase the Chuck Wagon is a maze game. The object of each maze screen is to move Chuckie, the dog, through mazes of four different designs and escape through the opening directly below the chuckwagon. The player has limited time (60 or 30 seconds depending on the difficulty setting) per maze to accomplish this. There are two obstacles in each maze: the dog catcher moves through the maze, and if he touches Chuckie, the player loses one life; the bouncing object (bone, etc.) travels back and forth across the maze unhindered by the maze walls, and if it touches Chuckie, he will be frozen momentarily (signified by the maze changing color), making it more difficult to reach the end of maze within the time limit or avoid the dog catcher. After successfully completing a maze screen, the maze clears and the reward screen appears. A dog dish drops from the chuckwagon, and the player must use the joystick to orient Chuckie left or right to face the dish, and press the fire button at the right moment to stop it horizontal to Chuckie, allowing him to move to the dish and eat. This scores an additional 100 points. If the player misses, no points are awarded and the game advances to the next maze screen. If the player does not press the fire button, the dish falls repeatedly and the game does not advance. The player starts the game with three Chuckies. Chuckies are lost when time runs out on a maze or upon contact with the dog catcher. The game ends when all the Chuckies are exhausted. =Scoring= The amount of time left on the clock at the end of each maze is the player's score for that stage. Each successfully completed reward screen adds 100 points. When the game is over, the total score is displayed. =Controls= The player uses the joystick to move Chuckie through mazes and to change his facing on the reward screen. The fire button is only used to stop the dropping food dish on the rewards screens. The console controls are unusual as the Atari's Reset switch does not start the game (which is the typical behavior). Instead, the Select switch is used to start a game.  History  As part of a promotion involving the Chuck Wagon line of dog food, Purina contracted video game distributor Spectravision to create a game themed around dogs and dog food. Customers could redeem proofs of purchase from bags of dog food in exchange for the game, an example of a new marketing technique that emerged during the popularity of video games in the early 1980s. In practice, the promotion was relatively unsuccessful. The unshipped cartridges were destroyed. Legacy Chase the Chuck Wagon is far from the rarest of games for the Atari 2600, but it is often referred to as the Holy Grail of Atari 2600 video game collecting.

In this episode, several main characters, including Doctor Zoidberg, Amy Wong, and Hermes Conrad are first introduced, and the crew goes on their first mission. After completing their delivery a series of mishaps occurs which puts Fry and Leela's lives in danger and nearly leaves all of them trapped on the Moon. Plot Settling into their new jobs, Fry, Leela, and Bender are introduced to the other Planet Express employees: Doctor John A. Zoidberg, intern Amy Wong, and bureaucrat Hermes Conrad. It becomes apparent that the ship needs a captain, and Leela is chosen. On their first mission, a delivery to the Moon, Fry undergoes severe culture shock. No longer a daring voyage of exploration, lunar travel has become a day trip to an amusement park called Luna Park. By the 31st century, the actual details of Project Apollo are lost and have been replaced by musicals about whalers on the Moon and goofy gophers. This upsets Fry, who wants to see the real Moon. In spite of Leela's orders to the contrary, Fry hijacks a car from the lunar rover ride and forces it off its track, taking Leela with him. They fall into a crater, forcing Leela to use up most of their oxygen to save them. Meanwhile, Amy loses the keys to the ship and has to recover them from a video arcade claw game. Bender attempts to help her, but he is caught reaching through the prize slot and ejected from the park, leaving him stranded on the Moon's surface. Running low on oxygen, Fry and Leela take refuge on a hydroponic farm. Bender arrives and seduces one of the farmer's robot daughters and he, Fry, and Leela end up on the run, trying to out-distance both the farmer's shotgun and the lunar terminator. Leela berates Fry for refusing to accept that, apart from the amusement park, the Moon is nothing but a wasteland. As night falls on the Moon, Fry and Leela find the Apollo 11 lander and take shelter inside it. Fry apologizes to Leela for hijacking the car from the ride and explains his childhood dream of being an astronaut. Leela sympathizes, and they watch an Earthrise together. Eventually, Amy manages to rescue all three with her newly developed crane operation skills, just before the farmer can kill them. Cultural references During the sequence where Amy attempts to retrieve the keys for the Planet Express Ship from the vending machine, an arcade game titled Gender-Neutral Pac-Person can be seen in the background, a reference to the Namco arcade games Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man. Also, The Goophy Gopher Revue is said to have been sponsored by Monsanto, a bioengineering conglomerate from the United States. Crater Face, the Lunar Park mascot, is a reference to the Moon from the 1902 French silent film A Trip to the Moon. Bender impales Crater Face in the eye with his beer bottle after Crater Face attempts to confiscate his alcohol, which is another reference to the film as the astronomers' capsule (which resembles a bottle) hitting the Moon's eye when it crashes. The title of the episode itself is a reference to the quote \\"The Eagle has landed\\" said by astronaut Neil Armstrong when he and Buzz Aldrin touched down on the Moon during the Apollo 11 mission. Fry nearly makes a reference to Neil Armstrong's quote \\"That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind\\". At the \\"Destination Moon\\" lunar rover ride, there is a reference to Ralph and Alice Kramden from the sitcom The Honeymooners. When Fry and Leela are on the surface of the Moon and it starts to get dark, it is possible to hear in the background the first chord of the song \\"Breathe\\" from Pink Floyd's album The Dark Side of the Moon. Broadcast and reception Ken Keeler was nominated for an Annie Award for \\"Outstanding Individual Achievement for Writing in an Animated Television Production\\" in 1999 for this episode. For its original run, the episode had Nielsen ratings of 8.1/14 in homes and 6.8/19 in adults aged 18–49. While this was a decrease from the pilot episode it did still build 5% from its lead in, The Simpsons. This was the second episode to air following The Simpsons and the final scheduled to air on Sunday evenings before the show moved to the Tuesday night lineup, where it was expected to suffer in the ratings. In 2006 IGN ranked the episode as number 19 in their list of the top 25 episodes of Futurama due to its humor and the effective way in which it portrayed Fry's discovery of the changes in the future.

Melton, an African American, defeated the city's first black mayor Harvey Johnson, Jr. Melton won 63 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary against Johnson, who had served two terms. Melton quickly swept into action to rid Jackson of drug-related crime, improve economic development, and improve city infrastructure. Since Melton became mayor, he touted economic-development projects totaling over $1.6 billion, creating at least 4,500 jobs in the city. Others pointed out that many of those projects were in the works when he started in office. However he was embroiled in several controversies while being mayor, including questionable power breaches and criminal misdemeanor activity.  Early life  Melton was born in Houston, Texas on March 19, 1949, to his parents Herbert Melton and Marguerite Haynes-Melton, both of whom were active members of the University Presbyterian Church in Houston. Prior to graduation from high school and following in the grid-iron footsteps of one of his earlier Booker T. Washington Eagles quarterback idols, Eldridge Dickey (Tennessee State Univ., Oakland Raiders), Frank was a popular, studious, and disciplined Quarterback for the Eagles. Melton graduated from Booker T. Washington High School. He moved to Nacogdoches, Texas to earn a BA at Stephen F. Austin State University. In college, he took a position with the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, serving as Director of Recreation at its Lufkin State School.\\"Frank Melton obituary\\", The Clarion- Ledger  Early career  He entered broadcasting after graduation, first as a Sports Anchor for KTRE TV in Lufkin, Texas and then, in 1977, as general manager of KLTV TV. He climbed the ranks at KLTV TV before becoming president of Buford Television, Inc. In 1984, he became Chairman and CEO of WLBT TV Inc, in Jackson, Mississippi, in which position he remained until 2002. Melton served as the head of the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics for 14 months, appointed by former Mississippi Governor Ronnie Musgrove in December 2002. Governor Haley Barbour, who defeated Musgrove in the 2003 gubernatorial election, dismissed Melton and other holdover political appointees when he took office. Melton also served in numerous other fields, including serving as the director of the Governor's Criminal Justice Task Force, after being appointed by former Governor Kirk Fordice. Melton served on the national board of directors for the Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI), the Liberty Broadcasting Board of Directors, and the NBC Affiliates Board of Directors. He served on the Liberty Broadcasting board of directors; the Wave board of directors, the Community Broadcast Group, and the NBC Affiliates board of directors.  Community work  Melton also worked as a member of the board of directors for United Way and the Jackson Chamber of Commerce. He was an instructor at Jackson State University. He gave numerous speeches in the inner-city high schools and city universities.  As mayor  Melton led drug sweeps and drug raids. The city's narcotics unit was reduced and few drug arrests were made. Many citizens were pleased to see him take this hands-on and vocal approach to addressing the city's problems. Yet many city residents, including the NAACP and the ACLU, have disagreed with the mayor's crime- fighting tactics and what they call illegal and unconstitutional actions. He wore a Jackson Police Department badge and carried a gun. In April 2006, Melton lambasted Hinds County District Attorney Faye Peterson because she would not put his star witness, Christopher Walker, on the stand to testify against Albert \\"Batman\\" Donelson, the alleged leader of the Wood Street Players. The district attorney had to drop Walker from the witness list because the defense provided affidavits showing that Walker had long lived with mayor. Melton had given Walker a copy of his credit card, a car, cash and other assistance. The mayor responded that he was offering Walker \\"witness protection.\\" Soon after Donelson was acquitted, Melton held a press conference with Walker, during which he accused the county's first black female district attorney of having an affair with a murdered bail bondsman, an allegation that was not substantiated. Within days of that press conference, federal investigators revoked Walker's probation because he had failed nearly a dozen drug tests during the period leading up to the Donelson trial.Jackson Free Press: The Mayor and His Star Witness After a series of articles and photographs appeared in spring 2006 showing that Melton was carrying concealed firearms without a permit, and amid increasing editorials calling for authorities to curtail Melton's actions, Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood investigated Melton's actions. On June 1 Hood sent Melton a letter warning of prosecution if he continued to carry weapons into places where they were prohibited, further warning him he was not a police officer. Melton told the Jackson Free Press that he did not have to heed Hood's warning, and continued to carry weapons wherever he wanted. \\"Melton: Hood Is Wrong\\" , Jackson Free Press In late July 2006, the head of the ACLU racial profiling division arrived in Jackson to address reports of racial profiling related to Melton's raids and techniques. In September 2006, Mayor Melton, with his detective bodyguards and a group of youths, called the \\"lawn crew\\" because they traveled with Melton, ostensibly to help with neighborhood clean-up, raided half a duplex on Ridgeway Street without a warrant. Witnesses say that Melton attacked much of the rental duplex with a large stick. He cut his hand during the incident and had to go to the hospital for stitches. He reportedly returned with the young men, with sledgehammers to finish destroying that side of the duplex.Jackson Free Press: \\"Ridgeway duplex damage image gallery\\" Police arrested the tenant, Evans Welch, on drug possession, but he was discharged within days for lack of evidence. No warrant was issued for the raid, nor was the owner of the duplex—Jennifer Sutton—notified of any intention to conduct the raid or damage her property. After news of the demolition broke on Sept. 1, both the attorney general and the district attorney investigated the incident.Jackson Free Press: \\"BREAKING: Melton, Kids Accused of Destroying Private Home\\" Melton and bodyguards Michael Recio and Marcus Wright were indicted on September 15, 2006, on multiple felony charges in the Ridgeway Street demolition, including burglary, conspiracy and the inducement of a minor to commit a felony. Melton was also indicted on three gun charges—a felony for carrying his weapon onto a college campus, two misdemeanors for the church and public park—the same day. Later in the year, Melton took a guilty plea on the gun misdemeanors and plead no-contest on the felony. The terms of both his bond and his probation for the gun charges did not allow him to be around firearms, supervise children under 17, leave his home past midnight without 48 hours' prior permission from his probation officer, consume drugs or alcohol, or use police equipment in any way. Melton, Michael Recio and Marcus Wright were acquitted on all counts filed in the Ridgeway Street incident on April 26, 2007. The prosecution dropped the inducement of a minor charge during the trial. Some civil-rights leaders defended Melton, including Charles Evers, older brother of slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers, and Stephanie Parker-Weaver, daughter of the first openly known interracial couple in Jackson. Parker-Weaver helped lead a campaign to convince Jacksonians of Melton's innocence, including a rally at City Hall with signs stating \\"Vote Melton Not Guilty.\\" He also drew support from many white conservatives in Jackson who appreciated his crime-fighting methods. Prominent businessman Leland Speed, and families of similar conservatives, provided much of Melton's financial support. Melton told some conservatives that he would take the city past race politics, and explained why he ran as a Democrat. \\"Most of you are Republican,\\" he said. \\"The reality is, if you're an African American in Jackson, you have to run as a Democrat to win.\\" He added: \\"I don't like either party.\\"Jackson Free Press:Frank Melton to North Jackson: \\"It's Over!\\" He later on stated he viewed Joseph Stalin, John F. Kennedy, and Mao Zedong as his political influences, which caused him more controversy and cost him support from conservatives. Other African American leaders, including the president of the state NAACP, Derrick Johnson, and the director of the ACLU of Mississippi, Nsombi Lambright, called for justice for the victims of Melton's unorthodox and illegal crime-fighting strategies. They said he was profiling poor blacks in the city. Those groups are leading an effort to start a civilian review board, in part in response to Melton's methods. Melton was a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, an organization formed in 2006 and co-chaired by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston mayor Thomas Menino.Mayors Against Illegal Guns Membership List On November 16, 2007, Mayor Melton appointed Hinds County Sheriff Malcolm McMillin as Jackson's new police chief, after reassigning the police chief Shirlene Anderson to a new post within his administration.The ClarionLedger: McMillin to remain sheriff while serving as JPD chief Sheriff McMillin decided to keep his post as Hinds County Sheriff in addition to acting as the chief of the Jackson Police Department, becoming the first person in Mississippi's history to serve as both County Sheriff and City Police Chief. After reviewing the applicable state laws and ethics rules, counsel determined the Sheriff could head both agencies legally and be compensated from both. He was confirmed by the Jackson City Council on a 4-2 vote. In securing McMillin as Police Chief, Mayor Melton promised not to interfere in the operations of the police department and to remain focused on other mayoral duties.The ClarionLedger: New vision for JPD  Controversies and criminal proceedings  July 19, 2006 - Jackson Mayor Frank Melton received criticism from advocates for the homeless when he used the city's emergency order to enforce a 10 p.m. curfew for the city's homeless population. According to Michael Stoops, executive director of the National Coalition for the Homeless in Washington, the curfew is the first of its kind in the nation. He also said that it effectively amounts to a modern Jim Crow law.Jackson Free Press: Melton Targets Homeless People July 26, 2006 - Frank Melton raises security concerns with US House of Representative, and senior Homeland Security Committee Democrat, Bennie Thompson (MS) when Melton applied for, and was issued, a United States Capitol Police badge and identification card. The card allowed Melton, armed, to bypass security in Federal Buildings, congressional offices and Congress. Wilson Livingood, sergeant-at-arms for the U. S. House, stated in the report to Thompson dated Aug. 17 that Melton showed a Jackson Police Department credential to Capitol police. August 26, 2006 - See above for Ridgeway incident. Nov. 15, 2006 - Melton pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors for carrying a weapon into a church and a park, and no contest to a reduced charge on what had been a felony count involving a gun onto the grounds of the Mississippi College School of Law. March 1, 2007 - Judge Tomie Green issued a warrant for the arrest of Frank Melton. The warrant was issued on the basis of probation violation because Melton resumed going on midnight club raids, while wearing an unofficial badge, among other possible violations. March 7, 2007 - Frank Melton left the hospital in the early morning and returned home without alerting the Sheriff's Department. After his ankle bracelet alerted his probation officer that he was back at home, the sheriff called and told Melton to turn himself in to Hinds County authorities, where he was put into the medical ward of the jail. March 8, 2007 - The Mississippi Supreme Court vacated the arrest warrant for Frank Melton, and asked that Hinds County Circuit Judge Tomie Green be recused without explaining the reasons for either decision. April 24, 2007 - Frank Melton goes on trial for felony charges stemming September 15, 2006 demolition of a house on Ridgeway Street. April 26, 2007 - Frank Melton is found not guilty on all counts. February 2, 2009 - Melton's federal civil rights trial for demolishing the Ridgeway house began. February 24, 2009 - Melton's federal civil rights trial ended in a mistrial when jurors notified the judge that they could not arrive at a verdict. The case was scheduled to be retried on May 11. Mayoral re-election bid Melton filed to run for re-election for the 2009 election. However, on March 17, 2009, the Jackson Democratic Municipal Executive Committee disqualified Melton in a unanimous vote because Melton did not meet the city's residency requirements. He did not file homestead exemption on his home in Jackson but on his home in Tyler, Texas, where his wife Ellen lives. The unanimous vote took Melton's name off the ballot for the May 5, 2009 primary. Melton filed a lawsuit against the Jackson Democratic Municipal Executive Committee to have his name returned to the ballot. On March 26, 2009, Jones County Circuit Court Judge Billy Joe Landrum ordered Melton restored as a Democratic mayoral candidate. Landrum said Melton \\"overwhelmingly rebutted\\" the charge by showing documents with his Jackson home address, including his Mississippi driver's license, utility bills and voting records. On May 5, 2009, Melton lost his bid for re-election, coming in third in the vote totals.  Death  On election night, Melton was rushed to the hospital. He had suffered a cardiac arrest at his Jackson home. He died shortly after midnight on Thursday, May 7, 2009, less than two days after losing the election. His wife, Dr. Ellen Melton, was at his side. He died at St. Dominic Jackson Memorial Hospital in Jackson, MS.

European military texts rate the rank equivalent to a generalissimo. The South Korean armed forces have never made an attempt to declare an equivalent to the wonsu ranks of North Korea, and indeed often deride these ranks as having been created so as to \\"outrank\\" the military leaders of other nations, rather than for any necessary purpose of military administration. Even so, the holders of these ranks have commanded one of the largest military forces in the Pan-Asian theater therefore giving some credence to their existence.U.S. 7th Fleet Sharem Intelligence Brief, published 13 Dec 2007 See also Other pronunciations of the characters 大元帥 *Da Yuan Shuai in Chinese *Dai-Gensui, the Japanese equivalent 元帥, a rank lower than Taewonsu *Wonsu in Korean *Yuan Shuai, the original Chinese title *Gensui, the Japanese equivalent References External links * Image of Kim Il Sung in uniform of Dae Wonsu * Image of Kim Jong Il wonsu and Kim Il Sung taewŏnsu shoulder/collar insignia and crests Category:Military ranks of North Korea Category:1992 establishments in North Korea ","title":"Taewonsu"},{"id":"2345539","text":"Katawar or Katir is the name for the northern mountainous regions of Kafirstan in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Xonox published ports for the Atari 2600, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, and VIC-20. Artillery Duel was featured in several double-ended cartridges--with one game on each end--as well as in a single cartridge. Gameplay The game consists of dueling cannons on either side of a hill or mountain of varying height and shape. Each player has control of the incline and force behind the shell launched, the objective being to score a direct hit on the opposing target. Where many versions gave the player a few tries on the same course, Artillery Duel switches to a new mountain after each turn. When the player does manage to hit the opposing cannon, the reward is a brief animation of comically marching soldiers at the bottom of the screen.

Kaplan, which was first published in the February 1994 edition of The Atlantic Monthly. It is considered to be one of the fundamental theses on the state of current world affairs in the post Cold War era, and is ranked on the same level of doctrinal importance as Samuel Huntington's Clash of Civilizations and Francis Fukuyama's The End of History and the Last Man theses. U.S. President Bill Clinton reportedly recommended the article to White House staff. It has also been criticized as a Malthusian reading of the world, for blaming the situation on its victims and for overlooking alleged political and economical causes such as neoliberal policy.  The article  Whilst Fukuyama believed that the end of the Cold War would bring about a new era of peace in world affairs, Kaplan argued that the Cold War was the closest the world would ever get to Utopia. The new struggles were no longer neatly ideological, but cultural and historical. Kaplan saw the disorder and civil strife he observed in West Africa as representative of broader global trends. As environmental stress worsened, bringing with it widespread disease and resource conflict, rural population groups will migrate more to urban areas causing an increase of social disharmony. A shift in artificial political borders, from states to cities, will redefine identities along cultural or tribal lines. Politics would become localized as states’ powers fade, with sub-national conflicts about self-defense, not ideology, becoming commonplace. The post-modern world would be, for Kaplan, one of numerous cross-cutting identities, systems and allegiances, far from the ordered state-based system that Kaplan saw in the West at the time. He follows the argument of Thomas Homer-Dixon{{Cite webtitle = Thomas Homer-Dixonurl = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Homer-Dixon in which he suggests that politics should be more linked to the physical world again and should focus on combatting the causes of problems rather than combatting the consequences. To do so we should start with redefining the worldmap and give more agency to existing borderlines rather than drawing them ourselves. Cartogrophy should be made in three dimensions in which group and other identities are atop the merely two-dimension color markings of city-states and the remaining nations. Agency of many smaller groups should be included and instead of using borders, maps should be constantly evolving in moving 'centers' of power. The last map, as he calls it, should be an ever-mutating representation of chaos. = 20 Years Later = 20 years after the original publication of the original article, Robert D. Kaplan published a follow up article, entitled Why So Much Anarchy? , reflecting on the original's article relevance on current events, especially in Arab countries. In this new article, Kaplan recognizes that some of his prophecies, such as a revival of racial violence in America, did not come to be. However, he also stands by some of his more provocative arguments, such as the belief that \\"Islam is a religion ideally suited for the urbanizing poor who were willing to fight [emphasis added]\\". He thus mentions the growing popularity of Turkish President Erdogan's conservative Justice and Development Party, largely seen as aligning itself with islamic tendencies, as fulfilling his prediction of the rise of political Islam in Turkey. He also advances further arguments to determine which regimes are bound to fail, notably the presence of a strong, robust bureaucracy, which in turn necessitates a well entrenched middle class. Thus, the arguably successful democratic transition of most former Soviet republics into stable democracies can be explained by a strong bureaucratic apparatus backed by an important middle class. The lack of \\"bourgeoise traditions\\", on the other hand, can be interpreted as one of the main reasons of the failure of states such as Sierra Leone.

The series was created by Tom Fontana and Julie Martin. This series was canceled on May 18, 2006 after one season. A week prior to its premiere, The WB attempted to build buzz with scenes from the series' pilot posted on their website with more adult material not meant for broadcast, with those scenes edited out for the actual broadcast episode. Plot The Bedford Diaries explores the excitement and intensity of New York City college life through the eyes of six students with different backgrounds, experiences and ages, who are brought together in a provocative sexuality seminar. The seminar, which examines the human condition through sexuality, is taught by maverick Professor Jake Macklin, who will challenge and inspire his students as they question their assumptions about their own sexuality, life and identity. The themes include sexual responsibility, manipulation, and the differences between love and sex, passion and abstinence. The students’ innermost thoughts and desires are told through video diaries they make to fulfill their weekly class assignments. Among the students are Sarah Gregory, the Student Government President, poised and assured but vulnerable in love, and her younger brother, Owen Gregory, a freshman pre-med major, who plans to take advantage of all the fun college life has to offer. Natalie Dykstra, a lovely, outgoing and emotional woman, has returned to campus after a suicide attempt. She now struggles with being stereotyped as “the jumper.” Natalie’s ex- boyfriend, Richard Thorne, a former Park Avenue bad boy who turned his life around after Natalie’s jump, is also a member of the class. He’s now clean, sober and works as the college newspaper’s editor, but he’s still tormented by old demons. Lee Hemingway is a scholarship student from Queens with ambitions to become an art historian. Lee has a serious girlfriend, Rachel, but he’s attracted to another scholarship student, Zoe Lopez. Zoe talks a fast and flirty game, but despite her brash veneer, she is still a virgin and struggles with her growing feelings for Lee. The series also stars Tony Award-winner Audra McDonald as Professor Carla Bonatelle, a Political Science professor and head of the Ethics Committee, who regularly clashes with Professor Macklin, as well as with Harold Harper (Peter Gerety), the fatherly, compassionate and often beleaguered Dean of Students.  Production  The series was produced by HBO Independent Productions, Warner Bros. Television Production Inc. and The Levinson/Fontana Co., with executive producers Tom Fontana, Julie Martin, and Barry Levinson. Outdoor scenes were filmed at Barnard College in New York City.

The film won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 72nd Academy Awards, on 26 March 2000, for films made in 1999.Documentary Winners: 2000 Oscars Summary The documentary begins with an advertisement by the Munich Tourism Bureau with a beautiful young girl inviting the world to visit the city for the Olympics, then shows interviews with the wives of some of the murdered athletes, including Ankie Spitzer, widow of fencing coach Andre Spitzer. The film also features the first known filmed interview with Jamal Al-Gashey, a surviving terrorist. Al- Gashey, who is in hiding in Africa, wears a cap and sunglasses and his face is slightly blurred. There are various shots of the Games getting under way, and attention is given to the lax security the Germans had at the Games. The terrorists are seen preparing for the assault; Al-Gashey claims that he and the other members were trained in Libya before going to West Germany to begin the assault. The assault is described by Al-Gashey as well as by some of the German security staff present. Footage of ABC anchor Jim McKay is interspersed, along with sound clips of Peter Jennings, to give an impression of events unfolding as they happened. General Ulrich Wegener, founder of the German counter-terrorist unit GSG 9, was also interviewed during the film, and was roundly criticized for his seemingly flippant attitude about the subject matter. The film offers evidence supporting the allegation that the rescue operation was poorly planned and executed; for instance, the German police aboard the getaway aeroplane voted to abandon their mission without consulting the central command, while the snipers were not prepared and were poorly positioned. The film implies that had the German government prepared better, the athletes might have been saved. Former Mossad Director Zvi Zamir, who was present at the airport during the final gunfight, is interviewed about his views on the failed rescue (he had previously been interviewed on this subject in an NBC profile of the Munich massacre broadcast during the Barcelona Olympics). At the end of the section, graphic photographs of the dead Israelis and Palestinians are shown in a photo-montage set to the Deep Purple song \\"Child in Time\\". The film also alleges that the 29 October hijacking of a Lufthansa jet and the subsequent release of the three surviving Black September members in exchange for the hostages was a set-up by the German government, who did not want their failings to be made obvious in the trial. Reception After the film’s release, film critic Roger Ebert penned a review recommending the film, stating that it \\"grips the attention and is exciting and involving. I recommend it on that basis--and also because of the new information it contains\\". He also stated that \\"Macdonald brings remarkable research to the film\\" and \\"he relentlessly builds up a case against the way the Germans and the International Olympic Committee handled the crisis.\\" However, Ebert criticized the style of the film, and the film's \\"tasteless conclusion\\", which included a montage of action shots and photos of victims' corpses with a rock music score. Controversy and criticism Roger Ebert continued his criticisms after the film received an Academy Award,2000Oscars.org claiming that the producer, Arthur Cohn, intentionally subverts the Academy's documentary and foreign film by-laws – which dictate that only members who have seen all nominated films may vote – by limiting screenings of his films to a small group of invited people. \\"By limiting those who have seen his, Cohn shrinks the voting pool and improves his odds.\\" Joe Berlinger, director of the documentaries Brother's Keeper and Paradise Lost, joined Ebert in criticizing Arthur Cohn's method of screening his films, but stressed that the problem is the Academy by-laws: \\"Until there is a documentary branch of the Academy that treats docs like any other film in any other category, nothing will change, despite the recent band-aid attempt to improve the situation.\\"  See also  * Munich '72 and Beyond * Munich (2005)  Notes  Companion book * Reeve, Simon (New York, 2001), One Day in September: the full story of the 1972 Munich Olympic massacre and the Israeli operation 'Wrath of God' External links * One Day in September at Passion Pictures  * Category:1999 films Category:British films Category:English-language films Category:British documentary films Category:Best Documentary Feature Academy Award winners Category:Documentary films about terrorism Category:Documentary films about the Israeli–Palestinian conflict Category:Munich massacre Category:Films set in Munich Category:Films directed by Kevin Macdonald (director) Category:Films scored by Alex Heffes Category:Documentary films about the Olympics Category:Films about the 1972 Summer Olympics Category:1999 documentary films Category:Films produced by John Battsek ","title":"One Day in September"},{"id":"2345563","text":"The Renault R35, an abbreviation of Char léger Modèle 1935 R or R 35, was a French light infantry tank of the Second World War. Designed from 1933 onwards and produced from 1936, the type was intended as an infantry support light tank, equipping autonomous tank battalions, that would be allocated to individual infantry divisions to assist them in executing offensive operations. To this end it was relatively well-armoured but slow and lacking a good antitank-capacity, fitted with a short 37 mm gun. At the outbreak of the war, the antitank-role was more emphasized leading to the development and eventual production from April 1940 of a subtype with a more powerful longer gun, the Renault R40. It was planned to shift new production capacity to the manufacture of other, faster, types, but due to the defeat of France the R35/40 remained the most numerous French tank of the war, about 1685 vehicles having been produced by June 1940. At that moment it had also been exported to Poland, Romania, Turkey and Yugoslavia. For the remainder of the war Germany and its allies would use captured vehicles, some of them rebuilt into tank destroyers. Development The development plan of 1926 foresaw the introduction of a char d'accompagnement, a cheap mass-produced light tank to replace the Renault FT of World War I vintage, to make it possible for the standard infantry divisions to execute combined arms infiltration tactics, seen as the only viable method of modern offensive warfare left for non- motorised units. The French army did not have the means to motorise more than a few select divisions. In 1930 this plan was replaced by a new one, giving more precise specifications. The first tank to be developed to fulfil its requirements, the Char D1, proved to be neither cheap nor particularly light. In 1933, Hotchkiss offered an alternative solution, the later Hotchkiss H35. For political reasons this proposal was turned into the Plan 1933 and the whole of French industry was in August 1933 invited to propose possible designs. Fourteen companies responded (among which Delaunay-Belleville) and five submitted a prototype: Hotchkiss itself, the Compagnie Général de Construction des Locomotives, APX, FCM and of course France's prime tank producer: Renault. Fearing that his rival Hotchkiss might well replace him as such, Louis Renault hurried to finish a vehicle; construction was soon in such an advanced stage that the changes in specification issued on 21 June 1934, to increase armour thickness from 30 to 40 mm, could not be implemented. On 20 December 1934 Renault was the first to deliver a prototype, with the project name of Renault ZM, to the Commission de Vincennes. In the spring of 1935 this vehicle was refitted with heavier armour and a standard APX turret, attached by the Atelier de Rueil between 18 and 25 April. The prototype was still being tested when international tensions increased due to German re-armament. This prompted an urgent demand for swifter modernisation of the French tank fleet. The ZM was to be put into production immediately. On 29 April 1935 an order of 300 was made, even before the final model could be finished, at a price of 190,000 French franc per hull (unarmed, without the engine and turret, the overall export price was ca. 1,400,000 francs in 1939, that is ca. 32,000 dollars by 1939 standards).The 190,000 FF price (for the complete hull only: the turret added another 100,000), despite being very low when compared in dollars to other tanks of the epoch, is comparable to many similar prices in other French tank contracts. In 1935 there had been for many years a strong deflation of the dollar, making it very strong against the franc. In addition, this was from 1936 worsened by a deliberate French policy of devaluation until the FF was fixed against the dollar on 9 September 1939 at a 43.8 to 1 rate. These exchange rates did not reflect internal value though: they were an artificial instrument to stimulate French exports. This explains how the French were able to produce the entire R 35 at about 500,000 FF in 1939: the real value of the materials and labour used, was about $30,000, not $12,000, as the franc was undervalued about 2.5 times. The export price was realistic though and did not reflect the lower prices for raw materials France was able to obtain from its colonies. The first series production vehicle was delivered on 4 June 1936 and had to be extensively tested again as it was different from the prototype. Description Renault R35: the hatch at the back of the turret is clearly visible To save time, Renault based the suspension and running gear on that of the AMR 35 that was designed for the cavalry. It had five wheels at each side, fitted with horizontal leaf springs, like the AMC 35. The hull, with a length of 4.02 m, consisted of three cast modules, with a maximum armour thickness of 43 millimetres, that were bolted together. Total weight was 10.6 metric tonnes (9.8 tonnes without fuel and ammunition). The bottom module carried on each side an independently sprung front wheel, two bogies and the driving sprocket at the extreme front. The final drive and differentials were housed at the right in the nose module. It was steered through a Cletrac differential with five gears and by engaging the brakes. The driver was seated somewhat to the left and had two hatches. The Renault V-4 85 hp engine was to the right in the short rear with the self sealing 166 litre fuel tank at its left. It rendered a road speed of 20 km/h and a range of 130 km. Cross-country speed did not exceed 14 km/h and the fuel consumption totaled 212 litre/100 km. From 1940 onward they were fitted with AMX tails to help in trench crossing. The cast APX hexagonal turret had a 30 mm thick domed rotatable cupola with vertical vision slits (the highest point of 2.13 m) and had to be either hand cranked or moved about by the weight of the commander, the only other crew member. There was sometimes unofficially a seat installed for him but he most often stood. The rear of the turret had a hatch that hinged down that could be used as a seat to improve observation. The earliest vehicles were fitted with the APX-R turret (with the L713 sight) mounting the short Puteaux 37 mm L/21 SA18 gun (the first batches were removed from FT 17 guntanks which were then rebuilt as utility vehicles) and the 7.5 mm Châtellerault fortress machine gun. The cannon had a very poor armour penetration: only 12 mm at 500 metres. Afterwards the APX turret with the same cannon but the improved L739 sight and the standard Châtellerault 7.5 mm MAC31 Reibel machine gun was used because of delivery delays of the original weapon. There were also so many delays in the production of the turrets that after the first 380 hulls had been produced in 1936 and only 37 could be fitted with a turret, production was slowed down to 200 annually. The 7.5 mm machine gun's spent cartridges (from a total of 2,400) went down a chute through a hole in the floor. The tank carried 42 armour piercing and 58 high explosive rounds. The R 35 at first had no radio, except for the second battalion of the 507e Régiment de Chars de Combat (of Charles de Gaulle), but the R 40 had the ER 54 installed. However, this added to the already heavy task load of the commander, who also acted as gunner and loader. Renault R40 and projects In 1937 it had become obvious the original suspension system was unreliable and ineffective. After many trials it was replaced in the 1940 production run, after the 1540 vehicles had been built with the original design, by an AMX system using twelve wheels fitted with six vertical springs (AMX was the new name of the military division of Renault nationalised on 2 December 1936). About the same time the radio and a much more powerful gun were introduced. The long-barrelled L/35 37 mm SA38 in the adapted cast APX-R1 turret (with L767 sight) gave it an effective anti-tank capacity: 40 mm at 500 metres. The new combination was named the Char léger modèle 1935 R modifié 1939 but is more commonly known as the Renault R40. It was delivered in time to equip one battalion of the Polish 10th Armoured Cavalry Brigade of the Polish Army in France and the last two French tank battalions to be formed. It was intended to fit the R 40 with the welded FCM turret in the second half of 1940, while refitting all existing R 35s with the longer SA 38 gun and bringing R 40 production levels up to 120 per month for the duration of the war. From January 1940, the vehicles of light tank unit commanders were gradually uparmed with the longer gun; but as absolute priority was given to tanks serving in armoured divisions, which were of the Hotchkiss type, of the 273 platoon, company and battalion commanders eligible in Renault units, only a few if any received this \\"R 39\\". The only official possible exception to the rule that Hotchkiss tanks had to be modified first was made on 12 February 1940 when it was ordered to replace the turrets of 24 Infantry tanks, without specifying the type, present in depot or driver schools in order to obtain older turrets to be fitted on R 35 export vehicles.François Vauvillier, 2006, \\"Toute la Lumière sur le Canon de 37 SA 38\\", Histoire de Guerre, Blindés et Matériel, N°74, p. 79 In the same period a crash programme was executed to produce 200,000 armour piercing rounds per month for the shorter gun, as there had been only minimal stocks of this ammunition type.François Vauvillier, 2006, \\"Toute la Lumière sur le Canon de 37 SA 38\\", Histoire de Guerre, Blindés et Matériel, N°74, p. 78 Several projects were based on the R 35 such as a number of fascine carriers: these had frames or other contraptions mounted over the hull or turret with a fascine in them that could be dropped to fill trenches. Operational history Yugoslav Army at Torlak, 1940 The R35 was intended to replace the Renault FT as standard light infantry tank from the summer of 1936, but even by May 1940 not enough conscripts had been retrained and therefore eight battalions of the older tank had to be kept operational. On 1 September 1939, at the outbreak of war, 975 vehicles had been delivered out of 1070 produced; 765 were fielded by tank battalions in France, 49 used for drive training, 33 were in depot and 45 present in the colonies. Of a total order for 2,300 at least 1,601 had been produced until 1 June 1940 — the numbers for that month are lacking — of which 245 had been exported: to Poland (50), Turkey (100; two batches of fifty each in February and March 1940), Romania (41 from an order for 200), and Yugoslavia (54). It is likely that the tanks exported to Yugoslavia (in April 1940) are not included under the 1,601 total and that overall production was 1,685; serial numbers known to be actually used indicate a production of at least 1670 vehicles. =Poland= As the threat of war became apparent and the production rate of Polish 7TP tank was insufficient, it was decided to buy vehicles abroad. Poles were most interested in French SOMUA S35 tanks, but the proposal was refused by the French government. In 1938 the Polish Army bought one (according to other sources, two or three) R35 tank for testing. After a series of tests it was found that the design was disappointing: the engine was overheating, the suspension was tough, and armament insufficient. In April 1939 it was finally decided to buy a hundred R35 tanks as an emergency measure. The first shipment of fifty (other sources lower the number to 49) arrived in Poland in July 1939, along with three Hotchkiss H35 tanks bought for testing. In August they were mostly put into service with the Łuck-based 12th Armoured Battalion. At the beginning of the Invasion of Poland 45 (or 46) tanks formed the core of the newly created 21st Light Tank Battalion that was part of the general reserve of the Commander in Chief. The unit was to defend the Romanian Bridgehead, but was divided after the Soviet invasion of Poland of 17 September. Late September the unit was withdrawn to defend the Romanian Bridgehead. Subsequently, 34 tanks were withdrawn to Romania. Six tanks were attached to the 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade in Stanisławów (today Ivano- Frankivsk); they forced their way through Kolomyia and three vehicles crossed the Hungarian border. The remaining tanks - four R35s and three H35s - were put into service with the improvised Dubno Operational Group and took part in the battles of Krasne on 19 September (with the Soviets) and Kamionka Strumiłowa (with the Germans), during which all were destroyed. The second shipment of R35s did not reach Poland prior to the outbreak of World War II.Jońca, Adam et al. (1990). Wrzesień 1939. Pojazdy wojska polskiego. Barwa i broń: WKiŁ, p. 64-65. . They were diverted by the French to Syria. =Romania= As part of a rearmament program of the late 1930s, Romania sought to obtain a license for the local manufacture of two hundred French Renault R35 infantry tanks. By early 1938, negotiations for establishing a factory for the production of R35 tanks had reached an advanced state. By this time France's own demands for rearmament prohibited further development, however. In August and September 1939, as a stopgap measure, forty-one R35s were supplied to the Royal Romanian Army. These tanks served as the principal tank of the newly formed 2nd Armoured Regiment. At the end of September 1939, an additional thirty-four brand new R35s passed into Romanian hands when the Polish 21st Light Tank Battalion (Batalion Czołgów Lekkich, or BCL) chose internment over capture following the German conquest of Poland and fled over the Romanian border. With seventy-five tanks on strength, the 2nd Armoured Regiment expanded into two battalions. After the Battle of Stalingrad, the Romanians decided that the R 35s required significant improvement of their anti-tank capacity. At first, the turret of an R 35 of the 2nd Tank Regiment of the 1st Tank Division was swapped for the turret of a captured Soviet T-26. Ultimately, at the beginning of 1943, it was decided to keep the thicker armor of the French turret. Thus, the 45 mm gun of the T-26 was adopted as a replacement for the original 37 mm gun. The Soviet gun was attached to the French turret with the help of an extension which contained the recoil mechanism of the 45 mm piece. The downside to this was that, following these modifications, there was no longer enough space in the turret to keep the coaxial machine gun, which was thus removed. The upgraded tanks were adopted as tank destroyers under the designation Vânătorul de care R35, with thirty R 35s converted until June 1944 by the Leonida factory in Bucharest. The Soviet 45 mm guns were taken from captured T-26 and BT-7 tanks. They were refurbished at the Army Arsenal in Târgoviște while the new gun mounts containing the recoil mechanism were made at the Concordia Works in Ploiești. These vehicles served until the end of the war. A significant amount of the original French- made parts, from both the original and converted R-35 tanks, was replaced by Romanian-produced spares in 1941-1942. Romanian factories produced drive sprockets, drive shafts, tracks, new metal-rimmed road wheels and cylinder heads. The wheels were designed locally to be ten times more durable. Added to these were the gun mounts for the 45 mm guns, added as turret extensions, which contained the recoil mechanism. Thus, the Romanian-converted R-35 had significant Romanian-manufactured parts in its hull, transmission and turret.Mark Axworthy, London: Arms and Armour, 1995, Third Axis, Fourth Ally: Romanian Armed Forces in the European War, 1941–1945, pp. 225-227 There were sixty R35 tanks in the Romanian inventory on 19 July 1944, thirty of which had been rearmed with 45 mm guns.Mark Axworthy, London: Arms and Armour, 1995, Third Axis, Fourth Ally: Romanian Armed Forces in the European War, 1941–1945, pp. 225-226 and 153 =France= On 10 May 1940, on the eve of the German invasion, in mainland France the R 35 equipped 21 battalions, each fielding 45 vehicles. This gave 945 R 35/R 40 tanks in the French front line units. Of these 900 were originally allocated at Army level in Groupements de Bataillons de Chars consisting of several battalions: \\"R 39\\" at the Musée des Blindés at Saumur next to an R 35. Notice the longer gun, in this case a postwar conversion for the Gendarmerie.

However, 135 R35s (2, 24 and the new 44 BCC) were allocated on 15 May to the provisional 4th DCR (Division Cuirassée de Réserve). Two more new battalions, the 40th and 48th Bataillion de Chars de Combat, though still not having completed training, were used to reinforce 2DCR, the first equipped with 15 R35s and 30 R40s, the second with 16 R35s and 29 R40s bringing the total organic strength to 1035. In addition the 1st and 2nd Tank Battalion of the Polish 10th Armoured Cavalry Brigade, at first training with FT 17's, were equipped with 17 R35s and about 24 R40s in late May; in June the R40s had been given back but replaced by 28 new ones. At the same time 1, 6, 25, 34 and 39 BCC were used to reconstitute 1DCR, 10 BCC reinforced 3DCR and 25 BCC was reconstituted with 21 R35s and 24 (ex-Polish) R40s. As about 300 tanks from the materiel reserve were issued to these units as well, around 800 of the 1440 available R35s ended up in armoured divisions after all. =French colonies= Two R35 battalions (63 and 68 BCC) with 45 and 50 tanks respectively were in Syria, a French mandate territory, and 30 were in Morocco, 26 serving with 62 BCC and four in depot. The tanks in Syria would fight during the allied invasion of that mandate territory in 1941 and then partly be taken over by the Free French 1e CCC, those in North Africa during Operation Torch in November 1942. =Germany= A Renault R35 in German service in 1942 4,7cm PaK(t) auf Panzerkampfwagen 35R(f) ohne Turm The majority (843) of R35s fell into German hands; 131 were used as such as Panzerkampfwagen 35R 731 (f), issued to panzer units and mainly used for security duties or driver training, or used on armoured trains; most were later rebuilt as artillery tractors and ammunition carriers after removing the turret. A considerable number, 174 according to some sources, were converted into a 47 mm tank destroyer to replace the Panzerjäger I: the 4,7 cm PaK(t) auf Panzerkampfwagen 35R(f) ohne Turm. The tank destroyer version had the turret replaced with an armoured superstructure mounting a, in the German designation, 47mm kanon P.U.V. vz. 36 (Škoda A6) anti-tank gun. The vehicles were converted by Alkett between May to October 1941 to try and make an equivalent vehicle to the Panzerjäger I. The result was not as successful as the Panzerjäger I, mainly due to the slow speed of the R 35 and the overloaded chassis. A few were deployed in Operation Barbarossa, most were deployed in occupied territories, such as the Channel Islands,Axis WWII Discussion Group: 4,7cm Pak(t) auf Panzerkampfwagen 35R(f) in Jersey.

Tobruk protecting the entrance to the bunker that now houses the Channel Islands Military Museum. This turret was originally mounted on a Tobruk at Saint Aubin's Fort, Jersey. Some of the turrets removed from the tanks were used on defensive fighting positions known as \\"Tobruks\\". This gave the Tobruk enhanced firepower and the gunner protection from shrapnel and small arms. Fourteen R 35 tanks, used to train tank drivers, equipped the 100. Panzer-Ersatz-Bataillon (100th Panzer Replacement Battalion) in the German Seventh Army in 1944. On 6 June 1944, they were among the first Armee-Reserve units sent into combat near Sainte-Mère-Église to oppose the American airborne landings in Normandy. Supporting a counterattack by the 1057th Grenadier Regiment, R35s penetrated the command post of the U.S. 1st Battalion 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment before being destroyed by bazooka fire. = Italy = The Royal Italian Army received 124 R35s with which the 4th Tank Infantry Regiment formed two battalions. The two battalions were assigned to the 131st Tank Infantry Regiment, which was deployed in January 1942 to Sicily. There, the regiment's CI Tank Battalion \\"R35\\" was assigned to the XII Army Corps defending the island's West, while the regiment with the CII Tank Battalion \\"R35\\" joined the XVI Army Corps defending the island's South. It used some of its R35s in defence of Gela on Sicily against US Rangers. 5th Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment was attacked by five R35s as it advanced towards Sortino; four were quickly knocked out but the fifth drove right through the battalion and carried on until it was knocked out by a 105 mm self-propelled gun near Floridia.B.S. Barnes, The Sign of the Double 'T' (The 50th Northumbrian Division – July 1943 to December 1944), Market Weighton: Sentinel Press, 2nd Edn 2008, , p. 10. =Other forces during the Second World War= Some of the tanks that Germany captured were given or sold to Germany's allies: Bulgaria received about forty. Three Polish vehicles in late 1939 found their way to Hungary. During the Syria-Lebanon Campaign, the Australian 2/6th Cavalry Commando Regiment's 'A' Squadron used four R35s that had been captured from the Vichy French. Switzerland took over twelve R 35s that had fled from France. After the German victory over Yugoslavia in 1941, the Independent State of Croatia took over some R35s that had not been destroyed when fighting 11. Panzerdivision on 13 and 14 April. =Syria and Lebanon= Syrian R-35 at Degania Alef. The R 35 saw combat in Syrian hands when five R 35s took part in an unsuccessful Syrian Army attack on the Jewish kibbutz Degania Alef in the Galilee on 20 May 1948. The kibbutz defenders, armed with a 20 mm anti- tank gun and Molotov cocktails, managed to knock out three R 35s, causing the remaining forces to retreat. One of the disabled R 35s remains near the kibbutz today as a memorial of the 1947–1949 Palestine war. A 1991 IDF probe proved that this R35 had been knocked out by a PIAT round. The Lebanese Army also incorporated a number of R 35s. Some of the Lebanese vehicles had been rebuilt with a British 40 mm Ordnance QF 2-pounder gun, seeing action in the 1958 Lebanon crisis. =Postwar France= Some R 35s served after the war in the Gendarmerie, as \\"R 39s\\" refitted with SA 38 guns.

In the collection of Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane. Justice Alfred James Peter Lutwyche (26 February 1810 – 12 June 1880) was the first judge of the Supreme Court Bench of Queensland. Early life Portrait of \\"Mrs (Mary) Lutwyche\\" by unknown painter, circa 1865–1880. In the collection of Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane. Lutwyche was the eldest son of John Lutwyche, of a Worcestershire family, who removed to London and started as a leather merchant, under the firm of Lutwyche & George, in Skinner Street, Snow Hill. Lutwyche was educated at Charterhouse School and at the Queen's College, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1828 and graduated B.A. in 1832, and subsequently M.A. While still at university, he had decided to pursue a career in law and became a student at the Middle Temple in London. After working in the legal areas of conveyancing and special pleadings, Lutwyche was called to the bar in May 1840. As a barrister, he went on the Oxford circuit. While he built up his practice as a barrister, he also supplemented his income and acquired some journalistic experience as a colleague of Charles Dickens, on the Morning Chronicle. Immigration Suffering poor health, Lutwyche decided to immigrate to Australia. In 1853, he embarked in London on the Meridian bound for Melbourne. The ship was wrecked on the Island of Amsterdam in the southern Indian Ocean. It was a miracle that almost all on board (apart from the captain, the cook and one passenger) survived. At the wreck site, they were faced with a 200-foot lava cliff, which the sailors scaled and then hauled up the passengers. The ship broke up before any provisions could be gathered, but they were able to catch fish, which enabled them to survive for 12 days before Captain Isaac Ludlow of the American whaler Monmouth found them and took them to Mauritius. Lutwyche then travelled on the Emma Colvin to Melbourne, arriving in December 1853. New South Wales Having entered the New South Wales Legislative Council, he was Solicitor General in the first Charles Cowper Ministry from September to October 1856, and represented the Government in the Upper House. He was again Solicitor General in the second Cowper Administration from September 1857 to November 1858, when he succeeded James Martin as Attorney-General. This post he resigned in February 1859. Queensland In February 1859 Lutwyche was appointed Resident Judge of what was then the Moreton Bay district of New South Wales. Two years later, in August 1861, he became sole Judge of the new Supreme Court of Queensland, and occupied the bench unaided until the arrival of the first Chief Justice, Sir James Cockle, in February 1863. But for a certain lack of self-restraint in his judgements and utterances, Mr. Lutwyche would himself have been appointed the first Chief Justice of Queensland, and he keenly felt the disallowance of his claims. Personal life In 1855, while in Sydney, Alfred Lutwyche married a widow, Mary Ann (Jane) Morris (née Simpson) at St Lawrence's Anglican Church. Jane (as she was commonly known) had 4 children from her marriage to George Henry Morris. The Morris family were also among the survivors of the 1853 wreck of the Meridian but George Morris succumbed to tuberculosis in 1854 in Sydney. Alfred and Jane Lutwyche had no children. Kedron Lodge, Kalinga, Qld. Residence of Justice Lutwyche. Lutwyche was a wealthy settler who owned vast tracts of land in Wooloowin and surrounding areas; the Kedron Lodge, his magnificent heritage-listed residence, still stands to this day in the affluent district of Kalinga. Early wooden St Andrew's Church at Lutwyche, 1888 In 1865, Lutwyche donated a block of land near Kedron Brook for the establishment of a new Anglican church, St Andrew's. A Gothic-style wooden church was built and opened on 30 November 1866. Lutwyche was an active member of the church and requested to be buried in the churchyard. He later donated a further acre of land adjacent to the church for a rectory. Death Monumental cross for Alfred Lutwyche, 2014 Inscription for his wife on the reverse, 2014 Memorial cards for Alfred James and Jane Lutwyche, buried in the churchyard of St Andrew's Anglican Church, Lutwyche, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia Lutwyche died at his residence, Kedron Lodge, 123 Nelson Street, Wooloowin in Brisbane on 12 June 1880 following a severe attack of gout in the preceding fortnight. As he had requested, he had a simple funeral (which was nonetheless hugely attended) and was buried in the churchyard of St Andrew's Anglican Church on Lutwyche Road on 15 June 1880. The service was conducted by Archdeacon Glennie and Rev. Love. His wife Jane arranged for a Celtic cross to be erected as a memorial over his grave on the southern side of the church. His widow Jane died at her residence Park Villa, Park Road, Lutwyche, Brisbane on 6 January 1891 and is buried with her husband in St Andrew's churchyard. A memorial cross at St Andrew's commemorates the couple. Legacy The north Brisbane inner-city suburb of Lutwyche, the Lutwyche Cemetery in Kedron, Lutwyche Road and the Kedron State High School sporting house are named in his honour.

The entry at AllMusic.com erroneously states that the 1953 issue was an album of four 78 RPM records. The 2004 Verve Master Series compact disc reissue includes facsimiles of both the 1953 and 1956 LP covers front and back, and Will Friedwald identifies the release as a 10-in LP in the liner notes.  History  By 1953, Lee had been recording professionally since joining the Benny Goodman Orchestra in 1941, but had only released songs on 78s or 45s. This was her first opportunity to record an album. In the early 1950s, record companies usually reserved the 12-in LP for classical music, and in the case of Decca and Columbia, cast recordings of Broadway musicals. This practice ended after this LP was recorded. Ten-inch records were discontinued generally by the mid-1950s. Lee added four songs at sessions in 1956 to expand the running time to the 12-in LP.

The three versions, although they all follow a similar storyline, are unique, especially the GBC version which is presented in 2D instead of 3D and has an almost completely different story. Each version of the game centers around the protagonist Alleron, who is wrongfully accused of committing necromancy by the Grand Inquisitor, and is exiled as a result. He is forced to wear the Mask of the Accused as a punishment for his crimes, which acts as a magnet to monsters. It is difficult to determine when the events of Warriors of Might take place in the Might and Magic timeline. However, it's speculated that it takes place in between Heroes of Might and Magic III and Heroes of Might and Magic IV.  Development  Development started soon after Crusaders of Might and Magic had been completed. The team learned from their mistakes and had wished to create a bigger and better game, however development was troubled as the team often clashed with The 3DO company. The game initially started development as a sequel to Crusaders of Might and Magic, however since Crusaders performed poorly in sales, 3DO opted to start with a new fresh idea. They thought that a new name and a new character might redeem their spinoff in the eyes of the fans, which would lead to better sales. Early screenshots of the game show it played from a first- person perspective; however this did not sit well with the marketing team at 3DO and this version was scrapped in favor of an action game due to marketing. 3DO's marketing team ordered specific alterations to be made to what was then Crusaders of Might and Magic 2, this resulted in the creation of Warriors of Might and Magic. The PC version did exist at some point; it was expected to release November 27, 2000 and would have followed the plot of the PS2 game and featured better graphics. It had been worked on and was approximately half way done but was ultimately scrapped for unknown reasons. The game's marketing utilized music from the Brazilian Rock Band Ratamahatta, as the track Sepultura https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiwqRSCWw2g can be heard in Warriors of Might and Magic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP233gXpZpY When creating the story the developers were interested in depicting the origin of the Ancients and Kreegans that appeared in previous Might and Magic games and attempted to recover continuity with the Might and Magic series. This was done by selecting enemies and spells that had appeared in previous iterations in the Might and Magic series of games. Reception The PlayStation version of Warriors of Might and Magic was mixedly received, earning a GameRankings score of 61%. It in particular has received a cult following status among gamers and is the best regarded version out of the three. However, the PlayStation 2 version holds a generally unfavorable averaged review score of 49% on Metacritic. Joe Fielder from GameSpot awarded it a score of 3.6. out of 10, opining \\"there's a decent game hidden here somewhere; it just exists under many layers of detritus.\\" IGN's Doug Perry awarded it a score of 5.0 out of 10, saying that it \\"hits the mark on a few cylinders, but its clumsy, redundant nature will put you to sleep, and for a videogame, which is by definition supposed to be 'entertaining', that's not a good sign.\\" Norman Chido reviewed the PlayStation 2 version of the game for Next Generation, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"Neither pretty nor especially fluid to control, Warriors isn't the step up from the awful Crusaders we'd hoped for.\\" Sequel The game (in its versions for the PS and PS2) was followed by a direct sequel titled Shifters, released for the PlayStation 2 in 2002. It follows the ending of both versions; taking place soon after their endings.

It is situated at 230 metres (755 ft) above sea level. The municipality covers a territory of 1244 km². Approximately 95% of the municipality's inhabitants are Mayan, spread over the town of Chisec and approximately 140 communities. (There used to be closer to 240 communities, but a number of these have officially split off to the new municipality of Raxruha, created by the Guatemalan Congress in 2008.) The Q'eqchi' language is widely spoken there alongside Spanish. History = Franja Transversal del Norte = The first settler project in the Franja Transversal del Norte (FTN) was in Sebol-Chinajá in Alta Verapaz. Sebol, then regarded as a strategic point and route through Cancuén river, which communicated with Petén through the Usumacinta River on the border with Mexico and the only road that existed was a dirt one built by President Lázaro Chacón in 1928. In 1958, during the government of General Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) financed infrastructure projects in Sebol.Sebol finally adopted the name \\"Fray Bartolomé de las Casas', municipality created in 1983 in Alta Verapaz. In 1960, then Army captain Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia inherited Saquixquib and Punta de Boloncó farms in northeastern Sebol. In 1963 he bought the farm \\"San Fernando\\" El Palmar de Sejux and finally bought the \\"Sepur\\" farm near San Fernando. During those years, Lucas was in the Guatemalan legislature and lobbied in Congress to boost investment in that area of the country. In 1962, the DGAA became the National Institute of Agrarian Reform (INTA), by Decree 1551 which created the law of Agrarian Transformation. In 1964, INTA defined the geography of the FTN as the northern part of the departments of Huehuetenango, Quiché, Alta Verapaz and Izabal and that same year priests of the Maryknoll order and the Order of the Sacred Heart began the first process of colonization, along with INTA, carrying settlers from Huehuetenango to the Ixcán sector in Quiché. The Northern Transversal Strip was officially created during the government of General Carlos Arana Osorio in 1970, by Decree 60-70 in the Congress, for agricultural development. Economy  = Oil potential = In 1971 the indigenous Q'eqchi's from 24 villages in the Cancuén area, in southern Petén and north of Chisec were evicted by the Army, because it was considered that the region was rich in oil. Since 1974, oil had been commercially extracted in the FTN vicinity following discoveries made by Shenandoah Oil and Basic Resources, which were operating together in the Rubelsanto oil field in Alta Verapaz. In 1976, when ten president Kjell Laugerud Garcia came to visit the Mayalán cooperative in Ixcán, Quiché -which was formed just 10 years before- said: \\"Mayalán is seated on top of the gold,\\" hinting that the North Transversal Strip would no longer be used for agriculture and the cooperative movement, but rather by strategic exploitation of natural resources. After that presidential visit, the two oil companies conducted exploration in Xacbal, near Mayalán in Ixcán, where they drilled the \\"San Lucas\\" well with unsuccessful results. These initial exploration, however, paved the way for future Ixcán and FTN oil experimentation, were also the main reason for building the dirt road that runs along the Strip. Shenandoah Oil, the National Institute of Agrarian Reform (INTA) and the Army Engineer Battalion coordinated the construction of that corridor between 1975 and 1979, which eventually allowed political, military and powerful businessmen of the time become owners of many lands where potential timber and oil wealth lay. High Guatemalan government officers became large landowners and investors taking advantage of the peasant transfer policies, privileged insider information, expansion of public credit and major development projects; the Army entered the business world with the Bank of the Army, pension funds and others. = African oil palm = African oil palm plantation areas in Guatemala as of 2014. There is a large demand within Guatemala and some of its neighbors for edible oils and fats, which would explain how the African oil palm became so prevalent in the country in detriment of other oils, and which has allowed new companies associated to large capitals in a new investment phase that can be found particularly in some territories that form the Northern Transversal Strip of Guatemala.

It is situated at 380 m above sea level. It has a population of about 16,500 people, many of Q'eqchi' Maya descent. It covers an area of 208 km².  History  =Settlement by the Order of Preachers= Lanquín, one of the native settlement conquered peacefully by the Order of Preachers -among them: Pedro de Angulo, O.P., Luis de Cáncer, O.P. and Rodrigo de la Cebra, O.P.- was established in 1540. In the 1540s, its first Catholic chapel was built, with the name of \\"San Agustín Lanquín\\". According to this historical records, it was elevated to the municipality category in 1846, and its first mayor was Crisanto Beb, honorable native. =20th century= In May 1956, an executive action by colonel coronel Carlos Castillo Armas declared Lanquín a National Park due to its natural beauty, which is one of the main tourist attractions in Guatemala. Later, in 1970, Lanquín was promoted to National Monument and, finally, in 1997 -by another executive action- it was declared as a National Cultural Patrimony. In the 1960s, the importance of the region was in livestock, exploitation of precious export wood and archaeological wealth. Timber contracts we granted to multinational companies such as Murphy Pacific Corporation from California, which invested US$30 million for the colonization of southern Petén and Alta Verapaz, and formed the North Impulsadora Company. Colonization of the area was made through a process by which inhospitable areas of the Franja Transversal del Norte (FTN) were granted to native peasants. In 1964, the National Institute for Agrarian Transformation (INTA) defined the geography of the FTN as the northern part of the departments of Huehuetenango, Quiché , Alta Verapaz and Izabal and that same year priests of the Maryknoll order and the Order of the Sacred Heart began the first process of colonization, along with INTA, carrying settlers from Huehuetenango to the Ixcán sector in Quiché. The Northern Transversal Strip was officially created during the government of General Carlos Arana Osorio in 1970, by Decree 60-70 in the Congress, for agricultural development. The area included within the municipalities: San Ana Huista, San Antonio Huista, Nentón, Jacaltenango, San Mateo Ixtatán, and Santa Cruz Barillas in Huehuetenango; Chajul and San Miguel Uspantán in Quiché; Cobán, Chisec, San Pedro Carchá, Lanquín, Senahú, Cahabón and Chahal, in Alta Verapaz and the entire department of Izabal.  Culture  The culture of the municipality is enriched by the q'eqchi' people's view of Cosmos and Nature, which has a strong influence in the community. The basic principle of the q'eqchi' culture is one of respect towards their surroundings -fauna and flora, in general-; however, in the later years, this principle is being threatened by other culture influences. The concept of trust is important for business and all kind of transactions, being even more important than the judiciary and legal documents; this comes from the fact that the q'eqchi culture is one that assumes responsibility and considers that cleanliness, punctuality and respect are elements of trust.  Religion  It is estimated that around 65% of the population is Roman Catholic, although there have been evangelical Christian settlements that have slowly grown in the area in the last twenty years. The Q'eqchi population has kept its ancestral customs of communication with nature and cosmos; however, there is not a single statistical study of what portion of the population actually keeps the traditions alive, although it is clear that it has been decreasing rapidly. Within the municipality there are two known native altars, one in the Grutas and another one in Semuc Champey, although it is believed that town elders are aware of more important altars that they keep for themselves.  Main celebration and annual fair  In Guatemala, the main human settlement celebrate their annual fair based on the Catholic Saint that is celebrated on the day the town was established. In general, these celebrations include fireworks, traditional food stands, children games, Christian celebrations and popular dances. In Lanquín, the annual fair takes place from 24 to 28 August, being the 28 the main event, since it is the date the Catholic Church celebrates Saint Augustine.  Tourism  Al large cave complex known as Grutas de Lanquín is located at only one kilometer from the capital city of the municipality and 11 km south of Lanquín runs the Cahabon River and one can find the Semuc Champey natural monument. Lanquín is often the starting point of the tourist excursions to Semuc Champey.

On 29 May 1978, the village of Panzós was the site of a massacre in which between 30 and 106 local inhabitants (figures vary) were killed by the army. The name Panzós means \\"place of the green waters\\", in reference to the nearby Polochic River and swamps full of alligators and birds.  History  The Polochic river valley was originally inhabited by Q'eqchi' and Poqomchi' peoples. The first Spanish settlement, according to Domingo Juárez, was founded there on 11 October 1825; however, other historians specify 11 October 1861 as its foundation date. Later on, government decree #38 of 1871, in which all Guatemalan municipalities were asked to elect representatives to the National Assembly shows Panzós a town in District 35. In 1891, Panzós became part of Alta Verapaz Department for good. After the Liberal revolution of 1871, president Justo Rufino Barrios (1873-1885) and started granting land to German settlers in the area. By Decree #170 (or Census Decree) the government allowed confiscation of Indigenous land that had remained protected until then, to make it easier for the Germans and liberal military officers to get land of their own. Since then, the main commercial and agricultural activity in the region has been coffee, cardamom and bananas.Testimony, in the Center of Social History Research. Panzós: CEIHS, 1979. Thus, the main characteristics of the productive system of those years was the accumulation of land by a few owners, and a sort of \\"hacienda servitude\\", based on the legal exploitation of the natives. In the 1880s, Panzós had become a very important commercial river port, heavily used for coffee exports the finished product was carried by oxen carts over poorly kept roads, or on small boats through creeks to the port, and from there it was loaded into larger ships and sent to the Caribbean Sea and then on to Europe or other destinations. This archaic system changed drastically in the 1890s, once the Verapaz Railroad was built. =Verapaz Railroad= The Verapaz Railroad began on 15 January 1894 with a contract for 99 years between Guatemala -then ruled by president José María Reina Barrios- and Walter Dauch, representative of the Verapaz Railroad & Northern Agency Ltd. The contract settled the rules for the construction, maintenance and exploitation of a 30-mile railroad line between Panzós and Pancajché. Passenger service travelled twice a week, on Mondays and Thursdays; besides, mail arrived by ship every Wednesday and cargo came from Livingston, Izabal. Besides, there were train stops in Santa Rosita, Santa Catalina La Tinta, and Papalhá. In 1898, it was reported that given the coffee prosperity in Cobán, which in those days was the third largest city in Guatemala, the railroad was going to be extended to that city. The railroad was in operation until 1965, when it was superseded by truck and highways. Image:Ferrocarrilverapaz1895.jpgVerapaz Railroad maiden voyage in 1894.

The decree stated: \\"It is of public interest and national emergency, the establishment of Agrarian Development Zones in the area included within the municipalities: Santa Ana Huista, San Antonio Huista, Nentón, Jacaltenango, San Mateo Ixtatán, and Santa Cruz Barillas in Huehuetenango; Chajul and San Miguel Uspantán in Quiché; Cobán, Chisec, San Pedro Carchá, Lanquín, Senahú, Cahabón and Chahal, in Alta Verapaz and the entire department of Izabal.\\" On 27 May 1978, when natives from San Vicente (in Panzós) went to work the land on the shores of the Polochic river, the sons of a local landlord showed up with several armed soldiers, and intimidated the natives to stop demanding land for themselves. The same day, the military detained two peasants in La Soledad, and roughed up several more. There was a small disturbance and one of the peasants was killed. On 28 May, peasants from La Soledad and Cahaboncito presented a document previously prepared by FASGUA to mayor Walter Overdick Garcia, in order for him to read it out loud. In that document, FASGUA asked the mayor to mediate \\"for the peasants' sake and try to solve the problems they had\\".Comisión de Solidaridad con Panzós memorandum, 12 July 1978. On 29 May 1978, to pressure the authorities for their land demands and to protest against the abuses of landlords and military and civil authorities, peasants from the settlements of Cahaboncito, Semococh, Rubetzul, Canguachá, Sepacay, Moyagua and La Soledad, decided to protest in downtown Panzós. Hundreds of native men, women and children went to the central square, bringing along their machetes and other agricultural instruments. One of those who participated in the demonstration later recalled: \\"the idea was not to fight anybody, we only wanted to clarify the land situation. People came from various locations and they did not have firearms with them\\".

The town was established on 3 May 1543, according to the minutes from 1 May 1546 taken in Ciudad Real de San Juan Chamelco by Juan Matalbatz, governor of the region at the time. The Catholic church was built in the 16th century and therefore it has a high historical value; like the one in Rabinal in Baja Verapaz Department, it was one of the first Catholic temples built in the region during the Capitulaciones de Tezulutlán.

It is situated at 1,465 m above sea level. The municipality has a population of 38,052 and covers an area of 102 km². The languages spoken in Tactic are predominantly Spanish, Poqomchi', and Q'eqchi'.  History  = Pre-Hispanic era = Before Columbus, there were only ceremonial centers in the area; these centers were located in Chiáchan, Guaxpac, Janté, Chiji, Cuyquel, Patal, Pansalché and Chiacal. And there also was a ceremonial hill in Chi-ixim, where the caciques, priest and other leaders gathered to celebrate every new moon; Chicán was the second ceremonial center in importance. = Order of Preachers in the Vera Paz= Fray Bartolomé de las Casas, O.P. who along friars Rodrigo de Landa, Pedro Angulo and Luis de Cáncer, O.P, started Vera paz Christian indoctrination in 1542. Between 1530 and 1531, captain Alonso de Ávila on his way to Ciudad Real accidentally discovered the lagoon and hill of Lacam-Tún. People of that place had historically traded with all the people that the Spaniards had conquered and knowing what was coming, seek refuge in the jungle. The Spaniards tried in vain to conquer the lacandones: from Nueva España Juan Enríquez de Guzman tried; from the Yucatán Peninsula tried Francisco de Montejo; Pedro de Alvarado attempted it from Guatemala along with captain Francisco Gil Zapata and, finally, Pedro Solórzano from Chiapas. That is when the Order of Preachers tried to convert the Tezulutlán \\"War Zone\\" into a peaceful region. In the meantime, after a series of setbacks in La Española, the island Audiencia allowed Bartolomé de las Casas to accept Friar Tomás de Berlanga invitation to go to Nueva Granada in 1534, where he had just been appoint as Bishop. Both sailed toward Panamá, to then continue to the city of Lima, but during the trip a storm tossed their ship to Nicaragua, where Las Casas chose to remain in the Granada convent. in 1535, he proposed to the King and the Indias Council to start a peaceful colonization of the unexplored rural zones in the Guatemala region; however, in spite of Bernal Díaz de Luco and Mercado de Peñaloza intentions to help him, his suggestion was rejected. In 1536 Nicaragua governor, Rodrigo de Contreras, organized a military expedition, but Las Casas was able to postpone it by a couple of years after he notified queen Isabel de Portugal, wife of Carlos V. Given the authorities hostilities, Las Casas left Nicaragua y went to Guatemala. On November 1536, Las Casas settled in Santiago de Guatemala, then the capital of Guatemala; a few months later, his friend bishop Juan Garcés, invited him to move to Tlascala, but after a few weeks he came back to Guatemala. On May 2, 1537 governor Alfonso de Maldonado granted him the Tezulutlán Capitulations - a written commitment ratified on July 6, 1539 by Antonio de Mendoza, México Viceroy- in which everybody agreed that Tezulutlán natives, once conquered, would not be given as encomienda but would be King's subjects. Las Casas, along with friars Rodrigo de Landa, Pedro Angulo and Luis de Cancer, looked for four Christian nataives and taught them Christian hymns where the Gospel basic principles were explained. Luis de Cancer visited the cacique of Sacapulas and was able to perform the first baptisms among his people. Later, Las Casas lead a retinue to bring girts to the cacique, who was so impressed, that decided to convert and become his people preacher. The cacique was baptized with the name of «Don Juan» and the natives granted permission to build a small church; however, Cobán, another cacique, burned the church. «Don Juan», along sixty men, Las Casas and Pedro Angulo, went to talk to Cobán's people and convinced them of their good intentions; «Don Juan» even took the initiative to marry one of his daughters with cacique Cobán by the Catholic Church. In 1539 pope Paul III had authorized the diocese of Ciudad Real; Ciudad Real diocesis included Chiapas, Soconusco, la Vera Paz (including the Lacandon jungle), Tabasco and the still non-conquered Yucatán Peninsula. That year, Alonso de Maldonado -under pressure by Spanish settlers- began a military campaign in Tezulutlán y gave all the natives in encomiendas. This flagrant violation to the Capitulations enraged Las Casas who traveled to Spain to denounce it before the king Charles V. On January 9, 1540 a royal document was issued in which the Tezulutlán Capitulations ere ratified and gave the region to the protection of the Order of Preachers. On October 17 of that year, Cardinal García de Loaysa -then president of the Indias Council- ordered the México Audiencia to comply with these laws. The Capitulations were officially published on January 21, 1541 in the church of Sevilla. Las Casas was appointed bishop of Chiapas in 1544, but he tried to apply the new lays in his diocese, these were flatly rejected by the encomenderos. In 1545, Guatemala bishop Francisco Marroquín visited Tezulutlán y met with the preachers. Back in the city of Gracias a Dios, where the Audiencia de los Confines had its main office- met with Las Casas and with Nicaragua bishop Antonio de Valdivieso. There was a lot of tension between Marroquín and Las Casas in this meeting: Las Casas accused Marroquín of having slave Indians and to have a repartimiento along with preaching \\"toxic doctrine\\"; Marroquín on the other hand, accused Las Casas of going beyond his jurisdiction. The conflict moved on to Ciudad de México and finally everybody agreed to favor the freedom of the natives; however, this could not be accomplished for the Lacandon Jungle would not be conquered for another two century, becoming the rebel maya people favorite hideout. Las Casas and Angulo founded Rabinal, and the city of Cobán was the center of the new Catholic doctrine. A few years later, the natives started settling following the Spanish model and several towns were settled, like Tactic. The name \\"War zone\\" was change for \\"Vera Paz\\" (true peace), name that became official in 1547. On July 2, 1545 Tactic celebrated its first baptisms. = Independence and German settlers = On December 10, 1877 president Justo Rufino Barrios executive order moved Tactic from the Baja Verapaz department to Alta Verapaz; its first mayor was Miguel Peláez in 1900. Ca. 1890, British archeologist Alfred Percival Maudslay came to Guatemala, and traveled the Verapaz; he described Tactic as follows: «Towards evening we reached the ugly little wind-swept hamlet of Tactic, the usual resting-place for travelers between Cobán and the port of Panzós. Travelers must often fare badly, for one small inn, containing a single bedroom, was all the accommodation the village appeared to afford ; and but for Mr. Thomae's forethought in telegraphing to secure this room for us, we might have had to share the verandah for the night with native travellers, arrieros, and dogs, and probably have gone supperless to bed. At Tactic we left the cart-road leading to Panzos, which, after surmounting the divide, strikes the source of the Rio Polochic, and follows its banks to the eastward.\\" Around the time that Maudslay was visiting Verapaz, a German colony had settled in the area thanks to generous concessions granted by liberal presidents Manuel Lisandro Barillas Bercián, José María Reyna Barrios and Manuel Estrada Cabrera. The Germans had a very united and solid community and had several activities in the German Club (Deutsche Verein), in Cobán, which they had founded in 1888. Their main commercial activity was coffee plantations. German influence remained in Verapaz even after the German settlers were expelled and their possessions confiscated by the government after Germany defeat in both World War I and World War II.

Established in 1847, its history, influence, and wealth have made it one of the most prestigious schools in Asia. It is located in the Kasauli Hills, District Solan, Himachal Pradesh, India. Sanawar is about an hour's drive from Chandigarh. The school, founded by Sir Henry Lawrence and his wife Honoria, is one of the oldest surviving boarding schools. As the school is located in Sanawar, the school is popularly called \\"Sanawar\\". It is situated at a height of 1,750 metres and spread over an area of 139 acres, heavily forested with pine, deodar and other conifer trees. The school has been ranked among the best residential schools of India. In May 2013 Sanawar created history by becoming the first school in the world to send a team of seven students and climb Mount Everest.http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/six- sanawar-school-boys-scale-mount-everest/1/272345.html The motto of the school is \\"Never Give In\\".

Retrieved 6 March 2012 Children are admitted to Sanawar in February each year, at the age of nine and ten years. Class Five (Lower III) is preferred as the entry point.

In 1845 he outlined the creation of a boarding school in the Indian highlands for boys and girls.Dane Keith Kennedy, The Magic Mountains: hill stations and the British raj (1996), p. 136 He stated his aim as being to create Maharaja Gulab Singh, a large contributor to the founding of the school The school at Sanawar was established as the first such asylum on 15 April 1847, when fourteen girls and boys arrived at Sanawar in the charge of Lawrence's sister-in-law Mrs George Lawrence and a superintendent Healey.Edward Backhouse Eastwick, ed., Handbook of the Punjab, western Rajputana, Kashmir, and upper Sindh (John Murray, 1883), p. 172: \\"In April, 1847, Mrs. George Lawrence arrived at Sanawar with 14 girls and boys, and Surgeon Healy acted as superintendent.\\" The school was co-educational from its beginning.Outlook (Hathway Investments Pvt Ltd, 1997), p. 98 The site had been chosen by Lawrence, after discussions with William Hodson and others, considering that it was an \\"ideal location\\" which \\"afforded the necessary requisites: isolation, ample space, water, a good altitude, and all not too far from British troops\\".Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research vol. 81 (issues 325-328) (London: Society for Army Historical Research, 2003), p. : \\"After discussing the merits of a suitable site with Hodson and others it was decided that the school would be established on the hill of Sanawar, near Kasauli. This ideal location afforded the necessary requisites: isolation, ample space, water, a good altitude, and all not too far from British troops.\\" The construction of the buildings was paid for by Lawrence and other British officers, with a large contribution from Gulab Singh, the first Maharaja of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. Hodson, who later became famous for Hodson's Horse, supervised the construction of the school's first buildings and is still commemorated by the annual Hodson's Run, a competition between the school's houses.Hodson of Hodson's Horse in The Sanawar News Letter, 1 May 1997 edition. Retrieved 22 March 2012 In the early days some Anglo-Indian children were admitted, but Lawrence insisted that preference should be given to those of \\"pure European\\" parentage, as he considered they were more likely to suffer from the heat of the plains. Under its first professional headmaster, the Rev. W. J. Parker, who was appointed in 1848, the school was known as \\"Lawrence's Asylum\\", reflecting its focus on orphans.'Photocopies and transcripts of extracts from diaries and papers of Maj-Gen William Clive Justice (1835-1908): 11: Copy of letter from Sir Henry Lawrence to Rev W. J. Parker' at India Office select materials Mss Photo Eur 433, web site of the British Library. Retrieved 10 March 2012 In 1858 it was renamed the \\"Lawrence Royal Military School\\". Sir Henry Lawrence, founder By 1853, the school had grown to 195 pupils when it was presented with the King's Colour, one of only seven schools and colleges ever to be so honoured in the British Empire, the others being Eton, Shrewsbury, Cheltenham, the Duke of York's Royal Military School the Royal Military College, Sandhurst and the Lawrence Memorial Royal Military School, Lovedale. Sanawar has held its Colour for the longest unbroken period. The tradition of military training at Sanawar has always been strong and was of such a high standard that several contingents of boys were enlisted from the school and sent straight to the battlefields of the First World War. In appreciation of this, the school was redesignated in 1920 as the \\"Lawrence Royal Military School\\" and, in 1922, the Prince of Wales presented the school with new Colours. This pattern of military service was repeated again during the Second World War and, according to a BBC Radio broadcast on 3 October 1941, more than two hundred Sanawarians had joined up. The school Colour continues to this day to be trooped at the Founders' Celebration in early October, and Sanawar pupils continue to make a major contribution to the defence of the country. In its first two decades, the school suffered an unexpectedly high death rate, with forty children dying between 1848 and 1858, of whom thirteen were the victims of an outbreak of cholera in 1857. In the next ten years, there were seventy-two further deaths, and in 1870 a Punjab Medical Department report proposed measures to improve the school's sanitation, as well as \\"a separate hospital for the treatment of contagious diseases\\". The headmaster, the Rev. John Cole, was inspired to write a book called Notes on Hygiene with Hints on Self-discipline for Young Soldiers in India (1882).Mark Harrison, Public Health in British India: Anglo-Indian Preventive Medicine (1994), p. 263Ajay Sura, Few Sanawarians want to join Army from The Times of India dated 4 December 2011, online at indiatimes.com. Retrieved 25 April 2012 Sanawar's centenary year (1947) was crucial to the development of the school. With Indian independence, the bulk of the staff and children at Sanawar returned to Britain. However, the then-Governor General, Lord Louis Mountbatten, presided at the centenary celebrations and read out a message from King George VI. Thereafter, control of the school passed from the Crown to the government of India's Ministry of Defence. A further transfer in 1949 brought the school under the control of the Ministry of Education. In June 1952 the Ministry resolved to administer the school through a society created under the Societies Registration Act 1860, subject to a Memorandum of Association and rules and regulations to be approved by the government. These provided that the government Secretaries in the Ministries of Education, Defence, and Finance would serve as ex-officio members of the society, with four other members appointed by the government. The employees of the school, previously government servants, lost that status.Mohinder Singh vs Union Of India (15 May, 1968); AIR 1969 Delhi 170 at indiankanoon.org.

Gameplay  The game is a simplified version of Breakout where the \\"ball\\" is made to look like a nude man and the \\"bricks\\" are made to look like nude women and the man bounces back and forth horizontally rather than vertically. On the left, he is repelled by a woman with whom he collides and subsequently eliminates from play, or by the opposing wall. On the right, a paddle (said to be a container of aphrodisiac \\"Spanish Fly\\" in the manual) returns the depleted bachelor to the room full of women. The paddle is controlled by the player using a paddle controller. The premise is that of an unnamed bachelor having his final fling with a room full of inexplicably nude women. The equally unclothed bachelor is propelled repeatedly into the room of women by a container of \\"Spanish Fly\\" used as the player's paddle. When entering the fray, the bachelor's exaggerated and pixelated penis is seen to be erect. When he returns from having collided with (and presumably had sexual intercourse with) a woman or after hitting the opposing wall, his penis sags. It returns to erect when the bachelor is successfully set moving again toward the left. A second version of the game, titled Bachelorette Party, also exists. It has no difference in gameplay, but has the game sprites reversed: The player uses the paddle to bounce a naked woman toward naked men.

He was first officer on during its second survey mission, 1831-1836, under captain Robert FitzRoy. The young naturalist and geologist Charles Darwin was a supernumerary on the ship, and his journal was published as The Voyage of the Beagle. After that expedition, Wickham was promoted to Commander and made captain of the Beagle on its third voyage, from 1837 and conducted various maritime expeditions and hydrographic surveys along the Australian coastline. In 1843, after his retirement from the Royal Navy, Wickham was made Police Magistrate and, later, Government Resident of the Moreton Bay District, in the Colony of New South Wales (NSW). Wickham retired in 1859, when the Moreton Bay District was separated from NSW, forming basis of the Colony of Queensland. When the Queensland and NSW governments disagreed over which was responsible for his pension, Wickham moved to France, where he died. The Wickham family The origins of the Wickham family were in Rowley, an East Yorkshire village which later became depopulated.C.G. Drury Clarke, \\"Captain John Clements Wickham, R.N. his antecedents and descendants\\" (1984) Journal of the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, Vol. 12 no. 1, pp 1–25 . In 1638, two brothers, Richard and Thomas Wickham, were among the families to emigrate to America with Rev. Ezekiel Rogers after he was suspended as Rector of the parish church in 1638 for his non-conformist beliefs.Rev. Philip Graystone. \\"Elizabeth Jackson of Rowley\\" (1993, Lampada Press, Hull) . Thomas married Sarah and their fifth son, Samuel Wickham, was born in 1664; he later settled in Rhode Island and became a Freeman of that Colony and a Deputy. Samuel Wickham married Barbara Holken in 1691 and their fifth son, Benjamin Wickham, was born 17 November 1701 at Rhode Island. Benjamin was chosen by the Rhode Island colonial Assembly in 1756 to be Lieutenant-Colonel of a Regiment raised for the second expedition against Crown Point. In 1757, a deputy for Newport he became Speaker of the House of Deputies. Benjamin married Mary, daughter of Colonel John Gardner in 1743 and Samuel Wickham, their sixth and youngest son, was born at Newport, Rhode Island in 1758. This Samuel rose to the rank of Lieutenant in the Royal Navy; while he was attached to the Portuguese Navy as an instructor he was given the rank of Captain-Lieutenant. He fought on the British side in the American War of Independence after which he left America and settled in Scotland. On 16 June 1795 he married Ellen Susan Naylor at Gibraltar. John Clements Wickham was born to them on 21 November 1798 at Leith in Scotland.C. G. Austin, \\"Newstead House and Capt. Wickham, R.N.\\", (1947) Journal of the Historical Society of Queensland, Vol. 3 no. 6, pp 459–465, .  Naval career  On 21 February 1812 John Clements Wickham joined the Royal Navy. By 1815 he was an Admiralty Midshipman and was posted to HMS Nightingale and in 1818 was posted to HMS Hyperion before being paid off. He passed his Lieutenant's examination in 1819. Captain Wickham, In 1825 he was appointed Second-Lieutenant on the British warship Adventure under the command of Phillip Parker King, son of Philip Gidley King, third Governor of New South Wales. The Adventure and the Beagle were ordered to survey the coasts of the southern part of South America, including Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego. Wickham transferred to the Beagle in 1831 as First Lieutenant, under Captain Robert Fitzroy and first officer Philip Parker King (1791-1856), to complete the survey of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, as part of a circumnavigation of the globe. Wickham and King were lifelong friends and brothers-in-law as they married sisters, the daughters of Hannibal Hawkins Macarthur. This would be the most famous voyage of the Beagle, with naturalist Charles Darwin, and artists Augustus Earle and (later) Conrad Martens also on board. After entering the Pacific Ocean, the Beagle surveyed the coasts of Chile and Peru, the Galápagos Islands, the Society Islands, the Navigator (Samoa) and Fiji island groups, New Zealand, Port Jackson (Sydney), Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania), King George's Sound, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Mauritius. It then returned, via Saint Helena, Ascension Island, Bahia and Pernambuco to England in 1836. On 10 January 1837, Wickham was promoted from Lieutenant to Captain and given command of the Beagle, while Lt John Lort Stokes - a shipmate from the first two journeys of the Beagle - was made first officer.\\"From the London Gazette\\". Caledonian Mercury [Edinburgh, Scotland], 14 January 1837 (British Library Gale Document No. BB3205424269; accessed 14 September 2011). From 1837 to 1841, the Beagle charting the coasts of north western Australia and Arnhem Land. In 1839, Stokes sighted a natural harbour which Wickham named Port Darwin after their former shipmate.The port became the site of the first enduring settlement on the north coast: Darwin, later capital and most populous city of the Northern Territory. In 1841, Wickham fell ill and resigned his command which was taken over by Stokes, who continued the survey and completed the voyage in 1843. Darwin also took a Galápagos tortoise named Harriet which he gave to Wickham, who brought it to Brisbane. The tortoise gained fame for her longevity, living 175 years until 2006.  Later life  Wickham became the police magistrate at the Moreton Bay District of New South Wales (now Queensland).L. E. Skinner, \\"Law and justice for the Queensland colony\\", (1972) Journal of the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, Vol. 9 no. 3 pp 94-106. From 1853 he was Government Resident of the Moreton Bay District and resided at Newstead House, Brisbane. In 1859, Wickham moved to the south of France, where he lived until his death in 1864.A. A.

Early life Burns was born and raised in Ambridge, Pennsylvania, a small steel town approximately 15 miles northwest of Pittsburgh on the Ohio River. He is a graduate of Ambridge Area High School and of Westminster College in Pennsylvania. Television career Burns began his television career at WQED, the PBS station in Pittsburgh, hosting a cultural affairs program in the studio adjacent to the studio in which Mister Rogers' Neighborhood was produced. Burns and Rogers went on to develop a close friendship, with the latter becoming a kind of mentor to the former. When Rogers died, the obituary that Burns broadcast stated that \\"no one has ever put television to nobler, more societally beneficial use than Fred Rogers.\\" After Pittsburgh, Burns went on to make stops in Parkersburg, West Virginia, where he was an anchorman and news director; and Minneapolis, where he was a reporter and anchorman. His work in Minneapolis caught the attention of NBC News executives in New York, and after a year and a half at station KMSP, Burns was hired as a national correspondent for NBC in 1976. Assigned first to the network's Chicago bureau, he was then moved to New York, with occasional overseas postings in Europe and northern Africa. He appeared regularly on NBC Nightly News and on The Today Show. Burns was fired in 2008 after 10 years of hosting Fox News Watch on the Fox News Channel. The New York Times said Burns acted as \\"the ringmaster for a relatively even-handed roundtable discussion about the media.\\" Vanity Fair magazine once called Fox News Watch one of only two programs on the network worth watching. On March 9, 2015, Eric, as a former Fox News Watch host, told CNN's Brian Stelter, “I’m saying that the people who watch Fox News are cult-ish,\\" and that because of \\"their audience loyalty, ... O’Reilly, as the head of the cult, is not held to the same standards as Brian Williams.” Literary career Burns is an author who has written fifteen books, two of which won the highest award given by the American Library Association for volumes published by a university press. Named as the \\"Best of the Best\\" were The Spirits of America: A Social History of Alcohol, and its companion-piece, The Smoke of the Gods: A Social History of Tobacco. Burns is the only non-academic ever to win the award twice. Those two books, and his biggest-seller, Infamous Scribblers: The Founding Fathers and the Rowdy Beginnings of American Journalism, which was a selection of both the Book of the Month Club and the History Book Club, are among five of Burns's book to have been \\"adopted\\" by various college curricula for courses in journalism, American history, and American Studies. Infamous Scribblers is considered the definitive work on journalism during the colonial era. (Burns appeared on \\"The Daily Show\\" to promote\\" Infamous Scribblers. The interview is available by Googling \\"Jon Stewart/Eric Burns.) More recently, Burns published \\"1920\\": The Year That Made the Decade Roar.\\" It was named by Kirkus one of the best non-fiction books of 2015. Burns has also written for a number of magazines, including Reader's Digest, The Weekly Standard, Family Circle, Spy, and the pre-Rupert Murdoch version of TV Guide. In addition, he has written for the Los Angeles Times, New York Post, and The Huffington Post, among other print outlets. Burns is also a playwright. His first play, Mid-Strut opened in February 2012 at the Pittsburgh Playhouse and closed two weeks later.

The film marks the directorial debut of Moxey.https://www.allmovie.com/movie/horror- hotel-v23149/review It was produced in the United Kingdom but set in America, and the British actors were required to speak with North American accents throughout.  Plot  In 1692 in fictional Whitewood, Massachusetts, a witch named Elizabeth Selwyn is burned at the stake. Before her death, Selwyn and her accomplice, Jethrow Keane, sold their souls to Lucifer for eternal life and revenge on Whitewood in return for providing the Devil with two yearly virgin human sacrifices on the Hour of Thirteen during Candlemas Eve and the Witches' Sabbath. In the present day, following his lecture on witchcraft, a university history professor, Alan Driscoll, advises an interested student named Nan Barlow to visit Whitewood during her vacation to slake her interest in witchcraft by studying Whitewood's history. Nan settles in The Raven's Inn, a hotel owned by eccentric Mrs. Newless, becoming acquainted with the only normal-seeming local resident Patricia Russell, who loans her a book on witchcraft. Reading the book, Nan learns that this night is Candlemas Eve. She is lured down to the basement and is restrained on a satanic altar by Mrs. Newless and members of her coven. Mrs. Newless reveals herself to be Elizabeth Selwyn before proceeding to sacrifice Nan. Two weeks later, Nan's concerned fiancé, Bill Maitland, and her brother, Richard, learn The Raven's Inn does not exist in any phone directory. They are visited by Patricia, who is also concerned with Nan's disappearance. The men travel separately to Whitewood, and Bill barely survives a car crash caused by an apparition of Selwyn. Richard reaches Whitewood and meets up with Patricia before visiting her grandfather, Reverend Russell, who reveals that Whitewood is under the control of Selwyn's coven. Soon after, Patricia is kidnapped as the coven's sacrifice, and Richard attempts to save her before they are cornered in the graveyard. Professor Driscoll is revealed to be a coven member. A severely-injured Bill arrives at the last minute and succeeds in extricating a large wooden cross from the ground. After being gravely wounded by Selwyn, Bill uses the last of his strength to burn the coven members alive under the cross's shadow. Selwyn escapes during the chaos. Her pact with the Devil has been undone by the intervention, and Richard and Patricia find her charred corpse in the hotel which is revealed to have been built on the site of her burning.  Cast  * Christopher Lee as Alan Driscoll - Professor/warlock * Dennis Lotis as Richard 'Dick' Barlow - Nan's brother * Patricia Jessel as Elizabeth Selwyn / Mrs. Newless * Tom Naylor as Bill Maitland - Nan's fiancé * Betta St. John as Patricia Russell - Citizen of Whitewood * Venetia Stevenson as Nan Barlow - Student * Valentine Dyall as Jethrow Keane * Ann Beach as Lottie - Maid at Raven's Inn * Norman MacOwan as Reverend Russell - Pat's grandfather * Fred Johnson as The Elder * James Dyrenforth as Garage Attendant * Maxine Holden as Sue - Friend * William Abney as Policeman  Production  The script was originally written by George Baxt as a pilot for a television series starring Boris Karloff. The producer Milton Subotsky rewrote it to be longer, including a romantic subplot about the boyfriend who goes looking for Nan after she goes missing. Financing was obtained from television producer Hannah Weinstein, along with money from the Nottingham Forest Football Club. Production began on 12 October 1959 at Shepperton Studios with a budget of £45,000. Milton Subotsky was credited as the film's executive producer. The film was produced by Vulcan Productions, although because it was made by Subotsky and producing partner Max Rosenberg it has been considered the first of their Amicus Productions. = Deleted lines = Some dialogue was removed the American version of the film, including the following lines in the opening sequence which clarify the plot. They are retained in the original British version, which has been shown on Turner Classic Movies: * \\"I have made my pact with thee, O Lucifer! Hear me, hear me! I will do thy bidding for all eternity. For all eternity shall I practice the ritual of Black Mass. For all eternity shall I sacrifice unto thee. I give thee my soul, take me into thy service.\\" * \\"O Lucifer, listen to thy servant, grant her this pact for all eternity and I with her, and if we fail thee but once, you may do with our souls what you will.\\" * \\"Make this city an example of thy vengeance. Curse it, curse it for all eternity! Let me be the instrument of thy curse. Hear me, O Lucifer, hear me!\\" Release The City of the Dead was released in September 1960 in the United Kingdom. It was a box-office disappointment, although it did make a small profit. It was not released in the United States until 1961 under the title Horror Hotel.  Legacy  Heavy metal band Iron Maiden use scenes from this film in the music video for their song \\"Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter\\". King Diamond also uses clips in his \\"Sleepless Nights\\" video as do punk band UFX in the video to \\"Bitch\\", while Rob Zombie used Christopher Lee's opening words to similarly preface his track \\"Dragula\\" from Hellbilly Deluxe. In addition, the punk band Misfits wrote a song called \\"Horror Hotel\\" (the American release title).

The etymology of the scientific name (prioo-, to bite + akantha, thorn) refers to the family's very rough, spined scales. The common name of \\"bigeye\\" refers to the member species' unusually large eyes, suited to their carnivorous and nocturnal lifestyles. Priacanthidae are typically colored bright red, but some have patterns in silver, dusky brown, or black. Most species reach a maximum total length of about , although in a few species lengths of over are known. Most members of this family are native to tropical and subtropical parts of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, but four species (Cookeolus japonicus, Heteropriacanthus cruentatus, Priacanthus arenatus, and Pristigenys alta) are found in the Atlantic. They tend to live near rock outcroppings or reefs, although a few are known to inhabit open waters. Many species are found in relatively deep waters, below depths reachable by normal scuba diving. Some species are fished for food. The earliest identified Priacanthidae fossils date to the middle Eocene epoch of the lower Tertiary period, or roughly 40 to 50 million years ago.

The production was directed by Marc Connelly, used set designs by Donald Oenslager, and starred Henry Fonda as Dan Harrow and June Walker as Molly Larkins.

Dan Harrow (Henry Fonda) works along the Erie Canal during the mid-19th century to raise money to buy a farm. While working, he meets Molly Larkins, a beautiful canal boat cook (Janet Gaynor). Although Harrow wants to marry Larkins, she's apprehensive about leaving the exciting canal life for one of a farmer's wife. A 1953 musical remake used a score by Harold Arlen and Cyril J. Mockridge.

It was written by Ralph Brown and directed by Suri Krishnamma. The film follows two teenagers, Jake (Potts) and Steve (Barry) as they cope with life after being the sole survivors of an avalanche. Their teacher also survives the accident, but remains comatose and dies soon after the start of the film. The two boys make a suicide pact agreeing that on the one-year anniversary of the avalanche, they will kill themselves. The two spend their last year living life to the fullest. This takes the form of a list of \\"tasks\\", which they both must fulfill before dying. The movie's screenplay is written by Brown, and deals with themes such as the generation gap, the conflicts that surround today's youngsters, suicide, crossing boundaries and how people are affected by tragedy. Brown has spoken of New Year's Day being prompted by the murder of James Bulger, in the sense of a storyline concerning two young people who are surrounded by grown- ups who have no idea about what they are doing. New Year's Day won best film at the Raindance Film Festival 2001, and best film at the Sapporo Film Festival 2001. In February 2001, it also took the Grand Prize in the 12th Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival which was attended by director Suri Krishnamma. The film contains a cover of the Tim Hardin song \\"Reason to Believe\\" by Paul Weller, recorded specially for the movie.

Gameplay  In Big Bird's Egg Catch, the player controls Big Bird of Sesame Street fame as he saves eggs produced by chickens at the top of the screen. These eggs travel down variously contorted chutes to land safely in the basket perched on Big Bird's head. Most eggs count for a single point, but a golden egg will periodically appear that is worth five points. When an egg is dropped, a number of points are lost. At higher levels, the eggs move faster, the chutes become more convoluted, there are more egg-laying hens, and the chutes may even flash invisible. \\"Turkey in the Straw\\", the song that plays during the egg-catching, also increases in tempo. Periodically, Big Bird will exit the screen to count his eggs. During this stage, Big Bird is seen with his basket and numbers flash on the screen progressively faster as he counts. When the total is reached, a song is played and Big Bird dances. The game ends when too many eggs are dropped or a set number of counting sessions is performed. Big Bird's Egg Catch bears many similarities to other games of the time, such as Kaboom!. What sets it apart is that this game does not use a paddle controller common to games with similar gameplay. Big Bird's Egg Catch used an Atari Kid's Controller (sold separately), although the regular keyboard controller would also work. Reception Suzan D.

He is the National Director of Priests for Life (PFL) and serves as the Chairman and Pastoral Director of its project Rachel's Vineyard. He also is the President of the National Pro-Life Religious Council, an umbrella group of various anti-abortion Christian denominations, and serves as Pastoral Director of the Silent No More campaign.  Early life  Pavone was born in 1959 in Port Chester, New York to Marion and Joseph Pavone. His father was a hardware salesman. Pavone aspired to be an astronaut as a child but decided to become a priest after volunteering at his parish, and after attending the 1976 March for Life, decided to devote his life to the anti-abortion cause. After graduating as valedictorian of his high school class, he enrolled in the Don Bosco College, a Salesian Major Seminary in Newton, New Jersey, later leaving the Salesian Order and joining the Archdiocese of New York.  Priesthood  In 2001 Pavone announced a $12 million advertising campaign designed to welcome women who'd had abortions back into the church. However, the National Council of Catholic Bishops stated that this would be coordinated with post-abortion counseling services already provided by many dioceses. Frances Kissling, president of Catholics for a Free Choice, said \\"There is an existing ministry designed to reconcile women with the church.\\".

In March 2005 the Catholic Diocese of Amarillo announced that Pavone, would establish a religious community, called Missionaries of the Gospel of Life, for priests and seminarians exclusively dedicated to anti-abortion work.

Pavone was threatened with death by Theodore Shulman, an abortion rights advocate. Shulman indicated Pavone would be killed if Scott Roeder, the murderer of Wichita abortion provider George Tiller, was acquitted. Commenting on the threat, Pavone said, \\"I have already publicly forgiven Mr. Shulman and pray for him every day\\". = Joseph Maraachli case = In 2011, Pavone was involved in assisting the family of Moe Maraachli, a Canadian man who, with his wife, sought medical procedure for their dying son, who came to be known as \\"Baby Joseph\\", but were refused the treatment in Canada. They turned to Pavone for assistance, and he arranged, through his Priests for Life organization, to have the baby transferred to SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center in St. Louis where the child received a tracheotomy, and then to have him flown back home, breathing on his own without a machine. After successfully receiving the procedure in March 2011, \\"Baby Joseph\\" Maraachli did return home, where he died in September 2011. =Kermit Gosnell= In 2013, Pavone presided over a service to give names to the 45 babies whose bodies were found in Kermit Gosnell's abortion clinic. During the service, Pavone asked, \\"Who are these children, and whose are these children? Are they medical waste or are they our brothers and sisters?\\" The service also called for prayers and healing for the parents of the aborted babies. Pavone contacted the Philadelphia Medical Examiner to request permission to bury the \\"Gosnell babies\\". The request was not granted. = Political activity = In September 2004, Pavone addressed a group of delegates to the Republican National Convention in New York, saying, \\"Isn't it great to be among Catholics who aren't afraid to be political? And isn't it great to find a few priests who aren't afraid to be political?\\"Feurherd, Joe. \\"Battling the 'heretics' at the Republican National Convention: former Corpus Christi bishop prays for Bush victory.\\" National Catholic Reporter. September 17, 2004. Pavone said that abortion was the \\"single issue\\" for him in the election of 2004, and indicated the politics of abortion was the reason he endorsed George W. Bush. Pavone has made statements comparing supporting the legality of abortion to supporting terrorism. Pavone said \\"abortion is no less violent than terrorism\\". When 2008 presidential candidate John McCain chose Sarah Palin as his running mate, Pavone said he believed that Palin was a better Catholic than Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden, due to her opposition to abortion, even though Palin was raised a Protestant in the Assemblies of God church. In January 2010, Pavone commented on the special election victory of Republican Scott Brown to fill the late Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy's U.S. Senate seat. Although Brown has a moderate stance on abortion, supporting certain restrictions, while still supporting its legality, Pavone considered his victory as an example that \\"elections are the answer\\". In August 2012, after Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan invited President Barack Obama to the annual Al Smith Dinner, Pavone criticized the decision, saying it \\"amounts to scandal\\", due to Obama's support of legal abortion.Gibson, David. \\"Dolan criticized for inviting Obama to Al Smith Dinner\\", Religion News Service, Aug. 7, 2012 Controversies =PFL finances= In 2011 PFL came under scrutiny for failing to disclose financial details reporting a $1.4 million deficit in 2010 despite collecting tens of millions of dollars in donations during recent years. On September 6, 2011, Pavone was ordered back to his diocese by his bishop, Patrick Zurek of the Diocese of Amarillo, Texas. Zurek limited Pavone to duties within the Diocese of Amarillo because of a protracted disagreement over financial transparency for Pavone's nonprofit Priests for Life and its affiliates — Rachel's Vineyard, which counsels people affected by abortion, and Gospel of Life Ministries, a lay association affiliated with Priests for Life. Pavone remained a priest in good standing, and the bishop did not allege fiscal impropriety,Welch, Karen Smith. \\"Bishop: Pavone's mission not in question\\", Amarillo Globe-News, October 5, 2011 In addition to suspending Pavone from ministry outside Amarillo, Bishop Zurek prohibited the priest from appearing on the Eternal Word Television Network.

While working in Turin, where the population suffered many of the ill-effects of industrialization and urbanization, he dedicated his life to the betterment and education of street children, juvenile delinquents, and other disadvantaged youth. He developed teaching methods based on love rather than punishment, a method that became known as the Salesian Preventive System. A follower of the spirituality and philosophy of Francis de Sales, Bosco was an ardent devotee of Mary, mother of Jesus, under the title Mary Help of Christians. He later dedicated his works to De Sales when he founded the Salesians of Don Bosco, based in Turin. Together with Maria Domenica Mazzarello, he founded the Institute of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians, a religious congregation of nuns dedicated to the care and education of poor girls. He taught Dominic Savio, of whom he wrote a biography that helped the young boy be canonized. On 18 April 1869, one year after the construction of the Basilica of Mary Help of Christians in Turin, Don Bosco established the Association of Mary Help of Christians (ADMA) connecting it with commitments easily fulfilled by most common people, to the spirituality and the mission of the Salesian Congregation (CG 24 SDB, 1996, NR. 80). The ADMA was founded to promote the veneration of the Most Holy Sacrament and Mary Help of Christians (Don Bosco, Association of the Devotees of Mary Help of Christians, San Benigno can. 1890, page 33). In 1876 Bosco founded a movement of laity, the Association of Salesian Cooperators, with the same educational mission to the poor. In 1875, he began to publish the Salesian Bulletin. The Bulletin has remained in continuous publication, and is currently published in 50 different editions and 30 languages. Bosco established a network of organizations and centers to carry on his work. Following his beatification in 1929, he was canonized as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church by Pope Pius XI in 1934. Life John Bosco was born in the evening of 16 August 1815 in the hillside hamlet of Becchi, Italy. He was the youngest son of Francesco Bosco (1784–1817) and Margherita Occhiena. He had two older brothers, Antonio, and Giuseppe (1813–1862). The Boscos of Becchi were farmhands of the Moglian Family. John Bosco was born into a time of great shortage and famine in the Piedmontese countryside, following the devastation wrought by the Napoleonic wars and drought in 1817.The Piedmont drought lasted from 1817 to 1819. See The Majesty of Charleston by Peter Beney, p.64, 2005 edition. When he was little more than two years old his father Francesco died, leaving the support of three boys to his mother, Margherita. She played a strong role in Bosco's formation and personality, and was an early supporter of her son's ideals. In 1825, when he was nine, Bosco had the first of a series of dreams which would play an influential role in his outlook and work. This first dream \\"left a profound impression on him for the rest of his life\\", according to his own memoirs. Bosco apparently saw a multitude of very poor boys who play and blaspheme, and a man, who \\"appeared, nobly attired, with a manly and imposing bearing\\". The man said to him: \\"You will have to win these friends of yours not with blows, but with gentleness and kindness. So begin right now to show them that sin is ugly and virtue beautiful.\\" John Bosco, when he was ten years old at the festive oratory, started watching his classmates attitudes and in every fight he was the referee. The older boys were scared of him because John Bosco knew their strengths and their weaknesses. When traveling entertainers performed at a local feast in the nearby hills, John watched and studied the jugglers' tricks and the acrobats' secrets. Then he would put on shows of his skills as a juggler, magician and acrobat with prayers before and after the performance. The money he needed to prepare all the shows was taken from selling the birds he hunted and money his mother gave him because she trusted him. Poverty prevented any serious attempt at schooling. John's early years were spent as a shepherd, and he received his first instruction from a parish priest. His childhood experiences are thought to have inspired him to become a priest. At the time, being a priest was generally seen as a profession for the privileged classes, rather than farmers, although it was not unknown. Some biographers portray his older brother Antonio as the main obstacle for Bosco's ambition to study, as the brother protested that John was just \\"a farmer like us!\\" On a cold morning in February 1827, John left his home and went to look for work as a farm-servant. At 12, he found life at home unbearable because of the continuous quarrels with Antonio. Having to face life by himself at such a young age may have developed his later sympathies to help abandoned boys. After begging unsuccessfully for work, Bosco ended up at the wine farm of Louis Moglia. Although Bosco could pursue some studies by himself, he was not able to attend school for two more years. In 1830 he met Joseph Cafasso, a young priest who identified some natural talent and supported his first schooling. In 1835 Bosco entered the seminary at Chieri, next to the Church of the Immacolata Concezione.Now hosts an exhibition dedicated to the John Bosco. In 1841, after six years of study, he was ordained a priest on the eve of Trinity Sunday by Archbishop Franzoni of Turin. =Priesthood and first apostolates= Don Bosco John Bosco was first called to be chaplain of the Rifugio (\\"Refuge\\"), a girls' boarding school founded in Turin by the Marchioness Giulia di Barolo. His other ministries included visiting prisoners, teaching catechism, and helping out at many country parishes. =Adulthood= At that time, the city of Turin had a population of 117,000 inhabitants. It reflected the effects of industrialization and urbanization: numerous poor families lived in the slums of the city, having come from the countryside in search of a better life. In visiting the prisons, Don Bosco was disturbed to see so many boys from 12 to 18 years of age. He was determined to find a means to prevent them from ending up here. Because of population growth and migration to the city, Bosco found the traditional methods of parish ministry inefficient. He decided it was necessary to try another form of apostolate, and he began to meet the boys where they worked and gathered in shops and marketplaces. They were pavers, stone-cutters, masons, plasterers who came from far away places, he recalled in his brief Memoires. The Oratorio was not simply a charitable institution, and its activities were not limited to Sundays. For Don Bosco, it became his permanent occupation. He looked for jobs for the unemployed. Some of the boys did not have sleeping quarters and slept under bridges or in bleak public dormitories. Twice he tried to provide lodgings in his house. The first time they stole the blankets; the second they emptied the hay-loft. He did not give up. In May 1847, he gave shelter to a young boy from Valencia, in one of the three rooms he was renting in the slums of Valdocco, where he was living with his mother. He and \\"Mamma Margherita\\" began taking in orphans. The boys sheltered by Don Bosco numbered 36 in 1852, 115 in 1854, 470 in 1860 and 600 in 1861, 800 is the maximum sometime later. Bosco and his oratory moved around town for a number of years; he was turned out of several places in succession. After only two months based in the church of St. Martin, the entire neighborhood expressed its annoyance with the noise coming from the boys at play. A formal complaint was lodged against them with the municipality. Rumors also circulated that the meetings conducted by the priest with his boys were dangerous; their recreation could be turned into a revolution against the government. The group was evicted. =Work with apprentices= In the archives of the Salesian Congregation is a contract of apprenticeship, dated November 1851; another one on stamped paper costing 40 cents, dated February 8, 1852; and others with later dates. These are among the first contracts of apprenticeship to be found in Turin. All of them are signed by the employer, the apprentice, and Don Bosco. In those contracts, Don Bosco touched on many sensitive issues. Some employers customarily made servants and scullery-boys of the apprentices. Don Bosco obliged them to agree to employ the boys only in their acknowledged trade. Employers used to beat the boys. Don Bosco required them to agree that corrections be made only verbally. He cared for their health, and demanded that they are given rest on feast days and that they are given an annual holiday. But in spite of all the efforts and contracts, the situation of the apprentices of the time remained difficult. One influential friend was the Piedmontese Justice Minister Urbano Rattazzi. He was anticlerical in his politics, but he saw some value in Bosco’s work. While Rattazzi was pushing a bill through the Sardinian legislature to suppress religious orders, he advised Bosco on how to get around the law. He found a religious order to keep the oratory going after its founder’s death. Bosco had been thinking about that problem, too, and had been slowly organizing his helpers into a loose \\"Congregation of St. Francis de Sales\\". He was also training select older boys for the priesthood. Another supporter of the idea to establish a religious order to carry out Bosco's vision was the reigning pope, Pope Pius IX. Bosco disliked the ideals that had been exported by revolutionary France, calling Rousseau and Voltaire \\"two vicious leaders of incredulity.\\" He favoured an ultramontane view of politics that acknowledged the supreme authority of the pope. In 1854, when the Kingdom of Sardinia was about to pass a law suppressing monastic orders and confiscating ecclesiastical properties, Bosco reported a series of dreams about \\"great funerals at court\\", referring to politicians or members of the Savoy court. In November 1854, he sent a letter to King Victor Emmanuel II, admonishing him to oppose the confiscation of church property and suppression of the orders, but the King failed to respond. His actions, which had been described by Italian historian Erberto Petoia as having \\"manifest blackmailing intentions\\", ended only after the intervention of Prime Minister Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour. The king's family suffered a number of deaths in a short period. From January to May 1855, the king's mother (age 54), wife (32), newborn son (Vittorio Emanuele, Count of Genoa; nearly four months old), and his only brother (32) all died. Opposition to Bosco and his work came from various quarters. Traditionalist clergy accused him of stealing the young and old people away from their own parishes. Nationalist politicians (including some clergy) saw his several hundred young men as a recruiting ground for revolution. The Marquis de Cavour, chief of police in Turin, regarded the open-air catechisms as overtly political and a threat to the State, and was highly suspicious of Bosco's support for the powers of the papacy. Bosco was interrogated on several occasions, but no charges made. Closure may have been prevented by orders from the king that Bosco was not to be disturbed. Several attempts were also made on Bosco's life, including a near-stabbing, bludgeoning and a shooting. Early biographers put this down to the growing influence of the Waldensians in opposition to Catholic clergy. =Foundation of the Salesians of Don Bosco= Basilica Don Bosco in Castelnuovo Don Bosco, Asti St. John Bosco Parish Church, Makati, Philippines Statue of Saint John Bosco, Ronda, Spain Statue of Saint John Bosco, Makati City, Philippines Statue of Saint John Bosco at the Diocesan Shrine of Mary Help of Christians, Canlubang, Calamba City, Philippines Some of the boys helped by Don Bosco decided to do what he was doing, that is, to work in the service of abandoned boys. And this was the origin of the Salesian Congregation. Among the first members were Michael Rua, John Cagliero (who later became a Cardinal), and John Baptist Francesia. In 1859, Bosco selected the experienced priest Vittorio Alasonatti, 15 seminarians and one high school boy and formed them into the \\"Society of St. Francis de Sales.\\" This was the nucleus of the Salesians, the religious order that would carry on his work. When the group had their next meeting, they voted on the admission of Joseph Rossi as a lay member, the first Salesian brother. The Salesian Congregation was divided into priests, seminarians and \\"coadjutors\\" (the lay brothers). Next, he worked with estarino, Mary Mazzarello and a group of girls in the hill town of Mornese. In 1871, he founded a group of religious sisters to do for girls what the Salesians were doing for boys. They were called the \\"Daughters of Mary Help of Christians.\\" In 1874, he founded yet another group, the \\"Salesian Cooperators.\\" These were mostly lay people who would work for young people like the Daughters and the Salesians, but would not join a religious order. The first Salesians departed for Argentina in 1875. After his ordination, Bosco himself would have become a missionary had not his director, Joseph Cafasso, opposed the idea. He nevertheless eagerly read the Italian edition of the Annals of the Propagation of the Faith and used this magazine to illustrate his Cattolico Provveduto (1853) and his Month of May booklets (1858). When Bosco founded the Salesian Society, the thought of the missions still obsessed him, though he completely lacked the financial means at that time. Bosco claimed he had another dream where he was on a vast plain, inhabited by primitive peoples, who spent their time hunting or fighting among themselves or against soldiers in European uniforms. Along came a band of missionaries, but they were all massacred. A second group appeared, which Bosco at once recognized as Salesians. Astonished, he witnessed an unexpected change when the fierce savages laid down their arms and listened to the missionaries. It seems the dream made a great impression on Bosco, because he tried hard to identify the men and the country of the dream – and for three years collected information about different countries. A request from Argentina, turned him towards the Indians of Patagonia, and a study of the people there convinced him that the country and its inhabitants were the ones he had seen in his dream. Towards the end of 1874, John Bosco received letters from the Argentine consult at Savona requesting that he accept an Italian parish in Buenos Aires and a school for boys at San Nicolas de los Arroyos. Bosco regarded it as a sign of providence and started to prepare a mission. Adopting a way of evangelization that would not expose his missionaries to wild, \\"uncivilized\\" tribes, he proposed setting up bases in safe locations which missionary efforts were to be launched. Negotiations started after Archbishop Aneiros of Buenos Aires had indicated that he would be glad to receive the Salesians. In a ceremony held on 29 January 1875, Bosco was able to convey the great news to the oratory. On 5 February he announced the fact in a circular letter to all Salesians asking volunteers to apply in writing. He proposed that the first missionary departure start in October. There were many volunteers. =Salesian Preventive System and other Works= In the years Don Bosco had spent running his oratory and giving spiritual and practical instruction to the boys he had housed there, he relied on a different approach on education and general instruction which he believed to be superior to traditional educational methods which he labelled as a Repressive System of Education. On March 12, 1877, Bosco gave an opening address on the subject- matter of the systems of education during the day for the opening of the St. Peter's Youth Center in the new quarters of the Patronage de Saint Pierre in Nice, in which he first mentions the term 'Preventive System'. Upon his return to Turin, don Bosco wrote down the address as a polished essay under the title The Preventive System in the Education of the Youth which was published in 1877, which he included in the initial draft of the Rule for the Salesian Order. It espoused the values of reason, Religion, and loving kindness with a goal of producing 'good Christians and honest citizens'. This was the only attempt Don Bosco had at a systematic exposition of his educational system. Though the idea itself was not innovative by any means, Bosco having drawn the inspiration for his system through the contemporary criticisms of the punitive and outdated educational systems prevalent in Europe during his time, he was one of the first to combat and put these criticisms into practice. Though Don Bosco's written works were little known outside of his own Order and the subscribers of his Salesian Bulletin, which he founded on August 1877, he wrote frequently and voluminously. Though Don Bosco was described as more of a man of action than a scholar, he was an exceptional historian. He penned the 1881 \\"A Compendium of Italian History from the Fall of the Roman Empire\\" which was translated and continued to the present time by John Daniel Morell, and was noted by scholars for its cultural importance on the knowledge base of ancient to modern civilization. He was also a skilled biographer. His two most well-known biographies were on his mentor Joseph CafassoUnder Cafasso, Bosco himself would later become a priest when he started this work. It has since spread worldwide through the religious congregation that he founded: the Salesians of Don Bosco. He has also been declared a saint and their hometown has been renamed in his honor. and one of his student, Dominic Savio, which would later be instrumental in his canonization.

His funeral was attended by thousands. Soon after there was popular demand to have him canonized. The Archdiocese of Turin investigated and witnesses were called to determine if Bosco was worthy to be declared a saint. The Salesians, Daughters and Cooperators gave supportive testimonies. But many remembered Bosco's controversies in the 1870s with Archbishop Gastaldi and some others high in the Church hierarchy thought him a loose cannon and a \\"wheeler-dealer\\". In the canonization process, testimony was heard about how he went around Gastaldi to get some of his men ordained and about their lack of academic preparation and ecclesiastical decorum. Political cartoons from the 1860s and later showed him shaking money from the pockets of old ladies or going off to America for the same purpose. These cartoons were not forgotten. Opponents of Bosco, including some cardinals, were in a position to block his canonization. Pope Pius XI had known Bosco and pushed the cause forward. Pius XI beatified Bosco on June 2, 1929 and canonized him on Easter Sunday (April 1) of 1934, when he was given the title of \\"Father and Teacher of Youth\\". While Bosco had been popularly known as the patron saint of illusionists, on 30 January 2002, Silvio Mantelli petitioned Pope John Paul II to formally declare Bosco the patron of stage magicians. Catholic stage magicians who practice gospel magic venerate Bosco by offering free magic shows to underprivileged children on his feast day. Bosco's work was carried on by his early pupil, collaborator and companion, Michael Rua, who was appointed rector major of the Salesian Society by Pope Leo XIII in 1888. = In popular culture = Bosco was the subject of the 1935 biopic Don Bosco directed by Goffredo Alessandrini. He was played by the actor Gian Paolo Rosmino. Bosco was also the subject of a 2004 Italian movie, Saint John Bosco: Mission to Love. The Italian church St. Giovanni Bosco is named after Bosco. The church is located in Montreal, Canada, in the borough of Ville-Emard. St. Giovanni Bosco is the patron saint of the capital of Brazil, Brasília, which he supposedly foresaw in a prophecy concerning an extraordinary new civilization which would flourish in Central Brazil. A borough in Quilmes, Argentina, is also named after him.

The championship was mostly concentrated in Europe, but throughout the years has visited other continents including Asia and South America. At the end of 2009, the championship was replaced by the FIA GT1 World Championship, which morphed into the FIA GT Series for 2013.  Regulations  FIA currently defines several categories of GT cars with the top two specifications being GT1, or Grand Touring Cars, and GT2, or Series Grand Touring Cars. Each category has an annual driver champion, team champion, and manufacturer champion. Both categories are based on production road car designs, which must be produced in a minimum quantity of 25 examples to qualify. Both types may undergo significant modifications from the road car they are based on, but GT1 allows the use of exotic materials, better aerodynamics, larger brakes, wider tyres and larger engine admission restrictors. For the 2006 season, the FIA created a new class called GT3. GT3 cars are even closer to their production counterparts and are very simply racetrack prepared with the essentials (rollcages for safety, stripped interiors, race spec fuel tanks, etc.). All cars are performance balanced together via different weights, restrictors, tyre pressures etc. Prestigious motorsports makes such as Aston Martin, Chevrolet, Dodge, Lamborghini, Ascari and Maserati take part in FIA GT3 European Championship, a support series in some rounds of the main championship. The FIA defines a GT car as \\"an open or closed automobile which has no more than one door on each side and a minimum of two seats situated one on each side of the longitudinal centre line of the car; these two seats must be crossed by the same transversal plane. This car must be able to be used perfectly legally on the open road, and adapted for racing on circuits or closed courses.\\" All races in the FIA GT Championship were of endurance type, a full race distance lasting a minimum of 500 km or a maximum of three hours, with the exception of the Spa 24 Hours, Istanbul 2 hours and the exhibition Mil Milhas Brasileiras, which is run over a thousand miles (1609 km) and was planned to be a round of the championship in 2007. However, with the release of the 2007 FIA GT Championship schedule and rules, the FIA GT series becomes more of a sprint race event, with all races being a maximum of 2 hours with the exception of the Spa 24 Hours. History A Maserati MC12 competing against a Chevrolet Corvette C5-R In 1997, due to increasing interest from manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Panoz, the FIA took over control of the expanding BPR Global GT Series, standardizing the race-length at 500 km instead of the usual four hours, liberalizing the technical regulations and leaving commercial exploitation in the hands of one of BPR's founders, Stéphane Ratel, who managed to get TV support from the pan-European TV station Eurosport. The new manufacturers built \\"homologation specials\\", racing-bred cars that took full advantage of the new rules, to build quasi-prototypes with very limited production runs of 25 cars. Chrysler, Lister and Marcos, not wanting to accompany the cost escalation, moved down to the GT2 class. This proved to be the wisest move, as Mercedes completely dominated the new category and the other manufacturers pulled out after the end of the 1998 season. This left Chrysler's Viper to become the dominating car in the series, with the aging Porsche 993 GT2 and the Lister Storm providing a certain degree of competition. However, there was no lower inexpensive category for amateur drivers, and this led to the creation of the N-GT class in 2000. While the manufacturer field in the main class blossomed, the new category became swamped with Porsches and Ferraris, but lower running costs meant both classes enjoyed a balanced number of entries. In order to boost the championship's status, the SRO added the 24 Hours of Spa, previously a touring car race, to the calendar, where it became the series' most important race. The FIA also banned official manufacturer involvement, although certain teams had preferential treatment, with Porsche establishing a \\"round robin\\" system. After the end of the 2004 season, the FIA renamed the classes GT1 and GT2, and somewhat liberalized the GT1 regulations, allowing \\"supercars\\". While this was made to accommodate the Saleen S7, the biggest beneficiary was the purpose-built Maserati MC12, which led the FIA to impose aerodynamic limitations on the Italian car. However, thanks to a weight penalty system, the fight for the championship is protected from more domineering cars. The level of competition remains tight, with gentlemen drivers managing to fight for the wins with professional drivers, some of them with Formula One experience. Following the 2009 season, the SRO announced that the FIA GT Championship's two categories, GT1 and GT2, would break off into separate series. The GT1 category became a world championship with rounds across the world. Cars which fit the GT1 class were eligible to race only in the FIA GT1 World Championship, as the ACO (organizer of the Le Mans 24 Hours) banned the cars from the event and all of its associated series. This meant that the category that once was eligible to race not only in the FIA GT, Le Mans Series and numerous national championships, was now only able to run in the new World Championship. A few GT1 were entered in the LMGT1 class at the 2010 24 Hours of Le Mans. The GT1 cars continued to race in the World Championship in 2010 and 2011, but in 2012 the series switched exclusively to GT3 machinery due to shrinking car counts and the fact that most of the cars were ageing and no one was willing to build new models. This meant that the San Luis round of the 2011 season was the last ever time GT1 cars contested in international motorsport. The 2012 FIA GT1 season was contested with GT3 cars (yet retaining GT1 in series' title), but the series was finally cancelled after the year had concluded, being replaced by the FIA GT Series. In 2010 the GT2 class was planned to have a separate championship having rounds held only in Europe, known as the FIA GT2 European Championship, but this series was cancelled. A lone GT2 event was held in 2010 at the Spa 24 Hours with the winners being awarded the FIA GT2 European Cup. This was the last ever time GT2-spec cars contested in SRO-sanctioned series. A new Blancpain Endurance Series was announced for 2011 which re-established some of the endurance format of the former FIA GT Championship, although this series only utilised the FIA's GT3, GT4, and Supersports categories (GT2 was also planned to be in the series, but this was quickly folded as the interest level wasn't high). However, this series is not an FIA-sanctioned championship. In 2012 the series abandoned the GT4 class and moved to GT3 exclusively. Champions As of the end of the 2009 season, Vitaphone Racing Team have won their fifth consecutive Teams' Championship in the GT1 category, while AF Corse earned their fourth consecutive title. Michael Bartels and Andrea Bertolini, both driving for Vitaphone, earned their third Drivers' Championship titles in the past four seasons. Richard Westbrook of Prospeed Competition won the GT2 Drivers' Championship. Chris Niarchos won the Citation Cup while Ferrari won the returning Manufacturers' Championship for the GT2 category.

The National Preserve protects a remnant of the Bering Land Bridge that connected Asia with North America more than 13,000 years ago during the Pleistocene ice age. The majority of this land bridge now lies beneath the waters of the Chukchi and Bering Seas. During the glacial epoch this bridge was a migration route for people, animals, and plants whenever ocean levels fell enough to expose the land bridge. Archeologists disagree whether it was across this Bering Land Bridge, also called Beringia, that humans first migrated from Asia to populate the Americas, or whether it was via a coastal route. Bering Land Bridge National Monument was established in 1978 by Presidential proclamation under the authority of the Antiquities Act. The designation was modified in 1980 to a national preserve with the passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), which would allow both subsistence hunting by local residents and sport hunting. The preserve includes significant archaeological sites and a variety of geological features. The preserve has seen recent volcanic activity, with lava flows and lake-filled maars. Hot springs are a popular destination for tourists. Geography The preserve lies on the northern side of the Seward Peninsula, with . The preserve extends along the coast from a point to the west of Deering along Goodhope Bay to Cape Espenberg, then westward along the shore of the Chukchi Sea. The boundary moves inland to avoid the village of Shishmaref and the Shishmaref Inlet, then rejoins the coast to include Ikpek Lagoon. A narrow corridor connects the Ikpek Lagoon section to the main preserve. The interior portions extend to and across the Continental Divide as far as the Bendeleben Mountains. The region around the continental divide includes volcanic areas such as Serpentine Hot Springs and lava fields between the Noxapaga River and the Kuzitrin River. The preserve's high point is Mount Boyan on the south border. There are no roads into the preserve. Access to the preserve is by bush planes or boats during summer months and by ski planes, snowmobiles or dog sleds during the winter. Bering Land Bridge National Preserve contains several sites of geological and prehistorical significance. Serpentine Hot Springs is the preserve's most visited location. Other notable locations in the preserve include the Trail Creek Caves, Devil Mountain Lakes, and the Lost Jim Lava Flow.

The region was mostly untouched by glaciers during the ice age. The preserve lands can be described by five physiographic zones: the northern coastal plan, the rolling stream-dissected uplands, the Imuruk lava plateau, the Kuzitrin flats, and the Bendeleben Mountains. The Seward Peninsula is primarily composed of metamorphic blueschist, with deposits of sand, gravel, silt, loess and a few glacier-deposited moraines. The area around Cape Espenberg includes a series of relict beach ridges like those found farther north at Cape Krusenstern. These deposits are found mainly in the coastal plain, where they form a system of lagoons and barrier bars or spits. The rolling uplands lie inland and to the south of the coastal plain. The Serpentine Hot Springs and Trail Creek Caves are in this region of limestone, marble and other minerals. The tors and bunkhouse at Serpentine Hot Springs Volcanic activity in the interior has left areas of basalt on the Imuruk lava plateau. The volcanic activity has been recent -- the Lost Jim lava flow is estimated to be only 1,000 to 2,000 years old, produced from around 75 vents. The largest vent is the Lost Jim Cone, about high. One remnant of volcanism is the presence of hot springs. The Serpentine Hot Springs produce water at a temperature of to , and have been used for millennia by local people. Granite tors are another volcanic remnant, formed underground and exposed by erosion. Bering Land Bridge has the four largest and northernmost maar lakes in the world at Espenberg, formed by phreatomagmatic eruptions leaving round craters. The ages of the lakes range from 100,000-200,000 years at Whitefish Maar, to 50,000 years at North Killeak Maar, 40,000 years at South Killeak Maar, and 17,500 years at Devil Mountain Maar. The action of ice and permafrost produces features such as polygonal ice wedges and pingos. =Serpentine Hot Springs= Serpentine Hot Springs, previously known as Arctic Hot Springs,Waring, Gerald A. (1917). Mineral Springs of Alaska, U.S. Geological Survey, Water-Supply Paper 418. Washington: United States Government Printing Office. is located in the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve.http://www.nps.gov/akso/management/iyat-public-meetings.cfm (Accessed 12/14/2014). The springs are also referred to as Iyat, the Inupiaq word for cooking pot. Serpentine Hot Springs is on the northern part of the Seward Peninsula at 65°51′N, 164°43′W. The springs are situated on the right bank of Hot Springs Creek which flows to the Serpentine River, 47 miles NW of Imuruk Lake.Orth, Donald J. (1967).

Collier in U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin (1902).Collier, A.J. (1902). A Reconnaissance of the Northwestern Portion of the Seward Peninsula, Alaska. U.S. Geological Survey. Collier noted that Charles McLennan, who with a dog team and Inupiat assistants, was probably the first white man to reach the hot springs in May, 1900. McLennan may have staked a mining claim nearby but left the country by September, 1901. Another miner, John Sirene, built a cabin and maintained a garden at the springs. Miners used the area intermittently until around 1915, when prospectors built a cabin, bathhouse, and a bathing pool that was 10 to 12 feet in diameter nearby. A runway may have been constructed in 1923 and a bunkhouse was dragged in by Alaska Road Commission workers in 1949. In 1953, the nearby village of Shishmaref received $53,000 in state funds to construct a public bath house. It is possible that the springs were used traditionally by Inupiat residents for cooking, for healing and spiritual purposes. Anthropologists who studied the Inupiat in the area reported local beliefs that the healing influences at the hot springs site was very strong.Hild, Carl M. (2007) Engaging Inupiaq Values in Land Management for Health Through an Action Research Appreciative Inquiry Process. Ph.D. dissertation: Saybrook Graduate School and Research Center, San Francisco. Ecology Most of the land in the preserve is tundra, underlain by permafrost. The tundra supports a variety of low and slow-growing plants. The landscape is dominated by grasses and sedges, such as cottongrass. Large trees cannot survive on the tundra. Tree species are limited to dwarf species like Arctic willow, Alaska willow and dwarf birch. Berry-bearing plants in the preserve include bog blueberry, crowberry, low-bush cranberry and cloudberry or salmonberry. Lichens are found in rocky areas, including Cetraria, Cladina, Cladonia, Xanthoria and Umbilicaria genera. Mosses and liverworts in the preserve include Sphagnum peat mosses, Aulacomnium bog mosses, Dicranum forked mosses, Polytrichum haircap mosses and Rhizomnium. In spring the preserve features a variety of wildflowers, including Alpine Arnica, fireweed, Kamchatka rhododendron, Labrador tea, monkshood, one- flowered cinquefoil, harebell and alpine forget-me-not.

The muskoxen were reintroduced to the area in 1970, after being wiped out in the early 20th century. In addition to the native caribou, Siberian tundra reindeer (Rangifer tarandus sibiricus) were introduced in 1894, reaching a peak population of 600,000 animals in the 1930s. The herd has since been reduced to about 4,000. The Reindeer Act of 1937 prohibited ownership by non-Native Americans, and the reduced herds were managed by natives from that time onward. Other mammals in the preserve are walruses, polar bears, red foxes, brown bears, Arctic foxes, ribbon seals, wolverines and beavers. Significant nesting bird species include sandhill cranes and yellow-billed loons.https://www.nps.gov/bela/learn/nature/animals.htm File:Muskox Family.jpgMuskox family File:Caribou (16272522662).jpgCaribou File:Arctic Tern (8028148944).jpg Arctic Tern File:Red Fox (3682444110).jpg Red Fox File:Moose (9514270204).jpg Moose File:Willow Ptarmigan- George C.

When the tidal surge reached the herd, it broke the ice underneath it and the herd plunged into the icy water. The temperature was below –30 °C, and the whole herd was killed and frozen in the ice. Four of the animals had been fitted with radio collars, and they were found by researchers looking for their signals.Nature's Weirdest Events, part 2. BBC Earth, 2011. Presented in Finland by YLE TV 1, 28 May 2013. In addition to their reintroduction to this national preserve, the remaining population of muskoxen are currently in Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preservehttps://www.nps.gov/gaar/learn/nature/muskox.htm as well as a local farm in Palmer which has been existing since the mid-1950s.https://www.muskoxfarm.org History Cape Espenberg from the air The Seward Peninsula, as part of Beringia, was a path for the migration of Asian peoples into the Americas. The earliest artifacts found in the area are modified animal bones dating to about 13,000 BC. These are not considered definitive, and the earliest undisputed evidence of human occupation are relics of the PaleoArctic tradition found in the Trail Creek Caves and dating to between 10,000 and 7,000 BC. Archaeological evidence suggests a gap in human occupation on the peninsula until about 4200 BC. Materials from the period 4000 to about 2000 BC, known as the Denbigh culture of the Arctic small tool tradition, have been found at Cape Espenberg, the Trail Creek Caves, Kuzitrin Lake and Agulaak Island. The Denbigh culture was followed by the Choris culture, which brought pottery and ground stone tools. Cape Espenberg, the Trail Creek Caves and the region around Lopp Lagoon were occupied during this time. This was followed by the Ipuitak culture from about 1900 BC to 1000 BC, at many of the same locations. The Northern Maritime tradition followed, comprising the Birnirk, Western Thule and Kotzebue Period cultures. This series of cultures spanned the period from 600 AD to the early 1800s, when traditional lifestyles were disrupted by the arrival of Europeans in the area. The fur trade, whaling and missionary activities changed the local economy, which was further altered in the late 19th century by the arrival of prospectors looking for gold on the southern side of the Seward Peninsula. Prospectors spread out across the peninsula, with hydraulic mining undertaken in the Pinnel River in the preserve. The Seward Peninsula saw a further influx of outsiders during World War II, since Alaska was an important theater of the Pacific war. Map of the preserve on the Seward Peninsula =Administration and designations= Bering Land Bridge National Monument was established December 1, 1978, by President Jimmy Carter using his authority under the Antiquities Act. Carter took the action after the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) was held up in Congress. In 1980 ANILCA was passed, and was signed into law by Carter on December 2, 1980, converting the monument into a national preserve. The preserve's headquarters are in the Sitnasuak Building in Nome.

The Big Cypress, along with Big Thicket National Preserve in Texas, became the first national preserves in the United States National Park System when they were established on October 11, 1974. In 2008, Florida film producer Elam Stoltzfus featured the preserve in a PBS documentary. Geography and history of establishment Big Cypress borders the wet freshwater marl prairies of Everglades National Park to the south, and other state and federally protected cypress country in the west, with water from the Big Cypress flowing south and west into the coastal Ten Thousand Islands region of Everglades National Park. When Everglades National Park was established in 1947, Big Cypress was originally intended to be included; however, because the land had not been purchased from its private owners, Big Cypress was ultimately released from the park system. Climate Big Cypress has a tropical savannah climate (Aw according to Köppen climate classification), bordering on tropical monsoon climate (Am). Days are some of the hottest in Florida. January has an average high of and August has an average high of , while Miami averages , respectively. However, nights cool down into the 50s °F (low 10s °C) in winter. Means range from in January to in August. Highs exceed on 159 days per year, while they fall below on just 10. Hardiness zone is 10A, with an average annual minimum of . The lowest recorded daily high was in 2010, while the highest low on record was in 2005. Human use and impact Archaeology at Platt Island in the preserve shows humans settled there more than two thousand years ago. The Calusa people had an extensive presence in the area when Europeans arrived. Big Cypress was historically occupied by various cultures of Native Americans; the last were the Seminole of the nineteenth century. Their descendants include the federally recognized Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of Florida. Early European-American settlers hunted herons and egrets, whose feathers were popular with 19th and 20th century hat-makers in New York and Paris. Poachers hunted American alligators and crocodiles to near extinction. When the timber industry began to operate in the area, it built railroads, and cut and hauled out most of the cypress ecosystem's old growth trees. Portions of the Big Cypress, which is slightly more elevated than the western Everglades, were farmed for winter vegetables. The search for oil in Florida began in 1901 with no success. After almost 80 more dry holes had been drilled throughout the state, on September 26, 1943, Humble Oil Company (later to become Exxon) discovered Florida's first producing oil well in the northwest portion of what is now Big Cypress National Preserve. Big Cypress National Preserve differs from Everglades National Park in that, when it was established by law in 1974, the Miccosukee, Seminole and Traditional people were provided with permanent rights to occupy and use the land in traditional ways; in addition, they have first rights to develop income-producing businesses related to the resources and use of the preserve, such as guided tours.National Park Service, James A. Goss, Usual and Customary Use by the Miccosukee and Seminole Indians in Big Cypress National Preserve, Florida, National Park Service, 1995, pp. 4-5 They and other hunters may use off-road vehicles, and home and business owners have been permitted to keep their properties in the preserve. As in Everglades National Park, petroleum exploration was permitted within Big Cypress in the authorizing legislation, but plans are under way for the government to buy out the remaining petroleum leases in order to shut down non-governmental commercial access to the environment. In the 1960s, Native Americans, hunters, and conservationists succeeded at fighting an effort to move Miami International Airport's international flights to a new airport in the Big Cypress area. They followed up with a campaign to have Big Cypress included in the National Parks System. Although construction of the new airport had already begun, it was stopped after one runway was completed. It is now known as the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport. Flora and fauna A cottonmouth crosses an off-road vehicle access road in Big Cypress National Preserve. The preserve is highly diverse biologically. It is dominated by a wet cypress forest, but while \\"few giant cypress remain...one third of the swamp is covered with dwarf pond cypress.\\" It is host to an array of flora and fauna, including mangroves, orchids, alligators, crocodiles, venomous snakes like the cottonmouth and eastern diamondback rattlesnake, a variety of birds, river otter, deer, bobcat, coyote, black bear and cougar. The preserve is also home to federally listed endangered species including, the eastern indigo snake, and the Florida sandhill crane. Tourism Alligator sunning below the boardwalk at the Oasis Visitor Center Twelve campgrounds in Big Cypress are tailored to motor vehicles, where tourists planning overnight stays can park their vehicles and off-road vehicles in designated areas. The southern terminus of the Florida National Scenic Trail is located in Big Cypress, and provides hiking opportunities during the winter months. Hiking throughout Big Cypress is enjoyable in all seasons, with most of the cypress country more hospitable to hikers than the dense sawgrass prairies of the central Everglades. Some of the most beautiful wading and walking can be found in cypress strands and prairies between the Loop Road and the Tamiami Trail. Wildlife is abundant in the preserve. Most notable and regularly seen, the American Alligators can be up to around 12 feet in length. Another notable and endangered animal, the Florida Panther calls the Preserve home. Though both generally relatively timid, wading through the cypress country requires constant alertness. Before going out, visit one of the preserve's visitor centers for information on the current conditions and local trails. The visitor centers offer an educational video about the surroundings, also viewable on the Big Cypress YouTube channel. Rangers often lead swamp walk hikes in the dry winter months, as well as canoe trips, and boardwalk talks. Hunting is a long-established recreational activity in the area and is protected in the designation of the area as a Preserve. Hunters were instrumental in protecting this corner of remote, wild Florida. Hunting activities continue today and include seasons for archery, muzzle loading and general gun. Typical game species are white-tailed deer, turkey and hogs. Alligator hunting is not allowed within the national preserve. Hunting within the preserve is managed cooperatively between the National Park Service and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Controversy over off- road vehicles Burns Lake campground, one of Big Cypress' many seasonal camps designed mainly for R.V.s and ORVs. Touted as a \\"recreational paradise\\" by the Department of the Interior, Big Cypress was created in part to accommodate access with off-road vehicles (ORVs) by the hunters and the Miccosukee and Seminole people who had worked to protect Big Cypress from drainage and development. However, scientists and conservationists have noted an increase in ORV recreation that prompted the National Park Service in 2001 to proactively manage ORV recreation and to reduce of primary trails within the preserve, despite persistent calls for more from hunters and ORV enthusiasts. According to a 2001 study conducted by the United States Geological Survey, > ORV use in Big Cypress National Preserve has impacted wildlife populations > and habitats through modifications to water flow patterns (direction and > velocity) and water quality, soil displacement and compaction, direct > vegetation damage, disturbance to foraging individuals, and, ultimately, > overall suitability of habitats for wildlife. Given these conclusions, environmental groups opposed the announcement by park officials in 2006 of a new study to determine whether the recreational benefit of more trails is worth the risk of additional damage to the ecosystem.

Managed by the National Park Service, the preserve encompasses 115 miles (185 km) of the 1,800-mile (3,000 km) Yukon River and the entire Charley River basin. The preserve protects the undeveloped Charley River and a significant portion of the upper Yukon. The interior Alaskan region experiences extremes of weather, with temperatures that can vary from in winter to in summertime. The Yukon provided a means of access to the region, which is entirely roadless, during the late 19th century and early 20th centuries. Gold rushes in Alaska brought prospectors, who operated gold dredges to recover significant quantities of placer gold from area creeks. Today the preserve includes part of the route of the annual Yukon Quest dogsled race, which runs every February. During the summer float trips are popular on the Yukon and Charley Rivers. Geography Map of Yukon–Charley Rivers National Preserve Also see resolution adjustable pdf map No roads access Yukon–Charley Rivers National Preserve. The closest approaches by road are to the village of Eagle, upstream on the Yukon to the southeast of the preserve, on the Taylor Highway, and via the Steese Highway to Circle, downstream on the Yukon to the northwest of the preserve. Access from those points to the preserve is usually by air taxi or boat. The northern part of the preserve includes a portion of the Yukon River valley, which runs from east to west after entering Alaska from Canada near Eagle. The southern portion of the preserve includes the entire drainage of the Charley River, one of the Yukon's tributaries. The preserve adjoins Steese National Conservation Area to the west. The Charley River is designated a National Wild and Scenic River, largely undisturbed by people. The preserve and the Yukon valley lie between the Brooks Range to the north and the Alaska Range to the south. The highest elevations in the preserve are about in the headwaters of the Charley River, ranging to about where the Yukon leaves the preserve. =Geology= The Yukon River is the main feature of the preserve, one of the largest rivers in North America. The Yukon's valley is bordered by bluffs and terraces along its course, representing river downcutting through alluvial deposits. The lowlands were never glaciated during the last ice age, but higher valleys did see glaciation, in which the ice-free land was mostly tundra. As the climate warmed, forests advanced from the south. Ecology The preserve's climate is subarctic at lower elevations, typically up to the timberline at to , and arctic at higher elevations. Winters extend from October to March, with temperatures that occasionally reach . Days are short, with about six hours of light. Summertime highs range between and and exceptional high temperatures of have been recorded. Summer nights in June and early July do not get fully dark, owing to the preserve's location close to the Arctic Circle. The majority of the preserve is taiga, or boreal forest, primarily black spruce, white spruce, with alder, willow, birch, cottonwood and polar. The preserve environment is a fire-dependent ecosystem, with a mosaic of burned and unburned lands. Hot summer temperatures and dry weather allow lightning strikes to start fires which maintain a diverse ecosystem. The Yukon is host to significant quantities of economically important fish. The chief salmon species in the portion of the Yukon that runs in the preserve are chinook, coho and chum. Large mammals in the preserve include wolf, black bear, moose, caribou, and Dall's sheep. Other fish include Arctic grayling, northern pike, sheefish, burbot and whitefish. The best fishing is found along tributaries of the Yukon or near their mouths, where the brown, muddy water of the Yukon is more clear. Activities Dogsled team leaving Slaven's Roadhouse during the Yukon Quest race As a consequence of Yukon-Charley Rivers' designation as a national preserve, both subsistence hunting by local residents and sport hunting are allowed within the preserve, subject to Alaskan game regulations. Camping is permitted on any publicly owned lands within the preserve. The Charley River can be floated from June through August. The majority of the river is rated at Class II, with some Class III and even Class IV during high water. Most of the rapids occur in the area of the bluffs where the river emerges into the main Yukon valley. The Yukon River can be floated from May to September. The most popular trip is from Eagle to Circle, a trip, averaging per day. History Archaeological investigations in the Yukon valley have not been well-documented. Evidence from other portions of northern Alaska indicates that people lived in the area as early as 11,000 years before the present. Northern Athabaskan speakers moved into the region by about 1500 BP. One theory proposes that the eruption of the White River Ash about 1900 years ago from Mount Churchill in the St. Elias Mountains displaced people from the region of Kluane Lake into the relatively ash-free Yukon valley. The inhabitants of the upper Yukon valley just prior to historic times were the Hän people, descendants of the Athabaskan migrants. In 1886 gold was discovered on the Fortymile River, drawing prospectors to the Yukon. The influx of newcomers caused the Hän to resettle in towns, in many cases working for miners. Circle City was established in 1893, Seventymile in 1888 and Mission Creek, now Eagle in 1895, all as mining camps. A number of sites in the preserve were developed for mining during this period. The boom died down by 1902, but two large dredge operations continued at Coal Creek and Woodchopper Creek, with smaller claims at scattered sites. Geologist John Beaver Mertie, Jr. mapped much of the region in the early 1900s. On January 9, 1986, the United States Board of Geographic Names approved naming an Alaskan mountain range after Mertie. The Mertie Mountains are located in the Yukon–Charley Rivers National Preserve, between Fairbanks and Eagle. The range is approximately 187 km (117 miles) long and 176 km (110 miles) wide. =Mining remnants= The Coal Creek gold dredge Numerous rustic cabins and historic sites are located in the preserve. One of the most significant sites is Slaven's Roadhouse, at Coal Creek, built by prospector Frank Slaven in 1932. Slaven lived there until 1938, after which Gold Placers, Inc. used the cabin as a bunkhouse and supply drop for their gold dredging operations on Coal Creek. The cabin continues to be used as a dog drop station during the Yukon Quest dogsled races each February. In the summer the cabin serves as a bunkhouse for visitors and Park Service personnel. The roadhouse is a contributing feature in the Coal Creek Historic Mining District, which encompasses a number of structures associated with coal dredge mining on Coal Creek. The district's centerpiece is the Coal Creek dredge, floating in the creek. The dredge was built in Oakland, California in 1935 and shipped to the site, operating from 1936 until 1977, having recovered $3,229,124.61 worth of gold. Biederman's Cabin is located nearby, where mail carrier Ed Biederman boarded dogs for miners and trappers during the summer, using two fish wheels to catch enough salmon to feed the dogs. =Administration and designations= Yukon-Charley Rivers National Monument was proclaimed on December 1, 1978, by President Jimmy Carter using his authority under the Antiquities Act.

The term Hopewell (taken from the land owner who owned the land where one of the mound complexes was located) culture is applied to a broad network of beliefs and practices among different Native American peoples who inhabited a large portion of eastern North America. The culture is characterized by its construction of enclosures made of earthen walls, often built in geometric patterns, and mounds of various shapes. Visible remnants of Hopewell culture are concentrated in the Scioto River valley near present-day Chillicothe, Ohio. The most striking Hopewell sites contain earthworks in the form of squares, circles, and other geometric shapes. Many of these sites were built to a monumental scale, with earthen walls up to high outlining geometric figures more than across. Conical and loaf-shaped earthen mounds up to high are often found in association with the geometric earthworks. The people who built them had a detailed knowledge of the local soils, and they combined different types to provide the most stability to the works. It required the organized labor of thousands of man hours, as people carried the earth in handwoven baskets.

Each mound within the group covered the remains of a charnel house. After the Hopewell people cremated the dead, they burned the charnel house. They constructed a mound over the remains. They also placed artifacts, such as copper figures, mica, projectile points, shells, and pipes in the mounds. =Discovery and protection= European Americans first mapped the site in the 1840s. The archaeologists Ephraim George Squier and Edwin Hamilton Davis were the first excavators of the site and amassed a large collection of Mound artifacts that is now preserved at the British Museum.British Museum Collection Much of it was destroyed during World War I when the United States Army constructed a military training base, Camp Sherman, on the site. After the war, they razed the camp. The Ohio Historical Society conducted an archaeological excavation of the site from 1920–1922, followed by reconstruction of the mounds. \\"Mound City Group\\", Hopewell Culture National Historical Park, National Park Service, accessed 23 Sep 2009 In 1923, the Department of Interior declared the Mound City Group a National Monument, to be administered by the Federal government. In 1992, Mound City Group was renamed and expanded as Hopewell Culture National Historical Park. Its definition included remnants of four other nearby earthwork and mound systems. Two Ross County sites are within a few miles of Mound City and open to the public. Seip Earthworks is located west of Chillicothe on U.S. Route 50. Hopewell Mound Group is the site of the 1891 excavation on the land of Mordecai Hopewell (for whom the culture is named). Hopeton Earthworks located across the Scioto River from Mound City and High Bank Works, which is closed to the public. The Ohio Historical Society also maintains a number of mound systems and elaborate earthworks in the southern Ohio area, including the National Historic Landmarks of Fort Ancient, Newark Earthworks, and Serpent Mound. Fifteen mound complexes earlier identified in the county have been lost to agriculture or urban development. The national park contains nationally significant archaeological resources, including large earthwork and mound complexes. These provide insight into the sophisticated and complex social, ceremonial, political, and economic life of the Hopewell people. The park visitor's center features museum exhibits with artifacts excavated from the Mound City Group, an orientation film, book sales area, and self-guided and guided tours.

President Calvin Coolidge authorized a classical memorial and President Franklin D. Roosevelt dedicated the completed structure in 1936. On February 25, 1779, Lieutenant Colonel George Rogers Clark, older brother of William Clark, led the capture of Fort Sackville and British Lt. Governor Henry Hamilton as part of the celebrated Illinois Campaign, which lasted from 1778 to 1779. The heroic march of Clark's men from Kaskaskia on the Mississippi River in mid-winter and the subsequent victory over the British remains one of the most memorable feats of the American Revolution. In 1966, Indiana transferred the site to the National Park Service. Adjacent to the memorial is a visitor center which presents interpretive programs and displays. The center is situated on South 2nd Street in Vincennes. The site is located in the Vincennes Historic District. History Bronze statue of George Rogers Clark by Hermon Atkins MacNeil under the saucer domeMacNeil also designed the Standing Liberty quarter. The memorial is placed at the believed site of Fort Sackville; no archeological evidence has shown the exact location, but it is undoubtedly within the park's boundaries. The episode being commemorated marked the finest moment in General George Rogers Clark's career. He was sent by the state of Virginia to protect its interest in the Old Northwest. His 1778-1779 campaign included the founding of Louisville, Kentucky and the capture of British forts in the lower Ohio and Mississippi valleys. Forces under Clark's command had captured Fort Sackville months before, but when notified that British forces under Henry Hamilton had retaken the fort, Clark led a desperate march to retake the fort again for the American cause, succeeding on February 25, 1779. This led to the newly formed United States claiming control of what would become the states of Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin in the 1783 Treaty of Paris. As Vincennes grew in the 1800s, it overran the site of Fort Sackville and its boundaries were lost. In 1905, the Daughters of the American Revolution placed a stone marker on what they believed was the location of the fort. In 1929, local residents made a major effort to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Clark's campaign. The state of Indiana chose to build a memorial to General Clark's triumph in the 1930s, with the assistance of the United States government; the various funds amounted to $2.5 million. The memorial was designed by New York architect Frederic Charles Hirons and dedicated June 14, 1936, by President Franklin Roosevelt. Hirons is not credited in the official website. Though the National Park Service in 1976 called the finished memorial the \\"last major Classical style memorial\\" constructed in the United States, the New York State Memorial to Theodore Roosevelt at the American Museum of Natural History by John Russell Pope was also completed in 1936, and Pope's Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C. was completed 1939-1943, are of the same era. Structures The memorial building is a circular granite structure surrounded by sixteen granite fluted Greek Doric columns in a peripteral colonnade, capped with a saucer dome of glass panels and resting on a stylobate. The north and east corners have restrooms and various maintenance rooms. Except for the maintenance rooms, these feature plastered walls and ceilings, marble wainscoting, and terrazzo flooring. Visitors enter the memorial by climbing thirty granite steps in the northwest corner. The basement is unfinished, with fluorescent lighting revealing a ceiling and walls of exposed concrete, and a dirt floor.Arbogast p.2 Other prominent features in the park include John Angel's granite statue of Francis Vigo, a monument overlooking the Wabash River erected in 1934 that honors the Italian- American merchant who assisted General Clark. The adjacent grounds of the Basilica of St. Francis Xavier hold a 1934 bronze statue by Albin Polasek honoring Father Pierre Gibault, another figure in the Revolutionary War. Raoul Josset designed the Lincoln Memorial Bridge across the Wabash River to complement the memorial aesthetically. It includes relief carvings designed by a monument by Nellie Walker on the Illinois side of the bridge and celebrates the migration of Abraham Lincoln. A concrete floodwall that protects the memorial and Vincennes from Wabash flooding is also designed in a complementary Classical style. The grounds also hold a memorial to the soldiers from Knox County who served in World War I, a marker denoting where Clark's headquarters probably stood during his siege of Fort Sackville, and the original Daughters of the American Revolution memorial, which has moved several times due to construction of the main memorial.Arbogast pp.4-5 Murals Muralist Ezra Winter executed a series of seven murals for the building.

This law (Appendix A) contains three provisions. The first authorized the Secretary of the Interior to accept from the State of Indiana, the donation of the Clark Memorial and surrounding grounds for a national park. This was accomplished within one year of the law's enactment. The second provision permits the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with the owners of other historic properties in Vincennes which are associated with George Rogers Clark and the Northwest Territory. Such properties would become part of the park, and the Secretary could assist in their preservation, renewal and interpretation. The third provision requires the Secretary to administer, protect, develop and maintain the park in accordance with the provisions of the act of August 25, 1916, which established the National Park Service. George Rogers Clark NHP was established to commemorate the accomplishments of George Rogers Clark and the expansion of the United States into the Northwest Territory; to commemorate this story and its significance to the American people; and to cooperate in the preservation, renewal and interpretation of the sites and structures in Vincennes associated with this story. The park also commemorates the actions of Father Pierre Gibault and Francis Vigo who sided with Clark against the British. The park is located on the site of Fort Sackville which Clark captured from the British during the American Revolution on February 25, 1779. The victory extended American land claims in the Ohio Valley and contributed to the United States acquisition of the Northwest Territory in the 1783 Treaty of Paris. No structures dating from the Revolution exist in the park today. The historical theme represented by George Rogers Clark NHP is the \\"Revolution, War in the Frontier,\\" according to 1987 History and Prehistory in the National Park System and the National Historic Landmarks Program. Restoration  August 9, 2008, George Rogers Clark National Historical Park closed for 13 months to complete a three- million-dollar renovation by Frontier Waterproofing, Inc out of Denton, Texas. Park Superintendent Dale Phillips said, \\"This is a once-in-a-lifetime restoration project, and is critically needed for the long-term preservation of the Clark Memorial\\". The main goal was to fix the drainage of the terrace, which has leaked since the 1930s, and renovate the access steps. The monument reopened September 24, 2009, and was rededicated on October 3, 2009. The 2009 Spirit of Vincennes Rendezvous was not impacted by the renovation. Work during the renovation included demolition and installation of new parapets and rustications; repair of wall cracks; removal, temporary storage, and numbering of approximately 1,000 large granite paving stones; installation of new waterproofing on the existing concrete structural deck of the plaza and the monuments stylobate; cleaning and repair of the granite stone, steps, and veneer; installation of a new exposed aggregate concrete walking surface around the Monument plaza; and replacing the existing sprinkler system and landscaping elements. This repaired problems first identified in a 1939 structural inspection. George Rogers Clark National Historical Park was honored on an America the Beautiful Quarter representing Indiana in 2017.

The park includes land in the Shenandoah Valley in Jefferson County, West Virginia; Washington County, Maryland and Loudoun County, Virginia. The park is managed by the National Park Service, an agency of the U.S. Department of the Interior. Originally designated Harpers Ferry National Monument in 1944, the park was declared a National Historical Park by the U.S. Congress in 1963. The park includes the historic town of Harpers Ferry, notable as a center of 19th-century industry and as the scene of John Brown's failed abolitionist uprising. Consisting of almost , it includes the site of which Thomas Jefferson once wrote, \\"The passage of the Potomac through the Blue Ridge is perhaps one of the most stupendous scenes in Nature\\" after visiting the area in 1783.Jefferson, Thomas (1829). Notes on the State of Virginia, p. 17. Wells and Lilly, Boston. Due to a mixture of historical events and ample recreational opportunities, all within 50 miles (80 km) of Washington, D.C., the park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. The Park's Superintendent is presently Tyrone Brandyburg. The park was originally planned as a memorial to John Brown, responsible for what is by far the most famous incident in Harpers Ferry's history, his 1859 raid and capture of the federal armory. NPS officials in the 1930s focused on John Brown's raid and the Civil War to justify acquiring parts of Harpers Ferry for a historical and military park. Like the figure of John Brown himself, this proved enormously controversial, with opposition from the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the Sons of Confederate Veterans. Today (2018) there is no mention of John Brown on the Park's home page (http://www.nps.gov/hafe), although the raid is covered in the history section of the website. Early history Native American history in the region dates back to at least 8,000 years ago. The Tuscarora people were the last of the native peoples known to inhabit the area in large numbers, essentially vanishing in the early 18th century. One of these European immigrants, Robert Harper, obtained a patent for the land from the Virginia legislature in 1751. Note that prior to 1863, West Virginia was still a part of Virginia. The town was originally known as Shenandoah Falls at Mr. Harper's Ferry (1763) due to the ferry business Robert Harper managed and operated. Today, the original house built by Robert Harper is the oldest remaining structure in the lower part of the park. George Washington visited the area during his trip to the rivers' confluence in 1785, searching for a waterway to ship goods westward. Later, Washington began the construction of the federal Harpers Ferry Armory on the site, utilizing waterpower from the rivers for manufacturing purposes. Meriwether Lewis, under government contract, procured most of the weaponry and associated hardware that would be needed for the Lewis and Clark Expedition at the armory in Harpers Ferry. Blacksmiths also built a collapsible iron boat frame for the expedition. Between the years 1820 to 1840, John H. Hall worked to perfect the manufacturing of interchangeable parts at the armory. Utilizing precision molds and jigs, this was one of the birthplaces of precision manufacturing so that armaments and related mechanical equipment could be standardized and parts would be interchangeable. Subsequently, the development of the modern bullet to replace the round lead slug was achieved by James H. Burton and this improvement was adopted by the U.S. Army in 1855. Employing at times up to 400 workers, the armory produced over half a million muskets and rifles between 1801 and 1860. John Brown's Raid and the American Civil War Harper's Weekly illustration of U.S. Marines attacking John Brown's \\"Fort\\" Abolitionist John Brown led an armed group in the capture of the armory in 1859. Brown had hoped he would be able to arm the slaves and lead them against U.S. forces in a rebellion to overthrow slavery. After his capture in the armory by a group of Marines (led by U.S. Army Colonel Robert E. Lee), Brown was hanged, predicting in his last words that civil war was looming on the horizon, a prediction that came true less than two years later. The most important building remaining from John Brown's raid is the firehouse, now called John Brown's Fort, where he resisted the Marines. John Brown's Fort today The American Civil War (1861–1865) found Harpers Ferry right on the boundary between the Union and Confederate forces. The strategic position along this border and the valuable manufacturing base was a coveted strategic goal for both sides, but particularly the South due to its lack of manufacturing centers. Consequently, the town exchanged hands no less than eight times during the course of the war. Union forces abandoned the town immediately after the state of Virginia seceded from the Union, burning the armory and seizing 15,000 rifles. Colonel Thomas J. Jackson, who would later become known as \\"Stonewall\\", secured the region for the Confederates a week later and shipped most of the manufacturing implements south. Jackson spent the next two months preparing his troops and building fortifications, but was ordered to withdraw south and east to assist P.G.T. Beauregard at the First Battle of Bull Run. Union troops returned in force, occupying the town and began to rebuild parts of the armory. Stonewall Jackson, now a major general, returned in September 1862 under orders from Robert E. Lee to retake the arsenal and then to join Lee's army north in Maryland. Jackson's assault on the Federal forces there, during the Battle of Harpers Ferry led to the capitulation of 12,500 Union troops, which was the largest number of Union prisoners taken at one time during the war. The town exchanged hands several more times over the next two years. Storer College Storer College postcard (1910) Storer College was built in Harpers Ferry as one of the first integrated schools in the U.S. Frederick Douglass served as a trustee of the college, and delivered a memorable oration on the subject of John Brown there in 1881. Subsequent rulings known as Jim Crow Laws led other African American leaders such as Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois to hold the second Niagara Movement (an early form of the NAACP) conference at the school in 1906 to discuss ways to peacefully combat legalized discrimination and segregation. After the end of school segregation in 1954, Storer College closed the following year. What remains of the Storer College campus is now administered by the National Park Service, as part of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park, Harpers Ferry Center, and the Stephen T. Mather Training Center. The park today A panoramic image of the Shenandoah River and the Potomac Railroad Bridge at Harpers Ferry Several historical museums now occupy restored 19th century buildings in the Lower Town Historic District of Harpers Ferry. Nearly half a million people visit the park each year. (In comparison, 15 million people visit Washington, DC, each year.) North of the park and across the Potomac from Harpers Ferry is the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. The canal, which operated from 1828 to 1924, provided a vital waterway link with areas up and downstream prior to and during the early years after the arrival of the railroad. Today, the canal towpath and park, which provide access to the Maryland Heights section of the Harpers Ferry N.H.P., can be accessed by foot from Harpers Ferry via a footbridge constructed by the National Park Service alongside tracks on the railroad bridge over the Potomac, or via car by traveling east from Harpers Ferry on U.S. Route 340 to access points near Sandy Hook, Maryland. Aside from the extensive historical interests of the park, recreational opportunities include fishing, boating, and whitewater rafting as well as hiking, with the Appalachian Trail passing right through the park. The park adjoins the Harpers Ferry Historic District, as well as two other National Register of Historic Places locations: St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church and the B & O Railroad Potomac River Crossing. On June 6, 2016, the Harpers Ferry National Historical Park was featured on the third 2016 release of the America the Beautiful Quarters series. In the middle of the quarter is a depiction of John Brown's Fort, while the outside has the year (2016), location (Harpers Ferry), and the state (West Virginia).

Retrieved 2013-06-11. was an American blues pianist and composer. He recorded a number of sides for Okeh Records in 1925 and 1926. Thomas was born in Houston, Texas, United States, and displayed an early talent for blues playing and composition. He was one of several musicians in his family. His brother George Washington Thomas was also a skilled piano player and composer, while his sister Sippie Wallace and niece Hociel Thomas were singers of note. Though he died at a young age, Thomas was nonetheless an influence on the Chicago boogie woogie school of pianists. Albert Ammons and Meade Lux Lewis both cited him as an influence. His most famous track was \\"Suitcase Blues\\" (8958-A Okeh 8227), which was issued on CD in 1992 as part of the box set, Roots 'N Blues: The Retrospective. The Thomas brothers also co-wrote \\"The Fives\\", which Ammons and Lewis cited as an essential boogie-woogie number.

Coterminous with the boundaries of Kalawao County and primarily on Kalaupapa peninsula, it was established by Congress in 1980 to expand upon the earlier National Historic Landmark site of the Kalaupapa Leper Settlement. It is administered by the National Park Service. Its goal is to preserve the cultural and physical settings of the two leper colonies on the island of Molokai, which operated from 1866 to 1969 and had a total of 8500 residents over the decades. More than 7300 people live on the remainder of the island, which was a site of cattle ranching and pineapple production for decades. Much of these lands were purchased and controlled by the owners and developers of Molokai Ranch. This part of the island is also a tourist destination.  History of Kalaupapa peninsula  Archeological evidence has revealed human habitation by indigenous peoples for more than 900 years before European contact. The peninsula has house sites, cultivated taro fields and irrigation systems, stone walls, and temples (heiau), all constructed by ancient residents. \\"Historical accounts from the early to mid-1800s speak of populations of 1,000 to 2,700 people living on the peninsula, in the valleys, and in the villages\\" but by 1853, there were only about 140 people remaining after epidemics of Eurasian diseases. =History of the Kalaupapa leprosy settlements (1865 – present)= In 1865 the Kingdom legislature passed a law to try to prevent transmission of leprosy, now known as Hansen's disease after the scientist who discovered the bacterium. The disease had been introduced to the islands about 1830 by foreign workers. At the time it was incurable. Sugar planters had brought pressure on the government as they were worried about the labor supply.Pennie Moblo, \\"Ethnic Intercession at Kalaupapa Leprosy Colony, 1871-1887\\", Pacific Studies Vol. 22, no. 2, 1999 (cached) The government arranged for Native Hawaiian inhabitants to be removed from the Kalaupapa to prepare for its development as an isolation settlement for persons with severe leprosy. This cut off the island people's cultural ties and associations with the aina (land), which had been established for centuries. Bringing patients to the isolation settlements, first at Kalawao and then at Kalaupapa, led to broader dislocations across Hawaiian society. In the long term many families were affected and some divided when a member contracted leprosy. The governments of the Kingdom, and subsequently, the Territory and State of Hawaii tried to control leprosy (also known as Hansen's disease), a much feared illness, by relocating patients with severe symptoms to the isolated peninsula. Other patients were treated in quarantine at facilities on the main islands; but families were still broken up in the process. The first settlement was started on the windward side at Kalawao, followed by one at Kalaupapa. In 1890 a total of 1100 persons with leprosy were living here, the peak of resident population. In those years, they generally had to leave family behind on other islands. The effects of both the broken connections with the aina and of family members \\"lost\\" to Kalaupapa are still felt in Hawaii today. The settlements were administered by the Board of Health, with local financial control held by Rudolph Meyer, a German immigrant who worked for the Moloka'i Ranch and lived on the island. Local supervision for decades was by superintendents of Hawaiian and part-Hawaiian ancestry, some appointed from among the patients or family members with persons with leprosy. Belgian missionary priests from the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary were among those who cared for persons with leprosy on Molokai. The most well-known was Belgian-born Father Damien, who served there from 1873 to his death in 1889. For his charity he was canonized by the Roman Catholic Church as a saint in 2009, the 10th person recognized in what is now the United States. Among other missionaries and caregivers, was Mother Marianne Cope, a nun and administrator of St. Joseph's Hospital in Syracuse, New York. As the General Minister of the Sisters of St Francis of Syracuse, she brought six sisters with her to the islands to aid in the care of persons with leprosy and develop the medical facilities. Mother Marianne and sisters of her community developed hospitals, homes and schools on the islands of Oahu and Maui from 1883 to 1888, at which time they traveled to Kalaupapa where she lived and worked there until her death in 1918. In 2012 she was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church. Also serving in the colony was Brother Joseph Dutton, who went to Molokai in 1886 to aid the dying Father Damien. The Congregation of the Sacred Hearts continued to have brothers who devoted their lives to work on Molokai and assist the residents. From the late 20th century, recent figures included Henri Systermans and Fr. Joseph Hendricks, whose death in November 2008 marked the end of this 140-year-old tradition. Since St. Marianne arrived in 1888, sixty-five Sisters of St. Francis have maintained a continuous presence in the settlement. There are two Sisters currently residing at the Bishop Home, established by Mother Marianne in 1888 as the Charles R. Bishop Home for Unprotected Leper Girls and Women to care for those she deemed the most vulnerable of the population. Hansen's disease, found in 1873 to be caused by a bacterium, has been curable since the 1940s with the use of modern antibiotics. There are no active cases of Hansen's disease among residents of the Kalaupapa settlement or on the island of Molokai. After the management of the settlement was turned over to the National Park Service, residents of the former colony were allowed to stay if they chose to do so. They and their descendant families who wish to continue to live in the neighborhood of housing maintained on the peninsula.  Representation in popular culture  *After being given a high award by the Kingdom of Hawaii, Belgian missionary-priest Father Damien attracted considerable publicity to the leper colony in the late 19th century; his story was recounted in popular culture and literature. *Robert Louis Stevenson, who suffered from tuberculosis, then also incurable, visited the Molokai leper colony after Father Damien's death in 1889. He was moved by Damien's care for patients and described the settlement as a \\"prison fortified by nature.\\" 2000-foot-high mountains cut off the settlement from the rest of the island. He published a 6,000-word open letter praising Father Damien's work. Robert Louis Stevenson was inspired by Mother Marianne and the girls of the Bishop Home. He taught the girls croquet, sent a piano as a gift and wrote a poem to Mother Marianne and sisters. Both a letter about the girls and the poem are published in \\"The Life of Robert Louis Stevenson\\" by Graham Balfour. *Jack London visited in 1908 and wrote the short stories, \\"Lepers of Molokai\\" and \\"Koolau the Leper\\" in response. *James Michener's 1959 novel Hawaii describes life in the colony in the difficult early times. *The 1999 movie Molokai, featuring Peter O'Toole and Kris Kristofferson, features the life of Father Damien and his work among persons with leprosy. * Alan Brennert's 2003 novel Moloka'i recounts some of the history of the Kalaupapa leprosy settlement through the eyes of fictional character, Rachel Kalama, exiled there at age 8 *Location for a Hawaii Five-0 investigation into a murder in the episode Kai Pa'ani Nui (Season 7, Episode 15).

The community of Kalaupapa, on the leeward side of Kalaupapa Peninsula, is still home for a few elderly surviving former Hansen's disease patients. Some were disfigured by the disease before being cured and wanted to continue refuge here. They have shared their memories and experiences of their ordeals and of life on the island. Surviving structures at Kalawao, on the windward side of the peninsula, are the Protestant church of Siloama, established in 1866, and Saint Philomena Catholic Church, which is associated with the work of St. Father Damien.

It includes the National Historic Landmarked archaeological site known as the Honokōhau Settlement. The park was established on November 10, 1978, for the preservation, protection and interpretation of traditional native Hawaiian activities and culture. History Kaloko and Honokōhau are the names of two of the four different ahupuaa, or traditional mountain-to-sea land divisions encompassed by the park. Although in ancient times this arid area of lava rock was called kekaha aole wai (lands without water), the abundant sea life attracted settlement for hundreds of years. =Kaloko= Kaloko (meaning \\"the pond\\" in the Hawaiian language) is a site of fishponds used in ancient Hawaii is on the North end of the park. The first reference to the pond comes from the story of Kamalalawalu, about 300 years ago. The kuapā (seawall) is over 30 feet wide and 6 feet high, stretching for 750 feet. Constructed by hand without mortar, the angle and gaps between the stones deflected the surf better than many modern concrete seawalls.The Spirit of Kaloko brochure from National Park Service Aimakapā fishpond is an important wetland area protecting native birds including the koloa maoli (Hawaiian duck, Anas wyvilliana), alae keokeo (Hawaiian coot, Fulica alai), āeo (Hawaiian stilt, Himantopus mexicanus knudseni), aukuu (black-crowned night heron, Nycticorax nycticorax), among others.

The Aiopio Fishtrap is a pond, with a stone wall forming an artificial enclosure along the naturally curved shoreline of a bay. Small openings allowed young fish to enter from the sea, but as they grew larger (or at low tide) they were easily caught with nets inside the trap as needed. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. Recreation Several restored trails include about one mile of the Māmalahoa Trail. It was built in the mid-19th century, and evolved over the years into the Hawaii Belt Road which encircles the entire island. The coastal trail is part of the Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail. The Honokōhau boat harbor provides a launching area for traditional canoes, fishing boats, Scuba diving and snorkeling tours of the area.

Throughout the later half of the 19th century and the first two decades of the 20th, century, immigrants from across Europe migrated to the Keweenaw to work in the copper mines and mining communities. By 1910 the Copper Country had been settled by French Canadian, German, Chinese, Irish, Cornish, Croatian, Finnish, Italian, Greek and Syrian people. When news of the region's rich native copper was first widely published in the 1830s, many families from the English county of Cornwall immigrated to the Upper Peninsula, bringing the Cornish pasty and their region's knowledge of hard-rock mining with them. Several park Heritage Sites, including the log cabin village of \\"Old Victoria,\\" recall Cornish heritage in the region. Later in the 1800s, many families from Finland emigrated to the United States. Until 1918, Finland belonged to Russia as a Grand Duchy. A large percentage of these Finns settled in the Western Upper Peninsula because of perceived similarities between their old and new homes, and found work in the Keweenaw. Finnish saunas can still be found throughout the area. Several park Heritage Sites, including the \\"Hanka Homestead\\", recall the Finnish influx. https://www.nps.gov/kewe/learn/education/classrooms/upload/Immigration-to-the- Keweenaw-Lesson-Plan-2.pdf Calumet Unit The Calumet Unit of the Keweenaw National Historical Park includes many sites in and around the villages of Calumet and Laurium, which are not ghost towns but operating human communities that have survived the shutdown of their parent employer, the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company, in 1968. By digging shafts into the rock, the men and owners of the Calumet & Hecla found geological formations of rock laced with nuggets of almost pure copper. The Calumet & Hecla was the richest of the separate copper mines of the Keweenaw, and the towns built at the mine head reflect its productivity. A 1,200-seat opera house, large churches built of Lake Superior brownstone, and mansions built by the mining bosses survive as memories of the Calumet mine's glory years.

Opened in 1929, it was one of the five Loew's Wonder Theatres, a series of flagship Loew's movie palaces in the New York City area. It was designed by the architectural firm of Rapp and Rapp in a Baroque/Rococo style. Tri-plexed in 1974, and then closed in 1986, it was dark for years. It was purchased by the city in 1993 and been operated by a volunteer organisation, the Friends of the Loews, since that time.http://www.loewsjersey.org The theater was designated as a New Jersey Registered Historic Site in 2009. In a move opposed by Friends of the Loews, the city in June 2014, agreed to let AEG Live operate the venue. After going to court, the lease by Friends of the Loews remains in effect.  Overview and description  Journal Square at dusk The Loew's Jersey opened September 28, 1929. It was one of five \\"Loew's Wonder Theatres\\" that opened in 1929 and 1930 in the New York City area. Journal Square, a neighborhood in Jersey City, New Jersey, was a popular entertainment and shopping destination. In addition to the Loew's Jersey, two other entertainment theatres were present in Journal Square: the State Theatre and the Stanley Theatre. The theatre was built on land purchased from the Pennsylvania Railroad and located on a main commercial avenue that ran the full length of Hudson County, New Jersey from Bayonne, New Jersey at one end through to Union City, New Jersey. Journal Square also served as a terminus for many Public Service Railway trolley and bus lines. And the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad, now known as the Port Authority Trans- Hudson or PATH, has a major station at Journal Square with lines to New York City, Hoboken, New Jersey and Newark, New Jersey. The cost of construction in 1929 was US$2 million. The capacity of the theatre on opening day was 3,021 patrons. The theatre opened with the film Madame X, a live musical performance by Ben Black and his Rhythm Kings and the Loew's Symphony Orchestra. Tickets to view the movie plus live performances were $0.35. Additionally, the theatre was equipped with a 4 manual/23 rank Robert Morton \\"Wonder Morton\\" pipe organ. The theatre was built with the intention of presenting both live performances and films. The stage of the theatre was equipped with a full counterweighted fly system with the 50'-0\\" wide screen rigged to be flown in and out. In front of the stage, a three segment orchestra pit was installed. One segment, on left side of the pit as viewed from the audience, contained the pipe organ console. The organ lift could rise independently and rotate. The remaining width of the orchestra pit could also raise, lifting the orchestra up to the stage level. The third segment was an integrated piano lift in the center of the orchestra lift that could either rise independently or with the orchestra lift. The theatre was equipped with a stage lighting system that controlled a system of lighting fixtures and units on the stage and in the auditorium. Beneath the stage, two levels of dressing rooms, along with a trap room and rehearsal hall were provided. The auditorium was laid out with approximately 1,900 seats on a sloping ground floor, divided into sections by aisles running from the entrance of the auditorium to the stage. An additional 1,200 seats were placed on a steeply sloped balcony. The lobby of the theatre was built as a three story oval with restroom facilities on the second level. Both the Ladies' and Men's restroom featured elaborate decoration and additional spaces for makeup application and socialization. The lobby also possessed a grand chandelier and a promenade. The exterior of the theatre was dressed with terra cotta tiles and large marquees. A large vertical sign announcing the theatre's name rose on the righthand tower of the building's face and a marquee with interchangeable lettering was installed over the entrance. St. George and the dragon At the apex of the front facade of the building, a Seth Thomas animated clock was installed. The clock featured a white faced clock that was illuminated from behind with a statue of Saint George and a statue of a dragon. On the quarter-hour, the clock would chime and the statues would perform. The dragon was equipped with red light bulbs in its mouth to represent fire and the statue of Saint George would be tilted by a motor toward the dragon, simulating a spear lunge. The theatre was added to the New Jersey Register of Historic Places on August 15, 1985. It also received a Determination of Eligibility from the National Register of Historic Places on October 17, 1985 but was not listed due to an objection by the owner.  Triplexing  In 1974, the Loew's Corporation had the theatre subdivided into three smaller theatres. Two theatres were created on the ground floor by erecting a wall in the center aisle of the auditorium that extended from the entrance from the lobby to just beyond the end of the balcony. Walls were constructed across the width of the auditorium connecting the dividing center wall to the auditorium's outer walls. Within these new theatres, projection booths were built. The third theatre was created by having patrons sit in the balcony and watch a movie projected on the original screen of the theatre using the original projection booth. In an effort to reduce cleaning efforts and expenses, the seating on the ground floor that was no longer accessible to patrons was removed and disposed of. The pipe organ was also removed from the theatre.  Closing  The theatre closed in August 1986. The final film shown was Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives. The Loew's Corporation sold the theatre to Hartz Mountain, who announced plans to demolish the theatre and build a new structure on the site. Preservationists began a campaign to save the structure and succeeded in saving the building from demolition. The theatre was subsequently sold to the city of Jersey City, the current owner.  Restoration  The theatre remained closed from 1986 through to 1996 while the preservation efforts occurred. During that time, the building suffered some vandalism and some objects of value were removed. Also, due to the lack of maintenance, heating, humidity control, water and electrical services during that period, mechanical systems, paint surfaces and other vulnerable finishes deteriorated. Volunteers began restoration of the theatre once it had been acquired by the city of Jersey City, to prevent it from being demolished. The volunteers removed the partitions that divided the auditorium into three theatres and restored mechanical systems. They also rehabilitated and installed projection equipment, allowing the theatre to once again present films. Other efforts restored the on stage systems, repairing the original lighting system, fly system and dressing rooms. Volunteers also restored the seating of the auditorium. The Garden State Theatre Organ Society acquired a sister pipe organ to the missing Loew's Jersey pipe organ, originally installed at the Loew's Paradise theatre, and began the installation and restoration of the organ. A video of the organ being played on November 3, 2007, is available on YouTube.  Projection system  The Loew's Jersey is equipped to present 35 mm films in their original 1.33:1, 1.37:1, 1.85:1 and 2.39:1 aspect ratios with adjustable horizontal and vertical masking on its 50-foot-wide screen. Films are projected using Ashcraft Super Core-Lite carbon-arc lamphouses and modified Norelco (Kinoton) FP-20 projectors. Work is currently underway to install 70 mm projection equipment, as well as Dolby Digital, DTS, and six-track magnetic sound. = Volunteers = Volunteers continue to be the primary force in the restoration of the Loew's Jersey. Volunteers come from throughout the New York and Northern New Jersey metro area. Some volunteers bring experience from the film or theatrical industries but the vast majority of volunteers are individuals without prior experience in restoring or operating a performance venue. Their efforts, in performing duties such as painting, cleaning, preparing and selling concessions or serving as house staff for events, allow the theatre to operate successfully. The theatre holds an \\"open door\\" volunteer work call most Saturdays from 10 am to 6 pm year round. Volunteers and individuals interested in volunteering are welcome to drop in and participate. Programming  As of 2007, the Loew's Jersey presents a wide range of programming. This includes film weekends, generally one weekend per month from September through June, where approximately three classic films gathered around a common theme are presented. Often, speakers or performers from the films are presented before the movie. The Loew's Jersey does not show films in current release. Other events currently presented at the Loew's Jersey include performances of Gilbert and Sullivan operas, Jersey City sponsored events, touring productions (such as Nickelodeon's Jamorama, a live show for children) and live performances by musicians and bands such as Beck and The Decemberists. Additionally, the Loew's Jersey is a popular venue for film and photography shoots. The lobby of the Loew's Jersey was the disco in the film The Last Days of Disco and was featured in a 2007 Geico commercial featuring their gecko character., The theatre has appeared in two A&E; specials and numerous magazines as a backdrop for brides and other fashions. In February 2011 the band The Strokes shot a music video for the single \\"Under Cover of Darkness\\" off of their 2011 album Angles at the Loew's Jersey Theatre, featuring the main lobby, promenade and stage.http://www.nj.com/news/jjournal/index.ssf?/base/news-5/1298273119205280.xml&coll;=3 The Trans-Siberia Orchestra filmed \\"The Ghosts of Christmas Eve\\" in the Loew's Jersey.

Johnson National Historical Park is a United States National Historical Park in central Texas about west of Austin in the Texas Hill Country. The park protects the birthplace, home, ranch, and final resting place of Lyndon B. Johnson, 36th President of the United States. During Johnson's administration, the LBJ Ranch was known as the \\"Texas White House\\" because the President spent approximately 20% of his time in office there. Districts and features The park consists of two discontiguous areas, the Johnson City District and the LBJ Ranch District. The Johnson City District, located in Johnson City, contains the boyhood home of President Johnson and his grandparents' log cabin settlement, as well as the National Park Visitor Center. The LBJ Ranch District is located roughly west of Johnson City along the north side of the Pedernales River in Gillespie County. The ranch was the Johnson family retreat during his period of greatest influence, and is the site of the family cemetery. This gives the visitors a perspective of President Johnson's life when he was in office. =Johnson City= The Johnson City Unit is located on the south side of the city, with parking areas at the visitors center on Lady Bird Lane, and on United States Route 290 at N Street. The visitors center, located in a former hospital, provides an introduction to the park, exhibits and films about President Johnson and his wife Lady Bird. A short way north of the visitors center is the Johnson Boyhood Home, an 1880s Victorian house where he lived with his parents from age five. This house, restored by Johnson while he was president, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965. West of the visitors center is the Johnson Settlement, a restored prairie in which are found the dogtrot house of Johnson's grandfather, and other 19th-century agricultural buildings. =LBJ Ranch= President Johnson and his wife Lady Bird greet Republicans Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew, the 1968 presidential and vice-presidential nominees, at the LBJ Ranch in August 1968. The ranch is located on the north side of United States Route 290, about fourteen miles west of Johnson City, with its main access through the Lyndon B. Johnson State Park and Historic Site, which lies between the highway and the south bank of the Pedernales River. The National Park Service lands lie north of the river. Among the sites preserved at the Ranch are the President's first school, his reconstructed birthplace, the Texas White House, and the Johnson Family Cemetery, where both President and Lady Bird Johnson are buried. Visitors take a self-guided auto driving tour from State Park visitor center; a permit is required. On August 2, 2018, the National Park Service announced that the Texas White House and Pool House were temporarily closed to visitors due to structural issues. History The park was authorized on December 2, 1969, as Lyndon B. Johnson National Historic Site and was redesignated as a National Historical Park on December 28, 1980. Present holdings are approximately 1,570 acres (6.4 km2), 674 acres (2.7 km2) of which are federal. The Johnson family continues to donate land to this property; their most recent gift was in April 1995.

The park consists of three separate sites: Fort Rosalie is the site of a former fortification from the 18th century, built by the French. It was later renamed Fort Panmure and controlled in turn by Great Britain, Spain, and the United States. The fort site is not open to the public. The William Johnson House was the home of William Johnson, a 19th-century free African American barber and resident of Natchez whose diary has been published. Melrose was the estate of John T. McMurran, a lawyer, state senator, and planter who lived in Natchez from 1830 until the Civil War. Both Melrose and the William Johnson House contain furnishings related to life in antebellum Natchez and other exhibits. The collection at Melrose's two-story Greek Revival mansion and its slave quarters include painted floor cloths, mahogany, a punkah, a set of Rococo Revival parlor furniture, a set of Gothic Revival dining room chairs, and bookcases with books dating to the 18th century. These were collected from Natchez families, including the McMurran family. The collection in the Johnson house includes furnishings from his life and family. Archaeological objects found in the park are also on display. Legal history The National Historical Park was authorized on October 7, 1988 (, ). The William Johnson House was added to it on September 28, 1990 (, ). As with all historic areas administered by the National Park Service, the park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Fort Rosalie was already included in the National Register as part of the 1972 NRHP-listed Natchez Bluffs and Under-the-Hill Historic District; the William Johnson House, at 210 State St., is a few blocks from the Fort Rosalie site and is both separately NRHP-listed and also included in the Natchez On-Top-of-the-Hill Historic District. Melrose is located about two miles southwest of Fort Rosalie. References * The National Parks: Index 2001–2003. Washington: U.S. Department of the Interior.

In May 2019, the Walnut Street Theatre announced a major expansion, to begin in 2020. History Drawing by Charles Burton (c. 1830) Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford debate domestic policy on September 23, 1976 at the Walnut Street Theatre The Walnut Street Theatre was built by the Circus of Pepin and Breschard, which toured the United States from 1807 until 1815. Pepin and Breschard constructed numerous venues in cities along the East Coast of the United States, which often featured, along with performances of their circus, classical plays as well as horse dramas.Havard, Bernard and Sylvester, Mark D. Walnut Street Theatre. Charleston: Arcadia Publishing, 2008. p.9 The theatre was founded in 1809, going by the name of The New Circus. In 1811, the two partners commissioned architect William Strickland to design and construct a stage and orchestra pit for theatrical performances and the theatre's name was changed to The Olympic. The official website says that the name The Walnut Street Theatre was first used there in 1820, though the name was changed back to The Olympic in 1822 and to The Walnut again in 1828. A travel guidebook from 1849 indicates that in the mid-19th century, this building was called The American Theatre. The Walnut was the first theatre to install gas footlights in 1837. In 1855, it was also the first theatre to feature air conditioning. The theatre switched to electric chandeliers and footlights in 1892. The theatre has undergone many renovations since its opening. The first theatrical production at the theatre was The Rivals in 1812 (President Thomas Jefferson and the Marquis de Lafayette were in attendance). Edwin Booth and John Sleeper Clarke purchased the theatre in 1865, and then the theatre became part of The Shubert Organization in 1941. While part of the Shubert chain, the theatre housed many pre-Broadway tryouts of soon-to-be classics, including: *A Streetcar Named Desire with Marlon Brando (1947) *Mister Roberts with Henry Fonda (1948) *Gigi with Audrey Hepburn (1951) *The Diary of Anne Frank with Susan Strasberg (1955) *A Raisin in the Sun with Sidney Poitier (1959) *A Man For All Seasons starring Paul Scofield (1961) On October 15, 1966, the Walnut Street Theatre was designated a National Historic Landmark, and in 1969, the theatre was purchased by a non-profit organization and turned over to the new Walnut Street Theatre Corporation. On September 23, 1976, it was the site of the first presidential debate between Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter. The Walnut Street Theatre Company, a non-profit regional producing company, was formed in 1983 by Bernard Havard. In 1984, the Walnut Street Theatre School was established and over 1,200 students enroll annually, and 1986 saw the introduction of the Independence Studio on 3 series. To this day, the company produces five productions a season on the theatre's main stage and is the most subscribed theatre company in the world. In Fall 2008, the theater celebrated its 200th season of live entertainment.  Notable performers  The many famous performers who have appeared at the theatre include Ethel Barrymore, Edwin Booth, George M. Cohan, Claudette Colbert, Henry Fonda, Jane Fonda, Edwin Forrest, Julie Harris, Helen Hayes, Katharine Hepburn, Mark Indelicato, Samuel L.

It preserves upland watersheds, mangrove forests, and estuarine and marine environments that support threatened and endangered species. It also contains the Columbus Landing Site, a National Historic Landmark that is the only known site where members of a Columbus expedition set foot on what is now United States territory. The site is marked by Fort Salé, a remaining earthworks fortification from the French period of occupation, about 1617. The park also preserves prehistoric and colonial-era archeological sites including the only existing example of a ball court in the US Virgin Islands. Description Salt River Bay is located on the north side of the island of St. Croix, on its central coast. The bay is a large inlet with two major sections, the left fed by the Salt River. The park property encompasses substantially all of the land abutting the bay. This area's blend of sea and land holds some of the largest remaining mangrove forests in the Virgin Islands, as well as coral reefs and a submarine canyon. Salt River Bay's natural history, its vitally important ecosystem of mangroves, estuary, coral reefs, and submarine canyon, has witnessed thousands of years of human endeavor. Every major period of human habitation in the Virgin Islands is represented: several South American Indian cultures, the 1493 encounter with Columbus, Spanish extermination of the Caribs, attempts at colonization by a succession of European nations, and enslaved West Africans and their descendants. More than a dozen major archeological investigations since 1880, together with historical research, reveal a remarkable story. Park history On February 24, 1992 Congress created the park, under cooperative management of the National Park Service and Government of the Virgin Islands of the United States. These agencies jointly manage this park. As an historic area of the National Park Service, the park was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places on the same day. The Columbus landing site had already been designated a National Historic Landmark on October 9, 1960. The Salt River Bay National Historical Park and Ecological Preserve will be honored with the 53rd quarter in the America the Beautiful Quarters in 2020. Columbus landing site and early history The bay was the location of a Taino village and batey since the 1300s, until conquered by the Caribs in 1425. The Columbus landing site is located on a point at the western side of the bay. It is here that Columbus sent a longboat to shore on November 14, 1493, to explore the area and acquire fresh water and provisions. A nearby village was occupied by Taíno people who had recently been enslaved by invading Carib forces, and Columbus' men took some of the women and children with them when they set out to return to the ship. While en route, they encountered a canoe apparently occupied by Caribs, and a brief skirmish took place, in which one of the canoe's occupants was slain and the others captured. This was the first recorded fight by the Spanish with the New World native population, and they named the site (Cape of the Arrow). The island had been abandoned by the Caribs by 1590 (possibly due either to diseases introduced by contact, Spanish massacres, or other causes), and became Spanish territory. It was taken by the English in 1641, and then the Dutch in 1642. The Dutch built triangular earthworks called Fort Flamand (Flemish Fort) near the site, which was taken over by the French in 1650, and renamed Fort Salé (Salt Fort or du Sal Fort after the governor). It remains the only known structure to survive from this early colonial period. Gudmund Hatt first discovered the site in 1923. Excavations revealed petroglyphs, human sacrifice remains, zemis, and stone belts. Some of the artifacts are now in the National Museum of Denmark. Bioluminescent bay Salt River is home to one of two bioluminescent bays or bio bays on the island of St. Croix (a second bio bay can be found at Altona Lagoon). Every year thousands of people flock to see the glowing water of the Bio Bay that's created by a micro-organism, the dinoflagellate Pyrodinium bahamense. The bay is also home to other bioluminescent marine life including Ctenophora or comb-jellies and Odontosyllis phosphorea or Fireworms. Bio Bays are extremely rare with \\"only seven year-round lagoons known to exist in the Caribbean\\", says Dr. Michael Latz of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego, an expert on bioluminescent organisms, \\"Any place that has a bioluminescent bay should cherish it like a natural wonder, like a treasure\\". A combination of factors creates the necessary conditions for bioluminescence: red mangrove trees surround the water (the organisms have been related to Mangrove forest Usup G, Azanza RV (1998) Physiology and dynamics of the tropical dinoflagellate Pyrodinium bahamense.

A study at the Bio Bay located at Salt River Bay National Historical Park and Ecological Preserve is being conducted by faculty and students from the University of South Carolina, the University of North Carolina Wilmington and the University of the Virgin Islands. Their research is focused on analyzing quality and nutrient composition of the water, the distribution of the dinoflagellate Pyrodinium bahamense, and the abundance of \\"cysts,\\" dormant dinoflagellates embedded in the sea floor. The National Park Service and its partner institutions completed a study of the bioluminescence phenomenon in the Mangrove Lagoon in Spring 2014.http://www.nps.gov/sari/parknews/upload/Mangrove-Lagoon-Report-FINAL.pdf Scuba diving Salt River Canyon is a prehistoric river and waterfall having cut two deep walls facing each other across a quarter mile of blue water. The feature is one of the best known of St. Croix's dive features, along with the Frederiksted Pier. The most popular scuba diving locations are a few hundred yards outside the Salt River Bay. Although most of the boat moorings are 25-45' deep, the actual canyon reaches nearly 500' in depth. Recreational scuba limits are 130' and well into the shadows of the canyon walls. This location is known for its sheer depth, clarity, and wildlife. February and March play host to nursing humpback whales. Year-round are both the nurse shark and reef shark. Occasionally one of the pods of dolphins may come swimming by as well. Sport Diver Magazine has also rated this area as one of the top 5 for water clarity in the Caribbean.

Freier was born in Eschwege, Germany, the son of Rabbi Dr. Moritz (Moshe Yissachar) Freier and Recha Freier, founder of the Youth Aliyah organization. In 1937, while studying at a Christian school, he composed an essay expressing opposition to Nazi doctrine, which led to his expulsion. At his request, his parents sent him to England to continue his education. In 1940, he immigrated to British Mandated Palestine and was accepted as a student in the Department of Mathematics at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Upon completing his first year, his mother arrived and settled in the Katamon neighborhood of Jerusalem, after which he joined the British army in 1941, and served in the Jewish 462nd General Transport Company in North Africa and Italy. In 1943, his unit boarded the Erinpura, the lead convoy ship ferrying units from the North African to European theaters. While crossing the Mediterranean Sea from Alexandria to Malta, German planes spotted the 27-ship convoy, resulting in an attack where the Erinpura sank within four minutes. Amongst the 664 casualties were 139 members of the 462nd. Amazingly, Freier survived. In 1946, he joined other former 462nd members in the clandestine “Ha’Chavura” organization, also known as “The Shadow Unit”, whose aim was to assist Jewish refugees and bring them to Palestine. Freier’s immaculate English and British accent enabled him to impersonate British officers while transporting refugees through Italy in British army vehicles. Additionally, the unit engaged in weapons acquisition for the defense of Jewish settlements in British Mandated Palestine. After eight successful clandestine immigration operations, the ninth, in May 1946, went sour. Freier was apprehended and sent to an Italian prison, where he nonetheless continued to operate, until his release and military discharge in late 1946. He then returned to the Hebrew University to complete his studies in mathematics and physics, and supported himself through private tutoring. In the Israeli War of Independence, he commanded the “Yerucham” intelligence unit in Jerusalem, and later joined the staff of the Foreign Ministry as an intelligence officer. As a result of a professional difference of opinion with his superiors he left and resumed his studies at the university. During this time, he worked as a journalist writing a column for the Jerusalem Post. Between 1953 and 1954, after completing his bachelor’s degree at the Hebrew University, he became the director of the “Emet” unit of the Ministry of Defense, which ultimately developed into Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd. Between 1956 and 1959, Freier served as the scientific advisor to the Israeli embassy in Paris. In this capacity, he played a leading role in the scientific cooperation between the French and Israeli governments in initiating atomic research in Israel. Between 1960 and 1966, he continued studying physics at the Weizmann Institute, completing his master’s degree, and working towards a doctorate. In 1967 he was appointed vice-president of the Weizmann Institute. In 1970, Freier was appointed director of the atomic reactor in Nahal Soreq and, a year later, director general of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission, serving in this capacity until 1976. During the Yom Kippur War, he was summoned to the office of Prime Minister Golda Meir by Defense Minister Moshe Dayan, who recommended a show of Israel’s atomic ability – a recommendation that was never accepted. From 1981 until his death, Freier was the head of the political department of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission. In 1971, Freier initiated the establishment of Israel's first Hi-Tech Science Park between Rechovot and Nes Tziona. Freier chaired the Israeli group of Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs and served on the Pugwash Council. Commemoration In Freier’s memory, the Shalhevet Freier Center for Peace, Science and Technology was established at the Nahal Soreq nuclear research facility in 1996. Additionally, The Weizmann Institute of Science holds an annual contest in physics: “The Shalhevet Freier Safe Competition.” The international contest is open to secondary schools, where each team builds a safe locked by principles of physics and attempts to unlock the safes built by competing teams. In his memory Freier’s sister-in- law, Miriam Freier, established the “Shalhevet Home for the Disabled” in Jerusalem, an apartment house where each physically handicapped member can lead an independent existence.

At about in length, it is the longest state route in Ohio. Its southern terminus is an interchange with U.S. Route 52 (US 52) just west of Chesapeake. Its northern terminus also serves as the eastern terminus of SR 531 in Conneaut. The path of SR 7 stays within of the Ohio River (Ohio's border with West Virginia) for the southern portion, with the river being visible from much of the route. The road also remains within of the Pennsylvania state line for the northern portion. Route description SR 7 starts in Chesapeake and runs along the Ohio River for about . This portion of the highway encounters routes like US 35, US 33, US 50, and Interstate 77 (I-77). It passes through many Ohio River towns like Marietta, Bellaire, and Steubenville. Once it reaches the Pennsylvania border it heads north along SR 11 & US 30 from East Liverpool to Rogers. After it exits State Route 11 in Rogers the route turns north and heads up to Youngstown. Then the highway heads east overlapped with US 62\\\\. After that shared alignment, the highway then heads north again in Hubbard through many small towns to its northern terminus with SR 531 in Conneaut. History In 1912, Intercounty Highway 7 ran along the Ohio River, from Elizabethtown to the Pennsylvania state line in East Liverpool. In 1923, the route was at its greatest extent, the northern terminus of the route was extended from East Liverpool to Conneaut. In 1927, the route's southern terminus was truncated from the Indiana state line to Chesapeake to make way for US 52 and a small segment of US 50 A tunnel was constructed north of Stratton in 1982. The $27 million project was necessitated for the expansion of the W. H.

In 1961, the US 52 expressway opened from Chesapeake westward towards Sheridan. The original eastern terminus of the four-lane divided highway was at the current Chesapeake northbound-only exit ramp east of Tallow Ridge Road. US 52 originally crossed at the present-day Robert C. Byrd Bridge that connects Chesapeake to Huntington, West Virginia. In 1979, the US 52 designation moved to the Nick Joe Rahall II Bridge as tolls on that span were removed that year; the segment east of the Rahall Bridge to the Chesapeake interchange was renumbered to SR 7\\\\. Ten years later, the four-lane expressway was extended eastward to an incomplete trumpet interchange just east of Big Branch Road. A four-lane connector route from the partially complete interchange to the foot of the Robert C. Byrd Bridge at SR 527 was completed. At the same time, the two-lane Chesapeake interchange ramp just east of Tallow Ridge Road was converted to a northbound-only exit ramp. The abrupt terminus at Chesapeake was envisioned to connect to Proctorville. Though the portion of SR 527 is signed as part of SR 7, it is not officially part of the route and many signs show this portion of SR 527 as \\"To SR 7.\\" State Route 7 runs through downtown Gallipolis On May 31, 2002, ground was broken for Phase 1-A of the Proctorville bypass. Phase 1-A entailed a two-lane connector road from the East Huntington Bridge to Irene Road, with the original loop ramp from the bridge to State Route 7 being modified into an access road. Phase 1-B was designated from Irene Road to State Route 7 near Fairland East Elementary in Rome. Phase 2 was envisioned from Irene Road west to Chesapeake. The total cost was originally estimated to be at $165 million. On April 27, 2003, Phase 1-A of the Proctorville bypass opened to traffic. The $6.5 million, section of three-lane roadway was opened from the foot of the East Huntington Bridge to Irene Road and signed as SR 607\\\\. On June 3, 2003, bids were opened for Phase 1-B from Irene Road to SR 7 near Fairland East Elementary. The projected cost of the segment was originally $27 million, however, when the bids were let, the cost had decreased to $24.3 million. The lowest bid, which was also accepted, came in at $22.1 million. The road was designed as a two-lane limited-access facility on a four-lane right-of-way. Construction began on August 4, with an original estimated completion date of June 30, 2005. State Route 7 south of Dilles Bottom, Ohio An unusual amount of rain, blamed on two hurricanes, caused major delays. More than one-dozen major slips along Phase 1-B required an additional $30 million in repairs and the purchase of additional land for highwall excavations. Another change was the design of the roadway; originally projected to be widened in the future when higher traffic counts warrant the expansion, it was designed on wide right-of-way with no grade separation between the opposing lanes. During the repair of the slips, a terraced roadway was constructed to separate the future southbound lanes from the northbound by a highwall when the roadway is expanded to four lanes. Other cost overruns had pushed the cost of construction to $62 million total, which included Phases 1-A and 1-B, up from the original estimates of $32 million. The primary cause was rapidly increasing land values and \\"unchecked zoning\\" along the project's projected right-of-way along with geo-technical problems with rocky soil. Property values along the projected route, for instance, increased 91.5% from 1992 to 2001 alone. In October 2006, a small segment of the Phase 1-B bypass opened to traffic between SR 607 and Irene Road intersection to SR 775. The remainder, east to SR 7 near Fairland East Elementary, opened on December 8, 2006. It includes intersections with SR 775, Kinley Avenue, and SR 7\\\\. Upon completion, phases 1-A and 1-B were signed as SR 7; the bypass from the SR 775 junction to the loop at the East Huntington Bridge was co-numbered with SR 775\\\\. The highway somewhere between Marietta and Pomeroy Phase 2 of the bypass, from the Chesapeake bypass to Irene Road at Proctorville, has not been funded. Funding which had been previously promised by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) was later denied. Phase 2 is estimated to cost $76 million to complete. Also due to the construction delays (slips) on the bypass from SR 775 to Fairland East Elementary School (Phase 1-B), the design of Phase 2 may be realigned to prevent slips during construction. =Pomeroy Bypass= The Pomeroy bypass from Middleport east to US 33 was completed in 1968. At the time of completion, the bypass was two lanes but was upgraded to four lanes, divided, in 1976 from SR 143 to US 33 near Rock Springs. The bypass was extended east in 2000 from Rock Springs to a partial diamond interchange with SR 7 as a four-lane divided expressway. It was initially signed just SR 7\\\\. The diamond interchange was later completed with all connections, and the highway was extended eastward to Ravenswood, West Virginia as US 33\\\\. Major intersections Auxiliary routes =State Route 7 Alternate in Bridgeport= Route of SR 7A in Bridgeport highlighted in red State Route 7 Alternate (SR 7A) is a short connecting loop signed as SR 7 that serves as a link from SR 7, US 40, and US 250 to I-70 in Bridgeport. Its western (southern) terminus is at SR 767, and its eastern (northern) terminus is along US 40 at its intersection with US 250 and the northern terminus of SR 767. SR 7A begins at the intersections of Howard Street and SR 767 (South Lincoln Avenue). SR 7A continues west as Howard Street until it intersects Marion Street. It then runs north as Marion Street, intersects I-70, and then intersects US 40, Main Street. SR 7A continues east on US 40 until it ends at US 250 and SR 767, just west of the West Virginia state line. =State Route 767= State Route 767 (SR 767) is an unsigned north-south state highway in the eastern portion of the U.S. state of Ohio. Currently, it is signed as an alternate route of SR 7. Its southern terminus is at an exit ramp on SR 7 in Bridgeport. The route serves as a connector from northbound SR 7 to SR 7 Alternate, US 40, and US 250. The route's northern terminus is where these U.S. routes overlap eastbound to cross the Ohio River into West Virginia. SR 7A serves as a connector for all of these routes to I-70. =Business State Route 7 from Middleport to Pomeroy= Business State Route 7 stretched from west of Middleport to about east of Pomeroy. The route followed the former alignment of State Route 7 that was replaced by the Pomeroy Bypass, and ran through the downtown areas of Middleport and Pomeroy. It joined with State Route 833 (the former alignment of U.S. Route 33) from west of Pomeroy to east of Pomeroy, including a brief concurrency with State Route 124, and then headed northeast to the eastern U.S. Route 33/State Route 7 interchange. The route was deleted between 2013 and 2015. =Route 7T= State Route 7T (SR 7T) was a future route beginning at US 62 in Youngstown. The entire route was concurrent with US 62T. SR 7T and US 62T were removed on May 2, 2007.

The regiment is based in the Hull sector of Gatineau, Quebec, near Ottawa. Active in all aspects of the day-to-day life of Outaouais residents, the unit is the only francophone military presence in the area. Currently, it is organised into two distinct squadrons: C/S Squadron (Commandement et Services) is made up of the logistical and administrative support staff as well as a holding platoon for new recruits and, D Squadron is the reconnaissance squadron, to which most of the members of the unit belong. History =Foundation & the First World War= On 7 August 1914, a general order of the Canadian Militia authorized the formation of a unit at Hull. Three days earlier, Canada had entered the war against Germany; World War I had broken out. As was the custom of the day, the unit was designated by a number. The regiment's first official name was accordingly the \\"70e Régiment (de Hull)\\". Initiatives to create a militia unit in Hull had nonetheless been under way since the spring of 1914 by a group of Hull citizens, including M.A. Allard, J.A. Cloutier, I. Landre, R. Déziel, J. Paré, J.A. Thibault, J. Gauvin and Lieutenant H. Heyendal. They met at the Collège Notre-Dame. The creation of the Hull Regiment also coincided (on 7 August 1914) with the acceptance by Great Britain of the Canadian Government's offer to pay all the costs of a military contingent. This first contingent left for England on 3 October of that year. In Hull, as everywhere else in Canada, the public greeted the war with enthusiasm. Thousands wanted to leave for the front and to take part in what they believed would be a great adventure. Officers, NCOs and men of Le Régiment de Hull (then known as \\"The Hull Regiment\\"), c. 1922 The first task of the 70th Regiment was to serve as a recruiting centre for the Hull military district. The regimental records show that the unit enrolled 2,108 men, who were subsequently distributed to a variety of battalions, including the 22nd, 38th, 41st and 57th. Although it was not mobilized for service overseas, the 70th Regiment provided personnel for the 230th Battalion of les Voltigeurs Canadiens-Français. This unit of the Canadian expeditionary corps was formed almost entirely of members of the 70th Regiment recruited in the Outaouais. It is for this reason that Le Régiment de Hull perpetuates the memory of the 230th Battalion (Voltigeurs Canadiens-Français), CEF. After a stay in England, the 230th was assigned to the Forestry Corps in November 1916 and went to France. This decision was made due to the high number of forestry workers from Hull, Quebec. The city of Hull was a booming city living off the lumber industry and most of the men enlisted from the 70th Regiment worked for various forestry companies, like E.B. Eddy. Before the war, England imported an enormous quantity of wood every year. And while the war had generated even greater demand, the cargoes needed were increasingly scarce as a result of German submarine attacks. This scarcity delayed the dispatch of reinforcements, ammunition, rations, fodder and other essential items. Canadians not only responded to the call, they set new production records. Over 70% of all the wood used by the allied armies during World War I came from Canada's forests. According to the official Canadian history, the participation of the Canadian Forestry Corps was \\"remarkable and contributed to the defeat of the submarine campaign\\". =Between the wars= The Armistice enabled some 350,000 members of the Canadian Expeditionary Force to return home. Over 60,000 Canadians had died in battle. Thousands more were seriously wounded and many of them would never be able to resume normal life. The return to civilian life after so terrible a war is often difficult for veterans. Similarly, the resumption of activities by the Hull Militia was not without its problems. Since the government had decided no longer to designate units by a number, the 70th Regiment officially became \\"The Hull Regiment\\" in 1920, a designation which was changed to its French equivalent in Spring 1923. As was only to be expected after such a murderous war, enthusiasm waned significantly, a state of mind that was only exacerbated by equipment shortages and the need to meet in cramped, inadequate quarters. The regiment was housed at 84 Principale in Hull, moving to number 29 on the same street in 1922. Against all odds, the regiment grew and flourished and in 1938, the unit moved into its current headquarters: the Salaberry Armoury. =Second World War= Territorial Defense (1939–1942) When Canada declared war on Germany on 10 September 1939, the Regiment did not expect to be mobilized for war. Detachments of the Regiment were assigned to mount guard at points considered vulnerable to saboteurs, specifically Rockcliffe Aerodrome and the Residence of the Governor General. Many members of the Regiment enrolled in the active Army and initially served as instructors in numerous training camps, including in Saint Jérôme, Quebec and in Cornwall, Ontario. The first Battalion of Le Régiment de Hull was mobilized for active service on 29 July 1941. A few days later, National Defence Headquarters entrusted command of the Regiment to Lieutenant-Colonel Marcel Grison. In the meantime, an initial group of officers had been sent to Brockville to undergo special training and the Regiment left for Valcartier, where it underwent intensive training from December 1941 to mid-April 1942. It was subsequently sent to Nanaimo, British Columbia, where it participated in the defence of Canada as part of the 13th Infantry Brigade, 6th Canadian Infantry Division. This was the first time that a Francophone regiment had been stationed on Vancouver Island. Operation Cottage (August 1943 - January 1944) Invasion of Kiska In August 1943, Le Régiment de Hull took part in the invasion of the island of Kiska, in the Aleutians. The Regiment was at the time under the command of Lieutenant- Colonel Dollard Ménard, DSO, CD a hero of the Dieppe raid. The Japanese had invaded the Aleutians in June 1942. Although Kiska was 4,500 km from Vancouver, the enemy presence caused considerable concern in Canada and the United States. While the US Navy imposed a blockade, air raids were carried out. The blockade and the bombing nonetheless did not succeed in dislodging the enemy, and the Americans decided to attack the islands directly. On 12 May, US troops landed at Attu, resulting in one of the fiercest and most costly battles of the entire war. Of the 3,000 Japanese in the garrison, only 11 were taken prisoner; all the others were killed or committed suicide. Since Kiska was defended by a stronger garrison (some 5,400 soldiers), the Americans asked Canada for help. The 13th Brigade was chosen to participate in the invasion of Kiska, comprising, in addition to Le Régiment de Hull, the Canadian Fusiliers, the Winnipeg Grenadiers and the Rocky Mountain Rangers. \\"D\\" Day for Kiska was set for August 15, 1943. Since the enemy had secretly abandoned the island, Canadian troops were not called upon to fight. The Regiment nonetheless had to stay on the island until January 1944, during which time the soldiers were subjected to the worst weather conditions endured by the Canadian Army anywhere, throughout its entire history. Europe (1944–1946) After being repatriated in February 1944, the Regiment embarked at Halifax for the United Kingdom on 25 May 1944. Its new barracks were at Camp Gandale in Yorkshire. The soldiers were expecting to take part in the eagerly awaited invasion of occupied Europe. Shortly after its arrival, however, the Regiment was temporarily renamed the \\"4th Training Battalion\\" and assigned to training until their release on 18 September 1945. Many members of the 1st battalion of Le Régiment de Hull were nonetheless involved in fighting on the continent of Europe as reinforcements for other Canadian regiments, an honour for which some paid with their lives. During this time, a 2nd Battalion served in the Reserve Army. Members of the 2nd battalion contributed to the Army's recruiting efforts, guarded locations considered to be of strategic importance, took part in guarding prisoners of war and subscribed to numerous campaigns to sell Victory Bonds, in which they set records. =The postwar period & the Cold War (1946 - 1991)= Sherman tanks, the Regiment's new fighting vehicle After the Armistice, a new life began for the Regiment. It was at this time that Le Régiment de Hull changed corps, moving from the infantry to armour. This new calling was officially confirmed on 1 April 1946, when the Regiment's name officially became the 21st Armoured Regiment (Le Régiment de Hull). Twelve years later, on 19 May 1958, the Regiment adopted its current name: Le Régiment de Hull (RCAC). The Regiment should thenceforth have rallied around a cavalry guidon, but continued to serve under its old white regimental colours from infantry days, in the form of the flag it had received in 1924. During the years that followed the end of World War II, the Regiment took part in training exercises for a war in Europe against the Soviet Union. This was the start of the Cold War and relations between East and West were tense. It was against this background that, when Communist North Korea invaded South Korea, Canada agreed to send a contingent to serve as part of the UN Forces. More than 60 members of the Regiment volunteered to serve in the 25th Canadian Infantry Brigade. At almost the same time, the Regiment formed the \\"Y\\" Troop to reinforce the armoured squadron of the 27th Canadian Infantry Brigade in Europe. This Brigade, the first Canadian force sent overseas in peacetime, was stationed near Hanover, in the Federal Republic of Germany. Reconnaissance troop on exercise, 1976 In the late 1950s, the role of the Militia changed; this was the era of civil defence. The members of the Regiment took part in rescue exercises and emergency measures in the event of a nuclear war. The unit subsequently resumed its armoured training. With the reorganisation of the Canadian Army into the Canadian Forces, several units were put onto the Supplementary Order of Battle. The National Capital Region's armoured reconnaissance unit IV Princess Louise's Dragoon Guards was transferred to the Supplementary Order of Battle, along with many other units. To compensate for the closure of the reconnaissance unit the Regiment's heavy armour role was gradually modified to that of a light armoured formation. The unit was equipped with machine-gun mounted jeeps for the purpose. This is why, since 1974, the Regiment has acted as a reconnaissance unit in the Eastern Area, which has now become 2nd Canadian Division. In 1979, the Regiment won the Worthington Trophy for the best Militia armoured unit. This was the crowning achievement after a series of trophies won in various military competitions, including the prestigious Buchanan Trophy, which is awarded to the best Quebec unit. Reconnaissance patrol =Peacekeeping operations= Since 1948, Canada has taken part in many peacekeeping operations, either with the UN or other international organizations. Over 100,000 members of the Canadian Forces have served in these operations. As of January 1, 2000, 107 Canadian soldiers have died in the course of these missions. Canadian soldiers have developed an unusual degree of expertise and are now highly sought after for such missions. Members of Le Régiment de Hull are no exception to the rule: many of them have had an opportunity to participate in missions in Cyprus, Israel, Haiti and the former Yugoslavia. Members most recently served in the former Yugoslavia, Bosnia, Israel, Egypt, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Haiti. Alongside their colleagues in the Regular Force, the members of the Regiment in 1988 shared the honour of receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded to \\"blue helmets\\" throughout the world. Battle Honours Le Régiment de Hull was awarded its first battle honour on May 9, 2014, when it was announced that the regiment would receive the theatre honour AFGHANISTAN. The battle honour was presented to the unit on October 14, 2017 during a ceremony presided by the lieutenant governor of Quebec, J. Michel Doyon QC. Regimental Colours and the First Guidon Like most infantry unit, the Regiment followed the tradition of parading under the shadow of their Colours. In 1924, the Governor General, Baron Byng of Vimy, presented the unit with its Regimental Colours and Royal Colours, a gift from honorary Lieutenant-Colonel J.E. Gravelle. This impressive ceremony took place on the square in front of City Hall in Hull with thousands of onlookers. The Colours were all white and fringed in gold, bearing the regiment's badge in gold and silver thread, with the tower against a pale blue background. The Colours were unique in the Canadian military in that they were all white, as the unit had not yet spilled blood under its own banners. On October 16, 1982, the Colours were paraded for the last time and laid to rest, exposed to the public at la Maison du Citoyen, in Hull, Quebec. On that same day, the Governor General, the Right Honourable Edward Schreyer, presented the Regiment with its first Guidon. The new guidon is painstakingly embroidered on red damask and fringed in gold. The regiment's badge figures prominently and incorporates 2 rams, recalling the unit's service in the infantry, and 2 fleurs-de-lys, symbolizing its Francophone status.

This motto was used until 1923, when the unit's name was changed to Le Régiment de Hull. \\"On ne passe pas\\", French for \\"None shall pass\\" appears to have been inspired by the words of General Robert Nivelle at the Battle of Verdun in 1916. During a staff meeting, he spat \\"On ne passe pas!\\" when speaking of the German forces seeking to take Verdun. =Official Drink= The official drink of Le Régiment de Hull is Calvados. This traditions comes from members of the Regiment who returned from the war after serving as reinforcements to the Régiment de Maisonneuve, Régiment de la Chaudière and Le Fusiliers Mont-Royal during the Normandy Campaign of 1944. The drink was offered (and sometimes \\"liberated\\") to Canadian soldiers while passing through Normandy and the drink became popular with the troops. =March= The unit's official March is \\"La Marche de la Victoire\\" (French: The March of Victory). It was composed during the Second World War by Joseph Beaulieu, a musical composer with close ties to the Regiment's band at the time. The Regiment does not have a slow march. Trophies Worthington Trophy, 1979 Over the course of its history, the Régiment de Hull has won the following trophies: ; Worthington Trophy : Won in 1979. : First presented in 1954 by the first Commanding Officer of the Armoured Corps, MGen F.F. Worthington. The trophy is a scale model in silver of a Centurion tank. The trophy is awarded to the best Armoured Corps Militia unit. ; Nash Memorial Challenge Trophy : Won in 1988, 1989. : The Nash trophy was first awarded in 1939 by MGen Nash, MC, ADC. The trophy was initially awarded to the Armoured Corps Militia unit with the highest percentage of qualified mechanics in its ranks. Since 1980, the trophy has been awarded to the best reconnaissance troop in the Armoured Corps Militia units. ; Buchanan Trophy : Won in 1957, 1964, 1978, 1979, 1980. : Awarded for the first time in 1957 by LCol E.B.Q. Buchanan. This trophy is given to the best Militia armoured unit in Quebec and the Atlantic provinces. ; Colonel Ross Memorial Trophy : Won in 1975, 1976, 1977, 1981, 1984. : Awarded in honour of Colonel Ross in 1953. The trophy rewards the second best armoured unit in Quebec and the Atlantic provinces. Salaberry Armoury Salaberry Armoury As early as 1923, the Commanding Officer Lieutenant-Colonel Rodolphe Girard, had dreamed of a proper armoury. This was to be a lengthy undertaking requiring the devotion of successive Commanding Officers. Finally, thanks to the perseverance of Régiment de Hull Commanding Officers and to the combined efforts of the civilian, religious, political and military authorities of the day, the first subsidies for what was to become the Salaberry Armoury were voted by Parliament on 18 February 1937, in large measure due to the efforts of the MP for Hull, Alphonses Fournier, QC. The Salaberry Armoury stands at the intersection of Taché and Saint-Joseph Boulevards, on an enormous lot donated by Lieutenant-Colonel W. F. Hadley, VD, the Commanding Officer of Le Régiment de Hull from 1927 to 1931. Since then, almost half the land along Saint-Joseph Blvd has been converted into a park. The laying of the cornerstone and christening of the new armoury took place on July 21, 1938. The plans had been drawn by a local architect, Lucien Sarra-Bournet, presumably based upon the 2-year-old plans for the Seaforth Armoury. Six months later, on 28 January 1939, less than a year before the declaration of hostilities with the Third Reich, His Excellency Lord Tweedsmuir, presided over the official opening of Salaberry Armoury. Sixty years on, these two armouries remains some of Canada's most impressive military buildings. The Salaberry Armoury was named in honour of Colonel Charles Michel de Salaberry, celebrated as \\"the saviour of our country\\" following his victory at Châteauguay, one of the most important battles of the War of 1812.

Because it is situated between the 3rd and 6th of the Mississippi River's Chickasaw Bluffs, early settlers called it \\"The Point.\\" In 1818 the territory bounded by the Ohio River on the north, the Tennessee River on the east, and the Mississippi River on the west was purchased from the Indians. Andrew Jackson represented US government at the transaction and the new territory became known as The Jackson Purchase and what is now Western Tennessee and Western Kentucky. Much of the land now known as Frayser was given to a Mr. Hendron for his services in the North Carolina State Militia during the Revolutionary War. In 1822, Anderson B. Carr, Dr. Frank Rice and J.C. McLemore purchased here. One of the earliest settlers was a Mr. Cousins, who came from southern England just prior to the Civil War. He established his home in the area and, using slave labor, had many beautiful terraces carved out of the face of the hill behind the old Harvester Plant. Mr. Cousins opened one of the first country stores in the area on the Randolph Road off N. Second St. He also operated a cotton gin on the place. In 1858 Reverend Davidson, a circuit-riding Methodist minister, began a four church circuit through North Shelby County. He legally described his Frayser stop as “Under the giant Oak tree on Point Church Road,” which then was a path through farmland with thousands of Oak trees. Accounts of early services indicate much singing, shouting and praying in an interdenominational congregation. The old church cemetery located in the 3900 block of Overton Crossing has gravestones dated 1878. After several years of meetings outdoors, a small wood chapel was built. Called The Point Chapel, it was located near what is now the southwest corner of the Southwest Tennessee Community College Gill Center. In 1869, tracks of the Paducah & Memphis Railroad were laid from Memphis to Covington as part of the Chesapeake, Ohio & Southwestern Railroad. In 1873 a reporter described his trip to Covington by rail. He told of “wild looking, heavily timbered country” north of the Wolf River. He added, “there were a few highly cultivated farms with tasteful improvements but, what was usually seen from the train were little clearings as in some wild western country....not a single well worked field of corn or cotton was seen on either side.” The old C.O. & S tracks, which now go through a deep ravine cut by the I.C.R.R. once climbed a hill at “Gooseneck Bend” so steep that push engines were used to make the grade. =Frayser Station, est. 1877= On September 19, 1877 a Post Office was established on the Paducah & Memphis line. At that time The Point was very sparsely populated with a combination of small farms and summer estates owned by rich Memphians. Dr. J. R. Frayser, a prominent old Memphis physician, was one of many wealthy Memphians who invested in property along the new railroad to the north and built a summer home to use as a haven when fever epidemics struck Memphis. His land was at the intersection of roads leading to Big Creek (Millington Rd.) and Raleigh (Whitney-Dellwood), across from the small railroad depot that become known as Frayser Station. The arrival of the railroad through The Point brought immigration. An Italian vegetable farmer named Dallosta settled on The Point and began sponsored other farming immigrant families from his home in northern Italy. By 1900, Frayser Station had become a predominantly Italian community. In 1889, the C.O. & S. railroad line was purchased by the Illinois Central system. At that time the ICRR connected Chicago with Fulton, KY. The ICRR added lines going to New Orleans and changed its name to the I.C. Gulf R.R. For years the passenger train through Frayser was called the Fulton Accommodation. Frayser Station was not the depot on The Point. A railroad stop two miles (3 km) farther north was named for Squire Ben Felt, a prominent resident who helped form The Point Church, and a third was located at Overton, on the south side of the Loosahatchie River. Another community east of Frayser Station, above the Hindman Ferry, became a futuristic subdivision called Rugby Hills Estates. The area north of Rugby Hills was called Ardmore. With the automobile came the demise of passenger traffic on the railroad. The railroad depots were closed and over the years the station part of the name was dropped. Today, the entire western tip of what was The Point is simply known as Frayser. Frayser developed in the mid twentieth century as an industrial, working class suburb due to its proximity to the industrial area of Memphis, including a large International Harvester plant. =Annexation= On January 1, 1958 the City of Memphis annexed the community.\\"Residents hopeful that Frayser will rebound.\\" (Archive) The Commercial Appeal. Saturday December 6, 2003. Retrieved on June 3, 2013. \\"(The partly rural Zip Code 38127 ranges all the way up to Shelby Forest, but the majority of the population is concentrated in Frayser.)\\" Demographics Frayser has long been home to working class Americans. However, as factories in the area began to close, the population of Frayser began to markedly dwindle in the 1970s and 1980s, and it stands at 51,068 today. With a large majority of its residents earning incomes below the poverty line, only 6% holding college degrees, and a continued lack of business and industrial investment, the neighborhood is now one of the poorest and highest crime-rated areas of Memphis. Most of the population of the ZIP code 38127, which has some rural areas and extends to Shelby Forest, is concentrated in Frayser. Ethnicity statistics Black: 74.2% White: 23.9% Hispanic: 1.2% Source: Demographics Now, U.S. Census, 2000 Environment The neighborhood faces environmental problems because of industrial waste runoff and contamination at or near the sites of now abandoned factories, which has made some land in Frayser virtually uninhabitable without cleanup. Notable residents The community is home of multi-award winning songwriter Gary Harrison. Among his many hit songs is \\"Wrong Side of Memphis\\", a number one record for Trisha Yearwood. It is an autobiographical song about leaving Frayser for Nashville. Greg Cartwright of the Memphis-based bands The Oblivians, The Compulsive Gamblers and his current group, Reigning Sound was born and raised in Frayser. Cartwright is considered a garage rock legend and continues to perform sold-out shows across the world and release highly acclaimed records.[] Hip-hop artists such as Academy Award winning Frayser Boy, fellow Hypnotize Minds member Lil Wyte, Trigg Bambino, and Yo Gotti hail from the Frayser community. Dallas Cowboys free safety Ken Hamlin attended Frayser High School. CMA and ACM accredited Country Music Artist Duke Henry is a current resident of Frayser, Tennessee. Duke Henry's single \\"You Can't Stay Here\\" reached number 54 on the music row country charts in October of 2018. Duke has had several other songs make the Cashbox music charts since 2015 including \\"Red Dress\\", \\"I've got everything\\", and \\"Girl you get to me\\". Education Frayser was a part of the Memphis Board of Education until the Board of Education submitted their charter to return under the auspices of the Shelby County School District thus making Frayser and Memphis a part of the Shelby County School as the unified school district. On July 1, 2013 the district was zoned to Shelby County Schools. With the state changes in the education process, the Achievement School District was created and a number of school agencies sprouted in the Frayser Community including charter schools and a Montessori school. In February 2012 the Achievement School District announced that it planned to take over management of Corning Elementary School, Frayser Elementary School, and Westside Middle school in Frayser.\\"3 Low-Performing Frayser Schools Being Taken Over.\\" (Archive) Associated Press at LocalMemphis.com.

Founded in 1988, the studio is based in Watsonville, California, and broadcasts to the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey. It also has a radio repeater on 94.9 MHz FM in San Luis Obispo County as KPYG (since 2004). The station's logo, designed by John F. Johnson, features a sunglasses-wearing pig in farmer's clothing and a cowboy hat, as well as its branding, website and city of license. It has been owned by Stephens Media since October 2019. History The station signed on in 1987 as KPIG (without the -FM suffix). The suffix would be added in 2005. KPIG is among the first radio stations in the world to webcast their program, going online on August 2, 1995 during Cousin Al's show. Frequently song requests are submitted via e-mail from listeners around the globe. Indirect references to KPIG appear in the songs \\"I'm Coming Home\\" by Robert Earl Keen and \\"Beer Run\\" (which references the Robert Keen song) by Todd Snider, both of whom are frequently featured on the air and perform at KPIG's events. In 2001 the station was bought by Mapleton Communications. In March 2010, KPIG placed its audio stream behind a paywall. On October 1, 2012, KPIG launched an ad-free \\"KPIG Online Radio\\" app in the Apple App Store. A monthly subscription purchased through the official website is required for streaming. In 2015, Mapleton sold repeater KPYG to Dimes Media. Mapleton continued operating it after the sale closed. On July 1, 2019, Mapleton announced its intent to sell its remaining 37 radio stations to Stephens Media.\\"Stephens Media Group Acquires 37 Stations From Mapleton Communications\\" from Radio Insight (July 1, 2019) Stephens began operating the station that same day. The sale was approved on October 9, 2019, and was consummated on October 15, 2019. The station has continued its longtime format after the closure of the acquisition, although the fate of KPYG is still being determined. Programs KPIG operates a loosely defined progressive full service format encompassing folk, blues, rock, and Americana. As the station's license city is (appropriately) Freedom, California, it has a freeform presentation, with disc jockeys given authority to choose their own playlists. KPIG has strong community ties featuring local programming, sponsors, news and commentary. KPIG also operates the Hog Call line, a free community call-in line for leaving recorded announcements that will be played on the air. Much like newspaper classifieds, common \\"Hog Calls\\" are regarding items for sale or upcoming community events. Among its most well known programs are \\"Sunday Night Dead\\" with Grateful Don Potter, \\"Uncle Sherman's Dirty Boogie\\" on Saturday nights, \\"Please Stand By\\" the in-studio live music show, on Sunday mornings. \\"Please Stand By\\", hosted by Sleepy John Sandidge, features local and world-famous Country, Folk, and Blues acts. The station also hosts several popular music festivals each year including the Humbug Hoedown in December, and is the radio volunteer for the free music festival each October in Golden Gate Park called Hardly Strictly Bluegrass. In 2019, Choo Choo Charlie, formerly known as Daylight Charlie from the Cousin Al's Bluegrass Show, returned to KPIG radio hosting the Alternative Roots Bluegrass and Beyond Show. Connection to KFAT KPIG's predecessor was KFAT, broadcasting out of Gilroy, California from 1975 to 1983, at which time it became KBAY. Much of KPIG's founding staff and current on-air personalities worked at KFAT. KFAT specialized in true Country and Folk as well as many off-beat oddities. Archived tapes of broadcasts are still streamed from *this archiving website and some history and memories are available at the *KFAT.com website Related information Program Director, Laura Ellen Hopper (April 29, 1950 – May 28, 2007), who had helped found KFAT in 1975, had produced a side-project webcast, the Cowboy Cultural Society web site and streamhttp://www.cowboyculturalsociety.com/ that plays contemporary and classic Cowboy music. Former morning disc jockey Dallas Dobro is also the regular mainstage Master of Ceremonies at the twice-annual Strawberry Music Festival in Camp Mather, Yosemite, California. Dobro left the station in 2006 and now resides and works in radio in Petaluma, California. \\"Wild\\" Bill Goldsmith, KPIG's former webmaster, and the person who first put its program on the web, founded Radio Paradise, a webcast of \\"Eclectic Online Rock\\". John F. Johnson (Oct. 7, 1944 - Jan. 23, 2017) of Teapot Graphics (Santa Cruz, CA) designed the logo in 1990. The logo is used on the ubiquitous bumper sticker and it, along with other artwork has created a look-and-feel for the station. Over KPIG's first 25 years John designed advertising and merchandise including t-shirts, calendars, CD packages and posters which are very popular with the listeners. National syndication Effective December 31, 2007, radio format syndication firm Dial Global offers KPIG's programming to other stations across the United States via satellite distribution. KPIG's programming is offered to stations as either a primary format, or via a station's HD Radio subchannel.http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/tvstations/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003677634 The format makes KPIG one of only three terrestrial based radio superstations in the United States (WBBR, a business-talk radio network and 660, The Fan, a Sports station, both in New York City, being the others).

It is a common problem in present-day society and one that many people strive to solve. It is often the consequence of factors extending beyond an individual's control. Social issues are the source of a conflicting opinion on the grounds of what is perceived as morally correct or incorrect personal life or interpersonal social life decisions. Social issues are distinguished from economic issues; however, some issues (such as immigration) have both social and economic aspects. There are also issues that do not fall into either category, such as warfare. There can be disagreements about what social issues are worth solving, or which should take precedence. Different individuals and different societies have different perceptions. In Rights of Man and Common Sense, Thomas Paine addresses the individual's duty to \\"allow the same rights to others as we allow ourselves.\\" The failure to do so causes the creation of a social issue. There are a variety of methods people use to combat social issues. Some people vote for leaders in a democracy to advance their ideals. Outside the political process, people donate or share their time, money, energy, or other resources. This often takes the form of volunteering. Nonprofit organizations are often formed for the sole purpose of solving a social issue. Community organizing involves gathering people together for a common purpose. A distinct but related meaning of the term \\"social issue\\" (used particularly in the United States) refers to topics of national political interest, over which the public is deeply divided and which are the subject of intense partisan advocacy, debate, and voting. In this case \\"social issue\\" does not necessarily refer to an ill to be solved, but rather a topic to be discussed.  Personal issues  Personal issues are those that individuals deal with themselves and within a small range of their peers and relationships. On the other hand, social issues involve values cherished by widespread society. For example, a high unemployment rate that affects millions of people is a social issue. The line between a personal issue and a public issue may be subjective and depends on how groups are defined. However, when a large enough sector of society is affected by an issue, it becomes a social issue. Returning to the unemployment issue, while one person losing their job is a personal and not a social issue, 18 million people losing their job is likely to generate a variety of social issues. Valence issues versus position issues A valence issue is a social problem that people uniformly interpret the same way. These types of issues generally generate a widespread consensus and provoke little resistance from the public. An example of a valence issue is child abuse , which is condemned across several societies to a large enough degree that some social scientists might speak of them as though they are universal, for the sake of illustration. By contrast, a position issue is a social problem in which the popular opinion among society is divided. Different people may hold different and strongly-held views, which are not easily changed. An example of a position issue is abortion, which, in some countries, has not generated a widespread consensus from the public. Types Generic types of social issues, along with examples of each, are as follows: =Social stratification= Social stratification was a kind of social differentiation whereby members of society are grouped into socioeconomic strata, based upon their occupation and income, wealth and social status, or derived power (social and political). As such, stratification is the relative social position of persons within a social group, category, geographic region, or social unit. In modern Western societies, social stratification is typically defined in terms of three social classes: (i) the upper class, (ii) the middle class, and (iii) the lower class. In turn, each class can be subdivided into strata (e.g. the upper- stratum, the middle-stratum, and the lower stratum).[1] Moreover, a social stratum can be formed upon the bases of kinship, clan, tribe, caste, or all four. The categorization of people by social strata occurs in all societies, ranging from complex, state-based, or polycentric societies to tribal and feudal societies, which are based upon sociel-economic relations among classes of nobility and classes of peasants. Historically, whether or not hunter- gatherer societies can be defined as socially stratified or if social stratification began with agriculture and common acts of social exchange, remains a debated matter in the social sciences.[2] Determining the structures of social stratification arises from inequalities of status among persons; therefore, the degree of social inequality determines a person's social stratum. Generally, the greater the social complexity of a society, the more social strata exist, by way of social differentiation.[3 =Economic issues= Unemployment rates vary by region, gender, educational attainment, and ethnic group. In most countries (including developed countries), many people are poor and depend on welfare. In 2007 in Germany, one in six children . That is up from only one in seventy-five in 1965. War also plays an important role in disturbing the economic status of a country by using money that was intended for welfare.Report des Kinderhilfswerkes: Jedes sechste Kind lebt in Armut =Social disorganization= So-called \\"problem neighbourhoods\\" exist in many countries. These neighbourhoods tend to have a high drop-out rate from secondary school, and children growing up in these neighbourhoods have a low probability of going to college compared to children who grow up in other neighbourhoods. Abuse of alcohol and drugs is common in these neighbourhoods. Often these neighbourhoods were founded out of best intentions.Wolfgang Uchatius: \\"Armut in Deutschland - Die neue Unterschicht\\". Die Zeit. 10 March 2005 =Public health= Widespread health conditions (often characterized as epidemics or pandemics) are of concern to society as a whole. They can harm quality of life, the ability of people to contribute to society (e.g. by working), and most problematically result in death. Infectious diseases are often public health concerns because they can spread quickly and easily, affecting large numbers of people. The World Health Organization has an acute interest in combating infectious disease outbreaks by minimizing their geographic and numerical spread and treating the affected. Other conditions for which there is not yet a cure or even effective treatment, such as dementia, can be viewed as public health concerns in the long run. =Age and the life course= Throughout the life course, there are social problems associated with different ages. One such social problem is age discrimination. An example of age discrimination is when a particular person is not allowed to do something or is treated differently based on age. =Social inequality= Social inequality is \\"the state or quality of being unequal\\". Inequality is the root of a number of social problems that occur when factors such as gender, disability, race, and age may affect the way a person is treated. A past example of inequality as a social problem is slavery in the United States. Africans brought to America were often enslaved and mistreated, and they did not share the same rights as the white population of America (for example, they were not allowed to vote). A number of civil rights movements have attempted to, and often succeeded at, advancing equality and extending rights to previously marginalized groups. These include the women's rights movement (beginning around the 1920s), the civil rights movement in the United States for African-American equality (beginning around the 1950s), and the LGBT rights movement beginning around the 1960s. =Education and public schools= Education is unarguably the most important factor in a person's success in society. As a result, social problems can be raised by the unequal distribution of funding between public schools, such as that seen in the United States. The weak organizational policy in the place and the lack of communication between public schools and the federal government have led to major effects on the future generation. Public schools that do not receive high standardized test scores are not being sufficiently funded and as a result, their students are not receiving what should be the maximum level of education. =Work and occupations= Social problems in the workplace include occupational stress, theft, sexual harassment, wage inequality, gender inequality, racial inequality, health care disparities, and many more. In addition, common workplace issues that employees face include interpersonal conflict, communication problems (e.g. gossip), bullying, harassment, discrimination, low motivation and job satisfaction, and performance issues. = Environmental racism = Environmental racism exists when a particular place or town is subject to problematic environmental practices due to the racial and class components of that space. In general, the place or town is inhabited by lower income and minority groups. Often, there is more pollution, factories, dumping, etc. that produce environmental hazards and health risks which are not seen in more affluent cities, such as those in Bangladesh. = Abortion = The abortion debate is the ongoing controversy surrounding the moral, legal, and religious status of induced abortion.[9] The sides which are involved in the debate are the self-described \\"pro-choice\\" and \\"pro-life\\" movements. \\"Pro-choice\\" emphasizes the right of a woman to decide whether or not to terminate a pregnancy. \\"Pro-life\\" emphasizes the right of the embryo or fetus to gestate to term and be born. Both terms are considered loaded by the mainstream media.[10] Each movement has, with varying results, sought to influence public opinion and attain legal support for its position. If abortion is done intentionally then it is called induced abortion. In this type of abortion, pregnancy is unwanted or presents a risk to a women’s health. There exist two schools of thought when it comes to talking about abortion. It is supported by one group as an option to avoid an increasing population. The second group considers it as a social evil. Because it kills a human. Both groups support their views by giving different arguments. To some extent, these arguments are correct for both parties. Because every coin has two ends. We cannot answer by looking at one side of the coin. If we really want answers then we need to look at both ends. For many people, abortion is essentially a moral issue, concerning the commencement of human personhood, the rights of the fetus, and a woman's right to control her own body. The debate has become a political and legal issue in some countries with pro-life campaigners seeking to enact, maintain and expand anti-abortion laws, while abortion-rights campaigners seek to repeal or ease such laws and expand women's access to abortion. Abortion laws vary considerably between jurisdictions, ranging from outright prohibition of the procedure to public funding of abortion. Issues in other countries =Canada= Poverty The face of Canadian poverty is described as racialized, destitute, and young. It is common among whites, aboriginal communities, and racial minorities. Additionally, racial minorities face both unemployment and underemployment compared to their counterparts. On reserves, poverty due to multiple factors has an exponential function. For instance, the sense of cultural isolation normally results from a deterioration of economic, social, and health conditions compared to those living off reserves. Poverty in Canada has a self-perpetuating system, where the societal mechanisms ensure that the poorest Canadians remain poor. Urban poverty is showcased through a lack of low-income housing for individuals and families, and increasing homelessness. Racism and prejudice Racism has a strong undercurrent in Canadian society. However, it is not visible and openly identified. The current prevalent forms are structural racism (e.g. the Henry and Elfie Ginzberg experiment), individualized racism (e.g. racial profiling by police that is broadly defined by the Ontario Human Rights Commission), and internalized racism (e.g. first generation immigrants and refugees).Moreau, S., Rousseau, C., Mekki-Berrada, A., TCMR & ÉRASME. (1999). Politiques d'immigration et santé mentale des réfugiés: profil et impact des séparations familiales, Nouvelles Pratiques Sociales, 11(2) – 12(1), 177-196. Social distance between whites and non-whites is a distinct aspect of the Canadian community that is identified through the isolation index. The anti-racism movement in Canada has borne aversive racism. Aging and discrimination It is estimated that by 2030, seniors will make about 23% of the Canadian population. This shrinks the labour force and real GDP growth rate, which may result in higher taxes. Additionally Canada's fertility rate has been falling since 2009, especially in white families. Immigrants with dependents is also not a conducive element for reducing the impact; however, they can increase the population rate of rural areas to increase financial activities. It is studied that Canadians openly practice ageism. This discrimination based on age results in refusing jobs to qualified and willing candidates, while such negative attitudes are further legitimized by mass media. Filial responsibility is also an alien concept in the North American culture due to the prominence of individualism, except within indigenous communities. Those that attempt to upheld do not know how to perform (due to lack of precedence) and to a larger extent it might result in elder abuse. Public Health Agency of Canada reports that about 4 - 10% of seniors are facing elder abuse in Canada. This is both a cultural and historical phenomenon that contests against basis of social beings able to satisfy needs of other people through companionship and social integration. It could be further seen in the failure of Canadian social institutions to meet the needs of the dependent aged within systematic approach (e.g. trend of elder care increasingly considered as a private matter rather than a public one and political leniency to \\"non-system\\" for elder care, as in the United States) and representation (e.g. non-representation of the stigmatized's oppressed voice to shape social institutions in ways that meet their needs). However, organizations like \\"Canada's Association for the Fifty-Plus\\" actively lobbies for reforming social policies. =United States= A number of social issues have been prominent in the history of the United States. Many of them have waxed or waned over time as conditions and values have changed. The term \\"social issue\\" has a broad meaning in the United States, as it refers not only to ills to be solved but also to any topic of widespread debate, involving deeply-held values and beliefs. The Library of Congress has an established index of social causes in the United States. Examples include academic cheating, church-state separation, hacking, evolution education, gangs, hate speech, suicide, urban sprawl, and unions. Social issues gain a particularly high-profile when a new president is elected. Elections are often impacted by several social issues, with many social issues discussed during debates, such as rights for abortion, LGBT people, and gun control. Crime and the justice system In the United States, the federal prison system has been unable to keep up with the steady increase of inmates over the past few years, causing major overcrowding. In the year 2012, the overcrowding level was 41 percent above \\"rated capacity\\" and was the highest level since 2004. In addition to being overcrowded, the federal prison system in the U.S. has also been at the center of controversy with regard to the conditions in which prisoners are forced to live. Hate crimes Hate crimes are a social problem in the United States because they directly marginalize and target specific groups of people or specific communities based on their identities. Hate crimes can be committed as the result of hate-motivated behavior, prejudice, and intolerance due to sexual orientation, gender expression, biological sex, ethnicity, race, religion, disability, or any other identity.National Crime Prevention Council Hate crimes are a growing issue especially in school settings because of the young populations that exist. The majority of victims and perpetrators are teenagers and young adults (the population that exists within educational institutions). Hate crimes can result in physical or sexual assault or harassment, verbal harassment, robbery, and death.Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN) Advertising junk food to children The food industry has been criticized for promoting childhood obesity and ill-health by specifically targeting the child demographic in the marketing of unhealthy food products. The food products marketed often are deemed unhealthy due to their high calorie, fat, and sugar contents.Barnes, B. (2007). Limiting ads of junk food to children. The New York Times, 2. Some common methods of junk food advertising include: *Television commercial campaigns that feature celebrities *Print media campaigns *Billboard campaigns *Event sponsorship, including sporting events *Product placement in films and television programs *Various forms of branding, including clothing *Direction signs and posters, telling people how far a fast food restaurant is In 2005, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies (IOM) released a report requested by Congress that evaluated the influence and nature of food and beverage marketing practices on American children and adolescents. \\"The report concluded that food and beverage marketing influences the diets and health of children and adolescents; current marketing practices create an environment that puts young people's health at risk; companies and marketers have underutilized their resources and creativity to market a healthful diet; industry leadership and sustained, multisectoral, and integrated efforts are required; and that current public policy institutions lacked the authority to address emerging marketing practices that influence young people's diets.\\"Kraak, Vivica I., Mary Story, and Ellen A. Wartella, \\"Government and School Progress to Promote a Healthful Diet to American Children and Adolescents: A Comprehensive Review of the Available Evidence.\\" American Journal of Preventive Medicine 42:3, (Mar. 2012). 250-262. According to Christian and the PHA website, the obesity epidemic in children and adolescents in the U.S. reflects changes in society. The article suggests unhealthy eating choices are due to an increase of sedentary activity (e.g. children watching too much television and playing computer games) and the influence of the media in causing children to eat unhealthy food choices.\\"Targeting the Obesity Epidemic in Children and adolescents: Research Evidence for Practice.\\" Journal of Pediatric Nursing 26.5 (Oct. 2011), 503-506. Print According to some opponents, if governments took action to prevent the marketing of unhealthy food products, then they would significantly reduce the prevalence of obesity and its serious health consequences. Examples of such consequences include cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and diabetic ketoacidosis, which is genetic and incureable. As part of the IOM food marketing report, ten recommendations were made to both the public and private sectors. One of the recommendations was that the government is working with the private sector to \\"create a long-term, multifaceted, and financially sustained social marketing program to support parents, caregivers, and families to promote a healthful diet.\\" First lady Michelle Obama and Partnership for a Healthier America have proposed new rules that would limit junk food marketing in public schools. Obesity Obesity is a prevalent social problem in today's society, with rates steadily increasing. According to the Weight Control Information Network, since the early 1960s, the prevalence of obesity among adults more than doubled, increasing from 13.4 to 35.7 percent in U.S. adults aged 20 and older. Today, two in three adults are considered overweight or obese, and one in six children aged 6–19 are considered obese. Hunger Hunger is a social issue. Media propaganda Mass media may use propaganda as a means to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view, or to maintain the viewer's attention. Who owns a media outlet often determines things such as the types of social problems that are presented, how long the problems are aired, and how dramatically the problems are presented. The American media is often biased towards one or the other end of the political spectrum, with many media outlets having been accused of either being too conservative or too liberal. Alcohol and other drugs Drugs are at times the cause of social problems. Drugs such as cocaine and opiates are addictive for some users. A minority of users of such drugs may commit crimes in order to obtain more drugs. In some individuals, drugs such as methamphetamine have been known to contribute to violent behavior, which would be considered a social problem. Drunk driving is on the rise and is the number two cause of accidental deaths, causing approximately 17,000 deaths each year. All but nine states in the United States have adopted the Administrative License Revocation (ALR). The ALR is enforced when a person is caught drinking and driving and found guilty, resulting in the loss of their license for a full year. This is a step that is being taken in order to try to avoid the occurrence of this social problem. Legal marijuana is a debatable topic. Marijuana can be used in the medical domain, and there is no accurate fact that shows marijuana kills. However, people believe marijuana is a gateway to other drugs, injures lungs, and inhibits function.

India is becoming less corrupt. CNN-IBN. 26 September 2007. In India, corruption takes the form of bribes, tax evasion, exchange controls, embezzlement, etc. A 2005 study done by Transparency International (TI) India found that more than 50% had firsthand experience of paying bribe or peddling influence to complete a task in a public office. The chief economic consequences of corruption are the loss to the exchequer and an increase in the cost of government-subsidised services, the unhealthy climate for investment, political instability, and unprincipled ethics . The TI India study estimates the monetary value of petty corruption in eleven basic services provided by the government, such as education, healthcare, judiciary, police, etc., to be approximately Rs.21,068 crores.Centre for Media Studies (2005), India Corruption Study 2005: To Improve Governance Volume – I: Key Highlights, Transparency International India. India still ranks in the bottom quartile of developing nations in terms of the ease of doing business, and compared to China and other lower developed Asian nations, the average time taken to secure the clearances for a startup or to invoke bankruptcy is much greater. Recently, a revelation of tax evasion (Panama Papers' Leak) case involving several high-profile celebrities and businessmen has increased the number of corruption charges against the elite of the country.  Social structure  India is a multicultural country with differing social identities formed from varying cultural norms, religio-politics, linguistic differences, tolerance to changes in economic orientation, barriers to qualitative education, and mismanagement of resources. Indian cultural identity is one of the lesser resistant ones to changes, as it is seen in the rapid consuming progress of technology and its byproducts of giant conglomerates. Businesses and marketing firms report that ideological change happens faster in India than the preferential inclinations. The religio- politics of the country is a transforming factor across the nation. In a multi-religious country such as India, the spread of questionable actions under mono-religious political movement draws the country to the Middle Ages. Despite this, the defining characteristic of India's social structure is its ability to uncritically intake cultural derivatives of other countries and weave it into its own idiosyncratic structure with the goal of modernization. The lack of fitness of these derivatives and the debilitative social template that this evolves on causes adjustment problems that reflects on the overall social well-being of its citizens. Poverty The World Bank in 2011, based on 2005's PPPs International Comparison Program,World Bank’s $1.25/day poverty measure- countering the latest criticisms The World Bank (2010) estimated 23.6% of the Indian population, or about 276 million people, lived below $1.25 per day on purchasing power parity.Note: 24.6% rate is based on 2005 PPP at $1.25 per day, International dollar basis, Chandy and Kharas, What Do New Price Data Mean for the Goal of Ending Extreme Poverty? Brookings Institution, Washington D.C. (May 2014) According to the United Nation's Millennium Development Goal (MDG) programme, 270 million out of 1.2 billion Indians, or 21.9% of the population, lived below the poverty line of $1.25 between 2011 and 2012 (as compared to 41.6% between 2004 and 2005).  Terrorism  The regions with long term terrorist activities today are Jammu and Kashmir (state-sponsored terrorism), Central India (Naxalism), and Seven Sister States (independence and autonomy movements). In the past, the Punjab insurgency led to militant activities in the Indian state of Punjab as well as the national capital of Delhi (e.g. Delhi serial blasts and anti-Sikh riots). As of 2006, at least 232 of the country's 606 districts were afflicted, at varying intensities, by several insurgent and terrorist movements. =Germany=  Poverty  Unemployment rates vary by region, gender, educational attainment, and ethnic group. A growing number of Germans are poor and dependent on welfare. In 2007, one in six children depended on welfare. That is up from only one in seventy-five in 1965. Poverty rates vary in different states. For instance, only 3.9% suffer from poverty in Bavaria, while 15.2% of Berlin's inhabitants are poor. Families that are headed by a single parent and working-class families with multiple children are most likely to be poor. Housing project in Bremen-Vahr in the 1960s, back then most tenants living in housing-projects were two parent families with at least one parent working. In many housing projects the composition of tenants has changed since then and now many tenant-families are headed by a single female or an unemployed male There is a discussion going on about hunger in Germany. Reverend Bernd Siggelkow, founder of the Berlin-based soup kitchen \\"Die Arche,\\" claimed that a number of German children go hungry each day. He blamed the lack of jobs, low welfare payments, and parents who were drug-addicted or mentally ill.Bernd Siggelkow, Wolfgang Büscher: Deutschlands vergessene Kinder - Hoffnungsgeschichten aus der Arche. Gerth Medien Siggelkow has been criticized by a number of people who said there was no hunger in Germany. SPD politician and board member of the German central bank, Thilo Sarrazin, said it was possible to live on welfare without going hungry if one did not buy fast food and cooked from scratch instead. He was criticized by The Left politician, Heidi Knake-Werner, who said it was not right \\"if well paid people like us make recommendations to poor people about how they should shop.\\" Birth rate Germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the world. In 2012, its national fertility rate was 1.41 children per woman. This is up slightly from the 2002 rate of 1.31, but it is still well below the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman. (By contrast, the United States had a fertility rate of 2.06 in 2012). Despite the nation's low birth rate, Germans are living longer, with 2012 estimates showcasing a life expectancy of 80.19 years (77.93 years for men and 82.58 years for women). This demographic shift is already straining the country's social welfare structures and will produce further economic and social problems in the future. The Mikrozensus done in 2008 revealed that the number of children a German woman aged 40 to 75 had was closely linked to her educational achievement.Statistisches Bundesamt. Mikrozensus 2008. Neue Daten zur Kinderlosigkeit in Deutschland. p. 27ff Deprived neighbourhoods So called problem neighbourhoods (\\"Problemviertel\\") exist in Germany. These neighbourhoods have a high drop-out rate from secondary school. Children growing up in these neighbourhoods have only 1/7th the probability of going to college compared to a person growing up in another neighbourhood. Abuse of alcohol and drugs is common. Many people living in problem neighbourhoods are what is called a-people. They are poor (\\"arm\\"), out-of-work (\\"arbeitslos\\"), and immigrants (\\"Ausländer\\"). Often these neighbourhoods were founded out of good intentions. Many districts that later became problem neighbourhoods were founded in the 1960s and 1970s when the State wanted to provide better housing for poorer persons. As a result, big tenement buildings were built. The first tenants were mostly two-parent- families, with at least one parent working. Many were happy with their neighbourhoods, but when the unemployment rate started increasing, more and more people lost their jobs. Moreover, families who could afford it started moving into better districts and only those who could not afford to move stayed in districts such as Hamburg-Mümmelmannsberg.)  Political extremism, racism and antisemitism Since World War II, Germany has experienced intermittent turmoil from various groups. In the 1970s, radical leftist terrorist organisations, such as the Red Army Faction, engaged in a string of assassinations and kidnappings against political and business figures. Germany has also continued to struggle with far-right violence. Neo- Nazis are presently on the rise (this is in line with the younger generation of Germans growing older). There is some debate as to whether hate crime is actually rising, or whether simply more arrests have been made due to increased law-enforcement efforts. The number of officially recognized violent hate crimes has risen from 759 in 2003 to 776 in 2005. According to a recent study, a majority of Jews living in Germany are worried about a rise in antisemitism. The concern of Jews in Germany was less than those in France, where 90% of Jews that were polled said that antisemitism has risen over the years. Some have suggested that the increase in hate crime is related to the proliferation of right-wing parties, such as the National Democratic Party (NPD) in local elections.(site down) =France= Precarity and poverty There is fragility of income and social position in France, with several ways to measure this. One example is to look at unemployment. Within the European Union in May 2017, France was ranked 6th with its unemployment rate of 9.4 percent, as found by Statista. According to Observatoire des inégalités, France has between 5 and 8.9 million poor people, depending on the definition of poverty (this definition ranges from the poverty line at 50 percent of the median standard of living to 60 percent). Gender inequality Women suffer from economical and social semiotics in France. They are paid, on average, 6.8 percent less than men, according to l'insee. Women in France also face sexual harassment and other problems. These are some reasons why the Global Gender Gap report of 2016 has ranked France 17th with a score of 0.755 (on this ranking scale, reaching 1 means gender equality). Other issues Other issues include education, lack of literacy and numeracy, school truancy, violence and bullying in schools, religious intolerance, immigration, political and religious extremism, discrimination of all sorts, the role of women, aging populations, gender issues, unplanned parenthood, teenage pregnancy and child labour.

History Full lips with an accentuated border have often been associated with beauty and youth. Tribal peoples worldwide have introduced various materials into and through the upper and lower lips of all genders to enhance beauty. The perceived ideal size of lips has varied over time and in different cultures. Around 1900, surgeons tried injecting paraffin into the lips without success. Liquid silicone was used for lip augmentation, starting in the early 1960s but was abandoned thirty years later due to fears about the effects of silicone on general health and long term aesthetic outcome. About 1980, injectable bovine collagen was introduced to the cosmetic surgery market and became the standard against which other injectable fillers were measured. However, that collagen does not last very long and requires an allergy test, causing the patient to wait at least three weeks before another appointment, after which more waiting is required to see cosmetic results. Currently, fillers containing hyaluronic acid like Restylane and Juvederm have captured the attention of consumers and physicians around the world. The trend of lip augmentation has been incredibly boosted by Kylie Jenner's transformation over the years and her trendy challenge among teenagers consists of using a shot glass to try to plump up their lips for social media attention. Aesthetics The aim of lip augmentation is to provide an aesthetic, symmetric, and healthy appearance for the patient. Naturally, the face is not perfectly symmetric, and if the asymmetry is too big - with lip augmentation, the asymmetry can be corrected. The lips are becoming thinner with time, therefore full lips are the sign of youth. The ideal upper / lower lip ratio is around 1:1.6 , and this ratio is also achievable by lip augmentation. Materials and techniques In the late 1990s, with the huge popularity of surgical rejuvenation and concomitant increase of cosmetic surgery procedures worldwide, more substances, along with biocompatible materials commonly used in other medical applications for years, became available to surgeons for use in augmenting thinning or misshapen lips into more plump and attractive features. Some of the first widely used lip augmentation substances were: *Autologen, an injectable dermal material made from the patient's own skin. No risk of allergy exists but the results are very temporary because the body quickly absorbs the material. *Collagen requires an allergy test because the material is extracted from bovine hides. It lasts anywhere from four weeks to three months because it is also absorbed into the body. However, the allergy test must be observed for four weeks. *Dermalogen is taken from the patient's skin—and through a laboratory process—made into a high concentration collagen that can be injected into the lips. Some studies indicate it lasts somewhat longer than collagen. *Alloderm is donor tissue taken from cadavers and then denatured, purified and treated to remove viable cells that could pass along disease. Under a local anesthesia, Alloderm is placed into the mucosa, or body, of the lips in small rolls to make them larger. Alloderm can also be placed into the vermilion, the pink area of the lip, to provide definition and a sharper border. *Radiance, a synthetic, laboratory produced solution containing calcium hydroxylapatite (bone) suspended in a gel that has been safely used in medicine for years. Some studies indicate Radiance can last between three and five years. One researcher (Tzikas) found in a study of Radiance on 90 patients that 59 percent felt when injected, moderate to severe pain which disappeared two to five minutes later. But the substance produced results for an average of two years with a few patients reporting the plumping effects being sustained as long as three to five years. Of the 90 patients, four required surgical intervention due to nodules in the lips.Tzikas, T. L. Evaluation of the Radiance FN Soft Tissue Filler for Facial Soft Tissue Augmentation. Arch Facial Plast Surg. 2004; 6:234-239 *Gore-Tex implants. In medical uses, Gore-Tex is known as EPTFE, or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and, commercially as Advanta, UltraSoft, and SoftForm. The EPTFE is delivered to surgeons in strips that are 1/16 inch (2.4 mm) and 3/16 (3.4 mm) diameter tubes.Fezza JP.Advanta implants, Facial Plast Surgy, 2004 May;20(2):185-9 Current popular procedures Since 2000, more products and techniques have been developed to make lip augmentation more effective and patient friendly. The relative ease of many injections is due to surgeons using tiny 30 and 31 gauge (about as thick as a dozen human hairs) needles that are used to inject the very sensitive lips. Nonetheless, topical anesthesias are often used for lip augmentation procedures. Some of these new techniques and substances include. *Fat transfer. Surgeons harvest through liposuction or excision the patient's fat from places on the body where it can be spared and either injected or surgically placed into the lips. Surgical applications usually require general anesthesia. *Restylane, a non-animal, clear gel that is reported to be very close to the hyaluronic acid found naturally in the body. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, there were 778,000 cases of Restylane injection in 2006, the most recent year for which statistics are available. BLACK LISTED The substance usually lasts six months and, sometimes, longer. While Juvederm is extremely chemically close to Restylane; many surgeons report the former is slightly smoother to inject. Juvederm contains 35 percent more cross-linked hyaluronic acid than Restylane , therefore it is claimed to be longer lasting (up to 1 or 1.5 year). *Artecoll. Both Artecoll and ArteFill are not used to inject the body of the lips because the substance is heavy and would show as white through the thin skin of the lips. Additionally, both products contain tiny microspheres known as PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) which remain in the face permanently. In cases where Artecoll has been used around the edges of the lips to remove fine lines and wrinkles, some patients have reported annoying nodules or small lumps. In a few cases, surgery was required to remove the Artecoll.Blanchard, M. Filler material may cause nodules, lumps in lips. Cosmetic Surgery Times, 15 June, Issue, 2002 Non-surgical alternatives *Lip plumper is a cosmetic product used to make lips appear fuller. These products work by irritating the skin of the lips with ingredients such as Capsaicin. This makes the lips swell slightly, temporarily creating the appearance of fuller lips. *Suction pumps, a special device for lips uses vacuum pumping to increase blood pressure in each lip and to pull them out a bit, making it quite an instrument to adjust proper lip length/value in a slow determinite step-by-step way. Risks and side effects Several studies have found fat grafting of the lip to be one of the best methods of maintaining a semi-permanent fuller and softer lip.Niechajev, Igor. Lip enhancement: surgical Alternatives and Histologic Aspects. Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery. 105(3):1173-1183, March 2000 When the lips are overfilled, the results can be comic, often supplying fodder to tabloid newspapers and offbeat websites. This look is sometimes mockingly called a 'trout pout.' Overaggressive injections can lead to lumpiness while too little can result in ridges. Common reactions can range from redness, swelling or itching at the injection site(s). Other possible complications include bleeding, uneven lips, movement of the implants or extrusion, when an implant breaks through the outermost surface of the skin. The usual, expected swelling and bruising can last from several days to a week. Some patients are allergic to the common local anesthetics like lidocaine and probably should not consider lip injections. Some react badly to the skin test that patients must take before receiving collagen. Other patients who should forego procedures to the lip include those who have active skin conditions like cold sores, blood clotting problems, infections, scarring of the lips or certain diseases like diabetes or lupus that cause slower healing. Patients with facial nerve disorders, severe hypertension or recurrent herpes simplex lesions should also eschew lip augmentation. As in all surgeries, smokers complicate completion of their procedure as well as the speed of healing. Fat transfer can last longer than other injected materials but can have lumping or scarring effects. The length of time a fat transfer may last in the lips is often determined by how much the area moves and how close it is to a major blood supply. In addition, the donor fat must be harvested from another area of the patient's body which leaves another—albeit tiny—surgical wound. However, donor fat harvesting techniques have become extremely well refined.Coleman, SR. Long term survival for fat transplants: controlled demonstration. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery 2996; 19:421-425 Discussion Cosmetic surgery providers often advise their patients that many options now exist for improving the appearance of the lips. Most practitioners also admit that successful lip augmentation is highly dependent on the skill of the provider, with that skill stemming from many years of experience injecting the lips of many types of patients. Moreover, the surgeon must master various injection techniques. With many injectables, the benefit to the patient is an immediate return to normal, usual activities. A few surgeons offer a procedure known as surgical flap augmentations in which small sections of skin near the lips or inside the mouth are excised and added to the lips. But the technique does not add volume and achieves only a slight outward protrusion of the lips.Giovanie Botti, Rene Villedieu. Augmentation cheilopolasty by using mucomuscular flaps.

He held the posts of Astronomer Royal for Scotland, the Regius Professor of Astronomy at the University of Glasgow, and honorary professorships at both the University of Edinburgh and the University of Aberdeen.  Personal life  Brown was born in Dumbarton, Scotland, in 1947. His interest in astronomy started around age eight, when he read a science fiction novel by Patrick Moore. It developed further in 1957 when he saw Comet Arend–Roland through binoculars when aged 10, in the same year that the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank Observatory opened and Moore's television series The Sky at Night began. Brown built telescopes in his youth, helped by his father, who was an engineer. He later married Margaret, and had two children. He died suddenly at his home on the Isle of Skye in the early hours of Saturday 16 November 2019, at the age of 72.  Education  Brown went to Hartfield Primary in Dumbarton from 1952 to 1958 and Dumbarton Academy from 1958 to 1964. He started an astronomy club aged 16, and later built a telescope for the club. He studied for an undergraduate degree in physics & astronomy at the University of Glasgow, earning a first class BSc in 1968. While an undergraduate, he constructed - and -diameter telescopes. Brown went on to receive a PhD in solar plasma physics in 1973, with a thesis on hard X-rays from the Sun. He received a DSc degree (a higher doctorate) in plasma astrophysics in 1984.  Career  The University of Glasgow employed him as an astronomy research assistant in 1968–70 and lecturer from 1970, while he was still studying for his PhD. In 1978 he was promoted to senior lecturer, and then reader in 1980. He received a research fellowship from the Nuffield Foundation in 1983–1984. He was then promoted to chair of astrophysics from 1984 and became the Regius Professor of Astronomy in 1996. Beginning in 1986, he was head of Glasgow's astronomy & astrophysics research group. Brown received additional appointments as honorary professor at the University of Edinburgh from 1996, and the University of Aberdeen from 1998. He taught astronomy at all university levels, from first year undergraduate to postgraduate courses.  Research  He led the University of Glasgow research group in theory and modelling of solar and stellar plasmas. Brown used spacecraft data to investigate solar high energy particles and studied solar flares. He is perhaps best known in the community for the development of the Cold Thick Target Model for Solar X-Ray generation.  Outreach  In his role as Astronomer Royal for Scotland, he gave public talks and performances to generate wider awareness of astronomy and its role in culture. His efforts in science communication incorporated magic tricks and poetry in the Scots language.  Honours  He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1984. He was appointed the 10th Astronomer Royal for Scotland in February 1995. He was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society for his work on solar energetic particles and other contributions to astrophysical research and public outreach. Brown was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to the promotion of astronomy and science education.

That same year they performed in the Festival del Salitre (\\"Saltpeter Festival\\") in María Elena (a mining precinct) and won the festival's prize after performing Quilapayún's \\"La Muralla\\". They were sharply criticized by the organiser of the musical event, Patricio Manns, for interpreting someone else's composition. That same year Pato Valdivia joined the ensemble. In 1972 they moved to Santiago de Chile seeking more performance and recording opportunities. They recorded their first album, Música Andina, for the label DICAP. Shortly afterwards they won a prize at the Norte Andino Festival (\\"Andean North Festival\\") in Calama interpreting \\"Dale Mañungo\\", composed by the songwriter Nano Acevedo. In 1973 they performed for the first time at the prestigious Festival Internacional de la Canción de Viña del Mar music festival. Their novel musical approach and aesthetics on stage gained them the recognition from music critics and praise from the general public. At this stage they began to be considered a new element in the Nueva Canción Chilena (\\"New Chilean Song\\") movement. The resources allocated to the arts and culture under the Popular Unity government of Salvador Allende also allowed Illapu to fully develop their artistic potential. In 1981, because of the repression under the Pinochet regime, they were forced into exile - going first to France and later Mexico City. In 1988, due to the improved political climate, they returned to Chile. Their 1993 album En Estos Días, which contained the hit single \\"Lejos del Amor\\", won 7 platinum records.

The series was created by screenwriter and physician Ivan Raimi, director Sam Raimi, and writer John McNamara. The series was originally developed under the title Cloak and Dagger, but was renamed prior to airing. Plot The series starred Linden Ashby as Lorne Cash, a retired secret agent who reluctantly agrees to get back into the \\"spy game\\" and work for a secret government agency. Following the collapse of the former Soviet Union and the downsizing of international intelligence agencies worldwide, the reduced demand for highly qualified espionage agents has flooded the civilian market with displaced former agents. With the surplus of independent agents running rogue operations, Cash is called in to work with a meager agency whose sole directive is to police these newly freelance spies. Cash contrasts his partner, Max London, played by Allison Smith in their \\"low\\" vs. \\"high\\" tech approaches to problems. Cash is an expert martial artist and was trained to improvise by re-purposing objects in his environment as tools or weapons; conversely, Max prefers to arm herself with the latest cutting-edge technology and gadgets, which occasionally puts them at odds. For example, when disabling a camera system, Max speculates about defeating it with electronic jamming, while Cash simply puts a post-it note over the lens. Alternately, Cash may spend considerable time trying to defeat an opponent in hand-to-hand, while Max will simply use a tranquilizer gun. Despite initial friction, the two quickly establish a rapport (with the usual romantic overtures). Some of the show's humor is generated from Lorne's reluctance to use modern gadgets, as well as the occasional revelations about his past and his high connections. In the premiere episode, for example, Lorne calls the president who is a personal friend and is given a security clearance higher than his boss'. The series was a throwback to the stylish spy series of the 1960s, with particular comparison being made to The Avengers and The Man from U.N.C.L.E., while at the same time poking fun at the genre. (The opening credits were a parody of the opening credits of The Avengers.)

Life King was born in Entiat, Washington to Charles Clement King and Mary Jane Bookwalter.http://jn.nutrition.org/content/118/11/1272.full.pdf He entered Washington State University early, as his local one-room school did not have a twelfth grade. He was a Member of Lambda Chi Alpha. World War I interrupted his college studies, where he served in the 12th Infantry, a machine gun company. He did not receive his B.S. in chemistry until 1918. He immediately departed for the University of Pittsburgh, earning his M.S. in 1920 and Ph.D. in 1923. From the outset of his graduate studies, the nascent field of vitamins interested him. He remained in Pittsburgh as professor until 1942, when he left to become the first scientific director of the Nutrition Foundation, Inc., which worked to promote scientific and public health research, both in the U.S. and internationally. King's contribution to the science of nutrition revolves around his isolation of vitamin C in 1931-1932 by studying the antiscorbic activities of guinea pigs with preparations from lemon juice. Albert Szent-Györgyi was conducting similar research at the University of Szeged in Hungary, focusing on hexuronic acid. The chemical identity of King's active substance was almost identical to Szent-Györgyi's hexuronic acid, but the research of S.S. Silva had declared the hexuronic acid was not vitamin C. However, within two weeks of each other in the spring of 1932, King first, and then Szent-Györgyi, published articles declaring that vitamin C and hexuronic acid were indeed the same compound. Szent-Györgyi would later win a Nobel Prize for his part in the discovery, and controversy remains over whether both men deserve equal credit. King later established the important functional role of vitamin B, and throughout his 40-year research career made many significant contributions in the areas of fats, enzymes and vitamins. King authored over 200 articles on good nutritional practices and the positive effects of vitamins. Apart from his work with the Nutrition Foundation, King's public service activities involved creation of the USDA's Plant, Soil, and Nutrition Laboratory in Ithaca, NY. He helped establish the Food and Nutrition Board, dealing with food and nutrition problems in military and civilian populations, beginning in World War II and continuing through 1970. He also helped create the Food Protection Committee, the Recommended Dietary Allowances, the Protein Advisory Group, and the International Union of Nutritional Sciences. He also served on the advisory council to the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases. King officially retired from the Nutrition Foundation in 1963, only to begin a second career as Associate Director of the Institute of Nutrition Sciences and a consultant to the Rockefeller Foundation.

He was an early member of the Nazi Party and was influential in the rise of the National Socialist movement.  Biography  Joseph Bürckel was born in Lingenfeld, in the Bavarian Palatinate, as the son of a tradesman. From 1909 to 1914 he studied to become a teacher in Speyer.Josef Bürckel - Gauleiter der Westmark Josef Bürckel biography, accessed: 10 February 2009 He volunteered for service with Bavarian Field Artillery Regiment 12 in the First World War. He served with several different field artillery regiments and was honorably discharged in May 1916. After the war, he continued his training as a teacher and graduated in 1920. He was employed as a teacher, and eventually as a headmaster, until September 1930 when he was elected to the Reichstag from electoral constituency 27 (Pfalz). From 1921 onwards, he was engaged in nationalist groups, fighting separatism in the Palatinate. An energetic organizer in the National Socialist movement of the Bavarian Palatinate from 1925, Bürckel rose through the ranks to become Gauleiter (Nazi Party leader) for the region in 1926 and continued in this position when the area was merged with the Saarland in March 1935. On 13 March 1938, Bürckel was appointed acting head of the Party to carry out the referendum on the Anschluss (Austria's absorption into Germany). From 23 April 1938 to 31 March 1940, he worked as Reichskommissar for the union of Austria with the German Reich, in charge of fully integrating it as the Ostmark politically, economically and culturally into the latter. He declared: \\"This is a revolution. The Jews may be glad that it is not of the French or Russian pattern.\\"MacDonogh, G. 1938: Hitler's Gamble. New York: Basic Books, 2009. p 137. Saying Vienna was \\"overfilled with Jews\\", he stated his aim to leave them with no more than five percent of their property. On 20 August 1938, he established the Central Agency for Jewish Emigration in Vienna, at first responsible for the forced emigration of Jews, and later for the subsequent deportation and murder of at least 48,767 Austrian Jews out of Vienna. Bürckel served as Gauleiter of Vienna and Reichsstatthalter (governor) of the region from 30 January 1939 to 7 August 1940, working to further unification with Nazi Germany, including promoting anti-Jewish decrees and seizing Jewish property. He frequently embezzled confiscated money and property instead of turning it over to the state, earning him the displeasure of the Nazi hierarchy and he was eventually removed from his post in Vienna. Upon his return to the Westmark, he continued his previous lifestyle and spent large sums on purchasing artworks.Google book review: Art As Politics in the Third Reich author: Jonathan Petropoulos, publisher: UNC Press, page: 239-240, accessed: 10 February 2009 Following his service as Gauleiter, Bürckel headed the civil administration in Lothringen and from March 1941 was Reichsstatthalter (governor) of the Gau Westmark, composed of the Bavarian Palatinate district, the Prussian Saar territory and the annexed département of Moselle. From 9 November 1937, he also held the rank of general (Gruppenführer) in the Schutzstaffel (SS) and was on the staff of the Reichsführer-SS, Heinrich Himmler. On 30 January 1942, he was promoted to SS- Obergruppenführer.Karl Höffkes: Hitlers Politische Generale. Die Gauleiter des Dritten Reiches: ein biographisches Nachschlagewerk, Grabert-Verlag, Tübingen, 1986, p. 42. . Bürckel died at about 11:04 a.m. in Neustadt-an-der-Weinstrasse on 28 September 1944. A report from Bürckel's personal physician (since 1936), Dr. Ewig, dated 28 September 1944, stated that Bürckel was physically and mentally worn out, spending all of his time at work because of the deteriorating situation in his Gau. He suffered an inflammation of the intestine with diarrhoea, eventually becoming too ill to continue. Ewig was called in on 26 September 1944. Bürckel soon contracted pneumonia and blood failure. Josef Rowies, another physician, stated on 23 October 1944 that the report of Bürckel's death sent to the SS-Personalhauptamt (the personnel records office) by Himmler's personal staff office on 9 October 1944 had been \\"doctored\\" to conceal his mental breakdown. On 8 September 1944, in a letter to Martin Bormann (with whom Bürckel did not get along), Bürckel opined that the lack of combat-ready troops to occupy the defensive line of the Moselle from the boundary of Gau Westmark via the arsenal of Metz-Diedenhofen, south of Saint-Avold (part of the Maginot Line), to Sarralbe made construction of defensive positions useless. Bormann responded by dispatching Willi Stöhr (who was to succeed Bürckel after his death) to oversee the construction work. On 3 October 1944, Hitler posthumously awarded him the German Order, the highest decoration that the Party could bestow on an individual, for his services to the Reich.

A total of nine people witnessed the founding of the Elim mission in El Salvador. In 1983, the mission in El Salvador separated from that of Guatemala over doctrinal disagreements. Due to the complicated nature of changing the official name of the church in the midst of civil war, the church retained the name \\"Misión Cristiana Elim de El Salvador\\", which still holds until today. The church in Guatemala changed its name to \\"Partners Area Elim Ministries\\" and later \\"Elim Ministries\\". In 1985 the church in San Salvador had about 3,000 people.

Biography  Giuseppe Tarantino was born in Gravina in Puglia. His father was Filippo Tarantino, a local nobleman, while his mother was Letizia Spagnuolo. He studied in the high school of his hometown, helped by his uncle Nicola. Then he studied in Pisa, first at the University of Pisa and then at Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa. He studied under the guide of Francesco Fiorentino.https://filippotarantino.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/tarantino- linconscio-e-la-coscienza-testo-pubblicato1.pdf He graduated at the age of 22 in literature and philosophy (lettere e filosofia); then he followed his mentor Fiorentino in Napoli and there he stayed until the death of Fiorentino, in 1884. Tarantino dedicated his work Saggi Filosofici to the memory of his mentor Fiorentino; in the same year he was assigned the chair of theoretical philosophy. He started to achieve prominence thanks to his critical essays published on newspaper Il Giornale Napoletano. For over ten years, he was focused on his work Saggio sulla volontà, published in 1897. He had a short- lived relationship with a Florence woman whose name was \\"Bice\\", even though he was attached to another woman from Gravina in Puglia, whom he had met in 1891 in Naples.https://filippotarantino.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/tarantino- linconscio-e-la-coscienza-testo-pubblicato1.pdf For a certain period, he neglected his relationship in order to focus on his works. From 1886 to 1888, he taught at Liceo Marciano. In 1887 he was appointed as a teacher of philosophy at Liceo Antonio Genovesi of Naples. In September 1891, he successfully applied for the chair of theoretical philosophy in Palermo. He started to gain wider recognition thanks to his critical essays published on the journal Rivista di Filosofia Scientifica (by Morselli). Of those essays, the most notable is probably the one about John Locke.https://filippotarantino.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/tarantino- linconscio-e-la-coscienza-testo-pubblicato1.pdf Among his former pupils were Enrico de Nicola and the nobleman Francesco Dentice di Accadia, prefect of Pisa.

Biography Flag of Kladas. Krokodeilos Kladas, whose family migrated from Epirus to the Peloponnese,. was born in Koroni in 1425;. his father was the Greek military chief Theodore Kladas. When the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II (r. 1444–1446 and 1451–1481) took the Morea in 1460, Kladas handed over his castle of Saint George (Agios Giorgios) and was given in exchange the castle of Vardounia in Upper Mani and the territory of Elos.. By 1465, the Kladas brothers, Krokodeilos and Epifani, were leading bands of stratioti (warrior bands) on behalf of Venice against the Turks. They put Vardounia and their lands into Venetian possession, for which Epifani then acted as governor. The Kladas brothers were frequently complimented by Venetian officials, and received generous Venetian gifts. Krokodeilos Kladas and his followers stood as rebels against Mehmed, but the Venetian-Ottoman peace settlement, while giving them a full pardon, also returned territorial boundaries to what they had been in 1463, so this put the Venetian-Kladas land holdings back into Ottoman possession. Kladas moved to Venetian-held Koroni. On October 9, 1480, Kladas led stratioti from Koroni to attack Ottoman holdings in Mani. Both the Ottomans and the Venetians put a price on his head; the latter, specifically, \\"put a bounty of 10,000 hyperpyrai from the mint of Methone on Kladas' head.\\". This revolt was joined in December by stratioti from Nafplion led by Theodore Bua. An army sent by the Sultan was defeated between Passavas and Oitylo in February 1481. Later that month, a larger force under Mohammed Bey drove Kladas to Porto Kagio where he was taken on board a Neapolitan galley, leaving his revolt to wither in his absence. A peaceful settlement of the revolt was negotiated by the Ottoman governor of the Morea and Venetian official Bartolomeo Minio. Meanwhile, Kladas went with a Neapolitan army to Albania to aid an anti-Ottoman revolt there. It is not known when he returned to Mani. He was captured in battle near Monemvasia in 1490 and flayed alive., quoting earlier testimony. Cited in . Family The Kladas family is known in records from the Morea since 1296 when a \\"Corcondille\\" managed to capture a Frankish-held castle for the Byzantines.. Members of the family made donations to a monastery at Mistra in 1366 and 1375.; . A Krokodeilos is identified as one of the rebels against the Emperor Manuel II in 1415. The \\"Crocodile\\" pun made there is a single appearance and never appears in contemporary documents relating to this Krokodeilos Kladas.. The carved inscription on a donation to a church in Karytaina with the name transliterated as \\"Krokontēlos\\" is probably not related to him, and the carving is dated to the mid-14th century.. He and his brothers are strongly praised in Venetian sources.For examples, see ; , passim. Kladas had been awarded a Venetian knighthood (and a gold robe) just before the 1480 revolt.. Members of the family moved to Kefalonia and continued to lead stratioti in Venetian service for at least another hundred years.

Noll was a member of a US lifeguard team that introduced malibu boards to Australia around the time of the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games. Noll also produced a \\"legendary\\" series of 5 Search for Surf movies.  Early life  Noll was born in San Diego, California. At the age of 3, Noll moved with his family to Manhattan Beach, California. Noll began surfing age 11 in the South Bay, he was a member of Manhattan Beach Surf Club where he learned board shaping from Dale Velzy. Noll was a member of the Los Angeles County Lifeguards and competed in paddleboarding. Noll developed his big wave surfing in Palos Verdes at breaks like Lunada Bay. He moved to Hawaii in 1954, where he finished high school, and lived and surfed at Makaha.  Big waves Noll became known for his exploits in large Hawaiian surf on the North Shore of Oahu. In November 1957, he surfed Waimea Bay in 25–30 ft surf; at the time, this was thought to be impossible, even by the local Hawaiians. He was the first surfer to ride a wave breaking on the outside reef at Banzai Pipeline in November 1964. It was later at Makaha, in December 1969, that he rode what many at the time believed to be the largest wave ever surfed. After that wave and the ensuing wipeout during the course of that spectacular ride down the face of a massive dark wall of water, his surfing tapered off and he closed his Hermosa Beach shop in the early 1970s. He and other surfers such as Pat Curren, Mike Stange, Buzzy Trent, George Downing, Mickey Munoz, Wally Froyseth, Fred Van Dyke and Peter Cole are viewed as the most daring surfers of their generation. Noll is readily identified in film footage while surfing by his now iconic black and white horizontally striped \\"jailhouse\\" boardshorts. The surfing exploits of Noll and other big wave legends were chronicled in the documentary Riding Giants. Noll also provided his perspective on Hawaiian big wave surfing on the commentary track for DVD, along with Laird Hamilton and Jeff Clark.  Board shaping  Having shaped surfboards since his youth, and having founded his own surfboard business in the 1950s which reached a high level of commercial success, Noll changed to two decades of commercial fishing. The resurgence of longboards brought Noll back to resume shaping and organize events. Today Noll lives in Hiouchi, California with his wife and shapes re-creations of some of the historic boards from the sport of surfing. Some of these are: Olos and Alaias, a replica of a Duke Kahanamoku board, Malibu Chips, Guns, Da Cats, Pacific System Homes and others.  Works  * Kampion, Drew & Noll, Greg.

He was captured by the Byzantines in 1259 at the Battle of Pelagonia, and had to give up the castle as part of his ransom. The location of the castle is not clear. Modern usage refers to the castle of Porto Kagio as \\"Mani\\", but medieval portolans place the castle of Grand Magne on the western shore of the peninsula and its fortification was not mentioned by portolans or travelers before about 1568. Another candidate is the settlement of Tigani, but although a sizeable medieval town it shows no traces of having been the site of a Crusader fortress. Antoine Bon preferred the nearby site of Cavo Grosso (Cape Thyrides), known as Kastro tis Orias, where 19th-century travellers, including the French Expédition scientifique de Morée, mentioned the existence of fortifications, and which occupies a commanding position. J. M.

It catalyzes the reaction of L-gulono-1,4-lactone with oxygen to L-xylo-hex-3-gulonolactone and hydrogen peroxide. It uses FAD as a cofactor. The L-xylo-hex-3-gulonolactone (2-keto-gulono-gamma-lactone) is able to convert to hexuronic acid (ascorbic acid) spontaneously, without enzymatic action. Gulonolactone oxidase deficiency The non-functional gulonolactone oxidase pseudogene (GULOP) was mapped to human chromosome 8p21 that corresponds to an evolutionarily conserved segment on either porcine chromosome 4 (SSC4) or 14 (SSC14).GULOP – iHOP GULO produces the precursor to ascorbic acid, which spontaneously converts to the vitamin (\\"vitamin C\\"). The loss of activity of the gene for L-gulonolactone oxidase (GULO) has occurred separately in the history of several species. GULO activity has been lost in some species of bats, but others retain it. The loss of this enzyme activity is responsible for the inability of guinea pigs to enzymatically synthesize vitamin C. Both these events happened independently of the loss in the haplorrhini suborder of primates, including humans. The remnant of this non- functional gene with many mutations is, however, still present in the genomes of guinea pigs and humans. It is unknown if remains of the gene exist in the bats who lack GULO activity. The function of GULO appears to have been lost several times, and possibly re-acquired, in several lines of passerine birds, where ability to make vitamin C varies from species to species. Loss of GULO activity in the primate order occurred about 63 million years ago, at about the time it split into the suborders Haplorhini (which lost the enzyme activity) and Strepsirrhini (which retained it). The haplorhines (\\"simple nosed\\") primates, which cannot make vitamin C enzymatically, include the tarsiers and the simians (apes, monkeys and humans). The strepsirrhines (bent or wet-nosed) primates, which can still make vitamin C enzymatically, include lorises, galagos, pottos, and, to some extent, lemurs. L-gulonolactone oxidase deficiency is called \\"hypoascorbemia\\"HYPOASCORBEMIA – NCBI and is described by OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man)OMIM – Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man – NCBI as \\"a public inborn error of metabolism\\", as it affects all humans. There exists a wide discrepancy between the amounts of ascorbic acid other primates consume and what is recommended as \\"reference intakes\\" for humans. In its patently pathological form, the effects of ascorbate deficiency are manifested as scurvy. Consequences of loss It is likely that some level of adaptation occurred after the loss of the GULO gene by primates. Erythrocyte Glut1 and associated dehydroascorbic acid uptake modulated by stomatin switch are unique traits of humans and the few other mammals that have lost the ability to synthesize ascorbic acid from glucose. As GLUT transporters and stomatin are ubiquitously distributed in different human cell types and tissues, similar interactions can be hypothesized to occur in human cells other than erythrocytes. Pauling observed that after the loss of endogenous ascorbate production, apo(a) and Lp(a) were greatly favored by evolution, acting as ascorbate surrogate, since the frequency of occurrence of elevated Lp(a) plasma levels in species that had lost the ability to synthesize ascorbate is great. Also, only primates share regulation of CAMP gene expression by vitamin D which occurred after the loss of GULO gene. Johnson et al. have hypothesized that the mutation of the GULOP (pseudogene that produces L-gulonolactone oxidase) so that it stopped producing GULO may have been of benefit to early primates by increasing uric acid levels and enhancing fructose effects on weight gain and fat accumulation. With a shortage of food supplies this gave mutants survival advantage.  Animal models  Studies of human diseases have benefited from the availability of small laboratory animal models. However, the tissues of animal models with a GULO gene generally have high levels of ascorbic acid and so are often only slightly influenced by exogenous vitamin C. This is a major handicap for studies involving the endogenous redox systems of primates and other animals that lack this gene. Guinea pigs are a popular human model. They lost the ability to synthesize L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase 20 million years ago. In 1999, Maeda et al. genetically engineered mice with inactivated GULO gene. The mutant mice, like humans, entirely depend on dietary vitamin C, and they show changes indicating that the integrity of their vasculature is compromised. GULO-/- mice were used as a human model in multiple subsequent studies. There have been successful attempts to activate lost enzymatic function in different animal species. Various GULO mutants were also identified.  Plant models  In plants, the importance of Vitamin C in regulating whole plant morphology, cell structure, and plant development has been clearly established via characterization of low vitamin C mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana, potato, tobacco, tomato, and rice. Elevating vitamin C content by overexpressing inositol oxygenase and gulono-1,4-lactone oxidase in A. thaliana leads to enhanced biomass and tolerance to abiotic stresses.  Alternative substrates and related enzymes  GLUO belongs to a family of sugar-1,4-lactone oxidases, which also contains the yeast enzyme D-arabinono-1,4-lactone oxidase (ALO). ALO produces Erythorbic acid with its canonical substrate. This family is in turn a subfamily under more sugar-1,4-lactone oxidases, which also includes the bacterial L-gulono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase and the plant galactonolactone dehydrogenase. All these aldonolactone oxidoreductases play a role in some form of Vitamin C synthesis, and some (including GLUO and ALO) accepts substrates of other members.

It is a tributary of the Chambal River, itself a tributary of the Yamuna, which in turn merges into the Ganga. The Banas is approximately 512 kilometres in length. The name \\"Banaas\\" literally translates as \\"forest- hope\\" (Ban-aas) meaning \\"Hope-of-the-forest\\" or 'Van Ki Aasha.' The river originates in the Veron ka Math situated in Khamnor Hills of the Aravalli Range, about 5 km from Kumbhalgarh in Rajsamand district. It flows northeast through the Mewar region of Rajasthan, then across Hadavati before meeting the Chambal near the village of Rameshwar in Sawai Madhopur District. The Banas drains a basin of 45,833 km², and lies entirely within Rajasthan. It drains the east slope of the central portion of the Aravalli Range, and the basin includes all or part of Ajmer, Bhilwara, Bundi, Chittorgarh, Dausa, Jaipur, Pali, Rajsamand, Sawai Madhopur, Sirohi, Tonk, and Udaipur districts. The cities of Nathdwara, Jahazpur, and Tonk lie on the river. Major tributaries include the right bank tributaries of Berach and Menali and the left bank tributaries of Kothari, Khari, Dai, Dheel River, Sohadara River, Morel and Kalisil.

He previously worked as the sports director of KGO radio in San Francisco, California and play-by-play announcer for the San Francisco 49ers for 20 seasons from 1989 to 2008. Starkey is most famous for his frenetic call of The Play in the 1982 Big Game between Cal and Stanford: \\"Oh, the band is out on the field!\\" Starkey nearly lost his voice during and after this event, which he hailed as \\"the most amazing, sensational, dramatic, heartrending, exciting, thrilling finish in the history of college football!\\" Career Starkey grew up in Chicago, and briefly played football at Thornton Junior College. He attended Loyola University Chicago, earning a bachelor's and master's degree in business. He has broadcast for the NFL's Minnesota Vikings (1977) and Denver Broncos, the USFL's Oakland Invaders, and the first telecaster for the NHL's San Jose Sharks. Starkey was also the radio and television voice of the now defunct National Hockey League's Oakland (later California Golden) Seals and Colorado Rockies who later became the New Jersey Devils. His trademark call, whenever the Seals scored a goal, was \\"What a bonanza!\\" It was a trademark call he carried into his football broadcasts to describe outlandish catches, notably by Jerry Rice and Terrell Owens. Other previous assignments include the Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL, and basketball games for the NBA's Golden State Warriors and the University of California Golden Bears. =San Francisco 49ers= Prior to assuming play-by- play duties with the 49ers in 1989 he served as color analyst on 49ers radio broadcasts in 1987 and 1988 with the legendary Lon Simmons handling play-by- play. Also he called the radio broadcasts of Super Bowl XXIV, and Super Bowl XXIX. He was involved in the radio call of several of the team's most famous moments. In addition to his Super Bowl calls, Starkey was play-by-play announcer for the 1998 club's two signature moments - Garrison Hearst's 96-yard touchdown in overtime against the Jets, and Steve Young's game-winning touchdown to Terrell Owens - The Catch II. Starkey also broadcast San Francisco's 2002 playoff comeback against the Giants. When the 49ers moved their broadcasts from KGO to rival station KNBR in 2005, Starkey had to resign from KGO in order to continue his role with the 49ers. Starkey is still the broadcaster for the Cal Bears on KGO radio. On December 18, 2008, Starkey announced his retirement as the play-by-play announcer of the 49ers, citing difficulties with travel between Saturday Cal football games and Sunday 49ers games. He will continue as the voice of the Bears indefinitely. In December 2010 The National Football Foundation honored him with \\"The Chris Schenkel Award\\" for his long and distinguished career broadcasting college football for the University of California at its annual awards dinner at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City. He was nine times voted Best California play by play broadcaster by the Associated Press and was inducted into the Bay Area Radio Hall of Fame in 2009. Personal Starkey and his wife Diane reside in the Bay Area. They have three sons Jim, Dan and Rob and six grandchildren. Jim resides in Wilton, CA with his wife Cyndi and their son and two daughters.

The term is a portmanteau of the term Milwaukee Organic Nitrogen. The sewer system of the District collects municipal wastewater from the Milwaukee metropolitan area. After settling, wastewater is treated with microbes to break down organic matter at the Jones Island sewage treatment plant (also called \\"Water Reclamation Facility\\") in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The byproduct sewage sludge is produced. This is heat-dried with hot air in the range of , which heats the sewage sludge to at least to kill pathogens. The material is then pelletized and marketed throughout the United States under the name Milorganite. The result is recycling of the nitrogen and phosphorus from the waste-stream as fertilizer. The treated wastewater is discharged to Lake Michigan. The Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District has registered Milorganite® as a trademark.  History  \\"Milorganite\\" is a portmanteau of the term Milwaukee Organic Nitrogen. It was the winning entry in a 1925 naming contest for a biosolids-based fertilizer held in National Fertilizer Magazine. Its history began with Milwaukee's goal to clean up its rivers and Lake Michigan. Rather than land filling solids left over from wastewater treatment, the sludge was used in a pioneering effort to make, distribute and sell fertilizer. as of May, 2019, 9.9 billion pounds of waste have been diverted away from landfills. The resulting production is among the largest recycling programs in the world. Milorganite's roots began in 1911, when local socialist politicians were elected on a platform calling for construction of a wastewater treatment plant to protect against water borne pathogens.. As raising taxes for public health was relatively controversial in the early 1900s, producing an organic fertilizer as a means of partially offsetting its operating cost was proposed. With the help of researchers in the College of Agriculture at the University of Wisconsin, the use of waste solids in the form of activated sludge as a source of fertilizer had been developed in the early 20th century. Experiments showed that heat-dried activated sludge pellets \\"compared favorably with standard organic materials such as dried blood, tankage, fish scrap, and cottonseed meal.\\"Eleventh Annual Report of the Sewerage Commission of the City of Milwaukee for 1924, pp. 32–42. The Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District's Jones Island Plant had the largest water treatment capacity of any in the world when constructed in 1925. It was the first plant in the United States to succeed in using the activated sludge treatment process to produce fertilizer. The Plant has been designated as a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers. Milorganite made its debut in 1926 as the first pelletized fertilizer in the United States, with sales directed at golf courses, turf farms and flower growers.See, North American's Most Widely Known, Respected, and Beloved Turfgrass Agronomist, The O.J. Noer Research Foundation, Inc., Michigan State U. Libraries, Turfgrass Information Center, www.lib.msu.edu/tgif. The brand was popularized during the 1930s and 1940s before inorganic urea became available to homeowners after WWII. Since its inception, over four million metric tons of Milorganite have been sold. As of 2018, the plant produces in the range of 45,000–49,000 tons of Milorganite per year, which is roughly 2.4 million bags. The sale of product does not generate sufficient funds to cover the costs of manufacture, but the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District states that the environmental benefits are a legitimate offsetting consideration: In addition to the conflicting financial and environmental goals, it has to cope with fluctuations and vagaries of a changing waste stream. For example, there has been a substantial impact upon both the quality and the quantity of raw material available as a result of Milwaukee losing much of its malting and brewing industry through the departure of once-giant local concerns Schlitz Brewing Company and Pabst Brewing Company. Milorganite has been at the forefront of the sewage sludge recycling industry in the U.S. Changes in the economy and the resultant sewage to be treated have had an impact on Milorganite production. The process is the end point of the regional sewerage system, which includes \\"three thousand miles of household laterals and another 3,000 miles of sanitary sewers.\\" Also included is the \\"deep tunnel project\\", which provides of overflow storage system. Two plants, one on Jones Island and the other in Oak Creek, process sewage using bacteria. Methane is recaptured and used to minimize energy costs.  Product  Heat-dried biosolids contain slow release organic nitrogen and largely water-insoluble phosphorus bound with iron and aluminum and high organic matter. or puri.fcla.edu/fcia/etd/UFE0022710 Milorganite can be used without restriction on gardens growing food crops intended for human consumption under United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules. The product is tested daily for the presence of heavy metals and weekly for waterborne pathogens. It complies with the EPA \\"Exceptional Quality\\" criteria, which establishes the strictest concentration limits in the fertilizer industry for heavy metals, allowing Milorganite to be used on food crops. Milorganite has been tested for the presence of contaminants such as waste pharmaceuticals and other forms of drug pollution. According to its material safety data sheet Milorganite is \\"registered for sale in all 50 states and meets all federal and state requirements.\\" The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) certifies it as biobased because it is derived from 85% renewable materials. It is not, however, certified for use on USDA organic farms. Suggestions that Milorganite deters deer are unsubstantiated, and the reputed costs of having it certified as a repellent are greater than its potential return. The Environmental Protection Agency denied the application to permit its use as a deer repellant because of a lack of supporting studies showing its environmental impact. \\"Milorganite Weed and Feed\\", a combination of Milorganite with 2,4-D, in a partnership with Parker Fertilizer, was considered in 1971. Seeking to associate itself with the \\"ecology kick\\", Milorganite's marketing staff considered the implications of \\"Milorganite-cide blends\\". Critics said that the invention of such a product was a repudiation of the sewage district's history. The concept was eventually rejected, and was never marketed to the public. Claims that Milorganite itself was a \\"natural, organic and/or safe\\" product were identified as a concern in 1992, when the Federal Trade Commission began an investigation saying the claim was deceptive. By 2000, the United States Department of Agriculture banned the application of all biosolids to any crops bearing the label \\"organic\\". Environmental concerns The EPA has shown that biosolids can contain measurable levels of synthetic organic compounds, radionuclides and heavy metals. USEPA has set numeric limits for arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, and zinc. The presence of heavy metals is a source of concern. The facility reports that they have been substantially reduced over the years. Milorganite contains metals at levels found safe by EPA when Milorganite is used as directed. The EPA has not regulated levels of environmentally toxic manmade dioxins. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers, a type of \\"persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic\\" (PBT) contaminant, were detected in biosolids in 2001. PCBS are occasionally detected despite production being banned since the 1970s. In 2007, unusually high levels of toxic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were detected in Milorganite that was donated to the City of Milwaukee and Milwaukee County and subsequently applied on parkland. The cost to the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District and tax payers was estimated as $4.7 million. PCBs were banned from commerce in the US in the mid-1970s. The source of the PCB contamination was later determined to be a shuttered die-casting facility. The PCBs made their way to the treatment plant when sewer lines were cleaned years after the facility stopped operation. The United States Geological Survey analyzed in 2014 nine different consumer products containing biosolids as a main ingredient for 87 organic chemicals found in cleaners, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and other products. These analysis detected 55 of the 87 organic chemicals measured in at least one of the nine biosolid samples, with 45 chemicals found in Milorganite. The incidence and effects of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFOs and PFA) in Milorganite, and municipal waste in generalas a part of the waste stream, and as a source of water and environmental contaminationhas been a subject of study, controversy and concern.

It is responsible for installing, maintaining, and operating all types of telecommunications equipment and information systems. The motto of the Signals Corps is Certa Cito and is translated as 'Swift and Sure', signifying the aim of the signal service – that communication be carried out with maximum speed and certainty. Like their British counterparts, the Royal Australian Corps of Signals' flag and hat badge feature Mercury, the winged messenger of the gods, affectionately referred to by members of the corps as \\"Jimmy\\" (the origin dates back to the merge with Engineers when the Engineer's band's Drum Major had a \\"Jimmy\\" on his staff). Modern Army command and control systems demand reliable, high- speed transfer of large volumes of data. The communications systems provided by Signals must keep pace with modern information technology. The control of the electromagnetic spectrum offers a decisive advantage in modern warfare and Electronic Warfare, listening to or interfering with enemy electronic transmissions, is a critical contribution by the Signals Corps to the Army's combat capability. On the battlefield, Signals provides commanders with the means of controlling the battle using road and air dispatch services, radio, microwave, and satellite links. A high technology computer switched digital network, capable of providing a high quality, high capacity, secure communications network is being introduced. The Corps has recently taken over the responsibility for Army Information Systems. Signal Corps personnel now control large integrated information systems and are responsible for the installation and operation of local area networks using state-of-the-art computer equipment. Specialist roles in the Corps include: Communication System Operator (known in the Corps as \\"Operators\\"), Telecommunications Technician (known as \\"Techs\\" or \\"Techies\\"), Electronic Warfare Operator (known as \\"Bears\\" from being primarily posted to a base near Cabarlah (Koala), Queensland) and Information Systems Technician (known as \\"Geeks\\"). History Princess Anne passes behind The Princess Anne Banner at the 75th anniversary parade for the Royal Australian Corps of Signals Princess Anne inspects troops at the 75th anniversary parade for the Royal Australian Corps of Signals Princess Anne Banner Australia has the unique distinction of having had the first regularly formed signal unit in the British Empire. The Corps began in 1869 as a small \\"torpedo and signals corp\\", located in New South Wales and Victoria. These units existed until 1882 when they were disbanded. In 1885, a \\"signalling corps\\", composed of one officer and twelve other ranks, was created in South Australia and remained active until 1901. After the inception of the Commonwealth Forces, an \\"Australian Corps of Signallers\\" was formed on 12 January 1906. This day is recognised as the Signal Corps' birthday. The Corps remained as a self-contained unit until 1911 when it was merged with Australian Engineers. On 1 January 1925, the Australian Corps of Signals was formed and all Signals units were separated from the Australian Corps of Engineers. At the conclusion of World War II, a silver salver was presented to the Australian Corps of Signals by Princess Mary as a memento of the co-operation between the Royal Corps of Signals and the Australian Corps of Signals throughout the Second World War. On 10 November 1948, His Majesty King George VI conferred the title \\"Royal\\" on the Australian Corps of Signals. The day is recognised a \\"Corps Day\\", and commemorative functions are held on, or as near as possible to, 10 November each year. Approval was given by Her Royal Highness, Princess Anne, The Princess Royal, the Signals Corps' Colonel-in-Chief, on 10 September 1980 for the Corps to carry a banner bearing her Cipher. The banner is known as \\"The Princess Anne Banner\\", and was presented to the Signals Corps by the then Governor-General, The Right Honourable Sir Ninian Stephen on 29 November 1986. On 5 July 2000, a parade was held for her Royal Highness, Princess Anne, The Princess Royal at Simpson Barracks, Watsonia, marking the 75th anniversary of the Corps. In the Australia Day Honours List, 2014, the FCU Cambodia was awarded the Meritorious Unit Citation. The Citation is kept in trust with the DFSS. The Citation streamer “FCU Cambodia” is affixed to the head of The Princess Anne Banner. Structure The Royal Australian Signals Corps is divided into a number of regiments and squadrons, both Regular Army, Army Reserve, and Special Operations Command. Each brigade of the Army has a Signals Squadron which forms part of the brigade's Command Support Regiment. The Army's two divisions each have a signal regiment. =Regular Army= * 1st Signal Regiment – 1st Division in Enoggera, Queensland ** HQ Squadron ** 100th Logistic Support Squadron ** 101st Signal Squadron * 1st Combat Signal Regiment – 1st Brigade in Darwin ** HQ Squadron ** 104th Signal Squadron ** 105th Signal Squadron * 3rd Combat Signal Regiment – 3rd Brigade in Townsville ** HQ Squadron ** 102nd Signal Squadron ** 103rd Signal Squadron * 7th Combat Signal Regiment – 7th Brigade in Enoggera, Queensland ** HQ Squadron ** 139th Signal Squadron ** 140th Signal Squadron * 7th Signal Regiment (Electronic Warfare) – 6th Brigade in Cabarlah ** 71st Squadron ** 72nd Squadron ** 73rd Squadron ** 138th Signal Squadron ** Operations Support Squadron * 145th Signal Squadron – 17th Sustainment Brigade in Sydney =Army Reserve= Regiments: * 8th Signal Regiment – 2nd Division, Randwick Barracks in Sydney ** 142nd Signal Squadron - Holsworthy Barracks in Liverpool ** 143rd Signal Squadron - HMAS Harman in Canberra ** Operational Support Squadron - Randwick Barracks in Sydney Independent squadrons: * 108th Signal Squadron - Simpson Barracks in Melbourne * 109th Signals Squadron - Irwin Barracks in Perth * 141st Signal Squadron - Gallipoli Barracks in Brisbane and Lavarack Barracks in Townsville * 144th Signal Squadron - Keswick Barracks in Adelaide and Derwent Barracks in Hobart = Special Operations Command = * 126th Signal Squadron (2nd Commando Regiment) in Holsworthy, New South Wales * 152nd Signal Squadron (Special Air Service Regiment) in Perth * 301st Signal Squadron (1st Commando Regiment) in Randwick, New South Wales Colours Tactical Recognition Flash Domestic Colours The Royal Australian Corps of Signals has two sets of colours, tactical and domestic. The Tactical colours are White on Royal blue. White symbolises the ribbons wound on the Caduceus of the god Hermes and the Blue representing the Royal Colours. The domestic colours, sky blue on dark blue on dark green, represent the three mediums of communication: air, sea, and land. Training Soldiers joining the Signals Corps are given training specific to their field at the Defence Force School of Signals after first graduating from recruit training at the Army Recruit Training Centre, Kapooka. The School of Signals is a tri-service educational facility located on Simpson Barracks in Watsonia, Victoria. It is the home of the Signals Corps and the centre for defence training in communications and information systems for the Australian Defence Force. The school was previously located at Balcombe, before moving to Watsonia in the late 1960s. though Balcombe was maintained as a training location for some Signals and Army apprentice courses into the 1980s. The School also has an Electronic Warfare wing, called the Joint Telecommunications School, located on Borneo Barracks in Cabarlah, Queensland. After successful completion of the 80-day recruit course at Kapooka, all soldiers joining the Signals Corps, regardless of specialisation, first complete an eight-day Common Corps course which provides basic Royal Australian Corps of Signals skills in radio, line laying and computing and is a prerequisite for all Australian Regular Army RA Sigs trade courses. The course (and most subsequent training) is held at Defence Force School of Signals, Simpson Barracks, Macleod, Victoria. On successful completion of the Common Corps course, students will be placed in a holding platoon while they wait for their trade course to start. During this time students may be placed on other courses, such as driver training. *Communication Systems Operator: Communication Systems Operator training is a 25-week course in which trainees are instructed in the operation and maintenance of military High Frequency (HF) and Very High Frequency (VHF) radios, portable satellite terminals, frequency hopping and cryptographic equipment. Communication Systems Operators will also be trained to deploy computer networks and to operate computer-based communications applications. This training is conducted in a range of simulated environments based upon vehicle and Command Post operations. *Telecommunications Technician: Telecommunications Technician training is a 72-week course that incorporates all aspects of the telecommunications communications equipment used in RA Sigs Units. Subjects include telecommunications cabling, satellite theory and equipment stations, circuit switch networks, docking, telephone systems and local and wide-area computer networks. *Electronic Warfare Operator: The Electronic Warfare Operator course is delivered in two parts due to the security clearance requirements. It trains ARA trainees in Electronic Warfare and Signal Intelligence fundamentals, including basic language skills and typing. **Part One is of 22 weeks duration and is delivered at the Australian Defence Force School of Languages, RAAF Williams, Laverton, Victoria. **Part Two is of 36 weeks duration and is delivered at Defence Force School of Signals, Electronic Warfare Wing, Borneo Barracks, Cabarlah, Queensland. :To commence Part Two training, trainees must have a Top Secret Positive Vetted (TSPV) clearance, which depending on the individual and on personal history can take from 6 to 12 months to acquire. Both the ADF School of Languages and the Defence Force School of Signals (DFSS) are tri-service training facilities and also train Navy and Air Force personnel. *Information Systems Technician: Training incorporates a wide variety of Information Technology (IT) subjects including fundamentals of computing, diagnosing hardware and software problems, network operating systems, installation of applications and peripheral devices, operating a help desk, data communications and operation of a Deployable Local Area Network (DLAN). Equipment Flag of the RASigs Project Parakeet is the Army's mobile Battlefield Telecommunications Network (BTN) which was introduced into service in the mid-1990s through Project JP65.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 1, 1992. In the episode, Marge wins the role of Blanche DuBois in a community theatre musical version of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire. Homer offers little support for his wife's acting pursuits, and Marge begins to see parallels between him and Stanley Kowalski, the play's boorish lead male character. The episode contains a subplot in which Maggie Simpson attempts to retrieve her pacifier from a strict daycare owner. The episode was written by Jeff Martin and directed by Rich Moore. Jon Lovitz made his fourth guest appearance on The Simpsons, this time as musical director Llewellyn Sinclair, as well as Llewellyn's sister, who runs the daycare. The episode generated controversy for its original song about New Orleans, which contains several unflattering lyrics about the city. One New Orleans newspaper published the lyrics before the episode aired, prompting numerous complaints to the local Fox affiliate; in response, the president of Fox Broadcasting issued an apology to anyone who was offended. Despite the controversial song, the episode was well received by many fans, and show creator Matt Groening has named it one of his favorite episodes. Plot While Homer, Bart and Lisa are watching a beauty pageant on television, Marge announces that she is going to audition for a local musical production of A Streetcar Named Desire. She explains that she wants to meet new people because she usually spends all day caring for Maggie. The family ignores her and she leaves for her audition, feeling unappreciated by Homer. The musical, Oh, Streetcar!, is directed by Llewellyn Sinclair. After Ned is cast as Stanley Kowalski, Marge auditions for Blanche DuBois. Llewellyn immediately rejects Marge, explaining that Blanche is supposed to be a \\"delicate flower being trampled by an uncouth lout\\". However, as a dejected Marge calls home and takes Homer's dinner order, Llewellyn realizes that she is perfect for the role. The next day, Maggie causes distractions when Marge brings her to rehearsal, so Llewellyn tells Marge to enroll the baby at the daycare center, The Ayn Rand School for Tots, which is run by his sister Ms. Sinclair, who immediately confiscates Maggie's pacifier. Maggie and the other babies later engage in an attempt to retrieve their pacifiers, but Ms. Sinclair thwarts their efforts and sends Maggie to a playpen. During rehearsal, Marge struggles with a scene in which Blanche is supposed to break a glass bottle and attack Stanley, but she cannot muster enough anger towards Stanley to break the bottle. After coming home, Marge asks Homer to help her learn her lines, but Homer is uninterested. The day before the performance, Marge and Ned are again practising the bottle scene as Homer arrives to drive Marge home. Homer repeatedly interrupts the rehearsal. Imagining that Stanley is Homer, Marge finally smashes the bottle and lunges at Ned. The next day at the daycare center, Maggie again attempts to regain her pacifier. With assistance from her fellow babies, following a complicated plan, she succeeds and wildly distributes pacifiers to all the small children. Homer retrieves her, and he and his children go to attend the musical. Homer immediately falls into boredom, but he perks up when Marge appears on stage. While Homer slowly learns the show's plot, he appears sad. At the end of the musical, Marge receives a warm reaction from the crowd, but she misinterprets Homer's sadness for boredom. She confronts him with frustration and hostility, but Homer is able to explain that he was genuinely moved by the play. He feels for Blanche's situation, and he realizes Marge's feelings along with it. He expresses his intentions to be the husband that she deserves—someone to have in her life who loves her—not like Stanley who neglects and mistreats his wife. Marge realizes that Homer really did watch the musical, and the two happily leave the theater. Production =Writing and music= Producer James L. Brooks pitched the idea of Marge playing Blanche DuBois. \\"A Streetcar Named Marge\\" was conceived about two years before it aired on television.Martin, Jeff. (2004). Commentary for \\"A Streetcar Named Marge\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Jeff Martin first pitched the idea of Homer being in a theatrical production of 1776; producer James L. Brooks then suggested that Marge could play Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire. Brooks saw that Marge's relationship with Homer was similar to Blanche's relationship with Stanley, and he wanted to use that fact to build the emotional arc for an episode. The estate of Tennessee Williams would not let the show use large excerpts from the actual play, since the work was copyrighted. However, Fox lawyer Anatole Klebanow said that original songs based on the play were acceptable. According to producer Mike Reiss, Klebanow even promised to \\"take [their] case to the Supreme Court to get [the] episode aired.\\"Reiss, Mike. (2004). Commentary for \\"A Streetcar Named Marge\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Martin later explained that while the songs made the episode funnier, they also made it harder to write. The Maggie subplot was present in Martin's episode pitch.Jean, Al. (2004). Commentary for \\"A Streetcar Named Marge\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The music in the sequence is Elmer Bernstein's march theme from The Great Escape. Simpsons composer Alf Clausen secured the rights to the score, along with the original orchestra charts. The Great Escape had been Martin's favorite film as a child, and he said \\"it was so exciting and so stirring\\" to hear the music being performed by the Simpsons' studio orchestra. =Animation= \\"A Streetcar Named Marge\\" posed a challenge to the show's animation directors. The episode contains many long set pieces, especially during the third and final act, which includes the end of the Maggie subplot and the performance of the musical. Several scenes required the animators to draw dozens of background characters. Rich Moore, the head director, initially feared the episode would not be completed in time. David Silverman, the supervising director, also had doubts; according to Martin, Moore sent back a cartoon of himself reading the script with his eyes popping out and his jaw dropped. Producer Al Jean said that Moore \\"worked himself to death\\" to produce the episode's most elaborate sequences. A number of scenes that appeared in the storyboard and animatic were reordered or dropped altogether in the final version of the episode. Much of the Maggie subplot, for example, was modified before the episode aired. A scene in which the babies lock Ms. Sinclair in her office is missing from the final version of the episode.Moore, Rich. (2004). Commentary for \\"A Streetcar Named Marge\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. =Voice acting= All the main Simpsons cast members lent their voices to the episode, along with semi-regulars Maggie Roswell and Phil Hartman. Assistant producer Lona Williams also had a minor speaking role. Comedian Jon Lovitz, who played Llewellyn Sinclair and Ms. Sinclair, made his fourth guest appearance on The Simpsons; he had previously voiced characters in \\"The Way We Was\\", \\"Brush with Greatness\\", and \\"Homer Defined\\". Lovitz later worked with Al Jean and Mike Reiss in the animated sitcom The Critic, and returned to The Simpsons for the episodes \\"A Star Is Burns\\", \\"Hurricane Neddy\\", \\"Half-Decent Proposal\\", \\"The Ziff Who Came to Dinner\\" and \\"Homerazzi\\". In 2006, Lovitz was named the eighth-best Simpsons guest star by IGN. Cultural references cameo in The Birds Though Oh, Streetcar! is based on A Streetcar Named Desire, the title of the musical alludes to the theatrical revue Oh! Calcutta!. Besides Blanche and Stanley, characters from A Streetcar Named Desire who appear in Oh, Streetcar! include Stella (played by Helen Lovejoy), the Young Collector (played by Apu Nahasapeemapetilon), Mitch (played by Lionel Hutz), the Doctor (played by Chief Wiggum), Steve (played by Jasper Beardley, although Apu originally said he was playing Steve), and Pablo (originally played by Otto Mann but taken over by Llewellyn prior to curtain). The musical's closing song, \\"Kindness of Strangers\\", is a reference to Blanche's last line in the original play: \\"I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.\\" However, the song is very cheery in tone, intentionally missing the point of Blanche's line, which is meant by the playwright Tennessee Williams to be ironic. The episode contains multiple references to Ayn Rand's novels and Objectivist philosophy. Maggie's daycare center is called the \\"Ayn Rand School for Tots\\", and Ms. Sinclair can be seen reading a book called The Fountainhead Diet, a reference to Rand's novel The Fountainhead. On the wall of the daycare is a poster that reads \\"Helping is Futile\\", an allusion to Rand's rejection of the ethical doctrine of altruism. Another wall sign reads \\"A is A\\", the law of identity, which plays a central role in Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged. The Ayn Rand School for Tots is seen again in the 2012 short film \\"The Longest Daycare\\". The Maggie subplot uses the musical score of The Great Escape and contains several other allusions to the film. At one point, Ms. Sinclair punishes Maggie by sending her to a playpen called \\"the box\\", a play on the solitary confinement facility called \\"the cooler\\" from the 1963 film. Maggie even bounces a ball against the wall of the playpen, as Steve McQueen's character Virgil Hilts does throughout the film while he is in confinement. In the scene when Homer, Bart and Lisa pick up Maggie from the daycare center, babies are perched all over the building, staring at the family and quietly sucking on pacifiers. This is a parody of the final shot of Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds. Indeed, a cartoon-version of Hitchcock can be seen walking his dogs past the daycare, a reference to his own cameo appearance in the film. The episode also contains an allusion to the opera scene in Citizen Kane, in which Homer plays with a shredded playbill while he watches his wife in the musical. Merchandise All the songs from \\"A Streetcar Named Marge\\" were released on Rhino Records' 2000 album Songs in the Key of Springfield. The episode was included in the 1999 VHS set The Simpsons Go Hollywood and released on DVD in 2004 as part of The Simpsons Complete Fourth Season. Jon Lovitz participated in the DVD's audio commentary, alongside Matt Groening, Al Jean, Mike Reiss, Jeff Martin, and Hank Azaria.The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season. 1992–1993. DVD. 20th Century Fox, 2004. Reception The Simpsons creator Matt Groening includes the episode among his favorites. In its original broadcast, \\"A Streetcar Named Marge\\" finished 32nd in ratings for the week of September 27 – October 4, 1992, with a Nielsen rating of 11.8, equivalent to approximately 11.0 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following Married... with Children. Since airing, it has received many positive reviews from fans and television critics. Michael Moran of The Times ranked the episode as the seventh best in the show's history. Entertainment Weekly's Dalton Ross lauded it as \\"the show's best ever musical episode\\", while Dave Kehr of The New York Times called it a \\"brilliant ... parody of Broadway musicals that should be required viewing for every Tony viewer.\\" In a list of his favorite episodes, Kevin Williamson of Canadian Online Explorer added, \\"As pitch-perfect eviscerations of community theatre go, this tops Waiting for Guffman.\\" In 2019, Consequence of Sound ranked it number four on its list of top 30 Simpsons episodes. Series creator Matt Groening has listed it as one of his own favorites, calling the subplot \\"Maggie's finest moment\\", and future Simpsons guest star Trey Anastasio said the episode \\"may have been the best TV show ever\\". Executive producer James L. Brooks also listed it as one of his favorites, saying it \\"showed we could go into areas no one thought we could go into\\". Following the episode, the Ayn Rand Society called Groening to say they were amazed at the references to Rand. They also asked him if the show was making fun of them.Groening, Matt. (2004). Commentary for \\"A Streetcar Named Marge\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In 1993, \\"A Streetcar Named Marge\\" and \\"Mr. Plow\\" were submitted for the Primetime Emmy Award for \\"Outstanding Comedy Series\\". Before this season, the series had only been allowed to compete in the \\"Outstanding Animated Program\\" category, winning twice, but in early 1993 the rules were changed so that animated television shows would be able to submit nominations for \\"Outstanding Comedy Series\\". However, the Emmy voters were hesitant to pit cartoons against live action programs, and The Simpsons did not receive a nomination. The Simpsons' crew submitted episodes for Outstanding Comedy Series the next season, but again these were not nominated. Since then, the show has submitted episodes in the animation category and has won seven times.Emmy Awards official site \\"The Simpsons\\" emmys.org. Retrieved on 2007-09-08. =Controversy= Writer Jeff Martin (pictured here in 1994) received criticism for satirizing New Orleans The musical within the episode includes a controversial song depicting New Orleans, referring to a period in the city's history which existed \\"long before the SuperDome\\" as a \\"home of pirates, drunks and whores\\", among other things. Jeff Martin, the writer of the episode, intended for the song to be a parody of a song in Sweeney Todd, which speaks of London in unflattering terms (\\"There's No Place Like London\\").Martin, Jeff (2004). \\"The Cajun Controversy\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Al Jean later explained that two Cajun characters were supposed to walk out of the theater in disgust, but none of the voice actors could provide a convincing Cajun accent. An early version of the scene can be seen in an animatic included in the DVD boxset.Moore, Rich. (2004). Animatic for the episode \\"A Streetcar Named Marge\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Before the premiere of the fourth season, the producers sent two episodes to critics: \\"Kamp Krusty\\" and \\"A Streetcar Named Marge\\". A New Orleans critic viewed \\"A Streetcar Named Marge\\" and published the song lyrics in his newspaper before the episode aired. Many readers took the lyrics out of context, and New Orleans' then-Fox affiliate, WNOL-TV (then-owned by musician Quincy Jones; the Fox affiliation for the area later moved to WVUE), received about one hundred complaints on the day the episode aired. Several local radio stations also held on-air protests in response to the song. At the urging of WNOL, Fox president Jamie Kellner released a statement on October 1, 1992: The Simpsons' producers rushed out a chalkboard gag for \\"Homer the Heretic\\", which aired a week after \\"A Streetcar Named Marge\\". It reads, \\"I will not defame New Orleans.\\" The gag was their attempt to apologize for the song and hopefully bring the controversy to an end. \\"We didn't realize people would get so mad\\", said Al Jean. \\"It was the best apology we could come up with in eight words or less.\\" The issue passed quickly, and a person in a Bart Simpson costume even served as Krewe of Tucks Grand Marshal at the 1993 New Orleans Mardi Gras. The episode generated further controversy in September 2005, when Channel 4 in the United Kingdom decided to air the episode a week after Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans. Arguing that the episode was an insensitive choice, given recent events, several viewers filed complaints with Ofcom. Two days later, Channel 4 apologized on-air and directly contacted all those who had complained. Channel 4 had screened the episode for offensive content, but the reviews focused on the main content of the episode, and the song was not considered a key part of the plot. Channel 4 promised to update their review process to ensure that similar incidents would not occur.

Background Slender in figure with his arms long and skinny, Yang Chun is nicknamed \\"White Flower Serpent\\" for his appearance. He is a good fighter who uses a long sabre. Originally from Jieliang (解良; in present-day Yuncheng, Shanxi), Yang Chun leads a band of outlaws at Mount Shaohua (少華山; southeast of present-day Hua County, Shaanxi), taking the third position after Zhu Wu and Chen Da.

Befriending Shi Jin One day Chen Da goes to raid the well-stocked Huayin County dismissing objection from Zhu Wu, who fears he would run into the formidable fighter Shi Jin of Shi Family Village. As foreseen by Zhu, Chen is captured by Shi when he tries to get through the village. Yang Chun suggests battling it out with Shi Jin to save Chen Da. But Zhu Wu believes a psychological tactic might work. So the two go to Shi to plead to be arrested as well so as to fulfil their oath of dying together. Moved by their bond, Shi Jin frees Chen Da and befriends the three. Henceforth, the two sides often exchange gifts and visit each other for drink. One day a hunter finds a reply letter from Mount Shaohua on a servant of Shi Jin, who has fallen drunk in a grove after an errand to invite the outlaws to attend a feast at his master's house. The matter is reported to the authorities, which send an arrest party to Shi's house on the night of the gathering. Finding his manor besieged, Shi Jin burns it down and fights his way out with the bandit chiefs.

Upon hearing that, Zhu Wu goes with Yang Chun to plead with Shi Jin to arrest them as well so that they can fulfil their oath of dying together. Moved by their bond, Shi Jin frees Chen Da and befriends the three. Henceforth, the two sides often exchange gifts and visit each other for drink. One day a hunter finds a reply letter from Mount Shaohua on a servant of Shi Jin, who has fallen drunk in a grove after an errand to invite the outlaws to attend a feast at his master's house. The matter is reported to the authorities, which send an arrest party to Shi's house on the night of the gathering. Finding his manor besieged, Shi Jin burns it down and fights his way out with the bandit chiefs. They get to Mount Shaohua safely, where Shi Jin becomes the chief after failing to locate his teacher Wang Jin in Weizhou. Joining Liangshan Shi Jin tries to save a woman abducted by Governor He of Hua Prefecture, or Huazhou, but falls into the latter's trap and is captured. Lu Zhishen, who has come to invite Shi Jin to join the Liangshan Marsh, tries to rescue him but also falls into He's ambush. The Mount Shaohua outlaws turn to Liangshan for help. At Huazhou, the force from Liangshan lure He out of the city and kill him. After Shi and Lu are rescued, the Mount Shaohua bandits, including Chen Da, are absorbed into Liangshan. Campaigns and death Chen Da is appointed as one of the leaders of the Liangshan cavalry after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly. He participates in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces on Song territory following amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan. In the attack on Yuling Pass (昱嶺關; near present-day Zhupu Village, She County, Anhui) in the campaign against Fang La, Chen Da, Shi Jin and four other heroes face the enemy general Pang Wanchun. Pang kills Shi Jin with a shot while his archers rain arrows on Chen and the rest, killing all of them.

Francesco Calogero (born February 6, 1935) is an Italian physicist, active in the community of scientists concerned with nuclear disarmament. Biography He is the son of the philosopher Guido Calogero. After his father was sentenced to national exile by fascist police, Francesco Calogero spent more than one year (1942) in Scanno, a small Italian village. After World War II, Calogero graduated \\"laurea in fisica\\" cum laude at University of Rome La Sapienza, on February 1958. He became Professor of Theoretical Physics, in the same university in 1976. Physics research Calogero's scientific publications in English include five books and over 400 papers (about half with co-authors). His main research concerns integrable many-body problems. Several solvable many-body models and nonlinear evolution partial differential equations (PDEs) are named after Calogero in the mathematical physics literature. He also formulated the Calogero conjecture that quantum behavior is caused by the stochastic component of the local gravitational field due to the chaotic component of the motion of all particles of the Universe due to their mutual gravitational interaction.. He also introduced a novel differential algorithm to evaluate all the zeros of any generic polynomial of arbitrary degree [F. Calogero, “Novel differential algorithm to evaluate all the zeros of any generic polynomial”, J. Nonlinear Math. Phys. 24, 469-472 (2017). DOI: 10.1080/14029251.2017.1375685]. For his profound contributions to the field of exactly solvable models in statistical mechanics and many-body physics, Calogero was a co-recipient of the American Physical Society's 2019 Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics, alongside T. Bill Sutherland and Michel Gaudin. Peace activism Calogero served as Secretary-General of Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs from 1989 to 1997, and from 1997 to 2002 as chair of the Pugwash Council, of which he still is an \\"ex-officio\\" member. He published (in Italian and English--- some with co-authors) nearly 400 papers and several books on world affairs. He was a member of the Governing Board of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute from 1982 to 1992.Members of the Governing Board 1966 to 2006 , Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, retrieved 2010-01-30.

Many of professional cyclists have used Campagnolo components, including Fausto Coppi, Gino Bartali, Eddy Merckx (Merckx was a close friend of Campagnolo and became an iconic symbol of the company), Bernard Hinault, Greg LeMond, Miguel Indurain and Philippe Gilbert. Background Campagnolo was born in Vicenza, Italy in 1901 to a middle-class family, and began his tinkering of inventions at his father's hardware store. In 1922 Campagnolo began his amateur cycling career. He was an avid cyclist riding many races, such as the Giro di Lombardia, Milan–San Remo, and several Olympic heats. While racing through the Italian Dolomites on 11 November 1927, in freezing weather and snow, Campagnolo lost the race due to a wingnut he could not remove to change gears. The title that was lost at the Croce d'Aune pass encouraged Campagnolo to develop the quick release wheel locking mechanism. This quick release skewer, which is in use today, enables a bicycle wheel to be removed and reattached quickly, and was the first of his many inventions from his father's Vicenza workshop for which he is known. Inventions During his life Tullio Campagnolo applied for many patents, and many design registrations (some of these were not in the field of bicycles, or bicycle parts). His designs were extremely influential, and very widely copied. Several companies produced items that were nearly identical in design, but consumers preferred the original as a status symbol, and as a guarantee of quality. In 1930, he patented the cam mechanism quick-release skewer that became the standard for the industry. In 1933, the first quick release hubs were produced by Campagnolo. Also in 1933, he patented the sliding hub, dual seatstay rod-operated, back-pedal derailleur, ultimately known as the 'Cambio Corsa'. In 1949, he introduced the 'Gran Sport' twin-cable, parallelogram rear derailleur at the Milan trade show, the first modern derailleur. Campagnolo was also an innovator in materials engineering for bicycle component design. In 1961, Campagnolo was the first to produce components using low-pressure magnesium casting and he used new aluminum alloys and titanium. In 1966, he patented the Campagnolo self-centering wine-bottle opener. Legacy Campagnolo died in 1983, just after the introduction of the Gruppo del Cinquantenario (50th anniversary Campagnolo groupset). The groupset was mostly made from high-grade aluminium, and had special gold-coloured parts, to distinguish it from the standard production groupsets. Gruppo Number 0002 was presented to Pope John Paul II in a private audience for a delegation of Italian cycling enthusiasts later that year. To mark the 80th year of the Campagnolo company, a special groupset was produced, in a limited production run. This was mostly black-coloured, and partly made from carbon fibre material. In popular culture \\"Tullio\\" is the name of an instrumental song by jazz fusion guitarist Allan Holdsworth from his 1993 studio album Hard Hat Area.

Nicknamed \\"Iron Whistle\\", he ranks 77th among the 108 Stars of Destiny and 41st among the 72 Earthly Fiends. Background The novel depicts Yue He, a native of Maozhou (茅州; present-day Changyi, Shandong), as good-looking. Talented in music, he could play many kinds of instruments and sing well. He is also skilled in martial arts and makes a good spy. His sister is married to Sun Li, the garrison commandant of Dengzhou (登州; in present-day eastern Shandong). Becoming an outlaw One day Yue He, a jailer in the Dengzhou prison, is put in charge of the new prisoners Xie Zhen and Xie Bao. The hunter brothers have been arrested for smashing up the house of one Squire Mao after failing to find a tiger they shot that had fallen into the old man's garden. In fact the squire and his son had sent the tiger to the prefecture office to claim reward. Yue He sympathises with the brothers, knowing they would be murdered in prison. Besides, he is related to the Xies, his brother-in-law Sun Li being the brother-in-law of Gu Dasao, a cousin of the hunters. Gu's husband is Sun Xin, Sun Li's younger brother. Yue He takes the news about the Xies to Gu Dasao and Sun Xin, who pressure Sun Li to join in their rescue plan. They also involve the bandits Zou Yuan and Zou Run. Yue He lets Gu Dasao, who pretends to be sending food to the Xies, into the jail. He then frees the brothers who are locked on a stone bed while Gu causes commotion in the compound. Meanwhile Sun Li breaks into the prison with the rest. After pulling off the rescue, the group kill the Mao family and flee to join the outlaws of Liangshan Marsh. Before going up to the stronghold, Sun Li volunteers to infiltrate the Zhu Family Manor, which Liangshan has failed to take in two offensives. As Sun Li has learnt combat from the same teacher as Luan Tingyu, the martial arts instructor of the manor, he wins the confidence of the Zhus. Yue He, together with Gu Dasao, Sun Xin, Zou Yuan, Zou Run and the Xie brothers, goes on a rampage inside the manor, taking it by surprise, when Sun Li gives his signal. The fall of the Zhu Family Manor is a huge contribution by the group before their acceptance into Liangshan. Campaigns Yue He is appointed as one of Liangshan's scout leaders after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly. When Grand Marshal Gao Qiu attacks Liangshan with a massive military force, he is defeated and captured. But the outlaws free him after he promised to help them secure amnesty from Emperor Huizong. Yue He and Xiao Rang go with Gao to the capital Dongjing as Liangshan's representatives to meet the emperor. However, Gao detains them in his residence and reneges on his promise. Yan Qing and Dai Zong later break into Gao's house and save the two. The outlaws eventually receive amnesty due to help from the courtesan Li Shishi and other court officials. Emperor Huizong sends them on military camaigns against the Liao invaders and other rebel forces on Song territory to atone for their crimes. Yue He participates in the first three expeditions. Before the fourth starts, which targets the rebel Fang La, the emperor summons Yue He back to Dongjing. It turns out that a prince consort has heard of Yue He's musical talent and wants him to be his minstrel. Yue spends the rest of his life in the house of the prince.

The name of the regiment commemorates another older French- speaking Canadian militia light infantry unit, the Canadian Voltigeurs (raised in 1812 and disbanded in 1815). The founder of the Canadian Voltigeurs, lieutenant-colonel Charles-Michel d'Irumberry de Salaberry, was the father of the two men who raised Les Voltigeurs de Québec. The regiment was formed in March 1862, with its headquarters in Quebec City, by the amalgamation into a regiment of eight independent Volunteer Militia Rifle companies. The first of these companies was originally raised in December 1861. Between 1862 and 1867 these companies were frequently disbanded, reformed and renumbered. In 1942 it provided an armoured regiment. The regiment has provided soldiers for service with the United Nations and NATO in places like the Golan Heights, Cyprus, the former Yugoslavia, Egypt, Afghanistan, Sierra Leone and Haiti. Cap badge =Description= The arms of Salaberry within an annulus Vert fimbriated and inscribed VOLTIGEURS DE QUEBEC in letters Argent, all surmounting the cross of the Order of St. Louis Argent, the whole ensigned by the Royal Crown proper and above a scroll Argent inscribed with the Motto in letters Gules. =Symbolism= The Crown represents service to the Sovereign. The Voltigeurs Canadiens (1812-1815), who were organized as a temporary British Army regular unit and commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Charles-Michel d'Irumberry de Salaberry for service during the War of 1812, had the reputation of repeatedly repulsing superior American forces. His son, Lieutenant-Colonel Charles René- Léonidas de Salaberry, was the first commanding officer of the regiment when it was formed in 1862. The badge, incorporating the arms and motto \\"FORCE À SUPERBE MERCY À FOIBLE\\"\\" of the family of d'Irumberry de Salaberry, was adopted in 1892 in recognition of this family's services to the military of Canada and the regiment. The Order of Saint Louis, instituted by King Louis XIV of France in 1693, was a notable honour in New France. \\"VOLTIGEURS DE QUEBEC\\" is a form of the regimental title.

Imlach was born in Calcutta to Scottish parents, although he claimed to have been conceived in Glasgow, Scotland. Although his commercial success was limited, he influenced many other artists, including most notably John Martyn, Billy Connolly, and Christy Moore. In Central and Northern Europe Imlach enjoyed a strong reputation as a vivid live artist. Career He had his biggest hit in the late 1960s with \\"Cod Liver Oil and the Orange Juice\\", a scurrilous and hilarious take on the American gospel standard \\"Virgin Mary Had a Little Baby\\" written by Ron Clark and Carl MacDougall. The song was for a time banned by the BBC as it was assumed to be full of double meanings, but at one point became the most requested song on British Forces Radio. He was described by Ewan McVicar, the Scottish storyteller and singer, as \\"a raconteur who taught Billy Connolly, a singer who taught Christy Moore, a blues guitarist who taught John Martyn\\". Imlach was invited to join the Irish trad and folk group The Dubliners. He was also an early anti-nuclear protester, and wrote and performed protest songs as well as comic ones. After recovering from a serious illness in the 1970s he regularly toured with Iain MacKintosh as well as doing solo tours. For the last 18 months of his professional life his stage partner was Kate Kramer, a Canadian fiddle player and singer living in Scotland, with whom he recorded his last CD, More and Merrier (1996). Personal life Hamish Imlach was married to Wilma, who died on 10 March 2019 and had four children named Mairead, Fiona, Jim and Vhari.

History The regiment was created on 16 January 1863, as the 14th Battalion Volunteer Militia Rifles of Canada from the amalgamation of Kingston, Ontario’s seven independent rifle companies. Shortly after the wedding of the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) to Princess Alexandra of Denmark, the regiment asked for and was given permission to become The Princess of Wales’ Own Regiment. During the Fenian Raid of 1866, when the Irish extremists attempted to bring Britain to her knees by attacking Canada, the regiment was called to active duty, both to Niagara and later to Cornwall. The band mace presented to the regiment by its officers \\"In Remembrance of Cornwall\\" is in the museum. In 1885, during the Riel Rebellion the PWOR was again activated, but not for field service in the West, as it had hoped. It was destined for garrison duties at Tete-du-Pont Barracks (now Fort Frontenac) and Fort Henry. The Boer War, in South Africa, in 1899, again brought members of the 14th to the Colours. A number of members served in various units and because of the 14th’s contribution, “South Africa 1900” became the first battle honour. As a matter of interest, a PWOR officer by the name of Major Wallace Bruce Matthews Carruthers, made his own way to South Africa, after being turned down for South Africa service, in Canada. He was \\"signed-on\\" as a Lieutenant and distinguished himself sufficiently that he was asked to join the regular force. When he returned to Canada, he was asked to set up the Canadian Signal Corps. The outbreak of World War I in 1914, resulted in a response by members of the regiment that was quite remarkable. Very quickly a contingent of 80 men was formed under Captain George T. Richardson, (for whom George Richardson Stadium in Kingston is named—he became the PWOR’s first officer fatality) and sent to the 2nd (Eastern Ontario Regiment) Battalion Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF), of the 1st Canadian Division, which was part of Canada’s First Contingent. At the same time, the 21st Battalion, CEF was formed in Kingston, under the Commanding Officer of the PWOR, Lieutenant-Colonel St Pierre Hughes. The PWOR also contributed officers and men to the 59th, 146th, and 253rd Battalions, CEF. The history of the 21st Battalion, which the PWOR perpetuates, is far too long to relate here, however, it should be mentioned that the unit earned eighteen Battle Honours were won in three years of frontline service. A great deal of the 21st Battalion history, including its Colours, is found in the regimental museum. There is also a photo tribute to the 21st Battalion . The mascot of the Princess of Wales' Own Regiment during the Great War, a white goat named \`Nan\`, retired to the Royal Military College of Canada stables from 1918 until her death on September 22, 1924 at 12 years of age. She was buried in the Cataraqui Cemeteryhttp://21stbattalion.ca/nan.html Nan mascot of Princess of Wales' Own Regiment In 1920, in the post war re-organization of the Militia, the 14th Battalion Rifles was re-designated as a line infantry regiment so that it could carry the Battle Honours and Colours of the 21st Battalion, CEF (A rifle regiment carries its Battle Honours on its drums). The Princess of Wales’ Own Regiment, became allied on 15 July 1926 with the South Lancashire Regiment (Prince of Wales’ Volunteers) who count among their Battle Honours Louisburg and Niagara. In the mid-1960s, the South Lancashire Regiment was amalgamated with other Lancashire regiments to form the present allied regiment - The Queen's Lancashire Regiment. Princess of Wales Own Regiment war recruitment poster In the Second World War, the decision was made not to mobilize the regiment, because of the heavy losses suffered in the First World War. Instead, it provided one complete company to the Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry Highlanders (Glens), which went under canvas at the Kingston fairgrounds. The Glens went ashore on D-Day under a PWOR officer, Lieutenant- Colonel GH Christiansen, as part of the 9th (Highland) Brigade, commanded by another PWOR officer, Brigadier-General Douglas Gordon Cunningham. In June 1942, the 1st battalion PWOR was formed under Lieutenant-Colonel E Cockburn and it served in Sherbrooke, Quebec and Debert, Nova Scotia, where it was deployed for east coast defence. All told, the regiment supplied 1500 men for active service including one Brigadier, four Colonels and eight Lieutenant- Colonels. In 1963, the PWOR celebrated its Centennial, and was granted freedom of the City of Kingston. It was presented with the new Colours by the Lieutenant Governor, the Honorable Earl Rowe. On the Colours was emblazoned the badge of the Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry Highlanders, 1939–1945, commemorating the service of PWOR members in that regiment. The PWOR went through a decline during the 1970s and 1980s, where a measure of a unit’s success was simply the ability to remain active and keep off the increasing list of once proud units now relegated to the supplementary order of battle. The regiment was reduced to a minor unit, with only one authorized company for most of the Seventies, until finally in 1978, it was again elevated to major unit status. The regiment has always acquitted itself well in competition over the years, whether in sports, shooting or skill at arms. In 1895, the Regimental Quarter Master represented Canada at Bisley. His rifle and some of his winnings are on display in the museum. More recently a member of the unit was part of the 1990 Canadian Forces Bisley Team and a member of the unit's Cadet Corps distinguished herself on the same ranges. Today, the regiment is composed of men and women from all walks of life including students, policemen and farmers. Members of the regiment have distinguished themselves on recent peacekeeping tours in Cyprus and the former republics of Yugoslavia. Members of the regiment have also served on combat missions in Afghanistan during Operation Medusa. The Freedom of the City was exercised by the Princess of Wales' Own Regiment in Kingston 4 May 2013.Princess of Wales' Own Regiment Today, the Princess of Wales’ Own Regiment continues to maintain itself as an effective component of the ‘Total Force’ army, preparing to fulfill its role, if called upon, as a first rate infantry unit of the Army's Primary Reserve.

Memorials In May 1917, the officers of the 21st Battalion had a cross built to commemorate their comrades lost in the hard fighting for Vimy Ridge. Private George Williams, a carpenter, salvaged wood from the battlefield to make the cross, ten feet high and three feet across, which was painted white and bore a metal plaque, \\"In Memory of the Officers, NCOs and Men; 21st Canadian Infantry Battalion Killed in Action April 9th 1917\\". The cross was originally erected near Thelus, France. The cross was erected in Sanctuary Wood, and than later on the grounds of the Royal Military College of Canada in the early 1920s. In 1992-1994 the cross was refurbished and moved into the West wall, Regimental Armouries, 100 Montreal Street with the 21st Battalion cap badge at its foot and surrounded by the regiment's 19 then current battle honours. During services held by the regiment and Association every April, the name of every 21st Battalion soldier killed at Vimy is read aloud.Vimy Cross - 21st Battalion The Princess of Wales' Own Regiment Military Museum The museum collects and conserves military artifacts pertaining to the regiment, its antecedents and other militia or military organizations whose roots are found in Kingston.

The community was formed of four clans, being the Abhira (Ahir), Andhaka, Vrishni, and Satvatas, who all worshipped Krishna.Society and religion: from Rugveda to Puranas By Jayant Gadkari, URL((https://books.google.com/books?id=Zst_7qaatp8C&pg;=PA184))While discussing about the Puranic accounts, Hem Chandra Raychaudhuri used the term, Yadava clans for the Andhakas, the Vrishnis and the Kukuras (Raychaudhuri, Hemchandra (1972). Political History of Ancient India, Calcutta: University of Calcutta, p.447fn3). But Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar used the term Yadava tribes for the Satvatas, the Andhakas and the Vrishnis (Bhandarkar, R. G. (1995). Vaisnavism, Saivism and Minor Religious Systems, Delhi: Asian Educational Service, , p.11). They are listed in ancient Indian literature as the segments of the lineage of Yadu (Yaduvamsha).Thapar, Romila (1978, reprint 1996). Ancient Indian Social History: Some Interpretations, New Delhi: Orient Longman, , p.223 At various times there have been a number of communities and royal dynasties of the Indian subcontinent that have claimed descent from the ancient Yadava clans and legendary Yadava personalities, thus describing themselves as the Yadavas.Kosambi, D. D. (1988). The Culture and Civilization of Ancient India in Historical Outline, New Delhi: Vikas Publishing House, , p.116 Amongst the Yadava clans mentioned in ancient Indian literature, the Haihayas are believed to have descended from Sahasrajit, elder son of YaduPargiter, F.E. (1972) [1922]. Ancient Indian Historical Tradition, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p.87. and all other Yadava clans, which include the Chedis, the Vidarbhas, the Satvatas, the Andhakas, the Kukuras, the Bhojas, the Vrishnis and the Shainyas are believed to have descended from Kroshtu or Kroshta, younger son of Yadu.Pargiter, F.E. (1972) [1922]. Ancient Indian Historical Tradition, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, pp.102-4. It can be inferred from the vamshanucharita (genealogy) sections of a number of major Puranas that, the Yadavas spread out over the Aravalli region, Gujarat, the Narmada valley, the northern Deccan and the eastern Ganges valley.Thapar, Romila (1978, reprint 1996). Ancient Indian Social History: Some Interpretations, New Delhi: Orient Longman, , pp.216-7 The Mahabharata and the Puranas mention that the Yadus or Yadavas, a confederacy comprising numerous clans were the rulers of the Mathura region. The Mahabharata also refers to the exodus of the Yadavas from Mathura to Dvaraka owing to pressure from the Paurava rulers of Magadha, and probably also from the Kurus.Raychaudhuri, Hemchandra (1972) Political History of Ancient India, Calcutta: University of Calcutta, pp.127-8 The Haihayas The Haihayas were an ancient confederacy of five ganas (clans), who were believed to have descended from a common ancestor, Yadu. These five clans are Vitihotra, Sharyata, Bhoja, Avanti and Tundikera. The five Haihaya clans called themselves the Talajanghas According to the Puranas, Haihaya was the grandson of Sahasrajit, son of Yadu. Kautilya in his ' mentioned about the Haihayas.Raychaudhuri, Hemchandra (1972). Political History of Ancient India, Calcutta: University of Calcutta, pp.130-1 In the Puranas, Arjuna Kartavirya was mentioned as the most significant Haihaya king. He was called a Samrat and Chakravartin. His name is found in the Rig Veda (VIII.45.26).Misra, V.S. (2007). Ancient Indian Dynasties, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, , p.158 He conquered Mahishmati from Karkotaka Naga and made it his capital.Pargiter, F.E. (1972) [1922]. Ancient Indian Historical Tradition, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p.266 Later, the Haihayas were also known by the name of the most dominant clan amongst them — the Vitihotras. According to the Puranas, Vitihotra was the great-grandson of Arjuna Kartavirya and eldest son of Talajangha. Ripunjaya, the last Vitihotra ruler of Ujjayini was overthrown by his amatya (minister) Pulika, who placed his son, Pradyota on the throne.Raizada, Ajit (1992). Ujjayini (in Hindi), Bhopal: Directorate of Archaeology & Museums, Government of Madhya Pradesh, p.21 The Mahagovindasuttanta of the Dighanikaya mentions about an Avanti king Vessabhu (Vishvabhu) and his capital Mahissati (Mahishmati). Probably he was a Vitihotra ruler. The Shashabindus In the Balakanda (70.28) of the Ramayana, the Shashabindus are mentioned along with the Haihayas and the Talajanghas. The Shashabindus or Shashabindavas are believed as the descendants of Shashabindu, a Chakravartin (universal ruler)Pargiter, F.E. (1972) [1922]. Ancient Indian Historical Tradition, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p.261. and son of Chitraratha, great-great-grandson of Kroshtu. The Chedis The Chedis or Chaidyas were an ancient Yadava clan, whose territory was conquered by a Kuru king Vasu, who thus obtained his epithet, Chaidyoparichara (the overcomer of the Chaidyas)Pargiter, F.E. (1972) [1922]. Ancient Indian Historical Tradition, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p.118. or Uparichara (the overcomer). According to the Puranas, the Chedis were descendants of Chidi, son of Kaishika, grandson of Vidarbha, a descendant of Kroshta. The Rigveda (VII.5.37) mentions a king named Kashu Chaidya.Misra, V.S. (2007). Ancient Indian Dynasties, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, , pp.190-6 The Vidarbhas According to the Puranas, the Vidarbhas or Vaidarbhas were descendants of Vidarbha, son of Jyamagha, a descendant of Kroshtu. Most well known Vidarbha king was Bhishmaka, father of Rukmin and Rukmini. In the Matsya Purana and the Vayu Purana, the Vaidarbhas are described as the inhabitants of Deccan (Dakshinapatha vasinah).Raychaudhuri, Hemchandra (1972). Political History of Ancient India, Calcutta: University of Calcutta, p.83 The Satvatas According to the Aitareya Brahmana (VIII.14), the Satvatas were a southern people held in subjection by the Bhojas. The Satapatha Brahmana (XIII.5.4.21) mentions that Bharata seized the sacrificial horse of the Satvatas.Pargiter, F.E. (1972) [1922]. Ancient Indian Historical Tradition, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p.65. Panini, in his Ashtadhyayi mentions the Satvatas also as being of the Kshatriya gotra, having a sangha (tribal oligarchy) form of government but in the Manusmriti (X.23), the Satvatas are placed in the category of the Vratya Vaishyas. According to a tradition, found in the Harivamsa (95.5242-8), Satvata was a descendant of the Yadava king Madhu and Satvata's son Bhima was contemporary with Rama. Bhima recovered the city of Mathura from the Ikshvakus after the death of Rama and his brothers. Andhaka, son of Bhima Satvata was contemporary with Kusha, son of Rama. He succeeded his father to the throne of Mathura.Pargiter, F.E. (1972) [1922]. Ancient Indian Historical Tradition, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, pp.170-1,171fn2 The Andhakas, the Vrishnis, the Kukuras, the Bhojas and the Shainyas are believed to have descended from Satvata,Pargiter, F.E. (1972) [1922]. Ancient Indian Historical Tradition, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, pp.105-107. a descendant of Kroshtu. These clans were also known as the Satvata clans. =The Andhakas= According to the Ashtadhyayi (IV.1.114) of Panini, the Andhakas were of the Kshatriya gotra, having a sangha (tribal oligarchy) form of governmentThapar, Romila (1978, reprint 1996). Ancient Indian Social History: Some Interpretations, New Delhi: Orient Longman, , pp.303-4 In the Drona Parva (141.15) of the Mahabharata, Andhakas were categorized as the Vratyas (deviators from orthodoxy). According to the Puranas, the Andhakas were the descendants of Bhajamana, son of Andhaka and grandson of Satvata. According to the Mahabharata, the allied army of the Andhakas, the Bhojas, the Kukuras and the Vrishnis in the Kurukshetra War was led by Kritavarma, son of Hridika, an Andhaka. But, in the same text, he was also referred as a Bhoja of Mrittikavati.Law, B.C. (1973). Tribes in Ancient India, Bhandarkar Oriental Series No.4, Poona: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pp.366-73 =The Bhojas= According to the Aitareya Brahmana (VIII.14), the Bhojas were a southern people, whose princes held the Satvatas in subjection. The Vishnu Purana (IV.13.1-61) mentions the Bhojas as a branch of the Satvatas. According to this text, Bhojas of Mrittikavati were descendants of Mahabhoja, son of Satvata. But, according to a number of other Puranic texts, the Bhojas were descendants of Babhru, grandson of Satvata. In the Adi Parva of the Mahabharata (85.3533) and in a passage of the Matsya Purana (34.30) the Bhojas are mentioned as the mlecchas. But another passage of the Matsya Purana (44.69) describes them as pious and the performers of the religious rites. =The Kukuras= Kautilya in his (XI.1.5), describes the Kukuras as a clan, having sangha (tribal oligarchy) form of government, whose leader uses the title of ' (').Rangarajan, L.N. (ed. & tr.) (1992). The Arthashastra, New Delhi: Penguin, , p.822 According to the Bhagavata Purana, the Kukuras occupied the territory around Dwarka. The Vayu Purana mentions that the Yadava ruler Ugrasena belonged to this clan (Kukurodbhava).Law, B.C. (1973). Tribes in Ancient India, Bhandarkar Oriental Series No.4, Poona: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, p.389 According to the Puranas, Ahuka, an Kukura, had two sons by a Kashi princess, Ugrasena and Devaka. Ugrasena had nine sons and five daughters, Kamsa being the eldest. Devaka had four sons and seven daughters, Devaki was one of them. Kamsa usurped the throne of Mathura after imprisoning Ugrasena. But later he was killed by Krishna, son of Devaki, who re-installed Ugrasena to the throne. The Nashik Cave Inscription of Gautami Balashri mentions that her son Gautamiputra Satakarni conquered the Kukuras. The Junagadh Rock Inscription of Rudradaman I includes the Kukuras in the list of the peoples conquered by him. =The Vrishnis= Images of Samkarshana and Vāsudeva, the two most celebrated Vrishni heroes, on a coin of the Indo-Greek king Agathocles (c. 190–180 BCE) The Vrishnis are mentioned in a number of Vedic texts, which include the Taittiriya Samhita (III.2.9.3), the Taittiriya Brahmana (III.10.9.15), the Satapatha Brahmana (III.1.1.4) and the Jaiminiya Upanishad Brahmana (I.6.1). The Taittiriya Samhita and the Jaiminiya Upanishad Brahmana mention about a teacher, Gobala belonging to this clan. Although, Panini, in his Ashtadhyayi (IV.1.114) includes the Vrishnis in the list of the clans of the Kshatriya gotra, having a sangha (tribal oligarchy) form of government, but in the Drona Parva (141.15) of the Mahabharata, the Vrishnis, like the Andhakas were categorized as the Vratyas (deviators from orthodoxy). In the Shanti Parva (81.25) of the Mahabharata, the Kukuras, the Bhojas, the Andhakas and the Vrishnis are together referred as a sangha, and Vasudeva Krishna as Sanghamukhya (seignor of the sangha) According to the Puranas, Vrishni was one of the four sons of Satvata. Vrishni had three (or four) sons, Anamitra (or Sumitra), Yudhajit and Devamidhusha. Shura was son of Devamidhusha. His son Vasudeva was father of Balarama and Krishna. According to the Harivamsa (II.4.37-41), the Vrishnis worshipped goddess Ekanamsha, who, elsewhere in the same text (II.2.12), described as daughter of Nandagopa.Bhattacharji, Sukumari (2000). The Indian Theogony: Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva, New Delhi: Penguin, , p.173 The Mora Well Inscription, found from a village near Mathura and dated to the early decades of the Common era records the installation of the images of the five Vrishni viras (heroes) in a stone shrine by a person, named Tosha. These five Vrishni heroes have been identified with Samkarshana, Vasudeva, Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Samba from a passage in the Vayu Purana (97.1-2). A Vrishni silver coin from Alexander Cunningham's Coins of Ancient India: From the Earliest Times Down to the Seventh Century (1891) A unique silver coin of the Vrishnis was discovered from Hoshiarpur, Punjab. This coin is presently preserved in the British Museum, London.Lahiri, Bela (1974). Indigenous States of Northern India (Circa 200 B.C. to 320 A.D.), Calcutta: University of Calcutta, pp.242-3 Later, a number of copper coins, clay seals and sealings issued by the Vrishnis were also discovered from Sunet, near Ludhiana. The Shainyas or Shaineyas The Shainyas or Shaineyas are believed to have descended from Shini, son of Anamitra, son of Vrishni. In the Mahabharata and the Puranas, the most notable Shaineya was Yuyudhana, son of Satyaka and grandson of Shini. He was a contemporary of Krishna. According to the Puranas, Asanga and Yugandhara were his son and grandson respectively. Akrura and the Syamantaka A number of Puranas mention Akrura, a Vrishni, as the ruler of Dvaraka.Pargiter, F.E. (1972) [1922]. Ancient Indian Historical Tradition, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p.280. His name is found in the Nirukta (2.2) as the holder of the jewel. In the Puranas, Akrura is mentioned as the son of Shvaphalka, who was great-grandson of Vrishni and Gandini. In the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata Purana and the Brahma Purana, he was mentioned as the keeper of the Syamantaka, the most well-known jewel of the Yadavas. According to the Puranas Akrura had two sons, Devavant and Upadeva. =The fratricidal war and its aftermath= Arjuna tells Vasudeva about the destruction of Yadavas and Krishna's message According to the Mausala Parva (7.185-253) of the Mahabharata a few years after the Kurukshetra War, Andhaka-Vrsni Yadava clans of Dvaraka were destroyed due to a fratricidal war. Both Balarama and Krishna died soon after this war. Later, son of Kritavarma became ruler of Mrittikavati and grandson of Yuyudhana became ruler of the territory near the Sarasvati River. The rest of the surviving Yadavas took refuge in Indraprastha. Vajra, great-grandson of Krishna was installed as their king.Pargiter, F.E. (1972) [1922]. Ancient Indian Historical Tradition, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p.284. Vajra is mentioned as the great-grandson of Krishna in the Vishnu Purana. According to a section of this text (IV.15.34-42), he was the son of Aniruddha and Subhadra. But according or another section (V.32.6-7), he was the son of Aniruddha and Usha, daughter of Bana and granddaughter of Bali. Bahu (or Pratibahu) was his son and Sucharu was his grandson. Elsewhere in this text (V.38.34), he was mentioned as installed as king in Mathura instead of Indraprastha. The narrative of the Yadava fratricidal war is also found in two Jataka tales of the Pali Buddhist canon: the Ghata Jataka and the Samkicca Jataka. According to the Ghata Jataka, Vasudeva, Baladeva and eight other Andhaka-Venhu (probably, a corrupt form of Andhaka-Venhi, Pali equivalent to Sanskrit Andhaka-Vrishni) brothers seized Dvaravati and killed its king Kamsa. Later, these brothers fought amongst themselves and except Vasudeva and Baladeva everybody died. Vasudeva and Baladeva also died soon after. The Samkicca Jataka mentions that the Andhaka-Venhus killed each other. Kautilya also in his (I.6.10) mentioned about the destruction of Vrishni clan because of their foolhardiness.Rangarajan, L.N. (ed. & tr.) (1992). The Arthashastra, New Delhi: Penguin, , p.144 Yadava kinship system According to a modern historian, Romila Thapar, the kinship system of the Yadavas shows traces of matrilineal structure, which is found from the mention of their cross-cousin marriages. This is particularly prohibited in the Indo Aryan kinship system.Thapar, Romila (1978, reprint 1996). Ancient Indian Social History: Some Interpretations, New Delhi: Orient Longman, , pp.231,236 The Vishnu Purana mentions that Krishna married Rukmini, a Vidarbha princess. His son Pradyumna married Rukmavati, daughter of Rukmin, brother of Rukmini. Pradyumna's son Aniruddha married Subhadra, granddaughter of Rukmin. The Shurasenas and Krishna worship The Buddhist and Jaina texts list 16 powerful states (shodasha mahajanapada), which flourished in the early 6th century BCE. Shurasena was one of such states mentioned in the Anguttara Nikaya, a Buddhist text. The capital of the Shurasenas was Mathura, which was also known as Madura. Megasthenes (c. 350 – 290 BCE) mentions that the Sourasenoi (Shurasenas), who lived in the Mathura region, worshipped Herakles, by which he may have meant Vasudeva Krishna, the Indian god bearing the closest resemblance to Herakles. The worship of Vasudeva Krishna seems to have originated in the Mathura region. A number of traditions exist regarding the origin of the Shurasenas. According to a tradition, found in the Linga Purana (I.68.19), Shurasenas were descendants of Shurasena, son of Arjuna Kartavirya. According to another tradition found in the Ramayana (VII.62.6) and the Vishnu Purana (IV.4.46), the Shurasenas were descendants of Shurasena, son of Shatrughna, brother of Rama. According to the Devibhagavata Purana (IV.1.2), Shurasena was father of Vasudeva, father of Krishna. Alexander Cunningham in his Ancient Geography of India states that because of Surasena, his grandfather, Krishna and his descendants were known as the Surasenas. Bhasa, in his Balacharita mentions that the mother of Kamsa was a Shurasena (Shaurasenimata). Religious seats Besides chiefdoms and jagirs, the peethams (seats) granted to them by virtue of their religious powers. For instance, there were fourteen seats (peethams) among the Warangal according to a sanad granted in 1425 (Shaka Samvat), by Sree Pratapa Rudra, Maharaja of Warangal, to Sree Kondiah Guru, as the head of the fourteen seats. Subsequently when Bhagyanagar was founded by Sultan Abdulla of Qutub Shahi in AD 1560 the rights of the were acknowledged and recognized, and the name Golkonda was substituted for Manugal. According to the charter awarded by the Sultan Abdullah of Qutb Shahi dynasty in 1071 Hijri, Kondiah built the fort for the sultan by using his charisma in resolving the mystery of the site, and also discovered for him gold coins buried underground. In return, the sultan gave him the Charter conferring upon Kondiah the rights and privileges due to the head of the fourteen seats, and of twelve classes of and two classes of Kondiah, although a follower of, was the head of the Peethams. Perhaps the at this time were under the influence of although they were incorporated into the category. Notes Further reading * Singh, G. P. (1994).

Great War Canadian Expeditionary Force battalions perpetuated by the Lincoln and Welland Regiment include the 81st Battalion, CEF, the 98th Battalion (Lincoln & Welland), CEF, and the 176th Battalion (Niagara Rangers), CEF. History =Perpetuated units – 1794–1863= In 1794, John Butler, who had commanded Butler’s Rangers during the American Revolution was appointed Commanding Officer of three battalions of Nassau Militia. Nassau (later Home District) was one of the Districts of Upper Canada, Niagara being only part of the district. By 1791 the battalions had a strength of 835 all ranks. With the reorganization of the province into sixteen counties in 1792, Lincoln County (with 20 townships) came into existence. The militia was renamed and the Lincoln Militia, with three battalions came into being, some 849 strong. By 1794, Butler was a full colonel with four battalions reporting 976 all ranks. Many of the officers, NCOs and men had served with Butler’s Rangers during the Revolution and had received land grants in Niagara for this service. There is, however, no lineal connection of the Lincoln and Welland Regiment to Butler’s Rangers. By 1808, there were five regiments of Lincoln Militia: * The 1st Regiment of Lincoln Militia, commanded by Col. Ralfe Clench and Lieutenant- Colonel Robert Kerr, drawn from Niagara, Louth and Grantham townships. * The 2nd Regiment of Lincoln Militia, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Ball, drawn from Stamford, Thorold and Pelham. * The 3rd Regiment of Lincoln Militia, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Warren, from Crowland, Willoughby and Bertie. * The 4th Regiment of Lincoln Militia, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Johnson Butler from Grimsby and Clinton. * The 5th Regiment of Lincoln Militia, commanded by Colonel Peter Hare and Lieutenant-Colonel Andrew Brandt from Ancaster, Barton, Saltfleet, Glanford and Binbrook. At the outbreak of the War of 1812, flank companies (limited to three officers and 38 men), of the five regiments took the field in all major engagements from Niagara to Detroit including the Battles of Queenston Heights, Lundy's Lane, Stoney Creek and Fort Detroit. The flank companies took the field together with Militias raised by various former officers including Colonel Isaac Swayze and did most of the militia's fighting. In all cases they were a credit to their country. During the rebellion of 1837, units of the Lincoln Militia were called out to quell rebel uprisings in the Niagara Peninsula and the 2nd Lincolns were warned for duty in Toronto. In 1838, the 2nd conducted marches into the Short Hills to subdue rebel activity there. In 1846, Lincoln County was divided and Welland County was formed with three battalions of militia. The militia \\"regiments\\" were renamed \\"battalions\\". Operational history =Fenian Raids= The 19th Battalion Volunteer Militia (Infantry), Canada was called out on active service on 1 June 1866 and served on the Niagara frontier. The battalion was removed from active service on 22 June 1866. The 19th \\"Lincoln\\" Battalion of Infantry was called out on active service on 24 May 1870 and served on the Niagara frontier. The battalion was removed from active service on 3 June 1870. =Great War= A soldier from the 19th Lincoln Regiment on guard at the Toronto Power Generating Station in 1914The 19th \\"Lincoln\\" Regiment and 44th Lincoln and Welland Regiment were placed on active service on 6 August 1914 for local protection duties with the Welland Canal Force. The 81st Battalion, CEF was authorized on 10 July 1915 and embarked for Britain on 28 April 1916 where it provided reinforcements to the Canadian Corps in the field until 6 July 1916, when its personnel were absorbed by the 35th Reserve Battalion, CEF. The battalion was subsequently disbanded on 27 July 1917. The 98th Battalion (Lincoln & Welland), CEF was authorized on 22 December 1915 and embarked for Britain on 16 July 1916 where it provided reinforcements to the Canadian Corps in the field until 6 October 1916, when its personnel were absorbed by the 12th Reserve Battalion, CEF. The battalion was subsequently disbanded on 17 July 1917. The 176th Battalion (Niagara Rangers), CEF was authorized on 15 July 1916 and embarked for Britain on 29 April 1917. On 9 May 1917, its personnel were absorbed by the 12th Reserve Battalion, CEF to provide reinforcements to the Canadian Corps. The battalion was subsequently disbanded on 30 August 1920. =Second World War= Infantrymen of the Lincoln and Welland Regiment in a canoe, training for the assault on Kapelsche Veer, Netherlands, January 26, 1945 Between the wars, both the Lincoln Regiment and the Lincoln and Welland Regiment were greatly restricted in the training they were able to conduct. For example, the Lincoln Regiment trained 12 days in 1920, 9 days a year between 1922 and 1927, 12 days a year from 1928 to 1931 and 10 days a year from 1932 to 1936. On 15 December 1936, the two units were reorganized into The Lincoln and Welland Regiment with an establishment of 467 all ranks. The regiment was called out on service on 26 August 1939 and then details were placed on active service on 1 September 1939, designated as The Lincoln and Welland Regiment, CASF (Details), for local protection duties. The details were formed as an active service battalion and designated The Lincoln and Welland Regiment, CASF on 15 August 1940. It was redesignated as the 1st Battalion, The Lincoln and Welland Regiment, CASF on 7 November 1940. The unit served in British Columbia, as part of the 13th Infantry Brigade, and in Newfoundland in a home defence role as part of Atlantic Command. On 16 July 1943 the 1st Battalion it embarked for Britain. On 25 July 1944 it landed in France as a part of the 10th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Armoured Division, and it continued to fight in North- West Europe until the end of the war. The overseas battalion was disbanded on 15 February 1946. The highest and most distinguished award for valour, the Order of the Bronze Lion was bestowed upon the regiment's Sergeant Wallace Edmond Firlotte.he is buried in French River (Monetville), Ontario From Tilly- la-Campagne on 31 July 1944 until Bad Zwischenahn on 1 May 1945, the regiment distinguished itself in many actions. Over 1500 men of the regiment were casualties. Of the original men who enlisted in 1940, only three officers and 22 men were on parade in St. Catharines in 1946 when the 1st Battalion was dismissed. =Postwar= A Lincoln and Welland Regiment NCO attached to a rifle company of the affiliated Bermuda Regiment, training in Jamaica, 1996.In the years since the Second World War, the regiment has busied itself with the many tasks traditionally entrusted to the Canadian Militia during peace time. Ceremonial parades have been attended and guards mounted, most notably the visits of The Princess Elizabeth (now Queen Elizabeth II) and Prince Philip to Niagara Falls in 1951 and Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother to Niagara-on-the- Lake in 1981. During the Blizzard of 1977 in the Niagara Peninsula the regiment was called out to provide assistance to the civil authority. It rescued over 1500 stranded school children and provided assistance to countless residents during the emergency. For this assistance, the regiment received a vote of thanks from the House of Commons. The regiment provided volunteers to assist during the 1997 Red River flood and the 1998 Ice Storm in Eastern Ontario and Quebec. The year 1994 marked the 200th anniversary of the regiment and was commemorated in many ways. The trooping the colours, presentation of freedom of the town of Fort Erie and the dedication of the regiment's memorial garden all served to remind the regiment and the community of the service and sacrifice of two centuries. The Lincoln and Welland camp flag, Afghan flag and the American flag in AfghanistanDue to an administrative oversight, two battle honours earned in north-western Germany during the final weeks of the Second World War were not awarded to the regiment until 1995. In October 1995, at the regiment's annual church parade, scrolls commemorating the battles of Küsten Canal and Bad Zwischenahn were presented by members of the regimental association. In 2012, as part of the Diamond Jubilee tour of Canada, Sophie Countess of Wessex presented new regimental colours to the regiment which included the battle honour based on the regiment's perpetuation of the Incorporated Militia Battalion of Upper Canada.Welland Tribune http://www.wellandtribune.ca/2012/09/04/countess-of-wessex-to-visit-regiment- college The regiment also perpetuates the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th Regiments of the Lincoln Militia as well as the Coloured Corps from the War of 1812 thus linking the regiment to the Battles of Detroit, Queenston Heights and the Niagara campaign. =War in Afghanistan= The regiment contributed an aggregate of more than 20% of its authorized strength to the various task forces which served in Afghanistan between 2002 and 2014. Battle honours The regimental colour of The Lincoln and Welland RegimentBattle honours in small capitals are for large operations and campaigns and those in lowercase are for more specific battles. Bold type indicates honours authorized to be emblazoned on regimental colours.

Instead the Regimental march became The Lincolnshire Poacher. Lincoln and Welland Regimental Museum The Lincoln and Welland Regimental Museum, located in Butler's Barracks in Niagara-on-the-Lake, features the history of the Lincoln and Welland Regiment. Exhibits include displays and artifacts from the 18th through the present, and include uniforms, weapons, medals, photographs, regimental band instruments, and other memorabilia. The displays show the regiment's participation in area military engagements in the 18th and 19th centuries, and overseas in World War I, World War II, for peacekeeping and other operations. The Museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, OMMC and Virtual Museum of Canada. However, though affiliated with Virtual Museum of Canada, there is unfortunately no online exhibit for the Lincoln and Welland Regiment.

In his day, he was known as the \\"Father of the Science of Seeing.\\" Luckiesh developed several theories on color and its physiological effect on people. He was also interested in determining the conditions under which optimal visibility was achieved, and in examining the relationship between light and seeing, in order to design better types of lamps. During World War I he studied camouflage, and later invented artificial sunlight and germicidal lamps. Luckiesh produced eleven U.S. patents, 28 books and about 860 scientific and technical articles, published between 1911 and 1960. Asked how to say his name, he told The Literary Digest \\"My name is pronounced as if it were spelled loo'kish. The u in the first syllable is the u in rude, and the second syllable rimes with dish.\\"Charles Earle Funk, What's the Name, Please?, Funk & Wagnalls, 1936. Early life and family After growing up in Cleveland and attending universities in Iowa, Luckiesh returned to Cleveland to start work for the General Electric, Lamp Division in 1910. Luckiesh was married with two daughters and was a Roman Catholic. Lighting pioneer Among the lamps attributed to Luckiesh was the MAZDA Flametint Lamp, which was designed to create mood and to resemble the color of licking flames, rather than to produce adequate light for serious seeing. In 1927 about 25-35% of all lamps sold were of that design, and in 1929 sales totaled about 13 million. Another of his lamps, referred to as the MAZDA Daylight Lamp, had coiled tungsten filaments and transparent blue glass. The lamp approximated average daylight colors and was used in department stores and settings where it was important to determine accurate discrimination of the colors of objects. Luckiesh wrote numerous books and articles on light and other aspects of physics, including Color and Colors, in 1938. In 1940, Luckiesh and Frank Moss compared 5th and 6th grade students in well-lit classrooms to students in regular (poorly lit) classrooms, and found significant increases in the scores on the New Stanford Achievement Test were demonstrated by the students in the well-lit classrooms. However, it is entirely likely that the students in the poorly lit classrooms were of lower socioeconomic status and the schools were poorly funded. This may account for the discrepancy, rather than the difference in lighting conditions. Visibility meter While \\"defining visibility using brightness- contrast as the primary variable\\" in his 1944 book, Light vision and Seeing, Luckiesh presents the 'Visibility Meter', developed in collaboration with Frank Moss. The device, used over a wide range of lighting applications, consists of a pair of similar photographic gradient filters, which increase in density when rotated together before the eyes. The filters thus reduce the apparent brightness of the observed field while lowering the contrast between the object of view and its background. Quotations \\"All things that are visible are not equally visible.\\" \\"Suppose that crippled eyes could be transformed into crippled legs. What heart rending parade we would witness on the busy street. Nearly every other person would go limping by. Many would be on crutches and some on wheel chair.\\" References * A Man from Maquoketa - A Biography of Matthew Luckiesh, Edward J.

It is a resident breeder in tropical Central and South America. Taxonomy The plain antvireo was described by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1823 and given the binomial name Myothera mentalis. The 5 volumes were originally issued in 102 parts, 1820-1839 It is now placed in the genus Dysithamnus which was introduced by the German ornithologist Jean Cabanis in 1847. There are 18 subspecies: * D. m. septentrionalis Ridgway, 1908 – south Mexico to west Panama * D. m. suffusus Nelson, 1912 – east Panama and northwest Colombia * D. m. extremus Todd, 1916 – central Colombia * D. m. semicinereus Sclater, PL, 1855 – west central Colombia * D. m. viridis Aveledo & Pons, 1952 – north Colombia and northwest Venezuela * D. m. cumbreanus Hellmayr & Seilern, 1915 – north Venezuela * D. m. andrei Hellmayr, 1906 – northeast Venezuela, Trinidad * D. m. oberi Ridgway, 1908 – Tobago * D. m. ptaritepui Zimmer, JT & Phelps, 1946 – tepuis of south Venezuela * D. m. spodionotus Salvin & Godman, 1883 – south Venezuela and north Brazil * D. m. aequatorialis Todd, 1916 – west Ecuador and northwest Peru * D. m. napensis Chapman, 1925 – south Colombia to north Peru * D. m. tambillanus Taczanowski, 1884 – north and central Peru * D. m. olivaceus (Tschudi, 1844) – central and south central Peru * D. m. tavarae Zimmer, JT, 1932 – southeast Peru to central Bolivia * D. m. emiliae Hellmayr, 1912 – northeast Brazil * D. m. affinis Pelzeln, 1868 – central Brazil and northeast Bolivia * D. m. mentalis (Temminck, 1823) – southeast Brazil, east Paraguay and northeast Argentina Description The plain antvireo is in length and weighs . The adult male of the nominate race has a slate grey head and upperparts, blackish cheeks, three narrow white wing bars, pale grey underparts and a white belly. The female has olive brown upperparts, a rufous crown, a white eye-ring, yellowish-buff underparts and weakly buff-barred rufous wings. A white (male) or buff (female) shoulder stripe is only visible when the wing is spread. Immature males are much like the adult male, but have brown edgings to the flight feathers, an olive rump and yellowish underparts. Depending on subspecies, there are large variations in the plumage of both sexes, especially in the colour of the underparts (yellow to white), the darkness of the face, the amount of olive to the upperparts of the male, and the amount of rufous to the upperparts of the female. It has a musical buu-bu-bu-bu-u-u-u song, and calls include a weak naaa and a questioning bu-u-u-u-u? Ecology This is a common and confiding bird of primary and secondary forest. The plain antvireo breeds from southern Mexico south to northern Argentina, and on Trinidad and Tobago. It is patchily distributed at the margins of its range and generally (but not universally) avoids the lowlands. In Guyana for example, it is at least locally common above 1,000 meters ASL in the Pakaraima Mountains (though not Mount Roraima), and also inhabits the southern Acari Mountains. On the other hand, it has not been recorded from the Iwokrama Forest or the Potaro Plateau. In Nicaragua where upland habitat is mainly restricted to the northwest, the species occurs only here and there in most of the country. For example, the plain antvireo was found to be common, a few dozen meters ASL, in the Dipteryx oleifera-dominated primary forest of Refugio Bartola in the very south of Nicaragua.Múnera-Roldán et al. (2007), O'Shea et al. (2007) The plain antvireo feeds like a vireo of the songbird family Vireonidae, hence its common name. It forages for small insects and other arthropods taken from twigs and foliage in the lower branches of trees. It usually does not join mixed-species feeding flocks often, preferring to keep its distance from other species it encounters when attending army ant swarms. Locally, however (e.g. as noted in the somewhat atypical habitat of Refugio Bartola), it may attend mixed-species flocks more frequently. But usually, it is encountered in pairs or small groups, such as adults with last years' young or birds congregating at a special food source. Breeding pairs are quite territorial against conspecifics however, and defend a patch of habitat that may be as large as about 7,000 square metres, but sometimes is only half that size.Machado (1999), Duca et al. (2006), Múnera-Roldán et al. (2007), O'Shea et al. (2007) The female lays two cinnamon-marked white eggs in a small deep cup nest in the lateral fork of a sapling. The eggs are incubated by both parents for 15 days to hatching, with a further 9 days to fledging. If the nest is approached, an incubating bird will drop to the ground and flutter weakly to distract the potential predator. During this, the light shoulder stripe is flashed conspicuously to attract the intruder's attention to the parent. Due to its large range, this species is not considered threatened by the IUCN. It appears to be tolerant of some degree of habitat disturbance and/or human activity.BLI (2008), Duca et al. (2006) Footnotes References * Duca, Charles; Guerra, Tadeu J. & Marini, Miguel Â.

Famed gun designer John Moses Browning told Maj. Gen. Julian S. Hatcher of U.S. Army Ordnance that Pedersen \\"was the greatest gun designer in the world\\".Julian S. Hatcher, Hatcher's Notebook, Military Service Publishing Co., 1947. on page 383; Julian S. Hatcher, The Book of the Garand, Washington, DC: Infantry Journal Press, 1948, on p. 67. Early career Pedersen is best known for the 1918 Pedersen device that converted a standard military Springfield 1903 rifle to a semi-automatic, pistol-caliber firearm. He designed several successful sporting guns for Remington, including the novel Model 51 pistol, the Model 10 pump-action shotgun and the Models 12, 14, and 25 pump-action rifles. He collaborated with John Browning to design the Model 17 pump-action shotgun. The Model 17 was a trim, 20-gauge shotgun that was later redesigned and made in three highly successful forms: the Remington Model 31, Browning BPS, and the Ithaca 37. Pedersen designed two well received U.S. military firearms from the 20th century. His .45 caliber automatic pistol, based on the same design as the Model 51, was accepted by the Navy Board for production, but the First World War intervened and Remington tooled to produce the M1911 instead. He also designed a competing design to the M1 Garand rifle. His design utilized a toggle-lock and patented waxed cartridges. The Garand was selected instead. His \\"Pedersen rifle\\" was also trial tested by the British and Japanese between World War I and World War II, but it was not adopted. The ammunition he developed, the .276 Pedersen (7×51mm) waxed round was an experimental 7 mm cartridge developed for the U.S. Army and used in the Pedersen rifle. Pedersen was issued 69 patents listing his home as Wyoming, and others listing Colorado and New York State. World War II During the early days of America's involvement in World War II, Pedersen formed a company with the Irwin family, who owned successful furniture manufacturing concerns in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The Irwin-Pedersen Arms Company in that city was capitalized for $1,000,000.00, by the brothers Robert and Earl Irwin. Primarily through Pedersen's contacts in the Ordnance Department, the Irwin- Pedersen Arms Company received a contract to manufacture over 100,000 M1 Carbines to be produced at the rate of 1,000 per day after the Grand Rapids factory was tooled up and in full production. Unfortunately, due to faulty management and a host of other difficulties, the company failed to achieve mass production and produced slightly over 3,500 M1 Carbines. None of these carbines met Ordnance Department standards and thus none were accepted for the military. In March 1943, the Ordnance Department cancelled the contract it had with the Irwin-Pedersen Arms Company. The Irwin-Pedersen's production facilities were taken over by another contractor, Saginaw Steering Gear Division of General Motors, on April 1, 1943.Larry Ruth, M1 Carbine: Design, Development & Production, The Gun Room Press, 1979, , pp. 99-104, 114-116. Carbines made at Irwin-Pedersen facilities under Saginaw control were marked with either name. Today, Irwin-Pedersen M-1 Carbines are among the rarest versions of the M1 Carbine and as such, I-P Carbines usually command premium prices in collector's circles. Legacy Pedersen's sporting designs for Remington are highly regarded today and prized by shooters and collectors alike. Many of Pedersen's U.S. military efforts were stymied by fate. Although the Navy recommended adoption of his .45 pistol design, the outbreak of World War I led to the design being shelved in favor of the M1911 pistol already in production for the Army. His most famous invention, the Pedersen Device, never had a chance to significantly affect the battles on the Western Front during World War I: the war ended before it could be manufactured in quantity and sent to France to equip the American Army (only 65,000 were produced out of planned production of 500,000). In the 1920s U.S. Army Ordnance selected his .276 Pedersen cartridge to replace the .30-06 in the infantry rifle and tested Pedersen's unique toggle-linked semi-automatic rifle in competitions at Aberdeen Proving Ground. The Pedersen rifle lost out to the rifle designed by John C. Garand. General MacArthur later vetoed the adoption of .276 Pedersen as the new infantry cartridge.Julian S. Hatcher, Hatcher's Notebook, Military Service Publishing Co., 1947.Walter H.B. Smith, Rifles, Military Service Publishing Co., 1948. General George S. Patton owned a Remington Model 51 and was thought to favor the weapon and is seen in many photos of the era wearing it as his personal sidearm. During World War II, John Pedersen's attempts through the Irwin-Pedersen Arms Company to mass-produce M1 Carbines for the U.S. military failed. Personal life and family Pedersen was born in Grand Island, Nebraska, the third of four children of Danish immigrants John H. and Matilda Christine Pedersen. The Pedersen family were ranchers and lived in several western states; they had a family ranch near Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where John Douglas lived after his parents died. Pedersen's education is unknown, according to family records, but it is known he traveled extensively. On March 28, 1921 Pedersen married Reata Canady in Provo, Utah. Canady was born in Greenville, Texas, and her father, a Scot named Loren Canady, was a railroad engineer sent to China, where he worked building a railroad. Canady accompanied him while her mother remained in the San Francisco Bay area. One day he went \\"down the line\\" to deliver a payroll to a railroad crew, and was never heard from again, leaving his now-semi-orphaned daughter to make her way home. She became a violinist protégé of Sir Thomas Lipton, who helped her attend nursing school and becoming an RN at Victoria Hospital, London. According to family legend, Reata was a nurse during World War I, working in a field hospital inside a bombed-out church in Belgium when a German shell hit. She was assisting in a surgery on a wounded soldier, and threw herself over him to keep debris out of his wounds. According to the story, they had to be pulled from the rubble, the soldier survived, and Reata received a decoration from the British government. This event brought her to the attention of an American magazine illustrator, possibly P.G. Morgan, who did 100 oil paintings for the Red Cross of her as a nurse, at night in a field hospital, using a small flashlight to read a patient's thermometer. The painting was supposedly made into the cover illustration of one of the era's magazines. Though there is no documentation known to exist of this tale so far, the actual oil painting does exist, and currently has a place of honor in her granddaughter's home in Waldorf, Maryland. At some point during the war Reata produced short stories and magazine articles under the pen name Reata Van Houten; this much is documented. Her stories include Honor Among Thieves, All-Story Weekly (1917); Fiddler Joe, All-Story Weekly (1919); The Seven Sleeper, All-Story Weekly (1919); and Comrades of the Trail, and Munsey’s (1927). During the 1930s, she wrote articles for Field & Stream and similar magazines on topics like fly fishing. She also became a radio personality, and had her own show on an NBC affiliate, where she was known as \\"The Hostess of the Air.\\" The Pedersens had two children, Eric and Kristi-Ray. They traveled widely, he usually on business related to his gun designing, although their \\"base\\" was the family ranch in Jackson Hole. In the early 1920s, when Eric was about 4 and Kristi-Ray was about 3, they moved to England for several years, while John Douglas did some work for the Vickers company. Prior to her retirement, Reata worked as a nurse at a Goodwill Industries facility in San Diego. At some unknown point, they were divorced. At the time of his death at age 70, Pedersen lived in Blandford, Massachusetts, a suburb of Springfield, home of the Springfield Armory and the Springfield rifle. It is not known if his residence there had any connection to the armory. Typically, though, Pedersen was traveling when he died, of a coronary, while in Cottonwood, Yavapai County, Arizona, near Prescott, where the Pedersens had lived for a time earlier in their lives. Reata Pedersen died in 1969 in San Diego, age 85. In 1946 Pedersen married Christine J. Loomis Bond, a widow, who was superintendent of nursing at a hospital where Pedersen may have been a patient receiving treatment for tuberculosis. At the time of his marriage, he was 65; his new wife was 33 years old. The marriage took place in Concord, New Hampshire. At the start of the Korean War, his son Eric Pedersen joined the United States Marine Corps and served as a lieutenant in combat in Korea. He is memorialized in the book Reckless: Pride of the Marines. Lt. Pedersen led a recoilless rifle platoon and at his own expense purchased a racehorse for use as an ammunition carrier. The horse became famous in the 1st Marine Division.Andrew Geer, Reckless, 1955, Library of Congress Card Number 55-5642 Reckless became the first horse to participate in a Marine amphibious landing, was promoted through the ranks from private to corporal to sergeant, and at the war's end was shipped to Camp Pendleton, California, where she lived out her retirement as a beloved mascot.

They are commanded by a senior retired officer as Governor of the Military Knights of Windsor.  History  The Alms Knights of St. George's Chapel were constituted by King Edward III following the Battle of Crécy (1346), when many knights captured by the French were forced to liquidate their estates to raise ransom money in order to secure their release. At the original establishment of the Order of the Garter and its chapel at Windsor (1348), veteran warriors were called to \\"serve God continually in prayer\\". In the statutes of the College of St. George's, a community of twenty-six bedesmen, called Alms Knights or Poor Knights, were appointed. Their duties included attending four services per day and praying for the sovereign and the knights of the Order of the Garter and rooms.St. George's Chapel Archives and Chapter Library, \\"Military Knights\\", Research Guide No. 2 The Alms Knights were a chantry, a religious foundation organized to pray for its patron. Poor Knights were originally impoverished military veterans. They were required to pray daily for the Sovereign and Knights Companions of the Order of the Garter; in return, they received 12d per day and 40s per year, and were lodged in Windsor Castle. Poverty was an important attribute of bedesmen, and indeed if any Poor Knight were to acquire assets with annual income of £20 or more, he would be removed from the college. King Henry VIII halved their number to thirteen, Elizabeth I re-founded the order in 1559. At his restoration, King Charles II increased the number to eighteen. King William IV renamed them the Military Knights of Windsor in 1833. Today, the Military Knights, who are no longer necessarily poor, but are still military pensioners, participate in the Order's processions, escorting the Knights and Ladies of the Garter, and in the daily services in St. George's Chapel. They are not members of the Order itself, nor are they automatically a knight of any chivalric order. Governor The office of Governor of the Military Knights of Windsor is part of the Royal Household of the Sovereign of the United Kingdom, and dates from the mid-sixteenth century. From 1905 it has been controlled by the Constable of Windsor Castle, having formerly been responsible to the Dean of Windsor. Since 1906 the Governor has always been a senior retired officer.The Military Knights of Windsor, 1352-1944. Historical monographs relating to St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle Volume 4.

Career Raised in Sydney, Australia, Murdoch attended The McDonald College of the Performing Arts, where she studied ballet. After being told by the ballet master, Alan Alexander Cross, that she was too tall and would never make it as a ballerina, she changed direction. Her modeling career began at the age of 17, after getting signed to Vivien's Management in Sydney. Soon after she moved to Paris and started working as a runway model for Karl Lagerfeld, Issey Miyake, Chanel, Emanuel Ungaro, Gianfranco Ferré, Givenchy, Alberta Ferretti, Kenzo, Valentino and Oscar de la Renta. She appeared in campaigns for Bonds, L'Oréal, Revlon, Ralph Lauren, Yves Saint Laurent, and Estée Lauder, as well as the 1999 and 2003 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issues. Her magazine covers include Vogue, Elle, Marie Claire, Glamour, GQ and Harper's Bazaar. She has appeared on magazine issue covers in Australia, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Murdoch filled in for Jessica Rowe on the popular morning news and interview show, Today while Rowe was taking four months maternity leave. On 26 March 2007, it was reported in The Sydney Morning Herald that Murdoch would finish up her hosting duties on Today as of 30 March 2007. Nine News presenter Kellie Sloane replaced Murdoch until May 2007, when Lisa Wilkinson took over as the new co- host on Today. Murdoch returned as a guest host on the 4 October 2007 episode, alongside Karl Stefanovic, to raise awareness about breast cancer as she is a patron of the National Breast Cancer Foundation. Murdoch starred with fellow supermodel Shalom Harlow in the romantic comedy Head Over Heels. She also appeared on an episode of popular sitcom, Friends (S07E07). =Australia's Next Top Model= Murdoch replaced Jodhi Meares as host of Australia's Next Top Model after Meares infamously blundered her way through the third season's live finale in 2007 and flat-out refused to appear in 2008's finale. In addition to hosting Top Model and an executive producer on the show, Murdoch also inked a deal with Foxtel to create documentaries with her production company, Room 329 Productions. She experienced media scrutiny during the 2010 Australia's Next Top Model Grand Final for announcing an incorrect winner. On 12 December 2011, Murdoch announced that she is leaving Top Model after three seasons. =Pride of Australia= Screened in November 2009, Murdoch and her production company Room 329 Productions, along with Foxtel, produced 4 episodes of Pride of Australia with Murdoch herself as host. The program tells inspiring stories of everyday Australians exhibiting acts of great courage, love and determination when faced with adversity. The stories were taken from thousands of people nominated to News Limited papers across Australia. =Everybody Dance Now= Murdoch hosted the Network Ten reality dance programme Everybody Dance Now in August 2012; however, due to poor ratings, the series was axed after just four episodes.

The Baháʼí teachings state that since all humans have been created in the image of God, God does not make any distinction between people regardless of race or colour. Thus, because all humans have been created equal, they all require equal opportunities and treatment. Thus the Baháʼí view promotes the unity of humanity, and that people's vision should be world-embracing and that people should love the whole world rather than just their nation. The teaching, however, does not equal unity with uniformity, but instead the Baháʼí writings advocate for the principle of unity in diversity where the variety in the human race is valued. Oneness The Baháʼí teaching of the unity of humanity (also known as the oneness of humanity) stems from the teaching that all humans have been created equal in the image of God, and that God does not make any distinction between people. The teaching emphasizes the unity of humanity transcending all divisions of race, nation, gender, caste, and social class, while celebrating its diversity. The Baháʼí writings states that since the human race is one unified organic unit, all people have the same basic capacities, and that the physical differences, such as skin colour, are superficial and do not make one ethnic group superior to another. In the Baháʼí view, humanity has always constituted one group, but that ignorance, prejudice and power-seeking have prevented the recognition of the oneness of humanity. The historical differences that have existed between different ethnic groups is attributable to differences in education and cultural opportunities over a long-term, as well as to racial prejudice and oppression. =Unity in diversity= In the Baháʼí view, unity does not equal uniformity, but instead the Baháʼí writings advocate for the principle of unity in diversity where the variety in the human race is valued. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, compared the human race to a flower garden where the garden was made more beautiful by its diversities of colour and form. The Baháʼí writings note that unity will not be arrived at through the suppression of difference, but instead when each respects the intrinsic value of other individuals and cultures. In this view, it is not the diversity that causes conflict, but rather people's intolerance and prejudice towards diversity. The cultural norms in the religion have gone through major transitions. In the later 1930s and 1940s Baháʼís in the West began a systematic implementation of the Tablets of the Divine Plan towards Latin America. At a certain stage of the process regional coordinating committees were appointed and a stated purpose for them was to facilitate a shift in the balance of roles from North American leading guidance and Latin cooperation to Latin leading guidance and North American cooperation. The process was well underway by 1950 and was to be enforced about 1953. By 1961 most Latin and South American countries had their own national assembly. See Baháʼí Faith in Latin America. Almost in parallel with this process in the West in the East Baháʼís in India were embarking on a comparable process. The Baháʼí message had for decades been primarily addressed to Indian Muslims and Parsees (Zoroastrians), a re-interpretation of the Baháʼí message in accordance with Hindu ideas was undertaken to reach the masses of Hindus. In two more years almost as many people converted as had been Baháʼís through regions of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat. By 1970 there were 3,350 assemblies and over 312,000 believers. See Baháʼí Faith in India. While those early processes continued locally international attention shifted to Africa for Baháʼís in the West and East. In Africa there was widespread conversions to the religion following the 1950s. It was emphasized that pioneers be self- effacing and focus their efforts not on the colonial leadership but on the native Africans \\\\- and that the pioneers must show by actions the sincerity of their sense of service to the Africans in bringing the religion and then the Africans who understand their new religion are to be given freedom to rise up and spread the religion according to their own sensibilities and the pioneers to disperse or step into the background. See Baháʼí Faith in Africa. Since then other examples of this pattern of growing respect for cultures has taken hold in specific instances. Unlike the spread of Christianity within Indian country, in the United States, the Baháʼí Faith has never been associated with a fortification of colonial occupation, Euro-American assimilation, or forced conversions of Native Americans. Indeed, in 1960 Hand of the Cause Rúhíyyih Khánum asked for forgiveness for the injustices her race had done and praised the great past of the native peoples. And in 1963 anthropologist Alice Beck Kehoe, a well known researcher of Native Americans, observed that the Baháʼí Faith is considered by its members to be a universal faith, not tied to any one particular culture, religious background, language, or even country of origin. See Baháʼí Faith and Native Americans. In Papua New Guinea whereas Christian missionaries openly opposed traditional funerary art and performances, the Baháʼís encouraged their production as a form of worship. Thus while Nalik Baháʼís are regarded by other Naliks as arbiters of traditional knowledge and practices, the Christian missions and their followers are seen as antagonistic to kastom. See Baháʼí Faith in Papua New Guinea. =Elimination of prejudice= One of the main principles of the Baháʼí Faith that comes about from the unity of humanity is the elimination of all forms of prejudice, and it entails non-discrimination against individuals on such things like race, religion, gender or class. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá states that while the challenge is large, social prejudices including religious, political, and patriotic lead to war, and thus the elimination of prejudice was essential for human well-being. In that regard, the Baháʼí teachings state that the elimination of all forms of prejudice is a fundamental requirement to achieve world unity and peace. Two prime examples of this in action exist - one comes from the American South, and the other from South Africa. Arriving in the face of the rise of Jim Crow laws and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan as a broad-based national movement and in contrast to Protestant, Catholic and Jewish organizations in South Carolina, the Baháʼís explicitly promoted racial integration from the local level up. Called by the scriptures of their faith to “associate with all the peoples and kindreds of the earth with joy and radiance,” they deliberately sought converts from diverse backgrounds, forging bonds of shared religious identity across traditional social boundaries even when their meetings were raided. By the end of the twentieth century, the Baháʼí Faith was the largest non-Christian religion in South Carolina, and it was well known for its longstanding commitment to promoting racial harmony, interfaith dialogue, and the moral education of children and youth. In South Africa, faced with the segregated social pattern and laws of Apartheid, the integrated population of Baháʼís had to decide how to be composed in their administrative structures - whether the National Spiritual Assembly would be all black or all white. The Baháʼí community decided that instead of dividing the South African Baháʼí community into two population groups, one black and one white, they instead limited membership in the Baháʼí administration to black adherents, and placed the entire Baháʼí community under the leadership of its black population. In 1997 the National Spiritual Assembly presented a Statement to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa which said in part: > Abhorring all forms of prejudice and rejecting any system of segregation, > the Baháʼí Faith was introduced on a one-to-one basis and the community > quietly grew during the apartheid years, without publicity. Despite the > nature of the politics of that time, we presented our teachings on unity and > the oneness of humankind to prominent individuals in politics, commerce and > academia and leaders of thought including State Presidents.... [b]oth > individual Baháʼís and our administrative institutions were continually > watched by the security police.... Our activities did not include opposition > to the previous Government for involvement in partisan politics and > opposition to government are explicitly prohibited by the sacred Texts of > our Faith.... During the time when the previous Government prohibited > integration within our communities, rather than divide into separate > administrative structures for each population group, we opted to limit > membership of the Baháʼí Administration to the black adherents who were and > remain in the majority of our membership and thereby placed the entire > Baháʼí community under the stewardship of its black membership.... The > pursuit of our objectives of unity and equality has not been without costs. > The \\"white\\" Baháʼís were often ostracized by their white neighbours for > their association with \\"non-whites\\". The Black Baháʼís were subjected to > scorn by their black compatriots for their lack of political action and > their complete integration with their white Baháʼí brethren. The most tragic > loss to our community was the brutal execution of four of our adherents, at > our places of worship, three in Mdantsane and one in Umtata. Political unity An essential mission in Baháʼu'lláh's, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, teachings was to bring about a consciousness in the peoples of the world regarding the oneness of humankind. However, Baháʼu'lláh stated that along with the increase in individual and collective consciousness of the oneness of humanity, new social structures are also needed for the oneness of humanity to be achieved. He wrote: The Baháʼí teachings thus state that it is not sufficient that humanity acknowledge its oneness and still live in a disunited world that contains prejudice and conflict. In Baháʼí belief, humanity has gone through a process of progressive revelation through various different messengers of God, including Buddha, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad and others, where humanity has grown collectively. In this belief, society has been steadily organizing itself with higher levels of unity through the various messengers of God; going from the unity of the family, the tribe, the city-state and the nation. The Baháʼí writings state that the next stage of the collective growth is that of world unity and the organization of society as a planetary civilization. Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Baháʼí Faith in the first half of the 20th century, wrote: Thus in the Baháʼí view, unity must be expressed by building a universal and unified social system that is based on spiritual principles. In this view, the fundamental purpose of society is spiritual and is to create a society that is favourable to the healthy development of all its peoples.

Opening in 1980 as the Shenandoah Hotel, the property was plagued with licensing and financial difficulties from the start. Ownership changed hands several times, with new proprietors often envisioning major renovations or redevelopment, but none of the plans came to fruition. Finally, in 2005, it was bought by Harrah's Entertainment (later Caesars Entertainment), who closed and demolished it. History =Shenandoah Hotel (1980-1985)= The Shenandoah Hotel began as a $29-million project, named after the Las Vegas estate of singer Wayne Newton, who was a minority investor in the property. The hotel opened in February 1980. The opening of the casino was delayed, however, because of a Gaming Commission investigation into Shenandoah president John Harlow Tucker for a 1975 securities fraud conviction. Tucker's gaming license was ultimately denied, and he was ordered to sell his $1.8-million stake in the property. Newton also pulled out, opting instead to buy the Aladdin casino. The Shenandoah's landlord, Allarco Holdings of Edmonton, took over the project, and sought new investors to buy or lease the hotel, which was losing $500,000 a month. Allarco was acquired in January 1981 by Carma Developers, a Calgary-based real estate company. Carma spent over two years trying unsuccessfully to sell the Shenandoah, before deciding to seek a gaming license to open the casino itself. Nevada passed a law in June 1985 to enable foreign companies to receive gaming licenses, and, weeks later, Carma was the first to take advantage of the new law. The property was reopened and rebranded as the Bourbon Street Hotel and Casino. =Bourbon Street Hotel and Casino (1985-2005)= In January 1988, Carma sold Bourbon Street to Las Vegas Investors Ltd., a firm run by two top executives of Hotel Investors Trust (now Starwood Hotels). The following month, the firm turned around and sold the property to Hotel Investors Trust, along with the King 8 Hotel, for a total of $35 million. An agreement was announced in July 1995 to sell the property to Crown Casino Corp. for $10 million. However, Crown abandoned the deal in November, losing a $500,000 deposit, citing the possibility of more attractive opportunities, a lack of attractive financing, and declining profits at the property. In August 1996, Starwood sold the property to Tarsadia Hotels for $7.8 million in cash plus $1 million in assumed debt. Starwood cited a strategic focus on \\"full-service, high-quality hotels.\\" Tarsadia closed the property's casino and laid off its 400 workers, avoiding the complication of applying for a gaming license for its owner, Tusher Patel, who was not a U.S. citizen. Patel planned to build a timeshare tower on the site, in partnership with an unidentified major casino company, but the plan was scrapped when the partner pulled out. In August 1997, Tarsadia agreed to sell Bourbon Street to Florida Gaming Corp., a jai alai operator, for $13 million in cash plus $1.5 million in stock. The near-doubling of the hotel's value in the span of a year was attributed to rising property values on the Strip. Florida Gaming planned to spend $6.5 million renovating the site. However, the sale was never completed. In April 2001, Tarsadia sold Bourbon Street to a partnership of Dallas-based real estate investor Michael Block, and the Red Sea Group of El Segundo, California, with a declared property value of $11 million. With the property losing money, the partners immediately began discussions to redevelop or sell it. In 2003, Block began negotiating with Trevor Pearlman and Reagan Silber of Edge Resorts. Block bought Red Sea's stake in the partnership for $10.55 million and sold it to Pearlman the same day for $12.5 million. Four months later, Block sold his stake to Silber for $14 million. Block had not informed Red Sea of his negotiations with Edge, leading Red Sea to successfully sue Block. Edge Resorts planned to build the W Las Vegas condo- hotel project on the site, in partnership with Starwood. However, even after buying an adjacent apartment complex, bringing the site to 8 acres total, they decided they needed more space, and bought a 21-acre lot on Harmon Avenue. Edge sold Bourbon Street and adjacent properties to Harrah's Entertainment in March 2005. Records filed with the county listed the total property value at $60.6 million. Harrah's decided to close Bourbon Street effective October 31, 2005. On October 18, however, a water main broke, threatening the building's structural integrity, and the property closed early. Demolition work began the following January, and the tower was imploded on February 14, 2006. Between 2005 and 2007, Harrah's had consolidated control of much of the east side of the central Strip, also acquiring the Imperial Palace, Barbary Coast, and much of the residential Flamingo Estates neighborhood north of Bourbon Street. CEO Gary Loveman envisioned a mega-resort called Epicentre for the company's 350 acres. As of 2018, the site is being used as a surface parking lot for employees of The Cromwell Las Vegas. Facilities Bourbon Street had 166 hotel rooms, including 16 suites. The casino was . As of 1995, it had 420 slot machines and 15 table games. By the time it closed in 2005, it had just 100 slot machines, managed by slot route operator United Coin.

She was awarded with a Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award for contributions to Latin music. She has sold millions of records throughout her career, with styles that range from melodic songs to pop. She often appeared in various musicals such as the Spanish-language premiere production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Evita in Madrid. Some other musical theater works include Man of La Mancha, My Fair Lady, Victor/Victoria, and Sunset Boulevard. She announced her retirement in 2013, touring in Europe and America. She is currently doing a symphonic tour in Colombia, where she will be stopping in Armenia, Cali, Bucaramanga, Pereira, Bogotá, Medellín and Manizales as one of her last musical projects in her artistic life.  Life  In the early 1970s, she married the athlete Ignacio Gómez Pellico; they divorced shortly after. She had a daughter from that marriage, Ivana. Paloma later started a relationship with businessman Claudio Rey; they have been together for over 30 years. Paloma prefers to keep her personal and private lives separated. She rarely speaks about her private affairs, yet she is respected by journalists. She has a cordial relationship with the press, and she received the award Premio Naranja in the ‘80s, an award granted by journalists to those public figures with whom they better relate.  Career  Paloma San Basilio was born in Madrid, lived her childhood in Seville and her adolescence in Lugo. Before she started her artistic career in 1975, she began her studies of Philosophy and Psychology at the Complutense University of Madrid but never completed them. = Early years = During the first years of the 70's, she hosted the TV show Siempre en domingo and worked as an actress in a zarzuela show called Divertido siglo. In 1975 she recorded her first album “Sombras”, which was an international hit including her own songs as well as classic songs like “The Way We Were”, “The Long And Winding Road” or “Feelings”. Her following album, \\"Dónde vas\\" (1977) included more dynamic tunes, composed by Bebu Silvettu, and also ballads like \\"Dónde vas\\", that gave the record its name and that was pre- selected to represent Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1977. Her influences are very diverse—from artists like The Beatles, Sarah Vaughan, Billie Holiday or Barbra Streisand to artists that she often listens to in her stay in Seville, like Lola Flores or Gracia Montes, which makes it impossible to categorize her in any musical genre. October 23, 1978 she recorded in the Teatro Monumental in Madrid her album \\"En Directo\\", where we can find one of her most popular songs “Beso a Beso… dulcemente”, as well as versions of classic solo international women songs — such as I Say a Little Prayer (Aretha Franklin), People (Barbra Streisand), Parole Parole (Mina) and \\"Sweet Sadie the Savior\\" (Patti Austin). Also in 1978 the album was republished for the Latin-American fans, including versions like “Ahora” (\\"Ancora, ancora, ancora\\", from the Italian singer Mina) and “Sobre el arcoiris”, from The Wizard of Oz (Over the Rainbow) that she recorded in Spanish. She also added a self-written song, “Atardecer”. There were two singles in the album. The first one, “Secretos”, from Bebu Silvetti and Miguel Tottis, is a disco song with high notes. The second one, Beso a beso... dulcemente, which was also the name of the album, became one of her most successful hits and is now a classic in her repertory. = Evita and Eurovision Song Contest = In December 1980 she released the musical Evita in many theaters like Madrid, Barcelona, San Juan de Puerto Rico, Mayagüez, Ciudad de México, Caracas, Panamá, Santo Domingo, San José, Bogotá, Quito, Lima, Santiago de Chile and Miami with huge success. Paloma's fame was in ascent not only in those countries she visited, but also in those where her play Evita did not arrive due to political problems, which was the case of Argentina, where a military dictatorship had taken over the country at that time. Her outstanding performance in Evita made both the character and the actress become closely related. It was released both in a double disc and in a single disc edition. Andrew Lloyd Webber himself, one of the authors of the play, praised and depicted Paloma as one of the best Evita's performances. According to the critics of the moment, she created this character such a way, that hat not existed in her predecessors. Again, her vocal abilities were surprising in songs such as \\"Buenos Aires\\", \\"La Nueva Argentina\\" or \\"Vals para Eva y Ché\\". When Oliver Stone was going to shoot the film, something he never got to do, Paloma was one of the soundest candidates to interpret Eva Perón. Evita was performed for a two-year period, during which her next two studio albums were released. \\"Ahora\\" (1981) increased even more its popularity with songs like the famous \\"Juntos\\", \\"La Hiedra\\", \\"Recuerdos (Memory)\\" (main theme of the musical Cats and \\"El Inmenso\\" (with arrangements slightly different from the ’78 release). This album is one of the most celebrated of the singer and includes a beautiful photo shoot, made by the photographer Antonio Molina. It meant her return to the discographic world, after a three-year break. \\"Dama\\", her following album (1983), became famous for songs like \\"Dama\\", \\"El aire del sábado tarde\\" and other rhythmic sounds such as \\"Bailando\\", \\"Fiesta del interior\\" and \\"Unas vacaciones\\". Between 1983 and 1984, she started in Puerto Rico a triumphant series of tours throughout Latin America, and on her return to Spain she presented her new work \\"Paloma\\", which was already a hit in Latin America with \\"Por qué me abandonaste\\" and was one of her best-selling works. Synthesizers and instruments could be heard in this album, that were very common at the time. She was also co-author of several of her themes, something she would often do in the years that were to come. In 1985 she participated in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song \\"La fiesta terminó\\", name of her new album composed and produced by Juan Carlos Calderón. By then Eurovision took place in the Swedish city of Gothenburg and was an important thing for her career, despite of not getting very high score in the ranking. According to her style, she included versions of classics like \\"Sin ti (Without You)\\" original of the Welsh band Badfinger, \\"We're All Alone\\", of Rita Coolidge, adapted with the title \\"Impaciencia\\", or \\"Que Va Que va\\" (the classic song \\"Manureva\\" by Serge Gainsbourg). Within the Televisión Española Channel TV series La comedia musical española she starred Las Leandras and La Cenicienta del Palace and took part in a third TV series, El sobre verde, where she interprets the Fortune Goddess and sings \\"De una monedita de oro\\". Those three were published in the collection \\"La Revista\\" of Hispavox. Even today, it is usual for Paloma to perform \\"Los Nardos\\" in her concerts, a melody included in Las Leandras. She hosted the show \\"En vivo\\" at the Teatro Monumental in Madrid, with the release of a successful double album. She sang for those affected by the earthquake in Mexico and by the volcano Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia both in 1985. She hosted the OTI Festival with Emilio Aragón and throughout that year she could be heard on the radio with songs like \\"Por culpa de una noche enamorada\\", \\"Como el viento\\", \\"El beso de tu boca\\", \\"Impaciencia\\" and \\"Sin ti\\". Since then, her tours and presentations went on, giving the best out of herself in each of them; she took great care of the character, costumes, the stage, choreography, repertoire, lightning, etc., which made her highly valued by critics and public as they were great shows; very similar to those made in the United States. Juan Carlos Calderón produced her new work, \\"Vuela alto\\", in 1986, where \\"Cariño mío\\" excels. This show was again one of the best- selling albums of her career, given the quality of her compositions. Vuela alto was also the name of the world tour that broke box-office records. In the following years, Paloma continued to release records continuously; \\"Grande\\" (1987), awarded with a Platinum album and the tour under the same name kept the star on tour for more than 6 months, including a version of the song from Theodorakis \\"Luna De Miel\\", as well as Obregón Pareja's songs, Mendo and Fuster (successful authors of \\"Puerta de Alcalá\\"), Albertelli, Rosa Girón, KC Porter, Armando Manzanero, etc. There were two versions of this album—one for the American market with \\"Los Sueños Son Tan Grandes\\" and another one for Spain, where the song was replaced by \\"La tragedia de Eva\\". It's followed by \\"Life\\" (1988), album that was released in Latin America without the song “Bienvenido al Paraíso\\" and that includes in its CD format an extra song titled \\"Amor Diablo\\". It also includes a version of Pat Benatar's classic \\"We Belong\\" (Mi Pasión), the Spanish song of Los Miserables \\"On My Own\\" or a compendium of fragments of songs like \\"Bésame Mucho\\", \\"The Fool On The Hill\\", \\"Alfonsina y El Mar\\", \\"No te mires en el río\\", \\"Music \\"... all together in a fantastic song called \\"Música\\" which shows the restlessness and admiration that the singer feels for this eclectic kind of music. = 1990 = San Basilio in Atlantic City, New Jersey in 1992 To celebrate her 15-year-career in 1990, she simultaneously recorded and edited two albums; \\"Nadie como tú\\", for Latin America (from which the enormous success “Demasiado herida” stands out) and \\"Quiéreme Siempre\\" for Spain. From this last album, the song \\"Un largo camino\\" duet with CRAG is highlighted, as well as one of the best versions that has ever been made of “Wind Beneath My Wings” from Bette Midler. On March 3, 1991, she performed a duet concert with the tenor Plácido Domingo in Miami, which was edited in video and LP and reached multimillion-dollar sales and that was, in the words of the performer herself, one of the most wonderful experiences of her life. She sings Zarzuela pieces like \\"la Revoltosa\\" in it, Operetta, like “Vals de la Viuda Alegre”, American musicals, like \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" or \\"New York, New York\\", boleros, tango, Hispano- American songs and, of course, her extraordinary interpretation of \\"No llores por mí, Argentina\\" (from Evita). Paloma continued her success with productions such as \\"De mil amores\\" (1991), which included songs such as \\"Orí Oro\\", \\"No Quiero Arrepentirme\\", \\"De Mil Amores\\" or \\"Un Gran Amor\\". This work has been made simultaneously with \\"Paloma Mediterránea\\" (1992), in which she recreated the song \\"Mediterráneo\\" by Serrat and others like \\"Apres Toi\\" by Vicky Leandros, \\"El Concierto de Aranjuez\\" by Joaquín Rodrigo or \\"Himno al Amor\\" by Édith Piaf. The first album was released for the American market only and the second one for Spain. Two years later, she released \\"Al Este del Edén\\" (1994), album including songs from unknown young authors and which was one of the singer's favorites. That same year she performed a duet concert with the tenor José Carreras, with 20,000 people in Bogotá. \\"Como un sueño\\" (1995) celebrates her 20-year career and led her to touring for about twenty months. This concert was published in a double CD for Spain and was reduced to a single CD in Latin America. Different celebrities joined in, such as Estela Raval, Gloria Lasso, Cristina del Valle (from the duet Amistades Peligrosas), El Dúo Dinámico, El Consorcio and Juan Pardo. In 1997, Paloma sang pieces from classical musicians like Beethoven, Pachelbel or Massenet in her new work \\"Clásicamente tuya\\", which was released in early 1998 in Latin America with a different cover and did not include the song \\"Meditación\\". In November 1997, after 17 years, she resumed her performance in the musical El hombre de La Mancha with José Sacristán, which broke box-office records. This musical was also released in a double CD, and played for 2 years in Madrid, 1 month in Barcelona and 2 months in Buenos Aires. In 1999 she announced \\"Perlas\\", a pop- style recording based on versions of Anglo-Saxon classics adapted to Spanish (\\"You've Got a Friend\\", \\"Un-break my heart\\", \\"Immortality\\", \\"Let the River Run\\", \\"Angel of Mine\\", etc.), where Paloma first sings with her daughter Ivana Vanessa Gómez the song \\"Calling you\\". = Decade of the 2000 = In 2000 Paloma left EMI (her lifelong record label since 1984) and released with Sony her bolero album called \\"Escorpio\\" in 2001. Produced by Bebu Silvetti, it became very popular in America. This album included the first Spanish version of Michael Bolton famous song \\"How Am I Supposed To Live Without You\\", as well as songs like \\"No Ha Pasado Nada\\" by Armando Manzanero and a Medley of Brazilian music songs (\\"Voce Abusó\\", \\"Aguas De Marzo\\", \\"Mais que Nada\\"). In 2001 she also returned to theaters performing in My Fair Lady, again with José Sacristán. The musical played for 19 months at the Teatro Coliseum in Madrid, achieving the well-deserved recognition for great artist in a difficult genre like musicals, and received the title of \\"Queen of the Musical\\" by the Spanish critic. A CD was released from that musical. In 2002, she recorded and edited an album with songs of musicals, \\"Eternamente, grandes éxitos de grandes musicales\\", for the company Ventura Discos SL, with songs from some of the musicals she interpreted herself. It highlights an impeccable version of \\"Summertime\\", as well as the song from Jesus Christ Superstar, \\"Es más que amor\\" (\\"I don't know how to love him\\"), which had become popular by Ángela Carrasco. This album, despite reuniting hits from musicals like Evita, The Phantom of the Opera, Porgy and Bess, Jesus Christ Superstar, Cats or Sunset Boulevard, did not have huge success perhaps because there was not much chemistry with the producer, Christian De Walden, who had already produced other albums with performers such as Marta Sánchez. On September 28, 2005 she successfully premiered the musical Victor/Victoria at the Teatro Coliseum in Madrid. Her difficult Victoria Grant character was a big success, in which she played a man and a woman at the same time. Her cast partner was the great Paco Valladares. On November 1st, 2006, Paloma was awarded with a Latin Grammy Award in New York City: the 2006 Music Excellence Award. In 2006 she produced and recorded \\"Invierno Sur\\", an inward-looking album with smooth jazz and really exquisite compositions from several authors such as Armando Manzanero or Amaury Gutiérrez. The album featured a song based on a composition by Hans Zimmer, who transferred her the rights for \\"Nyah and Ethan\\", music that gave the name to the song as well as the album, \\"Invierno Sur\\". It additionally included a version of the song \\"Vives entre sombras\\" (\\"Livin' in the shadows\\") from the musical Victor/Victoria. The album was released in Spain on January 29, 2007 and is co-produced with RLM. It was again an innovative album due to its jazz grounds and the intimate character of many of its songs. In 2008 she did the \\"Encantados tour\\", accompanied by the maestro Luis Cobos, along with a symphony orchestra of more than 60 musicians. A DVD was released from this tour as well as a CD gathering the best moments and highlighting the \\"O Mio Babbino Caro\\", an opera song that Paloma performs easily. In Latin America the album was released without the DVD. She then toured the \\"PSB tour\\" (Piano, Sax and Bass). This tour included simultaneously several Spanish provinces and cities of Latin America, achieving a huge success both from the public and the critics. This tour began in early 2009 and ended up in 2010. It was a show where she reviewed her most successful songs along with international well- known songs, only followed by a piano, bass and saxophone. = Decade of the 2010 = At the beginning of 2010 she was invited to record the theme song of an Argentinian soap opera starring by the actress Soledad Silveyra (\\"Secretos de Amor\\", which was broadcast by the Argentinian TELEFE channel). The song is called \\"Amor sin edad\\" and was composed by Eduardo Frigerio. In March 2012 she published the album \\"Amolap\\" (Paloma written backwards), whose first released song not only amazed some but cause different opinions. This might be claimed to the tecno music sound and the lyrics in English which state: \\"Love makes my world go round\\". The first single from the album was \\"Yo quiero volar\\", a sophisticated pop sound comparable to an Anglo-Saxon pop ballad. In June 2012 she also premiered the musical My Fair Lady that toured in several Spanish cities; ending the tour in Valencia on November 4. On November 22 she announced on Twitter and Facebook her last year on tour. On January 6th, 2014, she gave a concert in the Teatro Real in Madrid, where great operas and classical music take place and where only a few singers have performed. She played songs from musicals such as Mary Poppins, Cats or Evita and ended with \\"Los Nardos\\" by las Leandras, which was a big success. On January 2, 2016, she premiered a concert along with Los Chicos del Coro de Saint Marc, called \\"Voces para el alma\\".  Farewell Tour 'Hasta Siempre' and new album with Los Chicos del Coro  Paloma San Basilio announced her withdrawal from the music scene after 40 years. For that reason, in 2013 she started a farewell tour and she chose Latin America as a starting point in order to show her gratitude for her artistic career. She participated in the Viña del Mar International Song Festival 2014 (Chile) where she won the Silver and the Gold Torch as well as the Silver and Gold Seagull awards. She is also working on an album in collaboration with Los Chicos Del Coro, which will include musical songs and versions of classics such as \\"I Say A Little Prayer\\" or \\"Amazing Grace\\", which were expected to be released in October 2015.

It was redesignated as Le Régiment de la Chaudière, CASF on 24 May 1940; and as the 1st Battalion, Le Régiment de la Chaudière, CASF on 7 November 1940. It embarked for Great Britain on 21 July 1941. On D-Day, 6 June 1944, it landed in Normandy, France as a part of the 8th Infantry Brigade, 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, and it continued to fight in North West Europe until the end of the war. The overseas battalion was disbanded on 15 January 1946. =War In Afghanistan= The regiment contributed an aggregate of more than 20% of its authorized strength to the various Task Forces which served in Afghanistan between 2002 and 2014. History Infantrymen of the Régiment de la Chaudière, who are wearing British winter camouflage clothing, on patrol, Berg en dal, Netherlands, January 24, 1945 The regiment mobilized a battalion for the Canadian Active Service Force in 1939. Initially organized as a machine gun battalion, the battalion was sent to England in August 1941. The unit was assigned to the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division as a standard rifle battalion and was designated as a reserve battalion during the D-Day landings in June 1944. Le Régiment de la Chaudière came ashore on the second wave at Bernières-sur-Mer after The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada, surprising the locals who hadn't expected to find francophone troops in the liberating forces. It was the only French-Canadian regiment to participate in Operation Overlord, and one of the few French-speaking units to come ashore that day alongside the bilingual The North Shore (New Brunswick) Regiment and the Free- French Commando Kieffer. The regiment participated in the Battle for Caen, suffering several casualties in the fight at Carpiquet airfield on 4 July 1944. Grave of Sgt Léo Major With the rest of the division, the regiment fought in the Battle of the Scheldt, notably in actions in the Breskens Pocket between 6 October and 3 November 1944. The unit wintered in the Nijmegen Salient and was again active in the Rhineland fighting in February 1945, and finished the war on German soil in May. A 2nd Battalion served in the Reserve Army. A 3rd Battalion was raised for the Canadian Army Occupation Force. =Name= Citizens in Normandy were surprised to find that soldiers of the Chaudière spoke a type of French very close to that spoken in Normandy, but were puzzled by the regiment's name. In French, chaudière is the word for a water heater or boiler. The regiment was named for the Chaudière River, itself named for the \\"boiling\\" of a waterfall on the river.Canada in the Second World War (Reader's Digest, 1958) Battle honours The regimental colour of Le Régiment de la Chaudière (prior to addition of 1812 and Afghanistan honours).

He is widely considered as the greatest and finest spanish-speaking songwriter. His songs usually treat about love, heartbreaks and society with a large usage of literary figures similarly to the baroque- literature style. He has released fourteen studio albums, two live albums, and three compilation albums. Some of his most known songs are \\"Calle Melancolía\\" (\\"Melancholia street\\"), \\"19 días y 500 noches\\" (\\"19 days and 500 nights\\"),\\"Quién me ha robado el mes de Abril\\" (\\"Who stole my April month\\"), \\"Pongamos que hablo de Madrid\\" (\\"Lets say I'm talking about Madrid\\"), \\"Y sin embargo\\" (\\"However\\"), \\"Contigo\\" (\\"With you\\") or \\"Peces de ciudad\\" (\\"City fish\\") He performed both solo and with a group for his live albums, performing with Javier Krahe and Alberto Pérez in La mandrágora, the group Viceversa in a 1986 concert, and with Joan Manuel Serrat in Dos pájaros de un tiro (Two birds with one stone). Sabina suffered a stroke in 2001 and although he physically recovered, he entered a deep depression which resulted in a four-year-long concert hiatus. He recovered and released his eighteenth album, Alivio de Luto, in November 2005 and in 2009 he released his album, Vinagre y rosas. In 2012 he released his latest album in collaboration with Joan Manuel Serrat: La Orquesta Del Titanic. On June 29th, 2020, Sabina married Jimena Coronado in a private ceremony in Madrid Biography and career =Early years= Joaquín Sabina was born in Úbeda, in the Province of Jaén. He is the second son of Adela Sabina del Campo and Jerónimo Martínez Gallego. His father was a policeman. He attended a Carmelite primary school and he started writing his first poems and composing music at the age of 14. He was part of a band called Merry Youngs which imitated singers such as Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry and Little Richard, as well as many others. He attended a high school run by the Salesians of Don Bosco and during this period he began reading works by Fray Luis de León, Jorge Manrique, José Hierro, Marcel Proust, James Joyce and Herbert Marcuse. After completing high school, his father wanted him to follow in his footsteps and become a police officer but he refused, saying that he preferred the guitar. In his song \\"La del pirata cojo\\" he says he fantasizes about living different lives, but he would not even joke about becoming a police officer. =Exile in London= He then enrolled in the University of Granada, reading philology in the faculty. There, he read the poetry of Pablo Neruda and César Vallejo. Sabina lived at first with a woman called Lesley and started to prepare his thesis. His revolutionary ideology led him to be related to the anti-fascist groups. In 1970, he began collaborating with the magazine Poesía 70, sharing pages with and Luis Eduardo Aute, he then left the university, going into exile in London using a fake passport under the name Mariano Zugasti, to avoid persecution from Francisco Franco's government after throwing a Molotov cocktail into a government building. That same year, his father received an order to arrest Sabina due to his anti-Franco ideals. In 1975, Sabina started writing songs and singing at local bars. In a local bar called \\"Mexicano-Taverna\\" Sabina performed in the presence of George Harrison, who was celebrating his birthday. The ex-Beatle then gave Sabina a five-pound note as tip, which Sabina still preserves to this day. When Franco's dictatorship ended in 1975, Sabina returned to Spain and joined the army but, feeling imprisoned, he married, to be able to sleep outside the barracks. =After the return= Sabina's first album, Inventario (Inventory) was released in 1978 by a small label Movieplay. He describes this album \\"as his own version of death metal\\", but the album largely went unnoticed. Afterwards, he moved to the powerful CBS (today Sony) and released Malas compañías (Bad Companies). This album gave Sabina his first number-one hit single \\"Pongamos que hablo de Madrid\\" (Let's say I'm talking about Madrid), and the artist attained wide recognition. He released a live album called La mandrágora (The Mandrake), sharing the spotlight with bandmates Javier Krahe and Alberto Pérez. The trio enjoyed great popularity due to their participation in a TV program. La Mandrágora was controversial due to the racy and political content of the lyrics. Sabina released his third album Ruleta Rusa (Russian Roulette) in 1984. In this album the singer evolved from the typical singer-songwriter style to Rock music with a harder sound and with presence of new instruments such as electric guitars. One of the most popular songs of this album was \\"Pisa el acelerador\\" (Step on the accelerator), which was the first maxi single of this album. = Success = In 1985 Sabina left CBS and released, this time under Ariola, Juez y Parte (Judge and Side) his fourth studio album in which he teamed up with the band Viceversa, which was led by Pancho Varona, who would turn into one of his closest friends and producer of many of Sabina's future albums. In this release, which shows a more modern production with the use of synthesisers and keyboards, it was included another popular song entitled \\"Princesa\\" (Princess), arguably the most popular one of this release. His political views led him to take part in the anti-NATO movement. He later released Joaquín Sabina y Viceversa en directo, his first live album, which turned definitely into his commercial breakthrough. This album which was recorded in the Salamanca theatre in Madrid, the singer collaborated with other singers such as Javier Krahe, Javier Gurruchaga, and Luis Eduardo Aute amongst others. In 1987 Sabina released his fifth studio album, Hotel, Dulce Hotel (Hotel, Sweet Hotel), which sold a large number of records in Spain (400.000 copies). One of the most popular songs of this record was the track \\"Así estoy yo sin ti\\" (That's how I am without you) for which was released a promotional video, the first one of his musical career. That success led to his next album El Hombre del Traje Gris (The Man in the Gray Suit), in which he would count with Antonio García de Diego, a new collaborator and also another of his fellow friends. After releasing this album, Sabina undertook a successful tour in Latin America. This record was followed by the release of Mentiras Piadosas (Pious Lies) in 1990. Two years later, in 1992, the performer reached a new sales record with the release of Física y Química (Physics and Chemistry), which sold more than one million copies mainly thanks to the smash hit \\"Y nos dieron las diez\\" (We went on till ten o'clock) a song with strong Mexican traditional flavour that tells the story of a summer affair. This song received such a warm welcome that has been covered by many Latin American singers. The unprecedented success led the singer to another successful tour to the Americas. His later albums Esta boca es mía (This Mouth is Mine), Yo, mi, me, contigo (I, my, me, with you) and 19 Días y 500 Noches (19 Days and 500 Nights), won him wider recognition and multiple platinum albums. After recovering from a stroke, he returned to the stage in 2002 with Dímelo en la Calle (Tell me on the Street or Dare to say that outside). He later released a double album called Diario de un peatón (A Pedestrian's Diary), which included both his previous album and 12 new songs, along with a book illustrated by him. In 2005 Sabina released a new record Alivio de luto (Relief from Mourning ). The album release was accompanied by a DVD that includes interviews, music videos, acoustic versions of the songs, and home- made recordings. In 2007, he went on tour with Spanish singer Joan Manuel Serrat, called Dos Pájaros de un Tiro (Two birds with one stone) and they recorded a CD of this tour, which includes the DVD of the concert and a documentary. In 2009, he received the prize of the city of Madrid from the mayor Alberto Ruiz Gallardón, who said that he was one of the most important people who had given a good image to the city. That year, he published his 15th studio album, Vinagre y Rosas (Vinegar and Roses), an album in which he collaborated with his producers Pancho Varona and Antonio García de Diego, and with the band Pereza. The first single from the album was the song \\"Tiramisu de limón\\" (\\"Lemon Tiramisu\\"), sung with Ruben and Leiva, the members of Pereza. For the promotional video, he collaborated with the actress and singer Mónica Molina. Finally the album was released on 14 December, entering directly at the top of the Spanish album chart.

The district owns and operates in three comprehensive high schools, three middle schools, and fourteen elementary schools. FPS also operates an alternative high school and a special needs pre-school. Total student enrollment in FPS is around 11,000. Governance and funding The Fargo Public Schools is governed by a nine-member Board of Education, whose members may serve an unlimited number of four-year terms. Board members oversee the district's annual operating budget, which is $134 million during the 2013-14 school year. Currently, the school district's operating levy is 139 mills. Sixty-nine percent of the district's general fund revenue comes from the state's foundation aid. The balance comes from property tax (30%), and the remaining 1% comprises federal funding, interest, and other sources. Of its expenses, 57% goes to Salaries. The remaining expenses include benefits (19%), fund transfers (6%), supplies (5%), purchased property services (5%), transportation and travel (4%), equipment (2%), contracted services (2%), and the remaining dues, fees, and registrations at less than 1%. Staff The school system employs more than 1,800 permanent employees. Included in that number are approximately 965 teachers, of which 59 percent hold a master's degree or higher. Specialists are placed in all district elementary buildings, to deliver instruction in visual arts, library/media services, music, and physical education. All of the district's teachers meet weekly in Professional Learning Communities, or PLCs, in order to improve teaching practices and student learning. Secondary teachers attend professional development days each semester that focus on improving the District's educational process. This is in addition to the weekly professional development sessions offered to individuals and small groups throughout the year. Also among its staff, through a partnership and cost-sharing agreement with the City of Fargo, are seven School Resource Officers], police officers who are placed in the district's middle and high schools. They are a part of the Cass-Clay Unified School Response Network, which originated in the Fargo Public Schools in the mid-2000s. Curriculum In 2011, the Fargo Public Schools was awarded a 5-year certification as an accredited school district by the North Central Association Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement. Its curriculum and education delivery is guided by a Strategic Plan developed in 2000, which focuses on seven goals: academic performance, the arts, character, citizenship, communication, life skills, and self-reliance. The district offers high school students 213 courses within 25 curriculum areas. Advanced Placement (AP) courses include biology, calculus, chemistry, computer science, economics, government, physics, psychology, and statistics in addition to language and the arts. Career & Technical Education curriculum in the Fargo Public Schools includes automotive, industrial, graphic arts, manufacturing, and information technologies. Through its special education department, the school district serves over 1,300 children with special needs, ages 3–21. Other academic and extracurricular programming offered by the district includes gifted services, summer school, remedial learning, arts education, and latch-key programs through the YMCA and Fargo-Moorhead Youth Commission. At the middle level, the district offers an Individualized Learning Center (ILC) program, where the student receives differentiated instruction (tailoring a pupil's teaching to his or her learning needs) in a small group setting for the purposes of tutoring or homework. Service learning (community volunteerism) is sometimes a part of the ILC experience, depending on location. Configuration The district educates its students through a citywide grade-level configuration of grade K-5 elementary schools, grade 6-8 middle schools, and grade 9-12 high schools. The district's elementary and middle school buildings constructed and/or remodeled after 1994 utilize the shared “pod” or “team center” concept, which assigns groups of students and teachers together for interconnected teaching and learning using common resources. Activities The district offers, on average, more than 50 extracurricular activities at each of the comprehensive high schools. This includes athletics, clubs, music, and the performing arts. Many directly relate to or include academic coursework. Honors Since 1999, the Fargo Public Schools has been named 13 times to the “100 Best Communities for Music Education,” a national survey by the NAMM Foundation which evaluates several criteria, including time reserved for music education, the budget, staff collaboration, professional development, how music standards are taught, equipment provided by the school district, and administrative support. In 2011, the district's School Resource Officer program was recognized as the Model Program of the Year by the National Association of School Resource Officers.

Biography From a very young age, Perales displayed an interest in music. At age 6, he learned to play the lute. At 16, Perales studied to be an electrical technician at the Universidad Laboral of Sevilla on a scholarship. During his time at university, he learned how to play the guitar and realized that music was going to form part of his life. After university, Perales moved to Madrid, where he completed his studies and continued his interest in music. His initial career as a musician was as a composer, because he did not like to sing and was unsure of the support of his girlfriend, Manuela. Encouraged by his mother, Mariana, Perales sang at some local festivals in his hometown. However, it was not until he met Rafael Trabucchelli (an influential Italian music producer in Spain at the time) in 1970 that his musical career took a dramatic turn. Trabucchelli discovered the young composer and talented, but reluctant, singer. Perales composed \\"Porque te vas\\" (Because you are leaving), which was performed by Jeanette and sold 4 million copies worldwide in 1976. After much encouragement from Trabucchelli and his supporters, Perales decided to give singing a try. His first record, \\"Celos de mi Guitarra\\" (Jealous of my Guitar) was a huge success in Spain and in Latin America. Although it was difficult for Perales to leave his job and devote himself to his new career, he was able to find a way to integrate his musical career into his life. He still lives in Castejón with his wife Manuela, son Pablo, and daughter Maria. Perales has recorded 27 albums with 50 million copies sold worldwide. His compositions have been recorded by singers such as Vikki Carr, Bertín Osborne, Raphael, Rocío Jurado, Jeanette, Miguel Bosé, Daniela Romo, Isabel Pantoja, Julio Iglesias, Paloma San Basilio, Mocedades, La Oreja de Van Gogh, Ricardo Montaner and Marc Anthony, among others. He has given concerts in Uruguay, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, United States, Brazil, Italy, France, and Portugal. Perales' most popular singles are \\"Quisiera Decir tu Nombre\\" (I Would Like to Say Your Name), \\"¿Y cómo es él?\\" (And What Is He Like?) and \\"¿Qué Pasará Mañana?\\" (What Will Happen Tomorrow?) On 18 February 2019 he received the Medalla de Oro al Mérito en las Bellas Artes.

This exposure would eventually lead to work in 1971, as a deejay on the Prince Jackie and El Paso sound systems,Larkin, Colin: \\"The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae\\", 1998, Virgin Books, initially influenced by Big Youth, U Roy, and Dennis Alcapone, and performing as \\"Dennis Alcapone Jr.\\".Thompson, Dave (2002) Reggae & Caribbean Music, Backbeat Books, , pp. 97–99 The first record producer he worked with was Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry, who decided that Bullock should change his name to Dillinger, after gangster John Dillinger.Barrow, Steve and Dalton, Peter:\\"Reggae: The Rough Guide\\", 1997, Rough Guides, Perry produced his first recording session, from which \\"Dub Organizer\\" was released as a single. Several other Perry-produced singles followed, but with limited success.

He tried to recapture the success of \\"Cocaine\\" in 1979 with the similarly-themed \\"Marijuana in My Brain\\". The single, and an album of the same name, were moderately successful, prompting A&M; Records to sign him.

Military strategies are methods of arranging and maneuvering large bodies of military forces during armed conflicts. Offensive strategies * Air supremacy – A degree of air superiority where a side holds complete control of air power over opposing forces. Control of the air is the aerial equivalent of Command of the sea. * Attrition warfare – A strategy of wearing down the enemy to the point of collapse through continuous loss of personnel and material. Used to defeat enemies with low resources and high morale. * Bait and bleed – To induce rival states to engage in a protracted war of attrition against each other \\"so that they bleed each other white\\", similar to the concept of Divide and conquer * Battle of annihilation – The goal of destroying the enemy military in a single planned pivotal battle * Bellum se ipsum alet – A strategy of feeding and supporting an army with the potentials of occupied territories * Blitzkrieg – A method of warfare where an attacking force, spearheaded by a dense concentration of armoured and motorised or mechanised infantry formations with close air support, breaks through the opponent's line of defence by short, fast, powerful attacks and then dislocates the defenders, using speed and surprise to encircle them with the help of air superiority. * Blockade / Siege / Investment – An attempt to cut off food, supplies, war material or communications from a particular area by force, usually taking place by sea * * Clear and hold – A counter- insurgency strategy in which military personnel clear an area of guerrillas or other insurgents, and then keep the area clear of insurgents while winning the support of the populace for the government and its policies. * Coercion – Compelling the enemy to involuntarily behave in a certain way by targeting the leadership, national communications, or political-economic centers * Command of the sea – A degree of naval superiority where a side holds complete control of naval power over opposing forces. Control of the sea is the naval equivalent of Air Supremacy * Counter-offensive – A strategic offensive taking place after the enemy's front line troops and reserves have been exhausted, and before the enemy has had the opportunity to assume new defensive positions. Tactic is usually implemented through surging at the enemy after their attack. * Counterforce – A strategy used in nuclear warfare of targeting military infrastructure (as opposed to civilian targets) * Countervalue – The opposite of counterforce; targeting of enemy cities and civilian populations. Used to distract the enemy. * Decapitation – Achieving strategic paralysis by targeting political leadership, command and control, strategic weapons, and critical economic nodes * Deception – A strategy that seeks to deceive, trick, or fool the enemy and create a false perception in a way that can be leveraged for a military advantage * Defeat in detail – Bringing a large portion of one's own force to bear on small enemy units in sequence, rather than engaging the bulk of the enemy force all at once. Similar to divide and conquer * Denial – A strategy that seeks to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war * Distraction – An attack by some of the force on one or two flanks, drawing up to a strong frontal attack by the rest of the force * Encirclement – Both a strategy and tactic designed to isolate and surround enemy forces * Ends, Ways, Means, Risk – Strategy is much like a three legged stool of ends, ways, means balanced on a plane of varying degree of risk * Enkulette – A strategy used often in the jungle that aims at attacking the enemy from behind. * Exhaustion – A strategy that seeks to erode the will or resources of a country * Feint – A maneuver designed to distract or mislead, done by giving the impression that a certain maneuver will take place, while in fact another, or even none, will. * Flanking maneuver – Involves attacking the opponent from the side, or rear * Guerrilla tactics – Involves ambushes on enemy troops. Usually used by insurgency. * Heavy force – A counterinsurgency strategy that seeks to destroy an insurgency with overwhelming force while it is still in a manageable state * Human wave attack – An unprotected frontal attack where the attacker tries to move as many combatants as possible into engaging close range combat with the defender * Incentive – A strategy that uses incentives to gain cooperation * Indirect approach – Dislocation is the aim of strategy. Direct attacks almost never work, one must first upset the enemy's equilibrium, fix weakness and attack strength, Eight rules of strategy: 1) adjust your ends to your means, 2) keep your object always in mind, 3) choose the line of the least expectation, 4) exploit the line of least resistance, 5) take the line of operations which offers the most alternatives, 6) ensure both plans and dispositions are flexible, 7) do not throw your weight into an opponent while he is on guard, 8) do not renew an attack along the same lines if an attack has failed * Interior lines – Placing one's forces in between the enemy forces and attacking each in turn in order to allow one's forces to have better communications and allows one to mass all of one's forces against a part of the enemies' * Limited war – A war in which the belligerents do not expend all of the resources at their disposal, whether human, industrial, agricultural, military, natural, technological, or otherwise in a specific conflict. * Motitus - A Motitus or Motti is a double envelopment manoeuvre, using the ability of light troops to travel over rough ground to encircle and defeat enemy troops with limited mobility. By cutting the enemy columns or units into smaller groups, a mobile force can restrict the mobility of a stronger enemy and defeat it in detail. The name comes from the Finnish word for a cubic meter of firewood, and the strategy was used extensively during the Winter War. * Penetration – A direct attack through enemy lines, then an attack on the rear once through * Periclean strategy – The two basic principles of the \\"Periclean Grand Strategy\\" were the rejection of appeasement (in accordance with which he urged the Athenians not to revoke the Megarian Decree) and the avoidance of overextension * Persisting strategy – A strategy that seeks to destroy the means by which the enemy sustains itself * Pincer ambush – A \\"U\\"-shaped attack with the sides concealed and the middle held back until the enemy advances, at which point the concealed sides ambush them * Pincer maneuver – Allowing the enemy to attack the center, sometimes in a charge, then attacking the flanks of the charge * Punishment – A strategy that seeks to push a society beyond its economic and physiological breaking point * Rapid Decisive Operations – Compelling the adversary to undertake certain actions or denying the adversary the ability to coerce or attack others. * Raiding – Attacking with the purpose of removing the enemy's supply or provisions * Refusing the flank – Holding back one side of the battle line to keep the enemy from engaging with that flank. The refused flank is held by smallest force necessary to hold out against the enemy's attack while concentrating the main battle force against the enemies' center or other flank * Separation of insurgents – A counterinsurgency strategy should first seek to separate the enemy from the population, then deny the enemy reentry, and finally execute long enough to deny the insurgent access * Shape, Clear, Hold, Build – The counterinsurgency theory that states the process of winning an insurgency is shape, clear, hold, build * Siege – Continuous attack by bombardment on a fortified position, usually by artillery, or surrounding and isolating it in at attempt to compel a surrender * Shock and awe – A military doctrine using overwhelming power to try and achieve rapid dominance over the enemy * Swarming – Military swarming involves the use of a decentralized force against an opponent, in a manner that emphasizes mobility, communication, unit autonomy and coordination/synchronization. * Theater strategy – Concepts and courses of action directed toward securing the objectives of national and multinational policies and strategies through the synchronized and integrated employment of military forces and other instruments of national power * Zerg - To overwhelm a base by sending all available units, in hopes to overwhelm their base. *Total war – Conflict in which belligerents engage with all available resources * Troop surge – deploying a large number of troops into theatre in order to overcome resistance * Turning movement – An attack that penetrates the enemy's flank, then curls into its rear to cut it off from home * Win without fighting – Sun Tzu argued that a brilliant general was one that could win without killing anybody * Crescent Strategy - Turkish commanders used this strategy. The soldiers act like a crescent and take the enemy in the middle of the crescent and surround it. Defensive strategies * Boxing maneuver – A strategy used to \\"box in\\" and force an attack on all sides at once * Choke point – A use of strategic geography, usually in a narrow area, intended to concentrate the enemy into a confined area where the defender can maximize his forces * Defence in depth – A strategy to delay rather than prevent the advance of the attackers by buying time and causing additional casualties by yielding space so that the momentum of the attack is lost and the attacking force can be attacked on its flanks *Elastic Defense - A strategy to flexibly absorb then repel the advance of attackers through carefully planned integrated fighting positions, perfected by the German Army in WWI * Fortification – A semi-permanent or permanent defensive structure that gives physical protection to a military unit * Fabian strategy – Wearing down the enemy by using attrition warfare and indirection, while avoiding pitched battles or frontal assaults. Named after Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus in his defense against Carthage. See Pyrrhic warfare * Military district – An area controlled by a military force, for administrative purposes rather than combat. Also known as Wehrkreis in German * Scorched earth – Destroying anything that might be of use to the enemy while retreating, or advancing * Turtling – Continuous reinforcement of the military front until it has reached its full strength, then an attack with the now-superior force * Withdrawal – A retreat of forces while maintaining contact with the enemy * High ground - An area of elevated terrain which can be useful in combat.

An entity (whether an individual or an organization) that can process this cycle quickly, observing and reacting to unfolding events more rapidly than an opponent, can thereby \\"get inside\\" the opponent's decision cycle and gain the advantage – Boyd * Paradoxical nature – The nature of strategy is a paradoxical and does not follow a linear pattern – Luttwak * Positive ends – The possibility of taking advantage of a new security environment to create conditions for long-term peace – Wass de Czege * Primary Trinity – (1) primordial violence, hatred, and enmity; (2) the play of chance and probability; and (3) war's element of subordination to rational policy – Clausewitz ** Secondary Trinity – People, Army, and Government – Clausewitz * Principles of war: ** Objective (Direct every military operation towards a clearly defined, decisive, and attainable objective) ** Offensive (Seize, retain, and exploit the initiative) ** Mass (Concentrate combat power at the decisive place and time) ** Economy of Force (Allocate minimum essential combat power to secondary efforts) ** Maneuver (place the enemy in a disadvantageous position through the flexible application of combat power) ** Unity of Command (For every Objective, ensure Unity of effort under one responsible commander) ** Security (Never permit the enemy to acquire an unexpected advantage) ** Surprise (Strike the enemy at a time, at a place, or in a manner for which he is unprepared) ** Simplicity (Prepare clear, uncomplicated plans and clear, concise orders to ensure thorough understanding) – US Army FM 3.0 * Systems approach – Nation-states operate like biological organisms composed of discrete systems.

Economic concepts * Salaries – Always pay your troops on time. * Asymmetric costs – ensure the cost of enemy losses (or objectives) is at least an order of magnitude higher than the costs of attacking. * Budget like a business – Ensure there is sufficient funds and revenue streams to finish the war. * Intentional insufficient Funding(Rcoined) - ensure you make the funds less than the return, if a cost of logistics costs X$ in delivering army collateral, and supplies. By only closing a canal or an route, using sea denial strategy then the price becomes (X$)*4= 4x$.

Thompson. The film stars Patty Dunning as Patty Myers, the main character and protagonist, along with Thom Rachford, Colleen Niday, and Mike Niday in supporting roles. It is the first installment in the Thief in the Night series about the Rapture, Tribulation, and Second Coming of Christ. The film is set during the near future, focusing on Patty, a young woman who was not raptured and who struggles to decide what to do in the face of the Tribulation.  Background  Russell Doughten and Donald W. Thompson, two Iowa-based filmmakers, formed Mark IV Pictures in 1972 to produce A Thief in the Night. Thompson had been working in radio. Doughten had worked with Good News Productions on The Blob in 1958, and had produced other films in Iowa through his production company Heartland Productions. The film was produced in 1972 for a budget of $68,000. It earned roughly $4.2 million during its first decade of release, the majority of which came from audience donations. It was \\"one of the first films to take on Fundamentalist apocalyptic narratives within a fictional motif.\\" Plot In medias res, Patty Meyers wakes up to a radio broadcast announcing the disappearance of millions around the world. The radio announcer suggests this may be the Rapture of the Church spoken of in the Bible. Patty finds that her husband has also disappeared. The United Nations sets up an emergency government system called the United Nations Imperium of Total Emergency (UNITE) and declares anyone who does not receive the Mark of the Beast identifying them with UNITE will be arrested. Several flashbacks occur to times in Patty's life before the rapture. The story begins with three friends who will have different destinies: Patty and her two friends who have different approaches to Christianity. One considers Jesus Christ her savior while the other, Diane, is earthly minded. Patty considers herself a Christian because she occasionally reads her Bible and goes to church regularly. However, her pastor is shown to be an unbeliever. She refuses to believe the warnings of her friends and family that she will go through the Great Tribulation if she does not put her faith in Christ. Meanwhile, her husband, who has been attending another church, has accepted Jesus. The next morning, Patty wakes to find that her husband and millions of others have suddenly disappeared. Patty is conflicted and refuses to trust Christ yet also refuses to take the mark. She desperately tries to avoid UNITE and the mark but is eventually captured. Patty escapes, but after a chase she is cornered by UNITE on a bridge and falls from the bridge to her death. Patty wakes up and realizes it has all been a dream. She is relieved, but her relief is short-lived when the radio announces that millions of people have in fact disappeared. Horrified, Patty frantically searches for her husband only to find he is missing too. Patty realizes that the Rapture has actually occurred and she has been left behind. Cast *Patty Dunning as Patty Myers *Mike Niday as Jim Wright *Colleen Niday as Jenny *Maryann Rachford as Diane Bradford *Thom Rachford as Jerry Bradford *Duane Coller as Duane *Russell Doughten as Rev. Matthew Turner *Clarence Balmer as Pastor Balmer *Gareld L Jackson as UNITE Leader *Herb Brown as UNITE Officer *Herb Brown, Jr as UNITE Officer *Betty D Jackson as Wedding Guest Biblical references The film's title is taken from 1 Thessalonians 5:2, in which Paul warns his readers that \\"the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.\\" The film presents a pre-tribulational dispensational Futurist interpretation of Christian Eschatology and the Rapture popular among U.S. Evangelicals, but is generally rejected by Roman Catholics, Orthodox Christians, Lutherans, and Reformed Christians. According to Dean Anderson of Christianity Today, \\"the film brings to life the dispensational view of Matthew 24:36-44,\\" representing one particular point of view. Other Dispensationalists reject finding the Rapture in Matthew 24, referencing instead 1 Thessalonians 4:17. (see also: Views of Eschatological Timing) In the film, everyone must receive the Mark of the Beast in order to buy or sell. The film's producers used three rows of a binary number six (\\"0110\\") written on their forehead or hand to represent the number 666 which is a common interpretation of Revelation 13:16-18. Music The film's title track I Wish We'd All Been Ready was composed by singer/musician Larry Norman. It was performed in the film by The Fishmarket Combo. The song also became the anthem of the Jesus movement. Legacy A Thief in the Night has been translated into three languages and subtitled in others. In 1989, Randall Balmer wrote that the film's producer, Russell Doughten estimated that 100 million people had seen the film. More recently, Dean Anderson writing for Christianity Today says it has been seen by an estimated 300 million. It was a pioneer in the genre of Christian film, bringing rock music and elements of horror film to a genre then-dominated by family-friendly evangelicalism. Randall Balmer has stated that, \\"It is only a slight exaggeration to say that A Thief in the Night affected the evangelical film industry the way that sound or color affected Hollywood.\\" MIT professor of film and media Heather Hendershot says, \\"Today, many teen evangelicals have not seen A Thief in the Night, but virtually every evangelical over thirty I've talked to is familiar with it, and most have seen it... I have found that A Thief in the Night is the only evangelical film that viewers cite directly and repeatedly as provoking a conversion experience.\\" A quarter century later, the authors of the Left Behind series of books and films have acknowledged their debt to Thief. Indeed, even the title Left Behind echoes the refrain of Norman's theme song for A Thief in the Night, \\"I Wish We'd All Been Ready,\\" in which he sings, \\"There's no time to change your mind, the Son has come and you've been left behind.\\" Sequels * A Distant Thunder (1978) * Image of the Beast (1981) * The Prodigal Planet (1983)  References  External links * A Thief in the Night at the Internet Movie Database * Film review by G.

It was redesignated as the 1st Battalion, The Algonquin Regiment, CASF on 7 November 1940. The battalion initially served in Canada in a home defence role as part of the 20th Infantry Brigade, 7th Canadian Division and in Newfoundland from 7 February 1942 to 6 February 1943. It embarked for Great Britain on 11 June 1943 and landed in France on 25 July 1944, as part of the 10th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Armoured Division, and continued to fight in North-West Europe until the end of the war.

History =The Great War= The 97th Regiment (Algonquin Rifles) recruited to its full active strength and supplied 12 officers and 251 other ranks to the 15th Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force. Captain E.F. Armstrong began recruiting in Nipissing and Sudbury in late 1915 resulting in the formation of the 159th (First Algonquins) Battalion. The battalion was mobilized on 5 July 1916, trained at Camp Borden in Angus, Ontario, during that summer and fall of 1916, and embarked for England on 1 November 1916, with a strength of 1,004 men. The battalion remained intact until 20 January 1917, when it was absorbed into the 8th Reserve Battalion and used to reinforce units already in France and Flanders. As a result of not having enough men at any particular battle, the unit received only the general \\"Great War 1916–1917\\" battle honour. Following the end of the war the 159th (First Algonquins), 228th (Northern Fusiliers) and 256th (Toronto) were perpetuated in the Algonquin Rifles. In 1929, the unit was renamed The Algonquin Regiment. The regiment decided to keep the bull moose symbol of the 97th Regiment (Algonquin Rifles) on a redesigned cap badge. In 1936, \\"A\\" Company in Sudbury was removed from the regiment and amalgamated with the Sault Ste. Marie Regiment to become the Sault Ste. Marie and Sudbury Regiment (MG), and the Northern Pioneers were amalgamated into The Algonquin Regiment. =Second World War= When war broke out the Algonquin Regiment was only 250 men strong. Recruitment and training soon became their primary concern. The regiment recruited from an area extending from Bracebridge and Parry Sound to the south and Timmins and Cochrane to the north. It was not until 22 July 1940, that the regiment went into active service. On 4 September 1940, the first battalion loaded up, the Algonquin Regiment (Active Force), and arrived at Camp Borden three days later. There was not enough space, however, for training exercises and they were moved to Current River Camp in Port Arthur, Ontario and again to Camp Shilo in Manitoba on 4 June 1941. The regiment was transferred to Niagara-on-the-Lake and assigned guard duty on the Niagara and Welland canals in November 1941, before finally being asked for their first draft for overseas enforcements on 14 January 1942. In February 1942, the regiment was transferred to Newfoundland and assigned protection duties at Torbay airport and Cape Spear. In January 1943, the regiment was chosen for operations overseas, was moved to Debert Camp in Nova Scotia and, for administration purposes, was assigned to the 20th Brigade of the Seventh Canadian Infantry Division. The regiment embarked on the RMS Empress of Scotland in Halifax on 10 June 1943, and sailed the following day for England with a complement of 4,500 troops. Upon arriving in Liverpool the regiment proceeded to Heathfield and was made part of the 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade of the Fourth Canadian (Armoured) Division. On 16 July 1944, an advance party left for Normandy, France, with the regiment as a whole arriving a couple of days later. The morning of July 25, 1944, all four companies of the Algonquin Regiment landed on Juno Beach where, in the following days, learnt of their ensuing mission to support the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division in closing the Falaise Gap. August 9, 1944, the regiment, supporting BCR (British Columbia Regiment), jointly forming 'Worthington Force' were tasked with taking Hill 195, taking an unfortunate wrong turn at 02:00 hours they ended up four miles east of Hill 195, closer to Hill 140, deep in German territory. The regiment suffered heavy losses with total casualties of 128 men and 47 tanks. The leader of the force, BCR commander Lt. Col Don Worthington, was killed and the Algonquins' commander, Lt. Col. Art Hay, was seriously wounded. R.S.M. A. J. Primeau was killed by the same mortar bomb that seriously wounded Hay . Leading up to August 31, 1944, the Algonquin Regiment, moving within the Fourth CAD, were tasked with filling the gap to the south at Hill 240, fighting alongside the Polish Armoured Division. The period from August 31 to September 8 was a period of rapid movement into Belgium, halted on the eighth at the Ghent - Brugge Canal. Fighting, all day and suffering multiple setbacks resulting in numerous casualties across all the regiments, ended September 10 with the Allies across the Ghent - Brugge Canal after holding back the German counterattacks. A few days later the attempt of the regiment to cross the Leopold Canal was successfully repelled at Moerkerke by the German 245 Infantry Division. The Canadians pulled back after a tremendous covering artillery barrage. The regiment continued with the Fourth Division north out of Belgium into the Netherlands in a progression of battles for the north shore of the Sheldt area eventually leading to the liberation of Welberg and Steenbergen. The operation to liberate Welberg was initiated on October 31, 1944, however with \\"D\\" Coy resting, all \\"A\\", \\"B\\" and \\"C\\" coys fell short of their objectives facing massive German counterattacks. Fighting continued on until November 1 when the regiment retreated back to a few km outside of Welberg. On November 2 they launched their second attack, this time along the right side of the town, fighting continued throughout the night. By the end of November 3 all four coys had reached their target objectives and succeeded in the liberation of Welberg. From November 5 to 8 the Algonquin Regiment rested in the Steenbergen area, the period proceeding became known as the \\"winter war\\" (November 1944-February 1945). Leading into Operation Blockbuster, this dislodgment of the German hinge in Hochwald on February 27, fighting to close the Hochwald gap began by midday of March 3, 1945, the allies had completed their objectives. Over the next couple of months, the Algonquin Regiment continued to fight, as they had been the entire war, under the Cnd Fourth Division crossing the Rhine with the last round-up (April 16-May 4) and cease-fire called just past Rastede Germany. As of January 1946, the Algonquin Regiment's final death toll was 65 officers and 1235 other soldiers. On 23 June 2016, the regiment's name was changed to The Algonquin Regiment (Northern Pioneers).Government of Canada News Release Battle honours The regimental colour of The Algonquin Regiment.

The King of Thailand upgraded the temple to the royal temple on May 31, 1978. The temple gains historical importance as the place where the Emerald Buddha was found. It is also one of the main centres of Buddhist education and the Sangha's administration in northern Thailand. Wat Phra Kaew is famous throughout Thailand as the original home of the translucent green Buddha which graces the Emerald Buddha Temple in Bangkok's Grand Palace. It was discovered in 1434 when a bolt of lightning hit an old Chedi. In the occasion of Princess Mother at her 90 years in 1990, Phra Yok Chiangrai, made of jade brought from Canada, a replica of that image was created to presides over at Hor Phra Yok, which was opened by Princess Kalayaniwattana on November 26, 1998. Wat Phra Kaew is also famous as the one of the royally endowed temple in this province. The abbot, Phra Dhammarachanuwat is the ecclesiastical head of all North Thailand. Like many temples throughout Thailand, Wat Phra Kaew is the beneficiary of many donations of important religious art works from members of its parish making merit. Arguably being the most important temple in the province, this Wat Phra Kaew has received more than its share over many centuries. Derivation of the name The path to the Haw Phra, under the Golden Bamboo, at Wat Phra Kaew, Chiang Rai Wat Phra Kaew is one of the oldest and most revered Buddhist temples in Chiang Rai. It is unclear when the temple was founded. The temple was originally called Wat Pa Yeah or Wat Pa Yah (, meaning the Temple in the Golden Bamboo Forest), as it was surrounded by a dense yellow bamboo grove locally known as Yeah or Yah. In 1434 the temple's octagonal Chedi (Pagoda) was struck by lightning and it fell apart to reveal a Buddha covered with stucco inside. The Buddha was then placed in the abbot's residence, who later noticed that stucco on the nose had flaked off, revealing a green figure inside. The abbot removed all the stucco and found a Buddha image made of a green semi-precious stone, which became known as Phra Kaew Morakot or the Emerald Buddha. \\"Emerald\\" here simply means \\"green coloured\\" in Thai. The temple has been thus called Wat Phra Kaew after this holy Buddha image ever since. Legend of the Emerald Buddha The legend of the Emerald Buddha is told in various sources, such as Jinakalamali, and Amarakatabuddharupanidana, in particular Ratanabimbavamsa (Chronicle of the Emerald Buddha) written in Pali by Brahmarājapañña in the 15th century. There are a number of variations in the story. The Emerald Buddha was said to have been sculpted by gods to present to Nagasena (~500 BE), who stayed in Asokaram of Pataliputra (now Kumhar in Patna, India). Subsequently, the image was moved from place to place before being housed in Bangkok. The chronology according to the legend is as follows: The Emerald Buddha now in Wat Phra Kaew in Bangkok 1\\\\. Sri Lanka 2\\\\. Cambodia 3\\\\. Angor Wat in Cambodia 4\\\\. Sri Ayudhaya, old capital of Thailand 5\\\\. Lawo or the present Lopburi province 6\\\\. Vajiraprakarn or the present Kampaeng Phet province 7\\\\. Chiang Rai for 45 years from 1391 to 1436 (the Emerald Buddha was discovered 1434, after which the chronology is more reliable history rather than legend) 8\\\\. Lampang for 32 years from 1436 to 1468 9\\\\. Chiang Mai for 85 years from 1468 to 1553 10\\\\. Luang Prabang and Viantiane of Lao for 225 years from 1553 to 1778 In 1778, during King Taksin of the Thonburi period, when King Rama I of Bangkok was still a general, he captured Vientiane and brought the Emerald Buddha back to Thailand. With the establishment of Bangkok as the capital, the Emerald Buddha became the palladium of Thailand and has been ever since. The image was moved from Thonburi to the Temple of the Emerald Buddha in Bangkok on 22 March 1784. The image has been regarded as the most sacred object in Thailand. Phra Jao Lan Thong image The Phra Jao Lan Thong image at Wat Phra Kaew, Chiang Rai One of the largest and most beautiful Buddha images in Thailand is housed in the ubosoth at Wat Phra Kaew, Phra Jao Lan Thong. The image is made of brass and copper and is believed to be 700 years old. The image was originally housed at Wat Phra Chao Lan Thong in Chiang Rai, then moved to Wat Ngam Muang, and then to Wat Phra Kaew in 1961 (B.E 2504). Thus it is now called Phra Jao Lan Thong. =Uposatha Hall= Phra Uposatha (the ubosoth, a consecrated chapel used for the Sangh's ceremonies) was originally a Vihara (assembly hall), built in 1890 in Chiang Saen style with 9.50 metres in width and 21.85 in length. It is a medium-sized, nicely carved wooden structure with unique carved doors. Its architectural style is known as “incubating hen”. Its renovation was done in 2001 with the approval of the Department of Fine Arts. The new Phra Kaew Marakot image The new Phra Kaew Marakot image, named Phra Yok Chiang Rai, at Wat Phra Kaew, Chiang Rai In 1990, a new Phra Kaew Marakot image was commissioned and carved in China out of Canadian jade in honor of Somdej Phra Srinagarindra, the Princess Mother's ninetieth birthday. The image is an intentionally close but not exact replica of the Phra Kaew Marakot in Bangkok; it is 48.3 cm wide across the lap and at 65.9 cm high, it is just 0.1 cm shorter than the original. The new image is called Phra Yok Chiang Rai (Chiang Rai Jade Buddha) and is housed in Haw Phra Yok. A dedication ceremony was held in Bangkok on 20 September 1991 (B.E. 2534) and the image was installed with a grand procession at Wat Phra Kaew, Chiang Rai on 19 October of the same year. Museum Since 2006 Acharn Supachai Sitilert, retired Deputy Director of the National Science Museum (in Bangkok) and Rebecca Weldon, a museologist formerly based at Rai Mae Fah Luang, have worked through the temple's vast storage of treasures to identify and research the holdings. Their initiative is now being supported by many monks based at the temple who are doing advanced studies in Lanna documentation, history and archaeology. Fortunately religious donations are usually very well documented (sometimes literally in stone), and the results of their efforts may be seen in a fine community museum inside the temple grounds. The small selection on display is beautifully arranged to illustrate many aspects of religious art in Lanna over hundreds of years. Each item is labeled in Thai, English and Lanna. The literate in both Thai and English can ask for brochures giving much greater detail. There are also some secular items on display including the official uniform of Jao Rachawong Buarakot, which was appointed from Bangkok (1890s). The museum is located on Trirat Road across from Overbrook Hospital. Entry is free of charge. It operates seven days a week from 9.00 to 17.00 o’clock.

Early life Jeppson was born in Logan, Utah, and studied physics at the University of Nevada, Reno. After enlisting in the United States Army Air Corps in 1942 at the age of 19 and basic training in Florida, he received electrical engineering training at Yale University, Harvard University and MIT. He then worked on bomb firing mechanisms with Los Alamos scientists at Wendover Air Force Base, Utah.http://www.hofferthistoryclass.com/Mr._Hofferts_Class_Website/Morris_Jeppson.html Mr Hofferts Class. Retrieved 28 June 2011 The Hiroshima mission Second Lieutenant Jeppson, along with then Captain William \\"Deak\\" Parsons of the U.S. Navy were responsible for arming the atomic bomb \\"Little Boy\\" on the Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber during the flight from Tinian to Japan. The bomb was protected from premature in-flight detonation by inserting three safety plugs into the electrical connection from its internal battery to the firing mechanism. This was designed to prevent a firing voltage from reaching the mechanism. Each plug was about the size and shape of a car cigarette lighter (approximately three inches in length), with a green cap for the safety plug and a red cap for the arming plug. Jeppson's role was to climb into the bomb bay and remove the three green safety plugs from the bomb and to replace them with the three red plugs just before the aircraft climbed to high altitude close the target area, a job that later caused controversy. Evidently, With the actions of switching these plugs—Jeppson became the last person to handle the “Little Boy” bomb. He clarified this in the BBC documentary called “Hiroshima”. Hiroshima: BBC History of World War II, BBC Television/Tokyo Broadcasting Inc/Discovery Channel 2005 Later life and career In September 1945, Jeppson was awarded the Silver Star in recognition of his service to his country. During the 1950s he worked as a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California developing hydrogen thermonuclear weapons. Later in his career, he helped develop several key technological breakthroughs including microwave technology as well as stabilizers used on helicopters. After retiring from his work as a physicist, Jeppson lived in Las Vegas with his second wife Mollie. Left to right: Morris Jeppson, Colonel Paul Tibbets, Theodore Van Kirk at the National Air and Space Museum's Steven F Udvar-Hazy Center on October 23, 2004 For many years, Jeppson refused to speak publicly about the Hiroshima mission for fear of reprisal against himself and his family. Starting in 1985, he became more willing to speak about it. On the 40th anniversary of the dropping of the bomb, Jeppson granted an interview and recounted his part in the mission. In June 2002, a controversy over the sale of a set of safety plugs Jeppson had kept since the mission occurred. After the mission Jeppson had kept one of each in his possession. The plugs were offered for sale in an auction, however the U.S. government tried to halt the sale, claiming they were classified secret material. U.S. District Court Judge Susan Illston rejected the claim by the government clearing the way for the sale. The plugs were eventually sold to retired physicist Clay Perkins for $167,000.Hiroshima bomb parts cleared for sale, June 15, 2002 A reunion for the 60th anniversary in 2005 which was supposed to take place on the island of Guam had been in the planning stages, but never materialized.

A rotating collar on the head of the screw has holes into which the handle, a metal bar, fits. When the handle is turned clockwise, the screw moves further out of the base, lifting the load resting on the load table. In order to support large load forces, the screw usually has either square threads or buttress threads. Advantages An advantage of jackscrews over some other types of jack is that they are self-locking, which means when the rotational force on the screw is removed, it will remain motionless where it was left and will not rotate backwards, regardless of how much load it is supporting. This makes them inherently safer than hydraulic jacks, for example, which will move backwards under load if the force on the hydraulic actuator is accidentally released. Mechanical advantage The ideal mechanical advantage of a screw jack, the ratio of the force the jack exerts on the load to the input force on the lever ignoring friction is :\\\\frac {F_\\\\text{load}}{F_\\\\text{in}} = \\\\frac {2 \\\\pi r}{l} \\\\, where :F_\\\\text{load} \\\\, is the force the jack exerts on the load :F_\\\\text{in} \\\\, is the rotational force exerted on the handle of the jack :r \\\\, is the length of the jack handle, from the screw axis to where the force is applied :l \\\\, is the lead of the screw. The screw jack consists of two simple machines in series; the long operating handle serves as a lever whose output force turns the screw. So the mechanical advantage is increased by a longer handle as well as a finer screw thread. However, most screw jacks have large amounts of friction which increase the input force necessary, so the actual mechanical advantage is often only 30% to 50% of this figure. = Limitations = Screw jacks are limited in their lifting capacity. Increasing load increases friction within the screw threads. A fine pitch thread, which would increase the advantage of the screw, also reduces the speed of which the jack can operate. Using a longer operating lever soon reaches the point where the lever will simply bend at its inner end. Screw jacks have now largely been replaced by hydraulic jacks. This was encouraged in 1858 when jacks by the Tangye company to Bramah's hydraulic press concept were applied to the successful launching of Brunel's , after two failed attempts by other means. The maximum mechanical advantage possible for a hydraulic jack is not limited by the limitations on screw jacks and can be far greater. After World War II, improvements to the grinding of hydraulic rams and the use of O ring seals reduced the price of low-cost hydraulic jacks and they became widespread for use with domestic cars. Screw jacks still remain for minimal cost applications, such as the little-used tyre-changing jacks supplied with cars. Applications The large area of sliding contact between the screw threads means jackscrews have high friction and low efficiency as power transmission linkages, around 30%–50%. So they are not often used for continuous transmission of high power, but more often in intermittent positioning applications. In heavy-duty applications, such as screw jacks, a square thread or buttress thread is used, because it has the lowest friction and wear. =Industrial and technical applications= In technical application such as actuators, an Acme thread is used, although it has higher friction, because it is easy to manufacture, wear can be compensated for, it is stronger than a comparably sized square thread and it makes for smoother engagement. The ball screw is a more advanced type of leadscrew that uses a recirculating-ball nut to minimize friction and prolong the life of the screw threads. The thread profile of such screws is approximately semicircular (commonly a \\"gothic arch\\" profile) to properly mate with the bearing balls. The disadvantage to this type of screw is that it is not self-locking. Ball screws are prevalent in powered leadscrew actuators. =Aviation= A Boeing 737 uses an adjustable stabilizer, moved by a jackscrew, to provide the required pitch trim forces. Generic stabilizer illustrated. Jackscrews are also used extensively in aviation to raise and lower horizontal stabilizers. The failure of a jackscrew on a Yakovlev Yak-42 airliner due to design flaws resulted in the crash of Aeroflot Flight 8641 in 1982. The failure of a jackscrew on a McDonnell Douglas MD-80, resulting from a lack of grease, brought down Alaska Airlines Flight 261 in 2000. The destruction of a jackscrew on a Boeing 747-400F, brought down National Airlines Flight 102 in 2013. This flight had just departed Bagram Airfield when a MRAP armoured vehicle broke loose and slid through the rear bulkhead, severing hydraulics lines and most importantly, destroying the jackscrew, rendering the aircraft uncontrollable. =In electronic connectors= The term jackscrew is also used for the captive screws that draw the two parts of D-subminiature electrical connectors together and hold them mated. When unscrewed, they allow the connector halves to be taken apart. These small jackscrews may have ordinary screw heads or extended heads (also making them thumbscrews) that allow the user's fingers to turn the jackscrew. Furthermore, the head sometimes has an internal female thread, with the male externally threaded screw shaft extending from that. The threaded-head type can be used to panel-mount one connector and provide a means to attach the mating connector to the first connector. =Trivia= The jackscrew figured prominently in the classic novel Robinson Crusoe. It was also featured in a recent History Channel program as the saving tool of the Pilgrims' voyage - the main crossbeam, a key structural component of their small ship, cracked during a severe storm. A farmer's jackscrew secured the damage until landfall.

They were often known as Knightsbridge Barracks and this name is still sometimes used informally. The barracks are from Buckingham Palace, enabling the officers and soldiers of the Household Cavalry to be available to respond speedily to any emergency at the Palace, practise drills at Horse Guards Parade beyond or conduct more ceremonial duties. History Knightsbridge Barracks in 1959 Semi-panorama north-east towards Hyde Park and the barracks Its first buildings were constructed for the Horse Guards in 1795, and a riding school and stables designed by Philip Hardwick were added in 1857. These were replaced with new ones designed by Thomas Henry Wyatt on which construction started in 1878 and was completed in May 1880. These were in turn demolished to make way for modernist buildings by Sir Basil Spence, and completed in 1970. It was built to accommodate 23 officers, 60 warrant officers and non-commissioned officers, 431 rank and file, and 273 horses. The most prominent feature is a 33-storey, residential tower, which is one of the two most prominent modern buildings as seen from Hyde Park along with the London Hilton on Park Lane. It was built by Sir Robert McAlpine between 1967 and 1970. The barracks are the base for the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, which is horsed and carries out mounted (and some dismounted) ceremonial duties on state and royal occasions in London. These duties include the provision of a Sovereign's Escort, most commonly seen at the present Queen's Birthday Parade (Trooping the Colour) in June each year. Other occasions include important ceremonies that take place during state visits by visiting heads of state, or whenever required by the British monarch. The regiment also mounts the Queen's Life Guard at Horse Guards, which consists of one squadron from each regiment. Reception The building has been described by the magazine, Country Life, as \\"dramatically modern and uncompromising\\", but many people have viewed it less favourably; it was voted number eight in a Country Life poll of Britain's \\"top ten eyesores\\". Lord St John of Fawsley remarked that \\"Basil Spence's barracks in Hyde Park ruined that park; in fact, he has the distinction of having ruined two parks, because of his Home Office building, which towers above St. James's Park\\". Critic A. A. Gill described the Barracks as the ugliest building in London, and said that Spence \\"managed to construct vertical bomb damage out of horizontal bomb damage.\\" Critics may not have considered the remit placed on the architect to provide quarters and mess facilities for over 500 soldiers, flats for 120 families and stabling for over 270 horses with the provision of an adequate parade ground so that an entire parade of mounted soldiers could practise together. 'I did not want this to be a mimsy-pimsy building', Spence is reported as saying. 'It is for soldiers. On horses. In armour'. He also felt that a tower would cut out less light to the park than a slab block, and would block fewer upper-storey views of the Royal Park from buildings to the south. In 2015 the C20 charity which campaigns for the preservation of architectural heritage applied to have the building listed. Their bid was endorsed by Historic England, but was rejected by Culture minister Tracey Crouch.

She was mentioned 10 times in the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty. It is known that King Jungjong was pleased with Jang-geum's medical knowledge and trusted her with taking care of the royal family. Henceforth, Jang-geum became the third highest-ranking officer in the Court, and was granted the use of Dae () (which means \\"great\\" in Korean) before her first name. Some sources attest to Jang-geum as a real person and it is still a topic of debate among scholars.

Wherein afterwards the physicians Park Se-geo and Hong Chim examined Jungjong's pulse and prescribed medications. Jang-geum was quoted: \\"His Majesty slept around midnight yesterday, and has also slept for a short time at dawn. He just passed his urine, but has been constipated for around 3 days.\\"Ibid. 105권 (volume 105), 1544년 음력 10월 25일 (10th lunar month 25th day) 3번째기사 (3rd entry) # 10 November 1544: Jungjong commented (in relation to some relatives sending their written regards for his well-being): \\"I'm still constipated.

At that time, there was no precedent of a Medical Lady treating a King, but the King trusted in Jang-geum's method of treating illness with food.

Floyd and Louis Steinberg. It is commonly used by image manipulation software, for example when an image is converted into GIF format that is restricted to a maximum of 256 colors. The algorithm achieves dithering using error diffusion, meaning it pushes (adds) the residual quantization error of a pixel onto its neighboring pixels, to be dealt with later. It spreads the debt out according to the distribution (shown as a map of the neighboring pixels): : \\\\begin{bmatrix} & & * & \\\\frac{\\\\displaystyle 7}{\\\\displaystyle 16} & \\\\ldots  \\\\ldots & \\\\frac{\\\\displaystyle 3}{\\\\displaystyle 16} & \\\\frac{\\\\displaystyle 5}{\\\\displaystyle 16} & \\\\frac{\\\\displaystyle 1}{\\\\displaystyle 16} & \\\\ldots  \\\\end{bmatrix} The pixel indicated with a star (*) indicates the pixel currently being scanned, and the blank pixels are the previously-scanned pixels. The algorithm scans the image from left to right, top to bottom, quantizing pixel values one by one. Each time the quantization error is transferred to the neighboring pixels, while not affecting the pixels that already have been quantized. Hence, if a number of pixels have been rounded downwards, it becomes more likely that the next pixel is rounded upwards, such that on average, the quantization error is close to zero. The diffusion coefficients have the property that if the original pixel values are exactly halfway in between the nearest available colors, the dithered result is a checkerboard pattern. For example, 50% grey data could be dithered as a black- and-white checkerboard pattern. For optimal dithering, the counting of quantization errors should be in sufficient accuracy to prevent rounding errors from affecting the result. In some implementations, the horizontal direction of scan alternates between lines; this is called \\"serpentine scanning\\" or boustrophedon transform dithering. In the following pseudocode we can see the algorithm described above. This works for any approximately linear encoding of pixel values, such as 8-bit integers, 16-bit integers or real numbers in the range [0,1]. for each y from top to bottom do for each x from left to right do oldpixel := pixel[x][y] newpixel := find_closest_palette_color(oldpixel) pixel[x][y] := newpixel quant_error := oldpixel - newpixel pixel[x + 1][y ] := pixel[x + 1][y ] + quant_error × 7 / 16 pixel[x - 1][y + 1] := pixel[x - 1][y + 1] + quant_error × 3 / 16 pixel[x ][y + 1] := pixel[x ][y + 1] + quant_error × 5 / 16 pixel[x + 1][y + 1] := pixel[x + 1][y + 1] + quant_error × 1 / 16 When converting 16 bit greyscale to 8 bit, \`find_closest_palette_color()\` may perform just a simple rounding, for example: find_closest_palette_color(oldpixel) = round(oldpixel / 256) The pseudocode can result in pixel values exceeding the valid values (such as greater than 1 in a [0,1] representation). Such values should ideally be clipped by the \`find_closest_palette_color()\` function, rather than clipping the intermediate values, since a subsequent error may bring the value back into range. However, if fixed-width integers are used, wrapping of intermediate values would cause inversion of black and white, and so should be avoided.

In the game, a live-action protagonist Drew Blanc, played and voiced by Christopher Lloyd, is transported into the cartoon world he created while suffering from a creative block. Blanc is accompanied by his animated sidekick Flux Wildly, voiced by Dan Castellanata. Conceived in 1993 as a game geared towards children, Toonstruck was later re-written to be more adult-oriented. Virgin Interactive invested huge amounts of money into the game, which ended up costing in excess of US$8 million. In addition to Lloyd and Castellanata, the cast includes several well-known actors and voice actors such as Tim Curry, David Ogden Stiers and Jim Cummings. Toonstruck features scan-line compressed FMV that is composited with hand-drawn animated sequences produced by Burst, Nelvana and Rainbow Animation. Toonstruck was well received by gaming critics, who mostly praised the quality of the animation, puzzles and performances by Lloyd and Castellanata, although it was a financial disappointment for Virgin. It has since been recognized as one of the best adventure games of all time, and has recently been re-released for modern computers by GOG.com and Steam. Gameplay The barn before it is struck by the Malevolator's beam. Drew can be seen talking to the Carecrow as Flux is walking away. The \\"bottomless bag\\" appears on the bottom left corner Toonstruck is a point-and-click adventure game where the player controls Christopher Lloyd's digitized likeness, accompanied by his cartoon sidekick Flux. The game uses a \\"Bottomless Bag\\" as an inventory icon, and the mouse pointer, represented by an animated white- gloved hand, is context-sensitive, changing its icon depending on what it is rolled over. Dialogue options with characters throughout the game are displayed as graphical icons that represent the topic of conversation. One of the standard icons is a cube of ice (for \\"breaking the ice\\" with a character); as dialogue options are exhausted, the cube melts into a puddle of water. According to Joystick, there are 52 original characters in the game to interact with, as well as 80 puzzles to solve and 120 objects to retrieve throughout the course of the game. The main objective of the game is to locate and collect several items to build a machine that has an opposite effect to that of the main antagonist, Count Nefarious. These components are spread throughout the three kingdoms of Cutopia, Zanydu and Malevoland. Many of the puzzles in the game are based on object manipulation, although there are also some logic and arcade-style puzzles. For certain parts of the game, the player must use the abilities of Flux as a cartoon character to advance in the game. This is done in-game by selecting Flux and using him much like an item. Toonstruck presents a non-linear structure. Puzzles often require using objects from one location in the others; therefore, players must travel back- and-forth through the three lands throughout the first part of the game. The second part of Toonstruck sees Drew being imprisoned in Count Nefarious's castle; this section of the game takes place entirely within the castle, and unlikely the first, Flux is not present. Similarly to the LucasArts adventure games, it is not possible to die in the game, and there are no dead-ends that require the player to start over or load an earlier save file. Plot Animator Drew Blanc (Christopher Lloyd) is the original creator of the Fluffy Fluffy Bun Bun Show, which has been a ten-year success for his company. In reality, the many cute talking rabbits that star in the show sicken him. His self-revered creation Flux Wildly, a wise-talking small purple character, has been denied the chance of starring in his own show. Drew's boss Sam Schmaltz (Ben Stein) sets him the task of designing more bunnies to co-star in the show by the next morning. However, the depressed animator soon nods off, suffering from acute artist's block. He wakes in the night to inexplicably find his television switched on, announcing the Fluffy Fluffy Bun Bun Show. Suddenly, Drew is mysteriously drawn into the TV screen and transported to a cartoon world populated by his own creations, among many other cartoon characters. He soon befriends Flux Wildly (Dan Castellaneta) and discovers that this fictional paradise is being ravaged by a ruthless new character named Count Nefarious (Tim Curry) with a weapon of evil called the Malevolator, a flying saucer which mutates the idyllic landscape and its inhabitants into dark and twisted counterparts. Upon meeting with King Hugh (David Ogden Stiers), the king of Cutopia, Drew is given the task of hunting down and stopping Nefarious, thereby restoring peace and harmony to the land, in return for safe passage back to three-dimensional reality. Drew and Flux then go on a scavenger hunt through the lands of Cutopia, Zanydu and Malevoland to collect the parts needed to complete the Cutifier, a counter-weapon to Nefarious's Malevolator. After Nefarious's feline assistant Ms. Fortune (Tress MacNeille) informs him that Drew (referred to as an \\"alien\\") is working against him, the villain sends his henchmen after Drew and Flux, who find several ways to hide from the clumsy stooges. As Drew and Flux carry on with their quest, Nefarious continues his attacks on Cutopia, destroying Fluffy Fluffy Bun Bun's meadow; turning the kingdom's Carecrow, a friendly mannequin, into a creepy scarecrow; and turning Polly and Marge, a sheep and a cow who produce butter in a barn, into a dominatrix and a submissive in bondage. After collecting all the parts and inserting it in the Cutifier, Drew and Flux revert the damage caused by Nefarious. After reuniting with King Hugh, Drew considers his mission finished and asks the king to be sent back to the real world. However, Hugh tells Drew that the deal was not only to save Cutopia, but to cutify Zanydu and Malevoland as well. Hugh soon reveals himself to actually be Fluffy Fluffy Bun Bun in disguise, with a plan to rule over all kingdoms and become a god. Before Drew and Flux can escape, Fluffly strikes Flux with the Cutifier, turning him into her minion, and commands him to execute her evil plan. Although Drew flees, he ends up captured and taken to Count Nefarious. Ms. Fortune hypnotizes Drew and he reveals the location of Flux and the Cutifier. Nefarious then goes after Flux, while Drew is imprisoned in Nefarious's castle. Drew manages to set himself free and navigates through the castle to find the Malevolator and a gadget that can warp him to reality. As soon as he hops in the Malevolator, Nefarious appears on the saucer's screen attempting to bargain with Drew and convince him to drop his plans and in return get sent home. Drew refuses, and uses the Malevolator to destroy Fluffly, Nefarious and the Cutifier. In the process Flux is transformed back and gives Drew a transdimensional communicator so they can keep in touch. Drew activates the warp gadget and returns to the real world, thinking his adventure was just a dream. In the morning, he pitches to Sam a new series called The Flux & Fluffy Show, only for it to get shot down. As Drew resigns himself to his soulless job, Flux calls him through the communicator to warn that Fluffly and Nefarious are still alive, and Drew happily teleports away. Development Toonstruck was published by Virgin Interactive Entertainment and developed by Virgin's internal development studio Burst, based in Irvine, California and headlined by Chris Yates, a veteran of Westwood Studios, and Neil Young, who worked at Probe. After David Perry and his associates left Virgin in 1993, the company struggled with internal development and hired Yates and Young to lead this division. In an interview by Edge, Yates stated that all senior producers at Burst had between \\"eight and ten years of experience\\", and that the studio was focused on having quality tools and technology to develop products with high production values. Development of the game began in October 1993, and finished in November 1996. Virgin Interactive invested much money in the project, and aimed at impressing audiences with high production values. \\"So much of the game was handled like a full-scale movie production\\", said artist John Pimpiano, who was originally tasked with doing background art for the game, but became involved with other realms of production such as character development, storyboarding, color styling and marketing promos, among others. The studio was inspired to take CD-ROM technology \\"even further\\" after the success of Virgin's The 7th Guest, and to make the game \\"as cinematic as possible\\". Overall, 230 people worked in the game. In 1994 Burst switched its early engine to that of The Legend of Kyrandia: Malcolm's Revenge, offered to them by Westwood. Since the programmers had to re-code much of the game, only about 5% of the original source code remained in the final game. By the end of development, Toonstruck had a high budget of over $8 million ($13 million in 2020 figures). According to Next Generation, Virgin Interactive always acknowledged that Toonstruck would be expensive. A Virgin Interactive insider suggested that the animation was of an unnecessarily high level of sophistication, exceeding the quality \\"of even Disney animated movies\\". Furthermore, the development team spent 18 months debugging the code written for the Kyrandia engine, further delaying the release and adding to the already high production budget. =Writing= Toonstruck was originally conceived as \\"an interactive Who Framed Roger Rabbit but in reverse,\\" since a live-action character enters a fully-animated cartoon world. Executive producer David Bishop conceptualized the game as a children's game \\"where a villain was draining the colour out of the world, turning it black and white\\". According to lead designer Richard Hare, Bishop's original concept was titled Trouble in Toonland and had as its protagonist a young boy named Daniel. However, once Bishop's concept was passed on to co-writer and designer Jennifer McWilliams, it went through several revisions to make it more adult- oriented, with comic violence and touches of parody and cynicism. According to Le Monde, Richard Hare wanted all players to be shocked at some point with the game's sense of humor. The final screenplay was credited to McWilliams, Richard Hare and Mark Drop. McWilliams wrote the second part of the game to be more psychological, with Drew facing his fears, living out his fantasies and eventually restoring his creativity. The character of Flux Wildly was created after that of Drew Blanc, as a companion and \\"fun-loving\\" sidekick, because he gave a window \\"into the 'real' Drew\\". To McWilliams, Flux was also \\"a great addition\\" for the puzzles and humor. Developers aimed at creating a world that felt as though it was \\"living\\" and that evolved as the story events progressed. To accomplish that in writing, the NPC dialogue was programmed to change as critical events happened in the game so that characters commented on these events instead of just repeating dialogue from earlier. With the delays to the game's production and the release date getting closer, Virgin executives decided to split the game's content in two and expected to have the unreleased half be included in a potential sequel. Due to Virgin's decision to divide the game in two, the writers had to come up with an ending that properly concluded the game \\"halfway through, with a cliffhanger that would, ideally, introduce part two.\\" Since the entire story arc was carefully though- out, McWilliams felt Virgin's decision \\"definitely disrupted that\\", but nonetheless believed the studio did well under the circumstances. In the later half of the story that was cut from the final game, Drew and Flux took a train ride to an island in the sky, where Drew faced off his fears in a carnival setting; scenes included a Wild West shootout, an encounter with Drew's idol Vincent Van Gogh and a visit to a mad dentist. =Design and animation= Creative influences for Toonstruck's characters, locations and animations were the classic cartoons of Warner Bros., Tex Avery, Hanna-Barbera and Walt Disney Studios. Elements of the game were also inspired by British humor and the \\"lampooning\\" of American pop culture. Canadian animation studio Nelvana signed a deal with Virgin Interactive to produce animation for Toonstruck through Nelvana's commercials production arm Bear Spots Inc. It was Nelvana's first contract with Virgin. There were also animation cels and characters that were developed and keyframed by Burst and finished by Rainbow Animation, in the Philippines. Burst's animators did much of their work traditionally, sketching characters and their movements on paper and then animating these frames. The company used computer technology from Silicon Graphics, as well as software such as Deluxe Paint and Autodesk Animator, which were used for coloring and finishing of the animated sequences. Over 11.000 animations were made by Burst during development. The full-motion footage of the game's live-action actors was shot in Burst's own motion capture studio, with hundreds of hours of performance against a green screen. An eight-camera Digital Betacam set-up was used in order to allow Lloyd's character to be \\"perfectly scaleable\\" when viewed from every possible angle. In order to make post-production more efficient and easier, Burst first filmed empty scenes and then introduced the actor. A program by Silicon Graphics was used to calculate the difference in lighting and color between the two types of footage, thereby speeding up the process of color correction. The footage was then composited and edited together with the animation by Burst's in-house animators. Richard Hare served as director of the live-action production. According to voice actor Dom DeLuise, the makeup and costume design for Lloyd was purposely done in a way that footage of his could be easily manipulated for the game; for instance, Lloyd's jacket costume had no buttons and his hair was combed right in the middle so that his likeness could be flipped right or left without being noticeable to players. McWilliams noted the team designed many ideas they felt were funny and interesting, without focusing on what was achievable within the budget and schedule. For the most part, the company gave the team creative freedom, but intervened when more content was made than could be included in one game and decided to cut half the material from the final game. This forced Burst to rework the game under this restriction. =Casting and sound= According to Jennifer McWilliams, most of the writing for the game was completed before the actors were cast, but the character ultimately voiced by Tim Curry was written with him in mind. Burst had initially cast a different actor to voice Flux Wildly, but replaced him with Dan Castellanata, known for voicing Homer Simpson, after the studio decided the first choice would not be a good fit. Christopher Lloyd, then-known for his roles in the Back to the Future series and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, was cast in the live-action role of cartoonist Drew Blanc. Ben Stein played the role of Blanc's boss Sam Schmaltz, also live-action. Curry voiced the antagonist Count Nefarious. David Ogden Stiers, known for his work in M*A*S*H and Beauty and the Beast, voiced King Hugh, the king of Cutopia. All Dogs go to Heaven voice actor Dom DeLuise voiced Fingers, the octopus who is a cashier at the arcade. Additional vocal performances were given by Jeff Bennett, Corey Burton, Jim Cummings, Tress MacNeille, Rob Paulsen, April Winchell and Frank Welker. Keith Arem was Toonstruck's voice director, animation music and sound designer. While Arem composed original music for the game, he also included a mix of public domain classical music, such as Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy by Tchaikovsky, and production music supplied by APM, such as \\"Happy Go Lively\\" by Laurie Johnson. Sound effects from classic cartoons were also included in the sound design for Toonstruck. Release Toonstruck was originally planned to launch Q4 1995, but was pushed to a 1996 release date in October 1995. By December 1995 the title was expected to launch Q1 1996, but was postponed again to the fall season. Toonstruck was showcased at the 1996 edition of E3. After several delays and months after being previewed at E3, the game was released in the U.S. on October 30, launching for an initial price of $59.95. It was released in Europe and other territories in November 1996. In December 1996 Virgin Interactive teamed up with Happy Puppy to launch the official website for Toonstruck, with email communication between Virgin and consumers and the ability to enter a contest to win CD-ROMs and merchandise. The postponement of Toonstruck from late 1995 to October 1996 contributed to Virgin Interactive's reported loss of $14.3 million in the U.S. in 1995. Despite being well- received upon release, Toonstruck underperformed in sales and was a commercial failure; this was partly attributed to a fading interest in point-and-click adventure games among consumers. VP of marketing for Virgin Simon Jeffery admitted that the company \\"would have liked to have seen higher sales for Toonstruck\\", which by December 1996 had sold over 150,000 units worldwide. Executive producer Bishop lamented the lack of an effective marketing campaign for the game, and also criticized the packaging it came on. \\"As soon as you have the word 'cartoon' associated with a game, it aims at a young audience. But this was a game for adults with a lot of adult content,\\" Bishop stated. In an interview in March 2003, Hare echoed Bishop's sentiments on the packaging design and marketing as factors in the game's demise. Destructoid also mentioned the marketing, as well as Virgin's decision to cut the game in half, as reasons for why the game was a financial disappointment.The Games That Time Forgot: Toonstruck destructoid.com Virgin Interactive CEO Martin Alper said he expected Toonstruck \\"to do better\\", and in response to the company's poor performance in the 1996 holiday season, began a plan in 1997 to cancel \\"weaker\\" projects, cut down on development budgets and make products that appeal to international markets, citing stronger sales from Europe than the U.S. Nearly twenty years after being first published, Toonstruck was re- released for modern Windows systems by GOG.com on February 10, 2015, and by Steam on November 15, 2016. Both versions run on the ScummVM emulator. It has also been released by GOG.com for OSX and Linux. Reception Toonstruck received mostly positive reviews. Brett Atwood of Billboard wrote that despite the game being \\"far from unique,\\" it is \\"filled with plenty of challenging puzzles and cool cartoons\\". Entertainment Weekly's Gary Eng Walk rated the game an A-, praising the level of difficulty and puzzles while noting that the controls \\"are sometimes clunky\\". Computer and Video Games gave Toonstruck a 4 out of 5, calling it \\"the best point-and-click adventure for a long time\\". In its review, CVG compared the game favorably to LucasArts adventures games such as Day of the Tentacle and Monkey Island, and praised the \\"professional\\" cutscenes, controls and difficulty curve. Petra Schlunk of Computer Gaming World gave the game a 5 out of 5, praising the story, characters, voice work and puzzles. The Irish Times Garrett Rowe called Toonstruck a \\"superb example of how to put together games of this nature\\", rating its graphics 90%, its sound 84% and the gameplay 93%. Ron Dulin of GameSpot said Toonstruck was \\"overly-hyped for both its technical prowess and ingenious premise. ... the animation, while admirable, isn't mind-blowing, and the story is mildly amusing at best. But what's great about Toonstruck is that neither of these drawbacks matters in the slightest; the designers have made a great game by creating an experience that is entertaining and challenging but doesn't become too frustrating or too easy.\\" He elaborated that the game is consistently clear about what the player needs to do, and the puzzles deal solely with how to go about doing it. Major Mike of GamePro found the dialogue tedious and unfunny, but praised every other aspect of the game, particularly the puzzle interface, whimsical music, and integration of live action video with fluid cartoon animation. He summarized, \\"although it lags at times, it contains an excellent blend of puzzle-solving and cartoon animation.\\" Edge described Toonstruck as \\"the closest any post-Monkey Island effort, with the possible exception of Broken Sword, has come to getting the ingredients right,\\" and gave the game an 8 out of 10. The magazine praised the game's puzzles and highlighted the non-linear aspect of the game. The review did criticize the integration of digitized live-action footage with the animated scenes, and stated the humor was excessively over-the-top at parts of the game. Aaron Ramshaw of Adventure Gamers wrote that Toonstruck \\"remains one of the best adventures ever made\\" twenty-two years after it first came out. Ramshaw described the characters as \\"superbly crafted and portrayed\\" and Lloyd's comic timing as \\"particularly praiseworthy\\". Ramshaw also praised the quality of the animated cinematics, the non-linear puzzle design and musical score. Adventure Classic Gaming's Cyrus Zatrimailov gave the game a 4 out of 5 score; he praised the graphics but had mixed thoughts on the puzzles, believing some of them to be \\"totally absurd\\" and \\"plain weird\\". Some reviews were less positive. Next Generation focused on the script, and assessed that \\"the dialog, slapstick humor, and relentless 'comedy' situations are tired and mostly ripped off from past and present cartoon creations. You've seen most of these jokes before, and done better 40 years ago.\\" Dave Nuttycombe of The Washington Post praised Lloyd's performance, but wrote that after it \\"wears off, you're left with conventional art and a public-domain soundtrack\\", and described the game as \\"tedious\\". Hardcore Gaming 101 writer Kurt Kalata gave a mixed review of the game, with praise towards the \\"varied yet unique\\" art style, the audio and voice acting. However, Kalata criticized the writing as not \\"terribly good\\" and the dialogue as \\"rarely any funny\\", and wrote the game feels incomplete. The Electric Playground rated the game a 5.5/10 and described the hype associated with it as \\"unwarranted\\". The review also criticized the originality of the story and characters, as well as the puzzles, but praised the use of Flux in the game as a \\"neat aspect\\". =Recognition= Toonstruck was named the 37th best computer game ever by PC Gamer UK in 1997. The game was a finalist for Computer Gaming Worlds 1996 \\"Adventure Game of the Year\\" award, which ultimately went to The Pandora Directive, and was a runner-up for Best Adventure Game of 1996 by GameSpot, losing to The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery. In 2011, Adventure Gamers named Toonstruck the 93rd-best adventure game ever released, commending the writing and the story as \\"genuinely funny\\". PC Gamer included the game in its 2017 list of the best adventure games. TechRadar's Jordan Oloman included the game in his list of the 7 best adventure games on PC, singling out the \\"stellar\\" cast, puzzles and characters for praise. Cancelled sequel One of the scenes from the unreleased sequel After the game's financial failure, Virgin cancelled plans to make a sequel to Toonstruck, which would have used content cut from the first installment. Audio director for the game Keith Arem, who obtained the animation rights to Toonstruck, has expressed interest in re-releasing the game as a remastered version, which would include the second half of the game. However, after stating he would need \\"tremendous\\" fan support to justify a Toonstruck re-release, a petition calling for the sequel was created in 2010 by fans.Toonstruck 2 petition group on FacebookToonstruck 2 petition Twitter account A Facebook group and a Twitter account were also launched to support the endeavor; the Facebook group currently has over 2.000 members. In February 2014 Arem posted on Facebook stating that he would need to raise \\"significant capital and fan interest\\" to attract investors and bring the re-release project to life. According to posts from Arem in 2016, there are still unresolved copyright issues preventing him from going forward with the project, but wrote that his team has been \\"working to consolidate\\" and negotiate rights. Prior to Arem's interest in reviving Toonstruck 2, an Internet forum of dedicated fans of the game had previously attempted to piece together the unreleased content into a playable fan-made game. The increased interest in a Toonstruck 2 has also led to the creation of a creepypasta story centered around the unreleased sequel. See also *Hollywood Monsters *Leisure Suit Larry: Love for Sail!

In 1947, Middelkamp became world champion. In 1936, he was the first Dutch cyclist ever to win a stage in the Tour de France. Biography Middelkamp was born as the second son in a family of nine children. At an early age, he wanted to be a footballer, but he soon realised that there was much more money to be earned in cycling, as football was not yet a professional sport in the Netherlands. Middelkamp was the first Dutchman to win a stage in the Tour de France. When he came to the Tour, he had never even seen mountains, coming from the very flat parts of the Netherlands. However, in his first Tour, on July 14, 1936, he won the difficult mountain stage from Aix-les-Bains to Grenoble, which went over the Col du Galibier. That year, he finished 23rd overall. In 1937 he had to quit the Tour because of a fall, in which he broke a finger. In 1938 he won the seventh stage (Bayonne-Pau). In that tour, he won 8,000 francs, much less than he could have earned in races in Flanders, and so he decided not to participate in any later Tours. As Middelkamp famously said, \\"I cannot live on fame and honour\\".Haan, Rob de. Liever poen dan roem, 16 June 2010, nu.nl During the Second World War, Middelkamp earned money by smuggling, but he was caught and spent several months in prison. After the war, he went back to full-time cycling. In 1947, Middelkamp became the first Dutch world champion on the road, in Reims, after having been close to that title in the previous year. Middelkamp ended his career in 1951, when he bought a pub in Kieldrecht. For a long time, he would not talk to journalists about his cycling years, until he spoke about his famous 1936 stage win in a television program in 2003. Middelkamp died in 2005.

Hunting supplemented farming, and the tribe hunted rabbits, quail and deer, especially in the summer. The tribe fished for suckers, minnows, and pupfish, as well as brine shrimp. Caterpillar larvae was eaten after being baked and dried. Wild foods were gathered, such as acorns, cattails, and berries. Popular traditional games include shinny, the four- stick game, hoop and pole, dice games, and handgame, the last of which is still very popular today. History In the early 19th century, European- Americans, such as trappers and gold prospectors encountered the Owens Valley Paiute. US military surveyors explored the region in the mid-19th century, planning to establish a reservation for the local Indians. Non-Indians settled in the valley in 1861. Increasing numbers of European-Americans fought with the local tribe for water and farmlands. A military outpost, Camp Independence was built in 1862, and the non-Indians fought with the tribes, destroyed their crops, and were able to seize the best lands. In the early 19th century, the Paiutes numbered 7,500, with about 1,500 to 2,000 Owens Valley Paiutes. In the 1990s an estimated 2,500 Owens Valley Paiutes lived on reservations. Meanwhile, the Timbisha (Panamint or Death Valley Shoshone) Native Americans relocated from ancestral homelands to be with the Owens Valley Northern Paiute. A reservation was not established until 1912. In order to provide water needs for the growing City of Los Angeles, water was diverted from the Owens River into the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913. The Owens River Valley cultures and environments changed substantially. From the 1910s to 1930s the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power purchased much of the valley for water rights and control, effectively destroying the local economy. In the 1940s the US federal government developed the Indian lands with housing and water systems. Big Pine Reservation The Big Pine Reservation was established in 1912 and is large, located along US 395 in the high desert town of Big Pine, California. Much of the area houses were built by the Indian Housing Authority. There is a school, with classes from kindergarten to 12th grade adjacent to the reservation. A 1,500-volume public library is located within the school. Tribal members raise horses on the reservation lands.Biggs, Bonnie. Big Pine Reservation.

Penetration is a strategic military maneuver much like the pincer movement with a few differences. The penetration attack goes straight through the enemy's lines and, once through, each flank turns and attacks the opponent's rear, similar to the blitzkrieg strategy. A penetration is a form of maneuver in which an attacking force seeks to rupture enemy defenses on a narrow front to disrupt the defensive system. A commander employs a penetration when there is no assailable flank, enemy defenses are overextended and weak spots are detected in the enemy's positions, or time pressures do not permit envelopment. The penetration is carried out as part of a frontal attack when there is no assailable flank available. It takes the form of assaulting the enemy positions, creating a rupture, widening of the gap and finally breakthrough. Separate forces are earmarked for the assault and break-out stages of penetration. Penetration has the stages of break in, dog fight and break-out. There are no clear-cut demarcations between these stages and these tend to overlap. Flank attack and other forms of maneuver are preferred to the penetration or frontal attack.

It is loosely based on Émile Zola's 1890 novel La Bête humaine. The story had been filmed twice before: La Bête humaine (1938) directed by Jean Renoir and Die Bestie im Menschen starring Ilka Grüning (1920). Plot Returning Korean War vet Jeff Warren (Glenn Ford) is a train engineer, driving streamliners hauling passenger trains for the fictional Central National railroad. Warren worked alongside Alec Simmons (Edgar Buchanan), and was a boarder in his home, before going off to fight for three years. Jeff has moved back in and is resuming his duties as an engineer. Alec's daughter, Ellen (Kathleen Case), always had a crush on Jeff and, in the interim, has matured into a very attractive young woman who's obviously still smitten with him. Carl Buckley (Broderick Crawford) is a gruff, hard-drinking assistant yard supervisor married to the younger, and more vibrant, Vicki (Gloria Grahame). When Carl is fired for talking back to his boss, he pleads with Vicki to go into the city to see John Owens (Grandon Rhodes), in whose house she lived as a young girl when her mother worked for Owens as a housekeeper. He is an important customer of the railroad, whose influence Carl hopes will result in him getting his job back. Unbeknownst to Carl, Vicki had more than just lived in Owens' house, which the viewer can surmise from Vicki's almost firm but subdued refusal to intercede on her husband's behalf. Nonetheless, after his persistent begging, she reluctantly agrees to go into the city to meet Owens and ask for his help. From her manner, and the way in which Owens greets her, we can tell what Vicki will do in order to get Carl rehired. When Vicki doesn't return for almost five hours, it dawns on Carl that she's been unfaithful. After a violent argument during which he slaps the truth from her, Carl forces Vicki to write a short letter to Owens, setting up a meeting with him later that night in his sleeping car drawing room. He's taking the train to Chicago and Carl and Vicki are returning home. Carl accompanies Vicki to Owens' drawing room, barges in when Owens opens the door, and, with the knife he'd been whittling with on his way into town earlier in the day, Carl kills him. He then takes Owens' wallet and his pocket watch to make the murder appear to be one done in the course of a robbery, and he also takes the letter that Vicki had written. Carl makes it clear that he's keeping the letter as insurance against Vicki's going to the police. Meanwhile, Jeff, who had driven the train Carl and Vicki had taken into town, is now hitching a free ride back home and happens to be smoking in the vestibule near Owens' compartment, blocking the couple's way back to their own. Carl makes Vicki entice Jeff, who isn't acquainted with her, away from the area so Carl can make his way unseen. Vicki and Jeff share a smoke, and a kiss. At the end of the journey, Jeff sees Carl and Vicki together and realizes they're married. At the inquest for the murder of Owens, Jeff is called as a witness. The various passengers on the train that night are asked to stand. When he's asked if he had seen any of the people that night, Jeff looks intently at Vicki, then answers no. Vicki and Jeff soon resume their relationship; she tells him how she's come to be married to Carl and shows him marks on her where Carl has beaten her. She reveals a truncated version of the truth, that she'd gone to Owens' compartment for a liaison, but had found him murdered. Jeff questions how she'd shown no sign of distress when she'd come upon him in the vestibule. Vicki explains that she's frightened of Carl's temper. Meanwhile, Ellen still harbors her feelings for Jeff and sells him a ticket to a local dance; she clearly hopes he'll ask her to go with him, but she also reveals that she knows he's involved with Vicki. After their train departs, Alec lends Jeff friendly advice about being involved with a married woman but Jeff blows it off with the retort \\"Sunday's my day for sermons\\". Later, Jeff tells Vicki he wants to marry her, that she should leave her husband. She finally tells the entire truth about Owens' murder and about the letter. Captivated even still, Jeff says they will work it all out somehow. Carl has become a drunk and has again lost his job. Vicki summons Jeff to let him know that her husband is selling the house and is making her leave town with him. She can't find the letter anywhere, so suspects Carl must keep it with him. She suggests that she and Jeff will have to part forever and says, \\"If only we'd been luckier. If something had happened to him, at the yards.\\" Jeff understands her implication. Carl stumbles, drunk, from Duggan's Bar and starts making his way home through the rail yard. Jeff follows, clutching a large monkey wrench he's retrieved from a tool locker there. A passing train blocks the view, but the viewer will assume Jeff has bludgeoned Carl to death. However, Jeff appears at Vicki's, saying he couldn't do it. He accuses Vicki of setting him up from the start just so he would kill her husband. She protests that she really does love Jeff and that if he loved her he would've killed for her. She tries to equate his Korean War experience in killing men with this situation. Jeff leaves her, but gives her one thing as he goes –– the letter, which he has taken from the drunk Carl's pocket. Vicki is now free to leave Carl and, alone, gets on the next train, which Jeff is engineering. Shortly after it leaves the station, Carl enters Vicki's compartment. He implores her not to leave him, even offers her the letter, but, as he's searching for it in his pockets, she tells him he doesn't have it. He then accuses her of running away with Jeff. She denies this but admits she's in love with Jeff, though he's rejected her because she asked him to murder Carl. Carl strangles her to death. Meanwhile, Jeff has regained some happiness and, as he operates the train, is thinking about the dance he and Ellen will attend together.

For description of Malay villages, see kampung. The Malay Village () was a museum once located in Geylang, Singapore, where they showcases the life of the Malays who used to live in the area before redevelopment in the 1960s. History In the 1960s, Geylang was being redeveloped with the completion of many Housing Development Board (HDB) flats, light industrial estates and complexes. Majlis Pusat, the umbrella body for Malay cultural groups proposed an idea of a Malay village in the 1970s. The purpose is to showcase Malay culture to visitors and to provide a place for selling Malay souvenirs. The suggested location is Pasir Panjang. In August 1980, Ahmad Mattar, the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs, announced plans for the village which the then Minister for National Development, Teh Cheang Wan, gives approval in principle in November 1981. The official approval was given by the Government in February 1984 with Geylang as the chosen site. The construction of the village began in 1986 and completed in November 1989 and it costs the HDB $10 million. In 1990, the Malay Cultural Month was held during its opening from 25 February to 24 March. In September 1991, the Ananda group of companies, run by Hong Kong businessman Clarence Cheung, won the tender with a bid of $3.8 million to run the Malay Village. Plans were proposed to build a $10 million high-tech Islamic cultural museum in the village which did not materialise. Tender for the shops were open in 1992 but only eight shops out of 70 were open with seven out of 45 successful bidders pull out. An advisory panel was also formed. In 2006, a new management, Malay Village Pte Ltd, took over the village and makes a police report with regards to the Malay Village's accounts. However the village has already a six-digit debt with insufficient funds to pay it. In 2008, Malay Village Pte Ltd announces plans to revive the place. However, Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), in the same year, announced plans to demolish the Malay Village after its lease ends in 2011 and to build a suburban commercial hub which includes a civic centre, a 2,000 sq m open plaza space, commercial developments and a new road. Appeals to the URA by shop tenants, management and Marine Parade GRC's Member of Parliament, Fatimah Lateef, were rejected. On 17 November 2010, an Eid al-Adha ritual, organised by the Inter-racial and religious confidence circle of Kampong Ubi Kembangan and Geylang Serai, was held at the Malay Village. It was the first time the ritual was performed there. The Malay Village was chosen as it was the operation centre of Mini Environment Service, the Government's appointed korban vendor. Closure and demolition After 23 years of history, the museum was shut down in 26 September 2011. The structure was eventually demolished in 2012 to make way for a new complex known as Wisma Geylang Serai, which was slated to open in May 2018. The Wisma Geylang Serai was officially opened on 26 January 2019 by Lee Hsien Loong, the 3rd Prime Minister of Singapore.

All Wintuan languages are either extinct or severely endangered. Classification =Family division= Shipley (1978:89) listed three Wintuan languages in his encyclopedic overview of California Indian languages. More recently, Mithun (1999) split Southern Wintuan into a Patwin language and a Southern Patwin language, resulting in the following classification. I. Northern Wintuan : 1. Wintu (a.k.a. Wintu proper, Northern Wintu) (†) : 2. Nomlaki (a.k.a. Noamlakee, Central Wintu) (†) II. Southern Wintuan : 3. Patwin (a.k.a. Patween) : 4. Southern Patwin (†) Wintu became extinct with the death of the last fluent speaker in 2003 (Golla 2011:143). Nomlaki has at least one partial speaker (as of 2010, Golla 2011:143). One speaker of Patwin (Hill Patwin dialect) remained in 2003 (Golla 2011:145). Southern Patwin, once spoken by the Suisun local tribe just northeast of San Francisco Bay, became extinct in the early 20th century and is thus poorly known (Golla 2011:146; Mithun 1999). Wintu proper is the best documented of the four Wintuan languages. Pitkin (1984) estimated that the Wintuan languages were about as close to each other as the Romance languages. They may have diverged from a common tongue only 2,000 years ago. A comparative study including a reconstruction of Proto- Wintun phonology, morphology and lexicon was undertaken by Shepherd (2006). =Possible relations to external language families= The Wintuan family is usually considered to be a member of the hypothetical Penutian language phylum (Golla 2011:128-168) and was one of the five branches of the original California kernel of Penutian proposed by Roland B. Dixon and Alfred L. Kroeber (1913a, 1913b). However, recent studies indicate that the Wintuans independently entered California about 1,500 years ago from an earlier location somewhere in Oregon (Golla 2007:75-78). The Wintuan pronominal system closely resembles that of Klamath, while there are numerous lexical resemblances between Northern Wintuan and Alsea that appear to be loans (Golla 1997; DeLancey and Golla 1997; Liedtke 2007).

It flows eastward to join the Kaveri River at Tirumakudalu Narasipura in Karnataka. Close to the town of Sargur it forms the huge Kabini Reservoir. The backwaters of the Kabini reservoir are very rich in wildlife especially in summer when the water level recedes to form rich grassy meadows. The Kabini dam is in length with an original gross storage of 19.52 tmcft. The Kabini Dam is situated between villages Bichanahalli and Bidarahalli having distance of 6 km away from Sargur town in Heggadadevana kote taluk, Mysore district, Karnataka. Wildlife The kabini Forest Reserve is one of the most popular wildlife destinations of Karnataka, probably because of its accessibility, lush green landscape surrounding a large lake, and sightings of herds of elephants, tigers. It is away from Mysuru and from Bengaluru, and comprises the south-eastern part of Nagarahole National Park. Situated on the banks of the kabini River, the reserve is spread over of forestland, steep valleys, and water bodies. Once a private hunting lodge of the Maharaja of Mysore, kabini was a popular shikar hotspot for British Viceroys and Indian royalty. Now it is considered to be one of the best Wildlife National Parks in India, famous for its spectacular wildlife and bird life. There are around 120 tigers, 100+ leopards, Four types of deer, Sloth bear, Indian Gaurs and elephants in the Nagarahole National Park.

The dam is 696 meters in length and was built in 1974. The exact location of the dam is near village Beechanahally, in Taluk Heggadadevanakote. The catchment area of the dam is 2,141.90 km2. It caters to the needs of around 22 villages and 14 hamlets and also a prominent source of drinking water to Bengaluru. Further significant amount of water is discharged to the Mettur reservoir in Tamilnadu to fulfill the state's needs. This dam also provides water to the combined system of Sagaredoddakere and Upper Nugu Dams. There is an arrangement of lifting and transfer of 28.00 TMC of water during the monsoons months from the kabini dam to the other two smaller dams.

Louis-Émile Bertin (23 March 1840 – 22 October 1924) was a French naval engineer, one of the foremost of his time, and a proponent of the \\"Jeune École\\" philosophy of using light, but powerfully armed warships instead of large battleships. Early life Bertin was born in Nancy, France on 23 March 1840. He entered the Paris École polytechnique in 1858. At exiting the school, he chose the field of Naval Engineering (Corps du génie maritime). His role model was Henri Dupuy de Lôme, who had designed the first ironclad warship in France. Bertin came to be known for his innovative designs, often at odds with conventional wisdom, and won international recognition as a leading naval architect. In 1871, he also became a doctor of laws, showing great versatility of talents. Life in Japan In 1885, the Japanese government persuaded the French Génie Maritime to send Bertin as a special foreign advisor to the Imperial Japanese Navy for a period of four years from 1886 to 1890. Bertin was tasked with training Japanese engineers and naval architects, designing and constructing modern warships, and naval facilities. For Bertin, then aged 45, it was an extraordinary opportunity to design an entire navy. For the French government, it represented a major coup in their fight against Great Britain and Germany for influence over the newly-industrializing Empire of Japan. While in Japan, Bertin designed and constructed seven major warships and 22 torpedo boats, which formed the nucleus of the budding Imperial Japanese Navy. These included the three protected cruisers, which featured a single but immensely powerful Canet main gun, which formed the core of the Japanese fleet during the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895. Bertin also directed the construction of the naval shipyards and arsenals of Kure and Sasebo. However, Bertin's time in Japan was also plagued by political intrigue. There were strong factions with the Japanese government who favored the British or Germans over the French, or who still begrudged the French for their previous strong support of the Tokugawa bakufu. Bertin's position was more than once put into jeopardy. That Japan was gambling on the yet-untested Jeune École philosophy in approving Bertin's designs was also of concern. His efforts in building up the Imperial Japanese Navy, made a decisive contribution to the Japanese victory at the Battle of the Yalu, 17 September 1894, Japanese Admiral Itō Sukeyuki, (who had been on board the flagship Matsushima) wrote to Bertin: :\\"The ships fulfilled all our hopes. They were the formidable elements of our fleet; because of their powerful armament and intelligent design, we were able to win a brilliant victory against the Chinese armoured ships\\". (Yuko Ito\\"La Marine moderne d'Émile Bertin\\", pp. 167–170) Émile Bertin received the Order of the Rising Sun, second class, from the Meiji Emperor at the end of 1890. During the ceremony, the Navy Minister Saigo Tsugumichi (1843–1902) declared: :\\"Not only did Bertin establish the plans for the construction of coastal ships and first-class cruisers, he also made suggestions for the organization of the fleet, the defense of our coasts, the construction of high-caliber guns, the usage of materials such as steel or coal.; during the four years he has been in Japan, he never stopped working for the technical improvement of the Navy, and the results of his efforts are remarquable\\" (Tokyo, January 23, 1890\\"France-Japon Eco, No97, p. 82) =Warships designed or built while in Japan= * 3 cruisers: the 4,700-ton and , made in France, and , built by Japan in Yokosuka, Japan. * 3 coastal warships of 4,278 tons. * 2 small cruisers: , a small cruiser of 2,439 tons built in Great Britain, and , 1,800 tons, built at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, Japan. * 1 light cruiser: , built in France. * 1 frigate, the 1,600-ton , built in Yokosuka. * 16 torpedo boats of 54 tons each, built in France by the Companie du Creusot in 1888, and assembled in Japan. Subsequent life Upon his return to France, Bertin was promoted to Director of the School of Naval Engineering (Ecole du Génie Maritime). In 1895 he became the Director of Naval Construction (Directeur des Constructions Navales) with the rank of General Engineer (ingénieur général). During his tenure as Director, the French Navy became the second navy in the world in terms of tonnage. Back in France, ironically he found himself at odds with the supporters of Admiral Hyacinthe Aube's Jeune École, and he more than once criticized the designs of his fellow constructors; his criticisms were later justified by the catastrophic sinking of the battleship Bouvet in 1915. He was inducted in the famous Institut de France in 1903. Legacy Bertin's concept of lightly armored, heavily-gunned cruisers was soon overtaken by the pre-dreadnoughts; by the time of the Russo- Japanese War of 1904–1905, the concepts of the Jeune École had largely been discredited. The Japanese were not happy with the overall performance of the Matsushima-class vessels, and after the cruiser sank en route from France to Japan in December 1886, Bertin's later designs were ordered from British, rather than French shipyards. Bertin's real legacy for Japan was his creation of a series of modern shipyards, most notably Kure and Sasebo (Yokosuka, Japan's first modern arsenal, was built earlier in 1865 by the French engineer Léonce Verny). During World War I, those very yards built twelve s for France's embattled fleet. The French cruiser . After his death, a light cruiser of the French Navy, , was named in his honour. Émile Bertin also invented the twin-oscillographer (to study roll and pitch). The cruiser named in his honour would be, in 1940, the ship that transferred the gold reserves of the Bank of France to the Martinique, preventing Nazi Germany from seizing the precious metal, of which France retained an important amount.

Its summit is the highest point in the unitary council area of Cheshire East and in the former administrative county of Cheshire (1974–2009). However, it is not as often stated the (historic) county top of Cheshire, as this title belongs to Black Hill (height ) near Crowden. The word tor means a high rock, and is a loan word from Old Brythonic. The hill forms a long moorland ridge running north–south between Whaley Bridge and the A537 road to the west of the Cat and Fiddle Inn, which also includes Cats Tor ( high) to the north. (There is another hill named Shining Tor, above Dovedale in Derbyshire, at grid reference .)  Ascent  The hill offers very pleasant walking and can be climbed by many routes, perhaps most commonly from the Upper Goyt Valley by Errwood reservoir, perhaps combined with a walk along the ridge north from Shining Tor over Cats Tor. It can also be gained with less climbing from the Cat and Fiddle Inn.  Views  As it is the highest point around (it is some higher than the summit of Axe Edge Moor above Buxton), the views are pleasant, though the relatively flat uplands mean they are not extensive in all directions: the view to the southwest of the peak of Shutlingsloe above Wildboarclough is particularly notable, and in clear conditions Winter Hill near Bolton, the city of Manchester and much of the Cheshire Plain can be seen, including the radio telescopes at Jodrell Bank to the west. In very clear but not unusual conditions North Wales and even Snowdonia can be seen. The hill is used by amateur radio operators for Summits On The Air activations (G/SP-004, 2 points).Summits on the Air - Shining Tor - G/SP-004 Cat and Fiddle road from Shining Tor.  Geology  The north–south ridge of Shining Tor including the summit itself is formed from the Chatsworth Grit, a thick sandstone of Namurian age which occurs widely across the Peak District. The beds dip moderately steeply to the east into a north–south-aligned syncline known as the Goyt Trough. Shining Tor is thought to have stood above the ice sheet during the last ice age and so is free from glacial deposits.

A Major League Baseball roster is a roster of players allowed, by league agreement, to play for their respective Major League Baseball (MLB) team. Each MLB team maintains two rosters; an active roster of players eligible to participate in an MLB game, and an expanded roster encompassing the active roster plus additional reserve players. As of , the active roster size was 25 players, and the expanded roster size was 40 players (the expanded roster is commonly referred to as the \\"40-man roster\\"). MLB planned to expand the active roster to 26 players in . However, following the delayed start of that season, MLB allowed teams to carry 28 players on their active rosters during 2020. Active roster Since 1910, when teams were first allowed to carry players under contract in excess of those allowed to participate in regular season games, the latter has been called the \\"active roster.\\" With exceptions through the years for varying economic conditions (primarily during World War I, the Great Depression, post-World War II, and from 1986 to 1989 when the limit was set at 24 because of rising player salaries), the active roster has allowed up to 25 players to participate for a Major League team within specified dates, currently Opening Day to September 1. In 1968, the 25-player maximum for active rosters was made a part of the first collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the major leagues and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA). Since 1977, teams have been required to carry a minimum of 24 players on their active rosters as well. Active rosters include the starting eight (National League) or nine (American League) position players, pitchers, and reserve players on the team. Players on the active roster are also on the 40-man roster. These players are generally the only ones who dress in uniform and are the only ones who may take the field in a game at any time. Typically, in modern-day play, an active roster will consist of five starting pitchers, seven relief pitchers, two catchers, six infielders, and five outfielders. Teams can vary this somewhat according to preference and circumstance, and indeed the \\"typical\\" roster makeup has changed somewhat over the years. (Starting rotations used to consist of four pitchers, not five, well into the 1970s; third-string catchers used to be much more common; many other minor variations exist.) In the American League, a full-time designated hitter (DH) is usually classified as either an infielder or an outfielder, not a DH, because most DHs do play defensive positions from time to time. Since the , teams have been allowed 26-player active rosters for \\"day-night\\" doubleheaders—two games scheduled on the same day, but with the stadium cleared between games, and separate tickets sold for each game—as long as the doubleheaders have been scheduled with at least 48 hours of advance notice. Teams are also allowed a 26th player for games played at neutral sites, such as the MLB Little League Classic. =Changes effective 2020= On March 14, 2019, MLB and the MLBPA reached an agreement on midterm changes to the then-current CBA that will affect future roster sizes, with the changes officially unveiled on February 12, 2020. Effective with the 2020 season, teams will be allowed 26-man active rosters from the start of the season through August 31, as well as the postseason. Teams will be limited to carrying 13 pitchers except from September 1 to the end of the regular season, when this limit rises to 14. For any events during which a 26-man roster was allowed before 2020, the active roster on those days will expand to 27; the 27th player does not count against the limit for pitchers. The agreement also introduced a playing rule that places severe limits on pitching by position players. Each team must designate players as either \\"position players\\" or \\"pitchers\\" before the start of the season, and that designation cannot be changed during the season. Only players who are designated as \\"pitchers\\" will be allowed to pitch in any regular-season or postseason game, with the following exceptions: * One team is ahead by at least 7 runs when the player has assumed a pitching role. * The game is in extra innings. * The player serving as pitcher has earned the status of \\"two- way player\\". A player earns two-way status by satisfying both of the following criteria, in either the current season or the immediately preceding season: * Pitching at least 20 MLB innings. * Playing in at least 20 MLB games as a position player or designated hitter, with at least three plate appearances in each of the 20 games. For the 2020 season only, a player who met the above qualifications in either 2018 or 2019 will be considered a two-way player. This means that Shohei Ohtani, who did not pitch in the 2019 season during his recovery from Tommy John surgery, will be considered a two-way player in 2020, since he met these requirements in 2018. Expanded roster Also called the \\"40-man roster\\", the expanded roster is composed of all the players in a Major League club's organization who are signed to a major-league contract. The 40-man roster limit was in effect from 1921 to 2019, except for 1945 and 1946 when it was raised to 48 to accommodate veterans returning from military service in World War II, from 1962 to 1965 when it was raised to 41 to add a reserve spot for first-year players acquired before implementation of a player draft was approved prior to the 1965 season, and in 1994 for a strike that canceled the remainder of the 1994 season. The expanded roster included all players who were eligible for call-up to the active roster at any given time. Also on the 40-man roster are any players on the 10-day injured list (known as the \\"disabled list\\" prior to the 2019 season) and minor league players who are signed to a major-league contract but are on an \\"optional assignment\\" to the minors. (Each player has three \\"option years\\" to be sent to the minors once on the expanded roster before he must be placed on waivers to be sent there.) A player who is on the 40-man roster but is later placed on the 60-day injured list is removed from the 40-man roster until his time on the injured list is over. The same applies to players who are suspended. Because players on the 60-day injured list are taken off the 40-man roster with no risk of losing the player, MLB teams often transfer injured players from the 10-day injured list to the 60-day injured list so that the team can add another player to the 40-man roster without having to designate a player for assignment. Designating for assignment (\\"DFA\\") is the removal of a player from the expanded roster; the team has seven days to trade the player http://m.mlb.com/glossary/transactions/designate-for-assignment, release him, or send him to the minors. =September call-ups= Fred Lynn made his MLB debut as a September call up in 1974; he would later be the American League's Rookie of the Year and MVP in 1975. September call-ups are players who, historically, were added to MLB rosters late in the season. Historical practice Through the 2019 season, every MLB team's roster expanded on September 1 from the 25-man active roster to the entire 40-man roster. Thus, any player on the expanded roster on September 1 or later could play for the MLB team through the end of the regular season. September call-ups were often younger players who were being given major league experience and, especially for teams in playoff contention, players who could provide positional depth, such as a third catcher or additional relief pitchers. In practice, teams usually did not have the entire 40-man roster on hand for games; typically, clubs would have about six additional players available over the usual limit of 25. There were exceptions—for example; during the 2018 season, the Los Angeles Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies used their full rosters, and in 2019 the Boston Red Sox carried 36 players (including 21 pitchers). In 2003, the Montreal Expos were leading the National League wild card race, and in what many people deemed to be a conflict of interest, Major League Baseball, which owned the Expos at the time, refused to allow them to call any players up, claiming they could not afford the additional expenses. During the final years of the 40-man active roster, one perceived problem was that teams were allowed to carry any number of players between 25 and 40 on their September rosters. Shortly after the decision to curtail September roster expansion was announced, former Milwaukee Brewers general manager Doug Melvin, who had advocated changes to September roster rules for more than a decade, made the following remarks to a USA Today writer: > I think people got sick of me talking about it, but it was about the > integrity of the game. . . . It got to be such a huge imbalance. It would be > one thing if teams just had a couple of more players than the other team in > September, but we were seeing differences by more than 10 players a game. To > me, it was destroying the integrity of it. No other sport has uneven rosters > at any point in the season, and we were doing it [in] the pennant race. Current practice From 2020 forward, the expanded roster has been eliminated. Each team is still allowed to have up to 40 players under major- league contracts, and active rosters are now normally 26 players, with an expansion to 28 from September 1 through the end of the regular season. Additionally, all teams are now required to have 28 players on their active rosters after August 31 (they cannot carry a lower number of players). Adjustments to these limits may be implemented by MLB, such as during the delayed and shortened 2020 MLB season, when teams were allowed to begin the season with 30 players on their active rosters. Postseason roster Adalberto Mondesí made his MLB debut during the 2015 World Series. A postseason roster takes effect only if a team clinches a playoff berth. Players who are part of the team's final roster at the end of the regular season are eligible to participate in the postseason. Any player who has been traded from a different team, spent time in the Minor Leagues, or signed later in the season with the team (no later than August 31) is eligible to participate in the postseason; players who are suspended for drug use are not allowed to participate in the postseason. From 2020, a postseason roster is allowed up to 26 active players (up from 25 through 2019), with a maximum of 13 pitchers (new for 2020); qualifying two-way players do not count against the limit on pitchers. Other players who are not on the 26-man active roster will be assigned to the postseason secondary squad. Players who are on the injured list or any other non-active transaction by the end of the regular season will have their transactions passed on in the postseason. Rosters for a series are set at the beginning of the series and no changes to the 26-man active roster are allowed except when a player is moved to the injured list or any other inactive transaction. If a player is moved to the injured list or another inactive transaction during a series, he then becomes ineligible to be returned to the 26-man active roster for the remainder of the series as well as the next series if applicable. If any player goes on any inactive transaction, any player from the 40-man roster can be promoted to the 26-man active roster for the remainder of the series if applicable. For a player to be eligible for the postseason active roster, he must have either been on his club's expanded roster or injured list as of midnight (ET) on August 31 of that year and not placed on the 60-day injured list after August 1. The one exception is for replacing players on the injured list. Since the 2014 season, an injured player eligible for postseason play may be replaced by any player within his club's organization, including players assigned to the club's minor league affiliates who are not on the major league 40-man roster. Prior to 2014, only players who were on a club's 40-man roster (including those added to the expanded roster after August 31, who would not otherwise be eligible for the postseason) at the conclusion of the regular season were eligible to replace injured players on postseason rosters. The 2015 Kansas City Royals were the first club to exploit this new provision when they added Adalberto Mondesí—who at the time was assigned to the Royals' Double-A affiliate and was not on the 40-man roster—to their World Series roster. Non-roster players All other professional players affiliated with Major League Baseball are signed to minor-league contracts. They can receive an invitation to spring training with their organization's Major League team without being on the 40-man roster. Two types of players generally receive a non-roster invitation: prospect players who are there to gain experience and face tougher competition as well as receive instruction from the Major League team's coaching staff; and veteran players who were not offered any major league contract by a club. The veteran player is usually signed to a \\"two-way\\" salary option—one for their time in the minors and another if they are placed on the 40-man during the season. All spring training invitees are under some sort of contract, to avoid liability if an injury were to occur to the player. All-Star roster Since 1933, an annual Major League Baseball All-Star Game has been played at approximately the mid-point of each season, except for 1945 and 2020. The game features an American League team versus a National League team. The number of players on All-Star rosters has varied; since 2010, there are 34 players on each league's roster.

Early life and education Cohan was born in 1950 in Hanford, California, the only child of John and Helen Cohan, who divorced when he was seven. John Cohan was originally from Texas and created businesses in Salinas, California, including a restaurant and later the television station KSBW. After his parents' divorce, Chris Cohan lived in Salinas with his mother and moved to Los Gatos, California as a teenager, where he graduated in 1968 from Los Gatos High School. Cohan attended Arizona State University, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in recreation; in two news stories in 1994, Cohan incorrectly claimed to have studied business at Arizona State. Career In 1977, Cohan had founded Sonic Communications in 1977, which became one of the largest independently owned cable outlets in the country before he sold it in May 1998.Golden State Warriors 2009-2010 media guide He assumed control of the team in October 1994 prior to the 1994-95 season for a reported fee totaling at $130 million and helped renovate the Warriors' arena (now known as Oakland Arena). Under Cohan's ownership, however, the team experienced only two winning seasons and one trip to the playoffs in 16 seasons. As of 2005, Cohan's net worth was around $325 million. In May 2007, Cohan was reportedly fighting a $160 million tax-evasion charge in federal court in the aftermath of his 1998 sale of Sonic Communications for more than $200 million. In May 2009, Sports Illustrated listed the top ten best and worst owners of basketball teams, ranking Cohan as fourth worst. He criticized Cohan for sticking with coach Don Nelson as part of the Warriors' generally poor performance apart from their 2007 playoff first-round upset of the top- seeded Dallas Mavericks. He pointed out that Golden State was repeatedly rebuilding without much success. In the wake of such criticism and controversy, he finally sold the Warriors to Peter Guber and Joe Lacob for $450 million in July 2010. Cohan has homes in San Francisco, California and East Hampton, New York.

The Group also has two radio stations: MBC FM and Panorama FM. MBC was founded in 1991 and initially headquartered in London. London was chosen so as to be seen as detached from Arab governments, however its headquarters was later moved to Dubai. The aim of MBC was to provide a view of the world \\"through Arabian eyes\\". MBC's funding is largely through commercial sources, which provides a foothold for multinational corporations in the Arab market. MBC has also provided some support to social causes, including telethons in the 1990s for the people of Bosnia and Palestine. MBC was the first broadcaster to provide a satellite-based free-to-air 24-hour television network across the Arab world. It has remained privately owned, managed by a group of businessmen and shareholders, including chairman and CEO Sheikh Waleed Al Ibrahim. The shareholder list has never been verified although an American academic states that it is owned by members of the Saudi royal family and cablegate leaks revealed the US Ambassador had been told that MBC is owned by Waleed bin Ibrahim Al Ibrahim, the chairman of the channel and brother-in- law of the late King Fahd, half of the profits go to King Fahd's son, Abdulaziz bin Fahd.

In recent years MBC has been hit with major rounds of financial cuts, leading to 150 layoffs and major production cuts. These cuts were driven in part due to advertising not covering production costs and the failure to acquire exclusive rights to the Saudi league. As of 2011 MBC reported 165 million viewers.

Controversy  In 2017 a number of owners and board members of MBC were summoned to Riyadh where they were arrested, accused of corruption, and locked in the Ritz-Carlton. These moves came following years of the Saudi Crown Prince attempting to purchase the media company. After 83 days the company's chief owner Waleed al-Ibrahim was released. Following this crackdown, the Saudi government took a 60% control of MBC - leaving the remaining 40% to Waleed al-Ibrahim. In 2007 MBC began airing its first Turkish soap opera dubbed into another language. Over the next few years these programs became a major success for MBC, with over 85 million viewing the finale of Gümüş. In 2018, MBC moved to remove all Turkish programming from their channels. While no official reason was given, many saw this as a political move, as it was made shortly after the Saudi government took a majority stake in MBC following the lock-down at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh. MBC has come under global scrutiny for its use of blackface in popular programming. Popular Egyptian comedian Shaimaa Seif has done a number of programs on MBC using blackface and stereotypes for humor. While some social media backlash has occurred, Seif and MBC have not changed in regards to their content. Some have raised concern of the amount of American advertisements on MBC channels, with some studies suggesting over 50% of advertising time is devoted towards American products such as those from Johnson & Johnson, Kellogg's, and PepsiCo. These critics state that this leads to cultural imperialism and erodes at the native cultures of areas in the Middle East and North Africa. In a study focused on Algerian consumer preferences, it was found that these consumers were drawn to American advertisements and products advertised on MBC. This in turn led Algerian companies to mimic the advertising style and aesthetic of American companies.  Use of technology  In 2010, MBC Max provided the ability to watch English movies with Arabic voices, along with watching English movies (English voices) with or without Arabic subtitles. In July 2011, MBC launched 11 of its channels in HD which includes MBC 1, MBC 2, MBC 3, MBC 4, MBC 6, MBC Action, MBC Max, MBC Bollywood, MBC Iraq, MBC Drama and Al Arabiya. These HD versions of these channels are encrypted using Conax while SD are FTA. In 2017 Snapchat expanded its \\"Discover\\" feature to provide content from regional providers including MBC.

He ranks 25th among the 36 Heavenly Spirits, the first third of the 108 Liangshan heroes, and is nicknamed \\"Winged Tiger\\". Background The novel depicts Lei Heng as about seven chi tall, having a purplish face and sporting a big fan-like beard. Strong and skilled in martial arts, he could leap over relatively wide streams and creeks as well as fairly high walls. This talent earns him the nickname \\"Winged Tiger\\". After being a blacksmith and a butcher, he becomes a chief constable in his native Yuncheng County (in present-day Heze, Shandong). He is a close friend of Zhu Tong, his partner chief constable, and Chao Gai, the headman of the Dongxi village in Yuncheng. One night when out on a patrol, Lei Heng happens upon Liu Tang, who has fallen asleep in a rundown temple after getting drunk. Certain that Liu, with his strange and vagabond looks, is up to no good in the neighbourhood, Lei orders his men to tie him up before he could put up a fight. The party then stops for a rest in Chao Gai's manor. Chao secretly checks on Liu Tang, who is suspended in a side room. Liu tells him he has come to seek his collaboration to hijack some valuables in transportation to the Grand Tutor Cai Jing in the imperial capital Dongjing. Chao lies to Lei Heng that Liu is his nephew, thus winning the man's release. However, still bitter over the arrest, Liu catches up with Lei as he returns to his office and challenges him to a fight. Chao Gai arrives at the scene and stops the clash. The hijackers eventually number seven with the participation of Wu Yong, Gongsun Sheng and the Ruan Brothers. With the help of Bai Sheng, who poses as a wine seller, they succeed in seizing the valuables at the Yellow Mud Ridge by drugging the escorts of the gifts led by Yang Zhi. But the authorities soon track down essential clues and the magistrate of Yuncheng sends Zhu Tong and Lei Heng to seize Chao Gai at his house. Both want to let Chao go but they hide the intention from each other. Zhu Tong prevails on Lei to enter Chao's house through the front door while he himself guards the back knowing Chao would come that way. Lei nevertheless makes noise to warn Chao as his men intrude into the house. As expected by Zhu, Chao and his gang leave by the back and escape with his help. Becoming an outlaw One day Lei Heng goes to hear a songstress named Bai Xiuying sing at a tea house. But he forgets to bring his wallet. So when Bai comes to collect money for her performance, Lei, who takes the best seat in the front row, is embarrassed. Bai and her father Bai Yuqiao pass some unkind remarks at Lei, who loses his temper and hits the old man in anger. It turns out that Bai Xiuying is having an affair with the magistrate of Yuncheng. So, Lei Heng is arrested following complaint by Bai. With a cangue fastened around his neck, he is further humiliated by being made to stand tethered outside the county office. Lei Heng's elderly mother brings food for him and gets into a quarrel with Bai Xiuying when the songstress refuses to let her untie his son. Bai slaps Lei Heng's mother, causing Lei, a filial son, to slam his cangue on to her head, killing the woman. Exiled to Jizhou (薊州; present-day Ji County, Tianjin) on a manslaughter charge, Lei is escorted there by Zhu Tong. On the way, Zhu releases Lei, who seeks refuge in Liangshan Marsh taking along his mother. Campaigns and death Lei Heng is appointed as one of the leaders of the Liangshan infantry after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly. He participates in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces in Song territory following amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan. In the battle at Deqing County (in present-day Huzhou, Zhejiang) in the campaign against Fang La, Lei Heng is slain by the enemy general Si Xingfang. He is posthumously awarded the title \\"Martial Gentleman of Loyalty\\" ().

As a scholar he applied the Confucian idea of the \\"superior man\\" to the samurai class of Japan. This became an important part of the samurai way of life and code of conduct. Biography Yamaga Sokō had been studying the Chinese classics since the age of six, and at nine became a student of Hayashi Razan, a follower of Neo-Confucianism responsible for its development as the official doctrine of the Tokugawa shogunate.Nussbaum, Louis Frédéric et al. (2005). \\"Yamaga Sokō\\" in ; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, see Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File . However, at the age of forty he broke away from the official doctrine and changed his concept of Confucianism, burning all of the books he had written while still under its influence. This, along with the publishing of a philosophical work entitled Seikyo Yoroku, caused him to be removed from the bureaucracy and exiled outside Edo (modern-day Tokyo). Soon after being exiled, he moved to the Akō Domain, befriending Asano Nagatomo and becoming an important teacher of Confucianism and military science in the region. Yamaga's influence would later be expressed in the Genroku Akō incident, as its leader, Ōishi Yoshio, had been a devoted pupil of his. Yamaga wrote a series of works dealing with \\"the warrior's creed\\" (bukyō) and \\"the way of the gentleman\\" (shidō). In this way he described the lofty mission of the warrior class and its attendant obligations. According to William Scott Wilson in his Ideals of the Samurai, Yamaga \\"in his theory of Shidō (a less radical theory than bushidō), defined the warrior as an example of Confucian purity to the other classes of society, and as punisher of those who would stray from its path\\". Wilson wrote that Yamaga thought of the samurai as a \\"sort of Warrior-Sage\\" and focused his writings on the perfection of this \\"transcendent ideal\\", but \\"this direction of thinking ... was typical of the scholars of the Edo Period in its tendency toward speculation\\". He re-emphasized that the peaceful arts, letters, and history were essential to the intellectual discipline of the samurai. Yamaga thus symbolizes the historical transformation of the samurai class from a purely military aristocracy to one of increasing political and intellectual leadership.De Bary, William et al. (2001). Sources Of Japanese Tradition: Volume 2, 1600 to 2000, p. 186. One of his pupils was Daidōji Yūzan, a samurai from the Daidōji family, who would become the author of an important bushidō text, Budō shoshin shu. He also drew attention to the need to study and adopt Western weapons and tactics, as introduced by the Dutch. In 1665, Yamaga publicly avowed his antipathy for Neo-Confucianism in the Essence of Confucianism and was arrested the following year at the instigation of Hoshina Masayuki, Lord of Aizu. Yamaga proclaimed his belief that the unadulterated truth could only be found in the ethical teachings of Confucius, and that subsequent developments within the Confucian tradition represented perversions of the original doctrine. Hoshina, however, saw this attack as a potential challenge to Tokugawa authority itself, and Yamaga was subsequently exiled to stay with the Asano daimyō in the Akō domain (han), where his life intersects with the tale of the forty-seven rōnin, which was later retold in a classic of Japanese literature, Chūshingura.Trumbull, Stephen. (1996). The Samurai: A Military History. p. 265; Tucker, John. (2002). \\"Tokugawa Intellectual History and Prewar Ideology: The Case of Inoue Tetsujirō, Yamaga Sokō, and the Forty- Seven Rōnin\\", in Sino-Japanese Studies. Vo. 14, pp. 35–70. The life of his near contemporary Matsudaira Sadanobu presents a plausible context for more fully understanding and appreciating Yamaga's life. Both believed entirely in the civic and personal values of Confucianism, but both construed those precepts a little differently because of their places in Edo period society.Shuzo Uenaka. (1977). \\"Last Testament in Exile. Yamaga Sokō's Haisho Zampitsu\\", Monumenta Nipponica, 32:2, No. 2, pp. 125–152. In his own time, this conception of Confucian values was among the factors that led him to draw attention to the need to study and adopt Western weapons and tactics, as introduced by the Dutch. Yamaga's conception restated and codified the writings of past centuries and pointed to the emperor as the focus of all loyalties. His teachings, therefore, had direct application for everyone in the existing feudal structure, and he was not calling for a change in the status of the emperor. Chucho Jijitsu An important theme running through Yamaga's life and works was a focus on the greatness of Japan, and this became one of the reasons his popularity and influence were to expand in the rising nationalistic culture of the mid-twentieth century.Varley, Paul. (20000). Japanese Culture. p. 213. Living at a time when very few texts were written in Japanese and Japanese scholars devoted themselves to the study of Chinese history, literature, and philosophy, he wrote the Chucho Jijitsu (which translates as \\"Actual Facts about the Central Realm\\") to awaken Japanese scholars to the greatness of their own national history and culture. His argument is that Japan is a gift of the gods to the Japanese people, and that while many nations (here his readers would have understood him to refer to China) consider their country to be the center of the world, on the objective basis of temperate climate, only China and Japan can justify such claims, and of the two Japan is clearly superior because it is favored by the gods, as proven by the fact that only in Japan is there an unbroken Imperial line descended from the gods themselves.Earl, David Magarey, Emperor and Nation in Japan,; Political Thinkers of the Tokugawa Period, University of Washington Press, Seattle, 1964, pp. 45 ff. The tone of the work can be appreciated in this excerpt: \\"The water and soil of Japan excel those of all other countries, and the qualities of its people are supreme throughout the eight corners of the earth. For this reason, the boundless eternity of its gods and the endlessness of the reign of its sacred line, its splendid works of literature and glorious feats of arms, shall be as enduring as heaven and earth.\\"cited in Earl, David Magarey, Emperor and Nation in Japan,; Political Thinkers of the Tokugawa Period, University of Washington Press, Seattle, 1964, p. 46 Notes References * De Bary, William Theodore, Carol Gluck and Arthur E.

Role in political repressions According to the US and the European Union, the Presidential Security Service and its commanders are actively involved in human rights violations and political repressions in Belarus. =Role during the referendum of 1996= According to the Belarusian opposition, the Presidential Security Service has played a key role in the events around the controversial referendum of 1996, which has resulted in the dissolution of the disloyal Supreme Soviet of Belarus and an ultimate concentration of state power in the hands of authoritarian president Alexander Lukashenko. Before the controversial referendum, the Presidential Security Service has blocked the office of the Central Election Commission of Belarus and prevented the Head of the Commission, Viktar Hanchar from executing his role. Lidia Yermoshina, a member of the Commission loyal to Lukashenko, has been appointed instead of Hanchar. Three years later, Viktar Hanchar has disappeared and was presumably murdered. After the events, the United States State Department stated that the Presidential Guard is a secret police force under the control of President Alexander Lukashenko.

Nicknamed \\"Unrestrained\\", he ranks 24th among the 36 Heavenly Spirits, the first third of the 108 Stars of Destiny. Background The novel depicts Mu Hong as good-looking with eyebrows that look like silkworms. Skilled in martial arts and fearless of dangers, he is nicknamed \\"Unrestrained\\". Mu Hong has a younger brother Mu Chun, who is nicknamed \\"Little Unrestrained\\". Wealthy and domineering in Jieyang Town (揭陽鎮; believed to be in present-day Jiujiang, Jiangxi), their home town near Xunyang River, the brothers are feared by the local townsmen. Meeting Song Jiang  When Song Jiang is exiled to Jiangzhou (江州; present- day Jiujiang, Jiangxi) as a mitigated sentence for killing his mistress Yan Poxi, he passes by Jieyang Town and meets Xue Yong, a street performer of martial arts. Xue, from out of town, has neglected to go pay respect to the Mu brothers before staging his show. Feeling snubbed, the Mu brothers have ordered the locals not to reward him a cent. Song Jiang, sympathetic with Xu over his good but unrewarded performance, tips him generously. Mu Chun, who is in the crowd watching, rushes forth to beat Song for making his family look bad. However, he is floored by Xue Yong. Humiliated, Mu Chun orders the local inns not to accommodate Song Jiang and his two escorts for the night. Song ends up in the manor of the Mus, whose father kindly offers them free lodgings, unbeknown to the brothers. Song Jiang overhears Mu Chun looking for Mu Hong, who is resting after some drinks, to help track him down. He also learns that Xue Yong has been captured and subject to beating. So he and the two escorts sneak away under the cover of night. When the Mu brothers learn that Song Jiang has just got away, they pursue them to the bank of Xunyang River. In desperation, the three board the boat of the pirate Zhang Heng. When they are halfway across, Zhang tells them they would be robbed and killed. Fortunately, Zhang‘s friend Li Jun, whom Song has recently befriended, happens to come by in a boat. Li recognises Song and prevents the killing. Zhang apologises to Song, whom he has long revered for his chivalry. Mu Hong and his brother, who are waiting at the bank, are shocked too to learn that the exile is Song Jiang, whom they too admire. They treat Song as an honoured guest at the manor of the Mus before seeing him off to Jiangzhou. Joining Liangshan Song Jiang is arrested and sentenced to death for composing a seditious poem, which he wrote on the wall of a restaurant after getting drunk. The outlaws from Liangshan Marsh hurry to Jiangzhou, storm the execution ground and rescue him and the chief warden Dai Zong, who is implicated for trying to rescue Song. After fleeing Jiangzhou, the group is stranded at a riverbank. Luckily, Mu Hong and other friends of Song Jiang from the Jieyang region arrive in boats on their way to rescue Song. The manor of the Mus serves as the base of the outlaws as they attack Wuwei Garrison to capture the minor official Huang Wenbing, who has reported Song's seditious poem to the authorities. Huang is taken to the Mus' house, where he is cut into pieces. Mu Hong and his brother then follows the band to Liangshan. Campaigns and death Mu Hong is appointed as one of the Eight Tiger Cub Vanguard Generals of the Liangshan cavalry after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly. He participates in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces in Song territory following amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan. Mu Hong makes great contributions in the campaigns, particularly in the capture of Runzhou (潤州; present-day Runzhou District, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) in the expedition against Fang La. But he dies of illness in Hangzhou before Fang's rebellion is completely snuffed out. He is awarded a posthumous title.

The satellite map of Yamal Peninsula The Yamal Peninsula () is located in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug of northwest Siberia, Russia. It extends roughly 700 km (435 mi) and is bordered principally by the Kara Sea, Baydaratskaya Bay on the west, and by the Gulf of Ob on the east. At the northern end of this peninsula lie the Malygina Strait and, beyond it, Bely Island. In the language of its indigenous inhabitants, the Nenets, \\"Yamal\\" means \\"End of the Land\\".  History  Reindeer herders on the Yamal Peninsula in 1975 The peninsula consists mostly of permafrost ground and is geologically a very young place —some areas are less than ten thousand years old. Yamal is inhabited by a multitude of migratory bird species. The well-preserved remains of Lyuba, a 37,000-year-old mammoth calf, were found by a reindeer herder on the peninsula in the summer of 2007. The animal was female and was determined to be one month old at the time of death. On 21 October 2016 a Russian Mi-8 helicopter carrying oil and gas workers crashed there, killing at least 19 of the 22 people on board.  Reindeer husbandry  According to Sven Haakanson, within the Russian Federation, the Yamal peninsula is the place where traditional large-scale nomadic reindeer husbandry is best preserved. Nenets and Khanty reindeer herders hold about half a million domestic reindeer.  Development  Russian icebreaker Tor in the ice-covered port of Sabetta Obskaya–Bovanenkovo railway was built for the gas fields around Bovanenkovo The area is largely undeveloped, but work is ongoing with several large infrastructure projects, including a gas pipeline and several bridges. Yamal holds Russia's biggest natural gas reserves. The 572 km Obskaya–Bovanenkovo railway, completed in 2011, is the northernmost railway in the world. Russian gas monopolist Gazprom had planned to develop the Yurkharovskoye gas field by 2011–2012. The peninsula's gas reserves are estimated to be 55 trillion cubic meters (tcm). Russia's largest energy project in history, known as the Yamal project, puts the future of nomadic reindeer herding at considerable risk. Yamal craters In 2014, Yamal was the discovery site of a distinct sinkhole, or pingo, which quickly drew the attention of world media. The sinkhole appeared to be the result of a huge explosion and several hypotheses were suggested to explain the formation of the crater, including a hit by a meteorite or a UFO, or the collapse of an underground gas facility. A spokesperson for the Yamal branch of the Emergencies Ministry said, \\"We can definitely say that it’s not a meteorite.\\" The 60-meter (66-yard) crater is believed by a senior researcher from the Scientific Research Center of the Arctic, Andrei Plekhanov, in remarks to the Associated Press, to be likely the result of a \\"buildup of excessive pressure\\" underground because of warming regional temperatures in that portion of Siberia. Tests conducted by Plekhanov's team showed unusually high concentrations of methane near the bottom of the sinkhole. The destabilization of gas hydrates containing huge amounts of methane gas are believed to have caused the craters on the Yamal Peninsula. As of 2015, the Yamal peninsula had at least five similar craters. Another crater appeared in August 2020.https://siberiantimes.com/other/others/news/giant-new-50-metre- deep-crater-opens-up-in-arctic-tundra/ Offshore methane leaks According to researchers at Norway's (CAGE), through a process called geothermal heat flux, the Siberian permafrost, which extends to the seabed of the Kara Sea, a section of the Arctic Ocean between the Yamal Peninsula and Novaya Zemlya, is thawing. According to a CAGE researcher, Aleksei Portnov: Methane is leaking in an area of at least 7500 m2. In some areas gas flares extend up to . Prior to their research it was proposed that methane was tightly sealed into the permafrost by water depths up to . Close to the shore however, where the permafrost seal tapers to a depth of as little as , there are significant amounts of gas leakage.

Most likely built as a house in the 1770s during the Spanish colonial period, it is one of the oldest surviving structures in New Orleans. According to legend, the privateer Jean Lafitte, aka John Lafitte, owned a business here in the early 19th century. As with many things involving the Lafittes, including the possibility that they used the structure to plot illegal seizures and the sale of contraband, no documentation exists. (It was only after the Lafitte brothers were long gone that Jean's signature was found on a document, finally ascertaining how their family name was spelled: LAFFITE.) It is purported to be one of the more haunted venues in the French Quarter. The name Blacksmith Shop may not be coincidental. Lafitte's associates may have operated a smithy here during the days of reliance upon horses, who had to be shod. Jean's older brother Pierre Lafitte was a blacksmith, and their associate Renato Beluche may have once owned this building. Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop Bar Official website, citing 1722–32 construction and possible ownership by Renato Beluche; accessed 21 March 2015. The current business traces its roots to Roger 'Tom' Caplinger, who in the mid-1940s turned the old abandoned shop into Café Lafitte. The cafe became a popular night spot that attracted a bohemian clientele, including the gay community and celebrities like Noël Coward and Tennessee Williams. However, Caplinger never held clear title to the property and the building was sold in 1953.John Kelly, 1950's: Tom Caplinger at Cafe Lafitte in French Quarter, The Times-Picayune, March 27, 2011, accessed March 10, 2015. He soon opened a second cafe at the other end of the same block named Café Lafitte in Exile, which maintains that it is the oldest gay bar in the U.S. The building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970. and It is a rare extant example of briquette-entre-poteaux construction. In fiction Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop is featured in the historical novel Anthony Adverse by Hervey Allen. As depicted in the novel, the \\"blacksmith shop\\" was mainly a cover for maintaining a gang of exceptionally tall and strong black slaves - who were ostensibly engaged in shoeing horses while being used by the Lafitte brothers for intimidation, extortion and other criminal activities in and around New Orleans.

Early life Louis Michel-Aury was born in Paris, France, around 1788. French Navy Louis Aury served in the French Navy from 1802 or 1803 until 1811 as a sailor on a ship stationed in the French colonies of the West Indies. From 1802 he crewed on privateer ships, and by 1810 he had accumulated enough prize money to become the master of his own vessel. He participated in various privateering and filibuster efforts to overturn governments in East Florida, Mexico, Spanish Texas, the Caribbean Sea, Central America, and South America. Flag of Louis Aury, circa 1816 Evacuation of Cartagena de Indias Aury decided to support the Spanish colonies of South America in their fight for independence from Spanish rule. In April 1813 he sailed from North Carolina on his own privateer ship with Venezuelan Letters of Marque to attack Spanish ships. He was then commissioned as a commodore in the navy of New Granada (now Colombia), at considerable personal expense, in December 1815 ran the Spanish blockadeSouthwestern 1938, p. 112–113 and evacuated hundreds of people in his vessels from the besieged fortress city of Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) to Haiti. In spite of his success in this dangerous exploit he argued with Simón Bolívar, leader of the Latin American revolutionaries, over payment for his services in organizing the unsuccessful naval expedition to Los Cayos. Governor of Galveston Aury subsequently accepted an appointment as resident commissioner of Galveston Island, Texas, made by José Manuel de Herrera, an envoy from the fledgling Republic of Mexico, who had declared Galveston a port of the Republic. Aury established a privateering base there in September 1816. One of Aury's privateers had captured a Spanish vessel from Tampico, and letters found on board revealed that the port of Soto La Marina on the Soto La Marina River (also called the Santander) in Mexico was undefended. Learning this, Gen. Francisco Mina and Col. Henry Perry resolved to make a descent upon the place, and Aury agreed to transport them. They sailed from Galveston April 6, 1817,The date for the expedition's departure is variously given as April 6, 7, or 16 and the town was taken without a fight. The three commanders squabbled, and Aury left with his ships for Galveston. Mina, whose plan was to join the southern Mexican revolutionaries led by Guadalupe Victoria, marched inland and was captured by royal Spanish troops and executed by firing squad on a hill close to the Fuerte de los Remedios. Amelia Island affair Mexican insurgents' flag of 1815 flown by privateer Louis Aury However, while Aury was away, the pirate Jean Lafitte had taken control of the base at Galveston.Davis 2006, p. 324 On his return to Texas, Aury made an ill-fated attempt to establish another base at Matagorda Bay. He finally left Texas in 1817 to assist the Scottish adventurer Gregor MacGregor, who claimed to be commissioned by representatives of the revolting South American countries, in attacking Spanish Florida from Amelia Island. MacGregor left the island on September 4, and Aury sailed into the port of Fernandina on September 17, 1817. Following negotiations with MacGregor's lieutenants, Ruggles Hubbard and Jared Irwin, Amelia Island was dubiously annexed to the Republic of Mexico on September 21, 1817, and its flag raised over Fort San Carlos. Aury surrendered the island to American forces under the command of Commodore J.D. Henley and Major James Bankhead on December 23, 1817. Aury remained over two months as an unwelcome guest; Bankhead occupied Fernandina and President James Monroe vowed to hold it \\"in trust for Spain\\". This episode in Florida's history became known as the Amelia Island Affair.Foreign and Commonwealth Office 1837, p. 773 Settlement in Old Providence and Saint Catherine islands On 4 July 1818 Aury captured Old Providence Island (Isla de Providencia) in the western Caribbean with the help of 400 men and 14 ships. He found the island populated by white English-speaking Protestants and their slaves. Aury, Agostino Codazzi, and his team used the islands as his new base from which to pursue Central American independence and founded a settlement with a thriving economy based on captured Spanish cargo, while unsuccessfully trying to rebuild good relations with Bolívar. Under orders of Aury, Agostino Codazzi established the Fort Libertad on Saint Catherine Island. Project to conquer Panama for France With the merchants of Kingston, Benoît Chassériau and Jean-Baptiste Pavageau and the privateer shipowner Jean-Baptiste de Novion, Aury had imagined in 1820 conquering Panama, then the possession of Spain. This project aimed to give France the means to strengthen and secure its trade in this region of the world. Unofficially, the Minister of the Navy and the Colonies, Pierre-Barthélémy Portal, declined their bold offer.[Une autre 'affaire de Panama' ou le projet de conquête de quatre Français en 1820 (Louis-Michel Aury, Benoît Chassériau, Jean Pavageau and Jean-Baptiste de Novion), par Jean-Baptiste Nouvion, Revue d'histoire diplomatique, Paris, Éditions A. Pedone, no 2, 2019 pp. 159–174 Attempts to liberate Central America In 1820 Guatemala City was still the capital of the Captaincy General of Guatemala, so Central America was seen as yet under the sway of Spain, and thus was open to attack from its enemies. In an attempt to secure their independence, the Gran Colombian insurgents and the Aury flotilla fitted a combined sea and land expedition to operate against the ports of Omoa and Trujillo, in Honduras. On 21 April 1820, the watch-tower at Capiro in Trujillo Port announced the approach of a Colombian flotilla. The port's garrison, commanded by Jose M. Palomar, at once made emergency preparations for the impending attack. At two o'clock in the afternoon the approaching flotilla hoisted a flag with two blue bars and a white one between them showing an escutcheon in the center similar to the Argentinian flag; Aury dispatched a boat to shore to demand the port's surrender within one hour. The town did not comply. The following day Commodore Aury moved the flotilla to the mouth of the Guaimoreto River and began bombardment. The attack started at 9 AM and lasted until 2 PM. The firing ceased when the flotilla was ordered out to sea and out of the reach of the port's cannons. A portion of the land force then attempted to enter the town by the rear, but was detected and driven out. During the night of the 24th, the Aury vessels dropped out of sight. On the 25th the flotilla appeared off the port of Omoa and for several days attempted to land. Commodore Aury failed and left the area on the 6th of May. Some historians, for example Miguel Ángel de Marco, suggest that the flags of the United Provinces of Central America and most of the states that composed it were inspired by the Argentine Flag that privateer Hippolyte Bouchard took with him. Others claim that the flag was modeled on the Argentine flag, but introduced by Commodore Louis-Michel Aury.

Although he is not officially recognized by any of the countries he served, Aury was perceived as a member of the Great Colombia liberation fighters because of his affiliation with Simon Bolivar.

Owned and edited by Marinko Božić, it was the first Croatian tabloid. History Slobodni tjednik (\\"Independent Weekly\\" in Croatian) appeared in February 1990, on the eve of first free elections in Croatia. While being one of many media outlets started in the final stages of Communism, Slobodni tjednik was the first to use sensationalist headlines and similar content, which wasn't available in mainstream media of the earlier times. As such, Slobodni tjednik quickly became one of the most popular, most influential but also one of the most controversial newspapers in Croatia. Controversy was its editorial policy. While its first issue was very critical of Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and Croatian nationalism, in a matter of few weeks, Slobodni tjednik suddenly shifted towards the right, embracing Franjo Tuđman and his policies. In 1992, with Croatia being internationally recognized and Sarajevo armistice bringing hostilities to temporary end, Croatian public gradually began to lose taste for extreme nationalism promoted by Slobodni tjednik. New media outlets, like Globus magazine, proved to be better adapted for new circumstances, while economic woes of its readership also affected circulation of Slobodni tjednik. That, financial mishandling, deteriorating health and death of its founder Marinko Božić on 16 December 1993 led to Slobodni tjednik being extinguished in 1993.

He began his career as a Buddhist monk, but eventually came to follow the teachings of Neo-Confucian Zhu Xi. He combined Neo-Confucian ideas with Shinto to create Suika Shinto. Life =Early Years/Buddhism= Born in Kyoto on January 24, 1619, Yamazaki Ansai was the son of a former rōnin-turned-doctor and the last of four children. In his youth, he was strongly influenced by both his mother and grandmother. While his mother \\"urged him to develop a noble heart worthy of a samurai's son,\\"Tucker, Mary Evelyn. Religious Dimensions of Confucianism: Cosmology and Cultivation. Philosophy East and West, Vol. 48, No. 1, The Religious Dimensions of Confucianism in Japan. (Jan., 1998), pp. 23. his grandmother supported him in his study of the Chinese language. In his preteens, he was sent by his father to serve as an acolyte at a Buddhist temple on Mount Hiei.Ooms, Herman. Tokugawa Ideology. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1985, p.199. In his early teens, Ansai returned home, and after several years was finally permitted to enter the Myōshin-ji temple of the Rinzai Zen sect in Kyoto for further study. Due to his incredible scholarly aptitude, in his early twenties he was granted entrance to the Gyūkō-ji temple in Tosa. During his time at Tosa, he was strongly advised by his fellow monks to concentrate his studies on the teachings of Neo-Confucian scholars, thereby beginning the process of Ansai's conversion to Neo- Confucianism and ultimate rejection of Buddhism. Ansai was particularly captivated by the writings of the Song dynasty scholar, Zhu Xi (Chu Hsi), which later became the basis of Ansai's moral philosophy/teachings. At twenty eight, he returned to Kyoto, and under the patronage of Nonaka Kenzan, was able to continue his Neo Confucian studies, as well as begin to publish his own materials. With the production of his first work Heresies Refuted (Heikii, 1647), an outright rejection of Buddhist faith, Ansai fully embraced \\"the One True Way\\" of Neo Confucianism.Ooms, p.200 =Middle Years: Neo-Confucianism and Kimon= After his first publication, Ansai spent the remaining thirty- five years of his life writing, publishing, editing, annotating, and punctuating Confucian and Shinto texts (that accumulated to over two thousand pages).Ooms, p.201 The decade following Tosa (1647–1657), Ansai lived, studied, and taught in Kyoto. There, he edited and published a great number of texts (mostly commentaries on the works of Chu Hsi). Ansai also frequently went to Edo, to give lectures on Cheng-Zhu school of Neo-Confucianism in front of a large number of daimyōs.Tsuji, Tatsuya. The Cambridge History of Modern Japan, Volume 4, Early Modern Japan. Trans. by Harold Bolitho. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991, p.419 In 1655, he established a private school in Kyoto, began his first lecture cycle in the spring of the same year, and finished it at the end of 1656. Ansai's group of Confucian disciples was collectively referred to as the Kimon school. His lectures focused on Ansai's own, hand selected canon. His canon consisted mostly of the classic Confucian writings that Zhu Xi had emphasized: the Elementary Learning, the Reflections on Things at Hand, and the Four Books (the Great Learning, the Doctrine of the Mean, the Analects of Confucius, and the Mencius). However, he also included Cheng Yi's Commentary on the Book of Changes. In the 1660s and 1670s, Ansai (following the example of Zhu Xi) personally edited the six books that comprised his canon.Ooms, p.212 As a teacher, Ansai was described by his students as \\"extremely strict, sometimes scary, and short tempered.\\" Generally speaking, Ansai had a reputation for being \\"single minded, doctrinate, and intolerant.\\" Kaibara Ekken, a contemporary of Ansai's, had attended several of his lectures, and found Ansai to be: \\"severe, dogmatic, and more interested in strict moral discipline than in investigation of the principles for practical learning.\\"Tucker, Mary Evelyn. Moral and Spiritual Cultivation in Japanese Neo-Confucianism. State University of New York Press, 1989, p.36 Such prominent Neo-Confucian scholars as Kinoshita Jun'an, Asami Keisai, Miyake Shōsai, and Satō Naokata were included amongst Ansai's followers of the Kimon school. =Bakufu Involvement and Shinto Beginnings= In 1658, Ansai moved to Edo, where he spent the next 7 years of his life, continuing his studying of Neo-Confucian texts, as well as beginning his research on a never completed historiography of Japan (based upon Shinto texts). In 1665, after building up a reputation in both Edo and Kyoto as an extraordinary teacher, was invited by Hoshina Masayuki (the daimyō of Aizu) to become his teacher. Ansai accepted the position and spent the next seven years of his life as the personal teacher of Neo-Confucian philosophy to Masayuki. For tutoring Masayuki for six out of the twelve months of the year, Ansai was given a salary of 100 gold ryō, two seasonal garments, and one haori coat. Although Ansai and Masayuki were said to share a close relationship, Ansai refused to become his vassal, declaring that Confucian scholars should remain autonomous of another individual's influence. Masayuki proved to be Ansai's intellectual equal, helping him compile five different works: two gazetteers for the Aizu domain, and three Confucian texts: Gyokusan kōgi furoku (Appendix to Zhu Xi's lecture at Yushan), Nitei jikyōroku (Record of the two Cheng's political teachings), and the Irakusanshiden shinroku (Record of the mind-heart). During his years of service to Masayuki, Ansai compiled more writings of Zhu Xi during his off time in Kyoto. These included: Jinsetsumondō (Questions and answers on explanations of \\"humaneness\\"), Shōgaku mōyōshu and Daigaku keihatsu shū (Collections of [clarifications by Zhu Xi] on the Elementary Learning and the Great Learning).Ooms, p.225-226 Due to this relationship, Ansai is considered to be one of the scholars most closely associated with the Tokugawa Bakufu. Also, Ansai was able to receive the secret teachings of the Yoshida and Ise Shinto traditions, which he would use in attempting to reconstruct a \\"pure Shinto\\", that would reflect the Way of Neo-Confucianism. =Later Years: Schism in the Kimon school= After Masayuki's death in 1672, Ansai returned to Kyoto, where he spent the last decade of his life. In his later years, Ansai's scholarly focus dramatically shifted toward his project of synchronizing Shinto and Confucian thought. Ansai's introduction of Shinto into his teachings ultimately caused a schism among his students, dividing them into two groups: those who followed Ansai's Confucianism, and those who followed his Shinto. Very few were able to do both. In 1680, when Ansai put forth a radical re-interpretation of the Great Learning that defied traditional Confucian thought, he had a falling out with two of his best students, Satō Naokata and Asami Keisai, who could not accept Ansai's new interpretation. Ultimately, Ansai expelled Naokata and Keisai. After this, most of his students coalesced around the two defrocked pupils, thinning out the ranks of Ansai's still loyal followers.Tsuji, p.420 With his formerly great school in ruins, Ansai died on September 16, 1682, and was buried at the Korotani mountain in Kyoto. Split with Buddhism Ansai's rejection of Buddhism was based upon what he perceived as a fundamental insufficiency/flaw in Buddhist moral principles. In Neo Confucianism, Ansai had found the \\"Truth\\": the universal and eternal cosmic Way that could not be found in Buddhism. His critique was based upon two, interconnected fallacies that he perceived in Buddhist thought. First, Ansai believed that Buddhism lacked a normative system for informing ethical behavior (stemming from his interpretation that the Buddhist notion of nature (sei) as nothingness or emptiness, was a metaphysical, and not an ethical ideal). Due to this, Buddhism contained no theory of mind-heart, and thus, was inadequate for cultivating the mindTucker, Mary Evelyn. Religious Dimensions of Confucianism, p.23 (both of which were integral to Ansai's ethical thought). From Ansai's Neo-Confucian perspective, the mind was full (being inherently imbued with the concepts of the Five Relationships and the Five Virtues), not empty (as he believed Buddhism perceived it).Ooms, 202-203 In the latter part of his life, when Ansai was attempting to prove the ontological unity of Shinto and Confucianism, he proclaimed that before the arrival of Buddhism to Japan, early Shinto and Confucianism were identical. He blamed the influence of Buddhist thought for creating a false dichotomy between the two systems (which in Ansai's view differed only in name).Ooms, p.221 Neo-Confucian Teachings =Influence of Zhu Xi= Ansai's teachings were seen to be part of a larger Neo-Confucian trend of the early Tokugawa period, referred to by Abe Yoshino as the rigaku (school of principle). Compared to the kigaku (school of material force), rigaku's primary focus was on moral cultivation and spirituality. Its followers considered ri (Chinese li: reason, rational principle, or law) to be a transcendent principle.Tucker, Mary Evelyn. Moral and Spiritual Cultivation in Japanese Neo-Confucianism, pp.69-69 Although Ansai was part of this larger movement, in no way did he see himself as an \\"innovator\\" of Neo-Confucianism. Rather, he saw himself as a \\"servant of Truth,\\" a \\"transmitter of the Way,\\" and believed nothing of what he taught to be novel, since everything about the Way had already been said by the Confucian Sages. In particular, Ansai believed he was a \\"faithful transmitter\\" of the writings of both Zhu Xi, and the Korean Neo-Confucian Yi T'oegye (1507–1570), with special emphasis on Zhu's teachings.Kassel, Marleen. Tokugawa Confucian Education. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1996, p.68 Because of this, most of Ansai's Neo Confucian writings tended to be publications of Zhu Xi's works, with his own commentaries. Although some of Ansai's teachings varied slightly from Zhu Xi's, the foundation of Ansai's thought was deeply grounded in Zhu's most fundamental premises. The foremost of these was Zhu Xi's cosmological belief that the principles of reason and morality (li), were the same as mankind's original nature (i.e. that the principles that guide and move the universe, are exactly the same as those that inform man's ethical behavior).Ooms, p.203 Therefore, by pursuing li, an individual was simultaneously \\"developing the potential of one's inner nature to guide on in behaving correctly.\\" If an individual could endure it, he would be able to bring his own natural inclinations into perfect harmony with principles of universal morality. Zhu Xi saw this fulfillment of potential as the ideal state of human existence, and only possible to achieve if one were to obey one's allotted moral duty, given their relative position in society. Depending on their social role, the duties of the individual differed, as did the principles upon which they were grounded. However, Zhu Xi did not view this as problematic, since each of these principles was merely a different manifestation of the same general principle of morality, found in every human being. Xi believed that fulfilling one's proper social role was a means of understanding the universal principle of human morality (li). He referred to such a process as the \\"plumbing of principle\\". To perfect one's natural, innate potential was at the same time to realize one's self as an autonomous being.Tsuji, pp.416-419 =Reverence= Like Zhu Xi, Ansai firmly believed that an individual's moral duties reflected his specific social position (meibun). However, instead of focusing on the \\"plumbing of principle\\" (which he believed the average person was incapable of achieving) Ansai believed in order to properly achieve meibun, what was primary was an attitude of reverence (kei or tsutsushimi): steadiness of the mind and guarded behavior. Since Zhu considered reverence to be the necessary precondition for the \\"plumbing of principle\\", Ansai believed that reverence was the essential element of Zhu's moral thought.Tsuji, p.419 To this end, he placed great emphasis on a particular passage of Zhu Xi's: \\"Reverence within, righteousness without.\\" Reverence was the means by which one achieved the desired end of self-cultivation, necessary to fulfill the moral duties prescribed to an individual by their rigid, social obligations.Kassel, Marleen, p.69 Realizing one's social obligations and maintaining an orderly, hierarchical society were the highest duties that an individual and mankind (respectively) had to fulfill. This notion stems from Ansai's morality, cosmology, and the interconnectedness between the two (all based in Zhu Xi's thought). =Ontology and Morality= Like Zhu Xi, Ansai believed that the principles that guided the cosmic order were the same as the ethical principles that informed mankind's original nature (i.e. the same set of principles guided the cosmic, as well as the human world). Not only was there an inherent connection between the macrocosm (cosmos) and microcosm (humans), but they mutually influenced each other in a reciprocal and parallel manner. Just as the cosmic principles actively affect mankind (by informing humans of their natural, moral imperatives), so do human beings actively affect the cosmic order through their collective behavior. This is why Ansai believed it was a moral imperative for human beings to achieve unity with the cosmos. By understanding the ethical principles, they could simultaneously understand cosmic principles and positively affect not only themselves, but the universe as well. He linked morality with the Five Evolutive phases, to show that not only are cosmic and moral principles natural and inevitable, but that they mutually influence one another.Tucker, Mary Evelyn. Religious Dimensions of Confucianism, p.26 Physicist and philosopher Max Bernhard Weinstein found these views to be especially consonant with the theological theory of Pandeism.Max Bernhard Weinsten, Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis (\\"World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature\\") (1910), page 235: \\"Von den Japanern soll einer ihrer bedeutendsten Philosophen, Yamazaki-Ansai, um die mitte des siebzehnten Jahrhunderts, entwickelt haben: “Gott ist das Wesen aller Dinge und durchdringt den Himmel und die Erde.” Das klingt pandeistisch, kann jedoch auch metaphorisch gemeint sein, wie wir ja ähnliche Aussprüche von Gott tun. =Cosmology and Filial Piety= Because cosmologically everything was interconnected, Ansai believed that the actions of an individual (in a similar manner to modern chaos theory) affect the entire universe. He stressed the Confucian concept of Great Learning, in which a person's actions (the center of a series of concentric circles) extend outward toward the family, society, and finally to the cosmos. The Five Virtues (all contained in the idea of reverence and inherent in man's original nature) direct the Five Relationships, between: parent and child (humaneness), lord and vassal (righteousness/duty), husband and wife (propriety), elder and younger (wisdom), and friend and friend (faithfulness). There are five steps which Zhu Xi advocated to perfect these relationships (and virtues): \\"study wisely, question thoroughly, deliberate carefully, analyze clearly, and act conscientiously.\\" For Ansai, learning was the means to the ends of morality. However, of all of the relationships (and virtues) that Ansai emphasized, the relationship between the lord and vassal (duty) was the most important. Departing from Zhu Xi (who saw humaneness as the most important virtue), Ansai believed that maintaining the social order (through duty to one's lord) was the highest responsibility that one had to fulfill.Tucker, Mary Evelyn. Religious Dimensions of Confucianism, p.27 =Knowledge leads to Morality= To achieve reverence (the means toward personal cultivation) Ansai proposed quiet sitting. Through quiet sitting, Ansai believed that an individual could gain access to the storehouse of hidden knowledge (inherent in all individuals). This storehouse is where qi (the vital material force) resides. By channeling qi, one is able to stimulate humaneness, which consequently triggers the other virtues. Through knowledge, virtue grows. Through virtue, one can act in proper accord with the outside world (and the cosmos in general). Thus, knowledge is the source by which an individual realizes his innate, human potential (as described by Zhu Xi).Tucker, Mary Evelyn. Religious Dimensions of Confucianism, p.28 Suika Shinto =Interest in Shinto= In a failed attempt at creating a historiography of Japan, Ansai became intensely interested in Shinto's religious elements. From his own experience, Ansai believed that certain Shinto customs and rituals (such as funeral practices) reflected Confucian values. His Yamato shōgaku (Japanese Elementary Learning), published in 1658, although more focused on general social customs, marks a turning point in Ansai's thought, with its inclusion of various Shinto elements.Ooms, pp.227-228 In the latter part of his life, Ansai began a project of combining Neo-Confucian morality (based on Zhu Xi) with the religious elements of Shinto.Kassel, Marleen, p.68 Since Ansai believed in the ontological unity of everything, he believed that in the Shinto tradition, he could discover the Way, rooted in Japanese society.Ooms, p.217 Ansai's Confucian interpretation of Shinto mythology came to be known as Suika Shinto. Suika means the act of praying to call the gods down, to receive worldly benefits. Drawing on the secret traditions of both Yoshida and Ise Shinto (as well as classic Shinto myths, such as found in the Kojiki, Nihongi, Shoku Nihongi, Fudoki, etc.), Ansai was able to \\"uncover\\" numerous Neo- Confucian values within Shinto texts.Ooms, pp.221-222 On November 23, 1672, he created the Record of the Fuji no mori Shrine (Fuji no mori yuzuemandokoro no ki), an essay that generally summarizes Ansai's views on Shinto and its connection to Neo-Confucian metaphysics.Ooms, p.228 =Confucian Ethics Embedded in Shinto= From the Shinto texts, he found particular moral values that he believed had counterparts in Confucianism. For example, he believed that the Confucian notion of reverence was the same as the Shinto idea of prayer (kitō). Righteousness (in Confucianism) was equivalent to the Shinto idea of honesty or forthrightness (massugu or shōjiki). In the opening chapters of the Nihongi, Ansai explained that the five generations of earthly gods (kami) were equivalent to the Five Evolutive Phases,Ooms, p.237 and that the pledge of Amaterasu to protect the divine lineage of her descendants, along with Yamato-hime's prophecy of \\"keeping right what is right and left what is left,\\" are expressions of the values of the Way (loyalty, selflessness, steadfast and vigilant mind).Ooms, p.223 Although Ansai claimed he was trying to discover Confucian values within Shinto, his discoveries had a profound effect on his personal philosophy. From his interpretation of a passage from the Nihongi, where Ō-ana-muchi converses with his own spirit, Ansai believed that every person's body is a shrine, that houses a living spirit. In effect, every person's physical heart contained a living god, and out of reverence to the gods, one should worship the self. He believed this to be analogous to the Confucian practice of self-cultivation.Ooms, 231-232 =Shinto's Influence of Ansai's Thought= Ansai's interpretations of Shinto texts also (surprisingly) led to his affirmation of the political order of the Tokugawa Bakufu. He believed that just as much as the emperor, the bakufu was part of the sacred political order (and that these warriors were exemplified in the archetype of Susanoo). By divine mandate, the bakufu had been entrusted to protect the political realm, in the name of the emperor. This political order, for Ansai, reflected the greater cosmic unity of heaven and man.Ooms, pp.237-238 Due to his belief in this unity, Ansai challenged the traditional Confucian notion of the Mandate of Heaven, where a ruler was held accountable for the welfare of his subjects, and could lose his legitimacy if he did not act in proper accord. However, Ansai believed that challenging political authority was paramount to disrupting the harmonic balance between heaven and man. Therefore, a subject must pledge his undying, unconditional loyalty to his master. This idea caused a great controversy amongst Ansai's followers in the Kimon school, as well as amongst his Suika Shinto disciples.Ooms, pp.247-248 Methodology In his book Tokugawa Ideology, Herman Ooms describes Ansai's analysis of Shinto texts as being grounded in \\"hermeneutic operations\\", proceeding along four levels of interpretation. The first level is literal. From Ooms' perspective, Ansai believed the Shinto texts he read to be records of historical facts. The kami existed and Ansai believed in them. Second, Ansai employs an allegorical interpretation of the text, by analogically equating symbols he found within Shinto texts as expressions of Confucian truths. Third, Ansai interpreted the texts on a moral level, drawing ethical paradigms out of Shinto myths. The last level was anagogical, whereby Ansai argued for the supremacy of the Japanese nation (relative to all others), using his own interpretations of Shinto texts. Although often Ansai is criticized for his 'torturous rationalizations\\" found in Suika Shinto, Ooms argues that what distinguishes Ansai from other Neo-Confucian scholars of his time was the \\"systematic structure of his thought.\\"Ooms, pp.282-283 Influence/Legacy Yamazaki Ansai was part of a larger movement in the early Tokugawa era that revived and helped proliferate Neo-Confucian thought in Japan.Kassel, Marleen, p.77 He was the first to introduce the writings of the Korean Neo-Confucian scholar Yi T'ogeye to Japan, and was instrumental in popularizing Zhu Xi's thought (partly due to his connections with the government).Tucker, Mary Evelyn. Religious Dimensions of Confucianism, p.21 His political theory was appropriated by the Tokugawa Bakufu, as a means to legitimate the suppression of political contestation. The institutions that Ansai had created (the Kimon school and Suika Shinto) did not last for very long (in their original forms, as Ansai had intended). However, the power of Ansai's ideas and the influence he exerted on a large number of his students have had vast repercussions. Ansai's Suika Shinto transformed Shinto into a political ideology that was later incorporated by ultra-nationalist thinkers in the 18th and 19th centuries. In his scholarly research of Shinto texts, Ansai was able to break the monopoly on Shinto doctrine, by freeing it from the private storehouses of specialist Shinto circles (Yoshida, Ise), and thereby making it available for future generations to freely study and interpret.Ooms, 285-286 Although the Kimon school suffered from various schisms (both during and after Ansai's time), its lineage has lasted until present times. After Ansai's death, his students continued to preach some form of his Confucian or Suika Shinto thought, to both commoners and Bakufu officials alike. A large number of Kimon scholars later filled the ranks of the Bakufu College during the Kansei Reforms.

It has mn vertices, consisting of all possible length-n sequences of the given symbols; the same symbol may appear multiple times in a sequence. If we have the set of m symbols S:=\\\\\\\\{s_1,\\\\dots,s_m\\\\\\\\} then the set of vertices is: : V=S^n=\\\\\\\\{(s_1,\\\\dots,s_1,s_1),(s_1,\\\\dots,s_1,s_2),\\\\dots,(s_1,\\\\dots,s_1,s_m),(s_1,\\\\dots,s_2,s_1),\\\\dots,(s_m,\\\\dots,s_m,s_m)\\\\\\\\}. If one of the vertices can be expressed as another vertex by shifting all its symbols by one place to the left and adding a new symbol at the end of this vertex, then the latter has a directed edge to the former vertex. Thus the set of arcs (that is, directed edges) is : E=\\\\\\\\{((t_1,t_2,\\\\dots,t_n),(t_2,\\\\dots,t_n,s_j)) : t_i \\\\in S, 1\\\\le i\\\\le n, 1\\\\le j\\\\le m \\\\\\\\}. Although De Bruijn graphs are named after Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn, they were discovered independently by both De Bruijn and I. J. Good. Much earlier, Camille Flye Sainte-Marie implicitly used their properties.  Properties  * If n=1 then the condition for any two vertices forming an edge holds vacuously, and hence all the vertices are connected forming a total of m^2 edges. * Each vertex has exactly m incoming and m outgoing edges. * Each n-dimensional De Bruijn graph is the line digraph of the (n - 1)-dimensional De Bruijn graph with the same set of symbols. * Each De Bruijn graph is Eulerian and Hamiltonian. The Euler cycles and Hamiltonian cycles of these graphs (equivalent to each other via the line graph construction) are De Bruijn sequences. The line graph construction of the three smallest binary De Bruijn graphs is depicted below. As can be seen in the illustration, each vertex of the n-dimensional De Bruijn graph corresponds to an edge of the (n - 1)-dimensional De Bruijn graph, and each edge in the n-dimensional De Bruijn graph corresponds to a two-edge path in the (n - 1)-dimensional De Bruijn graph. 600px  Dynamical systems  Binary De Bruijn graphs can be drawn (below, left) in such a way that they resemble objects from the theory of dynamical systems, such as the Lorenz attractor (below, right): :::360px 200px This analogy can be made rigorous: the n-dimensional m-symbol De Bruijn graph is a model of the Bernoulli map :x\\\\mapsto mx\\\\ \\\\bmod\\\\ 1 The Bernoulli map (also called the 2x mod 1 map for m = 2) is an ergodic dynamical system, which can be understood to be a single shift of a m-adic number. The trajectories of this dynamical system correspond to walks in the De Bruijn graph, where the correspondence is given by mapping each real x in the interval [0,1) to the vertex corresponding to the first n digits in the base-m representation of x. Equivalently, walks in the De Bruijn graph correspond to trajectories in a one-sided subshift of finite type. Directed graphs of two B (2, 3) de Bruijn sequences and a B (2, 4) sequence. In B(2,3). each vertex is visited once, whereas in B(2,4), each edge is traversed once. Embeddings resembling this one can be used to show that the binary De Bruijn graphs have queue number 2 and that they have book thickness at most 5.

It is a confluence of tail-water discharges of the Powai and Vihar lakes. The river is seasonal and rises during the monsoons. The overflowing lakes also contribute to the river flow, which is stopped by a dam at other times. During this season, the gutter is a favourite with anglers, who can catch large fish that have escaped from the lakes. Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport is located right next to the section of RIVER at Andheri. Geography Mithi river in Mumbai showing the concrete pillars used in increasing its width The river originates from the overflow of Vihar Lake and also receives the overflows from the Powai Lake about 2 km later. It flows for a total of 18 km before it meets the Arabian Sea at Mahim Creek flowing through residential and industrial complexes of Powai, Saki Naka, Kurla, Kalina, Vakola, Bandra-Kurla complex, Dharavi and Mahim. The river has an average width of 5 metres in the upper reaches, has been widened to 25 m in the middle reaches and up to 70 m in the lower reaches after 26 July 2005 deluge (944 mm in 24 h on 26 July 2005). Ecology It is also less well known that the Mahim bay area, where Mithi River meets Arabian Sea is a nominated bird sanctuary where migratory birds come for nesting. This part is full of mangroves. When the river was not as polluted as it is today, it used to serve as an important storm water drain for Mumbai but as it has been used as a sewer over the years, its importance as a storm water drain has reduced and on the contrary, it poses as a hazard during high tide bringing polluted water into the city and flooding the city. Environmental degradation The river has been polluted by dumping of raw sewage, industrial waste and municipal waste into the river. Besides this, illegal activities like washing vessels, animals and oily drums, discharge of unauthorised hazardous waste are also carried out along the course of this river. Cattle sheds in some areas contribute animal waste. Barrel cleaners, scrap dealers and others dump sludge oil, effluent and garbage in the river. The organic waste, sludge and garbage dumping has reduced the carrying capacity of the river. The water with mixture of sewage and industrial waste is a threat to marine life. The river bed is full of sludge, garbage and vegetation growth like water hyacinth in many parts. The city of Mumbai earned the epithet – 'Cottonopolis of India' due to its vibrant cotton textile mills. The mills over the years have utilized water from this river and dumped their waste into it leading to the present polluted state of the river. Cleanup The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai has undertaken a cleanliness drive lately so that the floods of 26 July 2005 are not repeated. An environmental group has been formed by Rajendra Singh, an award-winning conservationist in 2009. The BMC has been able to remove just 267,000 cubic metres so far, or 60% of what is required. It aims to revive the dying river. Recently environmentalist Afroz Shah has launched campaigns with the loc citizens of Mumbai to clean the Mithi river, to much success.  Development  Many young entrepreneurs in and around Mumbai are now aggressively involved with raising awareness of the degradation of the Mithi River, and creating awareness on a global scale as the government of India has again began to ignore this extremely important issue. In 2009, environmentalist and Magsaysay Award winner, Rajendra Singh lead a yatra, of a group of environmentalist and NGOs, through Mumbai city along the degraded Mithi river to highlight its problems.

He was taught by Mstislav Rostropovich at the Moscow Conservatory from 1966 to 1970. In 1966 he won sixth prize at the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow. In 1970, he was arrested and spent 18 months in a work camp. He emigrated to Israel in 1972, where he holds citizenship. He studied with Gregor Piatigorsky in Los Angeles. Maisky currently lives in Belgium. Maisky has worked with artists including the pianists Martha Argerich, Khatia Buniatishvili, Radu Lupu, Nelson Freire, Peter Serkin, Evgeny Kissin, Lang Lang and Sergio Tiempo, the violinists Gidon Kremer, Itzhak Perlman, Vadim Repin, Maxim Vengerov, Joshua Bell, Julian Rachlin and Janine Jansen, and the conductors Leonard Bernstein, Zubin Mehta, Carlo Maria Giulini, Lorin Maazel, Riccardo Muti, Giuseppe Sinopoli, Yuri Temirkanov, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Daniel Barenboim, James Levine, Charles Dutoit, Mariss Jansons, Valery Gergiev and Gustavo Dudamel. Maisky first performed in the United States at Carnegie Hall in 1973. In 1976, he made his first performance in London and performed a recital with Radu Lupu the following year. He returned to Russia in 1995 to perform and record with Russian National Orchestra and Mikhail Pletnev.

He is the first attested legal official in what is now Sweden about whom we have any extensive information. Biography He was a member of the Bjelbo dynasty or House of Folkung (Folkungaätten) which in the 1250s became Sweden's royal dynasty. He was the son of Magnus Minniskiöld, and the elder half-brother of Birger Jarl (Birger Magnusson), the most powerful man of Sweden in the middle of the 13th century. Around 1217, he married Kristina Nilsdotter, widow of the Norwegian earl Hakon the Mad (Håkon Galen), whose son Knut Håkonsson was a pretender to the Norwegian throne. Due to the location of his jurisdiction and his marriage to Kristina, Eskil had good contacts in Norway and may have functioned as a negotiator between the Swedish and the Norwegian monarchs. Some time during 1218–1220, he was visited by Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson. Eskil was noted for his learning and seems to have had an important role in codifying the law of Västergötland, (Västgötalagen) the oldest known Swedish text written in the Latin script.Inger Larsson, 'The Role of the Swedish Lawman in the Spread of Lay Literacy', in Along the Oral-Written Continuum: Types of Texts, Relations and the Implications, ed. by Slavica Ranković, Leidulf Melve, and Else Mundal, Utrecht Studies in Medieval Literacy, 20 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2010), pp. 411-27 (pp. 411-13). The list of lawspeakers of Västergötland appended to Västgötalagen tells that he collected and edited the province's laws, and administered justice with great consideration. He had good judgment, the learning of a cleric and he was superior to all the chieftains of the kingdom. The list also claims that he distinguished himself in bravery and that it would take a long time until another man of that kind was born.

Based on the 1939 novel of the same name by W. Somerset Maugham, the film is about a woman who marries a Southern aristocrat who inherited his family's streak of violence and instability and soon drags the woman into a life of misery. After he is arrested, the woman runs away from her husband's family, changes her name, and finds work as a singer in a New Orleans dive. The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Musical Score for Hans J. Salter. Plot On Christmas Eve in New Orleans, U.S. Army officer Charlie Mason meets beautiful Maison Lafitte hostess \\"Jackie\\" (whose real name is Abigail Manette). She tells him, in flashbacks, the story of the decline of her marriage with the charming but unbalanced Robert Manette. When her husband kills a bookie, his controlling mother tries to cover it up. When he is caught, she and her son blame Abigail. Abigail, feeling guilty when her husband receives a life sentence, becomes a bar hostess. Meanwhile, Robert escapes from jail and comes to see Abigail, but he is shot by police and dies in her arms, leaving her to start again with Charlie Mason.

The movie was part of a specific plan by producer Felix Jackson to broaden the sort of films Durbin was making - it would be followed by her first color film, Caroline, then a mystery, Lady on a Train, then a film with Charles Boyer. Durbin, usually the girl next door in Universal Pictures musicals, plays a naif who falls for him and sticks with him even knowing he's a killer.

Mankiewicz changed the setting from a Paris brothel to a nightclub in New Orleans and the main character was changed from a prostitute to a more ambiguous nightclub singer and hostess. Mankiewicz was fired while writing the screenplay by Universal executives who saw him drunk on the studio lot. A week later the writer walked into Jackson's office and said \\"Felix, don't you think Herman Mankiewicz drunk is still better than Dwight Taylor sober?\\" Jackson rehired him. Mankiewicz considered the screenplay among his 1940s successes of which he was most proud. Universal loaned Turhan Bey to MGM in exchange for Gene Kelly who played her husband.

Reception =Critical response= The film received mixed reviews.Durbin 'Art' Challenged Lusk, Norbert. Los Angeles Times4 July 1944: 10. In his review for The New York Times, Bosley Crowther called the story \\"the oldest sort of hat—the kind of dramatic farrago that was being played by faded stars ten years ago.\\" Crowther wrote that it was \\"really grotesque and outlandish what they've done to Miss Durbin in this film\\"—forced to play a role that is \\"a figment within a moody and hackneyed yarn.\\" Crowther criticized Mankiewicz' screenplay, which has \\"but the vaguest resemblance to the Somerset Maugham novel on which it is 'based'\\". Although not blaming Durbin for the film's shortcomings, Crowther is severe in his criticism of her performance: Crowther is no more charitable towards Gene Kelly, who \\"performs her no good husband in his breezy, attractive style, which is thoroughly confusing, considering the character that he is supposed to be.\\" Durbin later said in an interview with Films in Review that Christmas Holiday was her \\"only really good film\\". Christmas Holiday is considered one of the bleakest film noirs of the 1940s, and one of Siodmak's most personally realized films. =Box-office= By July 1944 the film had made more than $2 million at the US box office, making it the highest-grossing film of Durbin's career up to 1944. It was also Universal's most successful film of the year overtaking Arabian Nights which made $1.7 million. Universal said the average gross of a Durbin film was $1,250,000. \\"Oddly enough it did very well,\\" said Siodmak. \\"I suppose everyone was so interested to see what Deanna Durbin would be like in a dramatic role. However she never tried again.\\" See also *List of American films of 1944 References External links  * Christmas Holiday on Lux Radio Theater, September 17, 1945 * Spring Will Be A Little Late This Year sung by Deanna Durbin * Always sung by Deanna Durbin Category:1944 films Category:1944 crime drama films Category:American Christmas drama films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Film noir Category:Films based on works by W.

Here output is measured along the horizontal axis. In the Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis model, total costs are linear in volume. The total cost curve, if non-linear, can represent increasing and diminishing marginal returns. In economics, total cost (TC) is the total economic cost of production and is made up of variable cost, which varies according to the quantity of a good produced and includes inputs such as labour and raw materials, plus fixed cost, which is independent of the quantity of a good produced and includes inputs that cannot be varied in the short term: fixed costs such as buildings and machinery, including sunk costs if any. Total cost in economics, unlike in cost accounting, includes the total opportunity cost (implicit cost) of each factor of production as part of its fixed or variable costs. The rate at which total cost changes as the amount produced changes is called marginal cost. This is also known as the marginal unit variable cost. The total cost of producing a specific level of output is the cost of all the factors of input used. Often, economists use models with two inputs: physical capital, with quantity X and labor, with quantity L. Capital is assumed to be the fixed input, meaning that the amount of capital used does not vary with the level of production in the short run. The rental price per unit of capital is denoted r. Thus, the total fixed cost equals Kr. Labor is the variable input, meaning that the amount of labor used varies with the level of output. In fact, in the short run, the only way to vary output is by varying the amount of the variable input. Labor usage is denoted L and the per unit cost, or wage rate, is denoted w, so the variable cost is Lw. Consequently, total cost is fixed cost (FC) plus variable cost (VC), or TC = FC + VC = Kr+Lw. In the long run, however, both capital usage and labor usage are variable. Other economic models have the total variable cost curve (and therefore total cost curve) illustrate the concepts of increasing, and later diminishing, marginal return. In marketing, it is necessary to know how total costs divide between variable and fixed. \\"This distinction is crucial in forecasting the earnings generated by various changes in unit sales and thus the financial impact of proposed marketing campaigns.\\" In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 60% responded that they found the \\"variable and fixed costs\\" metric very useful.Farris, Paul W.; Neil T.

He had a role in a production of Taming of the Shrew at the Globe Theatre in New York City. He moved to Hollywood and became a contract player in films of the 1930s and 1940s before becoming a director in 1944. He played a famous painter who had resorted to drinking in the 1960 episode \\"The Illustrator\\" of The Rifleman, starring Chuck Connors and Johnny Crawford. He directed a number of television programs in the 1950s and 1960s, including early episodes of Gunsmoke and The Beverly Hillbillies (most if not all of the first two seasons), and the entire second season of My Three Sons. He directed the short-lived series Border Patrol, and the 1964–1965 ABC sitcom Mickey, starring Mickey Rooney. In the summer of 1960, he guest-starred in one episode and directed other segments of the short-lived western series Tate. Whorf directed the unsuccessful 1961 stage comedy Julia, Jake and Uncle Joe.

ARVs are crewed by authorised firearms officers to respond to incidents believed to involve firearms or other high-risk situations. ARVs are specially adapted and modified to accommodate specialist equipment.  Introduction of ARVs  A red ARV of the Met's Protection Command, with yellow dot stickers Armed response vehicles were introduced to British police forces to provide them with a firearms response capability, as police in the United Kingdom (except Northern Ireland) do not routinely carry firearms on patrol, with the exception of a minority of armed officers. Outside of London, ARVs are controlled and organised by the Force Firearms Unit, and within the capital they are controlled by the Specialist Firearms Command of the Metropolitan Police. ARVs are identifiable in London by a yellow dot sticker, visible from each angle, and an asterisk on the roof to enable helicopters to identify the vehicle as being an ARV. Vehicles of the Metropolitan Police's Protection Command, identifiable by their red paintwork, use the same yellow dot markings to denote the carrying of firearms officers. ARVs were deployed officially for the first time in London, during 1991. An \\"unpublicised\\" ARV was deployed in the Brixton area after the riots and was operational in the 1980s, code name Lima Delta 53. This had the standard Smith & Wesson revolvers and was on patrol at all times. Following their success, forces outside of the capital later formed similar units during the early to mid-1990s. The concept of an ARV was influenced by West Yorkshire Police's instant response cars, as used from 1976. Early ARVs contained a secure safe between the seats containing a .38 Smith & Wesson Model 10 for each member, with two 9mm Heckler & Koch MP5 semi-automatic carbines secured in the boot. After ARVs became established and the practice was accepted for widespread use, the Model 10 revolvers were replaced by the semi-automatic Glock 17 handgun chambered in 9×19mm. In 2010, the Heckler & Koch G36C 5.56mm carbine was introduced in case of a Mumbai style terrorist attack. Revolvers and pistols could be removed from the secure safe by ARV members if, in a member's opinion, an immediate threat to life was posed. Authorisation for this from the control room was required, including contacting an officer of Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) rank. If a high-ranking officer was not available, a Chief Inspector could give authorisation in an emergency. Following an increase in the size of the Firearms Unit, Commissioner Sir Paul Condon issued regulations, effective 23 May 1994, that gave ARV crews standing authority to wear their handguns overtly and to deploy their weapons. Several police forces followed suit. The Greater Manchester police became one of those whose ARVs openly carried firearms beginning 6 September 1994.

He is sometimes believed to have perished in the Battle of Lena in 1208, though the evidence is not conclusive.

Strinnholm, Svenska folkets historia, Vol. IV. Stockholm: Hörbergska Boktryckeriet, 1852, p. 286. He married the noblewoman Ingrid Ylva, of possible royal descent, and fathered several sons who would influence early Swedish history, most notably Birger Jarl. He is mentioned in two contemporary diplomas (DS 70, 116), as the brother of Birger Brosa,Svenskt Diplomatarium nr 70 och nr 116 as well as by King Magnus Birgersson, who in a letter in 1280 called him \\"grandfather\\". The cognomen of Magnus, Latinized as Mijneskiold,Svenskt Diplomatarium nr 1136 has been explained in various ways. It could derive from minni (memory), it may allude to his having a moon (måne) on his shield, or it could be interpreted as \\"smaller shield\\" (mindre sköld). Magnus Minnesköld was probably married twice; this has been inferred from the great differences in the ages of his children. Nothing is known about his supposed first wife. Magnus married his second wife around 1195. This was Ingrid Ylva who, according to the Swedish reformer and historian Olaus Petri, was a daughter of Sune Sik. The same information is found in a medieval genealogy copied in the 16th century.Nils Ahnlund, \\"Vreta klosters äldsta donatorer\\", Historisk tidskrift 65, 1945, p. 341.

Leiden: Brill, 2007, pp. 507, 513. Although, as the younger brother of Birger Brosa, Magnus was not the head of the powerful family, his central position in the ruling elite suggests that he was actively involved in the fight between Sverker II of Sweden of the House of Sverker, and Erik Knutsson of the House of Eric, for the Swedish crown, which was contested over three main battles. The first was the Battle of Älgarås, (now a place in the Swedish community Töreboda in Västergötland) in November 1205, where King Sverker II defeated Erik Knutsson. The second one was the battle Battle of Lena (now Kungslena in Västergötland) on 31 January 1208, in which Erik Knutsson, with a Swedish (and Norwegian?) army, won a devastating victory over King Sverker II and his Danish army, drove him from the throne and placed himself in the throne as Erik X, King of Sweden from 1208 to 1216. The last was the Battle of Gestilren (perhaps in Enköping in Uppland) on July 17, 1210, in which the displaced King Sverker II, with a Danish army, attempted to regain his throne, but was defeated and died in the battle. A medieval Liber Daticus (Book of Donations) from Lund states that an aristocrat called Magnus fell at the Battle of Lena (\\"II Kal. Februar. obiit Magnus, qui occisus est in Gocia apud Lene, Anno Dominice incarnationis MCCVIII\\").A.M. Strinnholm, Svenska folkets historia, Vol. IV. Stockholm: Hörbergska Boktryckeriet, 1852, p. 286. The equation of this Magnus with Magnus Minniskiöld is not certain, however. The remains of his son Birger Jarl have been examined, and they indicate that he was 50–55 years old when he died, and Magnus was therefore probably still alive some years after the Lena battle.Dick Harrison, \\"Jarlen som byggde riket\\", Populär Historia 2010, http://popularhistoria.se/artiklar/birger-jarl-jarlen-som- byggde-riket/ References Further reading *Harrison, Dick (2002) Jarlens sekel: en berättelse om 1200-talets Sverige.

Eiji Tsuburaya had originally intended for the Ultra Series to end with the 1967 series Ultra Seven (1967) but the former, alongside its originator Ultraman (1966) proved to be too popular a character to omit. Eiji Tsuburaya died in 1970. His son Hajime Tsuburaya (who took over Tsuburaya Productions until his own death in 1973) revived the Ultra Series with Return of Ultraman. The show features a new Ultraman named , or . In 1984, he was renamed due to licensing issues. Tsuburaya and Bandai (which had just bought the Ultraman toy license in Japan) held a contest for children to pick a new name for this Ultraman. Although he is called \\"Ultraman Jack\\" for licensing in and out of Japan, he is still sometimes referred to as \\"New Ultraman\\"/\\"Kaettekita Ultraman\\", by some fans (and also in some official sources). This change was done due to a last-minute decision as the original plan for this series was for the original Ultraman to return to Earth to continue fighting against aliens and monsters. While nearly identical to the original Ultraman in appearance, the red pattern on his silver suit is slightly different. Furthermore, the new Ultraman can be recognized by his shorter pants, the pinstripes along the red areas, and the fuller sleeves/kneepads. The characters and related events are described below using an in-universe tone. Due to the mid-season addition of 'Ultraman' being Ultraman Jack, the series reintroduced his predecessors, Ultraman and Ultra Seven to the series canon - both of his predecessors were originally in different canon \\"universes\\" beforehand. This began a shared universe which continued throughout the Showa series, with Zoffy, Ultraman's superior, being reintroduced to the canon the following year in Ultraman Ace. Story This series is a follow up to the original Ultraman & Ultra Seven that is set in 1971, four years after Ultraseven left Earth, and five years after Ultraman came to Earth. The first episode begins with a fight between two giant monsters named Takkong and Zazahn in Tokyo. Amid the monster destruction, young race-car driver Hideki Go is killed while trying to rescue a little boy and a dog from the falling rubble. His valiant sacrifice is noted by everyone, including his friends and the new defense force MAT (Monster Attack Team), but an unseen being also takes notice. Looking over Hideki is \\"New Ultraman\\" (\\"Ultraman Jack\\"), who is so touched by the race car driver's heroism, that he decides to combine his life force with that of Hideki, thus bringing him back to life (just like the original Ultraman did with Shin Hayata), much to everyone's astonishment. MAT then asks Hideki to join the team, which he does, especially since in this frightening new \\"Age of Monsters\\", Earth will need a savior. In times of crisis, Hideki will raise his right arm and, by force of will, transform into Ultraman to fight monsters. In addition, the original Ultraman and Ultra Seven are watching New Ultraman's battles from the sidelines, and offer their help when he is in peril. Production For the first time, Ishirō Honda, best known for his work on the Godzilla movies and other classic Toho tokusatsu, worked on the Ultra Series, and directed some of the episodes of this series, including the first episode (titled , which is the same as the Japanese title for the film Destroy All Monsters). When translated into English, this title also follows the Japanese title for Godzilla's Revenge, All Monsters Attack.

History Hand cranked, multi-barrelled Gatling gun In the late 19th century, Gatling guns and other externally powered types, such as the Nordenfelt, were often made in different ranges of calibers, such as half-inch and one-inch. Thanks to their many barrels, overheating was not a major issue, and they were also quite heavy, being, essentially, heavy machine guns. Less bulky, automatic, single-barrelled Maxim gun When Hiram Maxim developed his recoil-powered machine gun that used a single barrel, the first main design was a modest 26 pounds (11.8 kg) in weight, firing a .45-inch rifle caliber bullet (from a 24 inch long barrel). As depicted in a famous photo of Maxim, it could be picked up complete with its 15-pound (6.8 kg) tripod with one arm. It was similar to later-design medium machine guns, but it could not be fired for extended periods. As a result, he created a water-jacket cooling system to enable it to fire for extended periods. This added significant weight, as did changes to more powerful cartridges. This class of heavy, water-cooled machine gun would eventually be regarded as the classic heavy machine guns. However, the much lighter total weight possible by using recoil to power automatic loading was not lost on the firearms designers of the day, resulting in other automatic firearms that used this concept, such as the Borchardt pistol, the Cei-Rigotti rifle, the Madsen 1902, as well as lighter, gas-operated, air- cooled designs. =Early 20th century: medium, heavy and light= Water cooled M1917 demonstrated in 1918 Many new designs were developed, some powered by air or recoil, or a combination of the two (e.g., the Colt 1895 and M1895, Hotchkiss M1909, PM M1910, Fiat–Revelli Modello 1914, Fiat–Revelli Modello 1935, Breda M37, and Breda 38). Also, instead of the rather heavy water jacket, new designs introduced other types of cooling, such as barrel replacement, metal fins, and/or heat sinks or some combination of all of them. Machine guns then diverged into heavier and lighter designs. The later model water-cooled Maxim gun and its derivatives (the MG 08 and the Vickers gun, as well as the American Browning Model 1917 machine gun), were all substantial weapons. The .303 inch Vickers, for example, weighed 33 lb (15 kg) alone and on its tripod mount the total weight was 50 lb (22.7 kg). The heavier designs could, and in some cases did, literally fire for days on end. The need was to be able to cut down, potentially, thousands of charging soldiers. The heavy machine gun was mounted on a tripod and was often water-cooled; a well-trained and well-supplied crew could fire for hours on end. Carefully positioned heavy machine guns could stop an attacking force before they reached their objectives. The air-cooled Browning M1919 during WW2. The first machine guns in use before World War I covered a wide range of characteristics. In addition to these heavier designs, there were also a number of lighter types. During the same period, a number of new air-cooled designs were developed that, instead of weighing well over 30 lb (15 kg), were lighter and more mobile. In World War I, they were to be as important as the heavier designs, and were used to support squads and infantry on the move, on aircraft, and on many types of vehicle, including some tanks. The two that would become critical were new medium and light machine guns. The new medium machine guns offered less, or more difficult-to-use, cooling than the heavier designs, but more than the lightest. Light machine guns were introduced as lighter, more portable automatic weapons. They still fired the same full-power rifle caliber ammunition, but used lighter barrels without extra cooling and were fired from a bipod. Light machine guns were not intended to be fired for extended periods of time. The lightest of the new designs were not capable of sustained fire, as they did not have extra cooling features and were fed from a comparatively small magazine. Essentially a machine rifle with a bipod, weapons like the Chauchat or the Madsen 1902 were the most mobile, but were made for single and burst fire. These were used in assaults to great effect by infantry, but were less effective in vehicle-mounted and other applications. The medium designs offered greater flexibility, either using a bipod and being used like lighter designs, or being put on a tripod, or on heavier mounts. The Hotchkiss Mark I (e.g. Benét–Mercié M1909) was a 27.6 lb (12.2 kg) MG that normally used a mini tripod and linkable 30-round strips or in vehicles, but there was also a belt- fed version of it. Not be confused with heavier Hotchkiss models (such as the M1914), the design proved a useful intermediate and would serve even to the end of World War II in some jobs. The design would be followed by lighter machine rifles and better medium types. They also shared a common characteristic: they fired full power rifle caliber ammunition such as 8mm Mauser or .30-06 Springfield. Lewis gun training, 1917 The Lewis gun, which weighed 27 lb (12.3 kg), was commonly used with a 47-round drum and bipod; it was used on the move in support of squads, and on vehicles and aircraft as well, or on a tripod (either for anti-aircraft use, or to fill in for a heavier MG). What made it very useful was that it was significantly lighter than water-cooled weapons, but could fire nearly as much due to a very large cooling assembly. These sort of multi-purpose machine guns, would be further developed, and later given names like Universal Machine gun or general-purpose machine gun, and would eventually supplant the water-cooled designs. Later designs have mostly switched to fast barrel-replacement as an alternative to cooling, which further reduces the weapon's weight (but can increase the total weight carried by a soldier). Some earlier designs, like the Vickers, provided for the replacement of worn barrels. It was in the 1920s and 1930s that barrel replacement as a means of cooling became more popular (e.g., in the ZB 1930, and later the MG34 and the Bren gun). =Mid 20th century= Light variants of the M60 machine gun (foreground) and a M240B (back) in use with the US Navy, 2010. The heavier water-cooled designs continued to be used throughout World War II and into the 1960s, but were gradually phased out in favor of the lighter air-cooled designs. The mediums are now used both as heavy machine guns, while mounted on tripods, and as light machine guns, while mounted on bipods. This was possible, in part, because a heavy static MG position was not a very effective tactic in vehicle centered warfare, and the lighter air- cooled designs could nearly match the capabilities of water-cooled designs with a combination of other, lighter cooling features. This resulted in the widespread use of medium weight machine guns by infantry, but also on tanks, aircraft, and on tripods. The practice of using medium-weight machine guns continued into the 1930s. The French made a version of their infantry machine gun, the Châtellerault M1924, with 150-round magazine and internal water cooler. The German requirement for a new medium machine gun, a Einheitsmaschinengewehr (standard machine gun), resulted in a Universelles Maschinengewehr (universal machine gun) that was to not only be a medium machine gun that was used in many roles, but was specifically named so. It was similar to older mediums in that it was a medium machine gun intended to replace older light and heavy machine guns of the same caliber, though Germany would continue using a variety of heavier and lighter automatic machine guns to a limited extent. The use of medium machine guns to replace other types would later be called a General Purpose Machine Gun by the Belgians in the 1950s. The actual practice of using medium machine guns in different roles dates back to World War I, whatever the name given by different countries. The trend toward replacing more types with mediums would receive a great boost as tactics using heavy water-cooled MGs were slowly phased out, but suffered a loss when there was shift back to lighter caliber automatic infantry support weapons. =Late 20th century = SG-43. The Belgian name Mitrailleuse d'Appui General, or general-purpose machine gun (GPMG), became popular for describing medium machine guns used in multiple roles. The mediums fired full- power rifle-caliber ammunition, but had some concessions for more extended firing and more general usage. This generally included both bipod and tripod/pintle mounting options and quick-change barrels. Water-cooled machine guns of the same caliber as the existing mediums were no longer useful, as the situation in which they excelled (non-stop firing) was regarded as no longer being needed in modern warfare. This is because mass charges by infantry are rarely done, replaced by ARV-based thrusts, and that a static MG position is a high-priority target for infantry rocket launchers. Modern medium machine guns do not match the sustained firing ability of many older mediums; there is no longer a need for it. Most medium machine guns that use barrel replacement overheat after about 200 rounds, and then a quick barrel replacement is needed (such as was done on the Bren). They can only keep firing if they have spare barrels. However, barrels are expensive and heavy, so only a limited amount are kept. As a result, even if two or three barrels were carried and rotated in and out, it would not allow non-stop fire; the removed barrel does not cool down before the next must be replaced. This has become a moot point, since situations where non-stop fire is needed is rare, and other tactics and weapons can deal with an emergency. Smaller-caliber light machine guns The 1960s and 70s saw the introduction of new families of automatic weapons using smaller cartridges than the full-power rifle caliber cartridges previously in use. These weapons were called Squad Automatic Weapons (SAW). They have taken roles away from the previous medium machine guns, as well as lighter machine guns of the same caliber. However, the medium machine guns continue to be used in many of their previous roles, especially on tanks and vehicles. Often, countries field a mix of medium-caliber medium machine guns, and smaller-caliber light machine guns. M249 in the SAW role These weapons typically fired the 7.62×39mm cartridge fired by the AK-47 series or the 5.56×45mm NATO standard cartridge first used in the AR-15/M-16 rifles. These very lightweight machineguns were designed for more sustained fire than normal infantry rifles, several hundred rounds worth of extended firing. They were similar in weight to an empty older light machine gun and several pounds lighter than mediums, but offered a much higher volume of fire due to their smaller caliber and lighter round; lower cartridge weight allows a greater total amount of ammunition to be carried by a gunner and/or other squad members carrying additional ammunition for the weapon. Many models were scaled-down medium caliber designs or heavier, longer-barrel versions of infantry standard Assault rifles. Examples include the FN Minimi, M249 (US designation of the FN Minimi) or the RPK. =21st century= The term \\"medium machine gun\\" is used to refer to the ubiquitous full-power rifle-caliber machine gun designs, which are alternatively called general-purpose machine guns or universal machine guns. M240G (foreground) and an Iraqi PKM (background) They essentially all have provisions for quick-change barrels and the ability to be fired from a bipod, tripod, or pintle mount, and weigh between 20-30 pounds. Modern Western MMG/GPMG weapons almost always fire 7.62×51mm full-power rifle ammunition; modern Eastern MMG/GPMG weapons usually fire 7.62×54mmR full-power rifle ammunition with a rimmed cartridge. For example, the US Army and Marines now use the FN MAG (as the M240 machine gun), which is generally called the \\"M240 medium machine gun\\". It was originally adopted for vehicle mounting in the late 1970s, but its higher reliability resulted in the infantry adopting it for use over the M60 machine gun, despite it being several pounds heavier. They both have quick-detachable barrels, bipods in their light infantry model, tripod and pintle mount options for other models, and similar weight and size. The M60 was typically referred to either as a light machine gun or a general-purpose machine gun.

First published in 1940, after World War II had begun in Europe the previous year, the story covers the period from 1913 to 1919, before and after World War I. Plot summary Lanny Budd is a teenage student at a private school in Germany for music and dance. Budd, born in Switzerland, is the grandson of the president of Budd Gunmakers in New England. His parents are American born: his father is the European sales representative, and his mother, his father's former mistress, is supported in grand style on the French Riviera. The story follows Lanny Budd, his English schoolmate Rick, and his German friend Kurt through World War I. In the aftermath, Budd joins the staff of the U.S. delegation for the negotiation of the Treaty of Versailles. The plot and characters are developed to reveal historical facts as well as the ideological tensions at the time. Budd was troubled by knowing his two closest friends were involved on opposite sides of the major war. Later he was disturbed by what he considered the failure of the negotiations at Versailles to get past the bitterness of the French and British people against Germany.

The only species is E. angustidens, which was long considered a species of Hyracotherium. Its remains have been identified in North America and date to the Early Eocene (Ypresian) stage. Discovery Charles Knight In 1876, Othniel C. Marsh described a skeleton as Eohippus validus, from the Greek ἠώς (eōs, \\"dawn\\") and ἵππος (hippos, \\"horse\\"), meaning \\"dawn horse\\". Its similarities with fossils described by Richard Owen were formally pointed out in a 1932 paper by Sir Clive Forster Cooper. E. validus was moved to the genus Hyracotherium, which had priority as the name for the genus, with Eohippus becoming a junior synonym of that genus. Hyracotherium was recently found to be a paraphyletic group of species, and the genus now includes only H. leporinum. E. validus was found to be identical to an earlier-named species, Hyracotherium angustidens (Cope, 1875), and the resulting binomial is thus Eohippus angustidens. Stephen Jay Gould comments In his essay, \\"The Case of the Creeping Fox Terrier Clone\\", Stephen Jay Gould lamented that the same arcane phrase (\\"the size of a small Fox Terrier\\"), when most readers would be not be closely familiar with size of a Fox Terrier. Gould concluded that Henry Fairfield Osborn had described it that way in a widely distributed pamphlet. The reasons for this comparison are unclear, but Gould proposes that Osborn, a keen fox hunter, could have made a natural association between horses and the dogs that accompany them. Eohippus was approximately 12 inches high at the shoulder, comparable to a Fox Terrier, which is up to 13 inches high at the shoulder.

Biography Pyke was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of vaudevillian David Pike and his wife Pauline. Pyke majored in theatre at UCLA in the 1960s, appearing in numerous student films, including one for Ray Manzarek, keyboard player of The Doors, called Induction (1965), which also featured the Doors' vocalist Jim Morrison in a brief role. During that time period, Pyke was also associated with actor Del Close.  Career  After graduating from UCLA, Pyke began his career as a character actor in low-budget and independent films. Pyke also has a small part in the John Milius film Dillinger (1973). Although many of his better known films are in the horror genre, Pyke acted in everything from blaxploitation to musical comedies. He had a uniquely manic acting style, with a penchant for exaggerated physical comedy, marked by a distinctive, raspy voice. Besides his film work, Pyke acted in theater, musical revues, etc. During the 1970s, Pyke appeared in the 1975 horror film Lemora: A Child's Tale of the Supernatural, Dolemite (1975), The First Nudie Musical (1976) and Spawn of the Slithis (1978).

Other noteworthy 1980s appearances include the teen comedy film Bad Manners (1984), starring Martin Mull and Karen Black, and the horror comedy film Vamp (1986), starring Grace Jones. Towards the end of the 1980s, Pyke's acting career slowed down and he began acting in television commercials. His last movie role was in the low-budget, straight- to-video 1988 horror film Hack-O-Lantern. Pyke last lived in Los Angeles, performing as a nightclub comedian after surviving quadruple bypass surgery. In 2004, he contributed to a book about obscure 1970s genre films, Gods in Polyester, reminiscing on Lemora, Dolemite and others, in a style very much in tune with his on-screen persona. Pyke also contributed pieces on Blade Runner and Hack-O-Lantern to the book Gods In Spandex, A Survivor's Account of 80's Cinema Obscura (2007), a sequel to Polyester. He was also interviewed for an E! True Hollywood Story episode on David Carradine in 2000. Pyke's final film appearance was in Dealing, released posthumously in 2012.

She was known for her semi-classical Urdu ghazal songs and classical thumris, but also sang easy-listening numbers in the 1950s films. Iqbal Bano's prominent work includes her singing of ghazals of the great Urdu poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz. In 1974, she became the recipient of the Pride of Performance award. Early life Iqbal Bano was born in 1935 in Delhi, British India. From a young age, she developed a love for music. It was a crucial moment of her life when her friend's father told Bano's father, \\"My daughters do sing reasonably well, but Iqbal Bano is especially blessed in singing. She will become a big name if you begin her training.\\" Her father allowed her to study music. She spent her childhood years in Rohtak near Delhi. In Delhi, she studied under Ustad Sabri Khan and Ustad Chaand Khan of the Delhi gharana, an expert in all kinds of pure classical and light classical forms of vocal music.Iqbal Bano ghazal personified Dawn (newspaper), Published 22 April 2009, Retrieved 3 July 2020 He instructed her in pure classical music and light classical music within the framework of classical forms of thumri and dadra. She was duly initiated Ganda-bandh shagird (formally initiated disciple; Ganda-bandh is a traditional knot-tying-ceremony which cements the relationship between guru and student) of her Ustad (teacher). Career Ustad Chaand Khan referred her to All India Radio, Delhi, where she sang on the radio and recorded her first songs. In 1952, aged 17, she migrated to Pakistan and also married into a land-owning family in Multan, Pakistan. She moved to Multan with her husband who promised her that he would never try to stop her from singing, but would rather encourage and promote her. She had become a 'singing star' by the 1950s, singing soundtrack songs for famous Pakistani Urdu films like Gumnaam (1954), Qatil (1955), Inteqaam (1955), Sarfarosh (1956), Ishq-e-Laila (1957), and Nagin (1959). Her husband died in 1980, after which she moved to Lahore from Multan. It was observed by many music critics that her temperament was particularly suited to vocal genres like thumri, dadra and ghazal. According to BBC News website, \\"Few singers of classical music matched the brilliance of her voice and her command over musical notes\\". Iqbal Bano was later invited by Radio Pakistan for classical performances on the radio. Her debut public concert took place in 1957, at the Lahore Arts Council. She was considered a specialist in singing the ghazals of Faiz Ahmed Faiz, a Lenin Prize-winning poet. In 1985, Bano became a cult icon when she roused a strong crowd of 50,000 people in Lahore by singing Faiz's passionate Urdu anthem, Hum Dekhenge (We Will See), despite the poet's works being banned by General Zia ul-Haq's military regime on the grounds of his close ties with Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. In due course, she generated more and more public appeal and became a specialist in singing the kalam of Faiz Ahmad Faiz and had the moral courage to violate the government ban on singing Faiz's poems. Her inciting ghazals were seen as an act of defiance and resistance. She was considered a great singer of the ghazals of Nasir Kazmi. She also sang Persian poetry, which became popular in Iran and Afghanistan. In pre-1979 Afghanistan, she was often invited to the annual cultural fair, the Jashn-e-Kabul. In light classical, her presentation of Thumris in Raag Khamaj (Kaahe Sataye Mohey), Raag Tilak Kamod (Sautan Ghar Na Ja), Raag Des (Nahin Pare Mohe Chain), Raag Pilu (Gori Tore Naina Kajar Bin Kaare) and other such renderings which have become ever-green classics. Music lovers noted some similarities between Iqbal Bano and Begum Akhtar, especially some marked resemblances in their styles of singing. Bano's recitals stuck to a classical style that lays more stress on the raag purity. Awards * Pride of Performance Award (1974) by the President of Pakistan.

Some of the Native American groups played a minor role, while others launched attacks throughout South Carolina in an attempt to destroy the colony. Native Americans killed hundreds of colonists and destroyed many settlements, and they killed traders throughout the southeastern region. Colonists abandoned the frontiers and fled to Charles Town, where starvation set in as supplies ran low. The survival of the South Carolina colony was in question during 1715. The tide turned in early 1716 when the Cherokee sided with the colonists against the Creek, their traditional enemy. The last Native American fighters withdrew from the conflict in 1717, bringing a fragile peace to the colony. The Yamassee War was one of the most disruptive and transformational conflicts of colonial America. For more than a year, the colony faced the possibility of annihilation. About seven percent of South Carolina's settlers were killed, making the war one of the bloodiest wars in American history.Oatis, A Colonial Complex, p. 167. The Yamasee War and its aftermath shifted the geopolitical situation of both the European colonies and native groups, and contributed to the emergence of new Native American confederations, such as the Muscogee Creek and Catawba. The origin of the war was complex, and reasons for fighting differed among the many Indian groups that participated. Factors included the trading system, trader abuses, the Indian slave trade, the depletion of deer, increasing Indian debts in contrast to increasing wealth among some colonists, the spread of rice plantation agriculture, French power in Louisiana offering an alternative to British trade, long-established Indian links to Spanish Florida, power struggles among Indian groups, and recent experiences in military collaboration among previously distant tribes. Background Overview map of the Yamasee War The Tuscarora War and its lengthy aftermath played a major role in the outbreak of the Yamasee War. The Tuscarora were an Iroquoian-speaking tribe of the interior, and they began attacking colonial settlements of North Carolina in 1711. South Carolina settlers mustered their militia and campaigned against the Tuscarora in 1712 and 1713. These forces were made up mainly of allied Indian troops. The Yamasee had been strong allies of South Carolina colonists for many years, and Yamasee warriors made up the core of both Carolina forces. Other Indians were recruited over a large area from diverse tribes, some of whom were traditional enemies. Tribes that sent warriors to South Carolina's militia included the Yamasee, Catawba, Yuchi, Apalachee, Cusabo, Wateree, Sugaree, Waxhaw, Congraree, Pee Dee, Cape Fear, Cheraw, Sissipahaw, Cherokee, and various proto-Creek groups.Galley, The Indian Slave Trade, 267–268, 283. This collaboration brought Indians of the entire region into closer contact with one another. They saw the disagreements and weaknesses of the colonies, as South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia bickered over various aspects of the Tuscarora War.Galley, The Indian Slave Trade, 276–277. Essentially all of the tribes that helped South Carolina during the Tuscarora War joined in attacking settlers in the colony during the Yamasee War, just two or three years later. The Yamasee were an amalgamation of the remnants of earlier tribes and chiefdoms. The Upper Yamasee were primarily Guale originally from the Georgia coast. The Lower Yamasee included the Altamaha, Ocute (Okatee), Ichisi, (Chechessee), and Euhaw, who had come to the coast from the interior of Georgia.Worth 1993:40–45 They emerged during the 17th century in the contested frontier between South Carolina and Spanish Florida. They moved north in the late 17th century and became South Carolina's most important Indian ally. They lived near the mouth of the Savannah River and around Port Royal Sound., National Register Multiple Property Submission, Dr. Chester B. DePratter, National Park Service For years, the Yamasee profited from their relation with the settlers. By 1715, deer had become rare in Yamasee territory, and the Yamasee became increasingly indebted to the American traders who supplied them with trade goods on credit. Rice plantations had begun to thrive in South Carolina and was exported as a commodity crop, but much of the land good for rice had been taken up. The Yamasee had been granted a large land reserve on the southern borders of South Carolina, and settlers began to covet the land which they deemed ideal for rice plantations. Each of the Indian tribes that joined in the war had its own reasons, as complicated and deeply rooted in the past as that of the Yamasee. The tribes did not act in carefully planned coordination, but the unrest increased and tribes began to discuss war. By early 1715, rumors of growing Indian support for war was troubling enough that some friendly Indians warned colonists of the danger. They suggested that the Ochese Creek were the instigators. Summary of the war =Pocotaligo massacre= When the warnings about a possible Ochese Creek uprising reached the South Carolina government, they listened and acted. The government sent a party to the main Upper Yamasee town of Pocotaligo (near present-day Yemassee, South Carolina). They hoped to obtain Yamasee assistance in arranging an emergency summit with the Ochese Creek leaders. The delegation's visit to Pocotaligo triggered the start of the war. The delegation that visited Pocotaligo consisted of Samuel Warner and William Bray, sent by the Board of Commissioners. They were joined by Thomas Nairne and John Wright, two of the most important people of South Carolina's Indian trading system. Two others, Seymour Burroughs and an unknown South Carolinian, also joined. On the evening of April 14, 1715, the day before Good Friday, the men spoke to an assembly of Yamasee. They promised to make special efforts to redress Yamasee grievances. They also said that Governor Craven was on the way to the village. During the night, as the South Carolinians slept, the Yamasee debated over what to do. There were some who were not fully pledged to a war, but in the end the choice was made. After applying war paint, the Yamasee woke the Carolinians and attacked them. Two of the six men escaped. Seymour Burroughs fled and, although shot twice, raised an alarm in the Port Royal settlements. The Yamasee killed Nairne, Wright, Warner, and Bray. The unknown South Carolinian hid in a nearby swamp, from which he witnessed the ritual death-by-torture of Nairne.Oatis, A Colonial Complex, 124–125. The events of the early hours of Good Friday, April 15, 1715, marked the beginning of the Yamasee War. =Yamasee attacks and South Carolina counterattacks= The Yamasee quickly organized two war parties of several hundred men, which set out later in the day. One war party attacked the settlements of Port Royal, but Seymour Burroughs had managed to reach the plantation of John Barnwell and a general alarm had been raised. By chance, a captured smuggler's ship was docked at Port Royal. By the time the Yamasee arrived, several hundred settlers had found refuge on the ship, while many others had fled in canoes. The second war party invaded Saint Bartholomew's Parish, plundering and burning plantations, taking captives, and killing over a hundred settlers and slaves. Within the week, a large Yamasee army was preparing to engage a rapidly assembled South Carolinian militia. Other Yamasee went south to find refuge in makeshift forts. The Yamasee War was the first major test of South Carolina's militia. Governor Craven led a force of about 240 militia against the Yamasee. The Yamasee war parties had little choice but to join together to engage Craven's militia. Near the Indian town of Salkehatchie (or \\"Saltcatchers\\" in English), on the Salkehatchie River, a pitched battle was fought on open terrain. It was the kind of battle conditions which Craven and the militia officers desired and the Indians were poorly suited for. Several hundred Yamasee warriors attacked the 240 or so members of the militia. The Yamasee tried to outflank the South Carolinians but found it difficult. After several head warriors were killed, the Yamasee abandoned the battle and dispersed into nearby swamps. Although the casualties were about equal, 24 or so on each side, the practical result was a decisive victory for South Carolina. Other smaller militia forces pressed the Yamasee and won a series of further victories. Alexander MacKay, experienced with Indian war, led a force south. They found and attacked a group of about 200 Yamasee who had taken refuge in a palisade-fortified encampment. After a relatively small Carolinian party made two sorties over the walls of the fort, the Yamasee decided to retreat. Outside the fort, the Yamasee were ambushed and decimated by MacKay and about 100 men. A smaller battle took place in the summer of 1715, becoming known as the Daufuskie Fight. A Carolinian boat scout crew managed to ambush a group of Yamasee, killing 35 while suffering only one casualty. Before long, the surviving Yamasee decided to move farther south to the vicinity of the Altamaha River. =Traders killed= While the Yamasee were the main concern within the colony's settlements, British traders operating throughout the southeast found they were caught up in the conflict. Most were killed. Of about 100 traders in the field when the war broke out, 90 were killed in the first few weeks. Attackers included warriors of the Creek (the Ochese, Tallapoosa, Abeika, and Alabama peoples), the Apalachee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Catawba, Cherokee, and others. =Northern Front= During the first month of the war, South Carolina hoped to receive assistance from the northern Indians, such as the Catawba. But the first news from the north was that the Catawba and Cherokee had murdered British traders among them. The Catawba and Cherokee had not attacked traders as quickly as did the southern Indians. Both tribes were divided over what course to take. Some Virginian traders were accused of goading the Catawba into making war on South Carolina. Although the Catawba killed traders from South Carolina, they spared those from Virginia. By May 1715 the Catawba sent war parties against South Carolina settlers. About 400 warriors from the Catawba, Wateree, and Sarraw tribes, joined by about 70 Cherokee, terrorized the northern parts of the colony. The Anglican missionary Francis Le Jau stated that on May 15th South Carolinian force of 90 cavalry under Captain Thomas Barker, many of them Le Jau's parishioners, went north in response. They were guided by a former Native American slave who had been freed by Captain Barker's father-in-law Col. Jame Moore. Le Jau was of the opinion that the freed slave named Wateree Jack purposefully led Barker and his men into an ambush on May 17, laid by a force that he said contained a \\"Body of Northern Indians being a mixture of Catabaws, Sarraws Waterees &c.; to Number of 3. or 400\\". In the ambush the Northern Indian war party managed to kill 26 of them including Barker, ten of which were Le Jau's parishioners.. The defeat of Barker prompted the evacuation of the Goose Creek settlement leaving it entirely abandoned but for two fortified plantations. Le Jau noted that, rather than press their advantage, the Northern Indian war band stopped to besiege a makeshift fort on Benjamin Schenkingh's plantation. The fort was garrisoned by 30 defenders, both white and black. Ultimately the attackers feigned a desire to have peace talks. When they were allowed in they set about killing 19 of the defenders. After this, South Carolina had no defenses for the wealthy Goose Creek district, just north of Charles Town. Before the northern forces attacked Charles Town, most of the Cherokee left, as they had heard about their own towns being threatened. The remaining Northern Indians then faced a rapidly assembled militia of 70 men under the command of George Chicken, Le Jau's own son being among them. On June 13, 1715, Chicken's militia ambushed a Catawba party and launched a direct assault upon the main Catawba force. In the Battle of the Ponds, the militia routed the Catawba. The warriors were not used to such direct confrontation. After returning to their villages, the Catawba decided on peace. By July 1715, Catawba diplomats arrived in Virginia to inform the British of their willingness to not only make peace, but to assist South Carolina militarily. =Creek and Cherokee= The Ochese Indians had probably been instigators of the war at least as much as the Yamasee. When the war broke out, they promptly killed all the South Carolinian traders in their territory, as did the other Creek, the Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Cherokee. The Ochese Creek were buffered from South Carolina by several smaller Indian groups, such as the Yuchi, Savannah River Shawnee, Apalachee, and Apalachicola. In the summer of 1715, these Indians made several successful attacks on South Carolina settlements. Generally the Ochese Creek were cautious after South Carolina's counterattacks proved effective. The smaller Indian groups fled the Savannah River area. Many found refuge among the Ochese Creeks, where plans were being made for the next stage of the war. The Upper Creek were not as determined to wage war had strong respect for the Ochese Creek. They might have joined in an invasion if conditions were favorable. An issue at stake was trade goods. The Creek people had come to depend on English trade goods from South Carolina. Facing possible war with the British, the Creek looked to the French and Spanish as possible market sources. The French and Spanish were more than willing to supply the Creek, but they were unable to provide the same quantity or quality of goods which the British had been providing. Muskets, gunpowder, and bullets were especially needed if the Creek were to invade South Carolina. The Upper Creek remained reluctant to go to war. Nevertheless, the Creek formed closer ties to the French and Spanish during the Yamasee War. The Ochese Creeks had other connections, such as the Chickasaw and Cherokee. But the Chickasaw, after killing their English traders, had been quick to make peace with South Carolina. They blamed the deaths of the traders in their towns on the Creeks—a lame excuse that was gladly accepted by South Carolina. The Cherokee's position became strategically important. The Cherokee were divided. In general the Lower Cherokee, who lived closest to South Carolina, tended to support the war. Some participated in Catawba attacks on South Carolina's Santee River settlements. The Overhill Cherokee, who lived farthest from South Carolina, tended to support an alliance with South Carolina and war against the Creek. One of the Cherokee leaders most in favor of an alliance with South Carolina was Caesar, a chief of a Middle Cherokee town. In late 1715, two South Carolinian traders visited the Cherokee and returned to Charles Town with a large Cherokee delegation. An alliance was made, and plans for war against the Creek developed. But in the following month the Cherokee failed to meet up with South Carolinians at Savannah Town as planned. South Carolina then sent an expedition of over 300 soldiers to the Cherokee, arriving in December, 1715. They split up and visited the key Lower, Middle, and Overhill towns, and quickly saw how divided the Cherokee were. During the winter the Cherokee leader Caesar traveled throughout the Cherokee towns, drumming up support for war against the Creek. Other prestigious and respected Cherokee leaders urged caution and patience, including Charitey Hagey the Conjurer of Tugaloo, one of the Lower Towns closest to South Carolina. Many of the Lower Town Cherokee were open to peace with South Carolina, but reluctant to fight anyone other than the Yuchi and Savannah River Shawnee. The South Carolinians were told that a \\"flag of truce\\" had been sent from the Lower Towns to the Creek, and that a delegation of Creek headmen had promised to come. Charitey Hagey and his supporters seemed to be offering to broker peace talks between the Creek and South Carolinians. They convinced the South Carolinians to alter their plans of war. Instead, the South Carolinians spent the winter trying to dissuade Caesar and the pro-war Cherokee. =Tugaloo Massacre= On January 27, 1716, the South Carolinians were summoned to Tugaloo, where they discovered that the Creek delegation had arrived and that the Cherokee had killed 11 or 12 of them. The Cherokee claimed that the Creek delegation was in fact a war party of hundreds of Creek and Yamasee, and that they had nearly succeeded in ambushing the South Carolinian forces. It remains unknown exactly what happened at Tugaloo. That the Cherokee and Creek met in private without the South Carolinians present suggests that the Cherokee were still divided on whether to join the Creek and attack South Carolina or join the South Carolinians and attack the Creek. It is possible that the Cherokee, who were relatively new to trade with the British, hoped to replace the Creek as South Carolina's main trading partner. Whatever the underlying factors, the murders at Tugaloo probably resulted from an unpredictable and heated debate which, like the Pocotaligo massacre, ended in an impasse resolved through murder. After the Tugaloo massacre the only possible solution was war between the Cherokee and Creek and an alliance between the Cherokee and South Carolina. The Cherokee alliance with South Carolina doomed the possibility of a major Creek invasion of South Carolina. At the same time, South Carolina was eager to regain peaceful relations with the Creek and did not want to fight a war with them. While South Carolina did supply the Cherokee with weapons and trade goods, they did not provide the military support that the pro-war Cherokee had hoped for. There were Cherokee victories in 1716 and 1717, but Creek counterattacks undermined the Cherokee's will to fight, which had been divided from the start. Nevertheless, the Creek and Cherokee continued to launch small-scale raids against each other for generations. In response to The Tugaloo massacre and the Cherokee attacks, the Ochese Creek made a strategic defensive adjustment in early 1716. They relocated all their towns from the Ocmulgee River basin to the Chattahoochee River. The Ochese Creek had originally lived along the Chattahoochee, but had moved their towns to the Ocmulgee River and its tributary, Ochese Creek (from which the name \\"Creek\\" came), around 1690, in order to be closer to South Carolina. Their return to the Chattahoochee River in 1716 was thus not so much a retreat as a return to previous conditions. The distance between the Chattahoochee and Charles Town protected them from a possible South Carolina attack. In 1716 and 1717, as no major Cherokee-British attack materialized, the Lower Creek found themselves in a position of increased power and resumed raiding their enemies—British, Cherokee, and Catawba. But, cut off from British trade, they began to experience problems in the supply of ammunition, gunpowder, and firearms. The Cherokee, on the other hand, were well-supplied with British weaponry. The lure of British trade undermined anti-British elements among the Creek. In early 1717 a few emissaries from Charles Town went to the Lower Creek territory, and a few Creek went to Charles Town, tentatively starting the process that would lead to peace. At the same time other Lower Creeks were looking for ways to continue to fight. In late 1716 a group representing many Muskogean Creek nations traveled all the way to the Iroquois Six Nations in New York. Impressed by the Creek's diplomacy, the Iroquois sent 20 of their own ambassadors to accompany the Creek back home. The Iroquois and Creek were mainly interested in planning attacks on their mutual Indian enemies, like the Catawba and Cherokee. But to South Carolina, a Creek-Iroquois alliance was something to be avoided at all costs. In response, South Carolina sent a group of emissaries to the Lower Creek towns, along with a large cargo of trade good presents. =Frontier insecurity= After the Yamasee and Catawba had pulled back, South Carolina's militia reoccupied abandoned settlements and tried to secure the frontier, turning a number of plantation houses into makeshift forts. The militia had done well in preemptive offensive fighting, but was unable to defend the colony against raiding parties. Members of the militia began to desert in large numbers during the summer of 1715. Some were concerned for their own property and families, while others simply left South Carolina altogether. In response to the militia's failure, Governor Craven replaced it with a professional army (that is, an army whose soldiers were paid). By August 1715 South Carolina's new army contained about 600 South Carolinian citizens, 400 black slaves, 170 friendly Indians, and 300 troops from North Carolina and Virginia. This was the first time the South Carolina militia had been disbanded and a professional army assembled. It is also notable for the high number of black slaves armed (and their masters paid) to wage war. But even this army was not able to secure the colony. The hostile Indians simply refused to engage in pitched battles, using unpredictable raids and ambushes instead. In addition, the Indians occupied such a large territory that it was effectively impossible to send an army against them. The army was disbanded after the Cherokee alliance was established in early 1716. =Resolution= Since so many different tribes were involved in the war, with varying and changing participation, there was no single definitive end to the conflict. In some respects the main crisis was over within a month or two. The Lords Proprietors of the colony believed the colony was no longer in mortal danger after the first few weeks. For others it was the Cherokee alliance of early 1716 that marked the end of the war. Peace treaties were established with various Creek and other Muskogean peoples in late 1717. But some tribes never agreed to peace, and all remained armed. The Yamasee and Apalachicola had moved south, but continued to raid South Carolina's settlements well into the 1720s. Frontier insecurity remained a problem. Consequences =Political change= Although it took several years to accomplish, the Yamasee War led directly to South Carolina's overthrow of the Lords Proprietors. By 1720 the process of transition from a proprietary colony to a crown colony had begun. It took nine years, but in 1729 South Carolina and North Carolina officially became crown colonies. South Carolinians had been discontented with the proprietary system before the Yamasee War, but the call for change became shrill in 1715, after the first phase of the war, and only grew louder in the following years.Oatis, A Colonial Complex, 165–166. The Yamasee War also led to the establishment of the colony of Georgia. While there were other factors involved in Georgia's founding, it would not have been possible without the withdrawal of the Yamasee. The few Yamasee that remained became known as the Yamacraw, under the leadership of Tomochichi. James Oglethorpe negotiated with the Yamacraw in order to obtain the site where he founded his capital city of Savannah.Oatis, A Colonial Complex, 288–291. =Indian aftermath= A English copy of a deerskin Catawba map of the tribes between Charleston (left) and Virginia (right) following the Yamasee War. In the first year of the war the Yamasee lost about a quarter of their population, either killed or enslaved. The survivors moved south to the Altamaha River, a region that had been their homeland in the 17th century. But they were unable to find security there and soon became refugees. As a people, the Yamasee had always been ethnically mixed, and in the aftermath of the Yamasee War they split apart. About a third of the survivors chose to settle among the Lower Creek, eventually becoming part of the emerging Creek confederacy. Most of the rest, joined by Apalachicola refugees moved to the vicinity of St. Augustine in the summer of 1715. Despite several attempts to make peace, by both South Carolinians and Yamasee individuals, conflict between the two continued for decades. The Yamasee of Spanish Florida were in time weakened by disease and other factors. The survivors either became part of the Seminole or the Hitchiti. The various proto-Creek Muskogean tribes grew closer after the Yamasee War. The reoccupation of the Chattahoochee River by the Ochese Creek, along with remnants of the Apalachicola, Apalachee, Yamasee, and others, seemed to Europeans to represent a new Indian identity, and needed a new name. To the Spanish it seemed like a reincarnation of the Apalachicola Province of the 17th century. To the English, the term Lower Creek became common. The Catawba confederacy emerged from the Yamasee War as the most powerful Indian force of the Piedmont region, especially as the Tuscarora migrated away to join the Iroquois in the north. In 1716, a year after the Catawba had made peace with South Carolina, some Santee and Waxhaw Indians killed several colonists. In response the South Carolina government asked the Catawba to \\"fall upon them and cut them off\\", which the Catawba did. According to contemporaries, surviving Waxhaw then either joined the Cheraw or traveled south to Florida with the Yamasee.Moore, P.N. (2007)World of Toil and Strife, p.16 There is another theory, originating with Robert Ney McNeely's history of Union County, published in 1912, that the Waxhaw continued on as an independent tribe until the 1740s but this seems to lack the backing of primary sources. Surviving Santee are reported to have married into the Ittiwan tribe suggesting a possible merger. The Cheraw remained generally hostile for years to come.

History The first written document that mentions the name \\"Crnković\\" dates from 1429, from the village of Zavrsji in the county of Brod Moravice. The document is a church testimonial of the marriage between Petar Crnković (1411–1452) and Marija Boreli on 2/3 1429. In 1635, Ivan Crnković (1611–1672), captain of the Frankopan Guard married Klara Frankopan (1618–1669), the daughter of Petar Dimitri Frankopan (brother of Fran Krsto Frankopan). The Frankopan dynasty, together with the Zrinski dynasty dominated Croatian history (they were the two most prominent families in Croatia from the 14th to the 17th century). In the year of 1636, Ivan Crnković was promoted to chief commandant of the Frankopan Guard and the Crnković family acquired lordship status. The first Crnković coat of arms dates from 1637. In 1663, Fran Krsto Frankopan donated a fortified estate in the vicinity of Velike Lesice. This estate is in Crnković possession until 1798, when Petar Nikola Crnković (1752–1810) burned down his own estate as a supporting gesture towards the French Revolution. Ivan Juraj Crnković (1748–1812), brother of Petar Nikola, moved 1779 to France, under the name Jean de Noir. Twelve years later most of his family were executed during the French Revolution. He escaped to Italy with his wife, under the name de Niro, but returned to France when Napoleon came to power. He died in the Napoleonic campaign on Russia. His French wife, Marie Louise de Noir (born de Toulange) moved to Croatia and lived in Zagreb until her death in 1845. Antun Stjepan Crnković (1782–1848) (son of Petar Nikola Crnković), the chief commissar of Zagreb acquired count status for the Crnković family from the emperor Franz Joseph I (for ending the uprising in Zagreb 1833). In 1842, the Crnković coat of arms was changed, designed in a national–romantic manner. Ivan Stjepan Crnković(1785–1857) (son of Petar Nikola Crnković) was in 1815 the associate consul of the Habsburg monarchy in London. He married in 1820 Lady Mary of Selborne (the widow of Lord Thomas of Selborne (18th–19th century)). That branch of the Crnković family still exists in England. The third son of Petar Nikola Crnković, Ivan Robespierre Crnković (1793–1847) bought an estate near the town of Delnice. This estate was in Crnković possession until 1945, when it was burned to the ground by partisan forces. The son of Antun Stjepan Crnković, Tomislav Nikola Crnković (1810–1880) settled down on an estate near the town of Lokve. Today, there is still a number of Crnkovićs that live in the vicinity of Lokve near Delnice. There is also a Crnković cluster in the town of Đakovo. In the early 20th century, several Crnković moved to Canada, the United States and Zimbabwe. There are direct and indirect descendants registered under \\"Czernkovich\\",\\"Crnkovich\\" or \\"Cinkovich\\" in United States and other parts of the world.

Early career After his training under Gweneth Lloyd at the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, David began his performing career with England's Metropolitan Ballet. Here he met Celia Franca, who would become the founding Artistic Director of the National Ballet of Canada. He also shared the stage with Eric Bruhn, Sonia Arova and John Taras, performing Design With Strings, Dances from Galanta and other works in a tour of Scandinavia. Career He returned to Canada in 1949 and after a brief musical theatre diversion in Vancouver and California, moved to Toronto to join Celia Franca during the formative years of Canada's National Ballet. He became the company's first principal male dancer in 1951 and remained with the company until 1963. He used his knowledge of classical dance and stagecraft to build an audience for the company, and introducing Canada's first home-grown principal ballerina, his wife Lois Smith. A brilliant amateur cinematographer, his \\"in-camera\\" videos from the 1950s are a significant part of the Celia Franca Tour De Force double DVD set. Adams also played a part in the birth of television in his native country, directing and performing in weekly productions for the fledgling Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). In 1961, David moved to England, dancing with the London Festival Ballet (1961–69) and Royal Ballet (1970–1976). During his time with Festival Ballet, he became known in Europe as \\"Peer Gynt\\" because of the familiarity of ballet audiences with his appearance in that role. He danced with Margot Fonteyn, Galina Samsova, Toni Lander, Lynn Seymour, Svetlana Beriosova and others during a long and distinctive career which brought him to the Middle East, South America and Japan. David's contributions to \\"the art\\" include a body of choreography. Two of his own works, Suite in G and Walpurgisnacht, became part of the repertoire with Festival Ballet. Pas de deux Romantique (1961), Barbara Allen (1961), Pas de Six (1960), The Littlest One (1959), Pas de Chance (1956), Ballet Behind Us (1952) and Masquerade pas de deux (1951) are part of his contributions to the National Ballet of Canada. Lecture Demonstrations with the Alberta Ballet In 1977, David relocated to Edmonton, Alberta, where he turned his talents to choreography and teaching and the occasional performance. He joined the Alberta Ballet Company under Brydon Paige, alternating between the roles of choreographer, ballet master, technical director and principal dancer. In 1980, David played a key role in the creation of both the dance and theatre programmes at Grant MacEwan College. His 1994 version of Don Quixote is unique in its presentation of Quixote's perspective, paralleling a psycho-drama to the dance story. Adams also worked to preserve Canadian choreography. In 1983 he worked with Lawrence Adams and Miriam Adams, his brother and sister-in-law, to reconstruct and archive Boris Volkoff's Red Ears of Corn. Adams retired from active teaching in 1998 and began work on a range of historic, artistic and technical memoirs. Awards Adrienne Clarkson invests David Adams into the Order of Canada In 1966 Adams won the Festival de la Opera Gold Medal in Madrid for his performance in Giselle. In 2004, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. On 2 September 2005, he was presented the insignia of Officer of the Order of Canada by the Governor General Adrienne Clarkson during a private ceremony held near Stony Plain, Alberta.

The complex originated in 1992 and came into fruition in June 1998. It opened in December 2000, with expansions opening in March and May 2001. The complex consists of: a multipurpose arena, science centre and shopping centre. The shopping centre houses a movie theatre and bowling alley, alongside a selection of restaurants. History Arena logo used from 2000–15 The Odyssey Centre was 50% funded by a £45m grant from the Millennium Commission as part of the Landmark Project for Northern Ireland with matched funding from the Department of Education Northern Ireland, the Sheridan Group and the Sports Council for Northern Ireland. The application to the Millennium Commission was led by the Ulster Museum, who wished to develop a science centre and teamed up with Peter Curistan who wished to develop an IMAX, and then led the development of the Arena with L&R; leisure who were the consultants. The name \\"Odyssey\\", was to symbolise the 'journey of discovery' that would be the science centre and Michael Montgomery, a young 14-year-old at the time came up with the name. The complex adopted the name, and the Science Centre became W5. The arena opened in 2000, W5 on 31 March 2001 with the Pavilion opening a few months later. The Odyssey is quoted to have cost £120 million on completion. Odyssey was held in Trust by the Odyssey Trust Company with leases to SMG/Sheridan for the Arena, Sheridan for the Pavilion and the National Museums NI for W5. In 2011 Odyssey Trust took over the Arena. In 2011 The Odyssey Pavilion which was owned by The Sheridan Group went into administration, and the building went under control of KPMG temporarily until the energy company SSE purchased it. It is managed by The Odyssey Trust. Facilities =SSE Arena, Belfast= Interior bowl of the arena before an ice hockey match, 2010 Formerly the Odyssey Arena from 2000 to 2015.

W5 was developed by Dr Sally Montgomery, the Ulster Museum's Project Director (and then founding CEO) with the exhibitions being designed by Hands On Inc, Florida USA and Ontario Science Centre, Canada. W5 has roughly 250 interactive exhibits, along with 6 themed exhibitions, in 3500 sq metres of exhibition space, workshop space and lecture theatre. W5 was a wholly owned subsidiary of the National Museums Northern Ireland until 31 March 2012 when it became a subsidiary of Odyssey Trust. W5 has won a huge number of awards including Best Visitor Attraction, several times. In 2013, W5 opened 'Climbit' (pronounced \\"climb it\\"), the biggest Luckey Climber in Europe where small children can climb up twelve metres in total safety. Future In October 2009, The Odyssey Trust sought planning permission for a £100m extension plan. The plans include 800 residential units, two hotels, a promenade, shops, additional leisure facilities and a multi-storey car park. On 29 November 2013, the owners of the Odyssey won planning permission for an extension to include hotels, shops and apartments creating around 1,000 new jobs. Work is due to start immediately, with around 800 people set to work on construction of the scheme – described as the biggest redevelopment in Belfast in years. Odyssey Trust's plan is to build next to the existing Odyssey Arena and Pavilion as part of the restart of the Belfast master plan. In October 2017, it was announced that Planning Permission had been submitted to transform the Complex in a £10m refurbishment. Plans include a new entrance to the Odyssey Pavilion, upgrade of Public Realm and reconfiguration of existing retail units. Phase two will see improved visitor access and greater use of the central open space. Awards The Odyssey was short-listed for 'International Large Venue of the Year' (Outside of North America) in the 2005 Pollstar Concert Industry Awards, making it one of the top six major concert venues in the world.

Its Charity Number is 222377. History Established by Judy Fryd in 1946 as The National Association of Parents of Backwards Children, the organisation changed its name to The National Society for Mentally Handicapped Children in 1955, becoming The Royal Society for Mentally Handicapped Children and Adults following patronage from Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and Elizabeth II in 1981. Fryd had written to Nursery World magazine inviting other parents to contact her. Many wrote back expressing their anger and sorrow at the lack of services for their children. Since 1969 the Society has been commonly known by the abbreviation \\"Mencap\\" (presumably from Mentally Handicapped) and, in 2002, its full legal name was shortened to the Royal Mencap Society. In 1955, the Society opened its first project, the Orchard Dene short-stay residential home. In 1958, it launched a ground-breaking project called the Brooklands Experiment. This compared the progress of children with a learning disability who lived in hospital with a group of children who were moved to a small family environment and cared for using educational activities modelled on those in \\"ordinary\\" nurseries. After two years, the children in the home-like environment showed marked improvements in social, emotional and verbal skills. The success of the experiment was published around the world. Mencap also provides help and support through supported living, supported employment, respite services, organised activities, systemic and individual advocacy, and outreach support. It has an individual membership organisation with a local network of more than 450 affiliated groups. Mencap's work is membership-driven, and thanks to its work for the welfare of young people, it is a member of The National Council for Voluntary Youth Services (NCVYS).Full list of NCVYS members In 2019 it formed a partnership with Vodafone to connect over 45 supported living homes using Internet of Things technology. The MyLife app gives residents control of their device while also providing support workers with remote access. Coalitions Mencap, along with 14 other organisations, is a member of the Learning Disability Coalition. The Coalition was formed in May 2007 to campaign for better funding for social care for people with a learning disability in England. Mencap partnered with ENABLE Scotland in a special 'sister charity' relationship to help support people with learning disabilities in Scotland. Management Since 1998, at least one-third of the members of the National Assembly must be people with a learning disability. From 1980 the actor Brian Rix represented the charity in a number of positions, including Secretary-General, Chairman and finally President. Until October 2019, the chief executive of Mencap was Jan Tregelles, succeeding Mark Goldring in March 2013. Tregelles first worked at Mencap in 1983 as PA to one of the then directors. She has held various posts across Mencap; she has been the director of personal support since 2002 and has grown the business from £80 million turnover to £180 million in that time. In the summer of 2019, Jan announced that she would be leaving Mencap. She was succeeded by Edel Harris in October 2019\\"Mencap appoints new chief executive\\" 2019-10-23  Supporters and ambassadors  In 1986, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother became the patron of Mencap and in 2004 the Countess of Wessex became Mencap's patron.

Microformats emerged around 2005 and were predominantly designed for use by search engines and aggregators such as RSS. Although the content of web pages has been capable of some \\"automated processing\\" since the inception of the web, such processing is difficult because the markup elements used to display information on the web do not describe what the information means.

The use, adoption and processing of microformats enables data items to be indexed, searched for, saved or cross- referenced, so that information can be reused or combined. , microformats allow the encoding and extraction of event details, contact information, social relationships and similar information.  Background  Microformats emerged around 2005 as part of a grassroots movement to make recognizable data items (such as events, contact details or geographical locations) capable of automated processing by software, as well as directly readable by end-users.

Most of the existing microformats originated at the Microformats.org wiki and the associated mailing list by a process of gathering examples of web-publishing behaviour, then codifying it. Some other microformats (such as rel=nofollow and unAPI) have been proposed, or developed, elsewhere.  Technical overview  XHTML and HTML standards allow for the embedding and encoding of semantics within the attributes of markup elements. Microformats take advantage of these standards by indicating the presence of metadata using the following attributes: ; \`class\` : Classname ; \`rel\` : relationship, description of the target address in an anchor-element (\`[...](...)\`) ; \`rev\` : reverse relationship, description of the referenced document (in one case, otherwise deprecated in microformats) For example, in the text \\"The birds roosted at 52.48, -1.89\\" is a pair of numbers which may be understood, from their context, to be a set of geographic coordinates. With wrapping in spans (or other HTML elements) with specific class names (in this case \`geo\`, \`latitude\` and \`longitude\`, all part of the geo microformat specification): The birds roosted at 52.48, -1.89 software agents can recognize exactly what each value represents and can then perform a variety of tasks such as indexing, locating it on a map and exporting it to a GPS device. = Examples = In this example, the contact information is presented as follows: * Joe Doe * The Example Company * 604-555-1234 * <http://example.com/> With hCard microformat markup, that becomes: * Joe Doe * The Example Company * 604-555-1234 * <http://example.com/> Here, the formatted name (\`fn\`), organisation (\`org\`), telephone number (\`tel\`) and web address (\`url\`) have been identified using specific class names and the whole thing is wrapped in \`class=\\"vcard\\"\`, which indicates that the other classes form an hCard (short for \\"HTML vCard\\") and are not merely coincidentally named. Other, optional, hCard classes also exist. Software, such as browser plug-ins, can now extract the information, and transfer it to other applications, such as an address book. = In-context examples = For annotated examples of microformats on live pages, see HCard#Live example and Geo (microformat)#Usage.  Specific microformats  Several microformats have been developed to enable semantic markup of particular types of information. However, only hCard and hCalendar have been ratified, the others remaining as drafts: * hAtom (superseded by h-entry and h-feed) – for marking up Atom feeds from within standard HTML * hCalendar – for events * hCard – for contact information; includes: ** adr – for postal addresses ** geo – for geographical coordinates (latitude, longitude) * hMedia – for audio/video contenthMedia · Microformats WikiUltimate Guide to Microformats: Reference and Examples * hAudio – for audio content * hNews – for news content * hProduct – for products * hRecipe – for recipes and foodstuffs. * hResume – for resumes or CVs * hReview – for reviews * rel-directory – for distributed directory creation and inclusionrel- directory · Microformats Wiki * rel-enclosure – for multimedia attachments to web pagesrel=\\"enclosure\\" · Microformats Wiki * rel-license – specification of copyright licenserel=\\"license\\" · Microformats Wiki * rel-nofollow, an attempt to discourage third-party content spam (e.g. spam in blogs) * rel-tag – for decentralized tagging (Folksonomy)rel=\\"tag\\" · Microformats Wiki * xFolk – for tagged links * XHTML Friends Network (XFN) – for social relationships * XOXO – for lists and outlines  Uses  Using microformats within HTML code provides additional formatting and semantic data that applications can use. For example, applications such as web crawlers can collect data about on-line resources, or desktop applications such as e-mail clients or scheduling software can compile details. The use of microformats can also facilitate \\"mash ups\\" such as exporting all of the geographical locations on a web page into (for example) Google Maps to visualize them spatially. Several browser extensions, such as Operator for Firefox and Oomph for Internet Explorer, provide the ability to detect microformats within an HTML document. When hCard or hCalendar are involved, such browser extensions allow microformats to be exported into formats compatible with contact management and calendar utilities, such as Microsoft Outlook. When dealing with geographical coordinates, they allow the location to be sent to applications such as Google Maps. Yahoo! Query Language can be used to extract microformats from web pages. On 12 May 2009 Google announced that they would be parsing the hCard, hReview and hProduct microformats, and using them to populate search result pages. They subsequently extended this in 2010 to use hCalendar for events and hRecipe for cookery recipes. Similarly, microformats are also processed by Bing and Yahoo!. As of late 2010, these are the world's top three search engines. Microsoft said in 2006 that they needed to incorporate Microformats into upcoming projects, as did other software companies. Alex Faaborg summarizes the arguments for putting the responsibility for microformat user interfaces in the web browser rather than making more complicated HTML: * Only the web browser knows what applications are accessible to the user and what the user's preferences are * It lowers the barrier to entry for web site developers if they only need to do the markup and not handle \\"appearance\\" or \\"action\\" issues * Retains backwards compatibility with web browsers that don't support microformats * The web browser presents a single point of entry from the web to the user's computer, which simplifies security issues  Evaluation  Various commentators have offered review and discussion on the design principles and practical aspects of microformats. Microformats have been compared to other approaches that seek to serve the same or similar purpose. , there had been some criticism of one, or all, microformats. The spread and use of microformats was being advocated . This includes community resources for marketing microformats such as buttons, banners, wallpaper / desktop screens, logo graphics, etc. Opera Software CTO and CSS creator Håkon Wium Lie said in 2005 \\"We will also see a bunch of microformats being developed, and that’s how the semantic web will be built, I believe.\\" However, in August 2008 Toby Inkster, author of the \\"Swignition\\" (formerly \\"Cognition\\") microformat parsing service, pointed out that no new microformat specifications had been published since 2005. = Design principles = Computer scientist and entrepreneur, Rohit Khare stated that reduce, reuse, and recycle is \\"shorthand for several design principles\\" that motivated the development and practices behind microformats. These aspects can be summarized as follows: *Reduce: favor the simplest solutions and focus attention on specific problems; *Reuse: work from experience and favor examples of current practice; *Recycle: encourage modularity and the ability to embed, valid XHTML can be reused in blog posts, RSS feeds, and anywhere else you can access the web. = Accessibility = Because some microformats make use of title attribute of HTML's element to conceal machine-readable data (particularly date-times and geographical coordinates) in the \\"abbr design pattern\\", the plain text content of the element is inaccessible to screen readers that expand abbreviations. In June 2008 the BBC announced that it would be dropping use of microformats using the \`abbr\` design pattern because of accessibility concerns. = Comparison with alternative approaches = Microformats are not the only solution for providing \\"more intelligent data\\" on the web; alternative approaches are used and are under development. For example, the use of XML markup and standards of the Semantic Web are cited as alternative approaches. Some contrast these with microformats in that they do not necessarily coincide with the design principles of \\"reduce, reuse, and recycle\\", at least not to the same extent. One advocate of microformats, Tantek Çelik, characterized a problem with alternative approaches: For some applications the use of other approaches may be valid. If the type of data to be described does not map to an existing microformat, RDFa can embed arbitrary vocabularies into HTML, such as for example domain-specific scientific data such as zoological or chemical data for which there is no microformat. Standards such as W3C's GRDDL allow microformats to be converted into data compatible with the Semantic Web. Another advocate of microformats, Ryan King, put the compatibility of microformats with other approaches this way:  Microformats 2  Microformats2 was proposed and discussed during FOOEast, 2010-05-02. Microformats2 was intended to make it easier for authors to publish microformats and for developers to consume them, while remaining backwards compatible Using microformats2, the example above would be marked up as: The birds roosted at 52.48, -1.89 and: * Joe Doe * The Example Company * 604-555-1234 * <http://example.com/>  See also  *COinS *Embedded RDF *Intelligent agents *RDFa Lite *JSON-LD *S5 (file format) *Schema.org *Simple HTML Ontology Extensions *XMDP  Notes   References  = Citations = = Sources =   Further reading  * * Ahmet Soylu, Patrick De Causmaecker, Fridolin Wild Ubiquitous Web for Ubiquitous Environments: The Role of Embedded Semantics, article in Journal of Mobile Multimedia, Vol. 6, No.1, pp. 26–48, (2010).

The Billboard R&B; chart is today known as the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart. History From May 22, 1948 to October 13, 1958, multiple charts were published, which explains the overlap in the dates of the charts. The 1942 \\"Harlem Hit Parade\\" chart, based on juke box plays, became the \\"Race Records Juke Box\\" chart in 1945, and the \\"Race Record Best Sellers\\" chart, based on sales, began in parallel in 1948. They were renamed as R&B; charts in 1949. A third, \\"Jockeys\\" chart, based on radio airplay, was introduced in 1955, and a unified chart was only introduced in 1958. Because of the existence of multiple charts, some dates had more than one number-one song during the week. Gap in the chart From November 30, 1963 to January 23, 1965 there was no Billboard R&B; singles chart. Some publications have used Cashbox magazine's stats in their place. No specific reason has ever been given as to why Billboard ceased releasing R&B; charts, but the prevailing wisdom is that the chart methodology used was being questioned, since more and more white acts were reaching number-one on the R&B; chart. According to researcher Joel Whitburn, \\"there was so much crossover of titles between the R&B; and pop singles (Hot 100) charts that Billboard considered the charts to be too similar. This does not mean that R&B; artists stopped turning out hits. After all, it was during this 14-month period that Motown established itself as an R&B; institution.\\" Chart names * Harlem Hit Parade — 1942 to February 10, 1945. * Juke Box Race Records — February 17, 1945 to June 17, 1957. * Billboard's \\"Best Sellers\\" — May 22, 1948 to October 13, 1958. * Rhythm & Blues — June 25, 1949 to November 23, 1963. * Billboard's \\"Jockeys\\" — January 22, 1955 to October 13, 1958. * Hot R&B; — October 20, 1958 to November 23, 1963.
