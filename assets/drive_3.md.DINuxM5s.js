McSorleys' Old Ale House, Inc., 317 F.Supp. 593 (S.D.N.Y. 1970). The aged artwork, newspaper articles covering the walls, sawdust floors, and the Irish waiters and bartenders give McSorley's an atmosphere reminiscent of \\"Olde New York\\". No piece of memorabilia has been removed from the walls since 1910, and there are many items of \\"historical\\" paraphernalia in the bar, such as Houdini's handcuffs, which are connected to the bar rail. There are also wishbones hanging above the bar; supposedly they were hung there by boys going off to World War I, to be removed when they returned, so the wishbones that are left are from those who never returned. Two of McSorley's mottos are \\"Be Good or Be Gone\\", and \\"We were here before you were born\\". Prior to the 1970 ruling, the motto was \\"Good Ale, Raw Onions and No Ladies\\"; the raw onions can still be had as part of McSorley's cheese platter.

History McSorley's Bar, a 1912 painting by John French Sloan =Founding and later proprietors= When it opened, the saloon was originally called \\"The Old House at Home\\". McSorley's has long claimed that it opened its doors in 1854; however, historical research has shown that the site was a vacant lot from 1860 to 1861. p.171 The evidence for the 1854 date was considerable, but second-hand. A document at the Museum of the City of New York from 1904, in founder John McSorley's hand, declares it was established in 1854, and a New York Tribune article from 1895 states it \\"has stood for 40 years. . . \\" a short distance from Cooper Union. A 1913 article in Harper's Weekly declares that \\"This famous saloon ... is sixty years old.\\"Harper's Weekly Oct. 25, 1913, p.15 According to a 1995 New York Times \\"Streetscapes\\" article by Christopher Gray, the census taker who visited the Irish-born McSorley in 1880 recorded the year the founder of the pub first arrived in the United States as 1855, but immigration records show that he arrived on January 23, 1851, at the age of 18,McSorley Surname : Irish Immigration to America accompanied by Mary McSorley, who was 16.Irish Immigration Passenger Record Data: January 23, 1851. When confronted with the fact that the 1880 census did not contain this entry, Gray corrected it to 1900 in his book. John McSorley first appeared in city directories in 1862, and the building his bar occupies was built no earlier than 1858, according to city records. McSorley's is included within the East Village/Lower East Side Historic District, created by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2012. In the district's designation report, the building's date of construction is given as \\"c.1865\\", but it notes that indirect evidence may indicate that there was a small structure on the lot before that, since the value of the lot increased between 1848 and 1856, while that of surrounding lots did not, which may be explained by the existence of an unrecorded structure. By 1861 there was a two-story building on the lot, according to tax records, and by 1865 the present five-story one, but it is \\"unclear\\" if the former was extended upwards or a new building was constructed.Brazee, Christopher D., et al. \\"East Village/Lower East Side Historic District Designation Report\\" New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (October 9, 2012) Founding owner John McSorley died in 1910 at the age of 87.

The case decision made the front page of The New York Times on June 26, 1970. The suit, Seidenberg v. McSorleys' Old Ale House (1970, United States District Court, S. D. New York) established that, as a public place, the bar could not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. The bar was then forced to admit women, but it did so \\"kicking and screaming\\". In 1970 Barbara Shaum became the bar's first female patron. With the ruling allowing women to be served, the bathroom became unisex.

Retrieved May 15, 2017. Some sources cite RKO as the production company and distributor of The Painted Desert; however, according to AFI, Path√© Exchange, Inc., was actually the film's production company and distributor before Path√©'s takeover by RKO on January 29, 1931, only 11 days after the release of The Painted Desert. Produced by E. B. Derr, it was directed by Howard Higgin, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Tom Buckingham. It starred low-budget Western stars William Boyd (in his pre-Hopalong Cassidy days) and Helen Twelvetrees, and featured a young Clark Gable in his talking film debut. The picture was shot mostly on location in Arizona. Plot Two cowboy friends, Jeff (J. Farrell MacDonald) and Cash (William Farnum), are traveling through the desert in the southwest U.S., when they come upon a baby who has been abandoned in the back of a covered wagon. They can't leave the defenseless child, so decide to take the baby with them, however, they argue over which of them would be better suited to raising the child. When Cash ends up prevailing in the debate, this creates a lifelong rift between the two friends. Years later the baby has now grown into a young man, Bill Holbrook (William Boyd), who works with his adoptive father on their cattle ranch. Cash's erstwhile friend, Jeff, has remained in the area where the infant was found and has established his own ranch, centered on the water hole where the entire feud originally began, a feud which is still in full force. Jeff lives with his grown daughter, Mary Ellen (Helen Twelvetrees). The feud escalates when Cash wants to use the water hole on Jeff's property to water his cattle. Jeff is ready to confront Cash in a stand-off, preventing him from watering his cattle on the property Jeff has claimed, assisted by an itinerant cowboy, Rance Brett (Clark Gable), who has been smitten with Mary Ellen's beauty. The confrontation is temporarily avoided when Cash's herd unexpectedly stampedes. When Bill discovers tungsten on Jeff's property, he attempts to use it to close the division between his father and Jeff, however this only results in his father kicking him out. He turns to Jeff, and begins a mining operation, which actually has the opposite effect of Bill's original intention, only exacerbating the tension between Jeff and Cash. Bill and Jeff's partnership also causes tension with Rance, since Mary Ellen now shows an interest in Bill. After a shipment of tungsten which was on its way to pay the loan they had taken out to develop the mine is waylaid, Bill works furiously with the miners to replace it with another load. He is successful. However, as he is celebrating the success of the mine, as well as his impending nuptials with Mary Ellen, the mine is sabotaged by a series of explosions. Everyone believes the mine sabotage is the work of Cash, but it turns out to have been an act of jealousy on the part of Rance, who confesses, leaving the two old friends to reconcile, and their two children to marry.

In July it was announced that E.B. Derr had selected Higgin to direct the film, as well as naming the stars of the film, William Boyd and Dorothy Burgess. Later in the month it was reported that Higgin would head to Arizona to begin location scouting for the film, accompanied by fellow director, Tay Garnett, however in August Higgin began scouting in the Arizona desert with the screenwriter, Tom Buckingham. It was announced that the film would employ over 300 extras. Higgin was familiar with the area, having worked in and around Flagstaff, Arizona as a lumberjack prior to his entering the film industry. Towards the end of August it was announced that Clark Gable would join the cast as the antagonist. In September it was announced that Helen Twelvetrees had replaced Burgess in the cast. Tragedy struck the production shortly after filming began when the fourteen-month-old baby playing the role of the infant Bill Holbrook, died while on location. Cause of death was not released. The infant's name was Thais Baer, and she was from Glendale, Arizona. Bert Gilroy was named as assistant director, and production began the first week of September. Shortly after, it was announced that William Farnum and J. Farrell MacDonald had been added to the cast. During production, Charles Craig was replaced in the cast by Jerry Drew. During production, somewhere between twelve and forty actors were seriously injured in a dynamite explosion when the charge went off early during filming, and two crew members lost their lives; the injured included the director, Howard Higgin. The film's release was delayed several times. In early October the film's release was announced to be October 26, but by late October that release date was pushed back, to a premiere date of November 20. In the first week of November the cast and crew returned from location in Arizona to finish the interior scenes on the studio lot in Hollywood. Ninety percent of the film was shot in Arizona, between the Painted Desert in Dinosaur Canyon, and Tuba City, Arizona, as well as a nearby Indian reservation. In mid-November it was reported that the recording portion of the film had been completed. Clarence Kolster edited the film during December 1930. By November, advertisements promoting the film were being released to the trade papers. Produced by Path√© Exchange, the film would become part of the RKO Radio Pictures library when they purchased the studio in March, after which they took over distribution of the film. Reception Most reviews of the film were positive. Motion Picture Magazine thought the film was \\"worth seeing\\", and complimented the acting, the message and the cinematography. They stated that while you could call the plot \\"... hokum if you will, it's the hokum of which life is made and the spectacle of the clasped hands at the end brings an authentic thrill\\". The National Board of Review Magazine called the film an \\"exciting and well done\\" melodrama. Picture Play magazine, while complimented the acting, commented that it could not \\"...make a picture unaided by a story\\", and declaring the film was \\"duller and more pointless picture ...\\" than any they had ever seen. Copyright and home video status In 1958, the film entered the public domain in the USA due to the copyright claimants' failure to renew the copyright registration in the 28th year after publication. See Note #60, pg. 143 It was remade by RKO in 1938 as Painted Desert. The studio cut several action scenes directly from the negative of their earlier version for insertion into the remake. The Painted Desert has seen numerous budget public domain label releases on VHS and DVD. The film's original release length was 83:43, but all home video releases are of its edited 75-minute reissue version, missing the action scenes appropriated for the remake. In 2019, Kino Lorber released it alongside The Pay-Off (1930) and The Silver Horde (1930) on their \\"RKO Classic Adventures\\" Blu-ray and DVD. These transfers were restored by Lobster Films of France, but inexplicably The Painted Desert is still in its truncated form, despite its missing scenes being present in the extant 1938 remake. Notes The love interest in this film, Helen Twelvetrees, was a very popular actress in the early 1930s, but would be let go by the studio in 1936, at which point she retired from film. She was the answer to a popular Johnny Carson gag on The Tonight Show, \\"Who was Rin Tin Tin's favorite actress?\\" A myth about Gable evolved regarding this film. It was said that he did not know how to ride a horse prior to this film, and learned specifically for his supporting role in The Painted Desert. However, Gable had been a horseman since his early years, and merely took several lessons in Griffith Park prior to the commencement of filming in order to hone his skills. William Farnum was a major star during the silent era in Hollywood, starring in one of the earliest and most popular Westerns, the 1914 film The Spoilers. When he was injured during the filming of 1924's The Man Who Fights Alone, that effectively ended his leading man career. However, he would carry on as a character actor until his death in 1953. The 1938 remake was directed by David Howard and starred George O'Brien, Laraine Johnson, and Ray Whitley. The film is notable for the superior cinematography of the Arizona desert by Edward Snyder.

Lloyd (born May 13, 1964) is an American semi-retired martial artist, professional wrestler, and actor. He is best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling from 1996 to 1999 under the ring name Glacier. Early life Lloyd was born into a law-enforcement family in Brunswick, Georgia. His father, Harold, served as a commander with the Georgia State Patrol for 28 years; his mother, Lois, worked with the Georgia Driver's License Division prior to her retirement in 1999;Ray Lloyd Nitro Grill Opening online chat with Jeremy Borash and Bob Ryder. WCW Live! (WCW.com), May 22, 1999. and his fraternal twin brother, Ron, is a retired state trooper. A lifelong professional wrestling fan, Lloyd and his brother attended shows at the Jacksonville Coliseum. He graduated from Brunswick High School in 1982, and played offensive tackle for the school football team all four years, becoming its first All-State player in his senior year. He additionally competed for the track and field team, in the shot put and discus. A skilled martial artist, Lloyd took up Hung Ga at fourteen, later adding other disciplines. His school was owned and taught by a former government agent and a U.S. Marshal, before it closed to the public in 1982. In 1983, he began competing for the World Karate Association in full-contact tournaments, eventually winning the United States Southeastern Super Heavyweight title. During his WKA stint, he was never knocked out or even knocked down; his only loss came on a disqualification. However, when the WKA changed its rules in 1985 to allow kicks from the knee up (they were previously only from the waist up), Lloyd opted to retire from competition in order not to jeopardize his football scholarship by risking injury. He played center for Valdosta State University (the same alma mater as former WCW announcer Scott Hudson), under coach Mike Cavan, and was a teammate of former Atlanta Falcons linebacker Jessie Tuggle during his collegiate career. Lloyd graduated in 1989 with a master's degree in education. Professional wrestling careerEarly career (1987‚Äì1996)= Lloyd began his wrestling career shortly after graduation. He was trained by Georgia grappler Fred Avery in a makeshift ring set up in Avery's backyard, and then cut his teeth on the Georgia independent circuit for two years, during which he was given the ring name \\"Sugar Ray\\" Lloyd by Tommy Rich. Lloyd joined World Championship Wrestling (then the NWA) for their 1989 Great American Bash tour, in which his debut match was a loss to Butch Reed in Albany, Georgia. He recalled in a March 2001 interview with WCW Magazine, \\"To be in the same ring with a man that big who could move like that was intimidating.\\"Hudson, Scott. The Iceman Cometh...Again. WCW Magazine, March 2001 Lloyd worked as an assistant high school football coach at Lassiter High in Marietta, and at Valdosta Junior High School, once organizing a one- time pro wrestling event in the Valdosta High school gymnasium in which he participated. During weekends he worked Southern Championship Wrestling shows while receiving further training from Mr. Wrestling II and Bob Armstrong. He moved to Atlanta in 1990, and again as \\"Sugar Ray\\" Lloyd, tag teamed with Swain as \\"The Blazers,\\" named such after the Valdosta State athletic mascot. In 1991, Pro Wrestling Illustrated held a contest for readers to come up with a ring name for Swain. Lloyd additionally competed in the North Georgia Wrestling Alliance, alongside future WCW stars Scotty Riggs, Buff Bagwell, and Disco Inferno. Lloyd's second stint in WCW was when he was booked to be defeated by The Great Muta at a house show in Atlanta. Following that match, at Muta's request, Lloyd joined Muta on a string of WCW house shows before he moved to Japan in 1993. He joined the UWFI as a guest of shootfighter Nobuhiko Takada, and competed against Japanese and American fighters. Lloyd returned to the United States after UWFI folded in 1996, and during a conversation with friend Diamond Dallas Page, he mentioned that he was planning to integrate martial arts into his wrestling, which he had been unable to do during the early days of his career. At Page's request, WCW president Eric Bischoff, a martial arts practitioner himself, met with Lloyd for three hours and signed him to a contract. =World Championship WrestlingBlood Runs Cold (1996‚Äì1998) Glacier in 2008 Beginning in April 1996, Lloyd's new ring persona, Glacier, a gimmick similar to the Mortal Kombat character Sub-Zero, was introduced via a series of vignettes during WCW programming that featured the tagline Blood Runs Cold. He was fictionally profiled in the October 1996 issue of WCW Magazine as having traveled to Japan to study a fighting style that combined martial arts and pro wrestling maneuvers, with a 400-year-old helmet passed down to him by his master instructor, David Stater. He was then given the name \\"Glacier\\" by sensei Stater as a symbolization of the power of the elements.Author unknown. \\"Blood Runs Cold,\\" WCW Magazine, October 1996 Glacier was also given one of the most extravagant entrances in wrestling at the time, which consisted of blue laser lights streaming across the arena and synthetic snow falling from the ceiling, while the ring was enveloped in blue lighting. Production costs for the entrance amounted to nearly half a million dollars, while the costume and armor, designed by Andre Freitas of Atlanta- based AFX Studios, cost $35,000. The number 126 was carved into the armor's single breastplate as a reference to his father's badge number. Glacier wore a blue contact lens in his right eye to top off the outfit, which often prompted comments from WCW Monday Nitro analyst Bobby Heenan, such as \\"[He's] half man, half Siamese cat.\\"Glacier d. Disco Inferno, WCW Nitro Report - DDT Digest, 12/30/96 After slowly walking to the ring, he then engaged in a ritual of standing on a center turnbuckle in order to remove his armor and mask, then somersaulting off the buckle and into the center of the ring to perform a kata routine; this process sometimes lasted as long as two minutes.Glacier d. Mike Wenner - WCW Monday Nitro, 9/30/96 (YouTube) Moreover, since he was a face character, he would bow to the referee and his opponent. To further accentuate the character's image, Lloyd, a natural brunet, temporarily bleached his hair blond from April to December 1997. Glacier was originally intended to debut in July, but due to the coinciding appearance and immediate impact of the New World Order at the Bash at the Beach pay-per-view that month, his debut was delayed indefinitely; WCW worked this into a feud with Big Bubba Rogers, who criticized Glacier's hype and the overlong wait for his arrival during interviews on Nitro with the Dungeon of Doom. His debut finally occurred on September 9, 1996 episode of Pro, when he pinned The Gambler in a match, which was also one of only two matches in which he executed his Cryonic Kick finisher off the top rope before it was changed to a spinning reverse roundhouse kick, and subsequently to standard side kick. Glacier then defeated Bubba on his Nitro debut on September 16, ending the brief feud. The original costume and blue lighting were scrapped, however, after only his fourth match, a pinfall victory on Nitro over Mike Wenner on September 30. Following a subsequent ten-week hiatus off WCW television, he reappeared on Nitro on December 2, in which he debuted a new ring outfit and entrance music, then pinned Hardbody Harrison in a 60-second squash. After spending the beginning of his WCW career in the midcard, it was not until March 1997 that Glacier was put into his first long-term feud, with Mortis, who was depicted in the new storyline as an Asian pitfighter who was one of eccentric manager James Vandenberg's collection of \\"rare oddities\\" and who had shared a history with Glacier. The angle was titled \\"Blood Runs Cold\\"; the slogan had not been used since the vignettes from the previous year had stopped airing. Glacier defeated Mortis in the pay-per-view debut for both, at Uncensored on March 16, but after the match, Wrath made his first appearance as Vandenberg's then- unnamed newest charge, and both men double-teamed Glacier.WCW Uncensored Report, This Week in WCW - DDT Digest, 3/16/97 Postmatch assaults by Mortis and Wrath became commonplace after Glacier's Nitro matches, and on the April 21 episode, his helmet was also stolen by the pair after he defeated Ciclope in less than one minute.Glacier d. Ciclope, WCW Monday Nitro Report - DDT Digest His rematch with Mortis at Slamboree on May 18 ended in a disqualification after less than two minutes when Wrath attacked him from behind. Mortis and Wrath then had their way with Glacier for several minutes before he was rescued by Ernest \\"The Cat\\" Miller, who had entered the ring from the crowd. On June 15, Glacier pinned Wrath at The Great American Bash, after which another beating commenced, this time after he was handcuffed to the top rope by Mortis, who himself had been cuffed to the turnbuckle prior to the match in order to prevent outside interference.Great American Bash Report, This Week In The WCW - DDT Digest The very next night on Nitro, Glacier again defeated Mortis and then was attacked for the last time by Mortis and Wrath after Miller again came to his rescue. From then until Bash at the Beach, Glacier wrestled as a tag unit with Miller, mainly in the lower card against luchadors. After Mortis and Wrath finally won their first encounter in the feud at Bash at the Beach on July 13 and ended Glacier's undefeated streak, WCW promptly shut down the angle due to the creative team's inability to further evolve the characters and the storyline.Ray Lloyd shoot interview. RF Video, 2008 As a result, the backstory between Mortis and Glacier was therefore never revealed. On September 1, nearly a year after he had made his official debut, Glacier was handed his first singles loss by Buff Bagwell.Buff Bagwell d. Glacier, This Week in WCW - DDT Digest, 9/1/97 He and Miller lost their second consecutive pay-per-view affair in November, to the Faces of Fear at World War 3, and Glacier capped off the year with a squash at the hands of Bill Goldberg on December 27.Goldberg d. Glacier, WCW Monday Nitro Report - DDT Digest, 12/27/97 Despite an undefeated twelve-month singles period from September 1996 to August 1997, Glacier remained entrenched in the midcard ranks. He was booked as a heel for 1998, starting with an edition of WCW Saturday Night on January 24 in a rematch alongside Miller against Mortis and Wrath. Glacier and Miller were to fight each other two weeks earlier on the program, but it was called off after Glacier was attacked by Mortis and Wrath offscreen beforehand.WCW Saturday Night Report - DDT Digest, 1/10/98 However, during the tag match, Glacier turned on Miller, allowing Mortis and Wrath to get the win. This brought the \\"Blood Runs Cold\\" angle to an official close as Mortis and Wrath were split up from Vandenberg and moved into the singles ranks. Feud with Perry Saturn and injury (1998‚Äì1999) Glacier spent the next three months on a losing streak, losing matches to the likes of Steve McMichael, Prince Iaukea, and Lex Luger on Nitro and Thunder, while feuding on the side with Chris Adams on WCW Saturday Night in a battle of superkick finishers. Glacier then entered a feud with Perry Saturn, starting with an angle in which he cut a promo on the May 11 Nitro declaring that his Cryonic Kick finisher was his own move and threatened to take out anyone who used it.Glacier d. Sick Boy, 5/11/98 - YouTube This prompted a response from Saturn on Thunder later in the week, in which he lambasted Glacier for his in-ring appearance and his claiming ownership of the superkick.WCW Thursday Thunder Report - DDT Digest, 5/14/98 Starting with a pin of Sick Boy on May 18 after Saturn's outside interference was unsuccessful,Glacier d. Sick Boy, WCW Monday Nitro Report - DDT Digest, 5/18/98 Glacier then fought a series of matches against several other members of Raven's Flock. He and Saturn then alternated wins on WCW Thunder, but the most notable aspect of the angle was that Kanyon, who had recently shed the Mortis gimmick, was regularly conducting sneak attacks on Raven and the Flock in various disguises. On the June 4 edition of Thunder, Kanyon (disguised as referee Nick Patrick) entered the ring and took out Saturn with a Russian legsweep, allowing Glacier to get the win, and flashed the Mortis mask to Glacier before leaving the ring.Glacier d. Saturn, WCW Thunder Report - DDT Digest, 6/4/98 The feud died down shortly thereafter when Saturn was moved to a new angle involving Raven and the breakup of the Flock. A Glacier-Saturn matchup (won by Saturn) that aired on WCW Worldwide on September 26 was the last match broadcast on the program before its format was changed to a recap show.WCW Worldwide Report - DDT Digest, 9/26/98 Glacier suffered a severe knee injury during the main event on Nitro on June 29, in which he lost to then-United States champion Goldberg for the fourth time in what would be his only title challenge in WCW.Goldberg d. Glacier, WCW Monday Nitro Report - DDT Digest, 6/29/98 He kept the extent of the injury hidden until after the match and left the ring under his own power, but after rehabilitation proved unsuccessful, he underwent knee surgery. He was out until the November 5 Thunder, where he offered his support to Miller, who himself had undergone a heel turn.WCW Thunder Report - DDT Digest, 11/5/98 One week later, he returned to ring action for the first time in over four months, and debuted his new finisher, a version of Terry Gordy's Oriental thumb spike (dubbed the \\"Ice Pick\\"), for a submission victory over Adams.Glacier d. Chris Adams, WCW Thunder Report - DDT Digest, 11/12/98 On November 16, Glacier, Kanyon, and Wrath reunited for the first and only time since the demise of Blood Runs Cold, when Glacier and Kanyon were scheduled to face each other on Nitro after Wrath fought Raven in the previous match, but Raven's refusal to wrestle, despite goading by Kanyon, saw it called off. Wrath then took out his frustration by pummeling both Glacier and Kanyon inside the ring before their opening bell, but the match commenced nonetheless with Kanyon ultimately scoring the pin.Kanyon d.

By early 1999, Glacier was again booked to lose to lower-card opponents so that WCW could finally bury the character and allow Lloyd to transition into a new one. This came to a head on February 6, when he was pinned on Saturday Night by Al Green.Al Green d.

He then entered the ring after the fact to pose for the fans before pushing Smiley out of the way to perform his old kata routine. Though Lloyd never wrestled an actual match, the gimmick was a surprisingly mild success given the previous history of the character (a fan during the Bigelow match was seen on camera holding a sign that read \\"Glacier is My Hero\\"), but the angle abruptly ended and Glacier was not seen again following a skit on the February 7 edition of Thunder in which he was pummeled offscreen by Sean O'Haire inside his dressing room.WCW Thunder Report - DDT Digest, 2/7/01 Lloyd left WCW (which ceased operations six weeks later) permanently and returned to the independent circuit. On April 21, he won the TCW tag belts with Jorge Estrada.Jorge Estrada Profile - gerweck.net One of the highlights of Lloyd's wrestling career was fulfilling a childhood dream of winning the NWA World tag team titles, which he accomplished with Jason Sugarman on December 28, 2002, but Sugarman retired shortly after due to a career-ending injury.Solie's Title Histories - NWA Tag Team Titles - Royal Duncan and Gary Will.

The first paid missionary was Lindsay Burfoot.London City Mission, Informal Education website Today it is part of the wider City Mission Movement. The London City Mission's early work centred on the poor and destitute, developing a wide range of charitable help including Ragged Schools and ministering to working people. One missionary wrote Last year I walked 3,000 miles on London pavements, paid 1,300 visits, 300 of which were to sick and dying cab men. Missionaries were also appointed to visit members of London's new fire service. The service's first Chief, James Braidwood, introduced the first such missionary in 1854. Within five years the missionary was visiting nineteen fire stations throughout London, ministering to 450 people (firemen, their wives and dependents). The first Ragged School established by the London City Mission was in 1835 in a disused stable in the City of Westminster. It was established by the missionary Andrew Walker with a charitable donation fund-raised by Lord Shaftesbury amongst his colleagues in, and visitors to, the Houses of Parliament. Lord Shaftesbury became an ardent supporter of the Mission and YMCA's founder George Williams (YMCA) was an early president, until his death in 1905. LCM was established as a joint venture by members of different Protestant denominations. ‚Ä¢ Its aim was to ‚Äúgo to the people of London, especially the poor, to bring them to an acquaintance with Jesus Christ as Saviour, and to do them good by every means in their power.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ Its method was to recruit and pay full-time workers (all men at that time), assigning to each a ‚Äúdistrict‚Äù that he was to visit frequently, going from door to door. ‚Ä¢ Its goal was to draw people into local churches. LCM was a pioneering organisation, in: ‚Ä¢ inter-denominational evangelism; ‚Ä¢ employing full-time salaried lay-workers; ‚Ä¢ socially caring activity in Dickensian London. LCM and its staff were innovative, being instrumental in the founding of many other Christian and social organisations and in developing a wide range of ministry methods. The LCM exists to share with the people of London, patiently, sensitively and individually the transforming love of God in Jesus Christ, and to enable them to join his Church. Core Values: 1\\\\. The Christian faith as defined in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, as held by the historic Christian Church, and as summarised in the Mission's Statement of Faith (see below). 2\\\\. The duty of Christian evangelism, taking the good news of Jesus Christ to all, without regard to any distinctions of social status, gender, ethnicity, attitude or lifestyle. 3\\\\. The embodiment of the Christian message in compassionate and caring activity, as well as in relevant words, reflecting the ministry of Jesus Christ in word and deed, seeking true peace and justice for the city and its people. 4\\\\. The development of individuals and communities in a life of holiness, defined by the teachings of the Bible and reflecting the purity and attractive righteousness of God Himself. 5\\\\. The unique role of the Church in the plan of God, and the duty of the Mission to support and serve the Church in its task of evangelism and in its growth. 6\\\\. The maintenance of the highest standards of Christian integrity and pastoral care in all its activities, including its compliance with all relevant legislation, its treatment of its own staff, its stewardship of all its resources, and its involvement with the community. The only serious scholarly work on the London City Mission is Donald M. Lewis' Lighten Their Darkness: The Evangelical Mission to Working-Class London, 1828-1860 (Greenwood Press, 1985; reprinted by Paternoster, 2001). Lewis examines the significant role that the LCM played in broadening interdenominational cooperation among evangelicals in the nineteenth century, correcting the earlier view that this sort of cooperation only emerged much later in the century.

Auld played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Vancouver Canucks, Florida Panthers, Phoenix Coyotes, Boston Bruins, Ottawa Senators, Dallas Stars, New York Rangers and the Montreal Canadiens. He has also appeared internationally for Team Canada on three occasions: the 2001 World Junior Championships, the 2004 Spengler Cup, and the 2006 World Championships. Playing careerMinor= Auld played most of his minor hockey in his hometown of Thunder Bay, Ontario, with the Thunder Bay Kings program. He was a minor hockey teammate of future NHLers Taylor Pyatt, Patrick Sharp, Jason Jaspers and Aaron MacKenzie. Their Kings team won Gold in the All Ontario Bantam AAA championships in 1997 played in North Bay, Ontario. =Junior= Auld started junior career with the North Bay Centennials of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) at the tail end of the 1997‚Äì98 season, appearing in six games without registering a win. After appearing in 38 games the following season, Auld was selected in the second round, 40th overall, of the 1999 NHL Entry Draft by the Florida Panthers. He would finish out his junior career with the Centennials, spending two more seasons as their starting goaltender. In his final season, Auld was named to Team Canada for the 2001 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, where he backed up Maxime Ouellet. Later that same season, Auld was traded to the Vancouver Canucks for a third round pick in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft and a compensatory pick in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft. =Professional= Vancouver. Auld during his time with the Dallas Stars. Auld turned professional in the 2001‚Äì02 season, joining the Canucks' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Manitoba Moose. An ankle sprain sidelined Auld during training camp, however, and upon his return, he was assigned to the Columbia Inferno of the East Coast Hockey League. Solid play in six games at that level returned Auld to the AHL, where he showed steady improvement, despite competition for playing time from veterans Alfie Michaud and Martin Brochu.Manitoba Moose roster for 2001‚Äì02 Season Following injuries to Canucks goaltenders Dan Cloutier and Peter Skudra, Auld earned a start at the NHL level, a 4‚Äì2 victory over the Dallas Stars on January 23, 2002, after which he returned to the AHL. The 2002‚Äì03 season afforded Auld more opportunity for growth, although he again split playing time at the AHL level, this time with Tyler Moss. With Cloutier and Skudra entrenched at the NHL level, Auld still managed to appear in seven games as an injury replacement, and even played one Stanley Cup playoff game in relief. Most importantly, he received extensive playing time, and improved his statistics considerably. During the off-season, backup Peter Skudra signed with a Russian team, raising the possibility that Auld might claim the backup role for the Canucks. As the 2003‚Äì04 season approached, however, Canucks general manager Brian Burke traded a draft pick to the Pittsburgh Penguins for Johan Hedberg, all but ensuring Auld another season in the minors. Again, Auld began the season sharing netminding duties with Tyler Moss. Auld again saw brief NHL action, appearing in six games. However, during the 2004 Stanley Cup playoffs, Dan Cloutier was injured early on in the Canucks' first round series with the Calgary Flames. Hedberg, who had been shakyThe Sports Forecaster 2005‚Äì06, p. 101 as a backup, failed to impress head coach Marc Crawford in two appearances, and Auld claimed the starting role in Game 5, pushing Calgary the distance in the series, eventually losing in Game 7. Auld spent the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout back with the Manitoba Moose in the AHL, this time pairing with veteran netminder Wade Flaherty. Despite holding on to the starting role for much of the season, Auld disappointed in the playoffs, and Flaherty took over as starter, helping the team reach the third round of the Calder Cup playoffs. He also appeared for Canada at the Spengler Cup in December 2004, carrying the team to a third-place finish.Manitoba Moose press release Auld returned to the NHL when play resumed for the 2005‚Äì06 season, initially as the backup to Dan Cloutier. However, on November 20, 2005, Cloutier injured an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in a collision with Mighty Ducks of Anaheim forward Rob Niedermayer.Cloutier's injury history The hope initially was that the injury would heal during the season, but on December 15, Cloutier opted for surgery, leaving Auld as Vancouver's starting goaltender. He would not play in another game for the Moose, leaving the AHL team as its franchise leader in wins and shutouts. As the Canucks' starter, Auld was reunited with former World Junior teammate Maxime Ouellet, who was one of three goaltenders the Canucks used to back him up (Mika Noronen and Rob McVicar were the others). Filling in admirably, Auld went on to capture the Cyclone Taylor trophy as team MVP, although the Canucks would miss the playoffs. Auld then joined Team Canada again, this time at the 2006 World Championships, where Canada finished a disappointing fourth, losing the bronze medal game to Finland. In June 2006, Auld was involved in a multi-player trade that sent him, Todd Bertuzzi and Bryan Allen to Florida in exchange for Roberto Luongo, Luk√°≈° Kraj√≠ƒçek and a sixth-round draft pick. Initially, Auld was expected to be the undisputed starter in Florida. However, the July 25 signing of Ed Belfour introduced some competition, and Belfour eventually won the job as starting goalie. Controversially, in October, Auld was hospitalized while \\"horsing around\\" with Belfour, with suspicions that Belfour had assaulted him. Senators in 2011. After an unsuccessful season with Florida, Auld signed a one-year contract with the Phoenix Coyotes on August 13, 2007. However, on a team with already with a wealth of goaltenders ‚Äî Auld would compete for a job with David Aebischer and Mikael Tellqvist at the beginning of the season ‚Äî Phoenix would pick up Ilya Bryzgalov off waivers from the Anaheim Ducks, leaving Auld as one of the odd goaltenders out. After nine appearances with Phoenix, on December 6, 2007, Auld was traded to the Boston Bruins for right winger Nate DiCasmirro and the Bruins' fifth-round pick in 2009. Playing backup to Tim Thomas for the majority of 2007‚Äì08, Auld would post the best statistics of his career (excluding his first few seasons with the Canucks, in which he appeared in no more than seven games in a season) with a personal-best two shutouts. On July 1, 2008, Auld signed a two-year, $2 million deal with the Ottawa Senators as an unrestricted free agent. He came within one second of recording a shutout in his Senators debut against the Pittsburgh Penguins in Stockholm, Sweden, surrendering a powerplay goal in the final moments of the game. Though Senators' management expected him to serve primarily as a backup to Martin Gerber, Auld's strong play combined with Gerber's struggles resulted in Auld assuming the starting position early in the season. As the season progressed, Gerber was placed on waivers and ultimately was claimed by the Toronto Maple Leafs, while rookie Brian Elliott would split the goaltending duties with Auld in Ottawa. He was expected to challenge for the starting position in 2009‚Äì10 with Pascal Leclaire, acquired by Ottawa from the Columbus Blue Jackets late at the 2008‚Äì09 trade deadline, but was traded in the off-season on July 8, 2009, to the Dallas Stars in exchange for a sixth-round draft pick in 2010. On February 27, 2010 Auld was claimed off of re-entry waivers by the New York Rangers. On July 1, 2010, he signed a one-year, $1 million contract with the Montreal Canadiens. On July 1, 2011, Auld re-joined the Ottawa Senators, signing a one-year, $1 million contract. On July 23, 2012, Auld left the NHL and signed as a free agent with Austrian club Red Bull Salzburg of the Austrian Hockey League (EBEL). He would retire after playing one season. International play Auld first played for Team Canada at the junior level in the 2001 World Junior Championships helping claim the Bronze medal. He made a senior competitive debut with Team Canada at the Swiss-based 2004 Spengler Cup, finishing in 3rd place. He made his full IIHF debut for Canada at the 2006 World Championships, losing the Bronze medal game to place fourth. Personal life Auld was born in Cold Lake, Alberta, when his father was stationed out of CFB Cold Lake; however, he spent the majority of his adolescence in Thunder Bay, Ontario. Auld's wife is celebrity handbag and jewellery designer Melanie Auld. The couple's first child, a son, Sam Alexander Auld, was born on January 5, 2008 in Boston, Massachusetts. Melanie gave birth to the couple's second child, a daughter, Ella Grace Auld was born on July 26, 2011 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The couple splits their time between Vancouver and Thunder Bay.

According to NHL rules, the Bruins (as a team) and Auld (individually) received credit for a shutout. Auld thus became the first Boston Bruin goaltender to record a shutout in a game which his team lost.

It is divided between the municipalities of ƒåukarica, Rakovica and Savski Venac. Being close to downtown, it is one of the major locations for relaxation, picnics and fresh air for the citizens of Belgrade. As a result of the 1923 Belgrade's general plan, where one of the main projects regarding the green areas was forestation of the area between Topƒçider and the city, a continuous green area Senjak-Topƒçidersko Brdo-Hajd Park-Topƒçider-Ko≈°utnjak was formed by the 1930s. This continuous forested area makes the largest \\"green massif\\" in the immediate vicinity of Belgrade's urban tissue. Nobelist author Ivo Andriƒá wrote: \\"You just hang on to Topƒçider and Ko≈°utnjak...Topƒçider is my favorite place, where I ate bread and drank wine in the sweetest and calmest manner\\". Location 250px Geographically, Topƒçider covers a much larger area than what people generally refer to as Topƒçider today. The eastern slopes of Topƒçidersko Brdo (\\"Topƒçider Hill\\") begin already at the Mostarska Petlja and the highway. The neighborhood of Senjak is located on the western, and Dedinje on the right side. This is where the street of Topƒçiderski Venac and the roundabout of Topƒçiderska zvezda (\\"Topƒçider star\\") are located. The southern slopes of the hill extends into the valley of the Topƒçiderska reka, a tributary to the Sava river, which has been channeled in this section. This is the area identified with the term Topƒçider. Topƒçider Park begins five kilometers south of downtown Belgrade and extends west, east and south into the old Topƒçider woods which itself extend west into the park- wood of Ko≈°utnjak. In the upper parts, Ko≈°utnjak and Topƒçider forests grow together, while in the lower parts they are divided by the Topƒçiderska reka and a railway passing through the river valley (both Ko≈°utnjak and Topƒçider have their own, separate train stations). In the extreme north-west Topƒçider extends into the neighborhood of Careva ƒÜuprija and in the south-east into Lisiƒçji Potok. It also borders the neighborhood of Kanarevo Brdo in this section. History Pre-19th century = Topƒçider is mentioned for the first time in the 17th century travelogue of the Ottoman explorer and traveler Evliya √áelebi. In Ottoman records, the village of Muminovac was also mentioned in the Topƒçider valley. During Ottoman times, the valley of Topƒçiderska reka and the Topƒçider wood were locations where the Turkish artillery was positioned, intended to defend Belgrade, being distant from the town itself at the time (thus many military barracks to defend the city from later periods, but the town later sprawled tens of kilometers further). This is how the area got its name as in Turkish it means \\"artillery men's valley\\" (top, cannon; top√ßu, artillery man; dere, valley), though it is usually erroneously thought to mean simply the cannon valley. = 19th century = Milo≈°ev konak, built from 1831 to 1833 Prince Milo≈° specifically chose this location. After Serbia gained autonomy, the Ottomans withdrew to the walled cities. As the range of the cannons from the Belgrade Fortress couldn't reach across the Topƒçiderska reka, the prince selected this area for his future royal compound. The history of the park itself begins in 1830 when the Prince of Serbia Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá started building his personal quarters in the swampy terrain of the Topƒçider, today one of the major attractions in Belgrade, the famous Milo≈°ev konak.https://www.telegraf.rs/vesti/beograd/2937390-s-kojim-se-predznanjem- ide-na-topcider-i-kosutnjak-o-stvarnom-znacenju-ovih-naziva-i-o-javnim- tajnama-koje-cuvaju-foto A stone Topƒçider church, dedicated to the apostles Peter and Paul, church inn and military complex were also constructed in the 1832-1834 period, so as the various barracks, magazines, ice rooms, meyhane and a guard tower on top of the Topƒçidersko Brdo. There was a wooden pavilion, which served as part of the Russian military hospital during the 1876 Serbian- Ottoman War. Hundreds of workers were employed. At one point, 144 tajfe, or bands of construction workers, were employed. Prince Milo≈° paid them heftily, gave them certain privileges, but they had no working hours, and had to work until the job is done. Planting of the surrounding park began at the same time and marked the beginning of the planned green areas in Belgrade as the ensuing park was the first park area in the city. The park was patterned after the English parks. The supervisor of the park's construction was Atanasije Nikoliƒá, engineer, urbanist and professor at the Belgrade Lyceum, who also arranged the nursery garden, Ko≈°utnjak Park and avenues along city's main streets and squares (Terazije, Kneza Milo≈°a Street, modern Bulevar Kneza Aleksandra Karaƒëorƒëeviƒáa), with the seedlings which originated from the Topƒçoder nursery. In 1839, Belgrade merchant Joca ƒê. Jovanoviƒá applied for permit to build the first brewery in town. He wanted to build it in Topƒçider, but the permit was denied. On 24 May 1860, privately owned predecessor of the public transport in Belgrade was organized. The omnibus line was operated by the diligences. Its starting point was at the kafana \\"Kod Zlatnog Venca\\" in Terazije, while the line ended in Topƒçider. Apparently, it wasn't a lucrative business move so the owner Luka Jakovljeviƒá sold it in 1861 to Milan Te≈°iƒá, who expanded the line from Terazije to Varo≈° Kapija and lifted the price to 3 groschen. The importance which Topƒçider gained for the city population can be seen from the fact that in 1884 it got its own railway station even though it was a small settlement at the time and also one of the first tram lines in Belgrade used to connect Terazije and Topƒçider, through the Kneza Milo≈°a street. Starting in downtown, at Prince Mihailo Monument, the tram was allocated the number 3, which it still bears today, though its route is today extended to the neighborhood of Kne≈æevac. = 20th century = The 1923 Belgrade's general plan envisioned forestation of Topƒçidersko Brdo and Senjak, formation of the new park and establishment of the continuous green area with the Topƒçider. Project started in 1926 while the Hyde Park was finished in the 1930s. International tender which was supposed to reconstruct Topƒçider by the standards of the then modern urbanism was halted by World War II. When Serbia began using paper money, the banknotes were printed in France until 1929, when the Banknotes printing office was built in Topƒçider, close to the railway station. However, the coins were minted on another location, in the privately owned company \\"The brothers Bo≈°koviƒá mint\\" in the nearby street, today named Bulevar vojvode Mi≈°iƒáa. In the mid-1930s a big affair broke out, concerning the counterfeiting of the coins of 50 dinars, so the Banknotes printing office also took over that job. It was always colloquially called the \\"Mint\\". After the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá royal family moved in the new Royal Compound in Dedinje in the 1930s, a modern military barracks were built in Topƒçider, as a headquarters of the royal guard. Additional military objects were also built, including the military farm. Park was partially adapted, with gazebos, bridges, etc. Railway station became the \\"royal station\\", while after World War II it became the home station of the Josip Broz Tito's famed Blue Train. After 1945 city urbanists considered that the way the Topƒçider-Ko≈°utnjak complex had been handled was wrong, especially the expansion of the railway station into the marshalling yard and the construction of Filmski Grad, so Belgrade's General Urbanistic Plan (GUP) in the 1950s projected the complete removal of the railway objects from the Topƒçider valley, but this was never implemented. In the summer of 1948 a swimming pool was built in the military complex of the Guard. Though within the army complex, it was a public swimming pool, one of only few such venues in Belgrade at the time. = 21st century = In the early 2016, a gradual moving of trains from the Belgrade Main railway station to the new Belgrade Centre railway station, colloquially called Prokop station began. In December 2017, all but two national trains were dislocated to \\"Belgrade Center\\".–†–¢–°: \\"–ü—Ä–æ–∫–æ–ø –æ–¥ –¥–∞–Ω–∞—Å –≥–ª–∞–≤–Ω–∞ –∂–µ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–∏—á–∫–∞ —Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∞\\", rts.rs; accessed 23 April 2018. However, problems arose immediately. The Prokop is still not finished, has no station building nor proper access roads and public transportation connections with the rest of the city. Additionally, it has no facilities for loading and unloading cars from the auto trains nor was ever planned to have one. Still, in January 2018 it was announced that the station will be completely closed for traffic on 1 July 2018, even though none of the projects needed for a complete removal of the railway traffic are finished. The Prokop is incomplete, a projected main freight station in Zemun is not being adapted at all while there is even no project on a Belgrade railway beltway so a series of temporary solutions will have to be applied. One is a defunct and deteriorated Topƒçider station, which will be revitalized and adapted for auto trains until the goods station Zemun is finished. Topƒçider station has one major flaw, a bad public transportation connection (only one tram line, No. 3), so the state railway company asked officially for this problem to be solved. A deadline for the Zemun station is 2 years, but the work is not scheduled to begin until the end of 2018. As of July 2019 no construction began.  Administration  By 1883, Topƒçider had a population of 767, and though part of Belgrade, it wasn't organized as a quarter of the city, like the central urban area.Belgrade by the 1883 census According to the censuses, the population was 1,675 in 1890, 2,815 in 1895, 2,818 in 1900, 3,534 in 1905 and 3,510 in 1910. After the liberation in World War I in 1918, Topƒçider came under Belgrade's administrative rule. It was organized as a Topƒçider-Senjak section of Belgrade, which had a population of 8,476 in 1921. In the second half of the 20th century, the part which was within the Savski Venac municipality was organized as a local community (mesna zajednica), a sub-municipal administrative unit. It was named Topƒçidersko Brdo and had a population of 5,333 in 1981. It was then merged with Senjak again in the Topƒçidersko Brdo-Senjak local community which had a population of 7,757 in 1991, 7,249 in 2002 and 6,344 in 2011.  Wildlife  Plants = Tree planting began immediately after the konak construction in the 1830s. In the 19th century it was the first nursery garden in Serbia,. Most abundant species are platanus, black pine, spruce and field maple. The Topƒçider London Planes (Platanus √ó acerifolia) are today among the oldest ones in Europe. The biggest and oldest specimen was high in 2008, with the diameter of the deck being , while the shade of its crown covers an area of . Some sources claim it was planted in 1834 when prince Milo≈° ordered for a seedling to be planted in the lime kiln in front of the konak. Other, more reliable sources say the tree was planted in 1868, when 250 seedlings of Platanus were bought in Vienna, Austro- Hungary, for which a receipt still exist today. In 2015 it measured in height and was estimated to be 160 years old, while the crown has grown to and is now supported by the 17 metal piles. The tree is declared a natural monument. Even older is the almost 180-year-old pear tree, nicknamed Kru≈°ka topƒçiderka (\\"Pear of Topƒçider\\") According to popular legend, it was planted by prince Milo≈° a few years after the konak was finished. He wanted to redeem himself to his wife princess Ljubica because of his frequent infidelities and in front of the pear seedling swore his loyalty to her. It still bears fruits, so attempts are being made to produce its seedling in the greenhouse. The pear is surrounded by five pedunculate oaks, all of which are over 100 years old. Special feature in the park is the group of 8 swamp cypresses. In 2015, most of the trees in Topƒçider were 20 to 70 years old, but a significant number of trees was over 100 years old or from the 19th century. = Animals = Topƒçider is home to 26 species of dragonflies, 48 species of orthoptera and 153 species of beetles. Birds include collared dove, white wagtail, common blackbird, typical warbler, grey heron and great spotted woodpecker. Mammals present in the park, among others, are squirrels, moles, hedgehogs, voles and bats.  Monuments and other features  The largest London Plane Obelisk Topƒçider was the first public park outside the central city area. Today, the total area of Topƒçider is , out of which is covered by the park. The entire Ko≈°utnjak-Topƒçider forest complex covers an area of . Many other monuments are centered on the konak: the binjekta≈° stone (\\"hopping stone\\") which prince Milo≈° used to jump on a horse, the Museum of the First Serbian Uprising (in the konak itself), three public drinking fountains with an additional fourth one with lion's heads which was temporarily moved to Topƒçider in 1911, but restored in 1976 and returned to its original location in Terazije, and the stone obelisk erected in 1859, one of the first public monuments in Belgrade. A bronze monument to the Swiss doctor and philanthropist Archibald Reiss (by Marko Bre≈æanin) was erected in 1931. The northern section of Topƒçider is the location of the Topƒçider cemetery (with the Orthodox church of Saint Trifun) and the Banknotes printing office (Zavod za izradu novƒçanica), that is, the mint of the National Bank of Serbia. In the western section, bordering with Dedinje is Beli Dvor, a court of the Serbian former royal dynasty Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá and the present residence of the pretender Aleksandar Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá and his family. Northwest section of the Topƒçider is declared a geological natural monument of \\"Senonian ridge of Ma≈°in Majdan\\". The location is an archaeological excavation site as the fossils of the Mesozoic fish have been found in the sediment layers from the Late Cretaceous. It was named Ma≈°in majdan (\\"Ma≈°a's quarry\\"), after a quarry owned by Mrs. Ma≈°a Dimiƒá who lived in the house above the quarry. It was operational until the 1920s and the stone from the quarry was used for the villas on Topƒçider and Dedinje, but also for the construction of the nearby railroad. On the location of the former quarry, the Topƒçider summer stage was built in 1947. It had 1,800 seats and an excellent acoustics, being embedded into the limestone rocks. A project of Rajko Tatiƒá, despite occasional public actions for its restoration (1999, 2009), by the 2010s the facility was abandoned and deteriorated.  Protection  The Great Platanus, in front of the konak, was protected as the natural monument in 2001. As the city government declared the entire Topƒçider Park a natural monument on 23 June 2015, specific protection for the Platanus ceased. In the area of the residential Obrenoviƒá dynasty complex, there are six objects which are protected as the cultural monuments: Residence of Prince Milo≈°, Topƒçider Church, Church Inn, Obelisk, monument to Archibald Reiss and the \\"Woman harvester\\" monument.  Controversies  Topƒçider Tunnel = There are threats of destroying certain parts of the park because the government is planning to build a tunnel in this area which will connect Autokomanda with this part of the city and hopefully solve many car traffic problems in Belgrade. Some environmental groups protested against this project, but the constructing of this tunnel still hasn't progressed further than the idea stage. During the summer of 2007, a general planning idea will be chosen by a tender held by the city government, and it remains to be seen if this plan will contain a solution for park preservation. Ada Bridge, which is part of the same project (Inner ring road) was built and opened on 1 January 2012, but the construction of the tunnel under Senjak, which should free Topƒçider from heavy traffic, was postponed due to the heavy costs. In the early 2018, city administration announced that the detailed regulatory plan and the conceptual design are finished, while the invitation to tender for the project was set for later in 2018. The tunnel would start at the large Radniƒçka interchange, at the beginning of the bridge. That way, it would practically make an extension of the Po≈æe≈°ka Street, the main street and commercial area of the neighborhoods of ƒåukarica and Banovo Brdo. The tunnel would then exit at Partizan Stadium, on the other side of Topƒçidersko Brdo, above the Autokomanda. The tunnel will allow for the drivers to circumvent the downtown and to allow faster transit. It is planned as part of Belgrade's . = Lisiƒçji Potok = The easternmost section of Topƒçider is a heavily wooded area, so the expansion of the neighborhood of Lisiƒçji Potok was limited. In the early 2000s, due to the political changes which caused a vacuum in all levels of government, private entrepreneurs without gaining regular permits cut down over 1,000 trees in the Topƒçider woods for the purpose of constructing vast apartment complexes. = Topƒçider incident = The vast secret military complex of \\"Kara≈°\\" (in Teodora Drajzera street) was built and dug into the hill from 1965 to 1980, with numerous barracks and kilometers of underground passages. In October 2004, two young guards, Dragan Jakovljeviƒá and Dra≈æen Milovanoviƒá, were found shot dead under highly mysterious circumstances. The first official army report stated that the two guards got into a fight; one got shot, and the other one committed suicide. The investigation was so obviously sloppy (videos were made public of investigators walking all over the non-secured crime scene, not using any precaution measures or security protocols, etc.) to the point of absurdity, including the notorious statement of then military prosecutor Vuk Tufegd≈æiƒá who stated that no DNA tests were done because DNA is an \\"overrated thing\\" and that \\"people watch TV too much\\". Because of the serious rumours and intense public pressure, a more thorough investigation was initiated, this time headed by Bo≈æo Preleviƒá, former interior minister of Serbia. His commission concluded that the two soldiers were shot by a third party but the exact situation has never been clarified, except that the commission reject almost all findings of the first, internal military investigation. Not having any solid evidence or conclusions, it is widely suggested by the press that the two guards were the witnesses of either a high-profile indictee (as it was suggested at the time, Ratko Mladiƒá) of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, who was supposedly hiding in the undergrounds of the Topƒçider complex, or some criminal activities, like smuggling.

Background  Under the closed-source model source code is not released to the public. Closed-source software is maintained by a team who produces their product in a compiled-executable state, which is what the market is allowed access to. Microsoft, the owner and developer of Windows and Microsoft Office, along with other major software companies, have long been proponents of this business model, although in August 2010, Microsoft interoperability general manager Jean Paoli said Microsoft \\"loves open source\\" and its anti-open-source position was a mistake.Microsoft: 'We Love Open Source' The FOSS model allows for able users to view and modify a product's source code, but most of such code is not in the public domain. Common advantages cited by proponents for having such a structure are expressed in terms of trust, acceptance, teamwork and quality.The GNU Manifesto ‚Äì GNU Project ‚Äì Free Software Foundation (FSF) A non-free license is used to limit what free software movement advocates consider to be the essential freedoms. A license, whether providing open- source code or not, that does not stipulate the \\"four software freedoms\\",The Free Software Definition ‚Äì GNU Project ‚Äì Free Software Foundation (FSF) are not considered \\"free\\" by the free software movement. A closed source license is one that limits only the availability of the source code. By contrast a copyleft license claims to protect the \\"four software freedoms\\" by explicitly granting them and then explicitly prohibiting anyone to redistribute the package or reuse the code in it to make derivative works without including the same licensing clauses. Some licenses grant the four software freedoms but allow redistributors to remove them if they wish. Such licenses are sometimes called permissive software licenses.Various Licenses and Comments about Them ‚Äì GNU Project ‚Äì Free Software Foundation (FSF) An example of such a license is the FreeBSD License which allows derivative software to be distributed as non- free or closed source, as long as they give credit to the original designers. A misconception that is often made by both proponents and detractors of FOSS is that it cannot be capitalized. FOSS can and has been commercialized by companies such as Red Hat, Canonical, Mozilla, Google, IBM, Novell, Sun/Oracle, VMware and others.  Commercialization  Closed-source software= The primary business model for closed-source software involves the use of constraints on what can be done with the software and the restriction of access to the original source code. This can result in a form of imposed artificial scarcity on a product that is otherwise very easy to copy and redistribute. The end result is that an end-user is not actually purchasing software, but purchasing the right to use the software. To this end, the source code to closed-source software is considered a trade secret by its manufacturers. = FOSS = FOSS methods, on the other hand, typically do not limit the use of software in this fashion. Instead, the revenue model is based mainly on support services. Red Hat Inc. and Canonical Ltd. are such companies that give its software away freely, but charge for support services. The source code of the software is usually given away, and pre-compiled binary software frequently accompanies it for convenience. As a result, the source code can be freely modified. However, there can be some license-based restrictions on re-distributing the software. Generally, software can be modified and re-distributed for free, as long as credit is given to the original manufacturer of the software. In addition, FOSS can generally be sold commercially, as long as the source-code is provided. There are a wide variety of free software licenses that define how a program can be used, modified, and sold commercially (see GPL, LGPL, and BSD-type licenses). FOSS may also be funded through donations. A software philosophy that combines aspects of FOSS and proprietary software is open core software, or commercial open source software. Despite having received criticism from some proponents of FOSS, it has exhibited marginal success. Examples of open core software include MySQL and VirtualBox. The MINIX operating system used to follow this business model, but came under the full terms of the BSD license after the year 2000. = Handling competition = This model has proved somewhat successful, as witnessed in the Linux community. There are numerous GNU/Linux distributions available, but a great many of them are simply modified versions of some previous version. For example, Fedora Linux, Mandriva Linux, and PCLinuxOS are all derivatives of an earlier product, Red Hat Linux. In fact, Red Hat Enterprise Linux is itself a derivative of Fedora Linux. This is an example of one vendor creating a product, allowing a third-party to modify the software, and then creating a tertiary product based on the modified version. All of the products listed above are currently produced by software service companies. Operating systems built on the Linux kernel are available for a wider range of processor architectures than Microsoft Windows, including PowerPC and SPARC. None of these can match the sheer popularity of the x86 architecture, nevertheless they do have significant numbers of users; Windows remains unavailable for these alternative architectures, although there have been such ports of it in the past. The most obvious complaint against FOSS revolves around the fact that making money through some traditional methods, such as the sale of the use of individual copies and patent royalty payments, is much more difficult and sometimes impractical with FOSS. Moreover, FOSS has been considered damaging to the commercial software market, evidenced in documents released as part of the Microsoft Halloween documents leak.\\"[...] the documents show that while Microsoft may be dismissive of open-source software in public, it considers it a serious competitor in private.\\" ‚Äì quote from the \\"Documents_I_and_II\\" subsection of Microsoft Halloween documents leak articleThe \\"Halloween VI\\" document appears to give convincing evidence that Microsoft had their reasons for trying to argue against the popularity of GNU/Linux and other Free and open-source software.Bill Gates, in his reply after the public response to his own 1976 Open letter to hobbyists, said \\"Unfortunately, some of the companies I have talked to about microcomputer software are reluctant to have it distributed to the hobbyist, some of whom will steal it, when [...]\\". The cost of making a copy of a software program is essentially zero, so per-use fees are perhaps unreasonable for open-source software. At one time, open-source software development was almost entirely volunteer-driven, and although this is true for many small projects, many alternative funding streams have been identified and employed for FOSS: * Give away the program and charge for installation and support (used by many Linux distributions). * \\"Commoditize complements\\": make a product cheaper or free so that people are more likely to purchase a related product or service you do sell. * Cost avoidance / cost sharing: many developers need a product, so it makes sense to share development costs (this is the genesis of the X Window System and the Apache web server). * Donations * Crowd funding Increasingly, FOSS is developed by commercial organizations. In 2004, Andrew Morton noted that 37,000 of the 38,000 recent patches in the Linux kernel were created by developers directly paid to develop the Linux kernel. Many projects, such as the X Window System and Apache, have had commercial development as a primary source of improvements since their inception. This trend has accelerated over time. There are some who counter that the commercialization of FOSS is a poorly devised business model because commercial FOSS companies answer to parties with opposite agendas. On one hand commercial FOSS companies answer to volunteers developers, who are difficult to keep on a schedule, and on the other hand they answer to shareholders, who are expecting a return on their investment. Often FOSS development is not on a schedule and therefore it may have an adverse effect on a commercial FOSS company releasing software on time.Integrating Open Source in Commercial Solutions  Innovation  Gary Hamel counters this claim by saying that quantifying who or what is innovative is impossible.http://opensource.com/business/11/2/whos-really-innovative The implementation of compatible FOSS replacements for proprietary software is encouraged by the Free Software Foundation to make it possible for their users to use FOSS instead of proprietary software, for example they have listed GNU Octave, an API-compatible replacement for MATLAB, as one of their high priority projects. In the past this list contained free binary compatible Java and CLI implementations, like GNU Classpath and DotGNU. Thus even \\"derivative\\" developments are important in the opinion of many people from FOSS. However, there is no quantitative analysis, if FOSS is less innovative than proprietary software, since there are derivative/re-implementing proprietary developments, too. Some of the largest well-known FOSS projects are either legacy code (e.g., FreeBSD or Apache) developed a long time ago independently of the free software movement, or by companies like Netscape (which open-sourced its code with the hope that they could compete better), or by companies like MySQL which use FOSS to lure customers for its more expensive licensed product. However, it is notable that most of these projects have seen major or even complete rewrites (in the case of the Mozilla and Apache 2 code, for example) and do not contain much of the original code. Innovations have come, and continue to come, from the open-source world: * Perl, the pioneering open- source scripting language, made popular many features, like regular expressions and associative arrays, that were unusual at the time. The newer Python language continues this innovation, with features like functional constructs and class-dictionary unification. * dcraw is an open-source tool for decoding RAW-format images from a variety of digital cameras, which can produce better images than the closed-source tools provided by the camera vendors themselves. * A number of laptop models are available with a particular emphasis on multimedia capabilities. While these invariably come preinstalled with a copy of Microsoft Windows, some of themPC World ‚Äì Acer Readies New Notebook, Tablet PC also offer an alternative \\"fast-boot\\" mode (such as Phoenix HyperSpace) based on GNU/Linux. This gets around the long time it can take to boot up Windows. * VLC media player, Songbird, and Amarok are FOSS music players that integrate internet-based data sources to an unprecedented degree, taking song information from MusicBrainz, related track information from last.fm, album cover art from amazon.com and displaying an artist's Wikipedia page within the player. * While admittedly inspired by Mac OS X's Quartz graphics layer, Compiz Fusion has pioneered the concept of \\"plug in\\" window decorators and animation effects. Users can develop their own creative and unique effects. * Open-source telecommunication products, such as the Asterisk PBX, have revolutionized the ICT industry. * There are substantial efforts towards the implementation of a semantic desktop in FOSS communities. * Today's desktop environments are innovating regarding their unique idea of a Social Desktop. * Many academic research projects release their results as FOSS. = Code quality = An analysis of the code of the FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, and Windows operating system kernels looked for differences between code developed using open-source properties (the first two kernels) and proprietary code (the other two kernels). The study collected metrics in the areas of file organization, code structure, code style, the use of the C preprocessor, and data organization. The aggregate results indicate that across various areas and many different metrics, four systems developed using open- and closed-source development processes score comparably. The study mentioned above is refuted by a study conducted by Coverity, Inc finding open source code to be of better quality. = Security = A study done on seventeen open-source and closed-source software showed that the number of vulnerabilities existing in a piece of software is not affected by the source availability model that it uses. The study used a very simple metrics of comparing the number of vulnerabilities between the open-source and closed- source software. Another study was also done by a group of professors in Northern Kentucky University on fourteen open-source web applications written in PHP. The study measured the vulnerability density in the web applications and shown that some of them had increased vulnerability density, but some of them also had decreased vulnerability density. Business models In its 2008 Annual Report, Microsoft stated that FOSS business models challenge its license-based software model and that the firms who use these business models do not bear the cost for their software development.

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Rakovica.  Location  Kijevo is located between the southwestern slopes of the Stra≈æevica hill on the east, and the southeastern slopes of the Petlovo Brdo on the west. The neighborhood is situated in the central part of the municipality, on the mouth of the stream of Kijevski Potok into the Topƒçiderka river. It is bordered by the neighborhoods of Petlovo Brdo on the west, Labudovo Brdo and Kne≈æevac on the north and Resnik on the southeast. The neighborhood Sunƒçani Breg is located east of the Stra≈æevica hill and the quarry. Area south of Kijevo, the \\"Klik\\"' and \\"≈†abinac\\" meadows, is still not urbanized. The neighborhood is situated in the valley of the Topƒçiderka, south of downtown Belgrade, near the crossroad of the Ibar highway and the Kru≈æni put, and the future, parallel, Belgrade beltway.  Geography  Originally, the area was suitable for tourism and was well known as an excursion location. The flowery meadows surrounded both the Kijevski Potok and Topƒçiderka, which in turn were bordered by the oak forests and agricultural fields. Later, the artificial Lake Kijevo was formed in the valley. However, by the 1960s all that disappeared. The settlement became more populous, the highway and the tunnel were built and the area was fully urbanized. The lake was drained, the forests were cut and the meadows and fields transformed in time into the marshland. The Stra≈æevica slopes are made of rich deposits of sandy-detrital silicified limestone, which are even today exploited in the Kijevo Quarry, which was originally open to supply the railroad company, but also became the main stone source for Belgrade. = Lake Kijevo = Lake Kijevo is a former artificial lake which existed for 46 years. Kijevski Potok, which originates under the hillock of Maƒçkov kamen, between Kne≈æevac and Ru≈°anj, cut through the Kijevo valley and often flooded it. In order to prevent damage by floodings to his factory, Stefanoviƒá built a sluice in 1901, forming the Lake Kijevo. Soon, the lake, surrounded by the thick forest, became an excursion site for the wealthier Belgraders. As Kijevo has its own railway station, a special excursion trains connected it to downtown Belgrade. There was an ada, small island in the lake which visitors could reached only by boats. Custom of the day was for the ladies to be brought to the island by boat and then to have a Turkish coffee served there. As the lake became more and more popular, Stefanoviƒá built a hotel with the ballroom. Visitors included Serbian king Peter I, writer Branislav Nu≈°iƒá and painter Nade≈æda Petroviƒá. It has been recorded that the lake was visited by Albert Einstein, his wife Mileva and their son Hans. During his 1905 visit to the botanist Nedeljko Ko≈°anin, chief of the Belgrade's botanical garden Jevremovac, the Einsteins were driving the boat and swam in the lake. In 1937-38 Stefanoviƒá's nephew, who inherited the business, parceled the remaining land into lots with the view on ada and sold them for the construction of the family houses. After the unusually rainy spring in 1941, the sluice gate was lifted for the sludge to be washed away. The gates were later stolen and the lake began to recede. New authorities tried to clean an dredge the bottom of the valley, but ultimately gave up and the lake completely drained through the Kijevski Potok into the Topƒçiderka by 1947. New government, aside from confiscating all their assets, declared the Stefanoviƒá's nephew and his brother public enemies. Immediately after the war, one of the brothers fell under the train in dubious circumstances (he was in the company of the representatives of the new government) and the other emigrated to the United States. When the construction of the neighborhood of Kanarevo Brdo began in the 1960s, the earth which was dug was used to fill the former lake. The area was then flattened and turned into the football court for the local club \\"FK Kijevo\\". The club was disbanded in 2000, and the court was left unattended. By 2015 it was completely overgrown by the vegetation and the football facilities deteriorated, while the stream became an open sewage canal. The only remaining property of the Stefanoviƒá family economic complex is one low, abandoned building full of rubbish, at the edge of the former court.  History  Origin = Until the early 20th century, Kijevo was an uninhabited section of the Rakovica's rural area. Svetozar Stefanoviƒá, industrialist who founded the first canning factory in Serbia, in Kragujevac, moved to Belgrade and bought the land at the mouth of the Kijevski Potok into the Topƒçiderka and planted fruits and vegetables, including the large fruit plantation on the slopes of the west bank of Kijevski Potok. Later, in 1901 he also transferred his factory from Kragujevac to Kijevo. The factory was nationalized after the World War II by the new Communist authorities, renamed to \\"Prvi Maj\\" and moved to ƒåukarica in the late 1950s. The factory was predecessor of the modern canning factory FMP. After the Lake Kijevo was created in 1901, lots around the lake were settled by the wealthy Belgrade citizens who build villas around the lake. Among the first was Mo≈°a Avram \\"Maca\\", proprietor of the first umbrella factory in Belgrade. His villa was later adapted into the first Kijevo elementary school and after the World War II became the seat of local branch of OZNA (Yugoslav security agency) for a while. The building was demolished in the 1960s. Apart from Stefanoviƒá, fast industrial development of Kijevo included the entrepreneurs Parapid, Tomiƒá and Markoviƒá who founded the quarry, while a major landowner of the time, Foteliƒá, owned a large land complex on the southern and southeastern slopes of Petlovo Brdo. There were numerous smaller landowners, mostly peasant families from Kne≈æevac, but also from Resnik and nearby Ru≈°anj. As the peasants in time became highly in debt, especially during the Great Depression, the land in Kijevo was acquired by the Mortgage bank in 1931-1932. The confiscated land on the eastern and southern slopes of Petlovo Brdo, in the alluvial valleys of both rivers, was parceled and sold to the employees of the railroad company. This is when Kijevo began to fully develop as a settlement. = After World War II = Until 1941, some 200 people settled in Kijevo, with additional 80 who refuged during the World War II. After the war, a huge number of rural population moved to Belgrade, especially from the war thorn and poor regions, but also because of the deficit of the workforce in the city. Many worked in Kijevo because of the railroad and tunnel construction, so the temporary barracks for the workers and their families were placed all over the Belgrade suburbia, including Kijevo. Some of them still stand. The 1950 Belgrade general plan (GUP) envisioned the entire area stretching from the Zmajevac Hill, below Miljakovac, over Kne≈æevac, to Kijevo, as the green, un-urbanized, excursion area. Next wave of settlement in Kijevo began in 1953, coinciding with the massive shift of the local agricultural population which was settling in Belgrade. As Kijevo was at the time designated as the green area, and the building was restricted, the unplanned construction flourished. As there was a major shortage of apartments in the city, the settlers were buying the lots in Kijevo and built their own houses. In 1953-1960 period, 800 people moved into the settlement. Next phase of the development started in 1962, this time under the administration of the ƒåukarica municipality to which Kijevo belonged at the time after being abolished as a separate settlement in 1959 and annexed to the village of Kne≈æevac, which in turn lost its municipality and became part of ƒåukarica. As the municipality issued the building permits, the settlement spread from the originally drier sections of the lower and eastern slopes. The individual houses were now built, almost on top of Petlovo Brdo and on the left slopes of the Duboki Potok. In 1961-1965 period, 700 new inhabitants settled in Kijevo. = Modern development = Petlovo Brdo, developed as the new section of Kijevo, today is a separate local community In 1965 the municipality handed over the area to the development agency, and the planned growths began. This marked the end of the individual construction and the building of the high rise began. In the 1966-1969 period, 2,500 people settled in Kijevo. Such a strong and fast development, despite being planned, had its setbacks, especially concerning the lack of compatibility with the rational building of the settlement which raised the price of both the construction and the communal grid. The construction continued without fixing the problems but the new settlement was partially harmonized with the 1972 GUP of Belgrade. This new GUP abandoned the 1950 GUP project of green areas on this location, switching to urban construction instead. The GUP envisioned the urban joining of Kne≈æevac-Kijevo and ≈Ωeleznik, along the Kru≈æni put road, creating a secondary center of Belgrade. The planned suburban city was to have 35,000 workers and 100,000 inhabitants, on an area of . The city was to have numerous business buildings, department stores, hotels, educational facilities, scientific venues and medical institutes. The project wasn't carried through and the two neighborhoods remained disconnected, though they both independently formed one urban unit with Belgrade in time and in 1972 were abolished as separate settlements and annexed to Belgrade as its neighborhoods. In 1970-1971, 4,500 people moved into the Kne≈æevac-Kijevo neighborhood. According to the 1971 census, Kne≈æevac, still a separate settlement, had a population of 13,022, but 8,823 belonged to the Kijevo- Petlovo Brdo section, making Kijevo twice larger than Kne≈æevac itself. Only 19% of the population was autochthonous. The migrations were almost stopped after that and the informal settlements were resettled, so already in 1972 a population began to decline. The population was resettled into the neighboring settlements and villages of Miljakovac, Resnik, Ru≈°anj, Pelovo Brdo and Sremƒçica. By this time, the settlement was fully urbanized and not a single family was solely agricultural, though some small fields were still cultivated. In time, the new section with high rise buildings differentiated itself as a separate neighborhood of Petlovo Brdo so today the name Kijevo applies only to the old part of the neighborhood.  Administration  Kijevo was a separate village until 1959 when it was incorporated into Kne≈æevac, which in turn was incorporated into Belgrade in 1972. Kijevo is today organized as \\"local community\\", a sub-municipal administrative unit. In 2010 the western section of the local community was detached and became part of the newly formed local community Petlovo Brdo.  Characteristics  In the urban and cadastral sense, Kijevo forms one unit with the neighboring Kne≈æevac. Majority of the area of the former Kijevo settlement is today part of the Kne≈æevac cadaster municipality, with a small part being added to the Resnik cadaster municipality.  Economy  A former village, through urbanization Kijevo became the southern extension of Rakovica and a mostly industrialized area. The most important feature in the neighborhood is the quarry which supplies the entire Belgrade's building industry with stone and slates. The remaining industry is also mostly into construction and building (building companies and cement plants Komgrap, Graditelj, etc.). Kijevo is important traffic crossroad. Crossing of the Belgrade-Ni≈° and suburban Belgrade's railway is located here, with several tunnels and \\"Kijevo\\" railway station. Kru≈æni put or \\"circular road\\" which rounds through the entire southern outskirts of Belgrade passes here, also with a tunnel in Kijevo.

Practically the entire city is built on the south bank of the river. The \\"Old town\\", now the business centre, clusters behind the broad quay-front on a low-lying strip of land left behind by a gentle loop of the river at this point. From this, the land rises sharply to the east and opposite to the west while remaining level in between. The eastern slopes are almost entirely occupied by private residential estates, while the western and southwestern prominences are largely given over to local council housing development. There are corresponding elevations on the north bank eastwards towards Christendom and westwards towards Mount Misery. The rocks which form the base of the city all belong to the Palaeozoic Group ‚Äì principally Ordovician shales underlying sandstone. On the East side of the city, the rock is crossed by an alluvial bank running N.E./S.W. At the cliffs alongside the banks of the River Suir, above Rice Bridge, inter-stratification of sharply-folded Ordovician Slates and Sandstone conglomerates may be clearly observed. Waterford is one of Ireland's oldest cities and is thought to have been founded by Vikings in the 9th century. It was taken over by Anglo-Norman invaders in the 12th century, and was one of the most important Old English centres in medieval Ireland. Since then it has seen sieges, invasions, famine and economic highs and lows. It remains the foremost city in Ireland's south- east. See Rulers of Waterford for a list of the city's rulers from 914 to the present day. Foundation The foundation of Waterford is claimed in some quarters to have taken place late in prehistoric times. Other writers place the event about the middle of the 2nd century. However, it is difficult to go along any distance with either theory on the strength of the supporting evidence quoted. There are references to Vikings living in the Waterford area in the years 860, 892 and 914, and the foundation of Waterford is generally dated to 914. A popular story of Waterford's origins tells that it was established by a Viking-chieftain named Sitric in 853. This account is based on an account by Gerald of Wales, and is challenged by Clare Downs in her article The historical importance of Viking-Age Waterford. An alternative origin myth is found in the 13th-century Ystoria Gruffudd ap Cynan ‚Äì in which the Norwegian king Harald Finehair (c. 850 ‚Äì c. 933) is said to have founded Dublin, and to have given Waterford to his brother.Downham, The historical importance of Viking-Age Waterford, pp. 81.82 This part of Ireland, in pre- Danish times, was inhabited primarily by pastoral shepherding peoples and those who made their living hunting. Towns were uncommon, excepting settlements surrounding monasteries. Seaports, in particular, were all but unheard of until the founding of Waterford, which began its history as a port town. The Ostmen or Danes as they are more commonly called, persuaded by the rigours of their own inhospitable clime, had taken to the high seas in search of plunder. During the first half of the 9th century the shores of south-east Ireland were ravaged time after time by Danish expeditions, Ardmore and Lismore being the subjects of a number of raids. At the outset, these bellicose incursions took place only during the summer months, the raiders returning home with their spoils at the onset of winter, but later the Vikings built a permanent encampment. A number of factors influenced the choice of the site. The place provided a splendid anchorage. It was the lowest point at which the river could at that time be forded. Above all, the site could easily be defended. It was protected on three sides by water; in front by the Suir; on the east and at rear by St. John's River and the marshes flanking it. St. John's River did not then, as now, flow neatly between regular banks. Rather, its tortuous and uncontained stream meandered over much of the ground now occupied by Lombard Street, William Street, the People's Park, Catherine Street, and Parnell Street, turning this entire area into viscous marshland. These marshes also extended westwards round the back of the site of the old town. Only on the west itself were substantial fortifications necessary. This was Waterford in its infancy, a Danish stronghold, subject to constant harassment by the Irish outside the walls, who broke in on more than one occasion to lay waste the foreign colony. Among the most prominent Kings of Waterford was Ivar of Waterford (d. 1000). During the late 10th and early 11th centuries, the rise of Brian B√≥ruma saw Waterford and a number of other Viking ports being brought firmly under the control of the O'Brien dynasty. Control of these Viking ports was significant for would-be Irish High Kings as it granted greater access to international trade and manpower. Anglo Norman invasion and medieval Waterford The next phase in the life of Waterford began on 25 August 1170 when the city was taken by the Normans under Strongbow. The Normans had been casting eyes in this direction for some time prior, until MacMurrough's invitation gave them cause for coming. In 1137, Diarmuid MacMorrough, king of Leinster, failed in an attempt to take Waterford. He was trying to secure the large centres to advance his claim for high king of Ireland. In 1170 MacMorrough allied himself with Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (Strongbow); together they besieged and took Waterford after a desperate defence. This was the introduction of the Anglo- Normans into Ireland. In 1171, Henry II of England became the first English king to set foot in an Irish city, by landing with a large fleet at Waterford; he did so to ensure that Ireland became an English colony and not a rival Norman country. Waterford and Dublin were declared royal cities, and belonged to the king, not Strongbow; Dublin was declared capital of Ireland. The next royal visitor, in 1185, was prince John, who granted the city's first Charter in 1205 thus starting City Government in Waterford. He revisited the city as king in 1211. Richard II, too, visited Waterford twice, first in 1394 and again in 1399. Throughout the medieval period, Waterford was Ireland's second city after Dublin. Waterford's great parchment book (1361‚Äì1649) represents the earliest use of the English language in Ireland for official purposes. In 1487 the city refused to obey the direction of the Earl of Kildare to recognise Lambert Simnel as king and ten years later repulsed a second pretender, Perkin Warbeck. As a result, King Henry VII gave the city its motto: Urbs Intacta Manet Waterfordia (Waterford remains the untaken city). Printing was introduced into Waterford in 1550, the first book being printed in the city five years later. It was in 1588 that Duncannon was fortified as a precaution against Spanish attacks along the coast, which were being experienced at the time. =Area and extent ‚Äì the city walls= Until recently there was no record of the extent of any settlement that may have existed at Waterford prior to the middle of the 9th century. The Danish colony founded about that time (853 AD) was triangular in shape and contained approximately. This area was enclosed by stout ramparts linking Reginald's Tower with St. Martin's Castle (site in Spring Garden Alley); from thence running to Turgesius' Tower, which stood in the immediate vicinity of the Allied Irish Bank (corner of Barronstrand St) and returning along the river-front to Reginald's Tower. Substantial remains of the wall in the 500-metre stretch between Reginald's Tower and St. Martin's Castle still exist, except where broken by the erection of the City Hall and the opening of Colbeck Street (former (Colbeck Gate). These traces may be observed between the houses of the Mall and Bailey's New Street and, further up, between Spring Garden Alley and Lady Lane, about 12 metres back from the northern frontage of the former. In the old handball alley, some four metres of the Wall‚Äîin places six metres high‚Äîstand exposed. Also, parts of the breastwork of St. Martin's Castle have been incorporated in the foundations and lower courses of the buildings that now stand on its former site. Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity, Barronstrand Street, Waterford There are a few traces at the wall linking St. Martin's Castle with Turgesius' Tower, and which followed the line of Michael Street and Broad Street, about sixteen to twenty metres back from the present eastern frontage of these streets. The wall fronting the Quay has completely disappeared. It was demolished and the material thrown down to form the foundation of the present Quays, partly under the Cromwellian Commissioners in 1650 and totally by the Corporation of 1705, which improved and enlarged the Quays. ‚Äì Religious war and upheavals Waterford was occupied by Mountjoy in 1603 during the Nine Years War (Ireland) a rebellion led by Hugh O'Neill, ostensibly in the cause of Irish freedom and the Catholic religion. Despite their own adherence to Catholicism, the townspeople largely sided with the English government forces. However, upon the coronation of James VI of Scotland as king of England in 1603, the citizens participated in an uprising that was common to the coastal cities of Munster and refused entry to Mountjoy, the king's Lord Deputy of Ireland, who had just secured the surrender of Hugh O'Neill. The motivation for Waterford's defiance lay in the people's demand for freedom of religion ‚Äì they were led by Catholic priests and re-consecrated several churches in the city ‚Äì although there were also mutterings about the nationality of the new king. After negotiations, Lord Mountjoy was granted entry to the city and the citizens pledged their loyalty anew. However, Waterford's Roman Catholic population became deeply alienated from the English Protestant state in Ireland in the following 40 years. After the Irish Rebellion of 1641, Waterford was a centre of support for the Confederate Catholics of Ireland ‚Äì a de facto independent Irish state formed to fight for Irish Catholic interests in the Irish Confederate Wars. Within the Confederation, Waterford was known for its militant Catholic politics ‚Äì rejecting an alliance signed between the Confederates and Charles I that would have sent Irish troops to fight for the King in the English Civil War. Waterford was visited by the Papal Nuncio to Ireland, Giovanni Battista Rinuccini in 1648. The latter, in his \\"Report on the Affairs of Ireland\\" sent to Pope Innocent X, described Waterford as being \\"one of the only two Irish cities he would place in the front rank for reverence to the Holy See.\\" In 1649 during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, the city was unsuccessfully besieged by Oliver Cromwell, but was forced to surrender to his Deputy, Henry Ireton, after a prolonged siege in the summer of the following year. After the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, both James II and William of Orange came by Waterford, James on his way to France and William returning to England. It was soon after this, about 1700, that the Huguenots came to Waterford, sponsored by the English Protestant regime. 18th century Waterford The 18th century was a period of huge prosperity for Waterford. Most of the city's best architecture appeared during this time. Trading with Newfoundland brought much wealth into what was then the third largest port in Ireland. In 1783, George and William Penrose founded a glass factory, which would become Waterford Crystal, the most famous business in the city. There was no armed uprising in the area as part of the 1798 Rebellion, as a result of the rebel defeat at Wexford. There was, however, considerable United Irishmen activity in the city and district, where secret recruitment had been going on apace. Among those arraigned for seditious activity at the time was the toll collector of the then five-year-old wooden bridge over the Suir. A permanent military presence was established in the city with the completion of the Cavalry Barracks at the end of the 18th century. Catholic Emancipation and Famine In 1826, Waterford returned Henry Villiers-Stuart to Parliament against the opposition of Lord George Beresford, the outgoing candidate and powerful landowner in the district. Stuart was put forward by Daniel O'Connell's Catholic Association and O'Connell personally led his campaign here. Though not a Roman Catholic himself, Stuart was a man of liberal views and his election was an important step in the way to Catholic Emancipation which came three years later. The Great Famine of 1846‚Äì1848 made itself felt in the city and the Corporation records of the period refer to several money grants to relieve the distress of the people. The fact that there were large quantities of rice in Waterford saved the city from the worst effects of disastrous shortage in the normal food supply. Waterford 1850‚Äì1923 In the 19th century, great industries such as glass making and ship building thrived in the city. Thomas Francis Meagher (Meagher of the sword), an Irish nationalist, made the first Irish tricolour. He brought it back from France and it was first flown from a building on the Mall in Waterford. In the early 20th century John Redmond was MP for Waterford and leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, which almost achieved home rule and a new parliament for Ireland. Irish Guards' Regimental Mascot -Leitrim Boy, an Irish Wolfhound in 1909 outside Waterford Barracks. =The Irish Civil War= After the evacuation of British troops (Devonshire Regiment) from Waterford city at the end of the Irish War of Independence, the military and police barracks were occupied by the Waterford Flying Column, under the leadership of George Lennon of Dungarvan, which was part of the combined (1921) Waterford Brigade under the command of Pax Whelan from Dungarvan. These men opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1922 and therefore took the Republican side when the Irish Civil War commenced with the firing upon the Four Courts in late June 1922. Republicans considered Waterford to be the eastern stronghold of the \\"Munster Republic\\", and linchpin of the 'Limerick- Waterford line'. In late July 1922, therefore, National Army troops under Major General John T. Prout, composed of 450 men, one 18 pounder artillery piece and 4 machine guns arrived from Kilkenny to re-take the city as part of a national offensive. Prout's second in command was Patrick Paul, formerly commander of the IRA in East Waterford. Arrested by his former comrades for supporting the Free State, he escaped disguised as a nun, to join the government forces in Kilkenny. The Republicans had chosen to defend the city along the southern bank of the river Suir, occupying the military barracks, the prison and the Post Office. Prout placed his artillery on Mount Misery overlooking their positions and bombarded the Republicans until they were forced to evacuate the barracks and prison. However the gun had to be brought down to Ferrybank to fire over open sights before the Republicans abandoned the Post Office. Some street fighting followed before the Irregulars fled the city and retreated westward to Mount Congreve in Kilmeadan. Two Free State soldiers were killed in the fighting and one Republican fighter. Five civilians were also killed.Terence O'Reilly, Rebel Heart, p175-188 ReferencesSources *Waterford: A Municipal Directory *Paul V Walsh, The Irish Civil War 1922‚Äì23 -A Study of the Conventional Phase. * External links *Mayors of Waterford City, P.

A sequel, Crime, was published in 2008.http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/profile/?p=auth120 It was adapted into a 2013 film of the same name, directed by Jon S. Baird with James McAvoy in the lead role. Plot summary Bruce Robertson is a detective sergeant serving in Edinburgh's \\"Lothian Constabulary\\". Robertson is a Machiavellian, intensely misanthropic man who spends his time indulging in cocaine and alcohol abuse, sexually abusive relationships, compulsive gorging on junk food, and, most of all, his penchant for \\"the games\\" ‚Äì Bruce's euphemism for the myriad foul plots he hatches directed at workmates. He is able to pander to all of his vices during his annual holidays in Amsterdam. The novel begins by introducing the murder of Efan Wurie, a case Bruce has been assigned. The plot has little to do with the actual crime; instead, the novel traces Bruce throughout his life, told in a first-person, stream-of- consciousness style. Through narrative devices such as the tapeworm he acquires, the reader explores the facets of Bruce's personality and learns about his past, as well as the various tedious police routines Bruce absconds from, his often-backfiring sexual endeavours, and his various short- and long- term schemes and plots against his colleagues (ultimately to raise his chances of gaining the hoped-for promotion to detective inspector). Apart from the general malevolent scheming, along the way Bruce Robertson also seeks to satisfy his cravings for violence, drugs, sex, and pornography whilst happily voicing his racism, anti-Catholic sectarianism, and misogyny, all the while pining for his ex-wife. As the novel progresses, Bruce's mental health begins to deteriorate; it is revealed that he suffers from drug addiction and bipolar disorder, which, along with his inability to form meaningful, trust-based relationships, are exacerbated by latent, unresolved psychological problems caused by childhood abuses. Eventually Bruce is forced into taking leave due to injuries he suffers while dressed as his ex-wife, leading to the revelation that he committed the racially motivated murder that serves as the novel's main plot and that the colleagues he despises ‚Äì particularly his boss Robert Toal ‚Äì have been aware of his guilt all along and have been protecting him from the consequences of his actions out of a mixture of loyalty and pity. At the end of the story, Bruce kills himself, with his last thoughts being regret and hoping that his daughter does not know of his suicide. Characters\\"Polis\\"= * Bruce Robertson: The novel's protagonist and anti-hero, Bruce Robertson is an amoral, Machiavellian, misanthropic, racist, sexist, psychopathic Detective Sergeant. * Ray Lennox: Bruce's co-worker and friend. * Robert Toal: Bruce's workplace superior; held in contempt by Bruce, who nevertheless must attempt to curry his favour to win a promotion. * Peter Inglis: Another co-worker of Bruce, whom he suspects of being gay. * Amanda Drummond: A third co-worker of Bruce's, and the only one who openly disapproves of his behaviour and lifestyle. =Others= * Carole ‚Äì Bruce's ex-wife. * Stacey ‚Äì Bruce's young daughter. * Clifford Blades: Registrar General for Scotland's Office, a member of Bruce's masonic lodge; a neurotic, insecure man, Clifford's marriage problems form one of the novel's major subplots. * Bunty Blades: Cliff Blades' wife and target of Bruce's dubious affections. * Shirley ‚Äì Carole's sister and Bruce's sister-in law. * Tom Stronach ‚Äì Footballer and Bruce's neighbour. * Alex \\"Lexo\\" Setterington and \\"Ghostie\\" Gorman ‚Äì Career criminals who live in Edinburgh. * Ocky ‚Äì A hapless petty criminal and police informant whom Bruce regularly exploits. * Rhona ‚Äì Bruce's childhood girlfriend, in which the history of said relationship is revealed not by Bruce, but the tapeworm. Plot devicesLanguage= Welsh's style of writing involves mainly Scottish English; but incorporates elements and loans from the Scots language (e.g. \\"tae\\" is \\"to\\", \\"dae\\" is \\"do\\"), mainly the Edinburgh dialectal form. Also, Bruce uses rhyming slang, a common element of urban Scots dialects (such as \\"Sherman tank\\" ‚Äì wank; Demi Moore ‚Äì \\"hoor\\" (i.e. whore), Jackie Trent ‚Äì \\"bent\\", and so on). =Themes= In Filth, Welsh deals with freemasonry, drug abuse, sexism, racism/sectarianism, pornography, prostitution and alcohol abuse, among other problems faced by the Scottish working class. =Carole= Carole, Bruce's ex- wife and the mother of his child, Stacey, is a device Welsh uses to reflect an outsider's view of Bruce Robertson's character; certain chapters only involve Carole's inner monologue related to Bruce. (It later transpires that it is, in fact Bruce fantasising while dressed as Carole.) =The Tapeworm= At a certain point in the book, the narrative starts to be interrupted by a tube- like structure that appears on top of the text, and at first is only made of the word \\"eat\\" being repeated amid the zeros that fill the empty space within the tube. It is later revealed that this is actually the thoughts of the tapeworm growing inside Bruce's intestines. At first, the tapeworm only encourages Bruce to eat. Later, after becoming self-aware (and naming itself \\"The Self\\"), the tapeworm starts to ask basic existential questions and names Bruce as \\"The Host\\". It also stumbles upon the existence of other worms (collectively named by the initial worm as \\"The Other\\"). The tapeworm's monologues, which grow lengthier and more eloquent as the novel progresses, explain Bruce's backstory and how he became the person presented to the reader.

Born and raised in Rosscarbery, West Cork of County Cork in the South of Ireland during the Great Irish Famine, O'Donovan founded the Phoenix National and Literary Society and dedicated his life to working towards the establishment of an independent Irish Republic. He joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood and after fleeing to the United States as part of the Cuba Five, he joined Irish revolutionary organisations there, beyond the reach of the British Empire. He was a pioneer in physical force Irish republicanism utilising dynamite in a campaign of asymmetrical warfare, hitting the British Empire on its home territory, primarily London. BiographyLife in Ireland= Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa was born Jeremiah Donovan in the townland of Reanascreena, Rosscarbery, County Cork, to Denis Donovan and Ellen Driscol, and was baptised on 4 September 1831. His parents were tenant farmers. According to the scholar John O'Donovan, with whom Rossa corresponded, Rossa's ancestors belonged to the obscure but ancient sliocht of the MacEnesles or Clan Aneslis O'Donovans.Rossa's Recollections, pp. 339 ff His ancestors had held letters patent in Kilmeen parish in the 17th century before the confiscations, with his agnomen \\"Rossa\\" coming from the townland of Rossmore in Kilmeen.Diarmuid √ì Murchadha, Family Names of County Cork. Cork: The Collins Press. 2nd edition, 1996. pp. 128‚Äì9. So Jeremiah adopted the surname, Rossa. Rossa became a shopkeeper in Skibbereen, where, in 1856, he established the Phoenix National and Literary Society, the aim of which was \\"the liberation of Ireland by force of arms\\",Shane Mac Thom√°is, \\"Remembering the Past: Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa\\", in An Phoblacht/Republican News, 4 August 2005. This organisation would later merge with the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), founded two years later in Dublin. In December 1858, he was arrested and jailed without trial until July 1859. In 1863 he became the business manager of James Stephens' newspaper, The Irish People (1863 newspaper) which was suppressed in 1865. He was arrested and charged with treason felony and sentenced to penal servitude for life due to his previous convictions. He served his time in Pentonville, Portland, Millbank and Chatham prisons in England. Rossa was a defiant prisoner, manacled for 35 straight days for throwing a chamber pot at the prison's warden and thrown into solitary confinement on a bread-and-water diet for three days for refusing to take off his cap in front of the prison's doctor.Timothy Messer-Kruse, The Haymarket Conspiracy: Transatlantic Anarchist Networks. Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 2012; pg. 107. For most of his time in prison Rossa was denied the right to correspond with his associates in the outside world because of his violation of prison rules. In an 1869 by-election, he was returned to the British House of Commons for the Tipperary constituency, in which he defeated the Liberal Catholic Denis Caulfield Heron by 1054 to 898 votes.A. M. Sullivan, New Ireland, London, n.d. [c. 1877], pp. 329‚Äì330 The election was declared invalid because Rossa was an imprisoned felon. =Life in the United States= Cuba Five - John Devoy, Charles O'Connell, Henry Mullady, Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa and John McClure After giving an understanding that he would not return to Ireland, in effect his exile, O'Donovan Rossa was released as part of the Fenian Amnesty of 1870. Boarding the ship SS Cuba, he left for the United States with his friend John Devoy and three other exiles. Together they were dubbed \\"The Cuba Five\\". O'Donovan Rossa took up residence in New York City, where he joined Clan na Gael and the Fenian Brotherhood. Rossa additionally established his own newspaper dedicated to the cause of Irish national liberation from British rule, The United Irishman. In it Rossa advocated the terroristic use of dynamite bombs as a means of overthrowing the British occupation. His paper was used to raise a so-called \\"resources for civilisation fund,\\" presumably for the purchase of dynamite and other armaments for the Irish struggle.Messer-Kruse, The Haymarket Conspiracy, pg. 108. Rossa organised the first ever bombings by Irish republicans of English cities in what was called the \\"dynamite campaign\\". The campaign lasted through the 1880s and made him infamous in Britain. The British government demanded his extradition from America, but without success. Rossa later justified his revolutionary activities in the following manner; On 2 February 1885, Rossa was shot outside his office near Broadway by an Englishwoman, Lucille Yseult Dudley. He was admitted to the Chamers Street Hospital with gunshot wounds to the back. Even though they were not life-threatening, a ball was to remain embedded there for the rest of his life. \\"I've been wounded in the war\\" was Rossa's comment to a friend in the hospital.McWilliams, P., O'Donovan Rossa: An Irish Revolutionary in America, p. 142. The British government claimed she was mentally unstable, and not acting on its behalf, although Rossa's supporters and even many of his detractors found this hard to believe. More likely, she was incensed at the fund he organised (the so-called \\"Skirmishing Fund\\") which was intended to support the arming of those who would fight the British. Rossa was allowed to visit Ireland in 1894, and again in 1904. On the latter visit, he was made a \\"Freeman of the City of Cork.\\" =Family= O'Donovan Rossa was married three times and had eighteen children. On 6 June 1853, he married Honora Eager of Skibbereen, who bore him four sons (Denis, John, Cornelius Crom and Jeremiah). She died in 1860. In 1861 he married Ellen Buckley of Castlehaven; they had one son (Florence Stephens; later known as Timothy in the US); Buckley died in July 1863. In November 1864 he married, for the third time, to Mary Jane (Molly) Irwin of Clonakilty. They had thirteen children (James Maxwell, Kate Ellen, Francis Daniel, Maurice, Sheila Mary, Eileen Ellen, Amelia, Jeremiah, Isabella, Mary Jane, Margaret Mary Hamilton, Joseph Ivor and Alexander Aeneas). O'Dovonan Rossa's great-great grandson is US international rugby union player John Quill. =Death and funeral= His funeral procession 1 August 1915 Gravestone in Glasnevin Cemetery Rossa was seriously ill in his later years, and was finally confined to a hospital bed in St. Vincent's Hospital, Staten Island, where he died at the age of 83. The new republican movement in Ireland was quick to realise the propaganda value of the old Fenian's death, and Tom Clarke cabled to John Devoy the message: \\"Send his body home at once\\". His body was returned to Ireland for burial and a hero's welcome. The funeral at Glasnevin Cemetery on 1 August 1915 was a huge affair, garnering substantial publicity for the Irish Volunteers and the IRB at time when a rebellion (later to emerge as the Easter Rising) was being actively planned.Bureau of Military History WS 497, cited by Townshend, p.115. The graveside oration, given by Patrick Pearse, remains one of the most famous speeches of the Irish independence movement stirring his audience to a call to arms.C Townshend, \\"Easter 1916: The Irish Rebellion\\", (London 2006), p.114-5. It ended with the lines: > They think that they have pacified Ireland. They think that they have > purchased half of us and intimidated the other half. They think that they > have foreseen everything, think that they have provided against everything; > but, the fools, the fools, the fools! ‚Äî They have left us our Fenian dead, > and while Ireland holds these graves, Ireland unfree shall never be at > peace.Townshend, p.116. His grave was renovated in 1990 by the National Graves Association. =Legacy= Monument to Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, in Dublin's St Stephen's Green A memorial to O'Donovan Rossa stands in St. Stephen's Green, and a bridge over the River Liffey was renamed in his honour. A street in Cork City bears his name, as does a street in Thurles, Co. Tipperary ‚Äì the constituency where he was elected. A park in Skibbereen is also named after him as is the local Gaelic football team. A memorial to O'Donovan Rossa stands in the village of Reenascreena, Rosscarbery Co Cork where his descendants run the local village pub. The funeral casket that was used to ship him home is now on display next to the pub. Other GAA teams throughout Ireland have also been named after him including Ard B√≥ U√≠ Dhonnabhain Rossa in the Tyrone GAA, O'Donovan Rossa GAC in Belfast, √ì Donnabh√°in Rosa Magherafelt in the Derry GAA and U√≠ Donnabh√°in Rosa Mullach Breac in Armagh GAA along with √ì Donnabh√°in Rosa est. in 2018 in Astoria, Queens, New York. The descendants of Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa made their homes in Staten Island; they include writer William Rossa Cole and New York City Councillor Jerome X. O'Donovan. =In popular culture= In James Joyce's \\"Araby,\\" written between 1905 and 1907, the narrator is walking across Dublin, when he hears \\"the nasal chanting of street-singers, who sang a come-all-you about O'Donovan Rossa\\". Rossa appears as a character in Harry Harrison's alternate history Stars and Stripes trilogy.

They had a five-year career, beginning in 1999 and ending on 17 January 2005. The band had stated in interviews their intention to disband before they \\"turn into some old, tired and jaded outfit\\". They broke up after two albums and one EP. In the UK, the band were signed to the London-based independent record label, Fantastic Plastic Records, while Epitaph distributed their records in the US. The band were not typically associated with any particular music scene, playing on tour with a variety of diverse bands, though influences included bands such as Sonic Youth and The Fall. In 2003, they undertook a six-week tour of the US, with Sweden's Sahara Hotnights and the US's The Washdown. Original bass player Jon Ball left the band in 2003, to be replaced by Tracy Bellaries (formerly of Soulbossa), although Ball was still involved for most of the songwriting process and some of the recording of Modern Apprentice, the band's second and final album. Bellaries afterwards joined the group Mystery Meat, and later Part Chimp.

The album was recorded with Tracy Bellaries playing most of the bass parts, despite the fact she had not been in the band for most of the writing process but had only joined after the departure of Jon Ball. As such, a number of tracks credit both members due to Ball having written (or played) the bass lines in full or part.

Under the posting rule, that acceptance takes effect when a letter is posted (that is, dropped in a post box or handed to a postal worker).The post office will be the universal service provider, such as the Royal Mail or Australia Post or United States Postal Service In plain English, the \\"meeting of the minds\\" necessary to contract formation occurs at the exact moment word of acceptance is sent via post by the person accepting it, rather than when that acceptance is received by the person who offered the contract. The rules of contracts by post (postal rules) include the following: # An offer made by post/letter is not effective until received by the offeree. # Acceptance is effective as soon as it is posted. # For revocation to be effective, it must be received by the offeree before they post their letter of acceptance. One rationale given for the rule is that the offeror nominates the post office as his or her implied agent, and thus receipt of the acceptance by the post office is regarded as receipt by the offeror. The main effect of the posting rule is that the risk of acceptance being delivered late or lost in the post is placed upon the offeror. If the offeror is reluctant to accept this risk, he can always expressly require actual receipt as a condition before being legally bound by his offer. English case law The rule was established by a series of 19th century cases, starting with Adams v Lindsell (1818) B & Ald 681, which was later confirmed and expanded in Dunlop v Higgins (1848) 1 HL Cas 381, Household Fire and Carriage Accident Insurance Co Ltd v Grant (1879) 4 Ex D 216 and Henthorn v Fraser [1892] 2 Ch 27. The posting rule applies only to acceptance. Other contractual letters (such as one revoking the offer) do not take effect until the letter is delivered, as in Stevenson, Jacques & Co v McLean (1880) 5 QBD 346. The implication of this is that it is possible for a letter of acceptance to be posted after a letter of revocation of the offer has been posted but before it is delivered, and acceptance will be complete at the time that the letter of acceptance was posted‚Äîthe offeror's revocation would be inoperative. Example 1: * Day 1: A makes an offer to B. * Day 2: A decides to revoke the offer and puts a letter in the mail to B revoking the offer. * Day 3: B puts a letter accepting the offer in the mail. * Day 4: B receives A's revocation letter. ** The letter of revocation can be effective only when received, that is Day 4. ** However, a contract was formed on Day 3 when the letter of acceptance was posted. ** It is too late for A to revoke the offer. Example 2: * Day 1: A makes an offer to B. * Day 2: B intends to reject the offer by putting a letter in the mail to A rejecting the offer. * Day 3: B changes his mind and sends a fax to A accepting the offer. ** In this situation, whichever communication A receives first will govern. Example 3: * Day 1: A makes an offer to sell a parcel of land to B. * Day 2: B mails her acceptance. * Day 3: Before A receives B's acceptance, B telephones A and states she wishes to reject the offer. * Day 4: B's original letter of acceptance arrives, A then records the contract as a sale. ** B's acceptance of the offer means there is a binding contract ‚Äì she is obliged to pay for the land or be liable for damages. ** B is just rejecting the offer, she did not actually revoke her acceptance Under the posting rule, performance is a means of acceptance. If A orders 1000 blue coathangers and B ships them out, that shipment is considered to be a conveyance of acceptance of A's offer to buy the coathangers. Defective performance is also an acceptance, unless accompanied by an explanation. For example, if A orders 1000 blue coathangers, and B mistakenly ships 1000 red coathangers, this is still an acceptance of the contract. However, if B ships the red coathangers with a note that they sent these because they had run out of blue coathangers, this is not an acceptance, but rather an accommodation, which is a form of counter-offer. An interesting implication of the operation of the posting rule is that an acceptance is complete once the letter of acceptance is posted; it makes no difference whether the offeror actually receives the letter. This was demonstrated in Byrne v Van Tienhoven (1880) 5 CPD 344. If a letter of acceptance were to be lost, acceptance has still taken place. Furthermore, the posting rule does not apply to instantaneous forms of communications. For example, in Entores Ltd v Miles Far East Corporation [1955] 2 QB 327, the Court held that the posting rule did not apply to an acceptance by telex as the Court regarded it as an instantaneous form of communication. The general principle that acceptance takes place when communicated applies to instantaneous forms of communication. Courts have similarly held that the posting rule does apply to acceptances by telephone or fax. The courts are yet to decide whether e-mail should be regarded as an instantaneous form of communication. If the offeree were to convey acceptance by commercially unreasonable means ‚Äì by cross-country pony express, for example ‚Äì the acceptance would not be effective until it had actually been received. A letter is regarded as \\"posted\\" only when it is in the possession of the Post Office; this was established in the case of Re London & Northern Bank [1900] 1 Ch 220. A letter of acceptance is not considered \\"posted\\" if it is handed to an agent to deliver, such as a courier. This is not the case under the Uniform Commercial Code. The posting rule does not apply to option contracts or irrevocable offers where acceptance is still effective only upon receipt. This is because the offeree no longer needs protection against subsequently mailed revocations of the offer. American case law In the United States, the majority rule is that the mailbox rule does not apply to option contracts. By default, an option contract is accepted when the offeror receives the acceptance, not when the offeree mails it. However, because the California Civil Code applies the mailbox rule to all contracts, California follows the minority rule, under which the mailbox rule also applies to option contracts.Palo Alto Town & Country Village, Inc. v. BBTC Company, 11 Cal. 3d 494, 113 Cal. Rptr. 705, 521 P.2d 1097 (1974). Australian case law In Tallerman & Co Pty Ltd v Nathan's Merchandise (1957) 98 CLR 93, 111-112Tallerman & Co Pty Ltd v Nathan's Merchandise (1957) 98 CLR 93 Dixon CJ and Fullagar J took a more restrictive view. \\"The general rule is that a contract is not completed until acceptance of an offer is actually communicated to the offeror, and a finding that a contract is completed by the posting of a letter of acceptance cannot be justified unless it is to be inferred that the offeror contemplated and intended that his offer might be accepted by the doing of that act.\\" The High Court included the element of intention. Civil law jurisdictions Civil law jurisdictions do not follow the postal rule. The classical civil law position is that acceptance, like any expression of will, can only be effective if it was communicated to the addressee, unless the lack of communication can be attributed to the latter.See e.g. Article 3:37 of the Dutch Civil Code, Article 130 of the German Civil Code The Vienna Convention on the International Sale of Goods chooses a compromise between the two approaches: According to article 18(2) of the Convention, an acceptance is effective when it reaches the offeror. However, article 16(1) of the Convention provides for the most important consequence of the common law \\"posting rule\\", that is, an offer may not be revoked if the revocation reaches the offeree after it has dispatched an acceptance.See Articles 18 and 16(1) of the Vienna Convention UNCITRAL model law Many countries have enacted legislation based on the UNCITRAL Model Law of Electronic Commerce. Such legislation is often entitled the Electronic Transactions Act. Among other issues, this legislation deals a default rule for the time that email (electronic communications) is sent and when it is received. However it is mistaken to suggest that it deals with a clarification of the postal acceptance rule for electronic communications. There are two schools of thought. # Ask if the postal acceptance rule applies to emails (electronic communications). If your answer is yes, then the relevant Electronic Transaction Act (ETA) can help. The postal acceptance rule states that there is a contract when posted ‚Äì so we should apply the \\"sent\\" rule under the ETA. If the answer is no; then either apply the \\"received\\" rule under the ETA or ignore it and use the contract rule of communication. # Instead, treat the Electronic Transactions Act as an intended substitute and statutory replacement of the postal acceptance rule; in which case the \\"received\\" rule should apply. The problem with this second school of thought is that there is nothing in the Model Law of Electronic Commerce, nor the ETAs which suggests that it was intended to replace the postal acceptance rule. We are still waiting for a court to decide. The UNCITRAL rules on time of sending and receiving are: # Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, the dispatch of a data message occurs when it enters an information system outside the control of the originator or of the person who sent the data message on behalf of the originator. # Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, the time of receipt of a data message is determined as follows: :: (a) if the addressee has designated an information system for the purpose of receiving data messages, receipt occurs: ::: (i) at the time when the data message enters the designated information system; or ::: (ii) if the data message is sent to an information system of the addressee that is not the designated information system, at the time when the data message is retrieved by the addressee; :: (b) if the addressee has not designated an information system, receipt occurs when the data message enters an information system of the addressee.

It was produced by William Alland and directed by Jack Arnold. The film stars Richard Carlson and Barbara Rush, and features Charles Drake, Joe Sawyer, and Russell Johnson. The script is based on Ray Bradbury's original story treatment and not, as sometimes claimed, a published short story, \\"The Meteor\\".Stafford, Jeff. \\"Articles: 'It Came from Outer Space'.\\" Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved: January 10, 2015. It Came from Outer Space tells the story of an amateur astronomer and his fianc√©e who are stargazing in the desert when a large fiery object crashes to Earth. At the crash site, he discovers a round alien spaceship just before it is completely buried by a landslide. When he tells the local sheriff and newspaper editor what he saw, he is branded a crackpot. Before long, odd things begin to happen, and the disbelief turns hostile. Plot Author and amateur astronomer John Putnam (Richard Carlson) and schoolteacher Ellen Fields (Barbara Rush) watch a large meteorite crash near the small town of Sand Rock, Arizona. They awaken a neighbor, who has a helicopter, and all three fly to the crash site. Putnam climbs down into the crater and notices a partially buried round object in the crater's pit. He comes to the realization, after he sees a six-sided hatchway close, that this isn't a meteorite but a large alien spaceship. The hatchway's noise starts a landslide that completely buries the craft. Putnam's story is later scoffed at by Sand Rock's sheriff (Charles Drake) and the local news media. Even Ellen Fields is unsure about what to believe but still agrees to assist Putnam in his investigation. Over the next several days, local people disappear; a few return, but they act distant or appear somewhat dazed and not their usual selves. Convinced by these and other odd events, Sheriff Warren comes to believe Putnam's story that the meteorite is actually a crashed spaceship with alien inhabitants; he then organizes a posse to hunt down the invaders at their crash site. Putnam, however, hopes to reach a peaceful solution to the looming crisis. Alone, he enters a nearby abandoned mine, which he hopes will eventually connect to the now buried spaceship and its alien occupants. Putnam finally discovers the spaceship and learns from the alien leader that they crashed on Earth by accident; the aliens appear benign and only plan to stay on Earth just long enough to repair their damaged craft and then continue on their voyage. The aliens' real appearance, when finally revealed to Putnam, is entirely non-human: they are large, single-eyed, almost jellyfish-like beings that seem to glide across the ground, leaving a glistening trail that soon vanishes. They are also able to shape shift into human form in order to appear human and move around Sand Rock, unobserved, in order to collect their much needed repair materials. To do this, they copy the human forms of the local townspeople that they have abducted. In doing so, however, they fail to reproduce the townspeople's exact personalities, leading to suspicion and eventually to the deaths of two of the aliens. The aliens have decided to destroy themselves and their spaceship, now that they have been discovered. Putnam reasons with them at length and convinces the alien leader to instead finish the repairs while he, as a sign of the aliens' good faith, takes the captives outside to the sheriff and his posse. To protect the aliens from the sheriff and his advancing posse, Putnam manages to seal off the mine in order to give them the time they still need to finish their spaceship's repairs. Shortly afterwards the alien spaceship leaves Earth. Putnam's fianc√©e Ellen asks him if they are gone for good. He responds \\"No, just for now. It wasn't the right time for us to meet. But there will be other nights, other stars for us to watch. They'll be back\\".

Bradbury said \\"I wanted to treat the invaders as beings who were not dangerous, and that was very unusual\\". He offered two story outlines to the studio, one with malicious aliens, the other with benign aliens. \\"The studio picked the right concept, and I stayed on\\".Weller 2005, p. 60. In 2004 Bradbury published in one volume all four versions of his screen treatment for It Came From Outer Space.Bradbury, 2004 (Gauntlet Press). Filming took place on location in and around the California towns of Palmdale, Victorville, and the Mojave Desert, as well as on Universal's sound stages. The film's uncredited music score was composed by Irving Gertz, Henry Mancini, and Herman Stein.Warren 1982 Universal's make-up department submitted two alien designs to studio executives for consideration; the rejected design was saved and later used as the \\"Metaluna Mutant\\" in Universal's 1955 science fiction film This Island Earth. The fiery special effects created for the crashing alien spacecraft consisted of a wire-mounted iron ball with dorsal fin, which had hollowed out \\"windows\\" all around for the burning magnesium inside. The Arizona setting and the alien abduction of telephone lineman and two other characters are fictionalized story elements taken from Bradbury's younger life when his father moved the family to Tucson, where he worked as a telephone lineman. Urban legend has it that an extra in an Army staff sergeant's uniform seen at the \\"meteor\\" crash site is comedy writer-performer Morey Amsterdam. While the briefly glimpsed extra does indeed resemble Amsterdam, no hard evidence (e.g., cast call bureau records, interviews with Amsterdam) has ever confirmed this is actually him. The most recent DVD re-release of It Came from Outer Space comes with a documentary, The Universe According to Universal. It was written and directed by David J. Skal and has audio commentary by Tom Weaver, in which Weaver notes the extra's similarity to Morey Amsterdam.

Bosworth's inclusion of the Korean War- era film as anti-Communist propaganda is at odds with both The American Film Institute and story author Ray Bradbury, who stated, \\"I wanted to treat the invaders as beings who were not dangerous, and that was very unusual\\". No Earthlings are killed or injured in the film by the aliens. If they were intended to be stand-ins for the Soviet Union/Communists, as Bosworth professes, their presence in an Arizona town is antithetical to how Communist surrogates were portrayed in Hollywood science fiction films during the Cold War. Bosworth blames her father's 1959 suicide on his being targeted by the Hollywood Blacklist; her father, defense lawyer Bartley Crum, died of an alcohol and barbiturate overdose. =Reviews= The New York Times review by A.

Sequel A made-for-TV sequel entitled It Came from Outer Space II was released in 1996, starring Brian Kerwin, Elizabeth Pe√±a, Jonathan Carrasco, Adrian Sparks, Bill McKinney, Dean Norris, Lauren Tewes, Mickey Jones and Howard Morris. Written by Jim and Ken Wheat, it was directed by Roger Duchowny, and was his final work before retiring. The story is essentially a remake of the first film, with former small town resident Jack Putnam (Kerwin) returning and witnessing an alien craft landing. Strange things then begin to happen, with his neighbours behaving oddly and the power going off and on. Writing for The Radio Times, Alan Jones gave the film one star out of five and called it a \\"lacklustre update\\" which was \\"proof positive that 40 years of technical advances can't compensate for poor production values, boring characters and a complete lack of thrills.\\" He summarised: \\"file this under 'don't bother.'\\" Leonard Maltin called the original \\"intriguing\\" and \\"remarkably sober for its era, with crisp performances and real restraint, even in its use of 3-D\\" and the 1996 effort \\"a much inferior remake, rather than the sequel the title suggests.\\" In the New York Daily News, David Bianculli wrote that \\"the fact that this is a remake not a sequel, yet carries the suffix II anyway, is a clue about how clearly the makers of this new version were thinking when they made it.

On computer keyboards, the enter key and return key are two closely related keys with overlapping and distinct functions dependent on operating system and application. Functions The return key has its origins in two typewriter functions: carriage return, which would reset the carriage to the beginning of the line of text, and line feed, which would advance the paper one line downward. These were often combined into a single return key, a convention that continues in modern computer word processing to insert a paragraph break (¬∂). An OK button which enter / return could invoke The enter key is a computer innovation, which in most cases causes a command line, window form, or dialog box to operate its default function. This is typically to finish an \\"entry\\" and begin the desired process, and is usually an alternative to clicking an OK button. Additionally, it can act as the equal to button in calculator programs. On modern computers both keys generally have all the functions of the other, allowing for either key to be used, or even for them to be combined into a single key, as is the case with most laptops. Microsoft Windows makes no distinction between them whatsoever, and usually both keys are labelled as enter on Windows keyboards with the United States layout. Other operating systems, such as Apple's Darwin-based OSs, generally treat them equivalently while still maintaining the technical and descriptive distinction, allowing applications to treat the two keys differently if necessary. Location The enter key is typically located to the right of the and keys on the lower right of the numeric keypad, while the return key is situated on the right edge of the main alphanumeric portion of the keyboard. On ISO and JIS keyboards, return is a stepped double-height key spanning the second and third rows, below and above the right-hand . On ANSI keyboards it is wider but located on the third row only, as the backslash key is located between it and . An example of a non-standard double-height ANSI return key on the NeXTstation keyboard (alongside several other non-standard elements). Some variants of the ANSI keyboard layout create a double-height return key by subsuming the backslash key into it. This alternate form is most popular in Asia, particularly Russia and Korea. However, this requires the relocation of the backslash key and is relatively uncommon on modern keyboards elsewhere. =Nomenclature= The return key symbol is , an arrow pointing down and leftward; however, rendering of the symbol varies greatly by typeface, with it appearing hollow in some or with an additional initial rightward bar in others. For this reason, or are sometimes used instead. On most ISO and other keyboards worldwide the return key is labelled solely with the symbol across all platforms. Meanwhile, on ANSI US keyboards it is labelled as by Windows OEMs (sometimes even without the return symbol) and as by Apple. For enter, exists as the Unicode symbol; however, it is infrequently used, one example being the French Canadian keyboard. Windows keyboards worldwide tend to simply label the key , while Apple uses the symbol ( or ) on ISO and JIS keyboards and on ANSI US keyboards. History The Commodore 64 (made in 1982) had only the \\"return\\" key. On IBM's 3270 and 5250 line of terminals, the Enter key was located to the right of the space bar and was used to send the contents of the terminal's buffer to the host computer. The Return key was located in a more standard location and was used to generate a new line. Apple also took advantage of this situation to create an editable command line environment called a \\"Worksheet\\" in the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop, where return was used strictly as a formatting key while enter was used to execute a shell command or series of commands in direct mode. This strict dichotomy has since been relaxed, so that now there are very few situations within macOS where enter and return are not equivalent. One example of this continued division of use is the type tool in Adobe Photoshop, where the return key produces a new line while the enter key ends editing mode. Another is Mathematica, where the Return key creates a new line, while the Enter key (or Shift-Return) submits the current command for execution. Historically, many computer models did not have a separate keypad, and only had one button to function as Enter or Return. For example, the Commodore 64 (manufactured from 1982) had only the \\"Return\\" key. Most laptop computers continue in this combined tradition. Before computers, on electric typewriters the \\"Return\\" key was kept comparatively large. This is due to the frequency of usage (which also includes the space bar), and therefore, is kept large to reduce the likelihood of finger slips.

Likewise, legacy items such as the No.8 Mk 1 Rifle, No. 1 Mk 3 6 Inch Beehive Demolition Chargehttp://www.chemringenergetics.com/~/media/Files/C/Chemring- Energetics-V2/documents/Datasheets%200216/Beehive%20Feb%2016%202pp.pdf and No. 14 Mk 1 11lb Hayrick Demolition Charge that were given designations under the old numerical system continued to be referred to by those designations until replacement. Royal Navy weapons systems are designated by \\"N\\" (\\"N\\" standing for Naval Service), though in many cases weapons with L number designations continue to be referred to as such. Similar designation systems are used by various other militaries; for example, Canada uses \\"C\\" (\\"C\\" standing for Canadian), Australia uses \\"F\\" (\\"F\\" standing for Forces), and the United States of America use \\"M\\" (\\"M\\" standing for Model).

Life She was the second daughter and youngest child born to King Lysimachus and Nicaea of Macedon. Arsinoe I had two older siblings: a brother called Agathocles and a sister called Eurydice. Arsinoe's paternal grandfather was Agathocles of Pella,Lysimachus‚Äô article at Livius.org a nobleman who was a contemporary to King Philip II of Macedon who reigned 359-336 BC, while her maternal grandfather was the powerful Regent Antipater.Lightman, A to Z of ancient Greek and Roman women, p.233 Arsinoe I was named in honor of an unnamed grandmother,Ptolemaic Genealogy: Arsinoe I, Footnote 3 who may have been the mother of Lysimachus or the mother of Nicaea whose both names of these women are unknown. Little is known of her life prior to her marriage. =Queen= Between 289/88 and 281 BC,Ptolemaic Genealogy: Arsinoe I Arsinoe became the first wife of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, pharaoh of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, who was also her distant maternal cousin. Arsinoe I married Ptolemy II as part of an alliance between her father and Ptolemy II, against Seleucus I Nicator. Arsinoe was, by marriage, Queen of the Ptolemaic Kingdom. Arsinoe bore Ptolemy II three children; two sons: Ptolemy III Euergetes, Lysimachus of Egypt and a daughter called Berenice.Ptolemaic Genealogy: Arsinoe I, Footnote 7 At an unknown date between after 279-274/3 BC, the sister of Ptolemy II, who is known as Arsinoe II, arrived in Egypt. She was the last wife of Lysimachus and had fled from her half-brother and husband Ptolemy Keraunos. Probably at the instigation of Arsinoe II, charges of conspiring to assassinate Ptolemy II were soon brought against Arsinoe. As a result of the charges, Ptolemy II convicted Arsinoe of plotting against him. He repudiated her then exiled her to Coptos in Upper Egypt. It is chronologically plausible that these events were also connected to the banishment of Ptolemy II's niece Theoxena, as Theoxena was sent to the Thebaid,Ptolemaic Genealogy: Theoxena, Footnote 6 perhaps to Coptos as well. Afterwards, Ptolemy II married his sister, Arsinoe II, and after her death, his children with Arsinoe were officially regarded as the children of Arsinoe II. =Later life= Arsinoe I lived in exile for twenty years. During her exile, she lived in great splendour and enjoyed considerable privilege, since she was the former wife of a pharaoh. Her first son with Ptolemy II succeeded his father after his death. A surviving stele has been found at Coptos which refers to Arsinoe I.

Another piece of surviving evidence connected to Arsinoe I is a Phoenician inscription found at Lapithos, Cyprus,, Footnote 9 which is dated in the 11th or 12th year in the reign of Ptolemy II. The inscription refers to a sacrifice instituted by Yatonba‚Äôal on behalf of \\"the legitimate scion and his wife\\", hence refers to Arsinoe I. As Arsinoe I was disgraced as a traitor, the fact the person who did the sacrifice on her behalf strongly suggests that the news of her disgrace had not yet reached him.

Life O'Hanlon was born in 1947 in Dorset, England. He was educated at Marlborough College and then Oxford University. After taking his M.Phil. in nineteenth-century English studies in 1971 he was elected senior scholar, and in 1974 Alistair Horne Research Fellow, at St Antony's College, Oxford. He completed his doctoral thesis, Changing scientific concepts of nature in the English novel, 1850‚Äì1920, in 1977. Though very religious when he was young, O'Hanlon became a militant atheist upon his discovery of the works of Charles Darwin.\\" He had been very religious as a boy ‚Äî 'You have to be to survive being brought up in a vicarage' ‚Äî but he became, on discovering Darwin at 14, not merely an agnostic, but a militant atheist, much to his father's distress. They still don't talk about it. His mother, he says, is also very religious but in an emotional way: 'She believes that in heaven she will be reunited with every spaniel she has ever owned.' While O'Hanlon was away in Africa, his older brother, a book rep, took Belinda and the children to communion. O'Hanlon was shocked, but 'I decided not to be angry about it. A real atheist, you see, is not exercised about it.' \\" Lynn Barber interviewing O'Hanlon, 'Carry On Up the Congo', The Observer, 13 October 1996, The Observer Review Page, Pg. 7. From 1970‚Äì74, O'Hanlon was a member of the literature panel of the Arts Council of Great Britain. He was elected a member of the Society for the Bibliography of Natural History in 1982, a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1984 and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1993. For fifteen years he was the natural history editor of the Times Literary Supplement. O'Hanlon has become known for his journeys into some of the most remote jungles of the world, in Borneo, the Amazon basin and Congo. He has also written a harrowing account of a trip to the North Atlantic on a trawler. Between September 2009 and May 2010, Redmond O'Hanlon was a guest and co-presenter on the programme Beagle: In Darwin's wake for both Canvas in Belgium and VPRO Television in the Netherlands. In the programme, the clipper Stad Amsterdam re-traced the route that Charles Darwin took aboard (1831‚Äì36), a journey that played a seminal role in his thinking on evolution. He attended the Science & Technology Summit at the World Forum Convention Center in The Hague on 18 November 2010. Fellow Beagle shipmate Sarah Darwin was another featured guest at this convention. In November 2011 VPRO Television began broadcasting O'Hanlons helden (English: O'Hanlon's heroes). In this eight-part series O'Hanlon introduces the viewer to his heroes of the nineteenth century. The programme was awarded with the prestigious Dutch television award, De Zilveren Nipkowschijf (English: The Silver Nipkow disk).

This term is most commonly used in regards to property and is a land-backed asset. This legal tradition holds that whoever occupies property and uses it for its friendly function has the right to possess it.Emerging Terrains ROP Examples Several examples have been given of the right of : * A business buys a vehicle and obtains financing. The company purchasing the vehicle becomes the registered owner and has both possession and right of possession. The financial organization providing financing would become the lienholder and have a security interest that, upon default, would ripen into a right of retention (ius retentionis). If the business that bought the vehicle then rented it to someone, that individual would then have possession but would not have right of possession. The company renting the vehicle to them could repossess the vehicle, for example, if they hold the vehicle past the contract period. Also, if the rental company missed payments to the lienholder, the lienholder could repossess the vehicle from the person having possession as well. * I purchase a pen at a store. I have all three attributes (possession, right of possession and right of property). If I loan the pen to someone, they have only possession. If they fail to give it back, they conceivably could have all three, if I was unable to find them, since it is unlikely it would be possible for me to prove that an inexpensive item such as a pen was borrowed and not returned. * An owner of residential rental property wants a property management company to manage the property and to handle the necessary legal matters in the event an eviction (unlawful detainer) is necessary. So that the owner does not have to be personally named as the plaintiff in the unlawful detainer lawsuit, the property management contract includes an assignment of the right of possession so that the property management company may be the named plaintiff in the unlawful detainer action.

He was born and died in St. Petersburg. He has been called the master of one work, for it took 20 years to complete his magnum opus The Appearance of Christ Before the People. Biography Early Years and Education = Alexander Andreyevich was born to an art professor Andrey Ivanov. Aged 11, he entered the Imperial Academy of Arts and studied at his father's course together with Karl Briullov. For his good achievements he was awarded with two silver medals, in 1824 he received a golden medal for the painting 'Priam Asking Achilles to Return Hector's Body'. In 1827 he was honoured with the Big Gold Medal of the Imperial Academy of Arts for 'Joseph interprets the butler's and the baker's dreams' and was promoted to the XIV grade artists. Ivanov's benefactors decided to send him abroad to study art, but required one more picture, thus he creates 'Bellerophon sent to a campaign against the Chimera'. In 1830 Ivanov departs to Europe, first in Germany, then to Italy. = Italian Years = Ivanov's first works in Rome were copies of The Creation of Adam of the Sistine Chapel and some drafts of Biblical scenes. He dreamed to create an epic painting of the Messiah coming to people, but first he decided to try himself on lesser scale picture. In 1834-1835 he finished 'Appearance of Jesus Christ to Maria Magdalena'. The painting had great success both in Rome and St Petersburg. The Russian Imperial Academy of Arts granted Ivanov an honorary academic degree in 1836. He spent most of his life in Rome where he befriended Gogol and was influenced by the Nazarenes.  The Appearance of Christ Before the People  Ivanov spent 20 years (1837‚Äì1857) in Rome, working on his greatest masterpiece 'The Appearance of Christ Before the People'. = Influence and Critics = Critical judgement about Ivanov improved in the following generation. Some of the numerous sketches he had prepared for The Appearance have been recognized as masterpieces in their own right. The most comprehensive collection of his works can be viewed at the Russian Museum in St. Petersburg.

The route of the proposed line would use tracks owned by CSX Transportation and the Union Pacific Railroad.Metra New Starts site on proposed SouthEast Service Past commuter service Formerly, the Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad and the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad operated commuter service on this line out of Dearborn Station to Dolton and Momence, respectively. The Chicago and Eastern Illinois commuter line to Momence ended in 1935, while the Chicago and Western Indiana service to Dolton was discontinued in 1964. Proposal The building of a line from Chicago to the south suburbs ending at Balmoral Park has been discussed as early as 1986. In 2003, Metra officials proposed the SouthEast Service at the insistence of Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr. that the south suburbs be included as part of Metra's larger request for federal dollars after they were largely excluded from the proposed STAR Line. Its northern terminus would be LaSalle Street Station in downtown Chicago. The line would then traverse Chicago's southern neighborhoods and its southern and far southern suburbs to Balmoral Park south of Crete, Illinois. Its average daily ridership was projected to be 9000. A fleet of Diesel Multiple Units (DMUs) has been proposed for this service. In 2005, the SouthEast Service received initial funding authorization. In 2010, Al Riley became the chief sponsor of House Bill 1644 which created the Southeast Commuter Rail Transit District as a municipal corporation under Illinois state law. The district created has the right of eminent domain to acquire private property which is necessary for the purposes of the district and the power to contract for public mass transportation with Metra. The district includes Crete, Steger, South Chicago Heights, Chicago Heights, Glenwood, Thornton, South Holland, Dolton, Calumet City, Lansing, and Lynwood. The bill was signed into law by Governor Pat Quinn on March 8, 2011. According to the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning's ONTO 2050 regionally significant projects benefit report published in October 2018, the SouthEast Service is undergoing alternatives analysis and the identification of a Locally Preferred Alternative is in process. In 2019, the SouthEast Service was included in a Cost Benefit Analysis by Metra as a Tier 2 project. The Center for Neighborhood Technology, an advocate for the new line, estimates that the SouthEast Service would more than double the number of average jobs accessible by transit in sixty minutes for the south suburbs on the line. In a 2016 letter to the editor, Martin J. Oberman, while the Chairman of Metra, supported the SouthEast Service. =Proposed stations= From north to south: * LaSalle Street Station * 35th Street * Gresham * 115th Street * Dolton * South Holland. In 2012 South Holland spent $1.3 million to purchase land at 236 East 161st Place for the station. * Thornton * Glenwood. According to the 2010 Village of Glenwood Station Area Plan, potential station locations in Glenwood include a station located mid‚Äêway between Main and Center Streets along Young Street. * Chicago Heights. As of 2012, Chicago Heights has been assembling land for the creation of a station near its downtown. * South Chicago Heights. According to their 2008 Comprehensive Plan, the station would be located near the intersection of Sauk Trail and Jackson Avenue. * Steger * Crete * Balmoral Park  References  Category:Metra Category:Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad Category:Railway lines in Chicago Category:Proposed railway lines in Illinois ","title":"SouthEast Service"},{"id":"2009832","title":"Lance Guest"},{"id":"2009839","text":"Ohio's 2nd congressional district. Detailed map of Ohio's 2nd congressional district.On August 2, 2005, elections were held in Ohio's 2nd congressional district to choose a United States Representative to replace Rob Portman, who had resigned his seat in April to become United States Trade Representative. Jean Schmidt, the Republican Party candidate, defeated Democrat Paul Hackett, in a surprisingly close election as the district has not elected a Democrat since Tom Luken won a 1974 special election.  Background on the district  The district is the 57th most Republican congressional district in the nation by the reckoning of the Cook Political Report. It stretches along the Ohio River from the Hamilton County suburbs of Cincinnati east to Scioto County, and includes all of Adams, Brown Pike, and Clermont counties and parts of Hamilton, Scioto and Warren counties. It includes all of the Warren County municipalities of Lebanon, South Lebanon, Loveland, Maineville, Morrow, Butlerville, and Pleasant Plain, and parts of the municipalities of Mason and Blanchester. All of Union, Hamilton, Harlan, Salem, and Washington Townships were in the district, as well as parts of Turtlecreek Township immediately adjacent to the city of Lebanon, and southern Deerfield Township. The Hamilton County municipalities of Sharonville, Blue Ash, Deer Park, Loveland, Madeira, Newtown, Terrace Park, and Indian Hill were in the district, along with eastern parts of Cincinnati. All of Anderson and Symmes Townships and parts of Sycamore Township and the city of Springdale are also in the district. The district (known as the First District before 1982) has been in Republican hands for all but nine years since 1879. The last Democrat to win a full term in this district was Jack Gilligan in 1964. No Democrat had held the seat since Thomas A. Luken's narrow loss to Willis D. Gradison in 1974. Since Luken's defeat, no Democrat had won more than 40% of the vote in the general election. Portman won the seat in a 1993 special election with 77 percent of the vote. In six subsequent campaigns he never received less than 70 percent. Republican primaryCandidates= *Jean Schmidt, former Ohio State Representative *Bob McEwen, former U.S. Congressman *Tom Brinkman, Ohio State Representative *Pat DeWine, Hamilton County Commissioner and son of Senator Mike DeWine *Eric Minamyer, attorney *Peter A. Fossett, teacher *Tom Bemmes, former local Board of Education member *Jeff Morgan, mailman *David Smith, financial analyst *Steve Austin, retired teacher *Douglas Mink, teacher =DeWine faces questions over his family= DeWine amassed a campaign treasury larger than all his rivals combined, raising over $750,000. He was helped by his father, thousands coming from the political action committees associated with Republican colleagues of his father, such as Mississippi Senator Trent Lott. McEwen was dependent on his own money, contributing $250,000 to his campaign. Schmidt also made significant contributions to her campaign. DeWine's father was also a hindrance to the campaign. Never the most conservative of Republican senators, DeWine angered supporters of President George W. Bush by his participation in a deal to avoid the \\"nuclear option\\" to filibusters on Bush's nominees to federal courts. Pat DeWine told the press had he been in Congress, he would not have supported his father's compromise. More damaging to DeWine were the questions raised about his personal life. In 2004, he had faced incumbent John Dowlin in the March primary for the Republican nomination to be county commissioner. Dowlin had run ads calling attention to DeWine leaving his pregnant wife and their two children for a mistress working as a lobbyist. Though Dowlin lost, the issue was resurrected by DeWine's rivals in 2005. McEwen and Schmidt made it a point in their stump speeches to emphasize how long they had been married to their spouses, Schmidt declaring \\"I am a woman of character who has been married for twenty-nine years.\\" =DeWine focuses on McEwen= DeWine focused his attention on the most experienced candidate, Bob McEwen. DeWine said McEwen had \\"wasted taxpayers' money\\" by having the most expensive Congressional office of any Ohio member of the U.S. House. DeWine criticized McEwen's bouncing of 166 checks on the House bank, a major factor in his 1992 defeat. And DeWine tried to depict McEwen as a carpetbagger, asking in television advertisements \\"If Bob McEwen really cares about us, why has he spent the last twelve years living in Virginia?\\" McEwen denied he has bounced any checks, repeating what he had claimed in 1992 and insisted that he had continued to reside in Ohio since he lost his re-election bid, that he had never voted in Virginia nor held a Virginia drivers license. DeWine also questioned McEwen's record on taxes, sending out mailings criticizing McEwen's vote on May 24, 1982, in the 97th Congress \\"in support of a Democrat budget that raised out taxes by $233 billion.\\" Two mailings focused on this issue, one featuring a photograph of Ronald Reagan which was captioned \\"When President Reagan Needed Votes to Keep Taxes Low, Bob McEwen Said 'NO'\\", the other asking \\"Are We Still the Party of Lower Taxes?\\" which noted DeWine supports Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell's amendment to the Ohio Constitution to limit spending increases and had a photo of DeWine and Blackwell together. =McEwen responds to DeWine= McEwen ran television ads that lamented DeWine's \\"desperate, untrue attacks\\" but did not attempt to refute them, instead focusing on how he would continue to advance the idea of Ronald Reagan. To emphasize his connection to Reagan, McEwen brought Reagan aide and Attorney General Edwin Meese to Ohio to speak on how important McEwen had been in advancing Reagan's legislative agenda. McEwen also emphasized his return to Congress would mean he would enter not as a freshman but as a seventh termer, thus entitling him to better committee assignments. However, spokesmen for Ohio's Deborah Pryce, chairman of the House Republican Conference, the body which decides such matters, denied McEwen would automatically get his former seniority back. On the issues, McEwen emphasized his pro-life stance and support for immigration reform. One mailing he sent had a picture of 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta's visa captioned \\"Shocking: All of the 9/11 murderers had visas issued to them by the U.S. State Department\\" and called for \\"a military presence on the Mexican and Canadian borders.\\" McEwen had high-profile endorsements from Focus on the Family leader James Dobson, former United States Attorney General Edwin Meese, Cincinnati Bengals player Anthony Mu√±oz, American Family Association president Donald Wildmon, Citizens for Community Values anti-pornography crusader Phil Burress, and former New York congressman and 1996 vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp, who came to the district to campaign for him. =Attacks on Schmidt= Jean Schmidt was criticized in ads paid for by the Club for Growth, the Washington, D.C.-based group associated with Grover Norquist which campaigns for lower taxes and actively works for the defeat of Republicans it considers insufficiently conservative. The Club's ads noted Schmidt had voted in favor of Governor Taft's 20 percent increase in the state sales tax and increases in the state budget. The Club compared her unfavorably to Tom Brinkman, who was hailed in the ad as \\"Honest. Conservative. Leader.\\" The Ohio Taxpayers Association disputed the Club's ad. Its president told The Cincinnati Enquirer that Schmidt had \\"a pretty good record\\" in Columbus and that the OTA's political action committee had endorsed her. In her campaign, Schmidt ran on a conservative platform. In one mailing to voters, she promised to \\"reduce our taxes\\", \\"keep our nation safe\\", advocated \\"a responsible energy policy\\", and for \\"promoting family values.\\" The tag line on the mailer was \\"continuing a tradition of character and leadership.\\" Schmidt's campaign literature noted her pro-life voting record, her opposition to gay marriage, her high ratings from the National Rifle Association, and that she \\"opposes an activist court system that acts against our conservative values.\\" Her literature also featured her endorsement by Phil Fulton, a pastor who fought the court ordered removal of tablets containing the Ten Commandments from the grounds of schools in Adams County. =Results=The Democratic PrimaryCandidates= *Paul Hackett, attorney and former Milford City Councilman *Victoria Wulsin, doctor *Charles Sanders, former mayor of Waynesville, Democratic nominee in 1998, 2000, 2002 and 2004 *James Parker, health care administrator *Jeff Sinnard, civil engineer =The Democratic campaign= The Democratic primary attracted little attention. The obvious candidate was Charles W. Sanders, who won the nomination in the past four primaries but never got more than 28% of the vote against Portman in the general election. But Sanders, the only black candidate in either primary, had been recalled as Mayor of Waynesville when he charged the village police with racial profiling. He also faced complaints from his constituents that he spent too much time on his Congressional campaigns and meeting high Democratic officials such as Bill Clinton rather than attending to local issues. Because of redistricting, Sanders no longer lived in the Second District and had not in his last two runs against Portman. Victoria Wells Wulsin, a doctor from Indian Hill, was the head of a charity, SOTENI International, that was funding an AIDS prevention campaign in Kenya. Her platform was not one that would win many fans in the conservative Second District: pro-choice, pro-gay rights, opposing the Iraq War, and calling for the repeal of the tax cuts that George W. Bush had advocated and Congress had passed. Jeff Sinnard, a civil engineer who proudly noted he was a \\"stay-at-home dad\\", was the most conservative Democrat in the field, quoting the Bible on his web-site and expressing his opposition to gay marriage and abortion: \\"I endorse a reverence for human life and dignity from conception to natural death.\\" Many party leaders expressed their gratitude for Sanders for his past service but backed Paul Hackett, an attorney from Indian Hill. Hackett had organized the recall of a councilman in Milford in 1995 and was elected to the council in his place, serving three years. He had also just returned from a tour of duty in Iraq, having been on active duty in the Marines in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The Democratic parties in Pike, Clermont and Hamilton counties all endorsed Hackett. Sanders said that he was not concerned that party leaders were backing Hackett, telling The Cincinnati Enquirer \\"People out there know me. I may not have the money or the organization, but no one in this race will work harder.\\" =Special primary election= In his bid for Congress, Hackett was endorsed by the county Democratic parties in four of the seven counties in the district, those in Brown, Clermont, Hamilton and Pike counties. Party leaders chose to support him rather than Charles W. Sanders, the only black candidate in either primary and the Democratic nominee in 1998, 2000, 2002 and 2004. Timothy Burke, chairman of the party in Hamilton County, said \\"The blunt reality is that Charles Sanders can't win the 2nd District seat.\\" David Altman, a Cincinnati attorney who was on the party central committee, was also skeptical of Sanders, telling The Cincinnati Post \\"I don't think he has a snowball's chances of winning.\\" Many were angered by the endorsement. Todd Portune, the first Democrat elected to the Hamilton County Commission in decades, told The Post \\"That's not the Democratic Party I'm a part of,\\" saying the party should remain neutral. Victoria Wells Wulsin, a doctor from Indian Hill who ran a charity helping AIDS patients in Africa, also sought the nomination; the Hamilton County endorsement dismayed her. \\"It smacks of weapons of mass destruction,\\" she told The Post. Other candidates running were Jeff Sinnard, a civil engineer from Anderson Township, and the most conservative Democrat; James John Parker, a hospital administrator from Pike County; and Arthur Stanley Katz, a lawyer originally from New York City who had retired to Mason, who ran as a write-in candidate. Hackett was also endorsed by labor unions: the United Auto Workers, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the Greater Cincinnati Building and Construction Trades Council. The Dayton Daily News endorsed Hackett in the Democratic primary, calling him an \\"articulate, down-to-earth exponent of moderate Democratic views.\\" The Cincinnati Enquirer also endorsed Hackett in the primary. The newspaper editorialized \\"he is not an ideologue, but someone willing to listen to different points of view and to act on the basis of what he believes will best serve his constituents.\\" It also called attention to his leading a recall against members of the Milford city council and \\"his ability to take charge of a situation, whether it is a dysfunctional local government in Ohio, or setting up the basics of a civil government in a city in Iraq.\\" Hackett told The Cincinnati Enquirer that the Iraq War has not been worth the price. \\"We need to develop an exit strategy and execute it. That strategy must commit 100% of our efforts to training the 140,000 Iraqi soldiers to do the jobs that the United States is doing now. We cannot again falsely declare victory.\\" Hackett also told The Enquirer he was the best candidate because of his service in Iraq. Hackett won the Democratic nomination with over half the vote in unofficial results. A total of 13,927 ballots were cast representing 3.05% of the 456,795 registered voters in the district and 23.4% of the 59,538 ballots cast in both primaries. =Results=General election Paul Hackett, the Democratic nominee for Congress faced Schmidt in the August 2, 2005, special election. Hackett was described by The New York Times as six foot four and \\"garrulous, profane, and quick with a barked retort or a mischievous joke\\". Hackett had organized the recall of a councilman in Milford in 1995 and was elected to the council in his place, serving three years. He had also just returned from a tour of duty in Iraq and played up his military service in the campaign. = Contesting a Republican district = John Green, a political science professor at the University of Akron told USA Today \\"It's a real steep uphill climb for Hackett. It is such a Republican district.\\" Jane S. Anderson, an adjunct professor of political science at the University of Cincinnati who has unsuccessfully run for the Cincinnati city council and the Ohio House as a Democrat, told the Associated Press :It's definitely worth it to the Democrats to put in the effort if only to keep the party energized. Even if Paul Hackett loses, it is very important for the party for him to do well. It could be seen as a sign of opportunities for Democrats in other GOP strongholds. Martin Gottlieb of the Dayton Daily News wrote a Republican landslide in the district was \\"a self-fulfilling prophecy\\": :It is so overwhelmingly Republican that Democrats typically don't make a real effort as a party. A candidate puts himself up, but generally it's somebody who has no political strengths and gets no financial contributions or volunteer help to speak of. The campaign gets little attention. And the prophecy gets fulfilled. =National attention on the race= Hackett attracted national attention to what had always been considered a safe Republican district. The New York Times ran a front-page story on him and articles appeared in USA Today and The Washington Post. USA Today wrote \\"if Democrats could design a dream candidate to capitalize on national distress about the war in Iraq, he would look a lot like the tall, telegenic Marine Reserve major who finished a seven-month tour of Iraq in March.\\" The National Republican Congressional Committee, the official Republican Party body that helps candidates for the United States House of Representatives, announced on July 28 it was spending $265,000 for television ads in the Cincinnati market, covering the western part of the district, and $250,000 for ads in the Huntington, West Virginia, market, covering the eastern half. Carl Forti told The Cincinnati Enquirer \\"we decided to bury him\\" after Hackett told USA Today, in a story published that morning, \\"I don't like the son-of-a-bitch that lives in the White House but I'd put my life on the line for him.\\" Forti said the NRCC had \\"no concern that she will lose. She will not lose.\\" The NRCC ran commercials noting Hackett had voted for tax increases while on the Milford council and quoting his statement on his website that he would be \\"happy\\" to pay higher taxes. The NRCC was silent about Schmidt's own votes to raise taxes, but the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the NRCC's counterpart, was not. The DCCC responded with commercials noting that Schmidt had voted to raise the sales tax by 20% and the excise tax on gasoline by 30% when she was in the legislature. A mailing to voters by the DCCC reiterated these statements under the headline \\"Who Voted for the Taft Sales Tax Increase--the Largest in Ohio History?\\" and asked \\"can we trust Jean Schmidt to protect middle-class families in Washington?\\" = Fundraising = After her primary win, Schmidt flew to Washington, D.C., to attend fundraisers and have a campaign commercial shot featuring her with George W. Bush. Having far more money than her opponent, she was able to afford a television campaign and distributed many large campaign signs throughout the district. However, her financial edge diminished as of late July. Hackett's limited budget had meant his campaign was limited to word of mouth, one-on-one personal campaigning, and yard signs, of which there were many, despite the strong Republican tilt of the district. One tactic to ensure his name was seen was Hackett's campaign affixing signs to all of the overpasses of I-71 in eastern Hamilton County. However, with the help of Democrats from across the nation, Hackett raised several hundred thousand dollars in the closing weeks of the campaign. One main reason Democrats have decided to rally around Hackett was that, had he won, he would have been the first veteran of the 2003 invasion of Iraq to serve in Congress. Late in the campaign Schmidt claimed Mark Kirk, Republican Congressman from Illinois was the first Congressman to serve in Iraq, but Kirk said he had never actually been on tour in Iraq. =EndorsementsState and national endorsements Schmidt won the endorsement of the National Rifle Association, which frustrated her opponent, a long-time NRA member. She also won the endorsements of the International Association of Fire Fighters, the National Federation of Independent Businesses, the National Homebuilders Association, the Ohio Taxpayers Association, the Ohio Small Business PAC, and the Ohio Farm Bureau. Local endorsements Schmidt also won the endorsements of the Southern Ohio Board of Realtors and the Fraternal Order of Police Queen City Lodge #69. The Coalition Opposed to Additional Spending and Taxes , a Cincinnati-based group founded by Tom Brinkman (who lost the GOP primary to Schmidt), began running ads in the last week of July urging voters to skip the election. COAST's president, Jim Urling, told The Cincinnati Enquirer that this might help elect Hackett, but \\"we think it will be easier to remove a Democrat next year than an incumbent Republican posing as a conservative.\\" For the general election, the Democratic Dayton Daily News endorsed Hackett. The Daily News said Schmidt's attacks on Senators Mike DeWine and George Voinovich-Schmidt had asked \\"what kind of men do we have in Washington representing us right now? One refuses to back the president and the other is crying on national television\\"-were \\"remarkably classless\\" and \\"seemed to be saying that voters who like legislators who exercise occasional independence from their party should not vote for her.\\" The Cincinnati Post also endorsed Hackett. It noted Schmidt is the latest in a line of \\"Republican patricians\\" and \\"likely to be a dependable vote for the Bush administration.\\" The Cincinnati Enquirer, a Republican paper, wrote Hackett \\"is an attractive candidate with many qualities to admire\\" but endorsed Schmidt. The Enquirer conceded Schmidt \\"has a troubling tendency to offer superficial answers on issues she may not have carefully studied. Some of her comments can lack tact, and she relies too often on anecdotal evidence to prove a point,\\" but endorsed her: :Schmidt knows the district very well, having almost a \\"file-card\\" memory to recall details about people, places and issues she's had experience with on the local level . . . she's a quick learner who knows how to make deals and get things done. Even in her relatively short time in Columbus, she proved effective in passing legislation to address her district's concerns. = Controversies= Controversy arose over whether Schmidt had failed to list gifts received when she was in the Ohio General Assembly on her financial disclosure statements. Another controversy was her ties to Tom Noe, a major player in the Coingate scandal. Schmidt initially denied ever meeting Noe, but Hackett produced minutes of a 2002 Ohio Board of Regents meeting attended by Schmidt. Noe was a member of the board at the time. = Election night = The election was given major national attention by the television networks and other observers despite its restricted locality. Throughout the night, as returns came in, political watchers and bloggers zeroed in on the election as an indicator of American political opinion shifts. Many predictions were made everywhere, but as this district had always been a Republican stronghold, most projected a Schmidt win, even though polling was showing the race was getting tight. =Results= After the election Implications for Ohio elections Following the election, many Democrats hailed the election as showing the weakness of Ohio's Republican party, which has been in control of Ohio state government for a decade, and public unhappiness with President Bush's policies. Hamilton County Democratic chairman Timothy Burke was delighted. \\"Paul was very critical of this president in a district that Bush carried easily last November, yet she barely hung on to win. There's a clear signal in that,\\" he told The Cincinnati Post on election night. The Clermont County Democratic chairman, Dave Lane, told the Dayton Daily News \\"Here we are in the reddest of red districts and it was very, very close.\\" The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee claimed in a press release Hackett's strong showing meant trouble for Mike Dewine's reelection campaign in 2006, especially since his son Pat had lost the Republican primary for the seat. Ohio Republican Party political director Jason Mauk said: \\"\\"To the extent that voters in that district were sending a message to the Republican Party at the state or national level, we have heard that message and we will continue to listen to their concerns.\\" Peter W. Bronson, a conservative columnist for The Cincinnati Enquirer, wrote \\"Hackett's surprising finish was less a repudiation of Bush than a repudiation of Ohio Governor Bob Taft, whose name is now officially radioactive poison.\\" Bronson admitted Hackett \\"ran a strong campaign\\" but said he did so well only because of \\"the ugly primary\\" on the Republican side, fears that Schmidt was \\"another Taft RINO\\" (i.e. \\"Republican in name only\\") and apathy by Republican voters, not dissatisfaction with Bush or Republicans in general. John Nichols of the Madison Capital Times in Wisconsin saw it differently. \\"The district had been so radically gerrymandered by Republican governors and legislators that it was all-but- unimaginable that a Democrat could ever be competitive there\\" and that Hackett, \\"a smart telegenic Iraq War veteran\\", had been \\"swiftboated\\" in the final days of the campaign by \\"Republican operatives and right-wing talk radio hosts\\". As a measure, perhaps, of both Schmidt's unpopularity, and a growing anti-Republican trend in Ohio due to the unpopularity of Bush and Ohio Governor Bob Taft, Schmidt defeated Victoria Wells Wulsin, the second-place finished in the 2005 Democratic primary, by an even smaller margin than that by which she had defeated Hackett in 2005. In addition, Democrats swept the statewide races for US Senate, governor and lieutenant governor, attorney general, state treasurer and state auditor, while winning the seat of former Republican congressman Bob Ney in Ohio's 18th District. Republicans did manage to win closely contested races in Ohio's 1st, 2nd and 15th Districts.  Implications for national elections  The DSCC also claimed that \\"If Ohio is a bellwether state for next year's midterm elections, things don't look too good for the Republicans.\\" Republicans said the election meant nothing of the sort. \\"There is no correlation between what happens in a special election, where turnout is very low and you have circumstances that just aren't comparable to an election that happens on an Election Day in an election year,\\" Brian Nick of the National Republican Senatorial Committee told The Cincinnati Post. The Columbus Dispatch referred to \\"the trauma of barely winning a Congressional district long dominated by Republicans\\" and quoted an anonymous source in the Republican party claiming \\"there is not a tougher environment in the country than Ohio right now. There is kind of a meltdown happening.\\" Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report told the Dispatch \\"Ohio becomes the microcosm for the debate Democrats are trying to have nationally\\" and Democrats would argue in future campaigns \\"'See what happens when one party rules too long, see what happens with corruption and insider influence.'\\" Her boss, Charlie Cook, told the Los Angeles Times Hackett's \\"rubber stamp\\" charge had resonated with Ohio voters. Mark Steyn, a conservative Canadian columnist, wrote in the Irish Times \\"Paul Hackett was like a fast-forward version of the John Kerry campaign\\" who \\"artfully neglected to mention the candidate was a Democrat.\\" Steyn claimed that Democratic efforts to present Hackett's run as a success for the party were absurd. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich warned Republicans that the election was a warning sign for the 2006 midterms and that while they should not yet panic, they should \\"think\\" before it was too late. Ultimately the Democrats would make significant gains in the 2006 midterm elections, gaining 30 seats in the U.S. House and six in the Senate, and gaining control of both chambers.

Cochran (born 1953) is an American anthropologist and author who argues that cultural innovation resulted in new and constantly shifting selection pressures for genetic change, thereby accelerating human evolution and divergence between human races. From 2004 to 2015, he was a research associate at the anthropology department at the University of Utah. He is co- author of the book The 10,000 Year Explosion.  Human evolution  In opposition to what he sees as the conventional wisdom that civilization has been a static environment which imposed stabilizing selection on humans, Cochran, along with like-minded anthropologists such as John D. Hawks, contends that haplotype and other data indicate the selection of genes has been strongest since the advent of farming and civilization. = Ashkenazi Jewish intelligence = Cochran and co-authors Jason Hardy and Henry Harpending suggest that the high average IQ of Ashkenazi Jews may be attributed to natural selection for intelligence during the Middle Ages and a low rate of genetic inflow. Cochran and his colleagues hypothesize that the occupational profile of the Jewish community in medieval Europe had resulted in selection pressure for mutations that increase intelligence, but can also result in hereditary neurological disorders. Cochran was featured in an episode of the Norwegian television show Hjernevask (in english: \\"Brainwash\\") in which he discusses race and intelligence, using Ashkenazi intelligence as compared to the rest of the Israeli jewish population as an example of differences between groups. = Pathogenic infections as a cause of disease = In 2000, Cochran and evolutionary biologist Paul W. Ewald co-authored a paper in which they proposed that most human diseases were the result of pathogenic infections (viruses, bacteria, parasites). They argue that most fitness reducing diseases should be eliminated through natural selection, but since germs can evolve faster than humans, they are a likely culprit. Cochran and Ewald point to stomach ulcers, which were once thought to be caused by a variety of environmental factors such as smoking, diet and drugs, but were later attributed to bacteria.  Pathogenic hypothesis of homosexuality  Cochran has argued that homosexuality may be considered a disease because it generally reduces or eliminates reproductive output, and he and Ewald have speculated that homosexuality might be caused by infection by an unknown virus. However, he does not suggest that the infectious agent that causes homosexuality is spread by homosexuals. Cochran's hypothesis is based on the argument that homosexuality is unlikely to be genetic because it does not follow simple Mendelian inheritance patterns and because natural selection should have largely eliminated genes that cause homosexuality. Cochran says that there is no positive evidence for the gay germ hypothesis. In 1999, journalist Caleb Crain published an article in the gay magazine Out in which he spoke with several sexual orientation researchers about the hypothesis. Geneticist Dean Hamer called it an \\"interesting idea\\" which would need to be tested by experimentation, but that he was skeptical about finding evidence since it homosexuality doesn't appear in clusters. J. Michael Bailey was skeptical of how research to test the hypothesis could even be carried out, but reportedly gives Cochran the \\"benefit of the doubt\\". Bailey also said that if the hypothesis was true, calling it a disease would be an ‚Äúillegitimate conclusion\\", since not all traits caused by pathogens are diseases, and said that if some form of genius was caused by an infection, the same conclusion would not be drawn. Elaine F. Walker, who has carried out research tying schizophrenia with a pathogenic infection during prenatal development, said that Cochran's hypothesis \\"doesn‚Äôt seem very likely\\" and it didn't seem to match the etiology of schizophrenia. Most researchers in mainstream biology believe sexual orientation likely results from complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and non-social environmental factors. Examples include the fraternal birth order effect related to male sexual orientation; a progressive immunization of the mother against male specific cells that play a role in fetal brain synapse masculinization, for which biochemical evidence has been found. An epigenetic model for homosexuality as a result of prenatal environment was proposed by three evolutionary biologists (Rice et al.) in 2012, and accounts for fitness costs, noting a host of reproductive fitness reducing traits associated with genitalia which persist at rates similar to, or higher than, exclusive homosexual orientation. In a 2017 commentary, the biologists write that \\"one of the most counterintuitive results\\" from their model of homosexuality was that the epi-marks responsible for homosexuality should always be favoured in the fetus, because in most offspring, they canalize sexual development and protect the fetus from fitness-reducing intersex phenotypes. However, sometimes unerased epimarks expressed in the brain could pass from a mother to son which would effect sex differentiation of the fetal brain, resulting in homosexuality. Evolutionary ecologist Aldo Poiani said that the pathogenic hypothesis should \\"not be dismissed without proper testing\\", but that it seems contradicted by birth order effects, a consistent low rate of homosexuality across populations and the absence of parent-child transmission.

Ward in his directorial debut, starring Nick Nolte and Debra Winger. The movie is adapted from John Steinbeck's novels Cannery Row (1945) and Sweet Thursday (1954). Plot The story is about the skid row denizens of Monterey, California, during World War II. As declining fish stocks are shutting down a previously rich fishery and the dependent canning industry, bums and prostitutes lead colorful and adventurous lives in a balmy seaside setting. Doc, a self-employed marine biologist, lives in a dockside warehouse and researches octopi. Suzy DeSoto, a girl from the local bordello, is working there only out of necessity. A collection of linked vignettes describes life on Cannery Row. It is depicted as an impoverished area inhabited by a motley band of people who have experienced failures, but somehow have found their niche and a community of strangely kindred souls. Doc and Suzy don‚Äôt quite fit in, but are accepted. Mac and the boys gather frogs and sell them to give a surprise party for Doc, which turns into a brawl and breaks the tank housing Doc's octopus collection. To make amends, they buy Doc a present of a microscope but mistakenly get him a telescope, instead. A deeper mystery revolves around why Doc stays in Cannery Row. Suzy discovers that Doc was once a professional baseball pitcher but quit. Another character, the Seer, spends his days playing his horn. He depends on the gifts that mysteriously appear, such as groceries. Suzy eventually learns that the Seer is a former baseball player whom Doc injured with a pitch to the head, and now Doc takes care of him. Doc and Suzy ultimately find love.

ReceptionCritical reception= In his two-and-a-half star review, film critic Roger Ebert wrote of the film: \\"The movie is almost always good to look at, thanks to Richard MacDonald's sets (he linked together two giant sound stages) and Sven Nykvist's photography. And Nolte and Winger are almost able to make their relationship work, if only it didn't seem scripted out of old country songs and lonely hearts columns. It's tough to pull off a movie like this, in the semi-cynical 1980s (it would have been impossible in the truly cynical seventies). I guess we no longer believe in the essential heroism of the little guy, and in the proposition that anyone can succeed with a little luck.\\"Ebert, Roger. Chicago Sun-Times film review, January 1, 1982. Accessed: June 22, 2013. MGM head of production David Begelman later said he should not have greenlighted the film, saying it \\"was beyond the reach of the filmmaker to realise the wonderful, wonderful values he had in a brilliant script.\\" ReferencesExternal links  * * Film trailer.

Bullrings are often associated with the Iberian Peninsula, but they can also be found through Iberian America and in a few Spanish and Portuguese ex-colonies in Africa. Bullrings are often historic and culturally significant centres that bear many structural similarities to the Roman amphitheatre.  Common structure  The classic bullring is an enclosed, roughly circular amphitheatre with tiered rows of stands that surround an open central space. The open space forms the arena or ruedo, a field of densely packed crushed rock (albero) that is the stage for the bullfight. Also on the ground level, the central arena is surrounded by a staging area where the bullfighters prepare and take refuge, called the callej√≥n (alley). The callej√≥n is separated from the arena by a wall or other structure, usually made of wood and roughly 140 cm high. The partition wall has doors for the entrance and exit of the bull (puerta de los toriles) and human participants (puerta de cuadrilla), although the form, number, and placement of these doors will vary from one bullring to another. In regular places, the wall is pushed outwards leaving splits (burladero, from burlar: to evade, to dodge) that allow the bullfighters to go in the arena and to take refuge but are too narrow for the bull. Nevertheless, on rare occasions the bull jumps the wall causing havoc in the corridor. The walls also have a type of stirrup or foothold that aids in crossing over to the central arena, and sometimes stirrups on the arena side as well; these are used mostly by event staff if they need to intervene quickly in the case of an emergency. The arena is surrounded by climbing rows of seats. The seats are priced differently according to the position of the sun during the show, normally in the afternoon. The hot sol, \\"sun\\", is cheaper than the fresher sombra, \\"shade\\".  Architectural origins  Bullrings evolved as specialized sporting arenas hand-in-hand with the sport that demanded them. Many of the ancient Roman amphitheatres had characteristics that can be seen in the bullrings of today (in fact the ring in N√Æmes, France, is a Roman artifact, though it is more elliptical than the usual plaza), and the origin of bullfighting is very closely related to certain Roman traditions; in the formative years of the sport on the Iberian Peninsula, those Roman enclosures were not commonly utilised for bullfighting events. Back when bullfighting festivals were conducted principally on horseback, the spectacle was a more public affair that took place in the city's open plaza area. It was only later, when bullfights were conducted principally by men on foot, that the public needed a structure to house them appropriately. Not only did the crowd need special seating to view the spectacle, they also needed a structure to contain the general disorder that reigned at festivals during the heyday of such legendary figures as Costillares, Pedro Romero, and Pepe-Hillo. In these early days, the circular form was not to be taken for granted. When La Maestranza bullring in Seville was authorized for construction in 1730 specifically to house bullfights, the original plans called for a rectangular arena for the first three years, only later to be changed to a circular form that avoided the cornering of the action and put all viewers at the same approximate distance, the same reason for the elliptical form of amphitheatres. Another circular plaza was begun in Ronda in 1754, and it featured its first bullfights in 1782. In the change from the 19th to the 20th century, the Neo-Mud√©jar style became in vogue for plazas, involving decoration in visible brickwork. Since the 1990s, new construction technology allows some rings to be covered permanently or temporarily. Alternative uses The primary purpose of the ring is bullfighting, but it is usually limited to some festival weeks in the year. In other times, it may be used as a concert venue as in the Rock en el ruedo tour of Miguel R√≠os or the live record Diamonds & Rust in the Bullring, featuring a Joan Baez concert in the Bilbao plaza. Before the diffusion of modern sports premises, bullrings were used in the Basque Country for traditional sports similar to challenges of resistance running. The public made bets on the number of laps the runner could make. No bulls were involved. After the battle of Badajoz (1936) of the Spanish Civil War, the Badajoz ring was used as a confinement camp for supporters of the republic and many thousands were executed there by the Nationalist forces who had just occupied the town. Most indoor bullrings, especially in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America, in addition to being used for concerts, have also been used for indoor sports such as basketball, ice hockey, boxing and lucha libre.  Bullrings of the world  The most famous bullrings in the world are Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas in Madrid (Spain), widely regarded as the most prestigious one, La Maestranza in Seville (Spain), and Plaza de Toros M√©xico in Mexico City. =EuropeFrance *The Arena of N√Æmes, N√Æmes *The arena in Arles *The arena in Al√®s *The arena in Mont de Marsan *The arena in Bouillargues *The arena in Trebes *The arena in Vauvert *There are also arenas in an important part of small villages of Camargue Villages round the Camargue, such as Rodilhan in the Gard, who also practise 'mise √† mort' - killing the bull.

They are best known for the Microwave wavetable synthesizer and Blofeld virtual analogue synthesizer.  History  Waldorf Electronics GmbH was founded in 1988 by Wolfgang D√ºren, who at the time was the German distributor of PPG. The Waldorf name refers to the German town Waldorf (near to the former capital of West Germany: Bonn) where the company was founded. Later, the company was headquartered in Schloss Ahrenthal. On 5 February 2004, Waldorf declared insolvency at a German court. Shortly before, the company was turned into an Aktiengesellschaft called Waldorf Music AG, but to no avail. In Summer 2006, a new company Waldorf Music GmbH was officially established, although it is not a legal successor to the original company.http://www.waldorf-music.info/en/ Waldorf's headquarter has now moved to Remagen and is led by CEO Joachim Flor. After the demise of PPG in 1987, Waldorf took over the heritage of the wavetable synthesis. Based on an ASIC designed by Wolfgang Palm, the Microwave and later, the WAVE, were built. However, Palm never functioned as an employee of Waldorf. PPG Wave 2.x series (1981-1987), designed by Wolfgang Palm, was a predecessor of Waldorf The WAVE and Microwave. Over the years, Waldorf continuously adapted new technologies. While the Microwave I (released 1989) was based on ASICs and a Motorola MC68000 micro processor,http://www.polynominal.com/site/studio/gear/synth/waldorf_microwave/microwave.html Microwave II (1997) was driven by a DSP. In 2013, NAVE, a synthesizer app for iOS was released. Their Kyra (2019) is the first fully FPGA-powered synthesizer.http://www.synthanatomy.com/2019/10/waldorf-music-kyra-fpga-va- wavetable-desktop-synthesizer-out-now.html While many other synth manufacturers aimed to recreate previously existing hardware in software, Waldorf went the other way and presented the RackAttack, a hardware drum synth in 2002. The synth engine had been published as a VST instrument a year before. Nevertheless, the Streichfett came up in 2014: a synth that recreated the sound of vintage string machines.

The concept can be traced to French broker Jules Regnault who published a book in 1863, and then to French mathematician Louis Bachelier whose Ph.D. dissertation titled \\"The Theory of Speculation\\" (1900) included some remarkable insights and commentary. The same ideas were later developed by MIT Sloan School of Management professor Paul Cootner in his 1964 book The Random Character of Stock Market Prices. The term was popularized by the 1973 book, A Random Walk Down Wall Street, by Burton Malkiel, a Professor of Economics at Princeton University, and was used earlier in Eugene Fama's 1965 article \\"Random Walks In Stock Market Prices\\", which was a less technical version of his Ph.D. thesis. The theory that stock prices move randomly was earlier proposed by Maurice Kendall in his 1953 paper, The Analysis of Economic Time Series, Part 1: Prices. Testing the hypothesis Random walk hypothesis test by increasing or decreasing the value of a fictitious stock based on the odd/even value of the decimals of pi. The chart resembles a stock chart. Burton G. Malkiel, an economics professor at Princeton University and writer of A Random Walk Down Wall Street, performed a test where his students were given a hypothetical stock that was initially worth fifty dollars. The closing stock price for each day was determined by a coin flip. If the result was heads, the price would close a half point higher, but if the result was tails, it would close a half point lower. Thus, each time, the price had a fifty-fifty chance of closing higher or lower than the previous day. Cycles or trends were determined from the tests. Malkiel then took the results in a chart and graph form to a chartist, a person who \\"seeks to predict future movements by seeking to interpret past patterns on the assumption that 'history tends to repeat itself'\\". The chartist told Malkiel that they needed to immediately buy the stock. Since the coin flips were random, the fictitious stock had no overall trend. Malkiel argued that this indicates that the market and stocks could be just as random as flipping a coin. A non-random walk hypothesis There are other economists, professors, and investors who believe that the market is predictable to some degree. These people believe that prices may move in trends and that the study of past prices can be used to forecast future price direction. There have been some economic studies that support this view, and a book has been written by two professors of economics that tries to prove the random walk hypothesis wrong. Martin Weber, a leading researcher in behavioral finance, has performed many tests and studies on finding trends in the stock market. In one of his key studies, he observed the stock market for ten years. Throughout that period, he looked at the market prices for noticeable trends and found that stocks with high price increases in the first five years tended to become under-performers in the following five years. Weber and other believers in the non-random walk hypothesis cite this as a key contributor and contradictor to the random walk hypothesis. Another test that Weber ran that contradicts the random walk hypothesis, was finding stocks that have had an upward revision for earnings outperform other stocks in the following six months. With this knowledge, investors can have an edge in predicting what stocks to pull out of the market and which stocks ‚Äî the stocks with the upward revision ‚Äî to leave in. Martin Weber‚Äôs studies detract from the random walk hypothesis, because according to Weber, there are trends and other tips to predicting the stock market. Professors Andrew W. Lo and Archie Craig MacKinlay, professors of Finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management and the University of Pennsylvania, respectively, have also presented evidence that they believe shows the random walk hypothesis to be wrong. Their book A Non-Random Walk Down Wall Street, presents a number of tests and studies that reportedly support the view that there are trends in the stock market and that the stock market is somewhat predictable. One element of their evidence is the simple volatility-based specification test, which has a null hypothesis that states: :X_t = \\\\mu + X_{t-1} + \\\\epsilon_t\\\\, where :X_t is the log of the price of the asset at time t :\\\\mu is a drift constant :\\\\epsilon_t is a random disturbance term where \\\\mathbb{E}[\\\\epsilon_t]=0 and \\\\mathbb{E}[\\\\epsilon_t \\\\epsilon_\\\\tau]=0 for \\\\tau eq t. To refute the hypothesis, they compare the variance of (X_t- X_{t+\\\\tau}) for different \\\\tau and compare the results to what would be expected for uncorrelated \\\\epsilon_t. Lo and MacKinlay have authored a paper, the adaptive market hypothesis, which puts forth another way of looking at the predictability of price changes.Lo, Andrew W. \\"The adaptive markets hypothesis: Market efficiency from an evolutionary perspective.\\" Journal of Portfolio Management, Forthcoming (2004). A more rigorous treatment of testing the random walk null hypothesis for United States stock prices using one-sided optimal statistical tests is due to Alok Bhargava.Bhargava, A. (2014) Firms' fundamentals, macroeconomic variables and quarterly stock prices in the US. Journal of Econometrics, 183, 241-250 It is important to separately test the random walk null hypothesis against stationary and explosive alternatives using two one-sided tests. In contrast, two-sided asymptotic tests such as those employed by Lo and MacKinlay can lead to misleading conclusions because the process could be stationary or explosive under the alternative hypothesis. The random walk null hypothesis for quarterly stock prices was rejected in favor of stationary alternatives using several test statistics appropriate for longitudinal (\\"panel\\") data. Peter Lynch, a mutual fund manager at Fidelity Investments, has argued that the random walk hypothesis is contradictory to the efficient market hypothesis -- though both concepts are widely taught in business schools without seeming awareness of a contradiction. If asset prices are rational and based on all available data as the efficient market hypothesis proposes, then fluctuations in asset price are not random. But if the random walk hypothesis is valid then asset prices are not rational as the efficient market hypothesis proposes.

History The history of Dismal Euphony began in 1992 in Stavanger, Norway by bassist Ole K. Helgesen and drummer Kristoffer Vold Austrheim under the name The Headless Children, a cover band of Slayer and Kreator. A year later singer Erik Borgen and guitarist Kenneth Bergsagel joined the group. They changed the name to Carnal Tomb, then Borgen left the band and Helgesen became the singer/bassist with the female voice of Linn Achre Tveit (Keltziva). Elin Overskott joined the band as a keyboard player. This was the first line-up of Dismal Euphony, officially formed in 1995. In the same year, the group composed the demo Spellbound. After this publication, they were signed by Napalm Records. Here they produced other albums like Soria Moria slott, Autumn Leaves: The Rebellion of Tides and the Lady Ablaze EP (which already features Anja Natasha as female singer). Later, Dismal Euphony joined Nuclear Blast and released All Little Devils, with the new female singer Anja Natasha. Their last album is Python Zero. After this release the band split up.

Lefkowitz (born April 30, 1935) is an American scholar of Classics. She is the Professor Emerita of Classical Studies at Wellesley College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, where she previously worked from 1959 to 2005. She has published ten books over the course of her career. Leftowitz studied at Wellesley College before obtaining a Ph.D. in Classical Philology from Radcliffe College in 1961. During the 1980s much of her research focused on the place of women in the Classical world. She attracted broader attention for her 1996 book Not Out of Africa, a criticism of Afrocentric claims that ancient Greek civilization derived largely from that of ancient Egypt. She argued that such claims owed more to a black nationalist political agenda than historical evidence. That decade, she also entered into a publicised argument with Africana studies scholar Tony Martin. She is the widow of Sir Hugh Lloyd- Jones, former Regius Professor Emeritus of Greek at Oxford University. She served on the advisory board of the conservative advocacy group the National Association of Scholars. Biography Lefkowitz earned her B.A. from Wellesley College in 1957, Phi Beta Kappa with honors in Greek, and received her Ph.D. in Classical Philology from Radcliffe College (now part of Harvard University) in 1961. She returned to Wellesley College in 1959 as an instructor in Greek. In 1979 she was named Andrew W. Mellon Professor of the Humanities, a position she held until her retirement in 2005. Lefkowitz holds an honorary degree from Trinity College (1996), which cited her \\"deep concern for intellectual integrity,\\" and also from the University of Patras (1999) and from Grinnell College (2000). In 2004 she received a Radcliffe Graduate Society Medal. In 2006 she was awarded a National Humanities Medal \\"for outstanding excellence in scholarship and teaching.\\" In 2008 she was the recipient of a Wellesley College Alumnae Achievement Award., Wellesley College Lefkowitz has published on subjects including mythology, women in antiquity, Pindar, and fiction in ancient biography. She came to the attention of a wider audience through her criticism of the claims of Martin Bernal in Black Athena: The Afroasiatic Roots of Classical Civilization in her book Not Out of Africa: How Afrocentrism Became an Excuse to Teach Myth As History. In Black Athena Revisited (1996), which she edited with Guy MacLean Rogers, her colleague at Wellesley College, the ideas of Martin Bernal are further scrutinized.

Lefkowitz attended this lecture with her husband, Sir Hugh Lloyd-Jones. In that lecture, Ben-Jochannan stated that Aristotle stole his philosophy from the Library of Alexandria, Egypt. During the question and answer session following the lecture, Lefkowitz asked Ben- Jochannan, \\"How would that have been possible, when the library was not built until after his death?\\" Ben-Jochannan replied that the dates were uncertain. Sir Hugh responded, \\"Rubbish!\\" Lefkowitz writes that Ben-Jochannan proceeded to tell those present that \\"they could and should believe what black instructors told them\\" and \\"that although they might think that Jews were all 'hook-nosed and sallow faced,' there were other Jews who looked like himself.\\"History Lesson, pp. 67‚Äì69.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 20, 1992. The episode follows the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant softball team, led by Homer, having a winning season and making the championship game. Mr. Burns makes a large bet that the team will win and brings in nine ringers from the \\"big leagues\\" to ensure his success. The episode was written by John Swartzwelder, who is a big baseball fan himself, and directed by Jim Reardon. Roger Clemens, Wade Boggs, Ken Griffey Jr., Steve Sax, Ozzie Smith, Jos√© Canseco, Don Mattingly, Darryl Strawberry and Mike Scioscia all guest starred as themselves, playing the ringers hired by Mr. Burns. Terry Cashman sang a song over the end credits. The guest stars were recorded over several months, with differing degrees of cooperation. The episode is often named among the show's best, and was the first to beat The Cosby Show in the ratings on its original airing. In 2014, showrunner Al Jean selected it as one of five essential episodes in the show's history. Plot Workers at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant are reluctant to join the plant's softball team due to its previous unsuccessful year (just 2 wins, and 28 losses). When Homer shows his co-workers the Wonder Bat, a large bat he made from a fallen tree branch, his co-workers eagerly join the team. They enjoy an undefeated season and earn a spot in the championship game against the Shelbyville Nuclear Power Plant. Mr. Burns makes a million-dollar bet with Aristotle Amadopolis, owner of the Shelbyville plant, that his team will win. To secure victory, Burns attempts to hire major-league stars Cap Anson, Pie Traynor, Jim Creighton, Gabby Street, Nap Lajoie, Harry Hooper, Honus Wagner, Shoeless Joe Jackson and Mordecai \\"Three Finger\\" Brown. After Smithers informs his boss that all the players he wants are dead, Burns orders him to find living players. He hires nine Major League Baseball players ‚Äî Steve Sax, Wade Boggs, Ozzie Smith, Roger Clemens, Don Mattingly, Darryl Strawberry, Ken Griffey Jr., Jos√© Canseco and Mike Scioscia ‚Äî and gives them token jobs at the plant so they can play on the team, to the dismay of the plant's team. Burns hires a hypnotist to boost his team's chances of winning. Homer is distraught when Wonder Bat is destroyed by a pitch from Clemens during practice. Before the game, eight of the nine all- star players suffer unrelated mishaps that prevent them from playing: Smith disappears in the Springfield Mystery Spot, Clemens starts behaving like a chicken due to the hypnotist's incompetence, Scioscia is hospitalized due to radiation poisoning from the plant, Mattingly is kicked off the team after misinterpreting Burns' order to shave off his sideburns, Canseco is busy rescuing a woman and her possessions from a house fire, Griffey develops gigantism after overdosing on brain and nerve tonic that Burns administered to the team, Sax is arrested by the Springfield Police when they suspect him for committing every unsolved murder in New York City, and Boggs is knocked unconscious by Barney at Moe's Tavern after an argument over whether Lord Palmerston or William Pitt the Elder was the greatest British Prime Minister. When Strawberry is the only pro able to play, Burns is forced to use his team of regular employees. Homer is benched while Strawberry plays his position. With the score tied and bases loaded with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, Burns fields a right-handed hitter against a left-handed pitcher and pinch hits Homer for Strawberry. Distracted by Burns' exaggerated gesturing, Homer is hit in the head by the first pitch, knocking him out and forcing in the winning run. The team wins the title and Homer, still unconscious, is paraded as a hero. Production \\"Homer at the Bat\\" took a long time to produce. It was written by John Swartzwelder, who is a big baseball fan, but was suggested by Sam Simon, who wanted an episode filled with real Major League Baseball players. Executive producers Al Jean and Mike Reiss doubted that they would be able to get nine players, thinking they would be able to get three at best. They succeeded, and the nine players who agreed to guest star were recorded over a period of six months, whenever they were playing the Los Angeles Dodgers or California Angels. Each player recorded their part in roughly five minutes and spent the next hour writing autographs for the staff. In several cases, the writers were unable to get the player who was their first choice. Nolan Ryan, Rickey Henderson, Ryne Sandberg, and Carlton Fisk were among the players who turned down the chance to guest star. Jos√© Canseco disliked the original part written for him and asked for it to be rewritten All the players were cooperative except for Jos√© Canseco, who Al Jean considered intimidating. He disliked his original part and insisted it be rewritten, and the writers grudgingly made him as heroic as possible. He was originally slated to wake up in bed with Edna Krabappel and miss the game (in a parody of Bull Durham), but Canseco's then-wife, Esther Haddad, objected. He disliked his caricature, saying \\"the animation looked nothing like [him]\\" but said he found the acting was very easy. When asked in 2007 about his part by the San Jose Mercury News he responded, \\"that was 100 years ago,\\" hung up the phone and did not answer any of the paper's subsequent calls. Ken Griffey, Jr. did not understand his line \\"there's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited\\" and got quite frustrated when he was recording it. He was directed by Mike Reiss, and his father Ken Griffey, Sr. was also present, trying to coach his son. Roger Clemens, who made his own chicken noises, was directed by Jeff Martin, as was Wade Boggs. Mike Reiss directed most of the other players. Mike Scioscia accepted his guest spot in \\"half a second,\\" while Ozzie Smith has said he would like to guest star again \\"so [he] can get out [of the Springfield Mystery spot]\\". Don Mattingly, who was forced to shave off his \\"sideburns\\" by Mr. Burns during the episode, would later have an actual \\"haircut controversy\\", while he was playing for the New York Yankees. The coaching staff forced him to cut his long hair, and was briefly dropped from the team line-up for not doing so. Many people believed the joke in the episode to be a reference to the incident, but \\"Homer at the Bat\\" was recorded a year before it happened. Many of the guest stars, including Terry Cashman, Wade Boggs and Darryl Strawberry all admit they are more well known because of their appearance in the episode, especially outside the United States, Cashman having \\"Talkin' Softball\\" requested more often than \\"Talkin' Baseball\\". One of the hardest pieces of editing was the hypnotist segment, which featured several of the guest stars speaking in unison. It was difficult because the parts were recorded over a period of several months and thus it was hard to sync their voices. Rich Moore was originally intended to direct the episode, but as he did not know anything about baseball he was switched with Jim Reardon, who was a baseball fan. Moore was given the episode \\"Lisa the Greek\\" instead. Many of the player designs were difficult, because the animators had a hard time designing real world people during the early seasons. Cultural references The episode's title is a reference to Ernest Thayer's 1888 baseball poem \\"Casey at the Bat\\". The episode makes several allusions to the film The Natural. Homer's secret weapon, his self-created \\"Wonderbat\\", is akin to Roy Hobbs's \\"Wonderboy\\", and both bats are eventually destroyed. The scene featuring the explosion of stadium lights as Homer circles the basepaths is also taken directly from the film. The end song \\"Talkin' Softball\\" is a parody of \\"Talkin' Baseball\\" by Terry Cashman. Jeff Martin wrote the new version of the song, but Cashman was brought in to sing it. The scenes of the Power Plant team traveling from city to city by train, overlaid with the pennant of the city they are going to, is a reference to the 1942 film The Pride of the Yankees. Carl batting with a piano leg is a reference to Norm Cash of the Detroit Tigers, who once tried to bat with a table leg in a game where Nolan Ryan was extremely overpowering and threw a no-hitter. The team name on Mr. Burns' jersey, the Zephyrs, is a reference to the Twilight Zone episode \\"The Mighty Casey\\", which features a team called the Hoboken Zephyrs. When Don Mattingly is forced off the team for \\"neglecting\\" to shave off his \\"sideburns\\" by Mr. Burns, Mattingly privately states that he still preferred Burns to George Steinbrenner, the owner of the New York Yankees at the time. Bart and Lisa when jeering Darryl Strawberry over forcing Homer to stay on the bench proceeded to repeatedly yell his name, alluding to an infamous taunt from the 1986 World Series. Reception Ken Griffey, Jr., the last active player to appear in this episode During the previous season, Fox had put The Simpsons in a timeslot that meant it was in direct competition with The Cosby Show, which won the timeslot every time. \\"Homer at the Bat\\" had a 15.9 rating and 23 share to win its timeslot while The Cosby Show had a 13.2 rating and 20 share. This was the first time a new Simpsons episode beat a new Cosby Show episode. Former executive producer Sam Simon and current showrunner Al Jean named it as their favorite episode. Regular cast members Harry Shearer and Julie Kavner disliked the episode because of its focus on the guest stars and its surreal tone. They were particularly annoyed by the Mattingly sideburns joke. Roger Clemens, one of the nine players to guest star Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, praised the episode, calling it \\"a great episode because the accidents that befall the pro players are so funny\\". Chris Turner, the author of the book Planet Simpson, said the episode was the indication that \\"the Golden Age [of the show] had arrived\\". Nate Meyers rated the episode a (of 5), stating \\"the script makes great use of the baseball superstars, giving each of them a strong personality and plenty of pep (the highlight has to be Mattingly's clash with Mr. Burns).\\" Colin Jacobson disliked the episode: \\"when [\\"Homer at the Bat\\"] originally aired, I didn't like it. While I've warmed up to the show slightly over the last decade, I still think it's generally weak, and I'd definitely pick it as Season Three's worst.\\" Entertainment Weekly placed the episode sixteenth on their top 25 The Simpsons episodes list, noting it was \\"early proof that The Simpsons could juggle a squad of guest stars without giving the family short shrift.\\" It was placed third on AskMen.com's \\"Top 10: Simpsons Episodes\\" list, Rich Weir called it \\"one of the show's more memorable moments\\" and \\"effective as it combines a slew of guest stars with some hilarious material for Homer\\". The entire episode was placed first on ESPN.com's list of the \\"Top 100 Simpsons sport moments\\", released in 2004. Greg Collins, the author of the list, gave great praise of the episode. He said this is the \\"king of all sports episodes, and perhaps the greatest Simpsons episode ever\\". A friend of Collins later met guest star Mike Scioscia and told him he thought his guest spot was the best thing Scioscia had ever done, he responded \\"Thanks, I think\\". Entertainment.ie named it among the 10 greatest Simpsons episodes of all time. Eric Reinagel, Brian Moritz and John Hill of Press & Sun-Bulletin named the episode the fourth best in the show's history, In 2019, Time ranked the episode fifth in its list of 10 best Simpsons episodes picked by Simpsons experts. In 2019, Consequence of Sound ranked it number six on its list of top 30 Simpsons episodes. IGN.com ranked the baseballers' performances as the seventeenth best guest appearance in the show's history, calling \\"each of these appearances was hilarious, making this a classic episode\\". The Phoenix.com praised the performances of each of the guest stars, but Darryl Strawberry, whom they put in the fifth position, was the only one to make their \\"Top 20 guest stars\\" list. The Toronto Star named Homer's conversation with Darryl Strawberry as the \\"greatest conversation of all time, involving the word yes\\". Legacy The episode has been credited with helping to save at least two lives. During the scene in which Homer chokes on a donut, a poster explaining how the Heimlich maneuver works is on the wall behind him. In May 1992, Chris Bencze was able to save his brother's life by performing the Heimlich Maneuver on him, having seen it in the episode, and in December 2007, Aiden Bateman was able to save his friend Alex Hardy's life by recalling the same. On October 22, 2017, Springfield of Dreams: The Legend of Homer Simpson, an hourlong mockumentary about the episode in the style of Ken Burns' Baseball, aired on Fox to commemorate the 25th anniversary of this episode as well as Homer's induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. Among those interviewed were every player who appeared in the episode except Strawberry.

He founded the big band The Georgians, during the British dance band era. Early life and career Gonella was born in Islington, North London, where he attended St Mary's Guardian School, an institution for underprivileged children where he started playing cornet. After a short spell as a furrier's apprentice, his professional career began in 1924 when he joined Archie Pitt's Busby Boy's Band, a small pit orchestra and touring review band. During his four years with the band, he discovered the music of Louis Armstrong and dixieland jazz. He transcribed Armstrong's solos and learned them by heart. Beginning in 1928, Gonella spent a year in Bob Bryden's Louisville Band before working with Archie Alexander and Billy Cotton. Cotton's band allowed him to record his first solos and to explore scat singing.  The 1930s  Nat Gonella & the New Georgians He played briefly with Roy Fox in 1931 and remained in the band when Lew Stone, Fox's former pianist, took over leadership the following year. With Stone's band he established his reputation. When Louis Armstrong visited London in 1932, Gonella met him by begging the staff at the Boosey and Hawkes music shop to allow him to deliver Armstrong's trumpet, which had been left at the shop for cleaning. Armstrong appreciated his willingness to help, and the two became friends. In 1933 Gonella published Modern Style Trumpet Playing ‚Äì A Comprehensive Course. He made uncredited appearances with Lew Stone and Al Bowlly in the films Bitter Sweet and The King's Cup. Gonella's reputation grew he formed The Georgians in 1935. The band took its name from a popular version of the song \\"Georgia on My Mind\\" that he recorded for Lew Stone in 1932 and which became the trumpeter's signature tune. The Georgians began as a band within Stone's shows before setting up as an independent unit. He became a headline act on the variety circuit before the outbreak of World War II. The 1940s and 1950s Nat Gonella (1946) He joined the army in 1941, and was recruited into the Stars in Battledress campaign, touring allied camps in Europe and North Africa. Whilst in Europe and North Africa Gonella served as the personal servant or \\"batman\\" to Major Alexander Karet and once the war had ended was offered the position as personal Butler to the Major, but he politely refused to pursue his music career. He reformed his band after the war, but the economic and musical climate was changing rapidly at that time. He flirted briefly with bebop, acknowledged that it was not for him, and returned to the variety stage during the 1950s, touring with the likes of the comedian Max Miller. The 1960s and 1970s The revival in traditional jazz in the late Fifties allowed him to reform his Georgians in 1960. In February 1960 he featured on the UK television show This Is Your Life, an appearance which later inspired an album The Nat Gonella Story, modelled on Louis Armstrong's A Musical Autobiography. He also appeared on the BBC radio programme Desert Island Discs in August 1966. All of this attention re- established Gonella, at least until the advent of The Beatles brought the trad jazz boom to a halt. He moved to Lancashire in 1962, and toured regularly on the Northern club circuit until his alleged retirement on his 65th birthday, on 7 March 1973.  Post-retirement  That retirement did not last long. Drummer Ted Easton persuaded him to come to play to his (Easton's) club in the Netherlands during the mid-1970s, and a new recording of a song he had first cut with Roy Fox in 1931, \\"Oh, Monah\\", became a big hit in the Netherlands. It was to be his final flourish on trumpet, but he continued to sing after moving to Gosport, Hampshire, in 1977 ‚Äì where a square was renamed in his honour in 1994, and was always happy to stand up and do so in a local pubs or at the Gosport Jazz Club. Digby Fairweather's New Georgians paid tribute to Gonella's musical heritage in 1984, and Fairweather and fellow trumpeter Humphrey Lyttelton co-hosted a television tribute, Fifty Years of Nat Gonella, the following year, in which Gonella himself was an enthusiastic participant. He continued to sing occasionally with various bands, and made the headlines again in 1997 when a sampled excerpt of his trumpet playing from a recording he made in 1932 was used in White Town's number one pop hit, \\"Your Woman\\". Nat Gonella died at the Gosport War Memorial Hospital, Hampshire on 6 August 1998, aged 90. Gonella was a down-to-earth and unassuming character, and remained so throughout his life. On BBC Radio 4, Barry Humphries said that \\"Oh Mona\\" was one of two tracks that had most appealed to him in his life. Humphrey Lyttelton is among those who have testified to the fact that fame and success sat easily on Gonella's shoulders, and reports that he would show genuine astonishment when Lyttelton would confess, as well as other prominent musicians, to Gonella having been his first jazz hero.

The character is identified with Nimue, the sorceress from Arthurian mythology made popular by Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. The character was played by Jeryl Prescott in the 2019 television series Swamp Thing for the DC streaming service. Publication history The character debuted in Doorway to Nightmare #1 (February 1978). The character was designed by cover artist Michael William Kaluta at the request of Joe Orlando (editor), based on Kaluta's unnamed host character (later known as Charity in the pages of Starman) from the DC Comics mystery title Forbidden Tales of Dark Mansion (seen only on that title's indicia page) and the person of Cathy Ann Thiele. The original storyline was developed by David Michelinie and Val Mayerik. Doorway to Nightmare #1 Doorway to Nightmare, introduced in 1978, was the last of the DC \\"Mystery\\" line of titles in the 1970s that became the forerunner of Vertigo. It did not have a consistent creative team‚Äîthe intent was to create writer-artist pairings that had never occurred before, except for the cover art of Michael William Kaluta.Doorway to Nightmare #5 Madame Xanadu, the star of the series, was not a host but an active participant, albeit never the main character in her stories. The Phantom Stranger was criticized heavily in letter columns for taking a similar approach.Letter columns in The Phantom Stranger vol. 2, issues 31-41 The Doorway to Nightmare strip lasted for ten issues: five in its own series, four in The Unexpected issues 190, 192, 194 and 195, and one issue of Madame Xanadu, which was DC's second direct sales only comic. The first issue of Madame Xanadu bore little difference from an issue of Doorway to Nightmare. There were several requests to reprint it in letter columns of The Spectre, but they were refused because that issue gave little background as to her character, although it did introduce Ishtar to the DC Universe, who dated Destruction. Madame Xanadu was a regular supporting cast member in volumes 2 and 3 of The Spectre, those versions written by Doug Moench (31 issues, 1987‚Äì1989) and John Ostrander (62 issues, 1993‚Äì1998). A Madame Xanadu ongoing series from Vertigo was announced at the 2007 San Diego Comic Con and started in 2008. It was written by Matt Wagner, with art by Amy Reeder Hadley. The series also featured art stints by Kaluta, Jo√´lle Jones, Marley Zarcone, Laurenn McCubbin, Chrissie Zullo, Celia Calle, and Marian Churchland. The series was concluded after 29 issues, the final one dated January 2011. The series dealt with Madame Xanadu's early life from Arthurian times until the 1960s. Starting with issue 9, the book coincided with the events of the Golden Age DC Universe. Story structure The Doorway to Nightmare stories were typically structured around a protagonist stumbling upon Madame Xanadu's shop (stated to be on \\"Christy Street\\" in the East Village) (changed to Greenwich Village in The Unexpected #192) and deciding to enter. She (usually) or he would tell a story of romance that was frustrated by an outside element. Xanadu, through a tarot reading, always determined this element to be of an occult nature, then sent the protagonist to do some task in which she would intervene with the use of her powers. Upon concluding the story, the occult element would wind up in a mason jar in her back room. In the first issue, she apparently became trapped in a burning building. The central couple returns to her shop for nostalgia's sake and discovers her to be quite alive. This was a hint at the extent of her powers. The primary variation in the stories was what the occult threat actually was, be it demonic forces, Asian mummies, vampires, incubi, or other supernatural threats. In one story, she fought Azazel, but he looked nothing like in The Sandman.Cancelled Comic Cavalcade #1/' #190. DC Comics. When the title was moved from its own series to a revamped, 68 page and ad-free version of The Unexpected (the stories were actually expanded from 17 to 22 pages with the move, part of the DC Implosion), she was shown to be friendly with Abel in the inside front covers, which may or may not have been in continuity. She never met Abel in an actual story until DC Special Series #21, when she and the Phantom Stranger arrive at the House of Mystery with Christmas presents. Fictional character biographyOrigin= Madame Xanadu's origins were explored in the first few arcs of her Vertigo series. According to these stories, her full name was once Nimue Inwudu and she is the youngest sister of Morgana (to become Morgaine Le Fay) and Vivienne, the Lady of the Lake. The sisters are descendants of the Elder Folk, survivors of Atlantis who evolved into the race known as the Homo magi. Madame Xanadu is the same Nimue who casts an imprisoning spell on her former lover Merlin, blaming him for manipulating Camelot and the course of history for his own gain. Merlin has the last laugh, though, as he succeeds in stripping her magic away from her, forcing her to use potions to maintain her immortality. The mysterious Phantom Stranger influences her betrayal of Merlin and the two continue to meet throughout the centuries, sharing an ambivalent relationship. Shortly after this, either she or the Lady of the Lake (regardless, called \\"Nimue\\") bore a son to Kon-Sten- Tyne, an ancestor of John Constantine. The child was left with Kon-Sten-Tyne, who sacrificed the boy as a teenager to Eve.Hellblazer Annual #1. DC Comics. Nimue wanders around the world for some time, becoming an advisor to many great rulers. She spends time in Kublai Khan's court at Xanadu, leading to her assumed name of \\"Madame Xanadu\\". Again she meets the Phantom Stranger. It does not go as expected, for she learns the Stranger walks outside of the timestream. During the French Revolution, she attempts to advise Marie Antoinette. During this era, she is able to regain her immortality by besting Death in a card game. Other incidents in her long years of life include a doomed lesbian love affair during the Spanish Inquisition. In the 1940s, she has a sexual relationship with John Zatara, who wishes to marry her, but she foresees his true love, and the later existence of his daughter, Zatanna, \\"a love with whom she could never compete\\". Despite this, she uses Zatara to trap and ensnare the Phantom Stranger, preventing him from witnessing, and affecting, the supernatural origins of the Spectre. This, in turn, prevents Madame Xanadu from interfering, despite having foreseen the potential menace the unchecked Spectre would have brought on Earth. It is revealed that Xanadu's later behavior stems from this earlier fault, her magic parlor being devised as a way to control the supernatural being, ultimately hoping to restrain and quell his rage. Eventually, Madame Xanadu decides that she wants to atone for her sins and begins operating the fortune-telling parlor out of \\"the Village\\". She, however, remains without any real magic might of her own, which has led her to manipulate various forces in order to gain power. Having developed herself as an advisor, she now meets clientele plagued by supernatural problems. Although she can advise them, some force prevents her from directly interfering in solving their troubles. If one of her clients manages to conquer a supernatural force, she can contain that entity in jars within her fortune parlor to prevent it from causing any further trouble. =Later history= Madame Xanadu #1 (1981) cover, art by Michael Kaluta. When the Spectre is destroyed by the Anti-Monitor, Madame Xanadu performs a magic ritual that brings him back to existence. From that day forward she acts as the Spectre's spiritual advisor while he is bound to the soul of Jim Corrigan. At first, Xanadu tries to lead Corrigan astray in order to use the Spectre- Force for her own agendas. She is depicted in a nude love scene with the Spectre in the form of mist, although readers in the letters column did not find this clear and Xanadu's nudity gratuitous. Subsequent issues made clear that this was a romantic relationship, but no more nudity was used.The Spectre (vol. 2) #9, which was controversial and continues to be cited in Overstreet because of its lack of a mature readers labeling with Xanadu's nipples clearly visible in more than one panel. Over the course of their affiliation however, a strange form of friendship grows between Corrigan and Madame Xanadu. Over time, Madame Xanadu is instrumental in ensuring the safety of Corrigan's soul, stopping the various rampages of the Spectre, and ultimately shows up at Jim Corrigan's funeral not as an advisor or enemy, but as his friend. She even sheds a tear as Jim Corrigan's soul leaves the mortal plane to go to Heaven. She is also consulted by the Suicide Squad about the increasing difficulty of dealing with Enchantress. She provides the Squad with a ring and necklace that can harm the Enchantress if she tries to use her powers against the ring- bearers' wishes. Madame Xanadu also gives Timothy Hunter a reading, helping him along his path as an emerging sorcerer. She also confronts Tim's companion John Constantine, whom she believes stole a magic artifact called the Wind's Egg from her. Although Madame Xanadu, among others, has no great love for or trust in the Phantom Stranger, she is a member of the Sentinels of Magic, a loose group of mages and mystics that are called upon to thwart Asmodel's uprising in Hell. Nonetheless, she prefers to operate alone and is one of the few heroes who outright refuses to ally herself with the Stranger. In order to gain more power, Madame Xanadu bartered her soul to the demon Neron, who gave her three loyal demons named Bathopet, Maw and Atopeh to do her commands. At first, the demons responded to her every whim and almost raged out of her control. Over time, as she controlled her own emotions, she became able to control the demons as well. =Day of Vengeance= In Day of Vengeance #2, an Infinite Crisis tie-in, the Spectre, then unstable and believing that magic equaled evil, disabled Madame Xanadu and took her eyes. In the Day of Vengeance special it is revealed that Madame Xanadu is still blind. She has regrown her eyes 14 times, only for them to be burned out again, because the Spectre's powers are beyond hers. However, Madame Xanadu's abode would be the rallying point of the offense against the Spectre, gathering the Phantom Stranger, Zatanna, and Nabu. Xanadu has also found a way around the Spectre's curse by training an adept, Daena, to read the cards for her. Through Daena, she sees the destruction of the world with the Spectre winning and destroying everything. It is at her place that Nabu begins his offense against the Spectre as well as the strategy for restoring the Rock of Eternity. =One Year Later= Madame Xanadu's standing in the new magic order has yet to be explored in detail. However, it is known that she is still trying to cure her blindness. She assists the Shadowpact when members of their team were temporarily blinded by the mystical powers of the villains known as 'the Congregation'. It is the mystical aspect that allows her to help, though some of the group are able to heal the blindness on their own. Madame Xanadu appears in Countdown #50, operating out of \\"Hokus & Pokus Occult Curiosities\\" in Greenwich Village. She is unable to help Mary Marvel locate Captain Marvel Jr. She does advise Mary to avoid Gotham City, because \\"it isn't safe for magic.\\" =The New 52= In The New 52, Madame Xanadu has resurfaced as the result of Barry Allen's unintentional tampering with the timestream and the merging of the Vertigo, WildStorm and DC Universes.Flashpoint #5 (August 2011). DC Comics. In the new continuity, Xanadu is no longer blind and despite her past as Nimue still applying, she seems to have taken a more proactive stance during the Fall of Camelot. Instead of quietly observing like she did in her core miniseries, she staunchly opposed the surrendering of Excalibur to the Lady of the Lake, and then started traveling with Jason Blood, meeting other Dark Ages-based heroes and villains as Vandal Savage and the Shining Knight. Furthermore, the Dark Ages Madame Xanadu is seen in a relationship with both Etrigan and Jason Blood, each one believing she was humoring the other for the sake of their forced merging.Demon Knights #1 (September 2011).

Set in 1961 New Jersey, the film focuses on a troubled adolescent girl who becomes a suspect in the brutal murder of her younger sister at her first communion, as well as in a series of unsolved stabbings that follow. Inspired by Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now (1973) and the films of Alfred Hitchcock, writer-director Sole devised the screenplay with Rosemary Ritvo, an English professor who was his neighbor. At the time, Sole had been working as an architect restoring historic buildings in his hometown of Paterson, New Jersey, and several properties he had worked on were used as shooting locations. Filming took place throughout the summer of 1975 in Paterson and Newark. The film premiered at the Chicago International Film Festival under its original title, Communion, in November 1976, and was released under this title in London in September 1977. After being acquired by Allied Artists, it was re-titled Alice, Sweet Alice, and released in the United States on November 18, 1977. Another theatrical re- release occurred in 1981 under the title Holy Terror, which marketed the popularity of Shields after her performance in Louis Malle's Pretty Baby (1978). While not prosecuted for obscenity, the film was seized and confiscated in the UK under Section 3 of the Obscene Publications Act 1959 during the video nasty panic, and was controversial in Ireland due to its apparent anti-Catholic themes. In the years since its release, Alice, Sweet Alice has gained a cult following and is considered a contemporary classic of the slasher subgenre in critical circles. It has also been the focus of scholarship in the areas of horror film studies, particularly regarding its depictions of Roman Catholicism, child emotional neglect, and the disintegration of the American nuclear family. Plot In 1961, in Paterson, New Jersey, divorced mother Catherine Spages visits Father Tom with her two daughters, nine-year-old Karen and twelve-year-old Alice, who both attend St. Michael's Parish Girls' School. Karen is preparing for her First Communion, and Father Tom gives her his mother's crucifix as a gift. A jealous Alice puts on a translucent mask, frightening Father Tom's housekeeper, Mrs. Tredoni. Later, Alice steals Karen's porcelain doll and lures her into an abandoned building. She scares Karen before locking her in a room, and threatens her if she tells anyone. On the day of her First Communion, Karen is strangled to death in the church transept by a person wearing a translucent mask and a yellow raincoat. Her body is stuffed into a bench compartment near the confessionals, which is set on fire with a candle, but not before her crucifix is ripped from her neck. Meanwhile, Alice enters the church, carrying Karen's veil; she kneels in place to receive communion. Simultaneously, a nun who has noticed smoke coming from the transept locates Karen's body. She screams in horror, disrupting the communion ceremony which descends into a frenzied panic. After Karen's funeral, Catherine's ex-husband Dominick begins independently investigating her murder, while Detective Spina formally handles the case. Catherine's sister Annie moves in to help her through her grief, though Alice and Annie despise each other. Catherine sends Alice to deliver a rent check to their landlord, Mr. Alphonso, and he attempts to fondle and molest her. Shortly after, while descending the stairs to go shopping, Annie is attacked by a masked figure in a raincoat. At the hospital, Annie claims that Alice tried to kill her. Alice is sent to a psychiatric institution for evaluation. Later, Dominick receives a hysterical phone call from someone claiming to be Annie's daughter Angela, saying that she has Karen's crucifix. Dominick agrees to meet her at an abandoned building. There, he spots the raincoated figure, and follows it into the building. On a staircase landing, the figure stabs him before beating him with a brick and binding him with rope. Dominick regains consciousness and sees that the killer is in fact Mrs. Tredoni, who chastises Dominick and Catherine as sinners over their premarital sex and eventual divorce. After Dominick bites Karen's crucifix off her neck, Mrs. Tredoni beats him with her shoe and pushes him out a window to his death. Catherine goes to visit Father Tom, thinking that Dom is there talking with him. He is not home, and neither is Dom, but Mrs. Tredoni invites Catherine in albeit begrudgingly. While preparing the night's dinner for Father Tom and the Monsignor, Mrs. Tredoni explains to Catherine that when her own daughter died on the day of her First Communion, she realized children are punished for the sins of their parents. In her grief and madness, she devotes herself to the church. Father Tom arrives during the conversation, and tells Catherine that Dom has died. She begins crying hysterically. During Dominick's autopsy, the pathologist finds Karen's crucifix in his mouth, and Alice is formally eliminated as a suspect. Father Tom and Catherine then go get Alice from the institution. Later that day, Mrs. Tredoni sneaks into Catherine and Alice's apartment building, unaware they have left for church. Simultaneously, Mr. Alphonso wakes up screaming, as Alice had mischievously placed a jar of cockroaches on him while he slept. Mr. Alphonso encounters Mrs. Tredoni in the staircase and mistakes her for Alice. When he shoves her against a wall, she stabs him to death and flees. However, Detective Spina witnesses her running out of the back entrance without a mask on. Mrs. Tredoni rushes to the church, where the police are stationed outside. At the same time, Det. Spina runs in the apartment upon hearing Mr. Alphonso's screams, arriving too late to save him. At the mass, Father Tom denies Mrs. Tredoni communion. She points at Catherine, screams that he gave communion to a whore, and stabs the priest in the throat as the police rush in. While Father Tom bleeds to death in Mrs. Tredoni's arms, Alice walks out of the church with Mrs. Tredoni's shopping bag, and places the bloodstained butcher knife into it. CastAnalysis and themesCatholicism= motif in the film Numerous film scholars have noted the film's hysterical portrayal of Catholicism and religious institutions to be in direct conversation with the motives of its villain, Mrs. Tredoni, whose ultimate goal is to \\"punish\\" the sinning members of her parish; this has resulted in some claiming the film to be overtly \\"anti- Catholic\\". Writer-director Sole's own proclaiming of himself as an \\"ex- Catholic\\" supports this interpretation of the film's religious themes and undertones. Prior to writing and directing Alice, Sweet Alice, Sole had directed his debut feature, an adult film titled Deep Sleep, in 1972. The release of the film resulted in obscenity charges being brought against him in the state of New Jersey, as well as formal excommunication from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Paterson, New Jersey; this event has been credited as influential to the apparent anti-religious bent of Alice, Sweet Alice. The murder scenes in the film in particular have been described by genre scholars such as John Kenneth Muir as \\"stark and shocking,\\" and noted for their use of \\"powerful imagery\\" correlating with the film's religious overtones. Muir views the film as a precursor to such films as Seven (1995), which focus on individuals being punished by death for their sins and character flaws. Catholic iconography is featured prominently throughout the film, including votive candles, crucifixes, and rosaries, as well as artistic depictions of the Virgin Mary in sculptures and paintings. Sheila O'Malley of Film Comment notes that: \\"From one scene to the next, religious iconography overwhelms the screen: paintings of Mary and Christ, marble statues, crosses on every wall, religion leering at the characters from behind. Parishioners kneel at the altar, pushing out fat tongues for communion (Communion was the film‚Äôs original title), looking like a parade of aggressive Rolling Stones logos. Religion is not a refuge in Alice, Sweet Alice. It is a rejection of the body itself, but the body‚Äîits tongues, its teeth, its menstruation‚Äîwill not be denied.\\" Additionally, Chuck Bowen of Slant Magazine observes that the presentation of the church sequences signifies a closed-in nature that \\"favors cramped medium shots and close-ups that induce claustrophobia. The characters always appear to be cramped together in the church, on top of one another, and their homes are composed of similarly small passageways.\\" Despite this, Bowen asserts that the film is not \\"exactly an indictment of the church,\\" but rather a \\"febrile portrait... of how society enables dysfunction on multiple fronts, from the domestic to the religious to the psychiatric.\\" =Familial dissolution= Bowen notes familial dissolution as a theme in Alice, Sweet Alice, citing the backstory involving the Spages and Dominick's separation from Catherine: \\"Sole allows these reverberations, particularly the parallel bitterness existing between Catherine and Annie and Karen and Alice, both of which have been intensified by religion, to gradually assert themselves into our minds... Catherine and Dom‚Äôs splintered relationship is also portrayed as a gateway to chaos, primarily for Catherine‚Äôs distracted nature and unwillingness to face the truth of her family.\\" Scholar Claire Sisco King notes in a 2007 essay that the film is preoccupied with the theme of theatrical performativity perpetrated by children who are emotionally neglected by their parents. King suggests that the title character of Alice is ostracized by her mother and aunt, and lacking attention from her absent father, who only returns after Karen's murder. King elaborates on Alice's performativity: Writer David J. Hogan considers Alice, Sweet Alice among a series of films made between the 1970s and 1980s preoccupied with sibling rivalry, and which feature \\"violations of the integrity of the nuclear family.\\" Hogan views the film as an extension of such features as What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1969), an earlier film that blended horror with familial drama between siblings. ProductionDevelopment= The killer's yellow raincoat is a recurring motif in the film, and a direct reference to the killer with a red raincoat in Don't Look Now (1973) Director Alfred Sole began writing the film in 1974, collaborating with co-writer Rosemary Ritvo on the script. Ritvo, an English doctoral student at Fordham University, was Sole's neighbor, and the two often talked about films together. \\"She was a Catholic and we would talk about the Catholic church, religion and stuff like that. Then we started talking about films and theater and I discovered she had a great love of horror films,\\" Sole recalled. The two began meeting during weekends and workshopping the screenplay together. At the time, Sole was working as an architect in New Jersey. Sole was inspired to make the film after seeing Nicolas Roeg's 1973 psychological thriller, Don't Look Now, based on the novel by Daphne du Maurier. As a result, Alice, Sweet Alice makes several visual references to Don't Look Now, namely the usage of the raincoat which is featured on the villains in both films. In developing the character of Alice, Sole and screenwriter Ritvo aspired to create a \\"child who has been neglected, and who could go either way,\\" dividing the audience in regards to her guilt or innocence in the crimes committed. Sole chose to set the film in 1960s-era Paterson, New Jersey, his hometown, and culled much of the family drama and dynamics from his own Italian-Catholic upbringing. The character of Mrs. Tredoni, the villain, was based on a woman who lived at the Catholic rectory next-door to his grandmother's house and looked after the clergy. Sole was also influenced by the works of Alfred Hitchcock, as well as the 1955 French film Les Diaboliques, while assembling compositions in the film. Although many critics have drawn comparisons to Italian giallo films and the works of Dario Argento in particular, Sole claimed to have not seen Argento's work at the time. Nonetheless, the film's incorporation of subtle dark humor and its unsympathetic portrayal of religion ‚Äî both motifs of giallo thrillers ‚Äî led to the film's reputation as the most \\"gialloesque\\" American film in history. =Casting= Sole, at the time an inexperienced filmmaker, did not have a casting director to cast the film, and instead would approach various stage actors about playing the parts. \\"I didn't have a working knowledge of what an actor does,\\" Sole recalled, so I started going to a lot of theater.\\" Sole would approach actors after shows with his screenplay in hopes of casting them. Brooke Shields was the first to be cast in the film after auditioning in New York City in 1975; director Sole had seen her modeling in a Vogue advertisement, and contacted her mother about the film, expressing his interest in her playing the role of young Karen. For her audition, Shields was required to mime as though she were being strangled to death. Sole recalled that Shields's mother \\"bent over backwards to help me out.\\" Sole cast Paula Sheppard, then a college student, as 12-year-old Alice, the protagonist suspected of her sister's murder. At the time of being cast, Sheppard was 18 years old, and had been discovered by Sole while working as a dancer in stage productions at Connecticut College. Though playing a 12-year-old, Sheppard celebrated her 19th birthday during the shoot in early July 1976. Linda Miller, an actress and daughter of Jackie Gleason, was cast in the role of Alice and Karen's mother, Catherine. Of the supporting cast, Alphonso De Noble, a New Jersey native, was cast as the sleazy landlord after director Sole had seen him impersonating a priest in local cemeteries. Sole had originally sought veteran stage actress Geraldine Page for the role of Mrs. Tredoni; Page, however, could not due to obligations in a Broadway production, but recommended fellow stage actress Mildred Clinton, who played the role. Tom Signorelli, who played Detective Brennan, an officer investigating the crimes, was a New York stage actor. Lillian Roth, a former film actress-turned- Broadway performer, was cast in a minor role as the pathologist, marking her first film role in decades. In the years after the film's release, Sole spoke favorably of Shields and Sheppard, though he recalled that much of the cast were \\"New York actors who were doing me a favor.\\" He also commented that he and Miller clashed significantly, describing her as \\"really difficult to work with... A real nightmare.\\" Despite this, he conceded: \\"Linda is an excellent actor; they all are.\\" =Filming= John Ryle The film was primarily shot on location in Paterson, New Jersey in the summer of 1975, with much of the crew being based out of New York City. While some newspaper sources stated the budget was $1 million, Sole claimed the film ultimately cost $350,000. To help finance the film, Sole refinanced his home and cleared his life savings. \\"My family was really supportive,\\" he recalled, \\"and my mother cooked for the crew, my neighbors chipped in; everyone was just so kind and supportive of me that we eventually got it made.\\" In addition to Paterson, some photography took place in the city of Newark. Approximately 90% of the film was shot using a 16 mm camera, as Sole wanted the frames to have \\"wide\\" appearance with significant foreground. Sole's occupation as a local restorational architect in Paterson helped him secure several shooting locations, effectively lending the film a modern Gothic aesthetic. Among the Paterson locations was the historic Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works building, where several sequences were filmed. Exteriors of the church were shot at St. Michael's Parish in Newark and the First Presbyterian Church in Paterson (demolished two years after filming), while the church interiors were filmed inside a hospital chapel. Additional interior photography took place at the Governor Morris Hotel in Morris Township. The stairwell interiors of the Spages' apartment building were filmed inside the historic former home of manufacturer John Ryle. Sole used a collapsible knife to shoot the various stabbing sequences The production was periodically postponed during filming, with Sole stating that sometimes two to four week breaks would be taken between filming sessions due to budget issues, during which the production sought out additional funding. On one occasion, filming was temporarily halted after actress Linda Miller attempted suicide by slitting her wrists while shooting the film's final sequence in the church. After a week of convalescing, Miller returned to the set and completed her scenes, though a bandage can be seen on her wrist in several sequences. Because of the repeated starts and stops, the production had to recurrently hire new cameramen; Sole estimated that a total of six different cameramen worked on the film. The total number of shooting days was around 20, as estimated by Sole. For the film's special effects, which included multiple murder sequences by bludgeoning and stabbing, Sole hired friend William Lustig, who would later direct the cult horror film Maniac (1980). Lustig also worked as an assistant cameraman on the film. Dick Vorisek, who had previously worked on Dog Day Afternoon (1975) and Carrie (1976), was hired onto the film as chief sound engineer after Sole was put in contact with him through Technicolor. The special effects in the film were achieved via practical methods, such as the stabbing sequences, which were shot using a fake retractable knife designed by Sole's friend, an engineer. ReleaseTheatrical distribution= The film premiered under the title Communion at the Chicago International Film Festival in the fall of 1976, where it earned a Silver Medal award. Columbia Pictures signed on to distribute the film in the United States, and secured a book tie-in by author Frank Lauria, which was eventually published in 1977 by Bantam Books. The studio's chief stipulation was that Sole cut a total of three minutes out of the film, to which he agreed. However, following a monetary dispute between Columbia and producer Richard Rosenberg, Columbia ultimately dropped the film from their roster. In the United Kingdom, Hemdale Film Corporation purchased distribution rights to the film, premiering it in London on September 8, 1977, under its original Communion title. Allied Artists subsequently purchased the film for North American distribution, and forced the filmmakers to change the title from Communion to Alice, Sweet Alice, out of fear that the public would perceive it to be a Christian film. Allied Artists' revised title, Alice, Sweet Alice, originated from a quote in Volume 16 of the Publications of the Catholic Truth Society, published in 1898, which reads: \\"Then there is Alice‚Äîsweet Alice‚Äîyour eldest born, who leans over the back of your chair and sweeps your face with her brown curls.\\" Director Sole reportedly fought Allied Artists on the changing of the title to no avail; the film was ultimately released as Alice, Sweet Alice in the United States on November 18, 1977. In some cities, such as Pensacola, Florida, the film was screened under the alternate title The Mask Murders. Following the rising fame of Brooke Shields after her performance in Pretty Baby (1978), the film was released for a third time in 1981 under the title Holy Terror. =Critical response= Alice, Sweet Alice received mixed reviews from critics upon release. Roger Ebert gave the film a favorable review, stating: \\"Director Alfred Sole has a brilliant touch for the macabre and there are some splendidly chilling scenes,\\"Ebert, Roger. Review: Alice, Sweet Alice. The Chicago Sun-Times. 1978. while US Magazine called the film a \\"superior modern Gothic thriller.\\" Daniel Ruth of The Tampa Tribune praised the screenplay, referring to it as \\"a tight, well-paced melodrama that keeps its audience guessing who the murderer is until the last possible moment,\\" while Leonard Maltin awarded the film a mixed 2 out of 4 stars, calling it \\"[an] OK murder mystery.\\" Bill Brownstein of the Montreal Gazette deemed the film \\"a gory and effective\\" surprise, praising its cinematography despite its story having \\"gaps and inconsistencies.\\" Some critics, such as Vincent Canby of The New York Times, noted the authenticity of the film's characters and settings: \\"Mr. Sole, whose first feature this is, knows how to direct actors, how to manipulate suspense and when to shift gears: the identity of the killer is revealed at just that point when the audience is about to make the identification, after which the film becomes less of a horror film than an exercise in suspense. He also has a good feeling for the lower middle-class locale and the realities of the lives of the people who live in it.\\" Ernest Leogrande of the New York Daily News echoed Canby's sentiment, awarding the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and writing that it \\"has qualities that take it out of the usual run of sanguinary homicidal horror movies, an attention given to dialogue, to authenticity of setting and to revelatory and atmospheric touches.\\" Despite favorable reviews, numerous critics deemed the film obscene due to its violent and religious content, among them Linda Gross of the Los Angeles Times, who, though praising of Sheppard and Shields's performances, summarized the film as \\"foul... Alice, which offers 105 minutes of atrociousness and bloody homicides perpetrated upon children by other children and infirm adults, is an obscenity.\\" The Boston Globes Michael Blowen similarly deemed the film a \\"gross vulgarity of an exploitation picture [that] begins as a slick, glossy thriller [but] gradually degenerates into a bloody mess... Sole employs craftsmanlike camerawork and swift editing in an attempt to gloss over the inconsistent script, but this film's complete lack of originality cannot be hidden.\\" William Whitaker of the Abilene Reporter-News similarly criticized the film's violence as \\"a little too much after awhile,\\" but conceded that the \\"script has enough imagination and the direction enough insight to make it passable fare as far as these kind of films go.\\" The film's depiction of Catholicism in an unfavorable light also drew ire from reviewers: Tom McElfresh of The Cincinnati Enquirer was particularly critical of this, describing the film as \\"wholly, totally terrible,\\" and a \\"mishmash full of sexual innuendo and rage at the Catholic church.\\" In Ireland, the film was notably controversial due to its perceived anti-Catholic themes. =Home media= During the changes in distributors and due to a myriad of legal problems, the film was not properly registered with the United States Copyright Office in 1975 during its production. As a result, the film became widely bootlegged in the following years. Some VHS versions of the film released in the 1980s feature a truncated 98-minute cut of the film, such as a release by Celebrity Home Entertainment in 1987. In 1997, Anchor Bay Entertainment released the film on VHS in its 108-minute, fully uncut version, with remastering supervised by director Alfred Sole. A DVD edition was subsequently released by Anchor Bay in 1999. After this edition of the film became out of print, it was re-released on DVD by Hen's Tooth Video in 2007. In the UK, the film has undergone controversy due to the Video Nasty debacle and never had a proper video release until 2003. The first UK release was by Video International on DVD, utilizing a NTSC-PAL converted 4:3 video master with BBFC cuts to the scene where a kitten is aggressively grabbed and thrown around the room (which eventually ended up getting waved with later DVD releases, as it was discovered the cat grabbing shot was a camera angle trick and that a stuffed toy kitten was used for the tossing shots). In 2014, 88 Films had put out on the first ever anamorphic widescreen DVD in the UK, utilizing a digitally processed and noise reduced version of the 1997 Laserdisc master used for the Anchor Bay and Hens Tooth DVD releases. 88 Films then followed up with a UK premiere on Blu-ray on July 9, 2018. This release utilizes a 2k restoration of a 35mm print being the 1981 \\"Holy Terror\\" reissue and bearing said title card. In May 2019, Arrow Films, in conjunction with Warner Home Video and director Alfred Sole, confirmed they will be releasing a North American Blu-ray edition of the film on August 6, 2019. Arrow's edition utilizes a 2k restoration of the camera negative, sporting both the original \\"Communion\\" and \\"Holy Terror\\" versions, along with several newly produced extras and the alternate \\"Alice, Sweet Alice\\" opening credits. Legacy In the years following its release, Alice, Sweet Alice garnered a reputation as a cult film. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Alice, Sweet Alice holds an 83% approval rating based on 12 critic reviews, with an average rating of 7.16/10. Patrick Legare of AllMovie called the film an \\"eerie, effective chiller,\\" praising the film's cinematography, and awarding it four-and-a-half out of five stars, while TV Guide praised it as \\"an excellent low-budget horror film from director Sole, whose impressive grasp of filmmaking technique and eye for the grotesque keeps the viewer on edge throughout the movie.\\" Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine noted in his 2005 review of the film: \\"Possibly the closest American relation to an Italian giallo, the film is head-trippingly hilarious (Jane Lowry, as Aunt Annie, may be the nuttiest screamer in the history of cinema) and features some of the more disquieting set pieces you'll ever see in a horror film.\\" Time Out, London praised the film for constructing \\"a running commentary on the themes of Alfred Hitchcock: against a carefully evoked background of Catholicism emerge twin themes of repression and guilt.\\" Horror film scholar Scott Aaron Stine, in The Gorehound's Guide to Splatter Films of the 1960s and 1970s, notes the film as \\"Compelling, and not entirely predictable, Sole's first (and only truly worthwhile) effort is driven by strong anti-Catholic messages (√° la Pete Walker) and‚Äîeven more pertinent‚Äîlittered with unflinchingly disturbing scenes of violence that are reminiscent of [Dario] Argento's earlier handling of brutality.\\" In 2005, Alice, Sweet Alice ranked #89 on Bravo's The 100 Scariest Movie Moments for the scene when Alice scares Karen in the warehouse. In 2017, the film was ranked the fourth-best slasher film of all time by Complex magazine. Proposed remake In 2007 director Dante Tomaselli announced his intent to direct a remake, confirmed that he had completed a script with Michael Gingold. Tomaselli will also score the film using original pieces and re-mastered and remixed musical compositions from the original film. In 2013 actress Kathryn Morris was confirmed to be performing in the film and will assume the role of Catherine Spages. The film will be set in the 1970s as opposed to setting it in modern times or in its original 1960s setting, as Tomaselli wanted to be \\"somewhat more recent while not at all losing its retro style\\". In May 2016, Tomaselli revealed that the film had suffered delays due to lack of funds, but also stated that he had been in recent contact with \\"solid prospects from European production companies and producers.\\" Notes and referencesNotes= References = Sources =     *  Further reading  *  External links  * * Category:1976 films Category:1976 horror films Category:1970s crime films Category:1976 drama films Category:1976 independent films Category:1970s mystery films Category:1970s psychological thriller films Category:1970s slasher films Category:Allied Artists films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American mystery films Category:American serial killer films Category:American slasher films Category:Films about Catholicism Category:Films about fratricide and sororicide Category:Films critical of the Catholic Church Category:Films set in 1961 Category:Films set in New Jersey Category:Films set in religious buildings and structures Category:Films shot in New Jersey Category:Period horror films Category:Religious horror films Category:American exploitation films ","title":"Alice, Sweet Alice"},{"id":"2009949","title":"Amira Casar"},{"id":"2009957","title":"Gay-friendly"},{"id":"2009964","text":"\\"Disco Infiltrator\\" is a song from the eponymous debut album by LCD Soundsystem.

Ling later hosted Our America with Lisa Ling on OWN from 2011 to 2014. Early life Ling was born in Sacramento, California. Her mother, Mary Mei-yan (n√©e Wang), is a Taiwanese immigrant from Tainan, Taiwan, and formerly served as the head of the Los Angeles office of the Formosan Association for Public Affairs. Ling's father, Chung Teh \\"Douglas\\" Ling, is a Chinese immigrant, born in Hong Kong in 1937.Stated on Finding Your Roots, January 22, 2019 Her paternal grandmother was born on Labuan, now in modern-day Malaysia. Her paternal grandfather, who was from Guangzhou, Guangdong, was one of the first Chinese students allowed to study in the United States in the 1930s. He received his graduate degree from New York University and an M.B.A degree from University of Colorado. He struggled to find a job in the United States and eventually opened the first Chinese restaurant in Folsom, California. Ling's parents divorced when she was seven years old. Following the divorce, she and her sister were raised in Carmichael, California, a city outside of Sacramento, by their father. Ling aspired to become a journalist and idolized Connie Chung. Ling was educated at Del Campo High School in Fair Oaks, California in 1991, followed by the University of Southern California. Ling chose to leave USC before graduating, entering the professional sphere at a young age as a reporter for Channel One News, and electing to \\"find her education by visiting different countries instead.\\" Speaking to USC students in 2016, Ling explained, \\"I think traveling is the best education. If there's one takeaway here tonight, it's to travel ‚Ä¶ I'm convinced that you are better, smarter, more marketable as a job candidate if you travel.\\" She is fluent in Spanish.

Ling's title is \\"Oprah Show Investigative Reporter.\\" She also has reported on bride burning in India, gang rape in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda, child trafficking in Ghana, under cover investigation of Pennsylvanian puppy mills with Main Line Animal Rescue, the immediate aftermath of the hurricane in New Orleans, and the April 2007 Virginia Tech Massacre. =Planet in Peril and Our America (2008‚Äì2014)= In December 2008, CNN's award-winning documentary Planet in Peril featured Ling in the series' second installment, called \\"Battlelines\\". She was a correspondent that tracked excessive shark fishing in Costa Rica, elephant poaching in Chad, and gave people an inside look at the battle for the control over oil in Nigeria. In 2010 Ling co-founded the website SecretSocietyOfWomen.com, a forum for women where they can share their problems anonymously. On February 16, 2011, her show Our America with Lisa Ling premiered on OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network. It ran for five straight seasons. =This Is Life (2014‚Äìpresent)= On April 14, 2014, CNN announced that Ling will host a new documentary series, This is Life with Lisa Ling, to join its primetime lineup. The show premiered on September 28, 2014. Personal life On January 3, 2007, Ling announced her engagement to radiation oncologist Paul Song. They married on May 26, 2007, in Los Angeles, California. The wedding party included guests such as Connie Chung, one of Lisa's personal heroes, and actresses Kelly Hu and Diane Farr. On June 7, 2009, she was awarded an honorary doctorate from National University, after giving the commencement speech there. In October 2012 Ling announced on Anderson Cooper's talk show that she and her husband were expecting their first child, a baby girl. She gave birth to a daughter named Jett Ling Song on March 8, 2013. She gave birth to a second child, a daughter named Ray Ling Song on June 6, 2016. The family resides in Santa Monica, California. Her younger sister, Laura Ling, also a journalist, was managing editor of Vanguard at Current TV and currently a host and reporter on E! Network. In March 2009 Laura and her colleague Euna Lee were detained by North Korea for illegal entry into the country. They had been attempting to film refugees along the border with China. In June, they were sentenced to 12 years in a labor prison for illegal entry into North Korea, and unspecified hostile acts. North Korea released Laura and Euna on August 4, 2009 after a visit from former U.S. President Bill Clinton. Lisa and Laura Ling went on to collaborate on a book, Somewhere Inside: One Sister's Captivity in North Korea and the Other's Fight to Bring Her Home, published in May 2010. Lisa Ling identifies herself as a \\"die-hard feminist\\". She was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder.

Their technique was used for high precision measurement of the electron magnetic moment. Biography At the age of ten Dehmelt enrolled in the Berlinisches Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster, a Latin school in Berlin, where he was admitted on a scholarship. After graduating in 1940, he volunteered for service in the German Army, which ordered him to attend the University of Breslau to study physics in 1943. After a year of study he returned to army service and was captured during the Battle of the Bulge. After his release from an American prisoner of war camp in 1946, Dehmelt returned to his study of physics at the University of G√∂ttingen, where he supported himself by repairing and bartering old, pre-war radio sets. He completed his master's thesis in 1948 and received his PhD in 1950, both from the University of G√∂ttingen. He was then invited to Duke University as a postdoctoral associate, emigrating in 1952. Dehmelt became an assistant professor at the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington in 1955, an associate professor in 1958, and a full professor in 1961. In 1955 he built his first electron impact tube in George Volkoff's laboratory at the University of British Columbia and experimented on paramagnetic resonances in polarized atoms and free electrons. In the 1960s, Dehmelt and his students worked on spectroscopy of hydrogen and helium ions. The electron was finally isolated in 1973 with David Wineland, who continued work on trapped ions at NIST. He created the first geonium atom in 1976, which he then used to measure precise magnetic moments of the electron and positron with R. S. Van Dyck into the 1980s, work that led to his Nobel prize. In 1979 Dehmelt led a team that took the first photo of a single atom. He continued work on ion traps at the University of Washington, until his retirement in October 2002. In May 2010, he was honoured as one of Washington's Nobel laureates by Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden at a special event in Seattle. He was married to Irmgard Lassow, now deceased, and the couple had a son, Gerd, also deceased. In 1989 Dehmelt married Diana Dundore, a physician. Dehmelt died on March 7, 2017 in Seattle, Washington, aged 94.

The town is on the Beaver River. History Originally part of the original Brock Township, (historic map) Cannington was first settled in 1833. It was originally known as McCaskill's Mills after a local mill-owning family. In 1849, a post office was opened, at which point the settlement was renamed Cannington after former British foreign secretary and Prime Minister George Canning (1770‚Äì1827). Cannington separated from Brock Township in 1878 when it was incorporated as a Village. When Durham Region was created in 1974, Cannington was amalgamated with the original Brock Township, Thorah Township and the Village of Beaverton to create the newly expanded Township of Brock. In 1987 there was a fire that destroyed dozens of homes through the town. Cannington today The community serves as a service centre for the surrounding rural area. It is home to the municipal offices of Brock Township, as well as a secondary school, Brock High School, and an elementary school, McCaskill's Mills Public School, which was originally 2 separate schools, H.W. Knight Public School, and Cannington Public School. The 2 schools later amalgamated, forming McCaskill's Mills Public School, named after the original town name, which was opened in 2006. The school offers a French Immersion Program, however the high school does not. French Immersion students are bused to Port Perry High School, which offers the program. The post office on Cameron St. W. services locals with lock boxes and two rural routes. There are multiple restaurants such as Mays Restaurant, Georgios and The Locker. Notable residents Cannington was the adopted hometown of guitarist Don Ross for twelve years. CBC TV presenter Ralph Benmergui lived in Cannington in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Cannington was home to the author Timothy Findley, who wrote a memoir, From Stone Orchard, about his experiences living at a farm on the outskirts of Cannington. McCaskill's Mills features as a setting in his 1995 novel \\"The Piano Man's Daughter\\". After Findley moved to France due to declining health, dancer Rex Harrington purchased Stone Orchard. Cannington is also the birthplace of Rick MacLeish (1950‚Äì2016), an NHL hockey player who starred with the Philadelphia Flyers in the 1970s and 1980s. Artist Robert Holmes (1861‚Äì1930) was an artist known for his watercolour depictions of wildflowers. He also taught at Upper Canada College, the Central Ontario School of Art and Design and its successor, the Ontario College of Art & Design. Some of his works can be seen in the Cannington Historical Society's Museum in the upper part of MacLeod Park.

The first is a superhero that was formerly owned and published by Fawcett Comics. The second is a female anti-terrorism government agent often featured as an antagonist of the vigilante team Birds of Prey. HistoryAlan Armstrong= Similar to Batman and the Blue Beetle (Ted Kord), Spy Smasher (secretly the \\"wealthy Virginia sportsman\\"\\"Spy Smasher\\" #1, Summer 1941, page 6 Alan Armstrong) is a master detective, equipped with a number of gadgets and a specialized vehicle, the \\"Gyrosub\\", which was a combination of an airplane, an automobile, and a submarine. Created by Bill Parker and C. C. Beck, Spy Smasher was introduced in Whiz Comics #2 (February 1940). Alongside Captain Marvel, Spy Smasher became one of the magazine's most popular characters. His perpetual enemy was the Mask, the mastermind of a deadly spy ring. He also fought the America-Smasher, the Angel and the Blitzys. In Whiz Comics #16-18, Spy Smasher was briefly brainwashed by the Mask to fight Captain Marvel, but finally Captain Marvel was able to restore his mind. With the end of World War II and the Japanese surrender in August 1945, Spy Smasher was left without a battle to fight. His name was changed to Crime Smasher in Whiz Comics #76 (July 1946), and he soon fell out of favor. One issue of Crime Smasher was published in 1948, and then the character disappeared. In 1953, Fawcett ceased publication of all superhero comics, after settling a lawsuit against DC Comics over Captain Marvel being an infringement on the copyright of Superman, agreeing to cease publishing Captain Marvel. After DC Comics obtained the rights to the Fawcett characters in 1972, Spy Smasher began appearing irregularly in DC Comics, presented as one of the heroes of Earth-S prior to Crisis on Infinite Earths. He first appeared in Crisis in Eternity, as a member of the Squadron of Justice when King Kull had captured Shazam and the Elders, and teamed up with other villains to wipe out life on all three Earths, and defeated Ibac on Earth-Two as he attacked Atlantis by tricking him into saying 'I back down from no-one,' defeating him as saying his name causes him to turn into a normal man and vice versa. The character was used prominently in the 1990s series The Power of Shazam!, in which aged Alan Armstrong often recounts his adventures as Spy Smasher. Power of Shazam! #24 was dedicated to Armstrong's recounting of a Cold War-era mission he undertook with an archaeologist named C.C. Batson to Batson's children, Billy (alter-ego of Captain Marvel) and Mary (alter-ego of Mary Marvel). While Alan was still Spy Smasher in that story, a crossover between Power of Shazam and Starman in 1997 included Jack Knight running over the history of the Fawcett City heroes, and mentioning that he thought Spy Smasher became Crime Smasher after the war but was unsure. AC Comics has published reprints of some Golden Age Spy Smasher stories that have lapsed into the public domain. The character also made a cameo appearance in the inaugural issue of Image Comics' Next Issue Project. Powers and abilities Spy Smasher is an intelligent scientist and inventor, a master detective and a skilled hand-to-hand combatant. He also possessed a number of gadgets and a specialized vehicle. =Katarina Armstrong= A new Spy Smasher, government agent Katarina Armstrong, created by Gail Simone, first appears in Birds of Prey #100 (January 2007). She is a high-ranking anti- terrorism agent who is affiliated with several American, Commonwealth, and United Nations agencies (see table). Her relation to Alan Armstrong has not been revealed, though her secret identity and costume seem clearly inspired by him. She is depicted in her first appearances as having a domineering demeanor, and is not hesitant to kill or order deaths in order to complete a mission. Having forced Oracle to work for her, she plans to take over the Birds of Prey organization and usurp Oracle's position. Issue #103 indicates that Katarina and Oracle were friends in college. At some point prior to Katarina's debut, they became rivals. That issue shows a flashback of both women competing in a race, with Katarina beating Barbara by cheating but immediately confessing to the judges after she had won. Katarina accompanies the Birds on a mission in Russia, and in a conflict with the Secret Six, Katarina finds her equal marksman in Deadshot. Katarina assumes leadership of the Birds from Oracle and fires Lady Blackhawk for dissent.\\"Birds Of Prey\\" #107 (August 2007) Back at Oracle's base, she is challenged to a fight by Oracle, who then manages to give Katarina a proper beating. She is humiliated when she faces the united front of every single one of Barbara's living former agents. Spy Smasher leaves disgraced after being threatened by Black Canary, but before doing so also gives Oracle information on Misfit's background. It was later mentioned in Checkmate #16 by Sasha Bordeaux that Josephine Tautin had \\"drop-kicked her down a deep, dark hole. Something she quite enjoyed doing, incidentally.\\" Checkmate #18 has Sasha personally apologising to Barbara for Katarina's actions. In the aftermath of Final Crisis, Katarina is seen being held prisoner by the Global Peace Agency. The GPA agents apparently erase all of her memories by \\"resetting\\" her brain, telling Cameron Chase that Katarina can hear their conversations but can no longer process what the sounds mean. Her current fate is unknown,Final Crisis Aftermath: Escape #3 though it is implied that she was returned to normal, as with many other characters in the story, after Nemesis and Chase use the cosmic treadmill. During the events of Brightest Day, an unknown villain begins targeting the members of the Birds of Prey. Oracle initially muses that it could be Katarina's doing, as she has the means and motive to harm the Birds, but it is eventually revealed to be the work of the White Canary.Birds of Prey (vol. 2) #1 Spy Smasher is eventually revealed to be alive and well when she recruits Bane and his new team of mercenaries (consisting of himself, Jeannette, Lady Vic, King Shark, Dwarfstar and Giganta) to invade and claim Skartaris in the name of the U.S.Secret Six (vol. 3) #25 Characterization Creator Gail Simone said on Katarina, \\"I felt the DCU needed a Jack Bauer. In these early issues, she looks like a pointed allegory to the abuse of powers by the government, but she doesn‚Äôt see it that way, and she‚Äôs a lot more complex than that. It‚Äôd be a cheat to simply make her evil and completely hate-able, I think. She‚Äôs got some levels. And she knows Babs‚Äô weaknesses. I like her. She‚Äôs very very dark... Even above [Barbara and Katarina's] competitive natures, there is a perfectly valid and honest ideological difference of opinion there. Babs believes what she‚Äôs doing is necessary, Katarina believes what Babs is doing is treason. They actually like each other, but like brothers fighting on opposite sides of the Civil War, the distance between them is so vast and clearly drawn that they can‚Äôt even hope to reconcile. They were friends; their ideals make them bitter enemies.\\" Powers and abilities Spy Smasher is an expert markswoman and a skilled hand to hand combatant on a similar level to Deadshot. She claims to be of higher political authority than anyone in the United States, even the President, but is later outranked in an issue of Checkmate by Sasha Bordeaux. Although she explicitly states that her job is to kill people, specifically terrorists and those who aim to harm the United States, she has yet to be directly depicted as taking a life. In other mediaTelevision= The Alan Armstrong Spy Smasher made a brief appearance in Justice League Unlimited episode \\"Patriot Act\\" voiced by Nathan Fillion. He is seen in a flashback sequence where he prevented the creation of Captain Nazi and confiscating the unstable serum that would be used later in the episode. =Film= In 1942, Spy Smasher was adapted into a popular 12-part film serial directed by William Witney for Republic Pictures. Spy Smasher featured actor Kane Richmond in a dual role, as both the title character (an American freelance agent in Nazi-occupied France who was originally believed to have been killed in a plane crash) and his identical twin brother, and Marguerite Chapman as the brother's imperiled fianc√©e, Eve Corby. Edited down to 100 minutes in 1966 the serial was re-released for television under the title Spy Smasher Returns. =Video game= Spy Smasher will appear in the video game DC Universe Online.

Hjemkomst Center first opened in 1985 and serves as a home to Hjemkomst Viking Ship, Hopperstad Stave Church replica, quarterly museum exhibits, and county archives. In 2009, the Clay County Historical Society (which was founded in 1932) and the Heritage Hjemkomst Interpretive Center merged to form the Historical and Cultural Society of Clay County. Hjemkomst Interior of Hopperstad stave Church replica Hjemkomst, which means \\"Homecoming\\" in Norwegian, is a replica Viking ship that is permanently housed in the center of the museum. The ship is a full-scale replica of the Gokstad Viking ship that was discovered in Norway in 1880. The idea for building Hjemkomst was that of Robert Asp (1923‚Äì1980), a guidance counselor at Moorhead Junior High School. Construction on Hjemkomst began in 1974 at the Leslie Welter Potato Warehouse in Hawley, Minnesota. The warehouse site was then transformed into the Hawley Shipyard during the construction. That same year, Asp became diagnosed with leukemia; however he still continued to build the ship; he had help from other volunteers. In July 1980 the Hawley Shipyard was torn down for the removal and christening of the completed ship. Hjemkomst was shipped overnight to Duluth, Minnesota, on August 5, 1980. Asp held the rank as captain during the ship's maiden voyage throughout Lake Superior until his death four months later on December 27, 1980. In May 1982, Asp's three sons and daughter along with eight members of Hjemkomst crew decided to sail Hjemkomst to Norway, which was Asp's original dream. The ship departed New York City on June 8, 1982 and arrived in Bergen, Norway 19 July and on August 9, 1982 the ship arrived in Oslo. The ship stayed in Oslo for a year until it was transported back to Minnesota on MV Brunto.  Hopperstad Stave Church Replica The Hopperstad Stave Church Replica is a replica of a Norwegian stave church located on the grounds of the Hjemkomst Center. The church was built in 1998 by Guy Paulson and was constructed of cedar, redwood, and pine. It is a full-scale replica of the 12th Century Hopperstad Stave Church in Vik, Norway. The church serves as a reminder of the Scandinavian heritage in the Red River Valley.

It most commonly describes an inflammation or degeneration of the navicular bone and its surrounding tissues, usually on the front feet. It can lead to significant and even disabling lameness. Description of the navicular area thumbCross section of horse foot. The relevant areas are: 2. Second phalanx. 4. Coffin bone. 6. Navicular bone. 9. Deep digital flexor tendon. 16. Plantar cushion. 17. Hoof. Knowledge of equine forelimb anatomy is especially useful for understanding navicular syndrome. The navicular bone lies behind the coffin bone and under the small pastern bone. The deep digital flexor (DDF) tendon runs down the back of the cannon and soft tissue in that area and under the navicular bone before attaching to the back of the coffin bone. The DDF tendon flexes the coffin joint, and the navicular bone acts as a fulcrum that the DDF tendon runs over. The navicular bone is supported by several ligaments above, below, and on the side. One of these ligaments is the impar ligament, which attaches the navicular bone to the coffin bone (distal phalanx). Cartilage lies between the navicular bone and the coffin joint, as well as between the navicular bone and the DDF tendon. The navicular bursa - a small sac that protects the DDF and navicular bone from abrasion as the tendon slides over the area - lies between the navicular bone and the DDF tendon.U Missouri Extension Causes and contributing factors There is no single known cause of navicular syndrome, although there are many theories, and several primary factors. The first factor is compression of the navicular bone under the DDF tendon and the back of the small pastern bone. Repeated compression in this area can cause cartilage degeneration, with the cartilage flattening and gradually becoming less springy and shock-absorbing. It may also begin to erode. Cartilage degeneration is common in navicular horses, usually along the flexor surface. This finding, and the associated biochemical changes, have led some researchers to conclude that there are elements in navicular disease common to osteoarthritis, and to suggest similar therapeutic regimes. Cartilage erosion may progress to the point that the bone underneath will become exposed. With the cartilage no longer present to protect it, the navicular bursa and DDF tendon may become damaged by the constant rubbing against the navicular bone. Navicular bursitis (inflammation of the navicular bursa) may occur, even if cartilage damage is not severe. This is probably due to the friction between the navicular bone and the DDF tendon from compression. Constant compression can also increase the bone density directly under the cartilage surfaces, especially on the flexor side. This tends to make the bone more brittle, and thus more likely to break. Another main factor is the tension placed on the ligaments that support the navicular bone. Some experts believe that the degenerative process begins with excess tension placed on these ligaments, causing strain and inflammation. Inflammation from strain of the impar ligament can decrease blood flow to and from the navicular bone, as the major blood vessels supplying the bone run up and down this area. If the ligament continues to be strained, it can thicken and permanently reduce blood flow to the navicular bone. Because veins are more easily compressed than arteries, blood flow to the bone would be less obstructed than blood flow from the bone. This would cause a buildup of pressure within the navicular bone. The navicular bone, in response to both the increased pressure and overall decreased blood supply, would absorb mineral from its center. Excess tension can also cause exostoses where the ligaments attach to the navicular bone, giving the bone a \\"canoe\\" shape. If tension is extreme, the ligaments may actually tear. Recent research has found correlations between \\"toe-first landing\\" of the hooves and navicular problems, due to excessive strain put on the deep digital flexor tendon, as a consequence of misalignment of the lower joints. Toe-first landing, usually seen as a consequence of navicular disease, may actually be a cause or at least a contributing factor to the onset of tendon inflammation and bone modifications. Toe-first landing is often caused by frog and heel overtrimming, long toes, and/or poor shoeing. Contributing factorsConformation= Certain conformational defects may contribute to navicular syndrome, especially defects that promote concussion. These include upright pasterns, small feet, narrow and upright feet, significant downhill build (commonly seen in American Quarter Horses), and long toes with low heels (commonly seen in Thoroughbreds). The long toe, low heel conformation places constant stress on the navicular bone, even as the horse is standing. Upright feet increase concussion, especially in the heel region of the hoof where the navicular bone is located. Excess concussion cannot be absorbed as well by the structures designed to do so (the frog, heels, and digital cushion), so more impact is transmitted to the structures within the foot. Poor hoof shape is usually inherited, although poor shoeing and trimming can contribute to these shapes. With the long toe, low heel conformation can come contracted heels (narrowing of the heel) which further compresses the navicular bone along with sheared heels adding more stress to the tendons and navicular bones. =Shoeing= Poor trimming, shoe selection, or inappropriate shoe attachment are well-known causes of lameness,Parks A (2003) \\"Horseshoes and Shoeing\\", in Ross, Dyson \\"Diagnosis and Management of Lameness in the Horse, pp.262-271, and navicular disease is fairly common in the modern-day domesticated horse. However, it is also seen in wild horse populations. Those who advocate \\"barefoot trimming\\" of domestic horses propose that in nature, a horse's hoof is designed to expand and contract as the horse moves. This expanding and contracting acts as an auxiliary blood pump, and aids the circulation of blood to the lower extremities. When an inflexible metal shoe is improperly attached to the hoof, the hoof can no longer work as designed, and blood flow is inhibited. However, evidence of navicular degeneration has been established in the fossil record of early horses. Mary Thompson, a vertebrate paleontologist at Idaho Museum of Natural History, has found evidence in many species of early horses and concludes, \\"The results of this study strongly suggest that man‚Äôs intervention (whether by increased usage or improper breeding practices) may not be the sole cause of the syndrome\\", although she cautions that her results are preliminary. =Work= Working on steep hills, galloping, and jumping all contribute to navicular syndrome, as they place greater stress on the DDF tendons, and may cause overextension of the pastern and coffin joints. Regular exercise on hard or irregular ground increases concussion on the hoof, thus increasing the risk of navicular syndrome. It is possible that standing can also increase the chance of navicular disease (such as a horse that spends most of the day in a stall with little turnout, as with some racehorses and show horses). Blood flow to the hoof decreases when the horse is not in motion. The horse is also constantly applying pressure to the navicular bones (which is intermittent as the horse moves). =Body weight= Horses with a high weight-to-foot-size ratio may have an increased chance of exhibiting symptoms of navicular syndrome, since the relative load on the foot increases. This might explain why the syndrome is seen more frequently in Thoroughbreds, American Quarter Horses, and Warmbloods as opposed to ponies and Arabians.Equine Podiatry  Dr. Stephen O'Grady, veterinarians, farriers, books, articles Signs Heel pain is very common in horses with navicular syndrome. Lameness may begin as mild and intermittent, and progress to severe. This may be due to strain and inflammation of the ligaments supporting the navicular bone, reduced blood flow and increased pressure within the hoof, damage to the navicular bursa or DDF tendon, or from cartilage erosion. Affected horses display a \\"tiptoe\\" gait - trying to walk on the toes due to heel pain. They may stumble frequently. The lameness may switch from one leg to another, and may not be consistent. Lameness usually occurs in both front feet, although one foot may be more sore than the other. Lameness is usually mild (1‚Äì2 on a scale of 5). It can be made worse when the horse is worked on a hard surface or on a circle. After several months of pain, the feet may begin to change shape, especially the foot that has been experiencing the most pain, which tends to become more upright and narrow. Treatment and prognosis No single treatment works for all cases, probably because there is no single cause for all cases. The degenerative changes are usually quite advanced by the time the horse is consistently lame, and these changes are believed to be non-reversible. At this time, it is best to manage the condition and focus on alleviating pain and slowing the degeneration. =Trimming= Putting the foot into proper neurological and biomechanical balance is crucial. Often navicular horses have long toes and underrun heels with very little inner wall depth or strength. Exposing the horse to proper stimulus to improve hoof form and structure is also vital. =Hoof care= The issue of hoof care is a subject of great debate. Corrective shoeing can be beneficial to horses suffering from navicular disease, although sometimes the effects are only temporary. Others believe that removing the shoes altogether is the best way to manage this disease, as it allows increased circulation to the hoof.Horse Shoeing Pathological Effects, Lameness Treatment Hoof Care, Maple Plain, Minnesota People on both sides agree that proper hoof shape and angle are an important long-term management plan for a horse with navicular disease. As with laminitis, different horses may respond in different ways to a given technique, so the farrier, owner, and veterinarian should work as a team to formulate a plan and to adapt if the initial plan is not effective. People who choose to treat navicular disease through shoeing may use a shoe designed to lift and support the heels.O'Grady, S (2006)\\"Strategies For Shoeing the Horse with Palmar Foot Pain\\", AAEP Proceedings, 52(209-217) This can sometimes be accomplished with a flat shoe and trimming alone. Wedge pads or wedged shoes are often used, but can amplify heel-related problems if present. Another strategy is to use a bar type shoe. Often, an egg-bar shoe, or straight bar shoe. Some horses benefit from shoes that change the breakover of their foot (like a rolled toe). With or without shoes, the hoof must be trimmed in such a way as to restore the balance and angle that may have been lost. Horses with long toe-low heel conformation need careful trimming to counter this. Horses with upright feet may need their heels lowered and a shoe that will allow their heels to spread. Early intervention is key; in one study, shoeing was successful in 97% of horses treated within ten months of the onset of signs, while only 54% of horses lame for over a year responded. Advocates of barefoot trimming cite recent studies which show that removing the shoes can help alleviate the symptoms of navicular disease, and in some cases, reverse some of the damage done to the hoof.Natural Hoof - Articles Because navicular disease can be caused, or at least exacerbated by shoeing, removing the cause is the first step in this strategy toward the management of pain in the animal. Successive carefully applied trims help to restore the natural angle and shape of the hoof, while walking helps to stimulate circulation to the hoof. It is not uncommon to find horses whose navicular disease is completely manageable through corrective barefoot trimming. However, this may require a transition period lasting from weeks to years where the horse may remain lame, or may never become sound.No Shoes?Some horses need shoeing, some don'tEquine Podiatry  Dr. Stephen O'Grady, veterinarians, farriers, books, articles If there is significant degeneration in the bone, a flexor cortex cyst, adhesions to the deep digital flexor tendon, or avulsion fractures, relief is typically incomplete no matter what foot care technique is used.Dyson S (2003) \\"Treatment and Prognosis of Horses with Navicular Disease\\" In Ross M, Dyson S, Diagnosis and Management of Lameness in the Horse 299-304, Saunders =Exercise= Horses with navicular syndrome need a less intense work schedule. Their fitness can be maintained through slow long-distance work or swimming, as opposed to being worked at high speeds, up steep hills, or on hard surfaces, irregular terrain, or deep footing. Reducing the frequency of jumping is also important. Some veterinarians and hoof care practitioners recommend exercising the horse on varied terrain to stimulate and strengthen the caudal hoof structures.Bringing the Sparkle Back in to Crystal's Life  Dr. Tomas Teskey, DVM =Medication= Vasodilators improve the blood flow into the vessels of the hoof. Examples include isoxsuprine (currently unavailable in the UK) and pentoxifylline. Anticoagulants can also improve blood flow. The use of warfarin has been proposed, but the extensive monitoring required makes it unsuitable in most cases. Anti-inflammatory drugs are used to treat the pain, and can help the lameness resolve sometimes if shoeing and training changes are made. Include Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, and other joint medications. The use of intramuscular glycosaminoglycans has been shown to decrease pain in horses with navicular disease, but this effect wanes after discontinuation of therapy.Crissman et al. (1993) \\"Evaluation of polysulfated glycosaminoglycan for treatment of navicular disease\\", Proceedings of the American Association of Equine Practitioners Convention pp.219-220 Oral glycosaminoglycans may have a similar effect.Dr Reid Hanson, Auburn University, cited in Proceedings of the World Equine Veterinary Association Congress 1997. See Bisphosphonates can be useful in cases where bone remodeling is causing pain. Gallium nitrate (GaN) has been hypothesized as a possible treatment for navicular disease, but its benefits have not been confirmed by formal clinical studies. One pilot study examined horses given gallium nitrate in their feed rations. While it was absorbed slowly, it did stay in the animals' system, providing a baseline dosage for future studies. =Surgery= Palmar digital neurectomy (or \\"nerving\\" or \\"denerving\\") is not without adverse side effects and should therefore be used as a last resort. In this procedure, the palmar digital nerves are severed, so the horse loses sensation in the back of the foot. This procedure should only be performed if it will eliminate the lameness associated with navicular syndrome, and only after all other options have been explored. The procedure is usually performed on both front feet. Complications can include infection of the wound, continuation of the lameness (if the nerves regrow or if small branches of the nerves are not removed), neuromas, and rupture of the deep digital flexor tendon. After the neurectomy, if the horse becomes injured in the area the injury may go undetected for a long period of time, which risks the animal's health. Due to this, the feet should be cleaned and inspected regularly. Neurectomy tends to lower the market value of a horse, and may even make the horse ineligible for competition. Neurectomy is controversial. The most common misconception about \\"nerving\\" a horse is that it will permanently solve the lameness/pain issue. In fact, though the time periods vary based on the individual horse and surgical method utilized, these nerves often regenerate and return sensation to the afflicted region within two to three years. In navicular suspensory desmotomy, the ligaments supporting the navicular bone are severed. This makes the navicular bone more mobile, and thus reduces the tension of the other ligaments. It is successful about half of the time. Prognosis The prognosis for a horse with navicular syndrome is guarded. Many times the horse does not return to its former level of competition. Others are retired. Eventually all horses with the syndrome will need to lessen the strenuousness of their work, but with proper management, a horse with navicular syndrome can remain useful for some time.

It also features Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum, John Carradine, Jerry Orbach, Tom Berenger, Nana Visitor and Beverly D'Angelo in supporting roles. The plot focuses on a young model who moves into a historic Brooklyn brownstone that has been sectioned into apartments, only to find that the building is owned by the Catholic diocese and is a gateway to Hell. It is based on the 1974 novel of the same name by Jeffrey Konvitz, who also co-wrote the screenplay with director Winner. The film was released by Universal Pictures in 1977. Plot Alison Parker, a beautiful but neurotic fashion model with a history of suicide attempts, moves into a historic Brooklyn brownstone that has been divided into apartments. The top floor apartment is occupied by a reclusive blind priest, Father Halliran, who spends all of his time sitting at his open window. Soon after moving in, Alison begins having strange physical problems, including fainting spells and insomnia, and hears strange noises from the apartment above hers. Alison meets her odd new neighbors, including the eccentric, elderly Charles Chazen, and attends a bizarre birthday party for Chazen's cat. When she complains to the rental agent Miss Logan about the noisy and irritating neighbors, she is told that the building is occupied only by Halliran and her. Miss Logan proves this by showing Alison the various empty apartments, including ones Alison had recently visited and seen occupied. Alison's lawyer boyfriend Michael initially believes she is suffering paranoid delusions, but secretly contacts his corrupt detective friend Brenner to look into the situation. Late one night, Brenner goes to Alison's building, while inside Alison is again awakened by strange noises, and encounters the animated, rotting corpse of her recently deceased abusive father in the stairwell. She escapes by stabbing him and, covered in blood, runs screaming into the street, arousing the whole neighborhood. Alison is hospitalized with a nervous breakdown, and two police detectives, Gatz and Rizzo, begin an investigation. Gatz and Rizzo suspect that Michael murdered his former wife, who fell to her death after refusing to divorce Michael so that he could marry Alison. The detectives find no body in Alison's building, the blood on her matches her own blood type, and her father is confirmed to have died three weeks previously. However, they later find Brenner's stabbed body dumped elsewhere, and his blood type also matches the blood found on Alison, suggesting that Alison might have murdered him. Gatz and Rizzo also discover that the people Alison claimed she saw at the cat's birthday party are all deceased murderers. Alison, who now has the ability to read strange Latin words that no one else can see, visits a Catholic church and confesses her sins, including her past suicide attempts and her adultery with Michael, to Monsignor Franchino. Michael, now conducting his own investigation, contacts the Diocesan office about Father Halliran and is directed to Franchino. Franchino is evasive, so Michael breaks into the office that night and reads Halliran's file, which shows he is one of a series of priests and nuns who previously attempted suicide in lay life and then became priests or nuns on the date of their predecessor's death. Alison is listed as the latest in the series, slated to take over as \\"Sister Teresa\\" starting the next day. Frightened, Michael leaves Alison in the care of her friend Jennifer while he goes to Alison's apartment building. There, Michael meets Halliran, who tells him the building is the gateway to Hell. Michael screams at Halliran and tries to strangle him, but is killed by Franchino. Alison meanwhile escapes from Jennifer's apartment and goes to her own, where she is confronted by Chazen and grotesque, deformed minions of Hell, including the now-dead Michael, who indeed had hired Brenner to kill his wife. Michael and Chazen explain that Halliran is the Sentinel, who ensures that the demons do not escape from Hell. Halliran is nearing the end of his life, and Alison, with her history of suicide attempts, has been chosen as the new Sentinel in order to save her own soul. Chazen hands the distraught Alison a knife and tries to convince her to reject her task as the Sentinel, commit suicide and join Michael in Hell instead. Just as Alison is about to cut her wrist, the infirm Halliran enters bearing a large cross and supported by Franchino. The demons shrink from Halliran and the cross, and Alison takes the cross from Halliran and sits in his chair, thus accepting her duty as the Sentinel and saving her soul. Angry and disappointed, Chazen and the other demons return to Hell. Shortly after, the brownstone is demolished and replaced with a modern apartment complex. Miss Logan shows an apartment to a young couple looking to rent. The couple asks about the neighbors and Miss Logan explains to them that there are only two: a violin player and a reclusive nun. The nun is Alison, now blind like Father Halliran. She sits facing out the open window in the top floor apartment.  Cast Production The external views of the house were taken from the block built at the west end of the Remsen Street in Brooklyn and many of the film's locations are in Brooklyn Heights. Winner was inspired by the depictions of the creatures of Hell as they appear in the works of Christopher Marlowe, Dante's Inferno, and the paintings of Hieronymus Bosch. Shortly after the film's release, Winner revealed that many of the deformed persons featured in the finale were actually people with physical disabilities and abnormalities, whom he cast from hospitals and sideshows. ReleaseBox office= The Sentinel was released theatrically by Universal Pictures on February 11, 1977. It grossed a total of $4 million at the U.S. box office, and was the 57th highest-grossing film of the year. =Critical response= Initial reception The Sentinel received mostly negative reviews upon its release. David Pirie in Time Out was quite negative in his review, claiming The Sentinel was \\"just a mass of frequently incomprehensible footage, acted so badly that even the most blatant shocks count for little\\".\\"The Sentinel\\", in Time Out Film Guide 2011, Time Out, London, 2010. (p. 946). Pirie criticised the movie for being derivative of Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist and The Omen: \\"The Sentinel seems little more than a pile of outtakes from recent supernatural successes.\\" Robin Wood described The Sentinel as \\"the worst‚Äîmost offensive and repressive‚Äîhorror film of the 70s\\".Robin Wood, Hollywood From Vietnam to Reagan. Columbia University Press, 1986. (p. 153). Variety gave the film a negative review, writing \\"The Sentinel is a grubby, grotesque excursion into religioso psychodrama, notable for uniformly poor performances by a large cast of familiar names and direction that is hysterical and heavy-handed.\\" The New York Times called the film \\"dull\\", criticizing the film for its long stretches, but commended Raines' performance. Film scholar Richard Bookbinder wrote in his 1982 book The Films of the Seventies the final sequence in which the \\"armies of Hell\\" terrorize Alison \\"is undoubtedly one of the most terrifying interludes in seventies cinema.\\" Modern assessment On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, The Sentinel holds an approval rating of 47% based on 19 reviews, with a rating average of 5.9/10. Anthony Arrigo from Dread Central gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, writing, \\"The Sentinel might be devoid of any big, memorable showstopper moments but it maintains enough of a chilling atmosphere to keep fright fans engaged.\\" Brett Gallman from Oh, the Horror! gave the film a positive review, stating that, although it was not the best of the \\"demonic horror\\" subgenre, it was just as entertaining. Gallman also commended the film's script, performances and effective imagery. Ian Jane from DVD Talk awarded the film 3.5 out of 5 stars. In his conclusion Jane wrote, \\"Michael Winner's The Sentinel is a gleefully perverse slice of seventies horror that makes no qualms about taking things in a few entirely unexpected directions while still sticking to some tried and true genre conventions. It's not a perfect film but it's definitely interesting and always entertaining.\\" The film was ranked #46 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments in 2004. TV Guide awarded the film 1/5 stars, calling it \\"a truly repulsive film\\". Jedd Beaudoin from PopMatters gave the film 1/10 stars, criticizing the film's lack of believability and incoherent plot. =Home media= Universal Pictures Home Video released The Sentinel on DVD in 2004. In 2015, Scream Factory issued the film on Blu-ray with new bonus materials, including three audio commentaries.

He was one of the first exponents of Symbolist art in Russia.  Biography  He was born to a strongly patriarchal merchant family. His father was a draper and haberdasher, but always had a strong interest in history and literature. As a result, he was sympathetic to his son's desire to be an artist, but insisted that he acquire practical skills first and, in 1874, he was sent to Moscow where he enrolled at the Voskresensky Realschule. In 1877, his counselors suggested that he transfer to the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, where he studied with Pavel Sorokin, Illarion Pryanishnikov and Vasily Perov, who was his favorite teacher. In 1879, he began to participate in the school's exhibitions. Two years later, he entered the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, where he worked with Pavel Chistyakov. He was disappointed at the teaching there and returned to Moscow, only to find Perov on his deathbed, so he took lessons from Alexei Savrasov.Brief biography @ RusArtNet. The Hermit After a brief stay in Ufa, where he met his future wife, Maria, he returned to Moscow and studied with Vladimir Makovsky. While creating a series of historical paintings, he supported himself doing illustrations for magazines and books published by , including a collection of fairy tales by Pushkin. In 1885, he was awarded the title \\"Free Artist\\" and married, against his parent's wishes. The following year, his wife died after giving birth to his daughter, Olga. Several of his works from this period feature his wife's image. His first major success came with his painting, \\"The Hermit\\" which was shown at the seventeenth exhibition of the Peredvizhniki in 1889. It was purchased by Pavel Tretyakov and the money enabled Nesterov to take an extended trip to Austria, Germany, France and Italy. Upon returning, his painting, \\"The Vision to the Youth Bartholomew\\", the first in a series of works on the life of Saint Sergius, was shown at the eighteenth Peredvizhniki exhibition and also purchased by Tretyakov. This series would eventually include fifteen large canvases and occupy him for fifty years. =Religious art= In 1890, Adrian Prakhov, who was overseeing work at St Volodymyr's Cathedral, became familiar with Nesterov's paintings and invited him to participate in creating murals and icons there. After some hesitation, he agreed, then travelled to Rome and Istanbul to acquaint himself with Byzantine art. This project would take twenty-two years to complete. Although it brought him great popularity, he apparently came to feel that the images required were too clich√©d and beneath his dignity as an artist, so he occasionally introduced some minor innovations, such as setting portraits of saints in a recognizable landscape. The Annunciation, Marfo-Mariinsky Convent. Despite this, he undertook other religious commissions. In 1898, Grand Duke George Alexandrovich asked him to work at the Alexander Nevsky church in Abastumani. He spent six years there, off and on, creating 50 small murals and the iconostasis, but was dissatisfied with the results. He was apparently much more pleased with later work at the Marfo-Mariinsky Convent. He refused to work on the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Warsaw, because he did not approve of building an Orthodox cathedral in a predominantly Catholic city.Biographical notes by Sergei Durylin @ Bibliotekar. In 1901, he wanted to deepen his spiritual appreciation of the monastic life, so he spent some time at the Solovetsky Monastery on the coast of the White Sea. He painted numerous works there and the influence of his visit could be seen in his canvases for many years after. He was also inspired by the novels of Pavel Ivanovich Melnikov, dealing with the lives of the Old Believers in the Volga Region. In 1902, he married Ekaterina Vasilyeva, whom he had met admiring his works at an exhibition. =Later years= Portrait of Ivan Pavlov, 1935 In 1905, after the Revolution began, he joined the Union of the Russian People, an extreme right- wing nationalist party that supported the Tsar. As a result, he was in some danger after the October Revolution. In 1918, he moved to Armavir, where he became ill and was unable to work. He returned to Moscow in 1920 and was forced to give up religious painting, although he continued to work on his Saint Sergius series in private. From then until his death, he painted mostly portraits; notably Ivan Ilyin, Ivan Pavlov, Otto Schmidt, Sergei Yudin, Alexey Shchusev and Vera Mukhina.Brief biography @ Russian Paintings. In 1938, toward the end of the Great Purge, his son-in-law, Vladimir Schroeter, a prominent lawyer, was accused of being a spy and shot. His daughter was sent to a prison camp in Zhambyl, where she was brutally interrogated before being released. He was also arrested and held for two weeks at Butyrka Prison. In 1941, he was awarded the Stalin Prize for his portrait of Pavlov (created in 1935). It was one of the first given to an artist. Shortly after, he received the Order of the Red Banner of Labour. As the war progressed, his health and financial situation deteriorated rapidly. He had a stroke while working on his painting \\"Autumn in the Village\\" and died at . His unfinished memoirs, which he had begun in 1926, were published later that year under the title \\"Bygone Days\\". In 1962, he was honored with a postage stamp.

Palisades is owned and operated by Entergy. It was operated by the Nuclear Management Company and owned by CMS Energy Corporation prior to the sale completed on April 11, 2007. Its single Combustion Engineering pressurized water reactor weighs 425 tons and has steel walls thick. The containment building is in diameter and tall, including the dome. Its concrete walls are thick with a steel liner plate. The dome roof is thick. Access is via a personnel lock measuring by . The Westinghouse Electric Company turbine generator can produce 725,000 kilowatts of electricity. Built between 1967 and 1970, Palisades was approved to operate at full power in 1973. On July 12, 2006 it was announced that the plant would be sold to Entergy. On April 11, 2007, the plant was sold to Entergy for $380 million. The plant's original licensee was due to expire on March 24, 2011. An application for 20-year extension was filed in 2005 with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It was granted on January 18, 2007. Therefore, the plant was then scheduled for decommissioning by 2031. Entergy plans to close the Palisades plant in 2022. Earlier, Entergy had made a decision to close the plant in October 2018. A decision by the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) influenced the company's decision. Consumers Energy attempted to buy its way out of a power purchase agreement it has with Entergy and the plant. The MPSC did not approve Consumer Energy's full request of $172 million, so Entergy decided to keep the plant open three years longer than planned. Surrounding population The Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity. The 2010 U.S. population within of Palisades was 28,644, a decrease of 4.5 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. The 2010 U.S. population within was 1,326,618, an increase of 4.4 percent since 2000. Cities within 50 miles include South Bend, IN (45 miles to city center) and Kalamazoo, MI.Bill Dedman, Nuclear neighbors: Population rises near US reactors, NBC News, April 14, 2011 http://www.nbcnews.com/id/42555888/ns/us_news-life/t/nuclear-neighbors- population-rises-near-us-reactors/#.XPHsAehJEgw Accessed May 31, 2019. Spent fuel storage Spent fuel is stored outdoors in 21 storage casks, each containing 30 tons and resting on a concrete pad. This was intended to be a temporary solution until the spent fuel repository at Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository opened. Parts replacement Two steam generators were replaced in 1992. This involved cutting a 28 by 26 foot opening through the reinforced concrete wall. The removed units are stored in a large concrete building on plant property. Seismic risk The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Palisades was 1 in 156,250, according to an NRC study published in August 2010.Bill Dedman, \\"What are the odds?

The band have released seven studio albums, two live albums, and a Peel Session. Biography Dead Meadow formed in 1998 from the remnants of two local DC bands, The Impossible Five and Colour.Dead Meadow bio at Matador Records The band started as Jason Simon on vocals and guitar, Steve Kille on bass, and Mark Laughlin on drums. They combined 70's heavy metal and 60's psychedelic rock with themes from authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien and H. P. Lovecraft. The first album, Dead Meadow, was released in 2000 on Tolotta Records, a label run by Fugazi bassist Joe Lally. The vinyl LP version was released by Planaria Records. This was followed by 2001's Howls from the Hills, also released on Tolotta Records. Having heard the band's first album, John Peel asked the band to record a Peel Session. Unable to afford to tour internationally, the band recorded their session in Fugazi's home studio using an 8-track recorder previously owned by Minor Threat, the first time a Peel Session was recorded outside the BBC studios. Primarily featuring energetic versions of songs from their first two albums, Dead Meadow's session was officially released in 2011 as Peel Sessions, and includes two additional tracks recorded during the same period. In Spring 2002, Laughlin left the band in order to attend law school and pursue a career as a lawyer. He was replaced by long-time friend and former Canyon drummer Stephen McCarty. In mid 2002, the band released the live album, Got Live If You Want It, which documented one of the last shows with Laughlin and was produced, mixed and released by Anton Newcombe of Brian Jonestown Massacre. In early 2003 the band signed to Matador Records and released Shivering King and Others. Along with the heavy song and blues-influenced songs as on the previous two records, the band continued in their psychedelic style, with acoustic elements and ballads. With the addition of second guitarist Cory Shane, Feathers was released in 2005. The band's music was used briefly in both the season four premiere \\"Boys of Summer\\" and the season five episode \\"React Quotes\\" of The Wire. Simon is the nephew of the series creator David Simon. In 2007, the band reverted to a three piece. They performed at the Green Man Festival in the UK and relocated from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles, California. In early 2008, the band released Old Growth on Matador Records. A collection of songs that brought the band back initially to the same farm where their second release Howls from the Hills was created and eventually finished up at the Sunset Sound studio in Los Angeles. As with the last three albums, Old Growth was produced by bassist Steve Kille. Following a brief session with Andrew Stockdale of Wolfmother, a reinterpretation of the band's song \\"Everything's Goin' On\\" was released as \\"Pilgrim\\" on Wolfmother's second album \\"Cosmic Egg\\". In March 2010 the band released a live film and soundtrack, Three Kings, which was recorded at the final show of the band's five-month \\"Old Growth\\" tour. The film premiered at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles, California and was released on their own record label Xemu Records. The film was directed by Simon Chan & Joe Rubalcaba of Artificial Army. In August 2010, it was announced that original drummer Mark Laughlin had re-joined the band and were confirmed to play two dates in the U.S and a tour of Australia. In January 2011, Laughlin postponed his career in law to rejoin the band permanently and tour Europe and the Pacific Northwest of the U.S. The band released Warble Womb in November 2013, their first new album to feature Laughlin since 2002. The album was released on the band's own label Xemu Records. Although not officially announced, it was revealed in February 2016 that Laughlin (taking a break from touring) had been replaced by Juan Londono, formerly of Strangers Family Band.

The collective's name derives from the act of seeking out records to sample for production. The collective is composed of Lord Finesse, Diamond D, Big L, O.C., Fat Joe, Buckwild, Showbiz and A.G., DJ O.Gee and The Ghetto Dwellas. Its members have achieved substantial and consistent recognition in underground rap circles, having often collaborated with undiscovered talents and underground hip hop artists alongside the most commercial of rappers. HistoryBackground and formation= Lord Finesse (born Robert Hall) is a rapper-turned-producer who has produced tracks for The Notorious B.I.G. (1994's Ready to Die) and Dr. Dre (1999's 2001). As a young MC, he would travel to any borough in New York to battle their best rapper and win. He shopped his demo to various record labels and eventually dropped the first of several records, 1990's Funky Technician. The record had a few tracks produced by his longtime friend Diamond (formerly Diamond D), a former member of the rap group Ultimate Force. In the mid-'80s, he was turntable scratching at late-night park parties, often competing with area top DJs (with future cohort Showbiz, being one of his rivals). In 1992, this DJ, then a producer, showcased New York City's underground talent and his rap skills on his classic debut Stunts, Blunts & Hip-Hop. Bronx-native Fat Joe became the first Latino rapper in New York to secure a solo deal with a major label with his 1993 debut Representin'. In 1998, his Don Cartagena release went gold (500,000 copies sold). Showbiz & A.G. were the first to adopt the do-it-yourself attitude by releasing their 1992 debut EP, Can I Get a Soul Clap, practically out of the trunk of their cars. Showbiz, a name he'd stolen from an old Richard Pryor record, pioneered taking an instrumental and looping voices over it. His partner A.G. was known as the Bronx's \\"punchline\\" rapper. Through the mid-'90s, he was a prolific producer, producing tracks for primarily underground rap acts. In 1999, A.G. restarted his rap career with his solo CD Dirty Version. Meanwhile, another Bronx native named Buckwild, who once started out as Lord Finesse's apprentice in his production company, started producing tracks around 1994. He first gained major recognition in the underground rap scene for producing tracks for O.C.'s Word... Life in 1994. He went on to produce for several prominent rappers, including Fat Joe, The Notorious B.I.G., Big L and Big Pun. After the release of Word... Life, O.C. made numerous guest appearances on other D.I.T.C. members' records while maintaining a low profile. One of the less prolific members of the group, DJ O.Gee, contributed production to his frequent collaborator O.C.'s Word... Life, Jewelz, and Hidden Gems, as well as the track \\"Your Life\\" for Soul In The Hole (Soundtrack). DJ O.Gee also produced \\"Laughing At You\\" from Big Pun's 2000 album Yeeeah Baby, contributed scratches to Buckwild's remix of Channel Live's song \\"Mad Izm\\" on the 2007 compilation Buckwild: Diggin In The Crates, and contributed a remix to the 2014 D.I.T.C.: The Remix Project. The third member of D.I.T.C. was Big L, a gangsta rapper from Harlem. Staying true to hardcore hip hop and calling himself the \\"flamboyant MC\\", he issued his 1995 debut Lifestylez ov da Poor and Dangerous on Columbia Records. Big L was working on his second album, due for release on Rawkus Records, when he was murdered on February 15, 1999 at age 24. The remaining D.I.T.C. members came together later that year for a memorial concert at Trammps in New York (anthologized by a series of CD releases), and recorded a self-titled group record in 2000. =Later years= On December 4, 2008, D.I.T.C. member Party Arty unexpectedly died of unspecified health complications, aged 31. In 2008, Freddie Foxxx (using his Bumpy Knuckles pseudonym) released the long-shelved Crazy Like A Foxxx album. The second of two discs featured DITC produced demo versions of the original tracks dating to 1993. DITC production contrasted with the Jailhouse version of production from 1994. In 2011, Showbiz stated that the crew itself is now defunct and will no longer create any new albums in the future citing musical creative differences. However, member O.C. confirmed that the group would indeed record a brand new album with production so far from Diamond D and Lord Finesse, while awaiting Buckwild. He stated that their deceased member Big L would not want them to end their legacy like this. On October 28, 2016, D.I.T.C. released Sessions, preceded by the lead single \\"Rock Shyt\\".

Bidwell, 182 U.S. 1 (1901), was one of a group of the first Insular Cases decided by the US Supreme Court. The case was argued on January 8-11, 1901 and was decided on May 27, 1901. Background The DeLima Sugar Importing Company sued the New York City collector of customs to recover duties on sugar imported from Puerto Rico after 1899, when Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States. DeLima argued that the Port of New York City had no jurisdiction to collect duties since Puerto Rico had been annexed by the United States. The lower appellate court held the following: # Although the collector had the right to challenge the factual sufficiency, he was barred from challenging federal jurisdiction on the basis of wrongful removal where the case was removed upon his own petition. # The Customs Administrative Act did not decide whether the sugar was imported from a foreign country and so the court case was a proper legal action. # Puerto Rico was not a foreign country for tariff purposes but was a United States territory because by the Treaty of Paris, the district was ceded to and in the possession of the United States. It was not necessary for an Act of Congress to embrace the territory for the purpose of tariff laws. Therefore, the duties on sugar were illegal, and DeLima Sugar Importing Company was entitled to for a refund of its duties on sugar. Decision The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that Puerto Rico, since its cession to the United States by the Treaty of Paris (1898), was not a foreign country for the purposes of US tariff laws, which required payment of duties on goods moving into the United States from a foreign country. In the absence of congressional legislation, the US government could not collect customs duties on sugar from Puerto Rico shipped to other parts of the United States by classifying Puerto Rico as a foreign country.Torruella, Juan.

Bid shading is used for one of two purposes. In a common value auction with incomplete information, bid shading is used to compensate for the winner's curse. In such auctions, the bid is worth the same amount to all bidders, but bidders don't know the value of the good and must independently estimate it. Since all bidders value the good equally, the winner will generally be the bidder whose estimate of the value is largest. But if we assume that in general bidders estimate the value accurately, then the highest bidder has overestimated the good's value and will end up paying more than it is worth. In other words, winning the auction carries bad news about a bidder's value estimate. A savvy bidder will anticipate this, and reduce their bid accordingly. Bid shading is also used in first-price auctions, where the winning bidder pays the amount of his bid. If a participant bids an amount equal to their value for the good, they would gain nothing by winning the auction, since they are indifferent between the money and the good. Bidders will optimize their expected value by accepting a lower chance of winning in return for a higher payoff if they win. In a first- price common value auction, a savvy bidder should shade for both of the above purposes. Bid shading is not only a normative theoretical construct, it was detected in the above-mentioned real world auction markets. Previous theoretical work on sequential auctions focused either on bid shading in an exogenous sequence of auctions, or on strategic auctioning to short-lived buyers, who never want to shade their bids. This paper provides the first model of a sequential auction with both endogenous strategic selling and forward-looking longer-lived buyers who can shade their bids. The model‚Äôs contribution is the analysis of the best response of the seller to strategic bid shading, and the exposition of a market equilibrium, in which bidders do not always shade. The most related model of bidding is Jeitschko (1999), who finds that relatively to exogenous and certain future supply, exogenous but uncertain future supply leads to a proportional bid increase. In contrast, high-valuation bidders shade more than low valuation bidders here. The most related model of optimal sequential auctioning by Vulcano, van Ryzin, and Maglaras (2002) (VRM), who study a monopolist selling to unit-demand strategic buyers who each only lives for one period. While VRM‚Äôs bidders do not shade their bids by assumption, strategic sequential auctioning has an effect on their bidding strategy because they are forward-looking: there is an incentive to overbid and make the seller sell more units in the current period than would be optimal for her.

Description Mountain sorrel is a perennial plant with a tough taproot that grows to a height of . It grows in dense tufts, with stems that are usually unbranched and hairless. Both flowering stems and leaf stalks are somewhat reddish. The leaves are kidney-shaped, somewhat fleshy, on stalks from the basal part of the stem. Flowers are small, green and later reddish, and are grouped in an open upright cluster. The fruit is a small nut, encircled by a broad wing which finally turns red. Forming dense, red tufts, the plant is easily recognized. Oxyria digyna grows in wet places protected by snow in winter. Oxyria (from Greek) means \\"sour\\". Distribution and habitat Mountain sorrel is common in the tundra of the Arctic. Further south, it has a circumboreal distribution, growing in high mountainous areas in the Northern Hemisphere such as the Alps, the Sierra Nevada, and the Cascade Range. It typically grows in alpine meadows, scree, snow-bed sites and beside streams. On the coast of Norway, the pollen of this plant has been found in peat bogs that are 12,600 years old, indicating that it must have been one of the first plants to colonise the area after the retreating ice age glaciers. Deer and elk favor the plant. Uses The leaves of mountain sorrel have a fresh acidic taste and are rich in vitamin C, containing about 36 mg/100 g.Vitamin C in the Diet of Inuit Hunters From Holman, Northwest Territories They were used by the Inuit to prevent and cure scurvy, and can be used in salads. The above- ground parts of the plant are edible when cooked. The plant is important for both insects and larger animals that feed on it in arctic and alpine regions where it occurs.Tolvanen, A., Alatalo, J.M. and Henry, G.H.R. 2004. \\"Resource allocation patterns in a forb and a sedge in two arctic environments - short- term response to herbivory\\". ‚Äì Nordic Journal of Botany 22 (6): 741‚Äì747.

By 2000, the school's headmaster, who had been in the position for ten years, resigned at the request of the board of trustees over allegations of financial mismanagement; audits revealed a deficit of $900,000 for 2000 and $375,000 for 1999.Tara Bahrampour, At Brooklyn Friends School, A Dispute Within the Family, New York Times (March 12, 2000). The outgoing headmaster denied any impropriety, and some parents defended his leadership. The school had about 400 students in 1995Michael Cooper, Brooklyn Friends: Still Keeping the Precepts, New York Times (August 6, 1995). and about 107 teachers in 2000. The school was once owned by the Quakers' New York Quarterly Meeting, but the school and the Quaker meeting ended their affiliation in 2010.Sarah Maslin Nir, Quakers and Elite School Share Uneasy Ground, New York Times (April 1, 2011). Few of the school's modern-day students are Quaker, although the school culture and curriculum incorporate Quaker ideals. The school's charter specifies that half of the board of trustees must be Quaker and one of the two chairs of the board must be appointed by the Quakers. Academics Brooklyn Friends School is split into four academic levels: Preschool, Lower School (K-4), Middle School (5-8), and Upper School (9-12). Lower School (K-4) The Lower School curriculum includes classes in language arts, mathematics, social studies, science, Spanish, dance, music, visual arts, woodworking, physical education, and health. Middle School (5-8) The middle school curriculum includes classes in the humanities (English and history), mathematics, science, languages, visual arts, performing arts, physical education, health/life skills, organization and study skills and information technology. Upper School (9-12) The Brooklyn Friends Upper School curriculum includes the arts, humanities, sciences, and ethics. Brooklyn Friends School offers the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme for students in the 11th and 12th grades. Faculty and staff union and decertification efforts In spring 2019, more than 80% of faculty and staff members at the school voted to unionize. The school did not object at the time. In late 2019, collective bargaining over contracts began, and union representatives participated in negotiations over the layoffs of about 30 teachers due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. In August 2020, however, the school's leadership move to dissolve the faculty and staff members' union, citing a National Labor Relations Board decision several months earlier that reversed an Obama administration-era NLRB decision that allowed employees of religiously affiliated institutions the right to form unions. The school's move to decertify the union prompted opposition from many parents, who believed the school was betraying its progressive and Quaker values by engaging in \\"hypocritical union-busting\\"; over 1,000 parents and alumni signed a petition calling on the school to halt its efforts to decertify the union, and about 130 teachers and staff members signed a similar petition of their own.

Moorestown, 263 F. Supp. 2d 887 (D.N.J. 2003), was a 2003 case in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey that considered whether grades received by a student with a disability for classes where accommodations had been made under an Individualized Education Program could be discounted in awarding valedictorian honors. Blair Hornstine, then in her final year at Moorestown High School, sued the Moorestown Township (New Jersey) Public Schools Board of Education to stop them \\"from retroactively applying to her a proposed policy amendment that would allow the designation of multiple valedictorians\\". Under the then existing school policy, Hornstine would have been the sole recipient of the honor.  Valedictorian controversy  Under the published school board policy for the 2002-2003 academic year, the graduating senior student with the highest seventh semester weighted grade point average (GPA) was to be named the valedictorian, and the second highest student was to be named the salutatorian. At the end of the fall 2002 semester, the seventh for her class, Hornstine had the highest weighted grade point average in the senior class, 4.689, a score 0.055 higher than the runner-up's 4.634. In the fall of 2002, Moorestown Superintendent of Schools Paul J. Kadri was approached by \\"parents, students, and other community members\\" who complained that \\"students were not provided equal opportunities to earn the awards\\" because of accommodations granted to Hornstine. Kadri held meetings at the high school in early 2003 in which he discussed changing the school policy to allow multiple valedictorians. In April, Kadri proposed an amendment to the existing policy that read \\"In determining the recipients of [the awards of valedictorian and salutatorian], the Board may review the program of study, manner of instruction, and other relevant issues, and in its discretion, with the assistance of the administration, may designate multiple valedictorians and/or salutatorians to ensure that all students have an equal opportunity to compete for these awards.\\" The proposal was to be voted on by the school board on May 12. Suit On May 1, Hornstine filed a complaint in Federal District Court seeking an injunction to prevent the school board from changing its policy retroactively, as well as $2.7 million in damages. Kadri sent a letter to the runner-up advising him he was under consideration for valedictorian honors. Kadri sent no similar letter to Hornstine. Blair Hornstine was classified with a disability, reportedly a type of chronic fatigue syndrome or immune deficiency, but its exact nature was never disclosed publicly. She received an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) approved by the school board. Kadri contended that because of the \\"availability of many AP courses in her home instruction program\\" Hornstine \\"was able to earn more 'weighted' grades\\" than other students. Moorestown High School assigned a higher weight to Advanced Placement (AP) courses and honors courses in calculating a student's GPA. An A+ grade, worth 4 point towards the GPA in a regular course, counted as 5 points in an AP course and 4.5 points in an honors course. Kadri further claimed \\"she was also able to secure higher grades in her home instruction classes than students enrolled in the same courses at Moorestown High School.\\" The court rejected those claims pointing out that the runner up had taken two more AP courses than Hornstine, and while she had taken three more honors courses than the runner up, the net result was a statistical advantage for the runner up. The Court also examined and rejected claims that she was graded less stringently. Superintendent Kadri claimed that Hornstine's father, a New Jersey Superior Court judge in Camden County, had told him in September that \\"he was going to manipulate rules designed to protect disabled students for the purpose of allowing to win the valedictorian award\\". Judge Hornstine denied making those statements and the assistant superintendent of schools, Judithann Keefe, who was present at the September meeting, filed an affidavit contradicting her boss and supporting Judge Hornstine's account of what was said there. Local and later national media focused intense attention on the case, leading to talk-radio scorn and an online petition calling for Harvard University to revoke Hornstine's admission to the school. Following investigation, Harvard University did revoke her admission after finding that Hornstine had plagiarized an essay she had written for a local paper. Injunction granted and settlement On May 8, 2003, U.S. District Judge Freda Wolfson ordered the Moorestown school district to follow its existing policy and name Blair Hornstine the sole valedictorian for the class of 2003. Wolfson wrote, \\"Ms. Hornstine earned her distinction as the top student in her class in spite of, not because of, her disability\\". The Court found that Hornstine met the conditions for issuing an injunction, including a likelihood of prevailing on the merits of her case. In addition to finding that \\"the Board's proposed action was intended and designed to have a particular exclusionary effect on plaintiff because of her disabled status,\\" the Court cited a ruling by the New Jersey Commissioner of Education, in a case where there was no disability issue, that barred a retroactive change to requirements for the award of valedictorian. On June 10, Hornstine, through her lawyer, Edwin Jacobs, informed the school that she would not attend graduation, which was held on June 19, and requested her valedictorian award be made in absentia, saying \\"the hostile environment at the school has traumatized Blair both physically and emotionally\\". Her house had been hit by eggs and paintballs, and she received a threatening letter. Hornstine's claim for compensatory and punitive damages was settled on August 19 for $60,000, including $45,000 in legal fees.

Johnson (August 24, 1945 ‚Äì July 6, 1992), born and also known as Malcolm Michaels Jr., was an American gay liberationI've been involved in gay liberation ever since it first started in 1969, 15:20 into the interview, Johnson is quoted as saying this. activist and self-identified drag queen. Known as an outspoken advocate for gay rights, Johnson was one of the prominent figures in the Stonewall uprising of 1969. A founding member of the Gay Liberation Front, Johnson co-founded the radical activist group Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (S.T.A.R.), alongside close friend Sylvia Rivera. A popular figure in New York City's gay and art scene, Johnson modeled for Andy Warhol, and performed onstage with the drag performance troupe Hot Peaches. Known for decades as a welcoming presence in the streets of Greenwich Village, Johnson was known as the \\"mayor of Christopher Street.\\" From 1987 through 1992, Johnson was an AIDS activist with ACT UP.  Early life  Johnson was born Malcolm Michaels Jr. on August 24, 1945, in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Michaels had six siblings and a father, Malcolm Michaels Sr., who was an assembly line worker at General Motors. Michaels' mother, Alberta Claiborne, was a housekeeper. They attended an African Methodist Episcopal Church during Michaels'/Johnson's childhood and remained devoutly religious in later life, often taking an interest in Catholicism, but also making offerings to the saints in a personal manner, keeping a private altar at home. Johnson first began wearing dresses at the age of five but stopped temporarily due to harassment by boys who lived nearby. In a 1992 interview, Johnson described being the young victim of sexual assault by an adolescent boy.: events occur at 4:21 and 4:41.: \\"Later, Johnson said in an interview toward the end of her life, she was sexually assaulted by another boy, who was around 13.\\" After this, Johnson described the idea of being gay as \\"some sort of dream\\", rather than something that seemed possible, and so chose to remain sexually inactive until leaving for New York City at 17. Johnson's mother reportedly said that being homosexual is like being \\"lower than a dog\\",: event occurs at 46:52. but Johnson said that Alberta was unaware of the LGBT community. After graduating from Edison High School (now the Thomas A. Edison Career and Technical Academy) in Elizabeth in 1963, Johnson left home for New York City with $15 and a bag of clothes. Johnson waited on tables after moving to Greenwich Village in 1966.: event occurs at 47:22. After meeting gay people in the city, Johnson finally felt it was possible to be gay and was able to come out.  Performance work and identity  Johnson initially used the moniker \\"Black Marsha\\" but later decided on the drag queen name \\"Marsha P. Johnson\\", getting Johnson from the restaurant Howard Johnson's on 42nd Street, stating that the P stood for \\"pay it no mind\\": event occurs at 37:22; : \\"In the early days she tended to go out mainly in semidrag and call herself Black Marsha. (When she later dropped the Black and started calling herself Marsha P. Johnson, she explained that the P. stood for 'Pay it no mind.')\\" and used the phrase sarcastically when questioned about gender, saying \\"it stands for pay it no mind\\". Johnson said the phrase once to a judge, who was amused by it, leading to Johnson's release. Johnson variably identified as gay, as a transvestite, and as a queen (referring to drag queen). According to Susan Stryker, a professor of human gender and sexuality studies at the University of Arizona, Johnson's gender expression could perhaps most accurately be called gender non-conforming; Johnson never self-identified with the term transgender, but the term was also not in broad use while Johnson was alive.: \\"Many transgender people have also come to hail Johnson, and her longtime friend and colleague Sylvia Rivera, as pioneering heroes. (The term transgender was not in wide use in Johnson's lifetime; she usually used female pronouns for herself, but also referred to herself as gay, as a transvestite or simply as a queen.) 'Marsha P. Johnson could be perceived as the most marginalized of people ‚Äî black, queer, gender-nonconforming, poor,' said Susan Stryker ‚Ä¶\\" Johnson's style of drag was not serious (\\"high drag\\" or \\"show drag\\") due to being unable to afford to purchase clothing from expensive stores.: event occurs at 10:11. Johnson received leftover flowers after sleeping under tables used for sorting flowers in the Flower District of Manhattan, and was known for wearing crowns of fresh flowers.: event occurs at 8:42. Johnson was tall, slender and often dressed in flowing robes and shiny dresses, red plastic high heels and bright wigs, which tended to draw attention. As Edmund White writes in his 1979 Village Voice article, \\"The Politics of Drag\\", Johnson also liked dressing in ways that would display \\"the interstice between masculine and feminine\\". A feature photo of Johnson in this article shows Johnson in a flowing wig and makeup, and a translucent shirt, pants and parka ‚Äì highlighting the ways that, quoting Kate Millett's Sexual Politics, White says, \\"she is both masculine and feminine at once.\\" There is some existing footage of Johnson doing full, glamorous, \\"high drag\\" on stage, but most of Johnson's performance work was with groups that were more grassroots, comedic, and political. ‚Äì Randolfe Wicker.

Stonewall uprising and other activism Johnson was one of the first drag queens to go to the Stonewall Inn, after they began allowing women and drag queens inside; it was previously a bar for only gay men. On the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, the Stonewall uprising occurred. While the first two nights of rioting were the most intense, the clashes with police would result in a series of spontaneous demonstrations and marches through the gay neighborhoods of Greenwich Village for roughly a week afterwards. Johnson has been named, along with Zazu Nova and Jackie Hormona, by a number of the Stonewall veterans interviewed by David Carter in his book, Stonewall: The Riots That Sparked the Gay Revolution, as being \\"three individuals known to have been in the vanguard\\" of the pushback against the police at the uprising. Johnson denied starting the uprising. In 1987, Johnson recalled arriving at around \\"2:00 [that morning]\\", that \\"the riots had already started\\" by that time and that the Stonewall building \\"was on fire\\" after police set it on fire. The riots reportedly started at around 1:20 that morning after Storm√© DeLarverie fought back against the police officer who attempted to arrest her that night. Carter writes that Robin Souza had reported that fellow Stonewall veterans and gay activists such as Morty Manford and Marty Robinson had told Souza that on the first night, Johnson \\"threw a shot glass at a mirror in the torched bar screaming, 'I got my civil rights'\\". Souza told the Gay Activists Alliance shortly afterwards that it \\"was the shot glass that was heard around the world\\". Carter, however, concluded that Robinson had given several different accounts of the night and in none of the accounts was Johnson's name brought up, possibly in fear that if he publicly credited the uprising to Johnson, then Johnson's well-known mental state and gender nonconforming, \\"could have been used effectively by the movement's opponents\\". The alleged \\"shot glass\\" incident has also been heavily disputed. Prior to Carter's book, it was claimed Johnson had \\"thrown a brick\\" at a police officer, an account that was never verified. Johnson also confirmed not being present at the Stonewall Inn when the rioting broke out, but instead had heard about it and went to get Sylvia Rivera who was at a park uptown sleeping on a bench to tell her about it. However, many have corroborated that on the second night, Johnson climbed up a lamppost and dropped a bag with a brick in it down on a police car, shattering the windshield. Marsha P. Johnson, Joseph Ratanski and Sylvia Rivera in 1973 by Gary LeGault Following the Stonewall uprising, Johnson joined the Gay Liberation Front and was active in the GLF Drag Queen Caucus.Shepard, Benjamin Heim and Ronald Hayduk (2002) From ACT UP to the WTO: Urban Protest and Community Building in the Era of Globalization. Verso. pp.156-160 On the first year anniversary of the Stonewall rebellion, on June 28, 1970, Johnson marched in the first Gay Pride rally, then called the Christopher Street Liberation Day. One of Johnson's most notable direct actions occurred in August 1970, staging a sit-in protest at Weinstein Hall at New York University alongside fellow GLF members after administrators canceled a dance when they found out was sponsored by gay organizations. Shortly after that, Johnson and close friend Sylvia Rivera co-founded the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) organization (initially titled Street Transvestites Actual Revolutionaries). The two of them became a visible presence at gay liberation marches and other radical political actions. In 1973, Johnson and Rivera were banned from participating in the gay pride parade by the gay and lesbian committee who were administering the event stating they \\"weren't gonna allow drag queens\\" at their marches claiming they were \\"giving them a bad name\\". Their response was to march defiantly ahead of the parade.Wicker, Randolfe (2014), \\"Marsha P Johnson Carols for Ma & Pa Xmas Presents\\", YouTube. During a gay rights rally at New York City Hall in the early '70s, photographed by Diana Davies, a reporter asked Johnson why the group was demonstrating, Johnson shouted into the microphone, \\"Darling, I want my gay rights now!\\": event occurs at 17:20 During another incident around this time Johnson was confronted by police officers for hustling in New York. When the officers attempted to perform an arrest, Johnson hit them with a handbag, which contained two bricks. When asked by the judge for an explanation for hustling, Johnson claimed to be trying to secure enough money for a tombstone for Johnson's husband. During a time when same-sex marriage was illegal in the United States, the judge asked what \\"happened to this alleged husband\\", Johnson responded, \\"Pig shot him\\". Initially sentenced to 90 days in prison for the assault, Johnson's lawyer eventually convinced the judge to that Bellevue Hospital would be more suitable. With Rivera, Johnson established the STAR House, a shelter for gay and trans street kids in 1972, and paid the rent for it with money they made themselves as sex workers.\\"Rapping With a Street Transvestite Revolutionary\\" in Out of the closets : voices of gay liberation. Douglas, c1972. While the House was not focused on performance, Johnson was a \\"drag mother\\" of STAR House, in the longstanding tradition of chosen family in the Black and Latino LGBT community. Johnson worked to provide food, clothing, emotional support and a sense of family for the young drag queens, trans women, gender nonconformists and other gay street kids living on the Christopher Street docks or in their house on the Lower East Side of New York.\\"Marsha P. Johnson (1944‚Äì1992) Activist, Drag Mother.\\" A Gender Variance Who's Who. May 2, 2009. Under Creative Commons License: Attribution In the 1980s Johnson continued to play an active part in street activism as a respected organizer and marshal with ACT UP. In 1992, when George Segal's Stonewall memorial was moved to Christopher Street from Ohio to recognize the gay liberation movement, Johnson commented, \\"How many people have died for these two little statues to be put in the park to recognize gay people? How many years does it take for people to see that we're all brothers and sisters and human beings in the human race? I mean how many years does it take for people to see that we're all in this rat race together.\\": event occurs at 41:06  Mental health and death  By 1966, Johnson lived on the streets and engaged in survival sex.: event occurs at 17:34. In connection with sex work, Johnson claimed to have been arrested over 100 times, and was also shot once, in the late-1970s. Johnson spoke of first having a mental breakdown in 1970.: event occurs at 20:12. According to Bob Kohler, Johnson would walk naked up Christopher Street and be taken away for two or three months to be treated with chlorpromazine, an antipsychotic medication. Upon returning, the medication would wear off over the course of one month and Johnson would then return to normal.: event occurs at 19:42. Between 1980 and Johnson's death in 1992, Johnson lived with a friend Randy Wicker, who invited Johnson to stay the night one time when it was \\"very cold out‚Äîabout 10 degrees [Fahrenheit]\\" ().: event occurs at 9:40. Though generally regarded as \\"generous and warmhearted\\" and \\"saintly\\" under the Marsha persona, Johnson's angry, violent side could sometimes emerge when Johnson was depressed or under severe stress. Some felt that it was more common for this to happen under Johnson's \\"male persona as Malcolm\\". During those moments when Johnson's violent side emerged, according to an acquaintance Robert Heide, Johnson could be aggressive and short-tempered and speak in a deeper voice and, as Malcolm, would \\"become a very nasty, vicious man, looking for fights\\". This dual personality of Johnson's has been described as \\"a schizophrenic personality at work\\". When this happened, Johnson would often get in fights and wind up hospitalized and sedated, and friends would have to organize and raise money to bail Johnson out of jail or try to secure release from places like Bellevue. In the 1979 Village Voice article, \\"The Drag of Politics,\\" by Steven Watson, and further elaborated upon by Stonewall historian Carter, it had perhaps been for this reason that other activists had been reluctant at first to credit Johnson for helping to spark the gay liberation movement of the early 1970s. Watson also reported that Johnson's saintly personality was \\"volatile\\" and listed a roster of gay bars from which Johnson had been banned. At the time of Johnson's death in 1992, Johnson was said to be increasingly sick and in a fragile state, according to Randy Wicker.: event occurs at 51:20. Shortly after the 1992 pride parade, Johnson's body was discovered floating in the Hudson River. Police initially ruled the death a suicide, but Johnson's friends and other members of the local community insisted Johnson was not suicidal and noted that the back of Johnson's head had a massive wound.Wicker, Randolfe (1992) Accessed July 26, 2015.Wicker, Randolfe (1992) Accessed July 26, 2015. According to Sylvia Rivera, their friend Bob Kohler believed Johnson had committed suicide due to an ever-increasing fragile state, which Rivera herself disputed, claiming she and Johnson had \\"made a pact\\" to \\"cross the 'river Jordan' (aka Hudson River) together\\". Those who were close to Johnson considered the death suspicious; many claimed that while Johnson did struggle mentally, this did not manifest itself as suicidal. Randy Wicker later said that Johnson may have hallucinated and walked into the river, or may have jumped into the river to escape harassers, but stated that Johnson was never suicidal. Several people came forward to say they had seen Johnson harassed by a group of \\"thugs\\" who had also robbed people. According to Wicker, a witness saw a neighborhood resident fighting with Johnson on July 4, 1992. During the fight he used a homophobic slur, and later bragged to someone at a bar that he had killed a drag queen named Marsha. The witness said that when he tried to tell police what he had seen, his story was ignored. Other locals stated later that law enforcement was not interested in investigating Johnson's death, stating that the case was about a \\"gay black man\\" and wanting little to do with at the time.: event occurs at 51:50. Johnson was cremated and, following a funeral at a local church, friends released Johnson's ashes over the river. Police allowed Seventh Avenue to be closed while Johnson's ashes were carried to the river.: event occurs at 52:07. In December 2002, a police investigation resulted in reclassification of Johnson's cause of death from \\"suicide\\" to \\"undetermined\\". Former New York politician Tom Duane fought to reopen the case, because \\"Usually when there is a death by suicide the person usually leaves a note. She didn't leave a note.\\" In November 2012, activist Mariah Lopez succeeded in getting the New York police department to reopen the case as a possible homicide. In 2016, Victoria Cruz of the Anti-Violence Project also tried to get Johnson's case reopened, and succeeded in gaining access to previously-unreleased documents and witness statements. She sought out new interviews with witnesses, friends, other activists, and police who had worked the case or had been on the force at the time of Johnson's probable murder. Some of her work to find justice for Johnson was filmed by David France for the 2017 documentary The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson.  Tributes  The 2012 documentary Pay It No Mind ‚Äì The Life and Times of Marsha P. Johnson heavily features segments from a 1992 interview with Johnson, which was filmed shortly before Johnson's death. Many friends of Johnson's from Greenwich Village are interviewed for the documentary. Johnson appears as a character in two fictional film dramas that are based on real events, including Stonewall (2015), played by Otoja Abit,Stonewall Clip \\"Marsha P. Johnson\\", In Theaters September 25, 2015, RoadsideFlix, YouTube. Accessed September 10, 2015. and Happy Birthday, Marsha! (2016), played by Mya Taylor. Both movies are creative interpretations, inspired by the Stonewall uprising. The 2017 documentary, The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson, follows trans woman Victoria Cruz of the Anti-Violence Project as she investigates Johnson's murder. Like Pay It No Mind, it relies on archival footage and interviews. New York City artist Anohni produced multiple tributes to Johnson, including baroque pop band Antony and the Johnsons (named in Johnson's honor), and a 1995 play about Johnson, The Ascension of Marsha P.

American drag queen and TV personality RuPaul has called Johnson an inspiration, describing Johnson as \\"the true Drag Mother.\\" During an episode of his show RuPaul's Drag Race in 2012, RuPaul told her contestants that Johnson \\"paved the way for all of [them]\\". In 2018 the New York Times published a belated obituary for Johnson. A large, painted mural depicting Johnson and Sylvia Rivera went on display in Dallas, Texas, in 2019 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots. The painting of the \\"two pioneers of the gay rights movement\\" in front of a transgender flag claims to be the world's largest mural honoring the trans community. On May 30, 2019, it was announced that Johnson and Sylvia Rivera would be honored with monuments at Greenwich Village, near the site of the Stonewall club. Construction is rumoured to be completed by 2021. These momuments of Johnson and Rivera will be the world's first to honor transgender activists. On May 31, 2019, queer street artists Homo Riot and Suriani created a mural, as part of the WorldPride Mural Project and Stonewall 50 ‚Äì WorldPride NYC 2019, and dedicated to Queer Liberation, featuring multiple images of Johnson. The mural, located at 2nd Avenue and Houston Street in New York City, was curated by photographer and filmmaker Daniel \\"Dusty\\" Albanese. In June 2019, Johnson was one of the inaugural fifty American \\"pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes\\" inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City's Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, and the wall's unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots. On February 1, 2020, Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York announced that the East River State Park in Brooklyn will be renamed in Johnson's honor. It will be the first New York state park named after an LGBT person. On June 30, 2020, Google celebrated Marsha P. Johnson with a Google Doodle. In August 2020 it was announced Johnson's hometown, Elizabeth, New Jersey would erect a monument to Johnson.https://www.nj.com/union/2020/08/marsha-p-johnson-late- lgbtq-activist-to-get-monument-in-nj-hometown.html  See also  * Lee Brewster ‚Äì founder of the Queens Liberation Front * Paris Is Burning ‚Äì 1990 film about black drag culture in New York City in the 1980s * Storm√© DeLarverie ‚Äì biracial lesbian whose resistance of arrest incited the first Stonewall riots * Sylvia Rivera ‚Äì fellow gay-liberation activist, close friend to Johnson * Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt ‚Äì fellow Stonewall veteran, artist, and Union County native  References Sources   External links  * = Photos = * Randy Wicker's Marsha P.

Crime rates vary significantly between racial groups. Most homicide victims in the United States are of the same race as the perpetrator. Academic research indicates that the over-representation of some racial minorities in the criminal justice system can in part be explained by socioeconomic factors, such as poverty, exposure to poor neighborhoods, poor access to public education, poor access to early childhood education, and exposure to harmful chemicals (such as lead) and pollution. Racial housing segregation has also been linked to racial disparities in crime rates, as blacks have historically and to the present been prevented from moving into prosperous low-crime areas through actions of the government (such as redlining) and private actors. Various explanations within criminology have been proposed to excuse racial disparities in crime rates, including conflict theory, strain theory, general strain theory, social disorganization theory, macrostructural opportunity theory, social control theory, and subcultural theory. Research also indicates that there is extensive racial and ethnic discrimination by police and the judicial system.Gabbidon & Greene (2005b:37); Bowling (2006:140). See also Sampson & Wilson (2005:177‚Äì178); Myrdal (1988:88). A substantial academic literature has compared police searches (showing that contraband is found at higher rates in whites who are stopped), bail decisions (showing that whites with the same bail decision as blacks commit more pre-trial violations), and sentencing (showing that blacks are more harshly sentenced by juries and judges than whites when the underlying facts and circumstances of the cases are similar), providing valid causal inferences of racial discrimination. Studies have documented patterns of racial discrimination, as well as patterns of police brutality and disregard for the constitutional rights of African-Americans, by police departments in various American cities, including Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and Philadelphia. Terminology The term \\"black on black\\" violence has been criticized for being misleading and racially charged. One columnist writing in the wake of the killing of George Floyd has accused opponents of the Black Lives Matter movement of using \\"blacks killing blacks\\" rhetoric to avoid discussions about police brutality. Researchers note that there are socioeconomic factors underlying these crime statistics, and that crime is often higher in low-income neighborhoods. Media coverage of \\"black on black\\" violence has been criticized for perpetuating racial stereotypes of violent black people. Researchers have highlighted media language drawing connections between intracommunity violence in black neighborhoods and supposed \\"moral bankruptcy\\" in black family structures and communities. Edward A. Flynn has noted that African-Americans are disproportionately murdered, accounting for 80% of murder victims in Milwaukee. Researchers have noted these arguments but say that the term black-on-black crime is \\"inaccurate and vague\\" and \\"generally offensive to black Americans\\". Crime data sources In the United States, crime data are collected from three major sources: * Law enforcement agency crime reports, collected monthly by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and processed annually as Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) * victimization surveys, collected biannually by the Bureau of Justice Statistics and processed annually in the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) * self-report surveys The Uniform Crime Reports represent the primary source of data used in the calculation of official statistics regarding serious crimes such as murder and homicide, which is supplemented by the information provided through the NCVS and self-report studies, the latter being the best indicator of actual crime rates for minor offenses such as illegal substance abuse and petty theft. These crime data collection programs provide most of the statistical information utilized by criminologists and sociologists in their analysis of crime and the extent of its relationship to race.Gabbidon & Greene (2005a:42). Another form of data is that regarding the prison population. =Uniform Crime Reports (UCR)= Established in 1927, the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) program is a summary-based reporting system that collects data on crime reported to local and state law enforcement agencies across the US. The UCR system indexes crimes under two headings: Part I and Part II offenses. Part I offenses include: murder and non-negligent homicide; non-lethal violent crimes comprising robbery, forcible rape and aggravated assault; and property crimes comprising burglary, larceny/theft, motor vehicle theft and arson. Part II offenses include fraud, forgery/counterfeiting, embezzlement, simple assault, sex offenses, offenses against the family, drug and liquor offenses, weapons offenses and other non-violent offenses excluding traffic violations.Holms, Maahs & Vito (2007:35-36). See also Gabbidon & Greene (2005a:35‚Äì38). For more information on the UCR program, see: \\"UCR Data Quality Guidelines\\" at www.fbi.gov. There are fundamental limitations of the UCR system, including:For a detailed discussion of the limitations and weaknesses of the UCR program, see Mosher, Miethe & Phillips (2002). Regardless of the limitations, one must consider that these are facts reported by law enforcement agencies and are typically more accurate than independent reporting. *Inaccuracy: UCR statistics do not represent the actual amount of criminal activity occurring in the United States. As it relies upon local law enforcement agency crime reports, the UCR program can only measure crime known to police and cannot provide an accurate representation of actual crime rates.Holms, Maahs & Vito (2007:37). See also Myrdal (1988:88-89), Gabbidon & Greene (2005a:39), Free (2009:164). *Misrepresentation: The UCR program is focused upon street crime, and does not record information on many other types of crime, such as organized crime, corporate crime or federal crime. Further, law enforcement agencies can provide inadvertently misleading data as a result of local policing practices. These factors can lead to misrepresentations regarding the nature and extent of criminal activity in the United States.Holms, Maahs & Vito (2007:37). See also Mann (1993:27;34), Free (2009:164). *Manipulation: UCR data are capable of being manipulated by local law enforcement agencies. Information is supplied voluntarily to the UCR program, and manipulation of data can occur at the local level.Holms, Maahs & Vito (2007:37). See also Mann (1993:28‚Äì29). *Race and ethnicity: The UCR tracks crime for the racial category of \\"White\\" to include both Hispanic and non-Hispanic ethnicities. According to the ACLU, with over 50 million Latinos residing in the United States, this hides the incarceration rates for Latinos vis-√†-vis marijuana-related offenses, as they are considered \\"White\\" with respect to the UCR. As a response to these and other limitations, a new system of crime data collection was established in 1988 as an outgrowth of the UCR system. The National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) is an incident- based reporting system that will collect more comprehensive and detailed data on crime from local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. As it is still under development, NIBRS coverage is not yet nationwide.Holms, Maahs & Vito (2007:37‚Äì39). See also Gabbidon & Greene (2005a:37‚Äì38). =National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)= The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) program, established in 1972, is a national survey of a representative sample of households in the United States which covers the frequency of crime victimization and the characteristics and consequences of victimization. The primary purpose behind the NCVS program is to gather information on crimes that were not reported to police, though information is also collected on reported crimes. The survey collects data on rape, assault, robbery, burglary, personal and household larceny and motor vehicle theft. The NCVS also includes supplemental questions which allow information to be gathered on tangentially relevant issues such as school violence, attitudes towards law enforcement or perceptions regarding crime.Holmes, Maahs & Vito (2007:39‚Äì43). See also Gabbidon & Greene (2005a:38‚Äì39). There are fundamental limitations to the NCVS program, including:For a detailed discussion of the limitations and weaknesses of the NCVS program, see Mosher, Miethe & Phillips (2002). See also Mann (1993:30‚Äì32). *Reliability: NCVS statistics do not represent verified or evidenced instances of victimization. As it depends upon the recollection of the individuals surveyed, the NCVS cannot distinguish between true and fabricated claims of victimization, nor can it verify the truth of the severity of the reported incidents. Further, the NCVS cannot detect cases of victimization where the victim is too traumatized to report. These factors can contribute to deficits in the reliability of NCVS statistics.Holms, Maahs & Vito (2007:43). *Misrepresentation: The NCVS program is focused upon metropolitan and urban areas, and does not adequately cover suburban and rural regions. This can lead to misrepresentations regarding the nature and extent of victimization in the United States. =Comparison of UCR and NCVS data= According to the NCVS for 1992‚Äì2000, 43% of violent criminal acts, and 53% of serious violent crime (not verbal threats, or cuts and bruises) were reported to the police. Overall, black (49%) and indigenous Americans (48%) victims reported most often, higher than whites (42%) and Asians (40%). Serious violent crime and aggravated assault against blacks (58% and 61%) and indigenous Americans (55% and 59%) was reported more often than against whites (51% and 54%) or Asians (50% and 51%). indigenous Americans were unusually unlikely to report a robbery (45%), as with Asians and a simple assault (31%).Hart & Rennison (2003:3) Despite the differences in the amount of crime reported, comparisons of the UCR and NCVS data sets show there to be a high degree of correspondence between the two systems.Holmes, Maahs & Vito (2007:39), Rand (2009:1). This correspondence extends to the racial demography of both perpetrators and victims of violent crime reported in both systems.Walsh (2004:29). For a survey of data from 1973‚Äì1992, see Zawitz et al. (1993:23); for 1993‚Äì1998, see Rennison (2001:10) =Classification of Hispanics= The UCR classifies most Hispanics into the \\"white\\" category. The NCVS classifies some Hispanic criminals as \\"white\\" and some as \\"other race\\". The victim categories for the NCVS are more distinct. According to a report by the National Council of La Raza, research obstacles undermine the census of Latinos in prison, and \\"Latinos in the criminal justice system are seriously undercounted. The true extent of the overrepresentation of Latinos in the system probably is significantly greater than researchers have been able to document. Lack of empirical data on Latinos is partially due to prisons' failures to document ethnic details at intake, or recording practices that historically have classified Latinos as white. Overall the FBI did not include a 'Latino' or 'Hispanic' category until recently and 93% of Hispanics are classified as \\"white\\" by law enforcement officers (irrespective of their ancestry) often inflating the amount of crimes attributed to whites. Crime statistics Scholars have found that some racial and ethnic minorities, particularly African Americans, are disproportionately represented in the arrest and victimization reports which are used to compile crime rate statistics in the United States. The data from 2008 reveals that black Americans are over-represented in terms of arrests made in virtually all types of crime, with the exceptions of \\"driving under the influence\\", \\"liquor laws\\" and hate crime. Overall, black Americans are arrested at 2.6 times the per- capita rate of all other Americans, and this ratio is even higher for murder (6.3 times) and robbery (8.1 times). =Homicide= US homicide victims by race, 1980‚Äì2017 US homicide offenders by race, 1980‚Äì2017 According to the FBI, African Americans accounted for 52.4% of all homicide offenders in 2018, with Whites 43.1% and \\"Other\\"/Unknown 4.4%. Of these, 15.4% were Hispanic or Latino. The per-capita offending rate for African Americans was roughly six times higher than Whites, and the victim rate is a similar figure. Most homicides were intraracial, with 81% of White victims killed by Whites and 89% of African American victims killed by African Americans. African Americans account for the majority of gun homicide victims and arrestees in the US while Whites (including Hispanics) account for the majority of non-gun homicide victims and arrestees. Of the gun murder victims in the United States between 2007 and 2016, 57% were black, 40.6% white (including Hispanic), 1.35% Asian, 0.98% unknown race and 0.48% indigenous American. Non-gun homicides represented about 30% of total murders in the time period. African Americans were also over-represented in such homicides, although only by about 2.5 times their share of the general population. Of the non-gun murder victims in the United States between 2007 to 2016, 61.5% were white (including Hispanic), 32.9% black, 2.29% Asian, 1.89% unknown race and 1.43% indigenous American. =Assault= The CDC keeps data on non-fatal injury emergency department visits and the race of victims. While non-Hispanic white victims account for approximately half of total non-fatal assault injuries, most of which did not involve any weapon, black and Hispanic victims account for the vast majority of non-fatal firearm injuries. There was a total of 17.3 million emergency department visits or hospitalizations for non-fatal assaults in the United States in the 10-year period between 2007‚Äì2016. For non-fatal assaults with recorded race, 6.5 million victims were white non-Hispanic, 4.3 million black, 2.3 million Hispanic and 0.4 million other (non-Hispanic) and for 3.8 million, the race was not recorded. There were a total of 603,000 emergency department visits in the US for non-fatal firearm assaults in the 10-year period between 2007‚Äì2016. For non-fatal firearm assaults with recorded race, 77,000 victims were white non-Hispanic, 261,000 were black and 94,000 were Hispanic, 8,500 were other non-Hispanic and for 162,000 the race was not recorded. Despite gun injuries only accounting for about 3.5% of serious assault injuries between 2007‚Äì2016 they accounted for nearly 70% of overall homicides. While African Americans are highly overrepresented in murders and gun assaults, the disparity in arrests is small for the most common form of assault not involving any weapon or serious injury (non-aggravated assault). Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites are arrested for non-aggravated assault in a similar ratio to their share of the US population. Of the 9,468 murder arrests in the US in 2017, 53.5% were black and 20.8% Hispanic. Of the 822,671 arrests for non- aggravated assault, 31.4% were black and 18.4% Hispanic. According to the FBI Uniform Crime Reports, in the year 2008 black youths, who make up 16% of the youth population, accounted for 52% of juvenile violent crime arrests, including 58.5% of youth arrests for homicide and 67% for robbery. Black youths were overrepresented in all offense categories except DUI, liquor laws and drunkenness. Racial disparities in arrest have consistently been far less among older population groups. =Robbery= According to the National Crime Victimization Survey in 2002, robberies with white victims and black offenders were more than 12 times more common than vice versa. =Victim surveys= In 1978, Michael Hindelang compared data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (then known as the National Crime Survey, or NCS) to data from the Uniform Crime Reports, both from 1974. He found that NCS data generally agreed with UCR data in regards to the percent of perpetrators of rape, robbery, and assault who were black. For instance, Hindelang's analysis found that both the NCS and UCR estimated that 62% of robbery offenders were black in the United States in 1974. A 2004 National Crime Victimization Survey report which analyzed carjacking over 10 years found that carjacking victims identified 56% of offenders as black, 21% as white, and 16% as indigenous American or Asian. =Youth crime= The \\"National Youth Gang Survey Analysis\\" (2011) state that of gang members, 46% are Hispanic/Latino, 35% are black, 11.5% are white, and 7% are other races/ethnicities.National Youth Gang Center (2009). National Youth Gang Survey Analysis. http://www.nationalgangcenter.gov/Survey- Analysis/Demographics =Hispanics= According to a 2009 report by the Pew Hispanic Center, in 2007 Latinos \\"accounted for 40% of all sentenced federal offenders ‚Äí more than triple their share (13%) of the total U.S. adult population\\". This was an increase from 24% in 1991. Between 1991 and 2007, enforcement of federal immigration laws became a growing priority in response to undocumented immigration. By 2007, among Hispanic offenders sentenced in federal courts, 48% were immigration offenses, 37% drug offenses, and 15% for other offenses. One reason for the large increase in immigration offenses is that they exclusively fall under federal jurisdiction.A Rising Share: Hispanics and Federal Crime. Pew Hispanic Center. 2009. Mark Hugo Lopez =Racially motivated hate crime= The federal government publishes a list annually of Hate Crime Statistics, 2009. Also published by the federal government is the Known Offender's Race by Bias Motivation, 2009. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation Uniform Crime Report database, in 2010 of 3,949 victims of racial hate crimes, 58.6% of reported hate crime offenders were white or hispanic-white, 18.4% of offenders were black, 8.9% were of individuals of multiple races and 1% of offenders were indigenous Americans. The report also reveals that 48% of all hate crime offenders were motivated by the victim's race, while 18% were based on the victim's religion, and another 18% were based on the victim's sexual orientation. The report states that among hate crime offenses motivated by race, 70% were composed of anti-black bias, while 17.7% were of anti-white bias, and 5% were of anti-Asian or Pacific Islander bias. =Racial composition of geographic areas= Studies have examined that ethnic/racially heterogeneous areas, most often neighborhoods in large cities, have higher crime rates than more homogeneous areas. Most studies find that the more ethnically/racially heterogeneous an area is, the higher its crime rates tend to be.Handbook of Crime Correlates; Lee Ellis, Kevin M. Beaver, John Wright; 2009; Academic Press Studies examining the relationship between percentages of different races in an area and crime rates have generally either found similar relationships as for nationwide crime rates or no significant relationships. Most often studied are correlations between black and Hispanic populations in a given area and crime. According to a study in the American Journal of Sociology, a positive correlation exists between the percentage of black males in a neighborhood and perceptions of neighborhood crime rates, even after controlling other correlating factors and neighborhood characteristics. The study was conducted amongst the perceptions of residents in neighborhoods in Chicago, Seattle, and Baltimore in comparison with census data and police department crime statistics. Survey respondents consistently rated African Americans as more prone to violence than the data and statistics stated leading to the conclusion that the stereotype of blacks as more likely criminals is deeply embedded in the collective consciousness and societal norms of Americans. Such data may reveal a possible connection, but is functionally inconclusive due to a variety of other correlating factors which overlap with race and ethnicity. =Trends= Some studies have argued for smaller racial disparities in violent crime in recent times. However, a study of government data from 1980‚Äì2008 found that the reduction in Black violent crime relative to White violent crime was an artifact of those previous studies, which was due to Hispanic offenders being counted as White in the comparison. The Hispanic population has been increasing rapidly and Hispanics have violence rates higher than that of Whites but lower than that of Blacks. Explanations for racial discrepanciesDiscrimination by law enforcement= Research suggests that police practices, such as racial profiling, over-policing in areas populated by minorities and in-group bias may result in disproportionately high numbers of racial minorities among crime suspects. In- group bias has been observed when it comes to traffic citations, as black and white cops are more likely to cite out-groups. A 2013 report by the American Civil Liberties Union found that blacks were \\"3.73 times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana possession,\\" even though \\"blacks and whites use drugs, including marijuana, at similar rates.\\" A 2020 study in the journal Nature found that black drivers were stopped more often than white drivers, and that the threshold by which police decided to search black and Hispanic drivers was lower than that for whites (judging by the rate at which contraband was found in searches). Analysis of more than 20 million traffic stops in North Carolina showed that blacks were more than twice as likely as whites to be pulled over by police for traffic stops, and that blacks were more likely to be searched following the stop. There were no significant difference in the likelihood that Hispanics would be pulled over, but Hispanics were much more likely to be searched following a traffic stop than whites. When the study controlled for searches in high-crime areas, it still found that police disproportionately targeted black individuals. These racial disparities were particularly pronounced for young men. The study found that whites who were searched were more likely to carry contraband than blacks and Hispanics. In-group bias by voters has also been suggested as possibly causing disparities, as voters discount criminal acts done by their in-group and thus will vote for higher enforcement in areas where the minority population is higher due to the lack of in-group leniency, allowing for racial disparities in the justice system even if the authorities are unbiased.Bose, Amartya. \\"Racial disparities in law enforcement: The role of in-group bias and electoral pressures.\\" (2020). A 2018 study in the Journal of Empirical Legal Studies found that law enforcement officers in Texas who could charge shoplifters with two types of crimes (one more serious, one less so) due to a vaguely worded statute were more likely to charge blacks and Hispanics with the more serious crime. A 2019 study, which made use of a dataset of the racial makeup of every U.S. sheriff over a 25-year period, found that \\"ratio of Black‚Äêto‚ÄêWhite arrests is significantly higher under White sheriffs\\" and that the effects appear to be \\"driven by arrests for less‚Äêserious offenses and by targeting Black crime types.\\" A 2019 study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology found that facial-recognition systems were substantially more likely to misidentify the faces of racial minorities. Some ethnic groups, such as Asian-Americans and African-American, were up to 100 times more likely to be misidentified than white men. A 2018 study in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that tall young black men are especially likely to receive unjustified attention by law enforcement. The authors furthermore found a \\"causal link between perceptions of height and perceptions of threat for Black men, particularly for perceivers who endorse stereotypes that Black people are more threatening than White people.\\" =Childhood exposure to violence= Research shows that childhood exposure to violence significantly increases the likelihood to engage in violent behavior. When studies control for childhood exposure to violence, black and white males are equally likely to engage in violent behavior. White and black families have no major difference in child abuse except in the $6,000-$11,999 income range (which falls under the Poverty Threshold in the United States). A study in Australia showed a direct correlation to poverty in later life from childhood abuse. While poverty in the United States and Australia are not the same, a general understanding of the negative effects of childhood abuse later in life has been found, many of these effects being contributing factors to poverty. A paper written by Anna Aizer, analyzes the disadvantages children face when they are exposed to frequent neighborhood violence. In a survey of 2248 6th, 8th, and 10th graders in an urban public school system, ‚ÄúSchwab-Stone et al (1995) found that 40% of youth reported exposure to a shooting or a stabbing in the past year. Children exposed to high levels of violence were more likely to be black and/or Latino‚Ä¶‚Äù. Using ANOVA to observe differences in child outcomes, they found that exposure to violence is associated with willingness to use physical aggression, diminished perception of risk, lowered expectations of the future, substance use, and low academic achievement. The Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Study (LA FANS) studied a representative sample of all neighborhoods in LA and evaluated the conditions and circumstances in which each family was living under. Families were randomly selected within each neighborhood and interviews were conducted with adults, caregivers, and children. 21% of children reported having violent peers that were a part of gangs, 11% reported being robbed, 8% reported witnessing a shooting within the past year. =Inability to post bail= According to a 2017 study in the Journal of Law and Economics, \\"Higher pretrial detention rates among minority defendants explain 40 percent of the black-white gap in rates of being sentenced to prison and 28 percent of the Hispanic-white gap.\\" The majority of individuals held in pretrial detention are being held because they cannot afford to post bail. The individuals in pretrial detention face higher incentives to plead guilty (even if they are innocent) for a number of reasons, which leads to a higher sentencing rates for these individuals. =Socioeconomic factors= Evidence supporting the role of structural factors in high black crime rates comes from multiple studies. For example, Robert J. Sampson has reported that most of the reason violent crime rates are so high among blacks originates mainly from unemployment, economic deprivation, and family disorganization. Specifically, he found that \\"the scarcity of employed black men increases the prevalence of families headed by females in black communities\\" and that the increased prevalence of such families in turn results in family disruption that significantly increases black murder and robbery rates. Sampson, et al. and Phillips have reported that at least half of the black-white homicide offending differential is attributable to structural neighborhood factors like parents' marital status and social context. Multiple other studies have found a link between black crime rates and structural factors, such as single-parent families and structural inequality. While there is a correlation between blacks and Hispanics and crime, the data imply a much stronger tie between poverty and crime than crime and any racial group, when gender is taken into consideration. The direct correlation between crime and class, when factoring for race alone, is relatively weak. When gender, and familial history are factored, class correlates more strongly with crime than race or ethnicity. Studies indicate that areas with low socioeconomic status may have the greatest correlation of crime with young and adult males, regardless of racial composition, though its effect on females is negligible. A 1996 study looking at data from Columbus, Ohio found that differences in disadvantage in city neighborhoods explained the vast majority of the difference in crime rates between blacks and whites, and two 2003 studies looking at violent offending among juveniles reached similar conclusions. =Housing segregation= A 1996 study found a strong association between black-white spatial isolation and rates of black violence, consistent with the hypothesis that segregation is responsible for higher rates of black crime. Multiple other studies have reached similar conclusions. However, correlation does not equal causation, and the disproportionately higher crime rates seen in black communities‚Äîas well as the reason for their segregation‚Äîcan be attributed to a number of underlying symptoms. Additionally, \\"Hagan and Peterson (1995) further propose that the segregation of racial minorities in sections of concentrated poverty contributes to inferior educational and employment opportunities, which, in turn, enhance the likelihood of crime and delinquency.\\" Theories of causation Historically, crime statistics have played a central role in the discussion of the relationship between race and crime in the United States.See Gabbidon & Greene (2005a:31-53), Gabbidon (2007:4). As they have been designed to record information not only on the kinds of crimes committed, but also on the individuals involved in crime, criminologists and sociologists have and continue to use crime rate statistics to make general statements regarding the racial demographics of crime-related phenomena such as victimization, arrests, prosecutions, convictions, and incarceration. Regardless of their views regarding causation, scholars acknowledge that some racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately represented in the arrest and victimization reports which are used to compile crime rate statistics.See Gabbidon & Greene (2005a:31-33); Walsh (2004:19‚Äì36); Wright (2009:143‚Äì144). There is, however, a great deal of debate regarding the causes of that disproportionality. Sociologist Orlando Patterson has explained these controversies as disputes between liberal and conservative criminologists in which each camp focuses on mutually exclusive aspects of the causal net, with liberals focusing on factors external to the groups in question and conservatives focusing on internal cultural and behavioral factors.O. Patterson, Rituals of Blood (1998:ix) as quoted in Walsh (2004:vii). =History= W. E. B. Du Bois, one of the pioneers in the study of race and crime in the United States. The relationship between race and crime has been an area of study for criminologists since the emergence of anthropological criminology in the late 19th century.See Gabbidon & Greene (2009:xxvii-xxviii). Cesare Lombroso, founder of the Italian school of criminology, argued that criminal behavior was the product of biological factors, including race. He was among the first criminologists to claim a direct link between race and crime.Bowling & Phillips (2002:57). This biological perspective, sometimes seen as racist and increasingly unpopular, was criticized by early 20th century scholars, including Frances Kellor, Johan Thorsten Sellin and William Du Bois, who argued that other circumstances, such as social and economic conditions, were the central factors which led to criminal behavior, regardless of race. Du Bois traced the causes of the disproportional representation of Blacks in the criminal justice system back to the improperly handled emancipation of Black slaves in general and the convict leasing program in particular. In 1901, he wrote: > There are no reliable statistics to which one can safely appeal to measure > exactly the growth of crime among the emancipated slaves. About seventy per > cent of all prisoners in the South are black; this, however, is in part > explained by the fact that accused Negroes are still easily convicted and > get long sentences, while whites still continue to escape the penalty of > many crimes even among themselves. And yet allowing for all this, there can > be no reasonable doubt but that there has arisen in the South since the > [civil] war a class of black criminals, loafers, and ne'er-do-wells who are > a menace to their fellows, both black and white.Du Bois (2005:5). The debate that ensued remained largely academic until the late 20th century, when the relationship between race and crime became a recognized field of specialized study in criminology. Helen T. Greene, professor of justice administration at Texas Southern University, and Shaun L. Gabbidon, professor of criminal justice at Pennsylvania State University, note that many criminology and criminal justice programs now either require or offer elective courses on the topic of the relationship between race and crime.Gabbidon & Greene (2009:xxvii). =Modern theories of causationConflict theory Conflict theory is considered \\"one of the most popular theoretical frameworks among race and crime scholars\\".Gabbidon (2007:171). For an overview of conflict theory in race and crime studies, see Gabbidon (2007:141‚Äì177), Henderson (2009:174‚Äì175). Rather than one monolithic theory, conflict theory represents a group of closely related theories which operate on a common set of fundamental assumptions.For an overview, see Gabbidon (2007:141‚Äì177). As a general theory of criminal behavior, conflict theory proposes that crime is an inevitable consequence of the conflict which arises between competing groups within society. Such groups can be defined through a number of factors, including class, economic status, religion, language, ethnicity, race or any combination thereof. Further, conflict theory proposes that crime could be largely eliminated if the structure of society were to be changed.See Gabbidon (2007:155;171). The form of conflict theory which emphasizes the role of economics, being heavily influenced by the work of Karl Marx and sometimes referred to as Marxist criminology, views crime as a natural response to the inequality arising from the competition inherent in capitalist society.Gabbidon (2007:141). Sociologists and criminologists emphasizing this aspect of social conflict argue that, in a competitive society in which there is an inequality in the distribution of goods, those groups with limited or restricted access to goods will be more likely to turn to crime. Dutch criminologist Willem Adriaan Bonger, one of the first scholars to apply the principles of economic determinism to the issue of crime, argued that such inequality as found in capitalism was ultimately responsible for the manifestation of crime at all levels of society, particularly among the poor. Though this line of thinking has been criticized for requiring the establishment of a utopian socialist society,Gabbidon (2007:171). the notion that the disproportionality observed in minority representation in crime rate statistics could be understood as the result of systematic economic disadvantage found its way into many of the theories developed in subsequent generations. Culture conflict theory, derived from the pioneering work of sociologist Thorsten Sellin, emphasizes the role of culturally accepted norms of conduct in the formation of cultural groups and the conflicts which arise through their interaction. Culture conflict theory argues that the group with the most power in any society ensures that their values, traditions and behaviors, which Sellin referred to as \\"conduct norms\\", are those to which all other members of society are forced to conform, and any actions which conflict with the interests of the dominant group are identified as deviant and/or criminal in nature. Sellin's original ideas continued to be developed throughout the 20th century, most notably by George Vold in the 1950s and Austin Turk in the 1960s, and continue to influence the contemporary debate.Gabbidon (2007:148-151). The recent work of Gregory J. Howard, Joshua D. Freilich and Graeme R. Newman applies culture conflict theory to the issue of immigrant and minority crime around the world. According to their research, while culturally homogeneous groups experience little to no cultural conflict, as all the members share the same set of \\"conduct norms\\", culturally heterogeneous groups, such as modern industrial nations with large immigrant populations, display heightened competition between sets of cultural norms which, in turn, leads to an increase in violence and crime. Societies which have high levels of cultural diversity in their population, it is claimed, are more likely to have higher rates of violent crime. According to conflict theorists such as Marvin Wolfgang, Hubert Blalock and William Chambliss, the disproportionate representation of racial minorities in crime statistics and in the prison population is the result of race- and class-motivated disparities in arrests, prosecutions and sentencing rather than differences in actual participation in criminal activity, an approach which has also been taken by proponents of critical race theory.Delgado & Stafancic (2001:113‚Äì114). This line of argumentation is generally seen as part of a wider approach to race-related issues referred to as the Discrimination Thesis, which assumes that differences in the treatment received by people of minority racial background in a number of public institutions, including the criminal justice, education and health care systems, is the result of overt racial discrimination. Opposed to this view is the Non-Discrimination Thesis, which seeks to defend these institutions from such accusations.For a brief overview, see Gabbidon & Greene (2005a:83‚Äì84). At the time it was first proposed, conflict theory was considered outside the mainstream of more established criminological theories, such as strain theory, social disorganization theory and differential association theory.Sims (2009:142). Barbara D. Warner, associate professor of criminal justice and police studies at Eastern Kentucky University, notes that conflict theory has been the subject of increasing criticism in recent years. Recent studies claim that, while there may have been real sentencing differences related to non-legal characteristics such as race in the 1960s, sentencing discrimination as described by the conflict theorists at that time no longer exists. Criticism has also pointed to the lack of testability of the general theory. While much research has been done to correlate race, income level and crime frequency, typically of less serious criminal behavior such as theft or larceny, research has shown there to be no significant correlation between race, income level and crime seriousness. Thus, conflict theory encounters difficulties in attempting to account for the high levels of violent crime such as murder, homicide and rape, in minority populations.Warner (1989:71‚Äì72). Strain (anomie) theory Strain theory, which is largely derived from the work of Robert K. Merton in the 1930s and 1940s, argues that social structures within society which lead to inequality and deprivation in segments of its population indirectly encourage those segments to commit crime. According to strain theory, differences in crime rates between races are the result of real differences in behavior, but to be understood as an attempt to alleviate either absolute or relative deprivation and adapt to the existing opportunity structure.Oliver (2000:283). See also Gottfredson & Hirschi (1990:152). A more recent approach to strain theory was proposed by Steven F. Messner and Richard Rosenfeld in the 1990s. In their version of the theory, which they refer to as institutional anomie theory, Messner and Rosenfeld argue that the dominance of materialistic concerns and measurements of success manifested in the American Dream weakens the effectiveness of informal social control mechanisms and support processes, which encourages economic gain by any means, legal or illegal. In those segments of the population which experience the greatest relative deprivation, therefore, there is readiness to turn to crime to overcome inequality and eliminate relative deprivation.Oliver (2000:283). Critics of strain theory point to its weaknesses when compared with actual criminal behavior patterns. Michael R. Gottfredson and Travis Hirschi argue that strain theory \\"misconstrue(s) the nature of the criminal act, supplying it with virtues it does not possess.\\" They further point out that, while strain theory suggests that criminals should tend to target people in a more advantageous economic situation than themselves, they more often victimize individuals who live in the same economic circumstances.Gottfredson & Hirschi (1990:152). General strain theory Multiple studies have found evidence that Agnew's general strain theory explains much of the difference in crime between blacks and whites. Social disorganization theory Social disorganization theory proposes that high rates of crime are largely the result of a heterogeneous and impoverished social ecology.Guerrero (2009:762). Proponents of the theory point to the process of urban decay as a major contributing factor to the breakdown of healthy urban communities which would normally curb the spread of many forms of criminal behavior. The diversity of minority cultures present in poverty-stricken neighborhoods prevents the formation of strong social bonds and leaves inhabitants uninterested in maintaining positive community relationships. This has been observed to increase the likelihood of crime in certain urban areas, which can lead to increased policing and a further breakdown of familial structures as a result of arrests, which, in turn, precipitates more crime. Social disorganization theory has been instrumental in establishing the notion that stable, culturally homogeneous communities have lower rates of delinquency and crime regardless of race.Guerrero (2009:763). Macrostructural opportunity theory Phillippia Simmons reports that many of the studies which have investigated intra- and interracial crime seek to explain this through a theory of macrostructural opportunity which states that interracial violence is primarily a function of opportunity and access.Simmons (2009:398) According to this theory, intraracial crime rates remain relatively high due to the fact that much of the US remains residentially segregated. She notes that this theory predicts that, if residential areas were more racially integrated, intraracial crime would decrease and interracial crime would increase correspondingly. However, she also notes that not all researchers on the topic of intraracial crime agree with this result, with some pointing to other macrostructural factors, such as income and education, which may negate the effect of race on inter- and intraracial crime. Anthony Walsh criticizes the attempt to use the macrostructural opportunity model to explain interracial rape as has been done in studies conducted in the past few decades, pointing out that such a defense is directly contradicted by the data related to homicide. Walsh argues that the macrostructural opportunity model helps explain why black murderers almost always choose black victims.Walsh (2004:24‚Äì25). There are disparities in rates of reporting rape where victims of some races are statistically less likely or more likely to report their rape, especially depending on the race of the offender. Black women in America are more likely to report sexual assault that has been perpetrated by a stranger.Furtado, C., Perceptions of Rape: Cultural, Gender, and Ethnic Differences. Sex Crimes and Paraphilia. Hickey, E.W., 385‚Äì395 Black women are more likely to under-report rapes overall as they are more likely to blame themselves, feel they will be blamed or feel they won't be believed. Social control theory Social control theory, which is among the most popular theories in criminology,Higgins (2009:761), Gabbidon (2007:187). proposes that crime is most commonly perpetrated by individuals who lack strong bonds or connections with their social environment.For an overview, see Higgins (2009:759‚Äì762). Based upon Travis Hirschi's Causes of Delinquency (1969), social bonding theory pioneered the notion that criminologists can gain useful insight into the motives behind criminal behavior by examining what normally motivates individuals to refrain from crime. From this it is argued that, in those segments of the population where such motivation is lacking, crime will be more prevalent. Hirschi was explicit in mentioning that he believed his theory held true across all racial boundaries, and subsequent research‚Äîboth in the US and abroad‚Äîseems to confirm this belief.Gabbidon 2007:187‚Äì192). The core idea of social control theory is elaborated upon in several other theories of causation, particularly social disorganization theory. Subculture of violence theory As a theory of criminal behavior, subculture of violence theory claims that certain groups or subcultures exist in society in which violence is viewed as an appropriate response to what, in the context of that subculture, are perceived as threatening situations. Building upon the work of cultural anthropologist Walter B. Miller's focal concerns theory, which focused on the social mechanisms behind delinquency in adolescents, sociologists Marvin Wolfgang and Franco Ferracuti proposed that the disproportionally high rate of crime among African Americans could be explained by their possessing a unique racial subculture in which violence is experienced and perceived in a manner different from that commonly observed in mainstream American culture.Covington (1995:182-183). The work referred to is The Subculture of Violence: Towards an Integrated Theory in Criminology by Wolfgang & Ferracuti (1967). See also Hawkins (1983:247-248), Gabbidon & Greene (2005a:75-78). For a general review, see Gabbidon (2007:91‚Äì100), Clevenger (2009:780-783). As to the origins of this subculture of violence among African Americans, sociologists promoting the theory have pointed towards their Southern heritage. As noted in several studies conducted throughout the 1960s and 1970s, there is a traditional north‚Äìsouth discrepancy in the distribution of homicide in the US, regardless of race, and this, it was argued, indicates that lower-class Southern Blacks and Whites share the same subculture of violence.Hawkins (1983:248). The empirical basis for the subculture of violence theory, however, has been described as \\"extremely limited and unpersuasive\\". Very little has been done to attempt an adequate assessment of supposedly criminogenic subcultural values, and several studies conducted in the late 1970s claimed to falsify the assumptions upon which the subculture of violence theory depends. More recently, scholars have criticized the theory as potentially racist in nature in its implication of one given ethnicity or culture supposedly being less fit for or less worthy of being qualified as \\"civilized\\", the built-in implication of which in turn would denote stereotypically \\"white\\" behavior as an objective norm for all societies to follow.See Gabbidon (2007:99). The hypothesis was reconsidered recently by Barry Latzer, who suggested that black Americans had inherited a subculture of violence from white Southern American honor culture (who themselves had developed that culture from the brutal and lawless border region of northern Britain) and that difference in crime rates could be partially explained by this contemporary manifestation of Southern honor culture.Latzer, Barry, The Rise and Fall of Violent Crime in America, Encounter Books, 2016, Latzer, Barry. Subcultures of violence and African American crime rates. Journal of Criminal Justice 54 (2018): 41‚Äì49. Latzer's argument was criticized by German Lopez for not adequately demonstrating the alleged causality between culture and crime, and for not accounting for the decrease in crime rates in the 20th century or clearly defining the limits of what would constitute \\"culture\\" for the purposes of Latzer's argument.Lopez, German Confronting the myth that \\"black culture\\" is responsible for violent crime in America, Vox, September 1, 2016 See also * Crime in the United States * Incarceration in the United States * Race and crime * Race and intelligence * Race and inequality in the United States * Race and the War on Drugs * Race in the United States * Race in the United States criminal justice system * Racial bias in criminal news * Racial profiling in the United States * Racial formation theory ReferencesBibliography *Barak, Gregg; Flavin, Jeanne; Leighton, Paul (2007).

She has also been involved in politics, and in 2006 and 2008 ran as the Democratic candidate for Ohio's 2nd congressional district, losing twice to Jean Schmidt.  Early life and education Wulsin was born in Elyria, Ohio, the daughter of a teacher and a social worker. She attended high school in Ohio, and earned a B.A. from Harvard University. After college, she returned to Ohio and earned a medical degree from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland in 1980 . She earned a masters in Public Health (1982) and a doctorate in Epidemiology (1985), both from the Harvard University School of Public Health. Wulsin has obtained medical licenses in Massachusetts (1981) and Ohio (1989). Career From 1989 to 1995, Wulsin was Director of Epidemiology in the City of Cincinnati's Health Department. From 1986-2001, she worked in various capacities for theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. In April 2003, Wulsin founded SOTENI International, a non- profit organization to fight AIDS in Africa. It has its headquarters in Cincinnati and an office in Kenya. SOTENI assists those women and orphans who have been most affected by the AIDS pandemic.History, SOTENI International Soteni is a Swahili word which translates as \\"all of us\\".\\"soteni\\", kamusiproject.org On January 26, 2011, during the award of a charter to the Mount Kenya University in Thika, Wulsin was installed as its first Chancellor. =Politics= Her interest in public health and larger social issues led her into politics, and she has run for office as a representative of her district to Congress three times, but has not been elected. 2005 special election for Congress  Wulsin was a candidate for the Democratic nomination for Congress to replace Rob Portman in the Second District of Ohio in the special primary held June 14, 2005. In the Democratic primary, Wulsin finished second behind Paul Hackett. She received 3,800 votes (27.35%). She had campaigned to reform health care to provide every citizen with coverage, promised to protect Social Security and the environment, said the Iraq War \\"has not been worth the cost of American service personnel or the dollars we have spent\\", and said America needed \\"fair trade\\" in the proposed CAFTA agreement. She also defended contraception, legal abortion and reproductive rights. 2006 election for Congress In 2006, Wulsin sought the Democratic nomination again. With Paul Hackett having announced he would not run again, she faced health care administrator James John Parker and civil engineer Jeff Sinnard, who both ran in 2005, and newcomers Gabrielle Downey, a high school teacher, and Thor Jacobs, a building contractor. Wulsin won the May 2 primary by nearly 15 percentage points and received the Democratic nomination for the 2nd District. Facing the incumbent Rep. Jean Schmidt (R) in the November 2006 general election, she was defeated by a narrow margin: 2,517 votes out of almost 240,000 votes cast.2006 Election results , Ohio State. This is the closest in 42 years that a Democrat has come to winning a full term in the historically Republican 2nd District. The last Democrat to win this district for a full term was future Governor Jack Gilligan, who held it for one term after being swept into office by the Democratic landslide of 1964. Wulsin carried Pike and Scioto counties by wide margins and narrowly carried Brown County. She defeated Schmidt in the 2nd's share of Hamilton County, by far the largest portion of the district. Schmidt had won Hamilton County during her special election victory against Hackett. Schmidt carried her home Clermont County by over 8,000 votes, enabling her to keep the seat. 2008 election for Congress In the 2008 election cycle, Wulsin ran as the Democratic candidate for the Second District of Ohio after winning the primary. She defeated Cincinnati attorney Steve Black by 28 points in the March 4 primary. In the general election, Wulsin faced two opponents, Republican incumbent Jean Schmidt and independent candidate David Krikorian. Polls showed the race to be close between Wulsin and Schmidt, with Krikorian attracting a significant amount of support for an independent candidate. The three candidates engaged in three debates. The first took place at the Anderson Community Center on October 6, 2008, the second was aired on WCET on October 22, and the third was aired on Channel 12‚Äôs Newsmakers program on October 26. All three debates focused mainly on the economy, the financial crisis, and local issues. On November 4, the incumbent Representative Schmidt defeated Wulsin in the general election. 2005 Malariotherapy controversy During the 2006 and 2008 electoral campaigns, Wulsin's participation in a 2004 study for Cincinnati's Heimlich Institute was criticized by her opponents. Henry Heimlich had directed a three-year study in China, ending in 1996, that evaluated the use of malaria infection in fighting AIDS. In 2008 ABC News, in discussing Wulsin, noted that this theory had been debunked. In 2004, Wulsin was hired as an epidemiologist by the Heimlich Institute to conduct a four- month literature review on \\"malariotherapy\\", the AIDS treatment based on infecting HIV+ patients with malaria. Wulsin wrote a draft report for the Heimlich Institute summarizing her findings, entitled \\"Immunotherapy and Beyond\\". It has not been published.Dan Monk and Andrea Tortora, \\"Family ties unraveling: Henry Heimlich faces firing squad of criticism from surprising source\\", Cincinnati Business Courier, 24 January 2005, accessed 2 June 2013 She concluded that \\"the preponderance of evidence indicates that neither malaria or immunotherapy will cure HIV/AIDS.\\" and recommended that the Institute wait for results of other studies. The day after Wulsin submitted the report, Heimlich fired her. Wulsin said: \\"I challenged the science and ethics of immunotherapy, malaria therapy. I didn't realize how much it was a challenge to his ethics and his science until he fired me.\\" The following year, Dr. Robert S. Baratz of the National Council Against Health Fraud filed a complaint with the State Medical Board of Ohio of Wulsin's work for the Heimlich Institute. After its review, the State Medical Board issued a letter on April 28, 2008, saying that \\"no further action was required by the board and the complaint has been closed.\\" That year the Republican candidate, Jean Schmidt, in a tight race with Wulsin, tried to capitalize on the controversy in a fundraising letter that incorrectly suggested that the doctor had been directly involved in experiments using malariotherapy. This was a distortion of her literature review study.  Personal life  She married Lawson Wulsin, now a psychiatrist on the faculty of the University of Cincinnati. They have four sons. She is a resident of Indian Hill, an affluent suburb of Cincinnati.

He had connections with the Gurney family. Early life Buxton was born at Castle Hedingham, Essex. His father, also named Thomas Fowell Buxton, died young, leaving three sons and two daughters. His mother's maiden name was Anna Hanbury, a Quaker. Through her influence Buxton became associated with the Gurney family of Earlham Hall, Norwich. He was especially close to Joseph John Gurney, his sister the prison reformer Elizabeth Fry, and their sister Hannah, whom he married in May 1807. He lived at Northrepps Hall in Norfolk. He completed his education at Trinity College Dublin.The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol. III, London (1847) Charles Knight, p. 980. In 1808, Buxton's Hanbury family connections led to an appointment to work at the brewery of Truman, Hanbury & Company, in Brick Lane, Spitalfields, London. In 1811 he was made a partner in the business, renamed Truman, Hanbury, Buxton & Co. He later became sole owner. Although he was a member of the Church of England, Buxton attended meetings of the Friends (Quakers) with some of the Gurneys. In this way he became involved in the social reform movement, in which Friends were prominent. He helped raise money for the weavers of London, who were being forced into poverty by the factory system. He provided financial support for Elizabeth Fry's prison reform work and joined her Association for the Improvement of the Female Prisoners in Newgate. Buxton was elected to Parliament for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis in 1818. As an MP he worked for changes in prison conditions and criminal law and for the abolition of slavery, in which he was helped by his sister-in-law Louisa Gurney Hoare. He also opposed capital punishment and pushed for its abolition. Although he never accomplished this last goal, he worked to restrict the crimes for which capital punishment was sentenced. The number was eventually reduced from over 200 to eight. Among other things, he argued for the suppression of lotteries and abolition of the practice of burning widows in India. Thomas and Hannah Buxton had eight children. Four of them died of whooping cough over a five- week period around April 1820. Another one died of consumption some time later. Hannah would send boxes of toys to the missionary Anna Hinderer in Nigeria in 1855. By 1866 her grandchildren were parcelling them up. Abolitionism The slave trade had been abolished in 1807, but Buxton began to work for the abolition of the institution of slavery. In 1823 he helped found the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society (later known as the Anti- Slavery Society). In the House of Commons in May 1823, Buxton introduced a resolution condemning the state of slavery as \\"repugnant to the principles of the British constitution and of the Christian religion\\", and called for its gradual abolition \\"throughout the British colonies\\". He also pressured the government to send dispatches to the colonies to improve the treatment of slaves. Buxton took over as leader of the abolition movement in the British House of Commons after William Wilberforce retired in 1825. He presented a petition to the House of Commons bearing 187,000 signatures. This had been partly organised by Priscilla Buxton in 1833, and the first two signatures were Amelia Opie's and hers. He had achieved his goal when slavery was officially abolished in the British Empire, except in India and Ceylon. Buxton held his seat in Parliament until 1837. In 1839 Buxton urged the British government to make treaties with African leaders to abolish the slave trade. The government in turn backed the Niger expedition of 1841 (not including Buxton) put together by missionary organizations, which was also going to work on trade. More than 150 people were part of the expedition, which reached the Niger Delta and began negotiations. The British suffered such high mortality from fevers, with more than 25 per cent of the group dying rapidly, that they cut short the mission in 1841. The Buxton vault in Overstrand Church David Livingstone was strongly influenced by Buxton's arguments that the African slave trade might be destroyed through the influence of \\"legitimate trade\\" (in goods) and the spread of Christianity. He became a missionary in Africa and fought the slave trade all his life. On 30 July 1840 Buxton was created a baronet. His health failed gradually ‚Äì according to some, due to disappointment over the failed mission to Africa. He died five years later at his home, North-Repps Hall, near Aylsham, and was buried at Overstrand. Founding RSPCA chairman On 16 June 1824 a meeting was held at Old Slaughter's Coffee House, St Martin's Lane, London, that created the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

Legacy and honours *A monument to Fowell Buxton stands in Westminster Abbey. *A memorial to the emancipation of slaves, dedicated to Buxton, was installed in Victoria Tower Gardens. Commissioned by his son Charles Buxton MP, the Buxton Memorial Fountain was designed by Samuel Sanders Teulon and installed in Parliament Square. In 1940 it was removed during the German bombings of London in World War II. It was installed at its present location in 1957. *A plaque is dedicated to him in Norwich Cathedral and another at the Norwich Friends Meeting House. *A bust of him is in St. George's Cathedral, Freetown, Sierra Leone. *Fowell Close in Norwich is named after him. *A representation of Buxton was printed on the English five-pound note used between 2002 and 2017. He is the figure wearing glasses in the group to the left of Elizabeth Fry. *In Weymouth, Dorset, which he served for 19 years as MP, the main route to the Isle of Portland is named Buxton Road. It runs past Belfield House, his former home in Wyke Regis. A permanent memorial to him was unveiled in 2017 on Bincleaves Green in Weymouth.Work is underway for a monument to honour former MP, Thomas Fowell Buxton Descendants Buxton had a number of notable descendants (five sons and six daughters): Sir Edward North Buxton, 2nd Baronet (1812‚Äì1858) married Catherine Gurney (1814‚Äì1911, seven sons, five daughters). ::Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, 3rd Baronet (1837‚Äì1915) married Lady Victoria Noel (1840‚Äì1916). ::::Sir Thomas Fowell Victor Buxton, 4th Baronet (1865‚Äì1919) ::::Noel Edward Noel-Buxton, 1st Baron Noel-Buxton (1869‚Äì1948) ::::Charles Roden Buxton (1875‚Äì1942) ::::Harold Jocelyn Buxton (1880‚Äì1976) ::::Leland William Wilberforce Buxton (1884‚Äì1967) ::Samuel Gurney Buxton (1838 ‚Äì February 1909), of Catton.

It is named after Daniel Alcides Carri√≥n. Signs and symptoms The clinical symptoms of bartonellosis are pleomorphic and some patients from endemic areas may be asymptomatic. The two classical clinical presentations are the acute phase and the chronic phase, corresponding to the two different host cell types invaded by the bacterium (red blood cells and endothelial cells). An individual can be affected by either or both phases. =Acute phase= It is also called the hematic phase. The most common findings are fever (usually sustained, but with temperature no greater than 102 ¬∞F (39 ¬∞C)), pale appearance, malaise, painless liver enlargement, jaundice, enlarged lymph nodes, and enlarged spleen. This phase is characterized by severe hemolytic anemia and transient immunosuppression. The case fatality ratios of untreated patients exceeded 40% but reach around 90% when opportunistic infection with Salmonella spp. occurs. In a recent study, the attack rate was 13.8% (123 cases) and the case-fatality rate was 0.7%. Other symptoms include a headache, muscle aches, and general abdominal pain. Some studies have suggested a link between Carrion's disease and heart murmurs due to the disease's impact on the circulatory system. In children, symptoms of anorexia, nausea, and vomiting have been investigated as possible symptoms of the disease. Most of the mortality of Carrion's disease occurs during the acute phase. Studies vary in their estimates of mortality. In one study, mortality has been estimated as low as just 1% in studies of hospitalized patients, to as high as 88% in untreated, unhospitalized patients. In developed countries, where the disease rarely occurs, it is recommended to seek the advice of a specialist in infectious disease when diagnosed. Mortality is often thought to be due to subsequent infections due to the weakened immune symptoms and opportunistic pathogen invasion, or consequences of malnutrition due to weight loss in children. In a study focusing on pediatric and gestational effects of the disease, mortality rates for pregnant women with the acute phase were estimated at 40% and rates of spontaneous abortion in another 40%. =Chronic phase= It is also called the eruptive phase or tissue phase, in which the patients develop a cutaneous rash produced by a proliferation of endothelial cells and is known as \\"Peruvian warts\\" or \\"verruga peruana\\". Depending on the size and characteristics of the lesions, there are three types: miliary (1‚Äì4 mm), nodular or subdermic, and mular (>5mm). Miliary lesions are the most common. The lesions often ulcerate and bleed. The most common findings are bleeding of verrugas, fever, malaise, arthralgias (joint pain), anorexia, myalgias, pallor, lymphadenopathy, and liver and spleen enlargement. On microscopic examination, the chronic phase and its rash are produced by angioblastic hyperplasia, or the increased rates and volume of cell growth in the tissues that form blood vessels. This results in a loss of contact between cells and a loss of normal functioning. The chronic phase is the more common phase. Mortality during the chronic phase is very low. Cause Carrion's disease is caused by Bartonella bacilliformis. Recent investigations show that Candidatus Bartonella ancashi may cause verruga peruana, although it may not meet all of Koch's postulates. There has been no experimental reproduction of the Peruvian wart in animals and there is little research on the disease's natural spread or impact in native animals. Diagnosis thin blood film Diagnosis during the acute phase can be made by obtaining a peripheral blood smear with Giemsa stain, Columbia blood agar cultures, immunoblot, indirect immunofluorescence, and PCR. Diagnosis during the chronic phase can be made using a Warthin-Starry stain of wart biopsy, PCR, and immunoblot. Treatment Because Carrion's disease is often comorbid with Salmonella infections, chloramphenicol has historically been the treatment of choice. Fluoroquinolones (such as ciprofloxacin) or chloramphenicol in adults and chloramphenicol plus beta-lactams in children are the antibiotic regimens of choice during the acute phase of Carrion's disease. Chloramphenicol-resistant B. bacilliformis has been observed. During the eruptive phase, in which chloramphenicol is not useful, azithromycin, erythromycin, and ciprofloxacin have been used successfully for treatment. Rifampin or macrolides are also used to treat both adults and children. Because of the high rates of comorbid infections and conditions, multiple treatments are often required. These have included the use of corticosteroids for respiratory distress, red blood cell transfusions for anemia, pericardiectomies for pericardial tamponades, and other standard treatments.

They first appeared in Thor vol. 1 #372 (October 1986). Created by Walt Simonson and Sal Buscema, the TVA originally paid homage to long-time Marvel writer/editor, and continuity expert, Mark Gruenwald: the TVA staff were all clones of Gruenwald. Fictional background The TVA claims responsibility for monitoring the multiverse and can prune timelines if they're deemed too dangerous to exist. They also take action to prevent other beings from altering the past or future. They were first seen, allowing Justice Peace, a lawman from the future, to travel to the 20th century in order to stop the killer Zaniac. Peace is able to succeed in his mission thanks to the assistance of Thor.Thor #372 (October 1986). Despite their claims, the TVA's influence over time is not absolute. The scope of their influence is bordered by Alioth in the distant past as well as Kang the Conqueror, the Delubric Consortium, and Revelation at different eras throughout the timescape.Avengers: The Terminatrix Objective #3 (Nov. 1993). There have also been numerous incidents of time travel or reality tampering where the TVA has failed to interfere. At the End of Time, the last Director of the TVA creates the Time Keepers, the last three beings who exist in the remaining timeline in the universe; however this process also ends up creating the Time Twisters, a trio of beings who imperiled all realities until stopped by Thor and other members of the Avengers. The TVA are next seen utilizing the law-firm She-Hulk works for on several instances. Jurors for cases are plucked from time soon before they actually die, this is so the effects on the time- stream are minimal. This also establishes the tendencies for time-travelers to go through genetic scrambling, also to minimize the effect on the time-stream. Notably, the scrambling tends to cause similar looks among differing males who undergo the process. A defendant who is found guilty in one of these trials is executed with a weapon called the Retroactive Cannon, or Ret Can, which erases the victim, deleting their existence from the universe by undoing their birth and entire history. She-Hulk herself was handed this harsh sentence, but it was overturned as a reward when she helped defeat the villain Clockwise. (This weapon is an obvious reference to a retroactive continuity, or \\"retcon\\", a practice used by storytellers to add previously unknown material to an event in a previous story.)She-Hulk vol. 2, #1-4 (Dec. 2005‚ÄìMar. 2006). Employees Lower-ranked TVA employees, called chronomonitors, are literally faceless. They are created artificially, using \\"quantum technology\\" - the moment a new reality appears, a new faceless agent is created to monitor it, along with the necessary equipment (a personal computer-like device, plus a desk and a chair) to do so. Cloned managers resemble Mark Gruenwald ‚Äî and, later, Tom DeFalco ‚Äî both longtime Marvel Comics writers. The most frequent recurring manager is Mobius M. Mobius, a Gruenwald clone.Fantastic Four Annual #24 (1991). On occasion, the TVA hires mercenaries for use in the more dangerous missions, such as Justice Peace and Death's Head. These mercenaries often lose limbs, which the TVA replaces with clunky robotic parts. Another example of their seemingly anachronistic technology is a time machine shaped like an old locomotive.

It was the last military biplane procured by the United States Navy. Delivered in 1937, it became obsolete even before World War II and was kept well away from combat with Axis fighters.Wheeler 1992, p. 27. Development There was controversy in the United States Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) in the early 1930s regarding two-seat fighter planes, monoplanes and the retractable undercarriageFlanagan, Major William A. The Fighter Force, How many seats, Air University Review, May‚ÄìJune 1981. In 1931, the Navy issued Design Specification No. 113, which detailed a requirement for a high-performance fighter with fixed undercarriage to be powered by the Wright R-1510Gunston p 199 or Pratt & Whitney's R-1535 radial engine.Gunston p 130 Seven companies submitted proposals and two companies, the Douglas Aircraft with their XFD-1Francillon pp 138‚Äì140 and the Chance Vought with their XF3U-1Moran p 59 were given contracts for one prototype each. Both of these aircraft were two- seat biplanes. The Navy then asked Curtiss to supply a prototype of a two-seat monoplane which was technically more advanced. On 30 June 1932, BuAer signed a contract with Curtiss to design a two-seat monoplane with a parasol wing a retractable undercarriage and powered by a 625 hp (466 kW) Wright R-1510-92 fourteen cylinder, two row, air-cooled radial engine driving a two-blade propeller. This fighter was designated XF12C-1. Design The SBC was an all- metal, two-seat scout-bomber biplane with ‚ÄúI‚Äù-type interplane struts. It was the last combat biplane the Navy purchased and the last combat biplane manufactured in the United States. The two crewmen, pilot and radio operator/gunner, were housed in tandem cockpits enclosed by a sliding canopy and the turtledeck behind the rear cockpit could be folded down to allow the gunner to use his machine gun. The wings, rudder, elevators and flaps were fabric covered. The main landing gear retracted into wheel wells in the fuselage just forward of the lower wing and the tail wheel retracted into the fuselage.Taylor p 111 =XF12C-1 (Curtiss Model 73)= The XF12C-1 This aircraft was initially powered by a Wright R-1510-92 engine but this was unsuitable so the aircraft was re-engined with a 775 hp (578 kW) Wright R-1670 fourteen cylinder, two row, air-cooled radial engine, which was also unsatisfactory. Both of these engines were prototypes and neither went into production. Finally, the 700 hp (522 kW) Wright R-1820-80 nine cylinder, single row, air-cooled radial engine was installed and the resulting aircraft, designated XF12C-1 flew in 1933. Designed for aircraft carrier usage, the parasol wing folded back, a new feature for the Navy, for storage and the aircraft had an exposed tail hook for carrier landings. The first flight was in July 1933 but in September 1934, the parasol wing failed in the dive bomber tests.Swanborough p 162 =XS4C-1 (Curtiss Model 73)= After testing the XF12C-1 was rejected as a fighter, and on 7 December 1933 this aircraft was redesignated in the scout category as the XS4C-1 and re-engined with a 700 hp (522 kW) Wright R-1820-80 radial engineJane pp88d-92d driving a two-blade propeller. In its role as a scouting aircraft, bombing equipment for a 500-pound (227-kilogram) bomb had to be designed and provided. =XSBC-1 (Curtiss Model 73)= In January 1934 the designation scout bomber (SB) was introduced and the aircraft was finally redesignated XSBC-1. In early 1934 flight tests, especially dive-bombing, began. On 14 June 1934 this aircraft crashed- attributed to wing failure- in Lancaster, New York, about 6 mi (9.66 km) from the Curtiss plant, during one of the tests and it was destroyed. =XSBC-2 (Curtiss Model 77)= Curtiss-Wright made a proposal to the Navy to build one replacement aircraft that would be a staggered wing biplane, would not have folding wings but would have leading edge slots and the lower wing would have full span flaps. It was an all-metal aircraft with fabric covered control surfaces. It was powered by a 700 hp (522 kW) Wright XR-1510-12 fourteen-cylinder, twin-row, air-cooled engine driving a constant speed Curtiss Electric three-blade propeller, an enlarged canopy, enlarged vertical fin and rudder and retractable tail hook. The XSBC-2 had to engage in competitive tests against the Great Lakes Aircraft's XB2G-1Johnson pp 37‚Äì39 and the Grumman Aircraft Engineering's XSBF-1.Johnson pp 39‚Äì41 The XSBC-2 won and a contract for this aircraft was signed in April 1935 and it made its first flight on 9 December 1935. =XSBC-3 (Curtiss Model 77)= The Wright XR-1510-12 engine in the XSBC-2 proved to be mechanically unreliable. In March 1936, this aircraft was re-engined with a 700 hp (522 kW) Pratt & Whitney R-1535-82 fourteen-cylinder, twin-row, air-cooled engine driving a three-blade propeller and redesignated XSBC-3. With this new configuration, the Navy placed a production order. =SBC-3 (Curtiss Model 77A)= The VS-3 CO's SBC-3, assigned to , circa 1939. The major difference between the prototype XSBC-3 and the production aircraft was the engine. A contract for 83 aircraft was signed in August 1936 and deliveries began on 17 July 1937. The production aircraft were powered by an 825 hp (615 kW) Pratt & Whitney R-1535-94 fourteen-cylinder, twin-row, air-cooled engine driving a three-blade propeller. Armament consisted of two 0.30-caliber (7.62 mm) machine guns, one fixed gun in the right side of the fuselage forward of the pilot and a flexible gun in the rear cockpit. The aircraft had a bomb displacement swing located on the centerline of the fuselage for a 500-lb (227-kg) bomb or a 45-U.S.-gallon (170-liter) fuel tank. =XSBC-4 (Curtiss Model 77B)= The 76th SBC-3 was re-engined with a 950-hp (708 kW) Wright R-1820-22 nine- cylinder, single-row, air-cooled radial engine driving a three-blade Hamilton Standard propeller and redesignated XSBC-4. The aircraft armament increased to one 0.50-caliber (12.7-mm) fixed machine gun in the right side of the fuselage forward of the pilot and a 0.30-caliber (7.62-mm) flexible machine gun in the rear cockpit. With the more powerful engine, this aircraft could carry a 1,000-lb (454-kg) bomb on the bomb displacement swing located on the centerline of the fuselage. A second SBC-3 was redesignated XSBC-4 and used for test work. =SBC-4 (Curtiss Model 77B)= The contract for 124 production aircraft of the XSBC-4 was signed on 5 January 1938 and deliveries began in March 1939 to April 1941. Operational historyU.S. Navy= In August 1936, the Navy signed a contract for 83 SBC-3s (Curtiss Model 77A). Delivery of the SBC-3s to the fleet began on 17 July 1937 when the first aircraft were issued to Scouting Squadron Five (VS-5) serving in USS Yorktown (CV-5) however, Yorktown was not commissioned until 30 September 1937 and the ship then began sea trials. On 10 December 1937, VS-5 went aboard Yorktown and served aboard her until replaced by Douglas SBD-3s Dauntlesses in 1940. By June 1938, three of the five scouting squadrons serving in aircraft carriers were equipped with SBC-3s while the other two were equipped with Vought SBU-1s. The three ships with SBC-3s were: * USS Enterprise (CV-6): Fighting Squadron Six (VF-6) had an SBC-3 and VS-6 had 20 Helldivers. * USS Saratoga (CV-3): Bombing Squadron Three (VB-3) had one SBC-3, VF-3 had an SBC-3 and VS-3 had 21 Helldivers. * USS Yorktown (CV-5): VS-5 had ten SBC-3s.Larkins, U.S. Navy p 229 One of the SBC-3s was kept at the factory and redesignated XSBC-4 (Curtiss Model 77B). This aircraft was re-engined with the 750 hp (559 kW) Wright R-1820-22 nine cylinder, single row, air-cooled engine The initial contract for 58 SBC-4s was signed on 5 January 1938. This was followed by two additional contracts, one for 31 Helldivers on 27 July 1938 and the third contract for 35 aircraft on 13 August 1938. Total aircraft contracted for was 124. The aircraft were powered by the 850 hp (634 kW) Wright R-1820-24 engine. The first squadron to receive the SBC-4s was VS-2 in USS Lexington (CV-2) replacing the Vought SBU-1s. By 26 June 1939, VS-2 was fully equipped with 21 aircraft. This was the only aircraft carrier that flew the SBC-4 and they were replaced by Douglas SBD-2 and -3 Dauntlesses in 1941. Because of the expanding aviation training program, the majority of SBC-4s, and other training aircraft, were assigned to Naval Reserve Air Bases (NRABs) to allow reserve Navy and Marine airmen assigned to reserve scouting squadrons (VS and VMS) and maintain their proficiency. By June 1940, 11 NRABs had SBC-4s as follows: * NRAB Anacostia, District of Columbia: 3 SBC-4s assigned to VS-6R and VMS-3R, * NRAB Boston, Massachusetts: 3 SBC-4s assigned to VS-1R, VS-2R and VMS-1R, * NRAB Detroit, Michigan: 3 SBC-4s assigned to VS-8R and VMS-5R, * NRAB Glenview, Illinois: .4 SBC-4s assigned to VS-9R, * NRAB Kansas City, Kansas: 4 SBC-4s assigned to VS-12R and VMS-10R, * NRAB Long Beach, California: 4 SBC-4s assigned to VS-13R, VS-14R and VMS-7R, * NRAB Minneapolis, Minnesota: 3 SBC-4s assigned to VS-10R and VMS-6R, * NRAB New York, New York: 4 SBC-4s assigned to VS-3R, VS-4R and VMS-2R, * NRAB Oakland, California: 4 SBC-4s assigned to VS-15R and VMS-8R, * NRAB Seattle, Washington: 4 SBC-4s assigned to VS-16R and VMS-9R, * NRAB St. Louis, Missouri: 3 SBC-4s assigned to VS-11RLarkins, U.S. Navy p 275. As time advanced, the Navy acquired newer, more modern aircraft and the SBC-3s were replaced by the Douglas SBD Dauntless. By 7 December 1941, the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps had 69 SBC-3s and 118 SBC-4s in the inventory based at NASs, NRABs and the Naval Aircraft Factory (NAF) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The largest number were at NAS Miami, Florida where they were used for intermediate and dive bombing training. In December 1941, the SBCs were based at: * NAF, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: 1 XSBC-1 and 1 SBC-3, * NAS Corpus Christi, Texas: 34 SBC-4s, * NAS Miami, Florida: 55 SBC-3s, * NAS Norfolk, Virginia: 4 SBC-3s and 10 SBC-4s, * NAS San Diego, California: 9 SBC-3s and 11 SBC-4s, * Naval Mission, Lima, Peru: 1 SBC-4, * USS Hornet (CV-8) **Bombing Squadron Eight (VB-8): 19 SBC-4s, **Scouting Squadron Eight (VS-8): 20 SBC-4sLarkins U.S. Navy pp 309‚Äì310 Hornet was undergoing sea trials in the Atlantic on 7 December and the two squadrons kept their SBC-4s until the ship sailed to San Diego, California in March 1942. At that time, the two squadrons had transitioned to the SBD-3 Dauntless and she became the last ship to operate the SBC aboard aircraft carriers. An additional 50 SBC-4s, originally ordered by the French, were built between February and May 1941 to replace those sent overseas. The major change was replacing the 135-U.S.-gallon (511-liter) fuselage fuel tank with a 126-U.S. gallon (477-liter) self-sealing fuel tank. The last SBC-4 was delivered in May 1941. By 1944, the SBC-3s were no longer needed and they were stricken from the inventory. The longest to survive were 12 aircraft at NAS Jacksonville, Florida which were stricken on 31 October 1944. =U.S. Marine Corps= Samoa until June 1943. The U.S. Marines received one SBC-3 in 1938 and which was assigned to Marine Fighter Squadron Two (VMF-2, redesignated VMF-211 on 1 July 1941) at NAS San Diego, California.Larkins, U.S. Marines p 70 and 75. It was sent to the Battle Fleet Pool in June 1939. In January 1940, the Marine Corps had four SBC-4s.Larkins, U.S. Marines pp 86 and 87. Two were based at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS), Quantico, Virginia; one was assigned to VMF-1 (redesignated VMF-111 on 1 July 1941) and the second, the XSBC-4, was assigned to Marine Utility Squadron One (VMJ-1 redesignated VMJ-152 on 7 July 1941). The other two aircraft were based at NAS, San Diego, California; one SBC-4 was assigned to VMF-2 and the second to VMJ-2 (redesignated VMJ-252 on 1 July 1941). On 7 December 1941, the Marine Corps had 23 SBC-4s in their inventory. Twelve of them were assigned to a Marine observation squadron (VMO): * MCAS Quantico, Virginia: 1 XSBC-4 and 5 SBC-4s, * NAS San Diego, California: 5 SBC-4s, and * VMO-151, MCAS Quantico, Virginia: 12 SBC-4sSherrod p 33. VMO-151 transferred to Tafuna (now Pago Pago International Airport), Tutuila Island, American Samoa, on 9 May 1942 with their SBC-4s. The squadron was redesignated Marine Scout Bombing Squadron One Hundred Fifty One (VMSB-151) on 15 September 1942. A second observation squadron, VMO-155, was commissioned in American Samoa on 1 October 1942 by taking half of VMSB-151's personnel and equipment. VMO-155 received ten SBC-4s and a Grumman J2F-5 Goose however, six officers and 15 enlisted men of the squadron returned to the U.S. on 8 December 1942 as a nucleus to form a new VMO-155 and the remaining personnel were transferred to Guadalcanal Island in the Solomon Islands.Sherrod, pp 48 and 216‚Äì217. In December 1942, the VMSB-151 SBC-4s were being replaced by Douglas SBD Dauntlesses and by June 1943, the squadron had been fully equipped with SBD-4s and they moved to Uvea Island in the Wallis Group leaving their SBC-4s behind. The last SBC reported in Marine squadron service was an SBC-4 at American Samoa in service with VMSB-151 on 1 June 1943.Naval Historical Center p 493. =French Navy= Three French SBC-4s on the ramp. When World War II began in 1939, Britain and France came to the U.S. shopping for military aircraft. In early 1940, the French government placed an order with Curtiss-Wright for 90 SBC-4s. To aid the French, on 6 June 1940 the Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration ordered the U.S. Navy to fly 50 SBC-4s of the Naval Reserve, currently in use by the Navy, to the Curtiss-Wright factory in Buffalo, New York where the 50 planes would be refurbished to French standards. This included removing all U.S. markings on instruments and equipment, replacing the American machine guns with French 7.7-millimeter (0.303-caliber) Darne machine guns and repainting the aircraft in French camouflage colors. Once converted, the aircraft were to be delivered to RCAF Station Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada where they would be loaded onto the French aircraft carrier B√©arn. Several neutrality acts had been passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law and the Neutrality Act of 1939 allowed for arms trade with belligerent nations (Great Britain and France) on a \\"cash-and-carry\\" basis. \\"Cash and carry\\" allowed the sale of materiel to belligerents, as long as the recipients arranged for the transport using their own ships or planes and paid immediately in cash. Because of this provision, the U.S. could not fly military aircraft into Canada; they had to land in the U.S. and be towed across the Canada‚ÄìUS border. The 50 aircraft were to fly from Buffalo, New York to Houlton Airport, Maine via Burlington, Vermont and Augusta, Maine. Houlton Airport, Maine, was on the Canada‚ÄìUS border and local farmers used their tractors to tow the planes into New Brunswick, Canada, where the Canadians closed the Woodstock highway so that aircraft could use it as a runway and fly to RCAF Station Dartmouth.Doll pp 34 The 50 SBC-4s were to fly to RCAF Station Dartmouth in groups of three. One of the first groups that left encountered rain and fog while flying between Buffalo and Albany, New York and one of the aircraft crashed. The remaining 49 aircraft were successfully flown to Nova Scotia to be loaded onto B√©arn and the light cruiser . Because of space limitations, only 44 of the SBC-4s could be carried on FR B√©arn; because she also had 25 Stinson Model HW-75s (also known as Stinson 105s), 17 Curtiss H75-A1s (U.S. Army Air Corps P-36 and six Brewster F2A-2 Buffalos for the Belgian Air Force. The Jeanne d'Arc carried 14 crated, unassembled aircraft, eight Stinson Model HW-75s and six Curtiss H75-A1s. The two ships sailed from Halifax on 16 June 1940 bound for Brest, France. Two days later, Brest fell into German hands and both ships were ordered to Fort- de-France, Martinique, French West Indies, an island in the Lesser Antilles in the eastern Caribbean Sea. They arrived on 27 June, five days after France surrendered to the Germans. The SBC-4s were unloaded and rolled to a field at the Pointe des Sables region and stored in the open. Under tropical climatic conditions, the aircraft stored in the open were slowly rotting and were no longer airworthy and were eventually scrapped. =Royal Air Force= A Cleveland I in flight Five of the French aircraft could not fit on FR B√©arn and were left at RCAF Station Dartmouth. In August 1940, the Royal Air Force acquired them, designated them \\"Cleveland Mk. Is\\" and shipped them to England in the aircraft carrier HMS Furious.Doll p 36, They were assembled at RAF Burtonwood, Lancashire, and delivered to RAF Little Rissington, Gloucestershire and later used by No. 24 (Communications) Squadron at RAF Hendon, Middlesex.Thetford p 579 These aircraft were never used operationally and became ground trainers.Halley pp 64‚Äì65 Variants ;XF12C-1 :Prototype parasol-wing fighter powered by a R-1510-92 radial; one built, later converted into biplane as the XS4C-1. ;XS4C-1 :Prototype was redesignated in the \\"scout\\" category before being redesignated again as the XSBC-1. ;XSBC-1 :Prototype redesignated from XS4C-1, a biplane with an R-1820-80. ;XSBC-2 :Redesigned biplane based on XSBC-1 and powered by a XR-1510-12; one built. ;XSBC-3 :XSBC-2 re-engined with a R-1535-82. ;SBC-3 :Production variant with an R-1534-94; 83 built. ;XSBC-4 :SBC-3 re-engined with a R-1820-22; one conversion. ;SBC-4 :Production variant with a 950 hp R-1820-34; 174 built, including 50 transferred to the French Navy. ;Cleveland I :British designation for five SBC-4s.

Reaching a length of , this small brown to gray shark has a slender body with a tall, sickle-shaped first dorsal fin. Its name comes from its exceptionally large \\"hammer\\", or cephalofoil, which can be as wide as half of the shark's total length. The function of this structure is unclear, but may relate to the shark's senses. The wide spacing of its eyes grants superb binocular vision, while the extremely long nostrils on the leading margin of the cephalofoil may allow for better detection and tracking of odor trails in the water. The cephalofoil also provides a large surface area for its ampullae of Lorenzini and lateral line, with potential benefits for electroreception and mechanoreception, respectively. Inhabiting the shallow coastal waters of the central and western Indo-Pacific, the winghead shark feeds on small bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. It gives birth to live young, with the developing embryos receiving nourishment through a placental connection. Females produce annual litters of 6 to 25 pups; depending on region, birth may occur from February to June after a gestation period of 8‚Äì11 months. This harmless species is widely fished for meat, fins, liver oil, and fishmeal. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as Endangered in 2016, as it is thought to have declined in some parts of its range due to overfishing. Taxonomy In 1785, German naturalist Marcus Elieser Bloch described a shark that he referred to Squalus zygaena (a synonym of Sphyrna zygaena, the smooth hammerhead). French zoologist Georges Cuvier, as a brief footnote to the account of S. zygaena in his 1817 Le R√®gne animal distribu√© d'apr√®s son organisation, pour servir de base √† l'histoire naturelle des animaux et d'introduction √† l'anatomie compar√©e, observed that Bloch's specimen (which he labeled \\"z. nob. Blochii\\") was not a smooth hammerhead, but rather a different species. Although Cuvier did not propose a proper binomial name, his colleague Achille Valenciennes interpreted it as such in 1822 when he described another specimen of the same species in detail, calling it Zygaena Blochii nobis and attributing the name to Cuvier. In 1862, Theodore Gill placed the winghead shark in its own genus Eusphyra, derived from the Greek eu (\\"good\\") and sphyra (\\"hammer\\"). However, subsequent authors did not accept Eusphyra and preferred to keep this species with the other hammerheads in the genus Sphyrna. Eusphyra was resurrected by Henry Bigelow and William Schroeder in 1948, and came into wider usage after additional taxonomic research was published by Leonard Compagno in 1979 and 1988. Nevertheless, some sources still refer to this species as Sphyrna blochii. Other common names for the winghead shark include arrowhead, arrow- headed hammerhead shark, and slender hammerhead. Phylogeny The traditional view of hammerhead shark evolution is that species with smaller cephalofoils evolved first from a requiem shark ancestor, and later gave rise to species with larger cephalofoils. Under this interpretation, the winghead shark is the most derived hammerhead, as it has the most extreme cephalofoil morphology. However, molecular phylogenetic research based on isozymes, mitochondrial DNA, and nuclear DNA have found the opposite pattern, with the winghead shark as the most basal member of the hammerhead family. This result supports the counterintuitive idea that the first hammerhead shark to evolve had a large cephalofoil. It also supports the separation of Eusphyra from Sphyrna by keeping the latter monophyletic (including all descendants of a single ancestor). The winghead shark lineage is estimated to have diverged from the rest of the hammerheads some 15‚Äì20 million years ago during the Miocene. Description Winghead shark, X-ray image True to its name, the winghead shark's cephalofoil consists of a pair of long, narrow, and gently swept-back blades. The width of the cephalofoil is equal to 40‚Äì50% of the shark's total length. The front of the cephalofoil has a slight indentation in the middle and a gentle bump on each side in front of the nostrils. Each nostril is roughly twice as long as the width of the mouth and extends along almost the entire leading margin of each blade. The circular eyes, located at the forward outer corners of the cephalofoil, are equipped with protective nictitating membranes. The relatively small, arched mouth contains 15‚Äì16 upper and 14 lower tooth rows on each side, and sometimes also a single row of tiny teeth at the upper and/or lower symphyses (jaw midpoints). The teeth are small and smooth-edged, with angled triangular cusps. Five pairs of gill slits are seen, with the fifth pair over the pectoral fin origins. The body is slim and streamlined, with a very tall, narrow, and falcate (sickle-shaped) first dorsal fin that originates over the bases of the rather small pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is much smaller and originates over the aft third of the anal fin base. The anal fin is about half again as long as the second dorsal fin. A lengthwise groove is on the caudal peduncle at the dorsal origin of the caudal fin. The upper caudal fin lobe is longer than the lower lobe, and bears a notch in the trailing margin near the tip. The skin is covered by overlapping dermal denticles, each with three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This species is brownish gray to gray above and off-white below, and lacks fin markings. It grows up to long. Distribution and habitat The winghead shark is found in the tropical central and western Indo-Pacific, from the Persian Gulf eastward across South and Southeast Asia to New Guinea and northern Queensland. Its range extends as far north as Taiwan and as far south as the Montebello Islands off Western Australia. This species inhabits shallow waters close to shore and has been known to enter estuaries. Biology and ecology Illustration of a winghead shark from Fauna of British India (1889), showing the remarkably wide cephalofoil: The function of this structure is yet unclear. Several nonexclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the extreme size of the winghead shark's cephalofoil. The placement of the eyes at the ends of the cephalofoil provides a binocular field of view of 48¬∞, the most of any hammerhead and four times that of a requiem shark; this species thus has excellent depth perception, which may aid in hunting. This species also has proportionately the longest nostrils among the hammerheads; longer nostrils contain more chemosensory receptors and can sample more water at a time, increasing the chances of detecting an odor molecule. A winghead shark long is theoretically capable of sampling over of water per second. Another potential olfactory benefit of the cephalofoil is increased separation between the midpoints of the left and right nostrils, which enhances the shark's ability to resolve the direction of a scent trail. Finally, the cephalofoil may increase the shark's ability to detect the electric fields and movements of its prey, by providing a larger surface area for its electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini and mechanoreceptive lateral line. The lateral blades seem too large to function in maneuvering, which has been suggested for other hammerheads. The winghead shark usually hunts close to the sea floor. Its diet consists mainly of small bony fishes, followed by crustaceans and cephalopods. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Callitetrarhynchus blochii, Heteronybelinia heteromorphi, Otobothrium carcharidis, O. mugilis, Phoreiobothrium puriensis, and Phyllobothrium blochii, the nematodes Hysterothylacium ganeshi, Pseudanisakis sp., Raphidascaroides blochii, and Terranova sp., the copepod Caligus furcisetifer, and the protozoan Eimeria zygaenae. =Life history= The winghead shark is viviparous like the rest of its family, with the developing young sustained to term by a placental connection to the mother. Adult females have a single functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteri. Compartments form inside the uteri during pregnancy, one for each embryo. In the waters around Mumbai, the mating season is in July and August during the monsoon. The males bite at the sides of the females as a prelude to copulation. Females can reproduce every year; the litter size ranges from 6 to 25 pups, and increases with the size of the female. The gestation period lasts 8‚Äì9 months off western India, and 10‚Äì11 months off northern Australia. Pregnant females have been reported to quarrel with each other. Initially, the embryo is nourished by yolk and develops in a similar fashion to other sharks. At a length of , the cephalofoil and the fins begin to form. When the embryo is long, the yolk supply begins to run low and folds appear on the yolk sac and uterine wall, which later interlock to form the placenta. At this stage, the embryo has most of the features of an adult, albeit rudimentary and colorless. The blades of the cephalofoil are folded back along the body, and long external gill filaments protrude from the gill slits. At a length of , the placenta has formed; the first teeth, dermal denticles, and skin pigmentation appear on the embryo, and the external gills are much reduced in size. By the time the embryo is long, it resembles a miniature version of the adult. Birthing takes place in May and June off Mumbai and Parangipettai, in March and April in the Gulf of Mannar, and in February and March off northern Australia. The pups emerge tail first, and their cephalofoils remain folded until after birth to facilitate passage through the cloaca. The newborns measure in length. Sexual maturity is reached at around long for males and long for females. The maximum lifespan is at least 21 years. Human interactions Harmless to humans, the winghead shark is caught throughout its range using gillnets, seines, stake nets, longlines, and hook-and-line. The meat is sold fresh, the fins are exported to Asia for shark fin soup, the liver is a source of vitamin oil, and the offal is processed into fishmeal. This species is taken in large numbers in some areas, such as in the Gulf of Thailand and off India and Indonesia, and anecdotal evidence indicates its population has suffered as a result. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the winghead shark as Endangered. This species is only infrequently caught in Australian waters, where it has been assessed regionally as Least Concern by the IUCN.

It is sometimes also referred to by foreign visitors as the Stuttgart Beer Festival, although it is actually more of an autumnal fair. The festival takes place at the Cannstatter Wasen from late September to early October, spanning a period over three weekends, ending the second Sunday in October. The extensive Wasen area is in the Stuttgart city district of Bad Cannstatt, near the river Neckar. A smaller variant of the Stuttgart festival, the Stuttgart Spring Festival, is also held each year in Wasen. Cannstatter Volksfest 2004  Background  Although the Volksfest is not strictly speaking a beer festival, it is considered by many to be the second largest beer celebration in the world after the Munich Oktoberfest. According to estimates about 4.2 million people visited the festival in 2006. The Volksfest begins one week later than the Oktoberfest.  History  Cannstatter Volksfest ‚Äì Wasen From an agricultural event to a famous festival''' Colorful flashing lights, the squealing and rattling of unknown machines, the smell of burned almonds, \\"G√∂ckele\\" (roasted chicken) and stockfish affects all your senses. Above the noise you can hear the bandmaster shouting out typical slogans like \\"die Kr√ºge hoch\\". No doubt, it‚Äôs \\"Volksfest\\" time in Bad Cannstatt. Annually around four million festival people gather at the biggest carnival festival in the world since 1818. In 1815 a gigantic eruption of the Vulcano Tambora in Indonesia led to a climatic catastrophe even in Europe. The incredible explosion hurled around 100 cubic km of rocks, ashes and dust up to 70 km high and darkened the sky. The blast equalled to 170,000 Hiroshima bombs. The shockwave could be felt 1,500 km away. 10,000 people died due to the eruption. Another 100,000 died because of the aftermath. The dust particles were distributed by the jet stream around the world and caused crop failure and famine in Europe. The winter of 1815/16 in Wurttemberg was the coldest since weather records were kept. Snow until May, no summer, alternating rain, whipping hail and thunderstorms continued into the growth season. This made bringing in a harvest in those years not possible. Throughout Germany, people were starving. The little existing flour was stretched with sawdust and the planted potatoes were dug up again. The need of the people was indescribable. When Wilhelm I. became King of Wurttemberg in 1816, the crisis of the people couldn‚Äôt be any worse. His brother in law, Czar Nikolaus of Russia, helped him to relieve the biggest misery with deliveries of grain. Then, in 1817, when the first harvest wagon was brought in, King Wilhelm and his Russian wife Katharina had the glorious idea to sponsor a harvest festival. This should take place annually on the King‚Äôs birthday on September, 28th in the area of the Cannstatter Wasen. The first festival in 1818 lasted one day and had more than 30,000 visitors. At the time the village of Cannstatt had a population of 3000. The Royal Couple donated cash prizes and honorary awards for outstanding agricultural accomplishment. The festival was designed to encourage the farmers. At the same time the popular monarch couple established an agricultural school in Hohenheim Palace. This set the foundation for today‚Äôs agricultural university. Due to this and other outstanding efforts the young monarch was titled \\"King of the farmers\\" and \\"Farmer amongst kings\\". In the German Agricultural Museum many of the developments, e.g. the double bladed plow, can still be seen. From agricultural festival to people festival The most important activities of the festival had been the award for breeding performance and the display of agricultural efficiency of the Wurttemberg farmers. The first food shops and carnies showed up with the first festival. The vendors attracted the people with sauerkraut, sausage and a lot of sweet fancy foods. A market completed the culinary choices. The carnies presented the strongest men, the fattest women and a lot of other curiosities. Through the years the festival grew larger and larger and transformed from the \\"Agricultural festival of Kannstadt\\" to the \\"Cannstatter Volksfest\\". During the 19th century the first festival lasted one day, by 1920 it was extended to five days and since 1972 the Volksfest has been celebrated for 16 days. In the beginning, there had only been a few Volksfest-carnies and beer counters. They were moved to the edge of the festival in favour of the royal lounge and the stand for the dignitaries. In 1860 the layout of the festival was three main streets and numerous side streets to handle the yearly increasing crowds. Today with around 350 companies, the Cannstatter Volksfest is the biggest carnival- festival worldwide. 4 to 5 million visitors are attracted to it. King Wilhelm assigned his royal builder Nikolaus Thouret to create an emblem next to the royal lounge in the middle of the festival areal. He created the fruit pillar as a symbol for thanksgiving which is still the emblem of the Volksfest. Placed on top of the 23 m high pillar sits a bowl with fruits. Only the highest mobile Ferris wheels of the world is towering above it. Today, the parade on the first festival Sunday is one of the most popular events of the Canstatter Volksfest. Nearly one hundred historical groups of town militia, Shepard-dancing-groups, festival wagons representing different crafts, groups dressed in traditional clothing and groups of musicians, create this colorful \\"Lindworm\\". There are still groups in traditional clothes and professional period groups, which have taken part in the festival since 1841. Based on the German article: \\"Fruchts√§ule, Festzelt, Ferkel\\" by Wulf Wagner.  Attractions  The festival offers a variety of attractions including numerous amusement rides, 73 stands ranging from shooting galleries to raffles, 95 food stands, and Chandler's market with 60 market stalls and a boxing show. = Fruit column = Symbolic of the Cannstatter Wasen is its \\"fruit column\\", a wooden pillar decorated with fruit, 26 metres high and weighing 3.5 tons. After World War I, with the beginning of the Weimar Republic, the fruit column was removed from the Cannstatter Wasen as it was considered a relic of the monarchy. Since 1935, the 100th anniversary, it has been back in its traditional place. Until recently the fruit column, the design of which has changed over the years, was dismantled after each Volksfest. Every few years it is redesigned. Since 1995 it has been left in place throughout the year and is thus also on display at the Stuttgart spring festival. In recent years only the tip has been dismantled leaving the lower portion in place housing information stands and the Cannstatter \\"city can\\". 2018 the Jubilee Column (Stuttgart‚Äôs Schlossplatz square), which was built to mark the 25th year of the government and the 60th birthday of King Wilhelm I of W√ºrttemberg, will, like the Fruit Column on the Wasen, will be festively decorated in a harvest festival theme. historical Volksfest = Amusement rides = Typical rides include: *60 meter Ferris wheel *47 metre Ferris wheel *Alpina roller coaster *Free fall Powertower, height 66 meters *Imperator (weight: 350t) *Wild water coaster *Wild mouse *Airwulf carousel *Transformer carousel *Turboforce carousel *Black Hole indoor roller coaster *Boosters revolution  Beer tents  Today, there are seven large beer tents on the Cannstatter Wasen for people to celebrate in. They either have their own name or carry the name of the brewery supplying the beer. *Schwaben Br√§u tent of Alexander Laub, remodeled in 2006 and now offering room for about 5,200 people *Stuttgarter Hofbr√§u tent of Hans-Peter Grandl, room for 5,000 *Dinkelacker tent of Dieter and Werner Klauss seating 4,500 visitors *F√ºrstenberg tent - from 2000 to 2004, Walter Weitmann organized a tent with about 5,000 seats for the F√ºrstenberg Brewery, which courted the other breweries' resentment by both its size and the origin (F√ºrstenberg is from Baden). In 2005, a smaller tent (room for 2,800) run by Peter Brandl replaced Weitmann's *Festzelt G√∂ckelesmaier - established in 1938 as Maiers Karle, renamed because of the roasted chicken (Swabian: G√∂ckele) served there, seats 2,500, also serves Stuttgarter Hofbr√§u beer *Festzelt Wasenwirt - room for 2200, Stuttgarter Hofbr√§u *Arcadia Erlebniszelt - established in 2005, 1,800 seats, an artificial waterfall and Dinkelacker brew Since 1982 the tents of Laub, Grandl and Klauss have been located by the fruit column. Each tent takes it in turn to host the opening ceremony. The price for a Ma√ü is usually the same in all tents. = French Village and Alpine Village = Alpine Village in 2008 For years the French village was an integral part of the Cannstatter Volksfest. By 2004, there were 33 food stands offering French meals and beverages along with traditional French music. The village was relaunched as an Alpine village in October 2008. = Parade = Traditionally a parade also takes place at the Wasen, usually on the first Sunday. In 1954 a record number of spectators attended the parade along the route from Stuttgart's central square to the Wasen site: 300,000. The Mohrenk√∂pfle is a pig in the parade. On the orders of King Wilhelm I, masked pigs (Maskenschweine?) were imported from Central China in 1820/21, in order to improve pig breeding in the kingdom of Baden-W√ºrttemberg. This crossbreeding with the \\"Chinese pigs\\" was particularly successful within the stocks of domestic pigs in the Hohenlohe region and the area around the town of Schw√§bisch Hall. = Fireworks = German Reunification is marked every year on 3 October by a firework display. = Agriculture exhibition = Every three years an agricultural exhibition (Landwirtschaftliches Hauptfest) is included in the main celebration. This was the original Cannstatter Wasen Volksfest. Unlike the Volksfest, there is an entrance fee to visit the exhibition. The last exhibition of this kind was in 2015.  Dates  The festival is opened by a ceremony in which the incumbent Lord Mayor of Stuttgart tries to tap the first barrel of beer with as few hits as possible. This takes place on a Friday in late September, so that the duration of the festival is actually 17 days. * 2009: 25 September ‚Äì 11 October * 2010: 24 September ‚Äì 10 October * 2011: 23 September ‚Äì 9 October * 2012: 28 September ‚Äì 14 October * 2013: 27 September ‚Äì 13 October * 2015: 25 September ‚Äì 11 October * 2016: 23 September - 9 October  Opening hours  The food stands and attractions are open between Monday and Friday from noon (beer tents from 11 am).

Accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA), it offered full- and part-time legal education in pursuit of the Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree. On December 9, 2015, William Mitchell merged with its longtime rival, the Hamline University School of Law,Maura Lerner, \\"Hamline, William Mitchell law schools to merge\\", Star Tribune (February 13, 2015). and became the Mitchell Hamline School of Law. History William Mitchell was the product of five predecessor schools, all in the Twin Cities, which ultimately merged in 1956. Although they varied in size and location, each one was originally established as a part-time, evening-program law school. This was meant to open the doors of the legal profession to men and women working full-time to support themselves and their families. =St. Paul College of Law= William Mitchell's first predecessor, the St. Paul College of Law, was founded in 1900 by five attorneys in Ramsey County. They intended the school to be an alternative for legal education in the state, with the only others being the University of Minnesota Law School and the outmoded nineteenth-century practice of \\"reading\\" law with a licensed practitioner.Douglas R. Heidenreich, With Satisfaction and Honor: William Mitchell College of Law 1900‚Äì2000, pg. 1. Three of the five were transplants from the east coast: Hiram F. Stevens, Clarence Halbert, and Ambrose Tighe. Stevens, a Vermont native, had read law with New York Court of Appeals Judge John K. Porter and graduated from Columbia Law School.Heidenreich, p. 3. When former Justice William Mitchell of the Minnesota Supreme Court died before assuming the deanship, Stevens took his place. Halbert came from New York, having graduated from Yale Law School.Heidenreich, p. 6. Tighe, also from New York, earned bachelor's and master's degrees from Yale, where he was a member of the college's Skull and Bones society.Heidenreich, p. 8. The other two founders, Thomas O'Brien and Moses Clapp, came from Minnesota and Indiana. O'Brien read law in St. Paul and later served as a justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court.Heidenreich, p. 7. Clapp graduated from the University of Wisconsin Law School, served three terms as Minnesota Attorney General, and later represented Minnesota in the United States Senate.Heidenreich, pp. 8‚Äì10. The St. Paul College of Law's first class had twenty students and annual tuition amounted to $60. During its official existence, the school was housed in three different locations, all in downtown St. Paul. Classes were originally held in the top floor of the former Ramsey County Courthouse, which had stood at Fourth and Wabasha Streets before being torn down.Heidenreich, pp. 10‚Äì11. In 1917, the school moved to the McColl Building, which still stands today, at Fifth and Jackson Streets.Heidenreich, p. 26. Finally, from 1921 until after the merger, the law school occupied what was known as the Berkey Mansion, at Sixth and College Streets.Heidenreich, p. 101. That building, also long since torn down, was located in the middle of the current Kellogg Boulevard, just south of the entrance to the Minnesota History Center. Until 1938, when it was accredited by the ABA, the law school relied entirely upon local attorneys and judges for its faculty and administration. One of them was Harry Blackmun, a professor at the St. Paul College of Law from 1935 to 1941. Years later, after the merger, Justice Blackmun also served as a Trustee of William Mitchell. Others were Minnesota Supreme Court Justices George Bunn and Oscar Hallam, both of whom served as deans of the law school while on the bench. =Minneapolis law schools= Four Minneapolis law schools followed: the Northwestern College of Law and the Minneapolis College of Law in 1912, the Minnesota College of Law in 1913, and the YMCA College of Law in 1919. Their apparent lack of institutional stability stands in contrast to the history of the St. Paul school. Among them they occupied more than a dozen different locations in downtown Minneapolis and were often beset by financial difficulties. The Northwestern school was founded by George Young, a University of Minnesota law graduate and local entrepreneur. When the University of Minnesota began to consider discontinuing its part-time evening program in 1912, Young sensed an opportunity and stepped into the breach to provide a similar service. Northwestern operated without incident until 1926, when Young died. By 1928, the school had declared bankruptcy and its students transferred to the Minneapolis College of Law. Similarly, the YMCA school ceased functioning in 1934, despite discussions of a formal merger with the Minnesota College of Law. Although incorporated in 1912, the Minneapolis school did not offer any formal classes until 1925. Its existence was dominated by funding issues, which were only alleviated by a formal merger with the Minnesota College of Law in 1940. The Minnesota school had been the most solvent of the four, so the two surviving Minneapolis law schools became one, the Minneapolis-Minnesota College of Law. =Merger= Discussions of a merger between the St. Paul College of Law and the Minneapolis-Minnesota College of Law began in 1952, but it wasn't until 1955 that they yielded tangible results. Due to shortcomings in the size of the faculty and its physical location, Minneapolis-Minnesota was repeatedly unsuccessful in gaining ABA approval.Heidenreich, p. 173. Without it, their students were not eligible for tuition assistance through the G.I. Bill. John Hervey, long- serving adviser to the ABA Section of Legal Education and Admission to the Bar, used the situation to help accomplish his goal of \\"improving legal education by pruning away the weak law schools and strengthening those that remained.\\"Heidenreich, p. 172. Hervey intimated to the Minneapolis-Minnesota Trustees that he could ensure ABA approval so long as the school agreed to merge with the St. Paul College of Law.Heidenreich, p. 180. Conversely, Hervey hinted to the St. Paul Trustees that their school could lose ABA approval if they didn't agree to move forward with the merger. In July 1956, after renewed negotiations prompted by Hervey, the Minneapolis-Minnesota College of Law (armed with provisional approval from the ABA) united with the St. Paul College of Law to become William Mitchell College of Law. The consolidated Board of Trustees selected the name to honor the St. Paul school's unofficial \\"first\\" dean, William B. Mitchell, who had been widely regarded as one of the finest U.S. jurists of the late nineteenth century. =Post-merger= The most pressing issue for WMCL Trustees after the merger was finding a new, permanent home for the school. The school reached an agreement with the University of St. Thomas to purchase land and construct its own building on the latter's undergraduate campus, located at 2100 Summit Avenue.Heidenreich, p. 184. In the interim, students enrolled at what was in name the same law school attended classes in different cities, with the Minneapolis students at their downtown campus and the St. Paul students at the Berkey Mansion.Heidenreich, p. 190. It wasn't until 1958 that the school truly unified under one roof.Heidenreich, p. 196. The next few decades saw rapid expansion for the school and its programs. By 1976, William Mitchell had outgrown the space at St. Thomas and required larger facilities. The administration successfully purchased the building at 875 Summit Avenue, a former Catholic secondary school called Our Lady of Peace. In 1974, William Mitchell had launched its flagship legal journal, the William Mitchell Law Review. This journal later formed half of the merged Mitchell Hamline Law Review. By 1980, William Mitchell began offering traditional daytime classes and the option of full- time enrollment. In 1990, the school completed work on its campus additions, which included a new classroom building and the Warren E. Burger Law Library. The library houses WMCL's collection of nearly a half-million volumes, affords electronic access to thousands of additional documents, and provides extensive study space. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor accompanied Chief Justice Burger to the dedication. Continuing its tradition of attracting adjunct faculty from the state and federal bench, Donald Lay, Paul Magnuson, Donovan Frank, Edward Toussaint, Jr. and others have taught and continue teaching at WMCL. In 2010, William Mitchell launched an intellectual property law journal, Cybaris. In 2000, to celebrate its one hundred years of legal education, Governor Jesse Ventura declared November 19‚Äì25 \\"William Mitchell Centennial Week\\" throughout the state. Later, William Mitchell became one of two law schools in the country that refused to let military recruiters on campus in protest against the Solomon Amendment.Katie Zezima, Law School Pays the Price in 'Don't Ask' Rule Protest, N.Y. Times, June 29, 2008. Employment and cost of attendance According to William Mitchell's ABA-required employment disclosures, 59.1% of the Class of 2013 obtained full-time, long-term employment requiring a J.D.\\"ABA Required Disclosures\\" Accessed July 15, 2014. William Mitchell's Law School Transparency under-employment score is 19.1%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2013 who are unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation.\\"William Mitchell College of Law Profile\\" Accessed July 15, 2014. Tuition at William Mitchell for the 2014‚Äì2015 academic year is $38,620. The estimated cost of living provided by the school is $19,450.\\"Tuition and Financing\\" Accessed July 16, 2014. Assuming no tuition increases, a typical three-year course of study at William Mitchell therefore costs $174,210, or $58,070 per year. Profile and rankings William Mitchell's 2012 entering class has 260 students, 81% of whom attend full-time. The median undergraduate GPA is 3.38 and the median LSAT score is 155. 51% of the class are men and 49% are women. 13% list themselves as minorities. Total enrollment of 930 students makes it one of the largest law schools in the Midwest. Currently, the school is unranked by U.S. News and World Report. The school's part-time program is ranked 40th. The magazine has also consistently ranked the school's clinical program as one of the best.William Mitchell legal clinic program ranked high in nationwide listing, Minneapolis-St. Paul Business Journal, April 2, 2004. National Jurist ranks William Mitchell #12 overall among law schools for public interest.\\"Top Public Interest Law Schools\\"(November 2008). http://www.nationaljurist.com/compare-schools Academics All 1Ls participate in a comprehensive course called Writing and Representation: Advice & Persuasion, or simply \\"WRAP.\\" It focuses on legal research, reasoning, and writing, while providing a broad overview of critical skills like client interviewing and counseling, contract negotiation and drafting, dispute mediation, and pretrial litigation. As 2Ls or 3Ls, students must take Advocacy, a course designed to teach basic litigation skills. Students are instructed in conducting discovery, examining witnesses, introducing exhibits, presenting opening and closing arguments, and presenting written and oral appellate arguments. =Special programs= Legal Practicum and Business Practicum are upper-level courses in which students, pairing up to form two- person law firms, hone their legal skills by handling a series of simulated cases. Each case requires mastery of integrated substantive and procedural law, and each firm must successfully participate in oral arguments, motion arguments, mediation, arbitration, negotiation, in-chambers settlement conferences, and a full-day jury trial. Students interview clients, conduct depositions, prepare pleadings and motions, compose memoranda, and draft various transactional documents. The coursework is performed under the supervision of two faculty members, as well as practicing lawyers and judges from the Twin Cities area. =Study abroad= The school belongs to the Consortium for Innovative Legal Education (CILE), in partnership with California Western School of Law, New England School of Law, and South Texas College of Law. CILE is the only program of its kind in the United States, offering students an opportunity to participate in programs and classes at any of the other three law schools. Through CILE, opportunities to study abroad are available in summer and semester programs. Summer programs are offered at the University of Edinburgh, Charles University in the Czech Republic, the University of Malta, and the National University of Ireland, Galway, while semester programs are offered at Leiden University in the Netherlands and the University of Aarhus in Denmark. Centers and institutes The Intellectual Property Institute advances the school's IP program, which features a curriculum focused on patent, trademark, and copyright law. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office chose William Mitchell as one of six law schools to participate in its Law School Clinical Certification Program. Students are allowed to practice before the agency under the direction of a faculty supervisor.Press Release, Students Given Opportunity to Practice Intellectual Property Law Before the USPTO through Law School Clinic Programs (July 22, 2008). The National Security Forum examines and debates the balance between safety and liberty in America. The Forum has hosted events and seminars featuring current and former officials from the Department of Justice, Department of State, the National Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Notable judges, professors, and journalists have also contributed to the Forum. The Rosalie Wahl Legal Practice Center directs William Mitchell's clinic, externship, and skills programs. The clinical programs are designed to offer hands-on experience in practicing law, as well as convey the importance of public service. They were established in 1973, one of the first at an American law school. The Tobacco Law Center works to improve tobacco control laws and policies at local, national, and international levels. Through research, policy development and analysis, technical assistance and consulting, the center aims to help lawmakers, nonprofit organizations, advocates, and health professionals address tobacco-related legal issues. The Center for Elder Justice & Policy provides advocacy groups with resources, technology, and information to help seniors and their families. The Center also supports William Mitchell's elder law curriculum. The Center for Negotiation & Justice is a collaboration between experienced negotiation practitioners and leading scholars in conflict and dispute resolution. Its mission is to explore, develop, and advance the connection between principled negotiation and social justice.

He has appeared in a number of science fiction productions, especially within the Star Trek franchise, as well as V and three episodes of The X-Files. Early years Scott was born in Azusa, California and attended Carl Sandberg Jr. High and Glendora High Schools. He then went to California State University, Fullerton, received a B.A. in Theatre Arts, and trained at the Actor's Studio in Los Angeles. At the end of the school year in college, Scott entered the American College Theater Festival and won the Irene Ryan Award for Best Actor in the Western United States. Scott was then offered a scholarship to Yale School of Drama, but instead attended the Juilliard School in New York City, where he again graduated with a B.A. in Theater Arts. Career In 1973, Scott starred with Al Pacino on Broadway in Shakespeare's Richard III. His first film role was in Every Which Way But Loose (1978), in which he played a biker. His other films include I, the Jury (1982) and Escape (1990). Scott starred in the short-lived 1982 science fiction television series The Phoenix. His other television roles include Lt. James in seven episodes of V, and as Sacha Malenkov on The Colbys. He also portrayed Peter Harrell on General Hospital in 1984‚Äì85.

Despite having many lines of dialogue, Scott's name does not appear in the credits. According to TV Guide, Scott's agent was in negotiations with Paramount to get his name high billing in the movie, but the tactic backfired and somehow Scott wound up with no credit at all. He played opposite Ricardo Montalb√°n, which resulted in a friendship that lasted until Montalb√°n's death in January 2009. When Montalb√°n received a lifetime achievement award in 2003, Scott was the presenter. Scott's next role in the Star Trek franchise was Sobi, a central character in \\"Symbiosis\\", a first- season episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. In this episode Scott played opposite Merritt Butrick, who played Admiral Kirk's son in Star Trek II. Scott also played a Romulan in the fourth-season Star Trek: Voyager episode \\"Message in a Bottle\\". Scott still makes appearances at science fiction conventions and has his own fan club composed mostly of Star Trek fans.

The community is close to Natchez. Located along the lower Mississippi River, it was the second and longest-serving (from 1802 until 1817) capital of the Mississippi Territory. History This brick church was erected in Washington in 1816. Mississippi's first constitution was written and adopted here, and the state's first legislature convened here in 1817. The preliminary trial of U.S. Vice-President Aaron Burr occurred under some nearby oak trees. This area along the Mississippi River had long been inhabited by indigenous peoples. At the time of European encounter, the Natchez people controlled much of the area. They were descendants of the earlier Mississippian culture that had built earthwork mounds. European Americans, settling the area after the American Revolutionary War, named the town for George Washington. Some of the original settlers of the area were Colonel Andrew Ellicott, Joseph Calvit and John Foster. Washington became the second territorial capital, when the seat of the Mississippi Territory's legislature was moved from Natchez to Washington on February 1, 1802. The Mississippi statehood convention of 1817 met in Washington at the Methodist Meeting House (which was purchased by Jefferson College in 1830). After Mississippi was admitted to the union in 1817, the legislature met once in Washington, and afterward in Natchez.J. Michael Bunn and Clay Williams, \\"Capitals and Capitols: The Places and Spaces of Mississippi‚Äôs Seat of Government\\", Mississippi History Now The capital was officially moved to Jackson in 1822, in keeping with the Act passed by the Assembly on November 28, 1821, which chose to have a more central location for better accessibility to more residents. Fort Dearborn, located at Washington, was for a time the largest military installation then extant in the United States, with more than 2,000 soldiers stationed there, including such notables as Brigadier General Leonard Covington and future General Winfield Scott. It was established in 1802 to protect the capital of the Mississippi Territory.Federal Writers' Project, Mississippi: A Guide to the Magnolia State, 1938, page 333. Washington is the location of Jefferson College, now known as Historic Jefferson College. It is operated as a state historic park and museum by the Mississippi Department of Archives and History. The college was created by an act of the first General Assembly of the Mississippi Territory in 1802 and was named in honor of Thomas Jefferson, then-president of the United States. Although chartered in 1802, it did not open as a school until 1811. Operated as a boys' academy, it continued in this capacity (but for a few brief, temporary closures, due to war, fire, remodeling and the like) for the next 153 years. It closed its doors for good in 1964. Jefferson College operated mostly as an all-male, college-preparatory academy. For a period it operated as Jefferson Military College, a military-style boarding school for high-school boys. Jefferson Davis attended Jefferson College as a 10-year-old boy in 1818, when it had the status of a boys' academy. John James Audubon was a teacher there from 1822 to 1823. Elizabeth Female Academy, considered to be the first women's college in the state, was established at Washington in 1818. For most of its history, it was a degree-conferring college; it closed in 1845. Clear Creek Baptist Church, erected in 1825 and one of the oldest churches in Mississippi, is located in Washington. In 1836 it was the site of a meeting of the Mississippi Baptist Convention, which was reorganized under President Ashley Vaughn of Natchez. The convention, or association, contained 122 churches, 56 clergy, and 4287 members.\\"Clear Creek Baptist Church\\", Stopping Points.com The congregations would have reflected the majority-black population of the area, where most workers on the cotton plantations were slaves. The town also has Washington Methodist Church. These were the two prominent denominations at the time of settlement. Both recruited slaves and accepted blacks as preachers in many locations. Before the American Civil War, both the national Baptist Association and Methodist Church split over the issue of slavery, and southern congregations established separate organizations. In 1879, the Jesse James gang robbed two stores in Washington and in Fayette in Jefferson County, Mississippi. The gang absconded with $2,000 cash in the second robbery and took shelter in abandoned cabins on the Kemp Plantation south of St. Joseph, Louisiana. A posse attacked and killed two of the outlaws but failed to capture the entire gang. Jesse James would live another three years until his demise in St. Joseph in northwestern Missouri.

They are located in the Central European region of Pannonia, which today covers almost all of Hungary, the southernmost parts of Slovakia, northeast Croatia, a tiny sliver portion of northeast Slovenia, and the northernmost part of Serbia (Vojvodina). They are also considered to be related to the northern Carpathian Rusyns (Carpathian Ruthenians) who live in Carpathian Ruthenia (mostly in Ukraine and Slovakia, but also in Poland, Romania, Czech Republic and Hungary). Demographics Rusyns in Pannonia mostly live in the autonomous province of Vojvodina in Serbia. There are 14,246 declared ethnic Rusyns in Serbia (2011 census). The village of Ruski Krstur in the Kula municipality is the cultural centre of the Pannonian Rusyns. There is a considerable concentration of Rusyns in Novi Sad, where in 1820 the construction of St. Peter and Paul Greek Catholic parish church started and was subsequently completed in 1834/1837. Other villages with a Rusyn majority include Kucura in the Vrbas municipality, and Bikiƒá Do in the ≈†id municipality. There are Pannonian Rusyn communities in Slavonia (Croatia), forming a majority in the village of Petrovci, Bogdanovci municipality, in Vukovar-Srijem county. ;Serbia, Vojvodina * Ruski Krstur (86%, 2002) * Bikiƒá Do (47,62%, 2002) * Kucura (47,18%, 2002) * ƒêurƒëevo (23,30%, 2002) ;Croatia *Petrovci, Croatia (57,17%, 1991) History The population of Banat and Baƒçka was decimated in the Ottoman wars. Rusyns emigrated to today's Banat and Baƒçka regions alongside Germans, Hungarians and Slovaks from a region that, in modern times, comprises parts of eastern Slovakia and northwestern Hungary. This was part of an intensive colonization by the Austrian Empire of the region's rich, arable land, aimed at increasing state revenue through taxes. The census of Kula municipality from 1746 shows for the first time three Rusyns -- Janko and Petro Homa and Janko Makovicki. The official date of Rusyn settlement in Vojvodina is January 17, 1751 when the administrator of Baƒçka Franc Josip de Redl signed a contract with Mihajlo Munkaƒçi from the village of ƒåervenovo, in the county of Bereg, to bring 200 Rusyn families of Greek- Catholic rite from the upper Hungarian districts known as the \\"Upper-Land\\" (–ì–æ—Ä–Ω—ó—Ü–∞) to Kerestur. Kerestur was a Serbian settlement mentioned 1741 as ruined and abandoned, as the settlers had moved to ƒåelarevo. The same administrator signed another contract on May 15, 1763 with Petro Ki≈° from Kerestur to bring 150 Rusyn families of Greek Catholic rite from the same areas in the \\"Upper-Land\\" to Kocur. As the population grew and arable land given to settlers by contract was limited, many families from Kerestur and Kocur decided to migrate to the town of Novi Sad in 1766 and 1767. Later, Rusyns settled in ≈†id and Vajska, and in the early 19th century in Vukovar and Ilok, now in modern-day Croatia. In Petrovci, also Croatia, Rusyns started settlement in 1833, and later in Baƒçinci in 1834. The census from 1767 for the whole Baƒç-Bodro≈° county (which then was part of Habsburg Monarchy and today comprises Baƒçka region in Serbia and Hungary) shows about 2.000 Rusyns. The census from 1991 in the same area shows about 25.000 Rusyns. Currently, the number of Panonian Rusyns declines and is estimated to be about 15.000. The main reason for this is the increased number of Rusyns who decided to move to Canada. Rusyns are officially recognized as an autochthonous national minority in Croatia and, as such, they elect a special representative to the Croatian Parliament, shared with members of eleven other national minorities. Language Pannonian Rusyns consider their Rusyn variety to be a distinct language. Rusyn is one of the six official languages of provincial administration in Vojvodina, while in Croatia it is officially used in two settlements.

Biography Born Schandor Herz to a Jewish family in Szklabinya, Austria- Hungary (today Sklabi≈àa, a village in modern-day Martin, Slovakia). His family emigrated to Chicago when he was five. As a young man, Hertz Jr. was an amateur boxer, fighting under the name \\"Dan Donnelly.\\" He won amateur championships at the Chicago Athletic Association and eventually began to box under his own name. He lived at 880 Fifth Avenue in New York City.HERTZ GIVES FUND FOR SCHOLARSHIPS; Transport Fortune to Train Engineers for Defense of Nation He Adopted Focusing on Those in Need, New York Times, Sept. 20, 1957 Business career Hertz had extensive and complex business interests, mainly in the transport sector. Hertz's first job was selling newspapers, and eventually he became a reporter for the Chicago Morning News. When the paper, then called the Chicago Record, merged with another paper, he lost his job. Although he couldn't drive, in 1904 he found a job selling cars at the suggestion of a friend. Because of the number of trade-ins, he conceived a cab company with low prices so the common man could afford to use them. In 1907, he had a fleet of seven used cars employed as cabs. He founded the Yellow Cab Company in Chicago in 1915, which offered taxicab service at a modest price. The distinctive yellow cabs became popular and were quickly franchised throughout the United States. He then founded the Chicago Motor Coach Company in 1917 to operate bus transport services in Chicago and the Yellow Cab Manufacturing Company in 1920 to manufactured taxicabs for sale. In 1923, he founded the Yellow Coach Manufacturing Company to manufacture coaches and later cars. In 1924, he acquired a rental car business, renaming it Hertz Drive-Ur-Self Corporation. Competition between the Yellow Cab Company and Checker Taxi in Chicago was fierce and frequently violent with a number of shootings and deaths. By 1925, the Yellow Cab Company was owned by the \\"Chicago Yellow Cab Company,\\" which in turn was owned by Hertz, Parmelee and some other investors. In that year he established The Omnibus Corporation to control both the Chicago Motor Coach Company and the Fifth Avenue Coach Company in New York. In 1925, Hertz held these positions: * President of the Yellow Cab Company * Chairman Benzoline Motor Fuel Company * Chairman Chicago Motor Coach Company * Chairman Fifth Avenue Coach Company * Chairman New York Transportation Company * Chairman Omnibus Corporation of America * Chairman Yellow Sleeve-Valve Engine Works * Chairman Yellow Truck and Coach Manufacturing Company In 1926, he sold a majority share in Yellow Cab Manufacturing Company together with its subsidiaries, Yellow Coach Manufacturing Company and \\"Hertz Drive-Ur-Self,\\" to General Motors. With the sale, Hertz joined GM's board of directors. He then sold his remaining interest in the Yellow Cab Company in 1929 following the firebombing of his stables, where 11 horses were killed. In 1933, Robert Lehman sold Hertz a minority interest in Lehman Brothers investment bank in New York City and he remained a member of the firm until his death. In 1938, Hertz was prepared to buy Eastern Air Lines from General Motors but the airline's General Manager, Eddie Rickenbacker, was able to raise sufficient financing to acquire Eastern before Hertz could exercise his option. In 1943, he sold his remaining financial interest in Yellow Coach Manufacturing Company to General Motors. Using The Omnibus Corporation he re-purchased the car rental business from General Motors in 1953. The Omnibus Corporation then divested itself of its public transport interests, changed its name to The Hertz Corporation and floated on the New York Stock Exchange the following year. Personal life In 1903, he married Francis (Fannie) Kesner of Chicago with whom he had three children: Leona Jane, John Jr., and Helen. His son was born Leonard J. Hertz and changed his name at the age of seventeen to John D. Hertz, Jr. in honor of his father; John Jr. later became an advertising executive and was briefly married (1942‚Äì44) to film star Myrna Loy. Thoroughbred horse racing John and Fannie Hertz were major figures in Thoroughbred horse racing. They owned a horse farm at Trout Valley near Cary, Illinois, another known as Amarillo Ranch in Woodland Hills, California. Stoner Creek Stud near Paris, Kentucky, became their most important breeding and training center. Raced in the name of Fannie Hertz, among her top horses were the 1928 Kentucky Derby winner and American Horse of the Year, Reigh Count, who sired Count Fleet, winner of the United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing in 1943. Both horses were inducted in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. Philanthropy During the Cold War era, Hertz established the Fannie and John Hertz Foundation with the purpose of supporting bright young minds in the applied sciences. Friend Edward Teller urged Hertz to orient his foundation to fund higher education. The Hertz Foundation Fellowship program is the nation's most selective; typically more than 800 applicants vie for ten to twelve fellowships, which provide full tuition and a generous stipend at top U.S. research universities. For his significant contribution to the security of the U.S., Hertz received the highest civilian award given by the Department of Defense in 1958. In 1924, Hertz fronted the city of Chicago $34,000 to install the city's first traffic lights on Michigan Avenue. Death Hertz died on October 8, 1961. His wife died two years later. They were originally buried together in the Rosehill Cemetery (Chicago, Illinois). Their remains are now interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City.

The treatments aim to treat convergence insufficiency - for which there is supporting evidence - and a range of neurological, educational and spatial difficulties - uses which are not supported by good evidence. Vision therapy can be prescribed when a comprehensive eye examination indicates that it is an appropriate treatment option. The specific program of therapy is based on the results of standardized tests and the person's signs and symptoms. Programs typically involve eye exercises and the use of lenses, prisms, filters, occluders, specialized instruments, and computer programs. The course of therapy may last weeks to several years, with intermittent monitoring by the eye doctor. Definition and scope Vision therapy is a broad concept that encompasses a wide range of treatment types. These include those aimed at convergence insufficiency - where it is often termed \\"vergence therapy\\" or \\"orthoptic therapy\\" - and at a variety of neurological, educational and spatial difficulties.  History  Various forms of visual therapy have been used for centuries. The concept of vision therapy was introduced in the late nineteenth century for the non-surgical treatment of strabismus. This early and traditional form of vision therapy was the foundation of what is now known as orthoptics. In the first half of the twentieth century, orthoptists, working with ophthalmologists, introduced a variety of training techniques mainly designed to improve binocular function. In the second half of the twentieth century, vision therapy began to be used by optometrists and paramedical personnel to treat conditions ranging from uncomfortable vision to poor reading and academic performance. It has also been claimed specifically to improve eyesight, and even to improve athletic performance. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, most vision therapy is done by optometrists, while traditional orthoptics continues to be practiced by orthoptists and ophthalmologists. Based on assessments of claims and studies of published data, ophthalmologists claim that, except for near point of convergence exercises, vision therapy lacks documented evidence of effectiveness.  Treatment philosophies  There exist a few different broad classifications of vision treatment philosophies, which have been traditionally divided between Optometrists, Ophthalmologists, and practitioners of alternative medicine: * Orthoptic Vision Therapy, also known as orthoptics. :Orthoptics is a field pertaining to the evaluation and treatment of patients with disorders of the visual system with an emphasis on binocular vision and eye movements. Commonly practiced by orthoptists, optometrists, behavioral optometrists, pediatric ophthalmologists, and general ophthalmologists, traditional orthoptics addresses problems of eye strain, visually induced headaches, strabismus, diplopia and visual related skills required for reading. * Behavioral Vision Therapy, or visual integration vision therapy (also known as behavioral optometry).American Academy of Ophthalmology. Complementary Therapy Assessment: Vision Therapy for Learning Disabilities. Retrieved August 2, 2006. * Alternative Vision Therapy: There have been a number of other approaches which have not been studied in traditional medicine, though which some patients feel give them relief. These methods are commonly under scrutiny by ophthamlological and optometric journals. These alternative therapies are commonly practiced by unlicensed professionals, though a minority of optometrists also provide them. =Orthoptic vision therapy= Orthoptics emphasises the diagnosis and non- surgical management of strabismus (wandering eye), amblyopia (lazy eye) and eye movement disorders.International Orthoptic Association document \\"professional role\\" Evidence to support its use in amblyopia is unclear as of 2011. Much of the practice of orthoptists concerns refraction and muscular eye control.http://www.tcos.ca/about_orthoptics.html Orthoptists are trained professionals who specialize in orthoptic treatment. With specific training, in some countries orthoptists may be involved in monitoring of some forms of eye disease, such as glaucoma, cataract screening and diabetic retinopathy Vukicevic, M., Koklanis, K and Giribaldi, M. Orthoptics: Evolving to meet increasing demand for eye service. In Insight news. March 2013: Sydney, Australia. =Behavioral vision therapy = Behavioral VT aims to treat problems including difficulties of visual attention and concentration, which behavioral optometrists classify as visual information processing weaknesses. These manifest themselves as an inability to sustain focus or to shift focus from one area of space to another. Some practitioners assert that poor eye tracking may impact reading skills, and suggest that vision training may improve some of the visual skills helpful for reading. Behavioral Vision Therapy is practiced primarily by optometrists who specialize in the area. Historically, there has been a difference in philosophy among optometry and medicine regarding the efficacy and relevance of vision therapy: Major organizations, including the International Orthoptic Association and the American Academy of Ophthalmology have concluded that there is no validity for clinically significant improvements in vision with Behavioral Vision Therapy, and therefore do not practice it. However, major optometric organizations, including the American Optometric Association, the American Academy of Optometry, the College of Optometrists in Vision Development, and the Optometric Extension Program, support the assertion that non-strabismic visual therapy does address underlying visual problems which are claimed to affect learning potential. These optometric organizations are careful to distinguish, though, that vision therapy does not directly treat learning disorders. Efficacy A more recent (2005) review concluded less positively that: \\"Less robust, but believable, evidence indicates visual training may be useful in developing fine stereoscopic skills and improving visual field remnants after brain damage. As yet there is no clear scientific evidence published in the mainstream literature supporting the use of eye exercises in the remainder of the areas reviewed, and their use therefore remains controversial.\\" In 2006, noted neurologist Oliver Sacks published a case study about \\"Stereo Sue\\", a woman who had regained her stereo vision, absent for 48 years, after undergoing vision therapy. The article was published in The New Yorker magazine, which is fact-checked but not peer-reviewed, very few details were given of the exact therapies used and the article discussed only one case of stereopsis recovery. However, the woman described by Sacks, Susan Barry, a neurobiology professor at Mt. Holyoke College, subsequently published a book, \\"Fixing My Gaze.\\" The book discusses multiple case histories and details the therapy procedures and the science underlying them. A systematic review of the literature on the effects of vision therapy on visual field defects published in 2007 concluded that it was unclear to what extent patients benefited from vision restoration therapy (VRT) as \\"no study has given a satisfactory answer.\\" The authors concluded that scanning compensatory therapy (SCT) seemed to provide a more successful rehabilitation, and simpler training techniques, therefore they recommended SCT until the effects of VRT could be defined. A 2008 review of the literature concluded that \\"there is a continued paucity of controlled trials in the literature to support behavioral optometry approaches. Although there are areas where the available evidence is consistent with claims made by behavioral optometrists ... a large majority of behavioral management approaches are not evidence-based, and thus cannot be advocated.\\" Other than for strabismus (such as intermittent exotropia) and convergence insufficiency, the consensus among ophthalmologists, orthoptists and pediatricians is that non-strabismic visual therapy lacks documented evidence of effectiveness. In 1998, the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Ophthalmology, and American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus issued a policy statement regarding the use of vision therapy specifically for the treatment of learning problems and dyslexia. According to the statement: \\"No scientific evidence exists for the efficacy of eye exercises ('vision therapy')... in the remediation of these complex pediatric neurological conditions.\\" More recently, in 2004, the American Academy of Ophthalmology released a position statement asserting that there is no evidence that vision therapy retards the progression of myopia, no evidence that it improves visual function in those with hyperopia or astigmatism, or that it improves vision lost through disease processes. This was also supported by the International Orthoptic Association. The Joint Statement mentioned above was criticised at the time by Merrill Bowan, a vision therapy enthusiast, for being biased, with the author of a rebuttal concluding \\"The AAP/AAO/AAPOS paper contains errors and internal inconsistencies. Through highly selective reference choices, it misrepresents the great body of evidence from the literature that supports a relationship between visual and perceptual problems as they contribute to classroom difficulties.\\". The author also states that the Joint Statement presents an unsupported opinion by implication that Optometrists claim that vision therapy cures the learning problem. A similar criticism could be leveled at the 2004 American Academy of Ophthalmology paper which implies that vision therapy is claimed to treat \\"vision lost through disease processes\\". There is a common theme that critics of vision therapy seem to do by placing vision therapy under the same banner with alternative therapies. By implication, the lack of evidence for the alternative therapies is cited as a lack of evidence for vision therapy. No supporting evidence is given that vision therapy is actually used to treat eye disease or vision lost through disease processes. Some optometrists take a slightly different view. In 1999 a joint statement by the American Academy of Optometry, the American Optometric Association, the College of Optometrists in Vision Development and Optometric Extension Program Foundation reported: \\"Many visual conditions can be treated effectively with spectacles or contact lenses alone; however, some are most effectively treated with vision therapy....Research has demonstrated that vision therapy can be an effective treatment option for ocular motility problems, non-strabismic binocular disorders, strabismus, amblyopia, accommodative disorders (and) visual information processing disorders.\\" Practitioners in Behavioral optometry (also known as functional optometrists or optometric vision therapists) practice methods that have been characterized as a complementary alternative medicine practice.Torin Monahan. \\"Vision Control and Autonomy Constraints: Managed Care Confronts Alternative Medicine.\\" June 1998. Accessed September 19, 2006. A review in 2000 concluded that there were insufficient controlled studies of the approach and a 2008 review concluded that \\"a large majority of behavioural management approaches are not evidence-based, and thus cannot be advocated.\\" The consensus among Ophthalmologists, Orthoptists and Pediatricians is that \\"visual training\\" in non-strabismic Behavioural Vision therapy lacks documented scientific evidence of effectiveness. Although Ophthalmologists and Orthoptists believe that exercises can improve binocular vision control, they believe it does not purely improve monocular visual acuity such as that in amblyopia (rather, occlusion is the therapy of choice), change a person's refractive error. It is probable that they do not change the accommodative/convergence ratio nor change the amplitude of accommodation to postpone or delay presbyopia. It has been considered that they are unlikely to a person to develop the ability for stereopsis; nonetheless recent experimental investigations into dedicated perceptual learning exercises, inspired by Barry's recovery of stereopsis, have shown some promise.  Behavioral optometry Behavioral optometry is a branch of optometry that explores how visual function influences a patient's day-to-day activities. Vision therapy is a subset of behavioral optometry. In general, vision therapists attempt to improve vision, and therefore day-to-day well-being, of patients using \\"eye exercises,\\" prism, and lenses, with more emphasis on the patient's visual function. Among schools of medicine, ophthalmology does not see merit in the procedures surrounding many of behavioral optometry's practices, arguing that there have not been enough studies of high enough merit to warrant practicing of vision therapy. = Techniques = In a 2008, vision scientist Brendan Barrett published a review of behavioral optometry at the invitation of the UK College of Optometrists. Barrett wrote that behavioral optometry was not a well-defined field but that it was sometimes said to be an \\"extension\\" to optometry, taking a holistic approach: practitioners of the therapy use techniques outside mainstream optometry to \\"influence the visual process\\". Barrett discussed these techniques under ten headings: *Vision therapy for accommodation/vergence disorders - eye exercises and training to try and alleviate these disorders. There is evidence that convergence disorders may be helped by eye exercises, but no good evidence exercises help with accommodation disorders. *The underachieving child - therapies claimed to help children with dyslexia, dyspraxia and attention deficit disorder - a \\"vulnerable\\" target market. There is no evidence that behavioral optometry is of any benefit in relation to these conditions. *Prisms for near binocular disorders and for producing postural change - the use of \\"yoked\\" prisms to redirect a person's gaze and bring about a range of claimed benefits including postural improvements and increased wellbeing. There is a lack of evidence for the effect this approach may have. *Near point stress and low-plus - the use of special lenses to adjust near-field vision, even for people who would not normally need glasses. This is claimed to bring about postural benefits and relieve visual stress. Some research has been carried out in this area and its effectiveness remains \\"unproven\\". *Use of low-plus lenses at near to slow the progression of myopia *Therapy to reduce myopia *Behavioural approaches to the treatment of strabismus and amblyopia *Training central and peripheral awareness and syntonics *Sports vision therapy *Neurological disorders and neurorehabilitation after trauma/stroke. Barrett noted the lack of published controlled trials of the techniques. He found that there are a few areas where the available evidence suggest that the approach might have some value, namely in the treatment of convergence insufficiency, the use of yoked prisms in neurological patients, and in vision rehabilitation after brain disease or injury‚Äîbut he found that in the other areas where the techniques have been used, the majority, there is no evidence of their value. In contrast, Steven Novella points out that the only condition that there is good quality scientific evidence for is convergence disorders. This points out a problem that is common with Complementary or integrative medicine, a type of Alternative medicine, is that a promising use for treating a single disorder is applied to a wide range of disorders for which there is no evidence. =Eye exercises= The eye exercises used in vision therapy can generally be divided into two groups; those employed for \\"strabismic\\" outcomes and those employed for \\"non-strabismic\\" outcomes, to improve eye health. Ophthalmologists and orthoptists do not endorse these exercises as having clinically significant validity for improvements in vision. Usually, they see these perceptual-motor activities being in the sphere of either speech therapy or occupational therapy. Some of the exercises used are *Near point of convergence training, or the ability for both eyes to focus on a single point in space, *Base-out prism reading, stereogram cards, computerized training programs are used to improve fusional vergence. *The wearing of convex lenses *The wearing of concave lenses * \\"Cawthorne Cooksey Exercises\\" also employ various eye exercises, however, these are designed to alleviate vestibular disorders, such as dizziness, rather than eye problems. * Antisuppression exercises - this is no longer commonly practiced, although occasionally it may be used. The eye exercises used in Behavioural Vision Therapy, also known as Developmental Optometry is practiced primarily by Behavioural Optometrists. Behavioral Vision Therapy aims to treat problems including difficulties of visual attention and concentration, which may manifest themselves as an inability to sustain focus or to shift focus from one area of space to another. Some of the exercises used are: *Marsden balls *Rotation trainers *Syntonics *Balance board/beams *Saccadic fixators *Directional sequencers Fusional Amplitude and Relative Fusional Amplitude training *Designed to alleviate convergence insufficiency. The CITT study (Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Trial) was is a randomized, double-blind multi-center trial (high level of reliability) indicates that Orthoptic Vision Therapy is an effective method of treatment of convergence insufficiency (CI). Both optometry and ophthalmology were co-authors of this study. *Designed to alleviate intermittent exotropia or other less common forms of strabismus. Certain do-it-yourself eye exercises are claimed by some to improve visual acuity by reducing or eliminating refractive errors. Such claims rely mainly on anecdotal evidence, and are not generally endorsed by orthoptists, ophthalmologists or optometrists. Chinese school children always do eye exercises twice per day during school, which are compulsory. They are also part of other forms category's as they are also do-it-yourself exercises although quite a few scientists say that they actually harm the children's eyeshttp://asiancorrespondent.com/86234/chinas-doctors-warn-eye-exercises-may- harm-students-vision/ The German optician Hans-Joachim Haase developed a method to correct an alleged misalignment. His method, called the MKH method, is not recognized as an evidence-based approach. = Conceptual basis and effectiveness = Behavioral optometry is largely based on concepts which lack plausibility or which contradict mainstream neurology, and most of the research done has been of poor quality. As with chiropractic, there seems to be a spectrum of scientific legitimacy among practitioners: at one extreme there is some weak evidence in support of the idea that myopia may be affected by eye training; at the other extreme are concepts such as \\"syntonic phototherapy\\" which proposes that differently colored lights can be used to treat a variety of medical conditions. A review in 2000 concluded that there were insufficient controlled studies of the approach. In 2008 Barrett concluded that \\"the continued absence of rigorous scientific evidence to support behavioural management approaches, and the paucity of controlled trials in particular, represents a major challenge to the credibility of the theory and practice of behavioural optometry.\\" Behavioral optometry has been proposed as being of benefit for children with Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism ‚Äì this proposal is based on the idea that since people with these conditions often have abnormal eye movement, correcting this may address the underlying condition. Evidence supporting this approach is however weak; the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Ophthalmology and the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus have said that learning disabilities are neither caused nor treatable by visual methods.Wolraich et al. 2008, pp. 269-270. = History = Behavioral optometry is considered by some optometrists to have its origins in orthoptic vision therapy. However, Vision therapy is differentiated between strabismic/orthoptic vision therapy (which many Optometrists, Orthoptists and Ophthalmologists practice) and non-strabismic vision therapy. A.M. Skeffington was an American optometrist known to some as \\"the father of behavioral optometry\\".\\"A.M. Skeffington, O.D.: The Father of Behavioral Optometry.\\" Visionaries (Reprinted from January‚ÄìDecember 1991 Issues of Review of Optometry) Review of Optometry. Accessed February 5, 2012. Skeffington has been credited as co-founding the Optometric Extension Program with E.B. Alexander in 1928. =Research= A review in 2000 concluded that there were insufficient controlled studies of the approach and a 2008 review concluded that \\"a large majority of behavioral management approaches are not evidence-based, and thus cannot be advocated.\\" =Sports Vision Training= Practitioners of sports vision training claim to be able to enhance the function of a current athlete's vision beyond what is expected in individuals with already healthy visual systems.\\"Sports & Performance Vision: Tools for expanding your practice and reaching new patients.\\" American Optometric Association. Retrieved April 11, 2020.Erickson, Graham (2007). Sports Vision. Butterworth-Heinneman. =Alternative Vision Therapy= Alternative vision therapies include methods that some patients feel subjectively help them. Many optometrists and ophthalmologists are skeptical of the efficacy of these methods and practices, though some have been found to have at least a basis in studied principles to some limited degree (such as syntonics and melanopsin, TBI and tinted lenses. * Syntonic Phototherapyhttp://www.collegeofsyntonicoptometry.com & the Irlen Methodhttps://www.irlensyndrome.org * The Bates method * The Neo-Reichian approach * Iridology * Controversy Some physicians are skeptical about the efficacy of \\"vision therapy\\" stating that it lacks data and is mostly anecdotal. In 2009, the American Academy of Pediatrics along with the American Academy of Ophthalmology \\"essentially declared war\\" on developmental optometry, as Judith Warner wrote in a New York Times article. Even within the field of optometry the U.K. College of Optometrists noted the \\"Continued absence of rigorous scientific evidence to support behavioral management approaches\\" in the second college of Optometrists report. The American Academy of Pediatrics is also critical of behavioral optometry. In 2009 it reviewed 35 years of the literature in support of vision therapy and issued a statement ‚Äî in conjunction with other ophthalmological associations ‚Äî condemning the therapy and its contention that it could help with learning disabilities. Visual problems, it claimed, are not the basis for learning disabilities. It issued a stern warning about the seductions of treatments that sound convincing but aren‚Äôt based on science: \\"Ineffective, controversial methods of treatment such as vision therapy may give parents and teachers a false sense of security that a child‚Äôs learning difficulties are being addressed, may waste family and/or school resources and may delay proper instruction or remediation.\\" The website by the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus states: \\"Behavioral vision therapy is considered to be scientifically unproven\\" and \\"There is no evidence that vision therapy delays the progression or leads to correction of myopia.\\" See also * Journal of Behavioral Optometry * Visual Snow References Further reading  * * Category:Alternative medical treatments Category:Vision Category:Therapy Category:Optometry Category:Eye procedures ","title":"Vision therapy"},{"id":"2010282","text":"R.H.

Early life There were five children in her family growing up. Her parents recognized early that she had talent, possibly when they and she watched \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" and then she went to the piano and picked out \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" note for note. Her mother loved show tunes. The family also listened to Johnny Cash, Marty Robbins, and the Rat Pack. At age five she enrolled in a gifted kids art program at UCLA. When Concrete Blonde first started, she found it difficult to sing and play bass simultaneously.  Co-founding and tenure with Concrete Blonde  See article on Concrete Blonde. For Concrete Blonde discography, see Concrete Blonde#Discography (within full article on Concrete Blonde)  Solo career  She has also recorded as a solo artist, with the albums Sketchbook (2002), Sketchbook 2 (2006), Scarred (2007), and Sketchbook 3 (2010), and as a member of: * Dream 6 (a precursor to Concrete Blonde). * Vowel Movement, a side project; a semi-improvisational musical collaboration with Holly Beth Vincent. * Pretty & Twisted, a side project; a band that also featured former Wall of Voodoo guitarist Marc Moreland. * Lead singer for the album tour for The Heads, the re-formed Talking Heads' project, with Jerry Harrison, Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth. She is featured on the 1996 album No Talking, Just Head. This was, at the time, intended to turn into a full-time project, with further studio albums and tours. A live CD-video of the first tour was planned, featuring performances from many of the album's guest artists and Napolitano on vocals for the songs originally recorded by Talking Heads. David Byrne sued the band, saying their name and presentation was too evocative of Talking Heads, and put an end to those plans. * Napolitano also recorded a solo album titled Sound of a Woman around 1996‚Äì1997, and performed many of the songs on a solo tour opening for Paul Weller. The album was set to be released on IRS (a subdivision of Island Records), the label of her old band, Concrete Blonde. 1997‚Äì1998 was a bad time for Island, starting with the sudden departure of founder-CEO Chris Blackwell and ending with the total reorganization of the label. Sound of a Woman was, effectively, lost in the shuffle, and at this point is unlikely to ever be officially released. Bootleg copies of this album are rare and highly valued.

It was Whyte's first book. It received little attention when it was first published, but upon being reissued in 1955 it became a bestseller as well as a standard college text, and established Whyte's reputation as a pioneer in participant observation. Background In the late 1930s, on a fellowship from Harvard University, Whyte lived in the North End of Boston, which was mostly inhabited by first- and second-generation immigrants from Italy. Whyte, who came from a well-to-do family, considered the neighborhood a slum, and wanted to learn more about its \\"lower class\\" society. Whyte lived in that district for three and a half years, including 18 months he spent with an Italian family. Through this work, Whyte became a pioneer in participant observation (which he called \\"participant observer research\\"). Overview Street Corner Society describes various groups and communities within the district. Compaesani - people originally from the same Italian town - are one example. The first part of the book contains detailed accounts of how local gangs were formed and organized. Whyte differentiated between \\"corner boys\\" and \\"college boys\\": The lives of the \\"corner boys\\" revolved around particular street corners and the nearby shops. Conversely, the \\"college boys\\" were more interested in good education and moving up the social ladder. The second part of the book describes the relations of social structure, politics, and racketeering in that district. It is also a testament to the importance of WPA jobs at the time. Reception The book was first published as Street Corner Society: The Social Structure of an Italian Slum by the University of Chicago Press in 1943. It received little attention at the time, but when it was republished in 1955 it garnered critical praise and became a bestseller and a standard college text. It has since been translated into at least six different languages and reprinted in many editions. Not all the reviews have been positive. The book was not popular in the North End, and Whyte's description of the neighborhood as a \\"slum\\" has been called into question. Former Boston city councilman Frederick C. Langone, who lived in the North End and knew Whyte personally, believed Whyte had mischaracterized the neighborhood: :What his book did to the North End was to make it look like everybody was in some kind of racket....In fact, the exact opposite was true....William Whyte's book Street Corner Society was required reading in every college. Consequently, students got the wrong perception of the North End and the Italian-American inhabitants.

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Vraƒçar.  Location  Savinac is located in the western part of the municipality, on the western slopes of the Vraƒçar hill and stretches from the Slavija square to the Vraƒçar plateau and the Temple of Saint Sava. The main streets in the neighborhood are Svetog Save, Makenzijeva and the Boulevard of the Liberation. Originally, the term stretched west of the boulevard (present Karaƒëorƒëev Park), but today not many people consider that part of Belgrade as part of Vraƒçar.  History  The neighborhood of Savinac almost entirely overlaps the neighborhood of Englezovac. Construction of the neighborhood began in 1880 when a Scottish businessman and Nazarene Francis Mackenzie bought a large piece of land nearby (which eventually became known as Englezovac, Serbian for Englishman's place), parcelled it out into lots for selling and donated a piece of land to the Serbian Orthodox Church for the construction of the Temple of Saint Sava. \\"The Society for the Embellishment of Vraƒçar\\" suggested to Belgrade City Council to rename Englezovac to Savinac (Serbian for Sava‚Äôs place) on March 31, 1894. They stated that it is \\"a shame for the Serbian capital that a whole district is called Englezovac\\" and unconceivable that a national shrine (Temple of Saint Sava) lie on foreign property. In narrower sense, Savinac is just the triangular part between the streets of Svetog Save on the east, and the Boulevard of the Liberation, to which term Englezovac didn't apply. However, the large residential and park complex new name of Savinac was gradually dropped from public usage, and the only remainder of that name was the kafana Savinac which was closed in early 2000s. In the late 1980s, many books and articles on \\"Old Belgrade\\" became popular again and so the term Englezovac, at this time already unknown to majority of people, resurfaced, but not Savinac. However, just like Savinac, it didn't get the popular usage, and most of Belgraders still refer to this part of the city as Vraƒçar. Apart from Savinac, other famous Belgrade kafanas in the neighborhood included Mala Astronomija (\\"Little Astronomy\\"), founded in the 1890s, and Oraƒç (\\"The Plowman\\"), opened in 1948. Both were located along the Boulevard of the Liberation and demolished in 1996, with Oraƒç being relocated to the Makenzijeva street in the neighborhood of ƒåubura. Historically, Savinac represented geographical end of Belgrade, opposite to Kalemegdan, on Belgrade's central line Kalemegdan-Trg Republike-Terazije-Beograƒëanka-Slavija‚ÄìSavinac, where central line, tram No 1 used to run, in the first half of the 20th century.

The first production F3F-1 (BuNo 0211) was delivered on 29 January 1936 to the test group at Naval Air Station Anacostia, with squadron service beginning in March to VF-5B of and VF-6B of . Marine squadron VF-4M received the last six in January 1937.Dann 1996, p. 27. Grumman, wanting to take advantage of the powerful new 950 hp (708 kW) Wright R-1820 supercharged radial engine, began work on the F3F-2 without a contract; the order for 81 aircraft was not placed until 25 July 1936, two days before the type's first flight. The engine's larger diameter changed the cowling's appearance, making the aircraft look even more like a barrel, though top speed increased to 255 mph (410 km/h) at 12,000 ft (3,658 m). The entire F3F-2 production series was delivered in between 1937 and 1938; when deliveries ended, all seven Navy and Marine Corps pursuit squadrons were equipped with Grumman single-seat fighters. Further aerodynamic improvements were made to an F3F-2 (BuNo 1031) based on wind tunnel studies in the NACA Langley 30' x 60' full-scale wind tunnel and became the XF3F-3. It featured a larger-diameter propeller, and a complete revision of the fuselage skinning forward of the aft cabane strut in order to improve aerodynamics and reduce carbon monoxide intrusion. On 21 June 1938, the Navy ordered 27 F3F-3s, as new monoplane fighters like the Brewster F2A and Grumman's own F4F Wildcat were taking longer to develop than had been planned.Crosby 2002, p. 77. With the introduction of the Brewster F2A-1, the Navy's biplane fighter days were numbered. All F3Fs were withdrawn from squadron service by the end of 1941, though 117 were assigned to naval bases (Mainly NAS Miami and NAS Corpus Christi) and used for training and utility duties until December 1943. The G-32 and G-32A two-place aircraft were used by the U.S. Army Air Force as ferry-pilot trainers, under the designation UC-103/UC-103A.

Thousands of opposition activists were imprisoned without charge, and as many as 91 killed.Poland marks communist crackdown, BBC News, 13 December 2006 Although martial law was lifted in 1983, many political prisoners were not released until a general amnesty in 1986. Since the 1970s, communist Poland was in a deep economic recession. The First Secretary Edward Gierek made large incessant loans from western creditors to achieve a better economic output that instead resulted in a domestic crisis. Essential goods were being heavily rationed, which acted as a stimulus to establish a first anti-communist trade union in the Eastern Bloc, known as Solidarity, in 1980. Gierek, who permitted the trade union to appear per the Gda≈Ñsk Agreement, was dismissed from his post less than a month later under pressure from the USSR and confined to house arrest. Poland's already somewhat liberal policies concerning the opposition were worrisome for hardliners in the neighbouring Soviet Union. The latter feared that the Poles might overthrow communism and ally themselves with the Western Bloc. The Soviets were particularly uneasy as the departure of Eastern Bloc's most populous nation from Comecon would trigger further financial and economic problems that would bring an end to communist rule in Central-Eastern Europe. After a series of strikes and demonstrations by employees of chief industrial regions, Poland was directly heading towards bankruptcy. The Military Council of National Salvation was formed by the new First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, General Wojciech Jaruzelski, who was determined to put an end to the demonstrations and crush the opposition by force if necessary. There is speculation whether Jaruzelski instigated martial law to prevent bloodshed if the Soviets and other Warsaw Pact countries were to enter Poland under the mutual assistance treaty, like in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. On 13 December 1981, Jaruzelski announced the introduction of martial law in a televised speech addressed to the entire nation. The Polish People's Army, Citizens' Militia (MO), ZOMO special units and tanks rolled onto the streets to scare off demonstrators, begin regular patrols and maintain curfew. Intercity travelling was forbidden unless a permit was granted by the authorities, food shortages intensified and censorship was placed again on all media and post. The secret services (SB) wiretapped phones in public booths and state institutions. On 16 December, pro-Solidarity miners organized a strike against the declaration of martial law at the Wujek Coal Mine in the industrial city of Katowice. The ZOMO squads, nicknamed \\"Communist Gestapo\\" by the opposition, brutally pacified Wujek, which resulted in 9 miners' deaths. All other demonstrations across Poland were met with an armed force, which utilized water cannons, tear gas, batons, truncheons and clubs to disperse crowds and beat protesters. Thousands were detained, and some were tortured in state prisons. On 31 August 1982, in the copper-mining town of Lubin, three people were mortally wounded. Until the end of the Martial Law on 22 July 1983, approximately 91 people were killed, though this figure varies and is still debated among historians. PreludeReforms of Edward Gierek (1970-1975)= Gierek in the White House with President Gerald Ford, 1974 When Edward Gierek succeeded Gomu≈Çka as the head of state in 1970, he took decisive measures to boost economic growth and develop modern infrastructure. Gierek, a more liberal figure than his predecessor, was determined to make Poland the wealthiest and most economically significant communist country of the Eastern Bloc. However, these ideas prompted resistance from hardline communist leadership as the reform would effectively abandon the fundamental principles of a centrally planned Marxist economy. The grip and emphasis on state-owned enterprises and state-controlled prices or trade were eventually loosened. Small private businesses began to appear and Poland recorded temporary growth in GDP and an improvement in living conditions. Gierek maintained close ties with the United States, which he subsequently used for diplomatic and economic purposes. In order to continue with the reforms, large sums of money were borrowed from creditors in the Western Bloc. These sequential and uninterrupted loans were primarily targeted at establishing heavy industry, mines or manufacturing facilities that would produce goods for export. The projected income from the exports would then be used to pay off the debt. Apart from financing the economic sector, the money was spent on social housing and on expanding road connections, for example the first fully operational highway linking Warsaw with industrial Silesia was opened for traffic in 1976. Furthermore, over 1.8 million plattenbau flats were constructed to house the growing population. Agricultural output rose by nearly 22% between 1971 and 1975, and industrial production by 10.5% annually.https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA- RDP86T00608R000500200020-4.pdffile:///C:/Users/User/Downloads/Harmonijny_rozwoj_czy_droga_ku_p.pdf Gierek also initiated the construction of Warszawa Centralna, Europe's most modern railway station at the time. =Crisis; debt, rationing and shortages (1976-1981)= A ration card for sugar, 1976 As expenditures increased and debts accumulated, the West would no longer grant Poland loans. Moreover, the 1973, June 1976 protests and 1979 oil crises affected the fragile economy. Due to previous GDP growth, higher income and expanded industries, the demand for certain goods and consumption surged. New factories and state enterprises required imported fuel, materials and a workforce to operate production lines. Soon, the country started exporting locally-produced stock designated for the Polish populace, thus resulting in widespread shortages. Because the remaining assets were directed at production, exports and debt repayment, the state also reduced imports to minimize expenses. In 1976, the communist government introduced ration cards for sugar, meat, processed food and dairy followed. Confectionery, cocoa, coffee, rice, tobacco and other goods not produced in Poland were so heavily rationed that they were almost permanently unavailable. Due to the constant lack of tobacco, ordinary cigarettes became a form of new currency on the black market.http://www.ippt.pan.pl/Repository/zycie_%20w_ciekawych_czasach_15_10_2012.pdf The living standards began to sharply decline; the supply of imported goods was kept to a low minimum and the country was forced to export everything it could, including coal necessary for basic heating and power plants. Power outages were commonplace. By 1980, the debt accounted to over US$23 billion, then almost half of Poland's nominal GDP. Edward Gierek (right) with President Jimmy Carter (left) during his state visit to Warsaw, 1977. The loans and Solidarity were among the chief topics discussed At the same time, the newly- founded Solidarity movement encouraged farmers to refrain from selling agricultural products (wheat, grain, fruit and others) to the state as a sign of protest. The actual shortage of goods on the market and in stores was caused by the fact that production was occasionally halted due to the strikes organized by Solidarity. In 1980, the national income fell by 6% compared to previous year, and in 1981 by 12%. The number of exports declined by 4.2%. Mismanagement and wastefulness were abundant. On 6 September 1980, Gierek was dismissed from his office, expelled from the Polish United Workers' Party (possibly under the pressure from the Soviet Union) and falsely charged with corruption.file:///C:/Users/User/Downloads/Dyskusja-wokol-ksiazki-Rozliczenia- z-ekipa-Gierka-19801984-Warszawa-6-wrzesnia-2.pdf A year later, on 10 September 1981, the Soviet authorities informed the Polish government that in connection with the prevailing situation in Poland the USSR would cut oil supply to Poland by 64% and gas by 47%.Andrzej Krajewski, ‚ÄûGazowa pƒôtla‚Äù, Dziennik Gazeta Prawna nr 111/2016. The import of diesel from the Soviet Union was terminated immediately. This action was intended to force the Polish communist authorities to suppress the demonstrations and dissolve Solidarity. The situation was already dire and gradually worsened, which only fueled anti- communist sentiment. A civil war was hanging by a thread. In 1981, Poland notified Club de Paris (a group of Western-European central banks) about its insolvency, which caught the attention of the entire world. Introduction, restrictions, patrolsSecret preparations and provocation= Jaruzelski was determined to suppress any opposition along with the Solidarity Movement After the short tenure of Stanis≈Çaw Kania, General and Minister of Defence Wojciech Jaruzelski was chosen as the new First Secretary. Before assuming office, Jaruzelski ordered the Polish General Staff to update plans for a nationwide martial law on 22 October 1980.From Solidarity to Martial Law: The Polish Crisis of 1980‚Äì1981: A Documentary History by Andrzej Paczkowski, Malcolm Byrne. Central European University Press, Budapest 2007. p. xxxiii In November 1980, the Ministry of Internal Affairs planned to potentially facilitate thousands of oppositionists in state prisons and places of internment. On 5 December 1980, Kania spoke of the preparations relating to martial law at the Warsaw Pact Summit in Moscow.https://www.polityka.pl/tygodnikpolityka/historia/1533463,1,stanislaw- kania---przeciwnik-stanu-wojennego.read He presented his own view of how to weaken Solidarity and insisted that a \\"psychological-operational method\\" would be most appropriate to prevent violence. This method entailed strong propaganda against the movement and deploying Secret Services (SB) to go undercover and infiltrate Solidarity headquarters in the hope of creating internal conflicts within the opposition. General Jaruzelski was not fully satisfied with the plan, and, in case of failure, already planned radical actions involving the army. Stanis≈Çaw Kania warned Brezhnev that an armed intervention from the Soviet side to aid Jaruzelski would be met \\"with a violent reaction, or even with a national uprising\\" that would shake the politics of the Eastern Bloc. Zbigniew Brzezinski, chief security advisor to US President Jimmy Carter, stated that if the Soviet Union would undertake an armed intervention in Poland, the US would strike back in a riposte manner. According to historian and publicist Paul Kengor, the then US President Ronald Reagan considered sending American troops to Poland to scare off the Soviets. This claim was not supported by Brzezinski nor by Richard Pipes from Harvard University. Kengor then elaborated that Reagan eventually abandoned the plan after he was convinced by his own advisors that the US army stationed across Europe is less capable and much weaker than the Soviet forces. The United States eventually struck back with economic sanctions against Poland and the USSR. A censored regional newspaper that reported about the Bydgoszcz events, in which the Militia abused Solidarity members. The censorship was to prevent the slander of state services In February 1981, the Ministry of National Defence and Ministry of the Internal Affairs carried out a training scenario, the purpose of which was to explore how martial law will be introduced. The ministries agreed that martial law should be preceded by appropriate propaganda calling for its support, and the decision itself should be based on a pretext that it would bring peace and stability for the society.file:///C:/Users/User/Downloads/Ruzikowski_Stan_wojenny_w_Warszawie.pdf It was also highlighted that martial law must occur before the fully mobilized Fighting Solidarity and its allies organize a general strike that would paralyze the entire country. By March, the situation escalated after the Bydgoszcz events, in which local Solidarity delegates invited for a Regional National Council meeting in Bydgoszcz to discuss potential strikes were beaten and abused by the Citizens' Militia (MO). The event, which was to feature in newspapers as a provocation, was concealed by censors. On 27 March, Solidarity organized a warning strike directed at the government, but, on 30 March, Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa met with Mieczys≈Çaw Rakowski and a compromise was achieved. The general strike was called off and the situation stabilized for a short period. In July, the Soviets increased their military presence in the military base at Borne Sulinowo, where the Red Army stationed per Warsaw Pact agreement as in all other Eastern Bloc countries. Without notifying the Polish authorities, the Soviets unexpectedly sent over 600 tanks to Borne Sulinowo. A month later, commander-in-chief of the Warsaw Pact, Viktor Kulikov, requested that Soviet military advisors are to be placed in the Polish General Staff and assigned to nearly all Polish regiments. It is suspected that Kulikov, acting on behalf of the Soviet Union, was tasked with sending undercover KGB agents to monitor the situation in Poland from the Polish military's perspective. His request, however, was immediately denied by the Polish government. Over 25,000 posters announcing martial law were secretly printed in the USSR, transported to Poland by airplane and hidden in the large building housing the Ministry of Internal Affairs.Ryszard Terlecki: Miecz i tarcza komunizmu. Historia aparatu bezpiecze≈Ñstwa w Polsce 1944-1990, Krak√≥w 2007, p. 270‚Äì271. The full extent of the actions undertaken by Jaruzelski to instigate martial law was not known by even some of the highest notables in the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party or the Polish Sejm.file:///C:/Users/User/Downloads/akt- oskarzenia-S-101-04-Zk_2%20(1).pdf =12-13 December 1981; Operations Fir and Azalea= The Military Council of National Salvation (WRON), which was founded on 13 December and presided over the military junta. Its Polish abbreviation \\"WRONa\\" means a crow bird, and members of the council were known to the opposition as evil \\"Crows\\" On 12 December 1981, shortly before midnight, the Polish Council of State gathered in Warsaw's Belweder Palace and approved nationwide martial law. Simultaneously, the Military Council of National Salvation (WRON - Wrona is translated as \\"Crow\\") was founded and its members were high-ranking generals or military officers in the Polish People's Army, who were in charge of the military junta. The generals and officers later became known to the public as evil \\"Crows\\", in relation to the Polish name of the council. At precisely 00:00 (12:00 a.m.), the Motorized Reserves of the Citizens' Militia (ZOMO) began \\"Akcja Jod≈Ça\\" (English: Operation Fir) and arrested the first members of Solidarity who were at close reach. They were then placed in previously-prepared detention facilities. In total, between 70,000 and 80,000 soldiers of the People's Army and 30,000 functionaries of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (including SB, ZOMO and the Militia) were deployed for action. Around 1,750 tanks, 1,900 armoured combat vehicles, 500 militarized transport units, 9,000 cars and several helicopter squadrons were in service. 25% of all units concentrated in the capital, Warsaw, or in surrounding localities. Preceding Jod≈Ça was \\"Akcja Azalia\\" (English: Operation Azalea), which began at around 22:30 (10:30 p.m.) on 12 December. Per Azalea, the SB secret services, paramilitary troops, the Militia, ZOMO and Border Protection Troops stormed 451 telecommunications exchange facilities and cut telephone lines to allegedly prevent the spread of misinformation. However, the operation's true purpose was preventing Solidarity from contacting its branches in other cities to mobilize protesters. Radio and television stations were also besieged. Any volunteers wishing to assist in the arrests were drafted into ORMO. The Polish Radio informed about martial law being imposed at a 06:00 (6:00 a.m.) audition, and transmitted the speech made by General Jaruzelski. Telewizja Polska network and its chief news program Dziennik (English: Journal) aired the speech in a slightly modified version. The declaration was watched by millions of Polish citizens despite the early hour. =16 December 1981; Wujek Coal Mine= ZOMO squads with police batons preparing to disperse and beat protesters. The sarcastic caption reads \\"outstretched hands of understanding\\" or \\"outstretched hands for agreement\\", with batons ironically symbolizing hands Three days after restrictions were imposed, miners at the Wujek Coal Mine in the industrial city of Katowice began striking against the declaration of martial law by General Jaruzelski. Most of the miners and workers at Wujek were allied with the Solidarity Movement, with its leaders boycotting the state industries. Furthermore, coal was a precious fuel source that was used for generating electricity and heat, but also a major export material. By selling and exporting coal, the communist government obtained enough money to gradually pay off the outstanding debt. However, as Solidarity boycotted the mines in Silesia and demonstrations became more frequent, the production level dropped considerably along with revenue. Jaruzelski perceived this as a threat to both state security and the economy. The forces used in the thrust consisted of eight ZOMO squads supported by ORMO, seven water cannons, three regiments with infantry combat vehicles and one tank regiment. It was decided that the situation was far too serious for adopting the principles of morality to appropriately deal with the miners. Instead, the well-equipped ZOMO and army troops fired at the protesters with a \\"shoot to kill\\" technique. 21 were wounded, 8 were killed on the spot and 1 died in hospital, with the youngest victim being only 19 years old. The remaining crowd was violently dispersed. The miners repeatedly fought back with their work tools and, in retaliation, wounded dozens of soldiers and militiamen. It was one of the deadliest single incidents during the martial law period. =Gda≈Ñsk, Krak√≥w, Lubin and continuing protests= PZPR headquarters in Gda≈Ñsk (right). ZOMO machine-gunned demonstrators from the rooftop On the same day as Wujek was pacified, a 30,000-strong demonstration was held in the northern port city of Gda≈Ñsk. Clashes with ZOMO continued until 17 December and over 324 individuals were injured. The Militia used firearms and machine guns when the crowd approached the Polish United Workers' Party headquarters in Gda≈Ñsk. A short and presumably cautionary gun salvo from the building's roof hit several people and wounded 4. 1 participant was killed. The southern city of Krak√≥w was also witnessing heavy demonstrations, with thousands marching on the street demanding an end to the martial law and communist rule. On the night of 29-30 April 1982, local miners in Wodzis≈Çaw ≈ölƒÖski planted a bomb and blew up a monument dedicated to Soviet soldiers who liberated Poland from the Nazis in 1945. It was the only incident involving explosives and the caught perpetrators became subsequently known as \\"Bombers from Silesia\\" (Polish: \\"Bombowcy ze ≈ölƒÖska\\"). The operation was a success as the monument was never reconstructed, though the bombers were sentenced and jailed soon after. Other suspects and hundreds of other miners across Silesia were sacked and removed from their job posts, which further weakened the economy. In May 1982, the protests convened by Solidarity were receiving less attention and the struggle against the government was evidently weakening. However, by August, the social unrest again surged. On 31 August 1982, demonstrations took place in around 66 towns and cities, with at least 18 in the southwestern province of Lower Silesia. In Wroc≈Çaw, one of the main centers of Fighting Solidarity, several thousand people for many hours clashed with ZOMO units. One demonstrator was killed by a bullet. The copper-mining town of Lubin also became a hotspot for Solidarity-led rallies. On that day, the gathered people sang the Polish national anthem and chanted slurs and slogans against the communist regime, against the military junta with Jaruzelski as its head and against the Soviets. After approximately 30 minutes, the rally of 2,000 was surrounded by the Militia, armed with AK-47 assault rifles. In response, agitated protesters shouted slurs such as \\"pigs\\", \\"bandits\\", \\"Gestapo\\", \\"murderers\\" and \\"servants of Brezhnev\\". An unsuccessful attempt was made at building a barricade, but the government units were able to pass through and dispersed the first group with tear gas. When the demonstrators regrouped and formed a second wave, ZOMO opened fire and wittingly murdered 2 men. The now infuriated crowd began continuous attacks and the Militia shot several more times, injuring one more man at the back of his head. He died in hospital a few days later. Reinforcements were sent from Legnica and the new deployees were organized into so-called \\"raid groups\\" in Nysa vans. These groups roamed the streets, often attacking casual passers-by. Immediately after the protest was pacified, security forces began the destruction of any evidence to conceal the crime. During the night of 31 August‚Äì1 September, the streets were cleared, with all shells and bullets taken for analysis. On 2 September, authorities ordered the repairs of damaged buildings; broken windows were replaced and traces of bullets on the walls were covered with plaster. The investigation, despite consistent statements made by witnesses of the massacre, was closed. To avoid further escalation, on 14 November, Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa was released from custody in a detention camp. Following his release, no major demonstration took place. =Law, rules and censorship= An intercity travel pass, 1981 A censored telegram, 1982 From the very beginning in December 1981, a strict curfew was imposed from 19:00 (7:00 p.m.) until 6 in the morning. The time of curfew was later adjusted to 22:00 (10:00 p.m.)‚Äì06:00. Night walks or escapades were forbidden and street patrols were commonplace. The WRON Military Council sealed off the country's borders, closed all airports and road access to main cities was restricted. Special permission passes were issued for individuals in extraordinary cases.https://ipn.gov.pl/ftp/13grudnia81/czytelnia/Stan_wojenny_Teka_edukacyjna.pdf Telephone lines were disconnected, mail was subjected to renewed postal censorship, all independent political organizations were criminalized and lessons in schools and universities temporarily suspended. The government imposed a six-day workweek while the mass media, public services, healthcare services, power stations, coal mines, seaports, railway stations, and most key factories were placed under military management, with employees having to follow military orders or face a court martial. As part of the crackdown, media and educational institutions underwent \\"verification\\", a process that tested each employee's attitude towards the regime and to the Solidarity movement; as a result, thousands of journalists, teachers and professors were banned from their professions. Military courts were established to bypass the normal court system, to imprison those spreading \\"false information\\".1981: Martial law, BBC In an attempt to crush resistance, civilian phone lines were routinely tapped and monitored by government agents. =Synopsis= During the initial imposition of martial law, several dozen people were killed.

At the invitation of Jaruzelski, a delegation of the ruling Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party visited Poland between 27 and 29 December. The Hungarians shared with their Polish colleagues their experiences on crushing the \\"counterrevolution\\" of 1956. Earlier in the autumn of 1981, Polish television had broadcast a special film on the 1956 events in Hungary, showing scenes of rebels hanging security officers etc. File:AGAD_Gen._Wojciech_jaruzelski_13_grudnia_1981.pngJaruzelski in a TV studio announcing the introduction of martial law File:Obwieszczenie o wprowadzeniu stanu wojennego (Polska, 1981).pdfThe proclamation of martial law by the State Council File:Stan wojenny w Polsce - 1981-1983 - 12a.JPGUnits of the Citizens' Militia and ZOMO race to disperse crowds of protesters Economic impact Food, alcohol, and cigarettes rationing card Even after martial law was lifted, a number of restrictions remained in place for several years that drastically reduced the civil liberties of the citizenry. It also led to severe economic consequences. The ruling military dictatorship instituted major price rises (dubbed \\"economic reforms\\"), which resulted in a fall in real wages. The resulting economic crisis led to even more rationing of most basic products and materials. As a consequence of the economic hardships and political repressions, an exodus of Poles saw 700,000 migrate to the West between 1981 and 1989. A number of international flights were even hijacked in attempts to flee the country and its economic problems. Between December 1980 and October 1983, 11 Polish flights were hijacked to Berlin Tempelhof Airport alone. Around the same time, a group calling themselves the \\"Polish Revolutionary Home Army\\" seized the Polish Embassy in Bern, Switzerland on 6 September 1982, taking several diplomats as hostages. However, this turned out to be an apparent provocation by the communist Polish secret services aiming to discredit the Solidarity movement. International response Students in Edinburgh, Scotland collecting signatures for a petition in support of Solidarity in 1981 After the \\"Wujek\\" Coal Mine incident in Katowice on 23 December 1981, the United States imposed economic sanctions against the People's Republic of Poland. In 1982 the United States suspended most favored nation trade status until 1987 and vetoed Poland's application for membership in the International Monetary Fund. Pope John Paul II wrote a letter to the Primate of Poland, Stefan Cardinal Wyszynski, in which he called for peace talks between the state and the workers, supporting the Poles' \\"undeniable right to resolve their problems by themselves\\". AftermathRuling of unconstitutionality= After the fall of Communism in Poland in 1989, members of a parliamentary commission determined that martial law had been imposed in clear violation of the country's constitution, which had authorized the executive to declare martial law only between parliamentary sessions (at other times the decision was to be taken by the Sejm). However, the Sejm had been in session at the time when martial law was instituted. In 1992 the Sejm declared the 1981 imposition of martial law to be unlawful and unconstitutional. =Soviet intervention debate= The instigators of the martial law, such as Wojciech Jaruzelski, argue that the army crackdown rescued Poland from a possibly disastrous military intervention of the Soviet Union, East Germany, and other Warsaw Pact countries (similar to the earlier interventions in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968).Jaruzelski says martial law saved Poland, Euronews, 02/10/08 Public figures who supported the introduction of martial law (including some of the right-wing figures like Jƒôdrzej Giertych) would also refer to that threat. In 2009, archive documents hinted that in a conversation Jaruzelski had with Viktor Kulikov, a Soviet military leader, Jaruzelski himself begged for Soviet intervention as his domestic control was deteriorating. Jaruzelski responded by claiming the document was 'just another falsification' and denied all charges.https://www.kyivpost.com/article/content/russia/polands-jaruzelski- denies-he-invited-soviet-army-54694.html Declaration script Led by General of the Army Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Military Council of National Salvation (Wojskowa Rada Ocalenia Narodowego, WRON) usurped for itself powers reserved for wartime, hence the name. The plan was presented to the government of the Soviet Union before the declaration in March 1981. Appearing on Polish television at 6:00 a.m. on 13 December 1981, General Jaruzelski said:The original is available at Konflikty.pl > Today I address myself to you as a soldier and as the head of the Polish > government.

Originally conceived as an uprated F11F Tiger, it soon evolved into a larger and more powerful project. Although two prototypes were ordered in , development was cancelled the same year in favor of the F4H Phantom II before any examples were built. Grumman's next (and last) carrier fighter would be the F-14 Tomcat, ordered in 1968. Design The Grumman Design 118 was a two-seat, twin-engined, rocket augmented, carrier-based all-weather supersonic fighter aircraft. It had a 45¬∞ swept wing, a \\"T-tail\\" empennage, two small folding ventral fins, and a landing gear of tricycle configuration. For ejection, the tandem crew were encapsulated and ejected downwards. It also featured a boundary layer control system to improve low speed handling. The G-118 was to be powered by two J79-GE-3 engines, with accommodations for the more powerful J79-GE-207 engines each producing 18,000 lbf of afterburning thrust. Similar to the contemporary Vought XF8U-3 Crusader III, it was designed with an additional throttleable liquid-fueled rocket engine using a mixture of JP-4 fuel and hydrogen peroxide oxidizer which produced 5,000 lbf of thrust. Armament stores would have been under the fuselage in two semi-recessed hardpoints for the AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile and an internal weapons bay for an additional AIM-7 or three AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles.

Shield The shape of the shield varies from artist to artist. In the official rendering of the coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI the shape chosen is that of a chalice. =Blazon= The blazon (the written description, in terminology peculiar to heraldry, of the contents of the coat of arms) given on the Vatican website is as follows: This means, in non-technical English: Note 1. A mantle outside the shield does not normally contain charges (an heraldic term for objects). Within the shield, as here, it is a religious symbol, and indicates ideals inspired in monastic spirituality. It is also a reference to the Order of Saint Benedict. =Charges= Coat of arms of Joseph Ratzinger, as cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church The charges of the arms -- the Moor's head, Corbinian's bear, and scallop -- appeared on Ratzinger's previous coat of arms, used when he was Archbishop of Munich and Freising. However, they relate not only to his origins, but also to his trust in God, as well his calling to spread this faith to others. Scallop shell The symbolism of the scallop shell is multiple. Saint Augustine is said to have been walking along the seashore, meditating on the unfathomable mystery of the Holy Trinity. A boy was using a shell to pour sea water into a little hole. When Augustine asked him what he was doing, he replied, \\"I am emptying the sea into this hole.\\" Thus did Augustine understand that man would never penetrate to the depths of the mystery of God. While a doctoral candidate in 1953, Fr. Joseph Ratzinger wrote his dissertation on The People of God and the House of God in Augustine's Teaching is always about the Church, and the shell therefore has a personal connection with the thought of this great Doctor of the Church. The scallop shell is also an allusion to the Sacrament of Holy Baptism. In the Roman Catholic Church, a sea shell is often used to pour water over the head of the child being baptized. Thus, a sea shell is used to evoke the imagery of this rite which is fundamental to the Christian life. The shell also stands for pilgrimage. When topped with a scallop shell a pilgrim's staff, or \\"Jacob's staff\\", is the sign of a pilgrim. In Church art it is a symbol of the apostle Saint James the Great, and his sanctuary at Santiago de Compostela in Spain, perhaps the principal place of pilgrimage during the Middle Ages. This symbol also alludes to \\"the pilgrim people of God\\", a title for the Church which Joseph Ratzinger championed at the Second Vatican Council as peritus (theological adviser) to Cardinals Josef Frings of Cologne and Julius D√∂pfner of Munich-Freising (his episcopal predecessor). When he became Archbishop he took the shell in his coat of arms. It is also found in the insignia of the Schottenkloster in Regensburg, where the major seminary of that diocese is located, a place where Benedict taught as a professor of theology. Finally, the pilgrimage symbolism of the shell may also refer both to the reconfigured role of the pope as not only ruler, but also pilgrim among the peoples and nations of the world. Pope Paul VI--who created Joseph Ratzinger as a cardinal in 1977--was often called the \\"Pilgrim Pope\\" for his ground-breaking travels to the Holy Land, India, the United States, Colombia, the Philippines, and elsewhere. This precedent was greatly elaborated upon by Pope John Paul II with his historic trips, numbering over a hundred. As a result, Benedict may be paying homage to these men and the new role for the papacy. Moor of Freising Moor's head of Freising, from the coat of arms of the Prince- Bishopric of Freising. The Moor's head is a heraldic charge associated with W√∂rth, Upper Bavaria, Germany. The origin of the Moor's head in Freising is not entirely known. It typically faces to the heraldic right, the viewer's left (dexter in heraldic terms) and is depicted in natural brown colour caput Aethiopum (literally \\"Ethiopian head\\") with red lips, crown and collar. This is the ancient emblem of the Diocese of Freising, founded in the 8th century, which became a metropolitan archdiocese with the name of in 1818, subsequent to the Concordat between Pius VII and King Maximilian Joseph of Bavaria (5 June 1817). The Moor's head is fairly common in European heraldry. It still appears today in the arms of Sardinia and Corsica, as well as in the blazons of various noble families. Italian heraldry, however, usually depicts the Moor wearing a white band around his head instead of a crown, indicating a slave who has been freed; whereas in German heraldry the Moor is shown wearing a crown. The Moor's head is common in the Bavarian tradition and is known as the caput Ethiopicum or the Moor of Freising. Corbinian's bear A legend states that while traveling to Rome, Saint Corbinian's pack horse was killed by a bear. He commanded the bear to carry the load. Once he arrived, he released it from his service, and it returned to Bavaria. The implication is that \\"Christianity tamed and domesticated the ferocity of paganism and thus laid the foundations for a great civilization in the Duchy of Bavaria.\\" At the same time, Corbinian's bear, as God's beast of burden, symbolizes the weight of office that Benedict carried. External ornaments The coat of arms of the Holy See. Banner of the Swiss Guard, with the coat-of-arms of Pope Benedict XVI modified to include the papal tiara. Traditionally, a pope's coat of arms was externally adorned only by the three-tiered papal tiara with lappets and the crossed keys of Saint Peter with a cord. No other objects nor a motto was added. The tiara represented the roles of authority of the pope, while the keys represent the power to loose and bind on heaven and earth (). Pope Benedict's arms maintain the keys, but replace the tiara with a mitre and add a pallium. However, the tiara and keys remain the symbol of the papacy, and appear on the coat of arms of the Holy See and (reversed) on the flag of Vatican City. =Mitre= In Pope Benedict's arms, the tiara is replaced with a silver mitre with three gold stripes. These stripes recall the three crowns of the tiara, which came to represent the three powers of the Bishop of Rome: Orders, Jurisdiction and Magisterium. The stripes preserve that meaning and are joined at the centre to show their unity in the same person. Coincidentally, the three stripes and the vertical stripe in the center of the mitre also forms the Chinese character for ‚Äúsovereign‚Äù (Áéã). =Pallium= The pallium with red crosses is also a new addition. It represents a bishop's role of being pastor of the flock entrusted to him by Christ. The form of the pallium included in the coat of arms recalls that used by metropolitan archbishops (but with black crosses) rather than the much larger pallium worn by Pope Benedict at his inauguration. After papal abdication After Benedict resigned as pope in 2013 and assumed the role of pope emeritus, Cardinal Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo, who designed the coat of arms in 2005, said that Benedict XVI needed a new coat of arms now that he was no longer the pontiff. Montezemolo drew up a proposal for a new coat of arms (which was not officially adopted), which Montezemolo believed could be used now by the former pontiff. Montezemolo's proposal moved the big keys of Saint Peter from the back of the coat of arms to the top part of the shield and made them much smaller.

NH 102 runs southwest to northeast between Hudson and Raymond, but is signed as an east-west route. Some confusion exists over the western terminus. The state route logs show that the end of the road is at the junction with Ferry Street (New Hampshire Route 111) in Hudson, and the end of NH 102 is marked at that intersection westbound. However, local signage further west along NH 111 shows NH 102 continuing along NH 111 as a concurrency over the Hudson Bridge into Nashua. Signage on the bridge indicates NH 102 sharing East Hollis Street with NH 111. The eastern terminus of NH 102 is in Raymond at New Hampshire Route 107, a short distance south of New Hampshire Route 101. While older exit signs on NH 101 indicated 102 at the exit, the road officially ends at NH 107, and recently-replaced signage on NH 101 now reads \\"TO NH 102.\\" Route description The route starts in Hudson at Route 111 (Ferry Street) and Route 3A (Chase Street). This starts a concurrency with Route 3A. The southern part of this concurrency forms one of the main commercial districts in Hudson, known as Derry Street. At Elm Avenue, 3A leaves the concurrency heading west, while 102 continues in a more northeasterly direction along Derry Road. After passing Alvirne High School, NH 102 passes through the extreme southeastern corner of Litchfield before returning to Hudson. After leaving Hudson a second time, it enters Londonderry as Nashua Road, passing through a rural area near several farms and apple orchards. A small commercial district surrounds the intersection with New Hampshire Route 128/Mammoth Road, and another more developed commercial district lies just to the west of 102's interchange with I-93. Immediately after the interchange with I-93, Route 102 enters Derry as Broadway, the main commercial thoroughfare in town. After the intersection with Crystal Avenue (New Hampshire Route 28) at the center of town, it passes the Hoodkroft golf course and meets Main Street (New Hampshire Route 28 Bypass) at a traffic circle at the community of Derry Village. After the traffic circle, the route continues northwest along Chester Road, passing the Beaver Lake recreational area, and winding through the rural eastern portion of the town of Derry before entering the town of Chester, forming the main north-south route through the town. At the town center of Chester, NH 102 intersects New Hampshire Route 121, following Derry Road south of the intersection, and Raymond Road north of the intersection. Following a more northeasterly route, it winds through a rural area in southeastern Raymond before reaching its eastern terminus at New Hampshire Route 107, about short of the interchange with the New Hampshire Route 101 freeway.

It is preserved as a Maine state historic site and was included as part of the Damariscotta Oyster Shell Heaps listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. Other shell middens are located on the estuary in both Damariscotta and Newcastle. The middens in this area were formed over about 1,000 years between 200 BC to AD 1000\\\\. The midden originally had three main layers of shells. In the bottom two layers, individual shells were generally long. These two layers are separated by a layer of soil, and the middle layer is mixed with animal bones. The top layer contains smaller shells. Artifacts unearthed lead scientists to believe that successive tribes of prehistoric people used the area. The top layer was deposited by members of the Abenaki tribes that fished in the area in the summer. Originally, the Whaleback midden was more than thirty feet deep, more than 1,650 feet in length, and a width varying from 1,320 to 1,650 feet. It got its name from its shape. Only a small portion of this midden remains today as much of it was processed into chicken feed from 1886 to 1891 by the Massachusetts-based Damariscotta Shell and Fertilizer company, eroded by rising sea levels, or looted. Because of this, the Glidden midden, located across the river in Newcastle, is now the largest in Maine and the largest on the U.S. east coast north of Georgia.  Climate and Culture  Early people in Maine were significantly influenced by a changing climate around them, a climate that was largely shaped by glacial processes. Before the shell midden was created, the Late Wisconsinan Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) covered Maine's landscape 35,000 years ago, extending far into the oceanBraun, Duane D. Guide to the geology of Mount Desert Island and Acadia National Park. Braun, Ruth (Geology instructor). Berkeley, California. . OCLC 922836428..

Jr.; Kaplan, Michael R.; Kreutz, Karl J.; Lowell, Thomas V.; Thompson, Woodrow B.; and Weddle, Thomas K., \\"The Deglaciation of Maine, USA\\" (2004). Earth Science Faculty Scholarship. 276.. Due to isostatic rebound, a geological process in which the earth ‚Äúrebounds‚Äù from the depression of a glacier, sea levels fluctuated immensely.

Eagle Hill Institute., the Archaic Period of human culture was taking place from about 3,500 to 9,000 years ago, characterized by cultures who started to exploit marine resources. There is much speculation about the transhumance of these early peoples ‚Äì some hypotheses posit that settlement occupation would cause populations of people to live inland during the summer and by the coast during the winterSanger, David. (1996) ‚ÄúTesting the Models: Hunter-Gatherer Use of Space in the Gulf of Maine, USA‚Äù. World Archaeology, 27(3). Taylor & Francis, Ltd. . However, there is not much archaeological evidence to suggest this, and it‚Äôs more likely that there were ethnic boundaries between groups of people and that transhumance was not occurring, meaning that populations were staying coastal or inland year-round. The Damariscotta River had been used by humans as early as 5,000 years ago based on archaeological evidence of midden sites along the banks. At the time that the Whaleback shell midden was most heavily populated, it could have been sustaining year-round populations of people. This leads into the question of why the site was occupied so much later than other portions of the river, a question which can be answered by looking at the regional-level geology and sea-level rise.  Geology of Damariscotta  The Damariscotta middens are notable for their size and the large presence of oysters in the midden, despite there being incredibly low current populations of oysters. The large presence is connected to coastal change, sea-level rise, and the geology of the regionSanger, David, 1936- (1985). Sea-level rise and archaeology in the Damariscotta River. Maine Geological Survey, Dept. of Conservation. OCLC 26127580.. The midden is located between two sills, Johnny Orr and Indraft. These sills, volcanic in origin and most likely millions of years old, have influenced the salinity and temperature of the river. In fact, on the oceanside of the Johnny Orr sill, the level of the water at high tide is higher than the level on the riverside. The Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) makes up a large portion of the shells located in the middensSanger, David, and Douglas C. Kellogg.

However, oysters are not present in significant populations in the river todayWeddle, Tom. ‚ÄúSea-Level Rise and the Damariscotta River Oyster Shell Middens‚Äù Maine Geological Survey. 2011.. This has led geologists to the understanding that at some point in time, there was a great deal of change occurring on the banks of the Damariscotta River that influenced the creation of such substantial middens. Oysters tend to like warmer, brackish waters ‚Äì at some point in time, salty, cold oceanic water breached the Johnny Orr sill, mixed with warmer, less salty riverine water and created an environment that could sustain oyster populations about 2400 B.P. . The water may have overtaken the sill as sea levels were slowly rising. The reason for the water coming over the sill still remains a gap in the story of the Damariscotta River. Though oysters do still exist buried underneath silt near the middens, significant oyster populations no longer exist within the river due to four possible reasons: 1) predator introduction, 2) suffocation from the dust of the sawmill upshore, 3) increasingly saline environments, and 4) lower water temperatures. In all likelihood, it was probably a combination of all of these factors. Damariscotta is just another example of how changes in the climate have influenced human realities.  Threats to middens  Over 2,000 other middens exist along the Maine coast but many of their locations are undisclosed due to fear of looting. Unfortunately, looting is not the only threat they face. As sea levels rise due to climate change, middens like Whaleback have been swept away to the ocean. The need to study these valuable coastal cultural resources is now as dire as ever. The thousands of other middens can offer equally compelling evidence of early-Maine habitation, geology, biology, and many more important disciplines. For example, one midden site has helped scientists piece together that at one point, there was a great deal of swordfish being caught within the Gulf of Maine despite being a deep- sea fish that could prove difficult to catch with dugouts\\"Turner Farm Midden Analysis\\". https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bbm%3A978-0-585-27574-1%2F1.pdf. This challenges our understanding of early maritime technology. Though the need to conduct studies on these studies should be done, it is important to note that they should be carried out with the approval of the landowner on whose property the middens are located, as well as with the associated tribes. To start the process of either studying a shell midden or formally recognizing a midden, interested parties can become involved in the University of Maine ‚ÄòMidden Minders‚Äô project which seeks to catalog the various sites along the coast and document the impact of shoreline change. State historic site The area around the remains of the Whaleback is a Maine state historic site, first opened for a full season in 2005, with some historical displays and a hiking trail. Oyster culturing By 1875 oysters that were once abundant were no longer native to New England waters. Wild populations have been established in recent years by the spawn of aquaculture oysters.

Their gimmick was that of anti-social punks who specialized in hardcore wrestling and brawling. They were noted for their distinctive all-black \\"street look\\", which, while very commonplace among today's wrestlers, was vastly different from the colorful attire of their wrestling peers of the late 1980s and early 1990s. This included graffiti-sprayed T-shirts, chain-adorned leather trenchcoats, and their distinctive mullet-hawk haircuts. CareerAmerican Wrestling Association and Florida Championship Wrestling (1985‚Äì1988)= Jerry \\"Biff\\" Sags and Brian \\"Buff\\" Knobbs were childhood friends (both hailing from Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania) who put themselves together (whereas most tag teams were and still are matched by bookers). They began their careers in the American Wrestling Association in 1985 and began teaming together as The Nasty Boyz in 1986. They first started moving up the cards while in Memphis, as a heel team against the face team of the Midnight Rockers. In 1988, they moved to Florida Championship Wrestling, where they won five Tag Team Championships between 1989 and 1990. While they were in Memphis, Jerry Lawler gave them the idea to change their look (spandex gold tights and long boots), so Sags and Knobbs decided to cover their bodies. They also painted their faces, but they dropped the face paint when wrestling outside of Memphis. =World Championship Wrestling (1990)= In 1990, the Nasty Boys joined World Championship Wrestling (WCW). They initially feuded with The Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott), but were unable to defeat them for the United States Tag Team Championship. =World Wrestling Federation (1990‚Äì1993)= The Nasty Boys left WCW in December 1990 and joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), debuting on the December 29 episode of Superstars of Wrestling. Along with their manager Jimmy Hart, they announced their intention to \\"Nastisize the WWF\\". After becoming the number one contenders by winning a seven team battle royal on the February 16, 1991 airing of Superstars of Wrestling (last eliminating the Legion of Doom, thanks to interference from Power and Glory), they defeated The Hart Foundation for the WWF World Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania VII. They held the titles until SummerSlam 1991, when they were defeated by the Legion of Doom in a no disqualification, no countout match. They then feuded with The Rockers and The Bushwhackers, leading to a match at Survivor Series '91 where they teamed with The Beverly Brothers to defeat both teams. In the early part of 1992, The Nasty Boys had a feud with Hacksaw Jim Duggan and Sgt. Slaughter, culminating in an eight-man tag team match at WrestleMania VIII, where Duggan, Slaughter, Big Boss Man and Virgil defeated The Nasty Boys, The Mountie and Repo Man. That fall, they turned face and dumped Jimmy Hart as their manager after Hart overlooked them for a tag team title match against The Natural Disasters, instead giving the title shot to his other tag team of Money Inc. Knobbs and Sags teamed with The Natural Disasters to defeat Money Inc. and The Beverly Brothers at Survivor Series '92, but they were unable to regain the titles. On the March 13th, 1993 edition of WWF Superstars it was announced that the Nasty Boys had agreed to step aside and allow Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake to have a one-time title shot against Money Inc. at WrestleMania IX. They then entered a house show series against The Headshrinkers and wrestled to double disqualifications on multiple occasions. Their feud spilled onto WWF television, as they wrestled once more to a double DQ against Fatu & Samu on the Italian version of WWF superstars that saw both teams hitting each other with chairs in a post match brawl.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/93.htm In April 1993, after a European tour, they were suspended, and later fired from the company. Their final television appearance came on May 16, 1993 when they defeated Steve Vega & Barry Horowitz on WWF Superstars. =Return to WCW (1993‚Äì1997)= The Nasty Boys returned to WCW in July 1993 as heels managed by Missy Hyatt. They defeated Arn Anderson and Paul Roma at Fall Brawl 1993 to become WCW World Tag Team Champions. They would then lose the championship on October 4, to Marcus Alexander Bagwell and 2 Cold Scorpio before regaining it on October 24. In 1994, they fought Cactus Jack and Maxx Payne in a series of wild brawls. They were supposed to feud with Kevin Sullivan and his (kayfabe) dyslexic brother Dave, who called himself Evad (\\"Dave\\" backwards). Evad, however, injured his knee, and Sullivan convinced Cactus Jack to team with him. The Nasties lost the title to the thrown-together team of Jack and Sullivan in a wild Philly Street Fight at Slamboree 1994. Knobbs and Sags went on to feud with tag teams such as Harlem Heat and The Blue Bloods. At Slamboree 1995, they defeated Harlem Heat to become three-time WCW Tag Team Champions, but dropped the title back to them soon after. In 1996, the New World Order offered them membership into the nWo, but attacked them as soon as they received their nWo T-shirts. In the subsequent match against Scott Hall and Kevin Nash, Sags became enraged during the contest after being struck on the head. He had thought Hall had struck him with a chair and retaliated by attacking him and knocking his tooth out. After the match, Sags filed a lawsuit. He later saw footage and found out it was Nash that had hit him with a tag belt. He was released from his contract in early 1997 and retired. After Sags left the company, Knobbs continued as a singles wrestler and began pursuing the WCW Hardcore Championship. =Independent Circuit= The Nasty Boys during the Hulkamania Tour in 2009 The Nasty Boys were briefly reunited in the short-lived XWF and the World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico. Since retirement the boys have both appeared on Hogan Knows Best and the WWE Magazine's \\"Where are they now?\\" section. On November 20, 2007, Brian Knobbs and Jerry Sags reformed at the WWE SmackDown tapings from Tampa, Florida to wrestle their first WWE match in 14 years. On November 21, 2009, they were involved with the Hulkamania: Let The Battle Begin Australian Tour event in Melbourne, Australia and wrestled and defeated Reno Anoa'i and Vampire Warrior in an Australian Street Fight. =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2010)= On January 4, 2010, The Nasty Boys made their debut appearance on Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's television show, TNA Impact!, where they trashed Team 3D's locker room during their absence from the show while in Japan. This initiated a feud, with both teams exchanging physical onslaughts with one another. on the January 14 episode of Impact!, Team 3D returned but were attacked by The Nasty Boys. On the January 21 episode of Impact! the Nasty Boys competed in their first match for TNA, defeating the team of Eric Young and Kevin Nash. On the January 28 episode of Impact! the Nasty Boys and Team 3D got into an intense confrontation to hype their upcoming match. on the February 4 episode of Impact! the Nasty Boys attacked Team 3D after a match until Hernandez and Matt Morgan made the save. At Against All Odds The Nasty Boys defeated Team 3D in a tag team match, when Jimmy Hart made his return to the company and interfered in the match on the Nasty Boys' behalf. On the February 25 edition of Impact! Team 3D defeated the Nasty Boys in a tables match, when Jesse Neal interfered on Team 3D's behalf. The Nasty Boys and Hart continued their feud with Team 3D on the March 15 episode of Impact! by defeating them and the returning Brother Runt, a replacement for Jesse Neal, whom the Nastys attacked prior to the match, in a six-man tag team match. After the match Neal attacked the Nastys and helped Team 3D put Sags through a table. On March 29, 2010, news broke that the Nasty Boys had been released by TNA following an incident at a TNA function with Spike executives present. =Reputation= The Nasty Boys performing their entrance The Nasty Boys have a reputation of being very stiff with their opponents. They have also been involved in ribbing (pranking backstage) other wrestlers and also in several legitimate fights.

Inspired by the huge success of the Japanese tokusatsu franchises such as Ultraman and Kamen Rider in Hong Kong, this film features the same type of \\"henshin\\"/transformation, monster/robot action and costumed heroics, coupled with Chinese kung fu action. Plot In 2015, Demon Princess Elzebub (also translated as Princess Dragon Mom) awakens from 10 million years of dormancy and plots to conquer the Earth. She destroys a few major cities in China to prove her power to humanity, who react in shock. Returning to her lair in Inner-Earth, she awakens her army of Skeleton Ghosts and various mutant humanoids to wreak havoc on the surface. The head of the Science Headquarters, Professor Liu Ying-de, has completed the BDX Project, a potential countermeasure against Elzebub. In the HQ's secret laboratory, he transforms Lei Ma, a high-ranking SH officer, into the bionic kung fu superhero Inframan. The solar-powered red & silver armored Inframan has both enhanced strength and combat weapons. Once Inframan destroys the princess's various monsters, she decides to steal the professor's blueprints of Inframan in hope of discovering his weakness. Meanwhile, the professor introduces Thunderball Fists, gloves capable of destroying any substance known to man, as well as covering up Inframan's weakness. The princess decides to coerce the professor. Capturing the professor's daughter, the princess blackmails the professor into creating an Inframan for her. The professor agrees to go to Mount Devil for a meeting. When the professor refuses to make another Inframan, he and his daughter are frozen. Inframan and the Science Patrol decide to rescue both which leads to the climatic battle between Inframan and Demon Princess Elzebub. Powers of Inframan Lei Ma throws his arms into a Kamen Rider-like \\"henshin\\"/transforming pose, and says: *\\"Change! Inframan!\\" (ËÆäÔºÅË∂Ö‰∫∫) (Mandarin: \\"Bian!

Production  The film was directed by Hua Shan, written by science fiction writer Ni Kuang, produced by Runme Shaw and the cinematography was by Tadashi Nishimoto. There was also assistance from Japan; music from Ultra Seven (1967) and Mirrorman (1971) (both composed by Toru Fuyuki) is used in this film and the Inframan/Science Headquarters/monster costumes were provided by Ekisu Productions, which had done costumes for many Toei superhero TV shows of the same period. The film also starred Danny Lee as the superhero himself, and Bruceploitation star Bruce Le in a supporting role (he still got to display some of his martial arts skills in many scenes of the film). The following year, Joseph Brenner brought this film to the U.S., and re-titled it simply Infra-Man (or Inframan), with the advertising campaign slogan \\"The Man Beyond Bionics!\\" attempting to capitalize upon The Six Million Dollar Man's success on American network television at the time. This film also has some historical importance as the first superhero film set in Hong Kong, the first film promotion in Hong Kong using a hot air balloon, and the first Shaw Brothers production using a storyboard. In 2004, the film was released on DVD in Japan and Hong Kong. Reception Roger Ebert, on his 7 March 1976 review for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film two and a half stars out of four, concluding \\"The movie even looks good: It's a classy, slick production by the Shaw Brothers, the Hong Kong kung fu kings. When they stop making movies like Infra-Man, a little light will go out of the world.\\" On 30 April 1999, after Quentin Tarantino re-released Mighty Peking Man in North America, Ebert upgraded his rating for the film to three stars, explaining that \\"I find to my astonishment that I gave Infra-Man only two and a half stars when I reviewed it. That was 22 years ago, but a fellow will remember a lot of things you wouldn't think he'd remember. I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that film. I am awarding Mighty Peking Man three stars, for general goofiness and a certain level of insane genius, but I cannot in good conscience rate it higher than Infra-Man. So, in answer to those correspondents who ask if I have ever changed a rating on a movie: Yes, Infra- Man moves up to three stars.\\" The original review of the film as re-posted on Ebert's website accordingly gives the film three stars. Versions The film was released on VHS under both Prism Entertainment and Goodtimes Entertainment. In the Goodtimes Home Video version of the American opening credits, an additional section was added in between the title and the cast and crew from the Prism version, giving the film the subtitle \\"Battles The Sci-Fi Monsters\\" in an attempt to appeal more to fans of that titular genre. In this additional but misleading sequence, short snippets from the film are used to introduce and inaccurately name the villains of the film, with some villain characters cut out entirely. Influence Elements from the film influenced the 2017 revival of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Producer Joel Hodgson explained in an interview that Princess Dragon Mom was one of the influences for the mad scientist Kinga Forrester and that the skeleton-like Henchmen influenced the boneheads, including The Skeleton Crew Band.

It is the centerpiece of the Fort Edgecomb State Historic Site. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969, with its boundaries increased to create a historic district in 1991. Description Fort Edgecomb is located on Davis Island, actually a peninsula jutting into the Sheepscot River across from the village center of Wiscasset. Davis Island is separated from the mainland by a short neck, and Fort Edgecomb is located at the island's southern end. Its most prominent feature is an eight-sided blockhouse, whose second floor is larger than its first, measuring compared to . The ground floor walls have loopholes through which muskets could be fired, while the upper level had portholes for firing cannons. Although the blockhouse is the most visible feature, the fort's main armament was a water battery to defend the river. This battery originally had five cannons, including a 50-pounder columbiad and four 18-pounder smoothbore cannons. Each cannon was in its own bastion, with the bastions arranged in three tiers. The blockhouse also had two carronades, which were a relatively short cannon of large bore. History The fort was built as part of the second system of US fortifications, guarding the then- important port of Wiscasset, then one of the largest shipbuilding centers in New England. A war scare with the British over US trade with France during the Napoleonic Wars sparked the building of these forts, along with Thomas Jefferson's Embargo Act of 1807, which closed US ports and vessels to foreign trade. The fort's construction was supervised by US Army engineer Moses Porter, later commander of the Regiment of Light Artillery. Although the fort was built for defense, its first use (as with most of Maine's second system forts) was to enforce the embargo. This embargo was not popular with Maine's merchants, and it is said that one of two times Fort Edgecomb's cannon were fired was in salute at James Madison's inauguration on 4 March 1809 (or, less tactfully, to celebrate his lifting of Jefferson's embargo). Eventually the War of 1812 broke out. The cannons were also fired on 14 February 1815, when word was received of peace with the British. During the War of 1812, this post saw considerable activity, holding British prisoners of war, many of them brought to Wiscasset harbor by American privateers. In 1814, Fort Edgecomb became an important base in defending against a possible British attack on mid-coast Maine. It remained manned until 1818, and was reactivated during the Civil War. The Friends of Fort Edgecomb celebrated its bicentennial on 13 June 2009, on the grounds of the fort.

It is sometimes confused with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder, and some overlap with these disorders seems to exist. Nonverbal learning disorder has never been included in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases. Presentation  Considered to be neurologically based, nonverbal learning disorder is characterized by verbal strengths as well as visual-spatial, motor, and social skills difficulties. People with this disorder may not at times comprehend nonverbal cues such as facial expression or tone of voice. Challenges with mathematics and handwriting are common. =Associated conditions= Labels for specific associated issues include visual-spatial deficit, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, as well as dyspraxia. Diagnosis The DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) and ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases) do not include NLD as a diagnosis.Horn, Nnifer L., PhD, HSPP. \\"An Overview of Learning Disabilities.\\" http://beaconindiana.com/pdfs/OverviewOfLDs.pdf San Mateo, CA: Schwab Learning, 2002. N. pag. Web. Assorted diagnoses have been discussed as sharing symptoms with NLD‚Äîthese conditions include Right hemisphere brain damage and Developmental Right Hemisphere Syndrome, Developmental Coordination Disorder, Social-Emotional Processing Disorder, autism spectrum disorders, Gerstmann syndrome and others. In their 1967 book Learning Disabilities; Educational Principles and Practices, Doris J. Johnson and Helmer R. Myklebust characterize how someone with these kinds of disabilities appears in a classroom: \\"An example is the child who fails to learn the meaning of the actions of others....We categorize this child as having a deficiency in social perception, meaning that he has an inability which precludes acquiring the significance of basic nonverbal aspects of daily living, though his verbal level of intelligence falls within or above the average.\\" (p. 272).Learning disabilities; educational principles and practices by Doris J.

Later neuropsychologist Byron Rourke sought to develop consistent criteria with a theory and model of brain functioning that would establish NLD as a distinct syndrome (1989). Questions remain about how best to frame the perceptual, cognitive and motor issues associated with NLD.

The external configuration of the aircraft was to be very similar to that of the P-3. Development had not progressed very much before the program was cancelled in July 1990. Development In the mid-1980s, the U.S. Navy made plans to replace the large number of Lockheed P-3 aircraft which would reach the end of their useful service lives during the 1990s. To limit costs the U.S. Navy envisioned a modified P-3 with increased payload and updated avionics. This aircraft became known as the \\"P-3G\\" of which 125 should be procured over a period of five years up to 2001. However, the U.S. Navy was unwilling to select Lockheed's P-3G without any competition and issued the final \\"Request for Proposals (RFP)\\" in January 1987. For the airplane named the P-7A \\"LRAACA\\" (Long-Range Air ASW-Capable Aircraft), Lockheed's competitors were: * Boeing - proposal using a modified 757 * McDonnell Douglas - proposal using a modified MD-90 In October 1988, the U.S. Navy announced that Lockheed won the competition, as the company's proposal was significantly cheaper than that of the competitors. The U.S. Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) recommended a full- scale development of the LRAACA on 4 January 1989. The costs were planned to be about $600 million, with a maximum cost limit of $750 million. However, in November 1989, Lockheed announced a cost overrun of $300 million due to the tight schedule and design problems. On 20 July 1990, the U.S. Navy stopped the P-7A program contract for default, \\"citing Lockheed's inability to make adequate progress toward completion of all contract phases\\". The program was finally cancelled by the DAB in late 1990. Design The P-7 was designed as an enlarged version of the original P-3C. The fuselage, of similar cross- section to that of the P-3, was lengthened by 2.40 m (8 ft), and the wingspan by 2.10 m (7 ft). The wing center section was increased in length, which moved the engines farther away from the fuselage to reduce noise levels in the cabin. The tailplane was increased by about 25% in area, but shortened in height compared to that of the P-3. The P-7A was to be powered by four General Electric T407-GE-400 turboprops with 5-blade propellers. Initial plans included the Update IV electronics equipment of the P-3C. The cockpit was to be fitted with eight CRT displays and a stowable HUD for weapons delivery. Other equipment included search radar, MAD, decoy flare launchers, electro- optical detector, radar warning receivers, IR suppression on the engine exhausts and laser deflection screens on the windows. The primary submarine detection sensor was to be the sonobuoy, of which 112 were carried internally; 38 more could be stowed for in flight reloading. Another 150 could be carried in 10 underwing pods. The design had an internal bomb bay for a maximum of 3,400 kg of weapons and 12 underwing pylons.Bowers, Peter M.

The Jewellery Quarter is Europe's largest concentration of businesses involved in the jewellery trade, which produces 40% of all the jewellery made in the UK. It is also home to the world's largest Assay Office, which hallmarks around 12 million items a year. Historically the Jewellery Quarter has been the birthplace of many pioneering advancements in industrial technology. At its peak in the early 1900s the Jewellery Quarter employed over 30,000 people, however due to foreign competition and lack of demand, the industry declined throughout the 20th century. The area is now being transformed into an urban village and hub for creative businesses, whilst maintaining its urban fabric. Its historical importance has led to numerous conservation schemes and it is an Anchor Point of the European Route of Industrial Heritage. HistoryOrigins= St Paul's Church in St Paul's Square was completed in 1779, although the spire was added in 1823. A survey of 1553 named one of the first goldsmiths of Birmingham, Roger Pemberton. During the 18th and 19th centuries, Birmingham prospered from the Industrial Revolution and developed into a large industrial town, manufacturing a vast range of products, often from various metals. Many large foundries and glassworks attracted workers from all areas of Britain. A considerable trade developed in the manufacture of gilt buttons, cap badges, pins and small metal toys. According to the Birmingham Directory of 1780, there were 26 jewellers at the time. Because the definition of a jeweller was not explained in the directory, it is thought that it may contain many irregularities and the number of actual jewellers may be lower. It is thought that by the start of the 19th century, there were around 12 jewellery manufacturing companies, employing approximately 400 people. In 1746, the Colmore family released land on what is known as the Jewellery Quarter today to help satisfy the demands of an increasing population. The largest tract of land was Newhall which had been purchased from the Manor of Birmingham by William Colmore. In 1560, it was described as a rabbit warren and by 1620, New Hall Manor had been constructed on the site. The large manor house gave its name to the area. By 1746, the Colmore family had moved out and let the manor to tenants. Beyond this, there were enclosed fields leading to Birmingham Heath. Sandpits were located on Hockley Hill and the product of these pits was used for moulds which were used in the local metal casting industry. The area was crossed by three roads. The road from Wednesbury and Wolverhampton, which now consists of Constitution Hill, Great Hampton Street and Hockley Hill, was turnpiked in 1727. This was followed by the turnpiking of the road to Dudley, consisting of Summer Row, Parade and Summer Hill Road, in 1760 when Summer Row was cut to provide a better route into the town. Both roads were heavily used by traders and carriages transporting raw materials from Staffordshire into Birmingham. The completion of the Birmingham Canal in 1769 led to the improvement of these roads. Warstone Lane, now Warstone Lane, Hall Street and part of Icknield Street, connected the Wolverhampton road to the Dudley road. Ladywood Road, which is now Ladywood Middleway, was also connected to the area as a result of Warstone Lane. The demand for houses declined briefly in the 1750s and began to increase again in 1759. Additional streets were laid out between Colmore Row and the Great Charles Street Queensway area in the 1760s. The plots in the Great Charles Street area were first let in 1760. Demand for the land was further stimulated by the completion of the Newhall Branch Canal in 1772 and by the end of the 1770s, almost all of the Great Charles Street and Lionel Street area had been built up. Construction of houses continued up into the area now known as the Jewellery Quarter and it became a wealthy residential area consisting of upmarket Georgian houses. It was particularly stimulated by the donation of of land by Charles Colmore for the construction of a church. Construction of St Paul's Church, designed by Roger Eykyn, and the surrounding St Paul's Square commenced in 1777 and was completed in 1779. Georgian houses aimed at the prosperous middle class were constructed around the square, some of which survive such as Nos 12‚Äì14, which are Grade II listed, on the eastern side of the square. A plan of Birmingham by Thomas Hanson in 1778 shows that most of the Newhall estate had been laid out in a grid-like pattern from St Paul's Church. The plan also showed that two pools, Great and Little Pool, had been filled in and the brook that fed them had been canalised. However, New Hall still blocked further development down Newhall Street. In the early 1770s, Matthew Boulton had been using the premises partially as a warehouse and when plans for its demolition were aired, he resisted them. However, the house was demolished in 1787 with only the barn left standing until Boulton's new warehouse was completed on Livery Street in 1788. Map showing the extent of the Jewellery Quarter Such villas that were constructed in the area in the late 18th century included Regent's Place, built in the 1770s. This was leased by Matthew Boulton to James Watt and appears to be the earliest villa in the area. Watt stayed there from 1775 till 1790, before moving to Heathfield House in Handsworth. Key Hill House was constructed in the 1780s on Key Hill for Joshua Glover, a local merchant. In 1784, Sir Thomas Gooch leased out an estate on the northern side of Warstone Lane. Forrest's Brewery and two semi- detached houses were constructed on the plot. These houses were occupied by the owners of the brewery. On land owned by Samuel Lloyd and Edward Harford on the northeast side of Great Hampton Street, houses were constructed from the late 1780s. The land had been owned by Richard Parkes, an ironmaster from Wednesbury, from 1713 until it was passed to Lloyd and Harford. In 1750, Henry Carver purchased land on Summer Hill and in 1790 construction of a terrace of 15 houses commenced. Despite the residential composition of the area, manufacturing businesses were starting to establish a presence there. The growth of industry into this area was aided by the establishment of the Birmingham Assay Office in 1773, which was petitioned for by Boulton and other industrialists. The Birmingham and Fazeley Canal was constructed through the south of the area and was completed in 1789, providing a better form of transportation for goods manufactured in the area and the delivery of materials to the area. Upon the completion of the canal, Newhall Street was extended towards it. As the middle classes moved out the area, large factories and workshops were constructed in their place for the goldsmiths and silversmiths. The main gold products being produced at the time were keys, seals and watch chains whilst silversmiths manufactured buckles and comb ornaments using imitation stones. Despite buckles going out of fashion in society, the industry prospered. Jewellery was produced mainly in small workshops, contrasting with the large factories and mills that were constructed in England at the time. The Colmore family realised the potential that came about as a result of the construction of the canals and in 1809, Caroline Colmore had a canal arm constructed from the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal to a basin off George Street to promote industrial development in the area. This was known as Miss Colmore's Canal, although was later named Whitmore's Arm. The number of jewellers in the area reduced significantly in the 1820s as a result of economic problems in the 1820s and many jewellers were made redundant as firms decreased in size to survive. The effects were felt for the following ten years and Hockley only developed as a distinct \\"quarter\\" at the centre of the city's jewellery industry after the mid-1830s. =Growth= Residential properties overlooking St Paul's Square that were converted into workshops in the 1850s. The Jewellery Quarter's output surpassed that of the jewellery trade in nearby Derby and the products manufactured in the Quarter also improved in quality. The jewellery trade in Edinburgh also declined and by the end of the 19th century, the middle classes in London depended more on the supply of jewellery from Birmingham than from their own city. It is believed that by 1850, half of the gold and silverware products on sale in London jewellery shops had been produced in Birmingham, although there is no definitive data as many shopowners would not voluntarily admit where the product was manufactured. The Quarter made a large proportion of the British Empire's fine jewellery. Most jewellers still worked in small workshops that would employ between five and fifty people. Nine out of ten master jewellers were originally workmen. The fact that many jewellers lived alongside their workshops meant that public facilities had to be provided. In 1835, the Key Hill Cemetery (then called the General Cemetery) was opened for burial on Key Hill on land that had once been used as gardens and a sandpit. The owners continued to remove the sand until the 1930s as it was in such high demand and was of high quality. The cemetery was open to all, however, there was still pressure for an Anglican burial ground and in 1845, the Church of England Cemetery Company was established. In 1848, the company bought land used for sandpits and gardens from the Gooch and Vyse estates for use as a cemetery. The General Cemetery continued to expand and in the cemetery companies bought land north of Pitsford Street from the Vyse estate for expansion. However, this land was sold to the railway company in 1854. The General Cemetery again expanded in the 1890s northwards. The company purchased the site of Key Hill House, which had been demolished for the extraction of sand. This period was the time when such iconic characters were running business like Alfred Jerrold Nathan who was word famous about his pipe mounts which were mainly made from silver and rarely from butterscotch amber The Birmingham and Staffordshire Gas Light Company was established in 1825 and they lit Great Hampton Street in 1836. In 1832, the company started offering piped gas and, by 1840, all jewellers had a supply of gas to their blowpipes. In 1824, William Elliot set up a works on the corner of Frederick Street and Regents Street for the manufacture of buttons. In 1837, he patented a method of manufacturing cloth-covered buttons and built a factory to the rear of his works which extended to Vittoria Street. This was one of many purpose-built factories with others including the Victoria Works on Graham Street, which was built between 1839 and 1840 by Joseph Gillott for the mass production of steel pen nibs. On 28 May 1845, a party of jewellery representatives was sent from Birmingham to Buckingham Palace with the intention of persuading Queen Victoria to wear British made jewellery for the purpose of promoting it, and a meeting took place with the Royal couple. The group gave the Queen and the Prince an armlet, a brooch, a pair of ear-rings, a waist buckle, a watch- chain, a seal and key, together valued at over 400 guineas. All products were manufactured by Thomas Aston of Regent's Place and Mr. Baleny of St Paul's Square. The party claimed that 5,000 families were dependent on the jewellery trades in Birmingham. In 1846, Vyse Street was constructed by Richard Howard- Vyse. Hylton Street was then cut to the north. Branston, Spencer and Hockley Street were all extended from the Inge estate to Vyse Street and Pitsford Street on the Vyse estate. This layout was intended to produce as many building plots as possible. Three-storey terraced properties on Caroline Street that were used as workshops. By the mid-19th century, the jewellery trade was considered the most lucrative in the city with jewellers being some of the best paid workers in the city. There were also more people employed in the trade than any other in the city. Boys were given apprenticeships at the age of 14 and earned four shillings on average. This would increase annually until they were 21 where would work from 8am till 7pm. Although, it was common for jewellers to work overtime. Apprentices generally did not require any qualifications but style became a study within the industry and one jeweller's firm required all apprentices to attend the Birmingham School of Art. Families generally were not employed in the trade due to the cleanliness and careful manipulations needed in the crafting of certain pieces. Most families earned income as a result of the trade by producing leather or paper boxes which were used extensively by jewellers to protect finishes articles. By 1861, 7,500 were employed in the jewellery trade and by 1880, there were nearly 700 workshops listed in a local directory. The trade benefited greatly from the declining price of raw gold, from the 1880s onwards. It also benefited from the development and refinement of new processes such as electroplating which was invented by George Elkington at the Elkington Silver Electroplating Works on Newhall Street. Also invented in the Jewellery Quarter was the first man- made plastic, Parkesine, by Alexander Parkes in 1862. In 1883, less than half of all silver jewellery made in Birmingham was of high enough standard to pass through Birmingham Assay Office. However, in the same year no less than 30 tons 17 cwt 4 lb 4 oz (32,363 kg) of silver jewellery and 3 tons 7 cwt 12 lb 3 oz (3,409.3 kg) of gold items were received bringing the total number of articles sent in for assaying that year to over 2.6 million. In 1885, Thomas Harman and Walter Showell wrote their Showell's Dictionary of Birmingham in which they document that at the time of writing the book, the trade was experiencing a downturn in business and that thousands of workers were surviving on part-time hours with many finding themselves unemployed. This depression was felt nationwide and lasted throughout the 1880s. Many manufacturers went out of business during that period and showed to manufacturers after a long period of growth and prosperity that the trade was susceptible to economic problems. =Recovery= No. 3 Legge Lane was a pencil case factory constructed in 1893 to a design by Essex, Nicol & Goodman. Following the economic problems, traders and jewellers in the Jewellery Quarter created numerous initiatives for the area such as the establishment of the Birmingham Jewellers' and Silversmiths' Association (predecessor to the British Jewellery, Giftware and Finishing Federation) in 1887. Also, in 1890, a School of Jewellery and Silversmithing was established in a converted factory on Vittoria Street as a branch of the School of Art. Moving into the 20th century, the Jewellery Quarter benefited from the actions of the initiatives set up for jewellers and the industry grew to a size it had not witnessed. It reached a peak in 1914 with over 20,000 people being employed in the trade in the area. The suppliers of precious stones, tools and packaging also benefited. Throughout the growth, the Jewellery Quarter maintained its composition of small workshops with the larger factories being located on the northern fringe, producing lower quality jewellery. The lack of space meant that courts of worker's properties were being taken up by business owners to expand their businesses. The Jewellery Quarter continued to thrive through World War I as demand for military buttons, badges and medals increased. However, at the end of the war, the demand plummeted and the jewellers also witnessed a change in fashion in society. =Downturn and redevelopment= The demand for the products manufactured in the Jewellery Quarter peaked in 1920 and a steady decline started. The Quarter was hard hit by the Great Depression and struggled to recover after. Some companies constructed large factories as they tried to diversify their businesses. In World War II, manufacture turned again to munitions and this led to the Jewellery Quarter becoming a target of bombing raids by the Luftwaffe in the Birmingham Blitz. Like the rest of Birmingham, this brought a lot of damage to the Jewellery Quarter. St Paul's Church was damaged and was repaired between 1949 and 1951 to a design by J. B. Surman. In November 1940, Thomas Walker plc's 1934 factory in St Paul's Square was destroyed but rebuilt 18 months later. In 1943, the Birmingham Jewellers' and Silversmiths' Association created a committee to discuss the regeneration of the industry in the Quarter. As many of the buildings were considered inappropriate for use, it was proposed by the BJSA in 1945 for the redevelopment of the area into flatted factories. Despite being accepted, the plan was not implemented. Following the war, the Quarter witnessed a slight recovery which was again hindered by the lack of space. In 1948, it was reported that the larger factories on the northern fringe of the Quarter were experiencing a decline in manufacturing whilst those in the centre were witnessing the opposite. Larger firms moved out of the area in the 1950s and 1960s to new sites elsewhere in the city. Some development did take place, such as the clearing of court housing around Pope Street, Carver Street and Camden Street. The view northwards along Vyse Street, looking at the low rise element of the Birmingham City Council development plan which included retail units and a car park above it. A City Council survey in 1953 concluded that of land was beyond repair. In 1956, the council produced their own plans for the redevelopment of the area to consolidate non-industrial activities such as retail into well-defined areas. However, they were met with opposition as they took no consideration of the importance of the small tradesmen that were vital to the area. In 1960, Sir Richard Vyse produced a plan for his Hockley estate, however, he died before the plan could be carried out. In 1963, the council agreed to buy the freehold of of the Vyse estate for ¬£650,000. In 1965, a council scheme for the redevelopment of the area was approved for completion in 1972. The proposals included an eight-storey flatted factory and 16 workshops with car parking above them as well as a new Assay Office, School of Jewellery, exhibition hall, restaurant, office block and shop. The flatted factory, known as the Dockley Centre (now the Big Peg), was completed in 1971. The workshops with the car parking space was completed in 1978 to the north of this. The scheme was not a success as there were complaints over the higher rent prices and many of the 150 firms that were displaced by the development moved elsewhere in the Quarter. As a result, the council abandoned the plan to progress further with the development and said there would be no more large scale redevelopment in the area. Another development pioneered by the council was Sir Herbert Manzoni's Inner Ring Road and Middle Ring Road. The Inner Ring Road split the Newhall Street through a road widening scheme at Great Charles Street. Whilst the Ring Road had no major effect on the core of the Jewellery Quarter, the immediate land adjacent to the Queensway was bought up by large businesses who constructed large office blocks alongside the road. The Middle Ring Road bounded the Jewellery Quarter to the west and to the north and severely restricted the expansion of the Jewellery Quarter in the postwar years. The industry has continued to decline although has remained throughout the postwar years. This has been a result of lack of demand combined with foreign competition. In 1965, 8,000 people were employed in 900 firms but by 1985, this had reduced to 4,000 people in 600 firms. The average life of a firm in the 1980s was 2.8 years which meant that the leasing of space in flatted factories was impractical. A report by consultants Segal Quince Wickstead noted that since 1981, the council had provided a lot of support for businesses in the area and improved the environment. Schemes to regenerate the area have been implemented such as the designation of Industrial Improvement Area and grants being awarded by English Heritage for the repair of historic buildings. Over 300 buildings were upgraded, leading to private expenditure of over ¬£6 million. In 1987, many more physical changes were realised such as the completion of the first new housing in the area for a century, as well as the opening of a wine bar. A housing association converted a warehouse in St Paul's Square into flats. Anvic House was refurbished into workshops whilst one firm converted their premises into an advertising agency. However, by 1998, over 45% of the industrial establishments were vacant and only 12% of the area was occupied by families. On 5 November 1998, the Jewellery Quarter Urban Village Framework Plan was adopted to use mixed-use development to promote regeneration in the area and establish a community. The Urban Village Framework Plan was produced by a team of consultants led by EDAW Ltd. who were commissioned by Birmingham City Council, Urban Villages Forum and English Partnerships in November 1997. The plan recommended that the council work with English Partnerships and the local businesses in the area. As a result of the recommendations, the Jewellery Quarter Urban Village Regeneration Partnership was created with the partners being: * Birmingham City Council * Advantage West Midlands * Groundwork Birmingham & Solihull * The Jewellery Quarter Association * British Jewellers Association * Birmingham City University School of Jewellery * Business Link * The Developers Forum * Jewellery Quarter Community Web Residents Forum The Partnership meet twice a year to discuss progress made under their 'Charter of Renaissance'. The aim is to transform the area into a hub for creative businesses along with facilities for people to live there. One of the initiatives being used in the area for creative businesses is the loaning of free display cabinets to businesses. However, residents and employees in the Quarter have criticised the council's lack of progress in developing the Jewellery Quarter into a hub for creative businesses. In April 2003, the neighbourhood forum published a manifesto named Time To Polish The Gem in an attempt to draw attention to the issue. Manufacturers in the area have also complained that the rise in rents have made it difficult for them to remain. These complaints were published by the Jewellery Quarter Association Inc. Conservation The Grade II* listed Newman Brothers Coffin Furniture Factory on Fleet Street, Advantage West Midlands intend to turn it into a visitor centre The historical importance of the Jewellery Quarter was recognised by Birmingham City Council and English Heritage in the 1970s. In 1971, four years after the Civic Amenities Act which allowed the designation of conservation areas, St Paul's Square Conservation Area was created. It was recognised as Birmingham's last remaining Georgian square and an example of late 18th-century urban planning in Birmingham. In 1975, it was extended to include the Assay Office on Newhall Street. In 1980, the Jewellery Quarter Conservation Area and the Key Hill Conservation Area were designated. The St Paul's Square Conservation Area was extended in 1992 to take in the blocks around the square and approach from Ludgate Hill. The Key Hill Conservation Area was extended in 1994 and the Jewellery Quarter Conservation Area in 2000. In 1998, English Heritage undertook a survey of the entire Jewellery Quarter by documenting all the buildings in the area. They published a report, The Birmingham Jewellery Quarter Urban Village. An Architectural Survey of the Manufacturies 1760-1999, in September 1999 which concluded that the Jewellery Quarter is a historic industrial area with international significance. As a result of the report, the three conservation areas were merged to form the new Jewellery Quarter Conservation Area in September 2000. Birmingham City Council and English Heritage agreed to jointly fund a Character Appraisal and Management Plan. Also as a result of the report, a recommendation for the statutory listing of 106 buildings was made which was approved by the Heritage Minister Andrew McIntosh in 2004. Two were Grade II* listed while the remaining 104 received Grade II listed status. In 2000, Sir Neil Cossons announced that the Newman Brothers Coffin Furniture Factory would be given Grade II* listed status. The coffin factory was a candidate in Restoration (2003 BBCTV series), however did not receive enough votes to enter into the finals. The coffin factory was purchased by Advantage West Midlands in April 2003 and plans are being made to convert it into a museum, paid for by refurbishing part of the building into offices and letting it out tenants. As of 28 October 2014, Newman Brothers Coffin Furniture Factory opened as a museum under the Birmingham Conservation Trust and was renamed Newman Brothers at The Coffin Works. In January 2008, a council report recommended plans to submit a bid for the Jewellery Quarter to receive World Heritage Site status. The area would have to be recommended to the Government. Future The A.E. Harris building overlooking Northwood Street that is to be retained as part of their redevelopment scheme. Birmingham City Council's plan to develop the Jewellery Quarter into a hub for creative businesses has attracted significant amounts of private investment into the Quarter in recent years. Numerous proposals have been proposed and approved for mixed-use schemes in the area. Due to being a conservation area, many schemes involve the refurbishment of existing buildings although there are many new-build projects as well. One of the largest developments proposed for the Jewellery Quarter is the redevelopment of the A. E. Harris premises on Northwood Street. To be developed by A. E. Harris, a sheet metal manufacturing firm, and designed by John Simpson & Partners, the initial scheme involved the demolition of the existing A. E. Harris engineering sheds to make way for 211 residential units, of retail and restaurant facilities, a medical centre and an art gallery, of new B1 space, one third of which is affordable workshop space designed to maintain and promote jewellery-related activities within the area. The current scheme now contains 151 apartments. The design involves the retention of a Grade II listed building as well as two other buildings which are important to the local history and townscape. To maintain the fabric of the Jewellery Quarter, several new streets and lanes are being created as part of the scheme. The scheme is being undertaken by the firm in an attempt to safeguard the company's future as it is being hit by competition in the Far East. The money generated as a result of the proposal will be invested in the creation of new industrial premises for A. E. Harris, who are now in partnership with Advantage West Midlands. The scheme was initially rejected by councillors in 2005 due to the design of a proposed seven-storey office building within the scheme. However, the revised scheme was submitted in 2006 and received outline planning permission in 2008, despite strong objections from conservation societies who were worried that the scheme would increase land values in the immediate area by 900%, forcing out businesses. There was also anger towards the number of residential units proposed as part of the development. Construction work on the Newhall Square development in September 2008. Another major proposal for the area is Newhall Square, which consists of a mixture of apartments, retail units, office space and a Travelodge hotel. It is being constructed on the former site of the Museum of Science and Industry, which closed in 1997. When the museum closed, the site, owned by the City Council, became surplus to requirements and was marketed for disposal in 2001. In January 2002, a Development Brief was adopted as Supplementary Planning Guidance to provide prospective developers with information on how to develop the site appropriately. Following the publishing of the Development Brief, bids were made by developers for the site and a shortlisting process began. On 9 December 2002, RO St Bernard's Ltd were selected as the preferred developers for the site. A planning application for the site was submitted in 2005 and was approved in March 2006. The development on the site is estimated to cost ¬£63 million and will centre around a piazza. There will be 234 apartments, although 140 of these will be included in the 'Jewellery Box' phase of the development which was designed by Associated Architects. The Jewellery Box will also consist of of office space, as well as retail units and arts/exhibition space alongside the 100 bedroom Travelodge hotel. The Whitmore Warehouse in the centre of the site and 144 Newhall Street will converted as part of the scheme. Demolition of the site commenced in September 2006 and constructed started in late 2007. Of the buildings that were demolished was the James Watt building which housed the oldest working steam engine in the world built by James Watt. The front of the St Paul's Place development on St Paul's Square. St Paul's Square is becoming central to development schemes in the Jewellery Quarter. One major development overlooking the square is the ¬£35 million St Paul's Place scheme by Chord Developments. It is a mixed-use development consisting of 148 apartments, including a range of studio, one and two bedroom apartments, plus three penthouses, and of office space. It was designed by a team within Chord Developments and the construction work is being carried out by Costains. Chord has spent more than three years developing the scheme, which includes the restoration of the facade of the Thomas Walker building, the former buckle maker, which fronts onto St Paul's Square. Chord has created two courtyards and added three new wings to the former factory, on Northwood Street, Caroline Street and James Street. The new build extensions have been built in red brick to reflect the original building. At the heart of the development is a communal courtyard, designed by award-winning landscape architect Alan Gardner. Chord Developments also gave ¬£60,000 towards the improvement of the lighting in the square and installation of CCTV. Another scheme by Chord Developments in the Jewellery Quarter is JQ One which is a smaller development consisting of 43 apartments, one of which behind a two-storey penthouse apartment. JQ One is located on the junction of Newhall Street and George Street. A smaller development is the refurbishment of the Chamberlain Building, which overlooks the Chamberlain Clock. It has received a major facelift by MCD Property as Tesco, William Hill and Subway have signed up for the ground floor. The two floors above were refurbished to provide approximately of office space. Another small development is Spencer Point on Spencer Street which has been designed and is being constructed by PCPT Architects, who will move into the building when it is completed. There will also be 13 residential units and the building is to become one of the most eco-friendly buildings in the Jewellery Quarter when completed. It is due for completion in late 2008. The Spencer Point development on Spencer Street, under construction in September 2008. On the fringe of the Jewellery Quarter is the St Georges development which is being built by developer Chord Deeley. Covering an area of , it is the largest scheme proposed for the Jewellery Quarter. The site is bounded by Icknield Street, Camden Street and Carver Street and incorporating Pope Street and Moreton Street. It has been masterplanned by Urban Initiatives and will include 695 apartments, eight live/work spaces, of offices, of bars and restaurants, of retail, plus a 237 space multi-storey car park, in seven blocks. Also within the scheme are two hotels, including a ¬£15 million Ramada Encore hotel with 151 rooms on the corner of Icknield Street and Pope Street. The second hotel will contain 100 rooms. Alfred McAlpine and New World Leisure have been appointed by Chord Deeley to develop and operate the hotels in a joint venture. Most of the buildings on the site are derelict and in a poor state of repair and whilst none of them are listed, the Kettleworks, the former Swan kitchenware factory which dates back to 1890, is to be retained. Work began in summer 2008 on the first phase and the entire scheme is expected to be completed in 2012. It is estimated to cost ¬£130 million and is hoped that between 1,500-2,500 jobs will be created as a result. Also on the fringe of the Jewellery Quarter is the Birmingham Mint redevelopment by Junared Property Group. When the Mint closed in 2003, work got underway to find an alternative use for the site. Demolition work on the site commenced in early 2007 and construction in September 2007. The scheme has been designed by Ian Darby Partnership and is being developed in two phases. Phase 1 will include 192 apartments and approximately of offices whilst Phase 2 will consist of 62 apartments and a data centre is now in the planning stage. Ninex are constructing the complex. As part of the scheme, the Grade II listed fa√ßade and the chimney are being retained and incorporated. Geography The area rests on Bunter upper mottled sandstone from the Triassic period. These sands were very useful in the manufacture of moulds, which were extensively used in the metal working industries in Birmingham. Much of the rest of the city centre lies on Keuper sandstone, which is better suited for foundry work. The conservation area sits on a flat- topped hill, orientated north‚Äìsouth. The land falls steeply west towards Icknield Street and southeast to the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal. It rises southeast from the canal to Great Charles Street Queensway. The highest point is located on Warstone Lane. There were two pools within the Jewellery Quarter before the 19th century. The largest was Great Hockley Pool and the other was Little Hockley Pool, which was located on what is the site of Hockley railway station. Little Hockley Pool was filled in after 1834 whilst Great Hockley Pool was drained in 1869. In April 2008, the Jewellery Quarter was mentioned as being at risk of flooding by Gareth Morgan, an environment expert at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, due to the rising water table in the city and its location adjacent to Birmingham's canal network. The rising water table is partly a result of the loss of heavy industry which used to remove large quantities of water. Tourism The Royal Birmingham Society of Artists gallery on St Pauls. The wall plaques are by William Bloye. As well as being an industrial area, the Jewellery Quarter has become a tourist attraction itself as many of the workshops retain their 19th-century appearance. Birmingham City Council first recognised the importance of tourism in raising the profile of the Jewellery Quarter in the 1980s. Studies were commissioned on the industry and potential for tourism in the area. These were put together into a strategy which included aims such as improving views in the area, established a museum and a trade centre to rival Germany and Italy. This was accepted, except the trade centre proposal. The first things to be implemented were the refurbishment Vyse Street car park and the improvement in street parking provisions. Former derelict sites were turned into surface car parks. The existing street furniture was improved whilst necessary additions were made. To influence the quality of design for future shops, a shopfront design guide was prepared by the council for the area. There were also plans for an arcade and gateways into the Jewellery Quarter, but these were abandoned in the 1990s due to a lack of available finances. The city council also launched a series of initiatives aimed at promoting the Jewellery Quarter and raising the awareness of the location of the Quarter amongst the general public. Articles were published in local and national newspapers and magazines such as British Airways' own magazine Airtime. The council produced 200,000 leaflets in conjunction with Centro called How to find the Jewellery Quarter which were distributed through a range of outlets. Manufacturers were approached to allow members of the public to enter their premises and see products be manufactured in the Quarter. Many accepted and a 'Factory Tours' pack was published for the public. Retailers were also approached to assist in the publication of a prestigious shopping guide along with World Gold Guides. However, despite promises that over one million of the guides would published and distributed around the world, nothing was ever produced. The plan for gateways into the Jewellery Quarter was revived at the turn of the 21st century and three metal sculptures designed by Anuradha Patel, a local freelance artist, were unveiled on lamp posts at strategic location on Hall Street with Great Hampton Street, Newhall Street with Lionel Street, and Vyse Street with Great Hampton Street on 13 February 2003. The sculptures themselves were manufactured in the Jewellery Quarter by Form Fabrications (Birmingham) Limited. They are made from a variety of steel tubes and rods, which are rolled, bent and then welded together. The charm bracelet padlock at the bottom of Newhall Hill, marking the start of the Charm Bracelet Trail. The Museum of the Jewellery Quarter came about as a result of the strategy. It was created when the Smith & Pepper jewellery firm on Vyse Street closed their doors in 1981, leaving all the contents in the building. It is now a branch of the Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery and in 2008, TripAdvisor named it as the third best free tourist attraction in Europe, behind the Pantheon in Rome and the National Gallery in London. There are also a variety of art galleries. The Royal Birmingham Society of Artists is a historic society of artists who moved to an art gallery in St Paul's Square in 2000. St. Paul's Gallery is the largest commercial art gallery outside London and opened in February 2003. There are also two trails through the Jewellery Quarter that were created by the city council. The Findings Trail was designed by Laura Potter, a practising maker and graduate from the School of Jewellery. There are 30 pavement slabs, with a stainless steel information plaque based on the form of a hallmarked tag usually found on jewellery. There is also a glass cat's eye set into each information plaque which reflects light at night and day on the principle of a gemstone set in jewellery. Slabs contain various elements of either stainless steel or cast bronze. The Charm Bracelet Trail was designed by the Birmingham- based artist partnership Renn and Thacker. The trail is shaped like a giant bronze charm bracelet. At the bottom of Newhall Hill is a charm bracelet padlock that illuminates at night, marking the start of the trail. Industry The Argent Centre, on the corner of Frederick Street and Legge Lane, constructed in 1863 for W. E. Wiley, a pen manufacturer. Jewellery manufacturers continue work in the area today with around 700 jewellery- related businesses in the Quarter. 400 of these are jewellery manufacturers, producing 40% of British jewellery output. Jewellery is produced here for the general public and also for the wholesale and retail trade and the area is said to contain the highest concentration of dedicated jewellers in Europe. Vittoria Street hosts the Jewellery teaching centre for the Birmingham Institute of Art and Design. Many former industrial buildings have been refurbished including the Argent Centre. As a result of regeneration, the Jewellery Quarter has also become home to PR firms, media firms, software companies and developers. It also hosts half of the city's architectural practices. The silver and gold manufactured in the city during the 19th century and early 20th century was of exceptionally high quality, with its own hallmark. These products are now considered collectibles. In the 19th century, other products such as chains were manufactured. Some chains were produced to be purely ornamental and to be attached to watches. However, some larger chains were manufactured for industrial uses. These chains sometimes contained silver, and rarely gold. Gold chains would sell, on average, for ¬£250,000. The first silver guard chain made in Birmingham was made in 1806. At around the mid-19th century, between 1,500 and 1,600 people were employed in the chain- making industry, 500 of which were women. Another major trade in the Jewellery Quarter and the surrounding area was the pen trade. The Quarter was home to the world's first mass producer of pen nibs which made pens more affordable by reducing the cost by 99.9%. At the industry's peak in the area, 5,000 workers produced 1,500 million pen nibs per year. The area was home to many dip pen manufacturers who played a vital role in the pen trade in the city. During the first half of the 20th century, Swan Pens opened a large gold pen factory in the city, taking advantage of the skilled gold workers of the Jewellery Quarter. The Grade II listed Icknield Street fa√ßade of the Birmingham Mint. Many sporting awards have been produced in the area and still are today. The trophy awarded to the winners of the Wimbledon Ladies Singles tournament was produced in the area. Thomas Fattorini Ltd. is also based in the area and have designed and made the original FA Cup trophy, and still make the Lonsdale and Commonwealth belts for boxing. Whistles were pioneered in the Jewellery Quarter, especially by Joseph Hudson who produced the first football referee whistle in 1878 and invented the police whistle in 1883. Hudson also manufactured whistles for the RMS Titanic, some of which were recovered from the wreck. Around 1,000 million whistles have been made by various companies in the Jewellery Quarter since 1870. Coffins and coffin parts were also manufactured in the area with the main factory being the Newman Brothers Coffin Furniture Factory. The works were constructed in 1892 to a design by Richard Harley for Newman Brothers, who were brass founders and produced metal coffin fittings. The company manufactured coffin furniture in solid brass, electro-brass, silver plate and nickel plate, and later from resins with oxy- silver, oxy-bronze and oxy-copper finishes. At its peak, it employed 100 people. The company also made shrouds. By the 1950s, the company was exporting their products to Asia, Africa and North America. The company has also produced coffin furniture for the funerals of Sir Winston Churchill, Joseph Chamberlain and Princess Diana. When the company shut down in 1999 as a result of cheap mass production of fittings made from resins and plastics, it was one of three coffin furniture manufacturers in England. Coins were also manufactured in the Jewellery Quarter by the Birmingham Mint, which flourished in the city from 1850 till 2003. By 1889, it had become the biggest private mint in the world. However, as the Mint expanded, their business diversified into the manufacture of commemorative medals, copper tubings and gambling tokens. By 1953, coins accounted for only 5% of the business. Places of interest The Chamberlain Clock, commemorating Joseph Chamberlain's visit to South Africa in 1903 As tourism in the area has increased since the 1990s, many buildings have been restored and have since become local landmarks. St Paul's Square is the only remaining Georgian square in Birmingham, whose church was attended by the new industrialists. It eventually became overrun with workshops and lost its exclusiveness as a residence towards the end of the 19th century. It has now had restorative work and many are listed building. It is one of a few open spaces remaining in the Jewellery Quarter. Two others are the Warstone Lane and the Key Hill Cemeteries. Both cemeteries are closed to burials and are listed areas. The General Cemetery at Key Hill became Grade II listed on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens in 1996 and the Church of England Cemetery on Warstone Lane was added in 2001. However, they are in urgent need of restoration and have been placed on English Heritage's at Risk Register. Key Hill is home to the tombs of many influential people of Birmingham. The Chamberlain Clock stands at the junction of the Vyse and Frederick Street with Warstone Lane. It was constructed in 1903 to mark Joseph Chamberlain's visit to South Africa. It was unveiled in January 1904 by Chamberlain's wife. Newhall Street was home to the Museum of Science and Industry, which incorporated the Elkington Silver Electroplating Works. The museum closed in 1997 and the majority of the buildings were demolished, with only the buildings fronting onto Newhall Street and a hall in the centre of the site being retained. The site is to be developed in a mixed- use scheme called Newhall Square and will incorporate the remaining buildings. Many exhibits of the museum itself moved to Thinktank in Millennium Point. Another local landmark is the Big Peg, formerly called the Hockley Centre. It was completed in 1971 as an eight-storey flatted factory to a design by Peter Hing & Jones. The building was refurbished into a studio offices for arts, media and creative businesses. The Big Peg Gallery hosts arts exhibitions from local artists and the building has space for 500 people. It is owned and operated by SPACE Organisation. Located within the Big Peg is Concrete, a club which was opened on 1 February 2008 with Utah Saints headlining the opening. Transport Jewellery Quarter station with the rail and Metro lines. The Jewellery Quarter is served by the Jewellery Quarter station, a co-joined stop on both the West Midlands Metro and the main rail line into Birmingham Snow Hill station. It was opened as a passenger railway station in 1995 as part of the \\"Jewellery Line\\" project and Midland Metro services commenced in 1999. It is located on the Birmingham to Worcester via Kidderminster Line. It is located partly on the site of the Hockley goods facilities. The Hockley railway station is a disused station located about away from the current Jewellery Quarter station. It was open from 1854 till 1972. A viaduct starts at Snow Hill station and becomes a tunnel, cutting beneath the Jewellery Quarter. A new entrance to Snow Hill station is being constructed within the viaduct on the opposite side of Great Charles Street Queensway, within the Jewellery Quarter. Birmingham's canal network cuts through the south of the Jewellery Quarter. The Birmingham & Fazeley Canal was completed in this area in 1789. A canal arm was constructed by Caroline Colmore in 1809 and this became known as Miss Colmore's Canal, although was later named Whitmore's Arm. The canal arm has since been filled in although the remains of the entrance to it are still visible from the canal path. Also along this length of canal are the remains of brackets which held early canalside lighting. Newhall Street crosses the canal and beneath the bridge is lock 9 of the Farmers Bridge flight. Lock 10 is located directly beneath Brindley House, a telephone exchange which was constructed 1967‚Äì8 to a design by D.K. McGowan. It has recently been renovated into apartments by MCD Developments. The canal is no longer used for industrial purposes and is now used for leisure. The Jewellery Quarter itself consists of a network of narrow streets. However, the area is bounded by large roads, chiefly a product of postwar redevelopment. To the south is Great Charles Street Queensway which formed part of the A4400 Inner Ring Road. Part of the road also consists of the Great Charles Street Queensway tunnel, part of the A38. To the northwest is Icknield Street which forms part of the A4540 Middle Ring Road. At the western apex of the area, the Middle Ring Road forms a junction with the A457. At the northernmost point, Great Hampton Street crosses over the Middle Ring Road at Boulton Middleway. Great Hampton Street runs southeast and becomes Constitution Hill and then Old Snow Hill before merging with the Inner Ring Road at St Chad's Circus. To the southwest is Sand Pits and Summer Hill Road, forming part of the A457. Several bus services run through the Jewellery Quarter, and many National Express West Midlands buses run along the main roads on the boundaries. Education Municipal School for Jewellers and Silversmiths on Vittoria Street. The longest-running school in the Jewellery Quarter is the Municipal School for Jewellers and Silversmiths, now part of the Birmingham Institute of Art and Design, run by Birmingham City University, on Vittoria Street. The school was founded in 1888 and moved to its present location in 1890 when Martin & Chamberlain converted a goldsmith's factory, built in 1865 to a design by J. G. Bland. The top storey was added in 1906 by Cossins, Peacock & Bewlay who also designed the south extension in 1911. The school was acquired by the University of Central England in 1989, along with an adjoining site. They commissioned Associated Architects who designed a further south extension which was constructed between 1992 and 1993. They also redesigned much of the interior, creating a full-height atrium with gallery access to workshops. The reception area can also be used as exhibition space. The building itself consists of a Lombardo-Gothic front, whilst the 1911 extension is of red brick mottled with blue. The project won the 1995 RIBA Architecture Award and the 1996 Civic Trust Award. Bounded by Great Hampton Street, Hall Street and Kenyon Street is the Birmingham campus of The College of Law charity. It is located within industrial premises, previously occupied by William Canning & Co., manufacturing chemists and dry salters and became The College of Law premises in 2001. The entrance to the college is located at the corner of Great Hampton Street and Hall Street and there is vehicular access via Kenyon Street. The car park to the rear of the premises was created through the demolition of industrial units in the 1980s.Design Statement Design & Access Statement on planning application number C/02526/08/FUL. Submitted to Birmingham City Council on 2008-05-06. Retrieved 2008-09-10. On 6 May 2008, the college submitted a planning application for an extension to provide of additional space along with car parking. The extension was designed by Gaunt Francis Architects. It was approved by Birmingham City Council in September 2008 and construction commenced in October 2008 with completion in September 2009. Abbey College Birmingham is a college based in buildings overlooking St Paul's Square. Opened in October 1994, it is an independent college with approximately 140 pupils aged 14‚Äì19. It is part of the Alpha Plus Group. University College Birmingham own land on Legge Lane and commissioned Glancy Nicholls Architects in 2006 to design a new campus for the site. The ¬£15 million project was due to be submitted for planning permission in Spring 2007, although no planning application has been submitted. The design consisted of a four-storey building with of space. Part of the site includes the remaining gable end of St Paul's School which was completed in 1869 to a design by J. A. Chatwin. The former City of Birmingham Fire Brigade station on Albion Street which was built between 1909 and 1910 to a design by T. G. Price, has been converted into a private children's day nursery. Birmingham Music School - a Yamaha Music Point exists within Branston Court. Its presence heightens the growing music scene within the Jewellery Quarter and Hockley areas. Parking in the Jewellery Quarter is predominantly pay and display and permit holders bays. There are a variety of cheaper off-road options at around 50p per hour. There are also some free parking spaces on the side streets. Free bays are marked by a white P in a blue square on a nearby sign.

BiographyChildhood= Historical marker at the place of Caroline Ingalls's birth :For information on the relatives, see : List of real-life individuals from Little House on the Prairie Caroline was born 15 miles west of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the Town of Brookfield, Waukesha County. She was the fifth of seven children of Henry Quiner and Charlotte (Tucker) Quiner. Her brothers were Joseph, Henry, and Thomas, and her sisters were Martha Jane and Eliza (the Quiners' first child, Martha Morse Quiner, died in 1836). When Caroline was 5, her father was second mate on a ship that capsized and sank on Lake Michigan near the Straits of Mackinac. There were no survivors. In 1849, her mother married farmer Frederick Holbrook. They had one child together, Charlotte \\"Lottie\\" Holbrook. Caroline evidently loved and respected her stepfather, and would later honor his memory by naming her son after him. At the age of 16 1/2, Caroline started working as a teacher. =Marriage= On February 1, 1860, she married Charles Phillip Ingalls in Concord, WI. Together they had five children: Mary Amelia, Laura Elizabeth, Caroline Celestia (Carrie), Charles Frederick (Freddie), and Grace Pearl. Freddie Ingalls Charles Frederick \\"Freddie\\" Ingalls was born on November 1, 1875, in Walnut Grove, Minnesota, and died August 27, 1876, in South Troy, Minnesota, of indeterminate causes. In her autobiography Pioneer Girl, Laura remembers that \\"Little Brother was not well\\" and that \\"one terrible day, he straightened out his little body and was dead\\". Wilder scholar William Anderson noted: \\"Nearly forty years after Freddie's death, Ma mourned him, telling relatives how different everything would be 'if Freddie had lived'.\\" =Travels and later years= The Ingalls family traveled by covered wagon from Wisconsin; Kansas (Indian Territory); Burr Oak, Iowa; and Minnesota. In 1879, they settled in De Smet in Dakota Territory. Final home of Caroline Ingalls, built by Charles in 1887, and located in De Smet, South Dakota After arriving in De Smet, Caroline and the Ingalls family lived in the home of the local surveyor as well as a store in the downtown area, before homesteading just outside town on a farm by Silver Lake. When the Ingalls family sold the farm due to a persistent pattern of dry years, Charles built a home for them on Third Street in De Smet, known later as \\"The House That Pa Built\\". Following her husband's death from heart disease in 1902 at age 66, Ingalls and her oldest daughter, Mary, remained in the De Smet house, renting one of the rooms for extra income. Following a long illness, Caroline Ingalls died on Easter Sunday, April 20, 1924, at the age of 84.

In 2019 he was the general manager for the Arizona Hotshots of the Alliance of American Football. He was the senior vice president and general manager of the Browns from 2005 to 2008. He served as Director of Player Personnel for the Baltimore Ravens under General Manager Ozzie Newsome, a former Browns' player and member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, from 2003 to 2004. He was a scout for the Browns from 1993 to 1995. He was also the former general manager of the Cleveland Browns and the executive director for the Senior Bowl. Early years Savage attended high school at Murphy High School in Mobile, Alabama and played football and baseball at the University of the South (Sewanee, Tennessee). He earned a Bachelor of Arts in English and was a three-time all-conference shortstop in baseball. He received a master's degree in physical education from the University of Alabama in 1989. College coaching career Savage spent the first seven years of his career in the coaching ranks at Alabama, UCLA, and with the San Antonio Riders of the World League. Executive careerFirst stint with Browns= Savage began his career in the National Football League (NFL) as an intern with the Cleveland Browns in 1991. Savage was hired by the new Browns head coach Bill Belichick as a coach and made the transition to scouting and personnel in 1994. During his first stint in Cleveland, he worked with several talented young scouts and assistant coaches that Belichick had assembled, including Nick Saban, Kirk Ferentz, Pat Hill, and Jim Bates. =Baltimore Ravens= Savage worked his way up the ladder in the front office as a scout and personnel evaluator with the Browns, eventually following Cleveland's former owner Art Modell and the rest of the front office to Baltimore in 1995. Savage then played an important role in the drafting of 10 Pro Bowl players: offensive tackle Jonathan Ogden, linebacker Ray Lewis, receiver Jermaine Lewis, linebacker Peter Boulware, cornerback Chris McAlister, running back Jamal Lewis, linebacker Adalius Thomas, tight end Todd Heap, safety Ed Reed and linebacker Terrell Suggs. =Second stint with Browns= Savage was named Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Cleveland Browns on January 6, 2005. On December 30, 2005, reports surfaced that Savage was on the verge of being fired after less than one year on the job, an item that was quickly denied by Browns management. The speculation was based on a reported personality conflict between Savage and Browns team president John Collins. Four days after the organizational rift became public, it was Collins who resigned his post after losing the power struggle with Savage. Savage stole the headlines in the first round of the 2007 NFL Draft as the Browns drafted Wisconsin offensive tackle Joe Thomas with the third pick overall, and then acquired Notre Dame quarterback Brady Quinn with the 22nd pick, acquired through a trade with the Dallas Cowboys. The Browns gave up their 2007 second-round pick and 2008 first-round draft selection to Dallas for the chance to pick Quinn. The Browns signed Savage to a three-year extension through 2012 on May 2, 2008.

The southern terminus of NH 108 is at the Massachusetts state line in Plaistow. The northern terminus is at an intersection with New Hampshire Route 125 and New Hampshire Route 202A in downtown Rochester. At its southern end, NH 108 connects to Massachusetts Route 108, a very short state route which continues south for to Massachusetts Route 110 in Haverhill. NH 108 is notable in being one of two routes (the other being New Hampshire Route 9) to intersect both U.S. Route 4 and New Hampshire Route 4 (a rare case of two completely separate routes in one state having the same number). Route description Massachusetts Route 108 = Route 108 begins at an intersection with Route 110 north of downtown Haverhill, Massachusetts, near Kenoza Lake. The highway proceeds due north, passing underneath I-495 before crossing into Plaistow, New Hampshire, where it becomes NH 108. Map of Massachusetts Route 108, a southward extension of NH 108 into Haverhill = Plaistow to Exeter = East Kingston NH 108 runs along the eastern edge of Plaistow, near the Massachusetts border, before crossing through Newton into East Kingston, where it crosses NH 107A, then turns eastward to form a brief wrong-way concurrency with NH 107. Continuing north, NH 108 passes through Kensington, where it meets the north end of NH 150 and continues north into Exeter. In Exeter, NH 108 meets NH 27, NH 111 and NH 111A, forming a very brief overlap with the former two routes. NH 108 meets the western end of NH 88, then interchanges with the NH 101 freeway at exit 11. =Stratham to Dover= Route 108 at the traffic circle in Stratham, the western terminus of Route 33 NH 108 crosses into Stratham where it meets NH 33, a connector to US 1 in Portsmouth which also interchanges with I-95, at a traffic circle. Continuing northward, NH 108 passes through Newfields and Newmarket, intersecting with NH 85 and NH 152 along the way. The road crosses into Durham and Strafford County, passing through the center of town just east of the University of New Hampshire main campus, and then interchanging with US 4. NH 108 continues through eastern Madbury and into the city of Dover. =Dover to Rochester= NH 108 interchanges with the Spaulding Turnpike (NH 16) at exit 7, becoming Central Avenue, the main road in downtown Dover. The road intersects NH 9 and NH 4 at Silver Street. NH 4 has its western terminus here. The three routes briefly run concurrently in the center of Dover, before NH 4 splits off towards South Berwick, Maine via Portland Avenue. NH 9 and NH 108 continue north until NH 9 splits off towards Berwick, Maine, near an intersection with the Spaulding Turnpike at Exit 9 (via Indian Brook Drive). NH 108 continues north into the city limits of Somersworth, where it meets NH 236, a short connector to NH 9 bound for Berwick. NH 108 serves as Somersworth's industrial strip, then continues north into Rochester. NH 108 terminates at the intersection of South Main Street and Columbus Avenue (NH 125), a terminus it shares with NH 202A. South Main Street continues into downtown as NH 202A westbound. The Dover to Rochester section of NH 108 is scheduled for a $11.36 million improvement project, to begin in 2022, \\"to improve safety and mobility for drivers, pedestrians, bikers and transit users,\\" according to NHDOT. Major intersectionsHistory The designation for NH 108 was in use by 1927, essentially following its present- day route from the Massachusetts border to Dover. Until the early 1990s, NH 108 ended in Dover at an intersection with NH 16 (locally, at the Central Avenue intersection with Stark Avenue / Dover Point Road). When NHDOT rerouted NH 16 onto the Spaulding Turnpike as a concurrency, the section of NH 16 from the noted intersection in Dover to NH 125 in Rochester became a northward extension of NH 108.

The book debuted on The New York Times Best Seller list. It was adapted as a television mini-series of the same title in 1994 starring Timothy Dalton as Rhett Butler and Joanne Whalley- Kilmer as Scarlett O'Hara. Plot summary The book begins where Gone with the Wind left off, with Scarlett attending the funeral of her former sister- in-law and rival for Ashley Wilkes' affection, Melanie Wilkes, at which her estranged husband, Rhett Butler, is not present. Scarlett, heartbroken and aggravated that Rhett left her, sets out for Tara and is saddened when she learns that Mammy, her mainstay since birth, is dying. She sends a telegram to notify Rhett about Mammy under the name of Will Benteen (her sister Suellen's husband), because she knows that Rhett won't come if he suspects Scarlett is there. Before Mammy dies, she makes Rhett swear to look after Scarlett. Rhett agrees, although he has no intention of honoring the request. After Mammy's death, Rhett and Scarlett fight, which culminates in Rhett leaving and Scarlett returning to the Atlanta house, determined to win Rhett back. Scarlett travels to Charleston to visit Rhett's family and tries to corner him by winning his mother's affection. She convinces Rhett to take her for a sail on the harbour, where their boat capsizes during a terrible storm. Scarlett and Rhett swim to an island, where they make love in a cave. Rhett initially denies, then admits, that he loves Scarlett, but he does not want to \\"lose himself\\" over her again. Back in Charleston, Rhett leaves Scarlett near death at his mother's house, telling her, in a letter, that while he admires her bravery, he will never see her again. After Scarlett regains her strength, she leaves Charleston with her two aunts, Pauline and Eulalie, to attend her maternal grandfather's birthday celebration in Savannah. She leaves a note to Rhett's mother with Rhett's sister, Rosemary, who burns the note. Scarlett connects with the Savannah O'Haras against her maternal family's wishes. Scarlett's grandfather offers Scarlett his inheritance if she remains with him in Savannah until his death and avoids contact with her father's side of the family. Scarlett refuses and storms out of the house. She goes to stay with her cousin Jamie and his family. Soon another cousin named Colum, a priest from Ireland, joins them. Scarlett agrees to travel to Ireland with him. By this time Scarlett has realized that she is pregnant with Rhett's child but she keeps her pregnancy hidden. In Ireland, Scarlett is heartily welcomed by her Irish kin. Exploring with Colum, they pass an old house called 'Ballyhara'; it was O'Hara land long ago before the English seized it. Scarlett soon receives a notification of divorce from Rhett. She makes plans to leave for America but learns that Rhett is now married to Anne Hampton, who is said to resemble Melanie Wilkes. Heartbroken, Scarlett decides to remain in Ireland. She works with lawyers and leaves her two-third share of her father's plantation, Tara, to her son Wade Hampton (fathered by her first husband, Charles Hamilton, brother of Melanie Wilkes), buys Ballyhara and settles down in Ireland, to her Irish family's delight. She and Colum tell everyone that her husband died rather than tell the truth that she was divorced. As Ballyhara is restored, Scarlett eagerly awaits the birth of her child, praying for it to be a girl and vowing to be a good mother. She is well respected by the townspeople and her family, earning her a reputation as a hard worker. She becomes known as The O'Hara, a title reserved for the undisputed leader of a family clan. On Halloween night, her water breaks. Her housekeeper, Mrs. Fitzpatrick, and the midwife whom Colum summons are unable to handle the situation, and it appears that Scarlett will die. Instead, she is saved by a wise old woman who lives near the haunted tower. The caesarean birth is successful, but internal damage is done to Scarlett, who can no longer have children. The baby, a girl, is born with dark skin like Rhett's, but with blue eyes that slowly turn green. Scarlett names her Katie Colum O'Hara, and calls her \\"Cat\\" because of her green eyes. After Scarlett has settled down in Ballyhara, she runs into Rhett a number of times‚Äîin America while she is on the boat to Boston, at a fair where she admits she still loves him, and at a foxhunt a week later. He still does not know he has a child. He then seeks her out at a society ball and Scarlett realizes he still loves her. Lord Fenton, one of the wealthiest men in Europe, pursues Scarlett, wanting to marry her. He wants Scarlett to bear his children after seeing Cat's fiery spirit and fearlessness. He also plans to unite their estates; he owns Adamstown, the land adjacent to Scarlett's. Angered by his arrogance, Scarlett refuses and orders him out of her house. Scarlett leaves for Dublin for her yearly visit for parties and hunts. She later decides to accept Lord Fenton when she hears that Anne is pregnant with Rhett‚Äôs child. The news leaks out about her engagement and a drunken Rhett insults her when she runs into him at a horse race. A friend tells Scarlett that Anne and the baby both died, and she rushes back to Ballyhara hopeful that Rhett will come looking for her. She finds English there with a warrant to arrest Colum, who is the head of a group of Irish terrorists. Colum is murdered and Rosaleen Fitzpatrick sets fire to the English arsenal to avenge him. The villagers, thinking Scarlett is in league with the English, burn her house down. Rhett comes to her rescue and tries to convince her to escape with him, but Scarlett runs around her house yelling for her daughter. When she tells Rhett that he is Cat's father, he helps her search. After finding Cat, the three climb into a high tower on Ballyhara and stay there for the night. Rhett and Scarlett both say \\"I love you\\". They wake up the next morning ready to start their new lives together and leave Ireland.  Reception  Reviewing the novel for The New York Times in 1991, Janet Maslin said the book was a \\"stunningly uneventful 823-page holding action.\\" Donald McCaig, author of Rhett Butler's People, said it was his impression that the Margaret Mitchell estate was \\"thoroughly embarrassed\\" by Scarlett. Scarlett, universally panned by critics, nevertheless was a commercial success. The book sold millions of copies and remains in print.\\"Alexandra Ripley, 'Scarlett' Author, Dies at 70\\", New York Times, January 27, 2004.

It is located in the Belgrade's municipality of Vraƒçar.  Location  Englezovac is located in the western part of the municipality, on the western slopes of the Vraƒçar hill and stretches from the Slavija square to the Vraƒçar plateau and the Temple of Saint Sava. The main streets in the neighborhood are Svetog Save, Makenzijeva and the Boulevard of the Liberation. Originally, term stretched west of the boulevard, but today not many people consider that part of Belgrade as part of Vraƒçar.  History  Construction of Englezovac started in 1880 after a Scottish businessman and Nazarene Francis Mackenzie bought a large piece of land in 1879 from ƒêorƒëe Simiƒá, Serbian politician and prime minister, for 7,500 ducats. Land was bounded by the modern streets of Beogradska, Njego≈°eva, Molerova, Makenzijeva (named after Mackenzie), Kataniƒáeva, Bore Stankoviƒáa, Skerliƒáeva and Bulevar osloboƒëenja. Previously known as the Simiƒáev Majur (‚ÄùSimiƒá's farm‚Äù), the area eventually became known as Englezovac, Serbian for Englishman's place), as the term Englishman is, even today, universally used in colloquial speech for any inhabitant of the Great Britain. As the Simiƒáev Majur was a marshy area, Mackenzie originally planned to drain the land and organize agricultural production. He changed his plans later, hiring architects who parceled it out into lots for selling and cut the streets through. Mackenzie then sold the lots. Soon numerous houses were built, mostly one or two-floors high. Larger edifices included the Hall of Peace (Sala mira), in which the cult cinema \\"Slavija\\" was situated later. After the urbanization, Englezovac included the area between the streets of Njego≈°eva and Svetog Save. He also donated a piece of land to the Serbian Orthodox Church for the construction of the Temple of Saint Sava. \\"The Society for the Embellishment of Vraƒçar\\" suggested to Belgrade City Council to rename Englezovac to Savinac (Serbian for Sava's place) on 31 March 1894. They stated that it is \\"a shame for the Serbian capital that a whole district is called Englishman's\\" and unconceivable that a national shrine (Temple of Saint Sava) lie on foreign property. In the late 1980s, many books and articles on \\"Old Belgrade\\" became popular again and so the term Englezovac, at this time already unknown to majority of people, resurfaced. However, just like Savinac, it didn't get the popular usage, and most of Belgraders still refer to this part of the city as Vraƒçar.

He is depicted as the character \\"Pa\\" in the books and the television series. Early life and family Charles Ingalls was born in Cuba, New York, the second of nine children of Lansford Whiting and Laura Louise (nee Colby) Ingalls. Ingalls' parents appear as \\"Grandpa\\" and \\"Grandma\\" in the Laura Ingalls Wilder book Little House in the Big Woods. Ingalls' father was born in Dunham, Missisquoi County, Lower Canada (now Dunham, Quebec, Canada), a descendant of Henry Ingalls (1627‚Äì1714) who was born in Skirbeck, Lincolnshire, England and settled in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. His mother was born in Vermont and was a descendant of Edmund Rice, an early immigrant to Massachusetts Bay Colony. Ingalls' paternal grandmother was Margaret Delano, a descendant of Mayflower passenger Richard Warren as well as from the Delano family of New York and ancestors of U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In the 1840s, when Ingalls was a young boy, his family moved from New York to the tallgrass prairie of Campton Township, just west of Elgin, Illinois. Ingalls grew into an accomplished hunter-trapper, carpenter, and farmer. He had a love of music and reading, and played the violin. On February 1, 1860, Ingalls married a neighbor, the quiet and proper Caroline Lake Quiner. Together, they had five children: Mary Amelia, Laura Elizabeth, Caroline Celestia (Carrie), Charles Frederick (Freddie), who died in infancy, and Grace Pearl. Family travels and settlingWisconsin to points west= For his entire life, Ingalls had a strong case of \\"wanderlust\\". He is quoted by his daughter, Laura Ingalls Wilder, in her Little House series of books as saying: \\"My wandering foot gets to itching\\". From their original home in the woods of Wisconsin, Ingalls moved his family to Indian Territory in southeastern Kansas, then back to Wisconsin, Burr Oak, Iowa and from there to southern Minnesota. Presented with an opportunity to work for a railroad in Dakota Territory, he longed to move yet again, as the family was struggling financially in Minnesota. Charles moved to Dakota Territory in 1879, took a job with the Chicago and North Western Railroad, and filed for a homestead in Brookings, Dakota Territory, on February 19, 1880. =De Smet, final home= After promising his wife, Caroline, that the family would finally settle in one place, it was in 1879 that Ingalls decided to stay in De Smet, Dakota Territory following their move from Minnesota. The first winter after arriving in De Smet, the family lived in what was known as the surveyor's house. Following the first winter, Ingalls decided to try farming in the area of Silver Lake, outside town. A few years later, he had \\"proved up\\" his claim and sold the farm, choosing to move back into De Smet and build a home on Third Street. Construction on the house began in 1887 and was completed in 1889. It was in this house that Ingalls, along with his wife and daughter Mary, lived out the rest of his days. In 1880, Ingalls opened a general goods store. The business closed in 1881. A respected citizen of De Smet, Ingalls held various elected positions in the town, including Justice of the Peace and deputy sheriff. Ingalls helped found, build, and was an active member of the First Congregational Church in De Smet. The first service was held in the new church building on August 30, 1882. Ingalls and his wife, along with oldest daughter Mary, were among the church's eight original charter members.

On 16 October 2012, after a series of legal proceedings in Britain, Home Secretary Theresa May blocked extradition to the United States.  Alleged crime  McKinnon was accused of hacking into 97 United States military and NASA computers over a 13-month period between February 2001 and March 2002, at the house of his girlfriend's aunt in London, using the name 'Solo'. US authorities stated he deleted critical files from operating systems, which shut down the United States Army's Military District of Washington network of 2000 computers for 24 hours. McKinnon also posted a notice on the military's website: \\"Your security is crap\\". After the September 11 attacks in 2001, he deleted weapons logs at the Earle Naval Weapons Station, rendering its network of 300 computers inoperable and paralyzing munitions supply deliveries for the US Navy's Atlantic Fleet. McKinnon was also accused of copying data, account files and passwords onto his own computer. US authorities stated that the cost of tracking and correcting the problems he caused was over $700,000. While not admitting that it constituted evidence of destruction, McKinnon did admit leaving a threat on one computer: US authorities stated that McKinnon was trying to downplay his own actions. A senior military officer at the Pentagon told The Sunday Telegraph: Arrest and legal proceedings McKinnon was first interviewed by police on 19 March 2002. After this interview, his computer was seized by the authorities. He was interviewed again on 8 August 2002, this time by the UK National Hi-Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU). In November 2002, McKinnon was indicted by a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia.U.S. V. Gary McKinnon - text of Indictment (PDF). FindLaw.com. The indictment contained seven counts of computer-related crime, each of which carried a potential ten- year jail sentence. =Extradition proceedings= McKinnon remained at liberty without restriction for three years until June 2005 (until after the UK enacted the Extradition Act 2003, which implemented the 2003 extradition treaty with the United States wherein the United States did not need to provide contestable evidence), when he became subject to bail conditions including a requirement to sign in at his local police station every evening and to remain at his home address at night. If extradited to the U.S. and charged, McKinnon would have faced up to 70 years in jail. He had also expressed fears that he could be sent to Guantanamo Bay.'Hacker' extradition case reopens, BBC News, 14 February 2006British 'hacker' fears Guantanamo, BBC News, 12 April 2006 =Appeal to the House of Lords= Representing McKinnon in the House of Lords on 16 June 2008, barristers told the Law Lords that the prosecutors had said McKinnon faced a possible 8‚Äì10 years in jail per count if he contested the charges (there were seven counts) without any chance of repatriation, but only 37‚Äì46 months if he co-operated and went voluntarily to the United States. U.S.-style plea bargains are not a part of English jurisprudence (although it is standard practice to reduce the sentence by one- third for a defendant who pleads guilty)McKinnon v Government of the United States of America and another, section 34 and McKinnon's lawyers contended that in effect this was intimidation to force McKinnon to waive his legal rights. McKinnon also stated that he had been told that he could serve part of his sentence in the UK if he co-operated. He rejected the offer because the Americans would not guarantee these concessions. McKinnon's barrister said that the Law Lords could deny extradition if there was an abuse of process: \\"If the United States wish to use the processes of English courts to secure the extradition of an alleged offender, then they must play by our rules.\\" The House of Lords rejected this argument, with the lead judgement (of Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood) holding that \\"the difference between the American system and our own is not perhaps so stark as [McKinnon]'s argument suggests\\" and that extradition proceedings should \\"accommodate legal and cultural differences between the legal systems of the many foreign friendly states with whom the UK has entered into reciprocal extradition arrangements\\". =Further appeals= McKinnon appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, which briefly imposed a bar on the extradition, but the request for an appeal was rejected. On 23 January 2009, McKinnon won permission from the High Court to apply for a judicial review against his extradition.\\"Hacker wins court review decision\\", BBC News, 23 January 2009. On 31 July 2009, the High Court announced that McKinnon had lost this appeal.McKinnon, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for Home Affairs [2009] EWHC 2021 (Admin) (31 July 2009) McKinnon's legal team, solicitor Karen Todner and barrister Ben Cooper, applied for a judicial review into the Home Secretary's rejection of medical evidence, which stated that, when he could easily be tried in the UK, it was unnecessary, cruel and inhumane to inflict the further stress of removing him from his homeland, his family and his medical support network. =British government blocks extradition= On 16 October 2012, then-Home Secretary Theresa May announced to the House of Commons that the extradition had been blocked, saying that: > Mr McKinnon is accused of serious crimes. But there is also no doubt that he > is seriously ill [...] He has Asperger's syndrome, and suffers from > depressive illness. Mr McKinnon's extradition would give rise to such a high > risk of him ending his life that a decision to extradite would be > incompatible with Mr McKinnon's human rights. She stated that the Director of Public Prosecutions would determine whether McKinnon should face trial before a British court. On 14 December, the DPP, Keir Starmer, announced that McKinnon would not be prosecuted in the United Kingdom, because of the difficulties involved in bringing a case against him when the evidence was in the United States. Judicial review In January 2010 Mr Justice Mitting granted McKinnon a further judicial review of the decision of Home Secretary Alan Johnson to allow McKinnon‚Äôs extradition. Mitting distinguished two issues which were arguable, the first being whether psychiatrist Jeremy Turk's opinion that McKinnon would certainly commit suicide if extradited means that the Home Secretary must refuse extradition under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (which prevents a public authority from acting in a way incompatible with convention rights). The second was whether Turk's opinion was a fundamental change to the circumstances that the courts had previously considered and ruled upon. Mitting ruled that if the answer to both questions was \\"Yes\\", then it was arguable that it would be unlawful to allow the extradition. Support for McKinnon In early November 2008, eighty British MPs signed an Early Day Motion calling for any custodial sentence imposed by an American court to be served in a prison in the UK. On 15 July 2009, many voted in Parliament against a review of the extradition treaty. In November 2008, the rock group Marillion announced that it was ready to participate in a benefit concert in support of McKinnon's struggle to avoid extradition to United States. The organiser of the planned event was Ross Hemsworth, an English radio host. No date had been set as of November 2008. Many prominent individuals voiced support, including Sting, Trudie Styler, Julie Christie, David Gilmour, Graham Nash, Peter Gabriel, The Proclaimers, Bob Geldof, Chrissie Hynde, David Cameron, Boris Johnson, Stephen Fry, and Terry Waite. All proposed that, at least, he should be tried in the UK. In August 2009, Glasgow newspaper The Herald reported that Scots entrepreneur Luke Heron would pay ¬£100,000 towards McKinnon's legal costs in the event he was extradited to the US. In a further article in The Herald, Joseph Gutheinz, Jr., a retired NASA Office of Inspector General Senior Special Agent, voiced his support for McKinnon. Gutheinz, who is also an American criminal defence attorney and former Member of the Texas Criminal Justice Advisory Committee on Offenders with Medical and Mental Impairments, said that he feared Gary McKinnon would not find justice in the USA, because \\"the American judicial system turns a blind eye towards the needs of the mentally ill\\". Web and print media across the UK were critical of the extradition. Janis Sharp, McKinnon's mother, stood as an independent candidate in the 2010 general election in Blackburn in protest against the sitting Labour MP Jack Straw, who was Foreign Secretary when the extradition treaty was agreed. She finished last out of eight candidates with 0.38% of the vote. On 20 July 2010, Tom Bradby, ITN's political editor, raised the Gary McKinnon issue with U.S. President Barack Obama and Prime Minister David Cameron in a joint White House press conference who responded that they had discussed it and were working to find an 'appropriate solution'. =Song= In August 2009, Pink Floyd's David Gilmour released an online single, \\"Chicago - Change the World\\", on which he sang and played guitar, bass and keyboards, to promote awareness of McKinnon's plight. A re-titled cover of the Graham Nash song \\"Chicago\\", it featured Chrissie Hynde and Bob Geldof, plus McKinnon himself. It was produced by long-time Pink Floyd collaborator Chris Thomas and was made with Nash's support.  Statements to the media  McKinnon has admitted in many public statements that he obtained unauthorised access to computer systems in the United States including those mentioned in the United States indictment. He states his motivation, drawn from a statement made before the Washington Press Club on 9 May 2001 by \\"The Disclosure Project\\", was to find evidence of UFOs, antigravity technology, and the suppression of \\"free energy\\", all of which he states to have proven through his actions.\\"UFO Hacker\\" Tells What He Found, Wired News, 21 June 2006 In an interview televised on the BBC's Click programme, McKinnon stated that he was able to get into the military's networks simply by using a Perl script that searched for blank passwords; in other words his report suggests that there were computers on these networks with the default passwords active. In his interview with the BBC, he also stated of \\"The Disclosure Project\\" that \\"they are some very credible, relied-upon people, all saying yes, there is UFO technology, there's anti-gravity, there's free energy, and it's extraterrestrial in origin and [they've] captured spacecraft and reverse engineered it.\\" He said he investigated a NASA photographic expert's claim that at the Johnson Space Center's Building 8, images were regularly cleaned of evidence of UFO craft, and confirmed this, comparing the raw originals with the \\"processed\\" images. He stated to have viewed a detailed image of \\"something not man-made\\" and \\"cigar shaped\\" floating above the northern hemisphere, and assuming his viewing would be undisrupted owing to the hour, he did not think of capturing the image because he was \\"bedazzled\\", and therefore did not think of securing it with the screen capture function in the software at the point when his connection was interrupted.The NASA Hacker , BBC Click  NASA documents  In 2006, a Freedom of Information Act request was filed with NASA for all documents pertaining to Gary McKinnon. NASA's documents consisted of printed news articles from the Slashdot site, but no other related documents. This was consistent with NASA employees browsing internet articles about Gary McKinnon; the records of such browsing activity are in the public domain. The FOIA documents have been uploaded to the Internet for review and can be downloaded.NASA FOIA documents related to Gary McKinnon, January 19, 2007 (PDF). theblackvault.com.

He was the oldest man to reach the South Pole unsupported, at the age of 63.  Early life  Murray was born in Leicester, England into a family with some tradition of military service. His father belonged to a wealthy family. Murray's grandfather on his father's side retained a permanent suite at the Connaught Hotel, while his grandmother retained a similar suite at Claridges Hotel. Murray's father abandoned the family early on and Murray claims to have had no recollection of him at that time. An uncle paid for Murray to attend Bedford School, an independent school in Bedford in Bedfordshire. In 1960, he joined the French Foreign Legion, and served for five years in the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment (2e REP). During his service, he fought in the Algerian War against the Front de Lib√©ration National (FLN). After rising to the rank of Chief Corporal, he turned down an offer to attend Officers' School in France, and left the Legion in 1965 after completing his service. He wrote of his experiences in the Legion in the book Legionnaire, published in 1978. And later, based on his book he produced the autobiographical movie \\"Deserter\\" which released as a DVD.  Business career  On leaving the Foreign Legion in 1965, he got married and moved to Hong Kong where he worked for Jardine Matheson for fourteen years. After that, he left to start his own company, Davenham Investments, a project advisory company. N.M.Rothschild took a 50% stake in Davenham. Amongst many high-profile deals, Davenham went on to represent Mitsui in the Singapore Mass Transit Railway project. In 1984, Davenham was sold to Li Ka-Shing for US$20 million as a precursor to Murray becoming group managing director of Hutchison Whampoa. He stayed for ten years, initiating Hutchison's acquisition of Hong Kong Electric, and negotiating their entry into the oil business through their acquisition of Husky Oil. Whilst CEO of Hutchison, he founded a mobile phone company and, after turning it into the global brand \\"Orange\\", it was sold in 1999 for US$36 billion to Mannesmann. From 1994 to 1998, Simon was the Executive Chairman of the Deutsche Bank Group in Asia. He then established his own company, General Enterprise Management Services Ltd (GEMS), a mid-sized investment group operating across Asia. In addition to this Simon was a founder of Distacom which made a number of mobile telecoms investments including Madacom in Madagascar, Spice Telecom in India and Sunday Communications in Hong Kong. He has also invested in other mobile operations in New Zealand, San Marino, Papua New Guinea and elsewhere. Murray was the chairman of Glencore from 2011 to 2013. He later became chairman of Gulf Keystone Petroleum from 2013 to 2015. He has served on boards and held advisory positions with a number of other large companies, including Vodafone, Tommy Hilfiger Corporation, Vivendi Universal, Usinor SA, Hermes, General Electric (USA), China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), Macquarie Bank, N.M. Rothschild, and Bain (the consultancy company). He continues to serve on the advisory board of Lightbridge Corporation (USA), and was on the Development Advisory Board of Imperial College, London. Murray is currently the Executive Chairman of GEMS, and a board director of Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd, Orient Overseas (International) Ltd, Wing Tai Properties Ltd, Arnhold Holdings Ltd, Richemont SA, Essar Energy plc, Omnicorp Ltd and IRC Ltd. Adventurer Following a suggestion by his wife, Murray joined Pen Hadow for a trek to the Geographic South Pole. The 1,200 km trek started in early December 2004 at Hercules Inlet on the Zumberge Coast, Antarctica and was completed when they reached the South Pole about two months later. They climbed up to 2,835 m above mean sea level on the way. Murray became the oldest man to reach the South Pole unsupported.  Honours  He has been appointed a CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) by H.M. The Queen, and the Order of Merit of the French Republic and is a \\"Chevalier de La Legion d‚ÄôHonneur\\". He holds an honorary degree in law, from the University of Bath and attended the (SEP) Stanford Executive Program in the US.  Television  Murray presented 'The Legion is My Country', a BBC Radio 4 documentary (produced by Alec Reid) celebrating the 150th anniversary of the founding of the French Foreign Legion. It was broadcast on 26 May, 1981. Also in the 80s, Murray presented a documentary on the French Foreign Legion, where he explained the traditions and folklore that surround this elite force. He also appeared and contributed on the documentary series Escape to the Legion and Weaponology. Personal life In 1965, he married his long-time girlfriend, pilot Jennifer (formerly Jennifer Mather), with whom he has three children and six grandchildren. She was the first woman to fly around the world in a helicopter.

The menu features Tex-Mex items, made-from-scratch salsa, tortillas and sauces, and a range of other Mexican specialties. At one time, this chain had as many as 120 locations throughout the United States and was the second largest full-service Mexican restaurant chain within the United States during the late 1990s, second only to Chi-Chi's. Alternate Link via ProQuest. The chain had 34 restaurants in 14 states when it was acquired in 2014 by Food Management Partners. By October 2016, the chain was reduced to 12 restaurants in 9 states, 6 restaurants in 4 states by July 2018, 5 restaurants in 3 states by September 2018, and later 3 restaurants in 3 states by November 2018. The remaining restaurants in the struggling chain gradually and quietly closed over the next seven months until the last restaurant in Deptford Township, New Jersey, finally closed on June 23, 2019.  History  This chain of Tex-Mex restaurants was started by Texas-based DF&R; Restaurants Inc. in 1985. Alternate Link via ProQuest. After a period of rapid growth throughout the state of Texas, Don Pablo's began to build new locations in the Midwest. By 1995, DF&R; had 51 Don Pablo's locations which made Madison, Georgia-based Apple South to notice the chain successful growth rate during the previous ten years of operation. This led to Apple South's purchase of DF&R; in 1995. At the time of the purchase, Apple South was one of the largest franchise holders in the Applebee's restaurant system with 170 Applebee's restaurants, along with operating restaurants from other franchise chains, with most of the properties located in the South and Midwest. Two years later, Apple South decided to divest all of its 264 Applebee's franchises (in a franchise system that had 960 units), along with its other franchise properties, to focus its efforts on the 120-unit Don Pablo's and the other company-owned chains. Shortly after the Applebee's restaurant divesture, Apple South changed its name to Avado Brands to emphasise the change of business. Things did not go as well as Avado had originally planned, and it filed for bankruptcy in 2004. At that time, it had 106 Don Pablo's. Avado exited bankruptcy a year later with 96 Don Pablo's in operation. After spending two years trying to revitalize the brand, Avado filed for bankruptcy for the second time in September 2007 and subsequently closed or sold about half of its 90 locations. In February 2008, 41 Don Pablo's locations were acquired by Rita Restaurant Corporation of Madison, Georgia, a fully owned subsidiary of DDJ Capital Management of Waltham, Massachusetts. Rita tried to revitalize the brand by closing under-performing locations and selling franchises. A franchise was sold to a Florida-based operator who re-opened a Don Pablo's in Sarasota, Florida, in 2012. The Sarasota location was the sole remaining franchise until it was finally closed in 2015. In 2014, the 34-unit chain was acquired by San Antonio-based Food Management Partners (FMP). FMP is also a franchise operator of Buffalo Wild Wings and several Italian restaurant chains. While FMP owned the company, locations were closed in February 2014 at Atlanta, Georgia; in August 2014 at Hobart, Indiana; in February 2015 at Canton, Ohio; in April 2015 at Flint, Michigan; in February 2016 at Greenville, South Carolina and Maple Grove, Minnesota; in August 2016 at Richfield, Minnesota and Newport, Kentucky; and in September 2016 at Beavercreek, Ohio and Owings Mills, Maryland. On October 4, 2016, Rita Restaurant Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after nearly cutting the number of Don Pablo's locations in half. At the time of the bankruptcy announcement, all four Indianapolis-area locations along with locations in Battle Creek, Michigan and Toledo, Ohio were immediately closed with little advance warning. At the time of the bankruptcy filing, there were 12 restaurants remaining. By November 2016, the Alexandria, Virginia location quietly disappeared from the Don Pablo's website. The Eden Prairie, Minnesota location quietly disappeared from the Don Pablo's website sometime between February and July 2017. The contents of the Eden Prairie restaurant was auctioned off in March. The Shelby Charter Township, Michigan location disappeared from the Don Pablo's website sometime between July 8 and July 19. In February 2018, the Don Pablo's location in Lafayette, Indiana quietly closed to leave 8 remaining locations. In April 2018, the Grand Prairie, Texas location quietly closed its doors to leave the number of locations at 7 by May 2018. In July 2018, the Norwood, Ohio location closed its doors to leave a total number of 6 locations. At the time of the closing, the remaining locations were in the states of Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, and Texas. Two months later, the Christiana, Delaware restaurant was closed in September 2018 to leave just 5 restaurants in three states.. In early November 2018, the Moorestown, New Jersey, restaurant closed for the final time and about the same time, the listing for the Fort Worth, Texas, restaurant disappeared from the Don Pablo's website to leave three locations in the states of Maryland, New Jersey, and Texas remaining in the failing chain. Just two and a half weeks later, the Baltimore location, the last location in Maryland, was closed just days before Thanksgiving while the last Don Pablo's restaurant in Texas also disappeared from the website, leaving Deptford Township, New Jersey as the last one in business. The Deptford location finally closed in June 2019.

Development and design Built to replace the Consolidated NY-2 and NY-3, the N3N was successfully tested as both a conventional airplane and a seaplane. The seaplane used a single float under the fuselage and floats under the outer tips of the lower wing. The conventional airplane used a fixed landing gear. The prototype XN3N-1 was powered by a Wright J-5 radial engine. An order for 179 production aircraft was received. Near the end of the first production run the engine was replaced with the Wright R-760-2 Whirlwind radial. The aircraft is constructed of metal using bolts and rivets rather than the more common welded steel tubing fuselages. Early production models used aluminum stringers formed for cancelled airship construction orders. Operational history NAF N3N-3 flown privately in Florida in 1972 The N.A.F. built 997 N3N aircraft beginning in . They included 179 N3N-1s and 816 N3N-3s, plus their prototypes. Production ended in 1942, but the type remained in use through the rest of World War II. The N3N was the last biplane in US military service - the last (used by the U.S. Naval Academy for aviation familiarization) were retired in 1959. The N3N was also unique in that it was an aircraft designed and manufactured by an aviation firm wholly owned and operated by the U.S. government (the Navy, in this case) as opposed to private industry. For this purpose, the U.S. Navy bought the rights and the tooling for the Wright R-760 series engine and produced their own engines. These Navy- built engines were installed on Navy-built airframes. According to Trimble, \\"The N3N-3, sometimes known as the Yellow Bird for its distinctive, high- visibility paint scheme, or less kindly, Yellow Peril for the jeopardy in which student aviators often found themselves, showed itself to be rugged, reliable, and generally forgiving to student pilots.\\" Four N3N-3s were delivered to the United States Coast Guard in . Postwar, many surviving aircraft were sold on the US civil aircraft market and bought for operation by agricultural aerial spraying firms and private pilot owners. A number are still (as of 2014) active in the USA.

Paga is the capital of Kassena Nankana West District, a district in the Upper East region of north Ghana. The town is located on the border of Burkina Faso and is 166 km south of Ouagadougou via the N5 highway, the main road linking Ghana and Burkina Faso.  Overview  Paga is known for its sacred crocodile ponds, where most visitors are surprised that they can touch a live crocodile. Paga is a small town in the Upper East Region, and has a population of about 10,000. However, the entire population of Paga ‚Äì including its outskirts ‚Äì is over 100,000. Most of the inhabitants are farmers of the Kassena ethnic group, whose settlements and familial ties stretch over the colonial borders of Ghana into what is now Burkina Faso. The idea of different nationalities mean little to these people, who see their shared ancestry and ethnicity before what is the recent concept of nationality or religion. Many Kassenas in this small town Paga are multilingual, speaking their native Kasem and English among other languages.  Foundation  According to legend, Paga was founded c. 1400 by a young man named Naveh, who was saved by a crocodile while on a hunting expedition. He then left his village and settled in the place which is now Paga. The founder of the town, Naveh, when searching for a desirable place to settle, exclaimed 'Ayipaga' which means 'My eye is fixed on this land'. The place came to be called by that name, which in due course was shortened to 'Paga'.Kassena Nankana West District  References  External links  * Ghana-pedia website - Paga Category:Populated places in the Upper East Region ","title":"Paga"},{"id":"2010518","text":"The Royal Economic Society (RES) is a professional association that promotes the study of economic science in academia, government service, banking, industry, and public affairs. Originally established in 1890 as the British Economic Association, it was incorporated by royal charter on December 2, 1902. The society is a charity registered with the U.K. Charity Commission under charity number 231508. The society is led by an Executive Committee that is responsible for developing and executing the society's policies and activities. The Society's current president is Prof Carol Propper. In addition, the RES supports a number of committees, including the Women‚Äôs Committee and the Conference of Heads of University Departments of Economics (CHUDE). The RES has two peer-reviewed publications: The Economic Journal, first published in 1891, and The Econometrics Journal, first published in 1998. Both journals are available online through the RES website. The Society's other activities include an annual conference, providing grants for training and special projects, and conducting various outreach activities, including an annual public lecture and an essay competition for young economists. In 2017, the society created a centralised office in Westminster, London, and appointed its first Chief Executive, Leighton Chipperfield. In 2019, the Society launched a new strategy with a greater focus on promoting the discipline and improving diversity. The RES subsequently announced the launch of Discover Economics, a campaign geared to changing perceptions of economics among young people and attracting students from under-represented groups  History  British Economic Association was founded in response to changing attitudes towards economics in the 1880s. Up until that point, the study of economics was typically taught as part of a broad curriculum, alongside subjects such as history and philosophy,Alon Kadish and Richard D. Freeman, ‚ÄòFoundation and Early Years‚Äô, in A Century of Economics: 100 Years of the Royal Economic Society and the Economic Journal, John D. Hey and Donald Winch (eds), (Oxford: Blackwell, 1990), p.22-24 and those engaging in the study of economics came from a number of professions and academic disciplines. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, there were academic movements to clearly demarcate and to define disciplines as scholarly subjects in their own right. For example, those in the fields of history and philosophy inaugurated such journals as The English Historical Review (1886) and Mind (1887), publications aimed mainly at their respective areas of study. Economic thinkers followed this example. The same period also saw the revival of fundamentalist, socialist critique of economics. In order to protect the discipline from damaging criticism while still encouraging intellectual discussion, many economic thinkers strove to draw economics more decidedly within the realm of scholarly debate. The establishment of an economic society in this era of change indicated a desire to strengthen economics as a well- respected academic discipline, and to encourage debate and research between specialist scholars. In an announcement to the American Economic Association dated 1887 which proposed the formation of an Economic Society in Britain, scholars acknowledged common criticisms of economics and the contemporary disunity in the discipline. They called for a society which would aim to advance theory, consolidate economic opinion, encourage historical research, and critique industrial and financial policy.Herbert Somerton Foxwell, \\"The Economic Movement in England\\", Quarterly Journal of Economics, 2 (1887), p.103 = Initial proposals for a society = Initial proposals for a British Society of Economics were drafted as early as 1883. Discussion began between Herbert Somerton Foxwell and Sir Robert Harry Inglis Palgrave. Palgrave had suggested creating a society specializing in the publication of translations and reprints of significant economic works. However, Foxwell had a more ambitious scheme in mind - a society that published a quarterly journal along the lines of the Quarterly Journal of Economics or the Journal des √âconomistes.A. W. Coats \\"The Origins and Early Development of the Royal Economic Society\\", The Economic Journal, 78 (1968), 349-371, p.35 There is no doubt that Foxwell's plans were influenced by foreign models, such as the German body Verein f√ºr Socialpolitik, founded in 1887, the French journals, the Journal des √âconomistes and the Revue d'Economie Politique established in 1841 and 1887, and the American Economic Association inaugurated in 1885.Winch, Donald 'A Century of Economics' in Hey, J.D. and Winch D. Eds, A Century of Economics: 100 Years of the Royal Economic Society, (London: Blackwell, 1990), p.7 Indeed, in 1887, Foxwell published an announcement in the Association‚Äôs publication saying \\"it is scarcely doubtful that we shall shortly follow the lead so ably set us on your side of the Atlantic.\\" As the discipline of economics was promoted and strengthened in America and Europe, scholars in the U.K. recognized an increasing urgency to ensure that British economic thought was represented. Certainly, Foxwell was not the only economist to propose the establishment of a scholarly journal in Britain. The Economic Review was established by scholars in Oxford in 1889, the year before the British Economic Association was inaugurated in London, and its publication, The Economic Journal, was set up.A. W. Coats \\"The Origins and Early Development of the Royal Economic Society\\", The Economic Journal, 78 (1968), 349-371, p.355 While there was a recognized need for a society of economists in the 1880s, it took a considerable time for Foxwell‚Äôs plans to come to fruition. One of the reasons for the delay was Alfred Marshall (1842-1924), Professor at Cambridge. Foxwell and Palgrave were keen to involve Marshall in the development of the association and its publication. Marshall was fully supportive of their plans, but as preparations progressed, he became preoccupied in completing his Principles of Economics. His former pupil, Edward Gonner, tried to encourage Marshall to participate in discussions to finalise the society but was unable to drive Marshall to action. He remarked to Foxwell that: > ... for the next two years or so the matter must rest in abeyance unless > active measures be taken. Of course, I know he will be glad if such be done > and I am sure he will render assistance but he will not take the > initiative.Alon Kadish and Richard D. Freeman, ‚ÄòFoundation and Early Years‚Äô, > in A Century of Economics: 100 Years of the Royal Economic Society and the > Economic Journal, John D. Hey and Donald Winch (eds), (Oxford: Blackwell, > 1990), pp.28-31 Gonner and Foxwell had to move on with the foundation of the society without Marshall. Marshall was only drawn back into the discussion when proposals for the nature of the society did not meet his approval. =Nature of the society= There had been much debate about what kind of society should be formed. Palgrave, Foxwell, and Marshall had discussed the idea that an economic journal should be attached to the Royal Statistical Society. But after some negative discussions with the society, the idea was dropped.A. W. Coats 'The Origins and Early Development of the Royal Economic Society', The Economic Journal, 78 (1968), 349-371, p.351-2 Marshall had hoped the group would come together naturally, centred around scholars at Cambridge. Gonner, however, wanted the society to be an honoured institution of scholars. He argued that members should be selected \\"not for an interest in economics but for work.\\" \\"Some scientific qualification\\" should also be essential for membership. Foxwell seems to have agreed with this approach. However, Marshall opposed the idea. He explained to Foxwell: \\"I don‚Äôt want to include 'mere' businessmen. But I don‚Äôt want to exclude Bank Directors and others of the class who are for me, at least, the most interesting members of the Political Economy Club...It is men of affairs from whom I learn\\". Marshall succeeded in persuading his friends. At its inauguration the society was made available to all those with an interest in economics, regardless of their scholarly qualifications. =Finding an editor= The inclusive attitude of society membership was also extended to the aims of its proposed journal. It was agreed that the publication should provide a forum for all views and opinions. The criteria for selection in the journal would be scholarly excellence, not political or scholarly persuasion.Francis Ysidro Edgeworth, \\"The British Economic Association\\", The Economic Journal, 1 (1891), p.1 However, there was much difficulty in finding a suitable editor to manage such a journal. Foxwell had favoured the appointment of John Neville Keynes as editor, but he was not available. Foxwell admitted that without Keynes, the appointment was a difficult one: > ...any number of men with strong views will volunteer, but these are just > the persons we don‚Äôt want. We want cool heads, keen brains and impartial > judgement. With these are required scholarship, information and, if > possible, a knowledge of German. It seems to me a most difficult and > delicate post.A. W. Coats \\"The Origins and Early Development of the Royal > Economic Society\\", The Economic Journal, 78 (1968), 349-371, p.353 The search for an editor caused serious delays. It was not until 1890, the year of the society‚Äôs inauguration, that Francis Ysidro Edgeworth was appointed editor. Edgeworth held a chair in Economics at King's College London and was appointed Drummond Professor of Political Economy at Oxford University in 1891. Though his academic standing made him an excellent candidate for the role, Edgeworth admitted the difficulties of establishing a new journal: > I wrote to Marshall asking advice on every small difficulty which arose, > until he protested that, if the correspondence was to go on at that rate, he > would have to use envelopes with my address printed on them.A. W. Coats \\"The > Origins and Early Development of the Royal Economic Society\\", The Economic > Journal, 78 (1968), 349-371, p.362 Despite initial difficulties, Edgeworth‚Äôs editorship was highly successful and he remained editor for the next 34 years.Past Editors Since 1891. Royal Economic Society Website. Retrieved 17 July 2013 =Inauguration of the society= After years of discussion and delay, the British Economic Association (BEA) was inaugurated at University College London on 20 November 1890. Alfred Marshall wrote a letter of invitation to scholars and businessmen interested in economics, drawing around 200 people to the meeting. In the letter, Marshall set out the central aims of the society, to encourage debate and enable the dissemination of economic research through the medium of a British academic journal. Attendees unanimously showed their support for the plans. Edgeworth was formally appointed as editor of The Economic Journal. George Goschen, Second Viscount Goschen, the statesman and businessman, was selected as president of the society. George Bernard Shaw politely questioned the suitability of \\"a gentleman who was identified with any political party in the state\\" as head of the society, but Marshall responded: > I am one of those who am not in political support of Mr. Goschen. I believe > all agree with me that since we cannot have an economist who has no > political opinions at all; we could not have a better President than Mr. > Goschen.A. W. Coats \\"The Origins and Early Development of the Royal Economic > Society\\", The Economic Journal, 78 (1968), 349-371, p.357 =Early years= After the elections, the BEA wasted no time in carrying out its aims to publish a journal. The first issue of The Economic Journal was printed in March 1891, with the editor‚Äôs promise that: > The most opposite doctrines may meet here as on a fair field...Opposing > theories of currency will be represented with equal impartiality. Nor will > it be attempted to prescribe the method, any more than the result, of > scientific investigation. While The Economic Journal provided an outlet for the scholarly assessment of economic theory and policy, and helped to establish economics as a distinct and significant area of research, the BEA was slow to make an impact on the development of economics in other areas. As president, Goschen demonstrated a vehement desire to improve the status of economics in public opinion. At the inaugural council meeting, he warned of a \\"general idea that economists had finished their proper work in the education of the nation.\\" At the BEA annual dinner in 1895, he argued that economics \\"was not treated with the respect accorded to other sciences.\\"Alon Kadish and Richard D. Freeman, ‚ÄòFoundation and Early Years‚Äô, in A Century of Economics: 100 Years of the Royal Economic Society and the Economic Journal, John D. Hey and Donald Winch (eds), (Oxford: Blackwell, 1990), pp.33-35 But despite Goschen‚Äôs vocal concern, the BEA could not make an immediate impact. The council made a bid to the Council of Legal Education to add economics to its subject of instruction, but failed to succeed in this endeavour. The slow progress of the BEA in its early years may be explained by the difficulties in establishing a financially viable association and journal. Membership fluctuated considerably in the first ten years, rising to a high of 750 members in 1893-4 before falling by around 40 per cent between 1892 and 1900. During this period, it was necessary to reconsider the printing arrangements of the Journal to ensure the financial stability of the association. In time, the association established itself as a stable and successful economic institution. By the beginning of World War II, membership had risen to over 4,500 under the management of John Maynard Keynes.Winch, Donald 'Wealth and Life: Essays on the Intellectual History of Political Economy in Britain 1848‚Äì1914, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009), pp.359ff Aside from the impact of successive presidents and editors, it is possible that the application for royal charter in 1900 had some effect on this gradual improvement, establishing the BEA as a well- respected and significant economic institution. =Royal Charter= The secretary of the BEA, Henry Higgs, proposed that the council apply for royal charter ten years after its inauguration. Ten volumes of the Economic Journal were presented to King Edward VII, with the request that he become Patron of the Society.Alon Kadish and Richard D. Freeman, ‚ÄòFoundation and Early Years‚Äô, in A Century of Economics: 100 Years of the Royal Economic Society and the Economic Journal, John D. Hey and Donald Winch (eds), (Oxford: Blackwell, 1990), p.43 Royal charter was duly granted on 2 December 1902. The charter indicated the society‚Äôs work to further economic science, its collection of a specialist library and its publication of a journal, saying: > And whereas in order to secure the property of the said society, to extend > its operations, and to give it its due position among the Scientific > Institutions of Our Kingdom, we have been besought to grant George Joachim > Viscount Goschen, and to those who now are members of the said society, or > who shall from time to time be elected Fellows of the Royal Economic Society > hereby incorporated, Our Royal Charter of Incorporation for the purposes > aforesaid.\\"The Royal Economic Society Charter of Incorporation\\", The > Economic Journal, 13 (1903), 1-5, p.2 The British Economic Association, on accepting the royal charter, became the Royal Economic Society.

Retrieved 17 June 2013. Today, the RES conference is an annual event, attracting over 400 presenters speaking on varied topics over several days. The RES established activities to support economists at every stage in their career. The RES Annual Policy Lecture, established in 2001, aimed to expose sixth form students and members of the general public to the research of top economists. The Young Economist of the Year essay competition initiated in 2007, its purpose being to encourage young students to think critically about key economic issues. The Austin Robinson Prize (2007), given to the best paper published in The Economic Journal by an author within five years of completing their Ph.D., was instituted to support the development of early-career scholars. The RES Prize (1990), given annually to the best paper published in The Economic Journal, was set up to celebrate the work of established economists. In 1987, the Conference Heads of University Departments of Economics was established to bring together heads of Economic departments with the aim of promoting the teaching and studying of Economics in the UK. In addition to these initiatives, the RES founded the Women‚Äôs Committee in 1996, developed to promote the role of women in the UK economics profession, with a particular concern for career entrants. One of the most significant of the Royal Economic Society‚Äôs recent activities was the inauguration of The Econometrics Journal (EctJ) in 1998. Recognizing the need for a journal dedicated to econometric research, the RES established the EctJ, with the aim of creating a top international field journal for the publication of macro- micro, and financial econometrics. In 2011 the editors of The Econometrics Journal initiated the annual Denis Sargan Econometrics Prize, awarded annually to the best article published in journal.

Brill, 1976), 107. Artukid ruler of Mardin from 1107 to 1122.  Biography  His father Artuk Bey was the founder of the Artukid dynasty, and had been appointed governor of Jerusalem by the Seljuq emir Tutush. When Artuk died, Ilghazi and his brother S√∂kmen succeeded him as governors of Jerusalem. In 1096 Ilghazi allied with Duqaq of Damascus and Yaghi-Siyan of Antioch against Radwan of Aleppo; Duqaq and Radwan were fighting for control of Syria after the death of Tutush. Ilghazi and Dukak eventually quarrelled and Ilghazi was imprisoned, leading to the capture of Jerusalem by his brother S√∂kmen, but Ilgazi recovered the city when he was released. He held it until the city was captured by the Fatimid vizier of Egypt, al-Afdal Shahanshah, in 1098. After this he sought to make a name for himself in the Jezirah, where his brothers had also established themselves. He then entered the service of the Seljuq sultan Mahmud I, who granted him Hulwan and made him shihna of Baghdad, an office which oversaw the affairs of the caliph on behalf of the sultan. Ilghazi was dismissed as shihna in 1104 and became leader of the Artukid family after the death of S√∂kmen that year. This was disputed by S√∂kmen's son Ibrahim, but Ilghazi took Mardin from him in 1108. As head of the Artukids he made no lasting alliances and frequently switched sides, allying with both fellow Muslims and Christian crusaders whenever he saw fit. In 1110 he participated in an unsuccessful siege of Edessa. In 1114 he and his nephew Balak (future emir of Aleppo) defeated the Seljuq governor of Mosul, Aqsunqur al-Bursuqi, and captured Mas'ud, son of the Seljuq sultan. In 1115 Ilghazi besieged Homs, but was captured briefly by its governor Khir-Khan. Later that year, Roger of Antioch, Baldwin I of Jerusalem, Pons of Tripoli, and Baldwin II of Edessa defended Antioch against the Seljuq general Bursuq ibn Bursuq (not to be confused with al-Bursuki), with the aid of Ilghazi, Toghtekin of Damascus, and Lulu of Aleppo, all enemies of Bursuk. These two armies did not come to battle, although Bursuk was later defeated by Roger at the Battle of Sarmin. Ilghazi gained control of Aleppo after the assassination of Lulu in 1117. In 1118 he took control of Mayyafiriqin and pacified the surrounding countryside. In 1119 Ilghazi defeated and killed Roger at the Battle of Ager Sanguinis;The Lords of Le Puiset on the Crusades, John L. La Monte, Speculum, Vol. 17, No. 1 (Jan., 1942), 106. Ibn al-Qalanisi describes the victory as \\"one of the finest of victories, and such plenitude of divine aid was never granted to Islam in all its past ages.\\" The Antiochene towns of Atharib, Zerdana, Sarmin, Ma'arrat al-Numan and Kafartab fell to his army. \\"Il Ghazi, however, was unable to extract full profit from his victory. His prolonged drunkenness deprived his army of leadership, and left the Turkmens free to ... scatter after plunder.\\"Smail, p 30 Baldwin II (now Baldwin II of Jerusalem) soon arrived to drive Ilghazi back, inflicting heavy losses on the Turks in the hard-fought Battle of Hab on August 14, 1119. The next year Ilghazi took Nisibin, and then pillaged the County of Edessa before turning north towards Armenia. In 1121 he made peace with the crusaders, and with supposedly up to 250 000 - 350 000 troops, including men led by his son- in-law Sadaqah and Sultan Malik of Ganja, he invaded Georgia. David IV of Georgia met him at the Battle of Didgori and Ilgazi was defeated. According to Matthew of Edessa 400 000 Seljuks were killed. Among the various leaders, only Ilghazi and his son-in-law Dubais escaped. In 1122 Ilghazi and Balak defeated Joscelin I of Edessa and took him prisoner, but Ilgazi died in November of that year at Diyarbekir. He was buried at Mayyafariqin (Silvan today). Balak succeeded him in Aleppo and his sons Sulaiman and Timurtash succeeded him in Mardin. Ibn al-Qalanisi is generally neutral on the character of Ilghazi, and describes only one \\"disgraceful habit\\" of the emir: \\"Now when Ilghazi drank wine and it got the better of him, he habitually remained for several days in a state of intoxication, without recovering his senses sufficiently to take control or to be consulted on any matter or decision.\\" The Antiochene chronicler Walter the Chancellor was at first also neutral towards Ilghazi, until the Battle of Ager Sanguinis, in which Walter himself was captured; Ilghazi (written as \\"Algazi\\" in Latin) is then described as a \\"tyrant\\" and the \\"prince of the delusion and dissent of the Turcomans.\\" Walter also remarks on Ilghazi's drunkenness. Family and issue Ilghazi married first Farkhunda Khatun, the daughter of Radwan of Aleppo, but he never actually met her and the marriage was never consummated. He then married the daughter of Toghtekin of Damascus and had the following children: * Ayaz * Guhar Khatun, married Dubais * al-Bazm * Shams ad-Daula Sulaiman * Safra Khatun, married Husam ad- Din Qurti ibn Toghlan Arslan * Yumna Khatun, married Sa'd ad-Daula Il-aldi of Amid * al-Sa'id Husam ad-Din Timurtash He also had a son, Umar, by a concubine, and Nasr, by a slave; another possible son was named Kirzil.

After starting his career with local clubs near his home town of Blackpool, in 1932 he was signed by First Division Manchester City, with whom he played his entire professional career. Swift broke into the Manchester City first team in 1933, taking part in the club's run to the 1934 FA Cup Final, where the club triumphed 2‚Äì1 against Portsmouth. Three years later Swift won a League Championship medal, after playing in every match of Manchester City's championship-winning season. War denied Swift several years of playing in his prime, though during wartime he was chosen to represent his country in international matches. After the war he made his competitive international debut, playing 19 internationals between 1946 and 1949. Swift retired in 1949, taking up a career in journalism as a football correspondent for the News of the World. He died, aged 44, in the Munich air disaster after reporting on Manchester United's European Cup match against Red Star Belgrade. Club careerEarly career and 1930s successes= Born in Blackpool, a coastal town in north-west England, Swift's first club was Blackpool Gas Works, where he worked as a coke-keeper. A spell at nearby Fleetwood followed, during which Swift attracted interest from a number of Football League clubs. Potential suitors included Blackpool (where Frank's elder brother Fred was the goalkeeper), Blackburn Rovers, Bradford City and Manchester City.James, The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame, p. 68. The first to offer Swift a contract were Manchester City, who played in the First Division, the highest level of English football. Initially signed as an amateur in October 1932, eighteen-year-old Swift turned professional the following month, receiving a wage of ten shillings (50p) per week. The following December he was called up to the first team, having previously made only three reserve team appearances. At this time, goalkeeper was an unsettled position for Manchester City. Len Langford had made over 100 appearances and had appeared in the 1933 FA Cup Final, which City lost 3‚Äì0 to Everton. He missed the final game of the 1932‚Äì33 season and the opening match of 1933‚Äì34, but went on to play 18 consecutive League games before injury on 16 December 1933 ended his time as City's first choice. Langford's replacement for the following game was James Nicholls, but he endured a torrid time as Manchester City lost 8‚Äì0 to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Consequently, Swift was given an opportunity for the Christmas double-header against Derby County. He conceded four goals in his debut at the Baseball Ground on 25 December, but in the return match the next day, his 20th birthday, he kept a clean sheet in a 2‚Äì0 win. After making his debut, Swift played in every first team match for more than four seasons, a run of more than 200 consecutive matches. His only absence prior to the suspension of football due to World War II was a single match in September 1938, where without Swift, Manchester City lost 6‚Äì1 at home to Millwall.James, Manchester City ‚Äì The Complete Record, p. 354. Though Swift quickly established himself as a fixture in the Manchester City first team line-up, his performances were not all positive. In one of his early matches, against West Bromwich Albion, Swift conceded seven goals.Ward, The Manchester City Story, p33 This led Swift to believe he would not be picked again, but with Langford unavailable due to a knee injury, Swift kept his place. Despite inconsistency, Manchester City were one of the stronger sides of the 1930s, and in Swift's first season the club reached the FA Cup final for the second successive year. This period saw football match attendances reach an all-time high. During the cup run Swift played in front of 84,569 people for Stoke City's visit to Maine Road, a record attendance for an English club ground which still stands today.James, Manchester City ‚Äì The Complete Record, p. 90. Hillsborough's attendance record of 72,841 (receipts ¬£5,566) was also set by City during this Cup run. The semi-final, against cup favourites Aston Villa, ended in a 6‚Äì1 victory, a record for an FA Cup semi-final.James, Manchester City ‚Äì The Complete Record, p46 In the final, Manchester City faced Portsmouth. Swift, the youngest and most inexperienced of the team, was nervous. As the playing surface was wet, he was unsure whether or not to wear gloves. Seeing Portsmouth goalkeeper Jock Gilfillan take to the field without gloves, he decided to follow suit. Portsmouth took the lead in the first half through a Septimus Rutherford shot. At half time Swift slumped in the dressing room, blaming himself and his decision not to wear gloves for the goal. Forward Fred Tilson attempted to improve Swift's spirits by telling him not to worry as he would \\"plonk two in next half\\".James, Manchester City ‚Äì The Complete Record, p. 117. Tilson duly scored two second half goals, the second with less than five minutes remaining. A tense finish followed, in which a photographer behind Swift's goal gave regular updates of the time remaining. At the final whistle, Swift was so overcome with emotion that he fainted. He recovered in time to receive his winners' medal from George V, who sent a telegram enquiring about his condition on the following Monday. Manchester City started the 1936‚Äì37 season poorly, and were in the bottom half of the table until December. The club were better known for goalscoring than solid defence, but frequently both eluded City; at one point the club gained just one win in twelve matches.James, Manchester City ‚Äì The Complete Record, p. 350. However, Christmas proved to be a turning point for the club. Swift conceded five goals in consecutive matches on 19 and 25 December, but a Boxing Day win against Middlesbrough was the start of a long unbeaten run.Ward, The Manchester City Story, p. 36. By April City were second in the table, and faced a fixture against Arsenal, league leaders and the dominant club of the period.James, Manchester City ‚Äì The Complete Record, p47 Peter Doherty inspired the team to a 2‚Äì0 win, and City reached the top of the table. The unbeaten run continued until the end of the season, and City secured their first league championship with a 4‚Äì1 win over Sheffield Wednesday. City's third goal in this match came as the result of a long clearance by Swift, who was noted for the distance he could propel the ball.James, Manchester City ‚Äì The Complete Record, p. 120. In contrast to the championship win, the 1937‚Äì38 season was one of disappointment. Manchester City achieved several high scoring wins, including two 7‚Äì1 scorelines, but frequently stuttered to defeat.Ward, The Manchester City Story, p. 38. On the final day of the season the club faced Huddersfield Town, and went into the match four places clear of the relegation zone. A 1‚Äì0 defeat, coupled with wins for all four of the teams immediately below meant reigning champions City were relegated to the Second Division despite scoring more goals than any other team.James, Manchester City ‚Äì The Complete Record, p. 352. =Wartime and later career= During the Second World War, Swift continued to play regularly for City, making 134 wartime league appearances. He also joined the British Army, and was one several professional footballers to enlist at the Army School of Physical Training as part of a scheme devised by the FA. The school was based near Aldershot F.C. leading Swift to become one of several notable players to guest for the club. Others included Matt Busby, Jimmy Hagan, Joe Mercer, Stan Cullis, Cliff Britton and Tommy Lawton. He also guested for several other clubs during the war including Liverpool. He also played for several representative sides. On 30 October 1943 at Ninian Park, Swift played for a Western Command XI against a Cardiff City XI which featured Lawton and Mercer as guests. The game was a fundraiser for Royal Artillery prisoners of war. In April 1944 in Edinburgh he played for a British Army XI that included Jack Rowley, Leslie Compton, Cullis, Mercer, Hagan and Lawton and against a Royal Air Force XI that included Peter Doherty, Stanley Matthews and Ted Drake. The Army won 4‚Äì0. On 9 September 1944 at Windsor Park he played for a Combined Services XI in an 8‚Äì4 win against Ireland. This team was in effect a Great Britain XI and featured, among others, Busby, Matthews, Lawton, Mullen, Raich Carter and Stan Mortensen. In the same year he also represented an FA Services XI in games against France and Belgium. In May 1945 Swift also travelled with a British Army XI on a European tour.Anton Rippon Gas Masks for Goal Posts (2005)Who's Who Of Liverpool (2006): Tony MatthewsEngland wartime results at RsssfSoccer at War ‚Äì 1939 ‚Äì 45 (2005): Jack Rollin In the first season after the Second World War, Manchester City won the Second Division championship to secure their return to the top flight. In the process Swift kept a club record 17 clean sheets in 35 appearances, a mark which was not surpassed until nearly 40 years later, when Alex Williams broke the record by keeping 20 clean sheets in 1985. By 1949 Swift was 35 years old, but was still performing well enough to maintain his place in the England team. However, he decided that he wanted to retire while still capable of playing at the top level, rather than fading away. To this end he announced that he would retire at the end of the 1948‚Äì49 season. He made what he intended to be his last Manchester City appearance against Huddersfield Town on 7 May,James, The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame, p74 which was followed by a parade in his honour organised by the Supporters' Club. However, just before the next season started, Swift's replacement Alec Thurlow fell ill with tuberculosis, and Swift agreed to step in until City found a new goalkeeper.Ward, The Manchester City Story, p41 Four further appearances took his career total to 338. Aware of attempts by other clubs to tempt Swift out of retirement, most notably by Manchester United, the Manchester City board continued to hold Swift's playing registration for several years.James, Manchester City ‚Äì The Complete Record, p160 After football Following a period serving as a director of a local catering company, Swift took up a career in journalism, most notably with the News of the World. He continued to be a regular visitor to Maine Road, and became the president of the Supporters' Club. Swift died, aged 44, in the Munich air disaster after reporting on Manchester United's European Cup match against Red Star Belgrade in Belgrade, Yugoslavia for the News of the World. On 6 February 1958, the flight back to Manchester carrying the Manchester United team and journalists made a refuelling stop at Munich- Riem Airport in poor weather. Two take-off attempts were abandoned due to engine problems, with the weather continuing to deteriorate. On the third attempt, slush on the runway prevented the aircraft from reaching the required speed for take-off. The plane veered off the runway and crashed into a house. One of 23 victims of the disaster, Swift was one of two journalists pulled alive from the wreckage but died on his way to hospital, as his seat belt had cut into his aorta. Swift is widely regarded as one of the best English goalkeepers of all time along with Gordon Banks and Peter Shilton and is frequently noted as one of the best players to have graced the English football league. His successor in the Manchester City team was fellow club and goalkeeping legend, Bert Trautmann. Swift was named as one of the Football League 100 Legends in 1998 celebrating 100 seasons of league football in England, alongside other Manchester City players Billy Meredith, Colin Bell and Bert Trautmann. He has also been inducted into the Manchester City Hall of Fame. International career Swift's first international call-ups came in the Second World War; he made 14 wartime appearances for England. The first official England international after the war took place on 28 September 1946 against Ireland, and Swift retained his place to make his full debut in a 7‚Äì2 victory. Swift became a fixture in the England side of the late 1940s, playing 17 consecutive matches. This run included the famous 1948 victory against Italy in Turin, where he became the first goalkeeper since Alexander Morten in 1873 to captain the side, leading him to describe the match as the greatest day of his career.James, The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame, p71 Later that year he lost his place to Ted Ditchburn, despite keeping a clean sheet in his previous appearance. He was restored to the line-up the following match, a British Home Championship decider against Scotland. After announcing his retirement from football, he made a farewell appearance against Norway in May 1949 to take his number of caps to 19, after which the goalkeeper's jersey was taken by Bert Williams.Clayton, Manchester City's Cult Heroes, p19 Swift also represented Great Britain in a 1947 match against a \\"Rest of Europe\\" team, played to celebrate the return of the Home Nations to FIFA. Playing style Raich Carter once said of Frank Swift that he looked so big in goal that as a forward it often seemed that trying to score against him was like trying to put the ball into a matchbox. Swift's hands, which had a finger span of , were sufficiently large for him to easily pick up the ball with one hand, and gave rise to the nickname \\"Frying Pan Hands\\". Swift kicked with his left foot as the result of an injury to his right foot sustained during his youth. However, where possible he preferred throwing the ball to the wing over kicking it downfield. When asked for advice to give to young goalkeepers, Swift replied that he drew diagrams of each goal scored against him to see if he was at fault.Clayton, Manchester City's Cult Heroes, p18 Outside football Swift had three brothers, Cuthbert, Fred and Alf, and one sister, Alice. Fred, also a goalkeeper, played for Bolton Wanderers amongst others. The five grew up in a house a short walk from Blackpool's Bloomfield Road ground. During football's off-season, Frank and Alf ran boat trips off the Blackpool coast for tourists. On one such trip he met his future wife, Doris Potter. They married at Blackpool in 1935. They had a daughter, Jean, who was born in 1936, and a son, David, who was born in 1948. During wartime, Swift became a special constable with responsibility for traffic control. He was enrolled in the RAF, and travelled to France after the Invasion of Normandy, but was stationed well behind the front line and did not see combat. This did not prevent risk to his life, however, as in 1944 a Dakota on which he was a passenger was involved in a near miss. Several members of Swift's family attended the February 2008 Manchester derby, played in the week of the 50th anniversary of the Munich air disaster. The game, at Old Trafford, was won by Manchester City; the minute's silence was fully observed by the Manchester City fans. Towards the end of the game, the City fans chanted \\"There's only one Frank Swift\\" several times, to rounds of applause from the United fans.

Tia Maria is a dark liqueur made originally in Jamaica using Jamaican coffee beans, but now made in Italy. The main flavour ingredients are coffee beans, Jamaican rum, vanilla, and sugar, blended to an alcoholic content of 20%. History The historical fable of its origins dates it to the 18th century. A young Spanish girl was forced to flee Jamaica, and the family plantation during a conflict. She was accompanied by a sole female servant who carried a bit of jewelry and the recipe for the family liqueur. In honor of the woman's help, the girl named the liqueur \\"Tia Maria\\" (tia is Spanish for \\"aunt\\"), her name for the woman who had helped save her life. One account of its history says that a man named Dr. Evans discovered the drink after World War II, and he began reproducing it. This story of Dr. Evans' devotion to the drink is part of the official website's history, however. According to some sources, it was actually created in Jamaica in the 1930s. The Jamaican company Lascelles deMercado producer of Appleton Rum supposedly manufactured the concentrate from which the liqueur was made, at least, up until the time it was sold by Pernod. As recently as the 1980s, Tia Maria was made with an alcohol concentration of 31.5% and positioned as a premium liqueur compared to the substantially different product now produced at 20% ABV. The Tia Maria brand was bought by Pernod Ricard through their Malibu-Kahl√∫a International subsidiary in 2005. It was sold to Illva Saronno It. in July 2009. Following the sale, Chivas Brothers produced it for Saronno before production was transferred to Illva Saronno's distillery in Saronno, Italy. Bacardi U.S.A., Inc. distributed it in the U.S. for Saronno. As of Aug. 1, 2012, Kobrand became the distributor. Variations A bottle of Tia Maria at a grocery store in Argentina It can be consumed pure and with ice, but is also frequently used as an ingredient for cocktails (of which the Espresso Martini is popular), with coffee. It may also be mixed with milk and ice. Some cocktails include Tia Espresso Martini, Dark Tia made with dark rum, Tia Maria and cola, or the Skinny Tia White Russian, made with skim milk and Tia Maria, with a splash of vodka. Another cocktail, known as an 'Orgasm', which is Tia Maria mixed in equal parts with Bailey's or another Irish Cream.

Early life John Pope Hennessy was born in County Cork, the son of John Hennessy of Ballyhennessy, and educated at Queen's College, Cork. He completed his medical training at Queen's University of Ireland. Public service He started his Public Service career as the Supplemental Clerk at the Privy Council, and eventually became a minor Conservative member of the British Parliament, representing King's County from 1859 to 1865. Whilst an MP he studied law at the Inner Temple, being called to the bar in 1861. In 1890, as MP for North Kilkenny he joined the Irish National Federation. He died the following year. Early colonial service Ape in Vanity Fair, 1875 Hennessy eventually joined the Colonial Office and became colonial Governor of Labuan in 1867 where he put the Crown Colony into solvency by introducing convict labour from the Straits Settlements. He went on to become the Governor of Sierra Leone from 1872 to 1873, when he moved to the governorship of the Bahamas. He became Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands, from 1873 until 1877, with primary authority over Barbados, and executive oversight over the various British Lt. Governors and Administrators charged with running day-to-day affairs on the various islands. Although Hennessy was born into the Anglo-Irish landowning gentry, his status as a Roman Catholic made him something of an outsider, particularly in his dealings with Protestant British colonial elites, whether in Barbados, Hong Kong, or Mauritius. Indeed, his earliest contributions as a Member of Parliament in 1860 pertained to the temporal power of the Pope, and unfolding events in Italy.http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons Coming into colonial administration, he was among a cohort of \\"new thinkers\\" whose ideas gained ground following the Sepoy Mutiny in India in 1857. Speaking at length in the House of Commons on 26 July 1860 about British civil and military forces in India, Hennessy urged a shift in policies so that \\"the military administration of India would be conducted with greater skill, with more economy, and, as a natural result of a higher educational standard, with a greater regard for the feelings and interests of the Native population. Indeed, recent events furnished us with the most conclusive evidence that many of the British officers, entrusted with grave authority in India, had, from an ignorance of popular customs and a disregard of national habits and traditions, given great cause of complaint and encouragement to disaffection. As long as we send out officers to India who seem inclined to treat the Natives as slaves, who seem unable or unwilling to appreciate the noble qualities, of that unfortunate people, and who add the grossest military outrages and insults to the civil misgovernment and financial burdens we have imposed upon them, so long will our rule in India be a blot upon civilization\\".House of Commons debate, 26 July 1860, Hansards, Vol. 160, cc. 231-59, 235 Governor of Hong Kong Hawaiian King Kalakaua visits Hong Kong in 1881. Hennessy is sitting immediately to the left of the King Immediately after his tenure in Barbados, Hennessy was appointed as Governor of Hong Kong, a position from which he served until 1882. During his tenure, Hennessy realised that the Chinese people, who were treated as second-class citizens up to that time, had developed an increasingly important influence on the Hong Kong economy. With that in mind, he lifted the ban that forbade Chinese people from buying lands, constructing buildings, and operate businesses in the Central District. This caused a development boom in the Central District. Also, he allowed Chinese immigrants in Hong Kong to naturalise as British subjects. He appointed the first Chinese member (Ng Choy, who would later become the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China) to the Legislative Council. Also, during his rule, he established the first Grant-in- Aid system, a milestone in the educational history of Hong Kong. Soon after arriving in Hong Kong, in April 1877, Hennessy set out to implement the \\"separate system\\" in Victoria Gaol, meaning separate cells for prisoners, during the night if not also during the day. This plan hinged upon sending long-term prisoners to Labuan, for convict labour.Hong Kong Government Gazette, 23 February 1878 Governor of Mauritius After his tenure as Governor of Hong Kong was over, Hennessy went on to become the 15th Governor of Mauritius from 1 June 1883 to 11 December 1889. Upon his arrival on 1 June 1883 on the island, Hennessy undertook to mauricianise the local administration by reducing the powers of the English officials, appointing Mauritians to positions of responsibility and proposing a new constitution based on the principle \\"Mauritius for Mauritians\\". It was therefore natural that he moved closer to the Mauritian lawyer William Newton, leader of the reform movement who demanded a more direct involvement of settlers in the administration of their affairs. It was under Hennessy that Mauritius knew its first shudder of democracy. This was his last post in the Colonial Service. Personal life Hennessy's family Hennessy had two illegitimate daughters with his mistress, Miss A. M. Conyngham, before, on 4 February 1868, marrying Catherine \\"Kitty\\" Elizabeth Low (1850‚Äì1923), daughter of his predecessor (acting) Governor of Labuan. They had three sons, including Richard Pope- Hennessy.Stearn, Roger T. (2007). \\"Hennessy, Sir John Pope (1834‚Äì1891)\\". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford University Press. . Accessed 2 August 2018. Richard had two sons, John Wyndham Pope-Hennessy (1913‚Äì1994) and James Pope-Hennessy, author of a biography, Verandah, in 1964. His personal motto was \\"Three Grand Qualifications to Success\\", which he described as \\"The first is audacity, the second is audacity, and the third is audacity\\". Hennessy died of heart failure on 7 October 1891 at his residence, Rostellan Castle, near Cork, Ireland. Honours Sir John Pope Hennessy Governor of Mauritius, medal by Oscar Roty * (1880) Memorials As he was not popular among the European community of Hong Kong, there were no contemporary memorials there. However, on 14 June 1929, a main road located on the new reclamation was called Hennessy Road, and there is now also a crowded commercial and shopping area at Wan Chai and Causeway Bay on Hong Kong Island named after him. In Port Louis, capital of Mauritius, there is both a major street, Pope Hennessy Street, and a statue by M. Loumeau erected in 1908. Hennessy Road, a street in civil lines, Nagpur, Maharashtra state, India is also named after him.

The Naval Aircraft Factory SBN was a United States three-seat mid-wing monoplane scout bomber/torpedo aircraft designed by the Brewster Aeronautical Corporation and built under license by the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The landing gear was similar to that on the Brewster F2A Buffalo fighter aircraft. The SBN had non-folding wings with perforated flaps. Development The United States Navy issued specifications for a scout bomber in 1934 and Brewster won the competition. The Navy ordered one prototype, designated the XSBA-1, on 15 October 1934. It was a two-seat, single-engine monoplane with retractable landing gear and an internal bomb bay that could accommodate a 500-pound (227-kg) bomb.Polmar, Norman, \\"A Lackluster Performance: Part One,\\" Naval History, April 2017, p. 24. The crewman in the rear seat was armed with a flexible machine gun. The prototype XSBA-1 first flew on 15 April 1936,Swanborough and Bowers 1976, p.417. and was delivered to the Navy for testing. With a Wright R-1820-4 Cyclone 770-horsepower (570-kilowatt) engine, it achieved a top speed of 254 mph (409 km/hr), with an estimated range of 1,000 miles at cruising speed. Some minor problems were found during testing and less than a year after its first flight, the aircraft was given a revised tail and rudder and a more powerful Wright R-1820-22 Cyclone 950-horsepower (710-kilowatt) engine, with which it reached a top speed of 263 mph (424 km/hr). At the time, it was believed to be the fastest single-engine bomber in the world. Because of the pressures of developing and producing the Brewster F2A Buffalo fighter, Brewster was unable to manufacture any production models of the XSBA-1, and the Navy acquired a license to produce the aircraft itself at the Naval Aircraft Factory. In September 1938, the Navy placed an order for 30 production aircraft. Due to pressures of work at the NAF, it did not deliver the first aircraft, now designated the SBN, until November 1940; the remaining aircraft were delivered between June 1941 and March 1942. Operational history An SBN-1 in 1941. Most of the SBNs were delivered to Bombing Squadron 3 (VB-3) aboard the aircraft carrier . Obsolete before their delivery in 1941, some of the early production aircraft were used for carrier operations trials with Torpedo Squadron Eight (VT-8) in 1941 and then passed on for use as trainers aboard the aircraft carrier .

Assigned in 1926, it ran from San Jose to French Camp. It was the first US highway to be deleted in California and was one of the first few US highways to be deleted in the US. Route description SR 238 US 48 was a highway connecting the San Francisco Bay area with the San Joaquin Valley, traveling from San Jose to near Modesto, largely following the future routing of US 50, which replaced US 48. Its western terminus was located at former State Route 82 (SR 82), which was a former routing of US 101. From there, it head northeast on Downtown San Jose surface streets, roughly following the roads of Oakland Rd, Main St, and SR 238, eventually reaching the present day Interstate 580 (I-580), then east through the cities Pleasanton and Livermore on Castro Valley Rd, Dublin Canyon Rd, and Altamont Pass Rd. to the present- day separation between I-580 and I-205. From here, US 48 continued east on 11th St. (now I-205 Business (I-205 BUS)) through Tracy to former US 99W, now roughly I-5. It then followed US 99W northeast to Yosemite Ave, an old alignment of SR 120, where US 48 followed Yosemite Ave. to Main St, former US 99E, the location of its eastern terminus. History A 1925 article published in California Highways, the publication of the California Division of Highways, stated that the western terminus of US 48 was in San Jose. At some point between then and 1930, the terminus may have been set back to Hayward. The route was renumbered to an extension of US 50, which was extended along US 48 east of present-day SR 238. The remainder of US 48 became US 101E, later SR 17, then I-880. Major intersections This table refers to the route as it was in 1926.

This is a science fiction television episode of the Star Trek franchise, that aired on UPN on October 2, 1996. This features special effect sequences of wormholes, shuttlecraft, and an inhabited exoplanet. This episode has many guest stars that fill in as the inhabitants of the planet Voyager encounters. Plot Voyager discovers evidence of replicator technology on a planet with Bronze Age technology. Chakotay and Paris beam down to investigate. They discover two Ferengi posing as prophets who were foretold in the planet's mythology, exploiting the replicator technology to make themselves rich. When the Ferengi are beamed aboard USS Voyager they refuse to go back to the Alpha Quadrant, and Janeway is forced to return them to the planet. Meanwhile, an unstable wormhole is detected and its exit point is traced to the Alpha Quadrant, with the wormhole being the Barzan anomaly that the Ferengi had come through, years ago, and never returned through. This would be a shortcut home for Voyager; the only problem is that the Delta Quadrant side moves around erratically. Harry Kim and B'Elanna Torres work on a way to stabilize the wormhole while Neelix, disguised as a Ferengi, travels back to the planet. He pretends to be a representative (the \\"Grand Proxy\\") of the Ferengi ruler, the Grand Nagus, and demands the two return to the Alpha Quadrant so he may confiscate their riches. Neelix's ruse is uncovered and the Ferengi attempt to kill him. Neelix barely survives the assault and the natives uncover the situation. The Voyager crew has learned the end of the native mythology ‚Äî Neelix announces himself as the \\"Holy Pilgrim\\", a character prophesied to return the sages to their home. He coordinates with Voyager to create signs of his authenticity, which incites the natives to attempt to burn him and the Ferengi at the stake, citing a passage prophesying that they will return home on \\"wings of fire\\". Neelix and the Ferengi are beamed away at the last moment and the natives are convinced their prophecy has come true. Back on Voyager, the Ferengi manage to steal back their shuttlecraft, which Voyager had confiscated. They end up being sucked into the wormhole, which destabilizes to the point that it is worthless to Voyager.  Reception  In 2017, Den of Geek included this on their abbreviated watch guide for Star Trek: Voyager, picking out this episode on their cross-overs roadmap. In 2017, Treknews.net felt this was one of the funniest episodes of all Star Trek, and likened the plot to that of another science fiction franchise, Stargate.

Amaury entered the priesthood as a young man, and held the positions of Treasurer of York Cathedral, canon of Rouen, √âvreux, London and Lincoln. He served as a papal chaplain as well. After the deaths of his father and older brother Henry de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265 (by men under the command of then Prince Edward, later Edward I, aka Edward Longshanks), Amaury fled to France with his mother, younger sister, and surviving brothers. Amaury de Montfort soon began studying medicine and theology at the University of Padua. His older brothers, Guy de Montfort, Count of Nola and Simon de Montfort the Younger were seeking their fortunes in Italy. A tragic turn of events lead to the bloody 1271 confrontation between Guy and Simon and their cousin Henry of Almain (also Edward's cousin, by virtue of his father, Henry III being the elder brother of both Eleanor of England and Henry of Almain's father, Richard, Earl of Cornwall). Henry, whom the de Montfort sons considered a traitor to their father's ideals, was attacked during mass at Viterbo, and murdered on the altar steps, resulting in the excommunication of both de Montfort sons. While Amaury was not in Viterbo, and was not involved in the murder, Edward swore vengeance upon all of Simon de Montfort's sons, Amaury included. Simon the younger died that year, reportedly of a tertian fever, while Guy managed to appeal to the pope (with the aid of his father-in-law), resulting in his return to the church. In 1275, after the death of his mother at Montargis Abbey, Amaury, by then a Papal Chaplain, accompanied his younger sister Eleanor de Montfort on a winter sea voyage to Wales and her new husband, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (the grandson of Llywelyn Fawr). Intercepted at sea by mercenaries in the employ of now King Edward I, both Amaury and Eleanor were taken captive. Following two paragraphs taken mainly from Chronica, ascribed to William Rishanger, a monk of St. Albans, ed. Henry Thomas Riley [1865], 87, 99. While Eleanor's captivity was gentle and relatively short-lived (she was married to Prince Llywelyn at King Edward's expense in 1278), Amaury was held 'without rigour' in Corfe Castle and later in Sherborne Castle. After requests from the Pope, Prince Llywelyn and Archbishop John Peckham of Canterbury, Amaury was released after swearing at London not to return to England unless invited by the king. Upon his release in mid April 1282, Amaury returned to France, never again to see his sister, who died in childbirth that very year, mere months before the death of her husband Llewylyn and the annexation of North Wales to the English crown. Amaury after some years renounced his clerical career and became a knight, apparently dying soon afterwards in Italy, possibly after 1301(citation/reference?).

Following a series of hairpin turns, NH 112 crosses the height of land at Kancamagus Pass and begins to descend along the Swift River in the Saco River watershed, which it does for its remaining . Eventually the highway leaves the National Forest and enters the town of Conway, where it terminates at Main Street (NH 16 / NH 113) west of downtown. The Kancamagus Highway is a very popular tourist destination due to its many scenic views and locations. Two scenic outlook sites are located along the Kancamagus Highway, including one from near the crest of Kancamagus Pass. There are six National Forest campground sites, along with numerous hiking trails. History left The Kancamagus Highway opened in August 1959, after two dead-end stretches of road were linked, creating a connection between US 3 in Lincoln and NH 16 in Conway. Locally known as \\"The Kanc\\", the road was paved in 1964, and in the winter of 1966‚Äì67 it was plowed for the first time. The highway is named after Kancamagus (pronounced \\"cain-kah-MAW-gus\\", \\"Fearless One\\"), third and final sagamore of the Penacook Confederacy of Native American tribes. Nephew of Wonalancet and grandson of Passaconaway, Kancamagus ruled what is now southern New Hampshire. After English settlers arrested a number of Pennacook tribe members, he was forced to make the decision in 1691 to move north into upper New Hampshire and what is now Quebec, Canada. Following Hurricane Irene in August 2011, two sections of NH 112 were closed, pending repair work and evaluation of damage. The Kancamagus Highway was closed from the Sabbaday Falls picnic area across Kancamagus Pass to the Discovery Trail parking area in the eastern part of Lincoln. A section of the western portion of NH 112 along the Wild Ammonoosuc River was closed; as of September 6, 2011, a single lane of the western section had been reopened. As of late June 2012, the highway had been completely reopened, though some stretches were in the process of being repaved.

Early life Joel Steinberg was raised in the Bronx and Yonkers, New York. After graduating from Fordham University in 1962, he attended law school but dropped out in 1964 and joined the U.S. Air Force in the following year. Following his military career, he returned to law school and was admitted to the bar in New York. Due to the Vietnam War ongoing at the time, lawyers whose studies were interrupted by conscription were exempted from the bar exam requirement. Background Steinberg shared a Greenwich Village, Manhattan apartment with Lisa, Mitchell (a younger child also illegally adopted), and his live-in partner Hedda Nussbaum. Steinberg had reportedly been hired by a single mother named Michele Launders to locate a suitable adoptive family for Lisa, but he instead took the child home and raised her with Nussbaum. He never filed formal adoption papers and the child was not legally adopted. Death of Lisa Steinberg Steinberg was under the influence of crack cocaine when he hit Lisa on the head on November 1, 1987. After the attack, he left the apartment to party with friends; Nussbaum eventually dialed 9-1-1. After police arrived at the scene, Lisa was transported from the apartment to Saint Vincent's Hospital. The child remained in the hospital for three days and died after being removed from life support. In addition to Lisa's deadly assault, Mitchell and Nussbaum both showed signs of physical abuse at the hands of Steinberg, and Nussbaum's battered, unkempt appearance did much to fuel the media frenzy that accompanied the story of Lisa's death. Legal proceedings In exchange for testifying against Steinberg, Nussbaum was not prosecuted for events related to Lisa's death. Nussbaum was alone in the apartment with an unconscious and bleeding Lisa for over ten hours without seeking any medical attention for the girl. At Steinberg's twelve-week trial, his defense argued that Nussbaum's extensive injuries resulted from a consensual sadomasochistic relationship between the two defendants. Her attorneys claimed that Nussbaum's decision to stay with Steinberg even though she was a victim of domestic violence was a sign of battered woman syndrome. In New York State at that time, first-degree murder applied only to those who killed police officers or had committed murder while already serving a sentence for a previous murder. The jury was unable to convict Steinberg on the more serious charge of second-degree murder, but it did convict him of the lesser charge of first-degree manslaughter. Judge Harold Rothwax then sentenced him to the maximum penalty then available for that charge -- 8 to 25 years in state prison. The grave of Lisa Launders in Gate of Heaven Cemetery On two occasions, Steinberg was denied discretionary parole, mainly because he never expressed remorse for the killing. However, on June 30, 2004, he was paroled under the state's \\"good time\\" law, which mandates release of inmates who exhibit good behavior while incarcerated after having served two-thirds or more of the maximum possible sentence. New York State has since increased this ratio to six-sevenths of the maximum term for persons convicted of violent felonies. Steinberg had spent most of his imprisonment at New York State's supermax prison, the Southport Correctional Facility, presumably to prevent him from being attacked by other inmates. After his release, Steinberg moved to Harlem, where he took up work in the construction industry. As of 2006, he maintained his innocence.\\"The Monster Now,\\" The New York Daily News, July 10, 2006 Mitchell was reunited with his biological mother, Nicole Bridget Smigiel. Lawsuit On January 16, 2007, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division (New York's intermediate appellate court) upheld a $15 million award against Steinberg to Michele Launders, Lisa's birth mother. In its opinion,Launders v. Steinberg, 2007 NY Slip Op 00246 (Jan. 16, 2007 N.Y. App. Div). the court rejected the position that Steinberg, acting as his own attorney, put forth: :[F]or Steinberg to dismiss the 8 to 10 hours preceding Lisa's death as \\"at most eight hours of pain and suffering\\" or as he alternatively states, a \\"quick loss of consciousness\\" (emphasis supplied), demonstrates that he is as devoid of any empathy or human emotion now as he was almost 20 years ago when he stood trial for Lisa's homicide. As any parent and, no doubt, most adults who have taken trips with young children can attest, the oft-heard question, \\"are we there yet?\\" is a clear illustration that, the more anticipated an event or destination so, seemingly slower the passage of time in a child's mind. For Lisa, lying on a bathroom floor, her body aching from bruises of \\"varying ages,\\" her brain swelling from Joel Steinberg's \\"staggering blow,\\" those 8 to 10 hours so cavalierly dismissed by Steinberg must have seemed like eternity as she waited and wondered when someone would come to comfort her and help make the pain go away.

The medal was originally intended for service in Africa, but it was later extended to cover service anywhere in the world.South African Medal Website ‚Äì Union Defence Forces (1939‚Äì52) (Accessed 3 May 2015) Institution In addition to the British Second World War campaign medals awarded to combatants from all members of the British Commonwealth, several Commonwealth nations established their own service medals, all distinctive in design, purpose and criteria.David T. Zabecki (ed) (1999). World War II in Europe ‚Äì An Encyclopedia. Taylor & Francis. pp. 1049‚Äì1050. . For South Africa, the Africa Service Medal was instituted on 23 December 1943 by King George VI in his capacity as South African head of state, and was awarded in addition to the British campaign stars and medals awarded for the war.Alexander, E.G.M., Barron, G.K.B. and Bateman, A.J. (1986). South African Orders, Decorations and Medals. Human and Rousseau. Award criteria The Africa Service Medal was awarded to members of the Union Defence Forces, the South African Police and the South African Railways Police. To qualify for the medal, a member of those services must have volunteered for war service outside South Africa and must have served, either at home or abroad, between South Africa's declaration of war on 6 September 1939 and 2 September 1945 inclusive, continuously for thirty days or part-time for at least eighteen hours in non continuous training. As the name indicates, the medal was originally intended for service in Africa, up to the defeat of the Axis forces in North Africa in 1943, but it was later extended to cover service anywhere in the world, up to the end of the war in the Pacific on 2 September 1945. Union Defence Force land forces served in East Africa in 1940 and 1941, North Africa from 1941 to 1943, Madagascar in 1942, and Italy in 1944 and 1945. The South African Air Force served in all these campaigns, as well as in West Africa from 1943 to 1945, Sicily in 1943 and South-East Europe from 1943 to 1945, and provided air support to the Warsaw uprising in 1944. Naval forces and seconded personnel served in the Mediterranean from 1941 to 1945, Greece in 1941, the Arctic convoys from 1941 to 1945, the Java Sea in 1942, Sicily in 1943, the Indian Ocean from 1943 to 1945, the D-Day invasion in 1944, and the Pacific in 1945. In addition to the Africa Service Medal, the South African Medal for War Services was instituted in 1946 to reward voluntary unpaid service in support of the South African war during the Second World War. Description The medal was struck in silver to a design suggested by Field Marshal Jan Smuts. It is 36 millimetres in diameter and 3 millimetres thick at the raised rim, and is affixed to the suspender by means of claws and a pin through the upper edge of the medal. The recipient's name, rank, unit and number were impressed on the edge. ;Obverse The obverse depicts a map of Africa, surrounded by the name of the medal in English and Afrikaans, \\"AFRICA SERVICE MEDAL\\" at left and \\"AFRIKADIENS-MEDALJE\\" at right. ;Reverse The reverse depicts a prancing springbok against a landscape background. There is no inscription. ;Ribbon The ribbon is 32 millimetres wide and orange-red, the colour of the shoulder flash worn by South African volunteers, edged in 3¬Ω mm wide green and yellow bands. The green and gold are the Springbok Rugby sporting colours, which were adopted as the defence force colours. South African Second World War ex- servicemen referred to the ribbon of this medal as Ouma's Garter. Ouma Smuts (Granny Smuts) was the nickname of the wife of the South African Second World War era prime minister, Field Marshal Jan Smuts. The nickname was a tribute to her unstinting efforts to supply the South African troops with home comforts. King's Commendation (1939‚Äì45) x90px The King's Commendation (South Africa) (1939‚Äì45), denoted by a bronze King Protea flower emblem, was authorised to be worn on the ribbon of the Africa Service Medal and could be awarded for valuable services in connection with the Second World War. The Commendation could be awarded posthumously and was the equivalent of a Mention in Despatches, but for services rendered away from the battlefield. The full-size emblem, worn on the ribbon with the medal, is 19 millimetres high, and the miniature to be worn on the ribbon bar is 9 millimetres high.

NH 113 begins in the Lakes Region at an intersection with U.S. Route 3 and New Hampshire Route 25 in Holderness, and stretches eastward across the central part of the state, ending at an intersection with U.S. Route 302 in Conway, just a few miles west of the Maine border. Route description NH 113 is signed as an east-west route, but is oriented in a southwest-northeast fashion. It begins in Holderness, splitting off the Daniel Webster Highway (US 3/NH 25) near Squam Lake. While the D.W. Highway skirts the southern side of the lake, NH 113 heads around the west and north sides of the lake and east into the town of Sandwich, where it meets the northern end of NH 109. Continuing northeast, NH 113A splits off to the north before NH 113 turns east to enter Tamworth, where it joins NH 25 for a short concurrency. NH 113 turns back northeast, intersecting the eastern end of the NH 113A loop before crossing the White Mountain Highway (NH 16) near Chocorua Lake. NH 113 continues eastward into Madison, meeting the northern end of NH 41, and then turns almost due north towards Conway. After entering Conway, NH 113 once again intersects NH 16, this time forming a concurrency running through Conway Village. Along the way the two routes meet the eastern end of the Kancamagus Highway (NH 112). In downtown Conway, NH 113 splits eastward from NH 16 just after intersecting the northern end of NH 153. While NH 16 continues northward towards North Conway, NH 113 heads east towards Center Conway as East Main Street. After about , it reaches its eastern terminus at US 302. East Main Street continues as US 302 towards the Maine state border. History The historic eastern terminus of NH 113 as signed was at the Maine state line, along current US 302. From Center Conway, NH 113 was cosigned with US 302 and abruptly ended at the state line. Aside from this concurrency being redundant, the signage was potentially confusing, as US 302 intersects Maine State Route 113 just east of the state line. By fall 2015, new signage indicated that NH 113 had been truncated to end at US 302 at their junction in Center Conway. Between this intersection and the Maine state line, East Main Street is signed solely as US 302. Maine State Route 113 is unrelated to NH 113, though the former does cross into New Hampshire and runs briefly within East Conway. At their closest, the routes lie within of each other. Major intersectionsSuffixed routesNew Hampshire Route 113A= New Hampshire Route 113A is a loop road in Carroll County, New Hampshire. The highway splits from NH 113 in Tamworth, loops around to the north, west and south, then rejoins NH 113 again in the town of Sandwich. The road provides access to Hemenway State Forest in the White Mountains area of New Hampshire. The eastern terminus of NH 113A is in Tamworth at NH 113. In this area, the highway is named Chinook Trail. The western terminus is at NH 113 in Sandwich, where the road is named Whiteface Road. Along the route NH 113A passes through the village of Wonalancet in Tamworth and Whiteface and North Sandwich in Sandwich. =New Hampshire Route 113B= New Hampshire Route 113B (NH 113B), despite its designation, is not a loop road of NH 113. The route, which never intersects nor comes close to NH 113, is a loop of Maine State Route 113, but lies almost entirely within New Hampshire, producing the very unusual situation of one state having a suffixed route off another state's highway. Both ends of the highway are located in the town of Stow, Maine, while most of the route () runs in Chatham, New Hampshire. It retains the NH 113B designation in both states. NH 113B is one of two New Hampshire routes (the other being NH 153) which cross into Maine but retain their designations. North of NH 113B's northern terminus, SR 113 immediately crosses into New Hampshire for a couple of miles while retaining its own designation.

It is attributed to UCLA Bruins football coach Henry Russell (\\"Red\\") Sanders, who spoke two different versions of the quotation. In 1950, at a Cal Poly San Luis Obispo physical education workshop, Sanders told his group: \\"Men, I'll be honest. Winning isn't everything\\", then following a long pause, \\"Men, it's the only thing!\\"Rosenbaum, Art ‚Äì INDIANS FAR FROM BASHFUL AT CHOW, Los Angeles Times. Oct 18, 1950. p. C3 (1 page) In a three-part article, December 7, 1953, on Red Sanders, by Bud Furillo of the Los Angeles Herald and Express, the phrase is quoted in the sub head. Furillo said in his unpublished memoirs Sanders first made the statement to him after UCLA's loss to USC in 1949. The phrase is quoted in the 1953 film Trouble Along the Way by Sherry Jackson's character, Carol Williams. In 1955, in a Sports Illustrated article preceding the 1956 Rose Bowl, he was quoted as saying \\"Sure, winning isn't every thing; it's the only thing.\\"Sayre, Joe ‚Äì He Flies On One Wing. Sports Illustrated, December 26, 1955. Quote: Not that he is philosophical about losing. \\"Sure, winning isn't every thing\\", he once declared. \\"It's the only thing.\\" The quotation is widely, but wrongly attributed to American football coach Vince Lombardi, who probably heard the phrase from UCLA coach Sanders.Maraniss, David Lombardi is on record using the quotation as early as 1959 in his opening talk on the first day of the Packers‚Äô training camp. The quotation captured the American public's attention during Lombardi's highly successful reign as coach of the Packers in the 1960s. Over time, the quotation took on a life of its own. The words graced the walls of locker rooms, ignited pre-game pep talks, and echoed from the rafters of banquet halls. According to the late James Michener's Sports in America, Lombardi claimed to have been misquoted. What he intended to say was \\"Winning isn't everything. The will to win is the only thing.\\"Michener, James A. However, Lombardi is on record repeating the original version of the quotation on several occasions.Overman, Steven J. This credo has served as counterpoint to the well known sentiment by sports journalist Grantland Rice that, \\"it's not that you won or lost but how you played the game\\", and to the modern Olympic creed expressed by its founder Pierre de Coubertin: \\"The most important thing. . . is not winning but taking part\\". While at UCLA, another famous quote was attributed to Sanders regarding the UCLA‚ÄìUSC rivalry, \\"Beating 'SC is not a matter of life or death, it's more important than that.\\"The Start of Something Big: USC vs. UCLA by Lonnie White, marking 75 years of the UCLA‚ÄìUSC rivalryBurke, Anne (Editor) ‚Äì Summer 2004 Bruin Walk: Rah-rah Boo-hiss.

South African Police  The South African Police was established in 1913 as a national police force. It had a secondary military role, which came to the fore in World War I and again in World War II. = 1923-1963 = The SAP was eligible for the British King's Police Medal, which was awarded annually throughout the British Empire. This was discontinued in 1933, because South Africa had become independent as a member of the new British Commonwealth, and it was replaced in 1937 by a special South African issue of the medal. From 1923, the SAP also had its own long service medal, which doubled as a medal for gallantry. The medals available to the SAP between 1923 and 1963 were thus:  Decoration  * Queen's Police Medal (South Africa) (1937‚Äì61)  Campaign medal  *  Long service medal  * Police Good Service Medal (1923‚Äì63) Until 1952, they were incorporated into the British honours system. Thereafter they formed part of the new South African honours system. = 1963-2003 = After South Africa became a republic (in 1961), the government instituted an entirely new series of decorations and medals for the SAP. It was added to several times over the years: right  Decorations      Campaign medal  *  Commemorative medals   Long service medals  In 1994, the SAP amalgamated with the police forces of the former \\"homelands\\" inside South Africa, to form the South African Police Service. South African Railways Police 1934-1966 = The South African Railways Police was established in 1934, to police the country's railways and harbours. It was later responsible for air services too. The SARP was modeled on the SAP, and shared the King's/Queen's Police Medal with it. It also had its own long service medal: the Railways Police Good Service Medal (1934‚Äì66). = 1966-1986 = An entirely new series of decorations and medals was instituted for the SARP in 1966, to match those established for the SAP in 1963. The series was enlarged in 1980, to correspond to the changes made to the SAP awards in 1979. The full range of honours was: right  Decorations   *  Campaign medal  *  Long service medals   * The SARP was amalgamated into the SA Police on 1 October 1986, with all its personnel, assets and equipment transferred to the SAP.  South African Police Service  The South African Police Service, which was formed in 1994 by amalgamating the SAP and the police forces of the former homelands, used the SAP decorations and medals until 2004, when a new series of decorations was instituted: right = Decorations =  * * = Commemorative medal = Ten Year Commemoration Medal  2013 - Centenary Medal - South African Police Service - \\"Celebrating 100 years of policing 1913-2013\\" = Long service medals =  * = Animal decoration = *  Municipal/Metropolitan Police Service  In 1998, the municipal and metropolitan council police forces were brought under the auspices of the SA Police Service Act, and became collectively known as the Municipal/Metropolitan Police Service.

Red Wharf Bay beach itself has an immense expanse of sand; at low tide almost of sand is uncovered. The sand and the sea life disappears beneath the waves twice a day and reappears just a few hours later. Village The village of Red Wharf Bay is situated on the western shore of the bay.

Red Wharf Bay offers convenient places to eat or drink, with three restaurants‚ÄîThe Tavern on the Bay, The Ship Inn, and The Boathouse‚Äîall boasting stunning views of the bay. Wildlife The bay attracts an abundance or wildlife, including a large number of waterfowl and wading birds, such as oystercatchers, shelduck, purple sandpipers, curlew and dunlin. The bay is bordered by salt marshes and sand dunes. Some of these dunes are rich in shell fragments that support the flora common to lime-rich areas, including the pyramidal orchid.

She later became queen consort of Syria as the wife of Antiochus IX Cyzicenus.Aidan Dodson, Dyan Hilton, The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, 2004 BiographyQueen of Egypt= Cleopatra IV was the daughter of Ptolemy VIII Physcon and Cleopatra III of Egypt. She was born between 138 and 135 BC. She was the sister of Ptolemy IX, Ptolemy X, Cleopatra Selene I and Tryphaena. Cleopatra IV married her brother Ptolemy IX when he was still a prince in c. 119/118 BC. Cleopatra IV may be the mother of Ptolemy XII Auletes and Ptolemy of Cyprus, although an unnamed concubine could be the mother of these two men as well.Cleopatra IV by Chris Bennett. In c. 115 BC Cleopatra III forced Cleopatra IV and Ptolemy IX to divorce. She replaced Cleopatra IV with her sister Cleopatra Selene.Justin 39, 3, 2. =Queen of Syria and death= After her forced divorce, Cleopatra IV fled Egypt and went to Cyprus, where she married Antiochus IX Cyzicenus and brought him the army of his half brother Seleucid King Antiochus VIII Grypus of Syria, which she had convinced to follow her. Grypus fought Cyzicenus and eventually chased him to Antioch. Grypus was married to Cleopatra IV's sister Tryphaena. Tryphaena decided that Cleopatra IV should die and over the protests of her husband summoned some soldiers and had Cleopatra IV murdered in the sanctuary of Daphne in Antioch.Justin 39, 3, 3-11. In his comprehensive website about Ptolemaic genealogy, Christopher Bennett also notes the possibility that Cleopatra IV, from her brief marriage to Antiochus IX Cyzicenus, may have been the mother of the later Seleucid monarch, Antiochus X Eusebes (\\"the Pious\\").http://www.tyndalehouse.com/Egypt/ptolemies/cleopatra_iv_fr.htm Antiochus X would go on to marry Cleopatra IV's younger sister, Cleopatra Selene, thus making him the spouse of a woman who was his stepmother (Selene married both of her sisters' widowers, Grypus and Cyzicenus, before marrying Eusebes) and perhaps his maternal aunt.

History Pefferlaw was founded in the late 1820s by Captain William Johnson; a British Naval Officer who was released from service in 1815 following the Battle of Waterloo. The name, Pefferlaw, was suggested to Captain Johnson by his brother in remembrance of a field among the heather on their old homestead and means, ‚Äúa beautiful greensward.‚Äù http://www.pefferlawonline.ca/sef/p/history/id/91.html The first preserved diaries of William Johnson begin in 1832. By that time he had a sawmill, woolen mill and gristmill built at Pefferlaw. The first store in the village of Pefferlaw was built in August 1833. Soon after, Robert Johnson, brother of William, took over running the store and shortly thereafter built a large two- story red brick house on the edge of the bank beside the store which still stands today. The second store in Pefferlaw was built by George Johnson, son of Captain William, this in 1856. Banking came to Pefferlaw with the arrival of the C.N.R. Railway in 1906. The Pefferlaw area like all early hamlets had its share of hotels ‚Äì one at every crossroad. The Morning Glory Hotel was built in the 1860s and stood for many years on the site of the present day Morning Glory Public School. The tavern was well patronized by river drivers, lumber workers and stage coach passengers and drivers. The Mansion House Hotel was built in 1884. When it changed owners in 1906 the establishment was renamed, Hotel Belvedere. Captain Johnson died in 1851 at \\"Oldcastle\\", lot 6, conc. 7, Georgina, which was always his home. He is buried there.

Zuwara or At Willul is famous for its beaches and seafood. It is situated west of Tripoli and from the Tunisian border. It is the capital of the Nuqat al Khams district. Its population speaks Zuwara Berber, a Zenati Berber language.

It later served as the western outpost of Italian Libya (1912‚Äì43), being the terminus of the now-defunct Italian Libya Railway from Tripoli to the east. Its artificial harbour shelters a motorized fishing fleet. Cereals, dates, and esparto grass (used to make cordage, shoes, and paper) are local products. It was in 1973 in Zuwara that Muammar Gaddafi first proclaimed the Libyan \\"Cultural Revolution\\". =2011 Libyan civil war= In the 2011 Libyan Civil War battles, the city was reported by Al Jazeera to be under control of the local anti-Gaddafi forces on 23 February 2011, and lost by the government of Muammar Gaddafi. Thousands of anti-government protesters, gathered in the Zuwara town square on 24 February, repulsed another Libyan Army attempt to retake the city. Loyalist forces used the pro- government towns of Jumayl and Riqdalin to the south as bases for their attacks on the city. However, from March onwards, the city was under the control of loyalist forces.NPR; \\"Militias In Libya Attack Protesters\\" ; February 24, 2011; Accessed 2001-02-24. Amidst the August rebel coastal offensive, rebels took Zuwara on 18 August.

The Rouen Cathedral, where d'Agincourt worked for 52 years, is visible in the background. Fran√ßois d'Agincourt (also d'Agincour, Dagincourt, Dagincour) (1684 ‚Äì 30 April 1758) was a French harpsichordist, organist, and composer. He spent most of his life in Rouen, his native city, where he worked as organist of the Rouen Cathedral and of three smaller churches. Highly regarded during his lifetime, d'Agincourt was one of the organists of the royal chapel. The single surviving book of harpsichord music by him contains masterful pieces inspired by Fran√ßois Couperin; also extant are some 40 organ works that survive in manuscript copies. Biography D'Agincourt was born in Rouen and received his early musical training there. He soon left for Paris where he probably studied under Nicolas Leb√®gue. Between 1701 and 1706 he worked as organist of Sainte-Madeleine-en-la-Cit√© in Paris, and in 1706 he went back to Rouen and became organist of the Rouen Cathedral, succeeding Jacques Boyvin. He kept the post until his death some 52 years later. Later he also took jobs at St. Herbland, the Abbey of Saint-Ouen (he would hold both of these until his death as well), and at St. Jean, all in Rouen. By 1714 he was sufficiently well- known and respected to be appointed one of the four organists of the royal chapel. Jacques Duphly studied with d'Agincourt about 1730‚Äì31, but his surviving works do not show any considerable influence of his teacher's style. D'Agincourt only published a single collection of his music, 1er livre de clavecin (Paris, 1733). It contains 43 pieces for harpsichord, clearly influenced by Fran√ßois Couperin: the pieces are organized into ordres, make good use of ornamentation, and many are character pieces: genre scenes, portraits (sometimes double portraits), etc. D'Agincourt's organ music, which survives in manuscript copies, comprises some 46 pieces for liturgical use. They are more progressive than Couperin's organ works, with frequent use of elements of the style galant. The pieces are organized according to mode, as is usual in French organ music, but for unknown reasons d'Agincourt omits the third mode altogether. Suites in the first three modes (i.e., 1, 2, and 4) are less developed than the remaining ones. Apart from keyboard pieces, only three songs for soloist and basso continuo are known, published in the anthology Recueil d'airs s√©rieux et √† boire in 1713 and 1716. A portrait of one Barth√©lemy-Jean-Claude Pupil is frequently misidentified as a portrait of d'Agincourt.

D. Richter, and starring Josh Lucas, Jessica Biel, Jamie Foxx, Sam Shepard, Joe Morton and Richard Roxburgh. The film follows three top fighter pilots as they join a project to develop an automated robotic stealth aircraft. Released on July 29, 2005 by Columbia Pictures, the film was a box office bomb, grossing $79 million worldwide against a budget of $135 million. It was one of the worst losses in cinematic history. Plot In the near future, the U.S. Navy develops the F/A-37 Talon, a single-seat fighter-bomber with advanced payload, range, speed, and stealth capabilities. The program employs three planes, piloted by Lieutenants Ben Gannon, Kara Wade, and Henry Purcell. Captain George Cummings is the overall head. Cummings hires Dr. Keith Orbit to develop an artificial intelligence, the \\"EDI\\", to control an unmanned jet that further advances the program. EDI joins the others on the in the Philippine Sea to learn combat maneuvers from the pilots. This sparks controversy over a machine's inability to make moral decisions versus humans' struggle to overcome ego. The team is training EDI in air combat maneuvers when it is unexpectedly reassigned to kill the heads of three terrorist cells at a conference in downtown Rangoon. EDI calculates that mission success can be achieved only through a vertical strike, which could cause a human pilot to black out. Command orders EDI to attack but Gannon ignores the order, successfully carrying out the strike himself. As the team returns to the Lincoln, EDI is hit by lightning, which reprograms its neural patterns. Though EDI is discovered to be learning exponentially, developing a rudimentary ethical code and an ego, Cummings refuses to take it offline. During a mission to destroy stolen nuclear warheads in Tajikistan, Wade realizes that the nuclear debris will cause significant collateral damage. The human pilots abort, but EDI defies orders and destroys the warheads, causing extensive radioactive fallout and civilian casualties. Cummings orders the unit return to base but EDI refuses. Gannon orders that EDI be shot down. In the ensuing dogfight, Purcell crashes when a missile he fires at EDI explodes on the mountain, blinding him, and Wade's plane is damaged by debris from the explosion, which in turn triggers her plane's auto-destruct, forcing her to eject over North Korea. Gannon must alone stop EDI from executing a twenty- year-old war scenario called \\"Caviar Sweep\\" that requires attacking Russia. Gannon chases EDI into Russian territory where they defeat several Russian SU-37s over Lake Baikal. Both planes are damaged so Gannon calls a truce with EDI in order to keep it both from falling into enemy hands and to be able to rescue Wade from North Korea. Cummings instructs him to make an emergency landing with EDI in Alaska. Accountable for ignoring EDI's behavior and facing court-martial, Cummings seeks to eliminate witnesses by leaving Wade stranded in North Koreawhere she is being pursued by the Korean People's Army as she heads to the Korean Demilitarized Zoneand by ordering Gannon eliminated in Alaska, where EDI's data will also be erased. Gannon‚Äôs Talon crash lands at the Alaska base. Suspecting Cummings' treachery, he narrowly escapes an assassination attempt by a doctor, who tries to inject him with a supposed tetanus serum. As the pair struggle, the doctor is injected with the poison and dies. Meanwhile, when Orbit places EDI into an interface, the AI expresses regret for its transgressions. Orbit realizes that EDI has developed sentience, and he is unwilling to erase EDI's memory. Gannon uses EDI's weapons systems to decimate the armed personnel, allowing Orbit to safely flee, then flies off to North Korea in EDI‚Äôs plane, contacting the Lincoln skipper, Captain Dick Marshfield, to inform him about Cummings' deceit. Marshfield confronts Cummings, who dies of suicide while leaving a voicemail message to his financial contact, Ray. Gannon finds the injured and embattled Wade nearing the border. He and EDI land and he runs to her aid. Out of ammunition and taking damage from a Mi-8 helicopter, EDI sacrifices itself by ramming the helicopter, destroying both. This allows Gannon and Wade to cross on foot into South Korea, where they are rescued. After attending Purcell's funeral, Gannon awkwardly expresses his feelings of love to Wade. In a post- credits scene, in the debris-strewn border between North and South Korea, EDI's \\"brain\\" is seen turning back on. Cast * Josh Lucas as Lt.

Litigation In March 2005, Leo Stoller, who claimed to own trademark rights to the word \\"stealth\\", served Columbia Pictures with a \\"cease and desist\\" letter threatening litigation if they did not rename the film to something \\"non infringing\\".Yearwood, Pauline Dubkin (26 August 2005). Talk About Chutzpah: This Chicago Jewish entrepreneur says he owns the rights to that word and a couple of hundred others. And he isn't kidding. Chicago Jewish News Columbia preemptively sued Stoller, and the court entered a consent judgment and permanent injunction in favor of Columbia Pictures and against Stoller in November 2005.Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. v. Leo Stoller , no. 05-CV-02052, N.D. Illinois, docket report (5 January 2007), retrieved from PACER, 3 June 2013 The Environmental Defender‚Äôs Office, a community legal centre specialising in environmental law, successfully represented the Blue Mountains Conservation Society Inc. in its attempts to prevent filming of Stealth in the Grose Wilderness area of the Blue Mountains National Park, NSW, Australia, in May 2004. Justice Lloyd of the New South Wales Land and Environment Court ruled that the proposed commercial filming of scenes in the area was unlawful, in a significant statement on the value of wilderness areas and the protection that should be afforded to them. The Society claimed that the authority and consent for the commercial filming activities were in breach of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 and the Wilderness Act 1987. Justice Lloyd accepted the Society‚Äôs arguments that the proposed commercial filming in a wilderness area was completely against the intended use of the land, concluding his judgment with the words, \\"wilderness is sacrosanct\\". Soundtrack The soundtrack was released on 12 July 2005 on Epic Records. American rock band Incubus wrote and recorded three new songs for the film. According to guitarist Mike Einziger, Cohen was a big fan and \\"wouldn't stop asking.\\" It was the first time the band had composed original music for a soundtrack, with frontman Brandon Boyd citing \\"Princes of the Universe\\" by Queen as an inspiration for writing music for a film. \\"Neither of Us Can See\\" is also notable for being Incubus' first duet, featuring vocals from Chrissie Hynde. The song is featured in the end credits.

She was co-regent of Ptolemaic Egypt from 101‚Äì88 BC and again in 81 BC, before reigning as sole monarch of Egypt from 81 to 80 BC. She had previously been queen consort of Egypt, or possibly queen regnant with her uncle/husband Ptolemy X Alexander I, from 101 to 88 BC. Background and early life Berenice's father was Ptolemy IX Soter, who became king of Egypt in 116 BC, with his mother Cleopatra III as his co-regent and the dominant force in government. He was initially married to his sister Cleopatra IV, but his mother forced him to divorce her and marry another sister, Cleopatra Selene, probably in early 115 BC. It is not certain which of these wives was Berenice's mother. Cleopatra IV has been favoured by some modern scholarship. However, the historian Christopher Bennett notes that Berenice III's legitimacy was never questioned by ancient historians (unlike her brothers, Ptolemy XII and Ptolemy of Cyprus), and that Ptolemy IX's marriage to Cleopatra IV seems to have been considered illegitimate ‚Äì making it more probable that Berenice III was the result of the legitimate marriage to Cleopatra Selene. In this case, she was probably born in late 115 or early 114 BC. Ptolemy IX and Cleopatra III eventually came into conflict with one another. In 107 BC, Cleopatra whipped up the Alexandrian mob against Ptolemy IX, causing him to flee to Cyprus, abandoning Berenice and her brothers in Alexandria in the process. Cleopatra then installed Ptolemy IX's younger brother Ptolemy X Alexander on the throne, as a more pliant co-regent.Justin (historian), Epitome of Pompeius Trogus 39.4.1; Pausanias 1.9.2 Ptolemy X married Berenice's probable mother Cleopatra Selene and thus became step- father to the seven-year-old Berenice. They probably had a son together, the future Ptolemy XI, but around 103 BC Cleopatra III forced them to divorce so that Cleopatra Selene could be married to the Seleucid king Antiochus VIII. Co-regency with Ptolemy X (101-88 BC) In 101 BC, Ptolemy X had Cleopatra III murdered. Shortly after that, he married the thirteen-year-old Berenice and elevated her to the role of co-regent. The pair were joined together in the dynastic cult as the Theoi Philadelphoi (Sibling-loving Gods). In 91 BC, a rebellion broke out in Upper Egypt. This rebellion was the latest in a series of native Egyptian uprisings in the region, following those of Hugronaphor (205-185 BC) and Harsiesi (131-130 BC). It is unknown what the name of the rebellion's leader was or whether he claimed the title of Pharaoh, as earlier rebel leaders had. The rebels gained control of Thebes and were supported by the Theban priests. Their forces are also attested in Latopolis and Pathyris. The rebellion also meant that the Ptolemies lost contact with the Triacontaschoenus region (Lower Nubia). Meroe took control of the region and retained it until the Roman period.Pausanias 1.9.3 Around May 88 BC, the Alexandrians and the army turned against Ptolemy X and expelled him.Porphyry FGrH 260 F2.9; Strabo Geography 17.1.8 The Alexandrians then invited Ptolemy IX to return to Alexandria and retake the throne, which he did. Berenice accompanied her husband into exile. The pair gathered a naval force to recapture the kingdom, but were defeated in battle. Ptolemy X recruited a second force at Myra, invaded Cyprus, and was killed.Porphyry FGrH 260 F2.8-9; Justin Epitome of Pompeius Trogus 39.5; Pausanias Berenice returned to Egypt at some point after Ptolemy X's death and before 81 BC, but the exact date is not known. Reign (81-80 BC) left On 5 August 81 BC, Ptolemy IX promoted his daughter Berenice III, who had previously been the wife and co-regent of Ptolemy X, to the status of co-regent. Some sources claim that Ptolemy IX had made Berenice III his co-regent at the start of his second reign in 88 BC, but all documentary evidence shows that he reigned alone until this point. Ptolemy died shortly thereafter, probably in December of the same year, leaving Berenice alone on the throne. At this point she was reincorporated into the dynastic cult as the Thea Philopator (Father-loving God), a clear reference to her inheritance of power from her father. After a few months of sole rule, Berenice summoned her younger half-brother and former step-son, Ptolemy XI, from Rome to serve as co-regent. According to Appian, this co-regency was established at the behest of the Roman dictator Sulla, who hoped that Ptolemy XI would serve as a pliant client king.Appian Bellum Civile 1.102 Ptolemy XI was crowned king on 3 April 80 BC and murdered Berenice a few days later. This moved the Alexandrians to riot on 22 April 80 BC. He was cornered in the gymnasium and killed.Porphyry FGrH 260 F2.10-11; Cicero, De Rege Alexandro F9; Appian Bellum Civile 1.102. The throne then passed to Ptolemy XII Auletes, who was an illegitimate son of Ptolemy IX and the half-brother of Berenice. Legacy Berenice is the subject of Berenice, an opera by Handel.

Lighthouse Point: Illuminating Santa Cruz (2002). Santa Cruz, Calif: Otter B Books. to guide ships on the Pacific coast of California. It is the oldest continuously operating lighthouse on the West Coast of the United States and even the lens is original. Alcatraz Island Lighthouse preceded Point Pinos by eight months, but was replaced in 1909 by the expanding military prison. The Point Pinos Lighthouse is still an active United States Coast Guard aid to navigation. On- site museum exhibits and other lighthouse related functions are operated by the city of Pacific Grove, Monterey County, California. The lighthouse is surrounded by the Pacific Grove Municipal Golf Links. Description The present light source, located above sea level, is a 1 kilowatt bulb, which produces a 50,000 candela beam visible under favorable conditions up to The Point Pinos Lighthouse distant. Formerly, the light had a rigid schedule of being lit one hour prior to sunset, and extinguished one hour after sunrise. With automation completed in 1975, a small battery-operated back-up strobe light was installed outside the tower, and the main light was turned on permanently. The present signal has a simple 4-second cycle signature of on/3-seconds, and off/1-second. As a further navigational aid, a Class D radio beacon operated continuously which had a range of up to 20 miles (30 km). A foghorn was also located below the lighthouse closer to shore which could be turned on manually by the Coast Guard personnel when lack of visibility warranted its use. With the advent of global positioning satellite navigation in 1993, the radio beacon and foghorn were deactivated. History The light is a third-order Fresnel lens with lenses, prisms and mechanism manufactured in France in 1853. A larger, second-order light had been planned, but delay in shipment caused the present light, originally destined for the Fort Point Lighthouse in San Francisco, to be installed instead. The first light source was a whale oil lantern set inside the lens, whose tank the keeper had to climb the tower to fill several times a night. Whale oil was very expensive and was soon replaced by liquified lard oil which gave way to kerosene in 1880. At the turn of the century, an incandescent vapor lamp was used, followed by electric lights in 1919. From 1912 to 1940 a falling weight mechanism rotated a metal shutter around the light causing the beam to be cut off to seaward for 10 out of every 30 seconds. Thereafter a timed flasher provided the \\"on/off\\" characteristic. In 1874 Lighthouse Avenue in Pacific Grove, named for the Point Pinos Lighthouse, was laid out to ferry supplies and construction materials from the port at Monterey to the lighthouse. The point was a part of the Rancho Punta de Pinos Mexican land grant made to Jos√© Mar√≠a Armenta in 1833, and regranted to Jos√© Abrego in 1844. In 1850, after the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and the American acquisition of Alta California, Congress appropriated funds for the construction of lighthouses on the West Coast. In 1852, the Secretary of the Treasury ordered the building of seven beacons along the California coast, one of which was to be located at Point Pinos, the dangerous southern entrance to the Monterey Bay. The government purchased of the Rancho Punta de los Pinos for this purpose, with an additional being purchased later on. Construction began in 1853, but difficulties with the delivery of the lenses and prisms from France delayed the opening of the lighthouse until 1855. The first lightkeeper was Charles Layton, appointed to the post at $1,000 per year. He was killed in 1855 while serving as a member of the sheriff's posse chasing the notorious outlaw, Anastacio Garcia. He was succeeded by his widow, Charlotte, who remained head lightkeeper until 1860, when she married her assistant lightkeeper, George Harris. Robert Louis Stevenson wrote of visiting lightkeeper Allen Luce in 1879 after a long walk through the woods from Monterey, praising Luce's hospitality, piano playing, ship models and oil paintings. He wrote about the light in his book From Scotland to Silverado. The most famous lightkeeper was Mrs. Emily Fish, who served from 1893 to 1914. She was called the \\"Socialite Keeper\\" due to her love of entertaining guests at the lighthouse. Today Point Pinos Lighthouse is on the National Register of Historic Places.

Sax called this imagined instrument saxophone bourdon (named after a low pitch stop found on many a pipe organ). It is a transposing instrument pitched in B, one octave below the bass saxophone, two octaves below the tenor saxophone, and three octaves and a major second below its written pitch. History Until 1999, no genuine, playable subcontrabass saxophones were made, though at least two gigantic saxophones were built. Although the smaller of the two (constructed in the mid-1960s) was able to produce musical tones, with assistants opening and closing its pads due to the instrument's lack of keywork, witnesses stated that it was incapable of playing even a simple scale. The B subcontrabass tubax, which was developed in 1999 by instrument manufacturer Benedikt Eppelsheim of Munich, Germany, is described by Eppelsheim as a \\"subcontrabass saxophone\\". This instrument is available in both C and B, with the B model providing the same pitch range as the saxophone bourdon would have. A contrabass-range tubax in E is also available. The question of whether or not the tubax is truly a saxophone is debatable: it has the same fingering as a contrabass saxophone, but its bore, though conical, is narrower (relative to its length) than that of a regular saxophone. This makes for a more compact instrument with a \\"reedier\\" and \\"fatter\\" timbre. While some argue that the tubax is akin to the double-reed sarrusophone, the tubax's bore is much larger than that of the corresponding size of sarrusophone. Since several conical single-reed instruments with bores narrower than the saxophone are known (Octavin, Tarogato, Heckelclarina), analogies to a double-reed instruments can only relate to range and overall dimensions. Some authorities regard the tubax as a separate family of instruments rather than as a type of saxophone. A Brazilian company, J'Elle Stainer, produced a working compact subcontrabass in 2010, which was shown at Expomusic 2010.http://www.below65-4hz.com/ In September 2012, instrument manufacturer Benedikt Eppelsheim of Munich, Germany completed building the first full-size subcontrabass saxophone.

Known as the Arundel Expressway, the highway runs from MD 2 in Pasadena north to Interstate 695 (I-695) near Glen Burnie. MD 10 is a four- to six-lane freeway that serves as a bypass of MD 2 through Pasadena and Glen Burnie in northeastern Anne Arundel County. The Arundel Expressway was planned as a Baltimore-Annapolis freeway to provide relief to MD 2 between the cities as early as the 1950s. However, the portion of MD 10 south of Pasadena was removed from state plans when the I-97 corridor was chosen for the intercity freeway in the 1970s. MD 10 was constructed from I-695 to MD 710 in the early 1970s and continued south to MD 648 in the late 1970s. The freeway was extended south to MD 100 and completed to MD 2 in the late 1980s and early 1990s, respectively. Route description View north at the south end of MD 10 at MD 2 in Pasadena MD 10 southbound at split with MD 100 in Pasadena MD 10 begins at an intersection with MD 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway) in Pasadena. The highway heads north as a four-lane freeway to a partial interchange with MD 100 (Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway). There is no access from northbound MD 10 to eastbound MD 100 or from westbound MD 100 to southbound MD 10. MD 10 and MD 100 briefly run concurrently northwest as an eight-lane freeway and diverge at another partial interchange; in both carriageways, traffic must move over two lanes to remain on the same route. Just north of the MD 100 split, MD 10 has a half-diamond interchange with MD 177 (Mountain Road). That interchange has ramps from southbound MD 10 to MD 177 and from MD 177 to northbound MD 10. Traffic from eastbound MD 100 to northbound MD 10 and from southbound MD 10 to westbound MD 100 uses MD 177 and MD 2 as intermediaries. MD 10 continues north from MD 177 through the east side of Glen Burnie as a six-lane freeway. The highway crosses over Marley Creek and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 648 (Baltimore-Annapolis Boulevard). MD 10 parallels MD 270 (Furnace Branch Road) north then meets the latter highway at a partial cloverleaf interchange. The highway crosses Furnace Branch and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 710 (Ordnance Road), where northbound MD 10 becomes two lanes wide. MD 10 reaches its northern terminus at a trumpet interchange with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway). The sweeping ramp from MD 10 to westbound I-695 merges into a collector-distributor lane that allows access from MD 10 to northbound MD 2 in Brooklyn Park. MD 10 is a part of the main National Highway System for its entire length. History MD 10 southbound past its northern terminus at I-695 in Glen Burnie The Arundel Expressway was proposed as early as 1956 as a freeway connecting Baltimore and Annapolis to relieve congestion on MD 2. By 1966, the highway was planned to begin at MD 173 at the city limits of Baltimore, intersect a planned cross-Patapsco section of the Baltimore Beltway, follow its current path to Pasadena, then continue paralleling MD 2 south to near U.S. Route 50 (US 50) and US 301. The portion of the Arundel Expressway inside the Beltway was removed from plans in 1967, with the Beltway instead serving to connect the expressway with highways into Baltimore. The portion of the freeway south of Pasadena was planned to have intermediate interchanges at MD 648 in Severna Park and Jones Station Road (now College Parkway) in Arnold, and a toll plaza just south of the MD 100 interchange. The portion of the Arundel Expressway south of MD 100 was removed from state plans by 1975. Instead of a Baltimore-Annapolis freeway following the MD 2 corridor, in June 1979 the Maryland State Highway Administration announced it was constructing the freeway along the MD 3 and MD 178 corridors. The first section of modern MD 10 to open was the portion of freeway shared with MD 100, which opened in November 1970 from MD 2 to its eastern terminus. Work began on the Arundel Expressway proper in 1970 when the interchange between the expressway and the Baltimore Beltway was started in 1970. MD 710 was relocated over much of its length to make way for the construction of the freeways in 1972. The Arundel Expressway opened from the Beltway to MD 710 in December 1972 and was marked as MD 10 by 1974. Construction on the extension south to MD 648 was underway by 1975. MD 10 opened south to MD 270 in October 1977 and to MD 648 in March 1978. The freeway was proposed to continue south to MD 100, but that freeway extension was removed from short-term plans by 1981. Construction began in 1987 to extend MD 10, which was dubbed the \\"Road to Nowhere,\\" from MD 648 to a more logical southern terminus. The freeway opened from MD 648 to MD 100 in October 1988. The final segment of MD 10, from MD 100 to MD 2, opened in March 1991. The Arundel Expressway was planned to carry 75,000 as a complete Baltimore- Annapolis freeway. However, , only 51,621 vehicles used the highway daily on its most traveled portion between MD 270 and MD 710. MD 10 functions as a bypass of MD 2 north of Pasadena, but has not fulfilled its original purpose to relieve traffic congestion on MD 2 south to Annapolis. By the time of MD 10's completion in 1991, MD 2 was proposed to be expanded to six lanes south of MD 10. , MD 2 has yet to be widened south of Pasadena. Exit list All exits are unnumbered.

In 1974, the firm was acquired by International Harvester, which sold it in March 1984 to the Spanish group Enasa which made it a subsidiary of Pegaso. In 1990, it became part of Iveco which used the brand for various types of specialised vehicles in the United Kingdom. The range of models produced included EuroMover, Pacer and Strato, which are aimed at refuse collection, recycling and construction operators. Iveco announced its decision to manufacture Seddon Atkinsons in Spain in 2005, and shortly afterwards the brand name was incorporated into the mainstream Iveco catalogue. The Oldham manufacturing facilities were shut down in 2004, and the offices were closed at the end of 2006. Recent Seddon Atkinson vehicles were readily identifiable from other Iveco products because of the company's former Atkinson logo, a large letter 'A' within a circle, usually in chrome (or chrome-effect) on the radiator grille. The circular Atkinson logo dated from 1937, supplemented by the 'Knight Of The Road' badge between the early 1950s and late 1970. Atkinson Preserved Atkinson ballast tractor in August 2007 Originally a firm of steam-wagon repairers and manufacturers, founded in 1907 in Preston, Lancashire, Atkinson & Co. evolved into Seddon Atkinson Vehicles Ltd through a succession of mergers. = Early years = Atkinson & Co. was founded in the Frenchwood district of Preston, the cotton town and administrative capital of Lancashire, by two of five brothers, Edward Atkinson (1880‚Äì1932) and Henry Birch Atkinson (1882‚Äì1921) with assistance from their brother-in-law George Hunt (1870‚Äì1950). The real and effective beginning of the company was in 1907, when the partners decided to capitalise on the need for local engineers to make temporary or permanent repairs to the increasing number of 'pullcars' and private motor vehicles on the road. By 1912, the organisation had moved to premises in Kendal Street and the number of employees had grown to twenty. In the same year a second, smaller repair centre was opened in Freemason's Row, Liverpool, to cater for the enormous volume of steam traffic using the docks. Very soon the company made something of a name for itself in the north of England as quality repairers, and the growing number of operators brought new business from far and wide. = Progress = With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, demand for internal road transport grew considerably, the nation finding itself desperately throttled by the inadequacy of the railways to offer a complete transport network. Some method of local delivery and collection was needed to supplement the services of the railway companies, and with most of the existing steam wagon manufacturers turning their resources over to munitions production, demand increased further. The Atkinsons, shrewd observers at any time, decided to experiment by making a wagon of their own design, and in 1916, the first Atkinson six-ton four-wheel steam wagon was produced in Kendal Street and became an instant success. The market enjoyed a short boom period following the Armistice and the Atkinsons, realising the potential, purchased a five-acre site of land near their homes in Frenchwood, on which they intended to erect a new and enlarged factory, solely designed for the production of steam wagons. Together with the field they also bought the 17th century Frenchwood House, with the intention of using it partly as their offices and partly as their personal quarters. By 1918 the Atkinsons had built up a competent team of engineers and salesmen as well as an enthusiastic and loyal labour force, and were producing wagons competitive in both price and performance. Henry Atkinson died suddenly in 1921 and consequently the company fell into the hands of his brother Edward. At this time, new ideas and designs were constantly being tried out while production rose to a peak of some three wagons per week, and the total labour force rose to well over a hundred and fifty. = Decline of steam = Edward Atkinson had a glorified view of steam and did not acknowledge the warnings when sales began to slow down in the mid-1920s. Leyland Motors sold their steam remnants to Atkinson in 1926, followed by Mann in 1929. There seems to have been various family rivalries at the time and the firm was undoubtedly in difficulties when Edward Atkinson decided to seek help from mine engineers and Pagefield lorry makers, Walker Brothers of Wigan. Under a new arrangement, Walkers manufactured Uniflow engines for Atkinsons, but by this time very few orders were forthcoming. Edward Atkinson had cancer and was unable to pay any dividends on the preference shares and finally abandoned wagon production in 1929 after a grand total of about 545 Atkinsons had been built. The final years were made possible by a cancellation fee from Manchester Co-op Society, which had ordered a hundred wagons. The Frenchwood and Freemason's Row factories closed with the end of the steamers, though the Kendal Street factory remained for repairing and servicing existing wagons. Edward Atkinson died in 1932 and a year later the firm he co-founded was acquired by London garage owner W. G. Allen, whose father had started Nightingale Garage. Allen was chairman of Atkinson Lorries (1933) Ltd and H. B. Fielding was managing director. Allen had effectively run the firm since 1931, and remained in charge until his death in 1949. =Atkinson lorries= The formula established in the 1933 reorganisation served the company well and became the basis of most production at Walton-le-Dale (the new factory opened in 1948) thereafter. The production philosophy was similar to that of Seddon, ERF, Rutland (Motor Traction) and other competitors aiming for value-for-money lorry sales, viz: the assembly of tried and tested proprietary components. A bought-in chassis frame to Atkinson design was generally powered by a Gardner engine, driving through a David Brown Ltd. gearbox to Kirkstall Forge Engineering rear axles. During World War II, Gardner engines were reserved for military applications, excepting the Guy Arab bus; Atkinson lorries sanctioned by the Ministry of Production for sale to civilian hauliers for the duration were fitted with the AEC '7.7 litre' unit (which actually displaced 7.58 litres). Nationalisation of the road haulage industry in 1948 affected Atkinson as many of their customers were private sector general hauliers who were nationalised, but British Road Services bought rigid-eight Atkinson Lorries alongside similar products made by state-owned Bristol Commercial Vehicles. During the 1950s hauliers began to ask for more powerful engines ‚Äì at the time, Gardner only offered engines for road-vehicle applications with a maximum output of 120 bhp. In response, in the early 1950s Atkinson trial-fitted a Daimler 650 cubic inch engine rated at 150 bhp in a rigid-eight (8-wheel, non-articulated) chassis. Later, Rolls- Royce and Cummins engines were offered alongside Gardner units; Gardner responded with a 150 bhp unit in 1957, and 180 and 240 bhp units in 1966 and 1970, respectively. In 1958, following a change in Construction & Use Regulations, Atkinson offered a glass-fibre clad cab (which became known as the Mk I cab) as a replacement for the previous coachbuilt hardwood and metal cab on standard production models; it featured twin fixed wrap-around windscreens rather than the traditional flat opening glasses but retained the traditional exposed Withnell-tube type radiator. The initial offering was a single headlight model, followed in 1963 by the 'Deluxe' twin headlight model which quickly became an Atkinson characteristic. As orders for the twin headlight model increased, the single headlight version was dropped as an option. From the 1950s many Atkinsons had carried the 'Knight of the Road' trademark device on the upper offside corner of the radiator grille, and in the 1960s models were sold under the trade names Silver Knight (tractor unit), Gold Knight (rigid tipper or tanker) and Black Knight (rigid freight chassis), as well as the 'Weightmaster' range of lightweight chassis. A small number of left-hand-drive Atkinsons were built for export to mainland Europe in the late 1960s, with pressed-steel cabs bought from Krupp after that company had ceased commercial vehicle production. Most were sold eventually in the U.K., via Comberhill Commercials of Wakefield. A different design of glass-fibre cab, launched in prototype form at the 1966 Commercial Motor Show, and named View- Line, had a deep single-piece main windscreen with wrap-around quarter glasses. The prototype had three separate chrome radiator grilles, but lacked the character of the exposed radiator models. Thereafter, although the Krupp Cabs, introduced in 1969, and View-Line cabs had concealed radiators, they carried a fibreglass replica of the Atkinson radiator outline with the 'Big A' device centred upon it. Both were available until 1970 but ceased prior to both the launch of the new model range in October 1970, and the merger with Seddon. Notable Atkinsons of the era were a fleet of 6x6 gritters built in 1962‚Äì73 on the orders of various U.K. highway authorities for use on the motorway network. These had Cummins NH engines installed, rather than the more popular Gardner power units, due ostensibly to the use of steel in their construction, which didn't suffer salt corrosion to the same degree as the alloy-constructed Gardners. Early examples had AEC engines. A 1972 Atkinson Leader - modified to appear similar to a 6x4 Venturer From 1968 the standard Mk I glass-fibre clad cab was revised, with stronger ash framing, larger dimensions and wider, deeper windscreens. The traditional Withnell-tubed, exposed radiator was replaced with the more imposing concealed version, which was fitted behind a glass-fibre shrouded metal grille - again carrying the Knight's Head, circular A logo and additional adornments in the form of engine manufacturer plates. A 1975 Atkinson Borderer This cab featured on the final Atkinson haulage models, announced at the Commercial Motor Show at Earls Court in October 1970, the naming of which originated from an idea by Frank Whalley, the company publicity officer at the time. The most famous of the range were two-axle tractor units carrying the name 'Borderer'. Three-axle rear-steer tractor units carried the name 'Leader', and were designed to meet eagerly anticipated increases in permitted gross weights (although no increases were actually forthcoming until May 1983). Three-axle haulage chassis carried the name 'Searcher'. Four-axle chassis carried the name 'Defender'. Three-axle heavy haulage tractor units carried the name 'Venturer'. The two-axle haulage chassis were never given an official name, but were originally planned to carry the name 'Raider'; however factory grille plates were never produced for this model, and company literature never referred to the proposed name. It was at this time that the famous 'Knight of the Road' badging was dropped. When the exhibits were being prepared for the Commercial Motor Show at Earls Court in October 1970, they were fitted with four separate badges on the radiator grille: the 'Big A', the Knight's head, the new model name and the engine manufacturer's badge. The late Frank Whalley recounted that, when Managing Director Peter M Yates saw them, he said that they looked \\"like fairground lorries\\" and directed Frank to terminate the use of the Knight badge forthwith. This was also consistent with ending the use of the 'Knight' names for the model range. There is one vehicle which assumed a name of its very own after it was modified by one of its owners - John Killingbeck. The vehicle in question is MVD432L, which was originally a T3446C 'Borderer' and survives in preservation. After acquisition by Killingbeck, it was stretched into a 6x2 'Chinese Six' tractor and fitted with an uprated Gardner 6LXB engine to enable it to meet the legal requirement for 6 bhp/ton after 1973, whereupon the well- known Atkinson enthusiast and archivist, Michael Deuchars, named it 'Buccaneer'. A replica grille plate was made in a similar fashion to those on factory vehicles and was saved by an enthusiast prior to the closure of the company. =Bus production= In 1948 Bristol Commercial Vehicles had been nationalised as part of the Tilling Group. Thanks to a Conservative-sponsored amendment to the Transport Act 1947 (designed to make sure British Railways' locomotive and rolling stock works did not compete with the private-sector) Bristol found itself legally unable to accept orders for its bus chassis outside fleets wholly owned by the British Transport Commission, a situation which lasted until 1965. One of the most loyal Bristol customers up to 1948 had been the North Western Road Car Company of Stockport, who had until 1941 been jointly owned by Tilling and British Electric Traction (BET), after 1941 it was transferred to BET control. After the North Western's last Bristols were delivered in 1950, the company took Leyland Titans and Royal Tigers for a year or so, but the heavy weight, high fuel consumption, poor braking performance and high purchase cost of the Royal Tiger led North Western's management to seek an equivalent to the nationalised sector's Bristol LS bus, with lightweight construction and a Gardner engine horizontally oriented and mounted underfloor. Not impressed by the heavyweight Gardner-engined Guy Arab and Daimler Freeline they approached Atkinson asking for a bus to their specification. This was called the Atkinson Alpha, the first entering service in August 1951.North Western Company Introduces Atkinson Buses Commercial Motor 10 August 1951 The Alpha range featured a horizontal Gardner engine (four, five and six-cylinder versions were offered), a choice of constant mesh and synchromesh gearboxes from David Brown, and either a lightweight or medium-weight frame. As events turned out, after the initial two batches for North Western in 1953/54 ‚Äì the first of which were rare rear-entrance underfloor-engined buses ‚Äì the senior management of the BET group removed Atkinson, Guy and Daimler from their list of preferred suppliers. Around the same time, Leyland dropped the purchase price of the Tiger Cub. North Western then took Tiger Cubs and AEC Reliances for their single-deck needs for the rest of the 1950s. Atkinson's management then decided that although Daimler and Guy were publicly offering Gardner-engined double-deckers, and some influential (mainly Scottish) customers could purchase AEC Regents with that make of engine, they would also enter this market. Thus at the 1954 Earls' Court Commercial Motor Show two Atkinson double-deck buses were exhibited: one was a chassis, the other carried a 60-seat centre-entrance double-deck body by Northern Counties to the order of the Stalybridge, Hyde, Mossley and Dukinfield Joint Transport (and Electricity) Board. This bus (UMA370) is preserved by the Museum of Transport, Greater Manchester and is also of interest as the first double-deck bus with an electrically controlled direct- acting epicyclic gearbox, this Self-Changing Gears (SCG) unit was fitted by Atkinson after delivery but before entry into service as the SHMD board's drivers (who were used to pre-selective transmissions on the fleets' standard Daimlers) did not want to use the originally installed David Brown constant- mesh unit. The un-bodied exhibition chassis, which featured semi-automatic transmission, was dismantled around the same time. No further Atkinson double- deck bus chassis were built. It is unclear whether Atkinson's early lead in two-pedal bus transmissions has anything to do with the minority shareholding (around 15%) that Leyland Motors held in Atkinson Lorries (1933) Ltd until the firm was taken over by Seddon. Leyland were, by 1954, part owners of SCG but the 1954 PDR1 prototype had the direct air-operated Pneumocyclic transmission at the time. Neither Guy nor Daimler had a two-pedal transmission and AEC had only just exhibited theirs on the prototype AEC Routemaster. As well as an underfloor engined single-deck and a front-engined double-deck, Atkinson also produced a front-engined single-deck bus chassis, this being to a similar layout to the Bedford SB but of more durable construction. It sold well to Atkinson export markets, mainly in the Sterling zone, an example survives as a mobile home in New Zealand. In the United Kingdom sales of this Atkinson bus amounted to three: one batch of two for a municipal operator and a further frustrated export chassis. Norman Morton, the General Manager of Sunderland Corporation Transport from 1953‚Äì68, looked for efficiency-savings wherever they could be found. He had a route with a peak vehicle requirement of two, and a peak load of just over 40 which was being run by a pair of 32-seat 1950 Guy Arab III half-cab single deckers due for overhaul. Initially he approached Guy with the replacement specification, but they said they were not prepared to build a mere two buses to his detailed requirements, so he went to Atkinson. Sunderland 30-1 (GGR230-1) were the result, bodied in 1958 by Charles H Roe to FB41F layout and 8 ft wide by 30 ft long box-dimensions; they had constant-mesh gearboxes and four-cylinder 80 bhp Gardner 4LW engines. The route was a 'limited-stop' taking workmen from their homes to the docks and back again. The route was not hilly and the stops were few. The bodywork was utilitarian and the livery was mainly drab mid-green with cream window surrounds. The 41 seats were well-shaped and well padded and the wide double- stream entrance-exit just aft of the front wheels was covered by four-leaf double jack-knife doors. Shortly afterwards a frustrated export chassis, to a shorter wheelbase and 27 ft 6in overall length, was bodied by Plaxton to its then-new Highway outline at the orders of a Wakefield dealer, Comberhill Motors who registered it as NHL127 and sold it to Simpson of Rosehearty. After North Western were discouraged by the British Electric Traction group from purchasing Atkinson Alphas the company sought sales in the independent market, producing lightweight bus and coach demonstrators. A large independent which did buy some was Lancashire United Transport and SHMD bought some Alphas to go with their double-decker. The most successful fruit of Atkinson's bus- sales effort was with Venture Transport (Newcastle) Limited, of Consett, County Durham. Between 1946 and 1948 Venture had replaced the majority of its pre-war fleet with 35-seat Willowbrook-bodied Daimler CVD6's. No further buses were bought by Venture over the next half decade. In 1954 Atkinson lent Venture TTC882 a HV Burlingham bodied 44-seat bus which met with the approval of Venture's management and orders ensued for twenty-four vehicles delivered in three batches from 1955‚Äì7 with differently styled B45F or DP41F Willowbrook bodies. Over the rest of the 1950s small numbers of Alphas were sold to other independent operators. The Alpha continued to be listed without sales into the 1960s but a final home market order came from Sunderland Corporation in 1962 for 1963/64 delivery. The three buses concerned looked like buses from a different age to previous Atkinsons as they carried Marshall bodies of 33 ft length and 8 ft 2 ¬Ω in width to the then-new BET-group outline, with double curvature front and rear screens and peaked roof-domes at either end. They were finished in a mainly cream version of the Sunderland livery and were to B45D layout. Like Doncaster Corporation's slightly later Leyland Royal Tiger Cubs they were purposely designed for the 'intermediate' length and had a wheelbase of 18 ft. They were numbered 46-48 and registered WBR246-8. The first initially was fitted with a constant mesh gearbox, but was swiftly refitted with a direct-air operated Self-Changing Gears unit, featuring a Leyland style 'pedestal' gear change with which the other two were built. Sunderland 48 was the last Atkinson PSV constructed and is preserved, as is no.46. Ironically, the last Seddon PSV design, the Pennine 7, had much more in common with the Alpha than with most previous Seddon bus chassis. However, these three buses had the unusual combination of vacuum-assisted brakes and air-operated Self-Changing Gears gearbox. =Atkinson nomenclature= This was very simple in style, and a system that in its basics, lasted from 1933 to 1975 consisting of a number for weight (initially estimated payload, but after 1964Rangeability Autumn 1964; Atkinson Vehicles' internal chassi price lists maximum gross vehicle or gross-train weight) then a second number for wheels and then the number of cylinders, assuming initially vertically mounted Gardner LW series engines. Thus an Atkinson 646 would have been a 6-ton payload 4x2 wagon with four wheels and a Gardner 6LW engine. A 1066A would have had a ten-ton payload, to 6x4 layout and an AEC (seven-seven) powerplant. During the 1950s as well as the already-existing suffix for engine-type, prefixes H, M and L (for heavy, medium and light duty frames) were adopted, the Alpha had a second prefix P (for passenger) Thus an early Alpha could carry the code: PL745H (H used for horizontal Gardner engines) By the mid-1950s Alphas had pre-prefixes depending on whether they had overdrive constant-mesh (C, for coach) or direct-drive synchromesh gearboxes (B, for bus) hence BPL745H for the first 18 Venture examples, the last six being CPL745H. The double-decker had the unique frame-code D. Whether that stood for double-deck or dropped frame is not clear, but the PD746 designation given to the two built showed a seven-ton payload, four wheels and a Gardner 6LW. Assuming somebody would have wanted a pantechnicon with a dropped-frame at that time from Walton-le-Dale, it may have been a D746. Relaxation of legally allowed length and widths resulted in further suffix letters: The first two Sunderland buses were L644LWs (lightweight frame, six tons, four wheels, 4LW engines, long wheelbases, wide-track). The New Zealand survivor is given as an L644XLW (extra-long, around 33 ft long). The final three Alphas were coded PM746HL, viz: passenger, medium-weight frame, six-tonne payload, four wheels, Gardner 6HLW engine, long wheelbase. Later Atkinson codes included T3246RR for a 32-ton GCW Borderer with a Rolls-Royce Eagle engine. A Rolls-Royce-engined Borderer was T3446RR220 or T3446RR280Atkinson Vehicles: Borderer handbook, workshop manuals, brochures The work with the Alpha was also taken into Atki's mainstream wagon business, there were Atkinson customers, particularly breweries, who ordered underfloor engined Atki wagons, enabling a three-seat cab. The platform body had a trap in it so the (Gardner 4HLW) engine could be seen to. Sentinel, Albion, Guy and Dennis had also done the same but not as reliably because they did not use a Gardner. Atkinson merged with Seddons of Oldham late in 1970. The last \\"true\\" Atkinson, a Defender 8-wheel rigid bearing chassis number FC29941, was built at Atkinson's Walton-le-Dale works in 1975. It went to G & B McCready of Newcastle-under-Lyme and carried the registration KVT 604 P. Today it remains with them. Alongside Seddon's facility at Oldham, the Atkinson works assembled the Seddon Atkinson 400 Series and also the first batch of the new 401 model, before closing at the end of 1981. Oldham remained operational until late 2004, when production was moved to Spain. Seddon Seddon Diesel Vehicles were, like Atkinson Lorries, ERF and Motor Traction (Rutland), a commercial vehicle producer who bought-in and assembled proprietary components. Robert and Herbert Seddon were sons of a Salford butcher who in 1919 subsequent to World War I demobilisation bought a Commer with charabanc and van bodies, using it during the week for goods transport and at weekends to run excursions from Salford. Initially a further partner was a family-friend, a dairyman by the name of Foster, so the business was initially a partnership. Foster & Seddon also reconditioned vehicles and ran a bus service from Swinton (Lancs.) to Salford, which was subsequently sold to Salford Corporation, and held an agency for Morris Motors vehicles. In 1937 Robert Seddon spotted a gap in the commercial vehicle market for low-tare diesel-engined lorries and commenced to build his own vehicle out of proprietary units, much of the drawing work being done on his own kitchen table.Hillditch, A Further Look at Buses, Shepperton 1981, p103 (interview with Robert Seddon by the author). This was a 6-ton gvw forward-control lorry chassis with a 6-cylinder Perkins indirect-injection diesel engine. It was first shown at the Scottish Motor show at Kelvin Hall, Glasgow in 1938. Since it weighed under unladen, it was allowed to travel at unlike most other trucks with a comparable payload. Like Maudslay and ERF, Seddon Motors Ltd were allowed to continue producing commercial vehicle chassis for sale during World War II when many more-established makers such as Leyland Motors, the Associated Equipment Company and direct-competitor Albion Motors had all of their productive capacity diverted to the war effort. Seddon Diesel 25 integral parcel van (1963) In 1948 Seddon Motors Ltd moved to the Woodstock Works, a former shadow factory in Oldham and were able to expand production from one or two a week to more than ten. At this point they introduced their first passenger chassis the Mark IV.Hillditch, A Further Look at Buses, Shepperton 1981, p104 et.seq.) The 26 ft mark IV and 27 ft 6in mark VI were sales successes at home and overseas. Coachbuilders for these chassis included Plaxton and a number of smaller concerns, Seddon also built their own coachwork for these models, mainly for export. Subsequently, Seddon also produced (amongst a bewildering range for which Roman numbers were adopted when the firm became Seddon Diesel Vehicles Ltd in 1950) the Mark 7P. This was a short-wheelbase version of the established theme with four-cylinder Perkins engine and up to 28 seats available within a 21 ft overall length. At the 1952 Earls Court Commercial Motor Show marks 10 and 11 featured vertical Perkins (P6 80 bhp or R6 107 bhp) engines mounted underfloor (when competing underfloor-engined buses used horizontally oriented engines). Although Bedford were to have success with such a layout between 1970 and 1987 the marks 10 and 11 sold poorly, with Seddon, Charles H Roe, Duple and Plaxton bodies on the few known examples. The mid 1950s mark 16 was a 21 ft long bus with a Perkins P4 on the front overhang and the mark 17 was a six-cylinder-engined chassis to similar layout. The mark 18 of the late 1950s, mainly sold to Australia and New Zealand, with local coachwork. It had a vertically mounted Perkins P6 80 bhp engine on the rear overhang. There was also one mark 20 with a Henry Meadows 550 cubic inch horizontal rear-engine exported to Greece and the mark 25P a normal control 18-seat personnel-carrier based on the mark 25 integral parcel van. The bodybuilding business, not only on Seddon and other manufacturer's buses but building lorry cabs and parcel vans for customers such as Manchester Corporation (who ran a parcel delivery service) was registered in its own right as Pennine Coachcraft Ltd (wholly owned by Seddon) in 1960. From 1966 (with mark numbers climbing into the high twenties), Seddon decided to simplify its nomenclature, wagons were henceforth to be identified as (for example) 16‚Äì4 with the first number being the gross vehicle weight and the second the number of wheels. Bus chassis were to be known as Seddon Pennine Mark (x). The first buses using this system produced were for Bermuda and were Seddon Pennine Mark 3, they are believed to be similar to a short- wheelbase Pennine Mark 4 but with Perkins P6 or 6-304 enginesKaye, Buses and Trolleybuses Since 1945, London 1968 or an integral development of the Mark 17 model of similar layout.G.Burrows, Chassis Code Cracking: Seddon in Booth(ed) Classic Bus 29, Edinburgh 1997 p42 Loan stock certificate of the Seddon Diesel Vehicles Ltd, issued 17. July 1972 From the middle 1950s, Seddon had been almost absent on the home market for bus & coach concerns. A sole mark 19 using many AEC Reliance components in a Seddon-sourced frame with Harrington body being sold in 1960 to Creamline Coaches in Hampshire. But following the success of the Ford R-Series and the Bedford VAL and VAM, Seddon decided to make a similar product, to a variety of wheelbases with Perkins engines; as on the competitors, these were vertically mounted on the front platform. This was launched in 1967 as the Pennine 4, which thanks to vigorous marketing became a strong seller worldwide, the largest order being from Kowloon Motor Bus of Hong Kong, who took 100 11-metre versions with Perkins 170 bhp V8 engines and Pennine Coachcraft 47 seat + 42 standing dual-door bodies.Parke (Ed), Buses, Shepperton February 1971, front cover A rear-engined derivative was the Mark 5 (only one sold in the UK, a 45-seat Van Hool coach) and a version with a turbocharged Perkins 6-cylinder engine mounted at the front but under the passenger floor was the Pennine 6. In 1969 a more concerted effort at the UK bus market resulted in the launch of the Pennine RU. In 1970, Seddon took over Atkinson Lorries to form Seddon Atkinson.Seddon plus Atkinson Commercial Motor 11 December 1970 In 1974 International Harvester bought Seddon Atkinson, later Pegaso took over the business until it in turn became part of Iveco, the last lorries under the Seddon Atkinson name were built in Oldham in 2004. Bus and coach production having ceased in 1983 when the last Pennine 7 models were delivered. 1975 Seddon Atkinson 400 tractor, showing the bumper mounted headlights Originally the 1 January 1971 merger did not affect the lineup, with Seddon and Atkinson continuing to manufacture their old truck ranges in their respective plants. In 1975, however, a new unified range was presented with modern steel tilt cabs designed by Ogle developed together with Motor Panels. This consisted initially of the 400 series range, followed by the Seddon-based 200 Series in 1976 and then the 3-xle rigid 300 Series - higher numbers corresponding to a higher weight rating. The Atkinson works manufactured the heavier 400 series while Seddon's Oldham plant built all three lines. The 200 has a lower profile and narrower cab (with a correspondingly lower grille) than do the other two.Baldwin, p. 166 Meanwhile, the cabin of the 400 is mounted higher up than on the 300, necessitating a bigger front bumper with integrated headlights and different wheelwells. The 200 became the first \\"Truck of the Year\\", in 1977. The 200 and 300 both used International diesel engines, with the 300 having a inline-six with . The larger 400 was available with a range of diesels from Cummins, Gardner, or Rolls-Royce, with power outputs of up to . The 400 had a chassis which was mostly Atkinson. 1985 Seddon Atkinson 301 In 1981 the range was updated and became 201, 301, and 401. A few early 401s were built in Atkinson's Walton-le- Dale plant but then all production was shifted to Oldham. The 201 originally came equipped with the 200's International engine, although this was changed to a Perkins motor following the termination of Seddon Atkinson's relationship with International. The 401 also received an improved interior, the changed grille, and a much improved gear linkage. The Motor Panels trucks had severe rust problems, forcing the introduction of a new anti-corrosion package in the mid-eighties. This period also marks the beginning of the recession which killed off many of the companies which had been buying Seddon Atkinson's trucks. Enasa ownership In 1984, International Harvester sold Seddon Atkinson to Enasa of Spain, to make up for a planned Spanish I-H engine factory which had failed to materialize.Seddon goes to Enasa Commercial Motor 3 March 1984 Sales of Seddon Atkinsons dwindled through the 1980s. Both the 400 and 401 series received heavy complaints over insufficient rust protection on the cabin. In 1985 Seddon Atkinson held about five percent of the British truck market.Bennett, p. 15 1988 Seddon Atkinson 3-11 road tanker In the summer of 1986 the lineup received yet another overhaul, starting with the 201 which became the 2-11. A 3-11 (also available as a tractor) followed in October 1986, and there was also a short lived 4-11, identifiable by deflectors on the front corners. New engines and various other improvements under the shell were matched by updated, more aerodynamic designs by Ogle.Bennett, p. 13 The panels remained the same however. These were trucks intended to have a more premium feel and generally offered more powerful engines, in line with market trends of the day. The 2-11 was the first truck to be fitted with Perkins' new 6.0 litre \\"Phaser\\" motor. In spite of the added equipment and more powerful engine, the 2-11 is also lighter than its predecessor. There was a turbodiesel or a intercooled version. In 1988 the Strato range was launched, replacing the 401, using S-A's chassis combined with the more modern Pegaso cab from parent company Enasa (itself based on the DAF 95).Seddon Atkinson history, p. 7 In 1991 Iveco took over Enasa and acquired Seddon Atkinson as part of the deal. The Strato 2 subsequently utilised the Iveco Eurotech cabin. In 2005 production was moved to Iveco's Spanish facilities, but sales were low - only 284 units in the UK in 2005 - and in late 2006 it was announced that production of the niche Seddon Atkinsons had been stopped. The range had been sold across the UK by a network of 13 distributors, comprising a mix of dedicated Seddon Atkinson dealers together with dealers who also sell Iveco models. In December 2009, Iveco announced that the Seddon Atkinson brand would be withdrawn.End of the line for Seddon Atkinson Commercial Motor 4 January 2010 NotesSources and Bibliography Ref.

May Prize from International Mathematical Union In 2010, he was elected an Honorary Member of the Bertrand Russell Society. Grattan-Guinness spent much of his career at Middlesex University. He was a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, United States, and a member of the International Academy of the History of Science.Member profile, IAHS, retrieved 4 February 2015. From 1974 to 1981, Grattan-Guinness was editor of the history of science journal Annals of Science. In 1979 he founded the journal History and Philosophy of Logic, and edited it until 1992. He was an associate editor of Historia Mathematica for twenty years from its inception in 1974, and again from 1996. He also acted as advisory editor to the editions of the writings of C.S. Peirce and Bertrand Russell, and to several other journals and book series. He was a member of the Executive Committee of the International Commission on the History of Mathematics from 1977 to 1993. Grattan-Guinness gave over 570 invited lectures to organisations and societies, or to conferences and congresses, in over 20 countries around the world. These lectures include tours undertaken in Australia, New Zealand, Italy, South Africa and Portugal. From 1986 to 1988, Grattan-Guinness was the President of the British Society for the History of Mathematics, and for 1992 the Vice-President. In 1991, he was elected an effective member of the Acad√©mie Internationale d'Histoire des Sciences. He was the Associate Editor for mathematicians and statisticians for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004). Grattan-Guinness took an interest in the phenomenon of coincidence and has written on it for the Society for Psychical Research. He claimed to have a recurrent affinity with one particular number, namely the square of 15 (225), even recounting one occasion when a car was in front of him with the number plate IGG225, i.e. his very initials and that number. He died of heart failure on 12 December 2014, aged 73, survived by his wife Enid Grattan-Guinness. Work The work of Grattan- Guinness touched on all historical periods, but he specialised in the development of the calculus and mathematical analysis, and their applications to mechanics and mathematical physics, and in the rise of set theory and mathematical logic. He was especially interested in characterising how past thinkers, far removed from us in time, view their findings differently from the way we see them now (for example, Euclid). He has emphasised the importance of ignorance as an epistemological notion in this task. He did extensive research with original sources both published and unpublished, thanks to his reading and spoken knowledge of the main European languages. Selected publicationsBooks written= * 1970.

The central theme of the book is the rise of logicism, thanks to the efforts of Frege, Bertrand Russell, and Alfred Whitehead, and its demise due to G√∂del and indifference. Whole chapters are devoted to the emergence of algebraic logic in the 19th century UK, Cantor and the emergence of set theory, the emergence of mathematical logic in Germany told in a way that downplays Frege's importance, and to Peano and his followers. There follow four chapters devoted to the ideas of the young Bertrand Russell, the writing of both The Principles of Mathematics and Principia Mathematica, and to the mixed reception the ideas and methods encountered over the period 1910‚Äì40. The book touches on the rise of model theory as well as proof theory, and on the emergence of American research on the foundation of mathematics, especially in the hands of E. H. Moore and his students, of the postulate theorists, and of Quine. While Polish logic is often mentioned, it is not covered systematically. Finally, the book is a contribution to the history of philosophy as well as of mathematics. =Books edited= * 2003.

After a meeting with Drummond, the three programmers decide to try out the game with the help of Clayton Software intern Laura Wheeler. The game involves a motion capture suit that is connected to the computer network and used to program the game's movements. Peter places a backup CD into the external drive while the others set up. Bug, Hardcore, and Sol soon lose the game, and are surprised to see Laura get all the way to the final boss. Sol inserts his new AI chip into the mainframe and begins to play the game. As he advances to the game's third level, the motion capture suit connected to the computer network comes alive. Simultaneously, the suit attacks Sol in real life while an in-game monster drags Sol's video game character away. The following morning, Bug and Hardcore discover that Sol has been killed and the backup CD has been stolen. Hardcore attempts to review the security camera tapes with his PDA, but accidentally touches the motion capture suit, which has merged itself with Sol's dead body. The suit attacks Hardcore; although he initially manages to fight it off, he is later killed. The suit then merges itself with Hardcore's muscular body and takes all of his weapons, giving it a striking resemblance to the monster in the game. Bug theorizes that the lightning strike combined with Sol's powerful AI chip and Hardcore‚Äôs rewiring of the system (so he could fill the building‚Äôs mainframe with his weapons) has caused the suit to believe the real world is part of the video game. Bug, Laura and Drummond decide to pull the computer's plug, although doing so will likely erase all of the game's data. While Bug tries to figure out which set of wires to pull, Drummond is attacked by the monster. With Bug's help, Drummond manages to escape, but the security system malfunctions, seals all exits, and leaves Laura, Bug, and Drummond in near darkness. Bug travels through ceiling shafts and falls into the kitchen area, where he is attacked by the monster. As the monster draws closer, Bug exposes a gas line and lights his lighter, killing both himself and the monster. The monster returns to the motion-capture suit and attacks Drummond, but Laura saves him by virtually fighting the in-game monster. Laura later tries to beat the game but becomes frustrated and hysterical. Drummond suggests that she try a virtual reality headset, promising to stay with her while she fights. However, in the midst of the game, Laura realizes Drummond has left her. The monster appears and, in the real world, Laura escapes to the kitchen. There she finds Hardcore‚Äôs PDA displaying a video of Drummond stealing the game's backup CD the night of Sol's death; had Drummond not stolen it, the CD would have allowed the programmers to reverse compile the game and shut down the monster. Laura finds and confronts Drummond at gun point, forcing him to drop the CD. Drummond makes a speech stating that Laura is naive and that everyone is ultimately a monster, before mocking her with this sentence: \\"You will learn, intern. You will learn.\\" Laura shoots him in the knee and allows the monster to kill him. Laura then dons the VR headset and gloves, acquires a sword, and simultaneously battles the monster in both the real and virtual world. In the real world, she lures the suit toward a fish tank and electrocutes it with the water inside. She then stabs the monster with her sword, finally killing the monster. With everyone else who made the game dead, Laura turns in the final version of the game and demands the million dollar bonus for herself. The whole event has changed her, making her more jaded and world weary. The video game finally impresses the game testers. Laura uses the game's success to become the new ruthless CEO of the company, which is renamed Wheeler Software. In the last minutes of the film, Laura is seen interviewing a new female intern. It is then revealed that shortly after killing the monster, Laura, who was still wearing the VR headset at the time, took a glance at the water puddle below. What was reflected is not Laura's or her virtual character's face, but the monster's face. The implication here is that by letting Drummond get killed, Laura has discarded her last shred of humanity and now become just as evil as he was- a monster. It is unknown if this is part of the game's ending code, glitch, or simply Laura's subconscious telling her how far she has crossed the line. Regardless, Laura then repeated Drummond's mocking sentence to her at the new intern: \\"You will learn, intern. You will learn.\\" Cast *Steven Culp as Peter S.

Exostoses can cause chronic pain ranging from mild to debilitatingly severe, depending on the shape, size, and location of the lesion. It is most commonly found in places like the ribs, where small bone growths form, but sometimes larger growths can grow on places like the ankles, knees, shoulders, elbows and hips. Very rarely are they on the skull. Exostoses are sometimes shaped like spurs, such as calcaneal spurs. Osteomyelitis, a bone infection, may leave the adjacent bone with exostosis formation. Charcot foot, the neuropathic breakdown of the feet seen primarily in diabetics, can also leave bone spurs that may then become symptomatic. They normally form on the bones of joints, and can grow upwards. For example, if an extra bone formed on the ankle, it might grow up to the shin. When used in the phrases \\"cartilaginous exostosis\\" or \\"osteocartilaginous exostosis\\", the term is considered synonymous with osteochondroma. Some sources consider the two terms to mean the same thing even without qualifiers, but this interpretation is not universal. Osteophytes Osteophytes are bone spurs that develop on the margins of joints secondary to external stimuli such as osteoarthritis.Page 171 in: However, these are not always distinguished from exostoses in any definite way. Fossil record Evidence for exostosis found in the fossil record is studied by paleopathologists, specialists in ancient disease and injury. Exostosis has been reported in dinosaur fossils from several species, including Acrocanthosaurus atokensis, Albertosaurus sarcophagus, Allosaurus fragilis, Gorgosaurus libratus, and Poekilopleuron bucklandii.Molnar, R. E., 2001, Theropod paleopathology: a literature survey: In: Mesozoic Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D. H., and Carpenter, K., Indiana University Press, p. 337-363. Hereditary multiple exostoses Hereditary multiple exostoses (HME), also called hereditary multiple osteochondromas (HMO), is a condition that is estimated to affect 1 in 50,000 individuals. Multiple benign or noncancerous bone tumors develop in the affected individuals. The number and location vary among affected patients. Most people seem unaffected at birth; however, by the age of 12 years, they develop multiple exostoses. Affected individuals commonly complain of palpable and recognizable lumps (exostoses) at about the knees and in the forearms. The condition characteristically occurs bilaterally. It may lead to mild degrees of growth retardation and limb asymmetry. Genu valgum (commonly known as \\"knock-knees\\"), ankle valgus, and bowing and shortening of one or both of the forearm bones are common manifestations.

Typically, manufactured glass contains around 15% sodium oxide, 70% silica (silicon dioxide) and 9% lime (calcium oxide). The sodium carbonate \\"soda\\" serves as a flux to lower the temperature at which the silica mixture melts. Soda glass has a much lower melting temperature than pure silica, and has slightly higher elasticity. These changes arise because the silicon dioxide and soda have reacted to form sodium silicates of the general formula Na2[SiO2]x[SiO3]. :Na2CO3 ‚Üí Na2O + CO2 :Na2O + SiO2 ‚Üí Na2SiO3 ReferencesExternal links * Sodium oxide information at Webelements.

In the September primary election, Baptiste received 38% of the vote, Kouchi received 35%, and Valenciano won 21%, allowing Baptiste and Kouchi to advance to the runoff. In the runoff Baptiste defeated Kouchi, winning 12,174 votes to Kouchi's 10,517. In 2006, Baptiste avoided a runoff by two votes (he needed fifty percent of the vote plus one vote to win), joking, \\"We had one vote more than we needed to win.

California's eight Channel Islands lie within the Bight.Dailey, M. D., Reish, D. J., Anderson, J. W. (editors), 1993. Ecology of the Southern California Bight: A Synthesis and Interpretation. University of California Press, Berkeley / Los Angeles / London, 926 pp. The region is known for having a climate similar to that of the Mediterranean consisting of rainy winters and dry summers. The Southern California Bight has a thriving ecosystem that is home to many species of plant life, fish, birds, and mammals. Satellite view of the Southern California Bight, including the Channel Islands.  History Various Native American peoples occupied the lands in and around the Southern California Bight for tens of thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans. When Spanish explorers arrived in the 16th century the Chumash people occupied the northern coastal region of the byte, as well as the four Northern Channel Islands, and the Tongva (or Gabriele√±o) occupied the Los Angeles Basin and Southern Channel Islands. In 1542, at present day San Diego Bay, Juan Rodr√≠guez Cabrillo of Spain, along with his crew, were the first European explorers to land in the region. Cabrillo is said to have been buried on one of the Channel Islands. The first permanent European settlers of the Southern California Bight, led by Juan P√©rez, arrived in 1769 on the San Antonio. The Spanish government had planned a three-part occupation plan to check the Russians‚Äô settlement in Alta California. In 2013-14, scientists witnessed the largest die-off of sea stars ever recorded along the Pacific Coast. The outbreak of sea star wasting disease caused significant changes to the ecosystem as sea stars are a keystone species that plays an important role in controlling the numbers of other creatures.Netburn, Deborah (November 26, 2014) \\"Scientists find likely culprit behind mysterious sea star deaths\\" Los Angeles Times Climate The climate of the region that constitutes the Southern California Bight is consistent throughout the area. There is a difference in monthly mean temperature of between the cities of Los Angeles and San Diego. Most precipitation in this coastal area takes place in the months of December, January, and February with a monthly mean rate of Biology The Southern California Bight acts as a transition between many different water masses, including the Pacific subarctic, Pacific equatorial, and the North Pacific central water masses. Due to its central location, the fish fauna includes species native to these other water masses. A total of 481 species of California marine fish, 195 species of birds, and seven species of pinnipeds inhabit the Southern California Bight. =Phytoplankton= Phytoplankton serve an important role in the Southern Californian coastal ecosystem. These single-celled organisms are the main food source for zooplankton and help support the fish population. In doing so, they help establish a stable food chain for all the animals in the coastal region. Since the population of fish is directly related to the production of phytoplankton, the growth in phytoplankton numbers increases the yield of local fisheries. =Fish= Basking sharks (Cetorhinus maximus) are being studied through a research program begun in 2009 by NOAA. Common fish found in the epipelagic zone include: * Northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) * Pacific mackerel (Scomber australasicus) * Pacific bonito (Sarda chiliensis) *Yellowtail (Seriola lalandi dorsalis) *Blue shark (Prionace glauca) *Swordfish (Xiphias gladius) Common fish found in the neritic zone include: *Queenfish (Seriphus politus) *White croaker (Genyonemus lineatus) *Pacific butterfish (Peprilus simillimus) *Walleye surfperch (Hyperprosopon anale) Common fish found in the rocky intertidal zone include: *Woody sculpin (Clinocottus analis) *Rockpool blenny (Hypsoblennius gilberti) *Spotted kelpfish (Gibbonsia elegans) Many different species of fish rely on the kelp forests as a source of life. Populations of fish are larger in areas with a higher concentration of kelp. Fish that live in and rely on kelp forests include kelp surfperch (Brachyistius frenatus), kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus), giant kelpfish (Heterostichus rostratus), and kelp rockfish (Sebastes atrovirens). A study conducted near San Luis Obispo, California showed that when kelp was removed from a nearby reef, fish biomass declined by 63%. Juvenile fish rely on kelp beds a nursery grounds. Southern California Edison built a off San Clemente in 2008. =Birds= The Southern California Bight is home to 195 species of birds, including endangered species such as the light-footed clapper rail (Rallus longirostris levipes). Some birds nest and hunt near bodies of waters, such as bays, harbors, and oceans, including areas where kelp grows. Some species, such as the brown pelican and some species of cormorants commonly dive head first into the water, attempting to catch fish. Other species of birds, such as grebes and loons migrate from Baja California over the nearshore waters, and will stop to fish and feed. Birds that live in the rocky shore have adapted to finding food, and specialize in prying grabbing prey that clings to the rocky shore. Common birds of the rocky seashore include black oystercatchers (Haemotopus bachmani), wandering tattlers (Heteroscelus incanus), and Surfbirds (Aphorize virgata). Other birds, such as sandpipers, egrets, and herons utilize tidal patterns, venturing out to rocks during low tide in hopes of catching prey. Non-seabirds also nest on rocky seashore surfaces. Peregrine falcons and ravens are known to nest on remote sea cliffs. Sandy beaches are inhabited by plovers, terns, marbled godwits (Limosa fedoa), and several species of gulls. =Marine mammals= Due to its central location of warm and cool ocean currents, the Southern California Bight sees a wide variety of marine mammals. Some reside here regularly, some pass through on migratory routes, and others only show up to utilize a certain food source. The Marine Mammal Protection Act and Endangered Species Act helped to prevent any marine mammal \\"take\\", which entails hunting, harassing, exploiting marine mammals for their pelt, meat, oil, etc. Pinnipeds The most abundant pinnipeds in the Southern California Bight are the California sea lions. Northern elephant seals are known to have breeding grounds in the Southern California Bight, mostly on San Miguel and San Nicolas islands. Sea otters were once common in the Southern California Bight, but due to hunting, they have since mostly retreated to northern waters. Otter sightings in the Southern California Bight happen rarely. Cetaceans Blue whales use the Southern California Bight as a part of their migratory routes. They leave Baja California by early summer, and are usually present in the Southern California Bight in June. Gray whales also pass through the Southern California Bight on their migration routes, typically migrating very close to land. They pass through the Southern California Bight on their southbound route from December through February towards Baja California, and return northbound towards southern Alaska, passing the Southern California Bight from February to May. Their migration patterns are among the longest of any mammal, spanning over 10,000 miles. The common dolphin is the most abundant cetacean in the Southern California Bight. Common dolphins typically appear in the Southern California Bight during years with warmer water, and are more abundant in the summer and winter. Natural resources The Southern California Bight is characterized by coastal and offshore oil reserves. For the past century, the offshore areas of coastal cities such as Goleta, Santa Monica, and Huntington Beach have been home to oil extraction sites. With the presence of these oil reserves comes the construction of relative infrastructure including pipelines. Other primary resources that come from the Southern California Bight region include anchovies, sardines, mackerel, and bass. The thriving marine life and accessible seafood source has led to the development of harbors and marinas all across the Southern California coast.

The premise involves a woman with con-artist tendencies who worms her way into the life of a reserved architect by claiming to be his wife. Plot Newton Davis (Steve Martin) is a struggling architect. After building his dream house for himself and his longtime girlfriend Becky (Dana Delany) in his hometown, he is crushed when she refuses to marry him. He is unable to bring himself to live in the house, and leaves it abandoned and with a debt he cannot afford. Some time later, Newton meets a waitress named Gwen (Goldie Hawn) at a Hungarian restaurant in Boston. Believing that she cannot speak English, he spills out his sob story about Becky and the abandoned house. After the restaurant closes for the night, Newton learns she merely pretended to be Hungarian, and can speak English. He walks her home, which turns out to be a small apartment upstairs at the restaurant. They end up having sex. The next morning, Gwen finds that Newton left in the middle of the night. However, he unintentionally left behind the drawing of the house he'd built for Becky. Interest piqued by the drawing, Gwen takes a bus ride out to see the house. She is charmed by it, and decides to move in. Gwen goes to the town's general store, where she charges her groceries to the \\"Newton Davis\\" account. When questioned about this, Gwen, who it becomes clear is a natural liar, says that she is Newton's wife. Gwen meets Becky, and spins a lengthy romantic story about how they fell in love, which surprises and impresses Becky. Gwen also meets Newton's parents, who are heartbroken that Newton got \\"married\\" without telling them, but Gwen manages to smooth things over with them with her charm. Soon after, Newton travels to his hometown and is shocked to see that his house is lived in. When he finds out what Gwen has done he is initially furious, but he soon sees the potential in her being there. Gwen starts creating all sorts of opportunities for Newton: mending his relationship with his parents, helping out with his career by befriending Newton's boss and highlighting his long- ignored talent, and making Becky jealous. Newton and Gwen come to an agreement in which Gwen will help Newton win Becky, and in return she'll get all the furniture in the house. Through their time together, Newton begins to rely more on Gwen beyond their agreement, and Gwen starts to feel attached to her life with Newton. It is also revealed that Gwen became a compulsive liar in order to escape from what she feels is her own inadequate background, and that she has \\"changed\\" her life numerous times. The film culminates with a reception held at the house in which the sub-plots of Newton's career, family and affections for Becky are brought together. Annoyed with Becky for her superior and suspicious attitude, Gwen confronts her in front of everyone, accusing her of trying to win Newton back. Gwen storms out of the house in tears, and Newton follows her, thinking it is still part of the plan. Outside alone, Newton praises Gwen for her brilliance, but Gwen replies that she wanted their marriage to work. Her feelings for him are apparent. Newton's boss gives him the promotion. Newton watches, confused, as Gwen leaves. Becky takes the opportunity to make a move on Newton, and asks whether all of Gwen's elaborate stories were real. Newton answers that they were all true and chases after Gwen. Newton stops Gwen as she is about to board a bus to leave town. Although she resists, Newton follows her example and begins telling an outlandish romantic story of something they \\"did\\", which makes Gwen decide to stay. The film ends on the note of Newton and Gwen being happily married and living together in the house. As Newton and Gwen go into the house to have sex, the final spoken words are of Newton saying \\"I love you, Gwen\\" and Gwen replying, \\"Actually, it's Jessica.\\" Cast * Steve Martin as Newton Davis * Goldie Hawn as Gwen Duncle/Buckley/Phillips * Dana Delany as Becky Metcalf * Julie Harris as Edna Davis * Donald Moffat as George Davis * Peter MacNicol as Marty * Richard B.

Killer Moth originally wore a garish costume of purple and green striped fabric, with an orange cape and a moth-like mask. Publication history Killer Moth's debut Killer Moth first appeared in Batman #63 (February 1951) and was created by Bill Finger, Dick Sprang, and Lew Schwartz. Fictional character biographies\\"Cameron van Cleer\\"= The original Killer Moth was a prisoner identified only by his prison number, 234026. While in prison, he reads a newspaper article about Batman and decides to set himself up as the \\"anti-Batman\\", hiring himself out to Gotham City's criminals to help them elude capture by police. Upon his release, he uses the hidden proceeds of his crimes to build a \\"Mothcave\\", modeled on the photos of the Batcave in the newspaper article he read. Killer Moth also establishes a false identity as millionaire philanthropist Cameron van Cleer. In this guise, he becomes friends with Bruce Wayne. Meanwhile, he promotes himself to Gotham's criminals using his identity as Killer Moth, giving them each an infrared Moth-Signal. In his first job, he rescues some criminals from the police and then uses his Mothmobile to defeat and capture Batman and Robin. The duo escape and lead Killer Moth to a climactic battle on Gotham Bridge, in which he is defeated. In his third appearance (Detective Comics #173 (July 1951)) Killer Moth kidnaps Bruce Wayne and learns his secret identity. However, he is shot by other criminals and the resultant cranial injury causes amnesia. He remains a persistent enemy through the Silver Age of Comic Books, being the first villain Batgirl encounters in Detective Comics #359 (January 1967). He teams up with the Cavalier twice: the first time in Batman Family #10 (March-April 1977), where they battle Batgirl and Batwoman (Kathy Kane, who comes out of retirement for the first time in years) and the second (and final) time in Batman Family #15 (December 1977-January 1978), where they battle Batgirl and Robin. =Drury Walker= In the 1990s, in the Post-Crisis continuity, Killer Moth's real identity is revealed as Drury Walker, an unsuccessful criminal whom no one takes seriously. He again adopts the false identity of Cameron van Cleer and the persona of Killer Moth to fight Batman. This version first appears in Batman: Shadow of the Bat #7-9 (December 1992-February 1993), with a more detailed origin story appearing in Batgirl: Year One #1-9 (February- October 2003). In Batman: Shadow of the Bat #7-9, Killer Moth sets up a team called \\"the Misfits\\", comprising Batman villains such as the Catman and the Calendar Man, to make another kidnapping attempt on Bruce Wayne, as well as other prominent citizens. This team proves unsuccessful, turning against Killer Moth when they realize he plans to kill the hostages. He is one of the villains who sells their souls to the demon-lord Neron in Underworld Unleashed #1 (November 1995) and in Robin (vol. 2) #23-24 (December 1995-January 1996), where he asks to become feared instead of always being laughed at. He is metamorphosed into a carnivorous moth-like monster called Charaxes. As Charaxes, Walker resembles a vaguely humanoid, giant brown moth. He consumes humans and spins cocoons in which to keep his prey. In a later story, Charaxes begins laying hundreds of eggs, all of which hatch into duplicates of Drury Walker. Charaxes despises his progeny, but is unable to destroy them. Following his capture, these duplicates are taken into government custody. During an argument between various bodies as to what should be done with them, they attack a scientist and are killed.Robin (vol. 2) #107-110 (Dec. 2002-March 2003) At around the same time, the Oracle is confronted by a criminal named Danko Twag who claims to be the \\"real\\" Killer Moth (the one she had defeated), and that Drury Walker had been an impostor. During a rant in which he claims they are going to be a team, she captures him in an energy cell and he seemingly disintegrates himself.Birds of Prey #50-52 (Feb-April 2003) In Infinite Crisis, Charaxes is killed by being ripped in half by Superboy-Prime during the Battle of Metropolis. In order to ensure the existence of Batman, Rip Hunter tells Booster Gold and Skeets that they have to make sure Wiley Dalbert, a time-travelling criminal who had hired Killer Moth, completes his crime successfully. Booster does this by dressing up as Killer Moth and taking his place. During the robbery, he is forced to fight with Batman and Robin and takes them both down. An unfortunate, unintended side effect of this is that, when they return to the present, Gotham still has no Batman and Killer Moth is now a serious threat, thanks to the \\"street cred\\" from the robbery.Booster Gold (vol. 2) #11 (October 2008) Booster, Skeets and his sister Goldstar attempt to fix the anomaly they created by taking Batman's place in the robbery, but things go wrong when Alfred Pennyworth intervenes; the Time Masters barely escape in the Batmobile. Instead they steal Batgirl's costume and purchase an Elvis costume for Booster. Booster stops the version of him dressed as Killer Moth from defeating Batman and makes sure that Wiley gets away with the loot, thus restoring the timeline.Booster Gold (vol. 2) #12 (November 2008) During the Adventure Comics series' Blackest Night tie-in story, Charaxes is reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps.Adventure Comics (vol. 2) #4 (November 2009) Superboy-Prime destroys Charaxes on Earth Prime, using the black ring cycling through the power set, resulting in a burst of colored energy that destroys Black Lanterns.Adventure Comics (vol. 2) #5 (December 2009) In The New 52, a more serious, less garish Drury Walker/Killer Moth appears as an enemy of Green Arrow. Green Arrow (vol. 5) #25 This version, preferring the title \\"Moth\\", utilizes a gas mask and a compression gun which he calls a \\"Stinger\\". Moth later appeared as a member of Richard Dragon's Longbow Hunters.Green Arrow (vol. 5) #31 In DC Rebirth, Killer Moth is again Drury Walker, a low-level criminal sporting a purple outfit and helmet.Detective Comics #958 He first appeared in the \\"Zero Year\\" story arc in which he was defeated by both Batman and Green Arrow, teaming up for the first time.Green Arrow (vol. 5) #25 =Unknown= A new Killer Moth appears in Batman #652, during the Face the Face storyline wherein he displays competence in hand-to-hand combat and the ability of flight when facing Robin. He later appears working alongside fellow Gotham criminals the Firefly and Lock-Up in the Gotham Underground miniseries. The identity and origins of this new Killer Moth remain unrevealed. Several villains clad in Killer Moth costumes appear in Secret Six (vol. 3) #7. At least one of them is killed by Deadshot. Killer Moth recently appeared in the first issue of the miniseries Justice League: Cry for Justice. He was hired by Prometheus to kidnap and torture Mike Dante, ex-assistant to Atom ally Professor Hyatt. The two current holders of the Atom identity, Ray Palmer and Ryan Choi, tracked Killer Moth and his goons down to a hideout in Albuquerque, New Mexico and defeated them all. Ray Palmer then tortured Killer Moth by entering his head via the nasal pathways and growing inside his skull. Killer Moth immediately gave up Prometheus as his employer. In Red Robin #9, Red Robin returns to Gotham City where he runs into Killer Moth in his classic costume, holding a man at gunpoint. Red Robin thinks to himself: \\"I think this is Killer Moth. The costume and the man change from time to time, so you can never really tell\\". This Killer Moth seems to be scared and on the run, stating: \\"Are you with him? Are you with the Atom? I won't let you torture me, too!\\" Powers and abilities In his original incarnation, Killer Moth has no superhuman abilities; he relies on the vast array of equipment he has developed. Killer Moth‚Äôs range of gimmicks includes a Mothmobile, a Moth-Signal, and a steel line, which allows him to swing through the skies as if he were flying. He carries a cocoon gun that fires a stream of sticky threads that can totally envelop a victim. The gun can also fire a grenade. As Charaxes, he has superhuman strength, agility and endurance, an exoskeleton that gives him some protection from physical and energy attacks, a set of wings that allows him to fly, sharp claws and sharp, prehensile antennae. Charaxes secretes a sticky acidic substance that can trap the strongest of men and dissolve their bodies. In DC Rebirth, he uses a highly compressed air gun to great effect as a weapon, shown to be powerful enough to stop a bullet in mid-air. Other versionsTeen Titans Go!= In the Teen Titans Go! comic book series, Killer Moth was the second villain to arrive at the tower for the Titans' Party Party and informed them that he only attended to spend more time with Silkie. Throughout the party, he cuddled with the mutant moth larva until Robin ordered all the villains to leave, including Killer Moth. Killer Moth attacked Jump City and told the Titans they were outmatched. He noticed Cyborg, who had been disguised, and asked about his identity. Beast Boy lied to him, telling him that Cyborg was their brand new Killer Robot Titan and asked Killer Moth if he wanted to see how he fared against one. The villain, however, immediately left. =Batman: Arkham Knight= In Batman: Arkham Knight's prequel comic, after the events of Batman: Arkham Origins, following the defeat of Black Mask, Drury Walker checked out books from Barbara Gordon at the local library about moths and staked out her and her father, the newly- promoted Commissioner Gordon, which Barbara noticed. Later, at a GCPD panel that proved Batman was simply a man with gadgets instead of some 'paranormal entity', Killer Moth crashed it to advertise his services with a free trial of killing Commissioner Gordon while his henchmen kept Batman preoccupied on the other side of Gotham. Barbara quickly put on the sample Batman costume, managed to defeat Killer Moth's henchmen, and disarmed the villain. After he realized that his plans were falling apart, Killer Moth threw Gordon off the rafters to kill him and used that as a diversion for his escape. As Barbara saved her father, Walker made his escape and tried to calm himself down by saying that Batgirl was just a girl in a suit like Batman, who happened to arrive just in time and subdued him. =Injustice 2= Killer Moth appears in the prequel comic to Injustice 2. Following the events of the first game, Killer Moth is shown to be a member of this universe's Suicide Squad,Injustice 2 #1 but after an impostor Batman (later revealed to be Jason Todd) surprisingly appears and takes control of the Squad, he kills Killer Moth using the bomb implanted in his neck, considering him to be useless.Injustice 2 #2 In other mediaTelevision= * A short episode of the 1960s live- action Batman television series that premiered Batgirl featured Killer Moth as the villain (played by Tim Herbert), but it was never aired. It had been circulated through bootlegs on the Internet or at conventions, and in 2014 was finally released as a bonus feature (Bat Rarities! Straight from the Vault) in the official complete DVD/Blu-ray sets.Batman: The Complete Television Series, Warner Bros., 2014. In the character's simultaneous comic book introduction (Detective Comics #359, January 1967), \\"The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl\\", Killer Moth is Batgirl's first and main adversary after he leads her to believe that he killed Bruce Wayne. Batgirl later learns that Wayne has not died after confronting Batman and Robin. * When asked about Killer Moth's inclusion in The New Batman Adventures producer Bruce Timm expressed little interest and joked that the only way they would use him is if they can cast Canadian actor Dan Aykroyd for the role, and have him running around screaming, \\"I'm a bug!\\". Producer Alan Burnett, on the other hand, stated, \\"we just haven't thought of a good story for him yet\\". Ultimately, Killer Moth never appeared in the series.http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/sections/backstage/unused/batman/killermoth.php Teen Titans * Killer Moth appears in the Teen Titans, voiced by Thomas Haden Church and later voiced by Marc Worden. In the episode \\"Date with Destiny\\", he is introduced as a criminal who has been bio-engineering mutant moth creatures with the intention of using them to take over the city. At the prodding of his spoiled daughter Kitten (voiced by Tara Strong), whose boyfriend Fang (voiced by Will Friedle) recently broke up with her, Killer Moth uses the invading creatures to blackmail Robin into taking Kitten to her junior prom. His plan is foiled when Robin breaks the device which controls his moths (which was in Kitten's possession) and Killer Moth, Fang and Kitten are taken to jail. Killer Moth returns in the episode \\"Can I Keep Him?\\", where he turns Starfire's pet larva named Silkie (a.k.a. Larva M-319) into a giant moth to attack the Titans. He is eventually taken down by his own creation when Silkie decides that he prefers Starfire over Killer Moth after exploding back into a larva. Killer Moth and Kitten later become members of the Brotherhood of Evil. The two join in the final battle against the Titans in \\"Calling All Titans\\" wherein Kitten fights with a laser-whip, while Killer Moth attacks Starfire with a large swarm of moths. Since the battle ends off-screen in \\"Titans Together\\", and since Starfire later reappears inside the Brain's base to rescue Beast Boy's group along with the Bumblebee and Red Star, it is assumed that either Starfire won the fight off-screen or at least was able to escape capture. Killer Moth is literally put on ice (with the other Brotherhood members) when M√°s y Menos send him through Professor Chang's flash-freezing machine. The Batman * Killer Moth appears in the series The Batman, voiced by Jeff Bennett. Because of his costume's colors, it is easy to assume that this is the Drury Walker version. The character is a physically weak coffee boy for the Penguin's gang in the episode \\"Team Penguin\\". He is later transformed into a massive, powerful version of Charaxes after being exposed to chemical fumes and radioactive moths dissolving into his skin during a robbery with the Penguin. Killer Moth still maintains his milquetoast personality and poor combat abilities, despite his size and strength. Seeing that his new form entitles him to some respect, Killer Moth intimidates the Rag Doll, the Firefly and Killer Croc into obeying the Penguin; Killer Moth held great respect for the Penguin, hence his actions, not aware that the Penguin was also initially afraid of him. Killer Moth's Charaxes form is later seen very briefly in the episode \\"Rumors\\" being captured by the vigilante Rumor and is later defeated by Batman and Robin along with every other villain. * Killer Moth is featured in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Corey Burton. In this version, he wears his classic purple and orange costume, probably indicating that the Killer Moth featured is Drury Walker (who once used the alias of Cameron von Cleer in the Pre-Crisis comics). In \\"Legends of the Dark Mite\\", Killer Moth is among the Batman villains in Bat- Mite's fantasy. He is taken down by the real Batman. In \\"A Bat Divided\\", Killer Moth is seen in a bar where the other villains hang out. In \\"Gorillas in Our Midst\\", he robs an armored truck alongside his henchmen. Killer Moth is defeated by B'wana Beast and the Vixen. In the teaser for \\"The Last Patrol\\", he kidnaps Batman and almost feeds him to the Atlas Moth in his lair.

The story concerns the stalking and brutal murders of various scantily-clad fashion models, committed by a masked killer in a desperate attempt to obtain a scandal-revealing diary. The film was an Italian, West German, and French co-production between the small Italian company Emmepi Cinematgrafici, Monarchia Film and George de Beauregard. According to the credited assistant director Bertrand Tavernier the Italian credits were scams for film funding and he had never went to Italy or met anyone from the production. These credits continue into the screenwriting credits, where different sources and ministerial papers suggest different authors credited to developing the story of the film. The majority of the other technical staff were previous collaborators with Bava. Blood and Black Lace was shot in Rome in late 1963 with an international cast of actors who read their lines either fluently or phonetically on set and the film was made with a lower budget than Bava's previous horror films. The film premiered in Rome on March 14, 1964 where it was not a commercial success as it was not among the top 100 highest grossing domestic releases in Italy that year. The film's contemporary and retrospective reviews commented on the visual style of the film, while some found the plot of the film to be weak with few little characterization. Later critics described the film as being among the first Giallo films despite not starting a trend in the genre. After the release of Dario Argento's The Bird with the Crystal Plumage in 1970, a wave of gialli films were made in Italy which led some being highly similar to Blood and Black Lace. The film has since been references in films by directors such as Martin Scorsese and Pedro Almod√≥var and has been placed on several \\"best of\\" lists related to thriller, horror and slasher films.  Plot  In Rome, Isabella, one of many beautiful models employed at a fashion house, is walking through the grounds that lead to the establishment one night when she is attacked and violently killed by an assailant wearing a white featureless mask. Police Inspector Silvestri is assigned to investigate the murder and he interviews Massimo Morlacchi, the manager who co-manages the salon with his lover, the recently widowed Countess Cristiana Cuomo. Morlacchi attests that he cannot provide any information whatsoever to assist the inspector, and it is revealed that Isabella had kept a diary detailing these vices and personal lives of the staff of the fashion house. Nicole finds the diary, and promises to provide it to the police, but Peggy manages to steal it from her purse during work. That night, Nicole drives to an antique store owned by her paramour, Franco. He is not there, and while inside she suddenly finds herself stalked by a black clad figure. She is caught by the figure who raises and slams a spiked glove into her face, killing her instantly. The murderer searches the corpse and her purse for the diary which he can not find, leading the killer to escape out of the shop. The murderer next visits Peggy's apartment. The killer gains entrance simply by knocking on the front door, and when Peggy opens it, the masked figure abruptly walks inside. The assailant slaps and hits her repeatedly, and she explains that she no longer has the diary and had in fact burned it in the fireplace. When her attacker checks the fireplace to see if she has told the truth, she tries to pick up a telephone to call for help. Enraged, the murderer hits her repeatedly in the face until she is knocked unconscious. The assailant then carries her away just as the police arrive. Peggy is taken to another location and tied to a chair. The killer tortures her, demanding to know where the diary is. The woman reaches up and knocks off the mask. The shocked girl recognizes her assailant, who proceeds to kill her brutally by slowly pressing her face against the red-hot surface of a burning furnace. Silvestri is convinced that the murderer is one of the men employed at the fashion house, so he arrests all of those he believes might be related to the deaths. While the suspects are in custody, Greta discovers Peggy's corpse hidden in the trunk of her car, and is then attacked and smothered to death by the killer. After discovering the bodies of the latest victims, Silvestri releases all of the men from questioning. Morlacchi visits Cristiana and reminds her about how he had assisted in the murder of her husband. Isabella had found out that Morlacchi had been involved in the crime, and began blackmailing him. When she started asking for more and more money, Morlacchi murdered her. It was only later that Morlacchi and Cristiana realized she had been keeping a diary that revealed everything. While attempting to retrieve the diary, Morlacchi had also killed Nicole and Peggy. When Morlacchi and the other men from the agency were placed under arrest, Cristiana had murdered Greta to give Morlacchi an alibi for the previous killings. Now, Morlacchi tells Cristiana that he once again needs her help and convinces her that after only one more death they will be safe. That night, the voluptuous Tao-Li is drowned in her bathtub by the masked killer who, immediately after the murder, removes the mask and is revealed as Cristiana. She uses a razor blade to slice the corpse's wrists in order to make the death seem like a suicide. Cristiana prepares to leave the victim's apartment when she is interrupted by a knocking sound on the front door followed by the loud voice of a man identifying himself as the police. She decides to escape out the second story window and then tries to climb down a drainpipe, which falls under her weight, slamming her to the ground. Later that night, Morlacchi searches through Cristiana‚Äôs desk, looking for money and documents. Suddenly, a bloody and bruised Cristiana enters the room, shakily holding a gun aimed directly at Morlacchi. He had been the \\"policeman\\" knocking on Tao-Li‚Äôs door, and, knowing how Cristiana would attempt to escape, he had deliberately broken the drainpipe in such a way that it would be guaranteed to collapse. He attempts to persuade his lover and almost succeeds in getting her to hand over the gun, but she abruptly changes her mind and shoots him to death. The mortally wounded Cristiana collapses next to Morlacchi's corpse.  Cast  Cast adapted from the book Mario Bava: All the Colors of the Dark. Style In West Germany, a film genre called krimis which were murder mystery films inspired by the works of Edgar Wallace with the first being Der Frosch mit der Maske released in 1959. These films were first made in black and white, but later made in colour and were regularly imported to Italy. Italian film historian Stefano Baschiera spoke about their influence on Italian cinema, noting that Italian popular cinema attempted their own style of the krimi as they had done previously with Hammer horror films and American genre films by \\"using their \\"tested\\" imagery in order to satisfy the demand of a national market.\\" Another rising trend of the early 1960s followed the success of the Terence Fisher's film Dracula in Italy, which led to the rise in popularity of pulp paper back novels, comics and photonovels that had involved horror, mystery and crime stories that included elements of eroticism. Italian film historian and critic Roberto Curti compared the plot of Blood and Black Lace as being lifted from the themes of these novels as well as adapting elements of the krimi, with a \\"mysterious villain with sadistic tendencies\\" that was seen in films like Karl Anton's The Avenger or Franz Josef Gottlieb's The Black Abbot. While Bava had explored the elements of suspense and eroticism in the film genre that would become the giallo with The Girl Who Knew Too Much which involved a woman who witnesses a murder and becomes the target of a serial killer, and the segment \\"The Telephone\\" from Black Sabbath, in which a female prostitute finds herself being blackmailed as she is just undressing for the night. The term giallo is used in Italy to describe all mystery and thriller fiction, English critics used them to describe more specific films within the genre, involving a murder mystery that revels in the details of the murder rather than the deduction of it or police procedural elements. Bava's biographer Tim Lucas described The Girl Who Knew Too Much as being tongue-in-cheek tribute to the giallo stories and their readership and \\"Telephone\\" felt was actually in the giallo style but in short form. Curti found that Blood and Black Lace was predominantly a series of elaborate violent and erotically themed set pieces that were \\"increasingly elaborate and spectacular\\" in their construction and that Bava pushed these elements to its extreme. Curti noted the film was promoted as a whodunnit in Italy but was different from both that genre and krimis of the period. Specifically, the film had a lack of humor, a British setting, and no string of clues or hints to who the murderer is. ProductionDevelopment= Prior to directing Blood and Black Lace, Mario Bava directed a few films that were aimed at foreign markets, including Black Sunday and Black Sabbath, Erik the Conqueror, and The Girl Who Knew Too Much. These films were partially produced by the Italian production company Galatea, who had suspend their production and distribution by 1964, leaving Bava to then have the rest of his career move from producer to producer, with left Bava \\"not always happy with the results\\" according to Curti. Bava began work on Blood and Black Lace under the working title of L'atelier della morte () for Emmepi Cinematografica, a small company founded on November 27, 1962 which had only produced four films at the time, and had minor contributions to Black Sabbath. According to ministerial papers, Bava signed the contract to work on the film on March 16, 1963. The film had a smaller budget than Bava's previous horror films, with an estimated figure of 180 million Italian lire, while the effective one was 141,755,000. In comparison, Black Sabbath had a budget of 205 million Italian lire. It was the only film where it was a majority investor, as the film was a co-production with France and West Germany, with the respective quotas being 50% (Italy), 20% (France), and 30% (West Germany). The French partner was Georges de Beauregard, who would work with productions varying from Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless and Le petit soldat to genre film co-productions like Goliath and the Rebel Slave and The Vampire of D√ºsseldorf. According to documents at Rome's Archive of State, De Beauregard's largest contribution to the film was future film director Bertrand Tavernier as an assistant director. Tavernier dismissed this, saying that \\"These Italian credits are based on scams. French names were needed for the co-production. I have never been to Italy and haven't met anyone involved in these films.\\" Tavernier concluded that his contributions to the film were that he \\"read a scenario of Mario Bava's Blood and Black Lace and my name is in the credits.\\" The West German production was Top Film under the name Monarchia Film, a group based in Munich which only financed two other films. The synopsis of Blood and Black Lace at the Archive of State in Italy and the script at Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia are credited to Marcello Fondato and Giuseppe Barill√†. Fondato has previously worked on a number of comedies prior to Blood and Black Lace and had previously worked on the script for Black Sabbath. Barill√† was a co-editor of the literary magazine Elsinore, with Curti suggesting Barill√† only had minor contributions to the script. The estimated budget attached to bureaucratic papers submitted to the Ministry at the beginning of production list Fondato and Bava as the authors of the story and credits the script to the name Giuseppe Milizia who does not appear in any other documents. In contrast, the opening titles of the film credit Fondato as the author of the story and screenplay, with Barill√†'s name listed as \\"with the collaboration of\\". Ministerial papers state that Bava was paid 3 million Italian lire as co-scenarist, and 7 million for directing, while Fondato and Barill√† were each paid about 1.5 million each for screenwriting. Lucas stated that the film Mannek√§ng i r√∂tt from 1958 may have also influenced the film which featured color cinematography similar to that of Bava's with diffused lighting filters as well as the film's plot being set in a fashion salon where murders are taking place. Lucas has stated he believed that Bava may have viewed the film and was influenced by it for Blood and Black Lace while Curti responded that the film was never released in Italy and it was unlikely that Bava or the screenwriters had seen the film. =Pre-production= Blood and Black Lace contained an international cast. It included Italians Arianna Gorini and Francesca Ungaro, American actress Mary Arden, French actor Claude Dantes, and Germans Thomas Reiner and Lea Lander. Lander moved to Italy to work on the film. She spoke positively on working with Bava, but was particularly excited to be working with Eva Bartok. Bartok at the time was known for her work in the American film The Crimson Pirate directed by Robert Siodmak. Lander recalled that Bartok kept her distance from the rest of the cast, had her own make-up room and had the cast and crew often having to wait for her on set. The cast also included some character actors, many of which who had worked with Bava previously such as Massimo Reghi who was in Black Sabbath, Dante DiPaolo who played a reporter in The Girl Who Knew Too Much, and Luciano Pigozzi who was in The Whip and the Body. Reiner and Dantes were last minute replacements in the cast, as they took over roles initially intended for Gustavo de Nardo and Yoko Tani respectively. Cameron Mitchell, a regular actor for Bava, had remained in touch with Bava since their last project. Mitchell stated \\"There was a special chemistry between us, Bava was one of my favorite people on the planet.\\" Mitchell stated that Bava's mood on set was genial, which he didn't bring up with him. Mitchell explained \\"in this business, frankly, everybody breaks down. I think it was fairly serious with Mario, however.\\" Actress Harriet White Medin who played did not remember anything bout the production, but confessed to Lucas that she thought the film was \\"absolutely horrible\\" and that \\"When you get to be my age [...] violence on the screen loses whatever entertainment value it may have had when you were younger and thought of yourself as immortal and indestructible.\\" The rest crew consisted of many other of Bava's regular collaborators, including director of photography Ubaldo Terzano, film editor Mario Serandrei and costume designer Tina Loriedo Grani. =Production= The exteriors of the films Fashion house were shot at Rome at Villa Sciarra (Rome). Lucas stated that filming began in November 1963, while Curti found that the shooting schedule for the film started on September 26, 1963. Mary Arden who performed the role Peggy, recollected on the specifics of shooting, stating she finished her scenes shortly around the time of the Assassination of John F. Kennedy. While Lucas stated that filming ended into mid-January 1964, the documents found by Curti declared that the film was finished on October 26, 1963. The film was shot in Rome, with the exteriors of the fashion house filmed at Villa Sciarra, interiors shot at Palazzo Brancaccio, and other scenes shot at A.T.C. Studios. Other scenes such as the antique shop in the film were shot at the storage facility for film props. Though the film was predominantly a European production, it was filmed with the majority of the cast speaking their lines in English. Arden spoke on the script saying the \\"Italian guy who wrote the script had no great knowledge of American or English conversation, so the script was full of mistakes.\\" Arden was fluent in three languages and offered to rewrite the dialogue for Bava during filming so it would make more sense. For the violent scenes in Blood and Black Lace, Arden remembered performing the majority of her own stunts in the film. These included scenes where she was to fall under a mattress that would be placed under her at the last second. The team would often miss their timing, leading to Arden getting bruises on the subsequent re-takes. The films stunt coordinator Freddy Unger explained that Bava had to deal with actors wanting to do their own stunts. When actors often requested to fight scenes, he then filmed them only briefly and then telling the actors they had all the footage they needed. Mitchell also recollected some of Bava's methods, recalled that the tracking shots in the film were done by Bava mounting the camera on a children's wagon while crane shots were made by using a makeshift see-saw that counterbalanced the camera with crew members. Curti countered the idea of the wagon, as Lamberto Bava stated on an Italian DVD audio commentary that the cameras used on set were Mitchell Cameras opposed to the lighter Arriflex cameras. For make-up on the film, Arden's burned features took four hours to apply from makeup artist Emilio Trani for the five days she was on set as a corpse. To avoid having it added and removed each day, Arden took to having the make-up remain on her face for the later days of shooting. During post-production on the film, the title changed from L'atelier della morte to Se donne per l'assassino during post-production.  Release Blood and Black Lace had its premiere in Rome on March 14, 1964 as 6 donne per l'assassino. Both the onscreen title and Ministerial papers list the film as 6 donne per l'assassino, while some promotional material for the film Sei donne per l'assassino, a title which has since been used in reviews, essays and reference books. The film was distributed by Unidis in Italy where Curti described it as not being a commercial success. It grossed a little more than 137 million Italian lire, an amount Curti described as not enough to spark any trend in Italian cinema, but enough for Emmepi to recoup its investment in the film. The film placed as the 161st on the highest grossing domestic releases in Italy that year. The film was distributed by Gloria Film in West Germany as Blutige Seide () on November 27, 1964 and in France by Les Films Marbeuf as 6 femmes pour l'assassin on December 30, 1964. It was distributed in the United States by the Woolner Brothers where it was given the title Blood and Black Lace. A new title sequence was devised for the film and two very minor edits of dialogue mostly left the film intact. Initially, an English-language audio track was made in Rome under the supervision of actor and director Mel Welles but was not used as the Woolner brothers had a new soundtrack recorded in Los Angeles under the supervision of Lou Moss with many of the cast members being dubbed by voice artist Paul Frees. =Home media= Blood and Black Lace has been released on home video in several countries on VHS including Italy, France, Germany, Japan, and Spain. According to Lucas, all known VHS releases of the film were not the full-length feature. Early American releases of include a VHS and Betamax from Media Home Entertainment and a laser disc from The Roan Group. It was released in the United Kingdom by Iver Film and Nouveaux Pictures. It was released by VCI Video twice: first in 2000 and a second time in 2005 with more bonus features. Arrow Video released the Blu-ray Disc on 21 April 2015 in the United States and 13 April in the United Kingdom. The music of the film was composed by Carlo Rustichelli. Rustichelli recalled his own reaction to the film as \\"There was no doubt, it was something new. I was somewhat shocked by it, partly by its erotic quality.\\" The films main theme by Rustichelli is titled \\"Atelier\\" and is reprised throughout the film in various forms. As the characters deaths rise through the film, the orchestration of the score scales down. As a request from Bava, Rustichelli re-used some of the cues he had written and recorded for The Whip and the Body. Another piece of music by Rustichelli re-used is from the film La bellezza d'Ippolita, which can be heard during the fashion show sequence in Blood and Black Lace. The films score was released on compact disc by Digitmovies where it was paired with the music from The Whip and the Body.  Critical reception Contemporary= Curti described the film as \\"barely reviewed in newspapers\\" with the few critics acknowledging it for its stylistic qualities. Reviews in Europe from La Stampa noted the film was \\"finely photographed\\" and that it \\"dispenses thrills and emotions more by way of the director's excellent technique than with the shaky gimmicks of a clumsy script\\" while Corriere d'Informazione found the film to be \\"technically remarkable, but as a spectacle it is asthmatic.\\" Ugo Casirhagi of L'Unit√† found that Bava was \\"a fellow who has lots of fun playing with macabre elements ornaments, intermittent lighting, and changing colors\\" as well as \\"putting the characters to death (and with even more relish when they are elegant and sophisticated ladies) in the most hideous ways. We can not deny that, as a butcher, he has a pulse.\\" An anonymous reviewer of Cahiers du Cin√©ma dismissed the film as a \\"riot of hideous lighting and effects as heavy as the Ritz: all of it in a jumble of objects as Ophuls, Sternberg or even Albicocco never dared to offer.\\" Outside of Europe, A. H. Weiler of The New York Times found that the film was a \\"super-gory whodunit\\" where characters \\"are dispatched in varying horrendous styles, leaving nary a lissome lovely around to model those fancy gowns. It's a waste, as we were saying, but considering the obvious, ponderous plot and their acting, they deserve their bloody fate or the semi-blackout which greeted them. \\" \\"Whit.\\" of Variety summarized the film as an \\"okay mystery with a few chills here and there\\", while noting the visuals, stating the \\"backgrounded by expensive sets which add a certain quality not always distinguishable in films of this sort.\\" declaring that the art direction \\"is tops\\" with colour photography to take advantage of it. The review commented on Bava's direction as setting \\"a grim mood never relinquished and music score by [Rustichelli] maintains this atmosphere.\\" The critic credited as \\"P.J.D.\\" in the Monthly Film Bulletin declared it as Bava's \\"most expensive-looking and decorative horror film to date\\" concluding that \\"if this is a very good (i.e. characteristic) example of Bava's work, it is a less good example of the murder thriller genre, being derivative, for the most part poorly acted and written, and risible in its several descents into bathos.\\" =Retrospective= From retrospective reviews, critics from the BBC, AllMovie and Slant Magazine often praised the film for its visual inventiveness, while noting the films violence. Almar Haflidason, reviewing the film for BBC Online, said that \\"Through a prowling camera style and shadow-strewn baroque sets that are illuminated only by single brilliant colours, [Bava] creates a claustrophobic paranoia that seeps into the fabric of the movie and the viewer.\\" Chuck Bowen of Slant Magazine praised the visuals and plot noting that the film \\"floods the eye with stimulation, overwhelming our senses so much that the subtle and ingenious plot rushes by in a blur\\" while \\"The killings in Blood and Black Lace are still disturbing, yet have the vitality of pop art.\\" Patrick Legar of AllMovie praised Bava's \\"visual eye and use of color, which give the film a highly unique style and look. The brilliant use of primary hues serve as visual foreshadowing throughout the picture and make repeated viewings a fascinating necessity.\\" while noting the \\"the striking brutality of their murders. The killings are highly disturbing in their savagery -- strangling, gouging, drowning, and a torturous scalding among them\\" In the book The Definitive Guide to Horror Movies, James Marriott described the film as \\"fascinating and flamboyantly stylish\\" as well as find the scenes of eroticized violence to be disturbing. Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide gave the film one and a half out of a possible four stars, criticizing the film's \\"wooden script and performances\\" but complimented Bava's direction, calling it \\"imaginative.\\" Years after its release, the film has been included on several publications \\"Best-Ofs\\" lists relating to horror, thriller and slasher themes from Paste Magazine, Esquire, and Slant Magazine. Legacy The scene involving the murder in the bath tub has been referenced by several filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese, Pedro Almod√≥var and Dario Argento. On its initial release, Curti opined that the film didn't have the commercial success to initially give birth to wave of similar stories. While some critics such as Lucas have suggested that Bava's use of colour influenced new krimi films produced in West Germany to be shot in color such as Alfred Vohrer's Der Bucklige von Soho, there is no documentation that the switch was caused by the success of Blood and Black Lace. Italian thrillers following Blood and Black Lace were described as either variations on the themes found in Alfred Hitchcock films such as Il segreto del vestito rosso by Silvio Amadio, or murder mystery films such as Crimine a due by Romano Ferrara. Among the few works immediately influenced by the film was the fumetto nero Kriminal in issue number 5 which used the same plot as Blood and Black Lace. Films labeled as gialli from Italy that were released in the late 1960s such as Umberto Lenzi's work with Carroll Baker (Orgasmo, So Sweet... So Perverse, A Quiet Place to Kill) and Lucio Fulci's One on Top of the Other focused on eroticism rather than Bava's style. It was not until the success of Dario Argento's film The Bird with the Crystal Plumage that the giallo genre started as a major trend in Italian cinema. Argento's film borrows elements from Blood and Black Lace such as the focus on the murder scenes. Giallo films released after Argento's film showed a stronger influence from Blood and Black Lace such as Roberto Bianchi Montero's So Sweet, So Dead, Stelvio Massi's Five Women for the Killer, and Renato Polselli's Delirio caldo. The scene involving the murder of Tao-Li in a bathtub from the film was later referenced or used in other features. This include the opening scene of Pedro Almod√≥var's Matador, where Eusebio Poncela's is seen masturbating to this scene. It has been imitated in several films, including J. Lee Thompson's Happy Birthday to Me, Argento's Two Evil Eyes, and Martin Scorsese's Kundun.

It is often used in gardens as a hedge or screen. The tree was introduced to Bermuda for ornamental purposes but is now out of control and listed as an invasive species. The tree has also been introduced to Florida. Description left Eugenia uniflora is a large shrub or small tree with a conical form, growing slowly to high. When bruised, crushed or cut, the leaves and branches have a spicy resinous fragrance, which can cause respiratory discomfort in susceptible individuals. The leaves are without stipules, ovate, glossy and held in opposite pairs. New leaves are bronze, copper or coppery-pinkish in color, maturing to a deep glossy green, up to long. During winter the leaves turn red. Flowers have four white petals and are borne on slender long stalks, with a conspicuous central cluster of white stamens ending in yellow anthers. Flowers develop into ribbed fruits long, starting out as green, then ranging through orange, scarlet and maroon as they ripen. Because the seeds are distributed by fruit-eating birds it can become a weed in suitable tropical and sub-tropical habitats, displacing native flora. UsesFruit= The edible fruit is a botanical berry. The taste ranges from sweet to sour, depending on the cultivar and level of ripeness (the darker red to black range is quite sweet, while the green to orange range is strikingly tart). Its predominant food use is as a flavoring and base for jams and jellies. The fruit is high in vitamin C and a source of provitamin A. =Leaves= The leaves are spread on some house floors in Brazil, so that when crushed underfoot, they exude a smell which repels flies. The leaves are also used for tea in certain parts of Uruguay. Medical studies Eugenia uniflora has several significant pharmacological properties. Its essential oil is antihypertensive, antidiabetic, antitumor and analgesic, and it has shown antiviral and antifungal activity. It has performed against microorganisms such as Trichomonas gallinae (in vitro), Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania amazonensis. It also shows significant anti-inflammatory properties, and is used extensively as a folk remedy in South America against stomach diseases.

It was founded in 1959 as the successor to the \\"Banque d‚Äô√âtat du Maroc\\" (est. 1906). In 2008 Bank Al-Maghrib held reserves of foreign currency with an estimated worth of US$36 billion. In addition to currency management, the Bank Al- Maghrib also supervises a number of private banks supplying commercial banking services. The bank has a branch in Casablanca, and agencies in 18 other cities in Morocco. The current governor is Abdellatif Jovahri.

The participants at the conference also sought to reform the Kingdom of Morocco's administration and finances, and to ensure free trade. On 7 April 1906, the representatives of 12 European countries joined Morocco and the United States of America in signing an agreement to establish the \\"Banque d‚Äô√âtat du Maroc\\". The bank began operations in Tangier in February 1907 and had as its shareholders the signatories of the agreement, except for the United States. The Banque d‚Äô√âtat du Maroc had some of the functions of a central bank and in 1911 it started to mint silver coins (\\"Hassani\\"-type), and to issue banknotes. It had the right, for a 40-year term, to issue banknotes backed by gold. It had a strict cap on the spending of the Sherifian Empire, and the national banks of the German Empire, United Kingdom, France, and Spain, which guaranteed the bank's loans, appointed administrators. Spanish coinage continued to circulate. France subsequently bought out the shares of some of the founding owners to acquire majority control. By 1919 it became impossible to maintain a fixed parity between the Hassani and the French currency, both of which were circulating in Morocco, and in October the Banque gave up the fixed exchange rate. In March 1920, the Banque demonetized the Hassani currency. Instead, it issued notes and coins denominated in the Moroccan franc. An operations account ensured that from December 1921 the Moroccan and French francs would trade at parity. In 1946 the Banque received an extension for 20 years of its right to issue money. However, in 1958, the Moroccan government commenced negotiations with France and the Banque to reclaim for itself the right to issue money. Decree n¬∞ 1.59.233 of 30 June 1959 created the Banque du Maroc, which took over the issuance of money the next day, and replaced the Banque d'Etat du Maroc. In October, the Banque du Maroc issued a new currency, the dirham. The Banking Act of 21 April 1967 enhanced the role of \\"Banque du Maroc\\", particularly in the field of banking supervision. In 1974, the Banque du Maroc commenced issuing the centime as a fraction of the dirham, replacing the franc. In March 1987, the bank adopted the name Bank Al- Maghrib. That same month, the bank established Dar As-Sikkah, the unit that would be responsible for printing bank notes and minting coins. A new banking act in July 1993 created a unified regulatory framework for all credit institutions. This act strengthened the Bank Al-Maghrib in its role of regulating and supervising credit institutions in Morocco. October saw the passage of amendments to the Bank's statutes that clarified its role in monetary policy, and that granted it greater autonomy. In 2006, Law No.76-03, promulgated by Dahir No. 1-05-38 of 20th Chaoual 1426 (23 November 2005) repealed Dahir No. 1-59-233 of 23rd Hija 1378 (30 June 1959), which had created Bank Al-Maghrib. The new law reinforced Bank Al-Maghrib's independence in terms of monetary policy, and provided a legal basis for its responsibility for the payment system. The new law established the bank as a public legal entity, controlled by the account commissioner, the government commissioner, and the Court of Account. Law No.34-03 expanded the jurisdiction of the banking law over certain institutions engaged in banking activities, redefined the roles of the National Council of Credit and the Committee of Credit Establishments, reinforced Bank Al-Maghrib's autonomy in banking supervision, and instituted a number of other measures covering the protection of clients of credit institutions and the treatment of credit institutions in distress.

After bypassing the downtown area, NH 125 crosses over NH 121A, then turns northeast and transitions into an undivided two-lane rural highway before crossing into the town of Kingston. In Kingston, NH 125 is first joined by NH 111 which approaches from the west, then later by NH 107 which approaches from the east. Bypassing east of downtown Kingston, the three routes are overlapped for just over before NH 111 turns east towards Exeter. NH 107 and NH 125 continue northwest for another , then NH 107 turns off towards Fremont while NH 125 continues north and crosses into the town of Brentwood. The highway has one major junction in Brentwood with NH 111A (the main road in town) and continues north towards Epping. = Epping, Lee, Barrington (Calef Highway) = Upon crossing into Epping, NH 125 becomes known as the Calef Highway and expands to four lanes before interchanging with the NH 101 freeway at exit 7. The highway turns northeast to bypass downtown and crosses NH 27 and the Lamprey River, narrowing back to two lanes thereafter. NH 125 meets the western terminus of NH 87 and the southern terminus of NH 155 before turning due north and entering Lee. NH 125 crosses NH 152 and turns slightly east, bypassing downtown Lee (which is directly served by NH 155) to the west. Continuing north, NH 125 then intersects with U.S. Route 4 at the Lee Traffic Circle, a major two-lane roundabout. NH 125 enters Barrington and stays along the town's east side, crossing the Bellamy River and then NH 9 further north. The highway continues north and enters the Rochester city limits. = Rochester = The Calef Highway moniker ends as NH 125 enters Rochester, and the road becomes known as Gonic Road (after the neighborhood of Gonic which NH 125 passes through). The highway crosses the Isinglass River and passes alongside the Rochester County Club as it continues north towards downtown Rochester. After passing through Gonic, NH 125 has a major interchange with the Spaulding Turnpike (NH 16) at exit 12, and the road becomes Columbus Avenue as it transitions into an urban route. The highway crosses the Cocheco River and crosses South Main Street (which carries NH 108 and NH 202A, both of which terminate here) just south of downtown. While NH 202A heads straight into the heart of town, NH 125 follows Columbus Avenue in a partial loop around the east side of downtown. On the north side of downtown, Columbus Avenue ends and NH 125 turns north onto Wakefield Street, which becomes Milton Road. NH 125 has an interchange with US 202 and NH 11, which provide access to the nearby Spaulding Turnpike at exit 16, as well as to points east in Maine. As NH 125 continues north, it begins to parallel the Salmon Falls River (which forms the border between New Hampshire and Maine) to the west, and the Spaulding Turnpike to the east. The highway transitions back into a rural route as it enters the town of Milton. = Milton, Wakefield = Upon crossing into Milton, NH 125 becomes known as the White Mountain Highway, in recognition of its former status as the major route north to the White Mountains Region (it carries the original alignment of NH 16 before the Spaulding Turnpike was built). The highway meets the eastern terminus of NH 75, which connects to the nearby turnpike at exit 17, before passing through downtown Milton, continuing to run along the western side of the Salmon Falls River. After leaving the downtown area, NH 125 turns slightly westward away from the river and continues winding north, running nearly adjacent to the turnpike. As it approaches the Branch River, a tributary of the Salmon Falls, NH 125 turns west and interchanges with the Spaulding Turnpike again at exit 18. This interchange marks the northern terminus of the Spaulding Turnpike, and the White Mountain Highway designation continues northward on NH 16. NH 125 crosses into Wakefield and passes through the village of Union as Main Street, then intersects with NH 153. NH 125 is overlapped with NH 153 on Main Street for (although this is only signed in the southbound direction) as the road bends around to the east to meet NH 16, where the NH 125 designation officially ends. The roadway continues north as NH 153 (Wakefield Road).

He was born to Henry Charles Gage and Leila Georgina Peel. His Gage family ancestry included extensive roots in British North America from the Schuyler family, the Delancey family, and the Van Cortlandt family. Upon the death of his father in 1912, he succeeded him as Viscount Gage when he was only 16. Gage served in World War I as a Captain of the Coldstream Guards, seeing action in both France and Belgium. He was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 58th (Home Counties) Field Brigade, Royal Artillery, on 17 June 1936.Army List. In 1931, Gage donated papers and letters written between 1758 and 1764 by his famous relative General Sir Thomas Gage to the William L. Clements Library of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Gage later (between 1958 and 1965) donated letters and documents from ancestral in-law Vice-Admiral Sir Peter Warren to the Sussex Archaeological Society in Lewes. At the beginning of World War II the family moved to a smaller house and nearby Southover girls' school in Lewes was evacuated for a short time to Gage's family home in Firle. After they had moved, Canadian soldiers were quartered at the family manor. In 1952, Gage's mother-in-law died, leaving art work to his wife, Imogen. The couple decided to showcase the art in their home, opening Firle Place to public tours in 1954. In 1968, Imogen died. Gage was remarried in 1971 to Diana Cavendish. He died himself in 1982 at the age of 86. A stained glass window by the artist John Piper was installed in St Peter's Church, Firle, and dedicated to his memory. He was appointed Deputy President of Sussex Wildlife Trust on 13 January 1962 and retired at the AGM on 29 April 1967.

He is the creator of titles such as Wicked City, Ninja Scroll, and Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust. Biography Kawajiri was born on November 18, 1950 and grew up in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. After he graduated from high school in 1968, he worked as an animator at Mushi Production Animation until it closed in 1972. He then joined Madhouse as one of the four co-founders, and in the 1970s was promoted to animation director. He finally debuted as a film director with 1984's Lensman: Secret of The Lens, directing jointly with the more experienced Kazuyuki Hirokawa (Kawajiri also did the character design along with Kazuo Tomizawa). Gaining an interest in darker animation, he next directed The Running Man. Afterwards, he was instructed to make a 35-minute short based on Hideyuki Kikuchi's novels, which was released as Wicked City. After completing it, however, his producers were so impressed that he was asked to make it a feature-length film. Kawajiri enjoyed the dark tone, and agreed to manage and complete the film within a year. That same year he began to work for the Original Video Animation market debuting with \\"The Phoenix\\". From 1987 he also wrote his own scripts. Wicked City received critical and commercial success when released in 1987, giving Kawajiri more creative freedom. He began scripting and designing his own film set in feudal Japan. The result, Ninja Scroll, about the Japanese folk hero Jubei Yagyu, was soon released. After the Western release in 1996, Kawajiri's status as a director received international recognition. He was asked in 2002 to direct a segment, titled Program, of The Animatrix, considered a showcase of the best directors of Japanese animation. Before The Animatrix, he also directed Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, which was based on a novel by Hideyuki Kikuchi. Kawajiri directed Highlander: The Search for Vengeance. It was released on DVD on 5 June 2007. According to an interview with Ain't It Cool News with producer Galen Walker, Kawajiri disliked the fact that 7‚Äì8 minutes of added scenes with no opening exposition text sequence were removed when the film was released, but the director's cut will include the footage.http://www.aintitcool.com/node/32882 Kawajiri has script approval for a sequel to Ninja Scroll, which was listed as being in pre-production with no specific release date as of 2010.

Due to the marketing success of Windows XP, over the next decade it was claimed to be the most viewed photograph in the world during that time.  History  alt=A man with white hair and glasses wearing a brown button-down shirt, smiling at the camera. In January 1996, former National Geographic photographer Charles O'Rear was on his way from his home in St. Helena, California, in the Napa Valley north of San Francisco, to visit his girlfriend, Daphne Irwin (whom he later married), in the city, as he did every Friday afternoon. He was working with Irwin on a book about the wine country. He was particularly alert for a photo opportunity that day, since a storm had just passed over and other recent winter rains had left the area especially green. Driving along the Sonoma Highway (California State Route 12 and 121) he saw the hill, free of the vineyards that normally covered the area; they had been pulled out a few years earlier following a phylloxera infestation. \\"There it was! My God, the grass is perfect! It's green! The sun is out; there's some clouds,\\" he remembered thinking. He stopped somewhere near the Napa‚ÄìSonoma county line and pulled off the road to set his Mamiya RZ67 medium-format camera on a tripod, choosing Fujifilm's Velvia, a film often used among nature photographers and known to saturate some colors.Story, at 2:30. O'Rear credits that combination of camera and film for the success of the image. \\"It made the difference and, I think, helped the 'Bliss' photograph stand out even more,\\" he said. \\"I think that if I had shot it with 35 mm, it would not have nearly the same effect.\\"Story, at 2:50. While he was setting up his camera, he said it was possible that the clouds in the picture came in. \\"Everything was changing so quickly at that time.\\" He took four shots and got back into his truck. According to O'Rear, the image was not digitally enhanced or manipulated in any way. Since it was not pertinent to the wine-country book, O'Rear made it available through Westlight (transferred to Corbis after its acquisition) as a stock photo, available for use by any interested party willing to pay an appropriate licensing fee. He also submitted a vertical shot, which was available at the same time. In 2000, Microsoft's Windows XP development team contacted O'Rear through Corbis, which he believes they used instead of larger competitor Getty Images, also based in Seattle, because the former company is owned by Microsoft founder Bill Gates. \\"I have no idea what [they] were looking for,\\" he recalls. \\"Were they looking for an image that was peaceful? Were they looking for an image that had no tension?\\"Story, at 3:20. Another image of O'Rear's titled Full Moon over Red Dunes, known as Red moon desert in Windows XP, was also considered as the default wallpaper, but was changed due to testers comparing it to buttocks. Microsoft said they wanted not just to license the image for use as XP's default wallpaper, but to buy all the rights to it. They offered O'Rear what he says is the second-largest payment ever made to a photographer for a single image; however, he signed a confidentiality agreement and cannot disclose the exact amount. It has been reported to be \\"in the low six figures.\\" O'Rear needed to send Microsoft the original film and sign the paperwork; however, when couriers and delivery services became aware of the value of the shipment, they declined since it was higher than their insurance would cover. So the software company bought him a plane ticket to Seattle and he personally delivered it to their offices.\\" \\"I had no idea where it was going to go,\\" he said. \\"I don't think the engineers or anybody at Microsoft had any idea it would have the success it's had.\\"Story, at 4:45. Microsoft gave the photo its current name, and made it a key part of its marketing campaign for XP. Although it's often said that it was cropped slightly to the left and the greens were made slightly stronger, the version Microsoft bought from Corbis had been cropped like this to begin with, while the saturation is a result of the Velvia film. The photographer estimates that the image has been seen on a billion computers worldwide, based on the number of copies of XP sold since then. = Attempts to recreate = Recreation by Goldin+Senneby of approximately the same location in November 2006, showing vines covering the area. Image of the hill in July 2017. In November 2006, Goldin+Senneby visited the site in Sonoma Valley where the Bliss image was taken, re-photographing the same view now full of grapevines (pictured). Their work After Microsoft was first shown in the exhibition \\"Paris was Yesterday\\" at the gallery La Vitrine in April 2007. It was later exhibited at 300m¬≥ in Gothenburg.  Reception  O'Rear concedes that despite all the other photographs he took for National Geographic, he will probably be remembered most for Bliss. \\"Anybody now from age 15 on for the rest of their life will remember this photograph,\\" he said in 2014.Story, 5:30. Since the origins of the image were not widely known for several years after XP's release, there had been considerable speculation about where the landscape was. Some guesses have included locations in France, England, Switzerland, the North Otago region of New Zealand, and southeastern Washington. Dutch users believed the photograph was shot in Ireland's County Kerry since the image was named \\"Ireland\\" in the Dutch release of the software; similarly, the image was named \\"Alentejo\\" in the Portuguese version, leading users speaking that language to believe it had been taken in the eponymous region of Portugal. Other users have speculated that the image was not of a real location, that the sky came from a separate image and was spliced together with the hill. O'Rear is adamant that, other than Microsoft's minor alterations to the digitized version, he did nothing to it in a darkroom, contrasting it with Adams' Monolith: In December 2001, Microsoft released a screensaver under the name of Bliss, with the scenery similar to the image, but with animating effects. In 2012, David Clark of the British magazine Amateur Photographer commented on Bliss's aesthetic qualities. \\"Critics might argue that the image is bland and lacks a point of interest, while supporters would say that its evocation of a bright, clear day in a beautiful landscape is itself the subject,\\" he wrote. He notes the \\"dreamlike quality\\" created by the filtered sunlight on the hillside as distinguishing the image. \\"What made Microsoft choose the image above all others?\\" he asked. Although the company had never told O'Rear or anyone else, Clark thought he could guess. \\"It's attractive, easy on the eye and doesn't detract from other items that might be on the screen are all contributing factors. It may also have been chosen because it's an unusually inviting image of a verdant landscape and one that promotes a sense of wellbeing in desk-bound computer users.\\"  See also  * California State Route 12  References  External links  * Google Street View of the hill Category:1996 works Category:1996 in art Category:1996 in California Category:Sonoma County, California Category:Color photographs Category:Photographs of the United States Category:Landscape photographs Category:Windows XP Category:1990s photographs Category:Stock photography ","title":"Bliss (image)"},{"id":"2011008","text":"Shadow Project was an Alternative rock/goth metal band formed in 1987 featuring former members of Los Angeles deathrock groups Christian Death and Super Heroines. After recording two LP records the group experienced a three- year hiatus, reconvening for a third and final album. Shadow Project definitively folded after vocalist Rozz Williams committed suicide on April 1, 1998. The band briefly returned in 2019 under the moniker \\"Shadow Project 1334\\" for 13 shows only, vowing to never perform again together after that. HistoryFormation= The band was named after a study of the effects of nuclear bombs in Hiroshima. Centered around Rozz Williams and Eva O, Shadow Project gave its first performance in San Francisco in 1987, but did not maintain much of a profile until Williams and Eva O returned to Los Angeles in 1990. Once there, they recruited keyboardist Paris Sadonis, Super Heroines bassist Jill Emery, and drummer Tom Morgan, formerly from Los Angeles punk band the Flesh Eaters. After touring the city's club circuit - including the legendary Whisky A Go Go - they signed with Triple X Records, responsible for launching Jane's Addiction's successful career. =Triple X Years= The early, scrawled form of Shadow Project's logotype. The band's self-titled first album was released in 1991. AllMusic described Shadow Project's debut as a unique and adventurous \\"blend of goth, punk and glam\\", a challenging record that would ultimately prove satisfying after several spins. With Peter Tomlinson replacing Morgan, the group completed a follow-up, Dreams for the Dying, recorded during the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Jill Emery left to concentrate on her Hole duties. The following year Shadow Project participated on Triple X's Alice Cooper tribute Welcome to Our Nightmare with a \\"Dead Babies/Killer\\" medley. The band personnel for this recording featured yet another line-up change, with Aaron Schwartz now on bass and Chuck Collison handling the track's samples. Shadow Project then toured the United States in the summer, and after that had plans to tour Europe in the Fall, namely France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and the United Kingdom. During their 1993 tour in support for Dreams for the Dying's release, Shadow Project recorded a concert held in Fullerton, California on June 20, later to be released as the In Tuned Out live album. Alongside tracks culled from their two studio albums, the record features an Alice Cooper medley, a David Bowie cover (\\"Panic in Detroit\\") and two unreleased songs. A Christian Death original, \\"Still Born/Still Life\\" \\\\- dedicated to serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer \\\\- was also included in the set. =Split= After the American tour, Eva O and Paris left the band to focus on Eva O Halo Experience CD Demons Fall for an Angel's Kiss. This effectively ended Shadow Project. For his part, Williams declared that Shadow Project went as far it could. \\"Eva wanted to go in one direction and I in another\\", he justified; he then went on to pursue his own musical interests. The German leg of their European tour had already been booked by then, so Rozz Williams went to tour with another band in place, Daucus Karota. =Final Days= After Shadow Project split, Rozz Williams and Eva O. divorced (but remained friendly) and Williams' heroin addiction increased. In 1997 they would once again reunite to record the final Shadow Project release, From the Heart. The album included band material from previous records stripped down to just acoustic guitar and vocal duets. Nathan Van Hala of christian metal group Saviour Machine was drafted to fill in the keyboard duties. But before From Heart came out Shadow Project's career was again cut short, this time by Rozz Williams' suicide. The singer hanged himself on April Fool's Day, leaving no suicide note. His former Christian Death bandmate, Valor Kand, said that beside suffering from bipolar disorder, Williams battled alcohol and heroin abuse all his life. Style and Influences In Terrorizer magazine's accessement, Shadow Project \\"seamlessly blended\\" all of Rozz Williams' talents: art, music and poetry. In that sense the group had a wide range of influences, raging from glam rock icons David Bowie and T. Rex, West Coast punk bands The Germs and The Alley Cats, to symbolist poet Arthur Rimbaud, \\"Theatre of Cruelty\\" creator Antonin Artaud and the cut-up technique of Beat writer William S. Burroughs. Rozz also held pioneer hard rock and heavy metal groups such as Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Kiss and Alice Cooper in great esteem. Eva O described Shadow Project's music as \\"a strange mixture of metallic death rock and punk\\". For his part, Williams stated that Shadow Project's music wasn't \\"Gothic-Rock\\"; in fact, the music of Shadow Project was \\"beyond labeling.\\" Rozz Williams felt frustrated that he couldn't quite steer from \\"goth\\" tag due to the legendary status of his former band, Christian Death. Williams didn't consider himself part of the gothic scene anymore, stating that: Themes Rozz Williams' favorite subject matter revolved around death, religion and violence. Regarding the latter, the singer was obsessed with serial killers - especially Charles Manson - and dedicated a song (\\"Still Born/Still Life\\") to Jeffrey Dahmer. He explained that, to him, \\"they've crossed a barrier that... well, obviously, you're not supposed to and you're not allowed to, supposedly. It's kind of a fascination with that\\".

It is the first work to consistently apply binomial names and was the starting point for the naming of plants. Publication ' was published on 1 May 1753 by Laurentius Salvius in Stockholm, in two volumes. A second edition was published in 1762‚Äì1763, and a third edition in 1764, although this \\"scarcely differed\\" from the second. Further editions were published after Linnaeus' death in 1778, under the direction of Karl Ludwig Willdenow, the director of the Berlin Botanical Garden; the fifth edition (1800) was published in four volumes. Importance Before ', this plant was referred to as \\"'\\"; Linnaeus renamed it Plantago media. ' was the first botanical work to consistently apply the binomial nomenclature system of naming to any large group of organisms (Linnaeus' tenth edition of ' would apply the same technique to animals for the first time in 1758). Prior to this work, a plant species would be known by a long polynomial, such as ' (meaning \\"plantain with pubescent ovate-lanceolate leaves, a cylindrical spike and a terete scape\\") or ' (meaning \\"Nepeta with flowers in a stalked, interrupted spike\\"). In ', these cumbersome names were replaced with two-part names, consisting of a single-word genus name, and a single-word specific epithet or \\"trivial name\\"; the two examples above became Plantago media and Nepeta cataria, respectively. The use of binomial names had originally been developed as a kind of shorthand in a student project about the plants eaten by cattle. After the specific epithet, Linnaeus gave a short description of each species, and a synonymy. The descriptions were careful and terse, consisting of few words in small genera; in Glycyrrhiza, for instance, the three species (Glycyrrhiza echinata, Glycyrrhiza glabra and \\"Glycyrrhiza hirsuta\\", respectively) were described as \\"'\\", \\"'\\" and \\"'\\". Because it is the first work in which binomial nomenclature was consistently applied, ' was chosen as the \\"starting point\\" for the nomenclature of most plants (the nomenclature of some non-vascular plants and all fungi uses later starting points). Contents ' contained descriptions of the thousands of plant species known to Linnaeus at the time. In the first edition, there were 5,940 names, from Acalypha australis to Zygophyllum spinosum. In his introduction, Linnaeus estimated that there were fewer than 10,000 plant species in existence; there are now thought to be around 400,000 species of flowering plants alone. The species were arranged in around a thousand genera, which were grouped into 24 classes, according to Linnaeus' sexual system of classification. There are no descriptions of the genera in '; these are supplied in the companion volume ' (\\"the genera of plants\\"), the fifth edition of which was printed at a similar time to the first edition of '. Linnaeus' sexual system is now acknowledged to be an artificial system, rather than one which accurately reflects shared ancestry, but the system's simplicity made it easier for non-specialists to rapidly find the correct class, being based on simple counts of floral parts such as stigmas and stamens.

It was originally written by Robert Corbett and released in 1989. Due to its liberal license and because it was faster than the AT&T; Yacc, it quickly became the most popular version of Yacc. It has the advantages of being written in ANSI C89 and being public domain software. It contains features not available in Yacc, such as reentrancy, which is implemented in a way that is broadly compatible with GNU Bison.Berkeley Yacc Change log, see entry \\"2010-06-07 Andres.Meji\\" History In 1985, Robert Corbett developed an original LALR parser generator based on a 1982 paper by DeRemer and Pennello. Corbett wrote it as part of his research towards the Ph.D. he received from University of California, Berkeley in June 1985. It was originally named Byson and was incompatible with Yacc but it was subsequently renamed Bison and became the basis of GNU Bison. Later in 1985, Corbett derived another Yacc-compatible LALR parser generator originally named Zeus but subsequently renamed Zoo. Corbett published the source code for Zoo in a Usenet newsgroup but it went mostly unnoticed until later in September 1989 when Corbett posted on the comp.compilers newsgroup about putting the source code on an FTP server. There was discussion about renaming it and by October 1989 it had become known as Berkeley Yacc (byacc). In 1995, Chris Dodd developed BtYacc, a backtracking derivative of Berkeley Yacc to support parsing context-sensitive languages like C++, based on a 1993 paper by Merrill describing similar modifications to AT&T; Yacc. It offers backtracking and semantic disambiguation for parsing ambiguous grammar. A rule parsed but rejected by semantic information can be rolled back, so that the parser can try another rule. However, it has also been criticized for needing side-effect free trial actions and its inflexible handling of shift-reduce conflicts. In 1997, Vadim Maslov took over maintenance of BtYacc to support a COBOL parser developed by his company. By 1999, the last 3.0 release, had been converted to C++, no longer supporting from C. In 2000, Thomas E. Dickey, ported Berkeley Yacc to VMS to facilitate porting tin to VMS. After failing to find another maintainer, Dickey has maintained Berkeley Yacc since February 2002. A significant update was the conversion from K&R; C to ANSI C89. In 2014, Tom Shields integrated BtYacc backtracking into Berkeley Yacc effectively subsuming BtYacc and again supporting C (instead of only C++) in Dickey releases since April 2014.

He was the third man of that name in several generations of an English Quaker family that played a pivotal role in the Industrial Revolution. Life Abraham Darby was born in Coalbrookdale, Shropshire, in 1750, the eldest son of Abraham Darby the Younger (1711‚Äì1763) by his second wife, Abiah Maude, and educated at a school in Worcester kept by a Quaker named James Fell.Neil Cossons, Barrie Stuart Trinder, The Iron Bridge: symbol of the Industrial Revolution (2002), p. 19 At age thirteen, Darby inherited his father's shares in the family iron-making businesses in the Severn Valley, and in 1768, aged eighteen, he took over the management of the Coalbrookdale ironworks. He took various measures to improve the conditions of his work force. In times of food shortage he brought up farms to grow food for his workers, he built housing for them, and he offered higher wages than were paid in other local industries, including coal-mining and the potteries. He built the largest cast iron structure of his era: the first cast-iron bridge ever built, as a crossing over the Severn near Coalbrookdale. The bridge made it possible for the village of Ironbridge to grow up around it, with the area being subsequently named Ironbridge Gorge. In 1776 Darby married Rebecca Smith of Doncaster, and they had seven children, of whom four survived to adulthood. He died in Madeley aged only 39 and was buried in the Quaker burial ground in Coalbrookdale. His sons Francis (1783‚Äì1850) and Richard (1788‚Äì1860) both worked in the Coalbrookdale Company.

It stars Akkineni Nagarjuna, Mohan Babu, Suman, Ramya Krishna, Bhanupriya, Roja, Kasthuri playing the lead roles and music composed by M. M. Keeravani. The film was recorded as a Blockbuster at the box office. Later in the year 2006 the movie was dubbed in Hindi by Tirupati Shree Balaji . The film portrays the life of the 15th century composer, Annamacharya. Upon release, the film received positive reviews and won eight Nandi Awards, three Filmfare Awards and two National Film Awards. The film was premiered at the 1998 International Film Festival of India in the mainstream section. Plot Vishnu listens to requests from his consort Lakshmi, that there weren't many people singing songs in praise of the Lord in Telugu. In response, the Lord sends his sword Nandaka, to be born as Annamacharya (Annamayya) to a childless couple - Narayana Suri and Lakkamba in Tallapaka village, Kadapa District. Growing as a normal young man, Annamayya is in love with his 2 cousins Timakka and Akkalamma and thinks that his cousins are the most beautiful creations of god. Lord Vishnu appears in front of Annamayya in disguise and accepts a challenge from him to show someone more beautiful than his cousins - God in the form of Lord Venkateswara in a temple in his village. Upon discovering the beauty of the Lord, Annamayya is lost in a different world and ends up making a pilgrimage to Tirumala Venkateswara Temple without planning or informing his parents. As he finds pilgrims entering the holy hills (Saptagiri- seven hills), he embarks his journey towards Him. But, he is lost and is helped by Goddess Lakshmi herself in the form of an old lady by informing him that his footwear was preventing his progress. Also weakened by fasting, Annamayya accepts Laddu - a prasadam from the food consecrated by the Lord himself. Upon reaching Tirumala, he is enthralled by the beauty of God and settles there to write and sing hymns in praise of the Lord. Meanwhile, Annamayya's parents get worried regarding Annamayya's whereabouts. Then, the Lord Venkateshwara, hearing the prayers of Lakkavaamba (Annamayya's mother), himself comes in the disguise of a Hunter along with his consorts and tells them that Annamayya lives in Tirumala. Then, Annamayya's parents, cousins, aunt, uncle and his 2 friends come to Tirumala and watch him worship the Lord. When Annamayya is asked to marry his 2 cousins, he refuses saying that his life is dedicated to the service of the Lord and marriage would become a hindrance to it. But, he is then convinced by the Lord himself who has now taken the form of a Brahmin. The Lord personally conducts the wedding of Annamayya with his cousins - Timakka and Akkalamma. After the birth of children, Annamayya settles in Tirumala leaving his children in the care of his parents. Through encounters with the local administrator (Tanikella Bharani), he comes in contact with the ruler of the country - Saluva Narasimha (Mohan Babu), who becomes a fan of his songs and make him the court poet. On hearing a Sringara Sankeertan, the King and Queen (Roja) request that Annamayya sing a sankeertan in their praise as well, something Annamayya rejects as he would sing only for the Lord and not for any human being. Jailed for not heeding the King, Annamayya invokes the Lord in the form of Lord Narasimha (human-lion) and to the surprise of the King, jailors and everyone - the iron rods burst into flames and release Annamayya. Realizing that their husband was born for humanity and Lord's service, his wives give up their lives freeing Annamayya of any earthly attachment. Annamayya, realizing the divine order, takes to writing poems and sankirtans and reaches old age. Priests and Brahmins unhappy with his social inclusion of lower caste people in the temple try to destroy his writings. When Annamayya decides to sacrifice his life because all his works were lost, a significant portion of his work is saved by Lord's grace from the fire. Saluva Narasimha and Annamayya's son's convert his work from palm to copper inscriptions thus preserving his works for eternity. On completion and dedication of the work in the temple sanctum sanctorum, the Lord and his consorts appear one last time, in their divine form. The Lord grants salvation and Annamayya's atma returns as Nandaka. Reception This movie was considered as a Box office super hit. It is one of the biggest hits in Akkineni Nagarjuna's film career. Though there have been few changes in the original life history of Shri Tallapaka Annamacharya, one could understand these changes helped the movie to become commercially a big hit.Annamayya film Review in IMDB.com CastSoundtrack Music released on T-Series Audio company.

The possible conformations are combinations of anti conformations and gauche conformations and are anti-anti, anti-gauche+, gauche+ \\\\- gauche+ and gauche+ \\\\- gauche‚àí of which the last one is especially energetically unfavorable. In macromolecules such as polyethylene pentane interference occurs between every fifth carbon atom. The 1,3-diaxial interactions of cyclohexane derivatives is a special case of this type of interaction, although there are additional gauche interactions shared between substituents and the ring in that case. A clear example of the syn-pentane interaction is apparent in the diaxial versus diequatorial heats of formation of cis 1,3-dialkyl cyclohexanes. Relative to the diequatorial conformer, the diaxial conformer is 2-3 kcal/mol higher in energy than the value that would be expected based on gauche interactions alone. Pentane interference helps explain molecular geometries in many chemical compounds, product ratios, and purported transition states. One specific type of syn-pentane interaction is known as 1,3 allylic strain or (A1,3 strain). For instance in certain aldol adducts with 2,6-disubstituted aryl groups the molecular geometry has the vicinal hydrogen atoms in an antiperiplanar configuration both in a crystal lattice (X-ray diffraction) and in solution proton (NMR coupling constants) normally reserved for the most bulky groups i.d. both arenes:Effect of 2,6-Disubstituted Aryl Groups on Acyclic Conformation: Preference for an Antiperiplanar Orientation of the Geminal and Vicinal Hydrogens Paul R.

Titles that she has written include Gotham Knights, The Titans, the Vertigo series USER, and Nightwing. Early life Devin Grayson was born in a hippie communal farmstead in New Haven, Connecticut. When her parents divorced two years later, she and her mother relocated to Berkeley, California. Deciding at a young age that she wanted to be an actress, Grayson studied the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, the Drama Studio London at Berkeley, the Julia Morgan Bay Area Youth Theater Co., Cazadero Performing Arts Camp, the Berkeley Shakespeare Festival, Jean Shelton's and School of the Arts. She subsequently changed her focus to writing, enrolled in a local community college, and then at Bard College in Upstate New York.Furey, Emmett (July 16, 2007). \\"Homosexuality in Comics - Part I\\".

Alvaro's ComicBoards.com. Quote: \\"Devin Kalile Grayson is my real and legal name. It's what's on my driver's license, passport, Social Security card, etc. I've never written under a pseudonym. I was born with a different name, but had it legally changed in my early twenties‚Äîwell before I was working in comics or even thinking about such‚Äîin response to sexual abuse issues in my childhood that made me feel like I needed to distance myself from my past a little bit psychologically.\\" At a young age, Grayson realized that she was bisexual, saying, > I was attracted to both girls and boys very early on, but, being a kid, I > had no idea that had a name. I remember being about seven and having this > crush on a girl in my summer camp, Nicole. When we went swimming, her > eyelashes would clump together in the most bewitching away‚Äîjust like a Vegas > showgirl, not that I'd ever seen one at that time‚Äîand I just thought I'd > never seen anything so beautiful.

Though most of the people in her life were accepting of her bisexuality, Grayson's father was initially troubled when he learned of it. He later explained to Grayson that he was worried about how it would make life difficult for her, though Grayson states that none of the problems she has ever faced in life stemmed from her sexuality, with the exception of her relationship with a girlfriend while in college that eventually ended because of her girlfriend's need to remain closeted. Career Grayson picked up her first comic book in her mid-twenties, after seeing an episode of Batman: The Animated Series on television. Though she was ignorant of the comics medium until then, as comics were not a part of her upbringing,Russell, Lissau (June 19, 2001). \\"Batwoman: Bisexual comics writer Devin Grayson (Batman, Ghost Rider) breaks through the comic book glass ceiling by fleshing out the human side of superheroes\\".

He raised him. And that was just an amazing, funny, scary and weird thing to think about. We've all come in late for a curfew or done something our parents didn't approve of, and you get your dad frowning over you‚Äîbut what if your dad was Batman? I just become completely obsessed with that relationship.\\" Grayson and her girlfriend at the time began watching the series \\"compulsively\\". Grayson also visited a friend who worked in a comic book store near her apartment in San Francisco and asked her friend about her namesake, Dick Grayson (aka Nightwing). Grayson left the store with a multitude of comics, including The Dark Knight Returns, Teen Titans, The Killing Joke, Watchmen, various issues of Sandman, and Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics. She then began cold- calling DC Comics and spoke to Batman editor Denny O'Neil, and sent writing samples to editor Scott Peterson. She was eventually offered a job by editor Darren Vincenzo. Grayson's first comic book script to see print was \\"Like Riding a Bike\\", a 10-page short that appeared in The Batman Chronicles in 1997.Lissau, Russell (June 21, 2002). \\"Just 'winging it: Devin Grayson on 'Nightwing'\\". Comic Book Resources. What followed was a number of writing jobs that featured members of the Batman family of characters, in particular Nightwing, in solo or group adventures, including a 1998 Nightwing/Huntress miniseries, a 20-issue run writing The Titans from issues 1‚Äì20 from 1999‚Äì2000 (including a number of issues co-written with Brian K. Vaughan and Jay Faerber), and a run on Batman: Gotham Knights, which the Chicago Daily Herald's Russell Lissau described as a \\"masterful psychological profile of the Dark Knight Detective\\" that Grayson co-created and wrote until mid-2002. In July 2002, Grayson was given the opportunity to take over the writing on the regular Nightwing solo series from Chuck Dixon, beginning with issue #71, staying on the title until 2006. Grayson stated that she is drawn to both reading and writing Nightwing because she considers him to be one of DC's more complex characters, explaining: > I think Dick Grayson has struggled with problems that are resonant to a lot > of people: loss, grief, difficult and unyielding parent figures, the need to > carve out an individual place for one's self in the world.

In 2001, Grayson wrote User, a three-issue miniseries about a woman named Meg Chancellor, who explores her gender identity by role-playing as a male knight in an online role-playing game. The book was nominated for the 2001 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comic Book. Grayson names User as her most personal work, and described the nomination as a career high, saying, \\"I have never been more proud of any achievement, or had more fun at any party. I took my mom and aunt to the ceremony with me, and we had a blast. It's just a beautiful, exciting, elegant event, and a truly right-on organization, filled with brilliant people with pro-active ideas and a great sense of humor‚Äîan all- too rare combination. I enjoyed every second of it, from flirting with the Jaguar rep to sharing a joint in the hotel kitchen with one of my favorite TV stars. Oh, and Judd Nelson talked to his dogs from his cell phone on the elevator and then started flirting with my aunt. You just don't forget a night like that!\\" In 2002, an interview with Grayson was among those published in the book Writers on Comic Scriptwriting. In 2005, she wrote a six-issue, creator-owned miniseries for DC's Wildstorm label titled Matador, illustrated by Brian Stelfreeze. In 2006, Grayson contributed an essay to the anthology She's Such a Geek, which focuses on women in traditionally male venues.Newitz, Annalee (December 15, 2006). \\"She‚Äôs Such a Geek!\\". Wired. That year saw the publication of Nightwing #117, and \\"Head Cases\\", a story in the Marvel Comics anthology Girl Comics #1. To date, these are the last original works she has done for Marvel and DC. In 2009, Grayson, an avid gamer, was hired by Perfect World Entertainment to work on Kung Foo!, a free-to-play, martial arts-themed MMORPG based on a popular Chinese TV show. Grayson was hired to take the Chinese version and write an original story that poked fun at American pop culture and MMO conventions.John, Tracey (December 9, 2009). \\"Q&A;: Comic Writer Devin Grayson on Writing for New MMO\\".

He is generally considered the greatest of the 19th-century startsy (elders). Seraphim extended the monastic teachings of contemplation, theoria and self-denial to the layperson. He taught that the purpose of the Christian life was to acquire the Holy Spirit. Perhaps his most popular quotation amongst Orthodox believers is \\"Acquire a peaceful spirit, and thousands around you will be saved.\\" Seraphim was canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1903. Alongside his veneration in the Catholic calendar, Pope John Paul II also referred to him as a Saint.Pope John Paul II, Crossing the Threshold of Hope, (Knopf, 1995), , page 18. Life Saint Seraphim feeding a bear outside of his hermitage (religious retreat) (from lithograph The Way to Sarov, 1903). Pilgrim spot Born 19 July (O.S.) 1754, the future saint was baptized with the name of Prochor, after Prochorus, one of the first Seven Deacons of the Early Church and the disciple of John the Evangelist. His parents, Isidore and Agathia Moshnin, lived in Kursk, Russia. His father was a merchant. According to Orthodox Church tradition, a wonderworking icon of the Theotokos (Virgin Mary), Our Lady of Kursk, healed the young boy. Seraphim later experienced a number of visions. In 1775, at the age of 17, he visited Dorothea of Kiev. In 1777, at the age of 19, he joined the Sarov monastery as a novice (poslushnik). He was officially tonsured (took his monastic vows) in 1786 and given the religious name of Seraphim (which means \\"fiery\\" or \\"burning\\" in Hebrew). Shortly afterwards, he was ordained a hierodeacon (monastic deacon). In 1793, he was ordained as a hieromonk (monastic priest) and became the spiritual leader of the Diveyevo Convent, which has since come to be known as the Seraphim-Diveyevo Convent. Soon after this, Seraphim retreated to a log cabin in the woods outside Sarov monastery and led a solitary lifestyle as a hermit for 25 years. During this time his feet became swollen to the point that he had trouble walking. Sarov's eating and fasting habits became more strict.Johnston, William M. (2000). Encyclopedia of Monasticism. Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers. p. 1146. At first he ate bread obtained from the monastery and vegetables from his garden, then only vegetables. For three years, he ate only grass. Nicholas Motovilov, one of Seraphim's most well-known disciples. One day, while chopping wood, Seraphim was attacked by a gang of thieves who beat him mercilessly with the handle of his own axe. He never resisted, and was left for dead. The robbers never found the money they sought, only an icon of the Theotokos (Virgin Mary) in his hut. Seraphim had a hunched back for the rest of his life. However, at the thieves' trial he pleaded to the judge for mercy on their behalf. \\"After this incident, Seraphim spent 5 months in the monastery, recovering, and there again returned to the desert, for the former spiritual feats.\\" (\\"–°–≤—è—Ç—ã–π –ø—Ä–µ–ø–æ–¥–æ–±–Ω—ã–π –°–µ—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–º –°–∞—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π —á—É–¥–æ—Ç–≤–æ—Ä–µ—Ü\\" ‚Äì —Å—Ç—Ä. 14) After this incident Seraphim spent 1,000 successive nights on a rock in continuous prayer with his arms raised to the sky, a feat of asceticism deemed miraculous by the Eastern Orthodox Church, especially considering the pain from his injuries. In 1815, in obedience to a reputed spiritual experience that he attributed to the Virgin Mary, Seraphim began admitting pilgrims to his hermitage as a confessor. He soon became immensely popular due to his reputation for healing powers and gift of prophecy. Hundreds of pilgrims per day visited him, drawn as well by his ability to answer his guests' questions before they could ask. As extraordinarily harsh as Seraphim often was to himself, he was kind and gentle toward others ‚Äî always greeting his guests with a prostration, a kiss, and exclaiming \\"Christ is risen!\\", and calling everyone \\"My joy.\\" He died while kneeling before an Umilenie icon of the Theotokos which he called \\"Joy of all Joys\\". This icon is kept currently in the chapel of the residence of the Patriarch of Moscow. Relics, canonization and veneration Hut where he lived There was a widespread popular belief in Russia that a saint's remains were supposed to be incorrupt, which was not the case with Seraphim as was officially ascertained by a commission that researched his grave in January 1903. This, however, did not deter canonisation, spearheaded by archimandrite Seraphim Chichagov as well as popular veneration.A manual for Russian clergy published in Kiev in 1913 had a special detailed explanation for this case that stressed that incorruptibility of a saint‚Ä≤s remains was not a sine qua non: ‚Ä≥–ù–µ–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ —É—Ç–≤–µ—Ä–∂–¥–∞—é—Ç, –±—É–¥—Ç–æ –º–æ—â–∏ —Å–≤—è—Ç—ã—Ö –≤—Å–µ–≥–¥–∞ –∏ –Ω–µ–ø—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ —Å—É—Ç—å —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω–Ω–æ –Ω–µ—Ç–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ, —Ç–æ –µ—Å—Ç—å —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω–Ω–æ —Ü–µ–ª—ã–µ, –Ω–∏—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –Ω–µ—Ä–∞–∑—Ä—É—à–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –∏ –Ω–µ–ø–æ–≤—Ä–µ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ —Ç–µ–ª–∞. –ù–æ –ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∞–Ω–∏–µ —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞ ‚Äû–º–æ—â–∏‚Äú –Ω–µ–ø—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ –≤ —Å–º—ã—Å–ª–µ —Ü–µ–ª–æ–≥–æ —Ç–µ–ª–∞, –∞ –Ω–µ —á–∞—Å—Ç–µ–π –µ–≥–æ –∏ –ø—Ä–µ–∏–º—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ –∫–æ—Å—Ç–µ–π, ‚Äî –Ω–µ–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª—å–Ω–æ, –∏ –≤–≤–æ–¥–∏—Ç –≤ —Ä–∞–∑–Ω–æ–≥–ª–∞—Å–∏–µ —Å –≥—Ä–µ—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π —Ü–µ—Ä–∫–æ–≤–∏—é, —Ç–∞–∫ –∫–∞–∫ —É –≥—Ä–µ–∫–æ–≤ –≤–æ–≤—Å–µ –Ω–µ –ø—Ä–æ–ø–æ–≤–µ–¥—É–µ—Ç—Å—è —É—á–µ–Ω–∏—è, —á—Ç–æ –º–æ—â–∏ –æ–∑–Ω–∞—á–∞—é—Ç —Ü–µ–ª–æ–µ —Ç–µ–ª–æ, –∏ –º–æ—â–∏ –Ω–∞–∏–±–æ–ª—å—à–µ–π —á–∞—Å—Ç–∏ —Å–≤—è—Ç—ã—Ö –≤ –ì—Ä–µ—Ü–∏–∏ –∏ –Ω–∞ –í–æ—Å—Ç–æ–∫–µ (—Ä–∞–≤–Ω–æ –∫–∞–∫ –∏ –Ω–∞ –ó–∞–ø–∞–¥–µ) —Å—É—Ç—å –∫–æ—Å—Ç–∏. –°–∞–º–æ–µ –Ω–µ—Ç–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –º–æ—â–µ–π –≤—Å–µ—Ü–µ—Ä–∫–æ–≤–Ω—ã–º —Å–æ–∑–Ω–∞–Ω–∏–µ–º –Ω–µ —Å—á–∏—Ç–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –æ–±—â–∏–º –Ω–µ–ø—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–º –ø—Ä–∏–∑–Ω–∞–∫–æ–º –¥–ª—è –ø—Ä–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è —Å–≤—è—Ç—ã—Ö —É–≥–æ–¥–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤. –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –ø—Ä–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è —Å–≤—è—Ç—ã—Ö –ø–æ–∫–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç, —á—Ç–æ –Ω–µ–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –∏–∑ —á—Ç–∏–º—ã—Ö –Ω–∞–º–∏ —Å–≤—è—Ç—ã—Ö –±—ã–ª–∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω—ã –¥–æ –æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã—Ç–∏—è –∏—Ö –º–æ—â–µ–π, –Ω–µ–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –ø—Ä–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω—ã —Å–ø—É—Å—Ç—è —Ç–æ –∏–ª–∏ –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–µ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è –∏ –¥–∞–∂–µ –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –∑–Ω–∞—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ –æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã—Ç–∏—è –∏—Ö –º–æ—â–µ–π; –º–æ—â–∏ –¥–æ–≤–æ–ª—å–Ω–æ –º–Ω–æ–≥–∏—Ö –ø—Ä–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —Å–≤—è—Ç—ã—Ö –Ω–∏–∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –Ω–µ –±—ã–ª–∏ –æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã–≤–∞–µ–º—ã. –ú–æ—â–∏ –º–Ω–æ–≥–∏—Ö —Å–≤—è—Ç—ã—Ö –∏ –≤ –Ω–∞—Å—Ç–æ—è—â–µ–µ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è –Ω–∞—Ö–æ–¥—è—Ç—Å—è –ø–æ–¥ —Å–ø—É–¥–æ–º: –≤ –±–æ–ª—å—à–µ–π —á–∞—Å—Ç–∏ —Å–ª—É—á–∞–µ–≤ —ç—Ç–æ –∑–Ω–∞—á–∏—Ç, —á—Ç–æ –º–æ—â–∏ —Å–æ–≤—Å–µ–º –Ω–µ –±—ã–ª–∏ –æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã–≤–∞–µ–º—ã, –≤ –º–µ–Ω—å—à–µ–π —á–∞—Å—Ç–∏ –∑–Ω–∞—á–∏—Ç, —á—Ç–æ –±—ã–ª–∏ –æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã–≤–∞–µ–º—ã, –Ω–æ –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º –æ–ø—è—Ç—å –∑–∞–∫—Ä—ã—Ç—ã. –ú–æ—â–∏ —Å–≤—è—Ç—ã—Ö, –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –æ–Ω–∏ –Ω–µ—Ç–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã, —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è—é—Ç —á—É–¥–æ, –Ω–æ –ª–∏—à—å –¥–æ–ø–æ–ª–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –∫ —Ç–µ–º —á—É–¥–µ—Å–∞–º, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ —Ç–≤–æ—Ä—è—Ç—Å—è —á—Ä–µ–∑ –∏—Ö –ø–æ—Å—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ. –î–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ —Å–≤—è—Ç–æ—Å—Ç–∏ —Å–≤—è—Ç—ã—Ö —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è—é—Ç —Ç–µ —á—É–¥–µ—Å–∞, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ —Ç–≤–æ—Ä—è—Ç—Å—è –ø—Ä–∏ –∏—Ö –≥—Ä–æ–±–∞—Ö, –∏–ª–∏ –æ—Ç –∏—Ö –º–æ—â–µ–π, –∞ –º–æ—â–∏, —Ü–µ–ª—ã–µ —Ç–µ–ª–∞ –∏–ª–∏ —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –∫–æ—Å—Ç–∏, —Å—É—Ç—å –¥–∞—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –Ω–∞–º, –¥–ª—è –ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–Ω–∏—è –≤ –Ω–∞—Å –∂–∏–≤–µ–π—à–µ–≥–æ –ø–∞–º—è—Ç–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –æ –Ω–µ–±–µ—Å–Ω—ã—Ö –º–æ–ª–∏—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–∞—Ö –∑–∞ –Ω–∞—Å, —Å–≤—è—â–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –∏ —Å–≤—è—Ç—ã–µ –æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∫–∏ –Ω–µ–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã—Ö —Å–≤—è—Ç—ã—Ö, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã—Ö –º—ã –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω—ã —á—Ç–∏—Ç—å, –∫–∞–∫ —Ç–∞–∫–æ–≤—ã–µ, –∏ —Å—É—Ç—å —Ç–µ –∑–µ–º–Ω—ã–µ –ø–æ—Å—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∞, —á—Ä–µ–∑ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –ì–æ—Å–ø–æ–¥—å –Ω–∞–∏–±–æ–ª–µ–µ –ø—Ä–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç –°–≤–æ—é —á—É–¥–æ–¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—É—é —Å–∏–ª—É.‚Ä≥ (–°. –í. –ë—É–ª–≥–∞–∫–æ–≤. –ù–∞—Å—Ç–æ–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∞ –¥–ª—è —Å–≤—è—â–µ–Ω–Ω–æ-—Ü–µ—Ä–∫–æ–≤–Ω–æ-—Å–ª—É–∂–∏—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π. Kiev, 1913, —Ä. 272 (footnote).) At the end of January (O.S.) 1903, the Most Holy Synod, having received approval from Emperor Nicholas II, announced Seraphim's forthcoming glorification. In early July 1903, his relics were transferred from their original burial place to the church of Saints Zosimus and Sabbatius. Nicholas II and Tsarina Alexandra provided a new cypress coffin to receive the relics. The solemn canonisation (discovery of the relics) festivities took place in Sarov on 19 July (1 August) 1903 and were attended by the Tsar, his wife, his mother Empress Maria Feodorovna, and other senior members of the Imperial Family. On 18 July 1903, Metropolitan Anthony Vadkovsky of St. Petersburg officiated at the Last Pannikhida (Memorial Service) in the Dormition Cathedral at Sarov, with the royal family in attendance. These would be the last prayers offered for Seraphim as a departed servant of God; from that time forward, prayers would instead be addressed to him as a saint. On 19 July, Seraphim's birthday, the late liturgy began at 8 o'clock. At the Little Entrance, twelve archimandrites lifted the coffin from the middle of the church and carried it around the Holy Table (altar), then placed it into a special shrine which had been constructed for them. The festivities at Sarov ended with the consecration of the first two churches dedicated to St. Seraphim. The first had been constructed over his monastic cell in the wilderness of Sarov. The second church was consecrated on 22 July at the Diveyevo convent. Following the Bolshevik Revolution, Soviet authorities severely persecuted religious groups. As part of their persecution of Christians, they confiscated many relics of saints, including St. Seraphim. Furthermore, his biographer Seraphim Chichagov, who came to become a Metropolitan, was arrested, sentenced to death and executed by firing squad in 1937 (and is also celebrated as a Russian Orthodox saint). In 1991, St. Seraphim's relics were rediscovered after being hidden in a Soviet anti-religious museum for seventy years. This caused a sensation in post-Soviet Russia and throughout the Orthodox world. A crucession (religious procession) escorted the relics, on foot, all the way from Moscow to Diveyevo Convent, where they remain to this day. On 19 October 2016, relics of Seraphim were launched into space aboard the Soyuz MS-02. Seraphim is a patron saint of Russia's nuclear weapons.

The available information about relations between Seraphim of Sarov and Russian Old Believers tradition is somewhat contradictory.

In 1799, for protesting against the 18 Fructidor invasion of the chamber by Pierre Fran√ßois Augereau, he was imprisoned until the Napoleon Bonaparte's 18 Brumaire coup (9 November). In the Tribunate, Sim√©on had an important share in the preparation of the Napoleonic code, being rewarded by a seat in the Conseil d'√âtat of the French Consulate. =Empire and Restoration= As a figure of the First French Empire, he was one of the commissioners sent in 1807 to organize the new Kingdom of Westphalia, and was premier of King J√©r√¥me.

Nestled in a steep cliff at an altitude of about facing the Altƒ±ndere valley, it is a site of great historical and cultural significance, as well as a major tourist attraction within Altƒ±ndere National Park. Due to an increase in rock falls, on 22 September 2015 the monastery was closed to the public for safety reasons for the duration of one year to resolve the problem; this was later extended to three years. It reopened to tourists 25 May 2019. The Monastery is one of the most important historic and touristic venues in Trabzon.Secret tunnel discovered in S√ºmela Monastery History It‚Äôs not known when the monastery was founded, but the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism places the date around AD 386, during the reign of the Emperor Theodosius I (375 - 395).S√ºmela Monastery (Archived from September 29, 2007). Republic of Turkey Ministry of Culture and Tourism. According to William Miller, two Athenian monks named Barnabas and Sophronios founded the monastery. It became famous for an icon of the Virgin Mary known as the Panagia Gorgoepekoos, said to have been painted by the Apostle Luke.Miller, Trebizond, p. 61 During its long history, the monastery fell into ruin several times and was restored by various emperors. During the 6th century, it was restored and enlarged by General Belisarius at the behest of Justinian. It reached its present form in the 13th century after gaining prominence during the existence of the Empire of Trebizond. While the Emperors Basil and John II had endowed the monastery richly, it was during the reign of Alexios III (1349‚Äì1390) that Sumela received its most important largess: according to legend, the young Alexios was saved from a storm by the Virgin, and was bidden by her to restore the monastery. A chrysobull dated to 1365 confirms the freedom and autonomy of the monastery, together with all of its hereditary lands and dependents; exempts them from all taxes, except for one biannual tax; and restores to it the serfs whom the tax-collectors of Matzouka had illegally taken from it, listing 40 of the serfs by name. At that time, the monastery was granted an amount annually from imperial funds.Miller, Trebizond, pp. 62f During the time of Manuel III, son of Alexios III, and during the reigns of subsequent princes, Sumela gained further wealth from imperial grants. Following the conquest by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II in 1461, it was granted the sultan's protection and given rights and privileges that were renewed by following sultans. The monastery remained a popular destination for monks and travelers through the years. In 1682 and for the following decades, the monastery housed the Phrontisterion of Trapezous, a well-known Greek educational institution of the region. =Modern period= Until the Russian occupancy in Trabzon (1916 - 1918) , Sumela Monastery stayed active and visited by monks and Christian and Muslim pilgrimages. In 1923, Ottoman Empire collapsed and after the National Liberty war, the independent Turkish Republic was founded by Ataturk. After 1923, Sumela Monastery was abandoned because of the population exchange between Greece and Turkey according to the Treaty of Lausanne. In 1930, those who migrated founded a new monastery which they named as the new Panagia Soumela Monastery on the slopes of Mount Vermion, near the town of Naousa, in Macedonia, Greece. Some treasures from the old Sumela Monastery were carried to the new one in Greece. With the fire in 1930, the wooden parts of the Sumela Monastery were destroyed. In the following years, treasure hunters damaged the other parts of the Monastery. Today Sumela Monastery is a museum open to visitors from all over the world, and the restoration work is funded by the Turkish Government.http://www.sumela.com/listingview.php?listingID=4 Today the monastery's primary function is as a tourist attraction. It overlooks forests and streams, making it extremely popular for its aesthetic attraction as well as for its cultural and religious significance. As of 2012, the Turkish government is funding reconstruction work, and the monastery is enjoying a revival in pilgrimage from Greece and Russia. On 15 August 2010, Orthodox divine liturgy was allowed to take place in the monastery compound.Dormition in Turkey. Liturgy on the Black Mountain, Sandro Magister, retrieved from L'espresso A special pass issued by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople is now required to visit on August 15, the day of the Dormition of the Theotokos or Feast of the Assumption, when a divine liturgy is held. Only 450 to 500 visitors are allowed inside the monastery, although widescreen televisions are available to observe the event at a cafe some hundred meters away from the monastery. On 22 September 2015, the Monastery was closed to visitors for three years due to necessary restoration and field work. It reopened on May 18, 2019. Construction and buildings The principal elements of the Monastery complex are the Rock Church, several chapels, kitchens, student rooms, a guesthouse, a library, and a sacred spring revered by Eastern Orthodox Christians. The large aqueduct at the entrance, which supplied water to the Monastery, is constructed against the side of the cliff. The aqueduct has many arches which have mostly been restored. The entrance to the Monastery leads up a long and narrow stairway. There is a guard-room next to the entrance. The stairs lead down from there to the inner courtyard. On the left, in front of a cave, there are several monastery buildings. The cave, which was converted into a church, constitutes the center of the monastery. The library is to the right. The large building with a balcony on the front part of the cliff was used for the monks' cells and for housing guests. It dates from 1840. Restoration works in 2019 The inner and outer walls of the Rock Church and the walls of the adjacent chapel are decorated with frescoes. Frescoes dating from the era of Alexios III of Trebizond line the inner wall of the Rock Church facing the courtyard. The frescoes of the chapel which were painted on three levels in three different periods are dated to the beginning of the 18th century. The frescoes of the bottom band are of superior quality. The frescoes of the monastery are seriously damaged due to vandalism. The main subject of the frescoes are biblical scenes telling the story of Christ and the Virgin Mary. During the 2015-2017 restoration works, a secret tunnel was discovered which lead to a place which is believed to have served as a temple or chapel for Christians. Also, unseen frescoes were discovered depicting heaven and hell as well as life and death.Secret tunnel discovered in S√ºmela Monastery Etymology According to another etymological theory regarding the origin of the monastery's name, it comes from the Laz word ·É°·É£·Éõ·Éî·Éö·Éê [sumela], which means \\"Trinity\\" in English.http://karibche.ambebi.ge/eklesia/tadzrebi-da- monastrebi/2932-arsebobs-cnoba-rom-davith-aghmashenebels-mitsebi-sheutsiravs- monastristhvis.html Gallery Image:S√ºmela_manastƒ±rƒ±02.jpg Image:Sumela interior.JPGInterior Image:S√ºmela Manastƒ±rƒ±nƒ±n i√ß kƒ±smƒ±.jpg Image:Sumela view3.JPG File:61750_Altƒ±ndere-Ma√ßka-Trabzon,_Turkey_-_panoramio_(10).jpg File:61750_Altƒ±ndere-Ma√ßka-Trabzon,_Turkey_-_panoramio_(16).jpg File:61750_Altƒ±ndere-Ma√ßka-Trabzon,_Turkey_-_panoramio_(5).jpg File:Kl√°≈°ter_Sumela_-_panoramio.jpg File:61750_Alt%C4%B1ndere-Ma%C3%A7ka- Trabzon,_Turkey_-_panoramio_(8).jpg File:61750_Altƒ±ndere-Ma√ßka- Trabzon,_Turkey_-_panoramio_(6).jpg File:Fresco_in_Sumela_monestary.jpg File:Panagia_Soumela_Œ†Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≥ŒØŒ±_Œ£ŒøœÖŒºŒµŒªŒ¨_(39670786834).jpg Image:Rock Church, Sumela.JPGRock Church File:Sumela monastery in province of Trabzon, Turkey view from the road.JPG File:61750 Altƒ±ndere-Ma√ßka-Trabzon, Turkey - panoramio (13).jpg File:Altƒ±ndere_Valley_National_Park_13.jpg File:S√ºmela Manastiri - panoramio (6).jpg File:S√ºmela Manastiri - panoramio (5).jpg See also *Hagia Sophia, Trabzon *Mokissos ReferencesExternal links *Turkish Government's website *The History of the icon of Panagia Soumela *Panoramic Tour for Panagia Soumela *VR Photography Inside of Panagia Soumela *Greek Orthodox Liturgy in Turkey: Uncovering the Country's Non-Muslim Cultural Heritage *Photos of Sumela Monastery *Photographic survey of Sumela Monastery Category:Greek Orthodox monasteries in Turkey Category:Byzantine architecture in Trabzon Category:Archaeological sites in the Black Sea Region Category:Museums in Trabzon Province Category:Empire of Trebizond Category:386 Category:Christian monasteries established in the 4th century Category:Buildings and structures in Trabzon Province Category:Religious museums in Turkey Category:Landmarks in Turkey Category:Ruined churches in Turkey Category:World Heritage Tentative List for Turkey Category:380s establishments in the Byzantine Empire Category:Byzantine monasteries in Turkey ","title":"Sumela Monastery"},{"id":"2011097","text":"Comte Sim√©on, by James Pradier Count Joseph Balthazard Sim√©on (1781‚Äì1846), was a French politician.

The battle was fought at Sellasia on the northern frontier of Laconia and ended in a Macedonian-Achaean victory. In 229 BC, Cleomenes initiated hostilities against the Achaean League, the dominant power of the Peloponnese. In a series of campaigns, Cleomenes was successful in defeating the Achaeans, making Sparta the main regional power. This prompted the chief figure of the Achaean League, Aratus of Sicyon, to approach the King of Macedon, Antigonus III Doson, for military assistance. The Macedonians acquiesced on the terms that the Achaean surrender the formidable fortress of Acrocorinth to them. The Macedonians invaded the Peloponnese in 224 BC at the head of a Greek alliance and by 222 BC managed to hem Cleomenes in Laconia. In the summer of 222 BC, the Macedonian and Achaean army advanced to Sellasia on the northern border of Laconia, where they encountered the awaiting army of Cleomenes. After a brief impasse, Antigonus launched an offensive against the Spartan positions on the fortified mountains of Olympus and Evas. While the Macedonian right flank routed the Spartan left wing on Evas, the battle on the other flank was heavily contested. After initially pushing back the Macedonian phalanx, the Spartans were driven from the field by the superior numbers of the Macedonians. Cleomenes was compelled to leave for exile in Alexandria and Antigonus became the first non-Spartan general to occupy Sparta. Background The seizure of numerous important Arcadian cities by the King of Sparta, Cleomenes III, prompted the dominant state of the Peloponnese, the Achaean League to declare war on Sparta.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.46; Plutarch. Cleomenes, 4; . The Achaean attempts to recaptured these cities, led by the strategos, Aratus of Sicyon, largely failed as Sparta consolidated its position.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.46; Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 4; . Subsequent Achaean offensives in 226 BC were crushingly defeated at the Battle of Mount LycaeumPlutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 5; . and the Battle of Ladoceia.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 6; : \\"Cleomenes III\\". The Achaean position was additionally weakened when their erstwhile ally, Ptolemy III of Egypt, shifted his financial backing to Sparta. Ptolemy had been subsidising the campaign of the Achaeans against Macedon and now determined that Sparta would be a more effective ally to offset Macedonian power.. This was compounded by the resounding Spartan victory over the Achaean army at the Battle of Dyme, leading the League to seek peace with Cleomenes.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 14; ; . When the peace talks failed, Aratus sent envoys to the Macedonian King, Antigonus III Doson, seeking military assistance. Antigonus pledged to give aid on the term that the formidable citadel, Acrocorinth was ceded to Macedon.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 16. This conditions elicited a furious response from many Achaeans and Cleomenes used this to his advantage by occupying the major cities of Corinth and Argos and many smaller settlements. Aratus accepted the terms proposed by the Macedonians and additionally surrendered the cities of Orchomenus and Heraia to Macedon.; . Subsequently, Antigonus mustered his army for the invasion of the Peloponnese.. Prelude Antigonus marched towards the Peloponnese with a large army of 20,000 infantry and 1,300 cavalry via the island of Euboea. They resorted to this after having their passage blocked by the hostile Aetolian League, who threatened to block their march if they went further south.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.52; Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 20; . After reaching the Isthmus of Corinth, the Macedonian army found their march halted by a series of fortifications that Cleomenes had erected across the Isthmus. Several attempts to breach the fortifications were repulsed with considerable losses.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 20. Argos, however, revolted against Sparta and expelled their garrison with the help of some Macedonian soldiers. This defeat forced Cleomenes to abandon his position on the Isthmus and to retreat back to Arcadia.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.53; Plutarch. Cleomenes, 21; . Meanwhile, Antigonus revived the Hellenic League of Philip II of Macedon under the name of the \\"League of Leagues\\" and managed to incorporate most of the Greek city-states in this League.; . Antigonus proceeded to capture several cities in Arcadia that had sided with Cleomenes. He returned to Achaea before dismissing his Macedonian troops so that they could winter at home.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.54; Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 23; . Around this time, Ptolemy of Egypt stopped paying subsidies to Cleomenes, which left Cleomenes without money with which to pay for his mercenaries. In order to obtain money, Cleomenes began to sell helots their freedom in exchange for a sum of money.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 23; . Cleomenes became aware of the fact that Antigonus had dismissed all of his Macedonian troops and decided to launch a raid on the Achaean League. He gave the impression that he was going to raid the territory of Argos but instead switched directions and attacked Megalopolis. The Spartans managed to overrun a weak section of the fortifications and began to take over the city.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.55; Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 23. The citizens of Megalopolis were not aware that the Spartans were in the city until dawn after which a rearguard action by some of the citizens allowed most of the Megalopolitans to escape. Cleomenes sent the Megalopolitans a message offering back their city if they joined his alliance but when this offer was refused, Cleomenes ordered that the city be sacked and razed.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.55; Plutarch, Life of Cleomenes, 24; ; . The sack of Megalopolis came as a big shock for the Achaean League. Cleomenes followed this success up by raiding the territory of Argos, as he knew Antigonus could not resist him due to a lack of men. Cleomenes had also hoped that a raid on Argive territory would make the Argives lose faith in Antigonus because of his failure to protect their land.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.64; . Walbank assess this raid as being \\"an impressive demonstration, but it had no effect other than to make it even more clear that Cleomenes had to be defeated in a pitched battle.\\". Battle The initial positions of the Battle of Sellasia =Opposing armies= Antigonus responded to this raid by recalling his army from Macedon. The Macedonian levy marching on Laconia was augmented by the contingents from allies, who had mustered in the Peloponnese. Polybius describes the amassed army as consisting of 29,200 men. The Macedonian contribution to this force was 10,000 phalangists, 3,000 peltasts, and 300 cavalry, a figure supplemented by the addition of 1,000 Agrianes, 1,600 Illyrians commanded by Demetrius of Pharos, and 1,000 Galatians, as well as 3,000 other mercenary infantry and 300 cavalry. The size of army was greatly increased by the contingents of the Greek allies. The Achaeans supplied 3,000 infantry and 300 cavalry, the Arcadians 1,000 infantry from Megalopolis commanded by Cercidas, the Boeotians 2,000 infantry and 200 cavalry, the Acarnanians 1,000 infantry and 50 cavalry, and the Epirotes 1,000 infantry and 50 cavalry. To counter the Macedonian invasion, Cleomenes moved to raise the largest force that he was able. He was able to muster an army of 20,650 men. This consisted of the Spartan levy of hoplites, possibly 2,000 Lacedaimonians armed in the fashion of Macedonian phalangists, contingents of perioeci, and mercenaries with 650 cavalry. Cleomenes managed to fortify the passes leading into Laconia with a series of barricades and trenches before moving with his army to assume a position at the pass at Sellasia on the northern frontier of Laconia. =The battle= When Antigonus and his army arrived at Sellasia, they found the Spartan army occupying strong positions on the hills, Olympus and Euas, with the Oenous River running between them. Eucleidas with the perioeci and the allies were stationed on Euas, while Cleomenes held Olympus with the Spartans and mercenaries. On the flat ground between the hills, Cleomenes deployed his cavalry and the remainder of his mercenaries. The strength of the Spartan deployment prompted the Macedonians to not launch an immediate assault against the Lacedaemonians. Antigonus placed his phalanxes facing the Lacedaemonian infantry which was arrayed at the top of the two hills, with the order to advance and take the heights. His cavalry of Macedonians, Achaeans, Boeotians, and mercenaries under the command of Alexander, were arrayed in front of the enemy cavalry in the centre. The allied right wing advanced against the Lacedaemonians on Euas, but was attacked in the flank by enemy infantry that was initially arrayed with the cavalry. Without cover from their heavy infantry, the advancing allies were hard pressed by the Spartans from the rear and the front, until the Arcadian cavalryman Philopoemen, disregarding the orders, charged with the men who would follow. This timely initiative saved the light infantry on Euas from annihilation and paved the way to victory, as the Illyrians and other light infantry soon drove the Spartans from the hill and killed Eucleidas. After the battle, Antigonus praised Philopoemen's initiative and reproved his own commander Alexander. The battle on Olympus between the two phalanxes lasted longer, but when the allied reinforcements from Euas took the enemy in the flank, the Spartans fought almost to the last man, until their king fled the field with a handful of companions. According to Plutarch, out of 6,000 Spartiates, only 200 survived, the others preferring honourable death to disgrace. Accompanied by his closest friends, Cleomenes took a ship in Gythium to reach his mother and sons in Alexandria where he stayed in exile until his death three years later.

Starting in 1952, he had the world's biggest supertankers built for his fleet. Propelled by both the Suez Crisis and an increasing demand for oil, he and rival Aristotle Onassis became giants in global petroleum shipping. Niarchos was also a noted thoroughbred horse breeder and racer, several times the leading owner and number one on the French breed list.  Early life  Stavros was born in Athens to a wealthy family, son of Spyros Niarchos and his wife, Eugenie Koumantaros, a rich heiress. His great-great-grandfather, Philippos Niarchos, a Greek shipping agent in Valletta, had married a daughter from a noble family in Malta, whose younger offspring had moved to Greece to base themselves in a merchant business from Malta. His parents were naturalized Americans who had owned a department store in Buffalo, New York before returning to Greece, three months prior to his birth.

When Niarchos died, he left 20% of his fortune to a charitable trust to be established in his name and the other part to his three sons and daughter Maria by his marriage to Greek shipping heiress Eugenia Livanos, a nephew, and a great nephew. He notably excluded Elena Ford his daughter by his ex-wife Charlotte from his will. She sued the estate in both Swiss and Greek courts for her 1/10th share estimated to be worth ¬£700 million.  Thoroughbred horse racing  Niarchos began investing in thoroughbred horse racing in the early 1950s and won his first stakes race with Pipe of Peace at the Middle Park Stakes.

Overview The Book of Common Prayer according to the use of the Episcopal Church contains the liturgy used in its worship services and for other religious gatherings. The BCP and its predecessors are descended from the prayer books used by the Church of England. There have been four versions of the United States Prayer Book that have been used. They are known by the year of issuance: 1789, 1892, 1928, and 1979. In 1784, in order to bring about the consecration of America's first bishop, Samuel Seabury of Connecticut, in Scotland, a \\"concordat was signed by Seabury and the Scottish bishops\\" who consecrated him pledging use of the Scottish Eucharistic Rite by the Episcopal Church then, thus \\"following Scottish structure\\" (with some of its liturgy derived from Eastern Orthodox) and circumventing the Church of England. The current edition dates from 1979 and is marked by an attempt to return to full lay participation in all services and the recovery of the Eucharist as the principal service of the church. The 1979 version also reduces the emphasis of personal sin. There was enough strife in implementing and adopting the 1979 BCP that a \\"resolution of apology\\" was issued at the 2000 General Convention. Authorized supplemental materials have also been released in the last several years. After approval, the official text is controlled by the custodian. The first custodian was appointed by the 1868 General Convention to keep the plates and a copy of the Standard Book for the General Convention. The 1871 General Convention granted the custodian the responsibility for recording any alterations made by the General Convention in the BCP. The custodian is nominated by the House of Bishops and confirmed by the House of Deputies, and serves until a successor is appointed.

It is located in the Krasi≈Ñski Square, Warsaw. One of the chambers of the Supreme Court - the Disciplinary Chamber was suspended by a judgment of the CJEU. Despite the judgment, the chamber continues to operate. Function The Supreme Court supervises the adjudication in: * General courts: these are district, circuit, and appeal courts. They adjudicate in the areas of civil, criminal, family and labour law. * Military courts: these are circuit and garrison courts. They deal with matters relating to crimes committed by soldiers in active service, civilian employees in military units, and prisoners of war. The Supreme Court is the court of last resort of appeal against judgements in the lower courts (except for administrative courts). It also passes resolutions to clarify specific legal provisions and resolve disputable questions in specific cases. These however are not (at least technically) legally binding. Appointment of judges The President of Poland appoints Supreme Court judges for an indefinite period. This is done upon a motion of the National Council of the Judiciary. The President also selects the First President of the court from candidates presented by the General Assembly of the Supreme Court. The First President holds office for a six-year term, though he or she may be dismissed by the Sejm upon a motion by the President if found convicted of a crime. In July 2018 a new law came into force which lowers the mandatory retirement age from 70 to 65. The introduction of this law is contested and the constitutionality of the law is being assessed. Critics have argued the law is aimed at removing non-pliant judges and installing PiS-led government appointees. 2017‚Äì2018 Constitutional Crisis In 2017 the Polish government passed a law which would have forced all Supreme Court judges into mandatory retirement apart from those granted an extension by the Minister of Justice. The bill was passed in the Polish Sejm and the Senate however following mass protests against the bill it was ultimately vetoed by President Andrzej Duda on 24 June 2017. A revised bill reduced mandatory retirement age of judges from 70 to 65. The bill was later signed by President Duda and came into force in July 2018. The law effectively retires 40% of the Supreme Court bench including the First President of the Supreme Court, Malgorzata Gersdorf. Polish opposition parties, the European Commission, the European Parliament, the Polish Supreme Court, and the National Council of the Judiciary have claimed the law is unconstitutional because it violates the principles of the independence of the judiciary. In August 2018 the Supreme Court sent questions to the European Court of Justice regarding the reforms. Under Union law the court can prevent the State law from coming into force if it undermines the treaties of the European Union regarding judicial independence. On 17 December 2018, President Duda signed a law that will reinstate the judges who had been forced out of their jobs. On 8 April 2020 the EU Court of Justice ruled in a court case (\\"Commission v Poland\\") that the state of Poland \\"had failed to fulfil its obligations under EU law\\". As a result, the Court granted \\"the Commission‚Äôs application for interim measures\\" which will likely be realised with monetary fines. After CJUE suspend the Disciplinary Chamber On 12 October 2020, Adam Tomczy≈Ñski a friend of Polish Minister of Justice, from that not recognized chamber have waived the immunity of Beata Morawiec (:pl:Beata Morawiec), judge of the District Court in Krak√≥w. Moments after that the European Association of Judges expresses its unbreakable solidarity to Judge Beata Morawiec and to all independent Polish judges and ones again stated that \\"The Disciplinary Chamber of the Polish Supreme Court is not a court and cannot continue to act as one\\" and urges the European Commission to take all necessary measures to urgently reestablish the EU legal order in Poland.

On the leaf blade of K. beharensis there are trichomes of the non-glandular, bushy three-branched type. This type of trichome is dead, with evidence of tannin. K. beharensis trichomes are also characterized by striped cuticular ornamentation on their surface. Glandular trichomes are also present on the leaves, with more on petioles than on leaf blades, and more on the top of the leaf as opposed to the bottom.Chernetsky, Mykhaylo, and Elizbieta Werysko- Chmielewska. ‚ÄúStructure of Trichomes from the Surface of Leaves of Some Species of Kalanchoe Adans.‚Äù ACTA Biologica Cracoviensia Series Botanica 47/2 (2005): 15-22. Reproduction The genus Kalanchoe may reproduce asexually by producing plantlets on leaf margins, which when distributed on a suitable substrate will form new plants. Plantlet-forming species fall under two categories. The first category is induced plantlet-forming species that produce plantlets under stress. The second plantlet-forming species is constitutive plantlet-forming species that spontaneously forms plantlets. Induced plantlet-forming species have the LEC1 gene that allows them to produce seeds, whereas the constitutive plantlet-forming species have a defective LEC1 gene and cannot produce seeds.Garces, Helena M.

Defense system Kalanchoe beharensis uses a system of defense, not unique to this plant, termed stress-limited defence. This system involves deterring herbivores (plant eating creatures) before a high stress level ensues causing cracking in the tissue of the plant. High hardness, a structural component of this system, is characterized by tissues with high density. Since the tissues of plants employing this defense system have a high density, the defenses, commonly spines, prickles, thorns and hair, must reside on the surface of the plant. Amorphous silica is found in the defense structures with a microhardness of about 5000 MPa,Baker G, Jones LHP, Wardrop D. ‚ÄúCause of wear in sheep's teeth.‚Äù Nature 18 (1959): 1583-1584. which is higher than the microhardness of insects, and of mammalian enamel with a microhardness of 3500 MPa.Lucas, Peter W., et al. ‚ÄúMechanical Defences to Herbivory.‚Äù Annals of Botany 86 (2000): 913-920. Through research, this defense system is shown to decrease the amount of plant matter eaten by vertebrate herbivores by reducing the size of the bite a herbivore takes, the volume of a bite, or the rate at which biting occurs.Cooper SM, Owen-Smith N. ‚ÄúEffects of plant spinescence on large mammalian herbivores.‚Äù Oecologia 68 (1986): 446-455.

It also includes measurements of fluctuations in organic acid levels, PEP carboxylase properties and water relations. Some conclusions of this study are that Kalanchoe beharensis advantageously performs CAM fully during the entire arid seasons, avoiding CAM idling. It can do this because of its ability to maintain the correct water balance in its leaves, even in periods of drought.Kluge, Manfred, et al. ‚ÄúIn situ studies of crassulacean acid metabolism in Kalancho√´ beharensis Drake Del Castillo, a plant of the semi- arid southern region of Madagascar.‚Äù New Phytologist 120. 3 (2006): 323-334.

A small crater on the northern slope of the interior of Plant√© was a designated control point, CP-2, during the Apollo 8 mission.Analysis of Apollo 8 Photography and Visual Observations (NASA SP-201), compiled by NASA Manned Spacecraft Center, February 1969, pp. 59-61. Measurements taken from orbit on this point improved the accuracy of mapping of the lunar far side, although they were likely surpassed by subsequent Apollo missions. The crater is named for Gaston Plant√©, a French physicist (1834-1889), and the name was approved by the IAU in 1979.Plant√©, Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature, International Astronomical Union (IAU) Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN) References     External links * LTO-85C1 Plante -- L&PI; topographic map Category:Impact craters on the Moon ","title":"Plant√© (crater)"},{"id":"2011208","text":"Kalanchoe orgyalis a species of flowering plant in the Crassulaceae family.

The GX-1 has four synthesizer \\"ranks\\" or three manuals, called Solo, Upper, and Lower, plus Pedal, and an analog rhythm machine. The GX-707 first appeared in 1973 as a \\"theatre model\\" for use on concert stages, before the GX-1 was publicly released in 1975.  Overview  Yamaha GX-1 manuals The Solo rank features a 3-octave keyboard with 37 keys that are full width but shorter than standard. Directly above the Solo keyboard runs the Portamento keyboard - a ribbon controller which can be used to play continuously variable pitches roughly corresponding to the Solo keyboard note below. The Portamento keyboard overrides the solo keyboard if used simultaneously. The Solo rank has only a single oscillator, but has a dedicated low-frequency oscillator (LFO), pitch envelope generator and ring modulator. The Upper and Lower ranks each have a full-sized 5-octave, 61-note keyboard. They are both 8-voice polyphonic, with two oscillators per voice. Each poly rank has a dedicated LFO, and there is a common \\"random\\" modulation generator. The Upper rank also has horizontal aftertouch which can be assigned to pitch, volume or filter, and a polyphonic glide function. The Pedal rank has a 25-note pedalboard. It is monophonic, with three oscillators but no LFO. Performance controls include a \\"swell\\" pedal with footswitch, and a spring-loaded knee controller. All four ranks use a common voice-card design (called a tone generator in Yamaha parlance) to produce their sounds. Each voice card features a voltage controlled oscillator with multiple waveforms, 2-pole high-pass and low-pass voltage controlled filters, and two envelope generators for filter modulation and VCA control. There is also a variable band-pass filtered sawtooth wave, and high-pass filtered square wave on each card. There are a total of 36 voice cards in a GX-1, containing 36 oscillators, 72 envelope generators, and 144 filters. Due to the extensive use of epoxy-potted sub-modules, a complete set of GX-1 voice cards alone weighs more than a Polymoog. Preset sounds are stored on \\"tone modules\\" - small cartridges which each contain 26 fixed value resistor-dividers. These produce voltages which drive the voice cards, each resistor controlling one parameter of the sound. The tone modules are installed in compartments on the top panel of the synth. An optional \\"tone board\\" programmer could be inserted in place of a tone module, providing a full set of knobs, switches and sliders to control the parameters of a tone manually. Tones created this way could then be \\"programmed\\" onto a variable tone module using the Tone Module Setting Box. The Upper, Lower and Pedal ranks all have a dual-voice structure, where a different tone is assigned to each of the two voice cards per note. A set of hidden \\"wave motion\\" controls allows the second tones of the Upper and Lower ranks to be de-tuned. In the Pedal rank, the second tone is doubled on two voice-cards, both of which have a separate de-tune control. The GX-1 console weighs 300 kg. The pedalboard and stand add 87 kg, and each of its tube- powered speakers, four of which can be connected to the GX-1, weighs 141 kg (Which together equals a total of 951 kg, or 2096 lb). The GX-1 cost $60,000 (compensated for Consumer Price Index inflation, that price equals $317,271 in 2014), and was premiered in the US in 1973 at the NAMM convention. The exact production number is unknown, but thought to total fewer than 100. At least 13 GX-1s are known to exist outside Japan, the remainder are presumed to have stayed in Japan. The GX-1 served as a test bed for the development of the Yamaha CS-80 polyphonic synthesizer, which turned out much smaller and more portable (although still considered mighty hefty compared to contemporary synthesizers for live performance). Popular music A number of artists used the Yamaha GX-1 extensively in their recordings: * Paul Davis used this synth extensively in his studio and it‚Äôs on display at his home in Meridian Ms. * Keith Emerson of Emerson, Lake & Palmer in their albums Works Volume 1, Works Volume 2, Love Beach, and In Concert, as well as various soundtrack projects in the late 1970s and early 1980s, including their eponymous Emerson, Lake & Powell album, as well as in the concert film of their 1977 Works Orchestral tour and in the music videos for \\"Fanfare for the Common Man\\" - filmed at The Montreal Olympic Stadium in winter - ‚ÄúTouch and Go‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlack Moon‚Äù. Emerson described touring with the GX-1 as a \\"roadie's nightmare\\" because of its 600 lb. mass. * John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin used a GX-1 on their 1979 album In Through the Out Door. Jones also used it on Led Zeppelin's 1979 concerts at Knebworth. He later sold his to Keith Emerson. * Stevie Wonder is said to have bought two, one of which is on display at Madame Tussauds in Las Vegas. He referred to the GX-1 as the \\"Dream Machine\\" because of its three keyboards that allowed him to layer different sounds simultaneously and allowed him to create lush and very convincing orchestral sounds. Wonder used the GX-1 in particular on his 1976 album Songs in the Key of Life and his 1979 soundtrack album Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants. * Benny Andersson of ABBA used a Yamaha GX-1 on several ABBA tracks as well as on tour. He still keeps that at his Riksmixningsverket studio in Stockholm, along with many other old synthesizers and keyboards. * Hans Zimmer bought one of Keith Emerson's old GX-1s. * Hans-J√ºrgen Fritz of Triumvirat, a German progressive rock trio influenced by Emerson, Lake & Palmer * Rick van der Linden of Ekseption, whose solo album GX1 was played entirely on it. * Richard Wright of Pink Floyd allegedly owned one for a brief time, but it did not make an appearance on any recordings. It can be seen pictured in the album sleeve of \\"Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1980-81\\". * Richard D. James of The Tuss and Aphex Twin made a track named \\"GX1 solo\\", which was entirely composed with the Yamaha GX-1. Richard acquired the GX-1 from Mickie Most's estate after Most's death. * Anoushiravan Rohani purchased a GX-1 in the mid-1970s and still has it today. * The late Venezuelan organist and pianist Tulio Enrique Le√≥n changed from a model C-3 Hammond organ to GX-1 in 1973. He used that instrument until his last recording in 1980.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 11, 1993. In the episode, Lisa gives Ralph Wiggum a Valentine's Day card when she sees that he has not received any. Ralph misinterprets Lisa's gesture and, much to Lisa's dismay, relentlessly pursues her with affection. Lisa snaps at Ralph and angrily tells him they are not together and that she never liked him. Heartbroken, Ralph channels his feelings into his performance as George Washington in the school's President's Day pageant. After a thunderous applause from the audience, he is able to accept Lisa as just a friend. The episode was written by Frank Mula and directed by Wes Archer. Michael Carrington guest-starred as Sideshow Raheem. Al Jean, show runner of the episode, came up with the idea for the story when he remembered that he had received a valentine from a girl in third grade that read \\"I Choo-Choo-Choose You\\". The episode features cultural references to songs such as \\"Monster Mash\\" and \\"Break on Through\\", as well as a reference to the fictional character Droopy. Since airing, \\"I Love Lisa\\" has received mostly positive reviews from television critics; Entertainment Weekly placed the episode twelfth on their top 25 The Simpsons episodes list. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 14.9 and was the highest rated show on the Fox network the week it aired. Plot On Valentine's Day in Springfield, Lisa's class at the Springfield Elementary School constructs paper mailboxes for Valentine cards they are about to receive from each other. When Ralph breaks down in tears after getting no cards, Lisa gives him one out of sympathy. Ralph cheers up, develops a romantic interest in Lisa, and proceeds to walk her home from school. This leaves her feeling nervous around him and not knowing how to tell him she is not interested. The next day at school, on Marge's suggestion, Lisa tells Ralph she is not ready to be romantic. Ralph asks his father Chief Wiggum for advice on romance and is told to be persistent in his approach to Lisa. He soon uses his position as the police chief's son to get her tickets to Krusty the Clown's upcoming 29th Anniversary Special, and a leading part for himself in the school's President's Day pageant (as George Washington), in which Lisa also stars as Martha Washington, which further annoys her. With Homer having convinced Lisa that nothing can go wrong at Krusty's show, Lisa and Ralph go together. Live on air, Krusty begins interviewing audience members, and Ralph takes the opportunity to declare that Lisa is the love of his life and he intends to marry her in the future. Angry, Lisa snaps, stating she had never liked him and only gave him a Valentine card because she felt sorry for him. Later at home, Bart, having taped the event, replays the scene to Lisa where Ralph is humiliated and deeply hurt, making her feel guilty and regretful. Wiggum comforts Ralph and attempts revenge on Lisa by smashing the taillight on Homer's car, only to have it backfire on him when Homer retaliates by standing up to him for his behavior. On the night of the pageant, Lisa tries to apologize to Ralph, but he ignores her, burning her card in a fireplace, to focus on his role. Ralph proves to be a remarkably effective and eloquent actor, gaining the approval of the audience. Lisa approaches Ralph on the swing set after the performance and gives him a new card with a picture of a bee on it, reading \\"Let's 'Bee' Friends\\". Ralph laughs at the pun and happily accepts the offer of friendship as Wiggum heartily watches them from his car. Production alt=A man with glasses and a red shirt is sitting in front of a microphone. This was the first episode Frank Mula wrote for The Simpsons. Mula had previously worked with Simpsons executive producer Sam Simon at another Gracie Films show. This was the first season four episode that Wes Archer directed. Jeff Martin and Mula wrote the music for the President's Day pageant. Michael Carrington guest-stars in the episode as Sideshow Raheem, one of Krusty's old sideshows from the 70s. The story of \\"I Love Lisa\\" originated from a personal episode of Al Jean's life; when Jean was in third grade, he received a valentine from a girl that read \\"I Choo-Choo-Choose You\\". Years later, Jean wondered if the girl had really liked him. He told writing partner Mike Reiss about it and they thought it could be an idea for an episode where Lisa could give such a valentine to Ralph Wiggum, who would then take it too far. At that time, Ralph and Chief Wiggum were not established as being related. Jean thought it would be funny if Ralph was Wiggum's son, considering both characters are \\"fat and dumb\\". Despite this, Ralph's last name was already revealed to be Wiggum in the episode \\"Kamp Krusty.\\" A technique the staff used to come up with stories and ideas was to think \\"what holiday haven't we done on The Simpsons, or done lately?\\". As they had done several Halloween and Christmas episodes before, the staff liked the idea of doing a Valentine's Day episode. Cultural references The songs \\"Monster Mash\\" (by Bobby \\"Boris\\" Pickett) and \\"Break on Through (To the Other Side)\\" (by The Doors) are featured in the episode. Ned Flanders serenades his wife, Maude, to Rod Stewart's 1979 number-one hit \\"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?\\".The orchestral version of Tony Bennett's \\"Stranger in Paradise\\" can be heard in an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon. Homer's conscience, which tells him that stealing is wrong, speaks with the voice of the fictional character Droopy. Principal Skinner's flashback is based on the movie Apocalypse Now, with Laurence Fishburne and Frederic Forrest's characters visible in the background during the sequence. The Presidents' Day pageant opens with a \\"tribute to our lesser known Presidents,\\" including John Tyler, Zachary Taylor, Millard Fillmore, Rutherford B. Hayes, and William Henry Harrison, who mentions that he died 30 days after his inauguration. During the segment, the children on stage sing ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt find our faces on dollars or on cents!\\" and ‚ÄúWe are the adequate, forgettable, occasionally regrettable caretaker presidents of the U.S.A.!\\" and is meant to reference the general obscurity and ineffectiveness of U.S. Presidents during the 19th century. During the re-enactment of the Abraham Lincoln assassination at the school pageant, Bart says \\"Hasta la vista, Abie\\" while playing John Wilkes Booth in reference to the film Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The scene of Chief Wiggum sitting behind Krusty at an adult movie theater and Krusty thinking he is about to be arrested is a reference to Paul Reubens' arrest for masturbating at a pornographic movie theater in Sarasota, Florida. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"I Love Lisa\\" finished eighteenth in the ratings for the week of February 6 to February 12, 1993, with a Nielsen rating of 14.9. The episode was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. Since airing, it has received many positive reviews from fans and television critics. Entertainment Weeklys Dalton Ross said the episode was both touching and humorous. He added that in the scene where Bart runs a videotape in slow motion to show Lisa how \\"you can actually pin-point the second when [Ralph Wiggum's] heart rips in half\\", the audience does not really know \\"whether you're shedding tears of laughter, empathy, or both‚Äîyou just know that it's damn good any way you slice it.\\" The Arizona Republics Bill Goodykoontz named the episode one of his five favorites and highlighted Ralph's line \\"and my doctor said I wouldn't have so many nosebleeds if I kept my finger out of there\\" as one of the best lines in the history of the show. In a review of The Simpsons season four, Lyndsey Shinoda of Video Store cited \\"Brother from the Same Planet\\" and \\"I Love Lisa\\" among her \\"personal favorites\\" from the season. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, said their favorite scenes from the episode include Principal Skinner's flashback to Valentine's Day in Vietnam, the scene in which Chief Wiggum chases a duck to get his badge back, and the one where Bart and Milhouse play John Wilkes Booth and Abraham Lincoln respectively at the school pageant. They added that those scenes were \\"just the icing on the cake of the main plot.\\" In 2003, Entertainment Weekly placed the episode twelfth on their top 25 The Simpsons episodes list, and in 2008 placed the episode second on their top \\"25 New Classic Holiday TV Episodes\\" list. In 2019, Consequence of Sound ranked it number eight on its list of top 30 Simpsons episodes. =Controversy= When Principal Skinner tells the children at school that Valentine's Day is not a joke (due to Bart fabricating candy hearts with mean insults), he has a flashback in which he is sitting in a PBR somewhere in Da Nang in 1969. On an oil drum next to him is a manila envelope and a photograph of Colonel Kurtz. Skinner sees Johnny, one of his army friends, holding a Valentine card and asks him, \\"Sending your chick a Valentine?\\", to which Johnny replies \\"Yep\\", right before he is shot to death. Cutting back to the present, Skinner repeatedly calls out Johnny's name in anguish, to which a perplexed Bart states \\"Cool! I broke his brain.\\" After the episode aired, a Vietnam veteran sent in a letter to the show that read, \\"I was watching the Valentine's Day episode of your cartoon and I saw the horrifying Vietnam flashback. Do you really think this was funny, this horrible experience?\\" The staff ignored the letter and, as Wes Archer pointed out, the scene was \\"an obvious\\" reference to Apocalypse Now even featuring characters that resembled Chef (Frederic Forrest) and Mr. Clean (Laurence Fishburne). In contrast, Mark Groening‚Äîthe brother of Matt Groening and himself a Vietnam veteran‚Äî\\"loved\\" the sequence as well as the episode.

He received his doctorate from the University of W√ºrzburg in 2001 after serving for twenty years as an infantry officer in the United States Army. He has advanced the controversial thesis that the Schlieffen Plan as generally understood was a post-World War I fabrication. He first described his views about the Schlieffen Plan in a 1999 article in War in History, and further developed them in his 2002 book Inventing the Schlieffen Plan. Some scholars, such as Hew Strachan, have largely accepted his ideas, while others including Terence M. Holmes and Holger Herwig have dismissed them. In a review of Zuber's 2002 book for H-Net, Kelly McFall wrote: \\"Zuber's argument persuasively demolishes the commonly accepted version of the Schlieffen Plan. But his claim that the Schlieffen Plan itself never existed is more speculative and rests on a reading of evidence that is plausible but not conclusive.

It was established on 26 March 1982 by the communist government of the People's Republic of Poland after the introduction of martial law, an attempt to crush political opposition. The Constitutional Tribunal adjudicates on the compliance with the Constitution of legislation and international agreements (also their ratification), on disputes over the powers of central constitutional bodies, and on compliance with the Constitution of the aims and activities of political parties. It also rules on constitutional complaints. The Constitutional Tribunal is made up of 15 judges chosen by the Sejm RP (the lower house of parliament) for single nine-year terms. The Constitutional Tribunal constitutes one of the formal guarantees of a state grounded on the rule of law. Three judges, appointed by the President of the Tribunal, serve as members of the National Electoral Commission (Act of 5 January 2011 Electoral Code). In 2016 Julia Przy≈Çƒôbska, an ally of Law and Justice, was appointed as President of the Constitutional Tribunal. Her appointment has been argued to be unconstitutional because she was appointed directly by the President of the Republic rather than being elected by judges on the Tribunal, as required by Poland's Constitution. Since the reform and takeover of the Constitutional Tribunal by politicians from the ruling party, the independence and sovereignty of this institution has been criticized and often called as a \\"puppet\\" court by many Polish judges associations and foreign judicial organizations and also by the counterparts of the Constitutional Tribunal in other countries.  History  The Constitutional Tribunal was established by the amendment of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Poland of 26 March 1982 name=\\"Dziennik Ustaw19821183\\">[http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU19820110083 Dz.U. z 1982 r. nr 11, poz. 83.] Due to the brevity of the introduced article 33a it was decided that a law must be brought forth that would outline the proceedings of the Constitutional Tribunal. This became an intricate process with 15 drafts developed, and the final act was ratified by the Sejm on 29 April 1985 which allowed for the formal commencement of the Tribunal's judicial proceedings on 1 January 1986. But the courts competence and judicial capacity were limited at this time, as all rulings on the constitutionality of bills could be dismissed by a 2/3 majority vote in the Sejm. This in effect would place the rulings in an indefinite moratorium as these votes rarely occurred. On 24 January 1986 the first motion, reference U 1/86, was brought before the Constitutional Tribunal on behalf of the Presidium of the Provincial National Council in Wroc≈Çaw. The claimants sought to contend two paragraphs of the Ordinance of the Council of Ministers in regards to the sale of state property and the procedures and costs related to it as unconstitutional. In opposition with the governments stance, the court ruled in a 3-member panel on 28 May 1986 that the introduced paragraphs were unconstitutional. The Council of Ministers called for a revaluation of the case, but on 5 November 1986 the Constitutional Tribunal upheld its ruling. In 1989 the Constitutional Tribunal's powers expanded as it secured the right to universally decide on the binding interpretation of laws. Many changes came with the enactment of the 1997 Constitution; the number of judges increased from 12 to 15, terms of office were elongated by 1 year for a total of 9 years, and the Tribunal lost its competence to decide the interpretation of legal statutes (in the form of abstract provisions). In June 2015, the Sejm of the VII tenure enacted a new provision on the Constitutional Tribunal in which it sought to transfer the power of election of all Constitutional Tribunal judges whose term ended in 2015 to the Sejm. Subsequently, 5 judges were elected by the Sejm on 8 October 2015 and an additional 5 on 2 December 2015 by the Sejm of the VIII tenure which resulted in what was known as the 2015 Polish Constitutional Court crisis. Between November 2015 and December 2016, 6 so-called remedial bills which were devised by the Law and Justice party were enacted and in December 2016 the President of the Constitutional Tribunal replaced 3 judges appointed by the VII tenure with 3 judges from the VIII tenure.

He stood in 92 Test matches, the last of them in June 2005, the most for any English umpire. He also umpired 172 ODIs, including three consecutive World Cup finals in 1996, 1999 and 2003 Early life Shepherd was born in Bideford in Devon. His father Herbert was a sub-postmaster, having earlier worked in the Merchant Navy. His father had played cricket and rugby in his youth, and became an umpire for North Devon Cricket Club after losing the sight in one eye in the First World War. Shepherd's brother Bill was also a cricketer who captained MCC Young Professionals, but became postmaster at his parents' post office in Instow in the 1960s, playing club and the Minor Counties cricket.Rob Steen, ‚ÄòShepherd, David Robert (1940‚Äì2009)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Jan 2013 accessed 13 May 2013 He was educated at Barnstaple Grammar School, where he played for the school first XI from the second form and became head boy. He then studied at St Luke's College, Exeter. He also played cricket for Devon Colts and England Schools, including one match against his brother captaining MCC Young Professionals at Lord's. He became a teacher in Bideford and Ilfracombe, also playing Minor Counties cricket for Devon from 1959 to 1964, mainly as a batsman.  Playing career  After scoring 100 not out for Gloucestershire's Second XI in 1964, Shepherd had a reasonably successful, though late-starting, first-class playing career for Gloucestershire, stretching from 1965 to 1979, and though he never came close to international selection he was popular both with his teammates and the Gloucestershire supporters. He started with a bang, scoring 108 on debut against Oxford University in April 1965, and made eleven more hundreds over the years, though only twice (in 1969 and 1975) did he average over 30. Mainly a middle-order batsman, and never the slimmest of men even in his younger days, he relied more on his fine shot placement than speed across the ground, and his bowling was almost non-existent: he took only two wickets in his entire first-class career. One famous incident at the Gloucestershire Cricket Club saw Shepherd hitting the ball so hard into the crowd that it knocked out a spectator reading a newspaper. The spectator was taken to hospital and recovered with only minor injuries.  Umpire  After retiring from his playing career in 1979, Shepherd decided against becoming a coach, and decided to become an umpire instead. He began his second career in cricket, and the one which was to make him world-famous, when he was appointed as a first-class umpire in 1981. Quickly recognised as being one of the fairest-minded and most able officials in the game, within two years he was part of the umpiring panel for the 1983 World Cup, and within four he was standing in his first Test: the fourth Test of the 1985 Ashes series at Old Trafford. Standing with him in this Test was Dickie Bird. From then on, Shepherd became a fixture on the international scene, his round figure instantly recognisable by players and spectators alike. He was a very jolly character, with red face and white hair under a white flat cap, universally liked on and off the field. Perhaps his most famous quirk was his habit of lifting one foot off the ground whenever the score reached 111, or multiples thereof, they being regarded as unlucky by Shepherd in a ritual dating back to his childhood cricket team days. The number 111 is known as the \\"Nelson\\", and is considered unlucky for the batsman. Among other superstitions, he would tie a matchstick to a finger on Friday 13th, so he would be touching wood to bring good luck all day. Also famous was his tendency to shake his hand while signalling fours; to this day, many fans in cricket crowds mimic his action while celebrating fours. If the situation demanded, Shepherd could be very firm, notably when initially warning the Pakistan captain, Waqar Younis, in the 2003 World Cup against Australia for bowling fast 'beamers' (a full toss that reaches the batsman between waist and head height, being dangerous as it is extremely hard to detect for the batsman). Waqar again transgressed and Shepherd ordered his removal from the attack becoming the first umpire to take such an action during an international match. He considered retiring after he received much adverse press coverage in 2001, when Pakistan won the Old Trafford Test against England, after Shepherd gave three England batsmen out to no-balls bowled by Saqlain Mushtaq, who had stepped over the crease, but he was part of the ICC's first Elite Panel of neutral umpires established in 2002, and retained his place unbroken until his retirement from umpiring in 2005.The umpire's word is final ... but wrong, ESPNcricinfo, 22 November 2007 As his retirement loomed, Shepherd was lauded wherever he went. He was given a guard of honour by the New Zealand and Australian teams during the series between the two countries in March 2005. After his last Test, that between West Indies and Pakistan at Kingston, Jamaica in June 2005, Shepherd was presented with a bat by West Indian captain Brian Lara. He was in fact given special dispensation by the ICC to umpire in an Ashes match between England and Australia at Lord's as his final Test, but turned down the opportunity to maintain the ICC's neutral umpiring policy for Test matches. His fellow umpire Simon Taufel said of him, as quoted in his Wisden obituary: \\"What doesn't get highlighted is man-management skills, creating a happy environment for players to play in. And Shep was magnificent at that. The players had this enormous respect for him as a person. He put them at their ease and forged relationships that crossed all cultural and political divides.\\" In that obituary, the obituarist himself wrote: \\"The authorities struggle for a definition of the Spirit of Cricket. Perhaps the best answer is David Shepherd.\\" Shepherd was awarded the MBE for services to cricket in 1987, and he became the President of his home county club Devon in 2006. Shepherd was the first umpire to officiate in at least one Test match in all the nations playing Test cricket at that time.Cricinfo \\"Ask Steven\\" column Later life Shepherd retired to Devon, and returned to live in the seaside village of Instow, occasionally working in his brother's post office. He was married to Jenny, his partner since 1973, in 2008. He died of lung cancer on 27 October 2009 in Devon.David Shepherd, Test cricket umpire, dies at 68, The Telegraph, 28 October 2009Former Test umpire David Shepherd dies, ESPNcricinfo, 28 October 2009David Shepherd: Hugely respected doyen of English cricket umpires who stood in three successive World Cup Finals, The Independent, 29 October 2009 See also * David Shepherd Trophy * List of Test cricket umpires * List of One Day International cricket umpires ReferencesExternal links * Profile, CricketArchive Category:1940 births Category:2009 deaths Category:Deaths from cancer in England Category:Deaths from lung cancer Category:English Test cricket umpires Category:English One Day International cricket umpires Category:English cricketers Category:Gloucestershire cricketers Category:Devon cricketers Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:People from Bideford Category:People educated at Barnstaple Grammar School ","title":"David Shepherd (umpire)"},{"id":"2011251","text":"The Sloan‚ÄìParker House, also known as the Stone House, Parker Family Residence, or Richard Sloan House, is a late-18th-century stone residence near Junction, Hampshire County, in the U.S. state of West Virginia. It was built on land vacated by the Shawnee after the Native American nation had been violently forced to move west to Kansas following their defeat at the Battle of Point Pleasant in 1774. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 5, 1975, becoming Hampshire County's first property to be listed on the register. The Sloan‚ÄìParker House has been in the Parker family since 1854. The house and its adjacent farm are located along the Northwestern Turnpike (US 50/WV 28) in the rural Mill Creek valley. The original fieldstone section of the house was erected in about 1790 for Richard Sloan and his wife Charlotte VanHorn Sloan. Originally from Ireland, Sloan arrived in the United States after the American Revolutionary War and became an indentured servant of David VanHorn. Sloan eloped with VanHorn's daughter Charlotte and they settled in the Mill Creek valley, where they built the original stone portion of the house. The Sloans had ten children, including John and Thomas Sloan, who each (later) represented Hampshire County in the Virginia House of Delegates. Richard Sloan and his family operated a successful weaving business from the stone house and their Sloan counterpanes (woven coverlets with block designs) became well known in the South Branch Valley region. The Sloan family sold the stone house and to three brothers in the Parker family in 1854. The Parker family operated a stagecoach line on the Moorefield and North Branch Turnpike; the journey included a stop at the stone house, where the family served meals to travelers. During the American Civil War, the stone house was visited by both Union and Confederate forces, and was ransacked by Union troops for goods and supplies. The stone house served as a local polling station, and its use as a stagecoach stop ended after the completion of the Hampshire Southern Railroad in 1910. The Parker family opened the house for tours, and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The Sloan‚ÄìParker House consists of the original stone section, which faces toward the Northwestern Turnpike, and a wooden frame addition (built c.1900) adjacent to the original stone section. The stone section's exterior wall is about thick at the basement level and tapers to a thickness of about at the attic level. Most of the stone section's flooring, and the hardware on the doors, are original. Other features of the Sloan‚ÄìParker House property include a large barn (built in 1803) and, to the northeast of the house, the Sloan‚ÄìLudwick Cemetery.  Geography and setting  Mill Creek near Junction The Sloan‚ÄìParker House and farm are situated within a rural, agricultural section of the Mill Creek valley in southwestern Hampshire County. Patterson Creek Mountain, a forested anticlinal mountain ridge, rises to the west of the Mill Creek valley, and the forested western rolling foothills of the anticlinal Mill Creek Mountain rise to the valley's east. The South Branch Potomac River is located across Mill Creek Mountain, approximately to the east of the house. The house and its adjacent farm are located along the Northwestern Turnpike (concurrently US 50 and WV 28) about east of the unincorporated community of Junction (also known as Moorefield Junction). Junction is centered around and named for the intersection of Purgitsville Pike (concurrently US 220 and WV28) with the Northwestern Turnpike (concurrently US50 and US220 westward to Knobly Mountain and concurrently US50 and WV28 eastward to Romney). The Sloan‚ÄìParker House is located atop a hillside just south of the Northwestern Turnpike. Mill Creek flows west to east approximately to the north of the house. An unnamed ephemeral stream that runs just west of the house joins Mill Creek to the north. Mill Creek continues east through the Mechanicsburg Gap in Mill Creek Mountain at Mechanicsburg and joins the South Branch Potomac River.  History  Background = The Mill Creek valley and the land on which the Sloan‚ÄìParker House is located were originally part of the Northern Neck Proprietary, a grant of land that the exiled Charles II awarded to seven of his supporters in 1649 during the English Interregnum. With the Restoration in 1660, CharlesII finally ascended to the English throne. He renewed the Northern Neck Proprietary grant in 1662, revised it in 1669, and again renewed the original grant favoring original grantees Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper, and Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington, in 1672. In 1681 Bennet sold his share to Lord Colepeper, who received a new charter for the entire land grant from James II in 1688. Following the deaths of Lord Colepeper, his wife Margaret, and his daughter Katherine, the Northern Neck Proprietary passed to Katherine's son Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, in 1719. As conflicts with Native Americans began to ease, Lord Fairfax sought to entice European settlers to inhabit the sparsely populated western lands of his Northern Neck Proprietary. The Mill Creek valley was one of the first areas of present-day Hampshire County to be settled by Europeans, beginning in the mid-18th century. Early settlers were drawn by the valley's fertility. Job Parker, a direct ancestor of the Parker family that later acquired the Sloan‚ÄìParker House, settled in the Mill Creek valley during this period. = Sloan family ownership = The original fieldstone section of the Sloan‚ÄìParker House was erected around 1790 for Richard Sloan and his wife Charlotte VanHorn Sloan. Richard Sloan was originally from County Monaghan, Ulster, Ireland. Following the American Revolutionary War, Sloan sailed on a passenger ship from Great Britain to the United States. Despite paying his passage fare prior to his voyage, he was charged again upon his arrival. Unable to make this second payment, he became an indentured servant of David VanHorn. After several months with the VanHorn family, Sloan eloped with David VanHorn's daughter Charlotte, and the couple went to Baltimore, where they stayed briefly. After observing healthy cattle from Old Fields in Hardy County, they decided to relocate there. On their journey to Old Fields, Sloan and his wife arrived in Romney and chose to settle in Hampshire County instead. They later moved southwest of Romney to their property in the Mill Creek valley, where the Sloan‚ÄìParker House stands today. To construct the two-story stone house, Sloan and his wife hired laborers to quarry the native fieldstone and lay the stonework. Richard and Charlotte Sloan had ten children together (four girls and six boys), and the large house afforded the couple sufficient room to raise them. The house also provided the family with the necessary space to engage in the manufacture of woven goods. Sloan was a fabric weaver by trade, and he and his family developed a thriving weaving industry on their lands in the Mill Creek valley. Their entire production process was initially accomplished inside the house until Sloan erected a separate loom house. There, he and his sons built and operated six looms. On their farm, Sloan and his family raised their own sheep and grew flax; they also sourced flax and raw wool from local residents. The majority of the Sloan family's woven products were sold locally, and their Sloan counterpanes became well known in the South Branch Valley region. The family's trade in woolen goods and linens thrived until the middle of the 19thcentury. The present Parker family occupants of the Sloan‚ÄìParker House retain several woven coverlets produced by the Sloans. According to Sloan family tradition, Richard and Charlotte Sloan used a method of casting lots to decide which of their ten children should marry. Their youngest son James won a contest in drawing straws, and was the only one of their ten children to marry when he wed Magdaline Arnold on January 6, 1834. James and Magdaline operated the Sloan household while the other members attended to their family's weaving business. Two of Richard and Charlotte Sloan's sons, John and Thomas, were active in the military and in local and state politics. John Sloan served in the War of 1812 and was later appointed Major General of the 3rdDivision, Virginia Militia, by the Virginia General Assembly in 1842. He also served as a county justice from 1824 until 1828, a county surveyor in 1827, a county sheriff in 1839, and a member of the Virginia House of Delegates representing Hampshire County from 1825 to 1827. Thomas Sloan represented Hampshire County in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1832 to 1834 and again from 1835 to 1837. He also served as a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850, representing a district comprising Frederick, Hampshire, and Morgan counties. = Parker family ownership = North and west elevations, July 2016 The Sloan family sold the stone house and of surrounding land to brothers John Peyton Parker, Benjamin Parker, and William Parker on December 29, 1854, for $4,000. Following its acquisition by the Parker brothers, the stone house continued as the center of a large farm. Because of its convenient location along the Northwestern Turnpike, the house served as a regional stagecoach stop and local polling place. From the early 19thcentury until the completion of the Hampshire Southern Railroad to Petersburg in 1910, this stretch of the Northwestern Turnpike between Romney and Junction was part of a major north‚Äìsouth transportation route connecting Cumberland and Romney with Moorefield and Petersburg to the south. By 1845 the Moorefield and North Branch Turnpike stage line connected the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) Main Line at Green Spring with the north‚Äìsouth route in Springfield, allowing stagecoach transportation between Green Spring and Moorefield. The route of present-day WV28 aligns with this north‚Äìsouth route from the Maryland state line at Wiley Ford to Petersburg, and is concurrent with the Northwestern Turnpike (US50) from Romney to Junction and US220 from Junction to Petersburg. The Parker family operated their own stagecoach line along the Moorefield and North Branch Turnpike between the B&O; Main Line at Green Spring and Moorefield until 1884, when the B&O; South Branch Line was completed to Romney Depot. The Parkers' stagecoach line transported passengers down present-day Green Spring Road (CR1), Cumberland Road (WV28), and the Northwestern Turnpike (US50/WV28) to the stone house, where the stagecoaches would stop to allow passengers to have meals before continuing the journey to Moorefield via present-day US220/WV28. When a stagecoach arrived at the stone house, a loud horn would sound to announce its arrival, and then meals were provided to the travelers in the basement kitchen and dining areas (or \\"keeping rooms\\"). Travelers' horses and other stock were watered and fed outside the basement door. As well as their stagecoach line, the Parker family operated a toll house on the Northwestern Turnpike on the west side of its crossing of the South Branch Potomac River, approximately northeast of the house. During the American Civil War, the stone house was visited by both Union and Confederate forces due to its location along the Northwestern Turnpike. The small room under the stone house's front porch was also used as a picket station to guard the turnpike. Union Army troops ransacked and frequently visited the house to retrieve goods and supplies from the house and farm as they traveled along the Northwestern Turnpike. Despite its convenient location and the Parker family's Confederate sympathies, the house and its farm did not suffer major damage during the war. The Federal government later reimbursed the Parker family for the items appropriated by the Union forces during the war. The Parkers were provided with bills annotating the \\"purchase\\" of $162.45 in goods and parts during the years 1862, 1863, and 1864. These bills exist today and are in the possession of the Parker family. Extant records also indicate that the Parker family sold farm goods to Confederate forces as well. One of the Parker brothers, Benjamin Parker, married Isabel \\"Belle\\" Parker and they had two sons together: Renick Seymour Parker, who died at the age of 27 years, and John Henry Parker, Sr., who married Eleanor DuBois Johnson. She had the wooden frame section added to the house around 1900, at which time the Sloan‚ÄìParker House took its current form. After Eleanor Parker died, her husband John Henry, Sr., married Kate Parker. The Sloan‚ÄìParker House occasionally served as a polling place for the Junction community after 1900, and it ceased being used as a stagecoach stop following the completion of the Hampshire Southern Railroad in 1910. The house and farm were formerly serviced by post offices operated in nearby Junction from 1866 to 1868, 1874 to 1876 (as Moorefield Junction), and 1877 until 1997 when service was suspended. Junction's post office was finally shuttered in 2005; afterward, the house was assigned a Romney address. By 1962 John Henry Parker, Jr., the son of John Henry, Sr. and Kate Parker, was residing at the Sloan‚ÄìParker House with his wife Ruth Harmison Parker and their son David Renick Parker. While under their ownership and through their efforts, the Sloan‚ÄìParker House and an adjacent were added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 5, 1975. It became Hampshire County's first property to be listed on the register. Ruth Harmison Parker was a local historian and member of the Hampshire County Historical Society. She and her husband opened the Sloan‚ÄìParker House for tours in 1962, and again in July 1976, when they displayed furniture, glassware, coverlets, and Civil War relics handed down from the Sloan and Parker families. John Henry Parker, Jr., died in 2000, and his wife Ruth died in 2005. David Parker is a seventh generation male-line descendant of early Mill Creek settler Jeb Parker. He and his wife Jill have three daughters and one son.  Architecture  North and west elevations, July 2016 The Sloan‚ÄìParker House, as of 2018, consists of the original stone section (built ), which faces toward the Northwestern Turnpike, and a wooden frame addition (built c.1900) positioned adjacent to the original stone section. Together, the stone section and the frame addition form a T-shaped structure. The original stone section of the house, built of fieldstone, has remained mostly unchanged since its initial construction; slight alterations were made to accommodate the frame addition. Similarly, the frame addition has undergone only minor modifications since its construction. = Stone section = The stone section was built using locally available materials, and its size was probably considered large for its time. It is rectangular in its plan and measures approximately in width and in depth. The stone section is symmetrical in its overall interior and exterior design with minor exceptions in its basement. It consists of two stories, one basement level, and an attic. The stone section is topped with a steep metal gabled roof with standing seam profiles. The stone section's exterior wall is about thick at the basement level and tapers to a thickness of about at the attic level. The north elevation (main fa√ßade) has three bays on its first and second stories and one window in the western room of its basement level. Three six-over-nine double- hung wooden sash windows are on the second story, two nine-over-one double- hung wooden sash windows are on the first story, and one small window with two sliding panels of four panes each is on the basement level. At the center of the north elevation, a tall stone platform reaches from the ground to the first story and supports a large covered porch framed with wooden handrails and balustrades on its north and west sides. The porch's roof is supported by five square wooden columns: three along the north edge and two engaged columns against the house's stone exterior. The porch is topped with a metal roof with standing seam profiles. The front door, located between the first story's two large windows, features vertical boards on its exterior side and horizontal boards on its interior side. The front door is topped by a four-pane transom window. The east and west elevations of the stone section of the house are similar in design, but the west elevation has a door and large porch at the basement level. It also has a small one-over-one double-hung wooden sash window on the first story that was added after the wooden frame section was constructed. The stone section's east elevation features a small porch and a door, which were built onto the north end of the first floor around 1915. The porch is topped with a metal roof with standing seam profiles, and is supported by three wooden Tuscan columns and two square wooden engaged columns against the house. Both the east and west elevations of the stone section have an interior fieldstone chimney. At the top of each chimney, the original fieldstone has been replaced with brick. Each chimney is centered between two small two-over-four double-hung wooden sash windows at the attic level. The south elevation (rear fa√ßade) of the stone section remains intact, and serves as the northern wall of the wooden frame section. A window in the stone section's second story was removed to connect the second story of the wooden frame addition. Likewise, what used to be the stone section's rear door now connects the first floor of the stone section with the wooden frame section. This door is also topped by a four-pane transom window. The interior of the stone section contains two floors, each with two rooms, in addition to a basement and attic. The former kitchen and dining room (or \\"keeping rooms\\") are on the west side of the basement level, and feature a large fireplace. The east side of the basement serves as a large storage area. The two rooms on the first floor formerly served as bedrooms, but they are now used as formal living and sitting rooms. The first floor originally had one fireplace on the east side, but the design was changed around 1915 to allow for a fireplace on the west side as well. The second story consists of two bedrooms, each with a fireplace. The attic is completely open from west to east. The rafters are exposed, and secured together with wooden pins. They still contain markings of letters and numbers that enabled the proper placement of components as they were lifted from the ground during construction. The majority of the stone section's flooring, and the hardware on the doors, are original. = Wooden frame section = The wooden frame section of the Sloan‚ÄìParker House features various sizes and types of doors and windows. A deep porch adjoins the east and south elevations of the frame section, and reaches to a canted three-bay window on the frame section's west side. The entire frame section is covered with wooden shingles and is topped with a steep metal roof with standing seam profiles. The interior of the frame section consists of a dining room, kitchen, bathroom, and several bedrooms. = Ancillary structures = Ancillary structures on the Sloan‚ÄìParker House farm consist of an old log smokehouse, and a large barn erected in 1803. Widely spaced unhewn logs are located on the barn's interior and its south elevation. The remainder of the barn is enclosed with wooden framing. There are also several other barns and storage buildings on the property.  Cemetery  The Sloan‚ÄìLudwick Cemetery is approximately northeast of the Sloan‚ÄìParker House in a grove of trees along the edge of an agricultural field. Richard Sloan and his wife Charlotte VanHorn Sloan are interred in this cemetery. Other burials in the cemetery include Richard Sloan's son Major General John Sloan and American Revolutionary War soldier Leonard Ludwick and his wife Katherine. Benjamin Parker and some of his descendants were buried in this cemetery before they were reinterred at Indian Mound Cemetery in Romney.

She was known as \\"Knife Lake Dorothy\\" or as the \\"Root Beer Lady\\", as she made root beer and sold it to thousands of passing canoeists in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW), near Ely, Minnesota. Various factors combined to give her national prominence, extensive coverage in media, books and documentaries, and tens of thousands of visits by Boundary Waters Canoe Area canoeists. She first visited her future home (The Isle of Pines Resort) on Knife Lake in 1930. It became her home starting in 1934.

While fishing there he learned of The Isle of Pines Resort, a fishing resort on three islands further east on Knife Lake, and booked his first trip there (with his wife, brother and two friends) for the summer of 1930. Dorothy had just finished a semester of school, and when one of her father's friends had a change of plans, she was able to go in his place. During this visit she also helped out at the resort. She visited in each subsequent year and helped out more and more as time progressed. It became her home starting in 1934.

It was owned and operated by Bill Berglund. Molter became the owner of the lodge in 1948 when Berglund died. She was a trained nurse and would often treat people for minor injuries. Molter would only leave occasionally to visit family in Chicago or to take additional education in Chicago to maintain her nursing license. After Berglund's death she lived there alone until her death in 1986.  Evolution of the BWCA  Molter's west cabin 1978 Molter's life, and her place in the public eye, was significantly influenced by the evolution of the area into the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. Up until the mid/late 1940s, the story of the Isle of Pines resort was typical of many north woods resorts. It was reachable by seaplanes and by motorboats, the latter when the boat was small enough and the gumption of the traveler high enough to carry the boat and motor over land at the portages. Later it was reached by snowmobiles as they came into use. Her location evolved into the BWCA. Ensuing changes between 1948 and 1984 had significant effects on her life. The BWCAW became the largest US wilderness east of the Mississippi (almost , 2 million acres if one includes the adjacent Quetico Provincial Park in Canada) and the most popular canoe area in the United States, with over 250,000 visits by canoeists per year. This change eliminated nearly all motorized transportation in this area, and removed other residences, buildings, business and (the few) roads from the wilderness, eventually leaving her as the only full-time resident in a canoe wilderness area three times the size of Rhode Island. At the same time that these transportation changes \\"moved\\" her even farther from civilization, they brought tens of thousands of canoeist visitors to her home. These factors contributed to the interest in and endearment of her, including print media and television coverage during the last 34 years of her life. A few of the noteworthy changes to the BWCAW include: * In 1948, the Thye-Blatnik Act provides $500,000 to buy out resorts and private lands in border lakes area; Also provides for in-lieu- of-tax payments to Cook, Lake, St. Louis counties for federal wilderness land; Forest Service changes boundaries of roadless area and deletes much land near Lake Isabella (and Kawishiwi Lake) to accommodate logging needs and roads. This is the beginning of the USFS attempting to purchase the Isle of Pines; Bill Berglund dies and Dorothy Molter inherits the Isle of Pines Fishing Resort and property; Efforts to purchase Molter's Knife Lake property begin. * In 1949, President Truman issued an executive order banning flights below 4,000' over what is now the BWCAW thus, landing of float planes was prohibited. * In 1952, two pilots still landing their float plates are caught and their planes confiscated effectively ending any flights in or out from Dorothy Molter's Isle of Pines. * In 1958, the USFS changes name of Superior Roadless Area to Boundary Waters Canoe Area (this prevented the planning of a road that would connect Winton to Gunflint Lake near Grand Marais); People begin discussing the Wilderness Act * In 1964 the U.S. Agriculture Secretary Orville Freeman appoints Selke Committee to recommend changes in BWCA management; the Wilderness Act is introduced in the Senate by Hubert H Humphrey; Congress passes the Wilderness Act and the BWCA becomes part of the National Wilderness Preservation System with a clause that allows some logging and use of motors to continue; In that same year condemnation proceedings taking away her ownership of the lodge were completed. Following public outcry, it was decided that she (and Benny Ambrose of Ottertrack Lake) could stay until 1975. *In 1975 Molter and Ambrose were appointed as Forest Service \\"volunteers in service\\". This marked the beginning of a period during which the Forest Service began assisting Molter. * In 1982 Benny Ambrose dies, leaving Molter as the last full-time, non-indigenous resident of the almost BWCA / Quetico wilderness. *In 1978 the BWCAW Act was passed, including a ban on snowmobiles and motorboats in her area effective 1984.  Later years  Campers visiting Dorothy Molter's home, pic by James Keim Molter's summer tent/cabin and pier 1978 During the 1970s and 1980s, although her home no longer operated as a resort, visitation to Molter's islands reached upwards of 5,000-6,000 canoeists each year. Molter spent winters in cabins on the Isle of Pines and summers in a cabin-like multi-layered (canvas) tent on a smaller, satellite island a few dozen yards east of Isle of Pines. She had small, rustic footbridges between the islands, and a fence made of broken canoe paddles donated by visitors. She lived within yards of the US‚ÄìCanada border. She grew flowers in an area which is practically all rock and without soil. This required finding and hauling dirt and placing it into decommissioned fishing boats repurposed into planters and gathering wild seeds.\\"Dorothy Molter - Living in the Boundary Waters\\" 42 Minute Documentary Video by Judith Hadel and Wade Black Visitors were a \\"feast or famine\\" situation for Molter. During the warm months she would receive thousands of visits. Many signed her guest book which, would accumulate over 4,000 signatures in a summer. She began averaging between 6,000 and 7,000 guests per year, often over 100 in a day during the peak summer months of July and August. Winters saw far fewer visitors. She had no electricity, telephone or utilities. She used portable tanks of bottled propane for cooking and a battery-powered 2-way radio. Her cabin was heated by wood, and the home-made root beer that she sold was cooled by thousands of pounds of ice which were hand cut from the lake in the winter and stored in her old-fashioned (non refrigerated) ice house. Each year the ice lasted at least through August. Although she was technically prohibited from selling root beer after the 1964 Wilderness Act, visitors continued to enjoy her root beer and made \\"donations\\". With the passage of legislation extending the wilderness protections of the BWCAW, she was told she would have to leave. Due to an outpouring of support (including efforts by Senator and future Vice President Walter Mondale), a special exception was made allowing her to stay until 1975. In 1975 Molter and Ambrose were appointed as Forest Service \\"volunteers in service\\" and she was allowed to stay. This marked a period during which the Forest Service began assisting Molter. Benny Ambrose died in 1982, leaving Molter as the last full-time resident of the Boundary Waters wilderness. She lived there until she died in 1986. One early article on her was the October 1952 Saturday Evening Post Article, \\"The Loneliest Woman in America\\" by Andrew Hamilton. While the title was not literally true, the term caught on. As Molter once observed, \\"If I had been the loneliest woman in America, by the time all of those writers and TV people came up here, I sure as heck wouldn't have been\\" Through a combination of her remote location and BWCAW wilderness restrictions against motors and motorized travel, Molter's home was amongst the most isolated in the country. The nearest road required 15 miles of travel by water and five portages over land to reach.Dorothy Molter The Root Beer Lady by Sarah Guy-Levar and Terry Schocke Published 2011 by Adventure Publications Inc., Cambridge MN. It typically took approximately 1¬Ω days of travel from her home to reach the nearest road, and her home was approximately from the nearest (small) town. She died December 18, 1986 at age 79.Dorothy Molter; Chicagoan became a legend of woods by John Jeter Chicago Sun-Times December 20, 1986, p.55 She was survived by her brother, John A. Molter and sister Hazel Hoffman, both of Chicago, her niece, Sally Margis of Midlothian, IL and many other relatives. It was said that the people of Ely, the closest town, were very saddened by her death, but happy that she died in the way that she wanted to.  Media, book and documentary coverage  From 1952 until her death in 1986, Molter was the subject of ongoing media and documentary coverage. Her life was the subject of a book entitled The Root Beer Lady by Bob Cary of Ely, which is a collection of short stories based on the author's friendship with Dorothy, and in 2011, a biography entitled Dorothy Molter: The Root Beer Lady of Knife Lake by Sarah Guy-Levar (executive director of the Dorothy Molter Museum 2007-2017) and Terry Schocke (former staff at the Dorothy Molter Museum) was published. She was also the subject of National Geographic publications, a broadcast of the \\"Real People\\" television series, and of a documentary video \\"Dorothy Molter - Living in the Boundary Waters.\\" Charles Kuralt visited her and featured her on his television program, and also wrote about her in his book Charles Kuralt's America.

Putnam's Sons New York 1995 Page 146  Cabins and museum  The Dorothy Molter cabin in Ely After Molter's death, her cabins were dismantled and moved to Ely. The effort involved transporting the disassembled cabins by dog sled to a point at the Boy Scout canoe base on Moose lake. Time was of the essence as the Forest Service was directed to burn her cabins down by a certain date. An unseasonably warm March stymied those efforts to move her cabins by dogsled and special permission was obtained to use motorized transportation such as snowmobiles. Her residence was re-erected on the east side of Ely, Minnesota on a site near the Chamber of Commerce building. =Dorothy Molter Museum= The Dorothy Molter Museum was formed to preserve her legacy. The cabin was moved from the chamber of commerce site to the museum, and a second cabin of hers was also erected and restored at the museum. The museum is located on the south side of Route 169 (Sheridan ) at the east end of Ely, Minnesota.Dorothy Molter Museum Web Site References Category:1907 births Category:1986 deaths Category:People from Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania Category:People from Ely, Minnesota Category:American hermits ","title":"Dorothy Molter"},{"id":"2011274","text":"Sel√ßuk is the central town of Sel√ßuk district, ƒ∞zmir Province in Turkey, northeast of the ancient city of Ephesus.

The original M3 Scout Car was produced in limited numbers, while the improved M3A1 Scout Car saw wide service during World War II and after. Design The main production variant, the M3A1 Scout Car, was a lightly armored, open topped, machine gun armed, four wheel drive vehicle designed to be used in the reconnaissance role. The M3A1 Scout Car was crewed by a driver and commander, while there was seating for six additional occupants in the rear. Powered by a Hercules JXD 6-cylinder in-line petrol engine delivering , the M3A1 Scout Car had a maximum road speed of and the fuel tank gave a maximum range of . The vehicle‚Äôs four wheel drive and bumper mounted unditching roller enabled it to cross a wide trench and climb a high step, maximum fording depth was . The armored body of the M3A1 Scout Car was produced by the Diebold Lock and Safe Company, it had a maximum armor thickness of and was open topped, providing good fields of view but no overhead protection for the occupants, a canvas cover was provided for protection from the elements. The underside protection was also limited, giving little protection from the effects of land mines to the vehicle‚Äôs occupants. The M3A1 Scout Car was typically armed with a .50 cal M2 Browning heavy machine gun and one or two .30 cal M1919 Browning medium machine guns, all were mounted on a skate rail upon which the pintle mounts could be moved about. Due to its open top, the occupants were also able to employ their personal weapons. HistoryDevelopment= ;M1 Scout Car The M1 Scout Car was the first of a new series of armored cars developed by the White Motor Company for the US Army. Tested in 1934, the M1 Scout Car was an improvised, open topped four-wheel drive vehicle based on a commercial White ¬Ω-ton truck design. It weighed appropriately , was powered by a engine, and had a top speed of . The M1 Scout Car had a crew of four, a maximum armor thickness of and was armed with machine guns mounted on static mounts inside the vehicle. Seventy-six M1 Scout Cars were delivered to the US Army. ;M2 Scout Car The M2 Scout Car was a development of the M1, tested in 1935 the almost identical looking M2 was larger and more powerful, designed with as many commercial components as possible to keep costs down it could accommodate a crew of seven. The M2 Scout Car weighed appropriately , was powered by a engine and retained the top speed of . Twenty M2 Scout Cars were delivered to the US Army. ;M2A1 / M3 Scout Car The M2A1 Scout Car, later redesignated the M3 Scout Car, was a further development of the M1 and M2 Scout Cars. The M2A1 / M3 Scout Car retained the engine and had a top speed of . Sixty-four M2A1 / M3 Scout Cars were produced, all being assigned to the 7th Cavalry Brigade. ;M3A1 Scout Car The M3A1 Scout Car was the final development of the series. Primary external differences from the M3 were a widening of the body over the fenders, the removal of the rear door of the M3 and the addition of the front roller. Internally, the M3A1 had an improved engine and was fitted with the machine gun skate rail. A total of 20,918 were produced between 1939‚Äì1944. It was the only version to see service outside of the United States. The M3A1E1 Scout Car was developed to increase the range and fuel economy of the vehicle, it was powered by an Buda-Lanova 6DT-317 six-cylinder diesel engine. 3,340 were produced, all were sent to the Soviet Union. The M3A1E2 Scout Car was a version with an armored roof. The M3A1E3 Scout Car was an experimental version fitted with a pedestal mounted 37 mm Gun M3. The M3A1 Command Car was a command version, fitted with an armoured screen and additional side armor. The M2 Half Track was developed from the M3A1 Scout Car by adding half tracks to the rear of the vehicle. The post-War BTR-40 was a Soviet copy of the M3A1 Scout Car. =Service= The M3A1 Scout Car was used by cavalry units of the US Army in its intended cavalry role during the North African Campaign and the invasion of Sicily, being employed for reconnaissance, screening and as an armored command vehicle. The M3A1 was fast and reliable, making it popular with its crews. It was considered a major disappointment in US Army service, primarily due to its poor offroad performance, but also its lack of overhead protection. Cavalry units were forced to supliment it with M2 and M3 Half- tracks. Throughout 1943, most US Army units replaced the M3A1 with the M8 armored car and the similar M20 Utility Car, although the M3A1 was retained for rear area security and convoy escort duties. A small number of M3A1s were employed in Normandy. A few M3A1s were used by the US Marine Corps in the Pacific theater, but none saw combat. General George Patton used an M3A1 Scout Car as a command vehicle, modified with additional armor and a raised fighting compartment. A total of 11,401 M3A1 Scout Cars were allocated for supply to US allies under lend-lease, 6,987 were supplied to the British Commonwealth, 3,310 to the Soviet Union and 104 to the Chinese Nationalist Army. Some were also supplied to Free Belgian, Free French, Czechoslovak and Polish units. In British Commonwealth service, the White Scout Car was regarded more as an armored truck, reflected in the designation Truck, 15cwt, 4x4, Armoured Personnel, and was used in a variety of secondary roles, being issued to engineer, artillery (as an observation vehicle for field artillery observers) medical (as a protected ambulance) and signals units; within the Royal Armoured Corps‚Äô Tank and Armoured Car Regiments it usually served in Squadron or Regimental headquarters. It was used by British Commonwealth forces in every theatre they fought in except Burma. In Red Army service, the M3A1 was used as an armored personnel carrier by brigade and corps reconnaissance units and motorcycle battalions and regiments, operating alongside the BA-64. The M3A1 was also used as an armored command vehicle and a gun tractor for the ZIS-3 76-mm field gun, although the towing hitch proved to be unreliable, the M3A1 remained in widespread service throughout the war. The Chinese Nationalist Army received M3A1 Scout Cars from 1942 and used them throughout the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War. After the war, many vehicles were sold, mostly to Asian and Latin American countries while they remained in Soviet service until 1947. A few vehicles were used by Israel in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. At least one Israeli M3A1 was modified with top armor and a revolving turret. France employed its M3A1s in the First Indochina War and the Algerian War. By late 1990, the only country with the M3A1s remaining in service was the Dominican Republic.

The formation of a shield wall ( or in Old English,Old English Made Easy http://home.comcast.net/~modean52/index.htm in Old Norse) is a military tactic that was common in many cultures in the Pre- Early Modern warfare age. There were many slight variations of this tactic among these cultures, but in general, a shield wall was a \\"wall of shields\\" formed by soldiers standing in formation shoulder to shoulder, holding their shields so that they abut or overlap. Each soldier benefits from the protection of his neighbours' shields as well as his own.  History  Ancient history = Ancient depiction of Sumerian infantry shield wall, from the Stele of the Vultures honoring the victory of king Eannatum of Lagash over Umma, 2500 BC Roman legionaries in formation, Stele found at Glanum, on display at the Gallo-Roman Museum of Lyon-Fourvi√®re This tactic was known to be used by many ancient armies including the Persian Sparabara, Greek phalanx, and Roman legion, though its origin and spread is unknown. It may have developed independently more than once. Although little is recorded about their military tactics, the Stele of the Vultures depicts Sumerian soldiers in a shield wall formation during the third millennium BC. By the seventh century BC, shield walls in ancient Greece are well-documented. The soldiers in these shield wall formations were called hoplites, so named for their shields (hopla, \\"·ΩÖœÄŒªŒ±\\"). Hoplon (\\"ŒåœÄŒªŒøŒΩ\\") shields were three feet in diameter, sometimes covered in bronze. Instead of fighting individual battles in large skirmishes, hoplites fought as cohesive units in this tight formation with their shields pushing forward against the man in front (to use weight of numbers). The left half of the shield was designed to cover the unprotected right side of the hoplite next to them. The worst, or newest, fighters would be placed in the middle front of the formation to provide both physical and psychological security.Hanson, Victor Davis. The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece, p.27-28. In a phalanx, the man at the right hand of each warrior had an important role; he covered the right side of the warrior next to him with his shield. This made it so that all the shields overlap each other and thus formed a solid battle line. The second row's purpose was to kill the soldiers of the first line of an enemy shield wall, and thus break the line. All the other rows were weight for the pushing match that always occurred when each side tried to break the other's wall. When a wall was broken, the battle turned into a single-combat melee in which the side whose wall collapsed had a serious disadvantage. The Roman scutum was a large shield designed to fit with others to form a shield wall, though not overlap. Roman legions used an extreme type of shield wall called a testudo formation that covered front, sides and above. In this formation, the outside ranks formed a dense vertical shield wall and inside ranks held shields over their heads, thus forming a tortoise-like defense, well-protected from missile weapons. Although highly effective against missiles, this formation was slow, and vulnerable to being isolated and surrounded by swarms of enemy soldiers. Caesar, in De Bello Gallico, describes the Germans as fighting in a tight phalanx-like formation with long spears jutting out over their shields. In the late Roman and Byzantine armies, similar formations of locked shields and projecting spears were called fulcum (œÜŒø·ø¶ŒªŒ∫ŒøŒΩ, phoulkon in Greek), and were first described in the late 6th-century Strategikon. Roman legions were typically well-trained, and often used short stabbing-swords (such as the gladius) in the close-quarters combat that inevitably resulted when their shield-walls contacted the enemy. As Auxiliaries were often less well-armed, a shield-wall with spearmen was commonly used to provide a better defence. The Daylamite infantrymen used solid shield walls while advancing against their enemies, and used their two-pronged short spears and battle-axes from behind.C. E. Bosworth, ‚ÄúARMY ii. Islamic, to the Mongol period,‚Äù Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, II/5, pp. 499-503, available online at http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/army-ii (accessed on 30 December 2012). = Early medieval Tactics The shield-wall was commonly used in many parts of Northern Europe, such as England and Scandinavia. A mention of \\" Écild ∆øeall\\" (shield-wall) in Beowulf In the battles between the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes in England, most of the Saxon army would have consisted of the inexperienced Fyrd ‚Äî a militia composed of free peasants. The shield-wall tactic suited such soldiers, as it did not require extraordinary skill, being essentially a shoving and fencing match with weapons. The first three ranks of the main wall would have been made up of select warriors, such as Huscarls and Thegns, who carried heavier weapons and consistently wore armour. There would also have been nobles, such as Thegns and Earls, who would have had their own armoured retainers and bodyguards. However, the vast majority of opponents in such battles were armed with spears, which they used against the unprotected legs or faces of their opponents. Often, soldiers would use their weapons to support each other by stabbing and slashing to the left or the right, rather than just ahead. Short weapons, such as the ubiquitous seax, could also be used in the tight quarters of the wall. Limited use of archery and thrown missile weapons occurred in opening stages of shield-wall battles, but were rarely decisive to the outcome. The drawback of the shield-wall tactic was that, once breached, the whole affair tended to fall apart rather quickly. Relatively lightly trained fyrdmen gained morale from being shoulder-to- shoulder with their comrades, but often fled once this was compromised. Once the wall was breached, it could prove difficult or impossible to re-establish a defensive line, and panic might well set in among the defenders. Although the importance of cavalry in the Battle of Hastings portended the end of the shield-wall tactic, massed shield-walls would continue to be employed right up to the end of the 12th century, especially in areas that were unsuitable for large scale mounted warfare, such as Scandinavia, the Swiss Alps and Scotland. Examples The tactic was used at the Battle of Stamford Bridge, where the relatively well-armed Saxon army hit the Viking army of King Harald Sigurdsson of Norway unaware. The Vikings were not wearing as much armour, having left their mail behind on the ships and wearing only their helmets, and after a bloody shield-wall-versus-shield-wall battle, fled in panic. Both sides lost 5‚Äì6000 each, but the numerical superiority of the English won the battle. Both sides at the Battle of Hastings are depicted using the tactic in the Bayeux Tapestry,Bayeuxtapestry.org although the battle was ultimately won through a combination of Norman mounted cavalry and the impetuousness of less experienced Saxon warriors. = Decline = The shield-wall as a tactic has declined and has been resurrected a number of times. For example, in the Greek phalanges (the plural form of phalanx), as the dory spear gave way to the sarissa, it became impossible to carry a large shield and so it was abandoned (smaller shields were used). Likewise, in the Late Middle Ages, the shield was abandoned in favor of polearms carried with both hands (and often partial plate armor), giving rise to the pike square tactics.  Use in modern times  testudo shield wall. Although obsolete as a military tactic due to firearms and explosives, a wall of riot shields remains a common formation for police worldwide for protection against large groups using improvised weapons, punches, kicks, and thrown objects such as bricks, bottles, and Molotov cocktails.

It was created by Bob Kane ‚Äì who was most famous as one of the creators of Batman ‚Äì and produced by Al Brodax for King Features. The show was drawn in Australia, with Artransa Park Film Studios completing the bulk of the animation. Due to the quick turn-around times required by the rapid production schedule, further animation was completed by other Australian artists such as Gus McLaren and Eric Porter Studios. Description Riffing off the then- popular genres of superheroes and James Bond spy adventures, Cool McCool featured the adventures of a hip, trenchcoated spy, who ‚Äì as on the contemporary TV show Get Smart ‚Äì defeated villains despite being comically inept. Villains included the Rattler, Hurricane Harry, the Owl, Jack-In-The- Box, and Dr. Madcap. McCool's boss was known as Number One, although his face was never seen onscreen; only his arms and a cigar were visible behind his chair. (This was a reference to another contemporary spy show, The Prisoner, which featured a spy looking for Number One who ran the prison he found himself in). Number One's secretary was Friday, a dumpy girl who had an unrequited crush on the secret agent. McCool had three catchphrases: \\"Danger is my business!\\" \\"When you're right, Number One, you're right,\\" and (after bungling something) \\"That will never happen again, Number One\\" (Of course, it usually does.) The show also featured a Keystone Kops-style segment featuring the adventures of McCool's father, Harry McCool, a uniformed police officer, presumed to have taken place decades before Cool's time. Harry was supported by his brothers Dick and Tom. Only 20 Harry McCool segments were made, each one sandwiched between the two Cool McCool segment per show. Cast Cool and Harry were voiced by Bob McFadden, while most of the other voices were supplied by Chuck McCann. Carol Corbett provided the voices of the female characters. McFadden modeled McCool's voice after comic legend Jack Benny. =Secret, Inc.= *Cool McCool: A secret agent who takes several risks to save the world. Despite his powerful skills and super-spy abilities, he can be bumbling, foolish and clumsy at times. He drives a modified car called the \\"Coolmobile\\", (which can also transform into a jet plane or a submarine) which he summons by whistling. His mustache tingles when there's danger lurking about and can also be used as a telephone to contact Number One. A running gag in the series is that after the end of each mission, despite being successful (often in spite of his own bumbling), Cool would do something that would make Number One mad, thus causing him to get ejected. His catchphrases are \\"Danger is my business!\\", \\"When you're right, Number One, you're right\\" and \\"That will never happen again.\\" He is voiced by Bob McFadden. *Number One: Cool's boss. Whenever Cool does something really stupid, he ejects him out of the headquarters by means of a control dashboard at his desk. An office chair, footstool, file cabinet, water cooler and/or coat rack suddenly come to life when Number One starts pushing buttons, attacking and disposing of McCool in hasty, violent fashion. Always obscured by his huge chair, the only part of Number One ever shown are his arms, hands and a cigar. His real name is never revealed. He is voiced by Chuck McCann. *Mr. Riggs: Secret Inc.'s technician and repairman. He regularly makes prototypes of devices that are supposed to help McCool, but instead, backfire or hurt him ‚Äì and yet Number One usually blames McCool for their failure. He is voiced by Chuck McCann. *Friday: Number One's secretary who has a crush on Cool. She is mostly a klutz. She is voiced by Carol Corbett. *Breezy: Cool McCool's adolescent sidekick who aids him on some occasions. He is always there on the job when Cool is in trouble. He wears a trenchcoat like Cool and has hair covering his eyes, a hat, a buck tooth and a soft voice. Unlike Cool, he makes few mistakes and is not as accident prone. He is voice by Chuck McCann. =Harry McCool segment (Komedy Kops)= The cartoon is a flashback, supposed to take place decades before Cool's time. At the end of every first Cool McCool segment, Cool sings about his recent missions and that he should be more like his father (a uniformed police officer who was even more of a bumbler), and the flashback segment starts. *Harry McCool: Cool's father, who along with his brothers Dick and Tom (Cool‚Äôs uncles), were the Komedy Kops, a take-off on the Keystone Kops. He is the tallest and most intelligent member of the trio, thus the de facto leader, occupying the first seat in their chosen mode of transportation, a three seater bicycle. Like his son, Harry is voiced by Bob McFadden. *Dick: The rotund brother of Harry and Tom rides in the middle seat of their bike. He is often befuddled by Tom's gibberish, so his catchphrase question is, \\"What did he say, Harry? What did he say?\\" He is voiced by Chuck McCann. *Tom: The shorter brother of Harry and Dick has a bushy black mustache and hair that covers his eyes. He rides in the bicycle's back seat. He speaks in gibberish that only Harry seems to understand. He is voiced by Chuck McCann. =Villains= Cool McCool's enemies. Although each villain normally acts independently (aside from married couple Dr. Madcap and Greta Ghoul who work together), the in-between sequences introducing Harry McCool shows them united in their quest to capture Cool McCool (they are usually outwitted nevertheless). *The Owl: A barefooted, owl-themed human supervillain who is the first antagonist Cool McCool encounters in the series. He lives in a cave with pet owls and (in the debut episode) a cat-themed evil girlfriend named Pussycat (voiced by Corbett). He has the ability to command the bird kingdom to do his evil bidding. The Owl is a parody of the Penguin and is voiced by Chuck McCann. *The Rattler: A snake-like, green cyber-human villain with a passion for the arts. He hisses and slithers, and can communicate with and control plant life. The Rattler is also known to wield shotguns and bombs. He is a parody of the Riddler. He is voiced by Chuck McCann. *Dr. Madcap: A wacky foe with the ability to control all hats and make them do his dirty work. He adores both his collection of hats and Greta Ghoul, his wife. He is a parody of the Mad Hatter from Batman. Madcap's hats sometimes contain deadly surprises such as anvils or guns. He is voiced by Chuck McCann. *Greta Ghoul: Dr. Madcap's wife, who does not always feel appreciated or loved by her husband. She is a light gray-skinned woman who is often moody and depressed. Her vampire voice is done by Carol Corbett, in an impression of Greta Garbo who the character is modeled after. *Hurricane Harry: An overweight human wind bag who uses lung power to create mighty gusts that can blow anything out of his path. He speaks in a deep voice and a lisp. His fianc√©e is Bellows Belle (Carol Corbett), who wheezes when speaking. Harry's one weakness is his buck tooth, which, when accidentally knocked out of his mouth, causes him to rapidly deflate like a balloon. He is voiced by Chuck McCann. *Jack-in-a-Box: A maniacal crook in red-and-yellow jester attire that hides in a jack-in-a-box to scare and attack his victims. His weapons include a shotgun, grenades filled with laughing gas, and spring-loaded shoes. Whenever he speaks, his waist bounces up and down and his voice vibrates like a jack-in-a-box spring. He is a parody of the Joker, voiced by Chuck McCann.

From the middle of the 15th century to the 19th century, they came to dominate much of western Khuzestan Province in southwestern Iran. Beginning in 1436, ibn Falah spread his messianic beliefs amongst the less powerful Arab tribes along the area of the present-day border of Iraq and Iran, gaining converts in an attempt to forge a strong tribal alliance.Britannica In 1441, they succeeded in capturing the city of Hoveyzeh in Khuzestan, and during the following ten years the Musha‚Äòsha‚Äôiyyah increased their strength and consolidated their power in the area around the city and the Tigris. These early military ambitions were fueled by Muhammad ibn Falah's zealous millenarian theology, which continued to significantly influence the later military campaigns of the Musha‚Äòsha‚Äôiyyah decades after his death. Successors of ibn Falah were in continual conflict with the Safavid rulers as well as with Iranian Arab tribes until overcome by the Safavids in 1508. The conflict with the Safavids was driven not only by politics and territorial domination, but also by theological differences and competition between two rival Shi'a schools of thought. According to Moojan Momen, both sects adhered to heterodox (ghuluww) Shi'i beliefs. According to the order's Islamic eschatology, the Mahdi will appear at the end times in Yemen to lead the forces of good in a struggle against the forces of evil, who will be based in Syria and Greater Khorasan. The Musha‚Äòsha‚Äôiyyah believed that the end times were imminent and that they would need to defeat the Safavids and gain control of Iran in order to fulfill the prophecy heralded by ibn Falah. The Musha‚Äòsha‚Äôiyyah gradually abandoned their heretical beliefs and were absorbed to mainstream Twelver Shƒ´‚Äòah orthodoxy. Like other mystical Shƒ´‚Äòah sects, they placed a great deal of importance upon poetry and art. Unreferenced sources indicate that their rule ended towards the 19th century with the rise to power of the Banu Ka'b, which, under the leadership of Jabir al-Kaabi, had become the dominant power in the western region of Iran. However, Momen writes that by the 16th century they were already reduced to being the governors of Khuzestan.

The reign of Jabir Ibn Merdaw  Sheikh Jabir was troubled by intertribal wars. He therefore confined himself to an attitude of neutrality while maintaining good relations with both the Persian and Ottoman governments, and notably with the Walis of Baghdad. The tribe which was most troubling for Jabir was the Rabi'ah. He thus turned to an ancient Arabian diplomatic practice: he married Noura, the daughter of the Sheikh of the Rabi'ah, Talal, in order to appease the opposition of that tribe. One son was born from this union, to become the last ruler of autonomous Arabistan. The constant conflict between the Ottomans and the Qajars, the weakening of these empires, as well as the intelligent diplomacy of Sheikh Jabir would result in the Persian emperor, Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, recognising Arabistan as the dominion of Sheikh Jabir and his successors. The Shah agreed to not interfere in the internal affairs of the emirate.  Death  Jabir passed away on 2 November 1881 and was succeeded by his second son Miz'al Khan ibn Haji Jabir Khan.

Development OKB-586 developed the MR-UR-100 project. The purpose was to develop a MIRV capable replacement for the existing UR-100 missiles in service. While designed to fit into existing UR-100 silos, it still required some modification of existing silos to accommodate the new missile, due to its requirement for a cold launch system. The development of \\"modernized UR-100\\" was authorized on 19 August 1970 (document No.682-218) and assigned to both OKB-586 and TsKBM (builder of UR-100). The design bureau conducted flight tests from 1971 through 1974. Deployment commenced in December 1978.

NIK is entitled to audit all state institutions, government and local government administrative units, together with those corporate bodies and non- governmental organisations which perform public contracts or receive government grants and guarantees. The Constitution of the Republic of Poland, and the statute relating to the NIK, determine that the Polish SAI functions on the principle of collegiate responsibility. The Speaker of the Parliament appoints members of the College for a three-year tenure. The tasks of the College include the approval of the analysis of the state budget execution and the principles of fiscal policy, the audit of the NIK‚Äôs performance, formulating an opinion concerning certification of performance of duties part of discharge procedure of the government, the work plan and the draft budget for the NIK. The College assesses audit programmes and the outcomes of particularly important audits. It also considers post audit objections. Under the current regulations, NIK is answerable to the Sejm, which appoints its President for a 6-year term, with the approval of the Senate. Terms of office of the President of the NIK do not necessarily coincide with those of the Parliament, which in practice prevents this office from being dependent on any political party. Like members of the Sejm, the President of NIK also enjoys immunity: he cannot be arrested or indicted without the consent of the Sejm. Currently, the post of the President of the NIK is held by Krzysztof Kwiatkowski, appointed on August 27, 2013. The Supreme Audit Office operates through its Departments and Regional Branches. The division into Departments reflects the scope of the matters it audits, and thus NIK includes the following Departments: *Public Administration *Budget and Finance *Economy, Public Assets and Privatisation *Infrastructure *Audit Methodology and Professional Development *Science, Education and National Heritage *National Defence *Public Order and Internal Security *Labour, Social Affairs and Family *Legal Affairs *Agriculture and Rural Development *Strategy *Environment *Health Other Departments of the NIK: *Facilities and Logistics *IT *Corporate Services *Accounts The division into Regional Branches is connected with the territorial division of Poland. The number of NIK Regional Branches, 16, equals that of the voivodeships. NIK institutes audit proceedings on its own initiative, at the request of Sejm or its bodies or representatives (e.g. the Speaker of Sejm), the President of the Republic, or the Prime Minister. Special types of NIK activities include audits of the state budget execution and of the principles of monetary policy, as well as the NIK opinion in votes of confidence for the Council of Ministers. The NIK fulfils its tasks based on periodic work plans. In the first instance, the audit of the state budget execution is completed, as the NIK is legally bound to conduct this activity. NIK undertakes other audits according to prioritised directions established by the NIK College for a period of three years. The NIK establishes whether the state fulfils its obligations towards its citizens, as well as indicates areas in which there are concerns, in particular ones that could be hindering proper development. Each year new audit areas are selected according to which specific themes for planned audits are programmed. NIK can also undertake ad hoc audits. The Supreme Audit Office cooperates with similar bodies in the European Union countries, with the European Court of Auditors, International Board of Auditors for NATO, as well as the auditing authorities in other countries of Central and Eastern Europe such as the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Russia, and Hungary. The Supreme Audit Office also cooperates with its European partners within the framework of EUROSAI - the European Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions, which is one of seven regional groups of INTOSAI - the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions. Jacek Jezierski, President of the NIK was the Chair of EUROSAI Governing Board in 2008-2011.

The capacity of the ballroom is dependent on the configuration of the room; it seats 2,500 people for theatrical productions and musical performances, and several thousand for events held within a central ring. The floor of the ballroom is flat.https://mc34.com/events-venue/events-photos/ The two main balconies ‚Äì which are unusually close to the ground and gently sloped ‚Äì seat a total of 1,200. The third balcony has been stripped of seats and is not used. https://mc34.com/events-venue/events-photos/ History The Manhattan Center was constructed in 1906 by Oscar Hammerstein I as the Manhattan Opera House, the home for his Manhattan Opera Company, an alternative to the popular yet comparatively expensive Metropolitan Opera. In 1910, the Metropolitan Opera paid Hammerstein $1.2 million to stop operating the Manhattan Opera House as an opera venue for ten years. This led to the elaborately decorated theater being used for a variety of events, including vaudeville. The ownership of the center changed hands multiple times over the next few decades, with the theater being converted into a large ballroom and being used as a Freemason's temple in the 1930s and a trade union headquarters in the 1940s before falling into disuse in the 1970s, before being bought by Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church, the ballroom's current owner. The building was renamed Manhattan Center Studios in 1986, and in 1997 the former theater was renamed the Hammerstein Ballroom and underwent extensive renovation, with the hand painted ceiling being completely restored. Notable events The Hammerstein Ballroom has seen performances from a wide variety of musical acts and its popularity has varied over the years due mainly to competition within the neighborhood. *The professional wrestling promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling staged some of its events from the Ballroom.

Early life and family McKean was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. He married Havana-born Elena Garcia-Bengochea on December 11, 1976. Bengochea is a Women's Ministry Leader in the City of Angels International Christian Church. They have three children. Early work McKean was baptized in 1972 while a freshman at the University of Florida in Gainesville. His mentor, Charles H. \\"Chuck\\" Lucas, was the evangelist of the 14th Street Church of Christ at the time. In 1976, McKean was hired as campus minister for the Heritage Chapel Church of Christ, located at Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois. Lexington Church of Christ McKean moved to the Boston area in 1979 and began working in the Lexington Church of Christ.Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L. Dunnavant, The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Christian Churches/Churches of Christ, Churches of Christ, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2004, , , 854 pages, entry on International Churches of Christ He asked them to \\"redefine their commitment to Christ,\\" and introduced the use of discipling partners. The congregation grew rapidly, and was renamed the Boston Church of Christ. The International Churches of Christ In the mid-1980s, McKean became leader of both Boston and Crossroads Movements, eventually splitting from mainstream Churches of Christ, to become the International Church of Christ (ICOC). The movement was first recognized as an independent religious group in 1992 when John Vaughn, a church growth specialist at Fuller Theological Seminary, listed them as a separate entity.Stanback, C. Foster. Into All Nations: A History of the International Churches of Christ. IPI, 2005 Time magazine ran a full-page story on the movement in 1992 calling them \\"one of the world's fastest-growing and most innovative bands of Bible thumpers\\" that had grown into \\"a global empire of 103 congregations from California to Cairo with total Sunday attendance of 50,000\\", and which also raised concerns about authoritarian leadership, pressure placed on members, and whether the group should be considered a cult. A formal break was made from the mainline Churches of Christ in 1993 when the movement organized under the name \\"International Churches of Christ.\\" This new designation formalized a division that was already in existence between those involved with the Crossroads/Boston Movement and \\"mainline\\" Churches of Christ.Leroy Garrett, The Stone-Campbell Movement: The Story of the American Restoration Movement, College Press, 2002, , , 573 pages In 1990, the McKeans moved to Los Angeles to lead the Los Angeles International Church of Christ, where they presided through the 1990s. =Resignation from the International Churches of Christ= Beginning in the late 1990s, McKean's moral authority as the leader of the movement came into question. Expectations for continued numerical growth and the pressure to sacrifice financially to support missionary efforts took its toll. Added to this was the loss of local leaders to new planting projects. In some areas, decreases in membership began to occur.Wilson, John F. \\"The International Church of Christ: A Historical Overview.\\" Leaven (Pepperdine University), 2010: 1-5 At the same time, realization was growing that the accumulated cost of his leadership style and associated advantages were outweighing the benefits. In 2001, McKean was asked by a group of long-standing elders in the ICoC to take a sabbatical from overall leadership of the ICOC. On 12 November 2001, McKean wrote that he had decided to take a sabbatical from his role as the leader of the International Churches of Christ. He issued the following statement: One year later, In November 2002, McKean announced his resignations from his roles as World Missions Evangelist and leader of the world sector leaders.Kip McKean, Kip McKean Resignation Letter, November 6, 2002 He cited ongoing family problems, apologized for his own arrogance and said that his sins \\"have weakened and embittered many in our churches\\", and \\"these sins have surfaced in my family as well as the church.\\" A year earlier one of his children had left the church. Referring to this event, McKean said: \\"This, along with my leadership sins of arrogance, and not protecting the weak caused uncertainty in my leadership among some of the World Sector Leaders.\\" Additionally, his over emphasis on numerical goals, not seeking discipling in his own life and claiming God's victories as his own, were cited by McKean as the reasons for his resignation.https://www.cesnur.org/2002/mckean.htm His resignation was acknowledged by a letter from the elders the following day.Al Baird and Bob Gempel, Elders' response to McKean Resignation, November 7, 2002 After a period leading an ICOC congregation in Portland, Oregon, he started a new church separated from the ICOC. This movement was named the International Christian Church by him.Harding, Ron. \\"The Biography of Kip McKean\\" kipmckean.com. June 18, 2012 The period following McKean's resignation from leadership and departure was followed by a number of changes in the ICoC. International Christian Church On 15 October 2006, McKean published in the Portland church bulletin the first of a three-part series entitled, \\"Partners in the Gospel.\\"Kim McKean, Partners In The Gospel (Part 1), UpsideDown21 (accessed 12/06/2013)Kip McKean, Partners In The Gospel (Part 2), UpsideDown21 (accessed 12/06/2013)Kip McKean, Partners In The Gospel (Part 3), UpsideDown21 (accessed 12/06/2013) Though the names \\"Portland Movement\\" and \\"Sold-Out Discipling Movement\\" had been used for over a year, these three articles were the first formal announcement of the birth of the International Christian Church. It was only after this October 2006 date that any church affiliated with the Portland Church changed their name to ICC. Since 2006, the congregations under McKean's leadership have been called the International Christian Church. In April 2007, McKean and his wife Elena left the Portland International Christian Church to plant the City of Angels International Christian Church in Los Angeles. McKean and his wife were accompanied by 40 other leaders from the Portland ICC. Author McKean has written a short book entitled Go Make Disciples: The Dream.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 6, 1994. In the episode, a crime wave caused by an elusive cat burglar plagues Springfield. Lisa is distraught when her saxophone is stolen, and Homer promises to get it back. The police are ineffective, so Homer takes charge of a neighborhood watch. Under his leadership it becomes a vigilante group which fails to catch the burglar. With the help of Grampa, Homer discovers that the burglar is a charming senior named Molloy. Molloy is arrested, but he outwits the citizens of Springfield and escapes. The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Jim Reardon. Sam Neill guest starred in the episode as Molloy. \\"Homer the Vigilante\\" was selected for release in a 1997 video collection of selected episodes titled: The Simpsons: Crime and Punishment. It features cultural references to films such as It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and Dr. Strangelove. Since airing, the episode has received positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 12.2, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired. Plot Springfield is plagued by a cat burglar who makes several burglaries, including the Simpsons' house. Among the stolen items are Lisa's saxophone, Marge's pearl necklace, Bart's stamp collection, and a handheld television. The town's residents arm themselves and install security devices to thwart the burglar. A neighborhood watch group is formed and Homer is elected as its leader. The street patrol soon devolves into a vigilante group whose members violate laws instead of catching criminals. When Homer is interviewed on news anchor Kent Brockman's Smartline, the cat burglar calls the show and reveals he plans to steal the world's largest cubic zirconia from the Springfield museum. Homer's posse guards the museum, refusing the help of Grampa and his friends from the Springfield Retirement Castle. After Homer spots a group of teenagers drinking beer, he leaves his post to intervene but gets drunk with them instead. When the cat burglar subsequently steals the zirconia, Homer is blamed and pelted with vegetables by the unforgiving townspeople. Later Grampa reveals the cat burglar is a fellow resident of the retirement home named Molloy. Homer captures Molloy at the home and the surprisingly amiable cat burglar returns the objects he stole. Chief Wiggum arrests and imprisons him. At the police station, Molloy casually observes that Homer and the cops would like to know where he hid his loot. When Molloy tells them the stash is hidden under a giant \\"T\\" somewhere in Springfield, they rush from the station hoping to find the buried treasure. After checking several possible sites, the crowd returns to get more information from Molloy, who directs them to a large, T-shaped palm tree on the outskirts of town. The residents excavate the site, but find only a box containing a note from Molloy; he lied about the treasure in order to buy himself enough time to escape from his cell. Several citizens continue to dig, hoping that there is a real treasure, but soon find themselves at a loss for ways to get out of the hole they have made. Production Sam Neill guest starred in the episode as Molloy. The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Jim Reardon. New Zealand actor Sam Neill guest starred in the episode as Molloy, the cat burglar. Executive producer David Mirkin thought Neill, a big The Simpsons fan, was \\"lovely\\" to direct. Mirkin also said Neill was \\"really game\\" and did \\"a terrific job\\" on the episode. Neill considers recording this episode to be a \\"high-point\\" of his career. One scene of the episode features Kent Brockman reporting on the burglaries. Mirkin said this was a joke the staff enjoyed doing because it pointed out how negative and mean-spirited news broadcasts can be, and how they are seemingly \\"always trying to scare everybody\\" by creating panic and depression. \\"Homer the Vigilante\\" originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 6, 1994. The episode was selected for release in a 1997 video collection of selected episodes titled: The Simpsons: Crime and Punishment. Other episodes included in the collection set were \\"Marge in Chains\\", \\"Bart the Fink\\", and \\"You Only Move Twice\\". It was included in The Simpsons season five DVD set, The Simpsons - The Complete Fifth Season, which was released on December 21, 2004. Creator Matt Groening, supervising director David Silverman, and Mirkin appeared in the episode's audio commentary on the season five DVD. The episode was again included in the 2005 DVD release of the Crime and Punishment set. Cultural references David Niven (1950) The Molloy character is based on actor David Niven's performance as the character A. J. Raffles, a gentleman thief, in the 1939 film Raffles. The music heard at the beginning of the episode during the burglaries is taken from the film The Pink Panther, in which Niven played The Phantom, a similar character. Flanders tells Homer that his Shroud of Turin beach towels were stolen during one of the burglaries. Apu protects the Kwik-E mart with a rifle in a way similar to many of the images of Korean grocery store owners during the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Homer's dream of riding a nuclear bomb into oblivion is a reference to the famous scene from the film Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. Homer's line \\"So I said, Look buddy, your car was upside-down when I got here. And as for your grandma, she shouldn't have mouthed off like that!\\" is a reference to Flannery O'Connor's short story \\"A Good Man Is Hard to Find\\". The scene of Homer and Principal Skinner talking in front of the museum is a reference to a scene from the television series Dragnet. In a reference to the plot of the 1963 film It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, Molloy sends the residents of Springfield on a hunt for a treasure that is buried under a big letter. The ending sequence of the episode also references the film by using the same music and camera angles. In another scene that references It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, Bart tricks American actor Phil Silvers into driving his car into a river, just like Silvers's character did in the film.. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Homer the Vigilante\\" finished 41st in the ratings for the week of January 3‚Äì9, 1994, with a Nielsen rating of 12.2, equivalent to approximately 11.5 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought it was \\"a bit lacking in focus\\", but it contained \\"a number of satisfying set-pieces ‚Äî we like Professor Frink's walking house security system ‚Äî and displays Wiggum at his all-time most useless.\\" DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: \\"After the many plots of the prior show, 'Vigilante' maintains a much tighter focus. It‚Äôs not quite as wonderful an episode as its immediate predecessor, but it‚Äôs strong nonetheless. Much of the humor comes from Homer‚Äôs newfound power and abuse of it. If nothing else, it‚Äôs a great program due to Homer‚Äôs reaction to Lisa‚Äôs jug playing.\\" Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of B, and Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave it a score of 4 out of 5. Les Winan of Box Office Prophets named \\"Homer the Vigilante\\", \\"Cape Feare\\", \\"Homer Goes to College\\", \\"$pringfield\\", and \\"Deep Space Homer\\" his favorite episodes of season five. It was also the Liverpool Daily Post's Mike Chapple's favorite episode of the season together with \\"Bart Gets an Elephant\\" and \\"Burns' Heir\\".

In 2006, the United States Library of Congress deemed this film \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\", and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry, saying \\"the plot of a trek along the Oregon Trail is aided immensely by the majestic sweep provided by the experimental Grandeur wide-screen process used in filming\\". Plot A large caravan of settlers attempt to cross the Oregon Trail. Breck Coleman (John Wayne) is a young trapper who just got back to Missouri from his travels near Santa Fe, seeking to avenge the death of an old trapper friend who was killed the winter before along the Santa Fe Trail for his furs, by Red Flack (Tyrone Power, Sr.) and his minion Lopez (Charles Stevens). At a large trading post owned by a man named Wellmore, Coleman sees Flack and suspects him right away as being one of the killers. Flack likewise suspects Coleman as being somebody who knows too much about the killing. Coleman is asked by a large group of settlers to scout their caravan west, and declines, until he learns that Flack and Lopez were just hired by Wellmore to boss a bull train along the as-yet-unblazed Oregon Trail to a trading post in northern Oregon Territory (which at the time extended into current British Columbia), owned by another Missouri fur trader. Coleman agrees to scout for the train, so he can keep an eye on the villains and kill them as soon as they reach their destination. The caravan of settlers in their Prairie schooners would follow Wellmore's ox-drawn train of Conestoga Wagons, as the first major group of settlers to move west on the Oregon Trail. The film is set somewhere between 1837 and 1845.Ruth tells Honey Girl that there are 26 stars in the flag, dating the movie between Jan., 1837 and March 1845. This is historically accurate, as the first major wave of settlers on the Oregon Trail was in 1843, although the details were completely different. Coleman finds love with young Ruth Cameron (Marguerite Churchill), whom he'd kissed accidentally, mistaking her for somebody else. Unwilling to accept her attraction toward him, Ruth gets rather close to a gambler acquaintance of Flack's, Thorpe (Ian Keith), who joined the trail after being caught cheating. Coleman and Flack have to lead the settlers west, while Flack does everything he can to have Coleman killed before he finds any proof of what he'd done. The three villains' main reason for going west is to avoid the hangman's noose for previous crimes, and all three receive frontier justice instead. The settlers trail ends in an unnamed valley, where Coleman and Ruth finally settle down together amidst giant redwoods.

For the film, Walsh had employed 93 actors and used as many as 725 natives from five different Indian tribes. He also obtained 185 wagons, 1,800 cows, 1,400 horses, 500 buffalos and 700 chickens, pigs and dogs for the production of the film. Walsh offered the lead to actor Gary Cooper, who couldn't accept it. According to John Ford's later account, Walsh supposedly then asked Ford for casting suggestions, whereupon Ford recommended a then-unknown named John Wayne because he \\"liked the looks of this new kid with a funny walk, like he owned the world\\". When Wayne professed inexperience, Walsh told him to just \\"sit good on a horse and point\\". Walsh said that he initially saw Wayne, then a prop man, moving heavy furniture as though it were light as a feather, then decided to test him for the part. Almost a decade later, Ford began saying that he himself had discovered Wayne as a prop man when casting Stagecoach (1939), even though Wayne had played the lead in dozens of movies by then throughout the 1930s. Ford stuck to this obviously false story in interviews for the rest of his life. Filming on The Big Trail began on-location just outside Santa Fe, New Mexico in April 1930, which was unheard of at the time and quickly became very costly to the studio. Production The shoot lasted from April 20 to August 20, 1930 and was filmed in seven states. The film was shot in an early widescreen process called 70 mm Grandeur film, which was first used in the film Fox Movietone Follies of 1929. Grandeur was used by the Fox Film Corporation for a handful of films released in 1929 and 1930, of which The Big Trail was the last. Grandeur proved financially unviable for an industry still investing in the switch to talking pictures. The scene of the wagon train drive across the country was pioneering in its use of camera work and the depth and view of the epic landscape. An effort was made to lend authenticity to the movie, with the wagons drawn by oxen instead of horses ‚Äì they were lowered by ropes down canyons when necessary for certain shots in narrow valleys.\\"American Cinematographer Magazine\\" ‚Äì Volume 96 (April 2015). Article: \\"The Big Trail\\" Tyrone Power, Sr.'s character's clothing looks realistically grimy, and even the food supplies the 'immigrants' carried with them in their wagons were thoroughly researched. Locations in five states, starting from New Mexico to California, were used to film the caravan's trek.

It has a thunderstorm that looks as real as the land, water and sky that confront one throughout this production\\". According to Hall, in one sequence, featuring a native American attack, \\"suddenly it seems as though one were tugged from one's seat and thrown in front of the charging horses, which appear to plunge from the screen and disappear into the velvety darkness of the theatre\\". However, the movie became a box office bomb because it was released as a widescreen film during a time when theatres were unwilling to change their standard screens owing to cost. After completion of the film, Wayne was only cast in low-budget serials and features (mostly Poverty Row westerns); it took Wayne's role in Stagecoach (1939) for him to become an established performer. It would be over 20 years before the concept of widescreen films was revived. The two versions Beyond the format difference, the 70mm and 35mm versions vary substantially from each other. They were shot by different cameras, and footage for each format was edited separately in the cutting room. Some scenes were shot simultaneously by both cameras, the only difference being the angle (with the better angle usually given to the 70mm camera). Some scenes were shot first by one camera, and then retaken with the other camera. The 70mm cameras could not focus well up close, so their shots were mainly panoramas with very few close-ups. The 35mm cameras could move in and focus at short distances. Thus, scenes in the 70mm version might show two characters talking to each other in the same take, making greater use of the widescreen frame, while the 35mm version would have close- up shots cutting back and forth between the two characters. This may have been an artistic choice as much as a technical one. The cinematographer responsible for the 70mm version of the picture, Arthur Edeson, wrote in the September 1930 issue of American Cinematographer: \\"Grandeur reduces the number of close- ups considerably, as the figures are so much larger that semi-close-ups are usually all that is needed\\". In editing the films, some scenes were edited out for one version but allowed to remain in the other. The 35mm version was edited to be shorter, so many scenes in the 70mm version are not found in the 35mm. However, there are a few scenes in the 35mm version not found in the 70mm. The 35mm version was 108 minutes, but the 70mm was longer at 122 minutes. Critics views As 2018, Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an overall rating of 100%. Preservation and re-release A neglected film for many years, it was only seen in the conventional 35mm version for decades. In the early 1980s, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, which held the original 70mm nitrate camera negative, wished to preserve the film but found that nitrate decomposition had left it too shrunken and fragile to be copied to safety film, and that no film lab would touch it. Over a year-long project, Karl Malkames, a specialist in film restoration technology, designed and built a special printer to preserve this version of the film. The image on the original negative was transferred to 35mm anamorphic master. The printer copied at a speed of one frame a second, leading to the film's year-long process in preserving its original form. Dave Kehr wrote for the Chicago Tribune in 1988: \\"The added richness of resolution and the silvery sheen that the first generation 70 mm. nitrate prints would have provided can only be imagined. And yet, The Big Trail remains an eye-popping experience\\". Home video releases The 70mm version was finally seen on cable television in the late 1990s. The 35mm version had been released to VHS and DVD previously for several years. A two-disc restored DVD was released in the US on May 13, 2008 featuring the 35mm and the 70mm version. A Blu-ray edition featuring the 70mm version was released in September 2012. Foreign-language versions A fairly common practice in the early sound era was to simultaneously produce at least one foreign-language version of a film for release in non-English-speaking countries; an approach later replaced by simply dubbing the dialogue. There were at least four foreign-language versions made of The Big Trail, all filmed in 35mm, 1.20:1 ratio and using different casts and different character names: *French: La Piste des g√©ants (1931), directed by Pierre Couderc, starring Gaston Glass (Pierre Calmine), Jeanne Helbling (Denise Vernon), Margot Rousseroy (Yvette), Raoul Paoli (Flack), Louis Mercier (Lopez). *German: Die Gro√üe Fahrt (1931), directed by Lewis Seiler and Raoul Walsh, starring Theo Shall (Bill Coleman), Marion Lessing (Ruth Winter), Ullrich Haupt (Thorpe), Arnold Korff (Peter), Anders Van Haden (Bull Flack), Peter Erkelenz (Fichte), Paul Panzer (Lopez). *Italian: Il grande sentiero (1931), starring Franco Corsaro and Luisa Caselotti.Luisa Caselotti's younger sister, Adriana Caselotti, was the voice of Snow White in Walt Disney's animated classic Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). *Spanish: La Gran jornada (1931), directed by David Howard, Samuel Schneider, and Raoul Walsh, starring Jorge Lewis (Raul Coleman), Carmen Guerrero (Isabel Prados), Roberto Guzm√°n (Tomas), Martin Garralaga (Martin), Al Ernest Garcia (Flack), Tito Davison (Daniel), Carlos Villar√≠asVillar√≠as is best known for playing the title character in the Spanish-language version of Dr√°cula (1931).

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 24, 2002. In the episode, Marge decides to get liposuction, thinking that Homer does not find her attractive anymore. However, she accidentally receives breast implants, so she becomes adored by many men in Springfield and becomes a model. Meanwhile, Bart and Milhouse try to imitate a stunt they saw on an episode of Batman that guest starred Krusty the Clown. When the stunt ends badly, media watchdog groups blame Krusty, forcing the clown to make his show more safety-conscious and less fun. Plot Lisa and Homer make a bet on who won the 1948 presidential election. Lisa wins and she gets to choose the activity for Daddy-Daughter Day. Her activity is taking part in building homes for a Habitat for Humanity alongside Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and George H. W. Bush, whose relationship mirrors that of the Three Stooges. While painting, Homer takes off his wedding ring (which actually is a Band-Aid with tin foil wrapped around it, as Homer's real wedding band was swallowed by a turtle) in order not to get paint on it, and Lindsay Naegle and Cookie Kwan mistakenly think Homer is a bachelor. Marge, driving by with Maggie, sees Homer appearing to flirt with the women by flexing his muscles (though he is actually acting out Marge going into labor with Bart). Marge worries that Homer has lost interest in her, so she decides to get liposuction, on the advice of Manjula. Unfortunately, a mix-up causes her to get breast implants, which were intended for one of Mayor Quimby's female interns. The doctor says that Marge must wait for 48 hours before the implants can be removed. Meanwhile, Bart and Milhouse watch an episode of Batman, featuring Krusty as a villain named Clownface, who threatens Batman and Robin with a rapidly spinning carousel of death. Bart and Milhouse like the idea, inspiring them to recreate the stunt, with Bart putting Milhouse on a merry-go-round in school. Otto uses the bus to kick- start the merry-go-round, spinning it at an incredible speed. The bolts give way and the merry-go-round goes flying through the air, knocking over the school flag. Milhouse vomits on the flag while Iwo Jima veterans are visiting the school. As Principal Skinner catches Bart for it, Bart confessed that he and Milhouse saw Krusty do the stunt on television. In response, Skinner leads a group protesting against Krusty, who is now seen as a dangerous influence to children. Krusty's show is revamped to exclude anything considered dangerous and likely to be imitated by impressionable viewers (to the point that Krusty's monkey sidekick, Mr. Teeny, has to be sent back to the wild). After coming home from her surgery, Marge realizes that her breasts are making her life difficult in doing even the simplest tasks. Marge tries to hide her breasts from her family, but Homer and the children find out Marge's secret after a few short hours. Marge and her family go out for dinner to the local Italian restaurant. Luigi, who had just rejected Ned Flanders, immediately admits the Simpson family. Kiki Highsmith, a trade show executive, approaches Marge and offers her a modeling job. Marge accepts and initially enjoys the experience, but is soon plagued by backaches and many men in Springfield sexually harassing her. At the Springfield Shoe Expo, Marge is further humiliated and objectified by lustful men while promoting shoe horns. At the same time, Bart helps Krusty to win back his popularity, using Milhouse and Stampy, Bart's pet elephant, in a stunt. The stunt quickly goes out of control when Stampy stuffs both Milhouse and Bart in his mouth. Homer tries to save them, but also gets stuffed into Stampy's mouth. Krusty forgets the word that was supposed to make Stampy submit and lie down. The police decide to shoot at Stampy, which would endanger Homer, Bart and Milhouse. Marge appears on the scene, and after unsuccessfully trying to dissuade the police shooting (as Chief Wiggum claims that they do not negotiate with elephants), distracts the police by flashing her breasts to the assembled crowd. Krusty, still despised by residents of Springfield, saves the day when he remembers Stampy's safety word \\"Magumbo\\" after accidentally saying it while ogling Marge's breasts. Stampy releases Bart, Milhouse, and Homer, and Krusty is hailed as a hero and his popularity is restored with the town (though the story of how Krusty saved the kids is relegated to only a paragraph in the local paper while the story of Marge flashing the crowd at the shoe expo received 26 pages with photos). In the end, Marge has the implants removed. Production \\"Large Marge\\" was written by Ian Maxtone-Graham and directed by Jim Reardon as part of the fourteenth season of The Simpsons (2002‚Äì03). In an Associated Press news report about the episode, it was cited as satirizing \\"plastic surgery and images of beauty in popular culture.\\" Actors Adam West and Burt Ward, who starred in the television series Batman as Batman and Robin, respectively, guest starred in \\"Large Marge\\" as those characters. Junkanoo band Baha Men, known for their single \\"Who Let the Dogs Out?\\", recorded a parody of that song for this episode titled \\"Who Let Her Jugs Out?\\". It plays over the closing credits. Release The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 24, 2002. On February 7, 2006, \\"Large Marge\\" was released in the United States on a DVD collection titled The Simpsons Kiss and Tell: The Story of Their Love, along with the season nine episode \\"Natural Born Kissers\\", the season fourteen episode \\"Three Gays of the Condo\\", and the season fifteen episode \\"The Way We Weren't\\". All four episodes revolve around the romance between Homer and Marge. On December 6, 2011, \\"Large Marge\\" was released on Blu-ray and DVD as part of the box set The Simpsons ‚Äì The Complete Fourteenth Season. Staff members Al Jean, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Matt Selman, Tom Gammill, Matt Warburton, David Silverman, and Mike B. Anderson, as well as cast member Nancy Cartwright, participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also included in the box set. Reviews from television critics about this episode have been mixed since the release of the Kiss and Tell DVD. IGN's Jeff Otto commented that while he thought \\"Natural Born Kissers\\" was the only \\"great\\" episode in the compilation, \\"All four episodes are good Simpsons episodes.\\" He added: \\"I can't figure why, if Fox was going to put together a set of this theme, they couldn't have included some of the more classic episodes about Marge and Homer's romance. Still, even the lesser Simpsons episodes are entertaining, so you could certainly do worse.\\" A writer for HorrorNews.net called it one of the highlights of the season, and Aaron Peck of High-Def Digest described it as \\"memorable\\". DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that though \\"the plot of 'Large' screams 'high concept', it actually works pretty well. It uses the silliness attached to Marge's chest to good comic effect, and the secondary plot with Bart and Krusty ties into things in a fun manner. It presents a lot of funny bits and turns into a strong episode. It's also hard to knock a show that reunites the voices of Adam West and Burt Ward.\\" While reviewing the fourteenth season of The Simpsons, Victor Valdivia of DVD Verdict wrote: \\"To be sure, there are some real clinkers this season. Both 'Large Marge' and 'Strong Arm of the Ma' prove that writing good episodes about Marge seem to be out of the question by this point. [...] By normal TV standards these are not unwatchable, but by Simpsons standards, these are the episodes you probably won't watch over and over again.\\" ReferencesExternal links *\\"Large Marge\\" at The Simpsons.com * * Category:The Simpsons (season 14) episodes Category:2002 American television episodes Category:Cultural depictions of Bill Clinton Category:Cultural depictions of George H.

Tembo comes from the Dedza District in central Malawi, and he is a teacher by profession. Beginning in the 1960s he was an important politician in Malawi, and he was a key figure in the regime of Hastings Banda (1964-1994). He has been variously described as \\"physically slight, ascetic, fastidious\\" and \\"cunning\\".Malawian historian David Dudwa Phiri He was replaced as President of the MCP in August 2013. Early career Tembo was born on September 14, 1932 in Dedza District, Central Region. His father, Zenus Ungapake Tembo, was a minister of the Church of Central African Presbyterian (CCAP). He attended several primary schools before graduating to Blantyre Secondary School. He later went to study at the University of Roma (also known as Pius XII College) in Lesotho, graduating in 1958 with a Bachelor of Arts in political philosophy. He had a brief stint as a teacher at Dedza Secondary School and later taught for two years at Robert Blake Secondary School in the central region district of Dowa in 1958. In 1960, two years after Dr. Banda's arrival in the country from Ghana to lead the independence struggle from the British colonial rule, Tembo was invited to take up a parliamentary seat in Dedza South constituency. Tembo was elected to the legislative assembly of Nyasaland in 1961, three years before the country gained its independence and became the Republic of Malawi. He was the second Minister of Finance in Malawi after independence, succeeding Henry Phillips (later Sir Henry Phillips) in a post for which the intended candidate had been Dunduzu Chisiza (Chisiza died in 1962 in a car crash). John Tembo was the only cabinet member not to resign in the notorious Cabinet Crisis of 1964, after which most of the President's closest lieutenants, their opposition to his policies thwarted, fled the country. (Chinua Achebe in A Man of the People admits having used a real situation gleaned from the Hansards of a certain African country to portray his main character 'Chief Nanga', the heckler in parliament who hounded out the 'offensive minister' who had just resigned.) Relationship with Banda He was prone to taking some unilateral decisions, e.g. the '1974 Youth Week Inauguration' venue saga when Tembo decided, without Banda's permission, to stage the event in Lilongwe to coincide with the 'New Capital City' inauguration gala Banda had yet to sanction. Banda found this offensive and in the presence of Gwanda Chakuamba dressed down Tembo before instructing Chakuamba to rearrange, at a very high cost to the government, the Youth Week inauguration back in Blantyre. Despite Cecilia Kadzamira's intervention, Banda proceeded to remove John Tembo from the National Celebrations Council and placed him into a minor post of Reserve Bank Governor and the ceremonial Chairman of the University Council. The Banda-Tembo relationship soured and it became an uphill struggle, with Cecilia's active support, for Tembo to regain his position of prominence. His role as the Chichewa interpreter to Banda was engineered so that John Tembo stayed in Banda's presence. Cecilia engineered the removal as interpreter and subsequent demise in disgrace of the eloquent Chichewa speaking John Msonthi; whereupon on Msonthi's burial day a gun battle ensued between the Msonthi and Tembo/ Kadzamira clans. And when John Tembo suggested, during one of Dr. Banda's speech on ubiquitous and 'invisible enemies', that ministers and those around the President should carry automatic weapons to 'defend' Dr. Banda, John Tembo was swiftly rapped on the wrist and a temporary replacement interpreter was arranged. Tembo meeting Barbara Castle, British Minister for Overseas Development, circa 1965 When Malawi became a republic in 1966 after attaining independence in 1964, Tembo was appointed as Minister of Finance. In 1971, at the Dowa MCP Convention, Tembo was the 'primary' sponsor (while another two seconded) for Banda becoming the 'Life President' of Malawi. Banda rewarded him with postgraduate studies in central banking in Britain and France. Later he was to use the knowledge as Governor of the Reserve Bank of Malawi, a post he held for 13 years. As confidante to the President, Tembo was used as Dr. Banda's Machiavellian bludgeon during the later part of Dr. Banda's 30-year tyrannical rule. Tembo came to personify the negatives that Dr. Banda did. The greater majority in Malawi came to hate John Tembo for the excesses that ideally should have been aimed at Dr. Banda. While most people became resigned to the 'life presidency' issue (wait until the old man departs), a determination, especially after the Mwanza Assassination, emerged that Tembo would 'never rule' Malawi. Yet, in a move demonstrating Banda embraced 'democracy' much earlier than portrayed, Banda released John Tembo from his duties as Governor of the Reserve Bank and sent him on a two-year sabbatical to the US Congress to study the workings of democracy. When John Tembo returned in 1989, Banda appointed him as Minister without Portfolio much to the furore and greater agitation for multiparty democracy. With Banda's health failing Cecilia Tamanda Kadzamira turned more to Tembo to do her low-key political bidding. In turn, John Tembo unleashed onto Malawians what Banda was to later call the 'parallel MCP'. Sections of the Secret Service, Malawi Young Pioneers and other agencies, loyal to John Tembo, systematically incarcerated and/or summarily killed any vocal opposition to his rise to power while the educated, especially those without links to John Tembo's 'Dedza-Ntakataka Connection' were dispatched into exile. Yet, the Machiavelli Dr. Banda did not fully relinquish power. Given a choice between Tembo and Gwanda Chakuamba, Banda anointed Chakuamba as his running mate in Malawi's first multiparty elections, held on 17 May 1994. In January 1995, some months after Banda lost the election to Bakili Muluzi of the United Democratic Front (UDF), Tembo and \\"Mama\\" were put on trial for the murder of the four prominent Malawi politicians in 1983 (the so-called Mwanza trial). While there was little doubt that the four politicians had met their violent end (also allegedly in a \\"car crash\\") at the hands of state security forces, there was no direct evidence linking the accused to the murders and they were acquitted. After Banda's death in 1997, Tembo attempted to take over the presidency of the Malawi Congress Party from Chakuamba and defied a high court injunction preventing him from holding a convention to do so. Because the high court ruled him in contempt, he was expelled from the legislative assembly, although he successfully challenged the expulsion. Using the parallel MCP mechanisms, John Tembo finally wrested control of the MCP from Gwanda Chakuamba. 2004 election As the candidate of the MCP, Tembo officially placed second, with 27% of the vote, in the presidential election held on May 20, 2004, behind the winner, UDF candidate Bingu wa Mutharika, and ahead of Chakuamba, who ran as the candidate of the Mgwirizano Coalition.Elections in Malawi, African Elections Database. On August 28, 2007, Tembo rejected an appeal from Chakuamba for Tembo to become the running mate of Muluzi, the UDF's candidate, in the 2009 election. Tembo said that the MCP would have its own campaign and would not participate in a coalition.Daniel Nyirenda, \\"I can‚Äôt be No. 2 --JZU\\" , The Daily Times, August 29, 2007.\\"Malawi groups fail to agree on poll candidate\\", AFP, August 29, 2007. 2009 presidential election On November 1, 2008, Tembo was unanimously elected as the MCP's 2009 presidential candidate at the MCP National Convention held at the Natural Resources College in Lilongwe. Tembo was to face President Mutharika, who was running for a second term as the candidate of the newly formed Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Tembo was considered the main opposition candidate, and the MCP formed an electoral alliance with Muluzi and the UDF prior to the election; the old foes came together with the goal of defeating Mutharika, their mutual enemy.\\"Malawi president accuses donors of meddling in polls\\", Agence France- Presse, 8 May 2009. Tembo's vice-presidential candidate was Brown Mpinganjira of the UDF.Raphael Tenthani, \\"John Tembo: Poised for power?\\", BBC News, 14 May 2009. Observing that the DPP had never participated in an election (it was founded in 2005), Tembo argued that he and the MCP had the experience to govern the country properly: \\"I belong to the past, I belong to the present and I also belong to the future.\\"Raphael Tenthani, \\"Malawians go to polls Tuesday in closest-ever polls\\" , Panapress, 17 May 2009. Observers expected a close election between the two strongest candidates, Mutharika and Tembo. While Tembo enjoyed the united backing of the country's two most established and powerful parties--the MCP and the UDF--he faced an incumbent President who had presided over strong economic growth of 8%, and the outcome was considered uncertain. Ultimately, Mutharika won an overwhelming victory in the election, according to official results, and Tembo alleged fraud. Afterwards, some in the MCP called for the party to recognize Mutharika's victory and for Tembo to resign as MCP President. Tembo refused and vowed to legally challenge the results.\\"Malawi opposition leader refuses to step down\\" , Radio Netherlands, 24 May 2009. He was re-elected as the MP for Dedza South in the concurrent parliamentary election. The MCP's strength in parliament was seriously reduced in the election, as it retained only 25 MPs, while Mutharika's DPP secured a large majority of seats; nevertheless, the MCP remained the second largest party in the National Assembly. When Tembo was sworn in again as an MP on June 2, 2009, he vowed that he would continue as Leader of the Opposition during the 2009-2014 parliamentary term, despite apparently substantial dissent within the MCP.\\"Tembo sworn in as MP\\", Nyasa Times, June 2, 2009.

Beach  Itacoatiara beach is located about 30 minutes east of downtown Niter√≥i by car, or one hour by bus. Itacoatiara is a beach with fine golden sands and bright blue (sometimes green) water. The main beach is open to the Atlantic Ocean and is dangerous for the casual swimmer while offering ideal conditions for water sports. The left side of the beach ends with a rock face called Cost√£o, and there is a wave-sheltered small beach on the right side called Prainha (little beach), which is separated from the main beach by a big rock that serves as its shelter, and which is frequented by small children and their parents. = Surfing = The place is famous for offering the ideal conditions for the practices of surfing, bodysurfing and bodyboarding during most of the year. At Itacoatiara, the Atlantic Ocean produces fast and hollow waves, usually ranging from 3 to 6 feet, but on frequent occasions they might swell up to 4 meters (12 feet). A few times per year a huge southeast swell can produce larger waves of up to 5 meters (15 feet) but a swell that strong rarely offers acceptable surfing conditions. There are three main beach breaks in the beach. They are named Cost√£o (on the left side), Meio (middle) and Pampo (on the right side), each breaking differently depending on swell direction and size. Behind the limiting rock between the main beach and the small, wave-sheltered Prainha (little beach), there is a point break named Shock due to its extremely dangerous surfing conditions, with rocks protruding from the sea floor above the water level. Shock starts working on bigger swells. = Climbing = Itacoatiara is a place especially appreciated by the climbers and offers many routes of different climbing styles. Bouldering is practiced at the square commonly called \\"Pracinha\\". The Serra da Tiririca State Park is also located there and was recognised by UNESCO as a World Biosphere Reserve. It offers many climbing routes of abseiling and of the following different styles: traditional climbing, sport climbing and aid climbing.

The first of these is a powerful sorceress with the real name of Amora; she is one of Thor's greatest enemies. The second Enchantress is the young Sylvie Lushton, who was given great mystic powers by Loki when he created her as a tool for chaos. She models herself after the original Enchantress, Amora. Publication history Amora's first appearance in the Marvel Universe took place in Journey into Mystery #103 (April 1964), where she tried and failed to seduce Thor away from Jane Foster. The second Enchantress, Sylvie, first appeared in Dark Reign: Young Avengers #1 (July 2009), where she was confronted by the Young Avengers. Fictional character biography The Enchantress' parentage is unknown, though it is known she was born in Asgard and has a sister by the name of Lorelei. Amora began learning magic as an apprentice of Karnilla, Queen of the Norns, but was eventually banished. She continued learning magic on her own, notably by seducing others well versed in magic and learning their secrets. In time, Amora became one of the more powerful magic-wielders in Asgard, with her magical arsenal focused on (but not limited to) charming and mind-controlling people. Her by-then well-renowned beauty did not hinder in this. In her first appearance, she is sent by Odin to eliminate Thor's human love interest, whom Odin sees as a distraction. She also hopes to have the thunder god for herself. She is assisted by a powerful minion ‚Äî Skurge, the Executioner. The Executioner loved the Enchantress, and she strings him along with her feminine wiles, using him as her muscle. She aids Loki by attempting to seduce Thor in his Don Blake identity and by sending the Executioner to kill Jane Foster, but though the Executioner traps Foster in another dimension Thor is able to bring her back by giving Skurge his hammer. When the Enchantress, angry at Skurge returning Jane, begins to turn Skurge into a tree, Skurge releases Thor from the pact in exchange for his help. Amora then tries to change Thor's hammer into a hissing serpent, but it is immune to her magic. Thor then transports the two back to Asgard.Journey Into Mystery #103. Marvel Comics. The Enchantress and the Executioner are exiled to Earth by Odin. They become members of Baron Heinrich Zemo's original Masters of Evil, the opposite number to the Avengers, a superhero team that Thor had joined. The Enchantress hypnotizes Thor into attacking the other Avengers with her own spells and a special brew, making him believe they are enemies of humanity, but Iron Man wakes Thor from his trance by reflecting sunlight into his eyes. Thor sends the Masters to another dimension through a space warp, but two issues later, the Enchantress uses a spell to send them back to Earth. She recruits Wonder Man into the Masters of Evil after paying his bail. She also meets Immortus, who helps Zemo attack the Avengers. When this attempt fails, she turns back time to prevent it from happening, though the Masters retain their memories of this event. When Immortus begins to contact the Masters, the Enchantress prevents this from happening.Avengers #7, 9-10. Marvel Comics. She then joins in the Masters of Evil's final assault against the Avengers and breaks the Black Knight and Melter out of jail. She manages to escape in the end with the Executioner when the other two are transported to another dimension where their weapons rebound due to different scientific laws.Avengers #15-16. Marvel Comics. As a member of the Masters of Evil, the Enchantress (and Executioner) repeatedly face the Avengers. She is especially affronted by the attempts of the Scarlet Witch, a mortal, to subvert her divine spells, though she is occasionally genuinely challenged by the Scarlet Witch's mutant gifts. Art by Alan Davis. With the Executioner, she menaces Jane Foster again at Loki's behest.Journey Into Mystery #116-117. Marvel Comics. The Enchantress is also notable in that she has given other superhumans their powers. For example, she used the deceased Zemo's equipment to make a henchman of his, Erik Josten, into the original Power Man, who aids her in battling the Avengers. Her illusions and traps turn the city against the Avengers, forcing them to disband and making Power Man seem like a hero. Captain America, in disguise, corrects this by obtaining a taped confession from the Enchantress and Power Man. Power Man is able to defeat him, but the Enchantress is knocked out by gas from Hawkeye's arrow. Realizing the tape is on its way to the police, the Enchantress used her spells to teleport away.Avengers #21-22. Marvel Comics. The Enchantress is then recruited by the Mandarin, along with the Executioner, Swordsman, Power Man, and Living Laser for his plan for world domination. With the Executioner, she attacked the Asian sub-continent with an army of trolls, but they were defeated by Hercules and the Scarlet Witch.Avengers Annual #1. Marvel Comics. Amora poses as the Valkyrie and forms the Lady Liberators, which battle the male Avengers. She dupes Arkon into fighting the Avengers.Avengers #83-84. Marvel Comics. Amora also uses her magics to make Samantha Parrington and later Barbara Norris into the Valkyrie.Defenders #4. Marvel Comics. With the Executioner, she battles the Defenders and the Thing.Marvel Two-in-One #7; Defenders #20. Marvel Comics. With the Executioner, Amora attempts to conquer Asgard with a troll army. She also served as Loki's lieutenant in his brief rule of Asgard.Thor #258-261, 263-265. Marvel Comics. During the \\"Secret Wars,\\" she is placed on the villains's side, but she spurns the idea of fighting a gladiatorial game for the amusement of a higher being. She instead proposes to Thor that the two of them simply join forces, leave both heroes and villains behind, and go back home to Asgard. On the appearance of Amora's sister Lorelei, it is established that the two sisters have something of a strained relationship, rooted in rivalry. More than a little friction is seen between the pair, not the least due to competition over which one of them would manage to seduce Thor.Thor #350. Marvel Comics. The Enchantress joined the Asgardian gods and heroes in final battle against the world-ender Surtur. She establishes that she is motivated by enlightened self-interest: Surtur seeks to end the world, in which case Amora would perish.Thor #350, 352-353. Marvel Comics. Another regular foe of Amora's is the Scarlet Witch, as seen here in The Vision and the Scarlet Witch (Vol. 2) #9. Cover art by Richard Howell and right Soon after the Surtur War, Thor leads a number of Asgardian heroes to Hel, the realm of the death goddess Hela. The Executioner asks Thor to let him join the expedition for reasons he does not immediately reveal. In truth, he had seen the Enchantress dallying with Heimdall, and, heartbroken, Skurge wishes to lose himself in a noble cause ‚Äî such as rescuing lost souls from Hela. Thor's forces accomplish their mission but need one man to guard their retreat from Hel by holding the bridge Gjallerbru. The Executioner, knowing there was no more Amora for him, chooses to be that man, giving his life so the others might flee. When Amora hears the news, to everyone's surprise, she is truly grief-stricken.Thor #371. Marvel Comics. After Skurge's death, Amora continues her regular hi-jinks, occasionally helping Asgard, occasionally opposing it. She aids Asgard against the evil Egyptian God Seth's legions.Thor #393-398-400. Marvel Comics. Lorelei later perishes as Amora refused to give her life for her sister's. The deceased Skurge (in Valhalla) rejects the Enchantress, and Amora goes on to empower the Earthman Brute Benhurst into a short-lived new Executioner to serve as her minion in Skurge's stead.Thor #402-403. Marvel Comics. Amora becomes vexed with the Avenger Wonder Man and assists Thor and the Warriors Three in their quest to return Odin to the throne of Asgard. During this time, an attraction between Amora and Asgard's guardian Heimdall is explored. Amora even battles the powerful entity Nightmare on behalf of both of them as Heimdall was unable to protect himself at the time. She ultimately rejects Heimdall when she realizes that he wishes to be married and she does not. In Acts of Vengeance, Amora and Skurge join forces and attack Doctor Strange, only to be bested by Clea when she flies to his aid. Later, Thor has been spurned by his father Odin, exiled to Earth and disempowered. In this vulnerable state, Thor ends up forming a willing liaison with Amora, with the two of them living out of a loft in New York City as lovers. This status quo would remain until Thor goes missing during Heroes Reborn and is presumed dead.Thor #491-494. Marvel Comics. During Ragnar√∂k, Amora is present with the other Asgardian deities and dwarves when Eitri and his brothers are sealed into a tomb they had carved due to the Mjolnir mold destroying them, albeit accidentally. When Surtur's forging of new Mjolnirs creates chaos, Thor attempts to fly to the skies to discern the source, but is at once struck down by a blast from a Mjolnir duplicate of Loki's; Amora is slain by the same blast, one of the first victims of Loki during this event. Neither her magic nor her inherent durability is capable of shielding her. Heimdall falls soon afterward; Amora is not seen again except, seemingly, in one of the realms of death, unable to use her magic to assist her once-lover. After Ragnar√∂k, when Thor, Asgard and the other Asgardians return, Thor is manipulated by Loki into inadvertently awakening some of Thor's enemies, among them Amora, though when she was last seen, she is the victim, falling by Loki's hands and mourned by Thor and the other Asgardians. She does not return to Asgard but instead goes to attack the world tree, Yggdrasil in order to resurrect Skurge and release him from Valhalla. Amora is ultimately thwarted after Thor, Loki, and Balder convince her that she is dishonoring his memory with her actions.Thor: God-Sized Special #1. Marvel Comics. She has returned after Thor's resurrection, with Donald Blake - bitter about his separation from Thor and his non-existent past - offering the Enchantress his soul if she can make him a god again.The Mighty Thor #13. Marvel Comics. The resulting god is a twisted abomination, with Thor defeating the Enchantress and her new god before banishing them from Asgard, leaving Blake - reduced to a living head after his body was consumed to create the god - connected to a series of dream-weaving creatures to make him dream that he is living a full life.The Mighty Thor #17. Marvel Comics. After this Amora was defeated by Thor and banished to the forest in Norway. She was trapped in an Odinforce barrier and stripped of her powers. Lady Deathstrike and Typhoid Mary were on a quest to find Arkea, an intelligent gestalt microorganism capable of controlling machines and people. They found Amora and offered to help her regain her powers.\\"X-Men\\" Vol. 4 #8. Marvel Comics. In exchange they founded a new sisterhood to battle the X-Men, who were hunting Arkea and Lady Deathstrike. Arkea hacked the Odinforce spell and restored Amora's full powers. In exchange for this, Amora restored the physical form of the immortal mutant witch, Selene,\\"X-Men\\" Vol. 4 #11. Marvel Comics. and helped Arkea resurrect Madelyne Pryor. Before the Sisterhood could add more members, the X-Men attacked and killed Arkea. Amora was ambushed by the X-Man M, who defeated her in a surprise attack. However, Madelyne Pryor swore to continue the Sisterhood, which presently has Madelyne, Selene, Lady Deathstrike, Amora, and Typhoid Mary as members.\\"X-Men\\" Vol. 4 #12. Marvel Comics.

The new Enchantress is revealed to be an adolescent who had been given powers by Loki so that he could use her in his schemes.Dark Reign: Young Avengers #4. Marvel Comics. However, she truly believes that she is an Asgardian that had been exiled from Asgard and sent to live in New York where she joined the Young Masters. She admits to the first team of Young Avengers that she is Sylvie Lushton from Broxton, Oklahoma, who suddenly gained magic powers.Dark Reign: Young Avengers #3. Marvel Comics. Sylvie seems to have powers and abilities similar to those of the original Enchantress, despite looking far younger, and speaking with a noticeable lisp.Dark Reign: Young Avengers #1. Marvel Comics. Sylvie has a strong desire to become a Young Avenger and even used her magic to change her teammates' minds so that they would want her on the team as well.Dark Reign: Young Avengers #2. Marvel Comics. After a series of try-outs, Sylvie is initially accepted as a new addition to the Young Avengers. However, as a plan to end Sylvie's future with the Young Avengers, her teammates Big Zero and Egghead download the results of an analysis they had run on her into the Vision's cybernetic mind. The analysis verifies that Sylvie is an unwitting trap for the Young Avengers' magical defense systems created by Loki and Wiccan immediately has her banned from the Young Avengers' hideout. A distraught and confused Sylvie then asks her teammates to avenge her, eventually resulting in a confrontation between the two teams and Norman Osborn's team of Dark Avengers. During the conflict, Wiccan reveals to her that she was given magical powers by Loki. However, he states that the team still wants her, but that her hasty banning was only to quickly remove her from the premises so that he could alter the magical defenses to compensate for Loki's traps. Convinced by Wiccan that being an Avenger is about who one chooses to be despite one's origins, she, Coat of Arms, and Wiccan manage to magically remove the Sentry from the battlefield and turn the tide of the fight against the Young Masters and the Dark Avengers. Melter requests a quick escape so that they can have more time to decide what they will choose to do as either superheroes or supervillains, and Sylvie complies, teleporting the Young Masters away.Dark Reign; Young Avengers #5.

Powers and abilities The Enchantress is a member of the race of superhumans known as Asgardians, and as such possesses superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and durability but prefers to avoid physical conflicts. She possesses an innate capacity to manipulate ambient magical energy, honed through practice for a variety of effects, including projecting magical power bolts, interdimensional teleportation of multiple Asgardians and non- Asgardians, protective energy shields, illusions, levitation, conjuring, transmutation (even of Asgardians), telekinesis, time-disruption, mind switching, and mind control. She has used her sorcery to enhance her natural beauty and allure, and to enchant her lips so that by kissing virtually any man she can make him her slave for about a week, unless she renews the treatment. She can also use her magic to heal any of her injuries rapidly, and possesses limited mystical senses. She can also absorb an opponent's life force to temporarily increase her own powers. A prolonged absence from Asgard tends to diminish her powers although they never fade completely. The Enchantress has been described as one of the most powerful sorceresses in Asgard, second only to Karnilla,New Mutants Special Edition; X-Men Annual #9; Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Deluxe Edition #4. Marvel Comics. although their every direct confrontation has ended in a stalemate until interrupted.The mighty Thor v.1, #260, #450, #455. Marvel Comics. However, Amora's sister Lorelei was later also enhanced beyond her own abilities.Journey Into Mystery #509-511 (May-Aug. 1997); Defenders vol.2, #4 (2001). Marvel Comics. The Enchantress has a gifted intellect, and possesses extensive knowledge of Asgardian mystic and amatory arts. On occasion, the Enchantress employs various mystical artifacts, potions, and power objects, such as the crystalline gem in which she entrapped Brunnhilde the Valkyrie's soul, and the potion she used to increase her hypnotic power over Thor in Avengers #7. It has been shown that Enchantress is unable to access her spells when her hands are bound and her mouth is gagged.Journey Into Mystery #504 (1996). Marvel Comics. Initially unbeknownst to her, Enchantress II's powers are given to her by Loki. Wiccan states that she may not fully understand how powerful she truly is. Her powers and abilities appear similar to those of the original Enchantress. She is able to teleport many people instantly, maintain a secret fortress with her magic, and transform objects and people into whatever she desires, such as turning several henchmen into frogs. She also demonstrated power enough to stop both the Young Avengers and Young Masters during their battle and separate them. Connection to Norse mythology Unlike many of Marvel's Asgardians, Amora is not actually based on a goddess from Norse mythology. In the limited series Thor: Ages of Thunder the Enchantress is said to have been referred to by many names throughout history including; Freyja, Gefn and Iduna, and is linked to many of the myths associated with these goddesses (i.e. as keeper of the golden apples).Thor: Ages of Thunder #1. Marvel Comics. However, these stories were set during previous cycles of Ragnarok and characters based on some of these goddesses (FreyaMarvel Super Heroes vol. 2, #15 (1993). Marvel Comics. and IdunnJourney Into Mystery, #114 (Mar 1965). Marvel Comics.) exist separately in the current Marvel Universe.

Early life and education Rosen grew up in Forest Hills, Queens, New York. He attended Cornell University and later Queens College, where he received a bachelor's degree in computer science. He later received his master's degree in the same subject from Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey, while working at Bell Labs and later at Bellcore. 1980s - Bell Labs and Usenet While at Bell Labs and Bellcore (now known as Telcordia Technologies) during the 1980s, Rosen was a lead engineer on the team that beta-tested IBM's then brand-new DB2 relational database management system, which would become one of the first commercially available relational database systems on the market. He also developed one of the earliest online bulletin board systems used to keep telephone operating companies informed about Bell System software standards. He also acquired a reputation there as a high-volume poster to Usenet newsgroups. The volume of Usenet postings he produced led to rumors that many people were actually using his account, or that he was an AI program produced by Bell Labs to increase the amount of Usenet traffic and thus augment AT&T;'s long distance telephone revenues.Reference to quoted article about Rich Rosen by Tom Richardson Weekly statistics collected during his heyday often showed that he, by himself, was responsible for more than 2% of the entire volume of Usenet postings. The phrase \\"We are all Rich Rosen\\" was coined during this period and persisted as a Usenet catchphrase for a number of years. Rosen posted in a number of newsgroups on a variety of topics, most particularly music and religion. Among his contributions: * Rich Rosen's Rules of Netnews Debating, a satirical post intended not so much as a set of guidelines to follow when posting, but rather as a statement (like Godwin's Law) about the irrational and often obnoxious behavior often observed in Usenet discussions (which Rosen himself admittedly engaged in). * The Book of Ubizmo and the religion of Ubizmatism, a parody of the extremes associated with mainstream organized religions. * The story of Toejam Jawallaby, a fictitious musician who was the winner of several bogus \\"greatest guitarist of all time\\" polls, whose exploits were later expanded upon in the newsgroup rec.music.jazz. * Several musical compositions that appeared on the first Usenet compilation tape, a little net.music (1985), including A Fair Exchange and Vegetableland (which was ostensibly performed by the aforementioned Toejam Jawallaby). * Several Usenet April Fool's jokes, including the (now doubly ironic) \\"Microsoft Windows for the Macintosh\\" and the \\"Olfactory Transfer Protocol\\" (WebOdor). He was known for participating in (some would say \\"inciting\\") numerous flame wars with other Usenet contributors, including the notorious Brahms Gang, a pair of equally loquacious mathematics graduate students from Berkeley (Gene W. Smith and Matthew P. Wiener) who posted from a server named \`brahms.berkeley.edu\`. His verbal battles with the Brahms Gang in particular were sometimes referred to as \\"The War of the Rosens\\". He was also known for his variety of frequently- changing .signature files, including: * Anything's possible, but only a few things actually happen.Misquoted in Bill Jefferys' book Discovering Astronomy as \\"Many things are possible, but only a few things actually happen.\\" * Life is complex. It has real and imaginary parts.Often attributed to others including Gregory Benford but originating with Rosen on Usenet in 1985 * Look for significance where there's none intended, and you'll surely find it. * Now I've lost my train of thought, I'll have to catch the bus of thought. * echo \\"This is not a pipe.\\"  cat - >/dev/ttyA pun on Magritte's famous painting as applied to pipes in the Unix shell. =Usenet Citations and Acknowledgements= The volume and content of Rosen's postings evoked strong reactions in both advocates and detractors. People either praised him for his postings or denounced him as a threat to the future of Usenet. * His voluminous output and frequently abrasive postings led many to seek his removal from the net. He was never actually banned, censored or otherwise prevented from posting, but his e-mail address was used on the man page for the netnews \\"expire\\" command as an example of how this command could be used to delete all postings from a particular user. The use of his address in this manner was viewed by some as an endorsement of censorship and it was eventually removed. * His notoriety also led Howard Rheingold to use his name in A Slice of Life in My Virtual Community (an article propagated through its inclusion in the Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet) as an example of how people use kill files: *: ... putting the name of a person or topic header in a \`\`kill file (aka \`\`bozo filter) means you will never see future contributions from that person or about that topic. You can simply choose to not see any postings from Rich Rosen, or that feature the word \`\`abortion in the title. * A column by Mr. Protocol (Michael O'Brien) in Sun Expert magazine (now called Server/Workstation Expert) used the word \\"Rosenesque\\" to describe a person who produces a substantial volume of e-mail messages large enough to overwhelm a local network. * The Net.Legends FAQ says: *: How can a Net.Legends list omit Rich Rosen? I think he still holds the record for amount of spontaneous, germane text in a single newsgroup (net.philosophy). * In contrast, one system administrator wrote an article entitled \\"Proposed deletion of Rich Rosen\\": *: If net.bizarre and net.flame were threats to the network's continued existence, then Rich Rosen is doubly so. ... Rich Rosen's volume is enormous. His postings comprise two percent of the network's volume. ... Expressed as a raw number of bytes per week, the number is horrendous. It is impossible for one man to produce this much cogent thought in a week. Speaking only for myself (perhaps a poor comparison) I don't think I could even type that fast. ... Due to his high volume and near-total lack of redeeming value, I propose that Rich Rosen be removed from USENET. In order to preserve the usual facade of democracy, I'm doing this as a poll. ... * On the other hand, an article by Thomas Richardson from 1995 said: *: Rosen was particularly noteworthy, because he posted pages [and] pages of coherent material in just about every group I read. ... This was back when you could read the entire Usenet feed in a single afternoon. That doesn't explain how Rosen managed to post on every subject, though. I think he must have been a speed typist or he must have had some kind of augmented metabolism or something. ... He also managed to stay coherent and to largely avoid repeating himself. Maybe there really was no Rich Rosen. Maybe Dennis Ritchie was just playing a weird joke on everybody. Post-Bellcore (1990s) Rosen left Bellcore in 1989, but continued to post occasionally to Usenet from various outside accounts. He was one of the early members of the Panix user community in New York through the mid-1990s. He hosted his own popular \\"Monty Python home page\\" that was cited by both Lycos and the Global Network Navigator. During the latter part of the 1990s, Rosen worked at Pencom Web Works with Leon Shklar, with whom he would later collaborate on Web Application Architecture: Principles, Protocols, and Practices, a widely used textbook for senior and graduate level college courses in Web application development. Present day Today, Rosen lives once again in New Jersey with his wife, Celia. He is \\"retired\\" from posting to Usenet, but now has his own blog to post to. He still writes on the subject of web application development, including articles for various online and print journals, while also working with Leon Shklar on a second edition of their Web Application Architecture book. In addition, he recently contributed material to the fourth edition of Mac OS X for Unix Geeks which was published in the fall of 2008. He continues to record his own music, some of which is accessible on his web site.

The school is one of the most expensive in the state, with annual tuition for the upper school of $28,600 in 2020/21. The school hosts many noteworthy science-related educational programs for the benefit of its students, such as Turtle Tagging with NOAA and The Energy Lab (a partnership with Stanford University). The school is also the host of the TED organization's TEDxYouth@HPA event.  History  Founded in 1949 by The Right Reverend Harry S. Kennedy, Episcopal Bishop of Honolulu, the school came of age under the leadership of James Monroe Taylor II, Headmaster from 1954-1974. Originally the school was located on the grounds of St. James Episcopal Church in Kamuela in buildings that were built as barracks for the United States Marines during World War II. Currently the high school features four dormitories: Perry-Fiske Hall, Carter Hall, Robertson Hall, and Atherton House. While the town is known as \\"Waimea\\", because there are multiple locations in Hawaii with that name, the term \\"Kamuela\\" is used by the USPS to distinguish it from those other locations. HPA is now divided into a lower school, middle school and upper school. The lower and middle school together compose one campus in the ranch region of the Big Island of Hawaii. The upper school is located at the foot of the Kohala Mountains. The school is accredited by the National Association for Independent Schools (NAIS). The upper campus has a weight room, wrestling room, pool, school library, an indoor tennis facility, baseball field, gym, bookstore, as well as a new (2008) softball field, a newly repaired football/soccer field and a new rubber track. The school also is host to a cross country course. Along with classrooms, an art building, and a theater, and an Energy Lab, the only of its kind in the world. There is also a church on the property built before the school moved to its present site. The village campus is in the middle of the town of Waimea, and features the only school- owned professional art-gallery in the state, Isaacs Art Center. The village campus also has two soccer fields. The school also has a successful boys cross country team. Two male champions in recent years include Mac Crommett (Class of '07) and Emmett Weatherford (Class of '05). Their girls cross country team has also been successful.Cross Country - Girls The school colors are red, white and black. The school's mascot is Ka Makani. Ka Makani is the Hawaiian word for \\"the wind\\". (The campus is noteworthy for the steady winds which blow around it at speeds averaging 20 MPH.) The school's chapel \\"The Davies Chapel\\" was designed by the world-renown architect Vladimir Ossipoff. In 2015, the Chapel bell tower was taken down for restoration. No progress has been made hence. At the end of the 2017 school year, HPA was charged with a sexual abuse case. The then-director of alumni and student programs was found to be having an inappropriate relationship with a student in the year prior.

He is a founder of the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity (WO≈öP / Wielka Orkiestra ≈öwiƒÖtecznej Pomocy), one of the largest non- governmental, non-profit, charity organizations in Poland. Owsiak is the main initiator and promoter for the group's Grand Finale, an annual worldwide festival involving music and other components intended to raise money for the medical care of children as well as the elderly suffering from various medical conditions. He is also the creator of Pol'and'Rock Festival, formerly known as Przystanek Woodstock (\\"Woodstock Festival\\"), a large rock music festival that takes place in Kostrzyn nad OdrƒÖ, to thank all the volunteers and supporters who take part in the Grand Finale each year. Owsiak is married to Lidia Nied≈∫wiedzka-Owsiak, the Medical Affairs Director for WO≈öP. He is also a stained glass maker, and he has qualifications in psychotherapy.  Life and activity  At the age of eight, Owsiak moved with his parents from Gda≈Ñsk to Warsaw. There, he graduated from high school with an economic profile, and later attempted to achieve a place at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. When he was a teenager, he was involved with the hippie subculture in the Masovian Voivodeship. His fascination with this subculture led to his idea for the \\"Woodstock Stop\\", an annual rock concert held in Poland.  Artistic career  Due to his acquaintance with Wojciech Waglewski, Owsiak became well known in music circles. Since 1988, he has attended Voo Voo concerts. He has played at some of them with his band, Towarzystwo Przyjaci√≥≈Ç Chi≈Ñskich Rƒôcznik√≥w ( Society of Friends of Chinese Towels ), and he started his programme on the Rozg≈Ço≈õnia Harcerska (the Scout's Radio Station). After the termination of his work in the Scout's Radio Station, his next undertaking was the broadcast of \\"Brum\\". He ran it in the 1991-1994 period in PR Program III. It was only broadcast on Fridays. Between 1994 and 1999, it changed its name to \\"Siƒô krƒôci\\". Later, he undertook the broadcast of \\"Krƒôcio≈Ça\\" on Polskie Radio Program I and attended meetings with listeners on Saturday mornings at RMF FM. However, all of these broadcasts ended only after a few broadcasts, because of conflict with station authorities. Between 1991 and 2007, Owsiak cooperated with Telewizja Polska, a public broadcasting corporation, operating throughout Poland. Since December 1991 he has been preparing a TV programme, \\"R√≥bta, co chceta, czyli rockendrollowa jazda bez trzymanki\\" for TVP2, which was called \\"Dziura w koszu\\" from 1994, and from 1996 \\"Krƒôcio≈Ça\\". In 2007 he began working on the radio again. On 4 July 2007 he ran, for the first time, \\"D≈∫wiƒôkoszczelny magazyn Jurka Owsiaka\\" on the WAWA radio station. The show was later broadcast on the Eska Rock radio station, until 4 April 2010. In 2007, he produced the youth channel, O.TV (Owsiak TV), which is available on the Direct-broadcast satellite, platform n. Owsiak is the co-author of the \\"Orkiestra Klubu Pomocnych Serc, czyli monolog ‚Äì wodospad Jurka Owsiaka\\", a book which comprises an extensive interview made by Bart≈Çomiej Dobroczy≈Ñski. He also acted in the TV soap opera \\"Klan\\" as himself and in the \\"Autoportret z kochankƒÖ\\" by Rados≈Çaw Piwowarski.  Organization of concerts  At the end of the 1980s and the 1990s, Owsiak was engaged in the organization of many rock concerts. He organized a series of marathon music concerts, which all had a common feature ‚Äì his characteristic \\"stammering\\" announcing, and the participation of the best Polish Punk rock bands of that time. These concerts included: * Letnia zadyma w ≈õrodku zimy ‚Äì in Stodo≈Ça club, Warsaw ‚Äì 27 January 1989 (organization debut), 1991 * Zadyma na Torwarze, Warsaw 1989 * 50 Rock'n'Rolli Na 1 maja ‚Äì in Fugazzi club, Warsaw 1992 * Warsaw-Berlin 2 Step ‚Äì Agrykola, Warsaw 1993 In 1991 and 1992 he ran the Jarocin Festival, along with Walter Che≈Çstowski. They also organized the first Przystanek Woodstock in 1995 in Czymanowo near ≈ªarnowiec.  Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity  In 1993, Owsiak founded the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity, along with Lidia Nied≈∫wiedzka-Owsiak and Bohdan Maruszewski, which is now one of the largest, non-government, non-profit, charities in Poland. The main objective of the charity is \\"Health Protection and Saving Children's Lives through Providing Medical Equipment to Public Hospitals\\". His first fund-raising participation was organised spontaneously after an appeal from the cardio- surgeons from \\"Centrum Zdrowia Dziecka\\" (\\"Children's Memorial Health Institute\\"), for financial support for the purchase of medical equipment. In 1992, Owsiak invited doctors onto his programme \\"Brum\\" broadcast on Polskie Radio Program III, and repeatedly reminded his listeners on every edition about paying money into a given account. This action was also continued during the Jarocin Festival the same year. There was a lot of positive feedback for these actions, and in March 1993, thanks to the initiative of Owsiak and Walter Che≈Çstowski, GOCC officially came into existence and its first Great Finale was organised on January 3, 1993. Since then, the Great Finale has taken place every year and Owsiak is the main organizer and compere of the TV programme under the same title, broadcast on TVP2.  Splitting with TVP  Owsiak split with from TVP after 16 years of cooperation. He ran programmes such as the annual GOCC Great Finale, \\"Krƒôcio≈Ça\\", \\"Bezpieczne Wakacje\\" and \\"R√≥bta co chceta\\". On 6 October 2007, a new channel on DTH platform n belonging to ITI Group, was launched. The decision to split with TVP was made by Owsiak because, as he says, his programmes were not broadcast enough, and the Great Finale of this year was limited only to several five-minute-long entries.

New Denver was founded as a mining town in 1891, and was initially named Eldorado City in the hope that its fortune would be found in gold. The next year, when it became clear that gold would not be the source of wealth for the community, at a public meeting, Thomas Latheen, a former resident of Denver, Colorado persuaded the meeting that New Denver should be the name for their settlement. It was incorporated as a village in 1929 and has approximately 500 residents. History During World War II, New Denver became one of several concentration camps for Japanese-Canadians. Not long after the outbreak of hostilities and Japan's attack on Canadian troops in Hong Kong in December 1941, men of Japanese descent between the ages of 18 to 45 were sent to labour camps in the Interior of British Columbia or farther into Eastern Canada. Also, approximately 1,500 women, children, and elderly men were sent to the \\"Orchard\\", a small section of New Denver set up to house them. New Denver's Nikkei Internment Memorial Centre is dedicated to the history of the 27,000 Japanese Canadians who were interned by the Canadian government and is a National Historic Site. In the 1950s, roughly 200 Doukhobor children, aged 7‚Äì15, of Freedomites, a Doukhobor extremist group, were removed from their parents and sent to residential school in New Denver. The Freedomites refused to send their children to school because of their religious beliefs. Government Ken Casley served as mayor from 1982 until 1989, and then stepped down for health reasons. He was succeeded by Gary Wright. Wright continued in the position until his retirement in 2011, and was succeeded by Ann Bunka. Leonard Casley was elected as mayor in October 2018. Communications The town is notable for its resistance to mobile phones.

Despite the term posterior, this form of damage to the eye's optic nerve due to poor blood flow also includes cases where the cause of inadequate blood flow to the nerve is anterior, as the condition describes a particular mechanism of visual loss as much as the location of damage in the optic nerve. In contrast, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) is distinguished from PION by the fact that AION occurs spontaneously and on one side in affected individuals with predisposing anatomic or cardiovascular risk factors.  Signs and symptoms  PION is characterized by moderate to severe painless vision loss of abrupt onset. One or both eyes may be affected and color vision is typically impaired. =Ophthalmoscopic exam= Looking inside the person's eyes at the time of onset, ophthalmoscope exam reveals no visible changes to the optic nerve head. Weeks after ischemic insult, nerve atrophy originating from the damaged posterior optic nerve progresses to involve the anterior optic nerve head. Four to eight weeks after onset, atrophy of the optic nerve head is observable upon ophthalmoscope exam. =Pupils= If both eyes are affected by PION, the pupils may look symmetrical. However, if the eyes are asymmetrically affected, i.e. one eye's optic nerve is more damaged than the other, it will produce an important sign called an afferent pupillary defect. Defective light perception in one eye causes an asymmetrical pupillary constriction reflex called the afferent pupillary defect (APD). =Arteritic PION= A-PION most commonly affects Caucasian women, with an average age of 73. At onset vision loss is unilateral, but without treatment it rapidly progresses to involve both eyes. Vision loss is usually severe, ranging from counting fingers to no light perception. Associated symptoms are jaw pain exacerbated by chewing, scalp tenderness, shoulder and hip pain, headache and fatigue. =Perioperative PION= Vision loss is usually apparent upon waking from general anesthesia. Signs observable to a bystander include long surgery duration and facial swelling. Vision loss is usually bilateral and severe, ranging from counting fingers to no light perception.  Cause  PION is a watershed infarction of the optic nerve that may cause either unilateral or, more often, bilateral blindness. PION typically occurs in two categories of people: * People who have undergone non-ocular surgery that is particularly prolonged or is associated with a significant blood loss. * People who have experienced significant bleeding from an accident or ruptured blood vessels. In these cases, the person may develop anemia (too few oxygen-delivering red blood cells in the bloodstream) and often have low blood pressure as well. This combination can produce circulatory shock, and PION has sometimes been called shock-induced optic neuropathy. The combination of anemia and low blood pressure means that the blood is carrying less oxygen to the tissues. The optic nerve can be at very high risk for damage from insufficient blood supply due to swelling (from lack of oxygen) in a confined bony space resulting in a compartment syndrome. Restricted blood flow can lead to permanent damage to the optic nerve and result in blindness (often in both eyes). For technical reasons this occurs more frequently with spinal surgeries. =Cardiovascular risk factors= Perioperative PION patients have a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors than in the general population. Documented cardiovascular risks in people affected by perioperative PION include high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, high levels of cholesterol in the blood, tobacco use, abnormal heart rhythms, stroke, and obesity. Men are also noted to be at higher risk, which is in accordance with the trend, as men are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease. These cardiovascular risks all interfere with adequate blood flow, and also may suggest a contributory role of defective vascular autoregulation. =Perioperative PION= As illustrated by the risk factors above, perioperative hypoxia is a multifactorial problem. Amidst these risk factors it may be difficult to pinpoint the optic nerve's threshold for cell death, and the exact contribution of each factor. Low blood pressure and anemia are cited as perioperative complications in nearly all reports of PION, which suggests a causal relationship. However, while low blood pressure and anemia are relatively common in the perioperative setting, PION is exceedingly rare. Spine and cardiac bypass surgeries have the highest estimated incidences of PION, 0.028% and 0.018% respectively, and this is still extremely low. This evidence suggests that optic nerve injury in PION patients is caused by more than just anemia and low blood pressure. Evidence suggests that the multifactorial origin of perioperative PION involves the risks discussed above and perhaps other unknown factors. Current review articles of PION propose that vascular autoregulatory dysfunction and anatomic variation are under-investigated subjects that may contribute to patient- specific susceptibility.  PathogenesisPION= In both types of PION, decreased blood flow leads to the death of optic nerve cells. Ischemic injury to the optic nerve causes inflammation and swelling. Because the posterior optic nerve passes through the optic canal, a bony tunnel leading to the brain, swelling in this rigid space causes compression of the optic nerve. This compression worsens ischemia and perpetuates the cycle of injury, and swelling, and compression. =A-PION = A-PION is caused by an inflammatory disease called giant cell arteritis (GCA). GCA is an inflammatory disease of blood vessels. It is believed to be an autoimmune disease caused by inappropriate T-cell activity. When T-cells damage arteries supplying the optic nerve, a blood clot forms and stops blood flow. When blood flow stops, oxygen delivery stops and optic nerve fibers die. =Perioperative PION= The exact cause of perioperative PION is unknown. Many risk factors have been identified, all of which contribute to inadequate delivery of oxygen to optic nerve cells. Alone, none of these risk factors is enough to cause PION. However, in susceptible individuals, a combination of these risk factors produces devastating blindness. This evidence suggests that PION is a disease of multifactorial origin. Risks of perioperative PION can be divided into two categories, intraoperative ischemic pressures, and cardiovascular risk factors. Intraoperative ischemic pressures Many causes of decreased blood flow during surgery are systemic, i.e. they decrease blood flow throughout the body. Studies have shown that nearly all perioperative PION patients suffered from prolonged periods of low blood pressure during the operation and postoperative anemia. The average perioperative PION patient loses 4 liters of blood during surgery, and the majority receive blood transfusions. Massive blood loss is just one cause of low blood pressure. Medications used for general anesthesia can also lower blood pressure. The average surgery duration in PION cases is 7 to 9 hours, which increases the risk of prolonged low blood pressure. Other intraoperative ischemic pressures are local, i.e. they decrease blood flow to the affected area, the optic nerve. Facial swelling, periorbital swelling, direct orbital compression, facedown position during surgery, and a tilted operating table in feet-above- head position, have all been reported to be associated with perioperative PION. All of these factors are believed to increase tissue pressure and venous pressure around the optic nerve, thereby decreasing local blood flow and oxygen delivery. Surgeries with the highest estimated incidence of PION are surgeries with a higher risk of the aforementioned conditions. In spine surgery, patients are susceptible to significant blood loss, and they are positioned face down for long periods of time, which increases venous pressure, decreases arterial perfusion pressure, and often causes facial swelling (increased tissue pressure). Spine surgery is estimated to have the highest incidence of PION, 0.028%. Long duration of feet-above-head position in prostate surgery has also been suggested to increase risk of PION.  Diagnosis  The diagnosis of PION is often difficult since the optic nerves initially appear normal. The injury occurs posterior to that portion of the nerve visible during ophthalmoscopic examination. There may be an abnormal relative pupillary response (APD) if the injury is confined to one optic nerve, but often it is bilateral and the symmetry of pupillary responses is maintained. Furthermore, MRI scanning may not be helpful. It is not uncommon for the erroneous diagnoses of malingering or cortical blindness to be made. If possible, an urgent neuro-ophthalmology consult is most likely to lead to the correct diagnosis. There is no confirmatory test for PION. PION is a diagnosis of exclusion. To prevent impending blindness, it is urgent to rule out giant cell arteritis when a patient over 50 presents with sudden vision loss. = Differential diagnosis = In the postoperative setting, without gross eye injury, visual loss requires an assessment of the whole visual system for ischemic damage. The optic nerve is not the only tissue of the visual pathway susceptible to decreased blood flow. Decreased oxygenation of the retina or brain could also impair vision. =Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy= PION is less common than Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (AION). Blood supply and surrounding anatomy make the anterior and posterior portions of the optic nerve susceptible to different ischemic pressures. The posterior optic nerve receives blood primarily from the pial branches of the ophthalmic artery. The optic canal, a boney tunnel leading to the brain, surrounds the most posterior part of this optic nerve segment. The anterior optic nerve receives blood primarily from the posterior ciliary arteries. The anterior optic nerve, a.k.a. the optic nerve head, is surrounded by the scleral canal, and is vulnerable to crowding of nerve fibers. The portion of the optic nerve head that is visible by looking into the eye with an ophthalmoscope is called the optic disc. =PION versus AION= At the onset of symptoms, ophthalmoscope examination can differentiate AION from PION. If optic nerve head involvement is observed, it is AION. PION does not produce optic atrophy that is observable via ophthalmoscope until four to eight weeks after onset. In addition, AION often shows a characteristic altitudinal defect on a Humphrey Visual Field test. =GCA= The American College of Rheumatology has defined a combination of physical symptoms and inflammatory changes to diagnose giant cell arteritis.  Prevention  Individuals with a history of high blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking are most susceptible to PION as they have a compromised system of blood vessel autoregulation. Hence, extra efforts may need to be taken for them in the form of careful or staged surgery or the controlling the anemia from blood loss (by administration of blood transfusions), and the careful maintenance of their blood pressure.  Treatment  Once visual loss has occurred, it becomes more problematic, but there are reports of recovered vision if blood transfusions and agents that raise blood pressure are administered within hours. =A-PION= If a diagnosis of GCA is suspected, treatment with steroids should begin immediately. A sample (biopsy) of the temporal artery should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and guide future management, but should not delay initiation of treatment. Treatment does not recover lost vision, but prevents further progression and second eye involvement. High dose corticosteroids may be tapered down to low doses over approximately one year. =Perioperative= Rapid blood transfusions, to correct anemia and raise blood pressure, may improve PION outcomes. In one report of a related disease, hypotension-induced AION, 3 out of 3 patients who received rapid transfusions reported partial recovery of vision. While rapid transfusions offer some hope, the prognosis for perioperative PION remains poor. Prevention remains the best way to reduce PION. One retrospective report proposes that incidence of PION could be reduced in high-risk cases by altering surgical management. For example, for patients undergoing spine surgery, measures could be taken to minimize intraoperative hypotension, to accelerate the process of blood replacement, and to aggressively treat facial swelling. Epidemiology PION most commonly affects the elderly.

It was removed in 2011 after standing for over 10 years. Current Loyalist mural in Ballymacarrett Road. It replaced the former mural but still shows all the men of the previous mural. Ballymacarrett or Ballymacarret () is the name of both a townland and electoral ward in Belfast. The townland is in County Down and the electoral ward is part of the Titanic district electoral area of Belfast City Council. The ward was created in 1973 with most of the population coming from the former Pottinger ward. The ward was slightly enlarged in 1985, taking in part of the Island ward. The ward consists of two distinct districts : Ballymacarrett itself, which is almost entirely Protestant, and the Short Strand which is almost entirely Catholic, with the two separated by a peaceline. Consequently, in the 2001 census, the Roman Catholic community background figure was 51%. Set in the shadows of the Harland and Wolff cranes Samson & Goliath, large numbers of local men worked in the shipyard during its heyday. The area is also well known for 'Ulster's Freedom Corner', a series of loyalist murals. HistoryThe Troubles= In some ways the ward has been a microcosm of the Northern Ireland troubles. The June 1970 \\"Battle of Saint Matthew's\\" occupies an important place in Irish republican history after a gun battle between republicans and loyalists, who were accused of attacking the church. Loyalists counter this with claims that three Orange Order members were killed after returning from a parade. The Historical Enquiries Team (HET) confirmed the loyalist version of events. It is seen as one of the key developments in the rise to prominence of the Provisional IRA. Similarly on the Ballymacarrett side of the peaceline, Protestant residents have claimed that Republicans are engaged in attacks on Protestant homes which amount to 'ethnic cleansing' ‚Äì claims which Republicans dispute and deny. =2011 East Belfast riots= Ballymacarrett and the nearby Newtownards Road played a key part in what became known as the 2011 Northern Ireland riots. At first, the riots were only located in the area and were known as the 2011 East Belfast riots but by July, the riots had spread to other parts of the country. During the riots, the Protestants in the area were going against Short Strand Catholics. Transport Ballymacarrett was the location of the Ballymacarrett Junction, a large railway junction that served the Belfast and County Down Railway from its Queens Quay terminus, to Bangor in the north, and the mainline running south to Comber, Downpatrick and Newcastle. There was also an interconnection over the river Lagan to the Great Northern Railway and on to Belfast Central railway station. Ballymacarrett was the scene of the Ballymacarrett rail crash which occurred at 7.50am on 10 January 1945 when the 7.40am rail motor Holywood to Belfast crashed into the rear of the 7.10am Bangor to Belfast train. 22 passengers were killed, and 27 injured. The darkness and local fog were a factor but the driver of the rail motor was held to blame. Ballymacarrett Halt railway station was located on the B&CDR; route from Belfast to Bangor. It opened on 1 May 1905, but closed on 9 May 1977, when the adjacent Bridge End railway station opened.

Broad Street at the corner of Walnut Street in Center City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania United States. Constructed in 1904 and expanded to its present size in 1912, it has continued as a well-known institution for more than a century and is still widely known by that original, historic name. In 1988 the building was converted to a mixed-use development. It has been known since then as The Bellevue. The hotel portion is currently managed by Hyatt as The Bellevue Hotel. George Boldt Born Georg Karl Boldt in Prussia in 1851, he immigrated to the United States as a teenager in 1864. Beginning as a kitchen worker, at age 25 was hired by William Kehrer, steward of The Philadelphia Club, as his assistant steward at the time of the 1876 Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia. Soon after he married his employer's daughter, Philadelphia- born Louise Kehrer. Prominent members of the Philadelphia Club assisted the couple in setting up their own hotel, the Bellevue, at the northwest corner of Broad and Walnut Streets, in 1881. A small hotel, it quickly became nationally known for its high standard of service, elite clientele, and fine cuisine; it is believed that Chicken √† la King was created in the 1890s by hotel cook William \\"Bill\\" King. In 1890, George Boldt was invited by William Waldorf Astor to be proprietor of the new Waldorf Hotel in New York City. Louise Boldt had been instrumental in making their Philadelphia hotel attractive and socially acceptable to wealthy women. This was probably a major motivation for Astor in asking George Boldt to become proprietor of his new Waldorf, later expanded by John Jacob Astor IV to become the world-class institution known as the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Construction With his success at managing the enormous Waldorf Astoria, George Boldt decided to build a similarly large and luxurious hotel in his home town. He acquired the Stratford Hotel across Walnut on the southwest corner and commissioned the grand 19 floor Bellevue- Stratford Hotel, designed in the French Renaissance style by G.W. & W.D. Hewitt, with Purdy and Henderson, Engineers. These Philadelphia architects also designed the Boldts' famous landmark residence, Boldt Castle in the Thousand Islands. Opening in 1904 after two years in the making and costing over $8,000,000 (in 1904 dollars), the Bellevue-Stratford was described at the time as the most luxurious hotel in the nation and perhaps the most spectacular hotel building in the world. It had hundreds of guest suites in a variety of styles, the most magnificent ballroom in the United States, delicate lighting fixtures designed by Thomas Edison, stained and leaded glass embellishments in the form of transoms and Venetian windows and sky-lights by Alfred Godwin, and the most celebrated marble and hand-worked iron elliptical staircase in the city. In 1912 a large extension to the west brought it up to a reputed 1,090 guest rooms, and added the top floor domed function rooms. Early history From its beginning, the Bellevue-Stratford was the center of Philadelphia's cultural, social and business activities. It soon functioned as a sort of clubhouse for the Philadelphia establishment, not only a place where the rich and powerful dined and occasionally slept, but also the venue for their meetings and social functions. Charity balls, society weddings, club meetings and special family gatherings have all been held in the hotel's ballrooms and meeting rooms. The rich and famous, royalty and heads of state from all over the world, presidents, politicians, actors and famous writers have stayed within its walls. 15 U.S. Presidents, beginning with Theodore Roosevelt and ending with Ronald Reagan, have been guests at the hotel, which is respectfully called the \\"Grand Dame of Broad Street.\\" Originally the western end of the building was only three stories high. In 1911 Boldt added extensions to the hotel and carried it to the full nineteen stories. It was completed in 1912 at a cost of $850,000. Waldorf and Astoria Hotels in New York all of which were then operating under the management of George Boldt In June 1919 the Bellevue was leased to T. Coleman du Pont, together with Lucius M. Boomer, president of Boomer-du Pont Properties Corporation. The ground and building were retained by George C. Boldt Jr. Boomer-du Pont offered the Boldt family $7,500,000 for the hotel. They refused, as the asking price was $10,000,000. In June 1925 the company backed by duPont, The Bellevue Company purchased the hotel for $6,500,000 from the heirs of George C. Boldt. It was said that $3,000,000 was paid in cash and a mortgage was taken over the property for $3,500,000. A bedroom in the Bellevue-Stratford, photographed by William H. Rau, circa 1905 In October 1926, Queen Marie of Romania stayed at the hotel. The Royal Suite of 11 rooms on the seventh floor to be occupied by Queen Marie and her entourage of 19 has a history. Among the world-famous people who have occupied the suite are President and Mrs. Calvin Coolidge, Cardinal Mercier of Belgium, President and Mrs. Woodrow Wilson, Marshal Joffre, General John J. Pershing, President and Mrs. Warren G. Harding, a brother of the Emperor of Japan, Sir Esme Howard, Ambassador Jules Jusserand, and Ambassador Auckland Geddes. During the 1920s through the 1940s, the noted global host Claude H. Bennett managed the now 735 room Philadelphia hotel. His son, Robert C. Bennett (Cornell Hotel School 1940), and grandson, Robert Jr. (Drexel Hill, PA), Professor of Hotel Management at a suburban Philadelphia community college (Delaware County Community College), were both on the senior management staff of the \\"Grand Dame\\" of Broad Street as late as the 1970s prior to the temporary hotel closing. Decline The Great Depression brought hard times to the Bellevue-Stratford, although it continued to be \\"Philadelphia's hotel.\\" Gradually, through lack of income and attention, the hotel's glitter began to tarnish. During the 1940s and 1950s, the classic architecture and rich decorative details of the hotel were thought to be overpowering, anachronistic and even offensive.https://archinect.com/forum/thread/59850383/the-bellevue-stratford- hotel-of-philadelphia Noted hotelier Charles Todd managed the hotel after this period, bringing it back \\"into the black.\\" He had managed the Lake Placid facility for the 1932 Winter Olympics, and later retired from the famed Hotel Hershey in Hershey, Pennsylvania in the 1960s.https://books.google.com/books?id=d2KfBAAAQBAJ&lpg;=PT98&ots;=QUprFtsQUA&dq;=hotelier%20Charles%20Todd&pg;=PT98#v=onepage&q;=hotelier%20Charles%20Todd&f;=false He is also known for teaching a public domain game called \\"The Landlords Game\\" (teaching economic principles espoused by the Henry George School of Economics in Philadelphia) in the 1930s to Charles Darrow, who later claimed to have invented it as Monopoly.https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/business/behind- monopoly-an-inventor-who-didnt-pass-go.html The Bellevue-Stratford was the headquarters of the 1936 and 1948 National Conventions of the U.S. Republican Party and the 1948 Convention of the Democratic Party. On October 30, 1963, the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel became a 'testing ground' of sorts for the 35th U.S. President, John F. Kennedy, as he successfully rode in a 13-mile open car motorcade from the Philadelphia International Airport to the Bellevue- Stratford Hotel.https://books.google.com/books?id=cO- yBAAAQBAJ&lpg;=PA99&ots;=W6QxiyPgL4&dq;=October%2030%2C%201963%20jfk%20motorcade%20hotel&pg;=PA99#v=onepage&q;=October%2030,%201963%20jfk%20motorcade%20hotel&f;=false Less than a month later, JFK was assassinated in an open car motorcade through the city of Dallas, Texas. The lobby in 1976 The hotel gained worldwide notoriety in July 1976, when it hosted a statewide convention of the American Legion. Soon after, a pneumonia-like disease killed 29 people and sickened 182 more who had been in the hotel. The vast majority were members of the convention. The negative publicity associated with what became known as \\"Legionnaires' Disease\\" caused occupancy at the Bellevue-Stratford to plummet to 4 percent and the hotel finally closed on November 18, 1976. In 1977, Dr. Joseph McDade discovered a new bacterium, which was identified as the causative organism. It thrives in hot, damp places like the water of the cooling towers for the Bellevue-Stratford's air-conditioning system, which spread the disease throughout the hotel.\\"Legionnaires' Disease ‚Äì a History of its Discovery\\" (January 16, 2003) The bacterium was named Legionella and the disease, legionellosis, after the first victims. The empty building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Restoration The Bellevue-Stratford was sold in June 1978 to the Richard I. Rubin Company for $8.25 million. Rubin undertook a $25-million restoration. The guest rooms were completely gutted and their number reduced from 725 to 565, while the public areas were painstakingly restored to their 1904 appearance. 44,000 square yards of carpet were imported from Ireland, 25 tons of marble came from Portugal and crystal chandeliers were sourced from Uruguay. The hotel reopened on September 26, 1979, managed by Fairmont Hotels, as the Fairmont Hotel. The following year, Western International Hotels bought a 49-percent interest in the hotel and assumed management on November 15, 1980. They returned the hotel to its original name, Bellevue Stratford, and announced plans to construct a huge parking garage adjacent to the hotel. Two months later, Western International was itself renamed Westin Hotels, and the hotel was soon renamed The Westin Bellevue Stratford. By the mid-1980s, the hotel was struggling to fill its hundreds of rooms. Philadelphia had lower hotel occupancy rates than other major East Coast cities at the time, and a lengthy conflict between city and state officials over financing for a new convention center, which would eventually open in 1993, meant that demand for hotel rooms in Center City was even lower than expected. With an occupancy rate of 55 percent, far below the 65-70 percent necessary to break even, and having operated at a total cash loss of $25 million from 1979‚Äì1985, never once turning a profit since its restoration, the hotel's owners announced in January 1986 that it would close on February 2. A lawsuit by the union representing the hotel's 450+ employees over the short notice given to its members, resulted in an agreement to keep the hotel open until April 2, but with The Westin Bellevue Stratford's advance bookings transferred to other hotels as a result of the closure announcement, only two floors of guest rooms still in use, and only 10 to 15 guests a night in the enormous building by that point, the union accepted a settlement of $500,000 and a promise that the renovated hotel would remain a union shop and agreed to an earlier closing date. The Westin Bellevue Stratford closed on March 7, 1986. Mixed-use Conversion The Rubin Company bought out Westin's stake in the hotel and again undertook extensive work on the building, at a cost of $100 million, designed by architects from RTKL Associates Inc. in Baltimore and the Vitetta Group-Studio Four of Philadelphia. The building's name was shortened to The Bellevue. The grand public areas on the ground floor were converted to 55,000 sq ft of retail space. A huge atrium was cut into the lobby and escalators were installed leading to an underground shopping area and food court. The parking garage adjacent to the hotel had a 70,000 sq ft fitness club built on top of it to serve the complex. The hotel rooms on floors 3 to 11 were converted into 280,000 sq ft of office space, entered through the original main entrance facing Broad Street, with the office portion opening on December 5, 1988. The main Broad Street entrance in 2013. The decorative portico is a darker stone because the original was removed in the 1950s and it had to be recreated in the 1979 restoration from original plans. The hotel portion was condensed to 170 guest rooms on floors 12-18. The hotel was entered through a small foyer on the ground floor facing Chancellor Court, with the lobby and public rooms on the remodeled 19th floor. The two domed ballrooms on that floor (the South and North Cameo rooms), were turned into the Ethel Barrymore Tea Room and a restaurant called Founders, with statues of Philadelphia fathers William Penn, Benjamin Franklin, David Rittenhouse, and Charles Wilson Peale. The middle wing of the E-shaped building was removed from the guest room floors 12 to 18, and the back side was sealed up, creating an atrium. The historic 19th-floor Rose Ballroom atop this middle wing was retained, however, standing on seven-story stilts which ran through the atrium. The hotel portion reopened on April 1, 1989 as the Hotel Atop The Bellevue, managed under a 10-year lease by the Cunard Line, The hotel opened to protests by unionized former employees, because Cunard was not part of the agreement to rehire them and had not done so. Cunard's hotel division proved financially unsuccessful and soon folded. Cunard terminated its lease on the hotel on February 7, 1993. Interstate Hotels & Resorts of Pittsburgh assumed management in December 1994 and the hotel's name was shortened to match the whole multi-use complex, becoming The Bellevue. On December 1, 1996 Hyatt took over management of the hotel, placing it in their Park Hyatt boutique division and renaming it the Park Hyatt Philadelphia at the Bellevue. In 2007 the two restaurants and Founders bar were re-designed by Marguerite Rodgers as XIX (NINETEEN) Cafe, Bar and Restaurant. In 2009 all four balconies outside the cafe and restaurant were restored and opened to the public for the highest outside dining experience in the city. In 2010 the hotel was moved from the Park Hyatt to the Hyatt division and its name was shortened to Hyatt at The Bellevue. The hotel moved to The Unbound Collection division of Hyatt in March 2018, and was renamed The Bellevue Hotel. In 1993 the city moved its convention center from West Philadelphia to Center City, sparking a boom in hotel occupancy for the Bellevue and other hostelries for a popular facility that subsequently benefited from a major expansion.https://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/convention-centers/ See also * * National Register of Historic Places listings in Center City, Philadelphia ReferencesExternal links * The Bellevue ‚Äì official building website * The Bellevue Hotel ‚Äì official website * BBC Article about the search for the cause of Legionnaire's Disease * The disaster that struck the Bellevue Stratford Hotel * The Bellevue Memorabilia Collection, 1884‚Äì2005, including photographs, brochures, programs, drawings and other materials, are available for research use at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. * * The application for the National Registry * Listing at Philadelphia Architects and Buildings Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Philadelphia Category:Hotel buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Philadelphia Category:Hyatt Hotels and Resorts Category:Rittenhouse Square, Philadelphia Category:Skyscraper hotels in Philadelphia Category:National Register of Historic Places in Philadelphia Category:Hotels established in 1904 Category:Hotels established in 1989 Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1904 Category:1904 establishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"The Bellevue-Stratford Hotel"},{"id":"2011476","text":"Magnesium perchlorate is a powerful oxidizing agent, with the formula Mg(ClO4)2.

Magnesium perchlorate is produced by the reaction of magnesium hydroxide and perchloric acid. Magnesium perchlorate and other perchlorates have been found on Mars. Being a drying agent, magnesium perchlorate retains water from the atmosphere and may release it when conditions are favorable and temperature is above 273 K. Briny solutions that contain salts such as magnesium perchlorate have a lower melting point than that of pure water. Therefore the abundance of magnesium and other perchlorate salts on Mars could support the theory that liquid aqueous solutions might exist on or below the surface, where temperature and pressure conditions would ordinarily cause the water to freeze.

Born in Colchester, Connecticut, Trumbull established a law practice in Greenville, Georgia, before moving to Alton, Illinois, in 1837. He served as the Illinois Secretary of State from 1841 to 1843 and as a justice of the Illinois Supreme Court from 1848 to 1853. He was elected to the Senate in 1855 and became a member of the Republican Party. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1861 to 1873, he co-wrote the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery in the United States. In the 1868 impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, Trumbull voted to acquit Johnson despite heavy pressure from other Republican senators. He was a candidate for the presidential nomination at the 1872 Liberal Republican convention but the fledgling party nominated Horace Greeley instead. Trumbull left the Senate in 1873 to establish a legal practice in Chicago. Before his death in 1896, he became a member of the Populist Party and represented Eugene V. Debs before the Supreme Court. Education and early career Trumbull was born in Colchester, Connecticut, the grandson of the historian Benjamin Trumbull. Lyman Trumbull is the subject of the second half of this article entitled with his father's name. After graduating from Bacon Academy, he taught school from 1829 to 1833. At 20, he was hired as head of an academy in Georgia. He studied (read the law) as a legal apprentice, and was admitted to the bar in Georgia. He practiced law in Greenville, Georgia until 1837, when he moved west to Alton, Illinois. His house in Alton, the Lyman Trumbull House, is a National Historic Monument. Elected office By 1840, Trumbull was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives. He was appointed as Illinois Secretary of State, serving from 1841 to 1843. In 1848, he was appointed as a justice of the Supreme Court of Illinois, serving until 1853. Although elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1854, he was elected by the state legislature to serve in the United States Senate before he could take his seat. He served for nearly two decades, from 1855 through 1873. During this time, he claimed party affiliations with the Democrats, the Republicans, the Liberal Republicans, and finally the Democrats again. On August 7, 1858, Trumbull delivered a speech in Chicago stating \\"We, the Republican Party, are the white man's party, we are for free white men and for making white labor respectable and honorable, which it can never be when negro slave labor is brought into competition with it\\". On 16 December 1861, Trumbull asked the Senate to consider his resolution: Senator James Dixon said of the resolution that \\"it seems to me calculated to produce nothing but mischief.\\"United States. Congress. The Congressional Globe: Containing the Debates and Proceedings of the Second Session of the Thirty-Seventh Congress. Edited by John C. Rives. Washington, DC: Congressional Globe Office, 1862, p. 90. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee (1861‚Äì1872), he co-wrote the Thirteenth Amendment, which prohibited all kinds of slavery in the United States other than its use as punishment for crimes of which the party had been convicted; this became the sentence to \\"time at hard labor\\" that became assignable for certain crimes. It was also the constitutional loophole by which southern states abused convict lease labor, a practice lasting into the twentieth century.

Fowler, James W. Grimes, John B. Henderson, Lyman Trumbull, Peter G. Van Winkle, and Edmund G. Ross. were disturbed by their belief that Thaddeus Stevens and Benjamin Wade and those of similar position had manipulated the proceedings against Johnson in order to give a one-sided presentation of the evidence.\\"Andrew Johnson Trial: The Consciences of Seven Republicans Save Johnson\\", JRank Trumbull, in particular, noted: > \\"Once set the example of impeaching a President for what, when the > excitement of the hour shall have subsided, will be regarded as insufficient > causes, as several of those now alleged against the President were decided > to be by the House of Representatives only a few months since, and no future > President will be safe who happens to differ with a majority of the House > and two-thirds of the Senate on any measure deemed by them important, > particularly if of a political character.

All seven senators, resisting the pressure imposed on them, broke party ranks and defied public opinion, voting for acquittal, although they knew their decision would be unpopular.\\"The Trial of Andrew Johnson, 1868\\". None was reelected. After the trial, Representative Ben Butler of Massachusetts conducted hearings in the House on widespread reports that Republican senators had been bribed to vote for Johnson's acquittal. Butler's hearings and subsequent inquiries revealed evidence that some acquittal votes were acquired by promises of patronage jobs and cash cards.David O.

Yellowstone Lyman Trumbull During the December 1871 congressional debate on the creation of Yellowstone National Park, Senator Trumbull, whose son Walter Trumbull was a member of the Washburn-Langford- Doane Expedition to Yellowstone in 1870, spoke in favor of the park concept: > \\"Here is a region of the country away up in the Rocky Mountains, where there > are the most wonderful geysers on the face of the earth; a country that is > not likely ever to be inhabited for the purpose of agriculture; but it is > possible that some person may go there and plant himself right across the > only path that leads to the wonders, and charge every man that passes along > between the gorges of these mountains a fee of a dollar or five dollars.

Amstutz, 1981, p. 88 Later career After leaving the Senate in 1873, Trumbull set up a law practice in Chicago. He worked in private practice except for a brief period when he ran an unsuccessful campaign for governor (as a Democrat) in 1880. In January 1883, Trumbull was given a seat of honor at the dedication of the Pullman Arcade Theatre in George Pullman's company town.Almont Lindsey, The Pullman Strike, 1942, p. 55 He became a Populist in 1894. According to Almont Lindsey's 1942 book, The Pullman Strike, Trumbull took part in defending Eugene Debs and other labor leaders of the American Railway Union, who had been convicted for violating a federal court injunction during the 1894 Pullman railroad strike. Trumbull was part of the three-member legal team, which included Clarence Darrow, when their habeas corpus case Ex parte In the Matter of Eugene V. Debs 'et al.' was heard by the US Supreme Court in 1895.Lindsey (1942), The Pullman Strike, p. 55 Memorials Front of Trumbull's house in Alton During his explorations in the west John Wesley Powell named Mt.

He studied at gymnasiums (high-schools) in Bansk√° Bystrica (1888-1890), Sopron (1890-1894) and in Sibiu (present-day Romania), where he passed in 1896 graduation exams and at universities in Budapest and Vienna. He started his career as a journalist in Budapest, in 1897. He edited and founded the newspaper Slovensk√Ω denn√≠k (1900‚Äì1901) and the weekly Slovensk√Ω t√Ω≈ædenn√≠k (1903‚Äì1914). From 1916 to 1918, he was editor of the Austrian press office in Vienna. As a member of the Slovak National Party - at that time the only Slovak party in Austria- Hungary - he became the ideological leader and founder of Slovak agrarianism. Since the Slovak National Party did not endorse his agrarian program, he decided to create his own political party, but World War I prevented him from this. Later, he also became an important representative of the Czechoslovak and international agrarian movement between the two world wars: He founded and was a member of the presidium of the International Agrarian Bureau - an institution of European agrarian parties. Milan Hod≈æa was a close aide of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the successor to the Austrian and Hungarian thrones, since the 1910 elections. He proposed to him a very precise plan of turning the Kingdom of Hungary into a federative monarchy (including a separate Slovak state). The Archduke hoped that federalization would strengthen the ties between the oppressed non-Magyar nations and the monarchy, but his initiative was strongly opposed by the Hungarian political elite. During World War I, Milan Hod≈æa was involved in the preparations of the creation of Czecho- Slovakia. He was a member of the 1918-1919 Slovak National Council and was a signatory of the Declaration of the Slovak Nation, by which the Slovaks officially joined the newly created state of Czechoslovakia in 1918. = 1918 - 1938 = After World War I, he became the leader of the Czechoslovak Agrarian Party in Slovakia and as such gained considerable influence over Czechoslovakia's policy in all spheres ‚Äì he influenced the process of land reform, the passing of bills on agrarian tolls, enforced syndicalization, administrative reforms, and the structure and policy of the government. In 1936-1937 he attempted to launch a project of bringing together Czechoslovakia, Austria, Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia based on preferential duties - a step towards the unprecedented economic integration of the region. Instead, Hod≈æa's government had to accept the Munich Agreement in 1938 and he was forced to resign under pressure. Since 1921, Milan Hod≈æa was also professor of modern history at the Comenius University in Bratislava. In the interwar period, he helped found many Slovak newspapers and magazines and had a strong political and ideological influence on them. His political papers were published in the book ƒål√°nky, reƒçi, ≈°t√∫die 1-6 (1930‚Äì1934; Articles, Speeches, Studies). In the 1920s, he was a Czechoslovakist (considered the Czechs and Slovaks to form one nation), which enabled him to reach high posts in Prague. Nevertheless, he had frequent conflicts with Czech politicians, because he was trying to take into account the specific needs of Slovakia within Czechoslovakia, which was unusual at that time. Moreover, he planned the creation of a block of anti-Centrist (i.e. anti-Prague) Slovak parties. He somewhat changed his views later - in 1938 he acknowledged the full sovereignty of the Slovaks as a separate nation and in the summer of that year (i.e. before Slovakia's autonomy was proclaimed in the autumn) he included in the programme of his government his personal project of changes in the structure of centralist Czechoslovakia - it was a combination of federal, autonomist and self-administrative ideas. = 1938 - 1944 = Kulpin After the Munich Agreement in late 1938, he lived in exile in Switzerland, France (1939), Great Britain (1940) and after 1941 in the US. During World War II, he was the co-author of a memorandum on the situation of Slovakia within Czechoslovakia (October 1939), in which he re-iterated his project of 1938. In November 1939, he established the 1939 Slovak National Council in Paris as the supreme body of Slovak resistance. The Slovak National Council merged with the Czech National Council to form the Czecho-Slovak National Council in January 1940. This organization (including its Czech members) competed with the government-in-exile led by Edvard Bene≈° (a strong Czechoslovakist) in London. Both exile groups were in permanent conflict. When Paris was conquered by the Germans, the British security forces took the members of the Czecho-Slovak National Council into custody which was an accomplishment of spies working for the Bene≈° group. Hod≈æa capitulated and he accepted a second-rate post in Bene≈°'s State Council in November 1940. He did not participate in the activities of the State Council however, and fled to the US in 1941. In the US, he developed a project for a Central European Federation (published as the book Federation in Central Europe, 1942). Although his plan received attention from American intellectuals and the Department of State officials, his plan could not materialize due to the beginning of the Cold War. Milan Hod≈æa held high Czechoslovak, French, Italian, Romanian, Yugoslavian and Polish awards. On 27 June 2002 the remains of Milan Hod≈æa were reburied in the National Cemetery in Martin, in his native Slovakia.  Works online  * ƒåeskoslovensk√Ω rozkol : pr√≠spevky k dejin√°m slovenƒçiny.

Living organisms remain at a dynamic steady state where their internal composition at both cellular and gross levels are relatively constant, but different from equilibrium concentrations. A continuous flux of mass and energy results in the constant synthesis and breakdown of molecules via chemical reactions of biochemical pathways. Essentially, steady state can be thought of as homeostasis at a cellular level.  Maintenance of Steady State  Figure 1: For a metabolic pathway at steady state, the rate of input into the pathway and the rate of output are balanced, allowing intermediates A and B to maintain constant steady state concentrations. Metabolic regulation achieves a balance between the rate of input of a substrate and the rate that it is degraded or converted, and thus maintains steady state. The rate of metabolic flow, or flux, is variable and subject to metabolic demands. However, in a metabolic pathway, steady state is maintained by balancing the rate of substrate provided by a previous step and the rate that the substrate is converted into product, keeping substrate concentration relatively constant. Thermodynamically speaking, living organisms are open systems, meaning that they constantly exchange matter and energy with their surroundings. A constant supply of energy is required for maintaining steady state, as maintaining a constant concentration of a molecule preserves internal order and thus is entropically unfavorable. When a cell dies and no longer utilizes energy, its internal composition will proceed toward equilibrium with its surroundings. In some occurrences, it is necessary for cells to adjust their internal composition in order to reach a new steady state. Cell differentiation, for example, requires specific protein regulation that allows the differentiating cell to meet new metabolic requirements.  ATP  The concentration of ATP must be kept above equilibrium level so that the rates of ATP-dependent biochemical reactions meet metabolic demands. A decrease in ATP will result in a decreased saturation of enzymes that use ATP as substrate, and thus a decreased reaction rate. The concentration of ATP is also kept higher than that of AMP, and a decrease in the ATP/AMP ratio triggers AMPK to activate cellular processes that will return ATP and AMP concentrations to steady state. In one step of the glycolysis pathway catalyzed by PFK-1, the equilibrium constant of reaction is approximately 1000, but the steady state concentration of products (fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and ADP) over reactants (fructose-6-phosphate and ATP) is only 0.1, indicating that the ratio of ATP to AMP remains in a steady state significantly above equilibrium concentration. Regulation of PFK-1 maintains ATP levels above equilibrium. In the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, the steady state ratio of NADP+ to NADPH is approximately 0.1 while that of NAD+ to NADH is approximately 1000, favoring NADPH as the main reducing agent and NAD+ as the main oxidizing agent in chemical reactions.  Blood Glucose  Figure 2: Regulation of metabolic pathways maintains blood glucose concentration at approximately 5 mM in humans. Blood glucose levels are maintained at a steady state concentration by balancing the rate of entry of glucose into the blood stream (i.e. by ingestion or released from cells) and the rate of glucose uptake by body tissues. Changes in the rate of input will be met with a change in consumption, and vice versa, so that blood glucose concentration is held at about 5 mM in humans. A change in blood glucose levels triggers the release of insulin or glucagon, which stimulates the liver to release glucose into the bloodstream or take up glucose from the bloodstream in order to return glucose levels to steady state. Pancreatic beta cells, for example, increase oxidative metabolism as a result of a rise in blood glucose concentration, triggering secretion of insulin. Glucose levels in the brain are also maintained at steady state, and glucose delivery to the brain relies on the balance between the flux of the blood brain barrier and uptake by brain cells. In teleosts, a drop of blood glucose levels below that of steady state decreases the intracellular-extracellular gradient in the bloodstream, limiting glucose metabolism in red blood cells.  Blood Lactate  Blood lactate levels are also maintained at steady state. At rest or low levels of exercise, the rate of lactate production in muscle cells and consumption in muscle or blood cells allows lactate to remain in the body at a certain steady state concentration. If a higher level of exercise is sustained, however, blood lactose levels will increase before becoming constant, indicating that a new steady state of elevated concentration has been reached. Maximal lactate steady state (MLSS) refers to the maximum constant concentration of lactase reached during sustained high-activity.  Nitrogen-Containing Molecules  Metabolic regulation of nitrogen-containing molecules, such as amino acids, is also kept at steady state. The amino acid pool, which describes the level of amino acids in the body, is maintained at a relatively constant concentration by balancing the rate of input (i.e. from dietary protein ingestion, production of metabolic intermediates) and rate of depletion (i.e. from formation of body proteins, conversion to energy-storage molecules). Amino acid concentration in lymph node cells, for example, is kept at steady state with active transport as the primary source of entry, and diffusion as the source of efflux.  Ions  Figure 3: Different steady state concentrations of ions on either side of the cell membrane maintain a resting membrane potential. One main function of plasma and cell membranes is to maintain asymmetric concentrations of inorganic ions in order to maintain an ionic steady state different from electrochemical equilibrium. In other words, there is a differential distribution of ions on either side of the cell membrane - that is, the amount of ions on either side is not equal and therefore a charge separation exists. However, ions move across the cell membrane such that a constant resting membrane potential is achieved; this is ionic steady state. In the pump-leak model of cellular ion homeostasis, energy is utilized to actively transport ions against their electrochemical gradient. The maintenance of this steady state gradient, in turn, is used to do electrical and chemical work, when it is dissipated though the passive movement of ions across the membrane. In cardiac muscle, ATP is used to actively transport sodium ions out of the cell through a membrane ATPase. Electrical excitation of the cell results in an influx of sodium ions into the cell, temporarily depolarizing the cell. To restore the steady state electrochemical gradient, ATPase removes sodium ions and restores potassium ions in the cell. When an elevated heart rate is sustained, causing more depolarizations, sodium levels in the cell increase until becoming constant, indicating that a new steady state has been reached.

It comprises offices occupied by Southampton City Council, the SeaCity Museum, the Guildhall, the Southampton City Art Gallery, and the city library. It was designed by the English architect Ernest Berry Webber in the Classical style in 1929 and constructed over a ten year period. It was completed in 1939. Pevsner's Hampshire: South describes it as \\"the most ambitious civic building erected in the provinces in the interwar years\\". It was listed as a Grade II* listed building in 1980.  History Early history= Since the 1870s, there was debate in the council over the housing of the borough offices: departments were scattered around the town, making co-ordination and timely response fairly difficult, with the old Audit House opposite Holyrood Church being totally inadequate. After extensive discussions about the proposed civic centre, Herbert Austin-Hall was appointed to assess a design competition for the new building. Following the competition, Ernest Berry Webber was chosen to design the centre in the Classical style with a budget of just under ¬£400,000. The foundation stone was laid by the Duke of York on 1 July 1930. The first block to be opened, known as the south wing, contained the municipal offices. Some of the material dug out during the construction of the south wing was used to fill in an old reservoir on Southampton Common as part of the process of converting it into a paddling pool. It was opened by the Duke of York, and his wife, the Duchess of York, on 8 November 1932. The second block, known as the west wing, contained the law courts and the police headquarters. It also contained \\"Kimber's Tower\\", which is high and named after Sir Sidney Kimber, who had chaired the civic centre development committee. The block was opened by Viscount Sankey, the Lord Chancellor, on 3 November 1933. It was decided that during the opening ceremony and every four hours thereafter the bells should sound the Westminster Quarters followed by the first verse of the hymn Our God, Our Help in Ages Past. The third block, known as the east wing, contained Southampton Guildhall. Work on the Guildhall (the east wing) began in March 1934. The Guildhall was intended as a social location for municipal functions. The Guildhall was opened by Earl of Derby on 13 February 1937. The fourth block, known as the north wing, contained Southampton City Art Gallery and Southampton Central Library. This began later than the others, and late alterations to the designs were required to incorporate a public library, that was not originally planned for. The expansion of this wing led to an increase in costs for the project, but the budget increase was approved by Parliament. This was opened in 1939. =Later history= During the Southampton Blitz, Hermann G√∂ring, head of the Luftwaffe, targeted the Civic Centre. He remarked that the building appeared like a \\"piece of cake\\" from the air, and that he was going to \\"cut himself a slice\\". During a raid in November 1940 twelve bombs were dropped, including a direct hit on the Civic Centre with a 500lb high explosive. The bomb penetrated to the lower floors of the art gallery killing 35 people, including 15 children, who were having an art lesson in the basement. The law courts vacated the west wing to move to a larger complex in The Avenue in 1999 while the police moved out of the west wing to new facilities in Southern Road in 2011. In 2012 the SeaCity Museum moved into the refurbished west wing complete with a modern pavilion extension.

Constructed in the Jacobethan style, it was \\"perhaps the last Victorian prodigy house.\\" It is a Grade II* listed building. The park had been developed round an earlier house on the site by both Capability Brown and Humphry Repton and is on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. The lake is a Site of Special Scientific Interest(SSSI).  Origins  The land was originally part of the estates of Bordesley Abbey. At the Dissolution of the Monasteries the property passed to Thomas Windsor Hickman.  Development  The estate remained a seat of the Windsor-Clive family (who were made Earls of Plymouth) until it was sold to the state in the 20th century. There are several ruins of earlier houses on the estate, and a large number of listed buildings, structures and statues. Robert Windsor-Clive (1857‚Äì1923) commissioned Bodley and Garner to build the current house in 1884‚Äì91.

The exterior is Jacobethan, of three storeys, the interior Italianate. The house is dominated by the massive Great Hall, comprising half the total space of the house. The elaborate decoration is largely \\"well-preserved.\\" The Chapel in the porch contains carving by Detmar Blow.  Prison  The house was used as a Borstal from 1946 to 1991, when it became HM Prison Hewell Grange, a Category D open prison.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 27, 2003. It was written by Ian Maxtone-Graham and was the first episode directed by Chris Clements. Plot At Christmas time, the Simpsons go caroling around Springfield before the Blue Haired Lawyer orders them to stop, citing copyright infringement. In response, Homer tries to write his own carol but when Ned Flanders tries to help, he soon creates an anti-Flanders song titled \\"Everybody Hates Ned Flanders\\". The song becomes so popular that the family leaves for a dude ranch. At the ranch, Lisa meets a cowhand named Luke Stetson, with whom she begins to bond. Meanwhile, Homer and Bart meet a tribe of Native Americans who want a beaver dam removed so they can reclaim their land. They are confronted by the beavers while attempting to dismantle the dam and eventually destroy it after luring the beavers away. Lisa overhears Luke expressing his love to a girl named Clara over the phone. When a jealous Lisa encounters her, she tricks her into going the wrong way on the path to a dance. Lisa finds out that Clara is Luke's sister and runs to the beaver dam with Bart. They find Clara standing on a rock in the middle of a torrential river. Bart taunts some beavers and scales a tree; the beavers chew through the tree, causing it to fall and create a bridge that Clara can cross. When Lisa comes clean about what happened to Clara, Luke is offended and leaves her. As the Simpsons return to Springfield, they hear a song entitled \\"The Moe Szyslak Connection\\" on the radio, sung by Moe Szyslak, and turn around to spend another week at the ranch. Reception On November 2, 2004, the episode was released in the United States on a DVD collection titled The Simpsons Christmas 2, along with the season twelve episodes \\"Homer vs. Dignity\\" and \\"Skinner's Sense of Snow\\" and the season fifteen episode \\"'Tis the Fifteenth Season\\". Reviewing the DVD, Brian James of PopMatters wrote that \\"Dude, Where's My Ranch?\\" displays \\"the series‚Äô nefarious habit of using the first third of the episode as a clearinghouse for disconnected jokes before actually beginning the plot, a blight made that much more glaring here since the only connection to Christmas comes early with the rest not even taking place in winter.\\" Cultural references * The episode title is a reference to the 2000 film Dude, Where's My Car?. * Andy Serkis' voice of Cleanie is a reference to Serkis' role of Gollum in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. * Moe asks David Byrne if he's \\"ever seen the movie Misery\\". * Moe's song is a parody of \\"More, More, More\\" by Andrea True Connection.

He also discusses the large difference between public opinion on the Cold War, establishment American educated opinion and reality. The book also contains criticism aimed at the Soviet Union and other communist states, but its major point centres on the fact that although the United States claimed to support freedom in the Cold War, it still supported authoritarian regimes.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 5, 1995. In the episode, Springfield decides to hold a film festival, and famed critic Jay Sherman is invited to be a judge. The story involves a crossover with the animated series The Critic. Jay Sherman was the main character on the show. The Critic was created by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had previously written for The Simpsons but left following the fourth season, and produced by James L. Brooks, who was also a producer for The Simpsons. The show had premiered on the ABC network in January 1994 but was canceled despite positive critical reception. The series was switched over to Fox, and put in the timeslot directly after The Simpsons. Brooks pitched a crossover episode as a way to promote The Critic and decided that a film festival would be a good way to introduce Sherman. Matt Groening, creator of The Simpsons has heavily criticized this episode, feeling that it was just an advertisement for The Critic, and that people would incorrectly associate the show with him. When he was unsuccessful in getting the program pulled, he had his name removed from the credits and went public with his concerns, openly criticizing James L. Brooks. The episode was directed by Susie Dietter and was the first episode to be written by Ken Keeler. Jon Lovitz, the star of The Critic, guest stars as Jay Sherman, while Maurice LaMarche (who was also a regular on The Critic) has a few minor roles. The episode received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom felt the crossover was out of place on the show, although Barney's film festival entry was well received. Plot In response to Springfield being named the least cultural city in the United States, a town meeting is held to decide a course of action, where Marge proposes that Springfield host a film festival showcasing films made by the townspeople. Marge is made the head of the festival's judging panel, and invites New York film critic Jay Sherman to be a special guest critic. Jay's presence makes Homer feel inadequate, so he convinces Marge to put him on the judging panel. The film festival commences, and many of the townspeople, including Mr. Burns and Hans Moleman, enter films. Festival attendees are particularly touched by Barney Gumble's artistic introspective film about alcoholism, titled Pukahontas, which Marge and Jay foresee to be the eventual winner. Burns' film, directed by Steven Spielberg's non-union Mexican counterpart \\"Se√±or Spielbergo\\", is A Burns for All Seasons, a big-budget pastiche of famous Hollywood productions intended to glorify him; the film is rejected by the audience. He bribes two of the judges, Krusty the Clown and Mayor Quimby, to vote for it, leading to a deadlock. Left with the tie-breaking vote, Homer enthusiastically votes for Hans' aptly-named Man Getting Hit by Football, but Marge and Jay convince him to reconsider and Pukahontas is named the winner. Barney declares that his victory has inspired him to give up drinking, but immediately forgets his promise when Quimby reveals his prize to be a lifetime supply of Duff Beer. Sherman prepares to return to New York, and the Simpsons thank him for his help in making the festival a success. Marge suggests that Mr. Burns has learned a lesson that you cannot bribe everyone. Contrary to her statement, he submits A Burns for All Seasons to the Academy Awards; due to his bribing of everyone in Hollywood, he is nominated an Oscar for Best Actor. At the ceremony, the winner is announced to be George C. Scott, based on his performance in a remake of Man Getting Hit by Football, angering Burns further. Production alt=A man with glasses and a red shirt is sitting in front of a microphone. The Critic was a short-lived animated series that revolved around the life of movie critic Jay Sherman. It was created by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had previously written for The Simpsons but left after the fourth season, and executive produced by James L. Brooks. Jon Lovitz, who had previously guest starred in several episodes of The Simpsons, starred as Jay Sherman, and it also featured the voices of The Simpsons regulars Nancy Cartwright, Doris Grau, and Russi Taylor. It was first broadcast on ABC in January 1994, and was well received by critics. However, the series did not catch on with viewers and it was put on hiatus after six weeks. It returned in June 1994 and completed airing its initial production run. For the second season of The Critic, James L. Brooks cut a deal with the Fox network to have the series switch over. The episode was pitched by Brooks, who had wanted a crossover that would help launch The Critic on Fox, and he thought having a film festival in Springfield would be a good way to introduce Sherman.Jean, Al (2005). Commentary for \\"A Star Is Burns\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. After Brooks pitched the episode, the script was written by Ken Keeler.Keeler, Ken (2005). Commentary for \\"A Star Is Burns\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Although David Mirkin was executive producer for most of the sixth season, the episode was executive produced by Al Jean and Mike Reiss. Jay Sherman's appearance was given a makeover: he was made yellow and given an overbite. The episode contains a meta-reference to the fact that it is a crossover episode in a conversation Bart has with Sherman: *[Bart is watching television] Announcer: Coming up next, The Flintstones meet The Jetsons. *Bart: Uh oh. I smell another cheap cartoon crossover. *[Homer enters the room with Jay] Homer: Bart Simpson, meet Jay Sherman, the critic. *Jay: Hello. *Bart: Hey man, I really love your show. I think all kids should watch it! [turns away] Ew, I suddenly feel so dirty. The joke was pitched by Al Jean.Reiss, Mike (2005). Commentary for \\"A Star Is Burns\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Alongside Jon Lovitz, the episode guest stars Maurice LaMarche, a regular on The Critic, who voices George C. Scott as well as Jay Sherman's belch. Phil Hartman also makes a brief appearance as an actor resembling Charlton Heston portraying Judah Ben-Hur in Mr. Burns' film. Rainier Wolfcastle's line, \\"on closer inspection, these are loafers\\", was ad- libbed by Dan Castellaneta who was providing the voice of the character on a temporary track. It was later re-recorded by Wolfcastle's normal voice actor, Harry Shearer.Castellaneta, Dan (2005). Commentary for \\"A Star Is Burns\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Cultural references The Imperial March from The Empire Strikes Back is played as Mr. Burns is introduced. The song the \\"Rappin' Rabbis\\" play in the opening moments of the episode is a parody of \\"U Can't Touch This\\" by MC Hammer. The opening of Bart's film The Eternal Struggle is a reference to The Amazing Criswell's narration in Plan 9 from Outer Space. Barney's film contains references to Koyaanisqatsi, and the music of the film, which was composed by Philip Glass. Marge crosses out Martin Scorsese's name on the list of critics she plans to invite, and replaces it with Homer's. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"A Star Is Burns\\" finished 57th in the ratings for the week of February 27 to March 5, 1995. The episode was the third highest rated show on the Fox network that week, beaten only by Melrose Place and Beverly Hills, 90210. The Critic, which premiered on Fox just after this episode, finished 64th. On March 12, 2002, the episode was released in the United States on a DVD collection titled The Simpsons Film Festival, along with the season eleven episode \\"Beyond Blunderdome\\", the season four episode \\"Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie\\", and the season seven episode \\"22 Short Films About Springfield\\". The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote, \\"Jay Sherman perhaps proves here, even more so than in The Critic, just why that show failed. He's too flawed to be likeable.\\" They added, \\"Barney's film is magnificent, but it's easy to see why Homer wants Hans Moleman to be the winner.\\" Adam Finley of TV Squad wrote, \\"the episode, even if I didn't care for it as a whole, does have moments that are still very Simpson-y, and still very funny. Jay's appearance, however, casts a shadow over everything that tends to leave a bad taste in my mouth.\\" Todd Gilchrist of IGN listed Barney's film as one of the best moments of the sixth season. The A.V. Club named Hans Moleman's line, \\"I was saying 'Boo- urns'\\", and Mr. Burns' line, \\"Then get me his non-union, Mexican equivalent!\\", as two quotations from The Simpsons that can be used in everyday situations. IGN ranked Jon Lovitz as the eighth best guest star in the show's history. =Controversy= Matt Groening, creator of The Simpsons, was critical of the episode when it first released. He felt that the crossover was a thirty-minute advertisement and blamed James L. Brooks, calling it an attempt to get attention for one of his unsuccessful shows. After he was unable to get the episode pulled, he decided to go public with his concerns shortly before the episode aired. He stated that his reasons for doing so were that he hoped Brooks would have a change of heart and pull the episode, and that \\"articles began to appear in several newspapers around the country saying that [Groening] created 'The Critic.'\\" Groening had his name removed from the credits, so he does not receive his normal \\"created by\\" and \\"developed by\\" credits that air at the end of the opening sequence. In response, Brooks said \\"I am furious with Matt, he's been going to everybody who wears a suit at Fox and complaining about this. When he voiced his concerns about how to draw The Critic into the Simpsons' universe he was right and we agreed to his changes. Certainly he's allowed his opinion, but airing this publicly in the press is going too far. [...] He is a gifted, adorable, cuddly ingrate. But his behavior right now is rotten.\\" Al Jean and Mike Reiss, creators of The Critic, had previously worked on The Simpsons and had executive produced the third and fourth seasons. Brooks said, \\"for years, Al and Mike were two guys who worked their hearts out on this show, staying up until 4 in the morning to get it right. The point is, Matt's name has been on Mike's and Al's scripts and he has taken plenty of credit for a lot of their great work. In fact, he is the direct beneficiary of their work. The Critic is their shot and he should be giving them his support.\\" Reiss stated that he was a \\"little upset\\" by Groening's actions and that \\"this taints everything at the last minute. [...] This episode doesn't say 'Watch The Critic all over it.\\" Jean added \\"What bothers me about all of this, is that now people may get the impression that this Simpsons episode is less than good. It stands on its own even if The Critic never existed.\\" alt=A video camera is being pointed at a bearded man who is wearing glasses. Some other people stand in the background. Groening was criticized for going public with his complaints. Ray Richmond of the Los Angeles Daily News wrote \\"Who's right? Well, Groening is probably correct in judging this an integrity issue. It's a fairly tacky bit of promotion, the kind generally beneath The Simpsons. But it's also true that little is accomplished by taking a gripe like this public. Quietly erasing his name from the credits would have been sufficient. [...] I admire the man's standing up for his creative rights. But I question the way he's gone about it.\\" As a result, Groening was absent from the episode's commentary for The Complete Sixth Season DVD boxset. =Legacy= In the end, The Critic was short-lived, broadcasting ten episodes on Fox before its cancellation. A total of only 23 episodes were produced, and it returned briefly in 2000 with a series of ten internet broadcast webisodes. The series has since developed a cult following thanks to reruns on Comedy Central and its complete series release on DVD. Jay Sherman has since become an infrequently recurring character on The Simpsons, appearing in speaking roles in \\"Hurricane Neddy\\" and \\"The Ziff Who Came to Dinner.\\"Weinstein, Josh (2006). Commentary for \\"Hurricane Neddy\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Idiomatic use of the phrase \\"say the quiet part loud\\" to mean to reveal an opinion usually expected to be kept from the public, derived from Krusty's line \\"I said the quiet part loud and the loud part quiet\\" in the episode, gained wide currency in the 2010s, chiefly in political discourse.

Ferhad Pasha Sokoloviƒá (, Bosnian:Ferhad-pa≈°a Sokoloviƒá) (died 1586) was a Bosniak and Ottoman general and statesman from Bosnia. He was the last sanjakbey of Bosnia and first beylerbey of Bosnia. Origin Born into the Bosniak Sokoloviƒá family, he was, like his close relative Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha (Mehmed-pa≈°a Sokoloviƒá) abducted as part of the dev≈üirme system of collection of Christian boys to be raised to serve in the janissary corps, Islamized and recruited into Ottoman service. While one part of the family became Islamized, the other stayed Christian; notably, another relative (possibly Mehmed's brother), Makarije Sokoloviƒá, was appointed as a Patriarch by Mehmed Pasha, who with the support of the Sultan had revived the Patriarchate of Peƒá. Sanjakbey of Klis Ferhad Pasha was governor of the Sanjak of Klis between 1566 and 1574. Nothing much is known during his rule in Klis. Sanjakbey of Bosnia Ferhat Pasha Mosque was destroyed in the city of Banja Luka during the Bosnian War (1992-95). Then he moved back to Bosnia, and was one of the founding fathers of Banja Luka, the second largest city in modern Bosnia and Herzegovina. There, he built over 200 buildings ranging from artisan and sales shops to wheat warehouses, baths and mosques. Among more important commissions were the Ferhadija and Arnaudija mosques during which construction a plumbing infrastructure was laid that served surrounding residential areas. He moved the seat of Bosnia from Travnik to Banja Luka. In 1576‚Äì77, he conquered the towns of Mutnica, Ostro≈æac, Podzvizd, Kladu≈°a, Peƒái, and other towns to the Kupa. Already by springtime 1577, he settled Serb families from Serbia to Bosnia around reconstructed towns in those areas to boost the population. Ferhad reformed Bosnia and made Banja Luka its capital for a couple of decades then it was returned back to Sarajevo. Beylerbey of Bosnia In 1580 Ferhad reformed Bosnia from a Rumelian Sanjak to its own Eyalet, he became the first governor of the newly formed Bosnia Eyalet, as beylerbey (also referred to as \\"pasha\\") which ceded from the Rumelia Eyalet as its own province. The Bosnia Eyalet (or Pashaluk) comprised a total of ten sanjaks: Sanjak of Bosnia (central province), Sanjak of Herzegovina, Sanjak of Vuƒçitrn, Sanjak of Prizren, Sanjak of Klis, Sanjak of Krka, Sanjak of Pojega and Sanjak of Pakrac. The sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Pakrac was Ali-beg, brother of Ferhad Pasha Sokoloviƒá. Siege of Gvozdansko Ferhad Pasha Sokoloviƒá with 10,000 soldiers organized three major assaults and tried to take Gvozdansko Castle in the Kingdom of Croatia in the Habsburg Monarchy. Finally, when the Ottomans entered the castle gates, all the defending forces were already dead of wounds, hunger and cold. The Siege of Gvozdansko ended with an Ottoman victory on 13 January 1578. Ferhad Pasha was so moved by their bravery that they were conceded a Christian burial and the local population freed from taxes. Death Ferhad died in Budim (Buda) in the year 1586, he requested when he died that his body must be moved to Banja Luka the city he himself built from the ground. He was probably buried near his Ferhadija mosque in Banja Luka.

The House of the Virgin Mary (Turkish: Meryemana Evi or Meryem Ana Evi, \\"Mother Mary's House\\") is a Catholic shrine located on Mt. Koressos (Turkish: B√ºlb√ºldaƒüƒ±, \\"Mount Nightingale\\") in the vicinity of Ephesus, from Sel√ßuk in Turkey.Frommer's Turkey by Lynn A. Levine 2010 pages 254-255 The house was discovered in the 19th century by following the descriptions in the reported visions of Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich (1774‚Äì1824), a Roman Catholic nun and visionary, which were published as a book by Clemens Brentano after her death. While the Catholic Church has never pronounced in favour or against the authenticity of the house, it nevertheless has maintained a steady flow of pilgrimage since its discovery. Anne Catherine Emmerich was beatified by Pope John Paul II on October 3, 2004. Catholic pilgrims visit the house based on the belief that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was taken to this stone house by Saint John and lived there for the remainder of her earthly life.The Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume XIV, Copyright ¬© 1912 by Robert Appleton Company, Online Edition Copyright ¬© 2003 by K.

Antony John Alaharasan 2006 page 38 The shrine has merited several papal Apostolic Blessings and visits from several Popes including John Paul II and Benedict XVI. Description of the site The Interior of the house. On the way to the shrine, visitors pass a key hole- shaped baptismal pool, larger than the one located at the basilica in Ephesus. It is thought that an early community of Christians may have lived or were baptized here in seclusion in order to escape the nearby Romans. The shrine itself is not extensively large, but may rather be described as a modest chapel. The preserved stones and construction date back into the Apostolic Age, as consistent with other preserved buildings from that time, but with minor additions such as garden landscapes and devotional additions outside the shrine. Upon entrance to the chapel, a pilgrim is met by one single large room where an altar along with a large statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary is prominently displayed in the center. On the right side, a smaller room lies ----traditionally associated with the actual room where the Virgin Mary is believed to have slept. Marian tradition holds that some form of running water used to flow like a canal in the smaller room where the Virgin Mary slept and rested, leading to the present drinking fountain outside the building structure. Meryemana, the wishing wall Wishing Wall Outside the shrine is a particular \\"wishing wall\\" which pilgrims have used by tying their personal intentions on paper or fabric. Various types of florals and fruits are grown nearby, and additional lighting has been installed within the vicinity of the shrine for further monitoring of the site. A water fountain or well is also located nearby, believed by some pilgrims to have miraculous powers of healing or fertility. Description in Germany At the beginning of the 19th century, Anne Catherine Emmerich, a bedridden Augustinian nun in Germany, reported a series of visions in which she recounted the last days of the life of Jesus, and details of the life of Mary, his mother.Emmerich, Anna Catherine: The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ page viii Emmerich was ill for a long period of time in the farming community of D√ºlmen but was known in Germany as a mystic and was visited by a number of notable figures.Vatican Biography An 18th century drawing of Anne Catherine Emmerich One of Emmerich's visitors was the author Clemens Brentano who after a first visit stayed in D√ºlmen for five years to see Emmerich every day and transcribe the visions she reported.Clemens Brentano by John F. Fetzer 1981 page 146 After Emmerich's death, Brentano published a book based on his transcriptions of her reported visions, and a second book was published based on his notes after his own death. One of Emmerich's accounts was a description of the house the Apostle John had built in Ephesus for Mary, the mother of Jesus, where she had lived to the end of her life. Emmerich provided a number of details about the location of the house, and the topography of the surrounding area:The Life of the Blessed Virgin Mary by Anna Emmerich 2009 Chapter XVIII Section 2: Mary's House in Ephesus page 377 Emmerich also described the details of the house: that it was built with rectangular stones, that the windows were high up near the flat roof and that it consisted of two parts with a hearth at the center of the house. She further described the location of the doors, the shape of the chimney, etc. The book containing these descriptions was published in 1852 in Munich, Germany. Discovery in Turkey Sister Marie de Mandat-Grancey On October 18, 1881, relying on the descriptions in the book by Brentano based on his conversations with Emmerich, a French priest, the Abb√© Julien Gouyet discovered a small stone building on a mountain overlooking the Aegean Sea and the ruins of ancient Ephesus in Turkey. He believed it was the house described by Emmerich and where the Virgin Mary had lived the final years of her life.The Ancient Traditions of the Virgin Mary's Dormition and Assumption by Stephen J.

The house is called Panaya Kapulu (\\"Doorway to the Virgin\\").Poulin, Eugene P., \\"The Holy Virgin's House: The True Story of Its Discovery\\", Istanbul: 1999 Every year pilgrims made a pilgrimage to the site on August 15, the date on which most of the Christian world celebrated Mary's Dormition/Assumption.The Blessed Virgin's House At Ephesus by Robert Larson (published as an endnote to Volume IV of The Life of Jesus Christ and Biblical Revelations by Anne Catherine Emmerich (TAN Books, 2004)). Sister Marie de Mandat-Grancey was named Foundress of Mary's House by the Catholic Church and was responsible for acquiring, restoring and preserving Mary's House and surrounding areas of the mountain from 1891 until her death in 1915.The Life of Sr. Marie de Mandat- Grancey & Mary's House in Ephesus by Carl G. Schulte 2011, Saint Benedict Press The discovery revived and strengthened a Christian tradition dating from the 12th century, 'the tradition of Ephesus', which has competed with the older 'Jerusalem tradition' about the place of the Blessed Virgin's dormition. Due to the actions of Pope Leo XIII in 1896 and Pope John XXIII in 1961, the Catholic Church first removed plenary indulgences from the Church of the Dormition in Jerusalem and then bestowed them for all time to pilgrims to Mary's House in Ephesus.Euzet, J., \\"History of the House of the Blessed Virgin near Ephesus (1891-1961)\\", Vincentian Archives, 1961. Archaeology The restored portion of the structure has been distinguished from the original remains of the structure by a line painted in red. Some have expressed doubt about the site, as the tradition of Mary's association with Ephesus \\"arose only in the twelfth century.\\" Supporters base their belief on the presence of the 5th century Church of Mary, the first basilica in the world dedicated to the Virgin Mary, in Ephesus.  Gospel and patristic authors  Saint Epiphanius of Salamis in the fourth century was the first author in mentioning the traditional faith of the Assumption of Mary in body and soul to the Heaven, and coming from Ephesus. Like many other patristic authors, he based this assumption on the Gospel of John chapter 19,18-30, with Jesus on the Cross asking to the Apostle and Evangelist to take care of the Saint Mother of God into his home. Again, after the death on the Cross and the resurrection, Jesus has shown his living body, both human with soul, and angelic-spiritual, the same of the Transfiguration of Jesus in the Mount Tabor before his Passion and the Crucifixion: has shown it in Emmaus, then to the Doubting Thomas, and during forty days to all the twelve Apostles. After Pentecost and the Ascension, they receive the Holy Spirit in order to fulfill the role of diffusing to all the human beings what they have seen and heard by themselves. By virtue of all this, it becomes reasonable to believe that the first apostolic church has progressively moved far away from the Saint City, with the Blessed Virgin Mary coming with them. Position of the Roman Catholic Church Statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary in her house exterior. Wishes papers in House of Virgin Mary The Roman Catholic Church has never pronounced on the authenticity of the house, for lack of scientifically acceptable evidence. It has, however, from the blessing of the first pilgrimage by Pope Leo XIII in 1896, taken a positive attitude towards the site. Pope Pius XII, in 1951, following the definition of the dogma of the Assumption in 1950, elevated the house to the status of a Holy Place, a privilege later made permanent by Pope John XXIII. The site is visited and venerated by Muslims as well as Christians. Pilgrims drink from a spring under the house which is believed to have healing properties. A liturgical ceremony is held here every year on August 15 to commemorate the Assumption of Mary. =Papal visits= Pope Paul VI visited the shrine on July 26, 1967, and Pope John Paul II on November 30, 1979. Pope Benedict XVI visited this shrine on November 29, 2006, during his four-day pastoral trip to Turkey.

This film, released in 2002, is mostly in English language. Plot It is the story of an ex-convict, Simon (Keith Carradine), who after returning to Iceland where his mother was born, to visit relatives, looks for the loneliest place in the world to commit suicide. In a small village he meets D√∫a (Margr√©t Vilhj√°lmsd√≥ttir), an Icelandic young lady, who is found to be an interesting, rather strange woman by Simon. D√∫a has a caged falcon that she hopes to tame, but they get into trouble as it is illegal to possess this kind of animal in captivity. In the story, Simon is the embodiment of a jailed bird, one of the falcons and as she is an air sign, they join in a relationship ruled by Simon's belief that she is his illegitimate daughter. Surrounded by tension between them, Simon serves as a protective figure to D√∫a, who keeps him from committing suicide. The couple escape to Hamburg, Germany, to start all over again. The protagonists' behaviours are opposite to each other: Simon is down to earth and finds himself awkward by D√∫a's eccentric beliefs in astrology, who considers Simon as a typical Scorpio and thus avoids deepening into a more serious relationship, partly because of the feeling of his paternity. D√∫a's falcon, that she nourished and protected when her uncle found it with a broken wing, has a high value to her, as she considers it last remnant of the beloved life in Iceland. The falcon travels with them on their escape and has a high monetary value. Later, as D√∫a wasted their money, Simon tries to sell the falcon in order to cover their expenditure, but he is cheated by some crooked Germans and the falcon is stolen.

He started a new parish in Poquoson, Virginia from the beginning and a church was built there. He led the Church of the Holy Parish toward retiring a large debt from its expansion. Father Quinlan was instrumental in providing a Haitian village with a freshwater well and a school by partnering their parish with Holy family. He was also the president of the priest senate in the Richmond diocese. Controversy The Bishop of Richmond, Most Rev. Francis X. DiLorenzo, retired Father Quinlan in June, 2005 from service at Holy Family in Virginia Beach. A Christmas Eve homily, which made references to Mary's humanly giving birth to Jesus, offended some members of the parish and was reported to Bishop DiLorenzo. However many members of the Parish stood up for and appealed to the Bishop to retain Father Quinlan. Father Quinlan's homiletic language was vulgar and disrespectful, and there were some instances of sacrilegious behavior at Mass. According to local newspapers, Father Quinlan drove a Volkswagen down the aisle during a Palm Sunday procession at Good Shepherd Catholic Church.

A counterion (pronounced as two words, i.e. \\"counter\\" \\"ion\\", and sometimes written as two words) is the ion that accompanies an ionic species in order to maintain electric neutrality. In table salt (NaCl), the sodium ion (positively charged) is the counterion for the chlorine ion (negatively charged) and vice versa. A counterion will be more commonly referred to as an anion or a cation, depending on whether it is negatively or positively charged. Thus, the counterion to an anion will be a cation, and vice versa. Interfacial chemistry Counterions are the mobile ions in ion exchange polymers and colloids. Ion exchange resins are polymers with a net negative or positive charge. Cation exchange resins consist of an anionic polymer with countercations, typically Na+ (sodium). The resin has a higher affinity for highly charged countercations, for example by Ca2+ (calcium) in the case of water softening. Correspondingly, anion exchange resins are typically provided in the form of chloride Cl‚àí, which is a highly mobile couteranion. Counterions are used in phase-transfer catalysis. In a typical application lipophilic countercation such as benzalkonium solubilizes reagents in organic solvents. Solution chemistry Solubility of salts in organic solvents is a function of both the cation and the anion. The solubility of cations in organic solvents can be enhanced when the anion is lipophilic. Similarly, the solubility of anions in organic solvents is enhanced with lipophilic cations. The most common lipophilic cations are quaternary ammonium cations, called \\"quat salts\\". File:Lithium- tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate-2D-skeletal.pngLithium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate is the lithium salt of a highly lipophilic tetraarylborate anion, often referred to as a weakly coordinating anion. File:Tetraphenylborate.pngTetraphenylborate is less lipophilic than the perfluorinated derivative, but widely used as a precipitating agent. File:PF6.pngHexafluorophosphate is a common weakly coordinating anion. File:Tetrafluoroborate-ion-3D-balls.pngAs illustrated by the small counteranion tetrafluoroborate (), lipophilic cations tend to be symmetric and singly charged. File:PPNCl.pngBis(triphenylphosphine)iminium chloride is the chloride salt of a bulky lipophilic phosphonium cation [Ph3PNPPh3]+. File:PPh4Cl.pngTetraphenylphosphonium chloride (C6H5)4PCl, abbreviated Ph4PCl or PPh4Cl is the chloride of a symmetrical phosphonium cation that is often used in organometallic chemistry. The arsonium salt is also well known. File:Tetrabutylammonium bromide.svgThe bromide salt of tetrabutylammonium, one of the most common counter cations. Many analogous \\"quat salts\\" are known. File:Bis(12-crown-4)lithium-cation-from-xtal-3D-balls-B.pngAlkali metal cations bound by crown ethers are common lipophilic countercations, as illustrated by [Li(12-crown-4)2]+. Many cationic organometallic complexes are isolated with inert, noncoordinating counterions. Ferrocenium tetrafluoroborate is one such example. Electrochemistry In order to achieve high ionic conductivity, electrochemical measurements are conducted in the presence of excess electrolyte. In water the electrolyte is often a simple salt such as potassium chloride. For measurements in nonaqueous solutions, salts composed of both lipophilic cations and anions are employed, e.g., tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate. Even in such cases potentials are influenced by ion-pairing, an effect that is accentuated in solvents of low dielectric constant.Geiger, W. E., Barri√®re, F., \\"Organometallic Electrochemistry Based on Electrolytes Containing Weakly-Coordinating Fluoroarylborate Anions\\", Acc. Chem. Res. 2010, 43, 1030. Counterion stability For many applications, the counterion simply provides charge and lipophilicity that allows manipulation of its partner ion. The counterion is expected to be chemically inert. For counteranions, inertness is expressed in terms of low Lewis basicity. The counterions are ideally rugged and unreactive. For quaternary ammonium and phosphonium countercations, inertness is related to their resistance of degradation by strong bases and strong nucleophiles.

Interior of St. Martin's Cathedral, Utrecht, by Saenredam Hoofwacht on the left in Haarlem - 1629 Pieter Jansz. Saenredam (9 June 1597 - buried 31 May 1665) was a painter of the Dutch Golden Age, known for his distinctive paintings of whitewashed church interiors such as Interior of St Bavo's Church in Haarlem and Interior of the Sint-Odulphuskerk in Assendelft. Biography Saenredam was born in Assendelft, the son of the Northern Mannerist printmaker and draughtsman Jan Pietersz Saenredam whose sensuous naked goddesses are in great contrast with the work of his son. In 1612 Saenredam moved permanently to Haarlem, where he became a pupil of Frans de Grebber. In 1614 he became a member of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke.Pieter Jansz. Saenredam entry in the RKD A drawing in the British Museum by his friend Jacob Van Campen shows him to be very short and hunch backed. He died in Haarlem. Saenredam was a contemporary of the painter-architects Jacob van Campen, Salomon de Bray, and Pieter Post. Saenredam specialized in the representation of church interiors. These pictures were based on precise measurements of the building and meticulously-rendered sketches, done on site, in pencil, pen, and chalk, after which washes were applied. Painting took place in the studio, often years after the studies were made. Saenredam's emphasis on even light and geometry is brought out by comparing his works with those of the rather younger Emanuel de Witte, who included people, contrasts of light and such clutter of church furniture as remained in Calvinist churches, all usually ignored by Saenredam. Unlike de Witte's, Saenredam's views are usually roughly aligned with a main axis of the church. Saenredam's paintings frequently show medieval churches, usually Gothic, but sometimes late Romanesque, which had been stripped bare of their original decorations after the iconoclasm of the Protestant Reformation. Although Utrecht was the centre of the remaining Catholic population of the mainly Calvinist United Provinces, all the old churches were retained by the Protestants. The drawing for Saenredam's Interior of St. Martin's Cathedral, Utrecht (above) is typical. As a Catholic church the Cathedral had been highly decorated. Then, in the Dutch Revolt the church fell into Protestant hands, it was ‚Äòcleaned‚Äô of Catholic influences. The altarpieces and statuary were removed, and the walls and ceiling were white washed. Alternatively, the paintings of church interiors by Saenredam and other 17th-century Dutch painters have been interpreted as having less to do with religion and more with the new-found interest in perspective and with the Dutch interpretation (known as Dutch Classicism) of Palladio‚Äôs theories of proportion, balance and symmetry.Time Line of Art History, Low Countries, 1600-1800 A.D. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. (retrieved on 2007-09-13) Jacob van Campen's Stadhuis (Amsterdam City Hall), now better known as het Koninklijk Paleis (the Royal Palace of Amsterdam), is the pinnacle of Dutch Classicism in the 17th Century. In any case, Saenredam wanted to record this time of change by documenting the country‚Äôs buildings. Many artists before him had specialized in imaginary and fanciful architecture, but Saenredam was one of the first to focus on existing buildings. According to the J. Paul Getty Trust \\"Saenredam‚Äôs church paintings...owe their poetry to his remarkable blend of fact and fiction. He began by making site drawings of buildings that record measurements and detail with archaeological thoroughness.\\" This meticulous preparation helped him to create such accurate and enchanting paintings. The measurements aided him in using scientific linear perspective, just like Andrea Pozzo. He was able to use his measurements to create a realistic image with depth. There are a small number of Saenredam's works in British collections but the Utrecht Archives houses a large number of Saenredam's drawings. In 2000-2001 the Centraal Museum at Utrecht held a major exhibition of his drawings and paintings. Perhaps his best known works are a matching pair of oil paintings both titled Interior of the Buurkerk, Utrecht. One hangs in London's National Gallery, the other in the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas. In their simplicity and semi-abstract formalism, they foreshadow more modern works such as those of Mondrian and Feininger. In July 2012 a picture of Saenredam's village at Assendelft was sold at Christie's for more than ¬£3,500,000. Six months earlier it was entered into a Christie's sale advertised as by a follower of Saenredam with an estimate of between ¬£3,000-5,000 before being withdrawn from sale.

It was the only major skirmish of the Revolutionary War fought in the northern Delaware Valley. The battle was a decisive British victory, as the colonial militia was hastily assembled, ill-equipped, and inexperienced. Brant's raid Although British forces were largely concentrated on Manhattan Island, Joseph Brant, a Mohawk war chief and a Captain in the British Army, was sent along with his Brant's Volunteers on a quest for provisions, to gather intelligence on the Delaware in the vicinity of Minisink, and to disrupt the upcoming American Sullivan Campaign. In July 1779, he received word that Kazimierz Pulaski's forces had moved into Pennsylvania, leaving much of the Delaware Valley undefended. Brant led his force of Loyalists and Iroquois raiders through the valley, with the goal of seizing supplies and demoralizing the colonists. With Brant's force of 60 tribesmen and 27 Tories disguised as Indians in pursuit, the settlers were forced to flee to more populated areas. On July 20, he reached Peenpack, which he attacked immediately. Brant ordered that \\"they should not kill any women or children\\" or Loyalists and to take prisoner any who surrendered. His raid was a crushing success and, leaving Fort Decker and the settlement in ruins, Brant and his force continued north along the Delaware River. Battle of Minisink Later that day, riders from Peenpack reached the village of Goshen, telling of Brant's raid and the destruction of the town. A militia formed immediately, under the reluctant command of Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Tusten. Tusten was strongly opposed to pursuing the raiders, as he knew they would be no match for the British and Iroquois soldiers, and he suggested waiting for reinforcements from the Continental Army. However, the majority of the public and the militia underestimated the fighting ability of the Iroquois and demanded immediate retribution. Outvoted, Tusten agreed to set out the following morning. They met up with elements of the Fourth Orange County Regiment ordered from Warwick by George Washington and led by Colonel John Hathorn. Colonel Hathorn assumed command and marched for the Delaware with a force of about 120 minutemen. John Hathorn led the Fourth Orange County Regiment. On the morning of July 22, the militia moved into position in the hills above the Delaware River, intending to ambush Brant's forces who were crossing at Minisink Ford. Hathorn split them into a group of skirmishers and two units comprising the main force. Before the ambush was set, however, Captain Bezaleel Tyler III of the militia, an experienced Indian fighter, fired at an Indian scout in Brant's party. This alerted Brant to the trap, and he quickly outflanked the two groups of colonials, many of whom fled. Separated from the main unit and with his forces scattered, Hathorn was unable to regroup his men for a counterattack. Some of his men were forced to retreat, leaving the rest of the militia surrounded and outnumbered. After several hours of continuous volleys, insufficient ammunition and close quarters caused the battle to devolve into hand-to-hand combat, at which the Iroquois excelled. At least 48 militiamen were killed, including Tusten himself. Brant's men gave no quarter to the wounded and captured, killing and scalping over 40 of them. One prisoner, Captain John Wood, was spared because Brant mistakenly believed him to be a fellow Mason.Barbara Graymont, The Iroquois in the American Revolution, p. 201 Brant's force, on the other hand, is believed to have lost only about seven men. Brant wrote of his casualties that three were killed and of the 10 wounded, 4 were dangerously wounded and possibly could not survive. Although badly wounded, Hathorn survived, returning to Warwick to write his report of the loss to his superiors. Aftermath Monument at site of the battle, now part of the Minisink Battleground County Park. After the battle, Brant and his men forded the Delaware and continued back to the ruins of Oquaga.Kelsay, pg. 252 The raid failed to disrupt the Sullivan Campaign and three weeks later, the Continental Army sent 3,000 troops into upstate New York, destroying every Iroquois village in their path. Brant finally met his defeat in late August at the Battle of Newtown. The people of the Precinct of Goshen (which preceded the forming of the Towns of Orange County) were unable to bury their dead for 43 years, as the battlefield was too distant and the way too dangerous. Some of the soldiers' widows attempted the trip, but were forced to turn back. In 1822, a committee was formed to travel to the battlefield and comb the area for remains. The few bones recovered were buried in a mass grave, first in Barryville and later moved to the village of Goshen. A stone obelisk was erected for the centennial of the battle, engraved with the names of the dead.Find A Grave website In 1847, a burial was discovered in Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania that is believed to be the remains of a casualty of the Battle of Minisink. The site now serves as a memorial tomb for unknown Revolutionary War soldiers. Today, the site is Minisink Battleground County Park in Sullivan County a couple of miles north of the Hamlet of Barryville near the Roebling Bridge. There are no man-made structures contemporary to the battle, but the park contains several trails, monuments, picnic areas, and a visitors' center.

The Chairperson of the Committee is Dr Gowtam Raj Chintaram of Mauritius, with the Secretary being Mr Patson Malisa of South Africa. Guided by the deliberations of the Nairobi Meeting on the operationalization of Sectoral Cluster Committees as stipulated in Article 11 of the ECOSOCC Statutes, the Infrastructure and Energy cluster convened in Cairo for the Constitutive Meeting for the Activation of the Sectoral Cluster Committee.Constitutive Meeting of the Core Group for the Operationalization of the ECOSOCC Infrastructure & Energy Cluster http://www.au.int/en/sites/default/files/documents/30837-doc- ecosocc_clusters_operationalization_infrastructure.pdf Dr Chintaram gave the Keynote Address in which he thanked the Presiding Officer, the Secretariat and the staff of both CIDO and ECOSOCC for their efforts to ensure the successful activation of our cluster. He went on to highlight the focus areas of initial operation to be partnerships with Continental Stakeholders, Air Access, Sustainable Transport, Communication, Renewable Energy and Tourism. He emphasized that Agenda 2063 would be the guiding document throughout deliberations for the work plan. The session then received three presentations from Cluster members, Mr. Samuel Dotse, Dr Malick Sane and Mr. Patson Malisa. Mr Dotse gave a presentation on Energy Solutions in the wake of Climate Change. He emphasized on the need of the IE cluster to adopt a climate- sensitive approach in its work-plans and future advocacies. Dr Sane expanded on the issues surrounding Sustainable Transport Policy in Africa. In his presentation he gave an overview on the Negative Externalities of transport in Africa, the Concept, Policy, Promotion and Practice of Sustainable Transport in Africa. Mr Patson Malisa gave a speech on enhancing Air Transport to realise the goals of Agenda 2063. He advocated that the infrastructure and Energy Cluster Deliberates on instituting a mechanism for establishing a policy position on meeting the goals of Air Transport Market Liberation based on the ensuring of Enhanced Cooperation, Cost Effectiveness, Security and Succession He highlighted the need for the IE Cluster to encourage the members of the African Union to move forward in implementation of the Yamoussoukro Declaration by establishing a Single Air Transport Market as affirmed by Assembly/AU/Dec.1(XXIV): Declaration on the Establishment of a Single Air Transport Market. The opening session was followed by two extended working sessions over a two-day period. Subsequently, the Cluster meeting was concluded on 8 April 2016 with the following conclusions and recommendations: I. On the Mandate of the Infrastructure and Energy Cluster a) The Committee recognized that its mandate of operation was derived from the ECOSOCC Statutes and specifically Article 11(c). Article 11 provided the legal framework for the establishment of ten (10) Sectoral Cluster Committees as key operational mechanisms of ECOSOCC to formulate opinions and provide inputs into the policies and programmes of the African Union. Article 11(c) then spells out the core areas of the mandate of the Infrastructure and Energy Cluster as including Energy, Transport, Communication, Infrastructure and Tourism etc. As such, we have also embraced the need for us to be conscious of the environmental impact of Infrastructure Development on Climate Change and factors propagating it. Thus, our efforts are to be in promotion of ensuring that these developments are implemented in the spirit of the African Common Position on Climate Change. This will be manifested in the formulation of policies on key infrastructure issues such as the production of an Africa Sustainable Transport Policy etc. b) The Committee also recognized the need for its programmes and workplan to give priority to programs on forging partnerships with Continental Stakeholders, Air Access and transport, Climate Change, Renewable Energy and Tourism. Agenda 2063 was the guiding document throughout deliberations for the work plan. II. On Structure and Category of Membership The Cluster devised a generic framework for Sectoral Cluster Committees and proposed the same to be adopted by other clusters to ensure homogeneity in cluster composition and operations. The core team of members present for the meeting would henceforth be known as Cluster Steering Group (CSG). It was agreed that the Cluster would distribute its membership in the following order: ‚Ä¢ Cluster Steering Group ‚Ä¢ Cluster Members ‚Ä¢ Pro-Bono Experts and Consultants The Cluster Steering group would comprise the following portfolios: \\\\- Chairperson \\\\- Cluster Secretary \\\\- Coordinator for CSO & Stakeholders Engagement \\\\- Coordinator for Financing, Projects and Monitoring \\\\- Coordinator for Strategic Planning & Partnerships \\\\- Coordinator for Research and Policy III. CSO Engagement CSO Mapping would be conducted via the Infrastructure and Energy Webpage via google links as well as social media adverts as the budget permits. IV On Partnerships It was agreed that Phase 1 of our Partnerships strategy would be initiated from the month of May till June 2016. Amongst other stakeholders, we have identified The Africa Development Bank, NEPAD, The United Nations Commission for Africa, SADC and ECOWAS as partners for engagement in this phase. This phase will aim to enhance the capacity of the cluster for future collaborative work. We will also Launch a Phase 1 engagement of Research Institutions in the continent for collaborative efforts in attaining information for the producing of Advisory Opinions and Policy Briefs. The first institutions to be approached will be the Pan African University and the University of Energy and Natural Resources (Ghana). VI General Issues The CSG agreed to a communication strategy that embraces ICT platforms for the dissemination of information and regular contact amongst members of the Cluster. This would primarily be implemented through the already running ENS ( enterprise social networking) platform, Groupspaces set up for the Cluster. It was also agreed that a newsletter would be released periodically for the popularization of the work being conducted by the IE Cluster. It was further agreed that the CSG will meet in ordinary sessions twice a year.

Port Charlotte was named after Lady Charlotte Campbell Bury, the mother of its founder, William Frederick Campbell, and it was set up mainly to provide housing facilities for the Lochindaal Distillery work force. Parts of the former distillery buildings are now in use as Youth Hostel and Wildlife Centre. Others are currently used by a garage nearby. The remaining warehouses are currently owned and used by Bruichladdich distillery to mature their Port Charlotte heavily peated spirit, named in tribute to the village and original distillery.

Therefore the total space has dimension 2 + 1 = 3. In general, fiber bundles over the circle are a special case of mapping tori. Here is the construction: take the Cartesian product of a surface with the unit interval. Glue the two copies of the surface, on the boundary, by some homeomorphism. This homeomorphism is called the monodromy of the surface bundle. It is possible to show that the homeomorphism type of the bundle obtained depends only on the conjugacy class, in the mapping class group, of the gluing homeomorphism chosen. This construction is an important source of examples both in the field of low-dimensional topology as well as in geometric group theory. In the former we find that the geometry of the three- manifold is determined by the dynamics of the homeomorphism. This is the fibered part of William Thurston's geometrization theorem for Haken manifolds, whose proof requires the Nielsen‚ÄìThurston classification for surface homeomorphisms as well as deep results in the theory of Kleinian groups. In geometric group theory the fundamental groups of such bundles give an important class of HNN-extensions: that is, extensions of the fundamental group of the fiber (a surface) by the integers. A simple special case of this construction (considered in Henri Poincar√©'s foundational paper) is that of a torus bundle.

It was jokingly promoted as the best Icelandic-Japanese road movie of 1995.\\"10 great Icelandic films.\\" Sarah Lutton, BFI 23 January 2018 Synopsis Hirata is a successful Japanese businessman whose plan for a two- week winter holiday in Hawaii to play golf changes when his elderly grandfather reminds him that he should go to Iceland. Hirata's parents died there seven years ago, and the seven year death anniversary is a significant event in Japanese culture. Hirata must perform a ceremony in the river where they died after drowning in an avalanche ‚Äì the drowned must be fed by the surviving family members if they are to find peace. Hirata arrives in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland. His final destination is a remote river on the far side of the island. He encounters one mishap and misadventure after another. He first accidentally gets on a wrong bus filled with German tourists traveling to see the hot springs. He also confronts a language barrier; Hirata cannot speak any Icelandic, and knows very little English. After his first day's misadventures, Hirata decides to purchase an ancient, bright red Citro√´n DS to make the journey. During the long drive, Hirata meets several strange people along the way. These include the mystical woman who sells him the car, that only plays one radio station. Next, Hirata meets a local woman who collects photographs of funerals. The following day, Hirata meets Jack and Jill, two American hitchhikers, who turn out to be armed and dangerous fugitives who proceed to steal his car. Nearing his destination on foot, Hirata arrives in a small village where he meets an old man named Siggi, the owner of a local lodge who teaches Hirata how to drink the most potent alcoholic beverage in Iceland. After explaining his determination to travel to where his parents died, Hirata is aided by Siggi who borrows a pair of Icelandic horses from a local farmer, and the two of them travel on horseback to Hirata's destination. After riding across an ice cap glacier, over a ridge and into the valley where Hirata's parents died, he dismounts and tells Siggi that he must go on alone to complete his journey. After traversing a rickety bridge to the river, Hirata arrives at the river bank where he performs his cleansing ceremony at last. He then rejoins Siggi waiting for him and they both ride on their horses down a gully where they make it to a beach and the final shot shows them riding down the coast towards a nearby coastal village which hopefully will have a ferry to take Hirata back to Reykjavik and presumably back to Japan.

They became extinct before the period of global scientific exploration that started in the late 15th century. In other words, this list basically deals with extinctions between 40,000 BC and 1500 AD. For the purposes of this article, a \\"bird\\" is any member of the clade Neornithes, that is, any descendant of the most recent common ancestor of all currently living birds. Haast's eagle attacking New Zealand moa. The birds are known from their remains, which are subfossil (not fossilized, or not completely fossilized). Some are also known from folk memory, as in the case of Haast's eagle in New Zealand. As the remains are not completely fossilized, they may yield organic material for molecular analyses to provide additional clues for resolving their taxonomic affiliations. The extinction of the taxa in this list was coincident with the expansion of Homo sapiens beyond Africa and Eurasia, and in most cases, anthropogenic factors have played a crucial part in their extinction, be it through hunting, introduced predators or habitat alteration. It is notable that a large proportion of the species are from oceanic islands, especially in Polynesia. Bird taxa that evolved on oceanic islands are usually very vulnerable to hunting or predation by rats, cats, dogs or pigs ‚Äì animals commonly introduced by humans ‚Äì as they evolved in the absence of mammalian predators, and therefore have only rudimentary predator avoidance behavior. Many, especially rails, have additionally become flightless for the same reason and thus presented even easier prey. Taxon extinctions taking place before the Late Quaternary happened in the absence of significant human interference. Rather, reasons for extinction are stochastic abiotic events such as bolide impacts, climate changes, mass volcanic eruptions etc. Alternatively, species may have gone extinct due to evolutionary displacement by successor or competitor taxa ‚Äì it is notable for example that in the early Neogene, seabird biodiversity was much higher than today; this is probably due to competition by the radiation of marine mammals after that time. The relationships of these ancient birds are often hard to determine, as many are known only from very fragmentary remains and complete fossilization precludes analysis of information from DNA, RNA or protein sequencing.

Carroll Towing Co., 159 F.2d 169 (2d. Cir. 1947), is a decision from the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals that proposed a test to determine the standard of care for the tort of negligence. The judgment was written by Judge Learned Hand wherein he described what is now called the calculus of negligence or the Hand Test, a classic example of a balancing test. Background The case was the result of the sinking of the barge Anna C that took place on January 4, 1944 in New York Harbor.. The Pennsylvania Railroad Company chartered the Anna C from Conners Marine Company, which was loaded with flour owned by the United States. Before the accident, the Anna C was moored at Pier 52 on the North River along with several other barges.Feldman, supra, at 525-526. The barges at Pier 52 were tied together by mooring lines and one barge at Pier 52 was tied to another set of barges at the adjacent Public Pier.. On the day of the accident the tug Carroll was sent to remove a barge from the Public Pier. In the process of removing the barge, the line between the barges at Pier 52 and the barges at the Public Pier was removed. After the removal of the line, the barges at Pier 52 broke free. This resulted in the sinking of Anna C.Kelly, supra, at 736. The United States, lessee of the Anna C, sued Carroll Towing Co., owner of the Carroll in an indemnity action. Ruling The author of the opinion, Judge Learned Hand, stated that there was no general rule with which to deal with liability when a barge with no one on board breaks free and causes damage. Consequently, Judge Hand proposed an algebraic formula to determine if the standard of care has been met. :Since there are occasions when every vessel will break from her moorings, and since, if she does, she becomes a menace to those about her; the owner's duty, as in other similar situations, to provide against resulting injuries is a function of three variables: (1) The probability that she will break away; (2) the gravity of the resulting injury, if she does; (3) the burden of adequate precautions. Possibly it serves to bring this notion into relief to state it in algebraic terms: if the probability be called P; the injury, L; and the burden, B; liability depends upon whether B is less than L multiplied by P: i.e., whether B < PL. Simply put, the test says: If (Burden < Cost of Injury √ó Probability of occurrence), then the accused will not have met the standard of care required. If (Burden ‚â• Cost of injury √ó Probability of occurrence), then the accused may have met the standard of care. On the facts, the Court ruled that leaving a barge unattended during the daylight hours poses significant risk such that it would be fair to require a crew member to be aboard the ship. Thus, the accused was found liable for negligence for being absent from the ship without excuse. This case is most famous for its first expression of Judge Hand's formula, C > GL (cost is greater than gravity of loss) or in the more common shorthand, BPL. This formula was first suggested, however, in The T.J. Hooper,60 F.2d 737 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, . another tugboat case.

Carroll Towing Co."},{"id":"2011705","text":"thumb Johann \\"Jack\\" Unterweger (16 August 195129 June 1994) was an Austrian serial killer who committed murder in several countries. Initially convicted in 1974 of a single murder, Unterweger began to write extensively while in prison. His work gained the attention of the Austrian literary elite, who took it as evidence that he had been rehabilitated. After significant lobbying, Unterweger was released on parole in 1990. After his release, Unterweger became a minor celebrity and worked as a playwright and journalist, but within months he began to kill women serially. After being convicted of an additional nine murders in 1994, he committed suicide in prison by hanging himself.  Early life  Jack Unterweger was born in 1951 to Theresia Unterweger, a Viennese barmaid and waitress, and Jack Becker, American soldier whom she met in Trieste, Italy. Some sources describe his mother as a sex worker. Unterweger's mother was jailed for fraud while pregnant but was released and travelled to Graz, where he was born. After his mother was arrested again in 1953, Unterweger was sent to Carinthia to live with his grandfather, who was known as a \\"rough fellow\\" who regularly used his grandson to help him steal farm animals. Unterweger was in and out of prison for much of his youth. He worked as a waiter, but between 1966 and 1974 he was convicted sixteen times, mostly for theft-related offences, but also for pimping and sexual assault on a sex worker; he spent most of those eight years in jail. First murder conviction, imprisonment and release In 1974, Unterweger murdered 18-year- old German citizen Margaret Sch√§fer by strangling her with her own bra, and in 1976 he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. While imprisoned, he wrote short stories, poems, plays, and an autobiography, Purgatory or The Trip to Prison ‚Äì Report of a Guilty Man, that later served as the basis for a documentary. In 1985, a campaign to pardon and release Unterweger from prison began. Austrian President Rudolf Kirchschl√§ger (SP√ñ/√ñVP) refused the petition when presented to him, citing the court-mandated minimum of fifteen years in prison. Writers, artists, journalists and politicians agitated for a pardon, including the author and 2004 Nobel Prize winner Elfriede Jelinek; G√ºnter Grass; Peter Huemer; and the editor of the magazine Manuskripte, Alfred Kolleritsch. Unterweger was released on 23 May 1990, after the required minimum fifteen years of his life term. Upon his release, his autobiography was taught in schools and his stories for children were performed on Austrian radio. Unterweger himself hosted television programs which discussed criminal rehabilitation, and he worked as a reporter for the public broadcaster ORF, where he reported on stories concerning the very murders for which he was later found guilty.  Later murders  Law enforcement later found that Unterweger killed a young woman named Blanka Bockova in Czechoslovakia,Czech language article about the victim from Prague and seven more in Austria in 1990 (Brunhilde Masser, 39; Heidi Hammerer, 31; Elfriede Schrempf, 35; Silvia Zagler, 23; Sabine Moitzl, 25; Karin Eroglu-Sladky, 25; Regina Prem, 32) in the first year after his release, all garroted with their bras. In 1991, Unterweger was hired by an Austrian magazine to write about crime in Los Angeles, California and the differences between U.S. and European attitudes to prostitution. Unterweger met with local police, even going so far as to participate in a ride-along of the city's red light districts. During Unterweger's time in Los Angeles, three sex workers Shannon Exley, Irene Rodriguez, and Peggy Booth were beaten, sexually assaulted with tree branches, and strangled with their own bras. In Austria, Unterweger was suggested as a suspect for the sex worker murders. In the absence of other suspects, the police took a serious look at Unterweger and kept him under surveillance until he went to the U.S. ostensibly as a reporter observing nothing to connect him with the murders.  Arrest and death  Police in Graz eventually had enough evidence to issue a warrant for Unterweger's arrest, but he had fled by the time they entered his home. After law enforcement agencies chased him and his girlfriend, Bianca Mrak, through Switzerland, France, and the U.S., he was finally arrested by the U.S. Marshals in Miami, Florida on 27 February 1992. While a fugitive, he had called the Austrian media to try to convince them of his innocence. Unterweger was extradited to Austria on 27 May 1992, and charged with eleven homicides, including one which had occurred in Prague and three in Los Angeles. The jury found him guilty of nine murders by a 6:2 majority (sufficient for a conviction under Austrian law at the time). Based on psychiatric examination, Austrian psychiatrist Dr. Reinhard Haller diagnosed Unterweger with narcissistic personality disorder and presented his findings to the court on 20 June 1994. On 29 June 1994, he was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole. That night, Unterweger committed suicide at Graz-Karlau Prison by hanging himself with a rope made from shoelaces and a cord from the trousers of a track suit, using the same knot that was found on all the strangled sex workers. Prior to his death, Unterweger had asserted his intention to seek an appeal, and therefore, under Austrian law, his guilty verdict was not considered legally binding after his death, as it has not been reviewed and confirmed by the court.  In popular culture  In a 2008 performance, actor John Malkovich portrayed Unterweger's life in a performance entitled Seduction and Despair, which premiered at Barnum Hall in Santa Monica, California. A fully staged version of the production, entitled The Infernal Comedy premiered in Vienna in July 2009. The show has since been performed throughout Europe, North America and South America. In 2015, Elisabeth Scharang directed a film called Jack about Unterweger. In 2016, Broad Green Pictures announced the development of a film version of the 2007 book Entering Hades, with Michael Fassbender attached to star. The story of the police investigation, pursuit and prosecution of Unterweger is the subject of an episode of The FBI Files titled \\"Killer Abroad\\" (Season 2, Episode 14). He is also the subject of an episode of Biography titled \\"Poet of Death\\". Austrian musician Falco's controversial song \\"Jeanny (Part-I)\\" depicts a murder and rapist's thoughts, and its promotional video contains a number of references to crime scenes both real and fictional; while the \\"news break\\" in it (which is also heard in the song) refers in an oblique way to Unterweger, who was still in jail at the time of the single's release. The Investigation Discovery Channel's true crime series Horror at the Cecil Hotel's premiere episode 1402 told Unterweger's story. The episode aired on Monday October 16, 2017.

Following the success of the magazine Q, publishers Emap were looking for a title that would cater for the burgeoning interest in classic rock music. Mojo was first published on 15 October 1993; in keeping with its classic rock aesthetic, the first issue had Bob Dylan and John Lennon as its first cover stars. Noted for its in-depth coverage of both popular and cult acts, it acted as the inspiration for Blender and Uncut. Many noted music critics have written for it, including Charles Shaar Murray, Greil Marcus, Nick Kent, Jon Savage and Sylvie Simmons. The launch editor of Mojo was Paul Du Noyer and his successors have included Mat Snow, Paul Trynka and Pat Gilbert. While some criticise it for its frequent coverage of classic rock acts such as the Beatles and Bob Dylan, it has nevertheless featured many newer and \\"left-field\\" acts. It was the first mainstream magazine in the UK to focus on the White Stripes, whom it has covered as zealously as it has many older acts. Mojo regularly includes a covermount CD that ties in with a current magazine article or theme. It introduced the Mojo Honours list, an awards ceremony that is a mixture of readers' and critics' awards, in 2004. In early 2010, Mojo was involved in a controversial move by its new parent company, Bauer, to unilaterally impose a new contract on all photographers and writers, taking away their copyright, and offloading liability for libel or copyright infringement from the publisher onto the contributor. Two hundred photographers and writers from Mojo and Bauer's other music magazines, Kerrang! and Q, were reported as refusing to work under the new terms. Lists More recently, the magazine has taken to publishing many \\"Top 100\\" lists, including the subjects of drug songs (Mojo #109), rock epics (Mojo #125), protest songs (Mojo #126) and even the most miserable songs of all time (Mojo #127). To celebrate 150 issues, the magazine published a \\"Top 100 Albums of Mojo's Lifetime\\" list (essentially 1993 onwards). The top five for this list were: # Grace ‚Äì Jeff Buckley (1994) # American Recordings ‚Äì Johnny Cash (1994) # OK Computer ‚Äì Radiohead (1997) # Time Out of Mind ‚Äì Bob Dylan (1997) # Definitely Maybe ‚Äì Oasis (1994) In 2007, the magazine set out to determine \\"The Top 100 Records That Changed the World\\". The list was compiled and voted on by an eclectic panel of superstars, including Bj√∂rk, Tori Amos, Tom Waits, Brian Wilson, Pete Wentz and Steve Earle. Little Richard's 1955 hit \\"Tutti Frutti\\" took the number one spot. Richard's record, dubbed \\"a torrent of filth wailed by a bisexual alien\\", beat the Beatles' \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" (2nd) and Elvis Presley's \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" (3rd). The magazine's editors claimed that \\"the 100 albums, singles and 78s that made up the list make up the most influential and inspirational recordings ever made\\". Hailing \\"Tutti Frutti\\" as the sound of the birth of rock 'n' roll, the editors went on to state that \\"one can only imagine how it must have sounded when the song exploded across the airwaves!\\" The top ten on Mojo's 100 Records That Changed the World list are: # \\"Tutti Frutti\\" by Little Richard # \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" by The Beatles # \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" by Elvis Presley # The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan by Bob Dylan # Autobahn by Kraftwerk # King of the Delta Blues Singers by Robert Johnson # The Velvet Underground & Nico by the Velvet Underground and Nico # Anthology of American Folk Music (various artists) # \\"What'd I Say\\" by Ray Charles # \\"God Save the Queen\\" by Sex Pistols The magazine also published an issue in 2008 that celebrated the Beatles' \\"White Album\\", featuring a cover-mounted CD that included cover versions of tracks from the double album, including \\"Blackbird\\" sung in Scottish Gaelic by Julie Fowlis. Other lists include a Top 50 of songs by a particular artist from time to time, usually compiled by a panel of music journalists and musicians. Featured artists have included David Bowie, Pink Floyd, The Beach Boys, The Who, Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young, among many. Special editions After the success of an all-Beatles issue published to mark the release of The Beatles Anthology in 1995, many stand-alone, special editions of Mojo have been produced, devoting an entire magazine to one artist or genre. Three of the most successful were the series (produced by then special editions editor Chris Hunt) telling the story of the Beatles ‚Äì one thousand days at a time. Featuring contributions from many of the world's leading rock critics and Beatles experts, such as Hunter Davies, Mark Lewisohn, Richard Williams, Ian MacDonald, Peter Doggett and Alan Clayson, the three magazines were published between 2002 and 2003, before being collected together by editor-in-chief Paul Trynka and published as the book The Beatles: Ten Years That Shook The World (Dorling Kindersley, 2004). Other special editions have focused on Pink Floyd, Psychedelia, Punk and the Sixties. Mojo has also published four editions of \\"The MOJO Collection: The Greatest Albums Of All Time\\" (Canongate Books), originally edited by the magazine's founding features editor, Jim Irvin, and a series of short, definitive biographies under the imprint Mojo Heroes, starting in 2002 with Neil Young: Reflections In Broken Glass, written by Sylvie Simmons, a longtime Mojo contributing editor. Mojo Radio The company behind the magazine, Bauer, also produced a digital radio station. This station was called Mojo Radio, and was transmitted on the digital television networks in the UK (Freeview channel 721 and Sky Digital channel 0182, though not Virgin Media) and online. The output of the station was based on that of the magazine. It was announced on 5 November 2008 that Mojo Radio would cease broadcasting on 30 November 2008, in order to save Bauer the financial outlay. Mojo Rocks The magazine's current editor-in- chief, Phil Alexander, has a regular show on the UK digital radio station Planet Rock entitled Mojo Rocks, in which he follows a Mojo-inspired playlist.

According to the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, Ghorbanifar was a double agent for Iran and Israel. He is best known as a middleman in the Iran‚ÄìContra Affair during the Ronald Reagan presidency.Laura Rozen and Jeet Heer, American Prospect, 20 March 2005, The Front He re-emerged in American politics during the lead-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq during the first term of President George W.

The plot was exposed, and hundreds of officers were arrested at Nojeh Air Base on 9-10 July 1980.Kenneth R. Timmerman (1988), Fanning the Flames: Guns, Greed & Geopolitics in the Gulf War, Chapter 5: Thou Shalt Not Threaten American Interest , The Iran Brief Ghorbanifar had owned a shipping company and headed the logistics branch of the Niqab network which organised the civilian part of the plot. He had been recommended for the role by Bakhtiar.Mark J. Gasiorowski (2002), \\"The Nuzhih Plot and Iranian Politics\\" , Int. J. Middle East Stud. 34 (2002), 645‚Äì666. DOI: 10.1017.S0020743802004038, p652 Some Iranian sources later accused Ghorbanifar of leaking information to the Iranian government which helped thwart the coup plot.Bryan Brumley, Associated Press, 1 February 1987, Senate Report Calls Iranian Middleman in Arms Sales A 'Suspect Character' In December 1985 Adnan Khashoggi said in an interview that Ghorbanifar was head of European intelligence under Mir-Hossein Mousavi (Prime Minister from 1981). In 1981 Ghorbanifar was a source for the Washington Posts stories about Libyan hit squads targeting President Reagan and other senior US figures; in 1986 he said he had created the story \\"To hurt Libya, an enemy of Israel\\".Andrew Killgore, The Libyan 'Hit Squad' Hoax, Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, December 2000 Ghorbanifar's contribution to the Libyan story contributed to the CIA's 1984 decision to issue a \\"burn notice\\" against Ghorbanifar. In the early 1980s Ghorbanifar accompanied Cyrus Hashemi to Israel to arrange a $50m arms shipment, codenamed \\"Cosmos\\", to Iran. The deal was cancelled at the last minute with much of the equipment already loaded onto a ship in Eilat.Ronen Bergman (2008), The Secret War with Iran: The 30-Year Clandestine Struggle Against the World's Most Dangerous Terrorist Power, Simon & Schuster, p144  Iran‚ÄìContra Affair  In the 1980s, Ghorbanifar's principal American contacts were National Security Council agents Oliver North and Michael Ledeen. Ledeen vouched for Ghorbanifar to National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane. Oliver North later claimed that Ghorbanifar had given him the idea for diverting profits from TOW and HAWK missile sales to Iran to the Nicaraguan Contras. Ghorbanifar's suspected duplicity during the Iran‚ÄìContra deal led CIA Director William Casey to order three separate lie-detector tests, all of which he failed. Iranian officials also suspected Ghorbanifar of passing them forged American documents. The CIA issued a burn notice (or \\"Fabricator Notice\\") on Ghorbanifar in 1984, meaning he was regarded as an unreliable source of intelligence, and a 1987 congressional report on Iran‚ÄìContra by the Congressional Committees Investigating The Iran-Contra Affair cites the CIA warning that Ghorbanifar \\"should be regarded as an intelligence fabricator and a nuisance\\".James Risen, New York Times, 7 December 2003, How a Shady Iranian Deal Maker Kept the Pentagon's Ear His own cohorts in the arms trading affair were also incredulous. \\"I knew him to be a liar,\\" North eventually acknowledged. Robert McFarlane, the national-security adviser who approved the Iran‚ÄìContra arms trades, once described Ghorbanifar as \\"one of the most despicable characters I have ever met.\\"Article  The American Prospect Former CIA official and Iran-Contra figure George Cave, who was involved in the 1984 decision to issue the burn notice, has described Ghorbanifar as \\"the most totally amoral person I have ever met\\". According to a report in Time, Ghorbanifar's links with the CIA led to internal disputes, with the counter- terrorism division supporting him and Middle East officers attempting to discredit him. Ghorbanifar's anger at being labelled a liar may have led him to urge Iranian contacts to leak the Iran-Contra story.Ed Magnuson, Time, 2 February 1987, Double-Dealing Over Iran: CIA squabbling may have led to the arms-for-hostages scandal Jonathan Marshall, Peter Dale Scott, Jane Hunter (1987), The Iran-Contra Connection: Secret Teams and Covert Operations in Reagan Era , Black Rose Books, 223 The affair first became public in a Lebanese newspaper, apparently leaked by Mehdi Hashemi.  French‚ÄìLebanese hostage crisis  Ghorbanifar has been suspected of being a former French DGSE informer, and allegedly accompanied Jean-Charles Marchiani, the right-hand man of former French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, during his meetings with the deputy Iranian foreign minister to negotiate the release of the French hostages in Lebanon in the mid-1980s.Iskandar Safa and the French Hostage Scandal , Middle East Intelligence Bulletin, February 2002  War on terrorism  In December 2001 Michael Ledeen organized a three-day meeting in Rome, Italy between Manucher Ghorbanifar and Defense Intelligence Agency officials Larry Franklin and Harold Rhode. Also present were two officials from Italy's SISMI. In addition to a position at the American Enterprise Institute, Ledeen was working as a consultant to then U.S. Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith, who oversaw the Office of Special Plans. The 2001 meeting took place with the approval of then-Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley. The meeting concerned a secret offer from reportedly dissident Iranian officials to provide information relevant to the War on Terrorism and Iran's relationship with terrorists in Afghanistan.George Tenet, At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA, p. 311-314 (HarperCollins 2007). Summer 2003 news reports of the meetings prompted an internal review, as well as an investigation by the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld characterized the meetings as insignificant, saying, \\"There wasn't anything there that was of substance or of value that needed to be pursued further.\\" News reports also indicated that Ghorbanifar sought to be paid for the middleman role. Subsequent contacts with Ghorbanifar were abandoned. Manucher Ghorbanifar has emerged as the probable origin of the information cited by Congressman Curt Weldon's book, Countdown to Terror: The Top-Secret Information that Could Prevent the Next Terrorist Attack on America... and How the CIA has Ignored it (Regnery Publishing, June 2005) . Weldon cites an anonymous source, \\"Ali,\\" believed to be Fereidoun Mahdavi, a former Iranian minister of commerce before the Iranian Revolution who is a close associate of Ghorbanifar.

Fin Fin was produced by Makoto Tezuka. Fin Fin responds to the player's tone of voice and volume of the voice - one reviewer describing Fin Fin as a 'virtual mood ring'. 30,000 copies were sold in the first year in Japan. Fin Fin is much like the popular Tamagotchi, but for a PC. If he is not fed or paid enough attention, he would sing a sad whistling song or sometimes fly away. There are different versions of Fin Fin and each version has a limited number of worlds available. There was a 3-world version, a 4-world version, a 5-world version, and a 6-world version (which has all the worlds). Plot The game's main goal is to win Fin Fin's friendship. There are many ways to communicate with Fin Fin. The first way is to press the 1 to 5 keys, which make a sound that attracts Fin Fin. The second way is to use a special microphone called the Smartsensor and a whistle that come with the game. In the 3, 4 and 5 world versions, the player can record their own voice using the Fin Fin sound recorder that comes with the game and a microphone. Their voice then plays back when they press the 6 to 0 keys. There is also a separate sensor unit that informed Fin Fin whether the player was sitting in front of the screen. The sensor doesn't work in the German versions because of a faulty installation routine. Characters Fin Fin - Fin Fin is the main character of the game. He is half dolphin and half bird. The player can watch him sing, fly, swim, play, 'talk' and interact with him in different ways in different locations. Finnina - Fin Fin's wife. She can be seen in the Secret Inlet, Rem River Bank, and the Nest (which is only available in the 6-world version). Finfin Junior - Fin Fin's kid. He can only be seen in the 6-world version, at the Nest, when Finnina lays an egg and it hatches. He flies away from the Nest after a month. Various flora and fauna - There are various animals and plants in the Planet Teo. Some plants only appear at night, ans some only at day. Some animals are friendly to Fin Fin, while others want to eat him (but they never can). Weather The game includes natural weather, from sunny days to cloudy days, rain or even thunderstorms. However, snowfall does not occur in the game because the areas in the game are close to the equator and so the temperatures are constantly in the warm to mild range. In addition to the weather, there are also annual events such as shooting stars and lunar eclipses, and natural weather phenomena such as rainbows or northern lights. Some could happen on a specific day (for example, on August 30, a double lunar eclipse would occur in the sky at a certain time) or on many days in a year. Places There are six places to visit in the game. The 3-world version was released in Germany, and then the 4-world version was released in Germany. The 5-world version was only released in the US and the 6-world version was exclusive to Japan and China. However, one can download the 6-world version at EMGE's website below. = Amile Forest = This place is available in all versions. This is the most famous and important place of the game. It is quite high and there is a wide view over the surrounding forests to the \\"Ermes\\" mountain. In the foreground, there is a straightened branch. A \\"Yaika\\" tree, twisted in itself, with hanging leaves (similar to a willow or a birch), can be seen behind the branch. A little further on the right, there are two palm-like trees. The Amile Forest is Fin Fin's favourite place to be. Here he plays, eats and sleeps, and here one can observe him very well as he flies and practices his flying tricks, or sings. Here, the player can offer a \\"Lemo\\" berry by pressing the spacebar, which he accepts or rejects depending on whether or not he is hungry. = Lemo Valley = This place is available in the 5-world version and above. Here grow the colorful \\"Lemo\\" berries that Fin Fin often eats. The valley is surrounded by mountains, on which firs grow. The \\"Lemo\\" bushes, which always form new flowers and berries, grow in the middle of the valley. In the foreground is a hill with many plants, musical flowers and two deciduous trees. Fin Fin visits the valley to satisfy his hunger for berries. Here one can observe the way he circles the bushes several times and looks for ripe berries. If he finds one, he plucks it while hovering around the bush to eat afterwards. The player can also beat the neuro-drum by pressing the spacebar. If Fin Fin is not present, some plants start to play. After a while, animals appear at the concert. As soon as Fin Fin appears, the plants stop the music and the animals disappear one by one. = Tsubu Woods = This place is available in all versions. It is located on a small woodland, surrounded by tall trees. The trees look like coniferous trees, which bear golden-brown nuts, which can be seen sparkling in the wilderness on some nights. The shrubs, bushes and ferns on the clearing resemble jungle plants. On the floor of the clearing lies a hollow tree trunk and a large quantity of nuts or their shells. Fin Fin visits the forest to satisfy his hunger for \\"Tsubu\\" nuts. Here one can observe him shaking the nuts from the trees by flying through the treetops. Then he eats the nuts lying on the ground. = Secret Inlet = This place is available in all versions. It is a small side course of the Remse river, which runs in the jungle and ends there. Here you can see two opposite broader banks, surrounded by dense banks. Between the plants are laubless trees, whose branches point in a different direction after each visit. There is a tree at the back with a hole in the trunk, forming a small cave. Fin Fin comes to this bay to relax. Therefore, the player is recommended not to disturb him. However, the player can watch Fin Fin while swimming, playing and catching fish. If the player is lucky, Fin Fin's wife will also appear at this location for a brief moment. = Rem(se) River Bank = This place is available in the 4-world version and above. In the foreground is a cave inside the water. In the background of the upper part of the place, one can see the opposite plant-rich bank. This place is the only one that shows the underwater world of Teo, and only here can the player watch Fin Fin diving and hunting for fish. Fin Fin's wife rarely comes to this place. If both are present, the player can watch the two doing a short underwater dance. = Nest = This place is only available in the 6-world version. At the left part of the foreground is a bush of many different plants. In the center is the nest of Fin Fin and Finnina, which can be in one of three stages: construction, final or decayed. In the background is a narrow waterfall that ends in a small river. The place is surrounded by a forest of tall trees. In this place, the player can observe the rearing of Finfin Junior by Fin Fin and his wife Finnina. By pressing the spacebar, a loud Fin Fin call will sound, which can cause various things. It is supposed to scare away an enemy named Gminfly (flying orca), if the latter has approached the nest too much. When the \\"call\\" is exercised, a certain plant is always frightened in the foreground, blooming in a jerky manner and changing its color. Over time, it calms down again and takes its old form. If the player presses it while Fin Fin is in the foreground, he will start to cry. Spinoffs Animated Storybook: To Teo and Back with Jack A short point-and-click game. In it, a man travels with a boy named Jack to the planet Teo to search for Fin Fin. Jack wants to bring Fin Fin back with him. TanTan TEO This game was released in Japan and Korea. It is a music game. The player controls Fin Fin with two keys and has to keep a clock given by the game. In order to pass a level, the player has to reach a certain amount of correct key combinations. Plot: Fin Fin would like to participate in a music festival, but he must first improve his rhythm with the help of his friends.

Records. The album emerged from production difficulties surrounding Bat Chain Puller, an album Captain Beefheart recorded for DiscReet and Virgin Records in 1976. DiscReet co-founders Herb Cohen and Frank Zappa feuded over the production of the album, because Cohen funded the production with Zappa's royalty checks. Captain Beefheart recorded a new album titled Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller) due to Zappa withholding the master tapes of the original Bat Chain Puller album.  Background and recording  After recording Bongo Fury with Frank Zappa, Don Van Vliet formed a new Magic Band and began recording an album titled Bat Chain Puller for DiscReet and Virgin Records. Herb Cohen, DiscReet's co-founder and Zappa's business manager, paid for the album's production costs with Zappa's royalty checks, leading Zappa to end his business partnership with Cohen. Cohen and Zappa each demanded to be paid an advance by Virgin, leading Zappa to withhold the master tapes, for which Cohen sued him. Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller) was recorded from July 6 to August 27, 1978 at the Automatt in San Francisco. Due to the lawsuit, Van Vliet re- recorded four Bat Chain Puller tracks for Warner Bros.: \\"The Floppy Boot Stomp\\", \\"Bat Chain Puller\\", \\"Harry Irene\\", and \\"Owed T'Alex\\". The Bat Chain Puller outtake \\"Candle Mambo\\" was also re-recorded for the album, as were older unused songs \\"Ice Rose\\" (a Strictly Personal outtake formerly known as \\"Big Black Baby Shoes\\") and \\"Suction Prints\\" (a Clear Spot outtake known as \\"Pompadour Swamp\\", no relation to the later song of that name). Four new songs completed the album, these being \\"You Know You're A Man\\", \\"When I See Mommy I Feel Like A Mummy\\", \\"Love Lies\\" and \\"Tropical Hot Dog Night\\", the latter being based on a riff of the Bat Chain Puller song \\"Odd Jobs\\", which was otherwise not re-recorded. The album was completed with \\"Apes-Ma\\", which is the same recording on both versions, due to being sourced from Van Vliet's own home recording. Versions of \\"Run Paint Run Run\\" and \\"The Witch Doctor Life\\" were attempted during the sessions but not used (they have been bootlegged). They would be finished for Doc at the Radar Station and Ice Cream for Crow respectively.  Style  The music of Shiny Beast featured a mix of different music styles, similar to Safe as Milk, incorporating elements of pop, spoken word and experimental music. The song \\"Bat Chain Puller\\" was based upon the rhythm of Van Vliet's windshield wipers.  Reception  The album received favorable reviews. Robert Christgau declared Shiny Beast to be better than all Van Vliet's previous albums, writing, \\"Without any loss of angularity or thickness, the new compositions achieve a flow worthy of Weill or Monk or Robert Johnson, and his lyrics aren't as willful as they used to be.\\" A contemporary reviewer, AllMusic's Ned Raggett, also praised the album, writing \\"Shiny Beast turned out to be manna from heaven for those feeling Beefheart had lost his way on his two Mercury albums\\". Trouser Press called it \\"one of his best\\". In the Spin Alternative Record Guide (1995), the album was ranked 73 on the book's list of the \\"Top 100 Alternative Albums\\".

Participation in summer schools has been shown to have substantial beneficial effects on educational progress. Summer schools in North America In elementary and middle school, these programs are often used for remedial instruction, though some non-academic day camp programs call themselves Summer school. In high school, college or university, students can enroll in classes for credit to be taken into account in their grade point average or their transcript.Summer program for high school student - summer school. College Board: College Planning Made EasyInside Source for College Admissions Requirements. Generally, this credit is in one of two categories: remediation or advancement. For remediation, the summer school is used to make up credits lost through absence or failure. For advancement, the summer school is used to obtain credit for classes to accelerate progress toward a degree or to lessen the load of courses during the regular school year. Many universities offer short-term summer courses to attract both local and international students, and these programs are often surrounded by social activities. In academia, the term can also refer to a type of conference. Typically, established academics will give presentations on advanced topics in a field to postgraduate students. This type of summer school is often organized at a national or international level, and no credits are awarded. Also, a college or university sometimes offers a summer program for teachers or other professional workers wishing to round out their professional or general education. Some summer schools are for the general public involving no examinations and are not for degree purposes. Summer schools internationally Outside North America, the term has a broader definition and refers to all ages and includes leisure and other non-academic subjects, so, for example, a course on hedge-laying is probably targeting older adults. In these regions, Music Summer Schools, on the other hand, may be designed for school age students, college students, or adult professionals or amateurs at various levels of attainment. Summer schools can also provide students with educational experiences that would not be available to them within their normal schooling. This may encompass subjects that are not conventionally offered in schools (such as law, which is not usually offered in UK schools but may be taught in summer schools), or the experience of studying in an ancient university or a university or college that has a strong reputation on the global stage, such as the University of Oxford. Summer schools may also incorporate a wider variety of excursions and fields trips than would be possible in day-to-day education, so that some summer schools straddle the line between education and holiday. English as a foreign language Summer schools are a popular choice for students of English as a Foreign Language, particularly children. EnglishUK, the language teaching organisation for EFL in the UK, has more than 470 members, many of which operate summer schools. Summer schools often offer foreign language immersion, which has known benefits for language learning. Summer schools of this kind also hold appeal for students wishing to pursue higher education in English- speaking countries, which consistently top university league tables and get a high percentage of their students from overseas, as summer schools in these countries provide insight not only into the English language, but also into the cultures that use it. They may even provide guidance for such students in their university applications.

In its initial form, Pathfinder was one of the first Internet portals, created as Time Warner's entry onto the Internet. The objective of Pathfinder was to be an all-encompassing site that brought the best content from all of Time Warner under one banner. History The site opened on October 24, 1994,, with a small content team led by James Kinsella, Bruce Judson, Craig Bromberg, Oliver Knowlton, and Curt Viebranz. The team grew rapidly to service a growing list of internal \\"content partners\\" - at its highest point, these \\"content partners\\" numbered 80. Most of these content partners were Time Inc. magazines such as Time, People, Fortune and others, but others came from the widely distributed Time Warner corporate empire. Pathfinder.com was controversial within Time Warner. Many content partners were unhappy with the fact Pathfinder's existence prevented them from using their own URLs. For example, People Magazine was not allowed to use the domain \\"people.com,\\" but was instead restricted to a directory on Pathfinder (pathfinder.com/people/). Pathfinder's own staff were shocked when Time Inc. senior manager Don Logan publicly derided Pathfinder.com at an external analyst's meeting as a \\"black hole\\" of unprofitability. Pathfinder went through many managers and editors in its short life, and suffered from high staff turnover rates, especially after it became clear to many that its future was highly uncertain. Many early tech journalists and writers passed through its doors, including Walter Isaacson, James Kinsella (MSNBC), Daniel Okrent, John R. Quain (CBS News Up to the Minute and J-Q on Technology), John Voelcker (GreenCarReports.com), Josh Quittner, Lev Grossman, Maura Johnston and Steven Petrow. The site was closed in April 1999, and was widely considered to be an expensive failure. Some claim that Pathfinder cost Time Inc. between $100 and $120 million. Some analysts believe that Pathfinder's failure led Time Warner's senior managers to conclude that it was impossible to run a successful Internet portal, and this judgement led directly to Time Warner pursuing its eventual merger with AOL, a merger which unsuccessfully sought to generate \\"synergy\\" between the two corporate giants.

The missile was given the NATO reporting name SS-19 Stiletto and carries the industry designation 15A30. Development Development of the UR-100N began at OKB-52 in 1970 and flight tests were carried out from 1973 through 1975. In 1976, the improved UR-100NUTTKh (SS-19 Mod 3) version entered development with flight tests in the later half of the decade. The rocket's control system was developed at NPO \\"Electropribor\\" (Kharkiv, Ukraine). Description The UR-100N is a fourth-generation silo-launched liquid-propellant ICBM similar to the UR-100 but with much increased dimensions, weights, performance, and payload. The missile was not designed to use existing UR-100 silos, and therefore had new silos constructed for it. The missile has a preparation time to start of 25 minutes, a storage period of 22 years, and 6 MIRVs. Operational history The UR-100N reached initial operating capability in 1974, and by 1978 an inventory of 190 launchers were reached. In 1979, the UR-100UTTKh became operational and by 1983 had replaced many older missiles and reached maximum inventory of 360 launchers. This had fallen to 300 by 1991, and with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, many in Ukraine became property of that nation. 170 remained in Russia, although treaty obligations required the rearming of the missiles with single warheads. As of 2018, the Strategic Missile Troops had 20 (or more likely just 10) SS-19s in active service. Recent political developments have led to rearmament of the missiles with the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs), with the HGV-carrying version of the missile having SS-19 Mod 4 designation. On 27 December 2019, the first missile regiment armed with the Avangard HGV officially entered combat duty. The units previously held by Ukraine have been returned to Russia or decommissioned. US Air Force National Air and Space Intelligence Center estimates that as of June 2017 about 50 Mod 3 launchers were operationally deployed.http://www.nasic.af.mil/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=F2VLcKSmCTE%3d&portalid;=19 Civil application The UR-100N forms the basis of the Rokot space launch system, which was used in several successful launches in the 1990s and early 2000s (decade), and one failed launch of the ESA CryoSat satellite in 2005. After the failure, Rockot launches were suspended. Once the cause was unambiguously identified and corrective measures implemented, Rockot returned to active service on 28 July 2006, with the successful launch of an earth observation satellite for South Korea. START-1 Treaty The START I treaty was signed by the Soviet Union in 1991. The treaty required the Soviet Union to begin the process of dismantling nuclear warheads and the launchers used for SS-19 missiles. The Soviet Union had 300 100NUTTH missiles stationed in both Russia and Ukraine: 130 deployed in Ukraine and the rest scattered around Russia. After the fall of the USSR, Ukraine claimed ownership of all the missiles locating in its territory. Ukraine then began dismantling launchers for the SS-19 missiles in compliance with the START 1 treaty. Nuclear warheads that were deployed in Ukraine were also dismantled following terms of the treaty. Operators ; : The Strategic Missile Troops are the only operator of the UR-100N.

It exists in two major versions of 1887 and 1890. It was premiered under conductor Hans Richter in 1892 in Vienna. It is dedicated to the Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. This symphony is sometimes nicknamed The Apocalyptic, but this was not a name Bruckner gave to the work himself.  Composition and publication  Bruckner began work on the Eighth Symphony in July 1884.Korstvedt, p. 11 Working mainly during the summer vacations from his duties at the University of Vienna and the Vienna Conservatory, the composer had all four movements completed in draft form by August 1885. The orchestration of the work took Bruckner until April 1887 to complete: during this stage of composition the order of the inner movements was reversed, leaving the scherzo second and the Adagio as the third movement. In September 1887 Bruckner had the score copied and sent to conductor Hermann Levi. Levi was one of Bruckner's closest collaborators, having given a performance of the Seventh Symphony in Munich that was \\"the greatest triumph Bruckner had yet experienced\\".Korstvedt, pp. 15‚Äì16 He had also arranged for Bruckner's career to be supported in other ways, including financial assistance from the nobility, and an honorary doctorate from the University of Vienna. However the conductor wrote back to Bruckner that:Korstvedt, p. 18 > I find it impossible to perform the Eighth in its current form. I just can't > make it my own! As much as the themes are magnificent and direct, their > working-out seems to me dubious; indeed, I consider the orchestration quite > impossible... Don't lose your courage, take another look at your work, talk > it over with your friends, with Schalk, maybe a reworking can achieve > something. By January 1888, Bruckner had come to agree with Levi that the symphony would benefit from further work.Korstvedt, p. 19 Early work of revision was carried out in the first movement and the Scherzo, expressed as pencil notations in their score. A distinct version of the Adagio ‚Äì now called the ‚Äúintermediate Adagio‚Äù or ‚ÄúAdagio of 1888‚Äù ‚Äì was also retrieved and edited in 2004 by Dermot Gault and Takanobu Kawasaki. Thereafter Bruckner concentrated on the new versions of the Fourth and Third. He began work on the final version of the Adagio in March 1889 and completed the new version of the symphony in March 1890. Once the new version was completed, the composer wrote to Emperor Franz Josef I for permission to dedicate the symphony to him.Korstvedt, p. 20 The emperor accepted Bruckner's request and also offered to help pay for the work's publication.Korstvedt, p. 21 Bruckner had some trouble finding a publisher for the work, but in late 1890 the Haslinger-Schlesinger-Lienau company agreed to undertake publication. Bruckner's associates Josef Schalk and Max von Oberleithner assisted with the publication process: Schalk prepared the musical text to be sent to the printer while Oberleithner corrected the proofs and also provided financial support.Korstvedt pp. 88, 22 The symphony was eventually published in March 1892. It was the only one of Bruckner's symphonies to be published before its first performance.Korstvedt, pp. 21‚Äì22  Premiere and reception  By the time the 1890 revision was complete Levi was no longer conducting concerts in Munich: as a result he recommended that his protege Felix Weingartner, Kapellmeister of Mannheim, lead the first performance of the symphony. The premiere was twice scheduled to occur under the young conductor's direction during 1891, but each time Weingartner substituted another work at the last minute.Korstvedt, p. 23 Eventually the conductor told Bruckner that he was unable to undertake the performance because he was about to take up a new position at the Berlin Opera. However, Weingartner admitted, in a letter to Levi, that the real reason he was unable to perform the symphony was because the work was too difficult and he did not have enough rehearsal time: in particular, the Wagner tuba players in his orchestra did not have enough experience to cope with their parts.Korstvedt, p. 24 After a Munich performance by Levi was cancelled because of a feared outbreak of cholera, Bruckner focused his efforts on securing a Vienna premiere for the symphony. At last Hans Richter, subscription conductor of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, agreed to conduct the work. The first performance took place on 18 December 1892. Although some of the more conservative members of the audience left at the end of each movement, many of Bruckner's supporters were also present, including Hugo Wolf and Johann Strauss. The well known critic Eduard Hanslick left after the slow movement. His review described the symphony as \\"interesting in detail, but strange as a whole, indeed repellent. The peculiarity of this work consists, to put it briefly, in importing Wagner's dramatic style into the symphony.\\"Korstvedt, p. 4 (Korstvedt points out that this was less negative than Hanslick's reviews of Bruckner's earlier symphonies.) There were also many positive reviews from Bruckner's admirers. One anonymous writer described the symphony as \\"the crown of music in our time\\".Korstvedt, p. 5 Hugo Wolf wrote to a friend that the symphony was \\"the work of a giant\\" that \\"surpasses the other symphonies of the master in intellectual scope, awesomeness, and greatness\\".Korstvedt, p. 6 The symphony was slow to enter the orchestral repertoire. Only two further performances occurred during Bruckner's lifetime.Korstvedt, p. 26 The American premiere did not take place until 1909, while the symphony had to wait until 1929 for its first London performance.  Description  The symphony has four movements. The total duration varies by performance and the edition of the score used, but is typically around 80 minutes. = First movement = The symphony begins in a tonally ambiguous manner with a theme rhythmically reminiscent of the main theme of the first movement of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in D minor and of the March in D minor of 1862.

(d16 \\\\> des16 )  c4 \\\\\\\\! r2 r4  } >> } A more song-like second subject group uses the Bruckner rhythm: : \\\\relative c' { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key g \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\stemUp \\\\tempo 2 = 55 d4 \\\\p ^\\\\markup \\\\italic {\\"Breit und ausdrucksvoll\\" } (e4) \\\\tuplet 3/2 { fis4 g4 a4 }  b2 cis,4 d4  es4 (f4) \\\\tuplet 3/2 { g4 a4 b4 }  b4 (c4) c2  } ew Staff << ew Voice \\\\relative c' { \\\\stemUp \\\\clef bass \\\\key g \\\\major \\\\time 2/2 b1 ^~  b2 b2  b2. d4  ees2. r4  } ew Voice \\\\relative c { \\\\stemDown 1 \\\\p ~  2 2  2\\\\. 4  2\\\\. s4  } >> >> } The third subject group, which is strikingly dissonant, forms a smooth transition to the development: : \\\\relative c' { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key ees \\\\minor \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 2 = 55 r1  2 \\\\p (\\\\tuplet 3/2 { 4 4 4 }  4) r4 r2  2 (\\\\tuplet 3/2 { 4 4 4 }  4) r4 r2  } ew Staff { \\\\clef bass \\\\key ees \\\\minor es,2 \\\\p (ges4. f8  es4) r4 r2  f2 (as4. ges8  f4) r4 r2  fis4 r4 r2  } ew Staff { \\\\clef bass \\\\key ees \\\\minor \\\\tuplet 3/2 { es4 -. \\\\p ces4 -. bes4 -. } \\\\tuplet 3/2 { ges'4 -. d4 -. bes'4 -. }  \\\\tuplet 3/2 { es4 -. ces4 -. bes4 -. } \\\\tuplet 3/2 { ges4 -. d4 -. es4 -. }  \\\\tuplet 3/2 { f4 -. ces4 -. bes4 -. } \\\\tuplet 3/2 {as'4 -. ces4 -. es4 -. }  \\\\tuplet 3/2 { f4 -. ces4 -. bes4 -. } \\\\tuplet 3/2 {as4 -. e4 -. f4 -. }  \\\\tuplet 3/2 { fis4 -. r2 } r2  } >> } In structure, the opening movement is therefore a typically Brucknerian three-subject sonata form, though handled with more panache than in his previous works. The development was substantially refined in 1890. In both versions, this section of the movement contains a massive, augmented three-part statement of the main theme, impressively given on full orchestra in combination with the Bruckner rhythm of the second subject group. This combination of the main two themes of the exposition rises pitch-wise by a third until the orchestra drops away, leaving a single flute accompanied by a timpano. In the recapitulation, the third theme leads to a great climax for the entire orchestra, in which the bare rhythm of the main theme is dominant: : \\\\relative c { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"trumpet\\" \\\\relative c \\\\key c \\\\minor \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 2 = 55 r2 r4 r8 r16 c16 \\\\ff  c2...-> c16  c4.. c16 c4. c16 c16  c2...-> r16  } >> } This suddenly breaks off, leaving just the trumpets and three of the horns hammering out the rhythm, timpani thundering beneath. When the strings and woodwinds rejoin, it is in a very dejected mood. At this juncture the two versions differ significantly. In the 1887 version, this solemn passage leads to what many consider an unconvincingly premature victory coda, which sounds the main theme in C major. For the 1890 version, the triumphant ending was cut, and the despondent passage extended by a few bars to form a pianissimo coda in itself (thus becoming the only instance of a first movement ending softly in Bruckner's symphonic ≈ìuvre). This quiet, sombre ending is for low winds and low strings in a thoroughly bleak C minor, and there is no doubt from contemporary letters of Bruckner that it represented death in some way. It has been suggested by some scholars that the coda was inspired by the climax of the Dutchman's monologue in Wagner's Der fliegende Hollander, with the words, \\"Ihr Welten endet euren Lauf, ewige Vernichtung, nimm mich auf!\\". = Second movement = The five-note Deutscher Michel theme, accompanied by tremolo figures in the upper strings, is a reminiscence of the Credo of the Mass in E minor: : \\\\relative c { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key c \\\\minor \\\\clef treble \\\\time 3/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"Allegro moderato\\" 4 = 120 r8 8:16 \\\\pp 8:16 8:16 8:16 8:16  r8 8:16 8:16 8:16 8:16 8:16  R2.  } ew Staff { \\\\clef treble \\\\key c \\\\minor c,4 \\\\downbow \\\\mf es8 \\\\downbow f8 g8 g,8  c4 \\\\downbow es8 \\\\downbow f8 g8 g,8  c4 \\\\downbow r2  } >> } The main part of the Scherzo is fundamentally the same in both versions, though somewhat more repetitive in the first version. The orchestration and dynamics are more refined in the second version, helping to give the movement a rich and original sound. The Trios, however, are quite different: the 1890 version was rewritten as an adumbration of the ensuing Adagio movement, featuring the harps, and the tempo was slowed down: : \\\\relative c { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key aes \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"Langsam\\" 4 = 45 c4. \\\\p \\\\< (e,8)  e8 (f8) des'8 ( c8 \\\\\\\\! )  ces8.

He must have thought that excessive, as he pared it down to two in the 1890 version. The key of this climax was also altered from C major in 1887 to E-flat major in 1890. The coda of this movement is recalled in the coda of the Adagio of the Ninth Symphony. This Adagio differs from those in other symphonies by the composer in that the second thematic group is not presented in a more flowing tempo. The two themes are, first, a recollection of the slow movement of Schubert's Wanderer Fantasie for Pianoforte and an answering descending passage, both over throbbing, richly scored strings; and, secondly, a tonally unstable passage radiant with ecstasy. The structure and scale of the Adagio as it develops these themes is grander than any of Bruckner's previous slow movements. The movement opens in an unusual way; while it is in time, the string accompaniment is made up of a mix of uneven triplets and eighth notes. Simon Rattle describes this as a \\"fascinating rhythmic hall of mirrors.\\" : \\\\relative c { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key des \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 4/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"Feierlich langsam, doch nicht schleppend\\" 4 = 40 r1  r1  r4 as2 \\\\downbow \\\\p \\\\< as4 \\\\\\\\!  as4.. \\\\> (beses16) as4 \\\\\\\\! r4  } ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\clef bass \\\\key des \\\\major \\\\tuplet 3/2 { 8 \\\\downbow \\\\pp 4 ~ } 8 8 \\\\downbow \\\\tuplet 3/2 { 8 4 ~ } 8 8 \\\\downbow  \\\\tuplet 3/2 { 8 \\\\downbow 4 ~ } 8 8 \\\\downbow \\\\tuplet 3/2 { 8 4 ~ } 8 8 \\\\downbow  \\\\tuplet 3/2 { 8 \\\\downbow 4 ~ } 8 8 \\\\downbow \\\\tuplet 3/2 { 8 4 ~ } 8 8 \\\\downbow  \\\\tuplet 3/2 { 8 \\\\downbow 4 ~ } 8 8 \\\\downbow \\\\tuplet 3/2 { 8 4 ~ } 8 r8  } >> } This eventually leads to a great chorale in the strings that starts in G major but leads to F major: : \\\\relative c' { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff << ew Voice = \\"first\\" { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"string ensemble 1\\" \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 40 \\\\stemUp \\\\clef treble \\\\key ges \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 bes2 des4.. ^(des16)  bes2 f'4.. ^(f16)  bes4 c4 des4 es4  fes4 ges4 as4 ces4  fes2 es2  es2 des2  c2. g4  a2 ^~ a8 r8 r4  } ew Voice = \\"second\\" { \\\\stemDown bes,,2 \\\\pp a2  bes2 \\\\< des4 \\\\\\\\! \\\\> c4 \\\\\\\\!  bes4 \\\\p f'4 _\\\\markup \\\\italic { \\"cresc.\\" } f4 ges4  as4 ges4 as4 ces4  2 \\\\f 2 _\\\\markup \\\\italic { \\"dim.\\" }  2 \\\\p 2 _\\\\markup \\\\italic {\\"dim.\\" }  2 \\\\pp 4 _(4)  2 _~ 8 s8 s4  } >> ew Staff << ew Voice = \\"third\\" { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"string ensemble 1\\" \\\\stemUp \\\\clef bass \\\\key ges \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 des,2 \\\\pp des2  des2 \\\\< 2 \\\\\\\\! \\\\>  4 \\\\\\\\! a'4 _\\\\markup \\\\italic { \\"cresc.\\" } des4 des8(deses8)  ces4 es4 ces4 ges4  des'2 \\\\f es2 _\\\\markup \\\\italic { \\"dim.\\" }  2 \\\\p bes2 _\\\\markup \\\\italic { \\"dim.\\" }  c2 \\\\pp 2  2 ^~ 8 r8 r4  } ew Voice = \\"fourth\\" { \\\\stemDown \\\\clef bass \\\\key ges \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 ges,2 f2  ges2 f2  ges4 f4 bes4 beses4  as4 ces4 fes4 es4  2 2  es'2 2  2 2  2 _~ 8 s8 s4  } >> >> } The second part of the movement begins with a cello melody: : \\\\relative c' { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key e \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 4/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 40 1:16 \\\\p  1:16  } ew Staff { \\\\clef bass \\\\key e \\\\major e4.. \\\\mf gis,16 gis4 dis'8 d8  cis4.. cis,16 cis4 r4  } >> } The Adagio is the most controversial of all the movements in terms of different versions. For example, Robert Haas inserted one quiet, solemn passage in his edition of the 1890 score which restored a cut between two loud passages (before the main climax of the movement), whereas in the Leopold Nowak edition these two loud passages are joined. This difference greatly affects the impression given to the listener for this section of the movement as it heads towards the great E major climax. The 1890 Adagio, in both the edition of Robert Haas and that of Leopold Nowak, remains shorter than the 1887 original. = Fourth movement = Beginning belligerently (by Bruckner's standards), this movement reaches a triumphant conclusion using themes (or at least rhythmic impressions of these) from all four movements. The form of this movement is complex, derived from a three-subject sonata structure but, like the opening movement of Symphony No. 7, highly individualised. The scale and complexity of this movement are both on a different level from that in the opening of the Seventh Symphony, however, not least in that this movement must synthesise the entire symphony (as it reworks old ideas and new ones into a coherent whole), and forms what must be a satisfactory conclusion for the whole work. The opening theme is a powerful chorale, originally given over a march, in which the rhythmic thundering of the timpani recalls certain passages in the opening movement: : \\\\relative c { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"brass section\\" \\\\key c \\\\minor \\\\clef \\"bass\\" \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"Feierlich, nicht schnell\\" 2 = 70 fis1 \\\\ff ~ ^^  fis1  \\\\grace { 8 } 1 ~  2 4.. -> 16  2... ^^ 16  4.. 16 4.. 16  \\\\clef \\"treble\\" 1 ~ _^ ~  4.. 16 4.. -> 16  1 \\\\fff _^  } ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"brass section\\" \\\\key c \\\\minor \\\\clef \\"bass\\" fis,,1 \\\\ff ~ _^  fis1  \\\\grace { 8 } 1 ~ _^  2 4.. -> 16  2... _^ 16  4.. 16 4.. 16 1 ~ _^  4.. 16 4.. -> 16  1 \\\\fff _^  } >> } The second subject, a song theme, is remarkable in that it recollects not only its counterpart in the first movement but also the Adagio: : \\\\relative c { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff << ew Voice \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"string ensemble 1\\" \\\\key aes \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 4/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"Langsamer\\" 2 = 42 { \\\\stemUp  % 1 as1 ^\\"breit\\" \\\\p ^~  as2 bes2  des1 _\\\\markup { \\\\italic \\"cresc.\\" }  c2 ^(f2)  es2 s2  } ew Voice { \\\\clef \\"treble\\" \\\\key aes \\\\major \\\\stemDown \\\\time 4/4  % 1 as,2. _(c,4)  as'4 _(g4 f4 e4)  f2 des4 (c8 bes8)  f'2 es4 (des4)  c2 r2  } >> ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"string ensemble 1\\" \\\\key aes \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 4/4 r2 as'2 ~ \\\\p  as2 as2  as4. _\\\\markup { \\\\italic \\"cresc.\\" } (bes8) f4 ( g4 )  bes4 as4 (~ as8 g8 f8 g8)  as2 r2  } >> } The third subject is a march theme, which is a direct reworking of the introduction to the third subject group of the opening movement: : \\\\relative c { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key ees \\\\minor \\\\clef bass \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 2 = 60 2\\\\. \\\\p (4  2\\\\. 8 8  2 \\\\< 4 \\\\\\\\! \\\\> 8 8  2 \\\\\\\\!) r2  } ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key ees \\\\minor \\\\clef bass \\\\time 2/2 4 \\\\p 4 4 4  4 4 4 8 -- 8 --  4 8 -- 8 -- 4 8 -- 8 --  4 8 -- 8 -- 4 4  } >> } In the recapitulation, this third theme is presented as a fugue which leads to the solemn coda and the splendid, bright finish to the symphony. The development presents these three themes and other elements in ways which recollect earlier parts of the symphony, both episodically and in simultaneously parallel combinations. The thematic treatment is subtle and counterpoint is frequently used in the presentation of themes. It therefore seems natural that such a synthesis concludes by contrapuntally combining all the main themes of the symphony: the coda begins in a solemn C minor in which the opening theme of the Finale reaches a powerful climax. This is answered quietly by the woodwind giving out the same theme, then more optimistically by the full orchestra, from which, in a flurry of trumpets and timpani, the Scherzo theme heralds a remarkably succinct combination of all the themes in C major: : \\\\relative c { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.instrumentName = \\"I.\\" \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\clef bass \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 2 = 60 r2 r4 r8 r16 c16  c2... -^ g'16  e4.. -> c16 g'4. -> e16 d16  c2... -^ g16  e'4.. -> c16 g'4. -> e16 d16  c2... -^ r16  } ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.instrumentName = \\"II.\\" \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 r1  c2 e4 -. f4 -.  g4 -. g,4 -. r2  c2 -> e4 c8 e8  g4 -. g,4 -. r2  c2 r2  } ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.instrumentName = \\"III.\\" \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 r1  r4 g2 -> g4 ->  g4.. -> a16 g4 r4  r4 g2 -> g4 ->  c4.. -> g16 g4 r4  R1  } ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.instrumentName = \\"IV.\\" \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/2 r1  1 ~  1  \\\\grace { 8 } 1 ~  2 r2  1  } >> } For all its grandeur, the ending is remarkably concise, and the perorations are more terse than those of, say, Bruckner's own Symphony No. 5 in B flat major.  Versions  Two complete autograph manuscripts of the symphony exist, dating from 1887 and 1890 respectively. More sketches exist from all phases of work on this symphony than for most of Bruckner's works. For example, thanks to the sketches, we can see the evolution of the opening theme. Part scores show that the tonal ambiguity of the symphony's opening was not how Bruckner originally envisaged the main theme: the rhythm was to fit an arpeggiated contour in C minor. The final opening is much less defined and hovers in more of a B-flat major region, though it suggests several keys. = 1887 version = This was Bruckner's first version of the symphony, but was not published until 1972 in an edition edited by Leopold Nowak. > There are enormous variants in orchestration, harmony, voice leading and > motivic treatment between the two versions. In some sections one can almost > speak of two different pieces, rather than two versions of the same > work.Benjamin Korstvedt, leaflet of LP - Jubal 5003/4: Georg Tintner, > National Youth Orchestra of Canada Symphony No. 8, 31 August 1982 Some significant differences from the more familiar later versions include a loud ending to the first movement and a different tonality for the climax of the slow movement. It is also notably longer than the 1890 version, and has a different instrumentation (the most significant consistent difference being that the 1890 version has triple rather than double woodwind throughout the first three movements). The double woodwind of the 1887 version gives a somewhat more austere character to the overall sound of the work. Some scholars support this version of the symphony. Bryan Gilliam, for example, argues that the later version (from 1890) is shorter and smoother, and is hence a dubious concession to the Brahms-loving bourgeoisie of the time.Gilliam, Bryan. \\"The Two Versions of Bruckner's Eighth Symphony.\\" 19th Century Music 16, no. 1 (1992): 59‚Äì69. The 1887 version was premiered by Hans- Hubert Sch√∂nzeler for the BBC in 1973,The Independent and has thereafter been recorded by Dennis Russell Davies, Vladimir Fedoseyev, Eliahu Inbal, Georg Tintner, Michael Gielen, Kent Nagano, Simone Young, Franz Welser-M√∂st and Fabio Luisi. A digitalisation of the North-American premiere of the 1887 version by Tintner with the National Youth Orchestra of Canada, Kingston, Ontario (Canada), 31 August 1982 (LP: Jubal 5003/4, 1982), and of a 2009 live performance by Gennadi Rozhdestvensky with the Bolshoi Orchestra can be heard on John Berky's website. The new edition by Paul Hawkshaw has been premiered by Peter Oundjian with the Yale Symphony Orchestra on 27 October 2017. =Intermediate versions= A copy of an intermediate version of the Adagio with an estimated date of 1888 exists in the Austrian National Library. This Adagio, which already requires triple woodwind, has been edited by Dermot Gault and Takanobu Kawasaki and recorded by Akira Naito with the Tokyo New City Orchestra. A MIDI version is also available. Intermediate versions of the other movements have been edited by Carragan and performed by Gerd Schaller. > This account of the Eighth was founded on individual, possibly non- > contemporaneous manuscripts rather than one complete copy. ‚Ä¶ Thus it will > always have to be regarded as experimental, not on the same editorial level > as the firmly-established manuscript versions of 1887 and 1890 and the > printed version of 1892. But in it we have a fascinating view of the work- > in-progress of Bruckner the eternal reviser, looking for the most expressive > realization of his lofty thoughts and melodic inspiration. = 1890 version = Some scholars such as Deryck Cooke and Robert Haas have suggested that the 1890 revision was the product of Bruckner's insecurity and pressure from his colleagues such as Josef Schalk. Cooke even referred to it as the \\"Bruckner-Schalk revision\\".Korstvedt, p. 69 Against this, Leopold Nowak pointed out that there is no evidence of handwriting in the 1890 manuscript other than Bruckner's own; according to testimony of his friends and associates, the composer was resistant to interference. The scoring is fuller and more grandiloquent than in 1887, with subtler textures and harmonies in the woodwind in particular, allowed for by the increased size of this section of the orchestra. The 1890 version was published in 1955 as edited by Nowak.Bruckner, Anton. Symphony No. 8/2, c minor, 1890 version. Edited by Leopold Nowak. (New York: Eulenberg, 1992) EditionsFirst edition (1892)= This was the first publication of the symphony, and was also the version used at the first performance. It contains some relatively minor changes from the 1890 manuscript, the most notable being a six-bar cut and a two-bar repeated passage in the Finale. The alterations were made by Joseph Schalk and Max von Oberleithner, almost certainly without Bruckner's direct involvement, but were probably approved by the composer before publication. Korstvedt writes that \\"while the 1892 edition may not be \\"pure Bruckner\\" ‚Äì whatever that might be ‚Äì to all appearances Bruckner authorized it, and for that reason it needs to be taken seriously.\\"Korstvedt p. 91 This edition is available in complete recordings by Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler, Hans Knappertsbusch, Josef Krips, William Steinberg, George Szell, Bruno Walter and Takeo Noguchi. Serge Koussevitzky also used this edition in his severely cut broadcast performance of 1947; this performance, which has been preserved on disc, amounts to a wholly new \\"edition\\". =Haas‚Äôs ‚Äúmixed‚Äù edition= Robert Haas published his edition of the Eighth Symphony in 1939. He based it on the 1890 autograph but included passages from 1887 that had been changed or omitted. The Gesamtausgabe describes it as a ‚ÄúMischform,‚Äù or mixed form. Nevertheless it remains a beloved and, perhaps, the most frequently played and recorded edition of the work. Haas argued that Levi‚Äôs comments were a crippling blow to Bruckner‚Äôs artistic confidence, even leading him to \\"entertain suicidal notions\\", although Haas had no evidence for this.Korstvedt, p. 68 This led, Haas maintained, to Bruckner‚Äôs three-year effort to revise the Eighth Symphony and many of his earlier works. This line of thought supports Haas‚Äô editorial methods. Haas took what he admired from Bruckner's different versions and rolled them into his own version. He justified the rejection of various features of Bruckner‚Äôs 1890 revision on biographical grounds: they are the ideas of a Bruckner who mistrusted his own judgment, and therefore non- Brucknerian. The most significant omissions that Bruckner made (and therefore of Haas's restorations) are in the Adagio and Finale of the work. In addition, Haas inserted into the finale a transitional passage of eight bars from a sketch found in the library of the Kremsm√ºnster Abbey (A-KR C56-14e1), discarding five bars of Bruckner's own revision. Korstvedt has described these interventions as \\"exceed[ing] reasonable limits of scholarly responsibility\\".Korstvedt, p. 105 Despite its dubious scholarship, Haas's edition has proved enduringly popular: conductors such as Herbert von Karajan, Bernard Haitink and G√ºnter Wand continued to use it even after the Nowak/1890 edition was published, while noted Bruckner conductor Georg Tintner has written that the Haas edition is \\"the best\\" version of the symphony and referred to Haas himself as \\"brilliant\\". On the other hand, Eugen Jochum used Haas's edition for his first recording, made in 1949, before Nowak published his edition, and Nowak's for his subsequent recordings, while Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler, despite having given the premiere of the Haas score, reverted to the 1892 edition in his final years. The controversy over the Haas edition centers on the fact that its musical text was a fabrication of the editor never approved by Bruckner himself. In particular, Nowak, who succeeded Haas as principal editor of the Bruckner complete works, argued that there is little evidence for the psychological breakdown that Haas claimed Bruckner suffered upon Levi's rejection of the work. Bruckner's letters at the time suggest that he was frustrated by Levi‚Äôs judgment (dismissing Levi as having a \\"hard time grasping things\\") and psychologically healthy. Bruckner's revisions, according to this view, are the result of his artistic perfectionism. Nowak therefore rejected Haas's approach by sticking closely to Bruckner's autograph scores. =Nowak‚Äôs two editions= As noted above, under the discussion of versions, Nowak left in 1955 an edition of the 1890 version and in 1972 an edition of the 1887 version. = Hawkshaw's new edition = Both versions will be published in the new Collected Edition. The new edition corrects enough mistakes in the older print. Nevertheless, it is still very much the same score.  Instrumentation  The 1887 version requires an instrumentation of three each of the following woodwind: flutes, a piccolo in the climax of the Adagio, and doubling the third flute in the Finale, oboes, clarinets, bassoons (the third doubling as contrabassoon in the Finale), and eight horns ‚Äì the triple woodwinds and horns 5 to 8, however, only enter in the Finale (with double woodwind and four horns for the earlier movements) ‚Äì in addition to three trumpets, three trombones, a quartet of Wagner tubas and a single contrabass tuba, along with timpani, cymbals, triangle, three harps, and strings. The 1890 version deletes the piccolo part, and extends the triple woodwinds and calls for eight horns on all four movements. Horns 5 to 8 replace the Wagner tubas in most of the first and third movements, doubling as Wagner tubas at some points of the symphony. This is the only symphony where Bruckner employs the harp. This was, in total, the largest orchestra Bruckner ever used (since the Ninth Symphony, which uses an otherwise identical orchestra, does not require harps and percussion other than timpani).  Programme  In an 1891 letter to conductor Felix Weingartner, Bruckner gave extramusical associations to several parts of the symphony:Korstvedt, p. 51 > In the first movement, the trumpet and horn passage based on the rhythm of > the [main] theme in the Todesverk√ºndigung [the annunciation of death], which > gradually grows stronger, and finally emerges very strongly.

Bruckner's associates report other comments that the composer is said to have made about the symphony. The coda to the first movement is \\"how it is when one is on his deathbed, and opposite hangs a clock, which, while his life comes to an end, beats on ever steadily: tick, tock, tick, tock\\"Korstvedt, p. 52 while in the slow movement \\"I have gazed too deeply into a maiden's eyes\\". In an unsigned programme note at the 1892 first performance Joseph Schalk elaborated Bruckner's program, adding references to Greek mythology (Aeschylus's Prometheus, Zeus or Cronus, etc.) mixed with a few Christian references such as the Archangel Michael.  Differences in performance  Over the recorded lifetime of this symphony, significantly different approaches have been taken, including tempo choices and the choice of score. Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler, in a live performance with the Vienna Philharmonic in 1944 used a modified Haas edition. On 29 September 1944, the Preussische Staatskapelle Berlin, conducted by Herbert von Karajan, recorded the last three movements of the 8th Symphony with the finale in experimental stereophonic sound. In his interpretation Karajan kept strict metre whereas \\"recordings from the 1940s ‚Ä¶ typically present this passage [the reprise of the third subject group in the finale] as a grand accelerando-rallentando, with a tempo increase of as much as 20 percent,\\" while Karajan's recording \\"is a notable exception.\\"Korstvedt, p. 98 ‚Äì 99 The first commercial recording of the complete symphony was made by Eugen Jochum with the Hamburg State Philharmonic Orchestra in 1949 for Deutsche Grammophon. Jochum later recorded it in studio with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1964 for Deutsche Grammophon, and in 1976 with the Dresden Staatskapelle for EMI using the Nowak 1890 edition both times. Karl B√∂hm, in a studio recording with the Vienna Philharmonic in 1976 for Deutsche Grammophon used the Nowak 1890 edition, but with one Haas passage in the finale. In the last two decades of the 20th century, recordings tended to \\"set a broader basic tempo, ‚Ä¶ abstain from dramatic tempo fluctuations ‚Äì especially increases ‚Äì and place great store by fullness of tone, precise ensemble, and textural clarity.\\"Korstvedt, p. 101 Typically, this work lasts about 80 minutes, although there are performances running as long as 103 minutes.Sergiu Celibidache, Munich Philharmonic Orchestra, 12-09-1993 - EMI CDC 5 56696 2 (Discography of the Symphony No. 8 in C Minor). Herbert von Karajan and the aforementioned G√ºnter Wand each recorded the Haas hybrid version more than once. After Eliahu Inbal recorded the 1887 version for the first time, other conductors have followed. Takashi Asahina has recorded a disc comparing excerpts from the Haas and Nowak editions.

The story focuses on a group of young boys. One of them (David), joining in with the 'cool crew', helps to steal an old woman's cane. When she finds them, she cries out, \\"Your Doppelg√§nger will regurgitate on your soul!\\" meaning that his ghostly double would puke on his soul, according to a translation by David. Following this, the protagonist finds himself repeatedly experiencing the same misfortunes he passed on to the old woman. Themes of the occult, youthful sexuality, and schoolyard bullying and profanity are explored in the novel, and its resulting suppression has garnered its position 49 on the American Library Association's list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990-2000. Plot In a 1989 suburban town, a boy named David tries to get in the cool group by helping his friend Scott, and two troublemakers named Roger and Randy (the former being the leader) carry out a prank. Their target is an elderly woman who was called a witch by all the kids in the school. When they attack her and steal her cane David flips her off to try to impress Roger. But when they leave the old lady's house, she cries out to David \\"Your Doppelg√§nger will regurgitate on your soul!\\" The following days David finds himself experiencing strange happenings that lead him to believe that he is cursed. After being rejected by Roger and his gang, David finds himself becoming a loser. He breaks his parents' window, he walks into class with his zipper unzipped, he falls off his chair in class, and his only friends are fellow outcasts Larry and Maureen \\"Mo\\". His actions lead Roger's gang to target him and his friends, calling them \\"The Three Stooges\\". He becomes friendly with a cute girl named Tori Williams, but his pants fall down when he gets the courage to ask her for her phone number. Finally, his younger brother Ricky, after being ridiculed by Roger's younger brother, loses all respect for David. Eventually, David begs the elderly woman to remove the curse, but she asks for her cane to be returned first. As it turns out, Tori doesn't scorn David for his humiliation in having his pants fall down in front of her, and tries to pretend that she had her eyes closed in thought when it happened, to prevent David from becoming uncomfortable around her. David finally decides to fight for his dignity, and, with his friends and little brother by his side, he goes to face Roger's gang and get the cane back, not suspecting that many things, including the curse, are not as they seem. Mo, Tori, Larry, David and his little brother all go to Roger's house for the fight. They get the cane and bring it back to the 'witch' who turns out to be Tori's great-aunt. The aunt is not a witch and there was no curse but David was feeling so bad that sub-consciously he does the things to himself that had happened to the old lady. At the end of the book, 150 years later, a boy named Willy, who is similarly bullied, idolizes David, who is now a famous historical figure.

Varan is depicted as a giant prehistoric reptile capable of gliding flight, and would go on to appear in the 1968 film Destroy All Monsters, the ninth film in the Godzilla franchise. Overview In its first appearance, Varan is a kaiju that lives in a saltwater lake within the Kunishiroshima valley, where it is known to the natives as Baradagi-Sanjin. It kills an expedition duo and then completely destroys a nearby village. The monster proceeds to attack Tokyo until it is tricked by the military into eating bombs. After a few detonate in its stomach, Varan is mortally wounded and escapes back into the ocean. After final bomb explodes, Varan is defeated. Varan reappears in Destroy All Monsters living in Monsterland with many other monsters including Godzilla, Mothra, Kumonga, Anguirus, Baragon, Minilla, Rodan, Gorosaurus, and Manda. Varan is seen in the wide screen version of the film, gliding in to join the other Earth monsters to fight against King Ghidorah, although it does not actually take part in the fight. Within the context of the film itself it is only seen on Monsterland's monitors early in the film, gliding down to the ground prior to the climactic fight at the end of the movie, and in the last scene gliding up into the air as a static model rather than as an actor in a suit. It is never mentioned by name in this film and its roar is not heard. Varan makes a cameo in Godzilla: Final Wars using stock footage from Varan the Unbelievable during the narrative at the beginning, claiming that Varan was one of many monsters that arose due to the devastation that the World Wars brought, along with Gezora, Baragon, Gaira, Titanosaurus, and Megaguirus. Varan is 50 meters (164 feet) tall and weighs 15,000 metric tons (16,534 short tons). =Appearance and abilities= Eiji Tsuburaya and Akira Watanabe based Varan's design on that of a Draco lizard, Godzilla, and a kappa. The name Varan is derived from Varanus pater, or \\"father of lizards.\\" However, it may also be named after the genus of monitor lizards Varanus. In its film appearances, Varan does not have any special abilities such as fiery or radioactive breath. It can however glide at speeds of Mach 1.5, and has a row of spines along its body which may afford protection. =Action figures= Few figures of Varan have been issued compared to other kaiju film monsters. Bullmark released the first ever Varan vinyl toy in 1970. Bandai has only issued Varan in gashapon form as part of High Grade Series 6, in promotion for the film Godzilla 2000. Y-MSF has also released a figure on the 6\\" scale in 2005. Other companies, such as CCP, Marmit, Trendmasters, and the modern version of Marusan have also released Varan figures. Appearances In one of the early drafts of what would become Godzilla vs. Gigan, Varan was to have joined Godzilla and Rodan in defending the Earth against King Ghidorah, Gigan, and a new monster that had never been seen before with the name Mogu.Rodan's Roost: Kaiju Scrap-yard: Return of King Ghidorah Shusuke Kaneko, director of the popular Heisei Gamera trilogy had originally considered Varan, along with Anguirus, to star in Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack as antagonists to Godzilla. Varan and Anguirus were however replaced with the far more popular Mothra and King Ghidorah.Rodan's Roost: Kaiju Scrap-yard: Varan, Baragon, Anguirus: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack - Godzilla 2002 The suit designer is said to have compromised by giving some of Varan's facial features to King Ghidorah. =Films= * Varan the Unbelievable (1958) * Destroy All Monsters (1968) * Godzilla: Final Wars (2004, stock footage cameo) =Video games= * Godzilla: Monster of Monsters (NES - 1988) - Varan himself appeared purple in the game. * Kaij≈´-≈ç Godzilla / King of the Monsters, Godzilla (Game Boy - 1993) * Godzilla Trading Battle (PlayStation - 1998) * Godzilla: Unleashed (Wii - 2007) =Literature= * Godzilla 2000 (novel - 1997) * Godzilla: Rulers of Earth (comic - 2013-2015) * Godzilla in Hell (comic - 2015) ReferencesExternal links Category:Toho Monsters Category:Fictional lizards Category:Fictional characters with superhuman strength Category:Godzilla characters Category:Kaiju Category:Mothra characters Category:Science fiction film characters Category:Fantasy film characters Category:Film characters introduced in 1958 Category:Fictional monsters Category:Horror film villains ","title":"Varan"},{"id":"2011892","text":"E minor is a minor scale based on E, consisting of the pitches E, F, G, A, B, C, and D.

Often seen in people during periods of depression or stress, it is normally a short-lived habit. Items purchased during periods of retail therapy are sometimes referred to as \\"comfort buys\\" (compare comfort food). The name retail therapy is ironic and semifacetious, acknowledging that shopping hardly qualifies as true therapy in the medical or psychotherapeutic sense. It was first used in the 1980s, with the first reference being this sentence in the Chicago Tribune of Christmas Eve 1986: \\"We've become a nation measuring out our lives in shopping bags and nursing our psychic ills through retail therapy.\\" The fact that shopping may provide a short time of comfort (relief from dysphoria), but also imposes costs and is subject to comedown and withdrawal, make it, like opioid use, either a therapy or an addiction, depending on whether each person uses it adaptively or maladaptively. Retail therapy thus exists on a spectrum with shopping addiction (compulsive buying disorder). In 2001, the European Union conducted a study finding that 33% of shoppers surveyed had \\"high level of addiction to rash or unnecessary consumption\\". This habit was causing debt problems for many. The same study also found that young Scottish people had the highest susceptibility to binge purchasing. A 2013 survey of 1000 American adults found that slightly more than half had engaged in retail therapy, with the practice being more common among women (63.9% of women and 39.8% of men); women were most likely to buy clothing while men were most likely to buy food. Research from professors at Youngstown State University found similar results (64% of women vs. 40% of men), with relief from anxiety being the most common reason for retail therapy. Researchers at Melbourne University have advocated its classification as a psychological disorder called oniomania or compulsive shopping disorder. Window shopping can offer some of the comforts of shopping. The advantage is that many items and many stores can be enjoyed without cost far more than spending would allow. The disadvantage is that one cannot acquire or keep the items.

In 1967, he became a Companion of the Order of Canada. Biography Leonard Outerbridge was born in Asheville, North Carolina, on May 6, 1888, the son of Bermudians Sir Joseph Outerbridge and Maria Harvey Outerbridge (born Tucker), who were residents of Newfoundland. He was educated at Bishop Feild College in St. John's, Marlborough College in England, and finished a law degree at the University of Toronto where he was a Member of Alpha Delta Phi. Outerbridge served in the Canadian forces, during the Great War, reaching the rank of Colonel. After the war he worked as a lawyer in Toronto for a year before returning to St. John's to help his brother, Herbert, manage Harvey and Company Ltd. From 1923-24, Outerbridge was president of the Newfoundland Board of Trade, and in 1925 headed the Charity Organization Bureau. From 1930-1944, he was honorary private secretary to successive governors. For the last three years of the Second World War, Outerbridge volunteered full-time as director of Civil Defence, supervising the Air Raids Precaution Team. He was knighted in 1946 \\"for services as Honorary Private Secretary to the Governor of Newfoundland\\" as announced in the 1946 King's Birthday Honours. During the second referendum in 1948, Outerbridge was one of a group of Water Street merchants who supported confederation. In 1949, he succeeded Sir Albert Walsh, who was installed on a temporary basis, as the second lieutenant-governor of Newfoundland. Outerbridge, not Walsh, was Smallwood's initial choice for Newfoundland's first lieutenant-governor. As a confederation supporter, he was instrumental in gaining support from Newfoundland merchants. Upon the signing of the Terms of Union, Smallwood actually announced Outerbridge's appointment to the position but Canadian Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent and Outerbridge felt the declaration too hasty. Fearing the public would suspect patronage, Outerbridge was reluctant to take the position. It was decided Albert Walsh would become the first lieutenant-governor of the new Canadian province of Newfoundland, and Outerbridge succeeded him less than a year later. His term as lieutenant-governor lasted for eight years. He was made Knight of Grace of St. John of Jerusalem in 1951. After his term, Outerbridge became president of Harvey and Company Limited. In the 1970s he became chair of the company and still held the position at 90. Outerbridge was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada in 1967. He received a special service award for his work as director of the Canadian National Institute for the Blind in 1983, and, in 1985, he was made a Companion of the Order of the Red Cross. He died in St. John's on September 6, 1986. See also *Harvela Investments Ltd v.

To rectify this, the modern interpretation of the term \\"virtual\\" must be amended such that it carries the traditional implication; \\"that is such in essence or effect, though not recognised as such in name or according to strict definition.\\"OED In this sense, it \\"would include those crimes that somehow evoke and approach the effect and essence of real crime, but are not considered crimes.\\"Cf. Brenner, Virtual Crime, 4 Cal. Crim. Law Rev. 1 at ¬∂125-27 Virtual economies Over time, players build their characters and collect in-game items. Some such items may have been obtained through months of gameplay, involving various tasks and a substantial level of effort. According to standard conceptions of economic value, the goods and services of virtual economies do have a demonstrable value. Since players of these games are willing to substitute real economic resources of time and money (monthly fees) in exchange for these resources, by definition they have demonstrated utility to the user. Stemming from their value in the virtual economy, these items, and the characters themselves, have gained monetary value in the real world. eBay, along with specialist trading sites, have allowed players to sell their wares. This has attracted fraudulent sales as well as theft. Many game developers, such as Blizzard Entertainment (responsible for World of Warcraft) oppose and even prohibit the practice. Some argue that to allow in-game items to have monetary values makes these games, essentially, gambling venues. In the online world of Brittania, the currency of one Annum equates to about $3.4 US. If someone were to steal another player's virtual currency, they could convert it to US dollars via PayPal. This stems controversy over whether or not this should be dealt with like real crime, as there are real-life implications. In most games, players do not own, materially or intellectually, any part of the game world, and merely pay to use it. Because this \\"virtual property\\" is actually owned by the game developer, a developer who opposed real commerce of in-game currencies would have the right to destroy virtual goods as soon as they were listed on eBay or otherwise offered for real trade. Known cases In South Korea, where the number of computer game players is massive, some have reported the emergence of gangs and mafia, where powerful players steal and demand that beginners give them virtual money for their \\"protection\\". In China, Qiu Chengwei was sentenced to life in prison after stabbing and killing fellow The Legend of Mir 3 gamer Zhu Caoyuan. In the game Qiu had lent Zhu a powerful sword (a \\"dragon sabre\\"), which Zhu then went on to sell on eBay for 7,200 Yuan (about ¬£473 or US$870). With no Chinese laws covering the online dispute, there was nothing the police could do.\\"'Game theft' led to fatal attack\\" at BBC News. Retrieved 9 June 2005.

In Japan, the Kagawa prefectural police arrested a Chinese foreign exchange student on 16 August 2005 following the reports of virtual mugging and the online sale of the stolen items. The virtual economies of many MMOs and the exchange of virtual items and currency for real money has triggered the birth of the game sweatshop, in which workers in the developing world, typically China (although there has been reports of this type of activity in Eastern European countries), earn real-world wages for long days spent monotonously performing in-game tasks. Most instances typically involve farming of resources or currency, which has given rise to the epithet Chinese Adena Farmer, because of its first reported widespread use in Lineage II. More egregious cases involve using exploits such as in duping money or items, such as a large-scale incident in Star Wars Galaxies. Both practices can place great stress on the creators' artificial economy, requiring robust design, and often repeated updates, to preserve reasonable work/reward ratios and game balance. There have also been reports of collusion (or vertical integration, depending on the source) among farmers and online currency exchanges. In 2002, a company called Blacksnow Interactive, a game currency exchange, admitted to using workers in a \\"virtual sweatshop\\" in Tijuana, Mexico to farm money and items from Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot. When Mythic Entertainment cracked down on the practice, Blacksnow attempted to sue the game company. It was reported on 14 November 2007 that a Dutch teenager had been arrested for allegedly stealing virtual furniture from \\"rooms\\" in 3D social-networking website Habbo Hotel. The teenagers involved were accused of creating fake Habbo websites in order to lure users into entering their account details, which would then be used to steal virtual furniture bought with real money totalling ‚Ç¨4000.

He was awarded the 2011 Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society.Curriculum Vitae (MS Word) Education Ellis read astronomy at University College London and obtained a DPhil at Wolfson College at the University of Oxford in 1974. Career and research In 1985 he was appointed professor at the University of Durham (with two years at the Royal Greenwich Observatory) for his research contributions. In 1993 he moved to the University of Cambridge as the Plumian Professor and became a professorial fellow at Magdalene College. He served as director of the Institute of Astronomy from 1994 to 1999, at which point he moved to Caltech. Shortly after his arrival at Caltech, he was appointed as director of the Palomar Observatory which he later reorganized as the Caltech Optical Observatories taking into account the growing importance of Caltech's role in the Thirty Meter Telescope. After 16 years at Caltech, in September 2015 he returned to Europe via the award of a European Research Council Advanced Research Grant held at University College London (UCL). Ellis works primarily in observational cosmology, considering the origin and evolution of galaxies, the evolution of large scale structure in the universe, and the nature and distribution of dark matter. He worked on the Morphs collaboration studying the formation and morphologies of distant galaxies.\\"The Morphs\\" Durham University, United Kingdom Particular interests include applications using gravitational lensing and high-redshift supernovae. He was a member of the Supernova Cosmology Project whose leader, Saul Perlmutter, shared the 2011 Nobel Prize for Physics for the team's surprising discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe. His most recent discoveries relate to searches for the earliest known galaxies, seen when the Universe was only a few percent of its present age. At Caltech, Ellis was director of the Palomar Observatory from 2000 to 2005 and played a key role in developing the scientific and technical case, as well as building the partnership, for the Thirty Meter Telescope - a collaborative effort involving Caltech, the University of California, Canada, Japan, China and India destined for Mauna Kea, Hawaii. When constructed this will be the largest ground-based optical and near-infrared telescope.

At that time, Italy \\"provided the proper atmosphere, brought the sculptor close to the great monuments of antiquity, and provided museum collections that were available to study.\\"Rogers, Millard F., ‚Äò‚ÄôRandolph Rogers: American Sculptor in Rome‚Äô‚Äô, University of Massachusetts Press, 1971 p. 13 They also gave the artists access to the carvers of Italy who translated their clay works into marble. During this period the themes from which the subjects of sculptural works were chosen tended to be drawn from antiquity, the exceptions being portraits (whose subjects were frequently shown wearing Roman or Greek garb) or works that included Native Americans. These artists included Horatio Greenough (1805‚Äì1852), Hiram Powers (1805‚Äì1873), Thomas Crawford (1814‚Äì1857), Thomas Ball (1819‚Äì1911) and his son-in-law William Couper (1853‚Äì1942), Harriet Hosmer (1830‚Äì1908), Chauncey Ives (1810‚Äì1894), Randolph Rogers (1825‚Äì1892) and (somewhat later) William Henry Rinehart (1825‚Äì1874).Crane, Sylvia E., ‚Äò‚ÄôWhite Silence: Greenough, Powers and Crawford, American Sculptors in Nineteenth- Century Italy‚Äô‚Äô, University of Miami Press, Coral Gables, 1972 p. xiii Image:Abdiel-Greenough2.jpgHoratio Greenough, Abdiel 1838-43 File:David by Thomas Crawford.jpgThomas Crawford, David Triumphant, 1848 File:The Greek Slave.jpgHiram Powers ‚Äî The Greek Slave, Raby Castle, 1844 File:Nydia-3, Randolph Rogers.jpgRandolph Rogers, Nydia, the Blind Flower Girl of Pompeii, 1856 File:CIvesNJ.jpgThe Willing Captive by Chauncey Ives, Newark, New Jersey 1871 19th-century American women sculptors American women also became active sculptors during the Italian Period despite the sexism of the age.

Several outstanding sculptors emerged, most of them trained in the beaux- arts academies of Paris. Daniel Chester French stands out, as do Frederick William Macmonnies, Hans Schuler, and Lorado Taft. This tradition continued to the 1940s with Charles Keck, Alexander Stirling Calder and others and the use of figurative sculpture in monuments persists into the 21st Century. After the middle of the 20th Century sculpture used in public monuments was increasingly abstract. The decades following the Second World War saw a large number of monuments and memorials dedicated to the victims of the Holocaust.

These are Mount Rushmore, Stone Mountain, and Crazy Horse Memorial. Gutzon Borglum, an accomplished sculptor with such pieces as Seated Lincoln and a variety of other public monuments, oversaw the sculpture of Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills in South Dakota. The monument was finished after his death by his son Lincoln Borglum. Gutzon Borglum also was responsible for starting the Stone Mountain project in Georgia but had a falling-out with its overseers. The monument was then taken up by Augustus Lukeman, who died during its carving in 1935. The memorial was finished by Walker Hancock and was considered complete in 1972. The Crazy Horse Memorial in the Black Hills of South Dakota depicts the Oglala Lakota warrior Crazy Horse riding a horse and pointing into the distance. It was begun in 1948 by sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski and continued after his death by his wife, Ruth Ziolkowski, who took over the helm of the project, and several of their children. The face was dedicated in 1998. Image:Mountrushmore.jpgMount Rushmore National Monument. Sculptures of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln represent the first 150 years of American history. Image:Stone mountain closeup mosaic.jpgStone Mountain in Georgia =Architectural sculpture= Public buildings of the last quarter of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century provided an architectural setting for sculpture, especially in relief. Karl Bitter, Lee Lawrie, Adolph Alexander Weinman, C. Paul Jennewein, Rene Paul Chambellan, Corrado Parducci, and many others worked in the simple, sometimes narrative style that fit these spaces. Much of this work was created by anonymous sculptors and carvers.

These include Elie Nadelman, Albin Polasek, Gaston Lachaise and Carl Milles. Image:Elie Nadelman New York State Theater by David Shankbone.jpgElie Nadelman sculpture in the New York State Theater =Modern Classicism= Several notable American sculptors joined in the revitalization of the classical tradition at this time, most notably Paul Manship, who \\"discovered\\" archaic Greek sculpture while studying on a scholarship in Rome. C. Paul Jennewein and Edward McCartan were also leaders in this direction who fit easily with the art-deco tastes of the 1920s. In the 1930s and 1940s, the ideologies that rent European politics were reflected in associations of American sculptors. On the right was the group, mostly native-born, mostly old-school classical, mostly modelers of clay, who founded the National Sculpture Society, led by the heiress and sculptor Anna Hyatt Huntington and preserved in the sculpture park that she endowed ‚Äî Brookgreen Gardens in South Carolina.

One of its better known members was William Zorach. File:William Zorach, Moses, 1952.JPGMoses, William Zorach, 1952 =African-American sculptors= With the Harlem Renaissance, an African-American sculpture genre emerged. Richmond Barth√© was an outstanding example. Augusta Savage was a sculptor and teacher. Other contemporary sculptors include Elizabeth Catlett, Martin Puryear, Jerry Harris, Thaddeus Mosley, and Richard Hunt. Image:Jerry Harris.sculpture.jpgJerry Harris Dogon mother and child =The turn toward abstraction= Some Americans, such as Isamu Noguchi, had already moved from figurative to nonfigurative design, but after 1950, the entire American art world took a dramatic turn away from the former tradition, and America led the rest of the world into a more iconoclastic and theoretical approach to modernism. Within the next ten years, traditional sculpture education would almost completely be replaced by a Bauhaus-influenced concern for abstract design. To accompany the triumph of abstract expressionist painting, heroes of abstract sculpture such as David Smith emerged, and many new materials were explored for sculptural expression. Louise Nevelson pioneered the emerging genre of environmental sculpture. However, during this period a group of American sculptors persisted in creating works in their pre-war, modern/classical-style. These include Milton Horn, Donal Hord, Charles Umlauf, Joseph Erhardy, and John Henry Waddell. =Gallery of Modernist American sculpture= David Smith (1906-1965), CUBI VI, (1963, from Smith's Cubi series), Israel Museum, Jerusalem.

Jim Gary created life-sized figures composed of metal washers and hardware almost invisibly welded together, as well as those of stained glass and even used automobile parts and tools in his sculptures. Concerns for the qualities of forms and design continued ‚Äî but usually without representing a human figure. Minimalist sculpture by artists such as Richard Serra and Norman Carlberg often replaced the figure in public settings. Sculpture of the late 20th century was mostly a playful exploration of the boundaries of what could be called art. =Minimalism= The Minimalist style reduces sculpture to its most essential and fundamental features. Minimalists include Tony Smith, Donald Judd, Robert Morris, Larry Bell, Anne Truitt, and Dan Flavin; =Site-specific movement= Spiral Jetty by Robert Smithson from atop Rozel Point, in mid-April 2005 Site specific and environmental art works are represented by artists: Donald Judd, Dennis Oppenheim, Richard Serra, Robert Irwin, George Rickey, and Christo and Jeanne- Claude led contemporary abstract sculpture in new directions. Artists created environmental sculpture on expansive sites in the 'land art in the American West' group of projects. These land art or 'earth art' environmental scale sculpture works exemplified by artists such as Robert Smithson, Michael Heizer, James Turrell (Roden Crater) and others The land art (earth art) environmental scale sculpture works by Robert Smithson, Michael Heizer, James Turrell and others. =Postminimalism= Artists Bill Bollinger, Eva Hesse, Sol LeWitt, Jackie Winsor, Keith Sonnier, Bruce Nauman, and Lucas Samaras, among others were pioneers of Postminimalist sculpture.The later works of Robert Graham continued evolving, often in public art settings, into the 21st century. Also during the 1960s and 1970s artists as diverse as Stephen Antonakis, Chryssa, Walter De Maria, Dan Flavin, Robert Smithson, Dennis Oppenheim, Robert Irwin, Claes Oldenburg, George Segal, Edward Kienholz, Duane Hanson, and John DeAndrea explored abstraction, imagery and figuration through Light sculpture, Land art, and installation art in new ways. =Late 20th century revival of figurative sculpture= Keys To Community (2007), James Peniston, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Other kinds of sculpture grew in importance, some evolving from the work of leaders in ironwork during the early 1900s who included Samuel Yellin. A center for the western style of American sculpture developed at Loveland, Colorado, and many studios, magazines, and even a museum (the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City) pursued this interest. A neo-Victorian style emerged, pioneered by the sculptor Frederick Hart. =Other genres of sculpture= The art-doll and ceramic sculpture communities also grew in numbers and importance in the late 20th century, while the entertainment industry required large-scale, spectacular (sometimes monstrous or cartoon-like ) sculpture for movie sets, theme parks, casinos, and athletic stadiums. Industrial product design, especially automobiles, should not be ignored. An example is Randolph Parducci's (brother of Corrado Parducci) sculptures created for the famous chariot race scene in the film Ben Hur. Legal issues regarding photographs United States courts have consistently held that sculptors maintain an intellectual property right to sculptures and are entitled to compensation if photographs are used for commercial purposes. The rights apply even if the sculptor no longer owns the sculpture or the sculpture is not even in a public space. The sculptor, however, could sign away those rights. Some other countries, such as Germany, give permission to take the photographs via the concept of Panoramafreiheit, or Freedom of Panorama. Photograph of Frank Gaylord's Korean War Veterans Memorial sculpture On February 25, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled 2-1 that the Frank Gaylord, sculptor of the Korean War Veterans Memorial, was entitled to compensation because an image of it was used on a 37 cent U. S. postage stamp and he had not signed away his intellectual property rights. The appeals court rejected arguments that the photo was transformative. In 2002, amateur photographer and retired Marine John All was paid $1,500 to use one of his photographs of the memorial on a snowy day for the stamp which sold more than $17 million worth of stamps. In 2006, sculptor Frank Gaylord enlisted Fish & Richardson to make a pro bono claim that the U. S. Postal Service had violated his intellectual property rights to the sculpture and thus he should have been compensated. The Postal Service argued that Gaylord was not the sole sculptor (saying he had received advice from federal sources ‚Äì who recommended that the uniforms appear more in the wind) and also that the sculpture was actually architecture. Gaylord won all of his arguments in the lower court except for one‚Ä¶the court ruled the photo was fair use and thus he was not entitled to compensation. Gaylord appealed the fair use ruling and won the case on appeal. On April 22, 2011, The US Court of Claims awarded Gaylord $5,000.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 17, 1998. Homer and Marge discover that the fear of getting caught while making love is a turn on and start making love in public places. It was the first episode written by Matt Selman and was the only episode to be directed by Klay Hall. Some networks list the episode by the title, \\"Margie, May I Sleep with Danger?\\". Matt Groening listed the episode as being his eighth favorite episode, and the aroused cow is one of his all-time favorite act break jokes. Andy Dougan of the Evening Times characterized the episode along with \\"Large Marge\\", \\"Three Gays of the Condo\\", and \\"The Way We Weren't\\", as \\"four of the funniest episodes of recent series\\". The DVD release was also reviewed favorably by Louis R. Carlozo in the Chicago Tribune, where the episode was seen as \\"more ridiculous\\" than \\"Large Marge\\". Plot It is Homer and Marge's eleventh wedding anniversary and Grampa does not arrive at the Simpson house to babysit the children, spoiling Homer and Marge's evening together. Later that evening, Homer and Marge attempt to have sexual intercourse, but lack enthusiasm. The following day, it is discovered that the refrigerator's motor has burned out so Homer and Marge make their way to a hardware store to buy another one. On the way, the car gets stuck in the muddy driveway in the middle of farm country. Homer and Marge rush into the nearest barn to avoid a sudden storm. A farmer discovers the barn door is open and suspects trespassers. He enters the barn, nearly catching Homer and Marge, who are hiding in the hay loft, but leaves after failing to locate them. When the coast is clear, Homer and Marge have inspired sexual intercourse in the hay loft. Homer and Marge think their marriage has been recharged and go for a romantic weekend at a bed and breakfast, but soon fall into their old patterns. However, a maid walks in on them and they conclude they are both aroused when they risk being caught during intimate moments, so they have sex behind window curtains in a room full of people. Their love life is recharged and one day they begin to have sex on the same miniature golf course windmill where Bart was conceived. This time they come too close to being caught having public sex, and while they manage to escape, they have to flee through Springfield naked. After trying to seek help from Gil at his car lot, they steal his hot air balloon and fly throughout the city in it. As Marge tries to pilot the balloon after Homer falls and is left hanging on the rope, the balloon lands in a football stadium, and a naked photograph of Homer and Marge appears in the local newspaper. The next day, Bart and Lisa see the picture and their parents begin to explain sex to them. Before they go into detail, however, they decide to go back to the miniature golf course. In a subplot, Bart and Lisa stay at the Springfield Retirement Castle with Grandpa, and they discover a metal detector in his closet. While Bart uses it to look for pirate treasure, they uncover an alternate ending to Casablanca. After playing the scene on a projector screen it turns out to be a very sanitized and typical Hollywood happy ending, where Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman's characters marry in the end. Bart, Lisa and Grandpa all like it but one of the spectators, the Old Jewish Man, reveals that he was once a studio executive and tried to include this happy ending to the film. Disgruntled, he pays Bart and Lisa to re-bury the film reel, giving them another film reel to bury along with it, titled It's A Wonderful Life (Killing Spree Ending). Production This was the first episode written by Matt Selman. \\"Natural Born Kissers\\" was the first episode written by Matt Selman, who partly based it on his parents' marriage. The episode was the only time that show runner Mike Scully ever got a call from Fox where they suggested not doing the episode. They were worried about the sexual content, the nudity, and how it was going to be handled. They disliked several of the phrases used in the episode, such as the term \\"ass forkin'\\". In an interview, Matt Groening said: \\"The network censors couldn't believe it, and neither could I: the cow at the peephole while Homer and Marge make love in a hayloft; neighbors groping Homer when he and Marge are caught nude inside the windmill at the Sir Putts-A-Lot mini golf course; Homer dangling naked from a hot-air balloon, his ass dragging against the glass of a Crystal Cathedral-like church.\\" The producers fought the censors and in the end, very little of the script was modified. This episode is the first time that Marge's buttocks are shown on television. Marge and Homer in the golf course is a reference to the season three episode \\"I Married Marge\\", although in that episode they are in a castle, rather than a windmill. Cultural references The airplane restaurant \\"Up, Up and Buffet!\\" is based on a submarine shaped restaurant that was near the Fox studio named \\"Dive!\\". A supposed alternate ending to the 1942 film Casablanca is shown in the episode, and the Old Jewish Man gives Bart and Lisa a copy of It's A Wonderful Life with a \\"killing-spree ending\\". The song \\"Spanish Flea\\" plays during the radio commercial for Divorce Specialists. The song \\"Rock the Casbah\\" by The Clash plays over the end credits. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Natural Born Kissers\\" finished 29th in ratings for the week of May 11‚Äì18, 1998, with a Nielsen rating of 8.8, equivalent to approximately 8.6 million viewing households. It was the fourth highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following The X-Files, King of the Hill, and Ally McBeal. Matt Groening listed the episode as being his eighth favorite episode, and the aroused cow is one of his all-time favorite act break jokes. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote, \\"a superb episode which actually makes Marge and Homer's love life seem very real; everyone needs a bit of spice now and again, and they find theirs. The balloon trip is hysterical, and the attempts to explain their behaviour to a very worldly-wise Bart and Lisa are magnificent.\\" The episode was part of a DVD boxed set release called The Simpsons Kiss and Tell: The Story of Their Love, and in his review of the release, Andy Dougan of the Evening Times characterized the episode along with \\"Large Marge\\", \\"Three Gays of the Condo\\", and \\"The Way We Weren't\\", as \\"four of the funniest episodes of recent series\\". The DVD release was also reviewed favorably by Louis R. Carlozo in the Chicago Tribune, where the episode was seen as \\"more ridiculous\\" than \\"Large Marge\\".

They are commonly known as jewel bugs or metallic shield bugs due to their often brilliant coloration. They are also known as shield-backed bugs due to the enlargement of the thoracic scutellum into a continuous shield over the abdomen and wings. This latter characteristic distinguishes them from most other families within Heteroptera, and may lead to misidentification as a beetle rather than a bug. These insects feed on plant juices from a variety of different species, including some commercial crops. Closely related to stink bugs, they may also produce an offensive odour when disturbed. There are around 450 species worldwide. Description Jewel bugs are small to medium-sized oval-shaped bugs with a body length averaging at . They can easily be distinguished from stink bugs (Pentatomidae) because the shield-like enlarged last section of their thorax (known as the scutellum, Latin for \\"little shield\\") completely covers the abdomen and the wings. Despite their resemblance to beetles, jewel bugs are hemipterans or true bugs. The scutellum is an extension of the thorax, unlike the elytra of beetles which are hardened forewings. As such, jewel bugs have four membranous wings underneath the scutellum in contrast to two in beetles. The scutellum in jewel bugs also does not have a division in the middle and thus does not 'split open' when they take flight like in beetles. The heads of jewel bugs are triangular and the antennae have three to five segments. Like all heteropterans, jewel bugs are characterized by a segmented beak-like mouthpart (known as the rostrum). During feeding, jewel bugs inject proteolytic enzymes in their saliva into plants, digesting plant matter into a liquid form which they then suck up. The tarsus has three segments (tarsomeres).

File:Giant jewel bug (Eucorysses grandis).jpgalt=Eucorysses grandis from Japan, crawling up on a wall.A brilliant orange, red, and black giant jewel stink bug Eucorysses grandis, from Japan. The pattern and coloration of this species can often vary from pale cream to deep red. =Colors= Though some species are quite drab, the most conspicuous jewel bugs are often brilliantly colored, exhibiting a wide range of iridescent metallic hues that change with the view angle. The colors are the result of a combination of factors. Some species like Chrysocoris stockerus and Scutellera nobilis display colors from multiple thin layers of pigmented chitin. The colors often change or become duller when the specimens are dried, due to the topmost chitinous layer becoming opaque and obscuring the colors of the bottom layer. The colors can be restored by moistening the surfaces with water. Iridescence (or goniochromism) in jewel bugs like Poecilocoris lewisi are the result of structural coloration. Instead of pigments, the colors are caused by the interference, diffraction, or scattering of light by numerous tiny structures. In Poecilocoris lewisi, multiple tiny conical protuberances around 900 nm in height and averaging at a diameter of 360 nm are scattered on the epicuticle. These structures affect light passing through them, producing their oily- looking blue sheen (known as the Tyndall effect or Mie scattering). In other species like the African shield bug (Calidea panaethiopica), the dorsal cuticle is dotted with tiny regularly spaced hemispherical cavities. The depressions act like Bragg mirrors. When light hits the pitted surface, it gives off multiple reflections resulting in the distinctive two tone yellow- blue iridescence. The colors and patterns on jewel bugs can vary significantly between instars and even within adults of a species. Jewel bugs are also known to mimic the colors, patterns, and shape of other organisms for defensive purposes. An example is the yellow-spotted black Steganocerus multipunctatus which exhibits M√ºllerian mimicry with the tortoise beetle Chiridopsis suffriani. Ecology and life cycle All jewel bugs feed on plants (phytophagous). The eggs are laid in compact clusters. They may be round or barrel-shaped with a lid or a cap at the top (known as the operculum). They also contain a ring of small protuberances near the cap called micropylar processes. They permit the passage of sperm into the egg for fertilization and enable gaseous exchange from within the egg and the outside world for the embryos. The eggs are white or cream colored when freshly laid but can change color as the embryo matures. When hatching, the prolarva (the advanced embryo) exit the egg by opening the lid through peristaltic movements and with the help of a T-shaped internal structure in the egg (known as the egg burster). Like all hemipterans, jewel bugs undergo incomplete metamorphosis (hemimetaboly) and do not possess larval and pupal stages. Instead the adults develop from several stages (instars) of nymphs (usually five) through successive moltings (ecdysis). Nymphs resemble the adults except for size and the absence of wings. They can be of different coloration or patterns from adults. Some species are known to exhibit parental care of eggs and nymphs. Notable examples of which are Cantao parentum, Pachycoris klugii, Pachycoris stalii, Pachycoris torridus, and Tectocoris diophthalmus.

File:Calliphara exellens (Burmeister, 1834).jpgCalliphara excellens from Japan. =Reproduction= Chemical secretions from dorsal abdominal or sternal exocrine glands are used to attract mates by certain species of jewel bugs. In certain genera (like Tectocoris, Psacasta, Odontoscelis, and Irochrotus), males possess special unicellular glands in the abdomen known as the androconia (singular: androconium). They release sex pheromones when ruptured. Females possess a spermatheca, an ectodermal gland which opens into the oviduct. These serve as storage for sperm deposited by males. It contains glands which can nourish the spermatozoa until they can be released to fertilize eggs. Male jewel bugs of the genus Hotea possess an unusually large, spiky, and heavily sclerotized genitalia. They are used in a mating practice known as traumatic insemination, a result of evolutionary sexual conflict. Male Hotea bugs tear through the female reproductive ducts to deposit sperm, inflicting substantial damage to the female in the process. =Defenses= Like stink bugs, a vast majority of jewel bugs, both adults and nymphs, are also capable of releasing pungent defensive chemicals from glands located on the sides of the thorax. Typical compounds exuded by jewel bugs include alcohols, aldehydes, and esters. Nymphs and adults often exhibit clustering behavior, being found in large numbers close to each other. This behavior is thought to have an evolutionary advantage. The more individuals present in an area, the stronger the odor of the chemicals released when the bugs are threatened. If this fails, stink bugs will react to threat by flying away or dropping to the ground. Classification and evolution Scutellerids were first described by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in 1815. It belongs to the order Hemiptera (true bugs), under the suborder Heteroptera and infraorder Pentatomomorpha. They are classified under the superfamily Pentatomoidea. They were formerly classified as a subfamily of Pentatomidae by George Willis Kirkaldy in 1909. The earliest attempt to restore them to family status was in 1917 by Edward Payson Van Duzee. Most authorities today regard it as a valid family group. In phylogenetic studies in 2008 by Grazia et al., Scutelleridae was shown to be consistently monophyletic, basal to Acanthosomatidae, and distal to Plataspididae and Parastrachiidae. Below is the morphological unweighted tree of the superfamily Pentatomoidea after Grazia et al. (2008).  Subfamilies and genera The family is composed of about 81 genera and around 450 species worldwide. While the tribal and subfamilial classifications remain unclear, they are divided into eight subfamilies sensu lato: Elvisurinae, Eurygastrinae, Hoteinae (sometimes classified under Pachycorinae), Odontoscelinae, Odontotarsinae, Pachycorinae, Scutellerinae, and Tectocorinae.Biolib * Elvisurinae **Austrotichus Gross, 1975 **Coleotichus White, 1839 **Elvisura Spinola, 1837 **Solenosthedium Spinola, 1837 **Solenotichus Martin, 1897 * Eurygastrinae Amyot & Audinet- Serville, 1843 **Euptychodera **Eurygaster Laporte de Castelnau, 1833 **Fokkeria **Phimodera **Vanduzeeina * Hoteinae **Deroplax Mayr, 1864 **Ellipsocoris Mayr, 1864 **Hotea Amyot & Serville, 1843 * Odontotarsinae Mulsant & Rey, 1865 **Ahmadocoris Carapezza, 2009 **Alphocoris Germar, 1830 **Melanodema Jakovlev, 1880 **Odontotarsiellus Hoberlandt, 1955 **Odontotarsus Laporte, 1833 **Urothyreus Horv√°th, 1921 * Pachycorinae Amyot & Audinet- Serville, 1843 **Acantholomidea **Camirus **Diolcus **Homaemus **Orsilochides **Pachycoris **Sphyrocoris **Stethaulax **Symphylus **Tetyra * Scutellerinae Leach, 1815 **Augocoris **Calliphara **Cantao **Chrysocoris **Lampromicra **Sphaerocoris * Tectocorinae McDonald & Cassis, 1984 **Tectocoris Hahn, 1834 Economic significance Though most jewel bugs do little harm to crop plants, a few members of Scutelleridae are considered major agricultural pests. Together with some species of stink bugs, they are collectively known as sunn pests (also spelled as senn, , or sh√ºne pests) or wheat bugs. The most economically important species of which are members of the genus Eurygaster. Eurygaster integriceps, in particular, is a very destructive pest of cereal crops in North Africa, the Balkans, and western and central Asia. Other scutellerids known under the name 'sunn pest' include members of the genus Odontotarsus, among others. Methods of control for sunn pests have included biological pest control, using wasps of the family Scelionidae from the genera Trissolcus and Ooencyrtus. The cotton harlequin bug (Tectocoris diophthalmus) is also an important pest of cotton crops and Hibiscus. Conservation Biological methods of pest control have sometimes backfired. A parasitoid fly which preys on hemipterans, Trichopoda pennipes was introduced to Hawaii to control the invasive species Nezara viridula, the southern green stink bug. The fly now threatens native species of bugs in Hawaii as well, particularly the Koa bug (Coleotichus blackburniae, a jewel bug species notable for not possessing stink glands) which has now become rare.

Life  Prince William was the fourth and youngest son of King Frederick William II of Prussia and Princess Frederika Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt. He served in the Guards from 1799 and fought in 1806 at the head of a cavalry brigade at Battle of Jena and Auerstedt. In December 1807, he traveled to Paris, to try to reduce the war burdens imposed on Prussia by Napol√©on Bonaparte; he only managed to obtain a modest reduction. In 1808, he represented Prussia at the Congress of Erfurt. At the end of 1808, he accompanied his brother, King Frederick William III to St. Petersburg. Later, he had a prominent role in the transformation of Prussia and its army. During the War of the Sixth Coalition of 1813, he was stationed in Bl√ºcher's headquarters. In the Battle of L√ºtzen (1813) on 2 May, he commanded the reserve cavalry in the left wing of the army and during the Battle of Leipzig, he negotiated the union of the Northern army with Blucher's. Later he led the 8th Brigade of the Yorck's army corps on the Rhine and distinguished himself by bravery and military skills at the battles of Ch√¢teau-Thierry, Laon and outside Paris. After the Treaty of Paris (1814), the Prince accompanied the king to London and then attended the negotiations of the Congress of Vienna. In 1815 during the Waterloo Campaign he commanded the reserve cavalry of the Prussian IV Corps (B√ºlow's). After the second Treaty of Paris, he lived mostly in Paris and sometimes at his Fischbach Castle in Kowary in the Riesengebirge mountains. From 1824 to 1829 he was governor of the Confederate Fortress at Mainz; from 1830 to 1831 he was governor-general of the Rhine Province and Westphalia. In this capacity, on 20 September 1831 he opened the first rail line on German soil from Hinsbeck via the Deilbach valley to Nierenhof. Until then, the line had been called Deilthaler Eisenbahn (\\"Deil Valley Railway\\"); after its opening it was allowed to call itself Prinz-Wilhelm-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft. In March 1834 he was appointed general of cavalry and re-appointed as governor of the federal fortress at Mainz. He should not be confused with his nephew of the same name, the future emperor William I, who was governor of the same fortress in 1854. After the death of his wife, Marie Anna, on 14 April 1846, he withdrew from public life at his Fischbach castle.  Marriage and issue  He married his first cousin Landgravine Marie Anna of Hesse-Homburg, daughter of Frederick V, Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg, and Caroline of Hesse-Darmstadt (his mother's sister), together they had seven children: * Princess Amalie Friederike Luise Karoline Wilhelmine of Prussia (4 July 1805 ‚Äì 23 November 1805); died in infancy. * Princess Irene of Prussia (born and died 3 November 1806); stillborn. * Unnamed son (born and died 30 August 1809); stillborn. * Prince Friedrich Tassilo Wilhelm of Prussia (29 October 1811 ‚Äì 9 January 1813); died in infancy. * Prince Heinrich Wilhelm Adalbert of Prussia (29 October 1811 ‚Äì 6 June 1873); married morganatically, in 1850, Therese Elssler and had issue. * Prince Friedrich Wilhelm Tassilo of Prussia (15 November 1813 ‚Äì 9 January 1814); died in infancy. * Princess Marie Elisabeth Karoline Viktoria of Prussia (18 June 1815 ‚Äì 21 March 1885); married, in 1836, Prince Karl of Hesse and by Rhine and had issue. * Prince Friedrich Wilhelm Waldemar of Prussia (2 August 1817 ‚Äì 17 February 1849) * Princess Marie Friederike Franziska Hedwig of Prussia (15 October 1825 ‚Äì 17 May 1889); married, in 1842, King Maximilian II of Bavaria and had issue.

It was formed in December 1920 at Nagpur session of INC which was headed by C. Vijayaraghavachariar. It typically consists of fifteen members elected from the All India Congress Committee. It is headed by the Working President. Mahatma Gandhi attends a Congress Working Committee meeting at Anand Bhavan, Allahabad; Vallabhbhai Patel to the left, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit to the right, January 1940. The Working Committee has had different levels of power in the party at different times. In the period prior to independence in 1947, the Working Committee was the centre of power, and the Working President was frequently more active than the Congress President. In the period after 1967, when the Congress Party split for the first time (between factions loyal to Indira Gandhi and those led by the Syndicate of regional bosses including Kamaraj, Prafulla Chandra Sen, Ajoy Mukherjee, and Morarji Desai), the power of the Working Committee declined; but Indira Gandhi's triumph in 1971 led to a re-centralisation of power away from the states and the All-India Congress Committee and caused the Working Committee in Delhi to once again be the paramount decision-making body of the party.\\"Towards a More Competitive Party System in India\\", Ram Joshi and Kirtidev Desai, Asian Survey, Vol. 18, No. 11.

Straight-threesG10/G10 Turbo= The G10 (sometimes referred to as the \\"G10A\\" to set it apart from the later G10B) is a straight-three gasoline four- stroke engine using aluminum alloy for the block, cylinder head and pistons. It is equipped with either a carburetor or electronic fuel injection and was also offered as the G10T with an IHI RHB31/32 turbocharger and either MPFI or a carburetor. It has a single overhead camshaft driving six valves. Cylinder spacing is , as for the four-cylinder G13/G15/G16 engines. A bore and stroke give the engine a total of of displacement. It produces at 5100 rpm and at 3200 rpm with 9.5:1 compression in the carbureted model, at 5700 rpm and at 3300 rpm in the fuel-injected model. The original home market version originally offered a carbureted JIS at 5500 rpm, later power output fluctuated around . From 1984 to 1988 the standard G10 engine used a hemispherical head carbureted design with mechanical lifters. From 1989 to 2001 the engine received updates in the form of throttle-body fuel injection and hydraulic lifters. A detuned unit, with a slightly different camshaft, two-ring pistons and differently tuned engine control unit, was used in the ultra-fuel- efficient Geo Metro XFi model, which delivered as much as . In the US, the G10 in the 2000 Chevrolet Metro became the last engine available on an American- sold vehicle to use throttle body injection for fuel delivery. Through the 1985-1991 model years a turbocharged MPFI version of the G10 was offered in some markets. This engine delivered at 5500 rpm and at 3500 rpm. This turbocharged engine, with mechanical lifters, was available in both the US and Canadian Firefly/Sprint/Forsa from 1987-88. Only the Canadian Firefly/Sprint had this option, with hydraulic lifters, in the 1989-1991 model years. In the Japanese domestic market, the car was originally carbureted ( JIS at 5500 rpm, at 3500 rpm) and went on sale in June 1984. In October 1987, along with a facelift, the home market Turbo received fuel injection and power output went up to JIS, torque to . It was a short-lived version, however, as by September 1988 the car was no longer on sale in the Japanese domestic market. As the only market in the world, Canada did continue to receive this engine for its versions of the second generation Cultus. Because of the physics of the straight-three engine, the G10 tends not to idle as smoothly as other engines such as a straight-six engine. This engine has a non-interference valvetrain design.

Life A 1954 graduate of Texas Christian University, Ellis Amburn worked as a reporter for Newsweek before going into the book publishing industry where he rose to the position of editor, working for such well-known publishers as Delacorte Press, Coward- McCann, William Morrow. During his career, Amburn was an editor for authors such John le Carr√©, Belva Plain, Muriel Spark, Joshua Logan and for Jack Kerouac, who would be the subject of Amburn's 1998 book on which Leonardo DiCaprio has optioned film rights. Amburn served as editorial director for G. P. Putnam's Sons and in addition worked as a ghostwriter for Priscilla Presley, Shelley Winters, Peggy Lee and Zsa Zsa Gabor. In 1990, he produced his first biography on fellow Texan Roy Orbison that led to further such books. He is noted for his exhaustive research, even going so far as to live for several weeks at the home of the parents of Orbison's first wife, Claudette Frady-Orbison. His books have generated controversy at times (such as his biography of Janis Joplin), and he is reviled by many Orbison fans for presenting hearsay as fact. Amburn lived in High Springs, Florida, outside of Gainesville\\"Gainesville's 18 Most Interesting People - Ellis Amburn\\", Gainesville Insight, 01 January 2010 and in Tifton, Georgia. His papers are held at Texas Christian University.  Death  The Virginian-Pilot and the literary website Shelf Awareness reported that Amburn died on Saturday, August 18, 2018 after a long illness. Maureen O'Brien, book editor, ghostwriter, and friend of Amburn's remembered him thus: \\"Always the chipper man about town and cheerleader to his multitude of friends all over the world, Ellis was writing and editing right up to the end, working on a memoir of his celebrity-filled life in the book biz, where he was considered one of the best pop culture chroniclers from New York City to Hollywood and all points in between.

It airs an adult hits radio format and is owned by iHeartMedia. Its slogan is \\"We Play Everything.\\" KDRB is the flagship station for Iowa State University sports. The station's studios are located at 2141 Grand Avenue in Des Moines along with iHeartMedia's other Des Moines stations, and its transmitter is located on Northwest 2nd Street, near Ankeny Boulevard in Alleman.Radio-Locator.com/KDRB KDRB broadcasts in the HD Radio format. Its HD-2 subchannel airs a simulcast of sister station WHO. HistoryWHO- FM= In 1948, the station signed on as WHO-FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1950 page 148 It was owned by the Central Broadcasting Company and was the third FM station in Des Moines, after KRNT-FM and KSO-FM. In its early years, it primarily simulcast its sister station, AM 1040 WHO. During the \\"Golden Age of Radio,\\" WHO-AM-FM carried programming from the NBC Red Network, including comedies, dramas, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts. Studios were located at 1100 Walnut Street and the station's tower and transmitter were located on top of the Equitable Building at 6th and Locust in Des Moines. In 1950, the transmitter was moved to a new tower at WHO's transmitter site in Mitchellville, Iowa. The old transmitter and tower on top of the Equitable Building were sold to KCBC for a new FM station KCBC- FM. In the mid-1960s, WHO-FM ceased simulcasting its AM sister and started programming easy listening and classical music. =Switch to KLYF= In 1973, the station underwent some dramatic changes. The call letters were changed to KLYF and the station was reprogrammed with a beautiful music format in FM stereo. This was the first time that the station broadcast in multiplex stereo and became known by its nickname \\"K-Life.\\" As the 1980s approached, KLYF added more vocals to its sound to attract younger listeners. In 1981, the format evolved into a soft adult contemporary format. By the mid 1990s, KLYF was a Hot AC station competing directly with KSTZ. The station's transmitter was eventually moved to the WOI Tower near Alleman, Iowa. =Ownership changes= In December 1996, Palmer Broadcasting sold its Des Moines radio stations to Jacor Broadcasting of Cincinnati, Ohio.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1999 page D-162 Jacor immediately re-branded KLYF as \\"Mix 100.3,\\" but left the format unchanged for the most part. On June 17, 1998, the call letters changed to KMXD to represent Mix and Des Moines. Over time the station saw its ratings decline. Several steps were taken to try to counteract this, such as rebranding the station as \\"Mix 100\\" and trying an \\"80s and more\\" format. When these steps failed, the format was changed again to mainstream adult contemporary and the station was renamed \\"My 100.\\" In 1999, Clear Channel Communications (the forerunner to current owner iHeartMedia) bought Jacor, bringing KLYF under its ownership. =The Bus= On May 25, 2006, the AC format came to an end, as KMXD was rebranded as \\"The Bus,\\" simulcasting the adult hits format on 106.3, which at the time carried the KDRB call sign. This was a short lived, transitional arrangement to get listeners of 106.3 to move to 100.3. The adult hits format had performed better than expected, and the decision was made to move \\"The Bus\\" to the 100,000 watt signal at 100.3. On June 12, 2006, KMXD became KDRB \\"The Bus\\" on 100.3 FM. The 106.3 frequency switched to AAA as KPTL, \\"Capital 106.3\\". Programming 100.3 The Bus primarily has no DJs, except Heather Burnside in middays and Maxwell in afternoon drive. However, most of the time, the \\"Bus Driver\\" is heard between most songs and commercial breaks, mainly to identify the station. The voice of the \\"Bus Driver\\" is national voiceover artist Mark Driscoll. KDRB has been the flagship station for the Iowa State University Cyclones sports teams since the 2006-2007 season, taking over from sister station AM 1460 KXNO. Its longtime AM sister, WHO, airs the games of the rival University of Iowa. Signal KDRB has an effective radiated power of 100,000 watts, the maximum output for non-grandfathered FM stations. It broadcasts from a height above average terrain (HAAT) of 547 meters (1795 feet). That gives it one of the best FM signals in Iowa, allowing it to be heard over much of the state. With a good radio, it can sometimes be heard in small sections of Kansas, Illinois and Nebraska.Radio-Locator.com/KDRB Co-owned AM 1040 WHO also has the largest coverage area of any AM station in the state of Iowa.http://www.radiodiscussions.com/showthread.php?695281-FM-Radio-signals- you-ve-received-in-the-Quad-Cities-plus-an-extra References  External links *The Bus' website *100.3 the Bus at VarietyHits.com * * DRB Category:Radio stations established in 1948 Category:1948 establishments in Iowa Category:IHeartMedia radio stations Category:Adult hits radio stations in the United States ","title":"KDRB"},{"id":"2012056","text":"Open City or Rome, Open City () is a 1945 Italian neorealist drama film directed by Roberto Rossellini. The picture features Aldo Fabrizi, Anna Magnani and Marcello Pagliero, and is set in Rome during the Nazi occupation in 1944. The title refers to Rome being declared an open city after 14 August 1943. The film won several awards at various film festivals, including the most prestigious Cannes Grand Prix and was nominated for the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar at the 19th Academy Awards. Plot In occupied Rome in 1944, German SS troops are trying to arrest the engineer Giorgio Manfredi, a communist and a leader of the Resistance against the German Nazis and Italian Fascists, who is staying in a rooming house. The landlady warns him in time of the Germans' arrival, so that he can elude them by jumping across the rooftops. He goes to the home of Francesco, another Resistance fighter. There he encounters Pina who lives in the next apartment. Pina, Francesco's fianc√©e, is visibly pregnant. She first suspects Giorgio of being a cop and gives him a rough time, but when he makes it clear he is not, she welcomes him into Francesco's apartment to wait for him. With Pina's help (she is also part of the Resistance), Giorgio contacts Don Pietro Pellegrini, a Catholic priest who is helping the Resistance, and asks him to transfer messages and money to a group of Resistance fighters outside the city as Giorgio is now known to the Gestapo and cannot do it himself. Don Pietro is scheduled to officiate at Pina's and Francesco's wedding the next day. Francesco is not very religious, but rather would be married by a patriot priest than a fascist official; Pina, on the other hand, is devout, but wrestling with why God would allow such terrible things to happen to people. Her son, Marcello, is a somewhat reluctant altar boy. He and his friends have a small role in the Resistance planting bombs. Pina's sister Laura stays with her, but is not involved in the Resistance; in fact, she works in a cabaret serving the Nazis and Fascists. She is also an old friend of Marina, a girlfriend of Giorgio who has been looking for him, but with whom he is splitting up. Marina also works in the cabaret and as an occasional prostitute. Anna Magnani as Pina in a scene from the film The local SS commander in the city, helped by the Italian police commissioner, suspects that Giorgio is at Francesco's apartment. They conduct a huge raid, pulling out all the people and arresting dozens of men. Giorgio gets away, but Francesco is thrown in a truck with other arrestees. Seeing him being taken away, Pina breaks through a cordon of police and runs towards him, but is shot dead. The priest, who was in the building to hide weapons, under the guise of praying for a dying man, holds her in his arms and prays for her soul. The truck drives away in a convoy with military vehicles, but outside of town it is attacked by Resistance fighters, and many of the captives escape. Francesco makes it back into Rome and reconnects with Giorgio. Together they go to the priest, who has offered to hide them in a monastery. Marina betrays her former lover in exchange for drugs and a fur coat. Using information given by Marina, the Gestapo and Italian police capture Giorgio and the priest, along with an Austrian defector, on their way to the monastery. Francesco is saying goodbye to Marcello, and sees them get picked up and gets away. The defector, fearing torture, hangs himself in his cell. The Gestapo try to get Giorgio to betray his comrades, but it is in vain. He does not respond to sweet talk, so they torture him intensely; they want to break him before word gets out that he was arrested, so they can take the Resistance by surprise with the information they hope to extract from Giorgio. They also try to use Don Pietro's influence on Giorgio to convince him to betray his cause, saying that he is an atheist and communist who is the enemy, but Don Pietro responds that anyone who strives to live a righteous life is on the path of God whether they believe in Him or not. They then force Don Pietro to watch Giorgio's torture. When Giorgio dies without revealing anything, Don Pietro blesses his body and commends him to God's mercy (last rites and sacraments cannot be given to someone who has died). Giorgio's refusal to yield shakes the confidence of the Germans, including the commander, who had boasted to the priest and the collaborating woman that they were the \\"master race\\", and no one from a \\"slave race\\" could withstand their torture. Marina and a German officer stumble into the scene while intoxicated; she faints when she sees that the Germans have tortured Giorgio to death rather than treat him well as she had been led to expect. Realizing that she was responsible for this, she passes out. The Gestapo chief and the collaborator decide that she is now useless to them and arrest her, taking away the fur coat they had given her as a bribe. Don Pietro still refuses to crack, so he is taken to be executed early the next morning before his parish can learn of his arrest and respond with a protest. However, the parish altar boys/Resistance fighters show up to where Don Pietro is being executed, and they begin whistling a tune which Don Pietro recognizes. The Italian firing squad is lined up to execute Don Pietro, but some deliberately miss him. The German officer in charge of the execution squad walks over to Don Pietro as soon as he realizes that the Italians will not kill a priest, and executes Don Pietro himself. At this, the altar boys and Resistance fighters grow silent, bow their heads in grief, and slowly walk away. As the kids make way back into the city, a final shot of the city of Rome and St. Peter's Basilica can be seen clearly in the background. CastProduction By the end of World War II, Rossellini had abandoned the film Desiderio because conditions made it impossible to complete (it later was finished by Marcello Pagliero in 1946 and disowned by Rossellini). By 1944, there was virtually no film industry in Italy and no money to fund films. Rossellini had met and befriended a wealthy, elderly lady in Rome who wanted to finance a documentary on Don Pieto Morosini, a Catholic priest who had been shot by the Germans for helping the partisan movement in Italy. Rossellini wanted actor Aldo Fabrizi to play the priest in reenactments and contacted his friend Federico Fellini to help get in touch with Fabrizi. By then, the lady had agreed to finance an additional documentary about Roman children who had fought against the German occupiers. Fellini and screenwriter Sergio Amidei suggested to Rossellini that, instead of two short documentaries, he should make one feature film that combined the two ideas, and in August 1944, just two months after the Allies had forced the Nazis to evacuate Rome, Rossellini, Fellini, and Amidei began working on the script for the film. The devastation that was the result of the war surrounded them as they wrote the script. They titled it Roma, citt√† aperta and declared publicly that it would be a history of the Roman people under Nazi occupation. Shooting for the film began in January 1945. The funding from the elderly Roman lady was never enough, and the film was crudely shot due to circumstances and not for stylistic reasons. The facilities at Cinecitt√† Studios were also unusable at that time due to unreliable electricity supply and poor quality film stock. New Yorker Rod E. Geiger, a soldier in the Signal Corps, who eventually became instrumental in the movie's global success, met Rosselini at a point when they were out of film. Geiger had access to the film units at the Signal Corps that regularly threw away short-ends and complete rolls of film that might be fogged, scratched, or otherwise deemed unfit for use, and was able to obtain and deliver enough discarded stock to complete the picture.Dmytrk, Edward. \\"Odd Man Out: A Memoir of the Hollywood Ten.\\" SIU Press, 1996. p. 97 In order to authentically portray the hardships and poverty of Roman people under the occupation, Rossellini hired mostly non-professional actors for the film, with a few exceptions of established stars including Fabrizi and Anna Magnani. On the making of the film, Rossellini stated that the \\"situation of the moment guided by my own and the actors' moods and perspectives\\" dictated what they shot, and he relied more on improvisation than on a script. He also stated that the film was \\"a film about fear, the fear felt by all of us but by me in particular. I too had to go into hiding. I too was on the run. I had friends who were captured and killed.\\"Wakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 2. The H.W. Wilson Company. 1987. p. 961. Rossellini relied on traditional devices of melodrama, such as identification of the film's central characters and a clear distinction between good and evil characters. Four interior sets were constructed for the more important locations of the film. It was believed that the actual film stock was put together out of many different disparate bits, giving the film its documentary or newsreel style. But, when the Cineteca Nazionale restored the print in 1995, \\"the original negative consisted of just three different types of film: Ferrania C6 for all the outdoor scenes and the more sensitive Agfa Super Pan and Agfa Ultra Rapid for the interiors.\\" The previously unexplained changes in image brightness and consistency are now blamed on poor processing (variable development times, insufficient agitation in the developing bath and insufficient fixing).Forgacs, David. Roma citt√† aperta. London: British Film Institute, 2000. It was one of the early Italian films of the war to depict the struggle against the Germans, unlike the films made in the early years of the war (when Italy was Germany's ally under Mussolini) that depicted the British, Americans, Greeks, Russians and other allied countries, as well as Ethiopians, communists, and partisans as the antagonists. After the Allied Invasion of Italy in 1943, Italian morale crumbled, and they agreed to a separate peace with the allies, causing their former German allies to occupy large parts of Italy, intern Italian soldiers, deport Italian Jews to concentration camps, and treat many of its citizens with disdain for what they saw as a cowardly betrayal by one of their major allies. Critical response Rome, Open City received a mediocre reception from Italian audiences when it was first released when Italian people were said to want escapism after the war. However, it became more popular as the film's reputation grew in other countries.Wakeman. pp. 961‚Äì962. The film brought international attention to Italian cinema and is considered a quintessential example of neorealism in film, so much so that together with Pais√† and Germania anno zero it is called Rossellini's \\"Neorealist Trilogy\\". Robert Burgoyne called it \\"the perfect exemplar of this mode of cinematic creation [neorealism] whose established critical definition was given by Andr√© Bazin\\".Burgoyne, Robert. \\"The Imaginary And The Neo-Real\\", Enclitic, 3: 1 (Spring, 1979) Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press. Rossellini himself traced what was called neorealism back to one of his earlier films The White Ship, which he claimed had the same style. Some Italian critics also maintained that neorealism was simply a continuation of earlier Italian films from the 1930s, such as those directed by filmmakers Francesco De Robertis and Alessandro Blasetti.Wakeman. p. 962. More recent scholarship points out that this film is actually less neo-realist and rather melodramatic.Hillman, Roger. \\"The Penumbra of Neorealism\\", Forum for Modern Language Studies, 38: 2 (2002): 221‚Äì223. Critics debate whether the pending marriage of the Catholic Pina and the communist Francesco really \\"acknowledges the working partnership of communists and Catholics in the actual historical resistance\\".Shiel, Mark. Italian Neorealism: Rebuilding the Cinematic City. New York: Wallflower Press (2006): 51. Bosley Crowther, film critic for The New York Times, gave the film a highly positive review, and wrote \\"Yet the total effect of the picture is a sense of real experience, achieved as much by the performance as by the writing and direction. The outstanding performance is that of Aldo Fabrizi as the priest, who embraces with dignity and humanity a most demanding part. Marcello Pagliero is excellent too, as the resistance leader, and Anna Magnani brings humility and sincerity to the role of the woman who is killed. The remaining cast is unqualifiedly fine, with the exception of Harry Feist in the role of the German commander. His elegant arrogance is a bit too vicious ‚Äì but that may be easily understood.\\"Crowther, Bosley. The New York Times, film review, \\"How Italy Resisted\\", 26 February 1946. Last accessed: December 20, 2007. Film critic William Wolf especially praised the scene where Pina is shot, stating that \\"few scenes in cinema have the force of that in which Magnani, arms outstretched, races towards the camera to her death.\\"Wakeman. p. 961. Pope Francis has said that the film is among his favorites. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rare approval rating of 100% based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 9.08/10. The site's critics' consensus reads: \\"Open City fills in the familiar contours of its storyline with three-dimensional characters and a narrative depth that add up to a towering ‚Äì and still powerfully resonant ‚Äì cinematic achievement.\\" Distribution The film opened in Italy on 27 September 1945, with the war damage to Rome not yet repaired. The United States premiere followed on 25 February 1946 in New York. The American release was censored, resulting in a cut of about 15 minutes. The story of the film's journey from Italy to the United States is recounted in Federico Fellini's autobiographical essay \\"Sweet Beginnings\\". Rod E. Geiger, a U.S. Army private stationed in Rome, met Rossellini and Fellini after catching them tapping into the power supply used to illuminate the G.I. dancehall.Gottlieb, Sidney. \\"Roberto Rossellini's Rome Open City.\\" Cambridge University Press, 2004. pp. 60, 67. In the book The Adventures of Roberto Rossellini, author Tag Gallagher credits Geiger at age 29 as the \\"man who more than any single individual was to make him and the new Italian cinema famous around the world\\".Gallagher, Tag. The Adventures of Roberto Rossellini. Da Capo Press, 1998. p. 159 Before the war, Geiger had worked for an American distributor and exhibitor of foreign films which helped facilitate the film's release in the United States. In gratitude, Rossellini gave Geiger a co-producer credit. However, According to Fellini's essay Geiger was \\"a 'half-drunk' soldier who stumbled (literally as well as figuratively) onto the set of Open City. [He] misrepresented himself as an American producer when actually he 'was a nobody and didn't have a dime.'\\" Fellini's account of Geiger's involvement in the film was the subject of an unsuccessful defamation lawsuit brought by Geiger against Fellini. The film was banned in several countries. West Germany banned it from 1951 to 1960. In Argentina, it was inexplicably withdrawn in 1947 following an anonymous government order.Warren, Virginia Lee.

They were also responsible for administering the various half-caste acts where these existed and had a key role in the Stolen Generations. The boards had nearly ultimate control over Aboriginal people's lives. Protectors of Aborigines were appointed by the Board under the conditions laid down in the various Acts. In theory, protectors of Aborigines were empowered to undertake legal proceedings on behalf of Aboriginal people, dictate where Aboriginal people could live or work, and keep all wages earned by employed Aboriginals. As the boards had limited funds protectors received very limited remuneration, and so a range of people were appointed as local protectors, including resident magistrates, jail wardens, justices of the peace and in some cases ministers of religion, though most were local police inspectors. The minutes of the boards show they mostly dealt with matters of requests from religious bodies for financial relief and reports from resident or police magistrates pertaining to trials and convictions of Aboriginal people under their jurisdiction. Aboriginal protection boards also known and issued permits to allow Aboriginal people the right to leave their respective missions and reserves and enter the mainstream society for a set period of time. History Victoria = The Victorian Central Board for the Protection of Aborigines was established by the Aboriginal Protection Act 1869 (Vic), replacing the Central Board Appointed to Watch Over the Interests of the Aborigines, and made Victoria the first colony to enact comprehensive regulations on the lives of Aborigines. The board exerted an extraordinary level of control over people's lives including regulation of residence, slavery as employment, marriage, social life and other aspects of daily life. The Victorian Half-Caste Act (in full, an Act to amend an Act entitled \\"An Act to Provide for the Protection and Management of the Aboriginal Natives of Victoria\\") passed in 1886 was an extension and expansion of the Aboriginal Protection Act 1869 which gave extensive powers over the lives of Aboriginal people to the Board for the Protection of Aborigines, including regulation of residence, employment and marriage. In particular, the 1886 Act started to remove Aboriginal people of mixed descent, known as \\"half-castes\\", from Aboriginal stations or reserves to force them to assimilate into European society. These expulsions separated families and communities, causing distress and leading to protest. Nevertheless, the board refused to assist the expelled people. It was assumed that the expulsions would lead to the decline in the population of the reserves and their eventual closure. The board existed in the following incarnations: *Central Board Appointed to Watch Over the Interests of Aborigines (1860 - 1869); *Central Board for the Protection of Aborigines, Colony of Victoria (1869 - 1900); and the *Central Board for the Protection of Aborigines, State Government of Victoria (1901 - 1957) The board was finally abolished by the Aborigines Act 1957. The Aborigines Act 1910 increased the rights of Aboriginal people in Victoria, but it was only with the Aboriginal Lands Act 1970 that recognition came of Aboriginal people's right to land. Under this act the deeds of land at the Lake Tyers Mission and Framlingham reserves were transferred to the communities. = New South Wales = The New South Wales Board for the Protection of Aborigines was established in 1883 and was reconstituted under the Aborigines Protection Act 1909 with wide ranging control over the lives of Aboriginal people, including the power to remove children from families because their parents were Aboriginals, as was written on many of the files, and the power to dictate where Aboriginal people lived to ensure protection from violent colonialists and provide education in the face of European opposition (McCallum, 2008). It also controlled their freedom of movement and personal finances. In particular, Aboriginal children could be removed from their homes and families and taken into care to be raised like white children, thus starting the Stolen Generations. The 1911 amendment to the Aboriginal Protection Act established Kinchela Boys Home and Cootamundra Domestic Training Home for Aboriginal Girls. Aboriginal children were removed from their homes for various welfare reasons and transported to Kinchela and Cootamundra, where they were often abused and neglected while being taught farm labouring and domestic work, many of them ending up as servants in the homes of wealthy Sydney residents. In 1915, the Aborigines Protection Amending Act 1915 gave the Board authority to remove Aboriginal children \\"without having to establish in court that they were neglected.\\" The Board was renamed the Aborigines Welfare Board in 1940 by the Aborigines Protection (Amendment) Act 1940, which stipulated that Aboriginal people should be assimilated into mainstream white society. The board consisted of 11 members, including two Aboriginal people, one full-blood and one having a mixture of Aboriginal blood. This essentially meant that Aboriginal culture should evaporate, and Aboriginal people should eventually become indistinguishable from Europeans. The Aborigines Welfare Board was abolished under the Aborigines Act 1969 (NSW). = Western Australia = The Western Australian Aborigines Protection Board operated between 1 January 1886 and 1 April 1898 as a statutory authority. It was created by the Aborigines Protection Act, 1886 (WA), also known as the Half-Caste Act, described as An Act to provide for the better protection and management of the Aboriginal Natives of Western Australia, and to amend the Law relating to certain Contracts with such Aboriginal Natives (statute 25/1886), and The Aborigines Act, 1889 (statute 24/1889).Aboriginal Protection Board at the State Records Office of Western Australia, accessed 20 March 2008For records relating to the WA Aboriginal Protection Board see the WA States Records Office accessed 20 March 2008 The 1886 act was enacted following the furore over the Fairburn Report (which revealed slavery conditions among Aboriginal farm workers) and the work of the Rev. John Gribble. The Act introduced employment contracts between employers and Aboriginal workers over the age of 14. There was no provision in the 1886 Act for contracts to include wages, but employees were to be provided with \\"substantial, good and sufficient rations\\", clothing and blankets. The 1886 act provided a resident magistrate with the power to indenture 'half-caste' and Aboriginal children, from a suitable age, until they turned 21. An Aboriginal Protection Board was also established to prevent the abuses reported earlier, but rather than protect Aborigines, it mainly succeeded in putting them under tighter government control. It was intended to enforce contracts, employment of prisoners and apprenticeships, but there was not sufficient power to enforce clauses in the north, and they were openly flouted. The Act defined as \\"Aboriginal\\" \\"every Aboriginal native of Australia, every Aboriginal half-caste, or child of a half-caste\\". Governor Broome insisted that the act contain within it a clause permitting traditional owners to continue hunting on their tribal lands. The effect of the act was to give increasing power to the board over Aboriginal people, rather than setting up a system to punish whites for wrongdoing in relation to Aboriginal people. An Aboriginal Department was set up, under the office of the Chief Protector of Aborigines. Nearly half of the Legislative Council voted to amend the act for contract labour as low as age 10 but it was defeated. McKenzie Grant, the member for The North, claimed that child labour of age six or seven was a necessary commonplace, as \\"in this way they gradually become domesticated\\". The attorney general Septimus Burt, in debate on the 2nd reading speech, claimed that contracts were being issued, not for current work, but to hold Aboriginal people as slaves on stations for potential future work, and so prevent them from being free to leave. In 1898, the board was replaced by the Aborigines Department. = Queensland = The Queensland Aboriginal Protection Board was established by the Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897. =South Australia= The Aborigines Act Amendment Act 1939 created the Aborigines Protection Board in South Australia, which was \\"charged with the duty of controlling and promoting the welfare\\" of Aboriginal people (which included anyone descended from an Aboriginal person). Charles Duguid was a founding board member; other board members included J. B. Cleland and Constance Cooke. = Decline = By the late 1960s, all states and territories had repealed the legislation allowing for the removal of Aboriginal children under the policy of 'protection'.

This is in contrast to a multi-pass compiler which converts the program into one or more intermediate representations in steps between source code and machine code, and which reprocesses the entire compilation unit in each sequential pass. This refers to the logical functioning of the compiler, not to the actual reading of the source file once only. For instance, the source file could be read once into temporary storage but that copy could then be scanned many times. The IBM 1130 Fortran compiler stored the source in memory and used many passes; by contrast the assembler, on systems lacking a disc storage unit, required that the source deck of cards be presented twice to the card reader/punch. Properties One-pass compilers are smaller and faster than multi-pass compilers. One-pass compilers are unable to generate as efficient programs as multi-pass compilers due to the limited scope of available information. Many effective compiler optimizations require multiple passes over a basic block, loop (especially nested loops), subroutine, or entire module. Some require passes over an entire program. Some programming languages simply cannot be compiled in a single pass, as a result of their design. For example PL/I allows data declarations to be placed anywhere within a program, specifically, after some references to the not-yet- declared items, so no code can be generated until the entire program has been scanned. The language definition also includes pre-processor statements that generate source code to be compiled: multiple passes are certain. In contrast, many programming languages have been designed specifically to be compiled with one-pass compilers, and include special constructs to allow one-pass compilation. Difficulties The basic problem is of forward references. The correct interpretation of a symbol at some point in the source file may be dependent on the presence or absence of other symbols further on in the source file and until they are encountered, correct code for the current symbol cannot be produced. This is the problem of context dependence, and the span can be anywhere from adjacent symbols to arbitrarily large amounts of source text. =Local context= Suppose that the symbol < is recognized as being for a \\"less than\\" comparison, as opposed to \\"greater than\\" for example. Because of character coding limitations, the glyph ‚â§ may not be available in a standard encoding, so a compound representation is to be allowed, \\"<=\\". Even though this context is determined by the very next symbol, it is unknown when \\"<\\" is encountered. Similarly, the symbol \\"=\\" does not always mean \\"=\\", as when it is a part of a compound symbol. Other compound symbols might include \\".lt.\\" for the case when the special character \\"<\\" is unavailable. Yet another possibility where a character code for the glyph ¬¨ (\\"not\\") is unavailable is \\"<>\\" for \\"¬¨=\\" or \\"not equal\\" - some systems employ ~ or ! for ¬¨ as still further variation. One approach is to advance the scan after \\"<\\" and on encountering the \\"=\\", backtrack. This of course means that there will be two passes over that portion of text, which is to be avoided. For that matter, the source file may come from a device not supporting a go-back-and-reread operation, such as a card reader. Instead of making an early decision that may later have to be undone, the lexical analyser can maintain multiple interpretations rather like the notion of Quantum Superposition, collapsing to a specific choice only on later observing the determining symbol. Notably, COBOL compilers devote a pass to distinguishing between full stops appearing in decimal constants and the full stops that appear at the end of statements. Such a scheme is unavailable to a single-pass compiler. Similarly with the names of items. Few languages restrict themselves to single-character names, so the character \\"x\\" as a single-character name is quite different from the character \\"x\\" within a name such as \\"text\\" - now the context extends beyond the immediately adjacent characters. It is the task of the lexical analyser to separate the items of the sequential source stream into the tokens of the language. Not just words, because \\"<\\" and \\"<=\\" are tokens also. Names typically start with a letter and continue with letters and digits, and perhaps a few additional symbols such as \\"_\\". The syntax allowed for specifying numbers is surprisingly complex, for example +3.14159E+0 can be valid. It is usual to allow an arbitrary number of space characters between tokens, and fortran is unusual in allowing (and ignoring) spaces within apparent tokens also so that \\"GO TO\\" and \\"GOTO\\" are equivalent as are \\"<=\\" and \\"< =\\". However, some systems may require spaces to delimit certain tokens, and others, such as Python, use leading spaces to indicate the scope of program blocks that otherwise might be indicated by Begin ... End or similar markers. =Context within expressions= Languages that allow arithmetic expressions typically follow the syntax of infix notation with precedence rules. This means than the generation of code for an expression's evaluation does not proceed smoothly as the expression's tokens are elicited from the source text. For example, the expression x + y*(u - v) does not lead to the equivalent of load x, add y, because x is not added to y. If a stack scheme is used for arithmetic, the code may start with a Load x, but the code that corresponds to the following + token does not then follow. Instead, code for (u - v) is generated, followed by multiplication by y, and only then is x added. The parser of arithmetic expressions does not move back and forth along the source during its analysis, it employs a local stack of deferred operations driven by the precedence rules. This dance can be avoided by requiring that arithmetic expressions be presented in Reverse Polish notation or similar; for the above example something like u v - y * x + and which would be scanned strictly left- to-right. An optimising compiler may analyse the form of an arithmetic expression, to identify and remove repetition or make other potential improvements. Consider a*sin(x) + b*sin(x) Some languages, such as Algol, allow assignments within an arithmetic expression, so the programmer could have written something like a*(t:=sin(x)) + b*t but aside from the exertion required to do so, the resulting statement's form is messy and will no longer be easily compared to the mathematical expression being coded for. Mistakes would be easily made. Instead, the compiler could represent the entire expression's form (typically using a tree structure), analyse and modify that structure, and then emit the code for the improved form. There would be an obvious extension to blocks of successive assignment statements. This does not involve a second pass through the source text, as such. =Middle range context= Although the lexical analyser has split the input stream into a stream of tokens (and discarded any commentary), the interpretation of these tokens according to the language's syntax may yet depend on the context. Consider the following statements in fortran pseudo code: if (expression) = etc. if (expression) label1,label2,label3 if (expression) then The first is the assignment of the value of some arithmetic expression (the etc) to an element of a one-dimensional array called \\"if\\". Fortran is unusual in that it contains no reserved words, so a token \\"write\\" does not necessarily mean that there is a write-statement in progress. The other statements are indeed if- statements - the second is an arithmetic-if that examines the sign of the result of the expression and based on it being negative, zero, or positive jumps to label 1, 2, or 3; the third is a logical-if, and requires that the result of its expression be boolean - thus, the correct interpretation of the token \\"if\\" emerging from the lexical analyser cannot be made until after the expression has been scanned and following the closing bracket there appears either an equals sign, a digit (being the text of label1: fortran uses only integers as labels though if letters were allowed the scan would have to rely on finding the commas) or something starting with a letter (that must be \\"then\\"), and so now, the context spans an arbitrary amount of source text because the expression is arbitrary. However, in all three cases the compiler can generate the code for evaluating the expression as its scan advances. Thus, the lexical analysis cannot always determine the meaning of the tokens it has just identified because of the vagaries of the allowable syntax, and so the syntax analysis must maintain a superposition of possible states if backtracking is to be avoided. With the syntax analysis adrift in a fog of superposed states, should an error be encountered (that is, a token is found that cannot be fitted into any valid syntactic frame) the production of a helpful message can be difficult. The B6700 Algol compiler for example was notorious for error messages such as \\"semicolon expected\\" along with a listing of the source line plus a marker showing the location of trouble - often marking a semicolon. In the absence of a semicolon, if one were indeed placed as indicated, on recompilation there could well arise a message \\"unexpected semicolon\\" for it. Often, only the first error message from a compiler will be worth attending to, because subsequent messages went awry. Cancelling the current interpretation then resuming the scan at the start of the next statement is difficult when the source file is in error, and so subsequent messages are unhelpful. Further code production is of course abandoned. This problem can be reduced through the employment of reserved words, so that for example \\"if\\", \\"then\\", and \\"else\\" always are parts of an if-statement and cannot be names of variables, but a surprisingly large number of useful words may thereby become unavailable. Another approach is \\"stropping\\", whereby reserved words are marked off, say by placing them between special characters such as full stops, or apostrophes as in some versions of Algol. This means that \`'if'\` and \`if\` are different tokens, the latter being an ordinary name, but supplying all those apostrophes soon becomes irksome. For many languages, spacing supplies sufficient information though this may be complex. Often it is not just a space (or tab, etc.) but a character other than a letter or digit that terminates a possible token's text. In the above example, the expression of the if-statement must be within brackets so that the \\"(\\" definitely ends the identification of \\"if\\" and similarly, \\")\\" enables the identification of \\"then\\"; further, other parts of a compound if-statement must appear on new lines: \\"else\\" and \\"end if\\" (or \\"endif\\") and \\"else if\\". By contrast, with Algol and others the brackets are not needed and all the parts of an if-statement can be on one line. With Pascal, if a or b then etc. is valid, but if a and b are expressions, then they must be enclosed in brackets. Source file listings produced by the compiler can be made easier to read by having the reserved words it identifies presented _underlined_ or in bold or italic, but there has been criticism: \\"Algol is the only language that distinguishes between an italic and normal full stop\\". Actually this is no joking matter. In fortran, a do-statement's start such as \`DO 12 I = 1,15\` is distinguished from \`DO 12 I = 1.15\` (an assignment of the value 1.15 to a variable called \`DO12I\`; recall that spaces are irrelevant) only by the difference between a comma and a full stop, and a printed listing's glyphs may not be well-formed. Careful attention to the design of a language can promote clarity and simplicity of expression with a view to creating a reliable compiler whose behaviour is easily understandable. Yet poor choices are common. For example, Matlab denotes matrix transposition by using an apostrophe as in A' which is unexceptionable and closely follows mathematical usage. Well and good, but for the delimiters of a text string Matlab ignores the opportunity presented by the double quote symbol for any purpose and uses apostrophes for this as well. Though Octave uses double quotes for text strings, it strives to accept Matlab statements as well and so the problem extends to another system. =Pre-processor expansions= It is at this stage that pre-processor options are exercised, so called because they are exercised previous to the compiler proper processing the incoming source. They echo the \\"macro expansion\\" options of assembler systems, hopefully with a more gracious syntax. The most common arrangement is a variation on if condition then this source else other source fi often with some arrangement to distinguish pre- processor source statements from \\"ordinary\\" source statements, such as the statement starting with a % symbol in pl/i, or a #, etc. Another simple option is a variation of define this = that But caution is needed, as in define SumXY = (x + y) sum:=3*SumXY; Since without the brackets, the result would be sum:=3*x + y; Similarly, caution is needed in determining the bounds of the replacement text and how the resulting text will be scanned. Consider #define three = 3; #define point = .; #define one = 1; x:=three point one; Here the define statement is terminated by a semicolon, and the semicolon is not itself a part of the replacement. The invocation can't be \`x:=threepointone;\` because that is a different name, but \`three point one\` would be \`3 . 1\` and the subsequent scan may or may not be able to regard that as a single token. Some systems allow the definition of pre-processor procedures whose output is source text to be compiled, and may even allow such source to define still further pre-processor items. Adroit usage of such options allows for constants to be given explanatory names, recondite details to be replaced by easy mnemonics, the appearance of new statement forms, and the generation of in- line code for specific usages of a general procedure (such as sorting), rather than devise actual procedures. With a proliferation of parameters and parameter types, the number of combinations required grows exponentially. Further, the same pre-processor syntax could be used for multiple different languages, even natural languages as in the generation of a story from a story template using a person's name, nickname, name of pet dog, etc. and the temptation would be to devise a pre-processor programme which would accept the source file, perform the pre-processor actions and output the result ready for the next stage, the compilation. But this clearly constitutes at least one extra pass through the source and so such a solution would be unavailable to a single-pass compiler. Thus, progress through the actual input source file may well advance in fits and starts, but it is still unidirectional. =Long-range context= Code generation by the compiler also faces the problem of forwards reference, most directly in the likes of Go to label where the destination label is an unknown distance further ahead in the source file, and thus the jump instruction to reach that label's location involves an unknown distance across yet-to-be-generated code. Some language designs, influenced perhaps by \\"GOTOs considered harmful\\", do not have a GOTO statement, but this does not evade the problem as there are many implicit GOTO equivalents in a program. Consider if condition then code true else code false fi As mentioned before, code to evaluate the condition can be generated straight away. But when the then token is encountered, a JumpFalse operation code must be placed whose destination address is the start of the code for the code false statements, and similarly, when the else token is encountered, the just-completed code for the code true statements must be followed by a GOTO-style jump operation whose destination is the code that follows the end of the if-statement, here marked by the fi token. These destinations are knowable only after an arbitrary amount of code is generated for the as-yet unscanned source. Similar problems arise for any statement whose parts span arbitrary amounts of source, such as the case statement. A recursive-descent compiler would activate a procedure for each type of statement, such as an if-statement, in turn invoking the appropriate procedures to generate the code for the statements of the code true and code false parts of its statement and similarly for the other statements according to their syntax. In its local storage it would keep track of the location of the address field of its incomplete JumpFalse operation, and on encountering its then token, would place the now-known address, and similarly on encountering the fi token for the jump needed after the code true code. The GoTo statement differs in that the code to be jumped over is not inside its statement form, so an entry in an auxiliary table of \\"fixups\\" is needed that would be used when finally its label is encountered. This notion could be extended. All unknown-destination jumps could be made via an entry in a jump table (whose addresses are later filled in as the destinations are encountered), however the necessary size of this table is unknown until the end of the compilation. One solution to this is for the compiler to emit assembler source (with compiler-generated labels as the destinations for jumps, etc.), and the assembler would determine the actual addresses. But this clearly requires an additional pass through (a version of) the source file and so is disallowed for single-pass compilers. =Unfortunate decisions= Although the description above has employed the notion that code may be generated with certain fields left to be fixed up later, there was an implicit assumption that the size of such code sequences was stable. This may not be the case. Many computers have provision for operations occupying different amounts of storage, notably relative addressing whereby if the destination is within say -128 or +127 addressing steps then an eight-bit address field can be used, otherwise a much larger address field is required to reach. Thus if the code were generated with a hopeful short address field, later it may become necessary to go back and adjust the code to use a longer field, with the consequence that earlier code referencing locations after the change will have to be adjusted as well. Likewise, later references going backwards across the change will have to be fixed, even those that had been to known addresses. And as well, the fixup information will itself have to be fixed, correctly. On the other hand, long addresses could be used for all cases when nearness is not certain, but the resulting code will no longer be ideal. =One-pass sequential input, irregular sequence output= Already mentioned are some possibilities for optimisation within a single statement. Optimisations across multiple statements would require that the content of such statements be held in some sort of data structure that could be analysed and manipulated before code is emitted. In such a case, producing provisional code, even with fixups allowed for, would be a hindrance. In the limit this means the compiler would generate a data structure representing the entire program in an internal form, but a straw could be clutched and the claim made that there is no actual second pass of the source file from start to end. Possibly in the PR document advertising the compiler. Notably therefore, a compiler cannot generate its code in a single relentlessly-forwards sequence, still less immediately as each part of the source is read. The output could still be written sequentially, but only if output of a section is deferred until all pending fixups for that section have been made. Declaration before usage When generating code for the various expressions, the compiler needs to know the nature of the operands. For example, a statement such as A:=B; could produce rather different code depending on whether A and B are integers or floating- point variables (and what size: single, double or quadruple precision) or complex numbers, arrays, strings, programmer-defined types, etc. In this case, a simple approach would be to transfer a suitable number of words of storage, but, for strings this could be unsuitable as the recipient may be smaller than the supplier and in any case, only a part of the string may be used - perhaps it has space for a thousand characters, but currently contains ten. Then there are more complex constructions, as offered by COBOL and pl/i, such as \`A:=B by name;\` In this case, A and B are aggregates (or structures) with A having for example parts \`A.x\`, \`A.y\` and \`A.other\` while B has parts \`B.y\`, \`B.c\` and \`B.x\`, and in that order. The \\"by name\\" feature means the equivalent of \`A.y:=B.y; A.x:=B.x;\` But because \`B.c\` has no counterpart in A, and \`A.other\` has no counterpart in B, they are not involved. All of this can be handled by the requirement that items are declared before they are used. Some languages do not require explicit declarations, generating an implicit declaration on first encountering a new name. Should a fortran compiler encounter a previously-unknown name whose first letter is one of I,J,...,N, then the variable will be an integer, otherwise a floating-point variable. Thus a name \`DO12I\` would be a floating-point variable. This is a convenience, but after a few experiences with mistyped names, most programmers agree that the compiler option \\"implicit none\\" should be used. Other systems use the nature of the first encounter to decide the type, such as a string, or an array, and so forth. Interpreted languages can be particularly flexible, with the decision being made at run time, somewhat as follows if condition then pi:=\\"3.14\\" else pi:=3.14 fi; print pi; Should there be a compiler for such a language, it would have to create a complex entity to represent the variable pi, containing an indication as to just what its current type is and associated storage to represent such a type. This is certainly flexible, but may not be helpful for intensive computation as in solving A.x = b where A is a matrix of order a hundred, and suddenly, any one of its elements may be of a different type. =Procedures and functions= Declaration before use is likewise an easy requirement to meet for procedures and functions, and this applies also to the nesting of procedures within procedures. As with ALGOL, Pascal, PL/I and many others, MATLAB and (since 1995) Fortran allow a function (or procedure) to contain the definition of another function (or procedure), visible only within the containing function, but these systems require that they be defined after the end of the containing procedure. But when recursion is allowed, a problem arises. Two procedures, each invoking the other, cannot both be declared before usage. One must be first in the source file. This need not matter if, as on the encounter with an unknown variable, sufficient can be deduced from the encounter that the compiler could generate suitable code for the invocation of the unknown procedure, with of course the \\"fixup\\" apparatus in place to come back and fill in the correct address for the destination when the procedure's definition is encountered. This would be the case for a procedure with no parameters, for example. The returned result from a function invocation may be of a type discernable from the invocation, but this may not always be correct: a function could return a floating-point result but have its value assigned to an integer. Pascal solves this problem by requiring \\"predeclaration.\\" One of the procedure or function declarations must be given first, but, instead of the body of the procedure or function, the keyword forward is given. Then the other procedure or function can be declared and its body defined. At some point the \\"forward\\" procedure or function is redeclared, along with the body of the function. For the invocation of a procedure (or function) with parameters, their type will be known (they being declared before use) but their usage in the procedure invocation may not be. Fortran for example passes all parameters by reference (i.e. by address) so there is no immediate difficulty with generating the code (as always, with actual addresses to be fixed up later), but Pascal and other languages allow parameters to be passed by different methods at the programmer's choice (by reference, or by value, or even perhaps by \\"name\\") and this is signified only in the definition of the procedure, which is unknown before the definition has been encountered. Specifically for Pascal, in the specification of parameters a prefix \\"Var\\" signifies that it must be received by reference, its absence signifies by value. In the first case the compiler must generate code that passes the address of the parameter, while in the second it must generate different code that passes a copy of the value, usually via a stack. As always, a \\"fixup\\" mechanism could be invoked to deal with this, but it would be very messy. Multi-pass compilers can of course collate all the required information as they shuttle back and forth, but single-pass compilers cannot. Code generation could be paused while the scan advances (and its results be held in internal storage) until such time as the needed entity is encountered, and this might not be regarded as resulting in a second pass through the source because the code generation stage will soon catch up, it was merely halting for a while. But this would be complex. Instead a special construction is introduced, whereby the procedure's definition of parameter usage is declared \\"forward\\" of its later full definition so that the compiler may know it before use, as it requires. From First Fortran (1957) onwards, separate compilation of portions of a program has been possible, supporting the creation of libraries of procedures and functions. A procedure in the source file being compiled that invokes a function from such an outside collection must know the type of result returned by the unknown function, if only to generate code that looks in the right place to find the result. Originally, when there were only integers and floating-point variables, the choice could be left to the rules for implicit declaration, but with the proliferation of sizes and also types the invoking procedure will need a type declaration for the function. This is not special, having the same form as for a variable declared inside the procedure. The requirement to be met is that at the current point in a single-pass compilation, information on an entity is needed so that the correct code for it can be produced now, if with address fixups later. Whether the required information will be encountered later on in the source file or is to be found in some separately-compiled code file, the information is provided by some protocol here. Whether or not all invocations of a procedure (or function) are checked for compatibility with each other and their definitions is a separate matter. In languages descended from Algol-like inspiration, this checking is usually rigorous, but other systems can be indifferent. Leaving aside systems that allow a procedure to have optional parameters, mistakes in the number and type of parameters will normally cause a program to crash. Systems that allow separate compilation of parts of a complete programme that later are \\"linked\\" together should also check for the correct type and number of parameters and results as mistakes are even easier to make, but often do not. Some languages (such as Algol) have a formal notion of \\"upgrading\\" or \\"widening\\" or \\"promotion\\", whereby a procedure that expects say a double-precision parameter may be invoked with it as a single precision variable, and in this case the compiler generates code that stores the single precision variable into a temporary double-precision variable which becomes the actual parameter. This however changes the parameter passing mechanism to copy-in, copy-out which may lead to subtle differences in behaviour. Far less subtle are the consequences when a procedure receives the address of a single precision variable when it expects a double precision parameter, or other size variations. When within the procedure the parameter's value is read, more storage will be read than that of its given parameter and the resulting value is unlikely to be an improvement. Far worse is when the procedure changes the value of its parameter: something is sure to be damaged. Much patience can be expended in finding and correcting these oversights. =Pascal example= An example of such a construct is the forward declaration in Pascal. Pascal requires that procedures be declared or fully defined before use. This helps a one-pass compiler with its type checking: calling a procedure that hasn't been declared anywhere is a clear error. Forward declarations help mutually recursive procedures call each other directly, despite the declare-before-use rule: function odd(n : integer) : boolean; begin if n = 0 then odd := false else if n < 0 then odd := even(n + 1) { Compiler error: 'even' is not defined } else odd := even(n - 1) end; function even(n : integer) : boolean; begin if n = 0 then even := true else if n < 0 then even := odd(n + 1) else even := odd(n - 1) end; By adding a forward declaration for the function \`even\` before the function \`odd\`, the one-pass compiler is told that there will be a definition of \`even\` later on in the program. function even(n : integer) : boolean; forward; function odd(n : integer) : boolean; { Et cetera } When the actual declaration of the body of the function is made, either the parameters are omitted or must be absolutely identical to the original forward declaration, or an error will be flagged. =Pre-processor recursion= When declaring complex data aggregates, a possible usage of functions Odd and Even could arise. Perhaps if a data aggregate X has a storage size that is an odd number of bytes, a single byte item might be added to it under the control of a test upon Odd(ByteSize(X)) so as to make an even number. Given the equivalent declarations of Odd and Even as above, a \\"forward\\" declaration probably wouldn't be needed because the usage of the parameters is known to the pre-processor which is unlikely to present opportunities to choose between by reference and by value. However, there could be no invocations of these functions in the source code (outside their definitions) until after their actual definition, because the result of the invocation is required to be known. Unless of course the pre-processor engaged in multiple passes of its source file. =Forward declarations considered harmful= Anyone who has attempted to maintain coherence amongst the declarations and usages of procedures in a large program and its usage of libraries of routines, especially one undergoing changes, will have struggled over the usage of forward or similar added declarations for procedures invoked but not defined in the current compilation. Maintaining synchrony between widely-separated locations especially across different source files requires diligence. Those declarations using the reserved word are easy to find, but if the helpful declarations are not distinguished from ordinary declarations, the task becomes troublesome. The gain of supposedly swifter compilation may seem insufficient when simply abandoning the goal of one-pass compilation would remove this imposition.

The tale was first published in Copenhagen by C.A. Reitzel on 2 October 1838 in the first booklet of Fairy Tales Told for Children. New Collection. The booklet consists of Andersen's \\"The Daisy\\" and \\"The Wild Swans\\". The tale was Andersen's first not based upon a folk tale or a literary model. \\"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\\" has been adapted to various media including ballet and animated film. Plot On his birthday, a boy receives a set of 25 toy soldiers all cast from one old tin spoon and arrays them on a table top. One soldier stands on a single leg, as having been the last one cast there was not enough metal to make him whole. Nearby, the soldier spies a pretty paper ballerina with a spangle on her sash. She, too, is standing on one leg, and the soldier falls in love. That night, a goblin among the toys in the form of a jack-in-the-box, who also loves the ballerina, angrily warns the soldier to take his eyes off her, but the soldier ignores him. The next day, the soldier falls from a windowsill (presumably the work of the goblin) and lands in the street. Two boys find the soldier, place him in a paper boat, and set him sailing in the gutter. The boat and its passenger wash into a storm drain, where a rat demands the soldier pay a toll. Sailing on, the boat is washed into a canal, where the tin soldier is swallowed by a fish. When this fish is caught and cut open, the tin soldier finds himself once again on the table top before the ballerina. Inexplicably, the boy throws the tin soldier into the fire, which is most likely the work of the jack-in-the-box goblin. A wind blows the ballerina into the fire with him; she is consumed by it. The maid cleans the fireplace in the morning and finds that the soldier has melted into a little tin heart, along with the ballerina's spangle, which is now burned black as coal. Publication The tale was first published in Copenhagen, Denmark by C. A. Reitzel on 2 October 1838 in Fairy Tales Told for Children. New Collection. First booklet. Other tales in the booklet include \\"The Daisy\\" and \\"The Wild Swans\\". The tale was republished in collected editions of Andersen's work, first, on 18 December 1849 in Fairy Tales and again on 15 December 1862 in the first volume of Fairy Tales and Stories. Commentaries Andersen in 1836 \\"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\\" is the first tale Andersen wrote that has neither a literary model nor a folk tale source. It marks a new independence in his writing, and is the zenith of his evocation of the nineteenth-century nursery world with its toy dancers, castles, and swans. Joan G. Haahr writes in The Oxford Companion to Fairy Tales: \\"The story is unusual among Andersen's early tales, both in its emphasis on sensual desire and in its ambiguities. Blind fate, not intention, determines all events. Moreover, the narrative questions the very decorum it praises. The tin soldier's passive acceptance of whatever happens to him, while exemplifying pietistic ideals of self-denial, also contributes to his doom. Were he to speak and act, the soldier might gain both life and love. Restrained, however, by inhibition and convention, he finds only tragedy and death. The tale is often read autobiographically, with the soldier viewed as symbolizing Andersen's feelings of inadequacy with women, his passive acceptance of bourgeois class attitudes, or his sense of alienation as an artist and an outsider, from full participation in everyday life.\\"Zipes 497 Adaptations Illustration by Vilhelm Pedersen, Andersen's first illustrator (1850) Ub Iwerks did a 1934 Cinecolor cartoon based on the story entitled The Brave Tin Soldier. The cartoon's plot is slightly different from the original story. The antagonist is not a Jack-in-the-Box, but rather a toy king who wants the ballerina for himself. The tin soldier attacks the king, and as a result is put on trial and sentenced to death via firing squad. The ballerina pleads for his life to be spared, but her pleas go ignored. She then stands alongside the tin soldier and both are shot into a burning fireplace, where he melts into the shape of a heart with her. The cartoon has a happy ending, as both the tin soldier and ballerina are sent to \\"Toy Heaven\\", where the tin soldier now has both legs. In the 1940 Disney animated film Fantasia, a shorter/shortened version of the tale was planned for the film as indicated by 1938 storyboards. Unfortunately, the ending of the segment did not satisfy Walt Disney and the story was set aside. George Pal's war-themed 1941 Puppetoon, \\"Rhythm in the Ranks\\", is likely a loose adaptation of Andersen's story, with a toy soldier getting discharged after falling in love with an ice-skating ballerina. Paul Grimault (with Jacques Pr√©vert) did a 1947 colour French cartoon Le Petit Soldat that portrayed the title character as a toy acrobat who is called to war and returns crippled but determined to rescue his ballerina. Marcia Brown's 1953 picture book illustrating the story in M. R. James's translation was awarded a Caldecott Honor. Ivo Caprino's 1955 puppet movie \\"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\\". Shawn Phillips's 1964 song 'Little Tin Soldier' is also based on the Hans Christian Andersen tale and was covered by Donovan in 1965. The music video of Anastacia's 2005 song Heavy On My Heart was inspired by The Steadfast Tin Soldier, in which it features mannequins in a shop window. The Small Faces 1967 song Tin Soldier opens with the lyric \\"I am a little tin soldier that wants to jump into your fire\\", and appears to have been influenced by the Andersen story. Andersen's contemporary August Bournonville choreographed the tale for his ballet A Fairy Tale in Pictures, and George Balanchine choreographed the tale in 1975, allowing the soldier and the ballerina to express their love before the ballerina is blown into the fire. Georges Bizet set the tale to music in Jeux d'Enfants. In 1976, Soyuzmultfilm made an animated adaptation. A live action musical adaptation was the second of four episodes of The Enchanted Musical Playhouse that originally aired from 1984 to 1985 on the (then) brand new Disney Channel. In 1985, Harmony Gold made an English dub of The Little Train adaptation of the story, the film was originally made in Italy in the late 70s. In 1986, Atkinson Film-Arts made an animated adaptation featuring the voices of Rick Jones, Terrence Scammell, and Robert Bockstael, with narration by Christopher Plummer. In 1989, Studio Miniatur Filmowych made an animated adaptation. In 1991, it was adapted into an animated television movie as part of Timeless Tales from Hallmark which was produced by Hanna-Barbera and Hallmark. It featured the voices of George Newbern as the Tin Soldier, Megan Mullally as the Ballerina, Tim Curry as the Jack-in-the-box and Paul Williams as a frog named Frogbauten. It was Curry's second clown role after he played Pennywise in It (1990). Children's author Tor Seidler adapted the book in 1992, with illustrations by Fred Marcellino. 1995 saw Jon Voight make his directorial debut with The Tin Soldier, a Showtime family film loosely based on Andersen's story. In 1996, Vivian Little and Kathleen Mills adapted Anderson's story into a full-length ballet for the Dance Fremont studio in Seattle. The ballet is still produced every winter, as an alternative to the popular Christmas ballet The Nutcracker, which many American studios produce in December. Dance Fremont centers the story around a young deaf boy who receives the toys for Christmas, and uses Signed Exact English for all dialogue. In the 2000 Disney animated film Fantasia 2000, an adaptation of the tale is set to the first movement of the Piano Concerto No. 2 in F Major by Dmitri Shostakovich. The segment differs slightly from Andersen's tale: there are only five soldiers, but still only one with one leg; the ballerina appears to be made of porcelain; the soldier is disappointed to discover the ballerina has two legs, but the ballerina still accepts him; at the end, the jack-in-the-box villain is the one that perishes in the fire instead of the soldier and ballerina who both remain in one piece.Andersen 2008 224 Other animated films for children have been produced on the tale, and, in 1975, a science fiction fantasy feature film, The Tin Soldier. In Stieg Larsson's 2006 thriller The Girl Who Played with Fire, the fiercely independent protagonist Lisbeth Salander compares the journalist Mikael Blomkvist, who had stayed loyal to her despite her repeated blatant rejection of him, with Andersen's steadfast tin soldier (implicitly comparing herself with Andersen's ballerina).The Girl Who Played with Fire, Chapter 29. Mike Mignola's graphic novel Baltimore, or The Steadfast Tin Soldier and the Vampire fuses the poignancy of \\"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\\" with supernatural Dracula myths, set in a post-World War I environment.Fiction Reviews: Week of 7/30/2007 at Publishers Weekly. Kate DiCamillo's The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane (2006) makes use of the tale's themes. The Hanson song Soldier is also based on this fairy tale. The song doesn't mention the goblin at all. The tin soldier fell out the window when the wind blew and the tin soldier and ballerina melted together while dancing and the ballerina fell near the fireplace. In Anirudh Arun's 2013 bildungsroman The Steadfast Tin Soldier?, the protagonist Ashwin is compared to the tin soldier by his successful brother Abhinav (the society thus plays the part of the dangerous jack-in-the- box).The Steadfast Tin Soldier?, Chapter \\"There and Back Again\\" Daft Punk's music video for the song \\"Instant Crush\\" is said to have been inspired by \\"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\\".

Most of the area is in the San Isabel and Gunnison National Forests, with a smaller area in the White River National Forest southeast of Aspen. Most of the area is in northwest Chaffee County with smaller portions in Gunnison, Pitkin, and Lake counties. Geography The Collegiate Peaks area includes much of the Sawatch Range and has the highest average elevation of any wilderness area in the United States. Five of the area's peaks are named for famous universities and colleges, including Mt. Harvard, Mt. Oxford, Mt. Yale, Mt. Princeton and Mt. Columbia. These peaks are the source of the name for the wilderness area, which includes them all but Mt. Princeton. Other fourteeners in the area include La Plata Peak, Mount Belford, Huron Peak, and Missouri Mountain. The Collegiate Peaks also includes several notable peaks including the Three Apostles, a chain of three mountains about six miles (10 km) south of the ghost town of Winfield. The middle peak of the Three Apostles is also referred to as Ice Mountain and is generally recognized as one of the most difficult peaks to climb in the Sawatch Range. Notably, the Collegiate Peaks also has two peaks named Grizzly Peak. One is south of Independence Pass at 13,988, and the other is north of Taylor Reservoir on the Continental Divide at 13,281. The area is an important watershed for three rivers on both sides of the Continental Divide: the upper Arkansas River, the Gunnison River, and the Roaring Fork River. There are numerous alpine creeks in the area's wide valleys and these are all quite marshy. Snow does not usually begin to melt until May or June and it remains year-round in places on some of the high peaks. Both the Continental Divide Trail and the Colorado Trail cross the area. The Continental Divide Trail follows the course of the Continental Divide itself with several side spurs. The Colorado Trail passes through the lower eastern portion of the area and crosses Pine Creek, Frenchman Creek and Three Elk Creek all of which drain into the Arkansas River north of Buena Vista. History In earlier times the area was inhabited by various people. There are groves of old growth Ponderosa Pine on the eastern side which bear evidence of stripping by bands of native Utes who inhabited the area and used the bark from living trees for clothing and food. The area is also dotted with the evidence of mining operations from the last century. In the Pine Creek valley - one of the central valleys between Mounts Oxford, Belford and Missouri to the north and Mt. Harvard and Columbia to the south, there is evidence of an earlier settlement on both sides of the stream comprising four cabins and a horse corral. South of the town of Winfield are the spare remains of the town of Harrison at the base of Mt. Huron. The Collegiate Peaks borders several other Colorado wilderness areas including: Buffalo Peaks, Maroon Bells-Snowmass, Hunter-Fryingpan, and Mount Massive. It was designated by congress as a wilderness area in 1980 in accordance with the provisions of the Wilderness Act of 1964.

Aerobic conditioning is the use of continuous, rhythmic movement of large muscle groups to strengthen the heart and lungs (cardiovascular system). Improvement in aerobic conditioning occurs when athletes expose themselves to an increase in oxygen uptake and metabolism, but to keep this level of aerobic conditioning, the athletes must keep or progressively increase their training to increase their aerobic conditioning. Aerobic condition is usually achieved through cardiovascular exercise such as running, swimming, aerobics, etc. A stronger heart does not pump more blood by beating faster but by beating more efficiently. Trained endurance athletes can have resting heart rates as low as the reported 28 beats per minute in people such as Miguel Indurain or 32 beats per minute of Lance Armstrong,The Lance Armstrong Performance Program both of whom were professional cyclists at the highest level.  Cardiovascular conditioning  Aerobic conditioning trains the heart to be more effective at pumping blood around the body, it does this in a multitude of ways: * Increasing the stroke volume of the heart (how much blood the heart is pumping per beat) * Increasing the diameter of the blood vessels, which allows for more blood to be moved through the body, which in turn allows for more oxygen to be diffused into the muscle cells. * Increasing the size of the heart chambers, enlarging the heart so it can hold and pump more blood.  Effect of aerobic conditioning on maximum oxygen intake (Vo2)  Aerobic conditioning has the ability to raise a person's maximum oxygen intake, meaning that they are able to diffuse more oxygen into their blood than they previously could. Although exercising at lower intensities will improve aerobic conditioning, the most rapid gains are made when exercising close to an individual's anaerobic threshold.Arthur Lydiard's Guide to Athletic Training. A Guide to the Brooks/American Track and Field Lydiard Running Lecture Tour 1999 This is the intensity at which the heart and lungs can no longer provide adequate oxygen to the working muscles and an oxygen debt begins to accrue; at this point the exercise becomes anaerobic. Anaerobic training intensity for most individuals will be <85-92% of maximum heart rate.Craig, Neil. \\"Scientific Heart Rate Training.\\" Eureka Quality Printers.1996. Once improvement in aerobic conditioning is apparent, for example in metabolism and oxygen uptake, the body will progressively adapt to further training.Olpin, D. M. (2011, October 14). Benefits of aerobic conditioning. Aerobic conditioning can be anywhere from walking on the treadmill to mowing the lawn. The average healthy person should engage in 150‚Äì200 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise every week. This amount of physical activity should help with maintaining a healthy weight and keeping the cardiovascular system in good condition.Davidson, J. (2011, September 2). Aerobic Vs. Anaerobic Conditioning. LIVESTRONG. Aerobic conditioning has many advantages over anaerobic as it can increase physical endurance and lifespan. During aerobic training, the aim is to improve the blood flow to the lungs, heart, and blood vessels. This particular type of training targets large muscle groups so that as the intensity of physical activity is increased, overall fitness is improved.Mccord, E. (n.d.). Aerobic details.http://www.adapticom1.net/erinmccord/mm/ScieceFair7th/AerobicConditioning- sources.html There are many benefits to aerobic training, and the outcomes can be very rewarding. Aerobic conditioning can increase the duration that one can endure physical activity. This type of conditioning can help with heart disease, diabetes, or anxiety. Aerobic conditioning also has many non-medical benefits, such as improving mood, alleviating fatigue and stabilizing sleeping patterns. This overall type of conditioning has the most longevity to its practice and can improve a person's health and general well being immensely.Am J Lifestyle Med. (2010).

Found in the north-east of the Waiapu Valley, it flows north-east from the joining of the Mata River and the Tapuaeroa River (both of which flow from the Raukumara Ranges), then passes by Ruatoria before reaching the Pacific Ocean at Rangitukia. Other tributaries of the Waiapu River include the Mangaoporo, Poroporo, Wairoa, Maraehara rivers, and the Paoaruku stream. It is the most well known river in the region, and lies within the rohe (territory) of NgƒÅti Porou, the largest iwi (extended kinship group or tribe) on the East Coast, and second largest in New Zealand. The area was the site of hostilities during the New Zealand Wars from June to October in 1865, both between PƒÅkehƒÅ (New Zealand Europeans) and MƒÅori, and between factions of NgƒÅti Porou. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \\"swallowing river\\" for . Environmental issues In 1840, approximately 80% of the Waiapu River catchment area, covering , was native forest, with a rich array of native flora and fauna. There was a small area to the east of the river covered in coastal forest and scrub due to partial clearance and burning. Between 1890 and 1930 there was large-scale clearing, felling and burning of native forests for pastoralism. Floods and heavy rainfall are common to the area, and this, combined with the development, resulted in widespread erosion and large amounts of sediment being deposited in the river. This has changed the landscape significantly. Since the late 1960s, much work has been done to repair the area by planting exotic forests in eroding areas, and encouraging the return of native scrub. However, by 2002 the Waiapu catchment area had few natural habitats remaining. It was 26% exotic Pinus radiata forest, 37% pasture, 21% native forest, and about 12% kƒÅnuka and mƒÅnuka scrub. It was highly degraded and modified, and had extensive and serious erosion problems. About half of the pasture area could be considered erosion-prone and unsustainable. Many of the catchment's rivers were full of sediment, and classed as highly degraded. The river had one of the highest sediment yields in the world (20,520 t/km2/year in 2000), more than two and a half times that of the adjacent catchment area of the Waipaoa River. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this sediment may have adversely affected nearby coastal and marine environments. Approximately one sixth of the annual sediment flow in all New Zealand river systems is in the Waiapu River, which continues to be one of the most sediment laden rivers in the world. The annual suspended sediment load is 36 million tonnes, and of sediment flows into the sea every second. The water quality of the river's tributaries is often much higher, as they are closer to the native vegetation cover of the Raukumara Ranges. In lower areas, much of the eroded gravel from the catchment area settles on the Waiapu riverbed, making it rise rapidly. The riverbed rose between 1986 and 2007, and a number of bridges over Waiapu's tributaries have had to be raised to accommodate their rising riverbeds. As the riverbed rises, so does the river, which is causing extensive riverbank erosion. The banks eroded at a rate of per year between 1988 and 1997. By the 2003 to 2008 period this rate had doubled, with per year eroding in 2005 and 2006. This erosion threatens the town of Ruatoria, and groynes have been installed in an attempt to divert the river away from the town. MƒÅori history and significance Paepae pƒÅtaka (threshold of a storehouse) in the Waiapu Valley MƒÅori settlement of the Waiapu Valley, surrounding the Waiapu River, was widespread until the 1880s. The river and valley are within the rohe (territory) of NgƒÅti Porou, and is of immense cultural, spiritual, economic, and traditional value to them. According to traditional beliefs, NgƒÅti Porou have had an undisturbed relationship with the river since the time of MƒÅui, and the river serves to unite those who live on either side of it. The valley, which they call Te Riu o Waiapu, was a place where they could live, offering safe refuge during periods of war, and supplies of fresh water and various species of fish. In 1840, NgƒÅti Porou extensively cultivated the area around the river. The significance of the river is expressed in the following whakataukƒ´ or pepeha (sayings or proverbs): > Ko Hikurangi te maunga, Ko Waiapu te awa, Ko NgƒÅti Porou te iwi (Hikurangi > the mountain, Waiapu the river, Ngati Porou the people) > Hoake tƒÅua ki Waiapu ki tƒÅtara e maru ana. (Let us shelter under the thick > matted cloak of Waiapu.) The first MƒÅori church was built on the banks of the Waiapu river in the 1830s. WhakawhitirƒÅ PƒÅ, in which the church was located, was described to Richard Taylor as the largest in the region. Just prior to 1840, the pƒÅ had approximately 3,000 inhabitants. Taylor's drawing of the church, done after visiting in April 1839, can be viewed here. Many NgƒÅti Porou hap≈´ (subtribes or clans) still live in the area, and the valley has a large number of marae. In 2002, the population was approximately 90% MƒÅori, and traditional culture is still practised in the area ‚Äî though it has changed significantly in the last 150 years. Since they arrived, the many hap≈´ that live alongside the Waiapu River have been responsible for preserving the mauri (special nature) of the river, and the hap≈´ of the valley act as kaitiakitanga (guardians) of the river and its tributaries. The techniques the iwi use to catch kahawai at the mouth of the river are unique to that river, and are considered sacred. NgƒÅti Porou believe that taniwha (water spirits or monsters) dwell in and protect the river, in turn protecting the valley and its hap≈´. Taniwha believed to be in Waiapu River include Kotuwainuku, Kotuwairangi, Ohinewaiapu, and Ngungurutehorowhatu. According to an affidavit of Hapukuniha Te Huakore Karaka, two taniwha were placed in strategic locations in the river to protect the hap≈´ from invading tribes ‚Äî one near Paoaruku (a locality at ) and one at the Wairoa River (a small creek at ). Karaka said that a bridge was built from Tikitiki to Waiomatatini, to the protest of local MƒÅori who were concerned that it would disturb the taniwha. The night before the bridge was completed, a storm came washing the bridge away ‚Äî the weather till then had been calm. From then, one person would drown in the river nearly every year. If it did not happen one year, two would drown the next. A local tohunga, George Gage (Hori Te Kou-o-rehua Keeti) was approached to help the situation, and after that there were no similar drownings. The deforestation and land development of the area has had a huge negative impact on MƒÅori. In December 2010, NgƒÅti Porou signed a settlement deal with the New Zealand Government for various grievances, some of which relate to the Waiapu Valley. The settlement included a million financial redress, and the return of sites culturally significant to the iwi totally approximately . Current use The high level of sediment in Waiapu River means it is undesirable as a source of drinking water, however local marae and small communities have been known to use the water for domestic purposes on occasion. Farmers also allow livestock to drink directly from small streams flowing into the Waiapu River. There are no consents to take, use or dam water on the river or its tributaries, however a mini-hydro power station is expected to be operating in 2012 on a small stream in the catchment area. As very little water is taken from Waiapu River or its tributaries, the Gisborne District Council decided it was not necessary to implement the usual water plan regulating water usage in the district. However, a nationwide focus on freshwater policy means that a water plan for the river will be developed with the guidance of the Gisborne Freshwater Advisory Group. This plan is likely to be completed by 2016, and will cover \\"its cultural, recreational, ecological, environmental, amenity and commercial values\\". Gravel deposited by the river onto shingle beaches near its mouth is extracted at approximately 12 different sites, predominantly for use on nearby rural and forestry roads. The Waitahaia River, which flows into the Waiapu River through the Mata River, is renowned for its brown trout ‚Äî a European species of fish introduced into New Zealand for fishing in the late 1860s.

The last locally-owned radio station in Orange County, New York (and one of the few in the entire Hudson Valley), WTBQ broadcasts on 1110 AM and 93.5 FM, throughout Orange County and Northern New Jersey. The station has a diversified format consisting of news, oldies music, specialty music shows, talk shows, and specialty programming. History Local media figure Ed Klein brought WTBQ to air July 27, 1969 with studios originally located in the village of Warwick. The call letters come from Klein's young daughter's affection for her teddy bear. Originally, WTBQ had a \\"Beautiful Music\\" format (dubbed \\"The Casual Q\\"), in contrast to Top 40 music, which Klein hated. WTBQ also had a strong emphasis on news, both local and national (the station was a Mutual Broadcasting System affiliate in the 1970s before later switching to ABC). In the mid-1970s the station evolved to more of a Middle Of The Road format. By 1978, the station switched to a \\"town and country\\" format playing half Adult Contemporary songs and half country music. In 1982, WTBQ was purchased by Jimmy Sturr, who in 1984 moved the studios to the \\"Professional Building\\" at 62 North Main Street in nearby Florida, New York. The station moved to more of a Mainstream Adult Contemporary music format but ran Jimmy Sturr's Polka Show once a week on the weekend. After another change in ownership (to George Dacre's \\"Goodtime Broadcasting\\") later in the 1980s, the station switched to Adult Standards. By the early 1990s, the station had financial problems and went silent on May 8, 1993.[Radio station license for sale; The Journal News, (White Plains, NY), August 22, 1993, p.B6] In May 1994, the station's current owner Frank \\"Smokin'\\" Truatt bought the station, returning it to the air on July 1, 1994. From its inception, WTBQ has been strictly an AM \\"daytimer\\", signing on 15 minutes before dawn and signing off 15 minutes after dusk, with exceptions are made in event of a local news emergency such as a snowstorm. Still, WTBQ became the first station in the Hudson Valley to carry its programs on the internet in 1999; it was also the first area radio station with a website, back in 1995. Beginning in 1997, WTBQ began adding more specialty shows on weekends such as a polka show, classic country music show, NASCAR racing, an Irish program, a diversified music show, among others. By 1999, the station was running mostly specialty shows on weekends and a few during the week. By about 2003, the station began gradually adding more such programming during the week. On November 30, 2007, WTBQ moved from the Village of Florida back to Warwick. Ed Klein died on October 18, 2008, at the age of 86. WTBQ celebrated its 40th anniversary with a special ceremony at the station's broadcasting tower where a plaque was placed at the antenna site, honoring Ed Klein for having signed-on the station in 1969. Also, in 2008, WTBQ would add an FM translator station, allowing the station to broadcast 24 hours a day, boosting station listening and sales. In June 2012, WTBQ moved to Sanfordville Road. On July 1, 2014, local officials (including State Senator William Larkin and Orange County Executive Steve Neuhaus) honored Frank Truatt's 20 years of independent ownership and giving back to the community. A January 2014 article in The Wall Street Journal honored Frank Truatt for owning one of the last of the real \\"community\\" radio stations in the New York metro area. FM translator At 1:30 pm on January 28, 2011, WTBQ switched its FM frequency to 93.5 MHz, after just more than three years at 99.1 MHz. The new translator, W228CG, broadcasts at 250 watts. A considerable upgrade from the previous 19 watts, the coverage area is about 50% larger than on 99.1. WTBQ became one of the first American AM stations to use an FM translator when it began airing on W256BD on January 25, 2008. The arrangement, made possible by a Special Temporary Authority from the Federal Communications Commission and Digital Radio Broadcasting, allowed WTBQ to broadcast its programs 24 hours a day via an FM antenna located on WTBQ's AM broadcast tower. The new translator also broadcasts from WTBQ's tower, located in the Town of Warwick. Beginning in April 2019, WTBQ began a simulcast on WGHT AM 1500 in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey.

In his later years he created hundreds of paintings, drawings, and sculptures that attempt to capture and express his perspective on the culture of Krishna consciousness. Honorifics * His Holiness * Srila Gurupada * Paramahamsa * Maharaja * pure devotee  Early years  He was born Stephen Guarino, the elder of two children, to Italian Roman Catholic parents in Staten Island, New York. He was educated initially in a public high school nearby and then enrolled in the Brooklyn College, where he underwent an intellectual revolution putting in question his Catholic values. In the college he read Nietzsche and Dostoevsky and associated with students and professors who were religious skeptics. In January 1962 he joined the Navy, where he served for two years on board of U.S.S. Saratoga, a super-carrier. In his introduction to With ≈örƒ´la PrabhupƒÅda in the Early Days, 1966‚Äì1969 he writes: \\"A few months after the death of President Kennedy, I was honorably discharged, and without visiting my parents on Staten Island, I went directly to the Lower East Side. By then, the Lower East Side was, in my mind and in the minds of my friends, the most mystical place in the world.\\" \\"I certainly didn't think some guru was suddenly going to appear and save me. I was too cynical. Yet I was regularly reading versions of the Bhagavad-gita and the Upanishads. Ironically, one week before the gift shop at 26 Second Avenue changed into Srila Prabhupada's temple, I was standing in that very doorway with a Bhagavad-gita in my back pocket, waiting to meet a friend. Somehow we had chosen 26 Second Avenue as a meeting place. At that time, I had no idea what was about to happen.\\" Bhaktivedanta Swami in 1974 In July 1966 he met and accepted a spiritual instruction from A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami who registered ISKCON a month later. Bhaktivedanta Swami soon began assigning him typing tasks which Satsvarupa understood \\"to be yoga\\".John P Reis, God is Not Dead; He Has Simply Changed Clothes: A Study of the International Society for K·πõ·π£·πáa Consciousness University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1975, p.145 On September 23, 1966 he was ordained and shortly became one of the leading figures of the new Gaudiya Vaishnava movement.Letter by Bhaktivedanta Swami, November 11, 1967 to Brahmananda, \\"I do not want crowd of Kirtananandas but I want a single soul like Brahmananda, Mukunda, Rayarama, and _Satsvarupa_. The same example is always applicable that one moon is sufficient for the night as not thousands of stars ... Without being empowered by Krishna, nobody can preach Krishna Consciousness. It is not academic qualification or financial strength which helps in these matters, but it is sincerity of purpose which helps us always. Therefore, I wish that you will remain in charge of New York, let _Satsvarupa_ be in charge of Boston, Let Mukunda be in charge of San Francisco ... Letters quote After Bhaktivedanta Swami died, he was one of eleven disciples selected to become an initiating guru in ISKCON. Prof. Larry Shinn in his overview of the contemporary state of the Bhaktivedanta Swami's movement confirms this while relating his first meeting with Satsvarupa dasa Goswami: In a typical initiation ceremony as a guru of International Society for Krishna Consciousness he would begin with purification using achamana (holy water) and concludes with a sermon on the importance of chanting of the holy names in the life of a new initiate. Personal servant of Bhaktivedanta Swami In addition to periods of being a GBC personal assistant, the brief period between January and July 1974 during which he had the opportunity to act as a personal servant and secretary to the founder of ISKCON, Bhaktivedanta Swami, is noted. During this time his duties included bringing Bhaktivedanta Swami his medicine and toothbrush in the morning, accompanying him on his morning walk, preparing his breakfast and lunch and providing his daily massage. In other words, the tasks were those of a menial servant, while Satsvarupa das Goswami was excited about it. Some note that the first time Satsvarupa gave Bhaktivedanta Swami a massage it was \\"an intense spiritual experience\\" for him: One may understand how the service given to one's guru can be of such a value by seeing it in the ritual religious context. The theme of status difference, enriched with the idea of intimacy, coalesce in this simple pattern of devotee massaging the spiritual master's legs and feet in the cultural models expressed in puja and innumerable other Vaishnava contexts. Satsvarupa took the posture of a menial servant with evident relish. It is also taken as an example of ideal typical model of the guru-disciple relationship as a disciple should always consider him- or herself a menial servant of the spiritual master.  Literary contribution  As a writer he is following a line of teachers or gurus in his religious tradition. In his review Srivatsa Goswami suggests this view with a reference to the \\"path of Six Goswamis\\": Satsvarupa dasa Goswami's writing represents a contemporary variety from commentaries on scriptures to a free flowing poetry and prose.Goswami,One Hundred Prabhupada Poems. 1995 His writings were translated to over forty languages by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust and Gita Nagari Press.

Diaries and the letters collection from Bhaktivedanta Swami are spanning from the very beginning of the movement in 1966 in the West and provide an account of the ISKCON movement from the very first years to present days. Martin Palmer, Director of the International Consultancy on Religion, Education and Culture and Religious Adviser to World Wide Fund for Nature wrote of his book Entering the Life of Prayer 'I recommend this book to any who are genuinely wrestling with the implications of faith and with the path of prayer. It deserves to become a spiritual classic.' =Art and poetry= A number of his poetical works were published in modern American idiom. He was also published in prominent Haiku magazines, the poetry dedicated to Bhaktivedanta Swami's glorification received positive reviews.

Chryssides, Margaret Wilkins. 2006, Continuum International Publishing Group  Brief history in ISKCON Early days= After ISKCON's incorporation in July 1966 at 26 Second Avenue, Satsvarupa dasa was engaged as A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami's personal typist and ISKCON secretary for the first year.Passage from India: The Life and Times of His Divine Grace A.C Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, Steven Rosen, Satsvar≈´pa DƒÅsa GoswƒÅmƒ´, 1992, Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers, Page 99 He was one of the few devotees who maintained outside jobs to support the ISKCON temple at the beginning. Later he managed ISKCON Boston, and ISKCON Press which was later registered as Bhaktivedanta Book Trust. After assuming duties of a GBC (Governing Body Commissioner) in 1970, Satsvarupa was asked by Bhaktivedanta Swami to accept the order of sannyasa in 1972. He accepted sannyasa along with other GBC members, all of whom were originally married men, such as Tamala Krishna Goswami and Hridayananda dasa Goswami. At the time A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami awarded him and other followers the title \\"Goswami\\" with the single line instruction: \\"Preach, preach, preach!\\" He is sometimes listed among active promoters of ahimsa among other Eastern religious teachers. During diksa ceremony in 1979 =Preaching and traveling= Main preaching activities by the means of traveling sankirtana parties were centered in United States. BBT (Bhaktivedanta Book Trust) Library Party headed by him in mid-1970s was active in establishing distribution network mainly to the Universities of the United States, with some members of the team such as Bhakti Tirtha Swami and Suhotra Dasa traveling as far as Eastern Europe. In 1974, Satsvarupa dasa Goswami was requested by Bhaktivedanta Swami to join him as traveling GBC servant, replacing previous servant Srutakirti Dasa and travelled as a menial servant around the globe. =Managing BTG= From the early days of ISKCON, the Back to Godhead magazine Back to Godhead ‚Äì official magazine of ISKCON was project required a lot of both contribution and supervision. Popular Religious Magazines of the United States ‚Äì Page 61 by Mark Fackler, Charles H. Lippy, 1995 Satsvarupa dasa Goswami was editor in chief and one of the main contributors to this magazine till 1991, when assisted editor Jayadvaita Swami took over as the editor in chief. =Dealing with early \\"zonal acarya\\" days= In accordance with ISKCON GBC Governing Body Commission resolutions March 1978 Satsvarupa dasa Goswami along with other eleven Governing Body Commissioners assumed duties and services of initiating disciples in assigned zones after the death of Bhaktivedanta Swami.See: Back to Godhead, Notes from the Editor, #1301/02 1978 Initial preaching areas in the United States and Caribbean were expanded with an addition of Ireland in 1982 where he became a zonal acharya. The assumption of equal status to Bhaktivedanta Swami and the title of \\"Guru-Acarya\\" are still surrounded in a controversy. While following the direction of Governing Body Commission, Satsvarupa dasa Goswami was one of the pioneers who attempted to reform the system, by assuming more humble and appropriate role of a guru as per recorded instructions of the \\"Founder-Acarya.\\" While imitation of Bhaktivedanta Swami was criticised, despite these warnings, specifically by Satsvarupa dasa Goswami, such imitation sometimes resulted in curious side-effects and many devotees adopted Bhaktivedanta Swami's mannerisms. This remained evident especially among the older American devotees who even now speak with an Indian accent and display many of Bhaktivedanta Swami's gestures like turning one's head or moving one's hand in a certain way. At the Houston Book Fair, 2005 =Later years= In years 1978‚Äì1985 he took part in a controversial zonal acarya system in a position of an Acharya while initiating reform of a high standard of worship. In 1986‚Äì1987 a number of senior members and newly appointed GBC members with the support of Satsvarupa dasa Goswami reformed ISKCON guru system, lowering unprecedented level of worship reserved to initiating gurus in ISKCON. He was called as the \\"most vocal in the cause of reform\\" in ISKCON. Satsvarupa dasa Goswami recorded this period in his book Guru Reform Notebook (1987). Throughout the years that followed, up until the end of the century, new ISKCON guru system was further developed. In 1999 Governing Body Commission confirmed GBC Emeritus status of his membership of the Governing Body of ISKCON. Satsvarupa dasa Goswami (left) with his disciple Yadunandana Swami, summer 2009 His extensive traveling in Europe in 1990s included areas of Scandinavia, Eastern, Central Europe and Italy, but mainly centered in preaching in Ireland and UK. In following years, his devotional life has included the creation of hundreds of paintings, drawings, and sculptures that capture and express the artist's vision of Krishna consciousness. His latest literary work is centered on his commentary on Bhagavata Purana known as A Poor Man Reads the Bhagavatam. In 2002, he suffered a physical and emotional collapse from chronic migraine headaches, a condition that required immediate medical intervention and treatment. In consultation with the official governing body of the Krishna consciousness society, he agreed to cease initiating disciples.Satsvarupa dasa Goswami, Visitors in About the Author, (2007) With the GBC consultation, he retained his Goswami title and continued in the sannyasa order and as an ISKCON guru.List of Sannyasis in ISKCON April 2008 ISKCON Sannyasa Ministry, Retrieved on 2008-05-05 Following a period of health recovery, at the age of 68, Satsvarupa dasa Goswami took residence in the East Coast United States where he is engaging in a number of preaching activities, such as regular lecturing and traveling to the holy dhamas.

His file is still not fully disclosed and will be held until 2025 in the FSB archives. It was not until 1990 that Kuznetsov was officially recognized as a NKVD agent. He used several pseudonyms during his intelligence operations: e.g. Rudolf Schmidt, Nikolai Vasilevitsh Grachev (–ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–π –í–∞—Å–∏–ª—å–µ–≤–∏—á –ì—Ä–∞—á—ë–≤) and Oberleutnant Paul Siebert. Kuznetsov was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. Biography Kuznetsov was born into a peasant family of Russian ethnicity in the Yekaterinburgsky Uyezd of the Perm Governorate of the Russian Empire (present- day Sverdlovsk Oblast, Russia). He studied forestry in a technical school and, after discovering his linguistic talents, learned the German, Esperanto, Polish, Ukrainian and Mordvinic languages (particularly Erzya language). In 1926, at age 15, Kuznetsov enrolled at Tyumen Agricultural College but did not finish and was forced to return home because of the death of his father. During that time Kuznetsov joined the ranks of the Komsomol. At home he enrolled in the local forestry college but in 1929 Kuznetsov was accused of having counter-revolutionary origins and excluded from Komsomol and the college. After moving in 1930 to Kudymkar (Komi-Permyak Autonomous Okrug) Kuznetsov was recruited by the local department of the OGPU. In 1932 he enrolled into Sverdlovsk Industrial Institute and continued to study German and other foreign languages. In 1938 Kuznetsov moved to Moscow and joined the NKVD, his tasks included posing as a Volga German and collecting intelligence about German diplomats in Moscow.–ú–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–µ –ø–æ–¥–≤–∏–≥–∏ ¬´–ö–æ–ª–æ–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–∞¬ª In disguise in Wehrmacht uniform. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union Kuznetsov, at his own request, was sent to join Soviet partisan units in the Nazi-occupied Ukraine. In 1942, the same year he became a member of the Communist Party, he fought as a member of the guerrilla group \\"Victors\\", led by Dmitry Medvedev, in central and western Ukraine. Kuznetsov was in charge of several complex operations involving assassinations and kidnappings of high-ranking Nazi officials in the Rivne and Lviv regions, such as successful operations against the German- appointed chief judge of Ukraine, the vice-governor of Galicia, the adviser to the Reichskommissar of Ukraine, three German generals and others. Kuznetsov was also the first intelligence agent to uncover German plans to launch a massive tank attack in the Kursk region, and information about German V-2 rockets, as well as about Operation Long Jump, Hitler's plan to assassinate the heads of the USSR, USA and Great Britain during the Tehran Conference. Kuznetsov was operating in Rivne (the capital of Reichskommissariat Ukraine) using the fake German identity of Oberleutnant Paul Siebert. It was Kuznetsov who obtained information about the location of Hitler's \\"Werwolf\\" headquarters, near the city of Vinnitsya. According to official Soviet version, Kuznetsov was killed in a firefight with members of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army near the city of Brody on March 9, 1944. In another version by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, Kuznetsov and his associates were detained in the village of Boratyn near Brody, dressed as German soldiers. To avoid being discovered, Kuznetsov blew himself up with a grenade.Shpak, V. Legends of Nikolai Kuznetsov. Uryadovy Kuryer. 30 July 2011. Kuznetsov is currently buried in Lviv, Ukraine. Since 2003, several unsuccessful attempts have been made to rebury him in Russia. A 2007 attempt was stopped by the Russian Foreign Ministry, which claimed that \\"such a move would open a kind of Pandora‚Äôs box and give Ukrainian nationalists a reason to launch a campaign to transfer other graves of Soviet soldiers buried in Ukraine.\\" An 2018 attempt was prevented by the Lviv authorities, who claimed that such a reburial could not be considered while Ukrainian prisoners where being held captive in Russia during an ongoing Russian military intervention in Ukraine.

Minor planet 2233 Kuznetsov, discovered in 1972 by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Zhuravlyova, is named after him.

() is a 1952 Italian neorealist film directed by Vittorio De Sica. Most of the actors were non-professional, including Carlo Battisti who plays the title role of Umberto Domenico Ferrari, a poor elderly man in Rome who is desperately trying to keep his rented room. His landlady (Lina Gennari) is evicting him, and his only true friends, the housemaid (Maria-Pia Casilio) and his dog Flike (called 'Flag' in some subtitled versions of the film) are of no help. According to Robert Osborne of Turner Classic Movies, this was De Sica's favorite of all his films. The movie was included in TIME magazine's \\"All-TIME 100 Movies\\" in 2005. The film's sets were designed by Virgilio Marchi. Plot Police disperse an organized street demonstration of elderly men demanding a raise in their meager pensions. One of the marchers is Umberto D. Ferrari, a retired government worker. He returns to his room, and finds that his landlady has rented it out for an hour to an amorous couple. She threatens to evict Ferrari at the end of the month if he cannot pay the overdue rent: fifteen thousand lire. He sells a watch and some books, but only raises a third of the amount. The landlady refuses to accept partial payment. Meanwhile, the sympathetic maid confides in Umberto that she has her own problems. She is three months pregnant, but is unsure which of two soldiers is the father, the tall one from Naples or the short one from Florence. Feeling ill, Umberto gets himself admitted to a hospital; it turns out to be tonsillitis, and he is discharged after a few days. When he returns to the apartment, he finds workmen renovating the entire place. The landlady is getting married. Umberto's room has a gaping hole in the wall; the maid tells him it is to become part of an enlarged living room. The maid was taking care of his dog, Flike, but a door was left open and Flike ran away. Umberto rushes to the city pound, and is relieved to find his dog. However, when he makes a veiled plea for a loan to one of his friends who has a job, the friend refuses to listen. Unable to bring himself to beg from strangers on the street, Umberto contemplates suicide, but knows he must first see that Flike is taken care of. He packs his belongings, and leaves the apartment. His parting advice to the maid is to get rid of the boyfriend from Florence. Umberto attempts to find a place for Flike, first with a couple who board dogs, then a little girl he knows, but the latter's nanny makes her give the dog back. Flike goes to play with some children, and Umberto slips away, gambling that one of them will adopt him. Despite Umberto's attempt to abandon Flike, the dog finds him hiding under a footbridge. Finally in desperation, Umberto takes the dog in his arms and walks on to a railway track as a speeding train approaches. Flike becomes frightened, wriggles free and flees. Umberto runs after him. At first Flike warily hides, but eventually Umberto coaxes Flike out to play with a pine cone. Still homeless and nearly penniless, Umberto scampers down the park lane with his dog.

Subsequently, they saw Umberto D. as too critical of the pride they were trying to engender in themselves. It was, however, quite popular overseas and the film he remained most proud of (even dedicating the film to his father). In an interview where he discussed Diary of a Country Priest, Psycho and Citizen Kane, Ingmar Bergman is quoted as saying, \\"Umberto D. is... a movie I have seen a hundred times, that I may love most of all.\\" Roger Ebert included the film in his selection of Great Movies, writing \\"Vittorio De Sica's Umberto D (1952) is the story of the old man's struggle to keep from falling from poverty into shame. It may be the best of the Italian neorealist films--the one that is most simply itself, and does not reach for its effects or strain to make its message clear.\\" =Awards and nominations= * Vittorio De Sica was nominated for the Grand Prix ‚Äì 1952 Cannes Film Festival * 1955 New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Foreign Film * Cesare Zavattini was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Story at the 29th Academy Awards in 1957 Remake A French remake entitled A Man and His Dog premiered in 2008.

It is probably the most important Hindu shrine in the city. The temple derives its name from a black statue of Lord Rama. The literal translation of kalaram is \\"black Rama\\". The sanctum sanctorum also houses the statues of the goddess Sita and the god Lakshmana. Thousands of devotees visit it every day. History The original temple of Lord Rama was very old, estimated to be of the Rashtrakuta Period from 7th to 11th centuries. However ,antiquity of the Rama idol threw light on the fact that it was more 2000 years.The original temple was destroyed was greatly destroyed by Muslim rulers and it remained in demolished condition. However, during the first Islamic attack on the Temple, the idol of Lord was thrown in the Godavari River by the Temple Brahmins in order to save it.The new temple was funded by Sardar Rangarao Odhekar, and was rebuilt around 1788.Once , Odhekar had a dream that the statue of Rama in black colour was in the Godavari River.He carried out expedition of reviving the idol and miraculously got it. Odhekar took the statue from river and built the temple.Odhekar's expedition is an important part of Nashik's history. There is a statue of Sardar Odhekar in the temple. According to ancient epic of the Ramayana, Lord Rama was sent in exile for fourteen years. After the tenth year of exile, Lord Rama along with Lakshman and Seeta, lived for two and half years on the northern bank of the Godavari near Nasik. This place is known as Panchavati. The temple formed a pivotal role in the Dalit movement in India. B. R. Ambedkar led a protest outside the temple on 2 March 1930, in order to allow Dalits into the temple. Temple complex 1) The main entrance has a Lord Hanuman deity which is black. There is also a very old tree that has Lord Dattatreya's footprint impressions marked on a stone. Pilgrims visit the Kapaleshwar Mahadev temple near the Kalaram Temple. 2) Lord Hanuman's temple is designed in such a way that, Lord Ram's idol can be visible from Lord Hanuman's idol. 3) Main temple of Ram has 14 steps, which represents 14 years of Ram's exile. 4) Also, the temple has 84 pillars, which represents cycle of 84 lakh species one has to go in order to get Human birth.

Constructivist approaches to human learning have led to the development of the theory of cognitive apprenticeship.Collins, A., Brown, J. S., & Newman, S. E. (1987). Cognitive apprenticeship: Teaching the craft of reading, writing and mathematics (Technical Report No. 403). BBN Laboratories, Cambridge, MA. Centre for the Study of Reading, University of Illinois. January, 1987.Brown, J. S., Collins, A., & Duguid, P. (1989). Situated cognition and the culture of learning. Educational Researcher, 18, 32-42. This theory accounts for the problem that masters of a skill often fail to take into account the implicit processes involved in carrying out complex skills when they are teaching novices. To combat these tendencies, cognitive apprenticeships \\"‚Ä¶are designed, among other things, to bring these tacit processes into the open, where students can observe, enact, and practice them with help from the teacher‚Ä¶\\". This model is supported by Albert Bandura's (1997) theory of modeling, which posits that in order for modeling to be successful, the learner must be attentive, access and retain the information presented, be motivated to learn, and be able to accurately reproduce the desired skill.  Overview  Part of the effectiveness of the cognitive apprenticeship model comes from learning in context and is based on theories of situated cognition. Cognitive scientists maintain that the context in which learning takes place is critical (e.g., Godden & Baddeley, 1975). Based on findings such as these, Collins, Duguid, and Brown (1989) argue that cognitive apprenticeships are less effective when skills and concepts are taught independently of their real-world context and situation. As they state, \\"Situations might be said to co-produce knowledge through activity. Learning and cognition, it is now possible to argue, are fundamentally situated\\". In cognitive apprenticeships, teachers model their skills in real-world situations. By modelling and coaching, masters in cognitive apprenticeships also support the three stages of skill acquisition described in the expertise literature: the cognitive stage, the associative stage, and the autonomous stage.Anderson, J.R. (1983). The architecture of cognition. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University PressFitts, P.M., & Posner, M.I. (1967). Human performance. Belmont, CA: Brooks Cole. In the cognitive stage, learners develop a declarative understanding of the skill. In the associative stage, mistakes and misinterpretations learned in the cognitive stage are detected and eliminated, while associations between the critical elements involved in the skill are strengthened. Finally, in the autonomous stage, the learner's skill becomes honed and perfected until it is executed at an expert level.Anderson, J.R. (2000). Cognitive psychology and its implications. New York, NY: Worth Publishers. Like traditional apprenticeships, in which the apprentice learns a trade such as tailoring or woodworking by working under a master teacher, cognitive apprenticeships allow masters to model behaviors in a real-world context with cognitive modeling.Bandura, A. (1997). Social Learning Theory. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall. After listening to the master explain exactly what they are doing and thinking as they model the skill, the apprentice identifies relevant behaviors and develops a conceptual model of the processes involved. The apprentice then attempts to imitate those behaviors as the master observes and coaches. Coaching provides assistance at the most critical level‚Äì the skill level just beyond what the learner/apprentice could accomplish by themself. Vygotsky (1978) referred to this as the Zone of Proximal Development and believed that fostering development within this zone would lead to the most rapid development. The coaching process includes providing additional modeling as necessary, giving corrective feedback, and giving reminders, which all intend to bring the apprentice's performance closer to that of the master's. As the apprentice becomes more skilled through the repetition of this process, the feedback and instruction provided by the master \\"fades\\" until the apprentice is, ideally, performing the skill at a close approximation of the master level.Johnson, S.D. (1992). A framework for technology education curricula which emphasizes intellectual processes. Journal of Technology Education, 3; 1-11.  Teaching methods  Collins, Brown, and Newman developed six teaching methods rooted in cognitive apprenticeship theory and claim these methods help students attain cognitive and metacognitive strategies for \\"using, managing, and discovering knowledge\\". The first three, modeling, coaching, scaffolding, are at the core of cognitive apprenticeship and help with cognitive and metacognitive development. The next two, articulation and reflection, are designed to help novices with awareness of problem-solving strategies and execution similar to that of an expert. The final step, exploration, intends to guide the novice towards independence and the ability to solve and identify problems within the domain on their own. The authors note, however, that this is not an exhaustive list of methods and that the successful execution of these methods is highly dependent on the domain. = Modeling = Modeling is when an expert, usually a teacher, within the cognitive domain or subject area demonstrates a task explicitly so that novices, usually a student, can experience and build a conceptual model of the task at hand. For example, a math teacher might write out explicit steps and work through a problem aloud, demonstrating their heuristics and procedural knowledge. Modeling includes demonstrating expert performances or processes in the world. = Coaching = Coaching involves observing a novice's task performance and offering feedback and hints to sculpt the novice's performance to that of an expert's. The expert oversees the novice's tasks and may structure the task accordingly to assist the novice's development. = Scaffolding = Instructional scaffolding is the act of applying strategies and methods to support the student's learning. These supports could be teaching manipulatives, activities, or group work. The teacher may have to execute parts of the task that the student is not yet able to do. This requires the teacher to have the skill to analyze and assess students' abilities in the moment. = Articulation = Articulation includes \\"any method of getting students to articulate their knowledge, reasoning, or problem-solving process in a domain\\" (p. 482). Three types of articulation are inquiry teaching, thinking aloud, and critical student role. Through inquiry teaching (Collins & Stevens, 1982), teachers ask students a series of questions that allow them to refine and restate their learned knowledge and form explicit conceptual models. Thinking aloud requires students to articulate their thoughts while solving problems. Students assuming a critical role monitor others in cooperative activities and draw conclusions based on the problem-solving activities. Articulation is described by McLellanMcLellan, H. (1994). Situated learning: Continuing the conversation. Educational Technology 34, 7- 8. as consisting of two aspects: separating component knowledge from skills to learn more effectively, and more commonly verbalizing or demonstrating knowledge and thinking processes in order to expose and clarify ideas. = Reflection = Reflection allows students to \\"compare their own problem-solving processes with those of an expert, another student, and ultimately, an internal cognitive model of expertise\\" (p. 483). A technique for reflection would be examining the past performances of both an expert and a novice, and highlighting similarities and differences. The goal of reflection is for students to look back and analyze their performances with desire to understand and improve the behavior of an expert. = Exploration = Exploration involves giving students room to problem solve on their own and teaching students exploration strategies. The former requires the teacher to slowly withdraw the use of supports and scaffolds not only in problem solving methods, but problem setting methods as well. The latter requires the teacher to show students how to explore, research, and develop hypotheses. Exploration allows the student to frame interesting problems within the domain for themselves and then take the initiative to solve these problems.

(2003) Rooting Multiculturalism: The Work of Louis Adamic, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, Background Praproƒçe Manor, birthplace of Louis Adamic Alojz Adamiƒç was born at Praproƒçe Mansion in Praproƒçe pri Grosupljem in the region of Lower Carniola, in what is now Slovenia (then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire). The oldest son of a peasant family, he was given a limited childhood education at the city school and, in 1909, entered the primary school at Ljubljana. Early in his third year he joined a secret students' political club associated with the Yugoslav Nationalistic Movement that had recently sprung up in the South-Slavic provinces of Austria-Hungary. Swept up in a bloody demonstration in November 1913, Adamic was briefly jailed, expelled from school, and barred from any government educational institution. He was admitted to the Jesuit school in Ljubljana, but was unable to bring himself to go. \\"No more school for me. I was going to America,\\" Adamic wrote. \\"I did not know how, but I knew that I would go.\\"Adamic, Louis. Laughing in the Jungle: The Autobiography of an Immigrant in America. New York and London: Harper & Brothers, 1932. Reprinted by Arno Press and The New York Times, 1969; pp. 10‚Äì35. On 31 December 1913, at the age of 15, Adamiƒç emigrated to the United States.In his author's note to his autobiography, Laughing in the Jungle (1932), Adamic describes himself as being \\"a boy of fourteen and a half\\" in 1913, when he left his native country for America (p. ix). \\"Late in the afternoon of the last day of 1913 I was examined for entry into the United States, with about a hundred other immigrants who had come on the Niagara (p. 43). He finally settled in a heavily ethnic Croatian fishing community of San Pedro, California. He became a naturalized United States citizen in 1918 as Louis Adamic. Career Adamic first worked as a manual laborer and later at a Yugoslavian daily newspaper, Narodni Glas (\\"The Voice of the Nation\\"), that was published in New York. As an American soldier he participated in combat on the Western front during the First World War. After the war he worked as a journalist and professional writer. All of Adamic's writings are based on his labor experiences in America and his former life in Slovenia. He achieved national acclaim in America in 1934 with his book The Native's Return, which was a bestseller directed against King Alexander's regime in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. This book gave many Americans their first real knowledge of the Balkans. It contained many insights, but proved far from infallible: Adamic predicted that America would prosper by eventually \\"going left\\", i.e. turning socialist. He received the Guggenheim Fellowship award in 1932. During the Second World War he had supported the Yugoslav National liberation struggle and the establishment of a socialist Yugoslav federation. He founded the United Committee of South-Slavic Americans in support of Marshal Tito. From 1949 he was a corresponding member of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. From 1940 onwards he served as editor of the magazine Common Ground. Adamic was the author of Dynamite: The Story of Class Violence in America (1931); Laughing in the Jungle: The Autobiography of an Immigrant in America (1932); The Native's Return: An American Immigrant Visits Yugoslavia and Discovers His Old Country (1934); Grandsons: A Story of American Lives (1935, novel); Cradle of Life: The Story of One Man's Beginnings (1936, novel); The House in Antigua (1937, travel); My America (1938); From Many Lands (1940); Two-Way Passage (1941); What's Your Name? (1942); My Native Land (1943); Nation of Nations (1945); and The Eagle and the Root (1950). Maxim Lieber was his literary agent, 1930‚Äì1931 and in 1946. In 1941, Adamic won the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for From Many Lands. Adamic was strongly opposed to the foreign policy followed by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and in 1946 wrote Dinner at the White House which purported to be an account of a dinner party given by President Franklin D. Roosevelt at which Adamic and Churchill had both been present. After the proofs had been passed by publishers Harper and Brothers, an additional footnote was inserted in pages 151 and 152 which claimed that Churchill had opposed the National Liberation Front in Greece because they intended to scale down the rate of interest Greece was paying to Hambros Bank. The footnote further claimed that Hambros had \\"bailed Winston Churchill out of bankruptcy in 1912\\". The footnote appeared in the book when it was published, and a copy was circulated to every British Member of Parliament; when Churchill was alerted, he instructed his solicitors to issue a writ for libel. Harper and Brothers admitted the statement was untrue and Adamic also withdrew the claim and apologised; a substantial sum of damages was paid,\\"Mr. Churchill gets damages and apology\\", The Manchester Guardian, 16 January 1947, p. 3. reported by the Daily Express as ¬£5,000.\\"Libel on Churchill ‚Äì damages ¬£5,000\\", Daily Express, 16 January 1947, p. 3. the copy of Dinner at the White House in the British Library is held in the 'Suppressed Safe' collection, inaccessible to readers. His support for the Tito regime led to him being targeted by Nevada Senator Pat McCarran, who between May and September, 1949, chaired a subcommittee to expose Soviet sympathizers among ethnic communities.John P. Enyeart, \\"Revolutionizing Cultural Pluralism: The Political Odyssey of Louis Adamic, 1932-1951\\", Journal of American Ethnic History, 34:3, (Spring 2015), pp. 58-90 Plagued by failing health, he is believed to have shot himself at his residence in Milford, New Jersey. He died at a time of political tension and intrigue in Yugoslavia, and there was press speculation in America that his death might have been an assassination by some Balkan faction, but no definitive proof of this theory has ever surfaced. According to John McAleer's Edgar Award-winning Rex Stout: A Biography (1977), it was the influence of Adamic that led Rex Stout to make his fictional detective Nero Wolfe a native of Montenegro, in what was then Yugoslavia.For more information see the origins section of the article on Nero Wolfe. Stout and Adamic were friends and frequent political allies, and Stout expressed uncertainty to McAleer about the circumstances of Adamic's death. In any case, the demise seems to have inspired Stout's 1954 novel The Black Mountain, in which Nero Wolfe returns to his homeland to hunt down the killers of an old friend.

It is named for Robert Crain of Baltimore. It is unique in Maryland in that it has a business route and a truck route which do not connect to their parent; however, the business route is also a part of the Robert Crain Highway. MD 3's current orientation is vestigial from the construction of Maryland's freeway system. Route description View south along MD 3 near MD 175 in Millersville MD 3 begins within the modified cloverleaf interchange of US 50 and unsigned I-595 (John Hanson Highway) and US 301 (Robert Crain Highway) in Bowie, Prince George's County. Within the interchange, US 301 heads south on Crain Highway and east along US 50; meanwhile, MD 3 heads north on Crain Highway, a four-lane divided highway. A short distance after beginning, the route comes to a partial cloverleaf interchange with Belair Drive, containing continuing connections from the US 50/US 301 interchange. Past here, the road runs north through wooded residential areas before the median widens and it bends to the north- northeast, continuing through forested areas with a few businesses. MD 3 continues northeast and the median narrows, with the road widening to eight lanes as it comes to an intersection with MD 450. At this point, MD 450 heads northeast for a concurrency with MD 3 along a six-lane divided highway, running through wooded areas and coming to a bridge over the Patuxent River. Upon crossing the Patuxent River, the road enters Anne Arundel County and continues northeast, with MD 450 splitting from MD 3 by turning to the east. MD 3 continues north along Crain Highway into Crofton, passing between woodland to the west and residential subdivisions to the east. The road heads into a commercial area and comes to an intersection with the northern terminus of MD 424. At this point, the route turns to the northeast and the median widens to include businesses in the center. MD 3 heads into Gambrills and runs through more commercial areas. The median narrows as the road passes to the southeast of the Waugh Chapel Towne Center and runs between businesses to the northwest and residential neighborhoods to the southeast. The median widens again and the route narrows to four lanes at the St. Stephen's Church Road intersection, passing through a mix of fields, woods, and businesses. The road comes to an intersection with the eastern terminus of MD 175 in Millersville before it heads northeast through woodland. MD 3 comes to its northern terminus at a modified cloverleaf interchange with I-97 and the eastern terminus of the MD 32 freeway. I-97 passes under MD 3 and occupies its median for a very short distance, with MD 3 ending at ramps merging into northbound I-97. The roadway of MD 3, however, continues for a minor distance longer, the southbound carriageway turning and crossing underneath I-97 to join with the northbound on the east side of the Interstate, and continuing north as Veterans Highway, running parallel to I-97 and providing access to MD 178. History MD 3 northbound past MD 424 in CroftonIn the past, Crain Highway originally held the designation MD 3, then US 301, and it currently carries both of these designations on different sections. Started in 1922, Crain Highway was a new road built by the Maryland State Road Commission and ran from Baltimore to Southern Maryland. The original route of MD 3, completed in 1927 on a greenfield alignment, was once designated Maryland Route 761. With the opening of the Harry W. Nice Bridge in 1940 it was joined with U.S. Route 301. After the Chesapeake Bay Bridge was built in 1952, US 301, which at that time ran along the current alignment of MD 3, was rerouted along US 50, across the Bay Bridge, and north to Wilmington, Delaware, as a bypass around the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. The former US 301 north of US 50 was then given back the MD 3 designation. After the construction of I-97, MD 3 was cut back to the I-97/MD 32 interchange, which led to the oddity of MD 3 Business in Glen Burnie being completely orphaned from its parent route. Despite this, the route is still designated MD 3 Business. If MD 3 existed as a continuous route between its original southern end near Cobb Island (now signed as MD 254 and MD 257) and its original northern end at US 1 (Wilkens Avenue) in southwestern Baltimore, running via US 301, Interstate 97, short segments of the Baltimore Beltway and the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, and Monroe Street in downtown Baltimore, it would be 74.69 miles long. MD 3 was routed via the Beltway and the Parkway to divert it from city streets; originally it followed what is now MD 648 (Baltimore-Annapolis Boulevard) into Baltimore, meeting Monroe Street within today's interchange between the Parkway and Interstate 95. The current alignment of the route was upgraded to a divided highway as US 301 in 1954. The route is severely congested; attempts to bypass it with new routings have failed. One such routing would have been Interstate 297, a direct freeway link between Interstate 97 and US 50/US 301/I-595. Junction listRelated routesMaryland Route 3 Business= View north along MD 3 Bus. in Glen Burnie Maryland Route 3 Business (MD 3 Bus.) is a business route of MD 3 through Glen Burnie and is the northernmost part of the Robert Crain Highway, connecting I-97 and MD 2. MD 3 Bus. begins on two-lane undivided New Cut Road at an arbitrary point just south of Grover Road in Severn, heading north-northeast through a mix of fields and residential neighborhoods and passing east of Archbishop Spalding High School. Past the Grover Road intersection, the route becomes a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane. MD 3 Bus. comes to an interchange with I-97 and becomes a four-lane divided highway, with the name changing to Crain Highway at the intersection with the northern terminus of Veterans Highway within the interchange. From here, the route widens to six lanes and continues through a largely commercial and residential area in Glen Burnie, curving to the north. The road passes under the MD 100 freeway without an interchange before narrowing to four lanes at the Oak Manor Drive intersection immediately after. MD 3 Bus. continues north through suburban areas, with the median transitioning to a center left-turn lane at the Madison Park Drive intersection. The road bends to the north-northeast and reaches a junction with the eastern terminus of MD 174. Following this, the route continues as a five lane road with a center left-turn lane that is lined with businesses, narrowing to a two-lane road at the 5th Avenue intersection. The road continues through residential and commercial areas, gaining a center turn lane again. At the Post 40 Road intersection, the Baltimore and Annapolis Trail crosses the route diagonally, forcing trail users to utilize two crosswalks. Immediately after, MD 3 Bus. intersects MD 648 in the downtown area of Glen Burnie. The route continues north-northeast through developed areas as a two- lane road, with MD 2 now running parallel to the route just one block to the east. Now with shoulders, MD 3 Bus. enters a heavy residential and commercial area for the remainder of its route. The route intersects the northern terminus of MD 270 before it makes a slight curve to the north. MD 3 Bus. continues north for a short distance before it reaches its northern terminus at an intersection with MD 2. MD 3 Bus. is the only business route in the Maryland state highway system that no longer connects with its parent route. This is due to the construction of a bypass freeway, which took over the MD 3 designation as it was built; MD 3 Bus. was designated for the present business route as it was constructed. However, the freeway was later designated as I-97, and MD 3's mainline was truncated to the point at which the freeway and MD 3 deviated onto different routes, south of MD 3 Bus. Despite this, several locations on I-97 have \\"TO MD 3\\" signs posted. Junction list =Maryland Route 3 Truck= Maryland Route 3 Truck is an unsigned designation given to Pratt Street eastbound and Lombard Street westbound in downtown Baltimore, running from MD 295 (Greene Street) east to President Street.Maryland State Highway Administration (2004), , 2004 The route exists despite not connecting to the current alignment of MD 3. As mentioned before, this is due to the construction of the freeways south of Baltimore taking the MD 3 designation, including MD 295. Before being given the current MD 295 designation, Paca Street and Greene Street were part of MD 3, which was the connection of MD 3 Truck to MD 3's mainline. =Auxiliary routes= *MD 3AA is an unnamed connector road that begins at Veterans Highway and travels to MD 3AB (Old Section MD 3) in Millersville, Anne Arundel County.

History A record of 1422 shows that the plays took place at the feast of Corpus Christi and this appears to have continued until 1521. Plays on Corpus Christi Day in 1475 included 'The trial and flagellation of Christ' and 'The Crucifixion'. The plays were then expanded into a three-day cycle on Whit Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. In the years between the plays there was the Chester Midsummer Watch Parade instead. The plays are based on biblical texts, from creation to the Last Judgement. They were enacted by common guildsmen and craftsmen on mounted stages that were moved around the city streets, with each company or guild performing one play. Prior to the event the Crier read out these banns: \\"The Aldermen and stewards of evrie societie and Companie draw youselves to your said severall companies according to Ancient Customme and soe to appear with your said severall Companies everie man as you are Called upon paine that shall fall thereon\\". Such early banns exhorted each company to perform well. Under Queen Elizabeth I the plays were seen as 'Popery' and banned by the English Church. Despite this, a play cycle was performed in 1568 and the cathedral paid for the stage and beer as in 1562. They were performed in 1572 despite a protest by an Evangelical minister. They were performed again, over four days, in 1575. This resulted in the mayor, when he retired from his office, being taken to the Star Chamber in London to answer allegations against him, but with the support of the council (or assembly) he was freed. One edition of the plays begins with \\"The Banes which are reade beefore the beginninge of the playes of Chester, 4 June 1600\\". Each play ends with \\"Finis. Deo gracias! per me Georgi Bellin. 1592\\". . Images: title page, start of the Banes and end of the first play. Original composition of the plays is disputed; a date as early as the mid 14th century has been suggested.

This view is from the city walls and the raked seating area is on the right. The plays were revived in Chester in 1951 as part of the Festival of Britain and are presented there every five years.Chester Mystery Plays website The 2018 run of plays was from 27 June to 14 July. The Players of St Peter have been performing the plays in London roughly every five years since 1946.The Players of St Peter Under the direction of Jeff Dailey, the American Theatre of Actors in New York City performed the penultimate play, The Coming of Antichrist, in August 2017.American Theatre of Actors Adaptations In the twentieth century, the Noah's Flood play was set operatically by both Benjamin Britten (Noye's Fludde) and Igor Stravinsky (The Flood). The Mysteries is an adaption by the poet Tony Harrison, principally based upon the Wakefield Cycle, but incorporating scenes from the York, Chester and N-Town canons, first performed in 1977 at the National Theatre, and again revived in 2000 as a celebration of the millennium.

It refers to a plan drawn up by the Pakistan Army, in May 1965, to attack the vital Akhnoor Bridge in Jammu and Kashmir. The bridge was not only the lifeline of an entire infantry division in Jammu and Kashmir, but could also be used to threaten Jammu, an important logistical point for Indian forces. The operation ended in a failure for the Pakistan Army as the stated military objectives were not achieved and they subsequently were forced to retreat following a counterattack by the Indian Army. Background Following the Rann of Kutch affair, which resulted in territorial gains for Pakistan following a boundary award later in 1968, the political atmosphere in Pakistan was jubilant. Believing the Indians were badly demoralised and the Muslims of Jammu and Kashmir would revolt against them with a little help, General Ayub Khan gave his approval for Operation Gibraltar, a plan to provoke uprisings in Jammu and Kashmir by infiltrating teams of military personnel to conduct sabotage and prod the Kashmiri people against Indian forces. The infiltration started in the first week of August 1965, as Pakistani infantry infiltrated the border in teams of twos and threes, eventually swelling to more than 4000‚Äì5000 in number. Identifying the insurgents as Pakistan Army regulars, India countered them by bringing in additional troops. The Indian Army also launched attacks on the logistical bases of the insurgents in Pakistan- administered Kashmir. The Pakistani Army commenced Operation Grand Slam at 0500 hours on 1 September 1965. The aim was to ease the pressure on the 12th Division, which was defending against repeated Indian attacks, and to guard against the threat to the city of Muzaffarabad from the gain by Indian forces of strategic areas such as Hajipir pass in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Execution The Akhnoor sector was lightly defended by four Indian infantry battalions and a squadron of tanks. The infantry was stretched thin along the border and the AMX-13 tanks were no match for the Pakistani M47 Patton and M48 Patton tanks. Against a militarily stronger and larger Pakistani thrust, the Indian forces retreated from their defensive positions. According to Pakistani military historian Major (retd.) A. H. Amin, the Pakistani forces in Operation Grandslam had a 6 to 1 advantage over Indian AMX-13 tanks, which were like 'matchboxes' in front of the Pakistani Pattons. In terms of artillery, Pakistan's 8 inch guns were superior to anything that Indians had at that time and had an overall superiority of 6 to 1. On the second day of the attack, the GOC of the 12th Infantry Division Major General Akhtar Hussain Malik, commanding the overall forces in the area, was replaced by Major General Yahya Khan, the GOC of the 7th Infantry Division, which delayed the attack by one day. Not only did this decision cause confusion among the Pakistani officer cadre, the delay also permitted the Indians to rush reinforcements to the sector. When the attack recommenced on 3 September, the Indian forces in the sector were sufficiently reinforced to hold out for a few more days, but they did not have the strength to launch a counterattack. As the attack carried on for two more days without any significant gains in territory, the Indian Army opened up a new front, on 6 September, across the sensitive state of Punjab in Pakistan. The advance of the Indian Army also threatened to cut across the right flank of the Pakistani attack. Realising the gravity of the threat, the Pakistani Army stopped its thrust into Kashmir and diverted forces to counter the Indian incursion.

It has an apparent visual magnitude of 5.5, which is bright enough to be seen with the naked eye outside of urban areas. 18 Scorpii has some physical properties in common with the Sun, a G-type star. Cayrel de Strobel (1996) included it in her review of the stars most similar to the Sun, and Porto de Mello & da Silva (1997) identified it as a younger solar twin.ESO, The life cycle of a Sun-like star (annotated), from European Southern Observatory, 28 August 2013 Some scientists therefore believe the prospects for life in its vicinity are good. One candidate planet has been discovered orbiting this star.  Characteristics  18 scorpii is on the northern boundary of the constellation. Its high proper motion positions it in Ophiuchus before 1700. 18 Scorpii is a main sequence star of spectral and luminosity type G2 Va, with the luminosity class of 'V' indicating it is generating energy through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in its core region. Sousa et al. (2008) found its metallicity to be about 1.1 times that of the Sun, which means the abundance of elements other than hydrogen or helium is 10% greater. The radius of this star, as measured using interferometry by Bazot et al. (2011), is 101% the radius of the Sun. When combined with the results of asteroseismology measurements, this allows the mass of the star to be estimated as 102% of the Sun's mass. This star is radiating 106% of the Sun's luminosity from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 5,433 K. It is this heat that gives the star the yellow-hued glow of a G-type star. According to Lockwood (2002), it has a temporal photometric behavior very similar to the Sun. Its brightness variation over its entire activity cycle is 0.09%, about the same as the Sun's brightness variations during recent solar cycles. Using the technique of Zeeman-Doppler imaging, Petit et al. (2008) have detected its surface magnetic field, showing that its intensity and geometry are very similar to the large-scale solar magnetic field. The estimated period for the activity cycle of 18 Scorpii is about seven years, which is significantly shorter than the Sun's, and its overall chromospheric activity level is noticeably higher. Like the Sun, it has a hot corona with a temperature in the range of 1.5‚Äì2 MK and an X-ray luminosity of . Though 18 Scorpii is only slightly more metal-rich overall than the Sun, its lithium abundance is about three times as high; for this reason, Mel√©ndez & Ram√≠rez (2007) have suggested that 18 Scorpii be called a \\"quasi solar twin\\", reserving the term solar twin for stars (such as HIP 56948) that match the Sun, within the observational errors, for all parameters. 18 Scorpii is a young star at 2.9 Gyr (2.9 Billion years old). 18 Scorpii has not yet entered its stable burning stage. The Sun at 4.7 Gyr is at its most stable stage. Due to 18 Scorpii age, it is at the edge of range for a solar twin, and is more of a Solar analog. 18 Scorpii was thought to be 5.0 billion years old in the past, new measurements in 2013 found 18 Scorpii to be younger at 2.9 billion years old.NASA NEWS, Identification of oldest solar twin may help locate rocky exoplanets, August 29, 2013 18 Scorpii was identified in September 2003 by astrobiologist Margaret Turnbull from the University of Arizona in Tucson as one of the most promising nearby candidates for hosting life, based on her analysis of the HabCat list of stars. This is a solitary star, and does not display the level of excess infrared emission that would otherwise suggest the presence of unconsolidated circumstellar matter, such as a debris disk. In a paper published in April 2017, a candidate planet was found orbiting 18 Scorpii (HD 146233) with a period of .

It overlooks the Scottish town of Dumbarton, and sits on a plug of volcanic basalt known as Dumbarton Rock which is high. History According to the local museum, Dumbarton Rock is a volcanic plug of basalt created 334 million years ago, with the softer exterior of the volcano having weathered away. =Iron Age= At least as far back as the Iron Age, this has been the site of a strategically important settlement as evidenced by archaeological finds. The people that came to reside there in the era of Roman Britain were known to have traded with the Romans - though these may or may not have been the Picts that dwelled in Dumbarton in the Bronze Age & early-mid Iron Age. However the first written record about a settlement there was marked in a letter Saint Patrick wrote to King Ceretic of Alt Clut in the late 5th century. =Early Medieval Era= David Nash Ford has proposed that Dumbarton was the Cair Brithon (\\"Fort of the Britons\\") listed by Nennius among the 28 cities of Sub-Roman Britain.Ford, David Nash. \\"[www.britannia.com/history/ebk/articles/nenniuscities.html The 28 Cities of Britain]\\" at Britannia. 2000. From the fifth century until the ninth, the castle was the centre of the independent Brythonic Kingdom of Strathclyde. Alt Clut or Alcluith (, , \\"Rock of the Clyde\\"), the Brythonic name for Dumbarton Rock, became a metonym for kingdom. The king of Dumbarton in about AD 570 was Riderch Hael, who features in Welsh and Latin works. During his reign Merlin was said to have stayed at Alt Clut. The medieval Scalacronica of Sir Thomas Grey records the legend that \\"Arthur left Ho√´l of Brittany his nephew sick at Alcluit in Scotland.\\"Leland, John, Collectanea, vol.1 part 2 (1770), p.510. John Leland's note of the Scalachronica: Sir Thomas Grey of Heton, Scalachronica, Edinburgh, (1836), p.318, French: \\"et lessa Hoel son neuew de la Peteit Bretaigne a Alclud en Escoz maladez.\\" Ho√´l made a full recovery, but was besieged in the castle by the Scots and Picts. The story first appeared in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae.Schultz Albert, ed., Historia Regum Britanniae (1854), pp.125-6 Amongst lists of three things, in the triads of the Red Book of Hergest, the third \\"Unrestrained Ravaging\\" was Aeddan Fradog (the Wily, perhaps √Åed√°n mac Gabr√°in), coming to the court of Rhydderch the Generous at Alclud, who left neither food nor drink nor beast alive. This battle also appears in stories of Myrddin Wyllt, the Merlin of Geoffrey of Monmouth's Vita Merlini, perhaps conflated with the battle of Arfderydd, located as Arthuret by some authors.Ritson, J., Annals of the Caledonians, Picts, and Scots; and of Strathclyde, Cumberland, Galloway and Murray, (1828), pp.164-5, quoting Humphrey Llwyd In 756, the first (and second) losses of Dumbarton Rock were recorded. A joint force of Picts and Northumbrians captured the fortress after a siege, only to lose it again a few days later. By 870, it was home to a tightly packed British settlement, which served as a fortress and as the capital of Alt Clut. In 871, the Irish-based Viking kings Amla√≠b and √çmar laid siege to Dumbarton Rock. The fortress fell in four months, after its water supply failed. The kings are recorded to have returned to Ireland with 200 ships and a host of British, English, and Pictish captives. These prisoners may have included the ruling family of Alt Clut including the king Arthgal ap Dyfnwal, who was slain the following year under uncertain circumstances. Following the Viking destruction of the fortress, Dumbarton Rock does not appear on record again until the 13th century, and the capital of the restructured Kingdom of Strathclyde appears to have relocated up the Clyde to the vicinity of Partick and Govan. =Medieval Era= Dumbarton castle in 1800Stoddart, John (1800), Remarks on Local Scenery and Manners in Scotland. Pub. Wiliam Miller, London. Facing P. 212. In medieval Scotland, Dumbarton (D√πn Breatainn, which means \\"the fortress of the Britons\\") was an important royal castle. It sheltered David II and his young wife, Joan of The Tower after the Scottish defeat at Halidon Hill in 1333. In 1425 the castle was attacked by James the Fat, youngest son of Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany, who had been imprisoned by King James I of Scotland on charges of treason. James the Fat became a rallying point for enemies of the King, and raised a rebellion against the crown. He marched on the town of Dumbarton and burned it, but was unable to take the castle, whose defender John Colquhoun successfully held out against James' men.McAndrew, Bruce A., p.5, Scotland's Historic Heraldry Retrieved November 2010Campbell, Alastair, p. 113, A History of Clan Campbell, Volume 2 Retrieved November 2010 =James IV and Dumbarton= The former supporters of James III under the leadership of John Stewart, 1st Earl of Lennox met up at Dumbarton Castle in October 1489. They had hoped to gain the support of Henry VII of England. James IV defeated them in a battle between the Touch and Menteith hills near Stirling on 11 and 12 October.N. MacDougall, James IV, (Tuckwell, East Linton, 1997), 172-3 James IV used Dumbarton as the west coast base for his navy and campaigns to subdue the Western Isles. James was at Dumbarton with the Chancellor of Scotland, Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll, in November 1489. He had the use of a ship belonging to the Laird of Luss. In the following February a royal ship was 'chaysit' by the English and lost some of her cables. In 1494 a row barge was built at Dumbarton for the king using timber from Loch Lomond. In March 1495 James IV was provided with a camp bed for use at sea and a boat carried cannon to Dumbarton. Patrick Hepburn, 1st Earl of Bothwell, was made Captain of the castle on 1 April 1495. A man played on the clarschaw, a Gaelic harp, for the King. In 1505 Dumbarton was the King's base for visiting the Western Isles. One ship's mast was made from timber from Drymen. On 5 June James was entertained by a French 'quhissilar', perhaps playing a recorder and on 8 June James played cards with John Murray and Master Robert Cockburn losing ¬£4-10 shillings, and later that day attended Evensong in the Parish kirk and College of Dumbarton. In 1505 John Ramsay built a ship for the King called the Columb, ( Saint Columba being the father of Christianity in Scotland ). In December 1505 a sword that had belonged to William Wallace was repaired.John Irving, Dumbarton Castle: its Place in the General History of Scotland (Bennett & Thomson Dumbarton 1917), pp. 21-24, quoting the Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland. =Regent Albany, James V and the circumnavigation of Scotland= On 18 May 1515 the James or the Margaret with six other ships brought John Stewart, Regent Albany to Dumbarton. These royal ships were repaired at Dumbarton in July and new docks were made for them. John Drummond of Milnab brought fourteen of their guns to Glasgow.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh 1903), pp. xxxii-xxxiii In September Regent Albany held court at Dumbarton, and received Thomas Benolt, the English Clarenceux King of Arms. The Carrick Herald and Clarenceux were sent to Lord Maxwell.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh 1903), pp. 223-4 In March 1516 Albany issued six letters of remission (forgiveness) to those who had held the castle for Lennox against the king in 1489.Register of the Privy Seal, vol. 1 (Edinburgh 1908) pp.419-420 Regent Albany returned to France from Dumbarton in 1524.J. Irving, Dumbarton Castle, (1917), 29 In 1526 John Stewart, 3rd Earl of Lennox fortified Dumbarton against the Douglas faction who had control of the young James V, but his forces were defeated by Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus at the battle of Linlithgow Bridge. James Hamilton of Finnart, who was implicated in the death of the Earl of Lennox, was given custody of the castle till 1531.J. Irving, Dumbarton Castle, (1917), pp. 29-30 Later in his personal reign James V used the castle as a prison for those convicted at the justice ayre, receiving their fines and composition payments in 1539.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 7 (Edinburgh), p. 282 In 1540 James circumnavigated Scotland from the Forth and arrived at Dumbarton with Cardinal Beaton, the Earl of Huntly, and the Earl of Arran each leading a force of five hundred men. This expedition was later published by Nicolas de Nicolay Seigneur d'Arfeville, cosmographer to the King of France in 1583, with the first modern map of Scotland's coastline.J. Irving, Dumbarton Castle, (1917), p. 30:  Nicolas D'Arfeville's map at the National Library of Scotland =Lennox and Mary, Queen of Scots= Matthew, Earl of Lennox had been an ally of the French party in Scotland led by Mary of Guise but committed himself to the pro-English faction. In 1544 munitions and ten thousand French crowns of the sun arrived with Jacques de la Brosse at Dumbarton's harbour and were secured by Lennox and the Earl of Glencairn. Lennox then went into England, leaving the castle in the keeping of William Stirling of Glorat. Lennox signed a deal with Henry VIII of England offering Dumbarton Castle and the Isle of Bute in return for land in England and marriage to Henry's niece Margaret Douglas, and the future Governorship of Scotland if circumstances permitted. Lennox undertook to prevent the infant queen Mary being taken from Scotland. However, George Stirling of Glorat, unhappy at this policy, prevented Lennox returning into the castle and he was forced to sail to Ireland. George Stirling declared that he would hold the castle in the name of the young queen only. The Privy Council of Scotland agreed to George Stirling's plan. Despite this, more French troops landed at Dumbarton under the leadership of Lorges Montgomery, the soldier who later killed Henry II of France at a joust in 1559.J. Irving, Dumbarton Castle (1917), pp. 31-34. In May 1545 Lennox tried to take the castle, with soldiers commanded by his brother, Robert Stewart, Bishop of Caithness. He had sailed from Chester with around 20 followers in May 1546 in the Katherine Goodman and a pinnace.Dasent, ed., Acts of the Privy Council, 1542-1547, vol. 1 (London, 1890), p. 379 Regent Arran besieged the castle with a superior force, having borrowed the artillery of the Earl of Argyle. George Stirling of Glorat surrendered after 20 days and made terms. The chronicle historian John Lesley wrote that the Captain and the Bishop surrendered the castle to Arran and were rewarded, after negotiation by the Earl of Huntly.Thomson, Thomas, ed., John Lesley's History of Scotland (Bannatyne Club, 1830), 190. The siege at Dumbarton delayed Arran's action at the siege of St Andrews Castle on the East coast of Scotland.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 8 (Edinburgh, 1908), lxxx, 453, 465: Letters & Papers Henry VIII, vol .21 part 2 (London, 1910) no. 6, Arran to the Pope. Thereafter the castle was in the hands of Regent Arran and he held court in person there in July giving legal remission to the keeper of the Castle and in March 1547 acknowledging the good service of George Stirling of Glorat in rendering the castle to him.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol.1 (Edinburgh 1877), pp. 34-5, 66-7. As the war of the Rough Wooing continued, Mary, Queen of Scots was lodged in the castle by 22 February 1548. Alexander Cunningham, 5th Earl of Glencairn wrote to Mary of Guise from Dumbarton that he had received a French cargo, and it would be as safe as if it were in Stirling Castle.Annie Cameron, Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine (SHS: Edinburgh, 1927), pp. 36-7. The English commander Grey of Wilton proposed basing warships at Lamlash on Arran as a convenient base to watch for French ships coming for Mary.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1547-1563, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 586 Mary of Guise was at the castle in the first days of May 1548 and Mary, Queen of Scots was kept at the castle for several months before her embarkation for France for safety on 13 July 1548. The sailing however was delayed by adverse winds till 7 August 1548. Her party including the Four Marys left the Clyde in a fleet under the command of Nicolas de Villegagnon. They sailed around the west coast of Ireland, to avoid English ships commanded by Edward Clinton.J. Irving, Dumbarton Castle (1917), pp. 37-38. In France she was soon betrothed to the young dauphin Francis. Seven years after the end of the war of the Rough Wooing, in 1557, five hundred Gascon soldiers arrived at Dumbarton destined to serve on the borders against the English for Mary of Guise according to a rumour heard by Gilbert Kennedy, 3rd Earl of Cassilis.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh 1913) lxiii-xliv =Marian Civil War, Regent Morton, and the Duke of Lennox= After the defeat at the battle of Langside John Fleming, 5th Lord Fleming, keeper of the Castle went with Queen Mary into England but was allowed to return. When William Kirkcaldy of Grange governor of Edinburgh Castle changed to support Mary, this became a problem for Regent Moray. The first siege was lifted because of the assassination of Regent Moray. The assassin James Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh was welcomed at the castle. Fleming's defence of Dumbarton for Mary was satirized in a ballad printed by Robert Lekprevik in May 1570; The tressoun of Dumbertane.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 3, (1903), 177: The tressoun of Dumbarton, 15 May, Robert Lekprevik, Edinburgh, 1570. Attributed to Robert Sempill, the ballad describes Fleming's failed ambush of Sir William Drury in May 1570.Cranstoun, James, Satirical Poems of the Reformation, vol. 1 (1892) 170-173, & notes vol. 2 (1893), 113-7. In October 1570 during the Marian civil war the castle was fortified for Mary against the supporters of James VI of Scotland with stones obtained by demolishing churches and houses in Dumbarton and Cardross.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 3, (1903), 383. The castle was captured by the forces of Regent Lennox led by Thomas Crawford of Jordanhill and John Cunningham of Drumquhassle in the early hours of 2 April 1571, who used ladders to scale the rock and surprise the garrison. Dumbarton Castle was used as prison for Regent Morton in June 1581 before his execution in Edinburgh. On 8 September 1582 the castle was put unto the keeping of Walter Stewart of Taberstoun an ally of Esm√© Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox, the King's favourite. The Duke of Lennox was displaced by the Gowrie Regime and went to the castle in secret pretending to be travelling from Edinburgh to nearby Dalkeith Palace. Lennox had his own ship there described as a barque. Robert Bowes, the English resident agent, expected the Duke of Lennox would sail to France from Dumbarton \\"having well victualled his shippe there.\\" Other observers were anxious that the castle might become a foothold for French forces in Scotland allied to Lennox and his faction. In December 1582 two Englishmen in Lennox's service at Dumbarton left by his ship from Largs. Lennox himself travelled to France through England, never to return.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 6 (Edinburgh 1910), pp. 161, 168, 309: J. Irving, Dumbarton Castle, vol.1, (1917), 59-60: Bowes Correspondence, (London 1842), pp. 182, 188, 298-300 =Seventeenth century= Although few buildings remain from this period there are records of works in 1617, 1618, and 1628-9. A replacement Wallace Tower was built superseding the medieval building. In June 1618 masons were working on the upper storey and it was decided to make the tower larger. Externally it was finished with lime plaster called harling. At the south side there was a bell house. By 1627 it was discovered that the keeper Sir John Stewart of Methven had neglected the fortress. He was replaced by Sir John Stewart of Traquair who recorded the poor state of the building. Surviving accounts mostly record work on the artillery and the 'foir yet wall' a defence on the southern side. The Scottish Parliament in 1644 judged that the castle was likely to more hurtful than useful to the country.J. Dunbar, ed, Accounts of the Masters of Works, vol.2 (HMSO Edinburgh 1982), pp. xciv xcvii In November 1645 the Committee of Estates approved the recruitment of thirty extra soldiers by the keeper John Semple to guard the increased number of prisoners.D. Stevenson,Government of Scotland under the Covenanters, (SHS Edinburgh, 1982)34-5 The castle's strategic importance declined after Oliver Cromwell's death in 1658. However, due to threats posed by Jacobites and the French in the eighteenth century, new structures and defences were built and the castle was garrisoned until World War II. Some documentation for these later works is preserved in the National Archives of Scotland. =Inventories= Several lists of the castle's contents survive, including inventories from 1510, 1571, 1580, 1644, and 1668. These list guns and furniture and name many locations in the castle.J. Irving, Dumbarton Castle, (Dumbarton 1917), pp.99-108: Thomas Thomson, ed., A Collection of Inventories, (Edinburgh 1815), pp.299-302: Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 3 (Edinburgh 1880), pp.319-320 There is also a list of cannon transported by John Drummond of Milnab to Dumbarton in 1536.J. MacPhail ed., Papers from the Collection of William Fraser, (SHS, Edinburgh 1924), pp. 221-2 In 1510 St Patricks chapel contained an old parchment mass book, a pewter chalice, and liturgical cloths. The hall had four tables and next to that was a chalmer of Dess, a 'solar' in English terms with a bed. The Wallace tower was protected with an iron yett and draw bar, there were bedchambers within and a bell at the head of the tower; the 'Wynde Hall' contained another bed.J. Irving, Dumbarton Castle, (Dumbarton 1917), pp. 99-100 In August 1536 George Stirling of Glorat took delivery from John Drummond the king's Master Wright of four great guns and six falcons on carriages with wheels, thirty three bronze hagbut hand-guns and four iron culverins, with ammunition and powder and ramrods for the big guns. John Drummond took away an old brass gun that was long. In 1571 amonngst the cannon and guns there was a \\"gross culverin\\", two small \\"batteris\\", and a French \\"moyen\\" mounted for use on the walls. Another moyen was suitable for action in the field. There were two Brittany-made falcons on the walls, a quarter falcon and a \\"double barse\\". Provisions included eleven hogshead of biscuit. Some of the guns were subsequently taken to besiege Edinburgh Castle during the Marian civil war.J. Irving, Dumbarton Castle, (Dumbarton 1917), pp. 100-101 The document compiled in 1580 was \\"the inventar of the munitioun and uther insicht geir underwrittin left in the castell of Dumbertane be Johnne Conninghame of Drumquhassill and deliverit be the said Johnne to William Stewart of Cabirston in name and behalf of ane noble and potent lord Esme erll of Lennox lord Darnley and Obeigny on the 27 August 1580\\". There were six large cannon. The bed in the chamber of dais was now described as 'ane stand bed of eistland tymmar with ruf and pannell of the same', a bed made from imported Baltic oak.Thomas Thomson, ed., A Collection of Inventories, (Edinburgh 1815), p.299 By 1644, when John Sempill was made keeper the 'Chamber of deisse' still contained a bed with a chamber pot and truckle bed for a servant, but it also contained armaments. There were twelve ram-rods, and three worms' - screws for unloading guns, three hagbuts and an iron flail. The hall contained twelve broken pikes, four without their iron blades. The contents of the armoury included thirty-three corslets, 105 helmets, and 43 swords.J. Irving, Dumbarton Castle, (Dumbarton 1917), pp. 104 citing NLS Adv. Mss, Dennistoun In 1668 the Governor Francis Montgomerie of Giffin recorded that the first floor of a lodging called the 'new chamber' contained 'a quantity of old rusty guns and sword, so rusted broke and spoiled that they can never serve for any use, above the beds were 'insufficient' and in the top room there was spoiled matches. The windows of this new lodging were broken. Montgomerie was worried about the water-supply from the loch and the 'laigh' low well.J.

Not much survives from the medieval castle: the 14th-century Portcullis Arch, the foundations of the Wallace Tower, and what may be the foundations of the White Tower. There is a 16th-century guard house, which includes a face which according to legend is \\"Fause Menteith\\", who betrayed William Wallace. Most of the existing structures were built in the 18th century, including the Governor's House, built for John Kennedy, 8th Earl of Cassilis, and fortifications which demonstrated the struggle by military engineers to adapt an intractable site to contemporary defensive needs. The splendid views from the twin summits of the White Tower Crag and the Beak remind us why this rocky outcrop was chosen as 'the fortress of the Britons' centuries ago.\\"Historic Scotland Official Souvenir Guide\\" The castle is open on a daily basis during the summer season and Saturday-Wednesday in the winter. Visitors must climb the 557 steps to see the White Tower Crag and other features. Dumbarton Rock is in state ownership and is legally protected by the Scottish Government as a Scheduled Ancient Monument, to conserve it for future generations. Activities such as rock climbing are forbidden; any change or damage caused is considered a criminal offence.

A very similar version was found in Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) and was inherited into OpenBSD and probably Solaris. On most modern Unix-like systems, even BSD-derived ones like FreeBSD and NetBSD, the diff3 provided is GNU's version in diffutils (formerly GNU Tools). This version has the ability to merge files on its own without relying on .

Merging from a common ancestor When two people have made changes to copies of the same file, diff3 can produce a merged output that contains both sets of changes together with warnings about conflicts. diff3 can merge three or more sets of changes to a file by merging two change sets at a time. diff3 can incorporate changes from two modified versions into a common preceding version. This enables users to merge the sets of changes represented by the two newer files. This can be enabled using a command like this: \`diff3 mine older yours\`. This is like subtracting the file \`older\` from the file \`yours\` and adding the result to the file \`mine\`, or as merging into \`mine\` the changes that would turn \`older\` into \`yours\`. This merging is well-defined as long as \`mine\` and \`older\` match in the neighborhood of each such change. This fails to be true when all three input files differ or when only \`older\` differs; this is a conflict. When all three input files differ, the conflict is an overlap. diff3 has several methods to handle overlaps and conflicts. It can omit overlaps or conflicts, or select only overlaps, or mark conflicts with special \`<<<<<<<\` and \`>>>>>>>\` lines. diff3 can output the merge results as an ed script that can be applied to the first file to yield the merged output.

The channel is owned by Bell Media, with the MTV2 name and branding used under an agreement with the ViacomCBS Networks Americas division of ViacomCBS. History MTV Canada logo used from 2001 to 2002. On November 24, 2000, the Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) announced the licensees of the new, much-sought after, Category 1 digital services. Craig Media, in partnership with TD Capital Group Ltd, was granted a licence for a youth- oriented service known as \\"Connect\\", which would be catered to teens and young adults (but primarily the former) with programming such as \\"informal education, human interest, sitcoms, animation, and video clips\\".CRTC Decision 2000-462 Due to genre protection rules forbidding digital channels from unduly competing with existing analog services (in particular, MuchMusic), the channel was forbidden from devoting more than 10% of its weekly schedule to music videos. Nonetheless, in August 2001, Craig Media announced that it had reached an agreement with MTV Networks to license programming and the MTV brand in Canada for the channel,TV Land, MTV and Craig Broadcast Systems to Launch New Canadian Services in September; PR Newswire; 2001-08-21 prompting a pre-launch name change to MTV Canada. Prior to the channel's launch, Craig purchased TD Capital Group's interest in the channel. The channel launched as MTV Canada on October 18, 2001.Channel Introduction: MTV Canada Channel Canada 2002-06-30 Shortly afterward, Craig sold a minority interest in the service to MTV Networks. MTV Canada aired a mix of Canadian-produced programs (including Pepsi Breakout and MTV Select), as well as shows from the American MTV channel (such as TRL and The Real World). MTV Canada logo used from 2002 to 2005. The new channel faced a formal complaint to the CRTC from Much's owner CHUM Limited, who argued that it devoted at least 60% of its programming to music videos, in violation of its license. CHUM also accused Craig of using its promise of a teen lifestyle network as a backdoor to gain approval for a channel that would, ultimately, encroach on MuchMusic's protected format instead. Craig disputed the allegations, noting that music was an aspect of youth culture, and accusing CHUM of misrepresenting any programming \\"that has some connection to the general topic of music or music videos\\" as counting as \\"music video clips\\". The CRTC program categories distinguish between music videos and music-related programming that did not involve music videos, but the commission ruled that music videos contained within music-related programming such as MTV Select and Making the Video contributed towards the program category, and put MTV Canada over the 10% limit. The commission also displayed concern for the channel's predominant focus on music programming, as it was at odds with its commitment to deliver a broadly teen-based service as licensed. The CRTC also noted Craig's malicious compliance on its promise to devote 15% of its schedule to \\"informal education/recreation & leisure\\" programming, which consisted of recreational extreme sports programming aired primarily during overnight timeslots with low viewership, and did not include programming produced by \\"independent educational authorities\\" as promised. The CRTC thus ordered Craig Media to address these shortcomings. =2005‚Äìpresent= Razer logo used from 2005 to 2008. CHUM's disputes over the channel were soon rendered moot when it ultimately acquired Craig Media in 2004, primarily to gain control of its A-Channel television stations in western Canada. However, per a clause in the licensing agreement, Viacom exercised its right to pull out of the venture upon the change in ownership. On June 9, 2005, CHUM announced it would rebrand the channel as Razer, a change that took effect on June 30 of that year. The new channel was built on interactivity, allowing its audience to \\"program, host and contribute to elements to the service and make it their own\\". In addition to the new programming slate, Razer debuted RazerTXT, a new programming block where viewers could play a selection of SMS games while watching the shows. Razer would later debut Kamikaze, the branding and programming block used for various anime titles as well as shows such as Happy Tree Friends. Meanwhile, Bell Globemedia (later CTVglobemedia) struck a licensing agreement with MTV Networks to launch its own MTV channel (previously known as talktv) in early 2006.MTV Returns to Canada Bell Globemedia press release 2005-09-28 In July 2006, Bell Globemedia announced that it would purchase CHUM for an estimated CAD$1.7 billion, including its interest in Razer.Bell Globemedia acquires CHUM ; Fasken Martineau; 2006-07-12 The sale was approved by the CRTC on June 8, 2007,Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2007-165; CRTC; 2007-06-08 with the transaction completed on June 22. On August 1, 2008, Razer was relaunched as MTV2.MTV2 to Launch in Canada Mediacaster Magazine 2008-07-17 Unlike the original channel (now known as Juicebox), with the vast majority of its programming consisting of music videos, the new channel became much closer in format to its U.S. counterpart. Because of their respective licences, it can air music videos and music programming unlike the current main MTV channel in Canada. Ownership changed hands again when on September 10, 2010, BCE (a minority shareholder in CTVglobemedia) announced that it planned to acquire 100% interest in CTVglobemedia for a total debt and equity transaction cost of CAD$3.2 billion. The deal was approved by the CRTC on March 7, 2011CRTC approves BCE's purchase of CTVglobemedia and was finalized on April 1 of that year, when CTVglobemedia was rebranded as Bell Media.Bell completes acquisition of CTV, launches Bell Media business unit CNW 2011-04-01 Programming Presently, MTV2 airs a mix of comedies, documentaries, reality shows, and dramas. As of 2015, the channel doesn't air any of the original programs of its American counterpart, although some of its acquired shows have aired in syndication on MTV2 in the U.S or were produced by its sister channel, MTV, both domestically and internationally.

The title suggests a word play on the Christmas carol The Little Drummer Boy. The story follows the manipulations of Martin Kurtz, an Israeli spymaster who intends to kill Khalil ‚Äì a Palestinian terrorist who is bombing Jewish-related targets in Europe, particularly Germany ‚Äì and Charlie, an English actress and double agent working on behalf of the Israelis. Plot summary Martin Kurtz, an Israeli spy working in a clandestine agency to allow plausible deniability for his superiors, recruits Charlie, a 26 year-old radical left-wing English actress, as part of an elaborate scheme to discover the whereabouts of Khalil, a Palestinian terrorist. Joseph is Charlie's case officer. Khalil's younger brother Salim is abducted, interrogated, and killed by Kurtz's unit. Joseph impersonates Salim and travels through Europe with Charlie to make Khalil believe that Charlie and Salim are lovers. When Khalil discovers the affair and contacts Charlie, the Israelis are able to track him down. Charlie is taken to Palestinian refugee camps to be trained as a bomber. She becomes more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, and her divided loyalties bring her close to collapse. Charlie is sent on a mission to place a bomb at a lecture given by an Israeli moderate whose peace proposals are not to Khalil's liking. She carries out the mission under the Israelis' supervision. As a result, Joseph kills Khalil. Charlie subsequently has a mental breakdown caused by the strain of her mission and her own internal contradictions. AdaptationsFilm= The Little Drummer Girl was made into a feature film by George Roy Hill in 1984. It starred Diane Keaton as Charlie, Yorgo Voyagis as Joseph and Klaus Kinski as Kurtz. The film changes Charlie from an English twentysomething to a thirty-ish American. The film was released on DVD in 2006. =Television= A BBC/AMC miniseries adaptation was directed by Park Chan-wook, starring Florence Pugh, Alexander Skarsg√•rd, and Michael Shannon. It also stars Clare Holman, Kate Sumpter, Charles Dance, Simona Brown, Michael Moshonov, Amir Khoury, and Max Irons; the series debuted in November 2018. Reviews Some reviewers described The Little Drummer Girl as transcending the spy novel genre.See e.g. A. Broyard, The New York Times book review \\"The Little Drummer Girl is about spies\\", said William F. Buckley, writing in The New York Times, \\"as Madame Bovary is about adultery or Crime and Punishment about crime.\\" John Grisham, when queried by Bill Moyers, picked The Little Drummer Girl as one of his favourite novels, saying, > I love to read John le Carr√©, the British guy who's really probably my > favourite writer. The Little Drummer Girl is a book I read about every four > or five years. It's just so clever and brilliantly plotted. It's the kinda > book ‚Äì and his writing is off the charts, the way he expresses himself and > the way he describes people and dialogue ‚Äì and every time I read that book, > it inspires me to be better.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 16, 2003, and was seen by around 22 million people during this broadcast. The episode is referred to as the 301st in the opening theme as it originally aired the same day as the episode \\"Barting Over\\", which was promoted as the 300th episode. Plot While watching a horror movie show hosted by Boobarella (the show's take on Cassandra Peterson's Elvira character), a commercial plays for the Ribwich (the show's take on McDonald's McRib sandwich), a new Krusty Burger sandwich in which meat from an unknown animal is processed and molded into the shape of ribs. Homer excitedly samples the Ribwich, recently arrived at the Krusty Burger in Springfield, and becomes addicted. The next day, Principal Skinner holds a spelling bee at the school. Lisa is excited when she wins the spelling bee, for which she is awarded a scale model of the planet Mars (a kickball with the word \\"Mars\\" written on it). She continues to the state spelling bee, and wins again, qualifying her for the Spellympics to be held in Calgary. Marge suggests they celebrate by going to a movie, but Homer says he has \\"important daddy business\\" ‚Äî which turns out to be eating Ribwiches with Lenny and Carl at Krusty Burger, only to find that the limited-time-only Ribwiches are out of stock. However, a \\"Ribhead\\" (a fan of the Ribwich) tells Homer that it is being tested in other markets, so he decides to follow a group of Ribheads as they track the release of the Ribwich tour schedule. At the Spellympics, hosted by George Plimpton, Lisa wins the semi-finals and secures a spot in the finals. The other two finalists are Sun Moon, a Korean girl, and Alex, a cute boy with big round glasses and a speech impediment who proves to be extremely popular. Plimpton takes Lisa aside and tells her that if she lets Alex win, she will be given a free scholarship to any Seven Sisters college and a free George Plimpton hot plate. Lisa is torn between wanting to win the Spellympics and free college, and asks Marge whether they can afford to send her to college. Marge is unsure, but promises to do whatever it takes to get Lisa into college, but Lisa is still uneasy since she is aware of Homer's low salary. In San Francisco, Krusty informs all the Ribheads that the Ribwich will no longer be made, as the animal from which it was made is now extinct. He tosses the last one into the crowd. Homer catches it, fighting off the others. An Italian Ribhead offers Homer the \\"lease-a\\" to his car for the last Ribwich, and Homer remembers Lisa and the Spellympics. He agrees to the trade and takes off in the car, reaching the Spellympics finals just in time to see Lisa spell \\"intransigence\\" and encourage her. Lisa, happy to see her father, tells everyone that she was told to take a dive, but then unintentionally misspells her word. Lisa loses, and since she did not do it on purpose, Plimpton rescinds his offer. On the way back to Springfield, Homer tries to cheer up Lisa when she admits that she let down everyone in town. However, she finds that in coming second she has become Springfield's most successful native ever (even outachieving the Springfield woman who once dated Charles Grodin). In her honor, the town carved Lisa's face on the side of a mountain. Production A lengthy scene at the beginning of the show where Bart rushes to do everything he planned on doing during summer vacation was cut for time. The scene was later placed in the opening of the season 17 episode \\"The Monkey Suit\\", which aired three years later. Cultural references The sequence where Homer becomes addicted to the Ribwich is a parody of the Darren Aronofsky film Requiem for a Dream (2000). Boobarella, who appears at the beginning of the episode, is a parody of Elvira, the seductive gothic character portrayed by Cassandra Peterson. While opening the school, Principal Skinner sings a parody of \\"School's Out\\" by Alice Cooper. The song played during the Spellympics and during the credits is \\"I Put a Spell on You\\" by Screamin' Jay Hawkins. The song played at the beginning of the Spellympics finals is \\"Get Ready for This\\" by 2 Unlimited. This song was also played in the episode \\"Homer and Ned's Hail Mary Pass\\" and \\"To Surveil with Love\\". The song played during the TV ad for the Ribwich is a parody of \\"Like a Rock\\" by Bob Seger, which is best known as Chevrolet trucks theme music through most of the 1990s. The title of the episode is a reference to the 1981 book I'm Dancing as Fast as I Can, by Barbara Gordon. The stairs Lisa runs up are similar to the Rocky Steps. A reference to AC/DC is made when Otto asks Lisa to spell AC/DC and she spells it A-C-D-C, but after she finishes, Otto says \\"you forgot the lightning bolt\\" (referring to the band's logo). Homer following the Ribwich around with the Ribheads is a play on Deadheads, fans of jam-band music (the Grateful Dead in particular) who follow the band when on tour in order to see multiple concerts. At one point, Krusty the Clown says \\"what a long strange product rollout it's been\\". This is a reference to the famous line \\"what a long strange trip it's been\\" in the Grateful Dead song \\"Truckin'\\". The Ribwich is a parody of McRib and its promotions. Reception In 2011, Keith Plocek of LA Weeklys Squid Ink blog named \\"I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can\\" the second best episode of the show with a food theme, commenting: \\"Spelling bee, schmelling bee. The star of this 2003 episode is the Ribwich, an obvious nod to McDonald's McRib.\\" ReferencesExternal links *\\"I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can\\" at The Simpsons.com \\"I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can script at Springfield, Springfield!

Augustana. 13 April 2010 was born in the still existent town of Al Hillah, Iraq. commonly viewed as the centre of Shia Islam when Sunni leaders were in control over Baghdad during his life. He entered into a prominent family of Shia jurists and theologians. His father, Sadid ul-Din al-Hilli, was a respected mujtahid and a leading figure in the Shia community. His maternal uncle Muhaqqiq al-Hilli was also a renowned scholar. He studied theology and fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) in Hilla under the auspices of his father and his uncle, as well as other notable scholars, including: Ali bin Tawus and Ahmad bin Tawus. He also spent some time at the newly established Maragheh observatory, where he studied Avicennan philosophy and mathematics under Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, and was also introduced to the works of Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. Later, he travelled to Baghdad and became acquainted with the doctrines of Ibn Arabi. Among his other teachers were Najm al-Dƒ´n al-Qazwƒ´nƒ´ al-KƒÅtibƒ´ and Maitham Al Bahrani. He also sat with the Sunni scholars to study Sunni Fiqh. Like Al Bahrani and Nasir, 'Allamah-i Hilli was contemporary with the Mongol upheaval, and played a role similar to that of his teacher. Allamah-i Hilli was a prolific writer whose bibliography comprises about one hundred and twenty titles. Some of his works have been published, while the manuscripts of others have still to be found.Al-Suhrawardi and the Philosophy of Light, P.59 After mastering philosophy, theology and astrology as a pupil of the eminent scholars of his time, he began a prolific career as an authoritative writer in his own right. Some 500 works are attributed to him, although only a few have been published so far. He moved to Persia in 705/1305, where he became most influential in spreading Shia Islam within Il-Khanid court circles.Ismaili and other Arabic manuscripts: a descriptive catalogue of manuscripts In 1305, Al- Hilli emigrated to Persia, to the court of the Ilkhan ruler √ñljait√º, whom it is believed he converted from Sunni to Shia Islam. As a result of his conversion, √ñljait√º proclaimed Shia Islam as the state religion in Persia. Coins were minted in the names of The Twelve Imams. Both al-Hilli and his son, Fakhr ul-Muhaqqiqin were engaged in extensive theological and jurisprudential debates with the local Sunni scholars. Having impressed the Ilkhan, he was appointed to the traveling madrassah sayyarah. Al-Hilli, however, eventually returned to his hometown and spent the last years of his life teaching there.Schmidkte, S. ·∏§ELLI, ·∏§ASAN B. YUSOF B. MO·π¨AHHAR. Encyclopaedia Iranica (www.iranicaonline.org, accessed: 28.09.09) Intellectual output According to some sources, Al-Hilli wrote more than a thousand works (including short treatises and epistles) on Islamic law, jurisprudence, theology and Qur'anic commentary.Tehrani, Aga Buzurg, Tabaqat 'Alam il-Shi'ah, v.5 p.53 (Arabic) Of these, about sixty are still extant. Yet, only eight of these are published. They are ‚Äúregarded by the Imami Shi'ia as the most authentic expositions of their dogma and practice‚Äù. The popularity and influence of his writings on later scholars are demonstrated by the large number of manuscripts and great number of commentaries written on them. He himself is the best source of information on his own works as he has recorded all of his writings up to the year 1294 in his biographical work Khulasat ul-Aqwal (The Summary of Opinions). =Theology= In theology, Al-Hilli was clearly acquainted with the Basran school of Mu'tazilism, as his earliest writing on theology Manhaj ul-Yaqin fi Usul il-Din, demonstrates. He was also deeply influenced by Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, and wrote a commentary on the latter's famous Tajrid ul-I'tiqad. This commentary is one of al-Hilli's most widely read works, being the first commentary written on the Tajrid and thus forming the basis of later commentators understanding of Tusi's work. Also due to his work in Tajrid ul-I'tiqad, Al-Hilli has been noted as one of the first Shia Imamiyyah scholars to use the term, ijtihad (i‚Äôtiqad) in the sense of ‚Äúputting in of the utmost effort in acquiring the knowledge of the laws of the Shariah‚Äù.Mutahhari, Martyr Murtada . \\"The Role of Ijtihad in Legislation.\\" Al- Tawhid: A Quarterly Journal of Islamic Thought & Culture 4.2 (0): n. pag. http://www.al-islam.org/al-tawhid/. Web. 10 Apr. 2010. From this point Shia accepted this term. Another of his most famous theological works is The Eleventh Chapter (Al-Bab al-Hadi 'Ashar - the title is an allusion to an earlier work of his, Manhaj ul-Salat, which was composed of ten chapters), which he composed towards the end of his life as a concise summary of Shia doctrines for the learned lay person (rather than aspiring scholars). Judging by the number of commentaries written on it, and its translation into Persian and English, it represents his most popular work. He wrote several polemical treatises during his time at the court of the Ilkhan. These were largely directed against Sunni, Ash'arite theology. In them, he was largely concerned with espousing and defending the Shia view of the Imamate and Mutazilite notions of free will (as opposed to Asharite determinism). He was also acquainted with Avicennan and Ishraqi philosophy. He wrote several works of his own, dealing with subjects such as logic, physics, metaphysics and mathematics. In general he is very critical of the opinions held by Islamic philosophers and sets out to rebut them whenever they appear to disagree with mainstream theology. According to the Encyclopaedia of Islam, ‚Äúhis services were so much appreciated by the Shi'is that soon after his death his grave in Mashhad became one of the centres of veneration for those who go on pilgrimage to the tomb of Imam 'Ali-al-Rida‚Äù. =Jurisprudence= Al-Hilli's role in shaping Twelver jurisprudence is of great importance. As well as several works and commentaries on usul al-fiqh, he produced a voluminous legal corpus. Of this, two of the most important works are al-Mukhtalaf (The Disagreement) and al-Muntaha (The End). Mukhtalaf is a legal manual devoted to addressing legal questions in which the Shia jurists hold differing opinions, whereas the Muntaha is a systematic and detailed exposition of al-Hilli's own legal opinions. He also wrote a summarized legal manual, Qawa'id ul-Ahkam, which was popular amongst later scholars, judging by the number of commentaries that would be written on it. Amongst his later legal works is Tadhkirat ul-Fuqaha, which is a legal manual intended for use by lay persons. He also composed legal works on specific issues (for example, Hajj or Salat).  Works  One of his works on the concept of the Shia Imamate (Minhaj al-karamah) was criticized by the Sunni scholar Ibn Taymiyyah in his nine volume work Minhaaj As-Sunnah An-Nabawiyyah. Besides various treatises on religious law, 'Allamah established a systematic version of the science of tradition (hadith and akhbar), based on principles which were later to antagonise the usuliyun and the akhbariyun. In the kalam tradition, he left a commentary on one of the first treatises to be written by one of the oldest Imamite mutakallimun, Abu Ishaq Ibrahim al Nawbakhti, who died about 350/961. Similarly, he wrote commentaries on the two treatises by Nasir mentioned above, Tajrid and Qawa'id-commentaries which have been read and re-read, studied and commentated by generations of scholars. He left a summary of the vast commentary by his teacher Maytham al-Bahrani on the Nahj al-Balagha. Using the methods both of a man of the kalam and of a philosopher, he wrote studies on Avicenna's Al- Isharat wa-‚Äòl-tanbihat (Remarks and Admonitions) and Kitab Al-Shifa æ (The Book of Healing); attempted to solve the difficulties (hill al-mushkilat) of al- Suhrawardi's Kitab al-talwihat (Book of Elucidations); wrote a treatise comparing (tanasub) the Ash'arites and the Sophists; two other encyclopaedic treatises, The Hidden Secrets (al-Asar al-khaffyah) in philosophical sciences, the autographed version of which is at Najaf, and a Complete Course of Instruction (Ta'lim tamm) on philosophy and the kalam, etc. He casts doubt on the principle Ex Uno non fit nisi Unum (only One can proceed from the One), as his teacher Nasir Tusi, inspired by al-Suhrawardi, had done before him, and he concedes the existence of an intra-substantial motion which heralds the theory of Mulla Sadra.Al-Suhrawardi and the Philosophy of Light, P.59-60  Works  Tadhkirat al-FuqahƒÅ',The opening double page of manuscript has an illuminated floral headpiece in the style of the Safavid period in Iran (1501-1732), with colours predominantly in gold, blue and pink.

His most notable works are the following: # Kashf al- Yaqin fi Fa·∏çƒÅ'il Amƒ´r al-Mu'minƒ´n , a short treatise on the excellence of Ali ('Alƒ´ Ibn Abƒ´ ·π¨ƒÅlib'). # Kihalastah al-Nisab, a treatise on the descendants of Ali, Alawi.

It was originally released on 18 October 1993 on Fontana. It distinguishes itself from the rest of the Twins' catalogue in two major areas: The sound is much more pop-oriented and less ambient than previous works, and vocalist Elizabeth Fraser's lyrics are more intelligible than usual. Their single \\"Evangeline\\" was a moderate hit in several countries. \\"Bluebeard\\" was a moderate success on the United States modern charts. Title and artwork The album took its title from William Least Heat-Moon's book Blue Highways, in which the author considers the quality of a restaurant by how many calendars it has hanging on its wall. NME named it the 46th best record of 1993. The cover image was taken by Walter Wick, who is known for his photography for the children's book series I Spy.

History  In 1792, a group of Presbyterians established a church near Mount Bethel's current location. It was first called the Mountain Church in 1808 and soon became the center of Presbyterian work in Hampshire County under the auspices of the Reverend John Lyle. The Reverend James Black reorganized the congregation in 1812 and it was renamed Mount Bethel. The present church, built of logs in 1837, is the oldest house of worship in Hampshire County.

ACS reports that it has approximately 200 law school student chapters and 40 lawyer chapters around the country. On November 14, 2018, the American Constitution Society released a letter signed by over 1,600 attorneys nationwide calling for lawmakers and Justice Department officials to protect the special counsel's Russia probe in light of Matthew Whitaker's appointment as acting attorney general. The signatories call for Whitaker to recuse himself or \\"otherwise be removed from overseeing the Mueller investigation as a result of his profound ethical conflicts.\\" History The American Constitution Society was founded in 2001 by Peter Rubin, a Georgetown Law School professor who served as counsel to Al Gore in the legal battle over the 2000 election. The group was originally known as the Madison Society for Law and Policy. The organization was formed as a counterweight to the conservative Federalist Society. It was founded in order to build a network of progressive lawyers and foster new avenues of progressive legal thought. ACS received its initial funding from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. The Democracy Alliance lists ACS as a recommended funding recipient. Board of directors Members of the organization's board of directors have included David Halperin, a speechwriter in the Bill Clinton administration who also served as the organization's founding executive director from 2001 to 2003; and Eric Holder, former Attorney General of the United States. Activities ACS hosts press and Capitol Hill briefings and public policy debates as well as an annual convention where an array of legal and public policy issues are discussed and debated. The organization disseminates ACS Issue Briefs, the ACSBlog, a journal titled Harvard Law and Policy Review, and Advance: The Journal of the ACS Issue Groups. In 2008, ACS's executive director, Lisa Brown, went on leave to serve on the Barack Obama transition team. She headed the president-elect's agency review team and later served as the first White House Staff Secretary in the Obama White House. In 2009, ACS published Keeping Faith with the Constitution by Pamela S. Karlan, Goodwin Liu, and Christopher H. Schroeder. It was re-issued by Oxford University Press in 2010. The book serves as a primer for progressives interested in promoting liberal constitutionalism. Since 2009, ACS has given an annual award to a rising star in public interest law named in memory of David Carliner. The Carliner award comes with a $10,000 prize for the winner, plus money for the winner's organization and for a finalist.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 16, 2003. Plot A sleepy Marge is too tired on Valentine's Day to have sex with an eager and well-prepared Homer, who dejectedly leaves the house. He sees a billboard for a school offering extension courses. He goes to the school and attempts to take a course on stripping for his wife, which Dr. Hibbert teaches, but is kicked out for hogging the stripping oil. By accident, Homer winds up in a different class that teaches strategies for workplace success. Inspired by the lessons, he begins to investigate problems at the power plant and propose solutions to Mr. Burns, who rejects them all without reading them. Homer later overhears Burns state that he has made a canary the legal owner of the plant in order to avoid any consequences of wrongdoing. With help from Bart, he devises a plan to overthrow Burns by setting the canary free. Homer tricks Burns into believing that a team of inspectors is visiting to check conditions at the plant; when Burns is unable to find the canary, he panics and names Homer as the new owner. Homer's first act is to throw Burns from the office balcony, allowing a throng of employees in the parking lot to crowd- surf him into a waiting taxi. Burns and Smithers flee to Marrakesh, Morocco, intent on purchasing a large quantity of opium. The responsibilities of running the plant soon force Homer to spend most of his time at work instead of with the family, and he becomes miserable after having to lay off employees and listen to business analysts discuss the plant's troubles. Burns visits Homer one night (informing him that Smithers has been sentenced to 80 years in prison for drug possession) and takes him to the cemetery, showing him the graves of people whose relationships with Burns suffered because he worked so much - including his wife. Homer decides to return ownership of the plant to Burns, who drugs him into unconsciousness and begins to wall him up inside one of the cemetery crypts. However, he is so slow and weak at building the wall that Homer easily steps over the few bricks he has laid after waking up. Leaving the plant in Burns' hands, Homer returns home to have a barbecue with his family and enjoy his old life again. Production The live-action flipbook couch gag was actually intended for another episode but it was placed into this one instead. The couch gag director Mike Polcino hired a hand model to play the part of the animator. It was a reference to the way animators flip through recently drawn images to make sure the action flows properly. As the chosen couch gag is often dependent on the length of the episode, this relatively short one was placed into C.E.D'oh, a longer Simpsons episode than the one it was originally intended for.The Simpsons staff. (2003). Commentary for \\"C.E.D'oh\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourteenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The writers said that they did not want to watch characters \\"walking around\\" as it was not funny, and instead wanted them to \\"go from joke to joke\\". They however note that the entire act one closer consists of Homer wandering through town seeing things. They justify it by explaining that a \\"sweet romantic\\" mood is being built, and that a slower pace was needed. Steve Moore posed for the scene where Snake strangles inmate Terrance, only for Homer to misinterpret it as love. Another suggestion for Dr Hibbert's stripper name that was pitched besides \\"Malcolm Sex\\" (which made it into the episode) was \\"Christmas Buttocks\\". In this scene, where Hibbert leads a \\"Strip For Your Wife\\" seminar on Valentine's Day, the team included regulars rather than Simpson-ised extras. This led to random cameos such as Cletus and one of the mobsters. Edwin Aguilar did all the animation for the Legoland sequence, yet he is not featured in the episode's credits. According to Al Jean, Matt Groening pitched the joke where Homer puts a blanket over Mr Burns after his failed attempt to brick Homer up.Jean, Al. (2003). Commentary for \\"C.E.D'oh\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourteenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Cultural references In the episode, Lenny and Carl begin to fight each other with plutonium rods, simulating lightsabers. They fight over whether The Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones \\"sucked more\\". The prank that is pulled in American Graffiti is parodied in the Itchy & Scratchy short \\"Bleeder of the Pack\\". At the end of \\"Bleeder of the Pack\\" Scratchy is involved in an airplane crash together with Ritchie Valens, Buddy Holly and The Big Bopper, which is a reference to the tragical plane crash on February 3, 1959. Legoland is referenced when Smithers says Mr. Burns has dumped nuclear waste under it for years. The scene where Ned Flanders stares at Homer and Marge at night from his bedroom window, in the dark with the cigar lit, is a parody of Rear Window. The scene where Mr Burns attempts to brick Homer up is a satire of The Cask of Amontillado by Edgar Allan Poe. The episode ends with the theme song to the 1969-1972 show The Courtship of Eddie's Father. The head of the \\"Successmanship 101\\" seminar, played by Hank Azaria, is a parody of Alec Baldwin's character in the film Glengarry Glen Ross. Bart exclaims \\"Look at me! I'm Tomokazu Ohka of the Montreal Expos !\\" while playing baseball, to which Milhouse replies \\"Well, I'm Esteban Yan of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays!\\", referencing the relative obscurity of the two pitchers and their respective teams. The Expos would relocate to Washington, D.C. a year later and the Devil Rays would rebrand to the Rays four years later. The episode title is a reference to the corporate position of Chief Executive Officer. Critical reception On IMDb, the episode has a rating of 7.2/10 from 319 users. In 2014, The Simpsons writers picked \\"Bleeder of the Pack\\" from this episode as one of their nine favorite \\"Itchy & Stratchy\\" episodes of all time. ReferencesExternal links *\\"C.E.

Percy Bysshe Shelley painted by Amelia Curran in 1819 \\"Hymn to Intellectual Beauty\\" is a poem written by Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1816 and published in 1817. Composition and publication \\"Hymn to Intellectual Beauty\\" was written during the summer of 1816 while Percy and Mary Shelley stayed with Lord Byron near Lake Geneva, Switzerland. Percy Shelley sent a finished copy of the poem to his friend Leigh Hunt who immediately lost it. Shelley was therefore forced to create another finished draft of the poem and resend the poem. It was eventually published in Hunt's Examiner on 19 January 1817.Reiman and Fraistat 2002 p. 92 The poem also appeared in the 1819 collection Rosalind and Helen, A Modern Eclogue; With Other Poems printed by C. H. Reynell for Charles and James Ollier in London and in Miscellaneous and Posthumous Poems of Percy Bysshe Shelley by William Benbow in 1826 in London. After the initial publication, Percy Shelley corrected lines 27 and 58 but made no other changes. A second finished version was discovered in December 1976 in the Scrope Davies Notebook; it was written in Mary Shelley's hand and contained many differences from the first published edition.Reiman and Fraistat 2002 p. 93 Summary The shadow of a strange power floats unseen throughout the world, entering into man, coming and going mysteriously. Shelley asks this shadow, which he calls a \\"Spirit of Beauty,\\" where it has gone and why it disappears and leaves us desolate. Then he acknowledges that it is vain to ask this question; one might as well ask why rainbows disappear or why man can both love and hate, despair and hope. No voice from another world has ever answered these questions. The \\"names of Demon, Ghost, and Heaven\\" are the record of men's vain attempts to get answers to such questions. Only the light of the Spirit of Beauty gives grace and truth to the restless dream which life is. If the Spirit of Beauty remained constantly with man, man would be immortal and omnipotent. It nourishes human thought. The poet beseeches this spirit not to depart from the world. Without it, death would be an experience to be feared. In his youth, Shelley sought spiritual reality in ghosts and the dead. In his search, the shadow of the Spirit of Beauty suddenly fell on him and filled him with elation. He vowed that he would dedicate himself to this Spirit and he has kept his vow. He is convinced that it will free the world from the state of slavery in which it is. He prays that this power will bring calm to his life, for he worships it. It has taught him to fear himself and love all mankind. Poem \\"Hymn to Intellectual Beauty\\" is an 84-line ode that was influenced by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's novel of sensibility Julie, or the New Heloise and William Wordsworth's \\"Ode: Intimations of Immortality\\". Although the theme of the ode, glory's departure, is shared with Wordsworth's ode, Shelley holds a differing view of nature:Bloom 1993 p. 290 :The awful shadow of some unseen Power :Floats through unseen among us, ‚Äì visiting :This various world with as inconstant wing :As summer winds that creep from flower to flower. ‚Äì :Like moonbeams that behind some piny mountain shower, :It visits with inconstant glance :Each human heart and countenance; :Like hues and harmonies of evening :Like clouds of starlight widely spread, :Like memories of music fled, :Like aught that for its grace may be ‚Äì :Dear, and yet dearer for its mystery. The second stanza begins with the narrator addressing Intellectual Beauty: :Spirit of Beauty, that dost consecrate :With thine own hues all thou dost shine upon :Of human thought or form, ‚Äì where art thou gone? :Why dost thou pass away and leave our state, :This dim vast vale of tears, vacant and desolate? (Lines 13‚Äì17) :Ask why sunlight not forever, :Weaves rainbows o'er yon mountain river. :Why aught should fail and fade that once is shown, :Why fear and dream and death and birth, :Cast on the daylight of this earth such gloom ‚Äì :Why does man have such a scope :For love and hate, despondency and hope? But he is not answered, as he reveals in stanza three: :No voice from some sublimer world hath ever :To sage or poet these responses given ‚Äì :Therefore the name of God and ghosts and Heaven, :Remain the records of their vain endeavour, (Lines 25‚Äì28) The fourth stanza reveals three values: :Love, Hope, and Self-esteem, like clouds depart :And come, for some uncertain moments lent. :Man were immortal, and omnipotent, :Didst thou, unknown and awful as thou art, :Keep with thy glorious train firm state within his heart. (Lines 36‚Äì41) Shelley replaces the third of the Christian values, faith, with self-esteem, which signifies respect for the human imagination. According to the narrator, we have only temporary access to these values and can only attain them through Intellectual Beauty: :Thou messenger of sympathies, :That wax and wane in lovers's eyes- :Thou ‚Äì that to human thought art nourishment, :Like darkness to a dying flame! :Depart not as thy shadow came, :Depart not ‚Äì lest the grave should be, :Like life and fear, a dark reality. (Lines 42‚Äì48) In stanza five, he reveals: :While yet a boy I sought for ghosts, and sped :Through many a listening chamber, cave and ruin, :And starlight wood, with fearful steps pursuing :Hopes of high talk with the departed dead. (Lines 49‚Äì52) The words he speaks, possibly referring to Christian doctrines, brought him no response. It was not until he mused on life that he was able to experience a sort of religious awakening and learn of Intellectual Beauty:Bloom 1993 p. 292 :Sudden, thy shadow fell on me; :I shrieked, and clasped my hands in ecstasy! (Lines 59‚Äì60) Once he learns of Intellectual Beauty, he makes a vow, which begins stanza six: :I vowed that I would dedicate my powers :To thee and thine ‚Äì have I not kept the vow? Stanza seven continues with the vow: :Thus let thy power, which like the truth :Of nature on my passive youth :Descended, to my onward life supply :Its calm ‚Äì to one who worships thee, :And every form containing thee, :Whom, Spirit fair, thy spells did bind :To fear himself, and love all human kind. (Lines 78‚Äì84) The narrator breaks from the Wordsworthian tradition by realising that Intellectual Beauty, and not manifestations of it in nature, is what should be worshipped. The imagination, and not nature, is connected to truth, and the narrator realises that he should revere his own imagination and the imagination of others.Bloom 1993 pp. 292‚Äì193 =Variations= The first published edition varies from both the copy found in the Scrope Davies Notebook copy of the poem and the original manuscript draft in terms of language and philosophical view.O'Neill 2002 p. 618 Themes Shelley's understanding of Beauty as an ideal and universal aspect, as opposed to the common understanding of the word as an aesthetic judgment of an object, was influenced by his knowledge of Plato's writings. However, where Plato believed Beauty should be sought after gradually in degrees until one can achieve true Beauty, a process made possible through dialectic, Shelley believed that Beauty could also be found through its earthly manifestations and could only be connected to through the use of the imagination. The origins of Shelley's understanding of Beauty and how to attain it can be found within \\"Hymn to Intellectual Beauty\\". The poem's theme is Beauty, but Shelley's understanding of how the mind works is different from Plato's: Plato wrote (principally in the Symposium) that Beauty is a metaphysical object existing independent of our experiences of particular concrete objects, while Shelley believed that philosophy and metaphysics could not reveal truth and that an understanding of Beauty was futile. Instead, Beauty could only be felt and its source could not be known.Pulos 1985 pp. 38‚Äì40, 42 Analysis The \\"Hymn to Intellectual Beauty\\" was conceived and written during a boating excursion with Byron on Lake Geneva, Switzerland, in June 1816. The beauty of the lake and of the Swiss Alps is responsible for Shelley's elevating what he calls \\"Intellectual Beauty\\" to the ruling principle of the universe. Alpine scenery was new to Shelley and unutterably beautiful. He was profoundly moved by it, and the poem, he wrote to Leigh Hunt, was \\"composed under the influence of feelings which agitated me even to tears.\\" Thanks to the Alps, Shelley, who had given up Christianity, had at last found a deity which he could wholeheartedly adore. The worship of beauty is Shelley's new religion, and it is significant that he calls his poem a hymn, a term used almost exclusively for religious verse. Later, in August 1817, Shelley read Plato's Symposium and his faith in beauty was no doubt strengthened by Plato's discussion of abstract beauty in that work and in the Phaedrus, which Shelley read in August 1818. It was daily intercourse with stunning beauty, not Plato, however, that brought Shelley to his new faith. Joseph Barrell, in Shelley and the Thought of His Time: A Study in the History of Ideas, has shown that the \\"Hymn\\" is not Platonic. The central idea of \\"Hymn to Intellectual Beauty\\" is that there is a spiritual power that stands apart from both the physical world and the heart of man. This power is unknown to man and invisible, but its shadow visits \\"this various world with as inconstant wing / As summer winds that creep from flower to flower\\" and it visits also \\"with inconstant glance / Each human heart and countenance.\\" When it passes away it leaves \\"our state, / This dim vast vale of tears, vacant and desolate.\\" Shelley does not profess to know why Intellectual Beauty, which he calls \\"unknown and awful,\\" is an inconstant visitor, but he is convinced that if it kept \\"with [its] glorious train firm state\\" within man's heart, man would be \\"immortal and omnipotent.\\" But since the Spirit of Beauty visits the world and man's heart with such irregularity, Shelley pleads with his deity rather than praises it. It remains remote and inaccessible. In the concluding stanza Shelley is a suppliant praying that the power of the Spirit of Beauty will continue to supply its calm \\"to one who worships thee, / And every form containing thee.\\" In Stanza V, Shelley confesses that in his youth, while he was searching for spiritual reality, chiefly by reading Gothic romances, the shadow of Intellectual Beauty suddenly fell on him. He shrieked and clasped his hands in ecstasy. As a consequence of this experience, he tells us in Stanza VI, he vowed that he would dedicate his \\"powers / To thee and thine,\\" and he has kept his vow. The experience also left him with the hope that the Spirit of Beauty would free \\"this world from its dark slavery.\\" In this stanza, Shelley combined two of the major interests of his life, love of beauty and love of freedom. In regard to the \\"Intellectual Beauty\\" of the title, Barrell remarked that it implies an approach by means of the mental faculties but that Shelley meant to convey the idea that his concept of beauty was abstract rather than concrete. His approach is romantic and emotional. Shelley, however, thinks of his Spirit of Beauty as personal, like the God of Christianity. He addresses it, pleads with it, worships it, but is using only the rhetorical device of personification. NotesReferences * Barrell, Joseph.

It runs from MD 662 in Wye Mills on the border of Queen Anne's and Talbot counties, southeast to the Delaware state line in Caroline County, where the road continues as Delaware Route 404 (DE 404) to Five Points (near Rehoboth Beach). The Maryland and Delaware state highways together cross the width of the Delmarva Peninsula and serve to connect the cities west of the Chesapeake Bay by way of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and U.S. Route 50 (US 50) with the Delaware Beaches. Along the way, MD 404 passes through mostly farmland and woodland as well as the towns of Queen Anne, Hillsboro, and Denton. The route is a four-lane divided highway between US 50 and east of Denton, with the remainder of the route a two-lane undivided road. MD 404 was designated by 1933 to run from Matapeake (where the Annapolis-Matapeake ferry across the Chesapeake Bay connected the route to Annapolis), east along present-day MD 8, US 50, and MD 662 to Wye Mills, where it followed its current routing to the Delaware border. By 1946, the route's western terminus was moved to MD 2 north of Annapolis, where it headed east across the Chesapeake Bay on the Sandy Point-Matapeake ferry. The western terminus was cut back to Wye Mills in 1949, having been replaced by US 50 west of there. The route was realigned to bypass Queen Anne and Hillsboro in 1960 and Denton in 1987. Since MD 404 is the main route for travelers between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and the Delaware Beaches, the road experienced a high accident rate. To improve on this situation, the Maryland State Highway Administration planned to widen the two-lane portions of the route into a four-lane divided highway. A portion of the road east of Tuckahoe Creek in Caroline County received $7.7 million for widening as a part of the stimulus bill signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2009; this section was widened in 2012. Widening on the remainder of MD 404 between US 50 and Denton was completed in November 2017. Route description MD 404 eastbound past its western terminus at MD 662 in Wye Mills MD 404 begins at an intersection with MD 662 (Old Wye Mills Road) in Wye Mills on the border of Queen Anne's and Talbot Counties, heading to the east on Queen Anne's Highway, a two-lane undivided road. It heads east through farmland along the Queen Anne's/Talbot County border before reaching an intersection with US 50 (Ocean Gateway). This intersection has park and ride lots on the northwest and northeast corners. From here, MD 404 continues east through farmland with some residences and wooded areas as a four-lane divided highway, approaching the town of Queen Anne. Further east, Old Queen Anne Road splits from MD 404 at an eastbound right-in/right-out intersection, with MD 404 crossing entirely into Queen Anne's County. It resumes east through some farmland before coming to an intersection with MD 309 (Starr Road). Past MD 309, the route intersects the northern terminus of MD 303 (Cordova Road), which intersects the route at a right-in/right-out intersection with the eastbound lanes of MD 404. From MD 303, the road enters wooded areas adjacent to Tuckahoe State Park, heading across an abandoned railroad grade owned by the Maryland Department of Transportation, before crossing the Tuckahoe Creek. MD 404 eastbound past MD 309 in Queen Anne MD 404 enters Caroline County upon crossing the Tuckahoe Creek, where it becomes Shore Highway. It emerges from the woods into agricultural areas, intersecting MD 480 (Ridgely Road) near Hillsboro. Past that intersection, the route heads through a mix of woods and residences before coming to a junction with MD 404 Alt. (Hillsboro Road), where MD 404 heads into a mix of farms and woodland. Unsigned MD 485 (Saathoff Road) loops to the south of MD 404, returning to the route before the intersection with the southern terminus of MD 312 (Downes Station Road). The route continues to the southeast through farms, heading toward Denton. As the road approaches Denton, it heads through rural areas with some residences and businesses. MD 404 Bus. (Meeting House Road) splits from MD 404 to head through the center of Denton while MD 404 continues east to bypass Denton to the north. The route continues east through fields before intersecting MD 328 (New Bridge Road). Past this intersection, MD 404 crosses over the Choptank River on the Governor Harry R. Hughes Bridge. It continues east as a freeway with a diamond interchange at MD 313 (Greensboro Road) and MD 619 (Sixth Street), where some businesses are located. MD 313 forms a concurrency with MD 404 and the two routes turn south, heading along the eastern side of Denton through woodland and then past residential neighborhoods. The road turns to the southwest, heading into woods and intersecting MD 404 Bus. (Franklin Street/Gay Street) at an at-grade intersection, where the freeway section ends. MD 313 and MD 404 continue as a four-lane divided highway with at-grade intersections that turns south and heads through some commercial areas. The road heads south into farmland, passing east of Martinak State Park. It crosses over Watts Creek and comes to an intersection with MD 16 (Harmony Road), with that route joining MD 313 and MD 404 for a three-way concurrency. The three routes continue southeast, narrowing into a two-lane undivided road that heads through a mix of woods and farms with some homes. The road turns more to the east-southeast, with MD 313 splitting from MD 16 and MD 404 by heading south on Federalsburg Highway in Andersontown. The road turns southeast and in a short distance, MD 16 splits from MD 404 by heading east on Greenwood Road. Past this intersection, MD 404 continues southeast through farmland and woodland to the Delaware border, where the road continues as DE 404, which runs east to an intersection with DE 1 in Five Points (near Rehoboth Beach). East of US 50, MD 404 serves as part of the main route connecting the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area to the Delaware Beaches. MD 404 is a part of the main National Highway System for its entire length except for the portion from MD 662 to US 50 in Wye Mills. History By 1921, what would become MD 404 was built as a state highway within Queen Anne, from Hillsboro to a point between Hillsboro and Denton, and between West Denton and Denton. The state highway between Queen Anne and Denton was completed by 1927. By 1933, MD 404 was designated onto a state highway between Matapeake, where the Annapolis-Matapeake ferry across the Chesapeake Bay connected the route to Annapolis in Anne Arundel County, and the Delaware border southeast of Denton. The route headed east across Kent Island to Queenstown, where it turned southeast to Wye Mills and continued east through Queen Anne, Hillsboro, and Denton. By 1946, the route's western terminus was moved to MD 2 north of Annapolis in Anne Arundel County, crossing the Chesapeake Bay on the Sandy Point-Matapeake ferry, roughly where the Chesapeake Bay Bridge is now, and continuing west through Skidmore to MD 2. MD 404 was rerouted to bypass Wye Mills in 1948, with part of the former alignment through the community becoming part of MD 662. Shields for MD 16, MD 313, and MD 404 along a concurrency in Andersontown A year later, the western terminus of MD 404 was moved to MD 662 in Wye Mills. West of Wye Mills, the route was replaced by an extended US 50. The former alignment of MD 404 west of Wye Mills is now the US 50 approaches to the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, with the part between Matapeake and Stevensville now a part of MD 8. In 1950, MD 404 was rerouted to bypass Queen Anne and Hillsboro to the north, with the former alignment now Old Queen Anne Road and MD 404 Alt. A portion of the route between Hillsboro and Denton was bypassed in 1960. This former alignment of MD 404 is now known as Saathoff Road and has the unsigned MD 485 designation. In 1972, MD 404 and MD 313 were relocated to a one-way pair, eastbound Franklin Street and westbound Gay Street, through Denton. The routes previously headed south out of Denton on Sixth Street and Fifth Avenue. The former alignment along Sixth Street became MD 619 by 1978. In the early 1980s, construction began to widen MD 404 to a divided highway. By 1985, construction was underway for the four-lane divided bypass of Denton between MD 404 west of Denton and MD 313 north of Denton. In 1987, MD 313 and MD 404 were rerouted to bypass Denton along the newly completed four-lane divided bypass. The former alignment of MD 404 through Denton became MD 404 Bus. The Maryland State Highway Administration worked on improvements to MD 404 in order to provide relief to travelers driving to the ocean resorts, notably by widening the remainder of the route into a four-lane divided highway. The primary motive behind the widening was the high accident rate that plagued the two-lane road, brought on by beach traffic. The divided highway portion of MD 404 in the Denton area was extended further in the 2000s from the south end of Denton to the Sennett Road intersection east of where MD 16 joins the route. The section between south of Legion Road and Double Hills Road was widened in 2005 while the section between Double Hills Road and Sennett Road was widened in 2007. This project received $3 million from the federal government in 2001. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 signed into law by President Barack Obama on February 17, 2009, $7.7 million went to widening a portion of MD 404 east of Tuckahoe Creek in Caroline County, creating 221 jobs. The widening of this section was completed in 2012. On May 21, 2014, groundbreaking took place to widen MD 404 between west of MD 309 and Cemetery Road. The project to widen this section of will cost a total of $39 million. On June 25, 2015, Governor Larry Hogan announced that state funding would be allocated to finish widening MD 404 between US 50 and Denton, among other projects across the state. A total of $160 million in funds would go to widening MD 404. Widening of the section between west of MD 309 and Cemetery Road was completed in summer 2017. Widening of the remaining sections of MD 404 between US 50 and Denton was completed on November 20, 2017, with Governor Hogan in attendance for a ribbon-cutting ceremony. On May 29, 2011, the Route 404 Memorial Garden, located near Denton, was dedicated, honoring those who were killed in car accidents along MD 404. The memorial consists of a flagpole surrounded by a circular path with bricks bearing the names of people who died along the route.

The route runs along the former alignment of MD 404 through the towns of Queen Anne and Hillsboro. The route begins at an intersection with MD 309 (Cordova Road) near Queen Anne, Talbot County, where it heads east on two-lane undivided Millsboro Denton Road. West of MD 309, Old Queen Anne Road continues west to MD 404. MD 404 Alt. passes through woodland, crossing under an abandoned railroad grade owned by the Maryland Department of Transportation before coming to MD 303 (Lewistown Road). At this point, the route turns north to form a concurrency with MD 303 along Talbot Avenue, and the two routes enter Queen Anne as it turns to the east. MD 303 splits from MD 404 Alternate by turning north on Main Street, while MD 404 Alt. continues east past homes, intersecting MD 518 (First Street). As the road runs a short distance to the south of the Tuckahoe Creek, there is an industrial building on the south side of the road. Upon crossing the Tuckahoe Creek, MD 404 Alt. enters Hillsboro in Caroline County and becomes Hillsboro Road. The route continues through residential areas of the town. Upon leaving Hillsboro, the road heads into agricultural areas with a few homes and a patch of woods. MD 404 Alt. ends at an intersection with MD 404 east of Hillsboro.

The route runs along the former alignment of MD 404 that was bypassed by the divided, four-lane Denton Bypass. MD 404 Bus. branches off from MD 404 west of Denton by heading southeast on a two-lane divided road called Meeting House Road that soon becomes undivided as it passes through farmland with some businesses. As it comes to MD 328 (New Bridge Road) in West Denton, the route passes near residences. The road crosses the Choptank River into Denton, where it becomes Franklin Street. Shortly after the river, MD 404 Bus. splits into a one-way pair that follows Franklin Street eastbound and Gay Street westbound, with Market Street running between Franklin and Gay streets. The one-way pair, which has two lanes in each direction, carries the route through the residential and commercial downtown of Denton, with the westbound direction passing north of the Caroline County Courthouse. East of the downtown area, the one-way pair intersects MD 619 (Sixth Street). In the eastern part of Denton, the two directions of MD 404 Bus. turn south and join again, becoming a four-lane divided highway with the Franklin Street name that runs through woodland. MD 404 Bus. ends at MD 313 and MD 404 a short distance later.

It is an homage to Toei's popular Super Sentai series (better known elsewhere in the west as the adaptation Power Rangers.), which was extremely popular in France in the 1980s and the 1990s. As a nod to Super Sentai titles having certain motifs, France Five has each member themed after certain aspects of French culture. There have been four half-hour episodes of France Five produced. The fifth episode aired on May 5, 2012 during a projection in Paris, and will premiere in June for Japan and the French television, Nolife, created by the creators of France Five. The episode includes a preview of the sixth and final episode. This series is said to be a nod to another Sentai pastiche, Aikoku Sentai Dai-Nippon (Patriot Squadron Great Japan) (1982) by Daicon Films (now Gainax). The series has become somewhat popular in Japan as well, with singer Akira Kushida singing an original theme for the series starting with episode 4. Prior to that point, the themes were French remixes of older Sentai theme songs (Choujin Sentai Jetman and Choudenshi Bioman) as well as an original French theme. Story Glou Man Chou, ruler of the Lexos Empire, desires to conquer planet Earth. However, the Eiffel Tower generates a barrier around the planet that keeps him from sending his armies en masse. Glou Man Chou sends his warriors and monsters to Earth in order to destroy the tower and enable a full-scale invasion, but they are opposed by France Five. In the fourth episode, the shield is disabled and Lexos's army is shown prepared to invade the planet. Professor Burgone is captured and France Five go in hiding. In episode 5, France Five reappear to battle Lexos, but they are overpowered by Zakaral and his generals. After being freed from captivity by France Five and his robot assistant Margarine, Professor Burgonde initiates a top-secret program in France Five's system as a last-ditch effort to save them.

A correspondent of both Bede and Boniface, it was Nothhelm who gathered materials from Canterbury for Bede's historical works. After his appointment to the archbishopric in 735, he attended to ecclesiastical matters, including holding church councils. Although later antiquaries felt that Nothhelm was the author of a number of works, later research has shown them to be authored by others. After his death he was considered a saint. Early life Nothhelm was a contemporary of Boniface and Bede, whom he supplied with correspondence from the papal library following a trip to Rome.Hindley Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons p. 93 He also researched the history of Kent and the surrounding area for Bede, supplying the information through the abbot of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury.Keynes \\"Nothhelm\\" Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England Before his appointment to the archbishopric, he was the archpriest of the Saxon-built St Paul's Cathedral, London.Yorke Kings and Kingdoms p. 31 Archbishop Named to the see of Canterbury in 735, Nothhelm was consecrated the same year.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 214 Pope Gregory III sent him a pallium in 736. He may have been appointed by √Üthelbald, King of Mercia, whose councilor he was. Whether or not he owed his appointment to √Üthelbald, Nothhelm was one of a number of Mercians who became Archbishop of Canterbury during the 730s and 740s, during a time of expanding Mercian influence.Williams Kingship and Government p. 24 He held a synod in 736 or 737, which drew nine bishops; the meeting adjudicated a dispute over the ownership of a monastery located at Withington.Cubitt Anglo-Saxon Church Councils p. 18 A significant feature of this synod was the fact that no king attended, but yet the synod still rendered judgement in the ownership even without secular oversight, which was more usual.Cubitt Anglo-Saxon Church Councils p. 56 Nothhelm oversaw the reorganisation of the Mercian dioceses which took place in 737. The archbishop consecrated Witta as Bishop of Lichfield and Totta as Bishop of Leicester. The diocese of Leicester was firmly established by this action,Blair Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England p. 169 although earlier attempts had been made to establish a bishopric there.Blair Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England p. 136 In 738, Nothhelm was a witness on the charter of Eadberht I, the King of Kent. Bede addressed his work In regum librum XXX quaestiones to Nothhelm, who had asked the thirty questions on the biblical book of Kings that Bede answered.Hunt and Mayr- Harting \\"Nothhelm\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Bede's work De VIII Quaestionibus may have been written for Nothhelm. While he was archbishop, Boniface wrote to him, requesting a copy of the Libellus responsionum of Pope Gregory I for use in Boniface's missionary efforts.Brooks Early History of the Church of Canterbury pp. 83‚Äì84 Boniface also asked for information on when the Gregorian mission to England arrived in England. This text of the Libellus responsionum has been the subject of some controversy, with the historian Suso Brechter arguing that the text was a forgery created by Nothhelm and a Roman archdeacon. The historian Paul Meyvaert has refuted this view, and most historians incline towards the belief that the text is genuine, although it is not considered conclusively proven. Death and legacy Nothhelm died on 17 October 739 and was buried in Canterbury Cathedral. He is considered a saint, and his feast day is 17 October.Walsh New Dictionary of Saints p. 453 The antiquaries and writers John Leland, John Bale, and Thomas Tanner all felt that Nothhelm was the author of various works, but later research has shown them to be authored by other writers. A verse eulogy for Nothhelm, of uncertain date, survives in a 16th-century manuscript now at the Lambeth Palace library.

Mertz Glacier on the George V Coast in East Antarctica is named after him. While a student, Mertz became active as a skier, competing in national competitions, and as a mountaineer, climbing many of the highest peaks in the Alps. In early 1911, Mertz was hired by geologist and explorer Douglas Mawson for his Antarctic expedition. He was initially employed as a ski instructor, but in Antarctica, Mertz instead joined Belgrave Edward Ninnis in the care of the expedition's Greenland huskies. In the summer of 1912‚Äì1913, Mertz and Ninnis were chosen by Mawson to accompany him on the Far Eastern Party, using the dogs to push rapidly from the expedition's base in Ad√©lie Land towards Victoria Land. After Ninnis and a sledge carrying most of the food disappeared down a crevasse, from the expedition's main hut, Mertz and Mawson headed back west, gradually using the dogs to supplement their remaining food stocks. About from safety, Mertz died, leaving Mawson to carry on alone. The cause of Mertz's death has never been firmly established; the commonly purported theory is hypervitaminosis A‚Äîan excessive intake of vitamin A‚Äîfrom consuming the livers of the Huskies. Other theories suggest he may have died from a combination of malnutrition, cold exposure, and psychological stresses.  Early life  Xavier Mertz was born in Basel, the son of Emile Mertz, who owned a large engineering firm in the city. With the aim of working in the family business, which manufactured textile machinery, Mertz attended the University of Bern, where he studied patent law. While in Bern, he became active as a mountaineer and skier. Mertz competed in several national competitions; in 1906 he was third in the Swiss cross-country skiing championship, and second in the German championship. In 1908, he won the Swiss ski jumping championship, with a distance of . As a mountaineer, he was particularly prolific in the Alps; he climbed Mont Blanc‚Äîthe highest peak in the range‚Äîand claimed several first ascents of other mountains. After he attained his degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of Bern, Mertz studied science at the University of Lausanne; he specialised in glacier and mountain formations, for which he received his second doctorate.  Australasian Antarctic expedition  Mertz exploring ice ravines near Cape Denison In early 1911, Mertz went to London to meet with the Australian geologist and explorer Douglas Mawson. Mawson, who had served as physicist during Ernest Shackleton's 1908‚Äì1909 Nimrod expedition, was planning his own Antarctic expedition. In his application letter, Mertz wrote that he hoped Mawson would be using skis, as \\"they have proved so good for the purpose & knowing that I am as good as any one on skys.\\" While Mawson was intending to recruit only British subjects (chiefly Australians and New Zealanders), Mertz's qualifications prompted him to make an exception, and hire the Swiss as a ski instructor. First, however, he was given responsibility for the expedition's 48 dogs, aboard the expedition ship , bound for Hobart. On the Aurora, Mertz met Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis, a lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers. Like Mertz, Ninnis was responsible for the expedition's dogs; Auroras captain, John King Davis, regarded the pair as \\"idlers\\". \\"I wish we had some one on board who could look after [the dogs],\\" he wrote in his diary, \\"it is a great shame that they should suffer from neglect.\\" On 2 December 1911, after final preparations and loading were completed in Hobart, the Aurora sailed south; she stopped briefly at Macquarie Island, where a wireless relay base was established, and reached the site of the expedition's main base at Cape Denison in Ad√©lie Land, on the Antarctic continent, in early January. = Ad√©lie Land = Over the following winter, preparations were made for the summer sledging. Because the conditions‚Äîconstant, strong winds and an excessive slope by the hut‚Äîprevented Mertz from conducting skiing lessons as regularly as intended, he focussed instead on helping Ninnis to care for the dogs. On days when the weather was good they drove the dogs around outside the hut, teaching them to run in teams; when the winds returned the pair fitted and sewed harnesses for each dog, and prepared their sledging food. By this time Mertz and Ninnis developed a close friendship, as the expedition's taxidermist Charles Laseron later wrote: Mertz on the ice cliff near the base In August, the preparations extended to laying depots; an early party established a depot to the south of the expedition's main hut‚Äîa grotto in the ice known as Aladdin's Cave‚Äîbut returned without the dogs. Mertz and two others set off to rescue the dogs, but in heavy winds covered less than a mile in two hours, and returned to the hut. \\"If it depended only on me,\\" Mertz wrote in his diary, after four days' more wind confined them to the hut, \\"we would be in our sleeping bags outside in the snow, and we would at least try to find the dogs. Mawson is definitely too cautious, and I wonder if he would show enough gumption during the sledging expedition.\\" The following day Mertz was part of a party of three that made it to Aladdin's Cave to rescue the dogs; when strong winds confined them to the depot for three days they spent the time expanding the cave. In September, Mertz, Ninnis, and Herbert Murphy formed a survey party, man-hauling to the south-east of Aladdin's cave. In strong winds, they travelled just in three days, before the temperature dropped to and the wind speed increased to , confining them to the tent. When a gap in the wind allowed, they hurried back to the hut. = Far Eastern Party = Last photograph taken of the Far Eastern Party On 27 October 1912, Mawson outlined the summer sledging program. Mertz and Ninnis were assigned to Mawson's own party, which would use the dogs to push quickly to the east of the expedition's base in Commonwealth Bay, towards Victoria Land. The party departed Cape Denison on 10 November, heading first to Aladdin's Cave, and from there south-east towards a massive glacier encountered by Aurora on the outward journey. Mertz skied ahead, scouting and providing a lead for the dogs to chase; Mawson and Ninnis manoeuvred the two dog teams behind. They reached the glacier on 19 November; negotiating fields of crevasses, it was crossed in five days. The party made quick progress once on the plateau again, but they soon encountered another glacier, far larger than the first. Despite strong winds and poor light, Mertz, Mawson and Ninnis reached the far side on 30 November. On 14 December, the party were more than from the Cape Denison hut. As Mertz skied ahead, singing songs from his student days, Ninnis, the largest sledge and the strongest dog team were lost when they broke through the snow lid of a crevasse. Together with the death of their companion, Mawson and Mertz were now severely compromised; on the remaining sledge they had just ten days' worth of food, and no food for the dogs. They immediately turned back west, gradually using the six remaining dogs to supplement their food supply; they ate all parts of the animals, including their livers. They initially made good progress, but as they cleared the largest glacier Mertz began to feel ill; he had lost his waterproof overpants on Ninnis' sledge, and in the cold his wet clothes were unable to dry. On 30 December, a day Mawson recorded that the companion was \\"off colour\\", Mertz wrote that he was \\"really tired [and] shall write no more.\\" Mertz's condition deteriorated over the following days‚ÄîMawson recorded he was \\"generally in a very bad condition. Skin coming off legs, etc\\"‚Äîand his illness severely slowed their progress. On 8 January, the pair about from the hut, Mawson recorded: Mawson buried Mertz in his sleeping bag under rough-hewn blocks of snow, along with the remaining photographic plates and an explanatory note. Mawson staggered back into the Cape Denison hut a month later, missing the Aurora by a matter of hours; she had waited for Mertz, Mawson and Ninnis for three weeks until‚Äîconcerned by the encroaching winter ice‚ÄîDavis had sailed her out of Commonwealth Bay and back to Australia.  Legacy  Memorial cross erected at Cape Denison In November 1913, a month before the Aurora returned for the final time, Mawson and the six men remaining at Cape Denison erected a memorial cross for Mertz and Ninnis on Azimuth Hill to the north-west of the main hut. The cross, constructed from pieces of a broken radio mast, was accompanied by a plaque cut from wood from Mertz's bunk. The cross still stands, although the crossbar has required reattaching several times, and the plaque was replaced with a replica in 1986. The first glacier the Far Eastern Party crossed on the outward journey‚Äîpreviously unnamed‚Äîwas named by Mawson after Mertz, becoming the Mertz Glacier. At a speaking engagement upon his return to Australia, Mawson praised his dead comrades: \\"The survivors might have an opportunity of doing something more, but these men had done their all.\\" At another, Mawson said that \\"Dr. Mertz was a Swiss by birth, but he was a man every Englishman would have liked to have called an Englishman ... He was a man of great feelings, generous‚Äîone of Nature's gentlemen.\\" A telegram was sent on behalf of the Australian people to Emile Mertz, condoling him on his \\"great loss, but congratulating you on your son's imperishable fame.\\" The cause of Mertz's death is not certain; at the time, it was believed Mertz may have died of colitis. A 1969 study by Sir John Cleland and Ronald Vernon Southcott, of the University of Adelaide, concluded that the symptoms Mawson described‚Äîhair, skin and weight loss, depression, dysentery and persistent skin infections‚Äîindicated the men had suffered hypervitaminosis A, an excessive intake of vitamin A. Vitamin A is found in unusually high quantities in the livers of Greenland huskies, of which both Mertz and Mawson consumed large amounts; indeed, as Mertz's condition deteriorated, Mawson may have given him more of the liver to eat, believing it to be more easily digested. This theory is the most widely accepted, but there have been other theories. Phillip Law, former director of Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions, believed cold exposure could account for Mertz's symptoms. A 2005 article in The Medical Journal of Australia by Denise Carrington-Smith, noting certain sources indicating that Mertz was essentially a vegetarian, suggested that general malnutrition and the sudden change to a predominantly meat diet could have triggered Mertz's illness. Carrington-Smith adds a more hypothetical reason: \\"the psychological stresses related to the death of a close friend [Ninnis] and the deaths of the dogs he had cared for, as well as the need to kill and eat his remaining dogs\\".

Fundraising went slowly until in 1954, St. John's City Council floated a bond to finance the facility, which then became property of the city. It officially opened in 1955. It is the former home of the St. John's Maple Leafs of the American Hockey League (1991‚Äì2001). The stadium played host to many events, such as an exhibition game featuring the local senior hockey team, the St. John's Caps and the Soviet Red Army. It also played host to two NBA exhibition games and musical acts, as well as Pope John Paul II. Wooden bleachers were used throughout the building's earlier life, and plastic seats were installed later, towards the beginning of the stadium's AHL tenure. Memorial Stadium closed in 2001, replaced by Mile One Centre. Dominion Memorial Market The interior structure of the building was later torn down, and in July 2006, after much controversy, construction started on a new Dominion supermarket. Coincidentally, the parent company of Dominion in Newfoundland, Loblaw Companies, converted part of Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, the former stadium of the Maple Leafs' parent club, to a Loblaws supermarket; both projects were approved despite grassroots protests. On September 21, 2007 Mayor Andy Wells cut the ribbon opening Dominion Memorial Market. The converted stadium is unlike any other supermarket in Atlantic Canada. Some features include underground parking, escalators, and shopping cart conveyors. The store also retains the scoreboard from the stadium's days as a hockey arena.

The Yankees took the series 3‚Äì2, and defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1977 World Series to take the title. Kansas City was given home-field advantage as it rotated back to the West Division; the Royals held a 102‚Äì60 record to the Yankees' 100‚Äì62 record. History This was the second straight year in which the Royals and the Yankees squared off in the ALCS. The year before in the 1976 ALCS, the Yankees took the series in five games on a Chris Chambliss home run in the ninth inning of Game 5. This series, they would again win it in their last at bat. Overview Each game of the series was dominated by, mostly, hitting. However, the pitchers of each team held their own and it made for some exciting games. The first game's matchup was Paul Splittorff (16‚Äì6) versus Don Gullett (14‚Äì4). Although the matchup seemed to not exactly be the classic Game 1 pitcher's duel, these two pitchers were the best of their profession for that season, although Gullett's was plagued with some shoulder injuries. SummaryKansas City Royals vs. New York Yankees=Game summariesGame 1= The visiting Royals jumped on the sore-shouldered Don Gullett early and never looked back. Hal McRae hit a two- run home run in the first and Freddie Patek had a two-run double in the second. John Mayberry hit a two-run home run off of Dick Tidrow in the third. Thurman Munson provided the Yankee runs in the third with a two-run home run of his own, but that was the only blemish on a pitching gem by Paul Splittorff. Splittorff went eight strong innings and Doug Bird closed it in the ninth. Al Cowens added a home run for the Royals in the eighth off of Tidrow. =Game 2= The Royals had hopes of putting the Yankees down 2‚Äì0 going back to KC, and for a while that appeared possible. Beating new-found Yankees' ace Ron Guidry would be a tough task. The Royals scraped a run in the third when Freddie Patek drove in Darrell Porter with a sacrifice fly. Royals' starter Andy Hassler had a shutout going for four innings, but Cliff Johnson broke the drought with a home run in the fifth. The Yankees took a 2‚Äì1 lead in the same inning when Willie Randolph singled, Hassler balked him to second, and Bucky Dent drove him home with a single. Hard base-running helped the Royals tie it in the sixth.inning Patek led off with a double and Hal McRae walked. The next batter, George Brett, grounded to Graig Nettles, who threw to Randolph at second to force McRae. McRae, however, barreled into Randolph with a body-block, breaking up the double play attempt and enabling Patek to score the tying run. McRae's aggressive ploy seemed to ignite the Yankees in their half of the sixth. Thurman Munson singled with one out off of Hassler, then Lou Piniella singled with two outs off of Mark Littell. Johnson doubled in a run and after an intentional walk, an error by Brett on a Randolph grounder allowed two more runs to score to make it 5‚Äì2. Randolph also had an RBI single in the eighth off of Little. Meanwhile, Guidry stymied the Royals, pitching a complete game and allowing the Royals only three hits and the two runs. =Game 3= At Kauffman Stadium, Dennis Leonard pitched a four-hit complete game to give the Royals a 2‚Äì1 series lead. After a one-out walk and single, Freddie Patek's RBI single off of Mike Torrez in the second put the Royas up 1‚Äì0. Next inning, Al Cowens's groundout with runners on second and third and no outs made it 2‚Äì0 Royals. The Yankees got on the board in the fifth when Graig Nettles singled with two outs and scored on Lou Pinella's double, but the Royals got that run back in the bottom of the inning when Hal McRae hit a leadoff double, moved to third on a groundout, and scored on Cowens's groundout. Next inning, Torrez allowed a leadoff walk and single, then got two outs before being relieved by Sparky Lyle, who allowed a two-run double to Amos Otis. Next inning, George Brett hit a leadoff single and scored on John Mayberry's RBI double. The Yankees got a run in the ninth when Roy White doubled with one out and scored on first baseman Mayberry's error on Reggie Jackson's ground ball before Chris Chambliss grounded out to end the game. =Game 4= This game was a barn-burner early on, with the Yankees precariously clinging to the upper hand. New York jumped out to an early 4‚Äì0 lead after innings on RBIs by Thurman Munson, Bucky Dent, Mickey Rivers, and Lou Piniella. The Royals clawed back in the home half of the third when Freddie Patek, having a fine series for himself, tripled and scored on a short fly ball hit by Frank White, barely beating Reggie Jackson's throw to the plate. George Brett tripled in a run in the same inning. After Graig Nettles singled in a run in the fourth to make it 5‚Äì2, the Royals got two more in their half. With two outs, Patek doubled in a run, chasing Yankee starter Ed Figueroa. White doubled in Patek and Hal McRae drew a walk off reliever Dick Tidrow. At this point, Yankee manager Billy Martin made a gutsy move, bringing in his ace closer and AL Cy Young Award winner, Sparky Lyle. Lyle was rarely used this early in a game, but Martin figured he was fresh, having only pitched one inning the whole series and, in Martin's own words, \\"I wanted my best pitcher out there.\\" But, the move paid off. Lyle shut the Royals down for the remaining innings, allowing only two hits and no runners past second base. The Yankees added insurance in the ninth on a Munson sacrifice fly. =Game 5= In order for the Yankees to advance to their second straight World Series, they would have to win again at the Royals' home park. To do that, they would have to beat their Game 1 nemesis, Paul Splittorff. Given that, Yankee manager Billy Martin decided to sit out Reggie Jackson on the grounds that he was 1-for-15 so far in the series and, in his own words, \\"can't hit Splittorff.\\" Paul Blair started in right field and batted eighth. The Royals struck for a pair in the first when Hal McRae singled and George Brett tripled him in. Brett slid hard into Graig Nettles at third and Nettles responded by kicking Brett, which started a bench-clearing brawl. Yankees' starting pitcher Ron Guidry rushed in to defend Nettles. After order was restored, Al Cowens drove in Brett with a groundout. The Yankees crept back in the third on a Thurman Munson RBI single, but the Royals matched that in the bottom half on a double by McRae and RBI single by Cowens with one out. Martin then pulled Guidry, who had gotten hurt in the first-inning brawl. Mike Torrez came in and pitched shutout ball over the next innings. The Yankees began to claw back in the eighth. Right-hander Doug Bird relieved Splittorff after Willie Randolph led off the inning with a single. With one out, Piniella singled Randolph to third. With the \\"unhittable\\" Splittorff out of the game, Martin decided to send Jackson to the plate to hit for Cliff Johnson. Jackson put aside all frustrations over not starting the game and came through with a pinch-hit RBI single to cut the Royal lead to 3‚Äì2. The Royals mounted a threat in their half of the eighth. Torrez walked both Amos Otis and Pete LaCock with two outs, but relief ace Sparky Lyle came in and struck out Cookie Rojas, the Royals' DH playing in what would be his last major-league game. With apparently very little confidence in regular closer Mark Littell, who struggled in 1977, Royals manager Whitey Herzog sent Game 3 stopper Dennis Leonard out to preserve the lead in the ninth. Leonard, unaccustomed to short relief, yielded a bloop single to Paul Blair and walked Roy White (pinch hitting for Bucky Dent) with no outs. Herzog, going with percentages, replaced Leonard with another normal starter, left-hander Larry Gura. The strategy backfired as Gura gave up a game-tying RBI single to Mickey Rivers, with White reaching third. Herzog then brought in Littell, who retired Willie Randolph on a deep drive to center as White tagged and scored the go-ahead run. Munson was retired, but Piniella hit a grounder to third that Brett threw away at first, scoring Rivers with the final run. Lyle then retired the Royals in the ninth, the final outs coming when Freddie Patek hit into a double play. As the Yankees celebrated, Patek sat in the dugout, dejected, for several minutes. (Coincidentally, it was Patek's 33rd birthday that day.)

The screenplay began as an adaptation of Golden Girl: The Story of Jessica Savitch, a 1988 book by Alanna Nash that recounted the troubled life of American news anchor Jessica Savitch. The finished picture, however, was greatly altered by commercial decisions on the part of the producers, and bore little resemblance to Savitch's biography. Screenwriter John Gregory Dunne, having spent eight years working on the script with his wife Joan Didion, later wrote a book describing his difficult experience, titled Monster: Living Off the Big Screen. The film was nominated for an Oscar in the category of Best Original Song for \\"Because You Loved Me\\", written by Diane Warren and performed by Celine Dion. Plot Sally \\"Tally\\" Atwater (Michelle Pfeiffer) is an ambitious, aspiring news reporter, who is hired by Miami local news director Warren Justice (Robert Redford) when she sends in a homemade audition tape. He carefully guides her career to new heights, all the while becoming increasingly attracted to her. Tally soon rises through the ranks of network news to become successful, while Warren's once-stellar career sinks into mediocrity. Furthermore, Tally's ascension takes her away from Warren when she is forced to relocate to Philadelphia. Tally struggles at her new post, in no small part due to the hostility of veteran reporter Marcia McGrath (Stockard Channing), who jealously protects her position as the top reporter. Warren turns up to inspire Tally, and the two partners begin a new career together. However, on a routine assignment in a Philadelphia prison, Tally and her cameraman are taken hostage in a prison riot and forced to endure hours of intense violence. Tally covers the groundbreaking story from within the walls of the collapsing prison as Warren looks on from outside, guiding her through her first national broadcast. This incredible act of bravery leads to Tally's eagerly anticipated advancement to a national network newscaster position and the continuation of the dynamic duo's rise to fame - but shortly after, disaster strikes when Warren is killed during an assignment. CastAdaptation In the spring of 1988, John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion began writing the script for a film entitled Golden Girl, based on Alanna Nash's biography of the late NBC News anchor and reporter Jessica Savitch and financed by The Walt Disney Company. When the film was finally released in 1996, eight years later, it was known as Up Close & Personal and none of the more controversial details of Savitch's life remained, including her alleged drug abuse problems that may have caused her to deliver an incoherent live news update on national television in early October 1983. Other details omitted from the film included the suicide of Savitch's second husband a few months after their wedding, and her alleged bisexuality, suicide attempts, abortion, and physical abuse by her longtime partner Ron Kershaw, a well-known news director who was the original model for the character of Warren Justice. Savitch's death at age 36 in an automobile accident (unrelated to drugs or alcohol) was also left out of the screenplay. According to Dunne, who chronicled his experiences dealing with studio executives in his book Monster: Living Off the Big Screen, the majority of these changes were made in order to appeal to a broader mainstream market. Producer Scott Rudin was reported to have said, when asked by a weary Dunne what the film was supposed to be, \\"it's about two movie stars.\\" Reception The film currently holds an approval rating of 31% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The site's consensus states: \\"Up Close & Personal wastes its superstar leads and compelling fact-inspired story on a treacly romance bereft of onscreen chemistry.\\" Critics largely ridiculed the screenplay for bearing little resemblance to the biography of Jessica Savitch, which was supposed to have inspired it. Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times wrote: \\"Up Close and Personal is so different from the facts of Savitch's life that if Didion and Dunne still have their first draft, they probably could sell it as a completely different movie.\\" Anita Gates in the New York Times wrote that \\"it all ends up more A Star Is Born than Network.\\" Leonard Klady in Variety described it as \\"A Star Is Born meets The Way We Were, and while discerning audiences will turn their noses up, the hoi polloi are apt to embrace this unabashedly sentimental affair and send it soaring into the box office stratosphere.\\" Desson Howe in The Washington Post was extremely negative about the film: \\"Up Close and Personal, which was \\"suggested\\" by the Jessica Savitch biography, Golden Girl: The Story of Jessica Savitch, starts out with relative promise... but then, the loooove comes through like a bad-news feed, and our marquee lovers undergo one of those unbearable montages. While an insipid, rock ballad covers the proceedings with auditory treacle, Cushion Lips (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Armchair Man (Robert Redford) walk together, laugh together, frolic in the waves with their clothes on ‚Äì that sort of thing.... In this movie, network executives ‚Äì who depend entirely on focus groups, marketing and advertisers to inform their decisions ‚Äì are painted as the moral bad guys, while Redford and the emerging Pfeiffer are the embodiment of integrity... And the fact that this is a Touchstone Pictures production ‚Äì part of the marketing-obsessed, truth-sweetening Disney empire which just purchased ABC ‚Äì is far too hilarious an irony to ignore.\\" Time Out called it a \\"soppy May‚ÄìDecember romance masquerading as a deadly earnest issues movie... Blow-dried, bleached blonde- on-bland entertainment.\\" However, certain critics argued that the film had its merits. Mick LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: \\"Taken on its own terms, Up Close and Personal is a fine movie. Two star images meet and enhance each other. Redford, as usual, plays a rugged, outdoorsy, uncompromising man of unshakable integrity who just happens to be news director at a Miami station. Pfeiffer, as usual, is gorgeous, pretty, gawky and a lot tougher and smarter than she looks.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, arguing that the \\"temptations are great to mock the clich√©s and melodrama in Up Close and Personal, but the movie undeniably works as what it really is - a love story.\\" Variety praised the \\"chemistry\\" of Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert Redford, and the \\"delicious and brief star turns\\" of Stockard Channing, Kate Nelligan and Noble Willingham, concluding that the film wasn't \\"as accomplished as its inspiration but, regrettably, it's the best Hollywood has to offer in the heartstring-pulling genre.\\" Awards and honors The featured song, \\"Because You Loved Me\\", written by Diane Warren and performed by Celine Dion, won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture or Television, and was nominated for the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. Stockard Channing won a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Supporting Actress - Romance.

Biography According to information he provided to his masonic lodge in New Orleans, he was born in Cette (now S√®te) in Languedoc, France.Tableau of La Concorde No. 3 Lodge, New Orleans, Grand Lodge of Louisiana (1815). (Contrary to the spurious Diary of Jean Laffite, he was not the older brother of Pierre and Jean Laffite.) You may have joined the army of Revolutionary France as an artillerist. He served in the French Republic's artillery corp. In 1802 he accompanied General Charles Leclerc to Saint-Domingue to quell Toussaint Louverture's slave revolt. Yellow fever took the lives of many of the French soldiers including General Leclerc. Afterwards, Dominique You went to New Orleans where he joined Jean Lafitte and Pierre Lafitte and became the captain of the French corsair Le Pandoure. He was nicknamed \\"Captain Dominique\\" by the French and \\"Johnness\\" by the Americans. He acquired a reputation for being very bold and daring. During the next few years he and the Lafitte brothers became successful smugglers in the Louisiana bayous. As privateers, they preyed on Spanish ships in the Gulf of Mexico, doing extensive damage to Spanish commerce. On one occasion, a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico caused severe damage to the Pandoure and almost killed Captain You. In July 1814, Dominique You was falsely convicted of piracy in the Gulf, but the Americans failed to capture him. He was in the camp at Barataria when it was raided by American forces that year; he was captured and imprisoned along with other Baratarians. Jean Lafitte offered to help General Andrew Jackson defend New Orleans against the impending British invasion, in exchange for his crew and a pardon; and You was released. He was appointed commander of a company of artillery, which was composed of the Baratarians' best gunners. His men fought with such courage and effectiveness in the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815, that they were mentioned in Major General Andrew Jackson's general order of January 21 as \\"having shown uncommon gallantry and skill in the field.\\" As a result of this success, all charges against the Baratarians and Dominique You were dropped. After the battle, You settled quietly in New Orleans where he became a politician and supporter of Andrew Jackson. You died in New Orleans in 1830. He was given a military funeral, paid for by the public.

The band, which formed in 1997, made a name for themselves on the Midwest club circuit and began sharing gigs with an up-and-coming Umphrey's McGee. The original group featured bassist/vocalist Karl Engelmann, guitarist/vocalist Jake Cinninger, and drummer Steve Krojniewski. They released their debut album Hopi Champa in 1999. The album has become a sought-after collectors item since going out of print in 2002. Engelmann left the band in 1999 and was replaced by Kahlil Smylie for the album Limbo Boots. The departure of Engelmann, one of the band's main songwriters and singers, was a drastic change for the band. A few months later, Cinninger disbanded Ali Baba's Tahini to join Umphrey's McGee, where he remains to this day. Three years later in 2003, a four-man Ali Baba's Tahini (with Smylie on bass and Engelmann on guitar) reunited for a one-off performance in Niles, Michigan. The following year, the original lineup of the band (Engelmann/Cinninger/Krojniewski) reunited in the North Carolina mountains to record the album Rockstars and Lawnmowers. Engelmann fronted Asheville-based rock band Mother Vinegar from 2004‚Äì2007, who, along with Umphrey's McGee, performed a number of Ali Baba's Tahini songs in concert. The band recorded Rockstars and Lawnmowers with former Mother Vinegar bassist Jeff Hinkle. Ali Baba's Tahini has been hard at work on their new release, slated for Spring '09, which will feature new member and songwriter, Justin W. Powell (The Mantras) on keyboards. A mini-tour through the midwest followed shortly after the release of Living Room. ABT also did a one off appearance at Summercamp Music Festival to a crowd of over 4000 in 2011.

Grade was born in Vilnius, Lithuania (at the time occupied by the Russian Empire) and died in The Bronx, New York. He is buried in Riverside Cemetery, Saddle Brook, New Jersey. Grade was raised Orthodox-leaning, and he studied in yeshiva as a teenager, but ended up with a secular outlook, in part due to his poetic ambitions. Losing his family in the Holocaust, he resettled in New York, and increasingly took to fiction, writing in Yiddish. Initially he was reluctant to have his work translated.Grade found most translators did not understand Orthodoxy and Orthodox use of Yiddish. He was praised by Elie Wiesel as \\"one of the great--if not the greatest--of living Yiddish novelists.\\" In 1970 he won the Itzik Manger Prize for contributions to Yiddish letters. Article translated at Life Chaim Grade, the son of Shlomo Mordecai Grade, a Hebrew teacher and maskil (advocate of the Haskalah, the European Jewish Enlightenment), received a secular as well as Jewish religious education. He studied for several years with Reb Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz, the Chazon Ish (1878‚Äì1953), one of observant Judaism's great Torah scholars. In 1932, Grade began publishing stories and poems in Yiddish, and in the early 1930s was among the founding members of the \\"Young Vilna\\" experimental group of artists and writers. He developed a reputation as one of the city's most articulate literary interpreters. He fled the German invasion of Vilnius in World War II and sought refuge in the Soviet Union. In the Holocaust he lost his wife Frumme-Liebe (daughter of the Rabbi of Glebokie) and his mother Vella Grade Rosenthal (daughter of Rabbi Rafael Blumenthal). When the war ended, he lived briefly in Poland and France before relocating to the United States in 1948. Grade's second wife, Inna (n√©e Hecker), translated a number of his books into English; she died in New York City on May 2, 2010. Berger, Joseph (May 12, 2010). \\"Inna H. Grade, Fierce Literary Guardian, Dies at 85\\". The New York Times. nytimes.com. Retrieved November 20, 2018. Works Grade's postwar poetry is primarily concerned with Jewish survival in the wake of the Holocaust. Grade's most highly acclaimed novels, The Agunah (1961, tr. 1974) and The Yeshiva (2 vol., 1967‚Äì68, tr. 1976‚Äì7), deal with the philosophical and ethical dilemmas of Jewish life in prewar Lithuania, particularly dwelling on the Novardok Mussar movement. These two works were translated from the original Yiddish into English by Curt Leviant. Grade's short story, \\"My Quarrel with Hersh Rasseyner,\\" describes the chance meeting of a Holocaust survivor with an old friend from the mussar Yeshiva. The narrator has lost his faith, while the friend has continued to lead a pious and devoted religious life. The former friends debate the place of religion in the postmodern world. The character Hersh Rasseyner is based on Gershon Liebman, a friend of Grade's from yeshiva who built Navardok yeshivas all over France. Grade recounted that he had a short conversation with Liebman, and created this story on what he imagined Liebman would say to him if he had the words. The story has been made into a film, The Quarrel, and a play.\\"The Play\\". The Quarrel: a play by David Brandes and Joseph Telushkin. thequarreltheplay.com. Retrieved November 20, 2018. While less famous than Isaac Bashevis Singer or Sholem Aleichem, Chaim Grade is considered among the foremost stylists in Yiddish. His work is now hard to find in English. Literary estate His papers were very numerous and consumed much space of the apartment he shared with his wife Inna in the Amalgamated Housing Cooperative in the Northwest Bronx. The public administrator of his papers, Bonnie Gould, made requests to several institutions, including Harvard University and the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research to assist in cataloging Grade's papers. By the end of August 2010, the papers had been transferred to YIVO's offices, for sorting.Berger, Joseph (August 31, 2010). \\"Researchers Start Job of Sorting Out Yiddish Writer‚Äôs Papers\\".

The book's art is by Chris Weston, and depicts retro technology in \\"British\\" style. The story is set in an alternate history where soldiers and operatives of the United Kingdom reached the German rocket installations at Peenem√ºnde ahead of the U.S. Army and the Soviets, and brought all the key personnel and technology to Britain, in a mirror of the real world's Operation Paperclip. Thus is created the Ministry of Space, whose mission is to develop British space technology and establish a firm foothold in space for Queen and Empire. Elements of social commentary are present throughout the book, as is typical of Ellis' work, while the drama of the story is found in the lives of the first pioneers of space exploration (as in The Right Stuff). This social commentary is disguised in a snippet of dialogue here and a background detail in the art elsewhere, relying upon the readers' own observations to bring it to light. Publication history Originally intended as a three-part monthly series, Ministry of Space was first released in May 2001. Delays prompted the release of issue #2 in September 2001 instead of June. The last issue finally saw print in April 2004, three years late. No specific reason has been given for the delays. In his afterword to the series, Ellis speaks of how Ministry of Space came to be, after he found in his attic a lost, forgotten copy of the Dan Dare comic The Man From Nowhere, science fiction comics from the 1950s.Ellis, W: \\"Ministry Of Space\\", 'The Afterword'. Titan Books, 2005 Plot The narrative moves back and forth between the last days of World War II, the first few years of the British space programme, and the year 2001. The British had captured and relocated to England all the scientists and equipment found in Peenem√ºnde, among them Dr. Wernher von Braun and the plans and pieces of the V-2 rocket bomb. Peenem√ºnde and American advance troops are then (intentionally) obliterated by friendly fire, so that they cannot challenge the emergent British technological advantage. The entire scheme is masterminded by Royal Air Force officer Air Commodore Sir John Dashwood, survivor of the Battle of Britain, who manages to convince Winston Churchill to establish the Ministry of Space and fund it with a black budget. The following years see British pilots: *Breaking the sound barrier (1946). *Launching the first artificial satellite in 1948, called Victory and radio- broad-casting \\"God save the King\\" in Morse Code. *Pioneering human spaceflight (1950), in a reinforced and pressurized cabin, in rocketplane named Britannia, wearing Leather jackets and sitting in a leather chair. John Dashwood becomes the first man in space. He loses his legs in the process, but receives a knighthood. *Building a space station (1953‚Äì56) named \\"Churchill Station\\". *In 1957 the National Service Act 1948 is not abolished, but now includes service in \\"The Royal Space Force\\". *Landing on the Moon (1957) and in 1960 finding water on the Moon. *Establishing a colonial base on Mars in 1969, with nuclear motors and 700 people. The story ends in 2001 and involves an American attempt to go into space, and their blackmailing of the British government concerning the secrets of the black budget that funded the Ministry of Space (which was derived from looting gold reserves from Jewish victims of the Nazi Holocaust). However, thanks to Dashwood's crimes, the British space programme has a manned spacecraft that has reached Saturn, thriving British Martian and lunar colonies, asteroid belt mines and at least three Earth orbital space stations providing the country with free solar energy. The unrepentant Dashwood dismisses the Ministry's outrage at its origins with the claim that England will not care about the truth when it has reaped such benefits from the programme. However, the price of progress is hinted at in a closing page that shows that the culturally static Empire practices segregationism; the black female pilot that flew Dashwood to one of the space stations for questioning is shown to be staying in \\"Non-White Woman\\" quarters. Collected editions The series has been collected into a single volume, in both softcover (March 2005, Image, , Titan, ) and hardcover editions (Image, March 2005, ).

It is depicted as an archetypal American suburban community, inhabited largely by white Americans and the middle class, as befitting the socioeconomic outlook of the United States at the time. According to the episode \\"Hey Hey What Can I Do,\\" Point Place's economy seems to be largely built around slaughtering (in fact, a later episode \\"Leaving Home Ain't Easy\\" reveals a roadway named \\"Slaughterhouse Way\\" because it leads to a slaughterhouse). Background Over the course of the series, Point Place is depicted as a population center gradually evolving from an industrial town into a growing suburban city during the economic downturn of the mid-to- late 1970s. During the period between 1976 and 1980, small, locally owned businesses are forced to close as aggressive chain stores move in and rust- belt factories are shut down due to the fall in consumer demand. Other closings include the auto parts manufacturing plant (where Red Forman was a supervisor), a local appliance and electronics store, Bargain Bob's (owned and operated by Bob Pinciotti), the local Foto Hut chain (owned by Leo), and the Forman & Son muffler and auto repair shop (itself built in a former local muffler business). In their stead, large chain stores such as Price Mart and Muffler Master (which purchased the Forman & Son business) moved in and opened. During the eighth and final season, in contravention to this trend, the William Barnett-owned music chain Grooves is sold and closed, with the sole remaining store becoming the privately owned business of Barnett‚Äôs son, Steven Hyde. The \\"FAQ\\" on the program's official website says, \\"Point Place is a fictional suburb of Green Bay, Wisconsin. This is why many Wisconsinites may recognize names of towns such as Kenosha. In reality, the location of Point Place has no basis in actual Wisconsin geography. There is an episode where the gang travels \\"down\\" to Kenosha to go to a movie.\\"That '70s Show, Frequently Asked Questions. This seemed to be directly contradicted by concrete information given in several episodes, such as the fact in one episode (\\"The Velvet Rope\\") it was possible to drive to Chicago, attend a party, and drive back in the course of a few hours; in another episode, Kelso explicitly states that Chicago is a two-hour drive from Point Place, consistent with the theory of a Kenosha-area location. Over the course of the series, many other local businesses and events were identified as being in or taking place in Kenosha (which is actually from Green Bay). The name Point Place was chosen for the town because co-creator Bonnie Turner is from Toledo, Ohio where there is a section of town called Point Place. Residences * Forman residence - The main setting for most of the series. The Forman house is not home just to Red, Kitty, Eric, and Laurie; most of the main cast members have stayed with the Formans at least once. Hyde was permanently taken in when his mother skipped town. Fez stays with them while Immigration Services conducts an investigation on him. Jackie secretly moves in with Hyde in the basement after her father is sent to prison and her mother is nowhere to be found. Donna spends the night with Eric on occasion and even Bob needed sanctuary once after being kicked out by Midge. Most scenes in the series were shot in the Forman's home, notably the basement, a favorite hangout spot and the locale for most of the \\"circle\\" scenes. Some of the most pivotal moments in Eric and Donna's relationship occur as they recline on the hood of the Vista Cruiser in the Forman driveway. * Pinciotti residence - The house next door to the Forman's and a frequent setting for episodes in the series, primarily those involving members of the Pinciotti household: Bob, Midge, and Donna. (There was also a younger sister, who was written out of the series). Eventually Bob and Midge break up but agree to continue living together even while dating other people, causing Donna much stress. In later seasons, Midge has run off, leaving Bob to stew over the depressing shambles of his former life. He starts dating again and eventually starts seeing Jackie's mom Pam, played by Brooke Shields. Midge returns unexpectedly and decides to shack up with Bob and Pam forming a triad type relationship * Burkhart residence - The house where Jackie lives until her father is carted off to prison. The planning committee for President Ford's visit is held here, as well as the \\"high class\\" party Jackie holds to test Kelso's fitness as a lifelong mate. Predictably, the evening ends in disaster at Kelso's hand, an incident that later leads to their breakup, along with Kelso's infidelity. * Fez's apartment - Fez's home after his marriage to Laurie fails and he has to find another place to live, (he also says his host parents, the Erdmans, found out he graduated high school). Initially he shares the place with Kelso. Red takes delight in messing up their apartment when they first move in. After Kelso moves to Chicago, Jackie moves in. Fenton (Jim Rash), being the landlord, lives below them. * Kelso residence - Though not seen as much as the above- mentioned residences, this is the house that Kelso, his brother Casey, (played by Luke Wilson), their parents, and five other siblings live. Donna and Eric both went there to confront Casey about his behavior. Eric also went there in need of a toilet (when he was unable to use either one at Donna's house or his house) but was rejected by Kelso for refusing to hold a party. Casey's bedroom is shown in Season 4, Ep 22, \\"Eric's Corvette Caper,\\" when Donna and Jackie snoop around in his room while he is gone and are met by Kelso sleeping in Casey's bed. * Hyde Residence - The run-down dwelling Hyde and his mother lived in before she skipped town. Dilapidated and messy, it is unknown if such conditions arose after Edna's departure, or if the house had always been in a state of disarray. * Erdman residence - The Erdman couple initially host Fez. They have a distaste for rock & roll music and the devil. In Season 1 Episode 8, Hyde refers to them as Ozzie and Harry. * Trailer Park - An unnamed, rustic trailer park where Donna and Eric would've lived following their wedding had it happened. Workplaces * Bargain Bob's - Bob's appliance store, apparently the only store open on Christmas Eve, which is seen during the first three seasons. Red briefly works there as well. When Price-Mart comes to Point Place, Bob can't compete with them and is forced to close the store. * Fotohut - The town's photo developing lab (based on Fotomat). It was located in a small shack in a grocery store parking lot. The business was run by town hippie Leo (Tommy Chong) with Hyde's assistance. Leo claims to own more of these huts but forgets where they are. When Leo disappears, Hyde, Kelso, Fez and Jackie discover that everything from the Fotohut has disappeared as well. * Grooves - The town's record store, opened in the late 1970s as part of the invasion of chain stores into Point Place's formerly locally owned business scene. It is owned by Hyde's biological father, William \\"W.B.\\" Barnett, who later sells the chain and gives Hyde the last remaining store in the final season. By the end of the series, it is run by Hyde with help from Randy and Leo. * Forman & Son muffler shop - Red's muffler shop, which he opened in the seventh season. The name of the store is ironic, in that Eric never worked there, though Red did offer both him and Hyde a job. The shop is ultimately closed down in the eighth season after Red sells it to a big muffler chain and retires. The store is apparently turned into a parking lot by the chain. * Price-Mart - A one-stop shopping center akin to Kmart, which both Red and Eric work at during the second through fifth seasons; Red as the manager and Eric as a stock boy. Eric is ultimately fired by Red after he announces he's engaged to Donna and Red leaves the store after suffering a heart attack at the end of the fifth season. * WFPP (\\"The Sound\\") - A small radio station specializing in 1970s hard rock. Donna works there for most of the series as an intern and later a full-time DJ. Her on-air nickname is \\"Hot Donna.\\" * Holiday Hotel - A hotel in Point Place where the high school job fair takes place. It is here that Hyde meets up with Roy Keene, his former \\"Big Brother,\\" and takes a job as a hotel kitchen worker under Roy's supervision. It is also here that Kelso gets involved with the Point Place Police Academy during the job fair and in the interim takes a job as a bus boy for the hotel. Eric is in need of cash to support his family and marry Donna and wins the title of waiter in a competition against Kelso. Nurses conventions and weddings are frequently held at the Holiday Hotel. Presumably based on Holiday Inn. * Dog food factory - An unnamed factory owned by Joanne, Bob's girlfriend after Midge left. Eric briefly worked here as a coupon liaison after Red fired him from Price-Mart, and was fired by Joanne after she broke up with Bob. * Point Place Shopping Mall - Houses many of Point Place's retail amenities such as The Cheese Palace, where Jackie takes her first job as cheese maiden. Halverson's department store is where Kelso gets an underwear modeling job. The jewelry store is where the character Fenton is introduced, and it is mentioned he worked at the lingerie store before that. There is also a bridal store where Jackie goes every week to try on wedding dresses. The mall is one of Jackie's favorite places to be so she can pretend she is a Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader and sign autographs for 6th graders. Midge thinks the mall is a great place to wear White Shoulders perfume. Based on the glory days of 1970s shopping malls. * All That Glitters - All That Glitters is the jewelry store where Eric buys an engagement ring from Fenton. (Season 5 Episode 15) * Point Place Public Access - A public access TV station serving Point Place, offering programs such as local news and presumably \\"What's up Wisconsin?\\" hosted by Christine St. George (Mary Tyler Moore). Jackie once had a show where she mostly talked about trends she considered cool and bashed people she hated and later served as an intern for \\"What's up Wisconsin?\\" There was also a belly- dancing show that Bob Pinciotti once co-hosted (much to Donna's horror). It is unknown if the station is the same as or related to news-hosting WZUZ, as seen in the eighth-season episode, \\"Fun It.\\" * Fatso Burger - An old fashioned burger joint that the gang likes to eat at. Eric's first job was here, though he left due to the demand for his time. The drive thru contains an iconic statue of the mascot Fatso the clown, which was once stolen by the gang and accidentally destroyed by Fez upon trying to return it. Bob impregnated Midge in the parking lot (apparently while she was drinking a milkshake). The manager of Fatso Burger was Ricky, portrayed by actor Danny Bonaduce. * Point Place Hospital - The town hospital where some of the major characters are sent when they are injured. Kelso is sent there after an allergic reaction to eggs (he drinks raw eggs to try and impress Jackie). It is also where most of the male characters go after falling off the water tower (though depending on the activity they may lie to their parents about it). Red is sent there after his heart attack at the end of season 5. Leo is sent there after a car accident in which Fez drives into some crates which fall on top of Leo. Kitty Forman, in the beginning of the series, works as a nurse there and later quits. She later returns and remains employed there throughout the rest of the series. Eric goes to work with her in the episode \\"Career Day.\\" * Jeri's Fresh Hair - The hair salon which employs Fez in Seasons 7 and 8. It is also Donna Pinciotti's hair salon. Jackie Burkhart also works here briefly. Hangouts * The Hub - Point Place's local teen hangout, a tiny short-order diner renowned amongst Point Place's youth for its French fries. While the pilot depicted it as being a toned-down version of a cowboy bar, subsequent episodes presented it as a 1950s-style soda fountain. Earlier episodes depicted it as containing a small pinball arcade primarily featuring the Williams pinball game \\"Travel Time.\\" The Hub also had fake wood paneling and what appears to be a large peace sign painted on the wall behind the jukebox, although as the series progressed and video games rose in popularity, the machines were removed and replaced by a Space Invaders cabinet and the Hub was painted, replacing the wood with a simple white wall. * The Water Tower - Point Place's signature landmark and a popular after-hours hangout spot for the town's youth, which has been repeatedly vandalized by the gang, including the painting of a pot leaf (although it looks more like a hand giving the finger), one testicle, and the tag \\"MICHAEL + JACKIE\\" (which was later repainted erroneously into \\"MICHAEL + FEZ\\"). A running gag involves someone‚Äîusually Kelso‚Äîfalling off the tower every time the characters climb it. Charlie Richardson is the only known person to have died from falling off the water tower (resulting in its rechristening as the Charlie Richardson Memorial Water Tower). Those from the gang who fall off it rarely end up in a hospital; most times they get away with scratches and bruises (to which Kelso once remarked \\"Screw that, I'm invincible!\\" after falling off the tower shortly after Charlie's death). The tower was also the site of Eric and Donna's engagement. It was also the site of Fez's and Jackie's first official kiss as a couple. In the final episode, Fez and Hyde trick Kelso into jumping off the tower one last time. * Mount Hump - A popular destination to have sex. Donna and Eric considered this spot for their wedding, making a scouting trip with Kelso's van, which they ultimately destroyed during so. The guys try to row a canoe down the mountain once. A nearby lake (where the gang has camped before) is reputedly filled with alligators, though this is mostly a myth cooked up by the cops for reasons unknown. Schools * Point Place High - The high school of the town. Every major character attended high school here. The team name is the Vikings. The gym is the town bomb shelter. Eric always has the best parking spot next to the exit. The high school resides at 2120 South Michigan Ave., Point Place, WI. The street address is an in-joke; 2120 South Michigan Avenue is the name of a 1964 instrumental by The Rolling Stones, itself based on the street address of the offices and recording studios of Chess Records and Checker Records, at 2120 South Michigan Avenue, Chicago. * Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow - An all-girls Catholic school established about 10 miles from Eric's house. Donna was sent here for her senior year as punishment for running off to California. * Old Maine - The elementary school most of the gang attended until it burned down. The gang returned here on Halloween one year to find their permanent records had survived the fire. * Point Place Junior College - An unseen community college Donna attends in lieu of going to the University of Wisconsin to be with Eric (it is also implied Randy attends here). While the education is described as lackluster, the college is located right next to a Dairy Queen (Free Peanut Buster Parfaits are handed out the first day of class). * Point Place Police Academy - The academy all new recruits for the Point Place Police force go to in order to learn about police basics. Kelso attends the school to become a cop, though temporarily transferred to an academy in Waukegan, Illinois after he accidentally burns down the one in Point Place during flare gun practice gone awry. Other places * Point Place Veteran's Association - A VFW type place for military veterans. The place was known for excluding National Guardsmen until Bob sent a series of angry letters to get them to change their policy. Red is well known here. The place is notoriously anti-hippie, even setting up Jane Fonda targets in the urinals, though Leo was treated with respect due to his veteran status. * Point Place Church - An unnamed church attended by the Formans. The denomination is never stated; it has no priests and no apparent Catholic iconography but it is nonetheless attended by Bob and Midge Pinciotti, established Catholics. In Season 1 Episode 10 \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday,\\" Red's mother, Bernice Forman notes the number of Polish (or how she puts it \\"Polaks\\") in the congregation. Services have been officiated by two different characters: Pastor Dave (Kevin McDonald) and Pastor Dan (Billy Dee Williams). Eric Forman also mentions taking communion in one episode. * Funland - An amusement park about 12 miles from Eric's house. The mascots are Woofy the Funland Dog (portrayed by Tom Kenny) and the Funland Princess. When Woofy hears someone ask for the time he jumps in and says it's always \\"fun o'clock\\" (except for closing time), usually followed by a barbershop quartet. Kelso gets lost every time he goes there because \\"there's fun around every corner.\\" * War Memorial Auditorium - A stadium built mainly for concerts. The gang sees Ted Nugent there in one episode. * Nipple Creek - An unseen creek that was mentioned as a possible location for Eric and Donna's wedding. * The Viking Lodge - This is for elderly men what the Hub is for the youth. This is the place where elderly men, including Red (and, twice, Steven Hyde) hang out and hide from their wives. It is also known for having a sauna, where Hyde gets uncomfortable when the old men open their robes. * Bus Station - A bus station for Greyhound and other cross country buses. In season 1 episode 9, the Forman family pick up Laurie and Kate (Laurie's friend) on their Thanksgiving holiday visit back from college. Eric dropped Donna off here when she was planning to go to college (though she stayed behind). In another episode, Kelso tries to drop Jackie off here so she can head for Chicago to begin her new job, but she refuses because \\"other people's butts have been in those seats\\" and demands Kelso drive her there. * Charlie's Bar - A bar in Point Place where some of the adults and possibly the teens hang out. On Red's last day of work at the auto parts plant, he joins his co-workers at the bar for one last drink. This is the only time Red drinks with them here (the co-workers are presumably hated by Red but are friends with each other and apparently hang out here). * Phillies - A diner briefly shown in the eighth episode of season 1 where Red and Kitty eat. The camera zooms out, showing the diner from Nighthawks. * Blannigan's - This casual restaurant for young folk replaced the high class The Lion's Head restaurant, which previously burned down. Both of these venues are featured in the season 1, episode 8 Drive-In, when Red and Kitty are trying to be more spontaneous, due to poor results in a Cosmo survey. * K-Mart - Jackie mentions one is opening up on Franklin Street. * Point Place Meditation Supply and Dried Fruit Depot - The store where Kitty purchased her meditation supplies in Season 7, Episode 5. Kitty viewed the store name as clever. Eric remarked that his mother had a low bar for thinking of something as clever, a realization that he said colored many of the compliments she had given him. * The Slaughterhouse (unseen) - A slaughter house located in or near the town on Slaughterhouse Drive. It's possible one of the positions Eric was interviewed for in \\"Hey, Hey, What Can I Do?\\" by the company that owns the slaughterhouse. * The Arboretum (unseen) - Donna and Eric visited seeing plants and trees from around the world. Eric said it was a \\"great day\\" until Donna left and then said to the guys it was a \\"horrible day\\" with \\"little signs with Latin\\". (Season 5 Episode 11)  Nearby fictitious locations  * Burkhart Cabin; a ski cabin owned by Jackie's parents. An occasional destination for the group, the cabin is eventually foreclosed on following her father's imprisonment. Directions may make it hard to locate for how she describes: \\"Interstate 43 to Wisconsin Highway 60, head east when it gets different, go a ways past the fancy thing and turn left at the ugly house...\\" Also in the directions are mentions of \\"a place where (Jackie) bought a green sweater\\" and \\"dropped (her) gum that time\\".

Educated as a physicist and engineer, he found an interest in audio equipment at a young age. He applied his talent to produce numerous innovative high fidelity designs since the 1970s. He is known for designing the Phase Linear 700, at 350 W per channel the most powerful consumer audio amplifier available in 1972. He went on to found the Carver Corporation in 1979, Sunfire in 1994, and the Bob Carver LLC in 2011 Bob Carver: Carving a Name For Himself. Stereophile magazine, 7 February 1990.

However, in December 2013, Bob Carver and Jade Design parted ways.Emotiva and Bob Carver Part Ways'' ThePoorAudiophile. Posted: December 14, 2013  Amplifier modeling  Carver caused a stir in the industry in the mid-1980s when he challenged two high-end audio magazines to give him any audio amplifier at any price, and he‚Äôd duplicate its sound in one of his lower cost (and usually much more powerful) designs. Two magazines accepted the challenge. First, The Audio Critic chose a Mark Levinson ML-2 which Bob acoustically copied (transfer function duplication) and sold as his M1.5t amplifier (the ‚Äút‚Äù stood for transfer function modified). In 1985, Stereophile magazine challenged Bob to copy a Conrad-Johnson Premier Four (the make and model was not named then, but revealed later) amplifier at their offices in New Mexico within 48 hours. The Conrad Johnson amplifiers were one of the most highly regarded amplifiers of the day, costing in excess of $6,000 a pair. Of note that in both cases, the challenging amplifier could only be treated as a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù and could not even have its lid removed. Nevertheless, Carver, using null difference testing, (null difference testing consists of driving two different amplifiers with identical signal sources and exact levels, but out of phase by exactly 180 degrees. If the amplifiers were 100% identical, no sound would be heard. If sound was heard, the audio amps had different properties). Bob Carver used \\"distortion pots\\" to introduce amplifier characteristics, fine-tuned to null-out any sound differences. His \\"motel- room\\" modified amplifier sound was so similar, Stereophile Magazine editors could not tell the difference between his amplifier and one costing more than $6,000. This amplifier was marketed as the M1.0t for about $400.00. Bob Carver may have single-handedly debunked any number of theories about sound quality by using physics, blind and double-blind testing and unbiased measurements (such as \\"gold-plated speaker wires sound better than copper wires\\", etc.). Carver successfully copied the sound of the target amplifier and won the challenge. The Stereophile employees failed to pass a single blind test with their own equipment in their own listening room. He marketed ‚Äút‚Äù versions of his amplifiers incorporating the sound of the Mark Levinson and Conrad Johnson designs which caused him some criticism by those who failed to understand the true nature of the challenge ‚Äî that it was possible to duplicate an audio amplifier's sound in two completely dissimilar designs. In light of this criticism, Carver went on to design the Silver Seven, the most expensive and esoteric conventional amplifier up to that time and duplicated its sound in his M 4.0t and later models which sold for some 1/40th the price (around $600‚Äì$1500). This also started Carver's departure from the M-series amplifier to the more robust and current-pushing TFM series amplifiers. The TFM amplifiers were designed specifically to drive the demanding load of the Amazing ribbon loudspeakers. The apex of Carver's amplifier line was the Lightstar, which is now a collectors' item. Only approximately 100 of the amplifiers were made. The original Lightstar amplifier, called the Lightstar Reference, featured a dual-monoblock design, with separate power cords for each channel. A later version, called the Lightstar 2.0, featured one power cord & other cost-saving measures to shave approximately $1800 off the retail price. The two are reported to be sonically identical. Carver also later sued Stereophile magazine for its alleged bias against Carver products. (Stereophile had first filed suit against Carver for reprinting the magazine's copyrighted material without authorization.) The case was arbitrated with neither side awarded damages. Product naming Carver has used some names in marketing which have other technical definitions: *The \\"auto-correlator\\" is a multi-band, single-ended dynamic noise filter, as described in . The Phase Linear 1000 audio processor, and the Model 4000 preamplifier, which incorporate the same circuitry, have noise reduction in four frequency bands, one in the bass intended to suppress turntable rumble and three in the treble intended to suppress tape hiss and such. The noise filters are controlled by signals derived from bandpass filters, not from a correlation process. Correlation is the comparison of two or more signals, while auto-correlation is the comparison of a signal with delayed versions of itself to determine the degree of similarity at different delay times ‚Äî useful, for example, to determine the amount of delay that produced an echo. *\\"Magnetic field coil power amplifier\\" ‚Äî audio amplifiers of the vacuum-tube era used transformers, incorporating coils of wire, to convert the high-voltage, low-current output of the output tubes to a low-voltage, high-current output suitable for loudspeakers. Output transformers are no longer necessary with amplifiers, including Carver's, that use transistors. Carver's , first applied in his model M400 power amplifier, describes a power supply whose input switches on and off at an ultrasonic rate to adapt to the varying power demand of the amplifier. The innovation is in the power supply, not the amplification circuitry, and in the use of switching, not in the use of a coil or coils. *\\"Sonic holography\\", as described in was first incorporated in the Carver C4000 preamplifier. It enhances stereo imaging by introducing a delayed and equalized signal from the right channel at the left loudspeaker to cancel the signal from the right loudspeaker at the listener's left ear (and vice versa). *The \\"asymmetrical charge-coupled detector\\" is not the FM detector circuit of tuners, but rather, as described in , it is single-ended dynamic noise- reduction processing applied to the noisy left-minus-right component of a weak FM-stereo signal, along with artificial ambience generation to compensate for loss of ambience resulting from the noise reduction. This innovation was introduced in the Carver TX-1-11 component FM stereo tuner noise reduction unit and the Carver TX-11 AM/FM Stereo Tuner in 1982.

Joan Schonerus Mathematicus Johannes Sch√∂ner (16 January 1477, in Karlstadt am Main ‚Äì 16 January 1547, in the Free Imperial City of Nuremberg) (aka, Johann Sch√∂nner, Johann Schoener, Jean Sch√∂nner, Joan Schoenerus) was a renowned and respected German polymath. It is best to refer to him using the usual 16th-century Latin term \\"mathematicus\\", as the areas of study to which he devoted his life were very different from those now considered to be the domain of the mathematician. He was a priest, astronomer, astrologer, geographer, cosmographer, cartographer, mathematician, globe and scientific instrument maker and editor and publisher of scientific tests. In his own time he enjoyed a European wide reputation as an innovative and influential globe maker and cosmographer and as one of the continent's leading and most authoritative astrologers.Norbert Holst, Mundus, Mirabilia, Mentalit√§t: Weltbild und Quellen des Kartographen Johannes Sch√∂ner: eine Spurensuche, Frankfurt/Oder, Scripvaz, 1999. ; John W. Hessler , A Renaissance Globemaker's Toolbox: Johannes Sch√∂ner and the Revolution of Modern Science, 1475-1550, Washington, DC: Library of Congress; London: In association with D. Giles Ltd., 2013. Today he is remembered as an influential pioneer in the history of globe making and as a man who played a significant role in the events that led up to the publishing of Copernicus' \\"De revolutionibus\\" in N√ºrnberg in 1543. LifeEarly life= Sch√∂ner was born on 16 January 1477 in Karlstadt am Main in Lower Franconia. As with most Renaissance scholars nothing is known about his parents or his early life. All that is known is that he had a brother, Peter, to whom he addressed his \\"Arzneibuch\\" in 1528. Quite detailed information for Sch√∂ner‚Äôs adult life, at least up to 1506, has been preserved in his own marginalia in his copy of Regiomontanus' printed Ephemerides, which he used as a diary. He matriculated at the University of Erfurt in the winter semester 1494/5 and graduated Baccalaureus on 21 March 1498. He was appointed to a position in the school in Gem√ºnden on 22 February 1499 and ordained as a Catholic priest in the Bishopric of Bamberg on 13 June 1500. On 2 February 1500 he moved to Bamberg and was appointed chaplain in Hallstatt near Bamberg on 18 April 1500. His next appointment was as vicar in his hometown Karlstadt from 4 June 1504. Between 4 May and 29 October 1506 he was again in Bamberg before he returned to Karlstadt. His diary also informs us that he entered a relationship with Kunigunde Holocher in 1499, with whom he had three children: a son Johannes born on 1 February 1502, a daughter Sibilla born on 12 June 1503 and a second son Vitus born on 21 November 1504. A facsimile copy of Sch√∂ner's Waldseem√ºller map at the Library of Congress in Washington Sch√∂ner was the owner of the only specimen of the 1507 Waldseem√ºller map of the world that has survived and which was rediscovered at Schloss Wolfegg in Upper Swabia in 1901. Since 2003 it is in possession of the Library of Congress. =Bamberg= Algorithmus demonstratus, 1534 No diary exists after 1506, and up to 1515 there are only indirect traces of Sch√∂ner's existence in the financial records of the bishopric and in the correspondence of Lorenz Beheim (?1457 - 1521), who after 24 years in Rome as chamberlain to Pope Alexander IV had returned to Bamberg in 1505 as a canon of the cathedral. 1526, he was called to N√ºrnberg as the first professor of mathematics at the newly founded gymnasium Aegidianum, a post he held till one year prior to his death. At the same time, he converted to Protestantism and married. Already in Bamberg, he owned his own printing company and published many maps and globes. The very first printed globe of the sky was made in his workshop in 1515. He made another globe in 1520.Western hemisphere of the Sch√∂ner globe from 1520. Sch√∂ner had also made still unpublished data of Mercury observations from Walther available to Copernicus, 45 observations in total, 14 of them with longitude and latitude. Copernicus used three of them in \\"De revolutionibus\\", giving only longitudes, and falsely attributing them to Sch√∂ner. The values differed slightly from the ones published by Sch√∂ner in 1544. 1538, Georg Joachim Rheticus, a young professor of mathematics at Wittenberg and former assistant of Copernicus, stayed for some time with Sch√∂ner who convinced him to visit Nicolaus Copernicus in Frauenburg. In 1540, Rheticus dedicated the first published report of Copernicus work, the Narratio prima, to Sch√∂ner, to test the waters of the reaction by the Catholic Church. As this was well received, Copernicus finally agreed to publish his main work, and Rheticus prepared Copernicus' manuscript for printing. In N√ºrnberg, Sch√∂ner published in 1544 the astronomical observations of Regiomontanus and Walther, as well as manuscripts of Regiomontanus, which had been in the hand of Walther, as Observationes XXX annorum a I. Regiomontano et B. Walthero Norimbergae habitae, [4¬∞, Norimb. 1544]. A crater on Mars is named in his honor.

The word J√§ger (meaning \\"hunter\\" or \\"huntsman\\") is a characteristic term used for light infantry in German speaking countries. Origins The mountain infantry of Austria have their roots in the three Landessch√ºtzen regiments of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The mountain infantry of modern Germany carry on certain traditions of the German Alpenkorps (Alpine corps) of World War I. Both countries' mountain infantry share the Edelwei√ü insignia, established in 1907 as a symbol of the Austro-Hungarian Landessch√ºtzen regiments by Emperor Franz Joseph I. These troops wore the edelweiss on the uniform collar. When the Alpenkorps served alongside the Landessch√ºtzen on Austria's southern frontier against Italian forces from May 1915, the Landessch√ºtzen honoured the men of the Alpenkorps by awarding them their own insignia: the edelweiss. Gebirgsj√§ger in World War II Gebirgsj√§ger group in late 1942 during the Battle of the Caucasus. During World War II the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS raised a number of mountain infantry units, identified by the edelweiss insignia worn on their sleeves and caps. These divisions were lightly equipped, with much of the transport provided by mules. They were equipped with fewer automatic weapons than regular infantry, however the MG 34 or MG 42 machine gunners were provided with more ammunition than their regular infantry counterparts. Special equipment was made for them including the G33/40 mauser rifle based on the VZ.33 rifle. Mountain infantry participated in many campaigns, including Operations Weser√ºbung, Silver Fox, Platinum Fox, Arctic Fox and Northern Lights. They also served in the Caucasus, the invasion of Crete, the Balkans, the Gothic Line, and the battles in the Vosges region of France. = Heer (Army) Mountain divisions = * 1st Mountain Division (later 1st Volksgebirgs Division) * 2nd Mountain Division * 3rd Mountain Division * 4th Mountain Division * 5th Mountain Division * 6th Mountain Division * 7th Mountain Division (previously 99th Light Infantry Division) * 8th Mountain Division (previously Division Nr. 157, 157th Reserve Division, 157th Mountain Division) * 9th Mountain Division (previously Shadow Division Steiermark and Division zbV 140) * 188th Mountain Division (previously Division Nr. 188, 188th Reserve Mountain Division) = Waffen SS Mountain divisions = * 6th SS Mountain Division Nord * 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen * 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian) * 21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg (1st Albanian) * 23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama (2nd Croatian) * 24th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Karstj√§ger Gebirgsj√§ger in the modern German forces Badge of the Gebirgsj√§gerbrigade 23 shows an Edelwei√ü, traditional symbol for German mountain forces Upon the creation of the Bundeswehr in 1956, the mountain infantry returned as a distinctive arm of the West German army. Until 2001, they were organized as the 1. Gebirgsdivision, disbanded as part of Bundeswehr reductions at the end of the cold war. The successor unit is Gebirgsj√§gerbrigade 23 which has its headquarters in Bad Reichenhall. The battalions of these units are deployed in southern Bavaria, the only high mountain area in Germany touching the Northern Alps. Since 2008 the unit is officially called \\"Gebirgsj√§gerbrigade 23 Bayern (Bavaria)\\" to mark the close relationship between the state and the Gebirgsj√§ger. In mid-2020, the official Bundeswehr website stated that the brigade had a strength of approximately 5,300 soldiers. A German Gebirgsj√§ger wearing the formal uniform with the characteristic clothes and boots =Traditions= The soldiers of the mountain infantry wear a grey cap (Bergm√ºtze) with an edelwei√ü on its left side, stem to the front. This distinguishes them from all other German army soldiers who wear berets and the Austrian army, whose edelwei√ü has its stem to the back. The formal uniform, which is based on traditional alpine mountain climbing trekking outfits (Berganzug), is also different from the standard mainstream German army uniform, and consists of a light-weight grey ski blouse (Skibluse), black Stirrup trousers (Keilhose) or especially during the summer periods \\"Culottes\\" knee-breeches (kniebundhose) similar to knickerbockers, and ankle-height mountaineering boots (Bergstiefel) or dual- use mountaineering ski boots. German Gebirgsj√§ger traditionally share a very close comradeship and distinct esprit de corps. There is also a special perception of discipline which can for example be seen in a relatively informal relationship between officers and soldiers during normal day duty. =Tasks of the German Gebirgsj√§ger= The main tasks of the German mountain infantry are: * Warfare in extreme weather conditions * Winter warfare * Warfare in urban terrain * Warfare in arctic, mountain and desert terrainOrganisation Picture w/NATO icons for German 23 Mountain Brigade.  23rd Gebirgsj√§gerbrigade  The structure of the 23rd Gebirgsj√§gerbrigade is as of May 2020: * 25px 23rd Gebirgsj√§ger Brigade (Gebirgsj√§gerbrigade 23), in Bad Reichenhall ** 20px Staff and Signal Company 23rd Gebirgsj√§ger Brigade, in Bad Reichenhall ** 25px 230th Mountain Reconnaissance Battalion (Gebirgsaufkl√§rungsbataillon 230), in F√ºssen with Fennek reconnaissance vehicles and KZO drones ** 25px 231st Gebirgsj√§ger Battalion (Gebirgsj√§gerbataillon 231), in Bad Reichenhall with GTK Boxer armoured personnel carriers ** 25px 232nd Gebirgsj√§ger Battalion (Gebirgsj√§gerbataillon 232), in Bischofswiesen with Bv206S ** 25px 233rd Gebirgsj√§ger Battalion (Gebirgsj√§gerbataillon 233), in Mittenwald with Bv206S ** 25px 8th Mountain Engineer Battalion (Gebirgspionierbataillon 8), in Ingolstadt ** 25px 8th Mountain Supply Battalion (Gebirgsversorgungsbataillon 8), in F√ºssen ** 25px 230th Mountain Pack Animal Operations and Training Center (Einsatz- und Ausbildungszentrum f√ºr Gebirgstragtierwesen 230), in Bad Reichenhall Mountain units which are not part of the Gebirgsj√§gerbrigade 23: * 20px Mountain and Winter Combat Training Base (Ausbildungsst√ºtzpunkt Gebirgs- und Winterkampf), in Mittenwald As the Gebirgsj√§gerbrigade 23 is part of the so-called stabilisation forces (Stabilisierungskr√§fte), it lacks any accompanying artillery.

Brooks (October 18, 1906 ‚Äì March 9, 1992) was an American muralist, abstract painter, and winner of the Logan Medal of the Arts. Life and career Brooks was born in St. Louis, Missouri and attended Southern Methodist University and the Dallas Art Institute and moved to New York in 1926 where he attended night classes at the Art Students League. Between 1942 and 1945, Brooks was enlisted as a combat artist with the American military. Based in Cairo, he traveled to Palestine, Benghazi, Libya, and other parts of Egypt during this time, photographing American military camps, the aftermath of combat, and locals. From these photographs, he created a series of drawings and gouache paintings that were then submitted to the army. Upon returning to the U.S. in 1946, he worked in Washington D.C., where he first met artist Charlotte Park. Brooks was a friend of Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner and would move into Pollock's Greenwich Village apartment at 46 East 8th Street after Pollock and Krasner moved to Springs, New York in East Hampton, New York. In 1947 he married artist Charlotte Park. They also moved to East Hampton in 1949 creating a studio at Rocky Point in Montauk, New York. The Montauk studio and several of Brooks paintings were destroyed in Hurricane Carol with the studio being blown off a hill in 1954. Brooks then had their house which was not damaged towed by barge across to Springs where it was located on an 11-acre parcel on Neck Path close to Pollock's home. Brooks and Park had no children and their property after the house and studios were left vacant was sold to East Hampton in 2013 with the town planning to tear it down. The town reconsidered their decision in February 2017 to tear down following a local campaign to restore the compound and instead announced plans to restore the studio and house. Town officials noted Brooks paint cans were still in the studio. Considered a first generation abstract expressionist painter, Brooks was among the first abstract expressionists to use staining as an important technique. According to art critic Carter Ratcliff,Art International, February 1973. pp 38‚Äì39 \\"His concern has always been to create painterly accidents of the kind that allow buried personal meanings to take on visibility.\\" In his paintings from the late 1940s Brooks began to dilute his oil paint in order to stain the mostly raw canvas. These works often combined calligraphy and abstract shapes. Brooks had his first one-man exhibition of his abstract expressionist paintings in 1949 at the Peridot Gallery in New York. His work was displayed in the 9th Street Art Exhibition in 1951. Boon, oil on canvas, 1957, Tate Gallery Public collections holding works by James Brooks include: the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection (Albany, NY), Courtauld Institute of Art (London), the Dallas Museum of Art (Dallas, Texas), the Museum of Modern Art (New York, NY), the Harvard University Art Museums, the Whitney Museum of American Art (New York, NY), the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Indianapolis Museum of Art (Indianapolis, Indiana), the Sheldon Art Gallery (Lincoln, Nebraska), the Smithsonian American Art Museum (Washington D.C.), the Tate Gallery (London) and the Walker Art Center (Minneapolis, Minnesota). His works were also exhibited by galleries including the Anita Shapolsky Gallery in New York City, the Peridot Gallery in New York, and Washburn Gallery in New York.

It is the fifth-largest public hospital in the United States, and one of the busiest Level I trauma centers in the country. Historical segregation of its hospital units meant that it was also called \\"The Gradys,\\" a name that still surfaces among elderly Atlanta residents, especially African-Americans. It is the flagship of the Grady Health System. History Grady Memorial Hospital was first founded in 1890 and opened in 1892, as an outgrowth of the Atlanta Benevolent Home. It is named for Henry W. Grady, an Atlanta Constitution journalist and later owner who became a major force in Georgia politics, and advocated for a public city hospital. At the time of opening, the hospital officially had 14 rooms. The original building (at 36 Butler Street) is now on the National Register of Historic Places and is known as Georgia Hall, where the hospital's human resources staff now work. The second Grady Hospital at Butler Hall, opened in 1912 and was for whites only, with blacks being segregated at the Atlanta Medical College. The third hospital was at Hirsch Hall, and the current location is its fourth. From 1945 until 2008, the hospital was run by the Fulton/DeKalb Hospital Authority. The current facility was also built as a segregated institution, with one section serving whites (Wings A & B; facing the city) and another section serving African-Americans (Wings C & D; facing the opposite direction). Even though it is a single building and the two sides are connected by a hallway (Wing E), the facility was referred to in the plural (\\"The Gradys\\") during the years of segregation. In 2007 and 2008, journalist Mike King of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote a series of \\"Saving Grady\\" editorials ‚Äì dozens of pieces over eighteen months ‚Äì during the time when Grady Memorial Hospital was nearly insolvent and in danger of closing.Ga. Baptist Hires 2 Surgeons, Rejoins Atlanta Trauma System Author: KING, MIKE Mike King Science/Medicine Writer STAFF Date: December 15, 1988 Publication: The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution Page: B/7 = Infant abductions = Seven infants were abducted from Grady from 1978 to 1996, which was more than from any other hospital in the United States during that time period. Five were recovered within hours or weeks of their abduction. An additional child was abducted from the home of his mother after the kidnapper followed her from Grady. The abductions were covered on season two of the podcast The Fall Line. =Problems and restructuring= The hospital board has long been reluctant to make money-saving changes that might reduce its traditional mission. In late 2006, it rejected the advice of financial consultants and its newly hired chief executive to close an expensive outpatient dialysis clinic for the poor, being concerned that many of the clinic's uninsured patients, including many illegal immigrants, would have nowhere else to turn. Others argued that the board of directors are politically clumsy, and prone to micromanagement. In May the board's own consultants concluded that \\"Grady does not currently have the depth of leadership\\" necessary to transform the hospital. In 2008, Grady Memorial Hospital was made into a non-profit organization. Numerous foundations have pledged hundreds of millions of dollars to revitalize it. Michael Young has become chief executive officer. He was formerly the CEO of Erie County Medical Center Corp. in Western New York, University of Buffalo tertiary center. Prior to that, Young served for 16 years as president and CEO of the three-hospital, 530-bed Lancaster General Hospital & Health System in Lancaster, Pen In February 2013, it was announced that Grady's net profit was $20 million and that 200-300 jobs had been added at the hospital in the preceding 18 months. =2008 tornado= On March 14, 2008, the buildings of Grady sustained minor damage when a tornado tore through downtown Atlanta. Historic Georgia Hall was the hardest hit, with windows blown out, a chimney that collapsed and water damage. The main hospital had a few cafeteria windows blown out, but never lost power. It was the first tornado to hit the downtown area since local weather record keeping began in the 1880s. Nine people were taken to Grady for treatment, one of whom had critical injuries.Friday tornado pummels downtown; Saturday storm kills 2 by Tim Eberly and Paul Shea for the Atlanta Journal and Constitution, March 15, 2008.

Service The hospital serves a large proportion of low-income patients and is supported almost entirely by Fulton and DeKalb counties, with little help from the suburbs or state, despite serving all of metro Atlanta's several counties. Grady sued the state over lack of Medicaid compensation in 2004. The hospital relies almost entirely on Emory University School of Medicine and Morehouse School of Medicine to provide doctor and resident staffing. As an editorial in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said, \\"When you read the phrase 'Grady doctor,' do a silent translation, because those words really mean either 'Emory doctor' or 'Morehouse doctor.'\\" Grady Hospital's ambulance service, Grady EMS, shares 9-1-1 responsibility for Fulton County, Georgia. The Downtown Connector (Interstate 75/85) makes a large bend around the hospital on its otherwise due north‚Äìsouth route, dubbed the \\"Grady Curve\\" on traffic reports.  Notable patients  On August 11, 1949, Gone with the Wind author Margaret Mitchell was hit by a speeding car while crossing Peachtree Street with her husband on the way to a movie. She was knocked unconscious and was taken to Grady. X-rays showed that her skull was fractured from the top of her head all the way down to her spine and her pelvis was shattered. She never regained consciousness, and died five days later at Grady, on August 16, 1949. The driver, who had 23 prior traffic violations, was thought to be drunk and was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and served an 11-month jail term.New York Times, Margaret Mitchell Obituary, August 17, 1949. In 2001, actor Whitman Mayo, who played the character Grady on television's Sanford and Son, died of a heart attack at Grady. Grady Hospital gained national attention for treating supermodel Niki Taylor after her near-fatal car accident on April 29, 2001 in which she suffered severe liver trauma. It's effectiveness as a level I trauma center was highlighted by this incident. Several press conferences were held outside the hospital discussing the gravity of her injuries and then her slow recovery following more than 50 surgeries.Tyra Banks Show, 2007. It again gained attention after the Bluffton University bus accident in which seven died. The hospital cleared an entire wing of the hospital for the injured victims and their families.  In media  CNN's medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, who is Associate Chief of Neurosurgery at Grady, filmed a documentary at the hospital called Grady's Anatomy (a play on Grey's Anatomy) that aired in 2007 for CNN Special Investigations Unit. The documentary focused on four young medical residents and the daily stress of a large hospital practice. In the fifth season of AMC's The Walking Dead, Grady Memorial became a major setting for several episodes of the show's fifth season in 2014. However, none of the series' scenes were filmed at the actual hospital.

The parliament, like other such institutions, evolved during the Middle Ages from the king's council of bishops and earls. It is first identifiable as a parliament in 1235, during the reign of Alexander II, when it was described as a \\"colloquium\\" and already possessed a political and judicial role. By the early 14th century, the attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and from 1326 commissioners from the burghs attended. Consisting of the \\"three estates\\" of clergy, nobility and the burghs sitting in a single chamber, the parliament gave consent for the raising of taxation and played an important role in the administration of justice, foreign policy, war, and all manner of other legislation. Parliamentary business was also carried out by \\"sister\\" institutions, such as General Councils or Convention of Estates. These could carry out much business also dealt with by parliament ‚Äì taxation, legislation and policy-making ‚Äì but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament.Brown and Tanner, History of the Scottish Parliament, i, Introduction The Parliament of Scotland met for more than four centuries, until it was prorogued sine die at the time of the Acts of Union in 1707. Thereafter the Parliament of Great Britain operated for both England and Scotland after the creation of the Kingdom of Great Britain on 1 May 1707. When the Parliament of Ireland was abolished in 1801, its former members were merged into what was now called the Parliament of the United Kingdom.Mann, Alastair, \\"A Brief History of an Ancient Institution: The Scottish Parliament\\", Scottish Parliamentary Review, Vol. I, No. 1 (June, 2013) [Edinburgh: Blacket Avenue Press] From January 1801 until 1927, the British state was officially called the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (even though the Irish Free State had come into existence in December 1922). The pre-Union parliament was long portrayed as a constitutionally defective bodyR. Rait, Parliaments of Scotland (1928) that acted merely as a rubber stamp for royal decisions, but research during the early 21st century has found that it played an active role in Scottish affairs, and was sometimes a thorn in the side of the Scottish Crown.Brown and Tanner, passim; R. Tanner, The Late Medieval Scottish Parliament, passim; K. Brown and A. Mann, History of the Scottish Parliament, ii, passim  Three Estates  The members were collectively referred to as the Three Estates (), or \\"three communities of the realm\\" (tres communitates), until 1690 composed of: * the first estate of prelates (bishops and abbots) * the second estate of the nobility (dukes, marquesses, earls, viscounts, parliamentary peers (after 1437) and lay tenants-in-chief) * the third estate of Burgh Commissioners (representatives chosen by the royal burghs)Rait, Parliaments of Scotland, passim; The bishops and abbots of the First Estate were the thirteen medieval bishops of Aberdeen, Argyll, Brechin, Caithness, Dunblane, Dunkeld, Galloway, Glasgow, Isles (Sodor), Moray, Orkney, Ross and St Andrews and the mitred abbots of Arbroath, Cambuskenneth, Coupar Angus, Dunfermline, Holyrood, Iona, Kelso, Kilwinning, Kinloss, Lindores, Paisley, Melrose, Scone, St Andrews Priory and Sweetheart. pp. 67‚Äì97 After the reformation in 1559, the Scottish abbeys disappeared, although not overnight. Kelso and Lindores were closed quickly, while others, such as Sweetheart, survived well into the 17th century. Next, the bishops themselves were removed from the Church of Scotland, as a result of the Glorious Revolution and the accession of William of Orange.Kidd, Colin Subverting Scotland's Past: Scottish Whig Historians and the Creation of an Anglo-British Identity 1689‚Äì1830 Cambridge University Press (2003) p. 133 When no members of the First Estate remained, the Second Estate was then split, to retain the division into three. From the 16th century, the second estate was reorganised by the selection of Shire Commissioners: this has been argued to have created a fourth estate. During the 17th century, after the Union of the Crowns, a fifth estate of royal office holders (see Lord High Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland) has also been identified. These latter identifications remain highly controversial among parliamentary historians. Regardless, the term used for the assembled members continued to be \\"the Three Estates\\".The \\"fourth estate\\" argument is primarily favoured by Julian Goodare, and disputed by Keith Brown. A summary of the most recent research can be found in Brown and Mann, History of the Scottish Parliament, ii. A Shire Commissioner was the closest equivalent of the English office of Member of Parliament, namely a commoner or member of the lower nobility. Because the parliament of Scotland was unicameral, all members sat in the same chamber, in contrast to the separate English House of Lords and House of Commons.  Origins  The Scottish parliament evolved during the Middle Ages from the King's Council. It is perhaps first identifiable as a parliament in 1235, described as a \\"colloquium\\" and already with a political and judicial role. In 1296 we have the first mention of burgh representatives taking part in decision making.Bryant, Chris Parliament: The Biography Volume 1, chapter 10 Ane Auld Sang By the early 14th century, the attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and Robert the Bruce began regularly calling burgh commissioners to his Parliament. Consisting of The Three Estates ‚Äì of clerics, lay tenants-in-chief and burgh commissioners ‚Äì sitting in a single chamber, the Scottish parliament acquired significant powers over particular issues. Most obviously it was needed for consent for taxation (although taxation was only raised irregularly in Scotland in the medieval period), but it also had a strong influence over justice, foreign policy, war, and all manner of other legislation, whether political, ecclesiastical, social or economic. Parliamentary business was also carried out by \\"sister\\" institutions, before c. 1500 by General Council and thereafter by the Convention of Estates. These could carry out much business also dealt with by Parliament ‚Äì taxation, legislation and policy-making ‚Äì but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament.Tanner, Parliament, passim The Scottish parliament met in a number of different locations throughout its history. In addition to Edinburgh, meetings were held in Perth, Stirling, St Andrews, Dundee, Linlithgow, Dunfermline, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Inverness and Berwick- upon-Tweed.Brown and Tanner, passim; Brown and Mann, passim  Lords of the Articles  From the early 1450s until 1690, a great deal of the legislative business of the Scottish Parliament was usually carried out by a parliamentary committee known as the \\"Lords of the Articles\\". This was a committee chosen by the three estates to draft legislation which was then presented to the full assembly to be confirmed. In the past, historians have been particularly critical of this body, claiming that it quickly came to be dominated by royal nominees, thus undermining the power of the full assembly.Typified by Rait, op. cit Recent research suggests that this was far from always being the case. Indeed, in March 1482, the committee was taken over by men shortly to be involved in a coup d'√©tat against the King and his government. On other occasions the committee was so large that it could hardly have been easier to control than the full assembly. More generally, the committee was a pragmatic means to delegate the complicated drafting of acts to those members of parliament skilled in law and letters ‚Äì not unlike a modern select committee of the UK Parliament ‚Äì while the right to confirm the act remained with the full assembly of three estates.R. Tanner, \\"The Lords of the Articles before 1542\\", in Scottish Historical Review (2000) The Lords of the Articles were abolished in 1690 as part of the revolutionary settlement.Ferguson, William Scotland's relations with England: a survey to 1707 Saltire Society; New edition (1994) p173  Crown  At various points in its history, the Scottish Parliament was able to exert considerable influence over the Crown. This should not be viewed as a slow rise from parliamentary weakness in 1235 to strength in the 17th century, but rather a situation where in particular decades or sessions between the thirteenth and 17th century, parliament became particularly able to influence the Crown, while at other points that ability was more limited. As early as the reign of David II, parliament was able to prevent him pursuing his policy of a union of the crowns with England, while the 15th-century Stewart monarchs were consistently influenced by a prolonged period of parliamentary strength. Reverses to this situation have been argued to have occurred in the late 16th and early 17th centuries under James VI and Charles I, but in the 17th century, even after the Restoration, parliament was able to remove the clergy's right to attend in 1689 and abolish the Lords of the Articles in 1690, thereby limiting royal power. Parliament's strength was such that the Crown turned to corruption and political management to undermine its autonomy in the latter period. Nonetheless, the period from 1690 to 1707 was one in which political \\"parties\\" and alliances were formed within parliament in a maturing atmosphere of rigorous debate. The disputes over the English Act of Settlement 1701, the Scottish Act of Security, and the English Alien Act 1705 showed that both sides were prepared to take considered yet considerable risks in their relationships.Brown, Mann and Tanner, History of the Scottish Parliament, i, ii, passim.  History  Before 1400 = Scone and its Moot hill emerged as a favoured meeting place of the early colloquia and councils in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Between 1235 and 1286, little can be told with certainty about Parliament's function, but it appears to have had a judicial and political role which was well established by the end of the century. With the death of Alexander III, Scotland found itself without an adult monarch, and in this situation, Parliament seems to have become more prominent as a means to give added legitimacy to the Council of Guardians who ran the country. By the reign of John Balliol (1292‚Äì96), Parliament was well established, and Balliol attempted to use it as a means to withstand the encroachments of his overlord, Edward I of England. With his deposition in 1296, Parliament temporarily became less prominent, but it was again held frequently by King Robert Bruce after 1309. During his reign some of the most important documents made by the King and community of the realm were made in Parliament‚Äîfor instance the 1309‚Äì1310 Declaration of the Clergy. By the reign of David II, the \\"three estates\\" (a phrase that replaced \\"community of the realm\\" at this time) in Parliament were certainly able to oppose the King when necessary. Most notably, David was repeatedly prevented from accepting an English succession to the throne by Parliament. During the reigns of Robert II and Robert III, Parliament appears to have been held less often, and royal power in that period also declined, but the institution returned to prominence, and arguably enjoyed its greatest period of power over the Crown after the return of James I from English captivity in 1424.Brown and Tanner, History of Parliament, i, passim = 15th century = Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh. Usual meeting place of Parliament from 1438 to 1560 By the end of the Middle Ages the Parliament had evolved from the King's Council of Bishops and Earls into a \\"colloquium\\" with a political and judicial role.K. M. Brown and R. J. Tanner, The History of the Scottish Parliament volume 1: Parliament and Politics, 1235‚Äì1560 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), , pp. 1‚Äì28. The attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and burgh commissioners joined them to form the Three Estates.Alan R. MacDonald, The Burghs and Parliament in Scotland, c. 1550‚Äì1651 (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), , p. 14.K. M. Brown, Parliament and Politics in Scotland, 1235‚Äì1560 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), , p. 50. It acquired significant powers over particular issues, including consent for taxation, but it also had a strong influence over justice, foreign policy, war, and other legislation, whether political, ecclesiastical, social or economic. Much of the legislative business of the Scottish parliament was carried out by a parliamentary committee known as the Lords of the Articles, chosen by the three estates to draft legislation which was then presented to the full assembly to be confirmed.R. J. Tanner, 'The Lords of the Articles before 1540', Scottish Historical Review, 79, (2000), pp. 189‚Äì212. After 1424, Parliament was often willing to defy the King ‚Äì it was far from being simply a \\"rubber stamp\\" of royal decisions. During the 15th century, Parliament was called far more often than, for instance, the English Parliament ‚Äì on average over once a year ‚Äì a fact that both reflected and augmented its influence. It repeatedly opposed James I's (1424‚Äì1437) requests for taxation to pay an English ransom in the 1420s and was openly hostile to James III (1460‚Äì1488) in the 1470s and early 1480s. In 1431, Parliament granted a tax to James I for a campaign in the Highlands on the condition that it be kept in a locked chest under the keepership of figures deeply out of favour with the King. In 1436, there was even an attempt made to arrest the King \\"in the name of the three estates\\". Between October 1479 and March 1482, Parliament was conclusively out of the control of James III. It refused to forfeit his brother, the Duke of Albany, despite a royal siege of the Duke's castle, tried to prevent the King leading his army against the English (a powerful indication of the estates' lack of faith in their monarch), and appointed men to the Lords of the Articles and important offices who were shortly to remove the King from power. James IV (1488‚Äì1513) realised that Parliament could often create more problems than it solved, and avoided meetings after 1509. This was a trend seen in other European nations as monarchical power grew stronger ‚Äì for instance England under Henry VII, as well as France and Spain.Tanner, Late Medieval Scottish Parliament, passim = 16th century = St Giles' Kirk, common meeting place of Parliament from 1563 to 1639. Like many continental assemblies the Scottish Parliament was being called less frequently by the early sixteenth century and might have been dispensed with by the crown had it not been for the series of minorities and regencies that dominated from 1513.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , p. 21. The crown was also able to call a Convention of Estates, which was quicker to assemble and could issue laws like parliament, making them invaluable in a crisis, but they could only deal with a specific issueMitchison, Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603‚Äì1745, p. 15. and were more resistant to the giving of taxation rights to the crown. Parliament played a major part in the Reformation crisis of the mid-sixteenth century. It had been used by James V to uphold Catholic orthodoxyWormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625, p. 22. and asserted its right to determine the nature of religion in the country, disregarding royal authority in 1560. The 1560 parliament included 100 lairds, who were predominantly Protestant, and who claimed a right to sit in the Parliament under the provision of a failed shire election act of 1428. Their position in the parliament remained uncertain and their presence fluctuated until the 1428 act was revived in 1587 and provision made for the annual election of two commissioners from each shire (except Kinross and Clackmannan, which had one each). The property qualification for voters was for freeholders who held land from the crown of the value of 40s of auld extent. This excluded the growing class of feuars, who would not gain these rights until 1661.Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625, p. 157. The clerical estate was marginalised in Parliament by the Reformation, with the laymen who had acquired the monasteries sitting as \\"abbots\\" and \\"priors\\". Catholic clergy were excluded after 1567, but a small number of Protestant bishops continued as the clerical estate. James VI attempted to revive the role of the bishops from about 1600.Goodare, The Government of Scotland, 1560‚Äì1625, p. 46. A further group appeared in the Parliament from the minority of James VI in the 1560s, with members of the Privy Council representing the king's interests, until they were excluded in 1641.F. N. McCoy, Robert Baillie and the Second Scots Reformation (Berkeley CA: University of California Press, 1974), , pp. 1‚Äì2. James VI continued to manage parliament through the Lords of the Articles, who deliberated legislation before it reached the full parliament. He controlled the committee by filling it with royal officers as non-elected members, but was forced to limit this to eight from 1617.Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625, p. 158. In the second half of the sixteenth century, Parliament began to legislate on more and more matters and there was a marked increase in the amount of legislation it produced. During the reign of James VI, the Lords of the Articles came more under the influence of the crown. By 1612, they sometimes seem to have been appointed by the Crown rather than Parliament, and as a result the independence of parliament was perceived by contemporaries to have been eroded. During the 16th century, the composition of Parliament underwent a number of significant changes and it found itself sharing the stage with new national bodies. The emergence of the Convention of Royal Burghs as the \\"parliament\\" of Scotland's trading towns and the development of the Kirk's General Assembly after the Reformation (1560) meant that rival representative assemblies could bring pressure to bear on parliament in specific areas. Following the Reformation, laymen acquired the monasteries and those sitting as \\"abbots\\" and \\"priors\\" were now, effectively, part of the estate of nobles. The bishops continued to sit in Parliament regardless of whether they conformed to Protestantism or not. This resulted in pressure from the Kirk to reform ecclesiastical representation in Parliament. Catholic clergy were excluded after 1567 but Protestant bishops continued as the clerical estate until their abolition in 1638 when Parliament became an entirely lay assembly. An act of 1587 granted the lairds of each shire the right to send two commissioners to every parliament. These shire commissioners attended from 1592 onwards, although they shared one vote until 1638 when they secured a vote each. The number of burghs with the right to send commissioners to parliament increased quite markedly in the late 16th and early 17th centuries until, in the 1640s, they often constituted the largest single estate in Parliament.Rait, Parliaments of Scotland The first printed edition of the legislation of the Parliament, The New Actis and Constitutionis, was published in Edinburgh in 1542 by the printer Thomas Davidson under commission from James V. = 17th century = The Riding of Parliament (the procession of members to and from the meeting place of Parliament) c. 1685, from Nicholas de Gueudeville's Atlas Historique, ou Nouvelle Introduction √† l'Histoire √† la Chronologie & √† la G√©ographie Ancienne & Moderne (Amsterdam, 1720) In 1639, the legislature was installed in the newly built Parliament Hall, where it remained until dissolution in 1707.R. A. Mason, Scots and Britons: Scottish Political Thought and the Union of 1603 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), , p. 82. Victory the same year in the early stages of the 1639‚Äì1652 War of the Three Kingdoms brought the Covenanters to power, with bishops being expelled from both kirk and Parliament.A. I. Macinnes, Union and Empire: The Making of the United Kingdom in 1707, Cambridge Studies in Early Modern British History (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), , p. 68. Control of the executive was taken from the Crown, many of the constitutional changes being copied by the English Parliament.https://www.rps.ac.uk/static/history.html However, the Scots were increasingly concerned at their loss of political and economic power since 1603. In an effort to mitigate this, during the 1642‚Äì1645 First English Civil War, the Covenanters agreed the 1643 Solemn League and Covenant. One outcome was the creation of the Committee of Both Kingdoms, a union of English and Scottish parliamentary leaders; opposed by English Royalists and Oliver Cromwell, it was suspended in 1645. In 1647, the Scots agreed to restore Charles to the English throne; their failure in the 1648‚Äì1649 Second English Civil War led to his trial and execution by the English Rump Parliament and officers of the New Model Army. Following the execution the Scots accepted Charles II as king in 1649 but their attempt to put him on the English throne was defeated in the 1649‚Äì1651 Anglo-Scots War. As a result, Scotland was incorporated into the Protectorate (see Cromwell's Act of Grace and Tender of Union) and a brief Anglo-Scottish parliamentary union (1653‚Äì1659).Mason, p.8 An independent Parliament was restored in 1661, sometimes known as the \\"Drunken Parliament\\". The term was coined by John Welsh and he was put in trial for it. The restored body passed the 1661 Rescissory Act, which effectively annulled all Parliamentary legislation since 1633.Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, pp. 231‚Äì4. It generally supported Charles and initially did the same when James succeeded in 1685; when it refused to pass his measures, James suspended it and resorted to rule by decree. The deposition of James in 1689 ended a century of political dispute by confirming the primacy of Parliament over the Crown. The Claim of Right which offered the crown to Mary and her husband William, placed important limitations on royal power, including the abolition of the Lords of the Articles.Mitchison, A History of Scotland, p. 253. It has been argued that unlike its English counterpart, the Scottish parliament never became a true centre of national identity.Mitchison, A History of Scotland, p. 128. The 1707 Acts of Union created a combined Parliament of Great Britain, which sat in Westminster and largely continued English traditions without interruption.Mitchison, A History of Scotland, p. 314. Robert Burns famously claimed Union was brought about by Scots \\"bought and sold for English gold\\" and bribery certainly played a prominent role.C. Whatley, Bought and Sold for English Gold?, passim; Brown and Mann, History of the Scottish Parliament, ii, passim However, it was also driven by the same trends the Scots attempted to manage in the 1640s, worsened by the events of the 1690s; this was a time of economic hardship and famine in many parts of Europe, known in Scotland as the Seven ill years. Combined with the failure of the Dari√©n scheme in 1698, it allowed Anne to achieve her great-grandfather's ambition of a unitary state. Parliament was dissolved, 45 Scots being added to the 513 members of the House of Commons and 16 to the 190 members of the House of Lords.  Composition and procedure in the 17th century  Presidency of parliament = The office of the presiding officer in parliament never developed into a post similar in nature to that of the Speaker of the House of Commons at Westminster, mainly because of parliament's unicameral nature, which made it more like the English House of Lords. An act of 1428 which created a \\"common speaker\\" proved abortive, and the chancellor remained the presiding officer (until recently the British Lord Chancellor osimilarly presided over the House of Lords). In the absence of the King after the Union of the Crowns in 1603, Parliament was presided over by the Lord Chancellor or the Lord High Commissioner. After the Restoration, the Lord Chancellor was made ex-officio president of the parliament (now reflected in the Scottish Parliament by the election of a presiding officer), his functions including the formulation of questions and putting them to the vote.

In the film, however, he is made Olive's younger brother and is considerably less sophisticated than his comic strip counterpart.

Tim had already appeared on songs with the Ultramagnetic MCs and went on to form a duo, Ultra, with member Kool Keith. \\"Fuck Compton\\" appeared in XXL magazine's \\"Top 25 Diss Tracks of All Time\\" and earned Tim Dog critical acclaim from progressive hip-hop producer Blockhead, who said Tim Dog's \\"The Dog's Gonna Getcha\\" (off Penicillin on Wax) is \\"quite possibly the hardest song ever made.\\"Blockhead Biography.

On February 14, 2013, the media reported that Tim Dog died of complications from diabetes.Sha Be Allah, \\"R.I.P. Tim Dog,\\" The Source, February 14, 2013. By May 2013, he was under investigation for allegedly faking his death to avoid charges of grand larceny, and a warrant was issued in Mississippi for his arrest.Daniel Martin, \\"Rapper Tim Dog Accused of Faking Own Death,\\" The Guardian, May 23, 2013. However, on September 15, 2014, it was finally confirmed by NBC News that Tim Dog had indeed died on February 14, 2013, as had been initially reported, but then disputed. A death certificate was filed in DeKalb County, Georgia, putting an end to speculation that he was still alive and trying to avoid his court-mandated debts. Biography During the early 1990s, seminal rap group N.W.A and several other West Coast rap artists were becoming popular within the hip hop community and magazines such as Word Up! and The Source provided significant coverage to artists from Los Angeles. The success of N.W.A and their focus on the South Central L.A. suburb of Compton via their platinum album Straight Outta Compton had spawned a number of imitators and other groups who also claimed to represent the suburb. The success of artists such as Compton's Most Wanted and DJ Quik led to a period in hip hop where so- called \\"gangsta rap\\" and its trademark dress of black Los Angeles Raiders and Los Angeles Kings gear were de rigueur. Some New York hip hop artists resented the exposure and success of their West Coast counterparts, an animosity which Tim Dog would tap into via the release of his groundbreaking first single. Frustrated at the apparent lack of interest in East Coast artists from record companies, Tim recorded \\"Fuck Compton\\", a scathing diss track from his debut album Penicillin on Wax. \\"Fuck Compton\\" attacked the city's style of dress and musical output and made threatening gestures to several Compton rappers including Eazy-E, MC Ren, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Michel'le. Tim Dog would later exclude Ice Cube on \\"Step to Me\\", another diss track attacking N.W.A. The lyrics also made reference to an infamous incident involving N.W.A's Dr. Dre and Pump It Up host Dee Barnes. Barnes had accused Dre (real name Andre Young) of assaulting her after Pump It Up had edited an N.W.A interview to include disparaging comments made by Ice Cube, who was embroiled in a feud with his former group at the time. The single was released by Ruffhouse Records, home to other artists such as Cypress Hill and Kris Kross, and became a worldwide underground hit in the clubs and hip hop circles. Two versions of a music video were released‚Äîthe original version and a censored edition. Penicillin on Wax included several additional \\"disses\\" aimed at both Compton artists and commercially successful artists such as Kid 'n Play and Kwam√©. The intro used the same beat as N.W.A's Efil4zaggin album intro. Tim taunted, \\"I stole your beat and made it better, to show the whole world that you ain't nothing but a bunch of pussies,\\" before a number of disparaging answering machine messages supported Tim's position as he rapped, \\"Wearing all that black, driving them cars, but you still look wack!\\" In another skit, \\"DJ Quik Beat Down,\\" Tim Dog \\"physically assaulted\\" DJ Quik. Since the release, incoming responses came the following years from west coast artists Snoop Dogg, DJ Quik, Compton's Most Wanted, Penthouse Players Clique, Rodney O & Joe Cooley, and Tweedy Bird Loc. Tim followed up with his second album Do or Die in 1993. The album represented Tim's shift of focus away from confrontation with the West Coast and instead concentrated on hardcore East Coast rap. The album contained a shout-out to Tupac Shakur whom Tim thanked for assisting him when involved in a potentially violent situation when touring in California. In 1994, Tim Dog released the EP Bitch with a Perm. The second track, \\"Dog Baby\\", was another diss to Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. Tim Dog moved to the UK in 1995 and worked with UK artist Apache Indian, producing the hit single \\"Make Way for the Indian\\". Tim then toured with Kool Keith and recorded several other tracks, including his August 2005 collaboration with Percee P, \\"NY to the UK.\\" Tim Dog had been the head of \\"Rap Legends Recordings\\" and previously co-founded Our Turn Records in Los Angeles with Eddie Pugh, President of Black Music Sony Records. Previously, he was the CEO President of Big Xity Entertainment based in New York and BMC Management based in Atlanta. =Legal issues and death= In 2011, Tim Dog pleaded guilty to grand larceny for conning a woman, Esther Pilgrim, out of $32,000 in an online dating scam. He was sentenced to five years' probation and ordered to pay restitution of $19,000 to Pilgrim. The case was featured on the June 15, 2012, episode of Dateline NBC, which clarified that it was a best interest plea (Alford plea) to theft. Tim Dog reportedly died of complications from diabetes on February 14, 2013. However, the funeral was canceled and no death certificate or autopsy existed. His family also stayed away from the media claiming religious reasons as a justification for their shunning of the press and wanting to mourn in private. After Pilgrim alleged in May 2013 that Tim Dog's \\"reported death\\" may have been a scheme by Tim Dog to avoid payments to her, she came public demanding further investigation about his death. A warrant was issued in Mississippi for his arrest in case he was still alive. On September 15, 2014, it was finally confirmed by NBC News that Tim Dog had indeed died on February 14, 2013, as had been initially reported, but then disputed. A death certificate was filed in Dekalb County, Georgia, putting an end to speculation that he was still alive and trying to avoid his court- mandated debts.

The unusual odd number of Canon Tables suggests these seven folios were prepared as much as two centuries earlier than the rest of the codex. The codex contains the Vulgate version of the four Gospels, the canon tables of Eusebius of Caesarea, the letter of Jerome to Pope Damasus (Novum opus), the prologue of St. Jerome to the Gospels (Plures fuisse), and prologues and chapter lists for each of the Gospels. The text is written on vellum in two columns in uncial script with no division between words. The running titles are in small uncials while the incipits and explicits are in capitals. The incipits and explicits are written in alternating lines of red and black ink. The subscription of Lupus is written in uncials, and also has alternating lines of red and black ink. The text contains additional punctuation and annotations in a 10th-century Beneventuan hand. There are 240 folios of 355 by 275 mm. The folios are generally gathered into quires of eight folios each. There are a few gatherings of ten folios and a few gatherings are lacking one or more folios. The rear flyleaf (folio 240) is a piece of vellum from another manuscript and contains a fragment of a commentary on the Epistle to the Romans written in a 9th-century Carolingian minuscule that has 10th century Beneventan punctuation. Folio 4 recto from the Codex Beneventanus, with a blank canon table. The manuscript has decorated canon tables, initials, and incipits and explicits. The canon tables are underneath arches decorated with gold, red and blue. Both sides of folio 4 have decorated arches, but are otherwise blank. Each of the Gospels begins with an initial which is decorated in green, red, and gold. The incipits and explicits are decorated with green red and black ivy leaves. The manuscript was owned in the 8th century by the monastery of St. Vincent on the Voturno, and may have been produced there. By the 13th century it was associated with St. Peter's convent in Benevento. In the first half of the 18th century it was owned by Richard Mead, and was used by Richard Bentley in his collation of New Testament texts. Dr. Mead may have acquired the manuscript in the 1690s when he traveled to Italy, however, the manuscript did not appear in the catalog of the sale of his library in 1754-55. The manuscript was later owned by Anthony Askew (d. 1754). It was purchased by John Jackson in 1785 at the sale of Askew's manuscripts. The British Library purchased it in 1794 at the sale of Jackson's manuscripts.

It consists of emcees Dray (also known as Krazy Drayz, born Andre Weston, September 9, 1970) and Skoob (also known as Books, born William \\"Willie\\" Hines, November 27, 1970). They named themselves \\"DAS\\" standing for \\"Dray and Skoob\\" and \\"EFX\\" meaning \\"effects\\". They rose to popularity in the early 1990s due to the duo's stream of consciousness lyrical delivery, which became one of the most influential lyrical styles in hip hop music at the time; as well as their affiliation with EPMD's Hit Squad. Their style combined intricate rhymes, sometimes mixed with made up words (especially ending with \\"-iggedy\\"), delivered with a fast-paced flow and numerous pop culture and hip hop culture references. History Skoob hails from Brooklyn, New York City while Dray hails from Teaneck, New Jersey, but the two met at Virginia State University in 1988 and began performing together. Das EFX caught the attention of EPMD at a local talent show where, despite losing the competition, they did well enough to convince EPMD to sign them to a recording contract. The duo gained critical and commercial fame with the release of their landmark debut album Dead Serious, which highlighted their unusual rapping style (which they nicknamed \\"sewage\\"). Dead Serious went platinum and its lead single, \\"They Want EFX,\\" (which contains samples from James Brown's \\"Blind Man Can See It\\" and Malcolm McLaren's \\"Buffalo Gals\\") reached the top ten on the U.S. Billboard R&B; chart, the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart. Follow-up singles \\"Mic Checka\\" and \\"Straight Out the Sewer\\" did not chart on the Hot 100, but reached No. 1 and No. 3 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart, respectively. The duo also made a guest appearance on the remix of Ice Cube's smash hit single \\"Check Yo Self\\". The song reached No. 20 on the Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Rap Tracks chart. The track peaked at #36 on the UK Singles Chart in August 1993 and sold over one million copies in the U.S. As their career progressed, Das EFX's once-distinctive and unique lyrical delivery was imitated by several other artists and became more commonplace. Derailed by the popularity of their own style, the duo slowed down their fast-paced flow, eliminated the iggedy suffix and downplayed their cartoonish content on their second album, Straight Up Sewaside. Around the time of their third album Hold It Down (which was far less commercially successful than their debut release), Das EFX found themselves caught in the middle of EPMD's ugly breakup. They ended up siding with PMD (Parrish Smith), and it led to a three-year absence from recording. They returned in 1998 with the album Generation EFX and followed up in 2003 with the album How We Do; both were panned by critics. After a hiatus, the group went on an international tour with DJ Rondevu in 2006. In 2007, the duo appeared on the remix of Nas' \\"Where are They Now\\" and continued to tour the globe on a regular basis. They toured again in 2010, and continue to record and perform today to a smaller, yet devoted cult following. Influence From the time of their debut in 1992 to 1993, several elements of their style were adopted by other hip-hop artists, including Lords of the Underground, Fu- Schnickens, Kris Kross, Common and even, to a lesser extent, Public Enemy. The 1996 BLACKstreet song \\"No Diggity\\", with \\"diggity\\" meaning \\"doubt\\", bears a title phonetically identical to the track \\"No Diggedy\\" on DAS EFX's 1995 release Hold It Down. This also became a popular catchphrase at the time. Jay-Z's early style is described by Vibe as \\"a distinctly Das EFX-type, stiggety style\\" on his 12\\" single \\"Can't Get With That\\",Vibe, January 2004, Vol. 12, No. 1, published by Vibe Media Group, p. 75. although Jay-Z actually predated Das EFX with this style on the song \\"The Originator\\", alongside old school rapper Jaz-O in 1989. Some hip-hop pundits maintain that Das EFX exploited the tongue twisting style as a gimmick, and that they are erroneously credited with originating a style that was established years before their debut. Their refrain of \\"Chiggedy-check yo self before you wriggedy-wreck yo self\\" from their feature on Ice Cube's hit single \\"Check Yo Self\\" became a catchphrase in 1993. The song appeared in the videogame Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, playing on the radio station Radio Los Santos. In an episode of Beverly Hills, 90210, David Silver (played by Brian Austin Green) can be seen reciting the lyrics to \\"They Want EFX.\\" =Chappelle's Show= Comedian Dave Chappelle has made numerous references to DAS EFX's unique style and lyrics in sketches of his popular Chappelle's Show. In one sketch, a teenage Chappelle tells his girlfriend \\"I riggity-realize that I liggity-love you.\\" In another, Chappelle as President Bush announced that a country named \\"Riggity-Row\\" will join the Coalition of the willing. In yet another sketch, Chappelle as a news presenter announces the opening lyrics of \\"They Want EFX\\" as a special report.

He is best known for his appearances with World Class Championship Wrestling.  Early life  Gower was a classmate of Kerry Von Erich in high school and a longtime friend of the Von Erich family. Gower was ranked 5th in the nation in High School in 1978 in the shot put and earned a 4 year scholarship to the University of Texas at Arlington where he won the Southland Conference Shot Put title 4 times in a row. Indoor and outdoor in 1981 and 1982. He graduated from U.T.A. in 1982 and began his wrestling career.  Professional wrestling career  Gower was trained to wrestle by Texas-based Fritz Von Erich, debuting in 1979. Adias appeared, mistakenly billed as \\"Brian Adidis\\", at Starrcade 84 defeating Mister Ito. Fan magazines like Pro Wrestling Illustrated continued to list him in their regional rankings as Adidas for the next two years, but he was referred to as Adias in WCCW. Adias continued his alliance with the Von Erich family until the fall of 1986, when he turned heel against Mike Von Erich in a singles match which was Von Erich's first match back after a near-fatal bout with Toxic Shock Syndrome. In an angle very similar to the one used with Chris Adams two years before, Adias declared that he wanted to succeed on his own merits, accused the Von Erichs of holding him back, and formed an alliance sometimes called the \\"Duo of Doom\\" with Al Madril. During the feud WCCW ran an angle where Kerry Von Erich, who was Brian's classmate in high school, confronted Adias regarding his actions. Still in crutches after his 1986 motorcycle accident, Kerry was attacked by Madril with Brian standing and allowing Madril to hit Kerry with the crutch several times before Marc Lowrance managed to get Kerry out of the ring. Afterwards, Kevin Von Erich came in and launched an attack on Madril. Madril and Adias would go on to win the World Class Tag Team Championship, while continuing to feud with the Von Erichs through the summer of 1987. In one incident, Kevin collapsed during an eight-man tag match involving Adias, which would set up an angle where he would develop his version of the Oriental Spike, a move made famous by Terry Gordy, calling it the \\"Oriental Tool\\". Adias would continue his heel run into the Wild West Wrestling group but reverted to playing the babyface a few years later when the Global Wrestling Federation was launched. Adias later turned to sales work, only wrestling sporadically for the rest of the decade, before resurfacing for a while in the GWF during its run on ESPN in the early 1990s. Adias retired from wrestling completely in 2000 and is currently selling real estate and owns NTXHOMEZONE with his partner Chad Odom.

History and profile The newspaper was founded in 1974 by the journalist Indro Montanelli, together with the colleagues Enzo Bettiza, Ferenc Fejt≈ë, Raymond Aron and others, after some disagreements with the new pro-left editorial line adopted by the newspaper Corriere della Sera, where Montanelli had been one of the most important contributors. Montanelli left Corriere della Sera in 1973. The newspaper was first published on 25 June 1974 as il Giornale nuovo, with Indro Montanelli as editor and member of the publishing company board of directors and an editorial office composed of 59 journalists. The paper has a conservative stance. The paper's headquarters is in Milan. In 1977 Montanelli, in financial difficulties, accepted an offer by Silvio Berlusconi, who thus became the new owner. In 1983 the paper was renamed as il Giornale. When Berlusconi entered politics in December 1993, however, Montanelli left fearing for his own independence, and went on to found the short-lived daily newspaper La Voce. In 1992, Berlusconi left the role of the owner of il Giornale to his brother Paolo. Vittorio Feltri replaced Indro Montanelli as editor. , the publisher of the newspaper, Societ√† Europea di Edizioni, was owned by Paolo (58.3%) and Mondadori Editori (41.7% directly and indirectly). The paper was published in broadsheet format until May 2005 when it switched to tabloid format. In May 2005 il Giornale started its online version. In 2007 the monthly business magazine Espansione became a supplement of the paper. As of 2016, Societ√† Europea di Edizioni was still partially owned by Arnoldo Mondadori Editore directly for 36.90%, which is a listed company that majority owned by Fininvest. It was reported that Roberto Amodei, the owner of several sports newspaper of Italy, had interested to subscribe the capital increase of Societ√† Europea di Edizioni.

The origin of the word \\"deva\\" comes from Sanskrit. According to Theosophist Charles Webster Leadbeater, devas represent a separate evolution from that of humanity. The concept of devas as nature spirits was further developed in the writings of Theosophist Geoffrey Hodson. It is believed that there are numerous different types of devas with a population in the millions performing different functions on Earth to help the ecology function better. It is asserted they can be observed by those whose third eyes have been activated.Hodson, Geoffrey, Kingdom of the Gods. 1952. In addition, it is believed by Theosophists that there are millions of devas living inside the Sun, the indwelling solar deity of which Theosophists call the Solar Logos‚Äîthese devas are called solar angels or sometimes solar devas or solar spirits. Sometimes, it is believed, they visit Earth and can be observed, like other devas, by humans whose third eyes have been activated.Leadbeater, C.W A Textbook of Theosophy. 1912.Powell, A.E.

The solar spirits living inside the Sun are shown at the top of the chart as the most advanced life forms in our solar system. Theosophists believe that there are also devas living inside all the other stars besides Sol; these are called stellar angels. In the Findhorn material, the term refers to archetypal spiritual intelligences behind species. In other words, the group soul of a species. Some New Age sources use the term as a generic term to designate any being regarded as being composed of etheric matter--elementals, nature spirits (including the various types of nature spirits such as fairies, ondines, etc.). The pre-New Age etymology of the term is described in the article Deva (Hinduism).  References Further reading * Hodson, Geoffrey, Kingdom of the Gods. 1952.

Nicknamed \\"The Candy Man\\", he played in MLB during the years 1975‚Äì1993 for eight teams, the Pittsburgh Pirates, California Angels, New York Mets, New York Yankees, Montreal Expos, Minnesota Twins, Toronto Blue Jays, and the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Early life  Candelaria was born on November 6, 1953 to Puerto Rican parents.Society for American Baseball Research - John Candelaria He is the second of four children born to John and Felicia Candelaria. He grew up in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, New York. He frequently attended New York Yankees' games at Yankee Stadium.Escape To New York Tragedy And Trouble Have Been John Candelaria\`s Companions For Three Years. Now He\`s Ready To Leave Them Behind  Career  At the age of 15, Candelaria attended a baseball tryout where a Los Angeles Dodgers scout called him the best he had ever seen. The tryout catcher had to be replaced with a major league catcher for fear of injuring the stand-in. Candelaria played as a center in the Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN), the top tier basketball league in the Puerto Rico, for 2 seasons with the Piratas de Quebradillas in 1971 and 1972.John Candelaria BSN Statistics When he announced he was leaving the Quebradillas basketball \\"Pirates\\" for the Pittsburgh Pirates, many were skeptical. The local newspaper featured him pitching a basketball on the front page of the sports section. He had attended La Salle Academy in lower Manhattan and gained fame as a basketball center, including leading his team to a championship in 1971. Candelaria had his best season in 1977, when he was 20‚Äì5 with a 2.34 ERA in 230‚Öî innings pitched. He was also a member of the 1979 World Series champion Pirates team. On August 9, 1976, Candelaria no-hit the Los Angeles Dodgers 2‚Äì0 at Three Rivers Stadium; it was the first no-hitter pitched by a Pirate in Pittsburgh since Nick Maddox at Exposition Park in 1907.August 9, 1976 Dodgers-Pirates box score at Baseball Reference Candelaria's second post-season appearance with the Pirates (he pitched Game 3 in the 1975 NLCS) came in their 1979 World Series championship season. Candelaria started Game 1 of the 1979 NLCS and pitched seven innings of two- run ball against the Reds with a painful shoulder. The Pirates won 5‚Äì2 in 11 innings. In the 1979 World Series, Candelaria had a rough Game 3, giving up five runs in 4 innings as the Pirates lost 8‚Äì4 to the Orioles. He redeemed himself in a crucial Game 6 by combining with Kent Tekulve to pitch a 4‚Äì0 shutout. Candelaria, who stood and wielded a mid- to upper-90s fastball with natural movement, remained an effective starter for the Pirates through the 1984 season. He suffered personal tragedy on Christmas morning 1984, when his 18-month-old son John Jr. fell into the family's swimming pool at their home in Sarasota, Florida. John Jr. spent five weeks in intensive care and was then transitioned to home, where he received nursing care 24 hours per day. He was readmitted to the hospital multiple times and spent 11 months in a coma. John Jr. died in a Pittsburgh hospital on November 14, 1985. Candelaria was moved to the bullpen in 1985. In response to the change, Candelaria called general manager Harding Peterson \\"a bozo\\"; he said that the team's ownership valued its racehorses more than its baseball players. He posted nine saves out of the Pittsburgh bullpen, which ended up being a team high on a 57-win team. In early August, the team traded Candelaria to the California Angels. At the time, he was one of only two Pirates that remained from the 1979 championship team, the other being Don Robinson. The Angels immediately made him a starter again and he went 7‚Äì3 down the stretch in 1985 and helped the Angels into the 1986 ALCS with a 10‚Äì2 record. Candelaria later said that the trade to a contending team had been a positive change for him. Candelaria played for both New York teams (Mets and Yankees), both Los Angeles teams (Dodgers and Angels) and both Canadian teams (Blue Jays and Expos). He finished his career back where it started in Pittsburgh in 1993, making him the only Pirates player from the 1979 team to play for the Pirates during their twenty consecutive losing seasons. Personal life Candelaria currently lives in North Carolina, and is an avid world traveler. John has a nephew, Zac Candelaria, who played catcher at the Division One program of Fairfield University.

He usually played as a striker. He is currently the head of technical committee of Esteghlal. Early life Rowshan was 13 when he joined Taj youth team. He initially faced many problems, such as his house being far from the Taj training ground in Nazi Abad. His father used to accompany him to the Taj football and training grounds. His father would either wait for Hassan to finish training, carefully watching his moves or given half a chance would joined in a senior matches when the eldest fancied a game of football. During their long trip back home, Hassan's father would always talk football to him, never tiring from the subject and always willing to advise and offer tips on how to improve his game and skills. Rowshan's first success came at the school's football championship. While in the sixth grade at Pasargad Shemiran school, he was a member of the school football team. He experienced the sweet taste of championship at that early age, and thought of future championship and grand occasions. Although the championship was sweet at school level, Rowshan did not seriously consider playing this level of football anything other than a pastime and filling the gap. His first taste of real football came when a visiting Brazilian youth team was in town for a friendly match. 20 thousand spectators were at Amjadieh Stadium eager to observe and enjoy some Brazilian magic. Somehow the trainer decided to give young Rowshan an opportunity to play the last 20 minutes. This was by all means a very difficult experience for a youngster who never played in front of more than a dozen people. His fear of the crowd and the immense pressure he felt, could not be overcome and the team lost the match, 2‚Äì1. Like many Iranians of his generation, Hassan was born in a family of football fans. His father bought him his own plastic ball, so that he would not bother them while playing football. Hassan played in the neighborhood, and during one of the matches with SaadAbad team, he was approached by Homayoun Behzadi, a national team forward of that time, who whispered to him \\"You are a complete player\\". Later, Behzadi recruited Rowshan for Sharq, a team playing in the third division of Tehran league. His contribution to this team was not too successful and the team failed to gain promotion to the second division and subsequently it was disbanded. Since little Rowshan tasted competitive football, he was determined to join a club in the league rather than going back to street football. In 1969 Rowshan joined Taj club (known today as Esteghlal Tehran), one of the two big clubs of Iran. =Club success= Rowshan with Taj Rowshan was quickly becoming a household name in Iran. With his club, Taj Tehran, he won many championship and trophies. He first broke into the Taj side when he was 17 years old and played his first season in Takht Jamshid Cup. He won the Iranian league in 1975 and reached the second place in 1974. Further he won the Hazfi Cup in 1977. After the World Cup 1978, although Hasan Rowshan had limited playing time in Argentina, the scouts from several countries discovered his potential and send representations to his club in order to recruit him. Rowshan settled for UAE and in particular Al-Ahli club of Dubai. Jointly with his national teammate, Hassan Nazari, they won the championship for Al Ahli in 1980. From 1982 to 1983 he joined Esteghlal F.C. again for a few games. In 1984, Roshan rejoined Esteghlal F.C. again, where he could win the Tehran Province League in 1985. =National team success= However, the highlights of his career were winning the football tournament of the Asian Games in Tehran in 1974 and Asian Cup 1976 in Tehran as well as reaching the quarterfinals of the Summer Olympics in Montreal in 1976 and winning the qualification for the World Cup finals in Argentina 1978. During the Asian qualification games, Rowshan excelled. His goals and assists was a major contribution to the success of the team and eventual qualification. This success did not come easy, as his constant runs and skills in maneuvering and dribbling made him a target for some rough tackles, he missed some games due to a serious and long lasting knee injury. His injury after the qualification games were a major problem for coach Heshmat Mohajerani. When Iran played its first game, Rowshan was doubtful. However, he didn't even play one single full game and scored the only goal for Iran in a 4-1 loss to Peru. After the World Cup 1978, many critics in Iran indicated that if Iran had a fully fit Rowshan, the results would have been much better than what was achieved. Coaching career He was appointed as the Technical Manager for Iran national under-20 football team in 2005, however he resigned later. =Football School= When he returned to Iran in the 90s, he formed a top quality football school for kids which was a huge success. Hassan Rowshan Football School was the first academic football school in Middle East. =Return to Esteghlal= Hassan Rowshan became the head of Esteghlal's Football Academy on 6 August 2007. It's understood that he offered a new Football development system based on Aston Villa's academy, but head of Iran's Sports organization Mr.Ali Abadi & Fatholahzadeh refused to provide the required budget (150K USD per year). Iranian press revealed that Hassan Rowshan tried to fight the powerful insider relationships of the club but he resigned later in 2008. Alireza Mansourian took over the Academy. On 15 July 2011, he was appointed as head of technical committee of Esteghlal by Ali Fathollahzadeh succeeding Nasser Hejazi.

He later re-emerges to fight alongside the Swamp Thing against the combined forces of the Metal, the Gray/Fungi and the Rot. He fights the Avatar of the Gray, resulting in both of their deaths. Powers and abilities In his original form, Jason Woodrue had advanced knowledge of botany, which he used to accelerate plant growth. After becoming the Floronic Man, Woodrue gains the ability to merge with and mentally control plant life. After eating the 'organs' of the Swamp Thing, this power expanded to allow Woodrue to control all of the world's plants for a time, but he lost this power after the Swamp Thing forced him to recognize that destroying the humans and animals would also destroy the plants. In other mediaTelevision= * A character loosely based on Jason Woodrue's Plant Master appearance appears in an episode of the \\"Atom\\" segment of The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure called \\"The Plant Master\\", voiced by Ted Knight. Straal is a scientist who has discovered a way to use wave patterns with plant growths. When a plane carrying members of Ivy University science faculty lands on his island as part of a plan to establish a research center, the Plant Master uses his special plants to knock them out and have his henchmen capture them. When the Atom arrives, he takes out the Plant Master's henchmen before being captured by the Plant Master and his pet cat. The Plant Master then places the Atom in a container where he is strangled by living grass that the Plant Master activated. With some unknowing help from the Plant Master's cat, the Atom was able to defeat the Plant Master, where he and his henchmen are arrested by the Coast Guard. * Dr. Woodrue is referenced several times in the 1990s Swamp Thing television series. In this incarnation, he is a scientist that is a rival of Dr. Arcane. He invented some sort of method to \\"grow\\" human life by artificial means. * In The Flash episode \\"The Flash of Two Worlds\\", the Sand Demon captures Patty Spivot and brings her to a place called the \\"Woodrue Greenhouse\\", referencing the Floronic Man. * Kevin Durand portrays Dr. Woodrue in the DC Universe series Swamp Thing. This version of him is a scientist who is married and seeks to use the swamp of Marais properties for his own needs to cure his wife Carolyn's Alzheimer's disease. He soon finds himself drawn to the emergence of the Swamp Thing thanks to his work with Avery Sunderland backing him. When at the Conclave facility, Woodrue deduces and reveals to him that he is not Alec Holland but a humanoid plant that absorbed Holland's memories after the explosion that killed Holland. After the Swamp Thing is freed by Abby Arcane and Liz Tremayne with some help from Blue Devil, Woodrue escapes with organs. Later, he experiments on himself, eating the remains of the Swamp Thing to try before having Carolyn eat, but is interrupted by Abby and arrested by Marias police. In the episode \\"Loose Ends\\", Woodrue experiments on himself in his latest plan to save his wife. In the post-credits scene, Matt Cable encounters Woodrue in a broken cell surrounded by plants, and Woodrue is transformed into the Floronic Man as he attacks Matt. =Film= Jason Woodrue, played by John Glover, as seen in Batman & Robin. * An unmutated Jason Woodrue appears in the 1997 film Batman & Robin, portrayed by John Glover.

Traces of the training facilities can still be seen. Under circumstances which remain unclear, the members of the group mutinied and went to Seoul in 1971, where they were killed or committed suicide. Blue House Raid On January 21, 1968, a group of 31 North Korean military soldiers were sent to South Korea by Kim Il-sung to kill President Park Chung-hee. A firefight began when the commandos were just 800 yards from the Blue House (the South Korean Presidential Palace). In all, 68 South Koreans were killed and 66 were wounded, including about two dozen civilians. Three Americans also died defending South Korea's president, and three were wounded. Unit 684 In response to the attempted assassination of Park Chung-hee, South Korea began training Unit 684, to infiltrate North Korea and kill Kim Il-sung. The assassination mission was subsequently cancelled. On 23 August 1971, for reasons which remain unclear, the members of Unit 684 revolted, killing most of their guards and making their way to the mainland, where they hijacked a bus to Seoul. The bus was stopped by the Army in Daebang-dong, Yeongdeungpo- gu, Seoul and 20 members of the Unit on board were shot or committed suicide with hand grenades. The four survivors were sentenced to death by a military tribunal and executed on 10 March 1972. Film Silmido is well-known today as the principal setting of the 2003 film of the same name, which is based on the true story of Unit 684. Thanks to the film's success, the island has become a fairly popular tourist destination.

The UN General Assembly adopted this resolution on 1 February 1952 during its sixth session after the Republic of China complained to the United Nations against the Soviet Union.  Historical background  The Empire of Japan invaded Manchuria (Northeast part of the former Qing Empire, not part of the Core China, occupied by Chinese in 1922) in 1931 and established Manchukuo in 1932. The Republic of China protested the Japanese invasion and the League of Nations voted 42-1 (only Japan voted against) to pass the Lytton Report to demand Manchuria be returned to China, but Japan refused to comply and left the League of Nations. China neither recognized Manchukuo nor was able to recover Manchuria. In World War II, one Soviet precondition for a declaration of war against Japan was an American recognition of Mongolian independence from China, and a recognition of Soviet interests in the Manchurian railways and Port Arthur; these were agreed without Chinese representation or consent. The Soviet threat of seizing parts of Inner Mongolia induced China to recognize Outer Mongolia's independence, provided that a referendum be held. The referendum took place on 20 October 1945, with (according to official numbers) 100% of the electorate voting for independence. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, both countries confirmed their mutual recognition on 6 October 1949. In line with the concluding statement of the Yalta Conference and to receive the southern part of Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands after the defeat of Japan, Soviet Union immediately fought against Japan. Later, the USSR and the Republic of China signed the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance with the Republic of China on 14 August 1945. However, the National Government of the Republic of China believed the Soviet Union violated the treaty because it obstructed the efforts of the Republic of China to re-establish national authority in Manchuria and aided the Communist Party of China by giving it weapons surrendered by the Japanese Imperial Army. Additionally, the Soviet Union handed territorial control to the Chinese Communist Party in that area against United States Marines aided military dispatchment and installation of Nationalist Government in North East China during the early period of Chinese Civil War after 1945. In 1949, the Communist Party of China won the Chinese Civil War, resulting in the establishment of the People's Republic of China on 1 October 1949. The Kuomintang government of the Republic of China was forced to retreat to Taiwan, where it continued to maintain itself as the sole legitimate government of all China and declared the Communist government to be illegitimate. With the support of the Western bloc amid the Cold War, the Republic of China was able to retain the seat of China in the United Nations despite having lost so much territory to the Communists. In 1952, the Republic of China filed a complaint to the United Nations against the Soviet Union, which it resented for aiding the Communists in the Civil War. The UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 505 to condemn the Soviet Union, with 25 countries supporting the resolution, 9 countries opposing it, 24 countries abstaining, and 2 countries not voting.UNBISnet: Voting Record Search: A/RES/505(VI)  Later development  On 24 February 1953, the Legislative Yuan of the Republic of China abolished the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and refused to recognize the independence of the Mongolian People's Republic. The Republic of China considered Resolution 505 a diplomatic victory, even though the hope of recovering of mainland China and Mongolia grew increasingly dimmer as time went by. The Republic of China vetoed the Mongolian bid for UN membership in 1955, but pressure from the Soviet bloc, Third World states and non-aligned states eventually forced the Republic of China to stop blocking Mongolia, so Mongolia joined the UN in 1961 in exchange for the Republic of China's seat to be retained by votes in the General Assembly in the same year at that time. On 21 May 2012, the Mainland Affairs Council released a press release saying that Outer Mongolia is not a part of the Republic of China,ÊúâÈóúÂ§ñËíôÂè§ÊòØÂê¶ÁÇ∫‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúãÈ†òÂúüÂïèÈ°åË™™ÊòéÊñ∞ËÅûÂèÉËÄÉË≥áÊñô whilst the Constitutional Court of the Republic of China (regarding interpretation of the Republic of China constitution) and the Republic of China's Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission remained neutral on the Mongolian issue.

Career In the early and mid-1960s, John Sutton began to get to know several wrestlers while working as an usher in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He eventually landed a job as a security guard for the American Wrestling Association (AWA). In 1973, he met Paul Vachon when he went to work at Grand Prix Wrestling (GPW) in Montreal. At GPW, Sutton worked as a manager and an occasional wrestler. He also refereed for a time. Sutton began managing the Hollywood Blonds after they split with their manager, Johnny Rougeau. Both Don Jardine and Dale Hey are credited with coming up with the name \\"Sir Oliver Humperdink\\". Jardine claims to have come up with the name, believing it would draw heat from francophone fans in Quebec who hated anything English. In 1974, Humperdink went to Florida Championship Wrestling and was put into an angle with Mike Graham and Kevin Sullivan. Two years later, he began working with the Hollywood Blondes once again. In 1980 Humperdink became Dusty Rhodes' servant for thirty days after his protege Ivan Koloff lost a match to Rhodes with that stipulation. During the thirty days, Lord Alfred Hayes began managing Humperdink's proteges such as Bobby Jaggers and Nikolai Volkoff. When \\"Rooster\\" Humperdink (as Rhodes had nicknamed him), who had become a figure of sympathy during his thirty days' servitude, returned to management and attempted to claim back Jaggers, Hayes and Volkoff brutally beat on him, thus starting a feud with Hayes. He worked for the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA)'s Jim Crockett Promotions in the 1980s where he managed Greg Valentine, Leroy Brown, Paul Jones and The One Man Gang. He left the company in 1983 but returned five years later shortly before the company was bought out by Ted Turner and became World Championship Wrestling. While still in the NWA, he formed a stable known as the \\"House of Humperdink\\". As a singles wrestler, he held the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship and NWA Central States Television Championship. In 1987, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) approached Humperdink and offered him a job. As a part of the WWF, he managed Bam Bam Bigelow. That same year, he also began managing Paul Orndorff during his feud with Rick Rude. His gimmick was that of a face, but Sutton did not like the gimmick off-screen. He managed the duo during the first-ever Survivor Series in a match that they lost when Bigelow was pinned by Andr√© the Giant. Humperdink also managed Bigelow during WrestleMania IV when he lost in the first round of a WWF Championship tournament. When he returned to the NWA in 1988, he managed The New Wild Samoans (Fatu, Samu, and The Samoan Savage). He also returned to the side of Bigelow in his feud with Barry Windham in a match at Starrcade. He worked for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in the early 1990s as \\"Big Daddy Dink\\", a biker-type gimmick. In WCW, he managed The Fabulous Freebirds (Michael Hayes and Jimmy Garvin). Off-screen, Sutton hated his new gimmick and WCW's office politics. He retired in 1993. In 1995 he returned to manage Bob Orton Jr. and The Hangmen in the American Wrestling Federation. Personal life In the 1960s, Sutton was in a car crash and nearly died when he hit a snow bank. After recovering from the incident, his health deteriorated. In 2001, he went through surgery to replace his aortic valve in Key West. He was equipped with a pacemaker and made a full recovery. The Cauliflower Alley Club, whose conventions he attended every year, helped pay for some of his medical expenses. Sutton returned to the hospital in 2008 after heart troubles complicated a case of pneumonia. In early 2011, it was announced that Sutton was diagnosed with cancer of the bladder. He entered a hospice having refused chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Sutton died early on the morning of March 20, 2011, of complications from pneumonia and cancer at the age of 62. Sutton never married or had children.

PepsiCo's other drink brands, including Mountain Dew and Gatorade, also have a variety of famous spokespersons. The most famous spokespeople for Pepsi are the brothers and belles of Harding University Social Club Theta. History Celebrities have been paid to advertise for Pepsi products. =United States= Joan Crawford was married to PepsiCo president Alfred Steele from 1955 to 1959 (his death), and was advertising executive and board of directors member from 1959 to 1973. During the 1960s, Joanie Sommers sang two popular commercial songs (\\"It's Pepsi, for those who think young\\" and \\"Now you see it, now you don't, oh, Diet Pepsi\\") for Pepsi-Cola that were run in commercials and for which she came to be often referred to as \\"The Pepsi Girl.\\" In 1974 Joseph Nicoletti, then of Brooklyn N.Y., now a music-film consultant based in Laguna Beach, California, sang and produced the theme \\"You're Drinking Diet Pepsi and it Shows.\\" Hal Linden (Barney Miller) did the voice-over and it was a BBD&O; hit Commercial. Nicoletti was signed by legendary ad man Phil Dusenberry. Inducted into the Advertising Hall of Fame, Dusenberry co-wrote the script for the motion picture \\"The Natural,\\" with Roger Towne. Dusenberry said Nicoletti was one of the best singing Voices in the business. In 1984, Michael Jackson signed a contract with Pepsi that produced many commercials and world tours through 1993. During the 1989 Grammy Awards telecast, Pepsi and Puerto Rican singer Chayanne was featured in the first advertising spot in Spanish to be broadcast on national television without dubbing or subtitles. In the early 1990s, Ray Charles was the star of a Diet Pepsi campaign called \\"You Got the Right One, Baby,\\" which was also known as \\"Uh-huh.\\" During the late 1990s the Spice Girls became the face of Pepsi with the tagline ‚ÄúGeneration Next,‚Äù inspired by their song Move Over from their album Spiceworld. Promotion included TV commercials, CD singles for the promo single \\"Step to Me,\\" and collectible cans and glasses with each Spice Girl on a different can or cup. In 2001, Britney Spears became a spokesperson for Pepsi. During her contract Spears did many commercials including ones for the World Cup and other major events. Spears' contract concluded with an advertisement with Pink, Beyonc√© Knowles, and Enrique Iglesias. The ad was made featuring the cover of the song \\"We Will Rock You\\" by Queen set in a Roman gladiator arena. In 2004, Beyonc√©, Jennifer Lopez, and David Beckham all starred together in a commercial for the brand, featuring the two singers as assassin-like characters. In 2005, Christina Aguilera was signed to promote the popular drink (she had previously promoted Coca-Cola in 2000). The campaign featuring Aguilera was released in 2006, but not in the United States. Some commercials featured singer Elissa, and some with Aguilera by herself. PepsiCo said in a recent interview that Christina Aguilera has that 'dare for more' approach. Aretha Franklin was also a spokesperson in 1998. In 1999 Janet Jackson signed on to the original \\"Ask For More\\" campaign which featured a song of the same name written and sung by Jackson. In 2006, PepsiCo and Motorola launched the \\"Cool Tones\\" campaign. It featured Mariah Carey, Mary J. Blige and The All American Rejects writing and performing ringtones that could be obtained by purchasing a Pepsi bottle. The artists also filmed commercials for the campaign in which they performed their original ringtones. In 2012, Beyonc√© was signed once again to promote Pepsi. This campaign was her fifth for the soft drink since 2002 ‚Äî and her face was on a limited-edition line of soda cans. The multiyear campaign was estimated at $50 million, the bulk of it for media placements and promotions around the world, and the remainder split roughly equally between Beyonc√©‚Äôs fee and what Pepsi called a creative content development fund. Nicki Minaj signed a promotional deal with Pepsi in February 2012. A commercial was released which included her hit single, \\"Moment 4 Life\\", on Sunday, May 6 at approximately 6:06 pm. NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon was sponsored by Pepsi starting in 1997. The company sponsored Gordon in the Busch Series for two seasons. Since 2001, Pepsi has served as sponsor for Gordon in at least two races per season. In 2013, New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees and musical group One Direction co-starred in a Pepsi commercial. In 2017, model and television personality Kendall Jenner starred in a commercial premiering the week of April 1 which caused much controversy over social media. =Europe and the United Kingdom= For the 1988 and 1989 seasons, Pepsi was the title sponsor of Suzuki's effort in motorcycle road racing's premier class, Grand Prix 500cc. The Pepsi livery was a new addition to grand prix motorcycling, and a change from tobacco sponsors. During 1988-9, Suzuki also produced a number of road going replicas of the GP bikes, emblazoned with the same Pepsi signage as the works bikes. Due to the livery's association with one of Suzuki's riders, the Texan, Kevin Schwantz, riders today are still producing their own replicas as tribute. In 1998, the group Spice Girls have been spokeswomen in the international campaign. The ad was featuring the song \\"Move Over (Generation Next)\\". Since 2001, Sakis Rouvas has been a spokesperson in the Greek and Balkan campaign under contract with the headquarters of United Kingdom, being the only Greek artist to have ever been proposed to represent the brand. Since summer 2009, Inna is the spokeswoman in Romania, Moldova and secondly in Bulgaria, Hungary and Serbia. She promoted Pepsi mostly in Romania, Moldova and Bulgaria through TV commercials and internet adverts. Some commercials have been translated from Romanian into Bulgarian or even Hungarian. =Latin America= In Latin America, Colombian artists Shakira, and Juanes; Dominican Sammy Sosa, and Puerto Rican Daddy Yankee have promoted the soft drink. Spanish-speaking Jaci Velasquez did some commercials. In 2007 RBD promoted the drink in their home country of Mexico. =Asia= As for Asia, celebrity and singers Show Lo, Leslie Cheung, Jay Chou, Aaron Kwok, Jolin Tsai, Ivy, Rain, Derrick Hamilton, Louis Koo, Nicholas Tse, F4, Faye Wong, Jennylyn Mercado, Kelly Chan, Momo Wu, Bamboo Ma√±alac, Eraserheads, Jericho Rosales, Matteo Guidicelli, Nicole Hernandez, Jackson Wang, Jao Mapa, Daniel Padilla and Julia Barretto have appeared in several different advertisements. In Pakistan, Pepsi sponsors the Pakistan cricket team and many Pakistani celebrities and personalities have been spokespersons for the brand including Hadiqa Kiani, Junaid Jamshed, Shoaib Akhtar, Bob Woolmer, Younus Khan, Kamran Akmal, Adnan Sami, Reema Khan, Call, and Vital Signs. In India, Pepsi first used Aamir Khan, model turned actress Mahima Chaudhary and model and ex-Miss World Aishwariya Rai to promote its product. Later it used Amitabh Bachchan, Shahrukh Khan, Kajol, Rani Mukherjee, Saif Ali Khan, Fardeen Khan, Akshay Kumar, Shahid Kapoor (before he entered the movie world), Preity Zinta, John Abraham, Pawan Kalyan, Ram Charan Teja, Priyanka Chopra, and Kareena Kapoor as well as the national cricket team. Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone were signed for Pepsi's Youngistan campaign which targeted the youth. =Australia= In Australia, the trend has been to use local Australian celebrities to promote Pepsi including Kylie Minogue, Jennifer Hawkins (Miss Universe 2004), Holly Valance, Harry Kewell, Delta Goodrem, Mark Philippoussis and several others including New Zealander Sonny Bill Williams  Troubled endorsers  Pepsi has had a notorious association with spokespersons, primarily popstars, over the last 25 years. * The first international popstar to become a spokesperson for the drink was Michael Jackson, who along with his brothers (The Jackson 5) advertised Pepsi for \\"the new generation\\" in an advertisement featuring a reworking of his song \\"Billie Jean\\". However, when filming a second advertisement in 1984, a pyrotechnics stunt went wrong and badly burnt Jackson. * In 1987, David Bowie and Tina Turner joined forces to advertise the soft drink, in an advertisement featuring a reworking of Bowie's hit \\"Modern Love.\\" The company also agreed to sponsor Bowie's 1987 Glass Spider World Tour. Bowie was accused of sexual assault shortly afterwards, and the company dropped the advertisements immediately. Two years later, Pepsi's attempts to make Madonna a new Pepsi spokesperson ended with the infamous \\"Like a Prayer\\" incident when Madonna's video brought charges of anti- Catholicism to the company. * In August 2002, Pepsi pulled a national, 30-second commercial featuring multiplatinum rapper Ludacris from the air after Fox's Bill O'Reilly called for a boycott of the soft drink company. O'Reilly characterized Pepsi as \\"immoral\\" for using the rapper, whom he described as a \\"rap thug.\\" O'Reilly referenced several of Ludacris's lyrics, which he said emphasized a lifestyle that included getting intoxicated, selling drugs, fighting people, and degrading women. The issue resurfaced when Pepsi began to run ads with The Osbournes, a move that Russell Simmons, head of the Hip Hop Summit Action Network categorized as racially insensitive. The company maintained that Ludacris was an inappropriate spokesman because of his usage of language, but Simmons and the HHSAN contended that the Osbournes use of language was just as unacceptable. The final accord reached between the two parties had Pepsi make an annual contribution of $1 million to the Ludacris Foundation (an organization that helps middle and high school students motivate themselves in creative arts) for three years. In addition, the HHSAN helped Pepsi find other community-based organizations to support. Simmons made it clear that he would not accept any money for any charitable organization that he was involved in. While Pepsi offered to shoot a new series of ads on hip-hop history with Ludacris, the rapper declined and additionally stated through Simmons that he did not want his previous ads to re-air. * According to allhiphop.com, in 2005, a rumor spread that the newest spokesperson for Pepsi, Kanye West, was dropped after a comment made against President George W. Bush. Nicole Bradley, public relations manager of Pepsi, clarified that the company's relationship with West had not changed and their marketing will continue as planned.

Born in Selma to a German immigrant father, Keipp began taking photographs as a hobby when she was 16. When she went to nursing school in the Northeast she began exhibiting the photographs she took during her summers at home in Alabama's Black Belt. After graduating, she returned to Selma in 1904 and began her career as a Nurse anesthetist at King Memorial and Selma Baptist Hospitals. With no outlet to exhibit her work locally, the photographs were kept among her private belongings and not seen again until they were donated after her death to the Selma Depot Museum by her nephew's family. Keipp's photographs depict rural African Americans going about their normal routines in the Reconstruction South. Typical subjects include laundresses, nannies, field hands, and children at play.

The program allows participants to skip normal schooling and become full-time, degree-seeking college students. Although there are a number of early college entry programs, EEP is the only one of its kind in the United States in promoting a direct transitional scheme from middle and high school to college without intermediary remedial education. Recently, EEP has attracted national media attention. Applicants to EEP generally come from the Greater Los Angeles Area, but some come from all over the United States as well as international locales.  Assistant Director (formerly Director)  The Director of the Early Entrance Program is in charge of all of EEP's operations. This position can be compared to a combination of an American high school principal and an academic advisor/counselor. The former Director (until Spring 2018) was Richard Maddox, EdD, who has his doctorate from the University of Southern California (USC) in Educational Psychology. Maddox is responsible for the current EEP design, and has been the director of the Program since the 1995-1996 academic year. He has also encouraged EEP publicity, projecting it to nationally recognized status. Presently, EEP is under the jurisdiction of the Director of the Honors College, with an EEP Assistant Director overseeing daily operations. The current Assistant Director is Dr. Andrea Arias, EdD who has her doctorate from Pepperdine University.  Application Process  Every year, approximately 100-500 gifted students from all over the United States apply to EEP. However, each fall, only 20-35 applicants are admitted, after being screened by the ACT (American College Test) or the SAT and undergoing a rigorous assessment period taking college- level courses during the \\"Honors Academy\\". The screening test was formerly the WPCT (the Washington Pre-College Test). =American College TestAbout the ACT An EEP applicant's first step is taking the American College Test OR the SAT. The ACT is a standardized test for high school achievement and college admissions in the United States produced by ACT, Inc. It was first administered in fall 1959 by Everett Franklin Lindquist as a competitor to the College Board's Scholastic Aptitude Test, now the SAT Reasoning Test. Some students who perform poorly on the SAT find that they perform better on the ACT and vice versa. The ACT test has historically consisted of four tests: English, Math, Reading, and Science reasoning. In February 2005, an optional writing test was added to the ACT, mirroring changes to the SAT that took place later in March of the same year. All four-year colleges and universities in the U.S. accept the ACT, but different institutions place different emphases on standardized tests such as the ACT, compared to other factors of evaluation such as class rank, G.P.A., and extracurricular activities. If the ACT is taken at one of two annual testings administered at CSULA, the applicant does not complete the writing portion. The applicants to CSULA's PACE program also take this test. To qualify for the EEP, an applicant must score 23 or higher on the Math section and 24 or higher on the English section. To qualify with the SAT the applicant must score above a 510 on both the Critical Reading and Math sections. Taking the ACT Each school year, the ACT is held in December and April at California State University. EEP is in charge of organizing and proctoring these two testings. EEPsters volunteer to assist in the administration of the exam. On average, approximately three hundred fifty students take the ACT in December and four hundred students in April. The location for both testings is Martin Luther King Hall at CSULA. Some years, when there are fewer applicants (i.e. 2009), there is only one testing. ACT Scores Scores for the ACT are mailed to the home of students usually one to two weeks after the date of the test. similar to the SAT, the maximum score of each portion of the test is 36. To quality for application to EEP, the student must have a minimum of 23 points in Mathematics and 22 points in the English section. After these requirements are met, ACT scores have no influence over the application process. In other words, an applicant to EEP with a score of 33 will have no advantage over another student who scored 25. =First Provisional Interview= The first step of applying to the Early Entrance Program (after passing the Washington Pre-College Test) is scheduling an interview with the Early Entrance Program Director. At this interview, prospective candidates are informed briefly about the application process and the Pre-Summer Orientation. Most students pass the interview. =Provisional Family Orientation= Every prospective student (formerly referred to as \\"Provisionals\\" or \\"Provies\\") is required to attend an orientation with every other candidate for the program, as well as parents. This orientation usually occurs in late May and is coordinated by the EEP Director. Students at this orientation receive information about the various aspects of the summer application process. =Provisional Summer Semester= The Provisional Summer Quarter is both an evaluation process and a taste of what EEP life is like for all Provisional students. Provies must take 2 academic classes at CSULA and maintain a minimum 3.0 GPA for the summer quarter (which spans approximately 6 weeks). Provisionals also are encouraged to spend time in the EEP Lounge (King Hall D140-142) interacting with other provisionals and regular students. There are three Provisional Freshmen Orientations that take place during the summer quarter. Unlike the Pre-Summer Orientation, these orientations are for provisional students without their parents. At the beginning of the summer during these meetings, every provisional selects a Mentor Group. Mentors are regular students in the program that volunteer to help Provies with the summer application process by assisting and assessing them. =Advancement to Candidacy= Around the sixth to seventh week of the provisional semester, anywhere from 25 to 40 students who are strong candidates for the program are advanced to EEP candidacy status, contingent on University entrance. These students are then admitted to the EEP and begin classes at CSULA in the following Fall semester.  The Students of EEP  There are approximately 120 students in the Early Entrance Program, known as \\"EEPsters\\". As in American high schools, EEPsters in their first year at EEP are referred to as \\"Freshmen\\", or more commonly, continue to be referred to as Provies, second year as \\"Sophomores\\", third year as \\"Juniors\\", and fourth year and above as \\"Seniors\\" or \\"Elders\\". Although EEP is designed to be a five-year program, some students stay in EEP more than or less than five years to earn their degree. After three years students are promoted to the status of Elders which may be equated to the upperclassman of high school environments. EEPsters are an eclectic (and eccentric) group of adolescents, and are derived from a variety of social, ethnic, and economical backgrounds. These varied personalities all contribute to a unique environment often considered a social asylum for most applicants from the typical education environment. =Adjusting to University Life= Although initial concerns regarding adjustment run rampant, several intermediary steps are taken to ensure a smooth transition from a secondary school setting to university life. EEPsters on campus share a common abode in the affectionately dubbed Lounge, or 'EEP room', which, for the initial years, serves as a social hive in which EEPsters can work, socialize, or merely relax. This, in addition to the relatively small and exclusive nature of the program, results in a close-knit consequence of 'everybody-knowing-everybody' and certainly never a paucity of human interaction‚Äîor dull moments. Additional preparatory steps have been taken in recent years, including the addition of a Study Hall to freshmen curricula. All EEP students are supported by a full-time staff, which consist of a Student Counselor and a Student Assistant. Ultimately, with the aid of a familial environment and the omnipresence of guidance from EEP Elders, most freshmen adjust quickly to collegiate life. Elder EEPsters usually work to expand their social schemata, and become active participants in university life, assimilating inconspicuously into roles of community service, organizations, and student governments. =EEPsters and CSULA= The EEPsters have great opportunities and are encouraged to socialize with each other and other university students. In fact, they have participated greatly in many of CSULA's on-campus clubs and organizations including General Education Honors Club, Associated Students Incorporated (ASI Student Governance) and multiple research laboratories. EEP Club Founded several years ago by EEP students, the Early Entrance Program Club (EEP Club) serves as a student government for the EEP population. EEP Club sponsors free tutoring for all EEPsters and coordinates various social events as well. =Previous Administrations= EEP Club has flourished over the past 11 years under the leadership of Harry B., Jackson V., Herbert L., Andrew P., Pam L., Cory O., Margaret L., Millie G., John S., Jaquelyn Y., Adrian B., Grant J., Samuel H., Andre L., Paolo A., Lily N., John L., and Patty G. =Current Administration= The current Administration consists of: President: Amanda T.

This bacterium affects plants, particularly types of maize such as sweet, flint, dent, flower, and popcorn. The disease is also known as bacterial wilt or bacterial leaf blight and has shown to be quite problematic in sweet corn. The disease is endemic in the mid-Atlantic and Ohio River Valley regions and in the southern portion of the Corn Belt. Hosts and symptoms Stewart's wilt can be a serious disease of many corn types, including: sweet, dent, flint, flower, and popcorn. Sweet corn and popcorn cultivars are more susceptible to Stewart's wilt than field (dent) corn, but some dent corn inbreds and hybrids are susceptible. The production of virulence factor can be caused by the communication system between the bacteria known as quorum sensing. Stewart's wilt causes yield reductions by decreasing the size of corn stand or by limiting its production, resulting in fewer and smaller ears of corn. The disease is seen in parts of Arkansas, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. Its occurrence in other eastern and Stewart‚Äôs wilt has two phases of symptoms: the wilt phase and the leaf blight phase. For both phases, symptoms first appear as leaf lesions, initiating from corn flea beetle feeding scars. At first, the leaf lesions appear long and irregularly shaped and are light green to yellow and later on, straw colored. On mature plants, yellowish streaks with wavy margins extend along the leaf veins. This leaf blight phase is often prevalent after tasseling and the symptoms look similar to frost damage, drought, nutrient disorders, northern corn leaf blight (caused by Exserohilum turcicum), and particularly Goss's wilt (caused by Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. nebraskensis). A good way to determine if the corn is facing symptoms from Stewart's wilt is to look at the leaf tissue under microscope. If the bacterial ooze exhibits nonflagellated, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacteria, the likelihood of Stewart's wilt is great. The corn flea beetle feeds on corn leaf tissue and then transmits the P. stewartii bacterium into the plant. When large populations of corn flea beetles are feeding, skeletonization of leaves and death of seedlings can occur. In most cases, the wilt phase occurs on seedlings, but for certain corn types (i.e. sweet corn), more mature plants can wilt. The wilt phase is systemic, meaning the majority of the plant is infected via bacterial movement and colonization of the plant's vascular system. When the bacterium spreads within the plant, leaves begin withering and can die. Plants become stunted and at times, the whole plant may wilt and die. Dwarfed, bleached tassels are common. Often, plants that have wilt symptoms also have leaf blight symptoms. When the bacteria reach the corn stalks, the vascular bundles become brown and necrotic. A good indicator of whether or not the bacteria have infected the stalks is if yellow masses of bacteria are oozing from the vascular bundles. With certain sweet- corn hybrids, yellow, slimy ooze collects on the inner ear husks and/or covers the corn kernels. The kernels may also have grayish lesions with dark margins or they may be irregular in shape and dwarfed. Another common symptom of the bacteria is formation of open cavities within the stalk tissue. While the plants are weak and vulnerable, stalk rot fungi can further invade the corn plant.Integrated Pest Management ‚Äì Stewart's Wilt and Blight of Sweet Corn Disease cycle Chaetocnema pulicaria, the primary vector for P. stewartii, overwinters as adults and begins feeding on corn seedlings early in the spring. The bacterium overwinters in the gut of the adult corn flea beetles. Warmer winter temperatures allow for greater beetle survival and in effect, higher populations in the spring. Emerging beetles in the spring transmit the bacteria into corn leaf tissue through feeding. The corn flea beetles wound the leaf and contaminate the wounds with insect frass (excrement), which additionally contains the bacteria. Once the bacteria are inside the plant, they multiply and fill the xylem and intercellular spaces of the leaves. The degree of multiplication is highly dependent on susceptibility of the cultivar. Highly susceptible plants become systemically infected and face symptoms such as stunting, wilting, and death. In less severe cases, a plant may show long and irregularly shaped leaf lesions. Some genotypes are able to greatly restrict pathogenic growth. In such plants, the leaf lesions are short, insignificant, or may even be nonexistent. In certain corn varieties, kernels can be infected later in the growing season after flowering occurs. Although corn kernels can be a source of inoculum, seed transmission is quite rare. Environment and control The number of flea beetles emerging in spring from hibernation depends on the severity of winter temperatures. Warm winter temperatures favor the survival of flea beetle vectors and increase the risk of Stewart‚Äôs disease. The numbers of emerging adults can be estimated by calculating a winter temperature index by averaging the mean temperatures (expressed in ¬∞F) for December, January, and February. If the sum of the mean temperatures is 90 ¬∞F or greater, the beetles will survive in high numbers and the disease risk is high; if the sum is between 85¬∞ and 90¬∞, the risk is moderate to high; 80¬∞ to 85¬∞, moderate to low; and a sum less than 80 ¬∞F represents low risk. Flea beetles do not survive in the northern half of Illinois due to low winter temperatures. Those found in late spring or summer have migrated from the south. Snow or other winter cover apparently provides insufficient shelter to enhance survival of the overwintering flea beetles. Prolonged periods of wet summer weather are unfavorable for beetle multiplication and feeding, while dry weather is favorable. Consequently, although this disease has been found throughout the world, the bacterium has never survived and spread other than in North America, because the disease depends on where C. pulicaria occurs. In North America, Stewart‚Äôs wilt is found in the mid-Atlantic and the Ohio River Valley regions and in the southern portion of the Corn Belt. This region includes parts of Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, and West Virginia. Stewart‚Äôs wilt can also be found in eastern and midwestern states and portions of Canada, but this depends on whether or not the corn flea beetles survive the winters. Corn flea beetles can transmit the bacteria northward during the summer, but if the insect vectors cannot survive the harsh winter temperatures, then the bacteria cannot be spread. The toothed flea beetle, adult 12-spotted cucumber beetle, seed corn maggot, wheat wireworm, white grubs, and larvae of corn rootworms can also carry P. stewartii from one plant to another during the summer. These pests cannot overwinter and transmit this disease. All sweet corn varieties are susceptible to wilt in the first leaf stage. Susceptibility decreases and natural control is obtained as plants grows older. External disease control is conducted by insecticide spraying to stop early feeding of overwintering flea beetles. Insecticides should be sprayed as soon as corn first breaks the soil surface. When establishing control measures, spraying should be repeated several times to regulate the presence of the insecticide products in the field. Common insecticides used for control of Stewart's wilt are clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam. These insecticides are most effectively used at rates of 1.25 (mg ai/kernel), with clothianidin being the most effective at that rate. Application rates on the labels may vary a little, so follow the label rates for each insecticide. Better results are obtained when seeds are sprayed prior to germination. In furrow spraying and post-germination foliar spraying may not be effective. Although insecticides are effective, resistant hybrids are the best means of disease control. Hybrid varieties of sweet corn are also available for control. Dent corn hybrids are more resistant to the disease than sweet corn, hence do not require insecticides. Importance In sweet corn, losses are as significant as hybrid varieties, but are only used on a periodic basis. The susceptible varieties cause losses ranging from 40 to 100% when infected prior to the five-leaf stage. The losses are 15‚Äì35% and 3‚Äì15% for seven-leaf and nine-leaf stages, respectively. Stewart's wilt may add additional costs for phytosanitary regulations from trading partners. Such regulations primarily affect seed commerce by preventing seed from being exported or by creating additional costs for phytosanitary inspections prior to export. During epidemics in the 1990s, Stewart's wilt was a significant economic issue for the corn seed industry because of the logistics of trading and exchange of large volumes of field corn seed throughout the world. Stewart's wilt also creates indirect costs for seed producers because resources must be used to screen germplasm and breed corn for Stewart's wilt resistance to develop hybrids that efficiently and effectively control the disease. In Kentucky, the disease causes huge losses for corn producers. Stewart's wilt impacts include stand reductions, production of fewer and smaller ears, and an increased susceptibility of wilt-infected plants to stalk rotting organisms. Origin Stewart's wilt was first observed by T.J. Burrill in the late 1880s while studying fire blights in the corn fields of southern Illinois. Burrill associated the symptoms he found with dry weather and chinch bug damage, yet he indicated that bacteria could be the cause for the disease. Nonetheless, he was unable to complete Koch's postulates to determine the causal pathogen of the disease. Then, in 1895, F.C. Stewart observed wilt in sweet-corn plants in Long Island, NY. After completion of Koch's postulates with the bacteria in sweet corn, Stewart gave an accurate account of the symptoms and named the pathogen Pseudomonas stewartii in 1898. With the help of his colleagues, Stewart concluded that the bacteria were readily disseminated by seed. Another 25 years later, a corn flea beetle, Chaetocnema pulicaria, was identified as the primary vector responsible for the midseason spread of the disease. The taxonomy of the pathogen was under debate for half a century, when in 1963, D.W. Dye named it Erwinia stewartii. Dye did so because the pathogen is closely related to other bacteria in the Erwinia herbicola-Enterobacter agglomerans complex. Recently, the complex was assigned to the genus, Pantoea, which did not agree with the results from the 16S RNA sequence analysis. Due to this difference, the pathogen was named, Erwinia stewartii, and has most recently been named, Pantoea stewartii. Stewart's wilt was primarily responsible for the development of the first widely grown, single-cross hybrid, 'Golden Cross Bantam'. In 1923, Glenn Smith, a USDA scientist working at Purdue University, created a hybrid from two different lines of the regular, susceptible 'Golden Bantam'. The hybrid was tested in one of the most destructive epidemics of Stewart's wilt in northern Indiana. After a successful performance, the hybrid was legalized and named 'Golden Cross Bantam'. Within a few years, 70‚Äì80% of the sweet corn canned in the US was that cultivar.

John Cox Stevens, the leader of this group, and a prominent citizen of New York with a passion for sports, was elected commodore. John Clarkson Jay of Rye, one of the nine founders, was a grandson of Founding Father John Jay and served as the first Secretary of the board.Clary, Suzanne. \\"A Legacy of Sailing: Owners of the Jay Estate & Yachting in New York 1843 - 1966\\". Rye Magazine: Weston Magazine, Inc. (38): 244. Retrieved January 2, 2016 ‚Äì via issuu. George L. Schuyler and Hamilton Wilkes were also NYYC founders who, together with Stevens and two others, created the syndicate that built and raced the great schooner-yacht, America. Wilkes served as the club's first vice-commodore. Schuyler played a key role in the founding of the America's Cup regatta, and served as its unofficial consultant until his death in 1890. In 1845, the club's burgee was designed. The waters off Newport have been a key sailing venue for the NYYC since the beginning of its history. Indeed, the day the club was founded in 1844, its members resolved to sail from the Battery to Newport. Two days later, they did, with several stops on the way, and trials of speed. During the first decades of the club's history, racing for prize money was the objective among most members. In 1851, a syndicate of NYYC enthusiasts built and raced America, capturing the \\"One Hundred Sovereign Cup\\" at the annual regatta of the Royal Yacht Squadron. On July 8, 1857, the coveted trophy was donated to the NYYC, to serve as a challenge cup for sportsmanlike competition between nations. The \\"America's Cup Race\\", named for its first winner, played a central role in the history of the club until this day. In 1865, the Club was incorporated, adopting the Latin motto: \\"Nos agimur tumidis velis\\" -- \\"We go with swelling sails\\" (adapted from the verse of the famous Roman poet Horace, \\"Non agimur tumidis uelis\\", \\"We do not go with swelling sails\\", in Epistles, 2, 2, 201). During this time, membership transitioned from the \\"old guard\\" to a new generation of yachtsmen, who built large schooner yachts captained by professionals. Marking this evolution was the 1866 resignation of Commodore Edwin Augustus Stevens, brother of founder John Cox Stevens and member of the America syndicate. \\"New York Yacht Club motto - Nos Agimur Tumidis Velis\\" The Great Ocean Yacht Race Between Henrietta, Fleetwing & Vesta, by Currier & Ives in 1867 The year 1866 is remembered in club annals for the legendary \\"Transatlantic Race\\". In December, the NYYC schooners Henrietta, Fleetwing, and Vesta raced from Sandy Hook to The Needles, Isle of Wight for a $90,000 winner-take-all prize. The Henrietta, owned by 21-year-old James Gordon Bennett, Jr., and skippered by Captain Samuel S. Samuels, a professional, won the race in 13 days, 21 hours and 55 minutes. Bennett would be elected commodore in 1871. In 1876, the Mohawk, a large centerboard schooner, capsized due to its sheets being \\"made fast\\" (fastened securely) when a freak squall struck. Vice-Commodore William T. Garner, his wife and crew died in the accident. It is believed that this tragedy led to the extinction of the great centerboard schooner yachts. The Mohawk was later sold to the U.S. Navy and recommissioned as the U.S. Eagre. =New York Yacht Club Stations circa 1894= By 1894, the New York Yacht Club had a number of Clubhouses: Station 1 in Bay Ridge; 2 in New York NY; 3 in Whitestone NY; 4 in New London, Connecticut; 5 in Shelter Island, New York; 6 in Newport RI; 7 in Vineyard Haven and at Rendezvous Glen Cove. In 1868, the club bought a big mansion used as Station 2 at Rosebank, Staten Island. This building still stands and is known as the Macfarlane Bredt House.

Group, 1994) Racing & The America's Cup Following the disastrous Bay of Quinte America's Cup challenge in 1881, the Club's committee voted a new rule to govern its races: :\\\\text{Rating}=\\\\frac{2 \\\\cdot \\\\text{Load Waterline Length}+ \\\\sqrt{\\\\text{Sail Area}}}{3} The America's Cup challenges of 1885, 1886 and 1887 used this rule with an waterline length limit. In 1887, the NYYC adopted the Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club's rating rule, which handicapped length comparatively less. Then, in 1903, the NYYC changed its rating system to the \\"Herreshoff Rule\\", devised by the yacht designer, Nathanael Herreshoff. Later renamed the \\"Universal Rule\\", it would be adopted by the majority of leading American yacht clubs. The rule governed yacht design for almost forty years. The America's Cup was held for 132 years, from 1851 until Australia II defeated Dennis Conner's Liberty off Newport, Rhode Island in 1983. This record remains the longest winning streak in sports history. Since the loss of the Cup the NYYC has been forced to reinvent itself and the Club has become involved in team racing, dinghy racing, youth sailing, and international regattas. In 2002 the Club hosted the Intercollegiate Sailing Association Sloop North American Championships. In 2006 the Club hosted the Blind Sailing World Championships. The NYYC will enter 2021 America's Cup, under the syndicate name American Magic, with a team led by Terry Hutchinson and Bella Mente Quantum Racing Association.

He won 328 races in the 1980s and '90s, a record for an American, including two Tour de France stages. He has worked in media since retiring as a racer. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease at age 40. CareerRacing cyclist= He was a brazen sprinter and a star of the 7-Eleven Cycling Team in the 1980s and early '90s, and is the leader in race victories by an American, with 328.Davis Phinney Foundation In 1986, he became the second American to win a stage at the Tour de France, while riding for American-based 7-Eleven. His racing career spanned two decades and included two stage victories in the Tour de France, a United States National Road Race Championships title, and the 1984 Olympic Bronze Medal in the Men's 100 km Team Time Trial along with Ron Kiefel, Roy Knickman, and Andrew Weaver. Aside from Greg LeMond, Phinney is the only American rider to make a legitimate run at winning the Green Jersey in the Tour de France. LeMond and he are the only two American riders to come in the top three of this classification. Phinney finished second in the points classification during the 1988 Tour de France. =Career after racing= Since retiring from cycling, Phinney has remained active as a cycling sports commentator, public speaker, journalist, and avid Nordic ski racer. Family He is married to champion cyclist Connie Carpenter-Phinney, with whom he has two children, Taylor and Kelsey. On August 9, 2007, Taylor became the Junior World Time Trial champion at the 2007 UCI Junior World Road and Track Championships held in Aguascalientes, Mexico, and on September 29, 2010, he became the 2010 UCI Under 23 World Time Trial champion. Parkinson's disease Phinney was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease at age 40, and established the Davis Phinney Foundation in 2004, a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. As Taylor was about to go to the Beijing Olympics late in 2008, Davis underwent deep brain stimulation in an effort to control some of his symptoms. Jaimie Henderson, a neurosurgeon at Stanford University Medical Center, implanted two electrodes 2.5 inches into either side of Phinney's brain, powered by a pacemaker in his chest. According to ESPN, the procedure was risky and not promising, but worked instantly. Phinney explained: > The doctor said, 'OK, let's try a little current now, and just like that, > all these muscles that had been at war with each other suddenly were at > peace. It was like Armistice Day. It was just like, 'Oh ‚Ä¶ my ‚Ä¶ god!' I > looked at my wife and she was crying. She said, 'I haven't seen your smile > in a year!' By 2012, the disease was setting in again. Doctors told him the brain pacemaker could turn the clock back on the progress of Parkinson's five years. Four years after the surgery, while Phinney did not shake like he used to, his balance was severely compromised.

It is considerend an insurgent group in Bangladesh. The Shanti Bahini was made out of mostly members from the Chakma tribe.  History  Following the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, Manabendra Narayan Larma founded the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti (PCJSS) on 15 February 1972, seeking to build an organization representing all the tribal peoples of the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Larma was elected to the Bangladesh Jatiya Sangsad, the national legislature of Bangladesh as a candidate of the PCJSS in 1973. When Larma's continued efforts to make the government recognize the rights of the tribal peoples through political discussions had failed, Larma and the PCJSS began organizing the Shanti Bahini (Peace Corps), an armed force operating in the Hill Tracts area. It was formed in 1972 and fought for many years against the government. Members of Shanti Bahini in Khagrachari on 5 May 1994. Shanti Bahini began attacking Bangladesh Army convoys in 1977. They carried out kidnappings and extortion. Larma subsequently went into hiding from government security forces. Factionalism within the PCJS weakened Larma's standing and he was assassinated on 10 November 1983. On 23 June 1981 the Shanti Bahini attacked a camp of Bangladesh rifles, killing 13 people. They later captured and executed 24 members of the Bangladesh rifles. In the 1980s the Government of Bangladesh started to provide land for thousands of landless Bengali . Many Bengali were forced to move to secure regions because of the insurgency, abandoning their land to the tribal communities. On 29 April 1986, Shanti Bahini massacred 19 Bengali. On 26 June 1989 the Shanti Bahini burned down villages where inhabitants had voted in Bangladeshi elections. In 1996 Shanti Bahini abducted and killed 30 Bengali. On 9 September 1996, the Shanti Bahini massacred a group of Bengali woodcutters, who were under the impression they'd been called to a meeting. Members of Shanti Bahini extorted some four million dollars from the local population in the name of toll collection. The Shanti Bahini abandoned militancy when the Bangladesh Awami League negotiated the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord between the government and the PCJSS on 2 December 1997. Members of Shanti Bahini surrendered their weapons in a stadium in Khagrachari. The treaty saw the lifting of nighttime curfew and the return of 50 thousand refugees. However, some members opposed to the peace deal formed a dissident group. Some of those who opposed the peace treaty formed the United People's Democratic Front as an alternate to the PCJSS. The treaty was also criticised by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and has not been fully implemented. Some members of Shanti Bahini became police officers after the peace treaty. On August 2014 Indian Border Security Forces arrested members of Shanti Bahini, two Bangladeshi Chakmas and three Indian national Chakmas with weapons in Mizoram. = Alleged foreign help = The spokesman for the Shanti Bahini, Bimal Chakma alleged Indian involvement by stating that after the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the removal of Bangladesh Awami League from power in 1975, India provided support and shelter to the members of Shanti Bahini. Members of Shanti Bahini were trained in Chakrata, India.

It is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic from the pyrazolopyrimidine class. It is manufactured by King Pharmaceuticals and Gedeon Richter Plc.. It has been discontinued in Canada but can be manufactured if a prescription is brought to a compounding pharmacy. It was prescribed rarely in the United Kingdom, with zopiclone being the preferred Z-drug by the National Health Service (NHS)and is now unavailable.  Medical uses  Zaleplon is slightly effective in insomnia, primarily characterized by difficulty falling asleep. Zaleplon significantly reduces the time required to fall asleep by improving sleep latency and may therefore facilitate sleep induction rather than sleep maintenance. Due to its ultrashort elimination half-life, zaleplon may not be effective in reducing premature awakenings; however, it may be administered to alleviate middle-of-the-night awakenings. However, zaleplon has not been empirically shown to increase total sleep time. It may result in an impaired ability to drive the next day, though it has proven promising when compared to other sedative/hypnotics and next-day residual sedation. It may have advantages over benzodiazepines with fewer adverse effects. Neither zaleplon, nor any nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic class medication should be combined with alcohol, as both modulate GABAA receptor sites, and in a synergistic manner increase the chances of fatal respiratory depression and asphyxiation from vomiting. = Special populations = Zaleplon is not recommended for chronic use in the elderly. The elderly are more sensitive to the adverse effects of zaleplon such as cognitive side effects. Zaleplon may increase the risk of injury among the elderly. It should not be used while in pregnancy or lactation, and in patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse, psychotic illness or depression, clinicians should devote more attention. When compared with benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepines (including zaleplon) offer few significant advantages in efficacy and tolerability among elderly individuals. Long-term use of sedative/hypnotics for insomnia has traditionally been discouraged for reasons that include concerns about addiction and rebound insomnia, as well to the risk of side effects associated to GABAA agonists, such as cognitive impairment, anterograde amnesia, daytime sedation, musculoskeletal impairment, and subsequently an increased risk of harm to oneself (e.g. falling) and to others (e.g. automotive accidents). Though, quite obviously as the body and brain age, these aforementioned phenomena are expected events, as they occur daily regardless of ingestion of a sedative/hypnotic. Thus, statistically significant and empirical evidence are arguably still absent as dramatic precautions and conclusions are drawn irrespective of the debilitating realities that accompany insomnia and the fact that these medicines do indeed provide assistance to millions of elderly individuals. It is important to distinguish between the extrapolation of potential side effects relative to the vast number of examples, wherein the sedative/hypnotic has proven therapeutically beneficial and appropriate. In addition, some contend the efficacy and safety of long-term use of these agents remains to be enumerated, but nothing concrete suggests long-term use poses any direct harm to a person. Still, as of today neither benzodiazepines nor nonbenzodiazepines are recommended for the long-term treatment of insomnia.  Adverse effects  The adverse effects of zaleplon are similar to the adverse effects of benzodiazepines, although with less next-day sedation, and in two studies zaleplon use was found not to cause an increase in traffic accidents, as compared to other hypnotics currently on the market. Sleeping pills, including zaleplon, have been associated with an increased risk of death. Available data cannot provide a reliable estimate of the incidence of dependence during treatment at recommended doses of zaleplon (typically 5‚Äì20 mg before bed). Other sedative/hypnotics have been associated with various signs and symptoms of a withdrawal syndrome, following abrupt discontinuation, ranging from mild dysphoria and insomnia to more serious cases that include abdominal and muscle cramps, vomiting, sweating, tremors, and convulsions. Following abrupt cessation, the seizure threshold is further lowered, wherein coma and death are possible outcomes if untreated. Some evidence suggests zaleplon is not as chemically reinforcing and exhibits far fewer rebound effects when compared with other nonbenzodiazepines, or Z-drugs.  Interactions  Cimetidine, rifampicin, and thioridazine cause interactions with zaleplon. Cimetidine and grapefruit are known to increase blood plasma concentrations of benzodiazepines metabolized by the P450 CYP3A4 liver enzyme (e.g. alprazolam) by extending the time by which the drug leaves the body, effectively extending the half-life and enhancing effects to potentially toxic levels. Thus, given the similarities between zaleplon and benzodiazepines, particularly in effect, and not just chemical structure, it is reasonable to take precautions (e.g. inquire at a pharmacy) before one consumes cimetidine (or grapefruit) while also taking zaleplon.  Pharmacology Mechanism of action= Zaleplon is a high-affinity ligand of positive modulator sites of GABAA receptors, which enhances GABAergic inhibition of neurotransmission in the central nervous system. The ultrashort half-life gives zaleplon a unique advantage over other hypnotics because of its lack of next-day residual effects on driving and other performance-related skills. Unlike nonselective benzodiazepine drugs and zopiclone, which distort the sleep pattern, zaleplon appears to induce sleep without disrupting the natural sleep architecture. A meta-analysis of randomized, controlled clinical trials which compared benzodiazepines against zaleplon or other Z-drugs such as zolpidem, zopiclone, and eszopiclone has found few clear and consistent differences between zaleplon and the benzodiazepines in terms of sleep onset latency, total sleep duration, number of awakenings, quality of sleep, adverse events, tolerance, rebound insomnia, and daytime alertness. Zaleplon has a pharmacological profile similar to benzodiazepines, characterized by an increase in slow wave deep sleep (SWDS) with rapid onset of hypnotic action. Zaleplon is a full agonist for the benzodiazepine Œ±1 receptor located on the GABAA receptor complex in the body, with lower affinity for the Œ±2 and Œ±3 subsites. It selectively enhances the action of GABA similar to, but more selectively than benzodiazepines. Zaleplon, although not a benzodiazepine, maintains a very similar pharmacological profile nonetheless, known for inducing hypnotic effects by Œ±1 subreceptor sites, anxiolytic and muscle relaxant effects via Œ±2 and Œ±3 subsites, with negligible anticonvulsant properties (via Œ±5 subsite), as zaleplon action is modulated at benzodiazepine receptor sites. The elimination half-life of zaleplon is about 1‚Äì1.5 hours. The absorption rate of zaleplon is rapid and the onset of therapeutic effects is typically breached within 5‚Äì15 minutes following ingestion. Zaleplon should be understood as an ultrashort- acting sedative-hypnotic drug for the treatment of insomnia. Zaleplon increases EEG power density in the Œ¥-frequency band and a decrease in the energy of the Œ∏-frequency band = Pharmacokinetics = Zaleplon is primarily metabolised by aldehyde oxidase, and its half-life can be affected by substances which inhibit or induce aldehyde oxidase. Taken orally, zaleplon reaches full concentration in about one hour. It is extensively metabolised into 5-oxozaleplon and 5-oxodesethylzaleplon (the latter via desethylzaleplon), with less than 1% of it excreted intact in urine.  Chemistry  Pure zaleplon in its solid state is a white to off-white powder with very low solubility in water, as well as low solubility in ethanol and propylene glycol. It has a constant octanol-water partition coefficient of log P = 1.23 in the pH range between 1 and 7. It is classified as a pyrazolopyrimidine. = Synthesis = Zaleplon synthesisJ. P. Dusza et al., (1986 to Am. Cyanamid).http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal- ZYSG200205002.htm „ÄäChina Pharmacist„Äã 2002-05 Synthesis of Zaleplon. The synthesis starts with the condensation of 3-acetylacetanilide (1) with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (DMFDMA) to give the eneamide (2). The anilide nitrogen is then alkylated by means of sodium hydride and ethyl iodide to give 3. The first step in the condensation with 3-amino-4-cyanopyrazole can be visualized as involving an addition-elimination reaction sequence on the eneamide function to give a transient intermediate such as 5. Cyclization then leads to formation of the fused pyrimidine ring to afford zaleplon (6). Society and culture Recreational use = Zaleplon has the potential to be a drug of recreational use, and has been found to have an addictive potential similar to benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine-like hypnotics. The mind- and judgment-altering effects of zaleplon are similar to those of many benzodiazepines, but the fast-acting nature and short half-life of the chemical mean high doses set on much more quickly and last for short periods of time (usually from 45 to 60 minutes). Some individuals use a different delivery method than prescribed, such as insufflation, to induce effects faster. Sonata 10-mg capsules A common effect of recreational zaleplon use is the occurrence of (typically short-lived) hallucinations. Fewer visual and auditory hallucinations/disruptions occur with the use of zaleplon than with other Z-drugs, like zolpidem. Anterograde amnesia can occur and can cause one to lose track of the amount of zaleplon already ingested, prompting the ingesting of more than originally planned. However, continuous ingestion is extremely unlikely precisely because of zaleplon's quick onset of action. The combination of alcohol and zaleplon can result in fatal respiratory depression and asphyxiation from vomiting. = Aviation use = The Federal Aviation Administration allows zaleplon with a 6-hour wait period and no more than twice a week, which makes it the sleep medication with the shortest allowed waiting period after use. The substances with the 2nd shortest period, which is of 24 hours, are zolpidem and ramelteon. = Military use = The United States Air Force uses zaleplon as one of the hypnotics approved as a \\"no-go pill\\" to help aviators and special-duty personnel sleep in support of mission readiness (with a four-hour restriction on subsequent flight operation). \\"Ground tests\\" are required prior to authorization being issued to use the medication in an operational situation. The other hypnotics used as \\"no-go pills\\" are temazepam and zolpidem, which both have longer mandatory recovery periods.

Since its inception in 1972, the PCJSS has fought for autonomy and the recognition of the ethnic identity and rights of the indigenous tribes of the Hill Tracts. Its military arm, the Shanti Bahini was used to fight government forces and Bengali settlers in the Hill Tracts. A peace accord was signed in 1997 led to the disarmament of the Shanti Bahini and enabled the PCJSS to return to mainstream politics.Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs Background The roots of the PCJSS can be traced to the Hill Tracts Students' Association and the Parbatya Chattagram Upajatiya Kalyan Samiti (United People's Welfare and Development Party of the Chittagong Hill Tracts) that were organised in the 1960s in what was then-East Pakistan. The organisations agitated on behalf of the 100,000 native peoples displaced by the construction of the Kaptai Dam, seeking rehabilitation and compensation. After the creation of Bangladesh in 1971, representatives of the Chittagong Hill Tracts such as the Chakma politicians Charu Bikash Chakma and Manabendra Narayan Larma sought autonomy and recognition of the rights of the peoples of the region. Larma and others protested the draft of the Constitution of Bangladesh, although the Constitution recognised the ethnic identity but Larma and others wanted full sovereignty and separation from Bangladesh. The government policy of recognised only the Bengali culture and the Bengali language and designating all citizens of Bangladesh as Bengalis. In talks with Hill Tracts delegation led by Manabendra Narayan Larma, the country's founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman insisted that the ethnic groups of the Hill Tracts adopt the Bengali identity. Sheikh Mujib is also reported to have threatened to forcibly settle Bengalis in the Hill Tracts to reduce the native peoples into a minority. Four-point manifesto and foundation On 24 April 1972 Manabendra Narayan Larma presented a four-point manifesto to the constitution drafting committee, which sought: #Autonomy for the Chittagong Hill Tracts and the creation of its own Legislative Assembly. #Inclusion in the constitution of a statute like the Regulation of 1900 that safeguarded the identity and rights of the people of the Hill Tracts. #Preservation of the positions of tribal chiefs and tribal customs and laws. #Prohibition of amendments to the statute enshrining the Regulation of 1900 and the settlement of Bengalis in the Hill Tracts. The manifesto was summarily rejected by the government, causing resentment and dissatisfaction amongst the people of the Hill Tracts. On 15 February 1973 representatives and activists of the Hill Tracts founded the Parbatya Chhattagram Jana Samhatti Samiti (PCJSS) under Manabendra Narayan Larma's leadership. The party's official aims and objectives included humanism, nationalism, democracy, secularism and the protection of the rights, culture and ethnic identity, and autonomy for the tribes of the Hill Tracts. The PCJSS sought to unify and represent all the tribes of the Hill Tracts and also organised a committee of villages, a students and youth wing and a women's wing of the party. Insurgency Dissatisfaction and anger due to government opposition to their demands led the PCJSS to organise the Shanti Bahini (Peace forces) as military force to launch an armed struggle to win autonomy and secure the rights of the people of the Hill Tracts. Many insurgents are believed to have trained, equipped and sheltered in the neighbouring Indian state of Tripura. During the insurgency, the PCJSS strongly opposed the government-driven settlement of Bengalis in the Hill Tracts as a ploy to marginalise the tribes in their home region. The PCJSS also rejected the Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board and other government plans for local councils. After an insurgency that lasted for almost two decades, the PCJSS entered into peace talks with the government after the restoration of democracy in 1991. However, little progress was made with the government of prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia, the widow of Ziaur Rahman and her Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Fresh rounds of talks began in 1996 with the newly elected prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed of the Awami League, the daughter of Sheikh Mujib. The peace accord was finalised and formally signed on 2 December 1997. The peace accord provided for greater autonomy, the return of land to displaced tribals and special status for the ethnic groups and tribes. The accord also created a central ministry of tribal affairs and an elected regional council that would be empowered to govern the Hill Tracts and oversee local tribal councils. The accord also granted official recognition of the ethnic groups and tribes. After the treaty was signed, Shanti Bahini insurgents formally laid down their arms and more than 50,000 displaced tribals were able to return to their homes. The PCJSS emerged as a mainstream political party. Recent activities Since the peace accord, the PCJSS has emerged as a mainstream political party and is currently headed by Jyotirindra Bodhipriya Larma, the younger brother of Manabendra Narayan Larma, who is also the chairman of the CHT regional council. The PCJSS has continued to agitate for the full and proper implementation of the peace accord and has alleged lack of government action and intimidation from security forces. The PCJSS has protested the rise of Islamism and Islamic terrorism in the region from groups based in Bangladesh and neighbouring Burma.

Cat 740 Ejector on a roadworks site. The Caterpillar 740 Ejector Articulated Truck is Caterpillar's second generation of articulated haulers (dump truck) to have a system that pushes material out the back of the body. It is the largest articulated haul truck offered by Caterpillar; larger trucks use a rigid frame system. The ejector uses a 4-cylinder hydraulic ram and blade to dump the material out, a similar system to Cat's wheel tractor-scrapers. The 740 Ejector is sold as separate model from the usual 740. Total power is 436 hp (325 kW), total operating weight is 162,280 lb (73,610 kg), with the load being 42 short tons (38 tonnes), 37.3 yd3 (28.5 m3) at a 1:1 heap. Top forward speed is 34 mph (55 km/h).  History  Caterpillar introduced an ejector version of its D400E in 2001. In 2002/2003, the DX00 series of trucks were replaced with the 7XX range. Currently Caterpillar supplies 725, 730, 730 Ejector, 735, 740 and 740 Ejector versions. The 7XX truck series uses the same cab design across all types. These are all manufactured in the UK.  Advantages and disadvantages  Advantages # Lower risk of tipping over on slopes when dumping. # Ability to spread the material out over a distance. # Dumping does not increase the risk of contacting overhead obstacles (power lines, bridges, etc.). # Virtually eliminate any material remaining in the body after dumping. # Dumping and returning can be done without slowing down. Disadvantages # Reduction in types of materials suited for hauling, large rocks can wedge between sidewall and ejector causing damage. # Winter operations may cause wet material to freeze on sidewall jamming ejector. # More complicated operation, additional parts to maintain. # Body can be damaged from contact while loading, preventing ejection.

Established in 1929, the house of Mainbocher successfully operated in Paris (1929‚Äì1939), and then in New York (1940‚Äì1971).  French years (1929-1939)  In November 1929, Main Rousseau Bocher merged his own name, in honor of his favorite couturieres, Augustabernard and Louiseboulanger, and established his own fashion house, incorporated as \\"Mainbocher Couture\\" at 12 Avenue George-V in Paris. Mainbocher progressively gained recognition for his elegant and sophisticated couture garments. The strapless dress and jeweled cashmere sweaters are his creations. His subtle and timeless style won Mainbocher an exclusive clientele, which included fashion editors like Carmel Snow, Bettina Ballard, Diana Vreeland, aristocrats like Princess Karam of Kapurthala, Elsie de Wolfe, Lady Castlerosse, the Vicomtesse de Noailles, Baroness Eug√®ne de Rothschild, pianist Dame Myra Hess, socialites like Millicent Rogers, Daisy Fellowes, Mrs. Cole Porter, Syrie Maugham, and stars like Mary Pickford, Constance Bennett, Kay Francis, Claudette Colbert, Irene Dunne, Loretta Young, Miriam Hopkins, Helen Hayes. His most famous patron was Wallis Simpson, after whom he even named a color, \\"Wallis Blue\\" In 1937, he also designed her wedding dress and trousseau for her marriage to the Duke of Windsor, after he abdicated the British throne.Harpers Bazaar: Royal Wedding Gowns http://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/fashion-articles/iconic-royal-wedding- gowns#slide-1 Described in 1950 as \\"one of the most photographed and most copied dresses of modern times\\", the bridal dress is today part of the Metropolitan Museum collection. Hamish Bowles later said: \\"I think [Mainbocher's clothes] are so subtle, the detailing is so extraordinary, and they are so unbelievably evocative of ... absolute subtle luxury. You can really see why a client like Wallis Windsor would have been drawn to his clothes, and why she became so emblematic of his work.\\"Hamish Bowles, Interview Magazine, March 2009 Mainbocher's last Paris collections created a storm of controversy. Anticipating Christian Dior's \\"New Look\\" by eight years, the \\"wasp waist\\", a nipped-in waist, radically altered the silhouette of the thirties. Dior himself confessed: \\"Mainbocher is really in advance of us all, because he does it in America.\\"The New York Times, Mainbocher Stands for a Fitting, March 25, 1956 The corset that shaped Mainbocher's last Parisian collection was immortalized in 1939 by one of Horst P. Horst's most famous photographs, known as the \\"Mainbocher Corset.\\"The Mainbocher Corset captured by Horst Mainbocher's corseted waist, defined bosom, and back draping was an abrupt shift in silhouette and introduced the Victorian motifs that were to pervade the forties. In his book Decades: A Century of Fashion, in which he named Mainbocher \\"the designer of the 30ies,‚Äù Cameron Silver further noted that \\"Mainbocher's designs oozed exclusivity, good breeding, and rarefied taste.‚ÄùSilver, Cameron (2012), Decades: A Century of Fashion, Bloomsbury Publishing.  American years (1940‚Äì1971)  The onset of Second World War forced Mainbocher to leave France. In 1940, he relocated his business to New York on 57th Street next to Tiffany's and established \\"Mainbocher Inc.\\" He recreated his Paris salons exactly as they were and stayed to true to haute couture traditions. The corset controversy proved to be a timely marketing opportunity; the house of Mainbocher teamed up with the Warner Brothers Corset Company and streamlined the design for mass production. He showed his first New York collection on October 30, 1940, and soon established himself as one of the leading American fashion designers. He solved fabric rationing issues by designing short evening gowns and \\"cocktail aprons\\" that could transform any dress into a formal evening dress. During the war, Mainbocher designed a series of uniforms for both military and civilian organizations, applying his principles of functionality and utility while retaining the sophisticated elegance of his namesake label. These uniforms also allowed him to reclaim his American identity in a patriotic context. In 1942, he conceived the uniforms for the women-only division of the American Navy, called WAVES. He then updated the uniforms of the American Red Cross, and in 1948, he unified the uniforms of Girl Scouts in the same shade of green. In 1950, he designed a one of a kind evening dress uniform for Colonel Katherine Amelia Towle, who was then Director of Women Marines (USMCR). This unique uniform is now on display at the armory of the Newport Artillery Company in Newport, Rhode Island. In New York, Mainbocher continued to dress generations of women like debutante Brenda Frazier, Doris Duke, Adele Astaire, Elizabeth Parke Firestone, Gloria Vanderbilt, Lila Wallace, Bunny Mellon, Babe Paley, Princess Maria Cristina de Bourbon, Kathryn Miller, and C. Z. Guest. In 1947, eight of the New York Dress Institute's Ten Best-Dressed Women in the World were Mainbocher clients. After he achieved fame for dressing some of the world's most famous women, Mainbocher was commissioned to design the costumes for Leonora Corbett in the comic play Blithe Spirit (1941); Mary Martin in the Broadway musicals One Touch of Venus (1943) and The Sound of Music (1959); Tallulah Bankhead in the Broadway production Private Lives (1948); Ethel Merman in the musical Call Me Madam (1950); Rosalind Russell in the musical Wonderful Town (1953); Lynn Fontanne in The Great Sebastians (1956); Katharine Cornell in The Prescott Papers; Irene Worth in the play Tiny Alice (1964); and Lauren Bacall in the musical Applause (1970). In 1961, the Mainbocher business moved to the K.L.M. Building on Fifth Avenue and continued until 1971 when Mainbocher, at the age of 81, closed the doors of his house. He divided his last years between Paris and Munich until his death in 1976.  Legacy  In 2002, Mainbocher was honored with a bronze plaque on New York City's Fashion Walk of Fame in the legendary Garment District. Mainbocher inspired many of the most brilliant fashion designers, including Christian Lacroix, who praised the glamour of his garments.Women's Wear Daily, What's old is new, Lacroix shows fashion history, November 8, 2007 Mainbocher's fashion designs have been displayed in many exhibitions over the years. In 2010, the Museum of the City of New York created a virtual exhibition on Worth & Mainbocher, which was the first to emphasize Mainbocher's work. The first retrospective dedicated to Mainbocher, entitled Making Mainbocher, took place at the Chicago History Museum from October 2016 to August 2017. This exhibition was partly sponsored by Luvanis, which is the current owner of the brand.

History and controversy In 1969, Robert Matherson bought what was then a waterfront barrier island restaurant and converted it into an enormously popular (and controversial) nightclub: the \\"Oak Beach Inn\\", located in Oak Beach on Jones Beach Island, NY, was the original, and later just referred to as \\"The OBI\\". He later opened three more OBI nightclubs and named them according to their geographic location. The OBI North was in Smithtown, New York, the 'OBI East' near the Shinnecock Canal en route to The Hamptons, and the OBI West locations in Island Park, New York (which has 2 locations over time; first at 3999 Long Beach Road, and later, briefly, at 50 Broadway). All four clubs were located on Long Island and were wildly successful for many years, bringing people in from all over Long Island, New York City, Westchester, southern Connecticut and New Jersey and hosting acts such as Twisted Sister and The Good Rats. In 1979, Matherson sued the town to lease him more land for additional parking which the town granted. However two years later, new officials disagreed which caused Matherson to sue again and when the court favored with Matherson, the town granted him $3 million and the nine acres. In 1993, an unhappy Matherson actually started a \\"Move Out of New York Before It's Too Late\\" campaign complete with a hearse, banners and TV ads. A 1993 New York Times article provided more details about his campaign including that the New York State Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control raided the club one year earlier in 1992. One of the OBI West locations burned down after only a couple of years of packing in thousands on the weekends. Arson involving organized crime figures referred to in the movie Goodfellas was alleged but never substantiated. Over the years, the OBI was involved in many disputes with the local community over issues such as noise, parking and traffic. Finally, in 1999, Matherson sold the property to developer Ross Cassata, who planned to build condominiums, and moved to Key West, Florida to open a new club of the same name. When it closed, the inn's two-ton statues of whales and dolphins, which were commonly touched by clubgoers, were moved to Danfords on the Sound in Long Island. However, Cassata then sold the nine acres to Suffolk County for $7.95 million and the original property was torn down in 2003 and was replaced with a town-operated park, with later added plans of adding a bed and breakfast, upscale restaurant, boardwalk, water-sport area and boat ramp. The park now hosts activities such as car racing and has caused controversy in itself. At the time of demolition, the Suffolk County Legislator commented that the park agreement avoided \\"an enormous tax increase in Babylon, which would have had to pay a court judgment of as much as $20 million or watch its coastline be forever scarred by high-rise development\\" and the money came from the county's greenway program. Locations The original \\"OBI\\" was at 1 Oak Beach Road, Oak Beach, NY. The building was sold in 1999, torn down in 2003, land turned into a park with a small beach simply called \\"Oak Beach\\". The \\"OBI East\\" was at 239 E Montauk Highway, Hampton Bays, NY. The building is in ruins but is still standing. The \\"OBI North\\" was at State Road 25A, near Jericho Turnpike, Smithtown, NY. The building burned down in 1980, the land is now part of \\"Willow Ridge at Smithtown\\" HOA. The \\"OBI West\\" was at 3999 Long Beach Road, Island Park, NY. The building was torn down between 1994 and 2004, the land is now a school bus parking lot. It later was briefly located at 50 Broadway (sometimes listed as 50 Austin Blvd.), Island Park, NY as one of a series of famous nightclubs such as the \\"Shell House\\", \\"The Action House\\", \\"The Rock Pile\\", \\"OBI West\\", and \\"Speaks\\". Robert Matherson later went on to open \\"Oak Beach Inn\\" at 227 Duval Street, Key West, Florida. That establishment was only operating for a few years. Robert Matherson died in 2007. In popular culture Robert \\"Rosebud\\" Butt is credited with inventing the Long Island Iced Tea, while working as a bartender at the original OBI in the 1970s. In 2010 the Babylon-based rock band \\"Two Cent Sam\\" released the \\"OBI Song\\" and a DIY video celebrating the Oak Beach Inn's history and impact on Long Islanders and the void in Long Island night life after the \\"OBI's\\" destruction https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIPKEJgHlns You tube video about the club  References Bibliography * Category:Nightclubs in New York (state) Category:Buildings and structures in Suffolk County, New York Category:Babylon (town), New York Category:Demolished buildings and structures in New York (state) Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 2003 ","title":"Oak Beach Inn"},{"id":"2012971","text":"Y≈çku Hata (Ê≥¢Áî∞ÈôΩÂå∫, Hata Y≈çku, real name: Akira Hada (Ê≥¢Áî∞ ÊôÉ, Hada Akira), born June 5, 1975 in Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi Prefecture) is a stand up comedian in Japan.

Their songs are parodies of gangster rap mixed with Asian American culture, featuring lyrics about gangster lifestyles and Chinese food and boasting innuendos regarding women. Their group name is a parody of Brooklyn rapper The Notorious B.I.G., with \\"MSG\\" referring to monosodium glutamate, a sodium additive commonly used in East Asian cuisines. History Notorious MSG started in stories for themselves to explain their reasons for forming the group. According to this story, they all met in the kitchen of the Chinese restaurant in which they worked, but decided middle class origin, pointing to evidence which includes a reference to Cornell University in one of their songs. Group members *Hong Kong Fever: The ringleader; from Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong; worked as a waiter. *Down-Lo Mein: (or D-Lo), the \\"Yellow Gigolo\\".

In 2006, PRI's The World reported that the trio was in negotiations with Comedy Central to develop a series. Notorious MSG's website had a few singles for download. Their first cut, \\"Wok the Party\\", was received with mediocre fanfare. Shortly thereafter, they released three singles (such as Chinatown Hustler) that showed their potential for splicing rhymes to background beats, and garnered much popularity. Live performances In 2003 and 2004 Notorious MSG started to give small, organized concerts, generally to a few hundred people at any given time. One of their earliest performances was given at Rutgers University. Their first West Coast performance, given in February 2005, just outside Los Angeles, was part of a night of Asian-themed stand up comedy. They performed on August 4 and 5 at the Vans Warped Tour 2007 (Nassau Coliseum and Raceway Park, NJ). In recent years, the Notorious MSG has also performed in various music venues in New York City, such as Bowery Ballroom, CBGB's (just before it closed), Santos Party House and Brooklyn Bowl. After concerts they stay around to mingle with the audience, sign autographs and have their pictures taken. The members stay in character during and after the event. Discography In the Fall of 2004, Notorious MSG released their first album, Die Hungry. It is approximately 35 minutes, with four interludes and eight songs, of which one is a remix. Track list: #Intro #Straight out of Canton #Heat it Up #Hong Kong Heartbreak (Sketch) #Dim Sum Girl #Chinese Funk #Buddha Time (Sketch) #Egg Rollin' #Last Meal (Sketch) #Streets of Chinatown #Yello Fever (feat.

The Lunch Money EP was released in April 2007 under Cordless Recordings. Track List: #Pimp It #No Good Muthabitch #Chinatown Hustler #Warlord #Last Showdown #Dim Sum Girl They released their first full-length album Heavy Ghetto in May 2011 Track List: #Grandmaster #Red Tonight #Chinese Jeans #Hell Up In Hong Kong #Lunch Break #Shanghai Superfly #Schoolhousin' #Lonely G #Beef Street #This Is Rock N' Roll Heavy Ghetto was also released in 12\\" Vinyl on November 25, 2011. =Singles= #\\"Straight Out of Canton\\", whose name borrows from Straight Outta Compton by N.W.A. The single is different from the original version heard on Die Hungry, featuring new instrumental pieces. #\\"F.O.B. (Fresh off the Boat) For Life\\", a song boasting about their physical attributes and skills. This song is nowhere to be found on Die Hungry. #\\"Dim Sum Girl\\", a love ballad about the heartbreak of Hong Kong Fever from his former love, a dim sum girl (woman pushing around carts of dim sum in Chinese restaurants). It was featured in a Chinese reality television show. #\\"Kowloon Bay\\", a love ballad similar in flavor to Dim Sum Girl where Hong Kong Fever reminisces about his first love back in Kowloon Bay (a district in Hong Kong). #\\"Chinatown Hustler\\", a song about the life of a Chinatown gangster. This is also the single in which The Hunan Bomb is first heard. The music video officially aired on August 14, 2006. It is found on the video game original soundtrack of \\"Wet\\". #\\"Traditional Roughnecks\\" #\\"Old Shanghai\\" This song has been very hard to locate, since it was made very early on in the formation of Notorious MSG. Drinking a cup of Oolong Tea (\\"For days of Old Shanghai my dear, For days of Old Shanghai, We'll drink a cup of oolong tea, For the days of Old Shanghai\\") is the main action that is performed in the song's lyrics. =Music videos= #\\"Straight Out of Canton\\", their first music video, features scenes of working in the kitchen and raising hell in the streets of the Chinatown ghetto. #\\"Chinatown Hustler\\", features the life of a Chinatown gangster. It's a hard life when you're driving a pimpin' car around town, selling drugs, breaking up gambling parties and cavorting with ladies of the night. #\\"Red Tonight\\" features the Notorious MSG jamming in a Chinatown rock club, along with a group of hard-partying friends. #\\"Wonton Violence\\" has them dressed in leather and sunglasses showing off how tough they are in a martial arts gym.

It was originally named Athletic Park and opened as Cobb Field on May 4, 1948 after renovations. It was the home of the Billings Mustangs, the Pioneer League Rookie Affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds, from 1948-2007. Cobb Field was named after Bob Cobb, who was responsible for bringing the Mustangs to Billings. It also hosted home games for local American Legion baseball teams. In 2006, the stadium welcomed the re-formed NCAA baseball team from nearby Montana State University Billings. From March to May, home games were played at the field. Features Cobb Field had a natural grass surface. The dimensions were 335 feet to left, 405 feet to center, and 325 feet to right. Cobb Field sat 4,200, though crowds had been known to eclipse 5,000. The stadium was primarily made up of the same wood used when it had been built and had shown substantial wear. Many areas of the stadium had needed wooden boards to be installed over holes in the floor. Cobb Field's concessions had undergone a drastic overhaul in its last few years. In addition to the basic concession items, the Mustangs added the \\"Cobb Grill\\" and \\"Betisse's Bullpen\\", a patio on the left field line where Mustangs fans can enjoy a beer and roam about freely. \\"Betisse's Bullpen\\" also hosted pre-game tailgate parties. Cobb Field film Producers Craig Lindvahl and Joseph Fatheree created a film about the ballpark entitled Cobb Field, A Day at the Ballpark. The film gives a view of the world of minor league baseball from the eyes of the ballpark. It was shot during the final weeks of Cobb Field's existence. The film won Mid-America Emmys in three categories: Promotional Video, Musical Composition, and Photography. Lindvahl and Fatheree teach a film class at Effingham High School in Effingham, IL. Some of their students helped in the filming of the movie. Three of these students helped in the filming of Cobb Field and also won Mid-America Emmys for their film work. New stadium On November 8, 2006, a $12.5 million stadium levy passed (with a 53% majority 'for' vote) allowing construction of a new stadium at the Cobb Field location. Construction began in the Spring of 2007 and Cobb Field was torn down after the 2007 season. The new stadium opened as Dehler Park on June 29, 2008.

Definition Given a simply connected and open subset D of R2 and two functions I and J which are continuous on D, an implicit first-order ordinary differential equation of the form : I(x, y)\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x + J(x, y)\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}y = 0, \\\\,\\\\\\\\! is called an exact differential equation if there exists a continuously differentiable function F, called the potential function, so that :\\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial x} = I and :\\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial y} = J. The nomenclature of \\"exact differential equation\\" refers to the exact differential of a function. For a function F(x_0, x_1,...,x_{n-1},x_n), the exact or total derivative with respect to x_0 is given by :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}F}{\\\\mathrm{d}x_0}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial x_0}+\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial x_i}\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}x_i}{\\\\mathrm{d}x_0}. =Example= The function F:\\\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} given by :F(x,y) = \\\\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2)+c is a potential function for the differential equation :x\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}x + y\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}y = 0.\\\\, Existence of potential functions In physical applications the functions I and J are usually not only continuous but even continuously differentiable. Schwarz's Theorem then provides us with a necessary criterion for the existence of a potential function. For differential equations defined on simply connected sets the criterion is even sufficient and we get the following theorem: Given a differential equation of the form (for example, when F has zero slope in the x and y direction at F(x,y) ): : I(x, y)\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x + J(x, y)\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}y = 0, \\\\,\\\\\\\\! with I and J continuously differentiable on a simply connected and open subset D of R2 then a potential function F exists if and only if :\\\\frac{\\\\partial I}{\\\\partial y}(x, y) = \\\\frac{\\\\partial J}{\\\\partial x}(x, y). Solutions to exact differential equations Given an exact differential equation defined on some simply connected and open subset D of R2 with potential function F, a differentiable function f with (x, f(x)) in D is a solution if and only if there exists real number c so that :F(x, f(x)) = c.\\\\, For an initial value problem :y(x_0) = y_0\\\\, we can locally find a potential function by :F(x,y) = \\\\int_{x_0}^x I(t,y_0) \\\\mathrm{d}t + \\\\int_{y_0}^y J(x,t) \\\\mathrm{d}t= \\\\int_{x_0}^x I(t,y_0) \\\\mathrm{d}t + \\\\int_{y_0}^y \\\\left[ J(x_0,t) + \\\\int_{x_0}^{x} \\\\frac{\\\\partial I}{\\\\partial t}(u, t)\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}u\\\\,\\\\right]\\\\mathrm{d}t. Solving :F(x,y) = c\\\\, for y, where c is a real number, we can then construct all solutions.  Second order exact differential equations  The concept of exact differential equations can be extended to second order equations. Consider starting with the first-order exact equation: I(x,y)+J(x,y){dy \\\\over dx}=0 Since both functions I(x,y), J(x,y) are functions of two variables, implicitly differentiating the multivariate function yields {\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!I\\\\over\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!x} +({\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!J\\\\over\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!x}){dy \\\\over dx}+{d^2y \\\\over dx^2}(J(x,y))=0 Expanding the total derivatives gives that {\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!I\\\\over\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!x}={\\\\partial I\\\\over\\\\partial x}+{\\\\partial I\\\\over\\\\partial y}{dy \\\\over dx} and that {\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!J\\\\over\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!x}={\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial x}+{\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial y}{dy \\\\over dx} Combining the {dy \\\\over dx} terms gives {\\\\partial I\\\\over\\\\partial x}+{dy \\\\over dx}({\\\\partial I\\\\over\\\\partial y}+{\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial x}+{\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial y}{dy \\\\over dx})+{d^2y \\\\over dx^2}(J(x,y))=0 If the equation is exact, then {\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial x}={\\\\partial I\\\\over\\\\partial y} . Additionally, the total derivative of J(x,y) is equal to its implicit ordinary derivative {dJ \\\\over dx}. This leads to the rewritten equation {\\\\partial I\\\\over\\\\partial x}+{dy \\\\over dx}({\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial x}+{dJ \\\\over dx})+{d^2y \\\\over dx^2}(J(x,y))=0 Now, let there be some second-order differential equation f(x,y)+g(x,y,{dy \\\\over dx}){dy \\\\over dx}+{d^2y \\\\over dx^2}(J(x,y))=0 If {\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial x}={\\\\partial I\\\\over\\\\partial y} for exact differential equations, then \\\\int ({\\\\partial I\\\\over\\\\partial y})dy=\\\\int ({\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial x})dy and \\\\int ({\\\\partial I\\\\over\\\\partial y})dy=\\\\int ({\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial x})dy=I(x,y)-h(x) where h(x) is some arbitrary function only of x that was differentiated away to zero upon taking the partial derivative of I(x,y) with respect to y. Although the sign on h(x) could be positive, it is more intuitive to think of the integral's result as I(x,y) that is missing some original extra function h(x) that was partially differentiated to zero. Next, if {\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!I\\\\over\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!x}={\\\\partial I\\\\over\\\\partial x}+{\\\\partial I\\\\over\\\\partial y}{dy \\\\over dx} then the term {\\\\partial I\\\\over\\\\partial x} should be a function only of x and y, since partial differentiation with respect to x will hold y constant and not produce any derivatives of y. In the second order equation f(x,y)+g(x,y,{dy \\\\over dx}){dy \\\\over dx}+{d^2y \\\\over dx^2}(J(x,y))=0 only the term f(x,y) is a term purely of x and y. Let {\\\\partial I\\\\over\\\\partial x}=f(x,y). If {\\\\partial I\\\\over\\\\partial x}=f(x,y), then f(x,y)={\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!I\\\\over\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!x}-{\\\\partial I\\\\over\\\\partial y}{dy \\\\over dx} Since the total derivative of I(x,y) with respect to x is equivalent to the implicit ordinary derivative {dI \\\\over dx} , then f(x,y)+{\\\\partial I\\\\over\\\\partial y}{dy \\\\over dx}={dI \\\\over dx}={d \\\\over dx}(I(x,y)-h(x))+{dh(x) \\\\over dx} So, {dh(x) \\\\over dx}=f(x,y)+{\\\\partial I\\\\over\\\\partial y}{dy \\\\over dx}-{d \\\\over dx}(I(x,y)-h(x)) and h(x)=\\\\int(f(x,y)+{\\\\partial I\\\\over\\\\partial y}{dy \\\\over dx}-{d \\\\over dx}(I(x,y)-h(x)))dx Thus, the second order differential equation f(x,y)+g(x,y,{dy \\\\over dx}){dy \\\\over dx}+{d^2y \\\\over dx^2}(J(x,y))=0 is exact only if g(x,y,{dy \\\\over dx})={\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!J\\\\over\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!x}+{\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial x}={dJ \\\\over dx}+{\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial x} and only if the below expression \\\\int(f(x,y)+{\\\\partial I\\\\over\\\\partial y}{dy \\\\over dx}-{d \\\\over dx}(I(x,y)-h(x)))dx=\\\\int (f(x,y)-{\\\\partial (I(x,y)-h(x))\\\\over\\\\partial x})dx is a function solely of x. Once h(x) is calculated with its arbitrary constant, it is added to I(x,y)-h(x)to make I(x,y). If the equation is exact, then we can reduce to the first order exact form which is solvable by the usual method for first-order exact equations. I(x,y)+J(x,y){dy \\\\over dx}=0 Now, however, in the final implicit solution there will be a C_1x term from integration of h(x) with respect to x twice as well as a C_2, two arbitrary constants as expected from a second-order equation. = Example = Given the differential equation (1-x^2)y-4xy'-2y=0 one can always easily check for exactness by examining the y term. In this case, both the partial and total derivative of 1-x^2 with respect to x are -2x, so their sum is -4x, which is exactly the term in front of y'. With one of the conditions for exactness met, one can calculate that \\\\int (-2x)dy=I(x,y)-h(x)=-2xy Letting f(x,y)=-2y, then \\\\int(-2y-2xy'-{d \\\\over dx}(-2xy)dx=\\\\int (-2y-2xy'+2xy'+2y)dx=\\\\int (0)dx=h(x) So, h(x) is indeed a function only of x and the second order differential equation is exact. Therefore, h(x)=C_1 and I(x,y)=-2xy+C_1. Reduction to a first-order exact equation yields -2xy+C_1+(1-x^2)y'=0 Integrating I(x,y) with respect to x yields -x^2y+C_1x+i(y)=0 where i(y) is some arbitrary function of y. Differentiating with respect to y gives an equation correlating the derivative and the y' term. -x^2+i'(y)=1-x^2 So, i(y)=y+C_2 and the full implicit solution becomes C_1x+C_2+y-x^2y=0 Solving explicitly for y yields y= \\\\frac{C_1x+C_2}{1-x^2}  Higher order exact differential equations  The concepts of exact differential equations can be extended to any order. Starting with the exact second order equation {d^2y \\\\over dx^2}(J(x,y))+{dy \\\\over dx}({dJ \\\\over dx}+{\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial x})+f(x,y)=0 it was previously shown that equation is defined such that f(x,y)={dh(x) \\\\over dx}+{d \\\\over dx}(I(x,y)-h(x))-{\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial x}{dy \\\\over dx} Implicit differentiation of the exact second-order equation n times will yield an (n+2)th order differential equation with new conditions for exactness that can be readily deduced from the form of the equation produced. For example, differentiating the above second-order differential equation once to yield a third-order exact equation gives the following form {d^3y \\\\over dx^3}(J(x,y))+{d^2y \\\\over dx^2}{dJ \\\\over dx}+{d^2y \\\\over dx^2}({dJ \\\\over dx}+{\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial x})+{dy \\\\over dx}({d^2J \\\\over dx^2}+{d \\\\over dx}({\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial x}))+{df(x,y) \\\\over dx}=0 where {df(x,y) \\\\over dx}={d^2h(x) \\\\over dx^2}+{d^2 \\\\over dx^2}(I(x,y)-h(x))-{d^2y \\\\over dx^2}{\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial x}-{dy \\\\over dx}{d \\\\over dx}({\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial x})=F(x,y,{dy \\\\over dx})and where F(x,y,{dy \\\\over dx}) is a function only of x,y and {dy \\\\over dx}. Combining all {dy \\\\over dx} and {d^2y \\\\over dx^2} terms not coming from F(x,y,{dy \\\\over dx}) gives {d^3y \\\\over dx^3}(J(x,y))+{d^2y \\\\over dx^2}(2{dJ \\\\over dx}+{\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial x})+{dy \\\\over dx}({d^2J \\\\over dx^2}+{d \\\\over dx}({\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial x}))+F(x,y,{dy \\\\over dx})=0 Thus, the three conditions for exactness for a third-order differential equation are: the {d^2y \\\\over dx^2} term must be 2{dJ \\\\over dx}+{\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial x}, the {dy \\\\over dx} term must be {d^2J \\\\over dx^2}+{d \\\\over dx}({\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial x}) and F(x,y,{dy \\\\over dx})-{d^2 \\\\over dx^2}(I(x,y)-h(x))+{d^2y \\\\over dx^2}{\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial x}+{dy \\\\over dx}{d \\\\over dx}({\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial x}) must be a function solely of x. = Example = Consider the nonlinear third-order differential equation yy'+3y'y+12x^2=0 If J(x,y)=y, then y(2{dJ \\\\over dx}+{\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial x}) is 2y'y and y'({d^2J \\\\over dx^2}+{d \\\\over dx}({\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial x}))=y'ywhich together sum to 3y'y. Fortunately, this appears in our equation. For the last condition of exactness, F(x,y,{dy \\\\over dx})-{d^2 \\\\over dx^2}(I(x,y)-h(x))+{d^2y \\\\over dx^2}{\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial x}+{dy \\\\over dx}{d \\\\over dx}({\\\\partial J\\\\over\\\\partial x})=12x^2-0+0+0=12x^2 which is indeed a function only of x. So, the differential equation is exact. Integrating twice yields that h(x)=x^4+C_1x+C_2=I(x,y). Rewriting the equation as a first-order exact differential equation yields x^4+C_1x+C_2+yy'=0 Integrating I(x,y) with respect to x gives that {x^5\\\\over 5}+C_1x^2+C_2x+i(y)=0. Differentiating with respect to y and equating that to the term in front of y' in the first-order equation gives that i'(y)=y and that i(y)={y^2\\\\over 2}+C_3. The full implicit solution becomes {x^5\\\\over 5}+C_1x^2+C_2x+C_3+{y^2\\\\over 2}=0 The explicit solution, then, is y=\\\\pm\\\\sqrt{C_1x^2+C_2x+C_3-{2x^5\\\\over 5}} See also * Exact differential * Inexact differential equation References Further reading  * Boyce, William E.; DiPrima, Richard C.

It is related to \\"call ball\\" and \\"ball tag\\". As few as three may play, with no upper limit. A large, open area is required. The game begins with each player being assigned a number, in secret, with the highest number corresponding to the number of players. For example, if 5 people are playing, each player will be assigned one of the numbers 1 through 5. A player is chosen as 'It.' The person who is It stands in the approximate center of the playing area, with one foot in front of the other. All of the other players must then touch one of their feet to its inward foot, and then step backwards 3 paces. This 3-step-backward set-up is required. When all of the players have stepped backward 3 paces, the person who is It throws the ball straight into the air and calls the number of another player. The ball must be thrown straight up. When the ball is thrown skyward, all of the players then dash away until the player whose number is called both (1) gains possession of the ball; and (2) calls out 'Spud!' At that point, all of the players must freeze. If, while they were running, they were unable to stop immediately, those players must retrace their steps and return to the point that they were in contact with when Spud! was called. In no event may any of the players run around corners or hide behind trees. In all instances, they must be in sight of the player who has gained possession of the ball. At this point, the player who has the ball is allowed to take an identified number of giant steps toward one or more of the other players. Smaller, younger, or older players may be given the option of taking more steps. After the steps are taken, the person with the ball will try to hit one of the other players with the ball. The target player may not move his or her feet or duck, but may sway, bend, shimmy, and shift. If the target player comes into contact with the thrown ball in any way (unless he or she catches the ball), he or she is penalized with one letter (i.e., S P U or D), and then is charged with throwing the ball into the air for the next round. If the target player does not come into contact with the thrown ball or the target player catches the ball, the player who threw the ball is penalized with one letter, and then is charged with throwing the ball into the air for the next round. When a player receives four penalty letters (S P U D), that person is required to go through a spanking machine, and a new game is begun. For another variation, a player who receives four Penalty letters is simply removed from the game, and the other players continue playing with their original penalty letters in place. When there are only 2 players left playing under this variation, there are two ways for the game to end. First, both players can be declared victors. Second, one of the removed players throws the ball into the air for the final round. In another variation, the highest of the secretly-assigned numbers is 2 greater than the number of players. In this version, the 2 secretly unassigned numbers are referred to as 'ghost numbers.' If the player throwing the ball into the air calls a ghost number, all players will then chase after the ball and try to touch it. The last player to touch the ball is penalized with one letter and is then charged with throwing the ball into the air for the next round. While kicking the ball is permitted, players may not kick the ball if it is within 3 feet of another player (for purposes of safety). In this instance, the player may simply touch or punch the ball with another part of the body besides his or her feet. In this version, when a player is removed, his or her number also becomes a ghost number. In all instances, a player who wants to call a ghost number must throw the ball sufficiently high and in the air to remove any advantage that he or she would otherwise have.

The station is served by Sydney Trains T4 line services. It was designed and built by the NSW Government Railway and from 1905 to 1992. It is also known as the Oatley Railway Station group. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. Oatley is notable as the end point of the first section of track to be electrified for regular passenger services, with services from Central commencing on 1 March 1926. Historically some services used to terminate at Oatley before returning north; this is no longer the case but the points remain in place. History The Oatley area was named after James Oatley, who was granted in the area, called Needwood Forest, in 1833. Oatley never built on the grant and it passed to his third son after his death in 1839, who sold the land to Charles Cecil Griffiths in 1881. The property extended from Gungal Bay on the western edge to the later Boundary and Hurstville Roads. In 1881 the proposed route for the Illawarra railway line was published and approved. In 1882 works began at Marrickville (now Sydenham) on railway construction. In 1884 the railway to Hurstville station opened (double track) with stations at Arncliffe, Rockdale, Kogarah and Hurstville. In 1885 the first single track line (built by C. & E. Miller) was opened as far as Sutherland station, with railway stations opened at Como, Penshurst, Mortdale, and Oatley. The small platform at Oatley, with a timber platform building, opened on 26 December 1885. Judd's Hurstville Brick Works opened in 1884, on a site north of Oatley (now the site of Georges River College). The location of Judd's brick works appears to have been a major reason for the building of Oatley railway station in 1885 in what was then a very sparsely populated area. The railway station was first called \\"Oatley's Grant\\" (up to 1886) and then \\"Oatley's Platform\\" (by 1889). In 1890 \\"Oatley's Platform\\" finally changed to \\"Oatley\\". The line was duplicated in 1890. The Station Master's residence was built in 1891. Development in the area was slow - in 1893 there were only nine houses in the vicinity of the railway station. In 1903 a post office was established at the railway station. In July 1905 regrading of the railway line led to the station being moved to the west of its original location, away from the Oatley town centre at Frederick St and Letitia St to the east. This relocation of the line was due to the steep gradient leading down to the Georges River bridge which the goods trains had difficulty climbing. The 1890 weatherboard platform building was relocated to the new station, onto a long curved brick island platform. The platform building is now only one of the two such weatherboard platform buildings of this type in Sydney (the other being at Penshurst railway station). Part of the former railway reservation is now the Oatley Memorial Gardens.Oatley Station NSWrail.netOatley Memorial Gardens Kogarah City Council Access from one side of the line to the other was initially via a series of overbridges at various locations along the line. In some localities these were too far apart, and construction of a series of brick arch subways was begun around 1905 and completed during the 1920s. Construction was in brickwork due to the large number of nearby brickworks. The 1905 brick arched Mulga Road underbridge at Oatley was designed by Per way Branch staff, New South Wales Government Railways. The platform is reached via a subway stair leading off Mulga Road which is part of the underbridge. The underbridge has a semi-circular brick barrel arch spanning over a two-lane roadway, and is thought to be the second largest brick arch underbridge in the NSW rail system. The centre of the bridge is now roofed, between the railway tracks (over the subway) however was unroofed in 1943. In 1918 the present signal box was incorporated within the then open north end awning area of the platform building. The electrification of the line from St James to Oatley was undertaken in the 1920s, and the first electric train ran on 16 August 1926. This was the first line to be electrified. In December 1930 disused railway land (the former railway alignment to the east) was officially transferred to Kogarah Council, and this became Oatley Memorial Gardens. When first built in 1905, the double track station had an engine road and goods siding on the eastern side but these were closed in 1940. The platform building arrangement stayed the same until 1992, when State Rail replanned the remaining part of the platform building, providing new toilet facilities and a larger waiting room at the southern end of the building. This resulted in major change to the platform building both externally and internally (except to the signal box, which remains unaltered), including changes to windows and doors. Also in 1992, a new steel platform canopy was built, connecting the platform building and the entrance to the pedestrian subway. On 3 March 2001 a commemorative trip, utilising RailCorp's heritage electric fleet, was made by the Governor Professor Marie Bashir and invited guests to mark the 75th anniversary of the inaugural journey from St James to Oatley in 1926. In 2005 some of the 1992 changes to the platform building were reversed. The 1918 signal box remains in a near original state despite being superseded for electric light signals in 1926. In 2015 the Oatley station was upgraded with a 100 vehicle car park, and a pedestrian footbridge with lifts.New car park for Oatley Station as access upgrades get the green light, Transport for NSW, 30 October 2014.$23 million contract awarded for Oatley station upgrade and new 100 space car park, Transport for NSW, 19 January 2015Oatley Station Upgrade, Transport for NSW Platforms and services Track layout with crossovers north of station allow trains to terminate on either platform  Description  The complex comprises a type 11 platform building, erected in 1905 to replace the original type 4 building erected in 1890; a signal box extension, erected in 1918; the Mulga Road underbridge and pedestrian subway, erected in 1905; an island platform, erected in 1905; a concrete drop-slab location hut, erected in 1920s; platform canopies, erected in 1992; and moveable items, dated from 1918. ;Context The entry to Oatley Railway Station is via a subway entered from the southern footpath of Mulga Road below the arch of the Mulga Road rail underbridge (road tunnel). There is one island platform, which is curved, has brick edges and asphalt surface. Modern canopies roof the pedestrian subway in the middle of the underbridge, and connect to the platform building. ;Platform buildings (1890, 1905, 1918) The original 1890 building was rebuilt at its current location and altered to an island platform building in 1905. This is a weatherboard island platform building with a 1918 signal box extension at the northern end to protect the original signal levers. There is also a signalling board (not operational). The building has timber posts and brackets to awnings on each side, with timber valances to awning ends. The waiting area has timber panelled double doors, 9-paned timber framed double hung windows with fanlights and sidelights to the waiting area doors on both sides. Doors are modern timber flush. There are timber framed double hung windows at the northern (entry) end of the platform building, in front of which are a modern telephone and modern vending machine. The original ceilings are ripple iron with metal ceiling roses, and original internal walls are also weatherboard. Modern toilets are accessed from within the waiting area (at southern end). ;Mulga Road brick underbridge and pedestrian subway (1905) A single large span brick arch structure at 7.32 m clear span, for road access under the line, with semi-circular arches 600 mm thick. The underbridge is unusual in incorporating the pedestrian subway entry to the station, with the subway roof in the middle of the bridge (between the railway tracks). The subway is accessed off the southern footpath of Mulga Road, under the Mulga Road underbridge. ;Island platform (1905) This is a curved island platform, which has brick faces and an asphalt surface. ;Concrete drop-slab location hut (1920's) This is a small prefabricated concrete location hut to the southeast of the southern end of the station platform. It has a hipped corrugated steel roof. ;Platform canopies (1992) A modern platform canopy connects the pedestrian subway entry to the station to the platform building. Another modern platform canopy extends south of the platform building. Both canopies have gabled corrugated steel roofs, steel posts with concrete bases. ;Landscape/Natural features The station has a parkland setting near its entry point, with parks to east and west of the Mulga Road underbridge, adjacent to the northern end of the station. ;Moveable items Signalling equipment within signal box: a signal panel (not operational), signal levers and three early telephones mounted on the wall. = Condition = As at 20 May 2009, Platform building (1890) was assessed as in good condition; the signal box (1918), also in good condition; the Mulga Road Brick underbridge and pedestrian subway (1905), also good though some damage to underbridge from vehicle; the island Platform (1905), also good; the platform canopies (1992), assessed as in very good condition; and moveable items (1918) including signalling equipment, assessed as in good condition. The platform building has intact awnings and intact original form, however windows and doors have been altered. Original weatherboard walls and ripple iron ceilings remain in the interior. The Mulga Road bridge retains its original fabric. The signal box retains its original fabric. = Modifications and dates = *1905: Platform building (1890) moved and converted to island platform building *1918: weatherboard signal box added to platform building by extending northern end beneath an existing awning *1992: extension to waiting room and new toilet; modern doors and security screens to windows. At various places around the building there is clear evidence of doors and windows having been either blocked up or completely removed and re-sheeted over to match the adjoining weatherboarding.  Heritage listing  As at 15 April 2013, Oatley Railway Station - its island platform, platform building with signal box extension, moveable items, Mulga Road underbridge, pedestrian subway, and concrete location hut - was of heritage significance. Originally constructed in 1885 and relocated in 1905, Oatley Railway Station is of historical significance as a transport hub with a close relationship to the development of the suburb of Oatley since 1885, including the development of Judd's Hurstville Brickworks which operated nearby from 1884 till 1972. Oatley Railway Station also has historical association with Oatley Memorial Gardens, a series of linear parks to the east, which represent the pre-1905 alignment of the railway line. Oatley Railway Station is of aesthetic significance for its landscape setting, flanked by parks to east and west at its northern end, and for its simple yet attractive weatherboard platform building, one of only two weatherboard platform buildings on the Illawarra line. The Mulga Road underbridge and pedestrian subway are of historical significance as part of a series of railway works for upgrading the railway system, undertaken from 1905 into the 1920s. Oatley railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Oatley Railway Station, originally constructed 1885 and relocated 1905, is of historical significance as part of the second phase of construction of the Illawarra railway line, and through its relationship to the development of the suburb of Oatley from 1885. Oatley Railway Station appears to have been located in what was then a sparsely populated area due to the opening of Judd's Hurstville Brick Works nearby in 1884. The Mulga Road underbridge and pedestrian subway are of historical significance as part of a series of railway works undertaken to upgrade the line from 1905 into the 1920s. Oatley Railway Station also has historical association with Oatley Memorial Gardens, a series of linear parks to the east between Oatley Parade and Oatley Avenue, which became available as parkland after the realignment of the railway line in 1905. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Oatley Railway station is of aesthetic significance for its landscape setting, flanked by parks to east and west at its northern end, and for its simple yet attractive Federation Queen Anne style-influenced weatherboard platform building. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place, and can provide a connection to the local community's past. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The signal box demonstrates signalling technology of the early 1900s, however there are a number of other examples of this technology on the Illawarra line and elsewhere within the NSW Railways network. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The weatherboard 1905 platform building is considered a rare example for an urban context, and reflects the semi-rural nature of the area when it was built (the only other example on the Illawarra line of a weatherboard platform building in metropolitan context is at Penshurst), and it is one of only four extant weatherboard platform buildings of its type on the Illawarra line. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Oatley platform building is an example of a standard roadside building converted to an island platform building. The building is one of four weatherboard standard island platform buildings on the Illawarra line with other examples at Austinmer, Penshurst and Thirroul. The Oatley platform building is the most altered of the four extant examples (note there are 12 stations on the Illawarra line with brick examples of this type of platform building). The Mulga Road underbridge is a good representative example of brick arch construction. The Mulga Road underbridge is thought to be the second largest brick arch underbridge in the railway system. The concrete location hut is a good representative example of an Inter War period pre-cast concrete railway structure, one of many examples in the NSW Railway network.

Description While Luke Skywalker takes the first step toward setting up an academy to train a new order of Jedi Knights, Han Solo and Chewbacca are taken prisoner on the planet Kessel and forced to work in the fathomless depths of a spice mine. After Solo and Chewbacca escape, they flee desperately to a secret Imperial research laboratory surrounded by a cluster of black holes-and go from one danger to a far greater one. Summary The story begins with Han Solo and Chewbacca on a diplomatic mission from the New Republic to the spice mines of Kessel. Unbeknownst to them, Moruth Doole has taken over the space mines, and is convinced the Falcon with Solo and Chewbacca aboard is a spy ship, a prelude to invasion to seize control of the extremely lucrative spice production facilities. His small fleet, based on Kessel's solo moon, shoots down the emissaries, and brings them to Doole for questioning. He proceeds to do so by ingesting a large quantity of extremely pure glitterstim, which boosts his psychic capabilities to the point where he can forcibly invade Solo's mind and ascertain the truth. When Doole realizes that they are just diplomats, and that he has effectively declared war on the New Republic, he panics. When combined with the fact that he thinks Solo knows he was the one that ratted out he and Chewbacca to the Imperials (the result of which was that Solo was forced to dump his cargo on the Kessel Run; Jabba the Hutt then placed the bounty on his head mentioned in Episode IV), Doole decides the best course is to place the two prisoners in his mines as slave laborers where they will no doubt perish soon. In the mines, the two, with the aid of a young Kyp Durron seek for an escape. Simultaneously, Luke Skywalker embarks on his search for talented Force-sensitives whom he can mold into Jedi within his new Jedi Praxeum. Lando Calrissian, along with C-3PO and R2-D2, aid Luke with this search. In order to do so, he uses a device that supposedly can detect one's affinity to the Force. Calrissian follows one lead to the Umgullian Blob races where Dack, the possible force-sensitive, is rumored to have predictive abilities due to his successes at gambling. However, Calrissian discovers that he is cheating and exposes him. Rather than be punished by death, as is the law on Umgul, Dack is returned to the Duchess Mistral. In return, Calrissian is rewarded with half of the one million credit reward. Skywalker, meanwhile has gone to the infested planet Eol Sha where a man named Gantoris is believed to have Force-sensitivity. After two serious tests, one involving fighting a fire dragon, Gantoris agrees to come to the Jedi academy, but is still afraid about the \\"Dark man\\" he sees in his dreams that will one day end his life. After collecting Streen, an old hermit on Bespin, the trio make their way back to the Yavin 4 where the Jedi academy begins.

Counties highlighted in pink are sometimes considered part of the region. The Black Belt is a region of the U.S. state of Alabama. The term originally referred to the region's rich, black topsoil, much of it in the soil order Vertisols. The term took on an additional meaning in the 19th century, when the region was developed for cotton plantation agriculture, in which the workers were enslaved African Americans. After the American Civil War, many freedmen stayed in the area as sharecroppers and tenant farmers, continuing to comprise a majority of the population in many of these counties. The physical geography of the \\"Black Belt,\\" as related to the history of this cotton-dependent region, refers to a much larger region of the Southern United States, stretching from Delaware to Texas but centered on the Black Belt of uplands areas of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. In the antebellum and Jim Crow eras, the white elite of the Black Belt dominated Alabama state politics well into the 1960s. As in other Southern states, the white-dominated state legislature of Alabama passed laws and a constitution that created barriers to voter registration, essentially disfranchising most blacks and many poor whites. In addition, the state legislature did not redistrict congressional or state legislative districts after 1901 until it did so in the 1960s under US Supreme Court order. The white rural elite continued to dominate the state despite the rise of urbanized, industrial cities such as Birmingham. Montgomery, the Black Belt's largest city, has been the capital of Alabama since 1846. Montgomery, Selma and other parts of the Black Belt were important centers of African- American public activism during the Civil Rights Movement from the 1950s to 1968. Since the black population gained the renewed ability to exercise their franchise after 1965 under the Voting Rights Act, they have largely supported Democratic Party candidates. This is in contrast to the majority-white areas of the state, where since the late 20th century, conservatives have largely shifted from the Democratic to the Republican Party. Geology The region is underlain by a thin layer of rich, black topsoil developed atop the chalk of the Selma Group, a geologic unit dating to the Cretaceous. The soils have developed continuously at least since the Pliocene Epoch. Because the underlying chalk is nearly impermeable to groundwater, the black soils tend to dry out during the summer. The natural vegetation of the chalk belt consisted mainly of oak-hickory forest interspersed with shortgrass prairie, while the sandy ridges flanking the chalk belt supported pine forest. History Former slave cabins at Faunsdale Plantation in Marengo County. Lacking a reliable source of water, the earliest settlers avoided farming the black soil in the belt until the discovery that deep artesian wells could be drilled to supply water for people, livestock, and crops. Beginning in the 1830s after Indian Removal, cotton plantations were developed that produced the commodity crop that became Alabama's greatest source of wealth. Before the American Civil War, these plantations were worked by thousands of African-American slaves. The Black Belt region had the highest density of population in the state and was majority-black. The white planters and their elected representatives of the Black Belt established political power in the state legislature in the cotton era; the white rural elite retained their dominance long after the state began to develop more urbanized areas and an industrial economy. The state legislature did not redistrict to reflect population changes and the rise of urban areas from 1901 to 1972, when it was ordered by a federal court, following important apportionment cases such as Baker v. Carr (1964). Birmingham, the largest and most industrialized city in the state, was among those whose residents, both black and white, had been underrepresented for decades in the state legislature. The Black Belt's largest city, Montgomery, was designated as the capital of Alabama in 1846. Because Alabama was geographically central to the slave states, Montgomery was also designated as the original capital of the Confederate States of America. The region's distance from the front lines during the American Civil War saved it from much of the ravages of war. Many of the Greek Revival mansions of the 19th-century planters have survived, as have some of the plantations' slave quarters. Gaineswood in Demopolis and Magnolia Grove in Greensboro, Alabama are among those that can be visited by tourists today. Many descendants of freed slaves continued to work as sharecroppers and laborers after emancipation, but many migrated among the counties, moved to cities, or left the state for other opportunities. Around 1910‚Äì20, the infestation of the cotton crop by the boll weevil destroyed much of the crops and plantation system, but the lingering effects of a cotton economy remain evident. To escape lynchings and social oppression, and after the boll weevil and increased mechanization of agriculture, thousands of African Americans left Alabama to go to industrial cities of the North and Midwest in the Great Migration of the first half of the 20th century. But African Americans continue to make up the majority of the population in most rural Black Belt counties. Today the term \\"Black Belt\\" is mostly used by scholars and the media as a geologic characterization. Some of the most important events of the Civil Rights Movement occurred in the Black Belt of Alabama. These included Rosa Parks' refusal to give up her bus seat, which led to the Montgomery bus boycott; the Selma to Montgomery marches of 1965 and voter registration reform drives, focusing in Selma, to enable African Americans to vote (see Voting Rights Act). They had been essentially disenfranchised after conservative white Democrats regained political power in the state in the late 19th century. Whites made voter registration and voting so difficult that most blacks and many poor whites were excluded from the political system for decades. Today, Alabama's rural Black Belt includes some of the poorest counties in the United States. Along with high rates of poverty, the area is typified by declining populations, a primarily agricultural landscape with low-density settlement, high unemployment, poor access to education and medical care, substandard housing and high rates of crime. Counties The list of counties comprising the Black Belt is often dependent on the context but historically includes 18 counties: Clarke, Conecuh, Escambia, Monroe, and Washington counties are sometimes included in the region, but are usually considered part of Alabama's southern coastal plain. Lamar does not meet the soil traits but is often included due to its rural character. Demographics Alabama 2016 presidential election by county, Donald Trump in red, Hillary Clinton in blue. As of the 2000 census, Alabama's 18-county Black Belt region had a population of 589,041 (13.25% of the state's total population). There were 226,191 households and 153,357 families residing within the region. The racial makeup of the Black Belt region was 52.24% African American (307,734 people), 45.87% White (270,175 people), 0.25% Native American (1,472 people), 0.52% Asian (3,067 people), 0.03% Pacific Islander (153 people), 0.31% from other races (1,850 people), and 0.78% from two or more races (4,590 people). Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 1.09% of the population (6,404 people). The median income for a household in the Black Belt region was $27,130, and the median income for a family was $35,698. Males had a median income of $32,226 versus $22,021 for females. The per capita income for the region was $15,633. A July 1, 2007 U.S. Census Bureau estimate placed the region's population at 575,783, a decline of 2.25% since 2000. Politics In electoral maps of the 20th and early 21st centuries, the Black Belt has appeared as a \\"Blue Belt\\" because of the voters' strong support for the Democratic Party. With the exception of parts of the city of Birmingham, the outline of Alabama's 7th congressional district roughly matches the western Black Belt region. Terri Sewell (D) currently represents that district in the United States House of Representatives.

The route connects the Sonoma and Napa valleys with the Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin River Delta and the Sierra Foothills. It is constructed to freeway standards from the Fulton Road/South Wright Road stoplight in Santa Rosa, to its partial interchange with Farmers Lane (also in Santa Rosa). Route description There are six segments that are overlaps with other highways: in the Napa and Sonoma valleys with SR 121, in the southern Napa Valley with SR 29, a short overlap with I-80 at Cordelia Junction in Fairfield, another short overlap with SR 99 in Lodi, and overlaps with SR 88 and SR 26 in the Sierra foothills. The highway is mainly two lane rural highway, with the exception of short segments in Santa Rosa and Fairfield/Suisun City, the overlaps with I-80 and SR 99, and segments within developed areas, such as Santa Rosa and Lodi.California State Automobile Association map San Francisco Bay, 1-09 edition SR 12 begins in the west at its junction with SR 116 in Sebastopol. After passing east through Santa Rosa on a mix of freeway, surface street, and expressway, it turns south into the Sonoma Valley, passing the Jack London State Historic Park at Glen Ellen. It winds through Sonoma on surface streets, where the historic Vallejo Estate and Sonoma Mission, both part of the Sonoma State Historic Park, are. South of Sonoma, SR 12 turns east, joining SR 121 for nearly nine miles, then turns south briefly as it leaves SR 121 and joins the four-lane expressway SR 29 to cross the Napa River. Four miles after joining SR 29 it splits off towards the east on Jameson Canyon Road; this section is also the 1928 re-alignment of the Lincoln Highway, the first road across America. After a brief merge with Interstate 80, SR 12 branches off to the east as an expressway through Fairfield and Suisun City. East of Suisun it becomes two lanes again and crosses south of Travis Air Force Base, through rolling fields with numerous wind turbines. Just past Braid's Bridge is the Western Railway Museum. At Rio Vista, SR 12 crosses the Helen Madere Memorial Bridge over the Sacramento River, entering the California Delta. This stretch of the river has twice been the site of much-publicized inland excursions by humpback whales, presumably veering off course while making their annual migrations along the Pacific coast. In 1985 Humphrey the whale swam about as far as the Rio Vista Bridge. In 2007 a humpback mother and calf dubbed Delta and Dawn circled for several days just upstream of the bridge, seemingly reluctant to pass under it again after having spent the previous three or four weeks upriver near Sacramento. From the Sacramento River to the junction with Interstate 5, SR 12 crosses several of the waterways of the California Delta and the low-lying fields between them. Through Lodi it becomes a wide four-lane business route. After another brief merger with another freeway, this time SR 99, SR 12 heads east into the Sierra foothills (with shared segments with SR 88 and SR 26) before ending at the junction with SR 49 just north of San Andreas. SR 12 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and from I-80 to SR 88 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 12 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System; however, it is only designated as a scenic highway from its intersection with Danielli Avenue east of Santa Rosa to its junction with London Way near Agua Caliente, meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a \\"memorable landscape\\" with no \\"visual intrusions\\", where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community. SR 12 has been designated by various state laws and through local usage as the Valley of the Moon Scenic Route (the portion running through Sonoma County, though the first sign with this name is at the intersection of Farmers Lane and Fourth Street in Santa Rosa); Luther Burbank Memorial Highway from Santa Rosa to Sebastopol (after botanist Luther Burbank). SR 12 is also known as Sonoma Highway between Santa Rosa and the west side of the city of Sonoma; Broadway between Sonoma Plaza and its junction with SR 121 in Schellville; Carneros Highway for the length of its concurrency with 121 between Schellville and its junction and the north end of its concurrency with SR 29 near Napa; Jameson Canyon Road from where its concurrency with SR 29 ends in American Canyon to its junction with I-80 in Cordelia; and Rio Vista Highway from I-80 to SR 160 east of Rio Vista,California Highway Patrol: CADWEB Name from CHP traffic reports.

The segment through Lodi to the overlap with SR 99 is on Kettleman Lane.California State Automobile Association map Gold Country, 7-05 edition History Route 12 between Lodi and Jackson Before the 1964 renumbering, this route was signed as Sign Route 12 for most of its length. However, SR 12 was designated as Legislative Route 51 (LR 51) from SR 116 to SR 121 before the 1964 renumbering. Portions of the route from SR 29 to I-80 ran concurrently with State Route 29 or with State Route 37; this was also LR 8 and a former routing of US 40. The portion from I-80 to then-US 99 was designated as LR 53 in 1919; from US 99 to SR 49, it was designated as LR 24. In 1976, the discontinuity resulting from the concurrency with State Route 84 was removed. Future extension Plans call for a western extension of its western terminus to State Route 1 near Bodega Bay.Democrat: County OKs bypass around Forestville , accessed June 15, 2010 Plans also called for Route 12 to be built as a freeway from Farmers Lane to Melita Road, in Santa Rosa; however, as of 2014, this project was delayed due to community opposition.

Under the common law, such evidence was at one time considered hearsay - a statement made out of court being introduced to prove the truth of the statement - and was not admissible except to rebut the testimony of an opposing expert witness. There were four ways to introduce such evidence: # Adduce testimony that the opposing expert witness actually used that text to reach his conclusions; # Adduce testimony by the opposing expert admitting that the text is an authority in the field; # Have a friendly expert witness testifying against the opposing expert witness attest to the authoritativeness of the text. # Have the judge take judicial notice of the text, if it is sufficiently notable that the average person would know that it is an authority (for example, Gray's Anatomy). Under the Federal Rules of Evidence 803 (18), either party can introduce a learned treatise as evidence, irrespective of whether it is being used to rebut the opposing party. Such texts are now considered an exception to hearsay, with two limitations: # For the learned treatise to be introduced, there must be an expert witness on the stand; # Like a recorded recollection, the actual learned treatise does not go to the jury, but instead comes into evidence only by being read to the jury.

It produces random mutations in genetic material by nucleotide substitution; particularly by guanine alkylation. This typically produces only point mutations. It can induce mutations at a rate of 5x10‚àí4 to 5x10‚àí2 per gene without substantial killing. The ethyl group of EMS reacts with guanine in DNA, forming the abnormal base O6-ethylguanine. During DNA replication, DNA polymerases that catalyze the process frequently place thymine, instead of cytosine, opposite O6-ethylguanine. Following subsequent rounds of replication, the original G:C base pair can become an A:T pair (a transition mutation). This changes the genetic information, is often harmful to cells, and can result in disease. EMS is often used in genetics as a mutagen. Mutations induced by EMS can then be studied in genetic screens or other assays.

Chem. 2008. 59:1‚Äì26 received his bachelor's degree in 1952 from Brooklyn College, and earned his master's and doctorate from Harvard University in 1954 and 1955, respectively. He was almost unable to attend graduate school due to contracting tuberculosis, but was cured of the disease through an experimental treatment of isoniazid and streptomycin. He remained at Harvard as a Junior Fellow for three years, although he spent the last two years of the fellowship doing research work at Yale University's Chemistry Department. After the fellowship, he joined the faculty of The University of Chicago in 1957, where he has remained since. Rice has served the university in a wide variety of capacities during his fifty-seven year tenure. He served as the director of the James Franck Institute (the university's center for physical chemistry and condensed matter physics) from 1961 to 1967. He was Chairman of the Department of Chemistry from 1971 to 1976 and was Dean of the Physical Sciences Division from 1981 to 1995. He served as Dean for the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago from October 2006 through October 2010, and has served as Interim President of the Institute since October 2010. In addition to his work at the University, he is currently on the Board of Governors at Tel Aviv UniversityProgram Members of The Board Of Governors - Tel Aviv University and has served as editor for the journals Chemical Physics LettersChemical Physics Letters - Elsevier and Advances in Chemical Physics,Wiley Interscience and co- authored several physical chemistry textbooks with Stephen Berry and John Ross.OUP: UK General Catalogue Research Stuart Rice began his scientific career as a high school student and published on this work.Levine M, Rice SA. 1950. Effect of folic acid, aminopterin and vitamin K on growth of roots in Allium cepa. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 74:310‚Äì12 He completed his doctoral dissertation under Paul Doty, contributing to the then-emerging field of DNA research; the project shared both experimental and theoretical components, which became a hallmark of his later work. During his time at Yale, Stuart Rice began to study the transport properties of liquids. He helped to determine the properties of liquid noble gases and methane, while also exploring the theoretical background of transport in liquids as well, comparing the results to simulations of Lennard-Jones fluids. Following this work he helped to develop the theory of electronic excitations (excitons) in molecular crystals and liquids, eventually moving into the area of radiationless molecular transitions, beginning his own experimental work after the development of the Bixon-Jortner model, while also working with collaborators on extending the theoretical model of these transitions. This research led him to investigate the effects of quantum chaos on excited molecules, and to couple the developing model of transitions with quantum chaos in order to attain control of the transition of excited molecules. This led to the field of Coherent control, quantum control through laser excitation, which was developed by other scientists at the University of Chicago. At the same time, he also began work on understanding the electrical properties of liquid metals, where the lack of translational orders frustrated attempts to understand their electronic band structure. The discrepancy between the dielectric results of reflectivity and ellipsometry data of liquid mercury led to work on the nature of conductivity at the liquid-vapor surface of liquid metal, ultimately showing that the existence of ion inhomogeneities at the interface led to electronic changes in the bulk liquid that persist for several atomic diameters into a liquid. Smaller research topics that Rice has published on included work on the chemistry of water, the theory of freezing liquids, the properties of monolayers on liquids, and confined colloidal systems, amongst others. Honors and awards Rice's most prestigious award is the National Medal of Science, the highest scientific prize awarded in the United States, in 1999. He was awarded the Wolf Prize in Chemistry in 2011, along with Krzysztof Matyjaszewski and Ching Tang.The 2011 Wolf Prize in Chemistry He is a Fellow of both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1970 Rice was awarded the Llewellyn John and Harriet Manchester Quantrell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching, the nation‚Äôs oldest prize for undergraduate teaching, a highly esteemed faculty award at The University of Chicago. Impact Over the course of his long career Rice has shaped much debate on theoretical physical chemistry. He is cited on the National Medal of Science \\"for changing the very nature of modern physical chemistry through his research, teaching and writing, using imaginative approaches to both experiment and theory that have inspired a new generation of scientists.\\" With over 100 doctoral students to his credit, Stuart Rice has had a great impact on the field of physical chemistry simply through the number of research scientists he has trained.Rice, Straus to receive Maclean Theoretical chemist David Tannor, who is the Hermann Mayer Professorial Chair in the Department of Chemical Physics at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, did his post-doc work with Stuart Rice and David W.

Personal life Rice is also famous on campus for eating lunch almost every weekday at the university's Quadrangle Club restaurant (a faculty club), where he has dined over 9,000 times. Rice is known to sit at the head of the Chemistry table, not because he is the most senior member of the department, but because he is very tall.The University of Chicago Magazine Rice was married to Marian Coopersmith from 1952 until her death in 1994.

Overview View from Jaco Island to the South East to Timor Jaco lies just off the eastern end of the island of Timor, part of the Tutuala subdistrict in Laut√©m District, and is separated from the mainland in front of Valu Beach by a channel navigable by small vessels. It is low lying, with an area of and a maximum elevation of about . It is covered mainly by tropical dry forest, fringed by strand vegetation and sandy beaches. There are some low cliffs on the southern coast. History The limestone Island was made out of coral and is surrounded by limestone cliffs and coral reefs. There was one lighthouse on the island built by Indonesia but in 2010 the structure was removed. To the locals, the island is considered sacred due to the two seas meeting. Climate The average annual temperature is roughly . On average the island receives of rain and the north and east coast of the small island is somewhat drier. Wildlife The island supports populations of bar-necked cuckoo-doves, black cuckoo-doves, pink-headed imperial pigeons, streak-breasted honeyeaters, fawn-breasted whistlers, blue-cheeked flowerpeckers, flame-breasted sunbirds and Timor sparrows. The Javan rusa native deer can also be found on the island and unlike mainland deer, they have become accustomed to drinking salt water due to the lack of freshwater on the island.
