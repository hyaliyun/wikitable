Richardson's published work was anonymous, initialled (C.E.R.; C.E.; or R.), or as Mrs. G. G. Richardson. Scottish Women Poets - Mrs. G. G. Richardson (1777-1853). The ODNB concurs in its use of Catherine. and published as Mrs. G. G. Richardson) was a Scottish author and poet who published a four-volume novel and three collections of verse. Biography Catherine Eliza Richardson was born in 1777 to Phoebe Scott (n√©e Dixon) and James Scott, a landowner of considerable property and Justice of the peace in the Scottish borders village of Canonbie, Dumfriesshire. She is described being 'born into favourable circumstances' as one of a 'numerous family of brothers and sisters', of 'educated and intellectual' parents. Her childhood was spent in the borders, but in 1799 she travelled to India, where on 29 April at Fort George, Madras she married her cousin Gilbert Geddes Richardson, a mariner, captain of an East Indiaman and partner in a trading house, Colt, Baker, Hart & Co. Her connection with India is specified as her uncle, 'General, afterwards Lord Harris'.George Harris, 1st Baron Harris fits the description of a General, later elevated to the peerage, active in Madras in 1799, but his connection with the Scottish Richardson family is unclear. She quickly had five children with Gilbert; he is recorded as having died on 30 August 1805. She returned from India to Canonbie to raise her young children, but moved to London during their teenage years, returning once more to Canonbie in 1821, where she remained until her death on 9 October 1853.Jackson in the ODNB specifies that she returned to England with three of her children; Mrs. MacArthur specifies she had five children, all of whom survived her. Richardson was an intimate of Thomas Carlyle, who in his Reminiscences remarks on her as 'poor and hospitable Mrs. Richardson, once a \\"novelist\\" of mark, much of a gentlewoman and loved by us both.' Works Richardson's first-published work is thought to be the 1801 four-volume novel Adonia - A Desultory Story; her authorship rests on strong circumstantial evidence - the published volumes omits the author's name.Mrs. MacArthur suggests that Richardson wrote a three-volume novel, Adonia in the 1820s or 1830s; Frank Miller's The poets of Dumfriesshire (1910) repeats this assertion. She published poems in a short-lived London Weekly Review (LWR) periodical edited by David Lester Richardson in the 1827-29 period, and he is supposed to have encouraged her to publish collections on her own account. Henry Colburn's The New Monthly Magazine, in a review of Poems, speculated that the two were related; David Richardson was an East India Company officer, on furlough to the UK during the LWR period. In 1828 she published a first collection, Poems, by private subscription running to 1,700 copies. It was reviewed with considerable scorn in The Edinburgh Literary Journal: 'How Mrs. G. G. Richardson took it into her head to publish a volume of \\"Poems\\" is a good deal more than we can understand...'; and more blandly in The Athenaeum as a work of 'chasteness ... of thought and language, pleasing and appropriate similes, natural metaphors and very gentle pathos ... [with] a vein of melancholy running through the whole.' Poems was reprinted in 1828 and a third edition published in 1829; a review of the third in The Imperial Magazine remarked on the number of reprints. It characterised the subject-matter as 'local, circumscribed and domestic' and 'not of the highest order', but found that 'excellencies of a more exalted order occasionally burst upon us', which 'compensate for obvious deficiencies' and render the work 'in an unquestionably respectable light. Richardson next published Poems: Second Series in 1834. A review in The Metropolitan found them 'above the common- place' and 'with considerable humour', but 'unequal within themselves', having blemishes or faults which detract from first impressions. The New Monthly Magazine received the second series with high praise: 'full of poetic gems' each without exception showing 'evidence of an elegant and highly cultivated mind'. A third set of poems, Grandmamma's Sampler; with some other Rhymes for Children was published in 1836. Chambers's Journal commented in 1876 that Richardson was in the class of 'forgotten or little known poets', and opines that her work 'is not characterised by striking originality of thought', but 'clear and pure, sometimes sparking, more frequently soft and gentle'. The article notes that she continued to write poetry during the latter years of her life, as well as stories, some of which were published. =Summary of works= *Adonia (1801) Volume I Volume II Volume III Volume IV *Poems (1828) *Poems: Second Series (1834) *Grandmamma's Sampler; with some other Rhymes for Children (1836) Notes References External links Category:1777 births Category:1853 deaths Category:Scottish women poets Category:Scottish women writers Category:People from Dumfries and Galloway Category:18th-century Scottish novelists Category:19th-century Scottish poets Category:19th-century British women writers Category:19th-century British writers Category:18th-century women writers ","title":"Catherine Eliza Richardson"},{"id":"51809561","text":"Ji«én, () is a Han surname meaning \\"simple\\".

An Encyclopedia of Continental Women Writers, vol. 1. New York: Garland, pp. 161‚Äì164.Jantzen, A. 1888. Birgitte Cathrine Boye. In: Carl Frederik Bricka (ed.), Dansk biografisk Lexikon, vol. 2, pp. 569‚Äì570. Copenhagen: Gyldendal. Early life Birgitte Cathrine Boye was born in Gentofte, Denmark as the oldest child of the royal hunting official Jens Johannissen and his wife Dorthe Henriksdatter. At the age of 13, she fell in love with the forest manager Herman Michelsen Herz, whom she married in 1763. In the course of five years, she had four children, but nonetheless studied German, French, and English on her own so that she could read literature in these languages. Hymnwriter In 1773, she delivered 20 hymns in response to an announcement, and they were well received. In the mid-1700s, Pietism had suffered a strong setback in Denmark, which also had an effect on hymnwriting, and lofty poetry came into fashion instead. Ludvig Harboe and Ove H√∏egh-Guldberg were commissioned to write a new hymnal, and in January 1778 they produced the draft for Psalme-Bog eller En Samling af gamle og nye Psalmer (Hymnal or A Collection of Old and New Hymns), known as Guldberg's hymnal. This hymnal contained 132 hymns from Kingo's hymnal and 143 from Erik Pontoppidan's hymnal. A full 146 of the hymns were written by Birgitte Cathrine Boye, who made her mark on the new Danish hymnal in this way.Holsvik, Ivar. 1950. Salmediktere i v√•re salmeb√∏ker.

Birgitte Cathrine Boye wrote her hymns during a turbulent time in her life: her husband died in 1775, and in 1778 she married again, to the customs inspector and judicial adviser Hans Boye. The hymnal was subject to much criticism, and this criticism was also directed at Boye and her hymns. Many found her hymns to be rather pompous. She accepted the criticism, and declined in 1790 when she was asked to provide hymns for a new hymnal. However, some of her hymns live on, and she became known a female composer of pulpit hymns. Her pulpit hymns are still sung on festival days in many Nordic countries. She is represented in the 1985 Norwegian hymnal with one translated hymn and three pulpit hymns published in both Bokm√•l and Nynorsk. Birgitte Cathrine Boye also wrote a number of plays, including Melicerte (1780) and Gorm den gamle, et heroisk S√∏rgespil (Gorm the Old: A Heroic Tragedy, 1781). 1985 and 2013 Norwegian hymnals The Church of Norway's 1985 hymnal and 2013 hymnal contain three hymns by Boye, translated by Elias Blix. *No. 47/48 \\"En frelser er oss f√∏dt i dag\\" / \\"I dag er f√∏dd ein frelsar stor\\" (A Savior Is Born Today) *No. 177/178 \\"Han er oppstanden, store bud\\" / \\"Han er oppstaden dyre ord\\" (He is Arisen!

The hall seated 1,200 people, and the balcony was the first in the United States to \\"span an auditorium without intermediate buttressing\\".Elia, Mario Manieri (1996). Louis Henry Sullivan. Princeton: Princeton Architectural Press. p. 64. The ceiling and walls of the auditorium were covered with Louis Sullivan's distinctive decorations. Mario Elia, in his study of Sullivan and his work, suggests that the broad projecting roof was a detail contributed by Frank Lloyd Wright, who was employed at Sullivan's office at the time. The building was topped by a tower. On the night of February 28 ‚Äì March 1, 1922, the Pueblo Grocers' Association's annual ball was held there, and it is believed that a cigarette may have ignited litter left behind after the event. The fire was discovered at 1:15 a.m., the roof collapsed at 1:50, and all the interior floors had given way by 2:10. Despite the fire department's efforts to save the building, it was a total loss.

It does so by coordinating an international network of academics, most of whom are Roman Catholic. Early beginnings The Institute was established by Dr John Wijngaards in 1983 as Housetop Centre for Adult Faith Formation (\\"Housetop\\"). Initially, it focused on producing resources for spirituality in the modern age. Nationwide research in the UK produced material for a video course on the practice of meditation: \\"The Seven Circles of Prayer\\" (1987), winner of the award for \\"Creative Excellence\\" at the 1987 Video Festival in Elmhurst, Illinois, USA. It was followed by two other video courses: \\"Peace in your Home\\" (1988) on ways of fostering prayer in the family, and \\"Loaves of Thanksgiving\\" (1989) on re- vitalising the celebration of the weekly Eucharist. The \\"Walking on Water\\" video courses for training community leaders were produced between 1990-1992 and have been translated into 14 languages. They comprised three textbooks and nine 30-minute stories on accompanying videos. The stories were filmed in Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Kenya and the UK. Several of those videos won awards. In 1995 Housetop published \\"How To Make Sense of God\\". The course book received a prize from the Catholic Press Association (USA) for \\"best adult reading\\". The accompanying video film \\"Journey to the Centre of Love\\" comprises 5 episodes of approximately 45 minutes each, which are freely available online. It won the Grand Prix at the Catholic International Film Festival at Warsaw in 1995 and the Columbus Award (the main award) at the International Film Fair of Columbus, Ohio, in 1996. Housetop‚Äôs latest video course focused on Christian marriage. \\"For Better, For Worse\\" was produced in 2000 with academic advice from the International Academy for Marital Spirituality (INTAMS). It was broadcast on the Belgian Catholic television network KTRC in autumn 2000 under the title \\"Tussen Man & Vrouw\\" (\\"Between Husband & Wife\\"). It is being distributed in the UK and Ireland by Veritas Publications. Catherine of Siena Virtual College In 2007 Housetop founded the Catherine of Siena Virtual College (\\"CSVC\\"), which offered affordable university-level online courses on leadership and the role of women in society. Under its direction more than 1,100 students enrolled, mostly women (90%), and from developing countries. Such a rapid growth has meant that it became difficult for the Institute to provide an adequate infra-structure to do justice to its potential. For this reason, in September 2014 Housetop, which by then had been renamed the Wijngaards Institute for Catholic Research, agreed to hand over ownership of CSVC to the University of Roehampton, which has renamed it the \\"Catherine of Siena College\\". Focus on Church reform Pope John-Paul II's Ordinatio sacerdotalis in 1994 which ruled out the ordination of women in the Catholic Church forced the question of women's equality within the Roman Catholic Church to the front. It was decided that the Institute would focus its research on the ordination of women and publish a website to present the academic evidence for and against. The website has grown out to be the largest internet resource on women and holy orders, with extensive documentation in 25 languages.; Subsequent research led to several declarations, statements, and reports being produced: *The \\"Catholic Scholars' Declaration on Authority in the Church\\", calling for democratization of church structures in line with Vatican Council II. It was published on 11 October 2012.; Newsblogs: ; Signed by 216 academics from 139 universities around the world, it was officially launched in the British Houses of Parliament on 5 March 2013.; *The \\"Catholic Scholars' Statement on Marriage and the Family\\", submitted in preparation for the Synods of Bishops of 2014 and 2015.; *The \\"Documented Appeal to Pope Francis to Request the Reinstatement of the Ordained Diaconate for Women\\", sent to the Vatican on 3 September 2013. *The \\"Catholic Scholars' Statement on the Ethics of Using Contraceptives\\", based on an interdisciplinary study by 23 international academics. The Statement was co-signed by more than 150 Catholic scholars and launched at an event at the United Nations in New York on 20 September 2016. It recommends that \\"the Catholic 'magisterium' seek the opinion of Christian theologians and experts in other relevant disciplines with regard to the ethics of using modern non- abortifacient contraceptives for the purposes of family planning\\", with a view to repealing the prohibition to use so-called \\"artificial\\" contraceptives upheld by Pope Paul VI in his encyclical Humanae Vitae of 1968.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; The online dissemination of the Statement before its official launch provoked the launch of a counter-statement at the Catholic University of America in Washington, titled \\"Affirmation of the Church‚Äôs Teaching on the Gift of Sexuality\\".; References External links * http://www.wijngaardsinstitute.com * http://www.johnwijngaards.com Category:Organizations established in 1983 Category:Research institutes in England Category:Catholicism in the United Kingdom Category:Liberalism in the United Kingdom ","title":"Wijngaards Institute for Catholic Research"},{"id":"51810620","text":"Opossum Creek may refer to: *Opossum Creek (Little Osage River), a stream in Kansas *Opossum Creek (Big Creek), a stream in Missouri *Opossum Creek (Conewago Creek tributary), a stream in Pennsylvania See also *Opossum Branch *Opossum Run ","title":"Opossum Creek"},{"id":"51810627","text":"√âtienne Pariset √âtienne Pariset (5 August 1770, in Grand - 3 July 1847, in Paris) was a French physician and psychiatrist.

He wrote jingles for McDonald's, the National Safety Council, and V8, but he is best known for the long-running jingle for Oscar Mayer wieners. Adver/Sonic Productions was formed by Henry Brandon, Trentlage, and Jack Sherred. Early life Trentlage was born in Chicago, Illinois, where he attended Calumet High School. He composed his first jingle in high school, and he played guitar in a band with his brother and a friend. He graduated from Calumet in 1947. Career Trentlage later enjoyed playing the banjo ukelele. He went to work in advertising and was employed by large firms that included McCann Erickson. Trentlage wrote jingles for McDonald's (\\"McDonald's is your kind of place!\\"), the National Safety Council (\\"Buckle up for safety, buckle up!\\") and V8 (\\"Wow! It sure doesn't taste like tomato juice.\\"), founding Adver/Sonic Productions. In the late 1990s Trentlage was living in Fox River Grove, Illinois and still writing jingles. In 1962, Trentlage learned that Oscar Mayer was holding a jingle contest for its hot dogs. With the deadline the next day, he wrote: For the recording, Trentlage played the banjo ukelele while his son and daughter sang the words and his wife played the standup bass. Trentlage's daughter Linda had a stuffy nose at the time of the recording, and Mayer thought that mothers would identify with children who had stuffy noses. A year later, Trentlage's submission was selected. Mayer sent Trentlage and his children to a Chicago recording studio, with Linda suffering from a stuffy nose again. After successfully testing it in the Houston market, Oscar Mayer used the jingle in its advertising from 1963 to 2010. The company later credited it with the success of the product's nationwide distribution. In a 2008 interview he said he was still receiving royalties from the Oscar Mayer jingle, which had helped put his children through college. Personal life He was married to his first wife, Vivian Youngs, for 23 years and had five children. After divorcing, he married his second wife, Jackie, in the 1980s. Trentlage died of heart failure in 2016 at a hospital in Libertyville, Illinois. He was survived by his second wife and several children and stepchildren.

The avenue in May 2004. The Hokkaido University poplar avenue is a path lined with poplar trees, situated in the Hokkaido University campus in Sapporo, Japan. It extends from the back of the Psychology Department to the first of Hokkaido University's farms. The avenue is a well-known symbol of the university, and is introduced as one of the three most famous attractions in Sapporo on the Japan National Tourism Organization's website for visitors to Japan.Sapporo Area (Japan National Tourism Organization)  History  The origins of the poplar avenue can be found in the few trees brought back from America in 1903 by Mori Hiroshi, son of the second principal of the Sapporo Agricultural College, Mori Genzo. These trees were planted to extend the existing row of Acacia trees by Minami Takajir≈ç, a professor at the college. In 1911, Minami accompanied Nitobe Inaz≈ç on a voyage to America. During the trip he bought several poplar trees and brought them back to Hokkaido to use as windbreaks for the college's farm. The next year, the assistant Ueda Hanjir≈ç and the college's students planted these trees next to the existing poplars, and the poplar avenue was born. In 1954, several poplar trees were felled as a result of typhoon Marie. A 1959 typhoon caused greater damage still, felling more than 10 trees. As a result, people called for the removal of the remaining trees for safety reasons. However, after Kingo Machimura, the Governor of Hokkaido, received a letter from a 9-year-old girl who objected to the removal of the trees, and he ordered that more saplings be planted. The poplar avenue increased to a greater size; though afterward the avenue was placed off-limits due to the risk of falling trees. On September 8, 2004, the trees in Hokkaido University were almost destroyed by Typhoon Songda. Of the roughly 50 poplar trees in the avenue, only 32 remained (including two that were replanted). One of the trees that was still in good condition was taken to a sawmill in Asahikawa and turned into a harpsichord. New saplings were planted in places where trees in the avenue were missing, and by scattering wood chip on the path, part of the avenue was made available for public viewing again.  Recognition  The poplar avenue was selected as No. 88 in Sapporo, Furusato to Bunka Hyakusen, a pamphlet made by Sapporo City for the 120th anniversary of the founding of Sapporo, and as No. 15 in section No. 1, \\"Road of Literature and Learning\\", in Kita-ku Rekishi to Bunka no Hachiju Hachi Sen, a selection of 88 historical places in Sapporo's north ward published by the north ward office.

It is an unusually cool star, rapidly losing mass and surrounded by dense gas and dust producing masers. Distance In the absence of a measure of its parallax by the Hipparcos satellite, its distance from the solar system was estimated between 1,860 and 2,770 light-years. Gaia Data Release 2 published a parallax of , indicating a distance around , but the observations have a very high noise level and are considered unreliable. A distance of is preferred. Spectral type With a spectral type of S3,4e-S5,8e, S Cassiopeiae is an S-type star similar to œá Cygni; these are asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars similar to those of class M except that the dominant spectral bands of metal oxides are formed by metals of the fifth period of the periodic table as zirconium or yttrium. Another feature of this class of stars is the high mass loss; in the case of S Cassiopeiae it is estimated at per year. Characteristics S Cassiopeiae has a radius of 934 solar radii; if placed at the center of the Solar System, it would extend past the orbit of Mars and the Asteroid Belt. Its effective temperature is 1,800 K, which is exceptionally cool for any star, and its bolometric luminosity is 5,210 times that of the sun. S Cassiopeiae is a variable Mira, a pulsating variable star whose visual brightness varies over several magnitudes with a somewhat regular period and amplitude. Its visual magnitude varies between +7.9 and +16.1 over an average period of 612.43 days. Mira variables are stars in the last stages of evolution whose instability comes from pulsations in its surface, causing changes in color and brightness.

The parish was united with that of St Mary Kalendar and the old church was taken down in March 1840, rebuilt to designs by the architect William Gover of Winchester, and reopened on 21 July 1842, when it was consecrated by the Bishop of Winchester. The body of the church was taken down in the late 1950s. The only remains are the 15th-century tower, built of flint and rubble and incorporating a Norman arch, which is Grade II listed. The tower also displays a sundial and the arms of King George III. Organ The church contained a pipe organ dating from 1756 by Father Smith. When the church closed this was moved to St Thomas' Church, Southgate Street, and when that church closed, it moved again to St Deny's Church, Portswood, Southampton.

Until 1919 they were a ring of five, however during that year the bells were taken to Gillett and Johnston of Croydon, had their canons removed and a treble added to give six bells. These were taken out and in 1957, were given to the Church of the Ascension, Bitterne Park, Southampton, where they were augmented to eight with the addition of two trebles and the tenor being recast by Mears and Stainbank. In 2008 they were augmented to twelve with the addition of four trebles, all cast by Hayward Mills Associates, making them the world's lightest ring of twelve bells hung in a church.

In addition to being cultivated by humans for thousands of years, Ficus is also known for their reproductive mutualism with the fig wasp. common fig exposing its many tiny matured, seed-bearing gynoecia. These are pollinated by the fig wasp, Blastophaga psenes. In the cultivated fig, there are also asexual mutants. Fig trees either produce hermaphrodite fruit known as caprifigs, or female figs; only the female figs are palatable to humans. In exchange for a safe place for their eggs and larvae, fig wasps help pollinate the ficus by crawling inside the tiny hole in the apex of the fig, called the ostiole, without knowing whether they crawled into a caprifig or a fig. If the female wasp crawls into the caprifig, she can successfully lay her eggs and die. The males hatch first, mate with the females, dig tunnels out of the caprifig, and die. The females, now covered in fig pollen from the caprifig, fly out to begin the cycle again. If the female wasp crawls into a female fig, she will not be able to successfully lay her eggs despite pollinating the fig with pollen from the caprifig she hatched in. The fig will absorb her body and her eggs as the fruit develops.\\"Fig.\\" Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed. History Aristotle noted in Historia animalium that wild figs contain psenes that begin as grubs, but whose skin splits allowing the psen to fly out. The psen flies into a cultivated fig, and stops it from falling. He noted further that Greek farmers planted wild figs next to cultivated figs, and tied wild fig fruits on to the cultivated trees.  Mechanisms and outcomes  Overall, the coevolution of Ficus and wasps can be explained through the specificity of Ficus as a host and the tendency of the wasp species to frequent hosts different to that of their original Ficus plant, thus increasing the likelihood of hybrids and eventually new species. =Ficus domination in mutualism= Ficus typically control the reproductive mutualism with fig wasps by being highly selective in their choice of pollinator. Contributing to the evolution of Ficus, pollinator specificity in Ficus is a pre-zygotic mechanism of reproductive isolation among plant species in diverse angiosperm lineages with varying degrees of sympatry and of gene flow in hybrid zones. This is proven by the high host specificity and low pollinator sharing ratios found in fig pollinators, especially in the genera Ceratosolen and Kradibia. Morphological examples of such specificity includes the diameters of ostioles compared to the head widths of the respective wasp species. While the fig species F. wassa have a diameter of 1.0-1.5 mm, its pollinator K. wassae had an average head width of 0.58 mm. = Pollinator-sharing = Pollinator-sharing affects plant species integrity, the delimitation of Ficus species, and the importance of host- switching in shaping the evolutionary history of the mutualism. As indicated by host-pollinator co-phylogenies from neotropical monoecious figs, pollinator-sharing could lead to new host species and host-switching. This could essentially lead to interspecific hybrids in both wasps and figs. A rare possibility is the evolution of cheating in conjunction with a pollinator host shift. In other words, host-sharing species will not even be sister species and may compete for resources. The origin of cheating within a mutualistic lineage has also been shown in yucca moths. = Cospeciation = Despite some significant differences in the fig and pollinator phylogenies, analyses indicate that cospeciation has occurred in the history of the Ficus-wasp mutualism. Contrary to popular belief, the phylogenic conflicts found among figs and wasps are not due to chance differences in the nucleotide substitution patterns in pollinator mtDNA and fig nrDNA. Furthermore, the potential for lineage sorting, a form of genetic drift, in pollinator mtDNA should be low due to inbreeding and small effective population size. Thus, hybridization does not appear to have played a major role in the evolution of fig and pollinator lineages, based on a maximum likelihood test.

Wiskari's parents were Finnish immigrants. Wiskari served in Pacific Theater of World War II as a member of the U.S. Navy. After the war he studied journalism at Columbia University and began his career with The New York Times in 1948 as a radio news scriptwriter. From 1958‚Äì1964, Wiskari was a correspondent for the New York Times in Northern Europe. He was based in Stockholm, where he reported on the annual Nobel Prize award winners, the difficulties both Sweden as well as Finland faced with staying neutral in the shadow of the Soviet Union during the midst of the Cold War, and about general Nordic life. In 1959, Wiskari was the first foreign journalist to interview the President of Finland Urho Kekkonen. Wiskari visited Kekkonen several times in Helsinki, Finland even after his post ended in Stockholm. In 1968, Wiskari became an assistant to the foreign news editor at The New York Times. Shortly thereafter, in 1971, he served as a member of a team of editors who were charged with preparing the Pentagon papers which covered the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War for publication. In 1978, Wiskari reported that Finnish President Urho Kekkonen was suffering from memory problems. He was the only western journalist to do so because the Finnish media censored the illness of the president. In the 1980s, Wiskari reported on the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. Wiskari retired from journalism in 1984 and moved to Charlestown, Rhode Island. He wrote a memoir, Bad Weather Bird, on his time in Northern Europe. Wiskari was a member of Charlestown's local council, serving as a Democrat member.

The impetus for the measure largely resulted from the Oklahoma Blaine Amendment being used as a justification for a 5-year legal battle to deny services and access to state funding for special needs children. The Oklahoma Supreme Court resolved that fight in early 2016 in Oliver v. Hofmeister.  Blaine Amendment History  After the Blaine Amendment failed to receive the super-majority of necessary votes to be considered for the U.S. Constitution, its advocates at the federal level began to demand states like Oklahoma include it in their Constitutions to be considered for statehood. The amendment arose during a time of strong anti-Catholic sentiment as a way to block funding for Catholic schools, but it has been more recently used in Oklahoma as a justification for a series of lawsuits against the state over a program meant to help provide better services to special needs children. It was also used as the justification for the removal of Oklahoma's Ten Commandment monument. Oklahoma was forced to adopt the Blaine Amendment at its constitutional convention in 1906.  Lindsey Nicole Scholarship Program for Children with Disabilities Cases  Question 790 largely arose in response to a series of lawsuits filed against the parents of a special needs child and then against the State Board of Education. Jenks vs. Spry, Kimery vs. Brown, and finally Oliver v. Hofmeister all revolved around the question of whether the state's Lindsey Nicole Scholarship Program for Children with Disabilities, which was created to allow disabled children whose needs could not be adequately met by public schools attend private schools, could be used by children attending qualified schools with a religious affiliation. Two local school districts sued the parents of a special needs child for accepting the scholarship from the state in a lawsuit which was eventually dismissed by the Oklahoma Supreme Court. National groups then joined the school districts in suing the State Board of Education in a series of suits that again ended up before the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which ruled against the school districts, for the parents of the children with disabilities, and upheld the Scholarship Program. The attention and cost of these suits led a number of state legislators to question the Blaine amendment and introduce the ballot measure.  State Question 790  If the ballot measure passes, service organizations with religious affiliations would be allowed to compete on equal footing for state funds as long as that money was not used for proselytizing. The language that will appear on the ballot reads: \\"This measure would remove Article 2, Section 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution, which prohibits the government from using public money or property for the direct or indirect benefit of any religion or religious institution. Article 2, Section 5 has been interpreted by the Oklahoma court as requiring the removal of a Ten Commandments monument from the grounds of the State Capitol. If this measure repealing Article 2, Section 5 is passed, the government would still be required to comply with the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution, which is a similar constitutional provision that prevents the government from endorsing a religion or becoming overly involved with religion.\\"  Support and Opposition to Question 790  Question 790 was approved for consideration by a bi-partisan vote (39-5 in the Senate and 65-7 in the House). Neither political party and no statewide or national elected officials in Oklahoma have expressed their opposition to Question 790. National church-state separation groups have spoken out in opposition to Question 790 on the grounds that allowing religious groups to access state grants could tempt them away from their main mission. The ACLU has opposed Question 790 on the grounds that overturning it could allow the Ten Commandments monument to be returned to the grounds on the state Capitol. \\"They were designed to prohibit aid to parochial schools, especially those operated by the Catholic Church in locations with large immigrant populations.

Until the 1960s the area was used as a farm which is remembered in Old Farm Road and had a house known as Strawberry Vale House. The Strawberry Vale Brook ran through the area. By the 1970s the house had been demolished and Ordnance Survey maps show a riding school. At one time, Evan Evans, a horse breeder of international reputation, ran his business from there. Stable Walk, Brook Walk and Nursery Road on the modern estate all refer to the area's history. The estate was built in the 1980s and transferred to the Peabody Trust in 1998 under the Estate Renewal Challenge Fund Programme. It was the first estate to be acquired by Peabody under the programme. The estate is a mix of social housing and privately owned housing.Strawberry Vale estate. Peabody. Retrieved 3 October 2016. A three- year works programme began shortly after transfer and was completed in 2002. The properties are a mixture of general needs and owner leasehold.

Adjacent to the housing estate, bordering the North Circular Road, is the grade II* listed house Hawthorne Dene, built by James Frost in 1826 and known for its innovative construction methods. It was listed in 1962 following a campaign by the comedian Spike Milligan. The social reformer Octavia Hill spent part of her childhood in the 1850s at nearby Brownswell Cottages and a garden at the Green Man Community Centre is named the Octavia Hill Community Garden. British and Colonial Films had studios at Newstead House from 1911 until around 1916 where they produced films such as Robin Hood Outlawed and others in the Lieutenant Daring series.

Biosynthesis Transformation of estradiol to 2-hydroxyestradiol is a major metabolic pathway of estradiol in the liver. CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 are the major enzymes catalyzing the 2-hydroxylation of estradiol. Conversion of estradiol into 2-hydroxyestradiol has also been detected in the uterus, breast, kidney, brain, and pituitary gland, as well as the placenta, and may similarly be mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Although estradiol is extensively converted into 2-hydroxyestradiol, circulating levels of 2-hydroxyestradiol and levels of 2-hydroxyestradiol in various tissues are very low. This may be due to rapid conjugation (O-methylation, glucuronidation, sulfonation) of 2-hydroxyestradiol followed by urinary excretion. Biological activity =Estrogenic activity= 2-Hydroxyestradiol has approximately 7% and 11% of the affinity of estradiol at the estrogen receptors (ERs) ERŒ± and ERŒ≤, respectively. It dissociates from the estrogen receptors more rapidly than does estradiol. The steroid is only very weakly estrogenic, and is able to antagonize the estrogenic effects of estradiol, indicating that its intrinsic activity at the estrogen receptor is less than that of estradiol and hence that it possesses the profile of a selective estrogen receptor modulator. It shows estrogenic activity in human breast cancer cells. In addition to its activity at the nuclear ERs, 2-hydroxyestradiol is an antagonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) (100‚Äì1,000 ŒºM). =Catecholaminergic activity= 2-Hydroxyestradiol is a catechol estrogen and in this regard bears some structural resemblance to the catecholamines dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline). In accordance, 2-hydroxyestradiol has been found to interact with catecholamine systems. The steroid is known to compete with catecholamines for binding to catechol O-methyltransferase and tyrosine hydroxylase and to directly and competitively inhibit these enzymes. In addition, 2-hydroxyestradiol has been found to displace spiperone from the D2 receptor with approximately 50% of the affinity of dopamine, whereas estradiol, estrone, and estriol and their other 2-hydroxylated and 2-methoxylated derivatives showed only weak or negligible inhibition. Moreover, 2-hydroxyestradiol has been found to bind to the Œ±1-adrenergic receptor with slightly more than half the affinity of norepinephrine. However, although these affinities are comparable to those of dopamine and norepinephrine, they are nonetheless in the double-digit micromolar range. 2-Hydroxyestradiol has been found to increase prolactin secretion when administered intravenously to women. It was noted that this could be due to 2-hydroxyestradiol binding to and antagonizing the D2 receptor. However, the researchers argued against this possibility because it was delayed (by several hours) and of relatively small magnitude, whereas established D2 receptor antagonists promptly induce marked increases in prolactin levels. The researchers also argued against the possibility that it was due to inhibition of dopamine biosynthesis by 2-hydroxyestradiol because 2-hydroxyestrone, which inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase similarly to 2-hydroxyestradiol, showed no such increase in prolactin secretion. The researchers concluded that the most likely explanation was that the increase was mediated by the estrogenic activity of 2-hydroxyestradiol, as similar increments in prolactin levels had been observed with estradiol. In any case, these findings argue against the notion of major interactions of 2-hydroxyestradiol with the dopamine system. =Genotoxicity= 2-Hydroxyestradiol, as well as 2-hydroxyestrone and 4-hydroxyestradiol, can undergo metabolic redox cycling to generate free radicals like superoxide and reactive estrogen semiquinone/quinone intermediates. These metabolites may damage DNA and other cellular components. However, 2-hydroxyestradiol shows little or no tumorigenic activity in the male Syrian hamster kidney and there is evidence that 2-hydroxyestradiol may actually decrease tumorigenesis in estrogen-sensitive tissues. It has been suggested that the lack of tumorigenesis of 2-hydroxyestrone is due to its rapid clearance. In addition, its metabolite 2-methoxyestradiol is a very potent inhibitor of tumor growth and angiogenesis, and this may contribute as well. =Production of 2-methoxyestradiol= 2-Hydroxyestradiol has been identified as a prodrug of 2-methoxyestradiol, a transformation which is very efficiently catalyzed by catechol O-methyltransferase in the liver. 2-Methoxyestradiol is not estrogenic but is a potent angiogenesis inhibitor and agonist of the GPER with potential therapeutic implications in cancer. =Antioxidant activity= Similarly to other steroidal estrogens, 2-hydroxyestradiol is an antioxidant, but the catechol estrogens (2- and 4-hydroxylated estrogens) like 2-hydroxyestradiol are considered to be the most potent in terms of antioxidant activity. History 2-Hydroxyestradiol was identified as a metabolite of estradiol in 1960.

The event had a probable Volcanic Explosivity Index of 7, making it one of the largest volcanic eruptions during the current Holocene epoch. It created eruption columns reaching tens of kilometres into the atmosphere and pyroclastic flows that buried much of Lombok and crossed the sea to reach the neighbouring island of Sumbawa. The flows destroyed human habitations, including the city of Pamatan, which was the capital of a kingdom on Lombok. Ash from the eruption fell as far as away in Java; the volcano deposited more than of rocks and ash. The eruption was witnessed by people who recorded it on the Babad Lombok, a document written on palm leaves. It left behind a large caldera that contains Lake Segara Anak. Later volcanic activity created more volcanic centres in the caldera, including the Barujari cone, which remains active. The aerosols injected into the atmosphere reduced the solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface, cooling the atmosphere for several years and leading to famines and crop failures in Europe and elsewhere, although the exact scale of the temperature anomalies and their consequences is still debated. The eruption may have helped trigger the Little Ice Age, a centuries-long cold period during the last thousand years. Before the site of the eruption was known, an examination of ice cores around the world had found a large spike in sulfate deposition around 1257, providing strong evidence of a large volcanic eruption having occurred somewhere in the world. In 2013, scientists linked the historical records about Mount Samalas to these spikes. Geology =General geology= Samalas (also known as ) was part of what is now the Rinjani volcanic complex, on Lombok, in Indonesia. The remains of the volcano form the Segara Anak caldera, with Mount Rinjani at its eastern edge. Since the destruction of Samalas, two new volcanoes, Rombongan and Barujari, have formed in the caldera. Mount Rinjani has also been volcanically active, forming its own crater, Segara Muncar. Other volcanoes in the region include Agung, Batur, and Bratan, on the island of Bali to the west. Location of Lombok Lombok is one of the Lesser Sunda Islands in the Sunda Arc of Indonesia, a subduction zone where the Australian plate subducts beneath the Eurasian plate at a rate of . The magmas feeding Mount Samalas and Mount Rinjani are likely derived from peridotite rocks beneath Lombok, in the mantle wedge. Before the eruption, Mount Samalas may have been as tall as , based on reconstructions that extrapolate upwards from the surviving lower slopes; its current height is less than that of the neighbouring Mount Rinjani, which reaches . The oldest geological units on Lombok are from the Oligocene-Miocene, with old volcanic units cropping out in southern parts of the island. Samalas was built up by volcanic activity before 12,000 BP. Rinjani formed between 11,940 ¬± 40 and 2,550 ¬± 50 BP, with an eruption between 5,990 ¬± 50 and 2,550 ¬± 50 BP forming the Propok Pumice with a dense rock equivalent volume of . The Rinjani Pumice, with a volume of dense rock equivalent, may have been deposited by an eruption from either Rinjani or Samalas; it is dated to 2,550 ¬± 50 BP, at the end of the time range during which Rinjani formed. The deposits from this eruption reached thicknesses of at distance. Additional eruptions by either Rinjani or Samalas are dated 11,980 ¬± 40, 11,940 ¬± 40, and 6,250 ¬± 40 BP. Eruptive activity continued until about 500 years before 1257. Most volcanic activity now occurs at the Barujari volcano with eruptions in 1884, 1904, 1906, 1909, 1915, 1966, 1994, 2004, and 2009; Rombongan was active in 1944. Volcanic activity mostly consists of explosive eruptions and ash flows. The rocks of the Samalas volcano are mostly dacitic, with a content of 62‚Äì63 percent by weight. Volcanic rocks in the Banda arc are mostly calc-alkaline ranging from basalt over andesite to dacite. The crust beneath the volcano is about thick, and the lower extremity of the Wadati‚ÄìBenioff zone is about deep. =Eruption= The alt=A small cone rising above a greenish lake within a large crater on a mountain The events of the 1257 eruption have been reconstructed through geological analysis of the deposits it left. The eruption probably occurred during the northern summer in September (uncertainty of 2-3 months) that year, in light of the time it would have taken for its traces to reach the polar ice sheets and be recorded in ice cores and the pattern of tephra deposits. The eruption began with a phreatic (steam explosion powered) stage that deposited of ash over of northwest Lombok. A magmatic stage followed, and lithic-rich pumice rained down, the fallout reaching a thickness of both upwind on East Lombok and on Bali. This was followed by lapilli rock as well as ash fallout, and pyroclastic flows that were partially confined within the valleys on Samalas's western flank. Some ash deposits were eroded by the pyroclastic flows, which created furrow structures in the ash. Pyroclastic flows crossed of the Bali Sea, reaching the Gili Islands to the west of Samalas, while pumice blocks presumably covered the Alas Strait between Lombok and Sumbawa. The deposits show evidence of interaction of the lava with water, so this eruption phase was probably phreatomagmatic. It was followed by three pumice fallout episodes, with deposits over an area wider than was reached by any of the other eruption phases. These pumices fell up to to east, against the prevailing wind, in Sumbawa, where they are up to thick. The deposition of these pumices was followed by another stage of pyroclastic flow activity, probably caused by the collapse of the eruption column that generated the flows. At this time the eruption changed from an eruption-column-generating stage to a fountain-like stage and the caldera began to form. These pyroclastic flows were deflected by the topography of Lombok, filling valleys and moving around obstacles such as older volcanoes as they expanded across the island incinerating the island's vegetation. Interaction between these flows and the air triggered the formation of additional eruption clouds and secondary pyroclastic flows. Where the flows entered the sea north and east of Lombok, steam explosions created pumice cones on the beaches and additional secondary pyroclastic flows. Coral reefs were buried by the pyroclastic flows; some flows crossed the Alas Strait between Sumbawa and Lombok and formed deposits on Sumbawa. These pyroclastic flows reached volumes of on Lombok, and thicknesses of as far as from Samalas. The phases of the eruption are also known as P1 (phreatic and magmatic phase), P2 (phreatomagmatic with pyroclastic flows), P3 (Plinian) and P4 (pyroclastic flows). The duration of the P1 and P3 phases is not known individually, but the two phases combined (not including P2) lasted between 12 and 15 hours. The pyroclastic flows altered the geography of eastern Lombok, burying river valleys and extending the shoreline; a new river network developed on the volcanic deposits after the eruption. The eruption column reached a height of during the first stage (P1), and of during the third stage (P3); it was high enough that in it and its isotope ratio was influenced by photolysis at high altitudes. Volcanic rocks ejected by the eruption covered Bali and Lombok and parts of Sumbawa. Tephra in the form of layers of fine ash from the eruption fell as far away as Java, forming part of the Muntilan Tephra, which was found on the slopes of other volcanoes of Java, but could not be linked to eruptions in these volcanic systems. This tephra is now considered to be a product of the 1257 eruption and is thus also known as the Samalas Tephra. It reaches thicknesses of on Mount Merapi, on Mount Bromo, at Ijen and on Bali's Agung volcano. In Lake Logung away from Samalas on Java it is thick. Most of the tephra was deposited west-southwest of Samalas. Considering the thickness of Samalas Tephra found at Mount Merapi, the total volume may have reached . The dispersal index (the surface area covered by an ash or tephra fall) of the eruption reached during the first stage and during the third stage, implying that these were a Plinian eruption and an Ultraplinian eruption respectively. Pumice falls with a fine graining and creamy colour from the Samalas eruption have been used as a tephrochronological marker on Bali. Tephra from the volcano was found in ice cores as far as away from Samalas, and a tephra layer sampled at Dongdao island in the South China Sea has been tentatively linked to Samalas. Ash and aerosols might have impacted humans and corals at large distances from the eruption. There are several estimates of the volumes expelled during the various stages of the Samalas eruption. The first stage reached a volume of . The phreatomagmatic phase has been estimated to have had a volume of . The total dense rock equivalent volume of the whole eruption was at least . The magma erupted was trachydacitic and contained amphibole, apatite, clinopyroxene, iron sulfide, orthopyroxene, plagioclase, and titanomagnetite. It formed out of basaltic magma by fractional crystallization and had a temperature of about . Its eruption may have been triggered either by the entry of new magma into the magma chamber or the effects of gas bubble buoyancy. The eruption had a Volcanic Explosivity Index of 7, making it one of the largest eruptions of the current Holocene epoch. Eruptions of comparable intensity include the Kurile lake eruption (in Kamchatka, Russia) in the 7th millennium BC, the Mount Mazama (United States, Oregon) eruption in the 6th millennium BC, the Cerro Blanco (Argentina) eruption about 4,200 years ago, the Minoan eruption (in Santorini, Greece) between 1627 and 1600 BC, and the Tierra Blanca Joven eruption of Lake Ilopango (El Salvador) in the 6th century. Such large volcanic eruptions can result in catastrophic impacts on humans and widespread loss of life both close to the volcano and at greater distances. The eruption left the wide Segara Anak caldera where the Samalas mountain was before; within its high walls, a deep crater lake formed called Lake Segara Anak. The Barujari cone rises above the water of the lake and has erupted 15 times since 1847. A crater lake possibly already existed on Samalas before the eruption and supplied its phreatomagmatic phase with of water. Alternatively, the water could have come from aquifers. A collapse structure cuts into Rinjani's slopes facing the Samalas caldera. The eruption that formed the caldera was first recognized in 2003, and in 2004 a volume of was attributed to this eruption. Early research considered that the caldera- forming eruption occurred between 1210 and 1300. In 2013, Lavigne suggested that the eruption occurred between May and October 1257, resulting in the climate changes of 1258. Several villages on Lombok are constructed on the pyroclastic flow deposits from the 1257 event.  Research history  A major volcanic event in 1257‚Äì1258 was first discovered from data in ice cores; specifically increased sulfate concentrations were found in 1980 within the Cr√™te ice core (Greenland, drilled in 1974) associated with a deposit of rhyolitic ash. The 1257‚Äì1258 layer is the third largest sulfate signal at Cr√™te; at first a source in a volcano near Greenland had been considered but Icelandic records made no mention of eruptions around 1250 and it was found in 1988 that ice cores in Antarctica ‚Äì at Byrd Station and the South Pole ‚Äì also contained sulfate signals. Sulfate spikes were also found in ice cores from Ellesmere Island, Canada, and the Samalas sulfate spikes were used as stratigraphic markers for ice cores even before the volcano that caused them was known. The ice cores indicated a large sulfate spike, accompanied by tephra deposition, around 1257‚Äì1259, the largest in 7,000 years and twice the size of the spike due to the 1815 eruption of Tambora. In 2003, a dense rock equivalent volume of was estimated for this eruption, but it was also proposed that the eruption might have been somewhat smaller and richer in sulfur. The volcano responsible was thought to be located in the Ring of Fire but could not be identified at first; Tofua volcano in Tonga was proposed at first but dismissed, as the Tofua eruption was too small to generate the 1257 sulfate spikes. A volcanic eruption in 1256 at Harrat al-Rahat near Medina was also too small to trigger these events. Other proposals included several simultaneous eruptions. The diameter of the caldera left by the eruption was estimated to be , and the location was estimated to be close to the equator and probably north of it. While at first no clear-cut climate anomaly could be correlated to the 1257 sulfate layers, in 2000 climate phenomena were identified in medieval records of the northern hemisphere that are characteristic for volcanic eruptions. Earlier, climate alterations had been reported from studies of tree rings and climate reconstructions. The deposits showed that climate disturbances reported at that time were due to a volcanic event, the global spread indicating a tropical volcano as the cause. The suggestion that Samalas/Rinjani might be the source volcano was first raised in 2012, since the other candidate volcanoes ‚Äì El Chich√≥n and Quilotoa ‚Äì did not match the chemistry of the sulfur spikes. El Chichon, Quilotoa and Okataina were also inconsistent with the timespan and size of the eruption. The conclusive link between these events and an eruption of Samalas was made in 2013 on the basis of radiocarbon dating of trees on Lombok and the Babad Lombok, a series of writings in Old Javanese on palm leaves that described a catastrophic volcanic event on Lombok which occurred before 1300. These findings induced Franck Lavigne, a geoscientist of the Pantheon-Sorbonne University who had already suspected that a volcano on that island may be responsible, to conclude that the Samalas volcano was this volcano. The role of the Samalas eruption in the global climate events was confirmed by comparing the geochemistry of glass shards found in ice cores to that of the eruption deposits on Lombok. Later, geochemical similarities between tephra found in polar ice cores and eruption products of Samalas reinforced this localization.  Climate effects  =Aerosol and paleoclimate data= Ice cores in the northern and southern hemisphere display sulfate spikes associated with Samalas. The signal is the strongest in the southern hemisphere over the last 1000 years; one reconstruction even considers it the strongest of the last 2500 years. It is about eight times stronger than that of Krakatau. In the northern hemisphere it is only exceeded by the signal of the destructive 1783/1784 Laki eruption; The ice core sulfate spikes have been used as a time marker in chronostratigraphic studies. Ice cores from Illimani in Bolivia contain thallium and sulfate spikes from the eruption. For comparison, the 1991 eruption of Pinatubo ejected only about a tenth of the amount of sulfur erupted by Samalas. Sulfate deposition from the Samalas eruption has been noted at Svalbard, and the fallout of sulfuric acid from the volcano may have directly affected peatlands in northern Sweden. In addition, the sulfate aerosols may have extracted large amounts of the beryllium isotope from the stratosphere; such an extraction event and the subsequent deposition in ice cores may mimic changes in solar activity. The amount of sulfur dioxide released by the eruption has been estimated to be 158 ¬± 12 million tonnes. The mass release was greater than for the Tambora eruption; Samalas may have been more effective at injecting tephra into the stratosphere, and the Samalas magma may have had a higher sulfur content. After the eruption, it probably took weeks to months for the fallout to reach large distances from the volcano. When large scale volcanic eruptions inject aerosols into the atmosphere, they can form stratospheric veils. These reduce the amount of light reaching the surface and cause colder temperatures, which can lead to poor crop yields. Such sulfate aerosols in the case of the Samalas eruption may have remained at high concentrations for about three years according to findings in the Dome C ice core in Antarctica, although a smaller amount may have persisted for an additional time. Other records of the eruption's impact include decreased tree growth in Mongolia between 1258‚Äì1262 based on tree ring data, frost rings (tree rings damaged by frost during the growth season), light tree rings in Canada and northwestern Siberia from 1258 and 1259 respectively, thin tree rings in the Sierra Nevada, California, U.S. lake sediments recording a cooling episode in northeastern China, a very wet monsoon in Vietnam, droughts in many places in the Northern Hemisphere as well as in southern Thailand cave records, and a decade-long thinning of tree rings in Norway and Sweden. Cooling may have lasted for 4‚Äì5 years based on simulations and tree ring data. Another effect of the eruption-induced climate change may have been a brief decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. A decrease in the growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations was recorded after the 1992 Pinatubo eruption; several mechanisms for volcanically driven decreases in atmospheric concentration have been proposed, including colder oceans absorbing extra and releasing less of it, decreased respiration rates leading to carbon accumulation in the biosphere, and increased productivity of the biosphere due to increased scattered sunlight and the fertilization of oceans by volcanic ash. The Samalas signal is only inconsistently reported from tree ring climate information, and the temperature effects were likewise limited, probably because the large sulfate output altered the average size of particles and thus their radiative forcing. Climate modelling indicated that the Samalas eruption may have reduced global temperatures by approximately , a value largely not replicated by proxy data. Better modelling with a general circulation model that includes a detailed description of the aerosol indicated that the principal temperature anomaly occurred in 1258 and continued until 1261. Climate models tend to overestimate the climate impact of a volcanic eruption; one explanation is that climate models tend to assume that aerosol optical depth increases linearly with the quantity of erupted sulfur. The possible occurrence of an El Ni√±o before the eruption may have further reduced the cooling. The Samalas eruption, together with 14th century cooling, is thought to have set off a growth of ice caps and sea ice, and glaciers in Norway advanced. The advances of ice after the Samalas eruption may have strengthened and prolonged the climate effects. Later volcanic activity in 1269, 1278, and 1286 and the effects of sea ice on the North Atlantic would have further contributed to ice expansion. The glacier advances triggered by the Samalas eruption are documented on Baffin Island, where the advancing ice killed and then incorporated vegetation, conserving it. Likewise, a change in Arctic Canada from a warm climate phase to a colder one coincides with the Samalas eruption. =Simulated effects= According to 2003 reconstructions, summer cooling reached in the southern hemisphere and in the northern hemisphere. More recent proxy data indicate that a temperature drop of occurred in 1258 and of in 1259, but with differences between various geographical areas. For comparison, the radiative forcing of Pinatubo's 1991 eruption was about a seventh of that of the Samalas eruption. Sea surface temperatures too decreased by , triggering changes in the ocean circulations. Ocean temperature and salinity changes may have lasted for a decade. Precipitation and evaporation both decreased, evaporation reduced more than precipitation. Volcanic eruptions can also deliver bromine and chlorine into the stratosphere, where they contribute to the breakdown of ozone through their oxides chlorine monoxide and bromine monoxide. While most bromine and chlorine erupted would have been scavenged by the eruption column and thus would not have entered the stratosphere, the quantities that have been modelled for the Samalas halogen release (227 ¬± 18 million tonnes of chlorine and up to 1.3 ¬± 0.3 million tonnes of bromine) would have reduced stratospheric ozone. = Climate effects = Samalas, along with the Kuwae eruption in the 1450s and Tambora in 1815, was one of the strongest cooling events in the last millennium, even more so than at the peak of the Little Ice Age. After an early warm winter 1257‚Äì1258 resulting in the early flowering of violets according to reports from France, European summers were colder after the eruption, and winters were long and cold. The Samalas eruption came after the Medieval Climate Anomaly, a period early in the last millennium with unusually warm temperatures, and at a time when a period of climate stability was ending, with earlier eruptions in 1108, 1171, and 1230 already having upset global climate. Subsequent time periods displayed increased volcanic activity until the early 20th century. The time period 1250‚Äì1300 was heavily disturbed by volcanic activity, and is recorded by a moraine from a glacial advance on Disko Island, although the moraine may indicate a pre-Samalas cold spell. These volcanic disturbances along with positive feedback effects from increased ice may have started the Little Ice Age even without the need for changes in solar radiation, this theory is not without disagreement. The Little Ice Age was a period of several centuries during the last millennium during which global temperatures were depressed; the cooling was associated with volcanic eruptions. Other inferred effects of the eruption are: * The most negative Southern Annular Mode excursion of the last millennium. The Southern Annular Mode is a climatic phenomenon in the Southern Hemisphere that governs rainfall and temperatures there and is usually fairly insensitive towards external factors such as volcanic eruptions, greenhouse gases and the effects of insolation variations. * Onset of El Nino conditions during a climate period where La Nina was more common, as the eruption may have induced a moderate to strong El Nino event. Climate proxies such as a wet year in the American West endorse the occurrence of an El Nino event in the year after the Samalas eruption. * A short term decrease of the intensity of tropical cyclones caused by a change of the atmospheric temperature structure. Paleotempestology research in the Atlantic however suggests that the effect of the 13th century volcanic eruptions may have been to redistribute the occurrence of hurricanes rather than reducing their frequency. * A weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation which lasted long after the eruption, possibly aiding in the onset of the Little Ice Age as well. * A sea level drop in the Crusader states of about half a metre, perhaps associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Southern Oscillation. * A modification of the North Atlantic oscillation, causing it to acquire more negative values in the subsequent decades in co-operation with a beginning decrease in solar activity as part of the Wolf minimum in the solar cycle. * A stronger East Asian winter monsoon, leading to colder sea surface temperatures in the Okinawa Trough. * A brief but noticeable excitation in the climate pattern known as the \\"Pacific Meridional Mode\\". * Warmer winters in the Northern Hemisphere continents owing to changes in the polar vortex and the Arctic Oscillation. * Anomalies in Œ¥18O patterns around the world. * Changes in the terrestrial carbon cycle. Other regions such as Alaska were mostly unaffected. There is little evidence that tree growth was influenced by cold in what are currently the Western United States, where the eruption may have interrupted a prolonged drought period. The climate effect in Alaska may have been moderated by the nearby ocean. In 1259, western Europe and the west coastal North America had mild weather. Social and historical consequences The eruption led to global disaster in 1257‚Äì1258. Very large volcanic eruptions can cause significant human hardship, including famine, away from the volcano due to their effect on climate. The social effects are often reduced by the resilience of humans. =Lombok Kingdom and Bali (Indonesia)= Western and central Indonesia at the time were divided into competing kingdoms that often built temple complexes with inscriptions documenting historical events. However, little direct historical evidence of the consequences of the Samalas eruption exists. The Babad Lombok describe how villages on Lombok were destroyed during the mid-13th century by ash, gas and lava flows, and two additional documents known as the Babad Sembalun and Babad Suwung may also reference the eruption. They are also ‚Äì together with other texts ‚Äì the source of the name \\"Samalas\\" while the name \\"Suwung\\" - \\"quiet and without life\\" - may, in turn, be a reference to the aftermath of the eruption. The city of Pamatan, capital of a kingdom on Lombok, was destroyed, and both disappeared from the historical record. The royal family survived the disaster according to the Javanese text, and there is no clear cut evidence that the kingdom itself was destroyed by the eruption, as the history there is poorly known in general. Thousands of people died during the eruption although it is possible that the population of Lombok fled before the eruption. In Bali the number of inscriptions dropped off after the eruption, and Bali and Lombok may have been depopulated by it, possibly for generations, allowing King Kertanegara of Singhasari on Java to conquer Bali in 1284 with little resistance. The western coast of Sumbawa was depopulated and remains so to this day; presumably the local populace viewed the area devastated by the eruption as \\"forbidden\\" and this memory persisted until recent times. =Oceania and New Zealand= Historical events in Oceania are usually poorly dated, making it difficult to assess the timing and role of specific events, but there is evidence that between 1250 and 1300 there were crises in Oceania, for example at Easter Island, which may be linked with the beginning of the Little Ice Age and the Samalas eruption. Around 1300, settlements in many places of the Pacific relocated, perhaps because of a sea level drop that occurred after 1250, and the 1991 eruption of Pinatubo has been linked to small drops in sea level. Climate change triggered by the Samalas eruption and the beginning of the Little Ice Age may have led to people in Polynesia migrating southwestward in the 13th century. The first settlement of New Zealand most likely occurred 1230‚Äì1280 AD and the arrival of people there and on other islands in the region may reflect such a climate-induced migration. =Europe, Near East and Middle East= Contemporary chronicles in Europe mention unusual weather conditions in 1258. Reports from 1258 in France and England indicate a dry fog, giving the impression of a persistent cloud cover to contemporary observers. Medieval chronicles say that in 1258, the summer was cold and rainy, causing floods and bad harvests, with cold from February to June. Frost occurred in the summer 1259 according to Russian chronicles. In Europe and the Middle East, changes in atmospheric colours, storms, cold, and severe weather were reported in 1258‚Äì1259, with agricultural problems extending to North Africa. In Europe, excess rain, cold and high cloudiness damaged crops and caused famines followed by epidemics, although 1258‚Äì1259 did not lead to famines as bad as some other famines such as the Great Famine of 1315‚Äì17. In northwest Europe, the effects included crop failure, famine, and weather changes. A famine in London has been linked to this event; this food crisis was not extraordinary and there were issues with harvests already before the eruption. The famine occurred at a time of political crisis between King Henry III of England and the English magnates. Witnesses reported a death toll of 15,000 to 20,000 in London. A mass burial of famine victims was found in the 1990s in the centre of London. Matthew Paris of St. Albans described how until mid-August 1258, the weather alternated between cold and strong rain, causing high mortality. The resulting famine was severe enough that grain was imported from Germany and Holland. The price for cereal increased in Britain, France, and Italy. Outbreaks of disease occurred during this time in the Middle East and England. During and after the winter of 1258‚Äì59, exceptional weather was reported less commonly, but the winter of 1260‚Äì61 was very severe in Iceland, Italy, and elsewhere. The disruption caused by the eruption may have influenced the onset of the Mud√©jar revolt of 1264‚Äì1266 in Iberia. The Flagellant movement, which is first recorded in Italy in 1260, may have originated in the social distress caused by the effects of the eruption, though warfare and other causes probably played a more important role than natural events. Long term consequences in Europe and the Near East Over the long term, the cooling of the North Atlantic and sea ice expansion therein may have impacted the societies of Greenland and Iceland by restraining navigation and agriculture, perhaps allowing further climate shocks around 1425 to end the existence of the Norse settlement in Greenland. Another possible longer term consequence of the eruption was the Byzantine Empire's loss of control over western Anatolia, because of a shift in political power from Byzantine farmers to mostly Turkoman pastoralists in the area. Colder winters caused by the eruption would have impacted agriculture more severely than pastoralism. =Four Corners region, North America= The 1257 Samalas eruption took place during the Pueblo III Period in southwestern North America, during which the Mesa Verde region on the San Juan River was the site of the so-called cliff dwellings. Several sites were abandoned after the eruption, which had cooled the local climate. The Samalas eruption was one among several eruptions during this period which may have triggered climate stresses, which in turn caused strife within the society of the Ancestral Puebloans; possibly they left the northern Colorado Plateau as a consequence. =Altiplano, South America= In the Altiplano of South America, a cold and dry interval between 1200 and 1450 has been associated with the Samalas eruption and the 1280 eruption of Quilotoa volcano in Ecuador. The use of rain-fed agriculture increased in the area between the Salar de Uyuni and the Salar de Coipasa despite the climatic change, implying that the local population effectively coped with the effects of the eruption. =Northeast Asia= Problems were also recorded in China, Japan, and Korea. In Japan, the Azuma Kagami chronicle mentions that rice paddies and gardens were destroyed by the cold and wet weather, and the so-called Sh√¥ga famine may have been aggravated by bad weather in 1258 and 1259. Other effects of the eruption include a total darkening of the Moon in May 1258 during a lunar eclipse, a phenomenon also recorded from Europe; volcanic aerosols reduce the amount of sunlight scattered into Earth's shadow and thus the brightness of the eclipsed Moon. The effects of the eruption may also have hastened the decline of the Mongol Empire, although the volcanic event is unlikely to have been the sole cause.

History Although the region was inhabited prior to the Reconquista, it was sacked in 1235 by forces loyal to King D. Sancho II. The name Messejana has its origin in the Arab masjana, that refers to prison or jail, a word derived from the verb sajana (to mean to incarcerate in prison). Proof of Arab occupation comes from excavations at the castle (1992) of silver coins, dating to the Ibn Wazir period.Miguel Telles Antunes and Adel Sidarus (1998), p.288 During the reign of King D. Dinis (1279-1325) elevated the Messejana to the status of municipalityBorges and Marino (2003), p.71 donating the settlement to the knights of the Order of Santiago, as a way to establish a frontier in the region. The castle was constructed in 1288, under the direction of Pero Soudo. A foral (charter) was issued by King D. Manuel I (1495-1521) on 1 July 1512, but seemed inconsequential to national security.Daniel Alves (2007), p.1 King D. John II (1481-1495), who was sick at the time, stopped at the site between 8‚Äì9 October 1495, when he travelled to Caldas de Monchique. During the reign of King D. John III (1521-1557), the monarch donated the territory to D. Jo√£o da Silva, 6th Master of Vagos, also known as the Grande Regedor (Great Ruler).Daniel Alves (2007), p.2 His son, D. Louren√ßo da Silva, succeeded him and erected, between 1566 and 1570, a Franciscan Convent in the town, and what would become known as the Church of the Miseric√≥rdia. D. Loure√ßo, along with his five brothers, perished in the disastrous Battle of Alc√°cer Quibir (1578) along with D. Sebasti√£o (1568-1578), whose mother had invited the King to Messejana in 1573. During the context of the Portuguese Civil War (1828-1834), the Duke of Terceira was in Messejana with his military forces, where he met with his council of brigadiers on 17 July 1833. It was at this conference that the decision to take Lisbon, an operation that eventually succeeded, with the defeat of Miguelist/absolutist forces on 24 July 1833. The municipality was extinguished on 25 October 1835 by Rodrigo da Fonseca and over time its importance continued to deteriorate, subsumed by Aljustrel in the region. For various years the remains of the site was used as a quarry. Architecture The castle is located in an isolated, rural hilltop on the edge of the urban community. Near the site is the parochial church of Nossa Senhora dos Rem√©dios. The site is dominated by vestiges of a rectangular building, encircled by three lines of fortifications in an advanced state of ruin.

It is a ground orchid with a thin, hairy leaf and a thin wiry stem bearing one or two dark green or greenish red flowers with maroon or magenta markings. Description Caladenia atradenia is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb, sometimes solitary or in groups of up to ten individuals. It has an underground tuber and a single hairy, narrow linear leaf, long, wide and dark to reddish green. One, sometimes two flowers in diameter are borne on a thin, hairy, reddish- green, wiry spike, high. The flowers are dark to reddish-green, often with dark magenta markings. The dorsal sepal curves forward, forming a hood over the column. It is long, wide and a narrow egg-shape with a pointed tip. The lateral sepals are long, wide and are lance-shaped but curved. The petals are long, about wide and sickle-shaped. The labellum is white with purple bars, long, about wide when flattened, has three lobes and curves forward. The lateral lobes are about wide and erect. There are between four and eight pair of dark, purplish linear calli, decreasing in size towards the front along the sides of the labellum and two rows of white-stalked, dark headed calli on the mid-lobe. The column is long, erect and greenish with red marks and narrow wings. Flowering occurs between August and December and is followed by a hairy capsule long, wide and green with red stripes. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia atradenia was first formally described by David Jones, Brian Molloy and Mark Clements and the description was published in The Orchadian. The specific epithet (atradenia) is from the Latin word ater meaning \\"black\\" and the ancient Greek word aden meaning \\"gland\\" referring to the blackish labellum calli. Distribution and habitat Bronze fingers grows in poor soils, usually in thick leaf litter under shrubs in mixed conifer/broadleaved- hardwood forest but also on bare ground and in exotic pine plantations. It is found on both the North and South Islands of New Zealand. References atradenia Category:Plants described in 1997 Category:Orchids of New Zealand Category:Taxa named by David L.

He played an important part in the early creation and growth of the publishing firm which became , more recently the publishers of the Neue Deutsche Biographie, a biographical dictionary. Life =Family= Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Duncker was born in Berlin, his parents' only recorded child. His father, the merchant Christian Wilhelm Duncker (1749-1783), died while he was still an infant. Curiously, his father and grandfather had also both, similarly, lost their own fathers in infancy. His mother, Charlotte (born Charlotte Adolphie), remarried, which made it possible to preserve his father's business. In 1810 Duncker himself married Fanny Levi (1791‚Äì1869), a daughter of the banker and military supplier Wolff Levy (who confusingly changed his name to \\"Wolff Levy Delmar\\" in 1810 or 1812). Their children included the historian Maximilian Duncker (1811-1886), the Berlin mayor (1817-1893) and the publisher-politician Franz Duncker (1822-1888). The novelist Dora Duncker was a granddaughter. =Early years= Duncker was briefly a pupil at the prestigious K√∂llnisches Gymnasium (secondary school) in Berlin but his step father decided that a career in business would suit him better than an academic one, and he was switched to a commercial school recently established by and a Dr Schulze. After this he was set up in business in a small shop. However, the late eighteenth century was a period of growth in publishing and literature and Duncker found himself increasingly drawn into the world of books. In November 1800 he moved to Leipzig where he embarked on an apprenticeship in the book trade with Georg Vo√ü. On completion of his training period Vo√ü wrote that Duncker had applied himself to his work and to his learning \\"with demonstrable care and fidelity\\" (\\"mit der bewiesenen Treue und Aufmerksamkeit\\"). It becomes apparent that in Vo√ü he had acquired a lifelong friend and mentor. =In business= He returned to Berlin at the beginning of February 1806, accepting an invitation to take a job as an assistant to the book dealer and publisher Heinrich Fr√∂lich whose business, since its establishment in 1798, had thrived: Fr√∂lich had built up excellent literary and commercial connections. However, just six weeks after Duncker had joined him, on 11 March 1806 Fr√∂lich died suddenly, and Carl Duncker found himself running the firm. Duncker was confident that he would be able to sustain the business, but Fr√∂lich's widow was vehemently of the opinion that he was too young and inexperienced to do so. They called in the author and book dealer Friedrich Nicolai, a venerated elder of the Berlin book world, to arbitrate. Nicolai came down in support of Duncker who was left in post, to manage the business through what proved to be an exceptionally difficult couple of years for those seeking to live through commerce. Berlin was occupied by French troops between October 1806 and December 1808,Wolfgang Ribbe, J√ºrgen Schm√§deke: Kleine Berlin-Geschichte. Herausgegeben von der Landeszentrale f√ºr politische Bildungsarbeit Berlin in Verbindung mit der Historischen Kommission zu Berlin; Stapp Verlag, Berlin 1994, ; pp. 80‚Äì128: Reformzeit, Revolution und Reaktion (1800 bis 1860). Das Ende der friderizianischen Epoche: Berlin in der Phase des Umbruchs while intensified fighting persisted in Silesia and East Prussia, where the king had been obliged to move with his court and government following military defeat in 1806. International trade was also inhibited by the blockade of the Prussian ports imposed by the British navy in response to Emperor Napoleon's so-called Continental System. Despite all this, by 1808 Duncker had managed to clear all the debts of the firm, and the withdrawal of French troops from Berlin at the end of the year offered the possibility of slightly less troubled times ahead. Duncker now decided to purchase the business from Fr√∂lich's widow. In order to be able to do this he entered into a partnership with a business contact and entrepreneur called Peter Humblot whom he had been able to get to know better while they were serving together in the National Guard. Duncker and Humblot agreed to acquire the business on a 50:50 basis, and to share profits and losses on an equal basis. Duncker was able to fund his share of the purchase price with a loan from his step-father, in return for a mortgage. They traded under the business name \\"Duncker and Humblot\\". Peter Humblot died in 1828, leaving Duncker as the sole proprietor: but the name of the business remained unchanged. In broad terms, Duncker's strategy followed the path established by Heinrich Fr√∂lich, while displaying a keen sensitivity to evolving trends in taste and attitude. There was a focus on high quality academic and literary authors. History, at that time a subject of growing importance, was at the core of the business. He was endlessly attentive to the publication of Karl Friedrich Becker's nine volume \\"World History for Children and Teachers\\" (\\"Weltgeschichte f√ºr Kinder und Kinderlehrer\\"). Becker died in 1805, but the work was repeatedly expanded and updated by other historians, described later by his son as \\"excellently selected editors\\" (\\"vortrefflich gew√§hlte Bearbeiter\\"): by 1867 it had reached 20 volumes. Other authors who were published by Duncker & Humblot even in those early years included the poets/writers, Goethe, E. T. A. Hoffmann and de la Motte Fouqu√©. The historian Leopold von Ranke was persuaded to switch from his existing publisher to Duncker. From 1832 Duncker was also the publisher for all of Hegel's output. Between 1834 and 1845 the \\"Litterarische Zeitung\\" (\\"Literary Newspaper\\"), essentially the first national literary journal in Germany, was being produced by Duncker & Humblot, as were the \\"Yearbooks of Academic Criticism\\" (\\"Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr wissenschaftliche Kritik\\") between 1833 and 1842. =Beyond business= In 1924 he became a member of the executive committee of the German Exchange Association of Book Dealers (\\"B√∂rsenverein der Deutschen Buchh√§ndler\\"), retaining his membership till 1866. He was its (first) chairman between 1828 and 1831. He was also a Berlin city councillor for fifteen years. Death Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Duncker died peacefully, surrounded by his children, on 15 July 1869. In January 1866 he had transferred the Duncker & Humblot publishing business to the Leipzig publisher . Despite the relocation to Leipzig, the name of the company was unchanged, both under Geibel and under his son (also called Carl Geibel).

Early life Born into a liberal family of the lawyer Pasquale Ciccotti, a landowner and several times mayor of Potenza, he studied in the local high school. In 1879 he enrolled at the Law Faculty of the University of Naples. He became a follower of Mazzini and adhered to Italian irredentism. He had a particular interest in both ancient history and for the social problems of Southern Italy, inspired by the example of the historian Giustino Fortunato. Ciccotti, Ettore, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 25 (1981) Ciccotti, raised in the poor southern region of Basilicata, adhered to the group of socio-political thinker's known as meridionalisti (\\"southernists\\"), aspiring to solve the economic problems of Southern Italy after the Italian unification. They claimed that the economic policies of the central government of the new state discriminated against the interests of the south while favoring those of north. Academic and political activist In 1889, Ciccotti attended the University of Rome and gained a teaching qualification in classical antiquities. He won the competition for the ancient history chair at the Scientific-Literary Academy (Accademia scientifico-letteraria) in Milan in 1891. Meanwhile, he started to cooperate with the socialist Filippo Turati and his journal Critica Sociale. He adhered to the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), where he raised the issue of the underdevelopment of Southern Italy. His political involvement caused him the hostility of the Milanese conservatives, and in 1897 he lost his position at the Academy. He was appointed professor of ancient history at the University of Pavia, but his attacks on the government and solidarity for the workers on the occasion of the tragic events in Milan in May 1898 earned him an arrest warrant for subversive incitement. He went into exile, taking refuge in Geneva (Switzerland), hosted by Maffeo Pantaleoni. Here he met Vilfredo Pareto and the German social-democrat August Bebel, and wrote a report on the events in Milan, The revolt of Milan: Notes of a refugee, but lost his job at Pavia. As a historian, Ciccotti was the first to give a Marxist economic account of the decline of slavery in the Roman Empire, in contrast to religious-ethical explanations in his book Il tramonto della schiavitu nel mondo antico (The Sunset of Slavery in the Ancient World), published in 1899. Economic changes rendered slavery expensive and inefficient, and doomed it to extinction.Harrill, The Manumission of Slaves in Early Christianity, p. 48 Political career In June 1900, he was elected in the Italian Chamber of Deputies (1900-1904) Ciccotti, Ettore, Senato della Republica (accessed: 1 October 2016) in the Vicaria district of Naples, upsetting the traditional electoral alliance between local politicians and the Camorra.Snowden, Naples in the Time of Cholera, p. 254 In 1904, he lost his seat due to active campaigning of the Camorra against him.

Ettore Ciccotti, Camera dei deputati, Portale storico (accessed: 1 October 2016) Meanwhile, Ciccotti initiated the translation in Italian of the major works of the Socialist theorists Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and Ferdinand Lassalle. In the decade before the First World War, he gradually distanced himself more and more from the official line of the Socialist Party, although he kept on contributing to the socialist newspaper Avanti!. He criticized the party, which he considered to be too much focused on the problems of the \\"Northern\\", industrialist working man, and too little inclined to understand the problems of the impoverished rural populace of the South. Ciccotti defined the prejudices against southern Italians as the anti- Semitism of Italy.Huysseune, Modernity and Secession, p. 53 In contrast with the PSI, he was in favour of an Italian intervention in the First World War.Socialists Support War; Ciccotti Stirs Italian Chamber by Patriotic Speech, The New York Times, December 6, 1915 Senator and death His pro-war stance and dislike of the liberal Giovanni Giolitti ‚Äì Ciccotti called Giolittianism the \\"death of political life\\"De Grand, The Hunchback's Tailor, p. 162 ‚Äì, and in opposition to the post-war revolutionary movements, he looked sympathetically at the rising Fascism an its leader Benito Mussolini. \\"In today's evident scarcity of political personalities, Mussolini is the one that more than any other, if not the only one, can deserve this name,\\" Ciccotti wrote in September 1922.Falasca-Zamponi, Fascist Spectacle, p. 49 In September 1924, he was rewarded with a seat for life in the Italian Senate. He opposed the move to authoritarian rule of Mussolini,Senator Ettore Ciccotti; Noted Italian Historian, Long in Nation's Parliament, Dies, The New York Times, May 23, 1939 but did not resign. He mainly dedicated his time to study history. In 1931, when demanded to pledge an oath of allegiance to the Fascist regime, Ciccotti initially protested, but eventually took the oath all the same. Finally he opposed, and openly, to the dictatorship of Mussolini when he sensed that the regime was heading to the adventure of a war, which he considered the inevitable conclusion of authoritarian and populist regimes. He died in Rome on 20 May 1939 at the age of 76. References * De Grand, Alexander J. (2001).

It did not reach production. Design Around 1930 there was a French interest in small aircraft capable of evacuating a single ill or wounded patient to hospital from roughly prepared sites in the colonies. The Lorraine-Hanriot LH.21S and the Guillemin JG.40 were examples of the category and the Potez 42 was another. They posed several design challenges, principally around the need for a large, clear enclosure for the patient with easy ground access from a stretcher. The Potez 42 differed most obviously from the Hanriot and the Guillemin in having a low wing. This assisted take-off and landing performance, important for short, rough strip operation but required the patient's compartment to be well behind the centre of gravity for easy access, making trimming more difficult. The cantilever wing was in three parts, with a short () centre-section and long outer panels. Strongly straight tapered in plan, though with very little sweep on the leading edge, it had a high aspect ratio (8.2); the tips were semi-elliptical. High aspect ratio ailerons occupied about half the span. The wings were built around two spruce spars. The Potez 42's fuselage, like the wings built of wood, was constructed around a frame based on four longerons and was flat-sided apart from light, rounded upper decking. It was covered in plywood. The Salmson 9Ac nine-cylinder radial engine appears uncowled in photographs though early diagrams include a narrow chord Townend ring. Its pilot was in an open cockpit over the wing, with a port side door. His equipment included eight weighted messages, six droppable rockets and a pistol. The patient's compartment was behind the cockpit, under a one-piece, easily removable fairing which was provided with a forward window on each side and rear air vents. The patient was lowered into the aircraft on his stretcher which was guided by rails into four elastic supports. A strap secured him and there was an electrical heater. The fin had a cropped triangular profile and the tailplane was mounted well forward on it, just above the fuselage to which it was braced from below on each side with a single strut. Its balanced rudder was full, prominent and extended down to the keel and the inset, unbalanced elevators were on forward swept hinges so that the overall horizontal tail was strongly tapered in plan. The Potez 42 had fixed, tailwheel landing gear with a track of . Each mainwheel was on a bent axle and a drag strut, both hinged on the lower fuselage longeron and with a vertical, stacked rubber ring shock absorber strut of Potez design to the centre-section forward spar. The wheels had differential brakes for steering, aided by a small, elastically mounted castoring tailwheel. Development The Potez 42's first flights were made in the first week of August 1930. Potez's chief test pilot Labouchi√®re found its initial handling satisfactory. Like the Guillemin JG.40, it was on display at the 12th Paris Salon in December 1930. By late January 1931 the Potez 42 had already made several evaluation flights at Villacoublay. In July 1931 Les Amis de l'aviation sanitaire (Friends of Medical Aviation) organised a large meeting on the subject spread over several days, one of which was used for demonstration flights undertaken by nine different types of aircraft. The Potez 42, a Guillemin JG.40 and a Lorraine- Hanriot LH.21S formed the single patient group. By September it was back at Villacoublay, undergoing extensive static tests. The Potez 42 did not receive a government order so only one example was built. The small air-ambulance role was filled by the later and more powerful Bloch MB.81.

They moved again in 1899 to Jennings, Oklahoma Territory, before finally settling in Seattle in 1904. = Education = Griffiths attended public schools in Washington state, then attended the University of Washington. She served as an assistant to the Comptroller of the university during her undergraduate course. In 1921, she graduated with a bachelor's degree. In 1923 she earned a master's degree, also from the University of Washington, after writing Contact Curves of the Rational Cubic. The paper was published in typewritten arrangement by the University. She was elected as a member of the American Mathematical Society in September 1923, following which her master's thesis was published in the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society. In October 1925, she enrolled at the University of Chicago to pursue a doctorate in mathematics. She was supervised for the Ph.D course by well-known mathematician Leonard Dickson. Her thesis Certain quaternary quadratic forms and diophantine equations by generalized quaternion algebras earned her a doctorate degree in 1927.  Career  In 1927, after earning her doctorate, she was engaged as an instructor of mathematics at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where she spent the remainder of her career. In 1930, she was promoted to assistant professor of mathematics, and in 1938 she was named associate professor. She retired from Northwestern University in 1964 and was named professor emeritus. During her professional career she published many mathematics papers such as \\"Generalized Quaternion Algebras and the Theory of Numbers\\" and \\"Representation of Integers in the Form x2 \\\\+ 2y2 \\\\+ 3z2 \\\\+ 6w2\\", both in the American Journal of Mathematics. She also published \\"A generalization of the Fermat theorem on polygonal numbers\\" in the Annals of Mathematics, \\"Representation by Extended Polygonal Numbers and by Generalized Polygonal Numbers\\" and \\"Representation as Sums of Multiples of Generalized Polygonal Numbers\\". Griffiths also wrote reviews of mathematical texts such as Introduction to the Theory of Groups of Finite Order (1939) by Robert Daniel Carmichael, An Introduction to Abstract Algebra (1941) by Cyrus Colton MacDuffee, and A Survey of Modern Algebra (1942) by Garrett Birkhoff and Saunders Mac Lane. She also published notes on functions of polygonal numbers. She wrote a book on determinants and systems of linear equations, published as the textbook Introduction to the Theory of Equations by John Wiley and Sons in 1945. Following the book publication she wrote two additional papers, Outline of the theory of groups (1948) and Matrices and linear dependence (1949), which were never published.  Personal life and death  Her mother Lena lived with her in Evanston from 1945 until her mother's death in 1956. Lois Griffiths died on November 9, 1981 in Skokie, Illinois. Recognition Griffiths was honored in 1954 with life membership of the Northwestern University Alumni Association.

The systems generally comprised a simple four-team tournament, followed by the right of the top ranked team from the home-and-away season to challenge for the premiership. The systems were named after the Melbourne newspaper The Argus, which developed and supported their use. First Argus system In 1901, the Victorian Football League first adopted the \\"Argus system\\", after issues had emerged with the fairness of the system which had been introduced in 1898. The initial Argus system was, in effect, a simple four-team knock-out tournament, played as follows: * Week One: the First Semi-Final was played between 2nd vs 4th, and the Second Semi-Final was played between 1st vs 3rd. * Week Two: the final was played between Winner SF1 vs Winner SF2  The winner of this match became the Major Premier for the season. First amended Argus system The major complaint about the Argus system used in 1901 was that the four qualifying teams had a statistically equal chance to win the premiership. This particularly displeased Geelong, who had won the minor premiership, but were eliminated when beaten by Collingwood in the Second Semi-Final. To prevent this situation, the VFL re-introduced a provision which had existed under the 1898 system: after the simple knock-out tournament was completed, the team with the best win-loss record for the season would have the opportunity to challenge the winner of the knock-out tournament to a Grand Final for the premiership. This variant of the Argus system was played as follows: * Week One: the First Semi-Final was played between 2nd vs 4th, and the Second Semi- Final was played between 1st vs 3rd. * Week Two: a final was played between Winner SF1 vs Winner SF2 If the winner of the Week Two final had the best record in the league across all matches, including all finals up to and including Week Two, then that team became the Major Premier for the season. In these cases, the final in week two has retrospectively become known as the Grand Final. If the winner of the Week Two final did not have the best record in the league as defined above, then the finals progressed to Week Three. * Week Three: the Grand Final was played between Team with the best record vs Winner Final  The winner of this match became the Major Premier for the season. It is important to note that under this variant of the Argus System, the right to challenge did not automatically go to the minor premiers, i.e. the team which was ranked highest after the home-and-away season. If the minor premiership had been decided by a close margin, then any losses sustained during the finals could have cost the minor premier its right to challenge or even transferred it to another team. An example of how this could have happened occurred in the 1906 VFL season: leading into the Final, Carlton had an overall record of 15‚Äì3, and Fitzroy had an overall record of 14‚Äì4, but Fitzroy had a superior percentage to Carlton. Had Carlton lost the Final to Fitzroy, both teams would have had a record of 15‚Äì4, but Fitzroy would have been ranked above Carlton with its superior percentage, and Carlton therefore would have lost the right of challenge, meaning that Fitzroy would win the premiership. As it happened, Carlton won the Final, giving them a record of 16‚Äì3 compared with Fitzroy's 14‚Äì5, so Fitzroy had no right of challenge, and Carlton won the premiership. Many Carlton players and officials, including coach Jack Worrall, erroneously believed that they would have had the right to challenge had they lost the Final. This confusion led to Carlton lodging a complaint with the VFL, and the VFL made further amendments in 1907 to correct for this anomaly. Second amended Argus system The second version of the amended Argus system was used by the VFL between 1907 and 1930, except in 1924. This is the most widely known variation of the Argus system. The structure of the finals was mostly the same as the first amended Argus system, except that the right to challenge was given to the Minor Premier as defined by the team on top of the ladder at the end of the home-and-away season. Additionally, it became conventional for the two semi-finals to be played on separate weekends, extending the duration of the finals from two or three weeks to three or four weeks. * Week One: the First Semi-Final was played between 2nd vs 4th. * Week Two: the Second Semi-Final was played between 1st vs 3rd. * Week Three: a final was played between Winner SF1 vs Winner SF2 If Minor Premier won the Week Three final, then that team was immediately awarded the Major Premiership. In these cases, the final in week three has retrospectively become known as the Grand Final. If the winner of the Week Three final was not the Minor Premier, then the finals progress to Week Four. The final in week three became known as either the Final or the Preliminary Final. * Week Four: the Grand Final was played between Minor Premier vs Winner Final  The winner of this match became the Major Premier for the season. This variation of the Argus system was introduced into the VFA in 1903, four years before it was used in the VFL, being used by that competition until 1932, and was used in amateur football until 1956. Round-robin Argus system For the 1924 season only, the VFL trialled a new format, in which the finals were played as a four-team round-robin, but including the Minor Premiers' right to challenge. At the end of the home-and-away season, the top four teams qualified for the finals tournament. The finals were played over three weeks (with a provision for a fourth week), under the fixture: *Week one: 1st vs 3rd; 2nd vs 4th *Week two: 1st vs 2nd; 3rd vs 4th *Week three: 1st vs 4th; 2nd vs 3rd At the conclusion of the first three weeks, if the Minor Premier had finished on top of the round-robin ladder, then that team automatically won the Major Premiership, but if another team won the round- robin competition, then the finals progressed to Week Four. * Week Four: the Grand Final was played between Minor Premier vs 1st Round robin The winner of this match became the Major Premier for the season. In the sole VFL season that the system was used, no Grand Final was ultimately required. The scheme was developed as a result of demand for entry to finals matches in the early 1920s exceeding the capacity of the Melbourne Cricket Ground. It was thought that, by playing two games per weekend during the finals instead of one, more overall spectators would be able to attend the finals; and although this did occur, it did not translate to higher receipts, and the scheme was abandoned after one year. Criticisms After having utilised four variations of the Argus system for thirty years, three clear drawbacks had emerged: *Firstly, there was uncertainty regarding if there would be three or four finals played.Four finals were played in 1928 as the Second Semi-Final between Collingwood and Melbourne was drawn, meaning a replay was required. This had resulted, to some extent, in the crowd for at least one of the Semi-Finals or the Final exceeding that of the Grand Final in nine of the 29 seasons that the system was used, including seven of the eleven seasons between 1919‚Äì1923 and 1925‚Äì1930.Essendon won the round-robin series in 1924, meaning that no Grand Final was required. *Secondly, the minor premier was now seen to have an unfair advantage through its right to challenge to the point where losing the Second Semi-Final could be seen as a preferable route to a premiership: a loss allowed for a week off, while a win would require the minor premier to play on the following weekend. *Thirdly, there was a clear financial benefit to the clubs involved for a Challenge (or Grand) Final to be played, as it required another match to be played, bringing with it additional gate takings. As such, it was a common perception that clubs would contrive results to achieve this, leading to concern amongst the media, fans and officials that the Semi-Finals were not genuine contests. To correct for these flaws, the VFL introduced a new system in 1931, the Page‚ÄìMcIntyre system, that removed the minor premiers' right to challenge in favour of giving the minor premier and the second-placed team the advantage of a \\"double chance\\" that permitted either team to lose one match (excluding the Grand Final) without being eliminated, and fixed the number of finals at four. All leagues using the Argus system eventually migrated to the Page‚ÄìMcIntyre system, with amateur football being the last to do so in 1956.

The book challenges the belief that the simplified version of democracy used nowadays is good and moral. In his work, Brennan primarily suggests that voters tend to be irrational and ignorant about politics. He believes that there is little incentive for voters to inform themselves about politics, as they believe (correctly) that one vote will not make a great difference in the overall election results. Moreover, he states that voters tend to make decisions that are ideologically inclined and easily manipulated. Brennan presents and discusses different alternatives of \\"the rule of the knowledgeable\\" (epistocracy), where only the most knowledgeable voters get to elect our leaders. Reception Reviewing the book for The Volokh Conspiracy in The Washington Post, law professor Ilya Somin described it as an \\"important new book\\" whose \\"analysis of epistocratic alternatives to democracy is worth serious consideration ‚Äì even if most of these ideas are nowhere near ready for large-scale implementation\\".Ilya Somin, \\"Democracy vs. Epistocracy\\", September 3, 2016.

It is a potent estrogen similarly to estrone, and it has been suggested that the ratio of 16Œ±-hydroxyestrone to 2-hydroxyestrone, the latter being much less estrogenic in comparison and even antiestrogenic in the presence of more potent estrogens like estradiol, may be involved in the pathophysiology of breast cancer. Conversely, 16Œ±-hydroxyestrone may help to protect against osteoporosis. In terms of relative binding affinity (RBA) for the rat uterine estrogen receptor, 16Œ±-hydroxyestrone showed 2.8% of the affinity of estradiol. For comparison, estrone had 11% of the affinity and estriol had 10% of the affinity of estradiol. In contrast to other estrogens, the binding of 16Œ±-hydroxyestrone to the estrogen receptor is reported to be covalent and irreversible. 16Œ±-Hydroxyestrone has been reported to have 25% of the vaginal estrogenic potency of estradiol. The maximal uterotrophic and antigonadotropic effect of 16Œ±-hydroxyestrone was equivalent to those of estradiol and estriol, indicating that 16Œ±-hydroxyestrone is a fully effective estrogen. However, 16Œ±-hydroxyestrone was much less potent than estradiol or estrone. The C3 and C16Œ± diacetate ester of 16Œ±-hydroxyestrone, hydroxyestrone diacetate (brand names Colpoginon, Colpormon, Hormobion, and Hormocervix), has been marketed and used medically as an estrogen in Europe.

Biography  The brother of , bishop of Quimper, he studied in Lyon and soon moved to Paris where he was Secretary of count Stanislas de Clermont-Tonnerre. = French Revolution = Another of his brothers, a notary in Lyon, having been compromised by papers found in the king's apartments after the 10 August 1792, was decreed arrested by the National Convention on December 2 of that year. He first escaped the pursuit of his enemies; but having been taken after the revolt of Lyon against the National Convention, he was brought to the revolutionary committee established in this city, sentenced to death and executed in January 1794; he was 41 years old, and also born in Montluel. Andr√© emigrated in 1792, and having no other resources, he entered as a mere cavalier in the Arm√©e des √âmigr√©s, where he was known under the name M. de Montluel (from the name of the town where he was born), made the campaign of that year 1792, then in the Austrian regiment of the \\"Dragons de Latour\\", with which he made several campaigns. Returning to Paris in 1798, he was employed in various literary and political works by Talleyrand, the Foreign Minister, and participated in the writing of the Messager du Soir, where he had as collaborator, and to that of the Argus, an English newspaper which was printed in Paris, for which Bertrand Bar√®re de Vieuzac and Goldsmitz also worked, at the expense of the ministry. The author of M√©moires d'un homme d'√âtatTome VI, page 29. refers to him as one of the agents who, with MM. de Montrond and de Sainte-Foy, asked the envoys of America, from Talleyrand, a sum of money for a successful negotiation. Andr√© long worked in the composition of different circumstances brochures, which were published without the author's name, and sometimes even without a printer name. = French Empire = Appointed historiographer of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1808, he was charged in that capacity to publish various writings, which aimed to advocate the policy of Napoleon. It was about this time that he changed once again his name for d'Arbelles. = Bourbon Restauration = In 1814 he took a large part in the Bourbons First Restoration and for that, seconded of all his ways Talleyrand who had him receive the Legion d'honneur, and destined him to greater favors when Napoleon's return changed so many projects. Andr√© d'Arbelles refused to swear allegiance and lost his job; but immediately after the second return of Louis XVIII, he was appointed Prefect of Mayenne on 17 July 1815 and in August Master of Requests at the Conseil d'√âtat in extraordinary service. It was then that he openly took the title of \\"Marquis d'Arbelle\\" which he abandoned a little later. After the royal decree of September 5, 1815, so fatal to the royalist party, Andr√© d'Arbelles was dismissed from his prefecture in 1817 as too royalist. Reinstated in his prefectural office in January 1823, he was then called to the Prefecture de la Sarthe. It is in these functions that he died in Le Mans by accident of which Aim√© Marie Gaspard de Clermont-Tonnerre was unwittingly the cause. This minister having gone to Le Mans to conduct an inspection, the prefect hastened to meet him; but when he approached the ministerial cortege he was trampled by a runaway horse. He died a few hours after the accident, much regretted by the whole department he administered.

Ilminism (;), frequently translated as the One-People Principle, was the political ideology of South Korea under its first President, Syngman Rhee. The Ilmin principle has been likened by contemporary scholars to the Nazi idea of the Herrenvolk (master race), and was part of an effort to consolidate a united and obedient citizenry around Rhee's strong central leadership through appeals to nationalism and ethnic supremacy. The concept of the One-People Principle was developed primarily by Minister of Education An Ho-sang, who studied philosophy at the University of Jena in Germany during the late 1920s. Ideology The One-People Principle has been likened to the German ideology of the herrenvolk (master race), constituting an effort to build a loyal and obedient citizenry through ethnic homogeneity and brazen appeals to nationalism.Su-kyoung Hwang, Korea's Grievous War. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2016; pg. 93. The idea for a Korean adaptation of this Germanic idea emerged from the works of philosopher An Ho-sang, the Minister of Education under Syngman Rhee, who studied at the University of Jena in Germany during the late 1920s.Vladimir Tikhonov and Pak Noja, \\"Social Darwinism as History and Reality: 'Competition' and 'The Weak' in Early Twentieth-Century Korea,\\" Critical Asian Studies, vol. 48, no. 3 (2016). The ideology also emphasized an importance on Confucianism and Confucian principles. The Ilmin Principle became the central ideology of Rhee's National Society and its successor, the Liberal Party, established in 1951. The One- People Principle was based around a four-point political program, including elimination of formal discrimination between the nobility and the masses, the economic equalization of rich and poor through land reform, social and political equality of the sexes, and an end to discrimination between North and South or the urban capital and the rural provinces. An end to partisan politics was posited, in favor of a united people behind a de facto one-party state. The egalitarian theoretical underpinnings of the One-People Principle, heralding a classless society of gender equality under firm central leadership, proved to be utopian, with Rhee emerging in practice as head of a fascist dynasty on the Japanese model, remade with Rhee in the role of an emperor. Ilminism was effective in creating a strong anti-Communist nationalism to stand in juxtaposition to the effective appeals to nationalism made through the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, headed by Kim Il Sung and the communist Workers' Party of Korea.Hwang, Korea's Grievous War, pg. 94.

It has thick, rough scaly bark on the trunk and larger branches, lance-shaped or curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, nine or eleven, creamy white to pale yellow flowers and barrel-shaped, urn- shaped or spherical fruit. Description Corymbia bloxsomei is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has soft, rough, scaly or tessellated yellowish to brownish bark on the trunk and almost to the smaller branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves that are paler on the lower surface, egg-shaped to elliptical, long and wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped or curved, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with seven, nine or eleven buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to cylindrical, about long and wide with a variably-shaped operculum. Flowering has been recorded in June and December and the flowers are creamy white to pale yellow. The fruit is a woody barrel-shaped, urn-shaped or spherical capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit. Taxonomy and naming Yellowjacket was first formally described in 1925 by Joseph Maiden in the Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales and given the name Eucalyptus bloxsomei.

The area supports many rare species of amphibians, birds, lemurs and reptiles; many of which are endemic. In 2001, the site was designated as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International and in 2015, an area of 600 km¬≤ received environmental protection by the government. The reserve is the recipient of monies raised by the 2016 Rutland Birdfair. Geography The forest is in the south of the island of Madagascar, within the Tsitongambarika massif, which consists of a series of ridges aligned from south-west to north-east. On the western boundary the Manampanihy river flows northwards. The nearest town is T√¥lanaro, 9 km to the south. Tsitongambarika is the only area in the south of the country that still has significant areas of lowland forest but, due to illegal logging and shifting cultivation, deforestation rates are amongst the highest in the country. An area farmed under shifting cultivation is cleared and, for a few years cultivated, than abandoned and lies fallow while fertility returns. Local people are also affected, as they depend on the forest for firewood and charcoal, and are often portrayed as the villains of tropical deforestation. As long as their needs are considered, and as long as they particate in decisions and benefit from management, they can be the best conservationists. The forest forms the water catchment of rivers and steams that are of importance for the cultivation of rice on the coastal plain. The area was assessed by BirdLife International to be an Important Bird Area in 2001 and since 2005, Asity Madagascar have been working with local communities to manage the area. An area of received government protection in 2015. Despite legal protection Birdlife International considers the forest to be an 'IBA in Danger'. Flora and fauna Much of the wildlife is endemic to Madagascar and many of the amphibians and reptiles are likely to be new to science. Botanical collecting in the 2000s found at least seventy new species. The reserve supports areas of intact low- and mid-altitude, dense, humid evergreen forest, and sclerophyllous montane forest. At low altitudes the canopy is at 15 m to 25 m and dominated by Dracaena, Ilex, Oncostemum, Sorindeia, Syzygium and Tambourissa. At mid-altitudes the canopy is 12 m to 20 m high with trees of Macaranga and Oncostemon, as well as species of Guttiferae, Monimiaceae, Moraceae and Myrtaceae. The forest on Mount Ivohibe (677m) (more than one on the island with the same name) is an isolated peak with relatively undisturbed forest. An expedition, organised by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in 2010 recorded twenty species of palms making it one of the richest sites, for palms, in the southern part of the island. Sixteen species are either a rare or threatened species according to IUCN redlist data. Expedition members considered the forest on Ivohibe to be a 'site of major palm significance'. The brown mesite (Mesitornis unicolor) is a ground-dwelling bird of undisturbed primary, evergreen, humid forest and its population is thought to be declining rapidly. It is listed as vulnerable due its habitat along the eastern seaboard of Madagascar being fragmented. Other key species include Madagascar blue-pigeon (Alectroenas madagascariensis), Madagascar wood-rail (Mentocrex kioloides), nelicourvi weaver (Ploceus nelicourvi), nuthatch vanga (Hypositta corallirostris), red-fronted coua (Coua reynaudii), scaly ground- roller (Geobiastes squamiger), spectacled tetraka (Bernieria zosterop) and white-throated oxylabes (Oxylabes madagascariensis).

There he competed in three events, winning a silver in the 200 metres and became the first Namibian athlete to win an IPC World Athletics gold when he broke the championship record to take 400 metres title. In the buildup to the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Nambala took part in the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships in Doha. He took another two World Championship medals, a bronze in the 400 metres, despite posting a faster time than won him the title two years prior, and a gold in the 200 metres. He followed the World Championships with his first African Games, competing in the 400 metres. His time of 48.49 was enough to beat his nearest rival, Algeria's Abdelatif Baka, to claim the gold medal. The next year, at the Rio Paralympics, Nambala entered three events, the 100 metre (T13), the 200 metre (T13) and the 4 x 100 metre relay (T11-13) He won two medals, placing second in both the T13 100m sprint and the T13 400m sprint.

The railway is located in the northern part of the Pomeranian Voivodeship. The line is single-track and non- electrified. Opening This is the only standard gauge railway line built on the spit. The line was created in stages from 1879 to 1928. Construction of the final stretch of the line started in 1922 was opened in 1928. Part of the line at the port of Hel was later demolished. Closure In Swarzewo was the only railway junction on the route (other than the one at Reda where the line begins) with the Swarzewo‚ÄìKrokowa railway which closed in 1991. For the third time rail traffic from Puck to Krokowa it was suspended in the late 80s and early 90s in May 1989 on this route ceased to run passenger trains, and in 1991 also marks In March 2001, thanks to the intervention and funding the local government of Pomerania line was saved from closure. Modernisation On 26 September 1993 the last scheduled steam passenger train operated along the line. In 1998 the line was modernised. Stations have been equipped with a remotely controlled traffic centre from Gdynia, so that the presence of service stations along the route (in addition to the ticket offices) became redundant. In 2005, to support local connections between Gdynia and Hel began to be use railcars and diesel multiple units manufactured by PESA SA. In 2006, these vehicles took over all the services on the line. In the summer season due to the increasing number of travellers, locomotive hauled trains are also used. On 5 October 2011 an agreement with Salcef Costruzioni edili E Ferroviaria for the revitalization of the entire line No. 213 was signed. Modernisation of the line included improving the track, the platforms and renovating buildings. The speed was increased to 100 km/h with the exception of the Puck-Wladyslawowo section, where the speed is 90 km/h. This was to shorten the travel time by 15‚Äì25 minutes. Renovation began in spring of 2012 and resulted in the temporary closure of the line until 10 September 2012. Due to increased transportation during the holiday season, train traffic was reinstated during the summer of 2013. In the period from 2 September 2013 to 14 June 2014 traffic on the line was again suspended. The next closure took place on between 15 and 19 November 2014. On 4 to 11 May 2015 traffic on the route W≈Çadys≈Çawowo - Hel was again stopped. Modernisation was finally completed in July 2015. With the execution of the planned works travel time between Reda and Hel has been shortened by 17 minutes. Usage Due to the number of tourists to the area the line has high variations through the seasons, therefore two timetables exist for the line depending on the season. The line is used year-round by regional services between Gdynia, Reda and Hel. Long-distance trains only operate during the summer holidays due to the influx of tourists to the Hel Peninsula. Then, this route runs several pairs of express trains from other parts of Poland. These trains are hauled by diesel locomotives from Gdynia. There is little freight traffic along the line due to a lack in industry.

Description Iberina montana is a small spider with a body length of 1.4‚Äì2 mm. The palps on the male have 3 black bristles on the outer side of femur which break off easily, although the base is always still visible. The vulva has a small, median spermatheca with the distance between the primary spermathecae smaller than their width. The prosoma is yellowish, suffused with black, while the opisthosoma is dark with vague chevrons. Its body is quite densely covered with long pale hairs. The legs are yellow-brown with relatively strong spines. Biology Female Iberina montana are mature throughout the year, but the mature males are found only from late summer through autumn and winter, but mainly during the autumn. Its small sheet web is placed close to the ground among the mosses or under stones, or in leaf litter, including fallen pine needles, and among moss and other detritus, normally in woodlands. Habitat Iberina montana is mainly found in woodland but it is occasionally recorded from other habitats such as grassland, heathland, fen, sand dunes and coastal shingle. Distribution Iberina montana is found mainly in western and central Europe east to Russia but not as far as the Ural Mountains or the Caucasus. In a survey in the Eifel mountains of the Rhineland, this was the commonest hahnid spider encountered. Despite being so far unrecorded in European Turkey or adjacent parts of the Balkans, it has been recorded in Anatolia.

The book explores the retail sector, examining how the lives of workers in the industry can be transformed. She first examines the nature of retail work, and then looks to the successes and promise of retail unions in changing workers' lives and situations. Coulter then considers retail more broadly, examining a range of possible avenues for political change. Amanda Pyman, who reviewed the book for Times Higher Education, said that it was \\"Essential reading for all employment relations scholars ... Coulter should be commended for this valuable contribution to what is still, despite the prominence of retail in global economies, an understudied sector.

In her second monograph, 2016's Animals, Work, & the Promise of Interspecies Solidarity, Coulter examines the work people do with animals as well as the work done by animals, drawing upon a range of theoretical perspectives including feminist political economy. In both labour studies and human-animal studies, Coulter argues, the work done by and for animals has been underexplored. Coulter not only explores these topics, arguing that animals' work should be recognised as such, but critically engages with them, offering alternative ways to conceptualise the place of animals in the workplace and society, with a focus on improving lives and alleviating suffering.

The Bakers were one of the most popular teams of the Amateur Athletic Union, rising to fame in 1957 when the beat the Phillips 66ers in the AAU Tournament final. The team was sponsored by the Buchan Baking company, thus they adopted their name. During the 1955-56 season, the Buchan Bakers traveled to Asia, playing teams from Japan, China and they were the first AAU basketball team to play against Eastern European teams during the Cold War. The Buchan Bakers were active for 13 seasons winning the National AAU Championship, the Northwest AAU title six times, representing the United States in trips to Asia, Europe and behind the Iron Curtain. In addition, the Bakers, with their three years in the National Industrial Basketball League, had been Seattle'¬ís first national sports franchise. History =Early years in AAU= The Buchan Bakers were founded in 1948, when Warren Bud Howard convinced George Buchan and his Buchan Baking Company to sponsor his basketball team in the Northwest AAU League. The three first season until 1951 were not successful and, coach Howard decided to recruit higher-quality players with college experience for the 1951-52 season. The Buchan Bakers that year were led by 6-foot, 8-inch center Rod Gibbs from College of Puget Sound and 5-foot, 7-inch guard Dar Gilchrist from Long Island University. Other members of the team included Jack Ward and Louis Soriano, both from the University of Washington. The Bakers breezed through Northwest League competition and went to the National AAU Tournament in Denver for the first time. Although they lost in the first round, for the Buchan Bakers the season had been a success. In the 1952-1953 next season, the University of Washington basketball team, led by All-American center Bob Houbregs, made it to the NCAA Final Four, and Howard began recruiting all five Husky starters. Houbregs agreed to play for the Bakers, and both he and his father, were given jobs at the bakery. But shortly after Houbregs received his first paycheck, he signed a contract with the Milwaukee Hawks of the NBA. Howard did manage to sign up his supporting cast from the UW ¬ñ Charlie Koon, Joe Cipriano, Mike McCutcheon and Doug McClary, and he enlisted Bill Morris, the UW freshmen coach, to take over coaching. Howard became business manager of the team. In the 1953-54 season, the Buchan Bakers unveiled their new team of former UW players, along with Chet Noe, a 6-foot, 7-inch center from the University of Oregon. The Bakers won the Northwest League crown, and although once again they traveled to Denver for the National AAU Tournament, once again they were defeated in the first round.http://www.buchanbakers.com/index.html In 1954, Morris returned to the UW, and former high school coach Frank Fidler was hired to coach the Buchan Bakers. Although the Bakers lost center Chet Noe to the Ada Oilers, the team was strengthened by the additions of Hartley Kruger, a 6-foot, 8-inch center from the University of Idaho, and forward Ed Tucker, a former Stanford star, who was taking pre-med classes at the University of Washington. Unfortunately, the two newcomers weren¬ít always available to play ¬ñ Kruger had work obligations and Tucker had military obligations‚Äîand the team was not able to develop the consistency to win the National AAU Tournament. The Bakers won their opening round game, but fell to the Peoria Caterpillars in the second round, 81-79 in overtime. =1955: The success comes= For their championship run in 1955-56, the Buchan Bakers brought in several key players, including Phil Jordon, a 6-foot, 10-inch center, who would play in the NBA for several years, and George Swyers, the NAIA¬ís leading scorer from West Virginia Tech. Dean Parsons, a 6-foot, 8-inch power forward from Washington and Stan Glowaski, a 6-foot, 5-inch guard from Seattle U also joined the Bakers full- time after playing with the team in the AAU tournament the year before But the Bakers¬í season was almost derailed by a new team to the Northwest AAU League which featured Elgin Baylor, a Seattle University recruit sitting out the season to gain eligibility. Baylor's team beat the Bakers twice and the two teams finished the regular season in a tie for first. A wild playoff game to determine the league championship resulted in a victory for the Buchan Bakers. For the National AAU Tournament, the Bakers added Bruno Boin, a 6-foot, 9-inch sophomore center from the University of Washington. The Bakers defeated Denver Central Insurance and the Pasadena Mirror-Glazers to get into the semifinals against Milwaukee Allen-Bradley. The Allen-Bradley team featured 6-foot, 10-inch Terry Rand, an All-American from Marquette, but it was Bruno Boin who was the difference, sinking Milwaukee with deadly long-range hook shots. That set up the championship game with Phillips 66ers, the defending champion, against the unheralded Buchan Bakers. Phillips came out strong, building a 10-2 lead, but after the Bakers closed the gap, the game remained close throughout. The game featured rough play and cold shooting, and neither team led by more than three points the rest of the way. With two-and-one-half minutes left, the score was tied 57-57 and Buchan's coach Frank Fidler decided to hold on for the last shot. With 29 seconds left, Fidler called time out and set up a play for George Swyers to take the last shot. The play went exactly as planned until the ball got to Swyers, who found himself tightly guarded by Burdette Haldorson. Swyers had to twist around the 6-foot, 8-inch defender, and throw up an awkward runner as the horn went off. Incredibly, the ball went through the net and the Buchan Bakers were National AAU Champions. Swyers and Charlie Koon were named to the all-tournament team. =Worldwide tour= During the 1955-56 season, the Buchan Bakers traveled to Asia, playing teams from Japan, China and the Philippines. After the season, the Bakers traveled to Europe and were the first AAU basketball team to play behind the Iron Curtain. The team played in Poland and Czechoslovakia, in addition to France, Spain, and Italy. But the team¬ís hopes of traveling to Australia to play in the Olympic Games were swatted away by Bill Russell. As winners of the National AAU Tournament, the Bakers were invited to a four-team round robin tournament to determine the U.S. Olympic Team. The Bakers lost to the Russell- led College All-Stars and dropped a rematch with Phillips 66ers. Although the Bakers beat the Armed Forces All-Stars, the Bakers were shut out of the Olympic selections. After winning the national championship, many of the key players chose not to return for the 1956-57 season. Phil Jordon joined the NBA, George Swyers returned home and joined the nearby Akron Goodyear team, Stan Glowaski was called up for military duty, Joe Cipriano started his basketball coaching career, and Bruno Boin returned to the UW. Charlie Koon and Dean Parsons were the key returnees. After seeing how well Elgin Baylor played, Howard recruited Baylor's teammate from the College of Idaho, R. C. Owens. Owens, although only 6-foot, 3-inches tall, was a strong rebounder with incredible leaping ability. The Buchan Bakers won the Northwest AAU League easily, and advanced in the National AAU Tournament to the semifinals before losing to the Air Force All-Stars, the eventual champions. R.C. Owens was named to the all-tournament team, but after the season ended he decided to give professional football a try. He became a wide receiver for the San Francisco 49ers. The 1957-58 season was the last for the Buchan Bakers in the Northwest AAU League, and once again they finished in first place. The veteran Charlie Koon was joined by his championship season teammate Bruno Boin, who took a year off from playing at the University of Washington. Other standouts on the team included Dick Stricklin, a 6-foot, 7-inch forward from Seattle University, who averaged 13.3 points a game; Larry Beck, a 6-foot, 4-inch forward from Washington State, and Carl Boldt, a 6-foot, 5-inch forward from the University of San Francisco. Boldt had played on the USF team with Bill Russell that had won the NCAA championship in 1956. The Bakers fell to the Phillips 66ers in the quarterfinals of the National AAU tournament, 71-61. =1958-1961: NIBL= Finally for the 1958-59 season, when the team was accepted into the National Industrial Basketball League. The league featured the Akron Goodyear Wingfoots, the Phillips 66ers, the Denver D-C Truckers, the Peoria Caterpillars and the Wichita Vickers ¬ñ teams that the Bakers had played regularly in the past several years. The Bakers retained their Pacific Northwest identity with returnees, Charlie Koon and Larry Ramm from Washington, Dick Stricklin from Seattle U, and Larry Beck from Washington State. Carl Boldt from University of San Francisco returned, and Howard recruited two of Boldt's teammates from USF ¬ñ guard Gene Brown and center Art Day. Also from the Bay Area, guard Carroll Williams joined the team from San Jose State. The Bakers went 10-20 during their first year, finishing in last place. They were eliminated from the National AAU Tournament by the Marines All-Stars 63-62. The rigors of a national schedule proved too much for the two remaining participants in the 1956 National AAU Championship run. Coach Frank Fidler and veteran guard Charlie Koon, citing time away from home and work, left the Buchan Bakers after the 1958-59 season. To replace Fidler, Bud Howard hired Gene Johnson, a long-time AAU coach who had guided the McPherson Globe Oilers to the National AAU Championship in 1936 and then had coached the gold medal-winning U.S. Olympic Team that year. Howard and Johnson began looking outside the West Coast for talent, and what they gained in player ability they lost in local fan support. The Bakers did obtain the services of Bruno Boin, who had graduated from the UW, and Charlie Brown, who had played with Elgin Baylor at Seattle U. for one year and had starred in his own right the following year. But most of the new players were from the South where Johnson had coached before coming to Buchan¬ís. The 1959-60 Bakers managed to improve to a 14-18 record, good enough for seventh in the nine-team NIBL. However, the team caught fire in time for the National AAU Tournament, helped by the pick up of Dave Mills, a strong rebounder and scorer from Seattle University. The Bakers lost their semifinal game to Akron Goodyear, but came back to win the next night for a third-place finish. =1961: End of an era= The next year, there were no players from local colleges and interest in the team dwindled. The NIBL had shrunk to six teams, and the Bakers finished 10-24, which gave them a third-place finish in the three-team Western Division of the NIBL. The Buchan Bakers played their last game March 23, 1961, losing to the Denver D-C Truckers, 107-81, in the quarterfinals of the National AAU Tournament. The National Industrial Basketball League folded after the season and two of its members, the Cleveland Pipers and the New York Tuck Tapers, moved into the newly formed American Basketball League. George Buchan had also decided not to continue the team in the face of changes in both basketball and the bakery business.

Production and release The film reproduces a magic act M√©li√®s performed at his Paris theater-of-illusions, the Th√©√¢tre Robert-Houdin. Conjuring is notable as M√©li√®s's second film, and as his first to move beyond the actuality film genre pioneered by the Lumi√®re brothers and experiment with using the camera to capture a theatrical magic act. (Later in 1896, with his discovery of the substitution splice technique, M√©li√®s was able to begin augmenting his theatrical illusions with new special effects unique to film.) Conjuring can thus be seen as M√©li√®s's first foray into the world of fiction film. The film was released by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and numbered 2 in its catalogues. Rediscovery A frame from the rotoscoped version In 2014, the Cin√©math√®que fran√ßaise received a donation from the collector Fran√ßois Bin√©truy: a short fragment of chromolithographed animated film, rotoscoped from an unidentified 1896 M√©li√®s film and showing M√©li√®s himself performing a conjuring trick. Such fragments of animation had been manufactured from 1897 onward in Germany and France, for home use in toy projectors. In 2015, the Cin√©math√®que uncovered another fragmentary home-projector version of the same film, this time reproducing the original black-and-white live-action frames. In July 2015, the film scholar Jacques Malth√™te identified the film as Georges M√©li√®s's Conjuring.

Crimiso)Gogo Terme.com - Terme libere di Segesta - Polle del Crimiso are hydrothermal springs located in Sicily, between Alcamo and Castellammare del Golfo, in the province of Trapani.  History  = Mythology = The first Greeks living in western Sicily related the phenomenon of the formation of hot waters to a mythological event, according to which the heat of the river waters had been emitted thanks to a fluvial god's will, Crimiso, to let heat the nymph Egesta, escaped from Troy, get worm as she was unconscious on the river bank, and that later became his wife. They had a son, Acestes, who founded Segesta and gave her mother's name to it.Ignazio Concordia: la Sicilia tra Mito e Storia p.52-55, ed. The historian Diodorus Siculus tells about Heracles‚Äô trip: while he was going to Erice he met the Egestee nymphs who, in order to help him to recover from fatigue, made Egestan (or Segestan)Giovanni Virz√¨, \\"Le polle del Crimiso\\" hot water springs appear on the surface. Dionysius of Halicarnassus speaks about the Segestan thermal baths and tells that Eneas, after arriving in Sicily, left near Egesta his older mates who were tired for the trip, to repopulate it again and, by using these waters, have some benefits for their bodies.Tourist Eye - Terme Segestane So this myth connects also to the foundation of Segesta made by Trojans who chose it for the beneficial properties of the hot water in its territory. As regards the river position, all the historical sources referring this myth agree on the fact that Crimiso is located in the Segestan area, and so it should be the present river San Bartolomeo (made up by the confluence of the river Caldo and the river Freddo), at whose mouth Segesta had its harbour. = Historical testimonies = Besides legendas, different historical testimonies attest the importance of these thermal baths: Strabone speaks about them and even Plinius the Elder praises their therapeutic virtues: Nec vero omnes quae sint calidae medicatas esse credendum, sicut in Segesta Siciliae.  Morphology  The river Caldo, more than three metres large and less than 50 centimetres deep, in its first tract, runs between two high rocky walls. The rock next to the river shows sediments of travertino from Alcamo, formed by limestones created by hot waters. On the left river's bank there are four water springs, with a temperature of 47 Celsius degrees.  Thermal plants  Near the Segestan baths there are two thermal plants: #Terme Gorga (Alcamo):termegorga.com in contrada Gorga, at about one kilometre from Alcamo Diramazione railway station; the thermal waters near this plant, are concentrated in a natural basin among clay material and are alkaline-sulphuric; they have a temperature of about 49 ¬∞C and with a water flow of 80 litres a second. The plant is located inside an old mill restored about 50 year ago.Regione Siciliana - Terme di Alcamo e Castellammare #Terme Segestane (Castellammare del Golfo):termesegestane.com this plant is located in contrada Ponte Bagni where the mineral waters gush out at the temperature of about 47 ¬∞C and with a water flow of about 110 litre a second. The treatments provided here are mud baths, grottoes, massages, hydro-massages, aerosol inhalations and irrigations.  Flora and fauna  In the territory of Segestan thermal baths there are tamarisks and reeds Agroericino.com - Le terme Segestane Owing to its particular conformation, the rocky slopes near the river Caldo shelter a lot of birds' nests.  Properties of waters and muds  These waters are chloro- sulphate-alkaline-earthy: the analysis show that the content of sulphur derives from the dissolution of the particles of gypsum and sulphur that are in the subsoil, and that emerge near Vita and Calatafimi, crossed by these waters during their reascending.

Characteristics After flowering, potato plants produce small green fruits that resemble green cherry tomatoes, each containing about 300 seeds. Like all other parts of the plant except the tubers, the fruit contain the toxic alkaloid solanine and are therefore unsuitable for consumption. All new potato varieties are grown from seeds, also called \\"true potato seed\\", \\"TPS\\" or \\"botanical seed\\" to distinguish it from seed tubers. New varieties grown from seed can be propagated vegetatively by planting tubers, pieces of tubers cut to include at least one or two eyes, or cuttings, a practice used in greenhouses for the production of healthy seed tubers. Plants propagated from tubers are clones of the parent, whereas those propagated from seed produce a range of different varieties. Potato fruits are produced when the plants experience cool temperatures and sufficient water. In 2014, many gardeners in Michigan, United States, were alarmed when they found the green fruit which are not normally produced on the potato plant in that region. This was due to the weather in July that year being cooler and wetter than normal, allowing the plants' flowers sufficient time to be pollinated and produce fruit.

The school was located in the northwestern town of St. Augustine in Tunapuna‚ÄìPiarco, Trinidad and Tobago. The Abbey School opened in 1941 and closed in 1986. It offered a Catholic centered education and way of life. History The school was built in late thirties and started in 1941. The \\"boys\\", as those attending this boarding school were called, came mostly from Trinidad. Most were boarders but a dozen or so lived at home and were bused daily to attend classes. Other boarders came from the Caribbean region..Venezuela, Colombia, British and Dutch Guyanas, Barbados, Curacao, Martinique, Guadalupe, Dominica. The administration and teachers were primarily monks from the monastery. As time passed the number of non-monk and lay teachers increased. There were 7 grade levels; Preps A&B;, Forms I to V. The school followed the British education system. It followed a calendar year schedule till 1963 when it changed to a fiscal year from September to June. Sports played an important activity in the daily life of the students: football, cricket, basketball, volleyball, tennis, table tennis. The entire school was divided into three groups named St Anthony, St Lawrence and St Francis; within each group there were 3 divisions with different age groups. The Abbey School competed in cricket, football, tennis, basketball and swimming with other schools in and outside Trinidad. Scouting was another major activity in which a large number of boys participated in. Two major additions were made to the school in the late 1960s: an Olympic size pool and a refectory. The second floor of the refectory was an assembly hall where movies were shown every Saturday night, plays acted out, dances held, music shows presented by talented students. The pool presented a new opportunity for students to enjoy their free time. It led to the creation of the Aqua Lads swimming team which became a competitive force in Trinidad and the Caribbean area. The Black Power revolution that took place in Trinidad in 1970 had a negative impact on attracting new students from the other islands and countries. Financial challenges began to appear in the 1970s as the caribbean area economy began to face serious inflation related issues. By the 1980s the large number of Venezuelan boarders were reduced to only a handful. There were still about approximately 40‚Äì50 boarders and the Monastic Community were at pains to find ways to keep the school open for the 100 or so boys. A temporary solution was to employ more monk teachers and pay out less in salaries. This only worked for a short time and the school was closed at the end of the 1986 school year due to financial challenges. It is estimated that around 2000 boys or so were privileged to attend the Abbey School through its lifetime.

Building on the institutional revolution that shook Europe during the Middle Ages, this strand of research identifies the geographic determinants of the two institutional arrangements showing that the former is more important than the latter for the long-run economic growth. * _extractive policies_ with a special focus to the unitary origins of the present-day North-South of Italy divide. This gap was mainly induced by the region-specific policies selected by the Piedmontese elite, who dominated the first post-unitary governments, and that penalized more the regions farther away from the ruler's fiercer enemies.

Biography William Cant was born in Morpeth, Northumberland on 4 February 1753.\\"William Cant,\\" FamilySearch, www.familysearch.org/ He had studied the pipes with Old William Lamshaw, 'at an early age', according to the account of William Green (piper), his nephew, who was writing in the 1850s ‚Äì Green's mother Isabel was Cant's sister. Thomas Bewick, the engraver, who knew him, confirms in his memoirs that Cant was Old Lamshaw's pupil. Green also stated that Cant had been postboy to Joseph Turnbull, and learned with him, when the latter was postmaster at Alnwick.L. Jessop, \\"John Peacock, Some Facts and Thoughts,\\" Northumbrian Pipers Society Magazine, vol 12 (1991), pg. 14. Green's account also tells us that Cant played the Northumberland pipes 'in the Regiment', 'in the American War'. He appears in the earliest surviving records of the 1st Northumberland Militia in 1780, as a drummer. This Militia regiment was posted to the south of England around this time, but does not seem to have been posted overseas. He seems to have left the army shortly after ‚Äì the militia was stood down in 1782.Journal of the Northumbrian Pipers' Society, vol. 33 (2012), pg. 10. In 1780, he married a Rebecca Anderson in Beverley, Yorkshire, and in 1791 he worked as a victualler in Hull. At some point between 1801 and 1812, he was again in the North-East, as landlord of The Blue Bell, an inn at the head of Side, in Newcastle. That street is the main road down from the city centre to the quayside, and to the (at that time only) bridge across the Tyne to Gateshead. The Blue Bell seems to have been a significant piping venue, and was near the workshop of Thomas Bewick, who became a friend of Cant's. As Bewick was also a friend of John Peacock, it is very likely that Cant and Peacock knew each other well. When Cant died on 15 July 1821, Bewick wrote the following substantial obituary: > Died, Mr. William Cant, master of The Blue Bell, Head of the Side, aged 70, > formerly piper to the Northumberland Militia. He was an excellent performer > on the violin and Northumberland pipes; and like his great predecessors upon > the latter instrument, Turnbull, Gilley, old Lamshaw and John Peacock, he > kept up the ancient tunes, with all their charming lilts and pauses, > unspoiled by the modern improvers of the music with their 'idiot notes > impertinently long'.

It was connected to the Croesor Tramway, which ran through the valley. The quarry concentrated on producing specialist slate products, rather than roofing slates, and was managed for much of the time by the innovator Moses Kellow. It operated for about 50 years, from 1870 to 1920. History The Croesor Valley is bleak and remote, even today, but in the 1860s the Croesor Tramway was constructed along it, to facilitate the transport of slate products from Rhosydd quarry and Croesor quarry at the head of the valley. The tramway was built without Parliamentary authority in two parts, a section from Porthmadog to a rocky outcrop at Carreg-Hylldrem, to the north-west of the hamlet of Llanfrothen, which was constructed by obtaining a series of Wayleaves, and a continuation eastwards, beginning with the two Parc inclines, which was effectively a private tramway, as it was built on land leased by various quarry owners. It opened for traffic on 1 August 1864, when the first four loaded wagons of slates from Rhosydd Quarry were conveyed to Porthmadog. Parc, which was located to the east of the lower Parc incline, opened around 1870. It was also known as Ceunant Parc, to distinguish it from the Parc Slab Quarry, a little further up the valley, which was known as Garth Llwynog or Hen Dwll. There was an adit, from which chambers were developed, and the extracted slate was processed at a water-powered mill. The slate was not really suitable for the production of roofing slates, and so most of its early products were slate slabs. In 1883, there were 15 men working the quarry, and they produced 351 tons of finished slate. The quarry was connected to the Croesor Tramway at the foot of the Lower Parc incline. To reach that point, a tramway descended from the mill via a short incline, crossed the Afon Maesgwm by a bridge, and descended via a second incline to reach the junction. The Afon Maesgwm is a tributary of the Afon Croesor, which is itself a tributary of the Afon Glaslyn. =Moses Kellow= Moses Kellow, who was born on 5 June 1862 at Delabole, Cornwall, close to one of the largest slate quarries in Britain. His parents moved to Caernarfon some three years later, and besides his school education, his father trained him in engineering and geology. By the age of 20, around 1882, he was managing Parc. Slate in the Blaenau Ffestiniog region is generally found in veins which slope downwards at an acute angle from the horizontal, resulting in the quarries being underground once the initial surface rock has been removed. The veins are separated by layers of harder rock, often granite or chert, which are called \\"hards\\". The slate vein worked at Parc was about thick, and sloped downwards at about 42 degrees. Unusually, the pillaring line, one of the planes in which rock can be split, was almost horizontal rather than vertical, and the foot joints did not run in a suitable direction to detach slate blocks from the floor of a chamber. Additionally, the rock above the vein was not hard enough to support the roof of large chambers. Because of this, Kellow's father, William, decided in 1880 to work the quarry from the bottom upwards, rather than adopting the more normal practice of working from the top downwards. In order to achieve this, an incline was driven downwards through the slate to the deepest level at which the quarry was likely to be worked. From that point, a tunnel was driven sideways, to give access to a series of chambers, which were worked by extracting rock from the roof of the chambers. The process was made easier by drilling along the pillaring line. As blocks were extracted, they fell onto the waste rock at the bottom of the chamber, and waste rock did not need to be removed to the surface, since if formed a platform from which the quarrymen could work. Because the chambers were filled with rubbish as they were developed, there was little danger of roof collapses or the failure of pillars between adjacent chambers, which had caused disaster in nearby Blaenau Ffestiniog, when over six million tons of rock had collapsed into the Oakeley quarry during the winter of 1882/83, fortunately without loss of life. Moses Kellow gave evidence to a Royal Commission on this method of working a quarry, and whether it was applicable to the quarries in Blaenau Ffestiniog. Kellow was known as a \\"fearless innovator\\", who introduced new engineering solutions and working practices. The initial shaft at Parc was square, and descended through five galleries from the main adit to a depth of . He tried using compressed air drills while it was being constructed, but did not think that they provided much advantage over hand drilling. However, once it was completed, compressed air was used to pump water from the bottom of the quarry, and to power winches, which were used to load the extracted blocks onto wagons for transport to the surface. The internal incline was powered by a Rigg hydraulic rotary engine, rated at . A head of water provided at the shaft to drive the machine. He believed that with such a pressure, he should be able to operate a hydraulic injector to dewater the quarry, but none were on the market, and manufacturers in Britain and America were convinced that such an idea would not work without a supply of steam. He persisted, and found a continental manufacturer who was prepared to build a prototype. Once installed, it successfully raised water from the bottom of the shaft, and with no moving parts, did not need regular maintenance. The only control was a pressure valve, which was opened and closed to start and stop the pumping. As a result of the unusual direction of the pillaring plane, the quarry yielded slate which was very long but quite narrow, and Kellow decided that it was suitable for slate ridging. He improved manufacturing methods, doubling the output per man, and supplied plain ridging extensively to Britain and the Continent. Where such ridging was not sufficiently decorative, he produced a three-part interlocking design, where the two interlocking sides were held together by a central decorative crest, before being cemented onto the ridge of a roof. A variety of patterns were available for the crest, but the extra cost of producing it meant that it was less widely used. The result of specialising on these products, marketed at Parcro, was that the quarry was relatively profitable. The quarry was eventually worked on seven levels, four below the adit, one at adit level, and two above it. There were two mills associated with the quarry, both water powered, containing six saws, three dressers and three planers. In January 1892, Kellow married Nell Williams, the daughter of Thomas and Elizabeth Williams of Bryn, Croesor. Thomas had been the manager of Croesor quarry for many years, although it had not been in production since 1878. He died around 1895, and Kellow took over the management of Croesor. He saw it as a source of roofing slates to go with the ridging that Parc produced, and set about reopening it. The Parc and Croesor Quarries were amalgamated in early 1896. =Innovation= Kellow's talent for seeing issues and finding innovative solutions to them continued at Croesor, and two in particular benefitted the workforce at Parc. The first was a change in working practice. Traditionally, slate was extracted as bargains, which consisted of a group of four men, two rockmen who worked underground extracting the blocks of slate from a specific chamber, and two who worked on the surface processing the blocks to make the slate products. When development work was occurring underground, the surface workers would have nothing to do, and then when rock was being produced, the underground workers often could not work as fast as they would like due to a surplus of blocks awaiting processing. To Kellow's mind, the situation was made worse by the fact that while one group of surface workers was overwhelmed with blocks, another group might have nothing to do. He decided to split the link between rockmen and slate-makers, so that blocks arrived at the surface, and were then allocated to the slate-makers by ballot. There was initial resistance to such a change in working practice, but in the first month, output increased by 25 percent, and the opposition melted away as the workers saw their wages increase significantly. The practice was implemented at Parc, and ultimately in a number of the major quarries in North Wales. His next innovation was a hydraulic drill, powered by high-pressure water. A number of quarries were experimenting with compressed air percussive drills, but Kellow disliked them, because they were noisy, created clouds of dust, and were uncomfortable to the men who had to use them for long periods. His design of twist drill was attached to the rock by making two holes, which acted as anchorages, and pressure of 2 to 3 tons was applied, which enabled a hole to be drilled in under two minutes. Previously, hand drilling of such a hole took around ten hours, and the new process created no dust. Kellow implemented another change in working practice, so that rockmen in a chamber would create the two small anchorage holes where they needed a hole to be drilled, and then call for the drilling team, probably one man and an assistant, who would set up the drill, drill the hole, and move on to the next chamber. The drilling team had an interest in maintaining the drill, and the rockmen could get on with blasting the rock and extracting blocks. Kellow refined the design of the drill over the years, and they were used extensively at Croesor and Parc, and found some use at Llechwedd quarry in Blaenau Ffestiniog, but Weaver has suggested that it failed to find wider markets because Kellow did not emphasise the changes in working practice which made it a success in his own quarries. =Demise= It is not clear exactly when the quarry ceased to be worked. Kellow states that it was worked from the bottom upwards for 33 years, which he says was the whole time that it was worked, and that production ceased midway through World War I, as there was no longer a market for the slate products which it produced. The details in his autobiography were dictated from memory around 1941, by which time he was almost blind. Richards states that the quarry closed in 1920. Remains Apart from the drumhouses, most of the access tramway is no longer traceable. However, a number of the buildings associated with the quarry are in good condition, and some have been reused, including the office, which is unusually ornate and has become a house. The Afon Maesgwm which runs through the site has been bridged in several places by huge slate slabs, and is almost culverted.

He was grandson of Sri Sri Sri Maharaj Adhirajkumar Chandrarup Shah, 4th son of King Prithvipati Shah of Gorkha. His 3 brothers were Dilip Shah, Hasti Dal Shah (warrior killed at Anglo-Nepalese war) and Rudra Bir Shah. Works He was a Minister of State in 1800 A.D. and the Governor of Kumaun from 1814 to 1815 A.D. at Anglo-Nepalese war. Out at west Nepalese were hopelessly overextended. Kumaun, a key link in Nepal Army communications with Far West was defended by around 750 Nepalese with equal number of Kumauni irregulars, altogether 1500 men to defend a whole province. Doti which was east of Kumaun had been practically stripped out of troops. Governor Bam Shah had full responsibility of defense of the province. British force numbering initially over 4500 men was easily able to out maneuver Nepalese Army defenders and had to abandon one post after another. Despite significant victory over Captain Hearsey's force which had been sent in flanking movement through Eastern Kumaun and the capture of captain himself, Bam Shah's Nepalese force couldn't stern the tide of British advance. Meanwhile, Lord Hastings sent Colonel Nicolls, Quartermaster-General for all British force in India, to take charge of Almoda campaign and assigned 2000 army men with large irregulars against 1000 Nepalese. Bam Shah's brother Hasti Dal Shah arrived with 500 men were intercepted at Almoda's Northern Line of Communications with Kathmandu. Hastidal was killed at the first moments and Nepalese suffered heavy losses. The news reached Almoda Fort which was under responsibility of Bam Shah. British was able to establish gun positions at seventy yards from gate of fort of Almoda and the British artillery demolished walls of fort at point blank range.

In 1253/4, along with George Kleidas, the Metropolitan of Cyzicus, he led an embassy on behalf of the Nicaean emperor John III Doukas Vatatzes (r. 1222‚Äì54) to Rome, to negotiate with Pope Innocent IV about a possible Union of the Churches. The embassy was detained for several months by Conrad IV, and arrive in Rome only in April 1254. The proposed terms, including the return of Constantinople to the Greeks and the reinstatement of the Orthodox bishops across all Latin-held territories in exchange for the recognition of Papal primacy, led nowhere, On their return, the envoys were reprimanded by Vatatzes' successor, Theodore II Laskaris (r. 1254‚Äì58), for their conduct of the negotiations. Andronikos was an opponent of Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259‚Äì82). According to George Akropolites, he engaged in agitation against the emperor in Paphlagonia. As a result, in 1260 he was deposed and tonsured as a monk (with the name of Athanasios) at the Monastery of the Saviour at Selymbria by Joannicius, Metropolitan of Philadelphia. Patriarch Arsenios Autoreianos repeatedly tried to have him reinstated in 1261‚Äì65, but the Church synod always blocked him. Andronikos was finally restored to his see in 1283 by Michael VIII's son and successor Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282‚Äì1328), who tried to tread a middle course between the Arsenite faction‚Äîthe supporters of Arsenios Autoreianos, who refused to recognize Michael VIII's legitimacy after Arsenios had excommunicated him‚Äîand their opponents, who had remained loyal to Michael VIII and been willing to support his ultimately failed attempt to achieve Union with the Roman Catholic Church. As a further gesture towards the Arsenites, Andronikos II even appointed the Metropolitan of Sardis as his personal confessor. After Patriarch Joseph I Galesiotes died in March 1283, the Arsenites expected one of their own to be named as his successor. Emperor Andronikos II however chose a neutral candidate, Gregory II, and the Arsenites became further entrenched in their demands to bring to account of all those who had supported the Union under Michael VIII. Andronikos of Sardis in particular distinguished himself with his intransigent stance in the Synod held at Blachernae shortly after Gregory II's appointment, at which several prominent churchmen, as well as the Empress-dowager Theodora Palaiologina were forced to recant and apologize for their past stance. Nevertheless, the stand- off continued, and came to the fore again in another synod at Adramyttion in 1284. Mired in dispute over the legitimacy of Gregory II's appointment, the synod achieved little, but one of his pupils denounced Andronikos for lese majeste. Andronikos, who had been eyeing the patriarchate himself, found himself deposed once more and returned to the rank of a simple monk. Indeed, the Metropolitan of Larissa Nikandros is said to have mockingly removed his bishop's mitre and replaced it with a monk's cowl in front of the entire synod.

It is formulated in combination with dihydroxyprogesterone acetophenide (DHPA; algestone acetophenide), a progestin, and is used specifically as a combined injectable contraceptive. EBB is not available for medical use alone.https://www.drugs.com/international/estradiol.html The medication, in combination with DHPA, is given by injection into muscle once a month. Side effects of EBB include breast tenderness, breast enlargement, nausea, headache, and fluid retention. EBB is a synthetic estrogen and hence is an agonist of the estrogen receptor, the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. It is an estrogen ester and a prodrug of estradiol in the body. Because of this, it is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen. EBB was first described in 1938. It was developed for use as a form of birth control in the 1970s and was introduced for medical use for this indication by the 1980s. The medication is used in combination with DHPA as a combined injectable contraceptive in Peru and Singapore. Medical uses EBB is used in combination with DHPA as a once-a-month combined injectable contraceptive to prevent pregnancy in women. =Available forms= The combination of EBB and DHPA contains 10 mg estradiol benzoate butyrate (EBB), an estrogen, and 150 mg algestone acetophenide (dihydroxyprogesterone acetophenide; DHPA), a progestin. Side effects The combination of EBB and DHPA is said to be associated with poor control of menstrual bleeding when used as a once-a-month combined injectable contraceptive. Pharmacology Estradiol, the active form of EBB. =Pharmacodynamics= EBB is an estradiol ester, or a prodrug of estradiol. As such, it is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors. EBB is of about 64% higher molecular weight than estradiol due to the presence of its C3 benzoate and C17Œ≤ n-butyrate esters. Because EBB is a prodrug of estradiol, it is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen. The estrogenic potency of oral ethinylestradiol is approximately 30-fold higher than that of parenteral EBB. In accordance, 50 Œºg/day oral ethinylestradiol has been reported to be about 3 times stronger in estrogenic effect than once-a-month injections of 10 mg EBB. =Pharmacokinetics= A single 10 mg intramuscular injection of EBB has a duration of approximately 3 weeks. Its duration is shorter than that of estradiol enantate. A preliminary study of the duration of EBB relative to other estradiol esters was conducted in 1952. Chemistry EBB is a synthetic estrane steroid and the C3 benzoate (benzenecarboxylate) and C17Œ≤ n-butyrate (butanoate) diester of estradiol. It is also known as estradiol 3-benzoate 17Œ≤-n-butyrate or as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17Œ≤-diol 3-benzoate 17Œ≤-n- butyrate.

Developed by Westwood Studios, published by Hasbro Electronic Entertainment and distributed by Virgin Interactive Entertainment. This title was one of many inspired by the property. It was later reissued in 1998 with a different box art.  Gameplay  The game is an adaption of the board game of the same name, with the components of physical gameplay given automation and digital representations. 3D animations are provided for player movement across the board. Up to six human players can play either on the same computer or over LAN. The game's music was in a MIDI format and had a ragtime theme, while the sound effects were in WAV. Like the board game, players roll the dice, travel around the board to collect properties, and aim to bankrupt their opponents.  Development  The game was developed by Las Vegas software development company Westwood Studios, on behalf of publisher Hasbro Electronic Entertainment (later Hasbro Interactive). The division was created by Hasbro in 1995 to create video game adaptions of their most popular titles. In a May 1995 edition of Bangor Daily News, it was reported that Hasbro Interactive was currently testing the game, which the company claimed would be the first to have a multiplayer feature allowing players to play each other over the Internet. While Hasbro stockholders expected to see the game during the company's annual New York City meeting on May 12, 1995, the game was officially previewed at the 1995 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles. Monopoly was released in September 1995 to coincide with the board game's 60th anniversary, allowing over 23 million players to play in a variety of languages; the game offered immediate translations of currency exchange and properties, allowing international players to view regional versions of the game when playing.  Reception  =Sales= According to market research firm PC Data, Monopoly was the 11th-best-selling computer game in the United States for the year 1996. The game placed fifth on PC Data's annual chart the next year, with 397,864 units sold and almost $13 million earned in revenue. In 1998, Monopoly sold another 273,937 copies and earned an additional $6.36 million in the United States alone; this secured it position 16 on PC Data's sales rankings that year. The game claimed sixth place for the first six months of 1999, but dropped to 20th for the full year, with sales of 265,408 units. Monopolys sales in the United States alone reached 1.27 million copies by September 1999. As a result, PC Data declared it the country's fifth-best- selling computer game from that date to January 1993. =Critical reviews= Trent Ward of GameSpot wrote that while the notion of making a video game adaption of Monopoly was a \\"simple concept\\", the version that the developers came up with was \\"brilliant\\" because they \\"set their minds to it\\". The Jerusalem Post wrote that the \\"wonderful\\" adaption \\"loses nothing\\" from its source material, and added that its only disadvantage was that observant Jews couldn't play the game during Shabbat. The Washington Times thought the developer brought the board game \\"to a new level\\", and noted that the digital version takes away the intrusive issue of \\"Who's going to be the banker?\\". Macworlds Michael Gowan praised Monopolys animation and online play, and found its straightforward design \\"a more-than-welcome breather from a sea of uninspiring games trying to do too much.\\" He summarized it as \\"just as enjoyable as the original [board game].\\" According to Media Matrix Inc., Monopoly was the 20th top game played by U.S. Home PC users across March 2000, with 454 unique persons, 0.52% share across PC users, and 0.94% share across PC game users. Monopoly was a runner-up for Computer Gaming Worlds award for the best \\"Classics/Puzzles\\" game of 1995, which ultimately went to You Don't Know Jack. The editors praised it as \\"the best conversion [of Monopoly] to the computer yet.\\" In 1996, the magazine named Monopoly the 113th best game ever. The editors wrote, \\"Based on the quintessential family boardgame, this Internet-capable version of Monopoly offered more than we ever expected in a computer version.\\"  References   External links  * Monopoly at MobyGames Category:1995 video games Category:Hasbro games Category:Mac OS games Category:Monopoly video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games scored by Frank Klepacki Category:Westwood Studios games Category:Windows games ","title":"Monopoly (1995 video game)"},{"id":"51813462","text":"Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority or BEZA () is a centralized economic zones authority of Bangladesh which was instituted by the government in November 2010 under Bangladesh Economic Zones Act, 2010.

Following the murder in August 1993, Maxson spent over two decades in prison before being released in September 2016. Murder and trial On August 29, 1993, the badly beaten body of six year old Lindsay Murdoch was found on South State Street, Chicago. Maxson had mentioned to a TV reporter that he had bought a packet of potato chips for the boy on August 28 and told him to go home. The police picked up Maxson and, according to Maxson, he was beaten and tortured until he signed a confession (The State of Illinois Torture Inquiry and Relief Commission found in 2013 that Maxson's accusations were credible). Maxson refused to sign and withdrew his confession. Fingerprints on a piece of broken glass, blood on the boys shirt and a pubic hair found at the crime scene did not match Maxson. In spite of no physical evidence linking him to the crime, Maxson was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in jail plus 50 years by Judge Daniel Locallo who said of Maxson: \\"You are a man of malignant heart and I find you must be eliminated from society,\\" Exoneration The Cook County, Illinois Conviction Integrity Unit got the Illinois state's attorney's office to agree to DNA testing of the evidence in 2015.

The battle was the starting point of the second phase of the Spring Campaign, during which the Hungarians planned to relieve the fortress of Kom√°rom from an Austrian siege, and to encircle the Austrian forces headquartered in the Hungarian capitals of Buda and Pest. The Hungarians won the battle. The Austrian commander, Major General Christian G√∂tz, was fatally wounded, dying shortly after the battle. His body was buried by the Hungarian commander Art√∫r G√∂rgei with full military honors as a mark of respect. Background With the Battle of Isaszeg the Hungarian Revolutionary Army led by Art√∫r G√∂rgei managed to force the Austrian Habsburg Imperial Army led by Field Marshal Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr√§tz to retreat towards the Hungarian capitals of Pest and Buda. This liberated the Hungarian territories between the Tisza and the Danube rivers. The imperial troops took up a strong defensive line before Pest.. The Hungarian commanders did not attempt to storm the position, but encircled Pest up to the Danube, and held in position until 9 April. The imperial army retreated to the capital.. On 7 April a new campaign plan was made. According to this plan the Hungarian army was to split; General Lajos Aulich with the Hungarian II Corps and Colonel Lajos Asb√≥th‚Äôs division remained in front of Pest, demonstrating to make the imperials believe that the whole Hungarian army was there. This diverted their attention from the north, where the real Hungarian attack was to start with I, III and VII Corps moving west along the northern bank of the Danube to Kom√°rom, to relieve it from the imperial siege. Kmety's division of VII Corps was to cover the three corps's march, and after I and III Corps occupied V√°c, the division was to secure the town, while the rest of the troops together with the two remaining divisions of VII Corps were to advance to the Garam river, then head south to relieve the northern section of the Austrian siege of the fortress of Kom√°rom. After this, they were to cross the Danube and relieve the southern section of the siege. If all this could be completed successfully, the imperials would have only two choices: to retreat from Middle Hungary towards Vienna, or be encircled in the Hungarian capitals by the Hungarians. This plan was very risky (as was the first plan of the Spring Campaign too) because if Windisch- Gr√§tz had discovered that only one Hungarian corps remained in front of Pest, he could have destroyed Aulich's force, and thereby easily cut the lines of communication of the main Hungarian army, and even occupied Debrecen, the seat of the Hungarian Revolutionary Parliament and the National Defense Committee (interim government of Hungary), or he could encircle the three corps advancing to relieve Kom√°rom. Although the president of the National Defense Committee (interim government of Hungary), Lajos Kossuth went to the Hungarian headquarters at G√∂d√∂ll≈ë, after the battle of Isaszeg and wanted a direct attack on Pest, he was finally convinced by G√∂rgey that his and the other generals' plan was better.. To secure the success of the Hungarian army, the National Defense Committee sent 100 wagons with munitions from Debrecen. G√∂tz, Christian (1783‚Äì1849) Damjanich J√°nos After the Battle of Isaszeg, Field Marshal Windisch-Gr√§tz ordered the division quartered in Balassagyarmat to defend the Ipoly valley, led by Lieutenant General Georg von Ramberg, to move to V√°c, to secure the Danube Bend from a Hungarian attack. But at the same time he made the mistake of ordering Lieutenant General Anton Csorich, who actually was defending V√°c with his division, to move to Pest. If two imperial divisions had been defending V√°c when the Hungarians attacked, they would have had more chance of repelling them. On 10 April, when the Hungarian army planned to attack V√°c, G√∂rgey feared an imperial attack against his troops in the region before Pest. And indeed Windisch-Gr√§tz ordered a general advance of his I and III Corps, to learn whether the Hungarian main army was in front of Pest or had moved northwards. But the Hungarian II Corps led by General Aulich, together with VII Corps and much of I Corps, easily repelled the attack.. At the same time, the deceptive maneuvers by Aulich and Asb√≥th managed to attract the attention of the imperials, who did not notice the march of III Corps, led by J√°nos Damjanich.. As a result, the field marshal was unable to obtain the information he needed. The inefficiency of the imperial reconnaissance is shown by the fact that on 12 and 14 April (4 days after the battle of V√°c, when the main Hungarian army had already departed towards Kom√°rom, and only II Corps remained there), Anton Csorich reported that Pest was in danger of being attacked by substantial Hungarian forces. Aulich and Asb√≥th‚Äôs troops did their job of making the imperials believe that the main Hungarian army was still in front of the capital so well that neither Windisch-Gr√§tz until his dismissal, nor Lieutenant Field Marshal Josip Jelaƒçiƒá (interim commander until the arrival of Feldzeugmeister Ludwig von Welden who was named as the new commander-in-chief), dared to do anything.. In contrast, the Hungarian reconnaissance was excellent, learning that Windisch-Gr√§tz was still before Pest with three army corps awaiting the Hungarian attack, and that Ramberg‚Äôs division, composed of the G√∂tz and Jablonowski brigades, was at V√°c blocking the road to the Danube valley and to the V√°g river.. Prelude Contemporary map of the territory where the Battle of V√°c (10 April 1849) took place, and its surroundings, where the military movements took place Because of the participation of VII Corps and much of I Corps in the skirmishes around Pest, the Hungarian army which moved towards V√°c was composed only of III Corps and Lieutenant-Colonel J√°nos Bobich‚Äôs brigade of I Corps. The rest of I Corps only arrived at V√°c after the end of the battle. According to L√°szl√≥ Pusztaszeri (in 1984) the whole Hungarian I Corps joined the advance of III Corps towards V√°c, but this is unlikely.. The military historian R√≥bert Hermann, writing 20 years later (2004) states that only Bobich‚Äôs brigade accompanied III Corps towards V√°c.. They started to move north at 4 o'clock in the afternoon of 9 April, followed by VII Corps, which was extracted bit by bit from among the Hungarian forces performing the demonstrations. On the morning of the 10th of April, after his troops arrived at V√°c, General Damjanich sent Bobich‚Äôs brigade of 2,973 men and 20 cannon through R√°d and Kosd to encircle the imperial troops from V√°c. But Bobich‚Äôs infantry lost their way in the fog and moved towards Penc (east instead of west), so his troops failed to appear in the battle.. At the last moment before the battle the imperial commander, Georg von Ramberg, fell ill, so Major General Christian G√∂tz took command. Windisch-Gr√§tz had advised him to retreat west to the Garam (in Slovakian Hron) river without a fight if he faced superior numbers. G√∂tz‚Äôs men had not fought since the middle of February, being kept busy moving hither and thither in northern Hungary, in this aspect the battle- hardened Hungarian troops had the advantage. Battle On a rainy 10th of April, Damjanich started his attack against V√°c from the south at 9 o'clock, moving along the Pest-V√°c road, because on that morning the fields were impassable due to wet weather. The road which led to V√°c crossed the stone bridge over the Gomb√°s creek, so G√∂tz had posted his infantry on it.. At this moment G√∂tz was unaware of a serious Hungarian attack, thinking it was a numerically inferior force making a demonstration. Thus when he saw the Hungarians deploy their cannon, he only strengthened his outposts by sending his 2nd battalion to position itself along the Gomb√°s creek, between the railway embankment and the Danube. The battle started with an artillery duel, which lasted several hours. Damjanich deployed Czillich‚Äôs and Leiningen‚Äôs brigades on the left wing, and Kiss‚Äôs and K√∂k√©nyessy‚Äôs on the right. He was waiting for Bobich to complete the encirclement of the imperial troops, but in vain. In the meanwhile G√∂tz realized that he faced a numerically superior army, and at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, decided to start his retreat from the town. He ordered his brigade commanders to withdraw from the city, but he wanted to hold the bridge until his troops were far enough from the Hungarians to be safe. The fighting around the bridge in the Battle of V√°c on 10 April 1849 Seeing no sign of Bobich‚Äôs brigade in the enemy rear, Damjanich ran out of patience and ordered his infantry to charge the bridge, while his artillery fired incessantly. G√∂tz saw his troops start to retreat from in front of the bridge because of the huge pressure from the Hungarians. He rode forward, yelling: \\"Advance, do not retreat!\\" In that moment he was hit by a shell splinter in his forehead, while his horse was taken down by at least ten bullets. The Austrian soldiers caught him as he fell, and took their wounded commander to the military boarding school in V√°c.. The wounding of Christian G√∂tz in the Battle of V√°c, 10 April 1849 Wysocki‚Äôs division was the first to charge the bridge, but its several repeated attacks crumbled under the fire of the imperial kaiserj√§gers. After its failure the 3rd and the 9th battalions, which were among the most renowned Hungarian units, came up to try, but the soldiers were not willing to risk their lives in a seemingly hopeless task. Then came to the scene the commander of the 3rd battalion, Major K√°roly F√∂ldv√°ry, the hero of the Battle of T√°pi√≥bicske. He took the flag of his battalion and rode onto the bridge with it, under a hail of bullets from the enemy soldiers who occupied half of the bridge. His horse was shot dead in seconds, but he went back to his soldiers, took another horse and rode up the bridge again, and the same thing happened: the horse fell down beneath him in a second, but he remained unharmed. In that moment the imperial officer who was ordering the volleys was so astonished by this recklessness that he forgot to tell his soldiers to shoot, and in that moment the men of the 9th battalion arrived on the bridge and swept away the Austrian resistance. After that the other Hungarian battalions also crossed the bridge, and in heavy street fighting pushed the imperials out of the city. During this street fighting the Hungarians reached the building of the military boarding school where the wounded G√∂tz lay, defended by the Bianchi infantry regiment. The Hungarians occupied it after heavy fighting, and found the Austrian commander inside, taking him prisoner along with many enemy soldiers. The imperial troops which fought by the railway embankment withstood for an hour after the Hungarians crossed the bridge, preventing an encirclement of the imperial troops from the east, then they also retreated in heavy fighting. The imperial forces, now led by Major General Felix Jablonowski, retreated from V√°c in heavy street fighting, heading towards Ver≈ëce. The Austrian commander deployed two gun batteries, one of 12-pounders, the other of 6 pounders, and a rocket battery, to support his troops' withdrawal. His troops retreated in good order.. Aftermath G√∂rgey and G√∂tz. Winzenz Katzler One of the Polish Legion‚Äôs medics took care of G√∂tz's wounds. On 11 April G√∂rgey arrived in V√°c, and one of the first things he did was to visit G√∂tz and ask how he was feeling. But because of his wound, G√∂tz had lost his ability to talk, could not respond. His last wish was to be buried together with his ring. He received extreme unction from a Hungarian army chaplain, who prayed next to him until he died. G√∂tz was buried on 12 April, his coffin being carried by Hungarian soldiers on their shoulders accompanied by military music and drumbeat, in front of the Hungarian soldiers and the Austrian prisoners. The coffin was lowered to the grave by three generals: G√∂rgey, Gy√∂rgy Klapka, Damjanich and a staff officer.. In 1850 G√∂tz's widow showed gratitude for the care and respect paid to her husband by his enemies, by donating 2,000 forints to the military boarding school in which her husband had spent his last hours.. From a tactical point of view, although they had lost their commander, the imperial defeat was not heavy, and the army could retreat in good order.. After the battle Damjanich was dissatisfied with the performance of some Hungarian commanders and units, believing that this battle could have been a more decisive victory. The irascible, impetuous general criticized the slowness of the cautious Klapka, who could have arrived at the battlefield in time if he had moved faster, and also General J√≥zsef Nagys√°ndor, the commander of the cavalry, for the tardy pursuit of the enemy after the battle.. He also wanted to decimate the Polish Legion because they ran away after the first attack, but G√∂rgey arrived and prevented this. Damjanich was angry at the lack of exploitation of this victory, and of others before it in the Spring Campaign (T√°pi√≥bicske, Isaszeg), and he believed that the other commanders were responsible. With the victory at V√°c, the Hungarian army opened the way towards the Garam river. After the battle the imperial command in Pest continued to believe that the main Hungarian forces were still before the capital. This was because only one corps participated in the Battle of V√°c, which made Windisch-Gr√§tz think that the rest of the Hungarian army had not yet arrived in Pest.. When he finally seemed to grasp what was really happening, he wanted to make a powerful attack on 14 April against the Hungarians at Pest, and then cross the Danube at Esztergom, cutting off the army which was marching towards Kom√°rom. But his corps commanders, General Franz Schlik and Lieutenant Field Marshal Josip Jelaƒçiƒá, refused to obey, so his plan, which could have caused serious problems to the Hungarian armies, was not realized.. To hold back the Hungarian advance to the west towards Kom√°rom, Windisch-Gr√§tz, sent an order to Lieutenant General Ludwig von Wohlgemuth to stop them with the reserve corps formed from imperial troops from Vienna, Styria, Bohemia and Moravia. These troops would suffer a heavy defeat on 19 April by the Hungarian army in the Battle of Nagysall√≥, and with that the Hungarians opened the way to besieged Kom√°rom.. But when these events took palace, Windisch-Gr√§tz was no longer in Hungary, because in the meanwhile, on 12 April he was relieved of his command of the imperial troops in Hungary by the emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. Feldzeugmeister Ludwig von Welden was appointed in his place.

Biography  Presidency College, Chennai. Thavamani Jegajothivel Pandian, born on 15 June 1929 in Palamedu, a small town in Madurai district of the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu to Kumarasamy Thavamani and Valliammal couple, graduated in science from Thiagarajar College, Madurai in 1960 and completed his master's degree from Presidency College, Chennai in 1962, both the colleges affiliated to Madras University, before securing a doctoral degree (PhD) in 1965 from the same university. His post-doctoral studies were at Bilogische Anstalt, Helgoland, Germany and he obtained the degree of Doctor of Natural Sciences (Dr. rer. nat.) from Kiel University in 1968. Returning to India, he started his career at Bangalore University as a lecturer in 1968 and moved to his home town in 1971 to join Madurai Kamaraj University as a reader where he served till his superannuation, holding positions of a professor (1976‚Äì92) and a senior professor (1994‚Äì95). In between, he served as a visiting scientist at Oxford University (1973), as a visiting professor at Columbia University and University of South Carolina (1981‚Äì82), as an overseas associate at Kyoto University (1989) and as a UNESCO lecturer at Ghent University (2003‚Äì04). Post his superannuation, he held the position of a National Professor of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research from 1996 to 2002, an Emeritus Scientist of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research from 2002 to 2005 and an INSA senior scientist from 2005 to 2009. He has chaired the Task Force Committee on Aqua and Marine Biotechnology of the Department of Biotechnology and is associated with Ecology Institute, Germany as a visiting scientist since 1985 and with MS Swaminathan Research Foundation as a visiting professor since 1996. He also served the councils of the Indian National Science Academy in 1990 and National Academy of Agricultural Sciences from 1998 to 2000. Pandian is married to Muthu Shanthakumari and the couple has a son, Sathish Kinne Pandian who is a urologist. The family lives in Madurai.  Legacy  A species of catfish (Ameiurus melas) Pandian's early work was in the field of bioenergetics and focusing on metabolism, he developed a model for predicting the transformation of food energy into growth. He published his research findings in Marine Biology journal of Springer in an article, Intake, digestion, absorption and conversion of food in the fishes Megalops cyprinoides and Ophiocephalus striatus, which eventually became a citation classic. Subsequently, shifting his attention to the sexuality of fish, he demonstrated that the sperm survived in catfish for over 240 days if they were preserved at -20o degree Celsius and could still be fertilized, a discovery which had commercial relevance in places where liquid nitrogen is not easily available. Later, he created the first transgenic fish from preserved sperm and genome-inactivated eggs of compatible species which helped him to generate interspecific and intergeneric androgenetic clones. Furthering the researches, he created supermales (with YY chromosomes) of tilapia, barbs and guppies (Poecilia reticulata) and superfemales (ZZ) in molly (Poecilia sphenops) species, reportedly for the first time in India. He used these monosex organisms to mass-produce monosex progenies in catfish. He is also credited with the cloning and production of fish-based growth hormone gene transformation vectors and with the restoration of rosy barb species using preserved sperms and genome-inactivated eggs of tiger barb. His researches are documented in a number of books which include Animal Energetics: Bivalvia through reptilia, Animal Energetics: Protozoa through insecta, Sex Determination in Fish, Genetic Sex Differentiation in Fish, Environmental Sex Differentiation in Fish and Reproduction and Development in Crustacea, and over 250 science articles; ResearchGate, an online repository of scientific papers, has listed 133 of them. Pandian was one among the biologists who founded the Asian Fisheries Society (AFS), a non-profit scientific society for the promotion of fisheries and aquaculture, in 1984 and sat in its fourth council from 1992 to 1995. He is a former member of the governing body of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and the academic councils of the Jawaharlal Nehru University and the Central Institute of Fisheries Education. He has been associated with several science journals including Journal of Asian Fisheries Science, Hydrobiologia, Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, Marine Ecology Progress Series, Indian Journal of Marine Sciences and Journal of Scientific and Industrial Research and is a former associate editor of Current Science, consultant editor of Korean Journal of Aquaculture and a guest editor of Current Science and Hydrobiologia. He coordinated the USERS Project of the Department of Science and Technology during 2012‚Äì14 and has mentored 36 scholars in their doctoral researches. He is also a Member of the Governing Council and an Advisor of the Centre for Scientific & Applied Research of PSN College of Engineering and Technology, Tirunelveli and the Inspire Internship Camp of Velammal Institute of Technology, Panchetti and he has attended several seminars and conferences to deliver keynote addresses, notably the National Seminar on Sustainability of Seafood Production in 2006 and the CSIR Foundation Day lecture in 2012.  Awards and honors  Pandian, who held the National Lectureship and the National Fellowship of the University Grants Commission of India during 1985‚Äì86 and 1989‚Äì91 respectively, received the Hooker Award of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute in 1978. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, one of the highest Indian science awards in 1984 for his contributions to bioenergetics and animal ecology. The next year, he received the ECI Prize of the Ecology Institute where he has been serving as an adviser since then. WorldFish awarded him the Naga Award in 1991 and three years later, he received the 1994 K.N. Bahl Memorial Gold Medal of the Society of Biosciences, Delhi. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research selected him as National Professor in 1996 and the Council for Science and Technology of the Government of Tamil Nadu chose him for the Tamil Nadu Scientist Award in 1997. Pandian is an elected fellow of a number of major Indian science academies. The National Academy of Sciences, India elected him as a fellow in 1984 and he became a fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences, the next year. Two years later, he was elected as a fellow of the Indian National Science Academy, which was followed by his election as fellow by the National Academy of Agricultural Sciences in 1992.

Biography George Stillman was born in Laramie, Wyoming, but was raised in Ontario, California. He began working with photography while still a teenager and at the age of 17 or 18 won first prize for creative photography in the Golden Gate International Exposition. He got an Associate degree at Chaffey College (1941) and then enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, but in 1942 he was drafted to serve in the military in World War II. After the war ended, he studied painting at the California School of Fine Arts (CSFA, now the San Francisco Art Institute), where he got to know a number of other emerging first-generation Bay Area Abstract Expressionist artists. With some of them, he formed a group that became known as the \\"Sausalito Six\\" because most lived in the waterfront town of Sausalito just north of San Francisco. The group consisted of Richard Diebenkorn, John Hultberg, Frank Lobdell, Walter Kuhlman, James Budd Dixon, and Stillman, who was one of the youngest members. Stillman lived in Oakland, where he had a photography studio, but he had close ties with the rest of the group and often visited them and exhibited with them. The late 1940s were very active years for Stillman, who produced over 1000 paintings, prints, and other artworks in this period. His work ranged from pure abstraction to figurative subjects treated expressionistically; one writer refers to it as hailing from the \\"quietest branch of Abstract Expressionism, which preferred to transport the imagination rather than jolt the senses\\". During this period, he collaborated with other members of the Sausalito Six to create a portfolio of 17 lithographs entitled Drawings (1948) that is considered a landmark in the history of Abstract Expressionist printmaking. In 1949, the San Francisco Museum of Art honored him with the Ann Bremer Award. However, in the 1950s, when he went to Mexico to study and later take up a teaching job at the University of Guadalajara, he hauled most of his work to the dump. As a consequence, only a few dozen works survive from this phase of his career. In the 1960s, Stillman went back to school, earning a B.F.A. (1968) and then an M.F.A. (1970) from Arizona State University. He subsequently taught art at Columbus College in Georgia (1970‚Äì72) and at Central Washington University (1972‚Äì88), where he was chair of the Art Department. He died in Ellensburg, Washington. Stillman's work is held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York), the Oakland Museum (California), the British Museum (London), and numerous other art institutions.

It is a widely used mechanical means of creating a high gain fluid amplifier. In industrial control systems they played an important part in the development of pneumatic PID controllers and are still widely used today in pneumatic and hydraulic control and instrumentation systems. Operating principle Basic mechanism of nozzle and flapper pneumatic displacement detector. The operating principle makes use of the high gain effect when a \\"flapper\\" plate is placed a small distance from a small pressurized nozzle emitting a fluid. The example shown is pneumatic. At sub-millimeter distances a small movement of the flapper plate results in a large change in flow. The nozzle is fed from a chamber which is in turn fed by a restriction, so changes of flow result in changes of chamber pressure. The nozzle diameter must be larger than the restriction orifice in order to work.Singh p 481 The high gain of the open loop mechanism can be made linear using a pressure feedback bellows on the flapper to create a force balance system with a linear output. The \\"live\\" zero of 0.2 bar or 3 psi is set by the bias spring which ensures that the device is working in its linear region. The industry standard ranges of either 3-15 psi (USA), or 0.2 - 1.0 bar (metric), is normally used in pneumatic PID controllers, valve positioning servomechanisms and force balance transducers.

The nozzle and flapper mechanism made these possible. The nozzle and flapper in pneumatic controls is a simple low maintenance device which operates well in a harsh industrial environment, and does not present an explosion risk in hazardous atmospheres. They were the industry controller amplifier for many decades until the advent of practical and reliable electronic high gain amplifiers. However they are still used extensively for field devices such as control valve positioners, and I to P and P to I converters. A proportional controller schematic is shown here. The set point is transmitted through the flapper plate via the fulcrum to close the orifice and increase the chamber pressure. The feedback bellows resists and the output signal goes to the control valve which opens with increasing actuator pressure. As the flow increases, the process value bellows counteracts the set point bellows until equilibrium is reached. This will be a value below the set point, as there must always be an error to generate an output. The addition of an integral or \\"reset\\" bellows would remove this error.Singh p 488 The principle is also used in hydraulic systems controls.

Such theories are typically obtained by requiring that quantifiers be bounded in the induction axiom or equivalent postulates (a bounded quantifier is of the form ‚àÄx ‚â§ t or ‚àÉx ‚â§ t, where t is a term not containing x). The main purpose is to characterize one or another class of computational complexity in the sense that a function is provably total if and only if it belongs to a given complexity class. Further, theories of bounded arithmetic present uniform counterparts to standard propositional proof systems such as Frege system and are, in particular, useful for constructing polynomial-size proofs in these systems. The characterization of standard complexity classes and correspondence to propositional proof systems allows to interpret theories of bounded arithmetic as formal systems capturing various levels of feasible reasoning (see below). The approach was initiated by Rohit Jivanlal ParikhRohit J. Parikh. Existence and Feasibility in Arithmetic, Jour. Symbolic Logic 36 (1971) 494‚Äì508. in 1971, and later developed by Samuel R. Buss. and a number of other logicians. Theories =Cook's theory PV_1= Stephen Cook introduced an equational theory PV (for Polynomially Verifiable) formalizing feasibly constructive proofs (resp. polynomial-time reasoning). The language of PV consists of function symbols for all polynomial-time algorithms introduced inductively using Cobham's characterization of polynomial-time functions. Axioms and derivations of the theory are introduced simultaneously with the symbols from the language. The theory is equational, i.e. its statements assert only that two terms are equal. A popular extension of PV is a theory PV_1, an ordinary first-order theory. Axioms of PV_1 are universal sentences and contain all equations provable in PV. In addition, PV_1 contains axioms replacing the induction axioms for open formulas. =Buss's theories S^i_2= Samuel Buss introduced first-order theories of bounded arithmetic S^i_2. S^i_2 are first-order theories with equality in the language L=\\\\\\\\{0,S,+,\\\\cdot,\\\\sharp,x,\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{x}{2}\\\\rfloor\\\\\\\\}, where the function x is intended to designate \\\\lceil\\\\log (x+1)\\\\rceil (the number of digits in the binary representation of x) and x\\\\sharp y is 2^{x\\\\cdot y}. (Note that x\\\\sharp x\\\\sim x^2, i.e. \\\\sharp allows to express polynomial bounds in the bit-length of the input.) Bounded quantifiers are expressions of the form \\\\exists x\\\\le t \\\\dots :=\\\\exists x (x\\\\le t\\\\wedge\\\\dots), \\\\forall x\\\\le t \\\\dots :=\\\\forall x (x\\\\le t\\\\rightarrow\\\\dots), where t is a term without an occurrence of x. A bounded quantifier is sharply bounded if t has the form of s for a term s. A formula \\\\phi is sharply bounded if all quantifiers in the formula are sharply bounded. The hierarchy of \\\\Sigma^b_i and \\\\Pi^b_i formulas is defined inductively: \\\\Sigma^b_0=\\\\Pi^b_0 is the set of sharply bounded formulas. \\\\Sigma^b_{i+1} is the closure of \\\\Pi^b_i under bounded existential and sharply bounded universal quantifiers, and \\\\Pi^b_{i+1} is the closure of \\\\Sigma^b_i under bounded universal and sharply bounded existential quantifiers. Bounded formulas capture the polynomial-time hierarchy: for any i\\\\ge 1, the class \\\\Sigma^P_i coincides with the set of natural numbers definable by \\\\Sigma^b_i in \\\\mathbb{N} (the standard model of arithmetic) and dually \\\\Pi^b_i=\\\\Pi^P_i(\\\\mathbb{N}). In particular, NP=\\\\Sigma^b_1(\\\\mathbb{N}). The theory S^i_2 consists of a finite list of open axioms denoted BASIC and the polynomial induction schema :\\\\phi(0)\\\\wedge \\\\forall x\\\\le a (\\\\phi(\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{x}{2} \\\\rfloor)\\\\rightarrow\\\\phi(x) )\\\\rightarrow \\\\phi(a) where \\\\phi\\\\in\\\\Sigma^b_i. Buss's witnessing theorem Buss (1986) proved that \\\\Sigma^b_1 theorems of S^1_2 are witnessed by polynomial-time functions. > Theorem (Buss 1986) Assume that S^1_2\\\\vdash\\\\forall x\\\\exists y \\\\phi(x,y), > with \\\\phi\\\\in\\\\Sigma^b_1. Then, there exists a PV-function symbol f such that > PV\\\\vdash \\\\forall x \\\\phi(x,f(x)). Moreover, S^1_2 can \\\\Sigma^b_1-define all polynomial-time functions. That is, \\\\Sigma^b_1-definable functions in S^1_2 are precisely the functions computable in polynomial time. The characterization can be generalized to higher levels of the polynomial hierarchy. Correspondence to propositional proof systems Theories of bounded arithmetic are often studied in connection to propositional proof systems. Similarly as Turing machines are uniform equivalents of nonuniform models of computation such as Boolean circuits, theories of bounded arithmetic can be seen as uniform equivalents of propositional proof systems. The connection is particularly useful for constructions of short propositional proofs. It is often easier to prove a theorem in a theory of bounded arithmetic and translate the first-order proof into a sequence of short proofs in a propositional proof system than to design short propositional proofs directly in the propositional proof system. The correspondence was introduced by S. Cook. Informally, a \\\\Pi^b_1 statement \\\\forall x \\\\Phi(x) can be equivalently expressed as a sequence of formulas \\\\Phi_n(x):=\\\\forall x (x=n\\\\rightarrow \\\\Phi(x)). Since \\\\Phi_n(x) is a coNP predicate, each \\\\Phi_n(x) can be in turn formulated as a propositional tautology \\\\phi^n (possibly containing new variables needed to encode the computation of the predicate \\\\Phi_n). > Theorem (Cook 1975) Assume that S^1_2\\\\vdash\\\\forall x\\\\Phi(x), where > \\\\Phi\\\\in\\\\Pi^b_1. Then tautologies \\\\phi^n have polynomial-size Extended > Frege proofs. Moreover, the proofs are constructible by a polynomial-time > function and PV proves this fact. Further, S^1_2 proves the so called reflection principle for Extended Frege system, which implies that Extended Frege system is the weakest proof system with the property from the theorem above: each proof system satisfying the implication simulates Extended Frege. An alternative translation between second-order statements and propositional formulas given by Jeff Paris and Alex Wilkie (1985) has been more practical for capturing subsystems of Extended Frege such as Frege or constant-depth Frege.

Located in the vicinity of Chinatown, it is one of the few surviving hills in the city area. Pearl's Hill is well known for once being the site of the former multiple notable institutional buildings such as the Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Seaman's hospital and the Pearl's Hill Prison. The Pearl's Hill Prison is located there because of the close proximity to Sepoy Lines as it was thought to provide protection and security for the prison. History View of Singapore Town from Pearl's Hill circa 1845 The hill was the location of gambier plantations owned by the Chinese who had occupied and settled there before Stamford Raffles' arrival in 1819. Captain James Pearl, the captain of ship Indiana which took Sir Stamford Raffles to Singapore in 1819, liked the look of the hill, and began acquiring plot after plot on the hill from the Chinese gambier planters until he owned the entire hill in May 1822. Pearl had the Chinese and Malay workmen built his house on top of the hill and cleared the slopes to plant pepper vines for him. The hill was briefly named Mount Stamford by Pearl as a compliment to Raffles. When Raffles, having returned from Bencoolen, Sumatra in October 1822, heard how the hill had been acquired without his approval, he ordered its repossession by the British Government. Raffles immediately relented and accorded the ownership of the hill back to Pearl. Captain Pearl, disgruntled by Raffles' actions, renamed the hill after himself. In 1828, Captain Pearl retired back to England and his agents had the hill sold to the British Government for Rs 10,000. His name had remained associated with the hill since then. Pearl's Hill used to be higher than Fort Canning Hill, thus the British colonial engineers decided to have the coolies shave off the top of Pearl's Hill, therefore lowering its peak to ensure their enemies would not be able to use the hill as an attacking position against the newly built Fort Canning.Chris, T.

Location Directional sign Corracloona Court Tomb is located on a slope overlooking the northern tip of Lough MacNean, 3.3 km (2 miles) southeast of Kiltyclogher. History Corracloona Court Tomb was built c. 2000‚Äì1500 BC, in the early Bronze Age. It is locally known as Prince Connell's Grave (Irish: Feart Chonaill Flaith). There are several nobles of this name in Irish legend; the most likely candidate is Conall Gulban, 5th-century founder of the Cen√©l Conaill. However, another legend places Conall Gulban's grave at the dolmen at Fenagh. In any case, both Corracloona and Fenagh monuments are thousands of years older than Conall Gulban. It was first excavated in 1953. Description Prince Connell's Grave is usually described as a court tomb (court cairn), although some see it as a dolmen (portal tomb) or Wedge-shaped gallery grave (wedge tomb). It has a small forecourt (1.5 m wide) and only one burial chamber (2 √ó 3.5 m), with a large slab separating the two. This slab has a large hole in the bottom, called a \\"kennel-hole\\"; this is similar to some tombs in southern France, and may have been used to add additional burials, speak to the dead or leave offerings. However, the hole could be an accidental break.

Encyclopedia.com. 1 Oct. 2016. In ore deposit geology, hypogene processes occur deep below the earth's surface, and tend to form deposits of primary minerals, as opposed to supergene processes that occur at or near the surface, and tend to form secondary minerals. White veins of gypsum (primary/secondary sulfate mineral) near Gunthorpe in Nottinghamshire, England, UK The elemental and mineralogical composition of primary rocks is determined by the chemical composition of the volcanic or magmatic flow from which it is formed. Extrusive rocks (such as basalt, rhyolite, andesite and obsidian) and intrusive rocks (such as granite, granodiorite, gabbro and peridotite) contain primary minerals including quartz, feldspar, plagioclase, muscovite, biotite, amphibole, pyroxene and olivine in varying concentrations. Additionally, primary sulfate minerals occur in igneous rocks. Primary sulfate minerals may occur in veins, these minerals include; Hauynite, noselite, barite, anhydrite, gypsum (primary and secondary mineral), celestite, alunite (primary and secondary mineral), creedite, and thaumasite. Primary minerals can be used to analyze geochemical dispersion halos, and indicator minerals. Furthermore, the most dominant primary minerals in soils are silicate minerals. A variety of silica groups have been discovered, and are controlled by their bonding arrangement, and silica tetrahedron.  Geochemistry  = Geochemical dispersion halos = Primary ore deposits contain primary ores that may develop a geochemical dispersion halo known as primary dispersion expressions. \\"These primary expressions are syndepositional in nature, and thus can occur at or close to the time of ore formation\\". Primary ore expressions may show alteration of the host rocks. These alterations include; siliciÔ¨Åcation, pyritization, sericitization, chloritization, carbonate alteration, tourmalinization, and greisens. = Indicator minerals = Heavy indicator minerals can lead to a good approximation of primary geology and presence of mineral deposits. Primary indicator minerals can be used to identify gold deposits, kimberlites, and massive sulfide deposits. The indicator minerals are further used to track dispersal trains in streams, which may determine location of primary ores/minerals, and their source.  Characteristics  Minerals in soils are found as two types; primary and secondary. \\"A primary mineral has not been altered chemically since its crystallization from a cooling magma.\\" Additionally, a primary mineral is defined as a mineral that is found in soil but not formed in soil, whereas secondary minerals are formed during weathering of Elbaite (tourmaline) from Minas Gerais, Brazil primary minerals. The latter is further defined by Dr. Broome of North Carolina State: The particle size of primary minerals is primarily larger than 2Œºm, which includes; silt, sand, and gravel. The most dominant primary minerals in soil are the silicate minerals. Silicate minerals consist of more than 90% of the minerals in the Earth's crust. There are six silica mineral groups, based on bonding arrangement, and silica tetrahedron. The silica groups include: nesosilicates, sorosilicates, cyclosilicates, inosilicates, phyllosilicates, and tectosilicates. Tectosilicates such as quartz, and cristobalite are common in soils. Phyllosilicates are known as the sheet silicates, and include muscovite, biotite, and clay minerals. Cyclosilicates are known as ring silicates, and include tourmaline. Inosilicates are known as single/double chain silicates, and include amphiboles, and pyroxenes. Sorosilicates contain double silica tetrahedra, such as vesuvianite. Nesosilicates have one silica tetrahedra, such as olivine. The earth's crust and soils are dominated by silicic acid in combination with Na, Al, K, Ca, Fe and O ions. The following elements are components of primary minerals, whereas primary minerals are components of parent rocks. Primary rocks are the source of primary minerals and primary water. For the classical discussions of the origin of primary ores, see the two publications \\"Ore Deposits\\" (1903 and 1913).Rickard, T.F.; Ore Deposits: Engineering and Mining Journal, 1903; and Emmons, S.F.; Ore Deposits: A. I. M. E., 1913: pp. 837-846. According to W.A. Tarr (1938) the primary mineral deposits are the result of direct magmatic action; he states that the splitting of magmas results in the basic igneous rocks and their accompanying group of accessory minerals formed by the first crystallization in the magma, on the one hand, and in the acidic igneous rocks and a second group of accessory minerals which were formed by deposition from the residual mother liquors.Tarr, W.A.; 1938: Introductory Economic Geology; McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc., p. 31.  Beneficiation of primary ores  Leaching of primary sulfate minerals occurs through the process of bioleaching for the separation of primary sulfide ores. Primary ores are also extracted through dense media separation (DMS), which is a technique that involves the removal of gangue through the variation of specific gravity within particles. The dense minerals (high specific gravity) containing primary ores sink, and the lighter gangue minerals float to the surface. DMS plants have been widely used for different mining applications, such as the beneficiation of lithium bearing ores from pegmatites, like the main lithium-bearing mineral known as spodumene. Another method of beneficiation is through magnetic separation. Magnetic separation involves the separation of iron-bearing gangue, such as hematite. Hematite cannot be used in the iron and steel industry without beneficiation. Roasting of primary low grade ores, such as siderite and hematite occurs further forming magnetite. Once the conversion of iron-oxides occurs, magnetic separation may proceed to extract magnetic ores. Additionally, another beneficiation technique used for primary ores is froth flotation. Froth flotation is used after roasting of primary ores, where the magnetite (or other primary ore) is further separated forming a concentrate.

Born 4 June 1418 to Richard Scrope, 3rd Baron Scrope of Bolton and Margaret Neville, he was still a minor when his father died in 1420. As such, his lands and marriageability were in the keeping of his uncle Sir Richard Neville until the young Scrope was 21. He appears to have remained living with his mother, who undertook not to marry him off (being held to a ¬£1,000 bond not to do so).Cokayne, G.E., The complete peerage of England and Wales (Vol. XI, London, 1949), 543. His inheritance was the subject of a brief feud between Richard Neville and Marmaduke Lumley, later Bishop of Carlisle, who had been patronised by Richard Scrope.Storey, R.L, 'Marmaduke Lumley, bishop of Carlisle, 1430-1450', Transactions of the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society, 2nd ser. 55 (1955), 115.

Henry Scrope received seisin of his estates on 2 February 1439, and two years later he was summoned to parliament as a knight. Political and administrative career Much of his career was concerned with administering the royal will in Yorkshire, which was undoubtedly a source of income for him. For example, in the 1440s, the City of York offered him gifts to gain his \\"friendship\\".Griffiths, R.A., 'Local Rivalries and National Politics- The Percies, the Nevilles, and the Duke of Exeter, 1452-55', Speculum, 4 (1968), 595.

He was even on the Commission of Oyer and terminer in 1453, appointed by the Crown to investigate the violent Percy-Neville feud; this, as historian Ralph A. Griffiths has pointed out, was while he was actually involved in the feud, standing with Salisbury's sons against the House of Percy at the confrontation at Topcliffe, for example.Griffiths, R.A., 'Local Rivalries and National Politics- The Percies, the Nevilles, and the Duke of Exeter, 1452-55', Speculum, 4 (1968), 595, 605.

The history of the movement in Syria begins in the 1920s, when the second caliph of the Community, Mirza Basheer- ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad visited Damascus, as part of his tour of Europe and the Middle East. From Palestine, he traveled to Damascus by train where he is reported to have attracted publicity as well as some opposition. He discussed the claims of the founder of the Community, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, with leading scholars, and other intellectual figures from Damascus. Late 1920s, Damascus: Early Syrian converts to the Ahmadiyya movement. Seated at the center is Jala- ud-Din Shams. Following his journey to the Middle East, the caliph appointed Sayyid Zayn al'Abidin Waliullah Shah and Jalal al-Din Shams to be sent for a mission in Damascus. Arriving in 1925, the two missionaries, who were also companions of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, were amongst the first missionaries dispatched to the Middle East. Along with Maulvi Abu'l-'Ata Jalandhari, who arrived for a mission in Jerusalem, the three missionaries spent their time spreading Ahmadi teachings in major towns and cities across the Middle East, including Haifa, Beirut and Cairo. Shah himself was able to obtain a position of lectureship at the \\"Sultania College\\" in Damascus for period of time before his return to Qadian, the then international headquarters of the Ahmadiyya movement. Following his return, Shams was left alone in Damascus at the instruction of the caliph. Opposition to Shams' efforts began to surface soon after Shah's return. While he was refused services at local stores, local newspapers expressed their resentment through the publications of satirical cartoons that mocked his efforts. By 1927, he was stabbed by a local resident in Damascus. In order to maintain public order, the reigning French authorities desired for him to leave Syria. However, following the instructions of the caliph and against his own wishes, Shams continued to stay in Syria, until as a recourse, the French authorities decided to expel Shams themselves in January 1928. With Shams departure ended the Ahmadiyya missionary efforts in Syria for a number of decades.

CSX's A Line north of Jacksonville (which leads to the Nahunta Subdivision) was originally part of the East Florida Railway. The A Line south of Jacksonville (which leads to the Sanford Subdivision) was part of the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway. Both lines became part of the Plant System and later the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. The S Line from Jacksonville west to Baldwin Junction was part of the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad, which became part of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad. With a large number of railroads operating in Jacksonville, the Jacksonville Terminal Company was chartered in 1894 to coordinate train movement of multiple railroads in the area, manage yards, and build Jacksonville Union Terminal, which opened in 1919. By 1902, the Jacksonville Terminal Company was jointly owned by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, Seaboard Air Line Railroad, Florida East Coast Railway, and the Southern Railway. In 1967, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and Seaboard Air Line Railroad merged to form the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad, which became CSX Transportation in 1986.

Born in Haslingden, Wilkinson became a cotton weaver in 1864. He was a founder member of the Haslingden Weavers' Association, and was appointed as its general secretary in 1879. At the time, the Blackburn Weavers' Association were on strike, opposing wage reductions of 10%. Realising that, if the Blackburn Weavers lost, the cuts would be likely to be applied in Haslingden too, Wilkinson raised large sums - around ¬£140 per week - to support the Blackburn Weavers. Thanks to this, the strike was won, and Wilkinson came to prominence in textile trade unionism.\\"Memorial notices: Mr W. H. Wilkinson\\", Manchester Guardian, 26 April 1906 The secretaryship was a part-time post, and Wilkinson continued to work as a weaver and, occasionally, as an overlooker, until 1880 when he became clerk of the North East Lancashire Amalgamated Weavers' Association. Its secretary, Thomas Birtwistle, founded the broader Northern Counties Amalgamated Association of Weavers, and in 1885, Wilkinson became secretary of this Second Amalgamation. Wilkinson undertook various other roles, including membership of the executive of the Labour Representation Committee, and serving as secretary of the International Association of Textile Workers. He continued as secretary of the Haslingden Weavers until 1904. His health then worsened, and he stood down from the International Association at its conference in 1906, then took leave of absence from his remaining posts, dying soon after.

In Yulee, the line connects with the First Coast Railroad, which operates north to Seals, Georgia, on tracks that were previously part of the Kingsland Subdivision prior to 2005 (First Coast also operates from Yulee northeast to Fernandina Beach on tracks that were previously the Fernandina Subdivision).CSX Kingsland SubCSX Jacksonville Division Timetable History From Jacksonville to Panama Park, the line was originally the easternmost segment of the Jacksonville and Southwestern Railroad which was built in 1899. In 1904, the Jacksonville and Southwestern Railroad became part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, which would merge with the Seaboard Air Line Railroad in 1967. From Panama Park north, the line was built by the Fernandina and Jacksonville Railroad, which was organized in 1874 and opened in 1881. The Fernandina and Jacksonville Railroad would later become part of the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad (FC&P;).

In 1900, the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad became part of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, and the line became Seaboard's main line. Seaboard Air Line became the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad after merging with the Atlantic Coast Line in 1967. The merged company became the CSX Corporation in the 1980s.

At its north end it continues south from the Savannah Subdivision and at its south end it continues south as the Jacksonville Terminal Subdivision A-Line. The line is double-tracked from Folkston, Georgia south. All of Amtrak's Florida service also traverses the line. The segment of the line from Folkston to Callahan, Florida, is sometimes informally known as the Folkston Funnel by rail enthusiasts since nearly all of CSX's traffic from the midwest and the northeast to Florida converge on that segment, which carries roughly 40‚Äì45 trains a day. The Folkston Railfan Platform was built in 2001 by the city for viewing trains. History The segment of the Nahunta Subdivision north of Jesup, Georgia, was originally part of the Atlantic and Gulf Railroad, which was chartered in 1856 (five years before the start of the American Civil War). The Atlantic and Gulf Railroad went bankrupt in 1877 and was bought by Henry B. Plant two years later. Plant incorporated it into his Savannah, Florida, and Western Railway (the main line of the Plant System). From Folkston, Georgia, south to Jacksonville, Florida, the line was part of the Waycross and Florida Railway and the East Florida Railway. Those two lines, which were chartered by Henry Plant in 1880, began service in 1881. The middle segment of the Nahunta Subdivision was built as the Plant System's Folkston Cutoff in 1901. It was built to provide a shortcut and bypass to Waycross, Georgia. In 1902, the Plant System became part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, with what is now the Nahunta Subdivision becoming part of the Coast Line's main line. Though Atlantic Coast Line became part of CSX Transportation through various mergers from 1967 to 1986.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from the Caucasus mountains of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. It has sickle shaped leaves, which are as long as the short stem, which carries one flower in spring. It is beige, pink or brown covered in dark lines that are, purple-brown or brown. It has a large blackish brown signal patch and brown or black beard. It is rarely cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions, as it needs very dry conditions during the summer. Description It is classed as an mezo-xerophyte. Meaning they like intermediate dry conditions.R. W. McColl It has a slender rhizome, which is about 1.5 cm to 2 cm wide. They can form creeping plants. The leaves are narrow and falcate (sickle-shaped), they can be between 2 cm and 3 cm wide, and can grow as long as the stem. They can often be distorted. It has a short stem or peduncle, that can grow up to between tall. The stem has a green, lanceolate, spathes (leaves of the flower bud), and a 1 cm long pedicel holding a single flower. The flower, blooms in spring, between April and June. The flower is in diameter, and have a beige background, covered with dark lines, in purple-brown, pink background lined with purple, brown background or wine-red background lined purple-brown. Bi-toned forms can also be found. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The orbicular (rounded) falls, are long and 1.5‚Äì2 cm wide. In the middle of the falls, is a large blackish-brown, black, or brown signal patch. The oblong or oval, standards are larger than falls, they are long and 2‚Äì3 cm wide. Also coming down the falls is a row of short hairs called the 'beard', which is black, or brown. After the iris has flowered, between June to July, it produces a seed capsule. Then the plant dies back to the rhizome, to re- grow next year, similar to a bulb habit. =Biochemistry= As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosome count: 2n=20, it was counted in 1977, (published in 1980), by Avishai & Zohary. Taxonomy It is occasionally misspelt with one 'i' at the end, and as Iris grossheimiana (mainly in Russia). or as Grossgeim iris. The Latin specific epithet grossheimii refers to Alexander Grossheim (1888‚Äì1948, who was a Ukrainian botanist). It was first described by Yury Nikolaevich Voronov (or Woronow) and then published by Alexander Grossheim in Fl. Kavkaza (Flora of the Caucasus) Vol.1 on page 255 in 1928. It is thought to be a hybrid cross between Iris lineolata and Iria lycotis.British Iris Society (1997) 'Iris grossheimii' is listed in the Catalogue of Life, and it was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, then changed on 11 December 2014. Distribution and habitat It is native to temperate Asia. =Range= It is an endemic of the Caucasus, found in Transcaucasia, which includes Georgia, Armenia, (within the Zangezur Mountains, and Meghri mountain ranges,) and Azerbaijan. including the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, and Mount Soyukh, near Ordubad.J. Mennema =Habitat= It grows on the mountains, from middle to sub‚Äìalpine belt, on rocky slopes, or in open meadows near oak and juniper forests. They can be found at an altitude of above sea level. Conservation It is listed as a rare and endangered species in Georgia similar to Iris iberica, Iris lycotis, Iris camillae and Iris elegantissima (other Oncocyclus Irises). In Armenia, it is rare. In 1984, the Red Data Book of the former USSR listed 61 species of plants as rare and under threat of extinction, including the iris. Later, in 1988, the Armenian Red Data Book was published with the iris still listed as endangered. It is not included in the Annexes of CITES or that of the Bern Convention. It is threatened due to habitat changes, including loss or degradation caused by the mining industry or grazing. Fortunately, a part of the iris population is located within Arevik National Park, which allows continual monitoring and protection. Cultivation In general, Oncocyclus Irises need minimal summer rainfall and dry winters. In temperate areas (such as the Europe and America) they are only suitable for growing by specialist iris growers, within a bulb frame or greenhouse. Although, I grossheimii prefers very dry conditions during the summer, similar to a desert. =Propagation= Irises can generally be propagated by division, or by seed growing. Irises generally require a period of cold, then a period of warmth and heat, also they need some moisture. Some seeds need stratification, (the cold treatment), which can be carried out indoors or outdoors. Seedlings are generally potted on (or transplanted) when they have 3 leaves. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), and if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also, handling the plant may cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske References Sources * Czerepanov, S. K.

It's likely that an accidental spark ignited gas in the air, which directly killed seven men and knocked out a ventilation fan. Without the fan, levels of blackdamp rose in the mine. Another 121 miners suffocated. About 40 other workers were able to dig their way through rubble and escape.

Robinson is an American writer, psychotherapist, and professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte currently living in Asheville, NC. He is a graduate of East Carolina University and the University of North Carolina system and author of two novels and over 35 nonfiction books and Professor of Counseling and Child Development at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte for 25 years... At UNC-Charlotte, he conducted the first research studies on children of workaholics and the effects of workaholism on marriage and the family. Robinson is best known for his book, Chained to the Desk: A Guidebook for Workaholics, Their Partners and Children and the Clinicians Who Treat Them (2014, its third edition). He is noted for his identification of two axes for workaholics: work initiation and work completion. He associates the behavior of procrastination with both \\"Savoring Workaholics\\" (those with low work initiation/low work completion) and \\"Attention-Deficit Workaholics\\" (those with high work initiation and low work completion), in contrast to \\"Bulimic\\" and \\"Relentless\\" workaholics - both of whom have high work completion. He is widely recognized as being one of the world's leading experts on workaholism. He is also known for developing the Work Addiction Risk Test (WART) a psychometric tool used to measure work addiction used clinically and in research worldwide to identify workaholism. He has lectured on his pioneering research on workaholism and work/life balance across the United States and throughout the world: Sweden, Russia, Norway, Hong Kong, England, Canada, and Australia, and his books have been translated into thirteen languages: Arabic, Korean, Turkish, Hebrew, German, French, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Japanese, and Russian.  Work  Robinson's early work included his publications on men in day care, teenage dads, and gay fathers. His interests turned to the field of addiction and recovery. When he realized there was no information on workaholism especially as it related to the family, Robinson and his research team launched a series of studies, the first of their kind, to examine the influence of work addiction on family functioning and to develop an empirical instrument to measure work addiction  Awards  In 1989, during his tenure as Professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Robinson won the First Citizens Scholars Medal given annually to faculty for outstanding scholarship and a distinguished record in research. In 1998 Robinson's research on workaholism and the family was recognized by the American Counseling Association which honored him with the ACA Extended Research Award for conducting high-quality research over an extended period of time in areas of concern and interest to the counseling profession. Among his other honors are several literary awards for his Southern noir debut novel, Limestone Gumption: A Brad Pope and Sisterfriends Mystery: The New Apple Book Medal for psychological suspense, the Silver IPPY Award for outstanding mystery of the year; the USA Regional Excellence Book Award for best fiction in the Southeast; and the Bronze Foreword Review Book Award for best mystery  Bibliography  = Nonfiction (Books) = * Latchkey Kids: Unlocking Doors for Children and Their Families.

Murder and first trial On May 11, 1978, 28 year old Lawrence Lionberg (who was working a night shift at a Homewood, Illinois gas station) and his 23 year old fianc√© Carol Schmal were kidnapped. Schmal was raped several times and both were shot in the back of the head. There was a public outcry at the brutal murder. The four suspects were tried in 1978. A witness, Charles McCraney, claimed to have seen Williams, Rainge and Adams near the crime scene area in Ford Heights (at the time called East Chicago Heights) at the time of the crime. A state expert witness, Michael Podlecki, said that at least one of the rapists was type A secretor blood (shared by 25% of the population) and Williams and Adams had Type A secretor blood (an independent forensic witness found in 1987 that Williams and Adams actually had non-secretor blood). Podlecki also claimed that hairs from the back of Williams car were consistent with Lionberg and Schmal. No other physical evidence matched the suspects to the crime. A convict, David Jackson, testified that he had overheard Williams and Rainge in jail discussing the murder and rape (Jackson later admitted he had fabricated this evidence because he was offered a deal by the authorities). The prosecution eliminated all black jurors from the trial (the defendants were all black and the murder victims were white). The police did not inform the defense that a witness, Marvin Simpson, heard shots and identified four men running from the murder scene - Arthur Robinson, Juan Rodriguez, Ira and Dennis Johnson (these four were later found to be the real killers). Family members of the Ford Four testified they were elsewhere at the time of the murder. The defendants' lawyer, Archie B. Weston, was ineffective, and was the subject of a legal disciplinary hearing at the time and was later disbarred from being a lawyer for another offense. A witness, Paula Gray, (with an IQ of 55), testified to prosecutors that she had seen the defendants shoot the victims and rape Schmal. However, she withdrew her evidence before the court case and prosecutors charged her with murder and perjury. Williams was sentenced to death, while Adams was sentenced to 75 years, Rainge to life, and Paula Gray to 50 years in 1978. Jimerson could not be charged as McCraney had not mentioned Jimerson in his testimony and Paula Gray had withdrawn her testimony.  Appeals and further trials  On appeal, the Illinois supreme court reversed the convictions of Williams and Rainge in 1982 because the defendants lawyer was incompetent and was the subject of a legal disciplinary hearing. Prosecutors offered Paula Gray a deal to get out of jail if she testified she had seen Jimerson, Williams and Rainge shoot the victims and rape Schmal and she accepted. In 1985 McCraney had changed his evidence to include seeing Jimerson who was sentenced to death. In 1987 Williams was sentenced to death and Rainge to life at a retrial. Paula Gray was released from prison in 1987. Exoneration Three female students (including Laura Sullivan who is now an award-winning investigative correspondent for NPR) working under Professor David Protess of the Northwestern University Medill School of Journalism investigated this case and found the Marvin Simpson witness statement testifying to seeing Robinson, Rodriguez, Ira and Dennis Johnson fleeing from the murder scene. Jackson and Paula Gray recanted their evidence. The students also got DNA tests done which showed Jimerson, Williams, Adams and Rainge were innocent and, eventually, that Robinson, Rodriguez, Ira and Dennis Johnson were guilty and three of them confessed (Dennis Johnson had died by then) and Robinson, Rodriguez and Ira were convicted. The Ford Heights Four were exonerated and freed in 1996. Robinson, Johnson and Rodriguez were sentenced to life in prison.https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct- xpm-1997-07-23-9707230047-story.htmlhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct- xpm-1997-07-23-9707230047-story.htmlhttps://www.nwitimes.com/uncategorized/rodriguez- gets-life-in-ford-heights- double/article_dbcae20c-8129-562c-9eb4-faa8a4f726bf.html The Ford Heights Four received $36 million in 1999 in civil rights damages from Cook County - the largest settlement in US history at the time.

Through the middle of Savannah, the Savannah Subdivision splits into an east route and a west route. The East Route runs from Savannah, Georgia, to Ogeechee, Georgia, for a total of 15.6 miles. At its north end it continues south from the Charleston Subdivision and the Columbia Subdivision both of the Florence Division and at its south end it continues south as the Nahunta Subdivision. The West Route is located in Savannah, Georgia, and is 9.7 miles in length. At its north end it branches off of the Savannah Subdivision East Route and at its south end it comes back into the Savannah Subdivision East Route. History The East Route runs along CSX's A Line (which was the main route of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, one of CSX's predecessor companies). The West Route runs along what remains of CSX's S Line (which was the main route of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, another CSX predecessor company) The A Line north of Savannah was originally chartered in 1854 by the Charleston and Savannah Railroad (later known as the Charleston and Savannah Railway). South of Savannah, it was originally the Atlantic and Gulf Railroad, which was chartered in 1856. Both lines came under the ownership of Henry B. Plant in the 1880s. The Plant System would then be bought by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1902. The S Line north of Savannah was originally built as the South Bound Railroad in 1891. South of Savannah, the line was a northern extension of the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad built in 1894. The FC&P; leased the South Bound Railroad and eventually acquired it. The FC&P; became part of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad in 1903. The Atlantic Coast Line and Seaboard Air Line merged in 1967, with the merged company becoming CSX by 1986. The merger led to consolidation of the two lines and the abandonment of some of the S Line in Savannah. This includes the segment from Savannah south to Ogeechee which originally ran right beside the Atlantic Coast Line route (the current route). Remnants of the Seaboard's bridge over the Ogeechee River remain next to the current bridge.

Despite of this constitutional protection, the Nigerian media was controlled by the government throughout its much of its history, with some even to this day. By 2020, however, over 100 newspapers in Nigeria were independent. Furthermore, there was a brief moment from 1979 to 1983 when the government of the Second Nigerian Republic handed over the task of censorship to the military. Nigerian censors typically target certain kinds of idea, such as ethnic discussion, political opposition, and morality incorrectness.  Press censorship  From 1859 to 1960, the Nigerian press was privately owned. However, this did not guarantee the freedom of speech since the majority of newspaper proprietors were actively involved in politics. Therefore, these newspapers typically acted as advocates of their owner's political interest. In addition, the pressure coming from ethnic groups was also a contributing factor to self-censorship among news organizations. News that expose certain ‚Äúundesirable‚Äù aspects of a tribe may suffer a boycott or in some cases, causing ethnic tension. An example of this kind of ethnic tension happened in 1957, when an Igbo press, the West African Pilot provided news with clear bias against a Yoruban political group called Egbe Omo Oduduwa. The Yorubas responded by launching their own news outlet called the Daily Service in order to retaliate and making correction to those statements. From then on, in order to avoid conflicts, each news organization catered their message accordingly to the desire of the local leaders. For example, the Tribune tend to be more considerate when mentioning issues related to the Yorubas while the New Nigerians, which is based in Kaduna, must carefully vetted the northern opinion on national matters. The Yorubas, as an ethnic group, have the most influence over the news since they occupy most media-rich territories in the country, including the capital city, Lagos. Today, newspapers continue to represent the interests of distinct ethnic groups. In 1961, the government started an operation to gain control of the press. It began with the seizure of the Morning Post's headquarter, a very prominent and important news outlet in Lagos. The government then control it so tightly that the paper eventually went on the decline and shut down in 1972. After the demise of the Morning Post, other newspapers followed suit as the government slowly expanded its influence over the press. Although many news organization did go out of business as a result of being manipulated by the government, others, such as the Daily Times of Nigeria, survived and continue to operate to this day despite of being controlled by the government since 1977. In 1999, freedom of expression became protected by the new Nigerian Constitution.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266341565_Right_to_Freedom_of_Expression_and_the_Law_of_Defamation_in_Nigeria However, defamation laws were afterwards passed. Critics maintain that though measures of freedom of the press have improved, there is still room for improvement. Nigeria was described as \\"partly free\\" in the Freedom of the Press 2011 report published by the Freedom House (see yearly rankings in Freedom House ratings in Nigeria section).\\"2011 Human Rights Reports: Nigeria\\". Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. Department of State. 24 May 2012. On April 26 2020, the Reporter without Borders World Press Freedom Index ranked Nigeria 115 out of 180 countries surveys.http://saharareporters.com/2020/04/26/nigeria- ranked-115-out-180-press-freedom-index Reporters without Borders cited killing, detention and brutalisation of journalists alongside targeted attempts to shrink the civic space by the Nigerian Government as reason for the ranking. However, this rank is higher than the 146 rank which Transparency International gave Nigeria earlier in the year with regards to corruption.https://www.channelstv.com/2020/01/23/transparency-international- scores-nigeria-low-on-corruption-perception- index/https://www.pulse.ng/news/local/buhari-what-statistics-say-about- presidents-anti-corruption-war/bh2br7v The Reporters without Borders report further stated ‚ÄúWith more than 100 independent newspapers, Africa‚Äôs most populous nation enjoys real media pluralism but covering stories involving politics, terrorism or financial embezzlement by the powerful is very problematic.\\"  Military censorship  In 1983, the power of the Second Republic was challenged due to accusations of vote rigging and electoral malfeasance. As a result, the newly elected government decided to leave the military with the task of censorship. At the hand of the military, however, writers felt a certain level of immunity from persecution, especially when it was known that ‚Äúgenerals don‚Äôt read novels‚Äù. On one occasion, a student named Oherei was arrested and accused of being a communist sympathizer when he published a novel called ‚ÄúBehind the Iron Curtain‚Äù. He was then acquitted two days after the arrest. When the Second Republic was overthrown on December 31, 1983, the task of censorship was once again given back to the federal government. However, as of 2013, military censorship was still applicable to information regarding military strategy and confidential materials for security purposes.  Electronic media and entertainment censorship  In 1978, the government created the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), which was responsible for censoring electronic media, such as radio, television, and DVD. Electronic media was predominantly privately owned, but the government was able to influence content through the NAN. In June 1994, the National Film and Video Censors Board replaces the NAN as the official schedule agency of the government. It is responsible for licensing film makers and reviewing their works accordingly to the following criteria: educational and entertainment value; national security sensitivity; avoidance of blasphemy, obscenity, and criminality; avoidance of provoking religious and racial confrontation; abstention from violence and corruption; and abstention from disrespecting African personalities. The National Film and Video Censors Board banned the film I Hate My Village due to the presence of cannibalism in it. In 2002, the board banned the following films: Omo Empire, Outcast 1 and 2, Shattered Home and Night Out (Girls for Sale) because they have damaged ‚Äúevery known decent and noble tendency of the African psyche and culture‚Äù by portraying obscene acts among young women in certain cuts of the film.

According to the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions, few countries have provided for the legal recognition of intersex people. The Asia Pacific Forum states that the legal recognition of intersex people is firstly about access to the same rights as other men and women, when assigned male or female; secondly it is about access to administrative corrections to legal documents when an original sex assignment is not appropriate; and thirdly it is not about the creation of a third sex or gender classification for intersex people as a population but it is, instead, about self determination. The Asia Pacific Forum, the Council of Europe, and the Malta declaration of the Third International Intersex Forum have called for non-binary gender classifications to be available on a voluntary, opt-in basis. The Council of Europe has called for greater consideration of the implications of new sex classifications on intersex people, while the Third International Intersex Forum called for the long term removal of sex or gender from official identification documents. In some countries, legal recognition may be limited, access to any form of birth certificate may be difficult, while some other countries recognise that intersex people may have non-binary gender identities. Sociological research in Australia, a country with a non- binary gender marker, has shown that 19% of people born with atypical sex characteristics may prefer that option. History Edward Coke, The First Part of the Institutes of the Lawes of England (1st ed, 1628, title page) - 20131124 In European societies, Roman law, post-classical Canon law, and later Common law, referred to a person's sex as male, female or hermaphrodite, with legal rights as male or female depending on the characteristics that appeared most dominant. Under Roman law, a hermaphrodite had to be classed as either male or female.Lynn E. Roller, \\"The Ideology of the Eunuch Priest,\\" Gender & History 9.3 (1997), p. 558. The 12th-century Decretum Gratiani states that \\"Whether an hermaphrodite may witness a testament, depends on which sex prevails\\".Decretum Gratiani, C. 4, q. 2 et 3, c. 3 The foundation of common law, the 16th Century Institutes of the Lawes of England described how a hermaphrodite could inherit \\"either as male or female, according to that kind of sexe which doth prevaile.\\"E Coke, The First Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England, Institutes 8.a. (1st Am. Ed. 1812) (16th European ed. 1812). Single cases have been described in Canon law and other legal cases over the centuries. Intersex scholar Morgan Holmes states that much early anthropological material on non-European cultures described gender systems with more than two categories as \\"primitive\\", but also that subsequent analysis of third sexes and genders is simplistic or romanticized: In recent years, civil society organization and human rights institutions have raised issues relating to legal recognition.  Intersex rights  Research indicates a growing consensus that diverse intersex bodies are normal‚Äîif relatively rare‚Äîforms of human biology, and human rights institutions are placing increasing scrutiny on medical practices and issues of discrimination against intersex people. A 2013 first international pilot study. Human Rights between the Sexes, by Dan Christian Ghattas, found that intersex people are discriminated against worldwide: \\"Intersex individuals are considered individuals with a ¬´disorder¬ª in all areas in which Western medicine prevails. They are more or less obviously treated as sick or ¬´abnormal¬ª, depending on the respective society.\\" In 2015, an Issue Paper on Human rights and intersex people by the Council of Europe highlighted several areas of concern, including legal recognition: * Equal right to life and prevention of medical treatments without informed consent including treatments considered unnecessary; * Removal of Intersex as a curable medical condition but one which can have medical treatments with informed consent; * Equal treatment under the law; including specific legal provisions similar to other classes covered; * Access to information, medical records, peer and other counselling and support; * Self-determination in gender recognition, through expeditious access to official documents.  Legal recognition  According to the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions, few countries have provided for the legal recognition of intersex people. The Asia Pacific Forum states that the legal recognition of intersex people is firstly about access to the same rights as other men and women, when assigned male or female; secondly it is about access to administrative corrections to legal documents when an original sex assignment is not appropriate; and thirdly, while opt in schemes may help some individuals, legal recognition is not about the creation of a third sex or gender classification for intersex people as a population. = Gender identities = Like all individuals, some intersex individuals may be raised as a particular sex (male or female) but then identify with another later in life, while most do not. A 2012 clinical review suggests that between 8.5-20% of persons with intersex conditions may experience gender dysphoria, distress or discomfort as a result of the sex and gender they were assigned at birth. Like non-intersex people, some intersex individuals may not identify themselves as either exclusively female or exclusively male. Sociological research in Australia, a country with a third 'X' sex classification, shows that 19% of people born with atypical sex characteristics selected an \\"X\\" or \\"other\\" option, while 52% are women, 23% men, and 6% unsure. At birth, 52% of persons in the study were assigned female, and 41% were assigned male. Research has also shown gender identities of intersex individuals to be independent of sexual orientation. Intersex advocate Morgan Carpenter states that intersex should not be reduced to a gender identity issue; \\"intersex as identity is polymorphic, but asserts the dignity of stigmatised embodiment.\\" Dan Christian Ghattas states that \\"People who do not have an intersex body and want to use ‚Äòintersex‚Äô to describe their gender identity, should be aware of the fact that, unfortunately, they are actually making intersex human rights violations less visible.\\" = Access to identification documents = Currently, depending on the jurisdiction, access to any birth certificate may be an issue, including a birth certificate with a sex marker, and in the absence of surgical requirements. In 2014 a Kenyan court ordered its government to issue a birth certificate to a five-year-old child born with ambiguous genitalia, necessary to allow the child to attend school and obtain a national identity document. Many intersex persons in Uganda are understood to be stateless due to historical difficulties in obtaining identification documents, despite a birth registration law that permits intersex minors to change assignment. A 2017 submission by Justicia Intersex and Zwischengeschlecht to the United Nations Committee Against Torture identified two Argentinian cases of children denied birth certificates without parental consent to irreversible medical interventions. = Access to the same rights as other men and women = The Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions states that: Accessing the same rights as other men and women supposes the elimination of stigma and discrimination on grounds of sex characteristics, and rights to physical integrity and freedom from torture and ill-treatment. The Asia Pacific Forum also highlights access to sport and concerns with sex verification policies. Sex testing began at the 1966 European Athletics Championships in response to suspicion that several of the best women athletes from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe were actually men.R. Peel, \\"Eve‚Äôs Rib - Searching for the Biological Roots of Sex Differences\\", Crown Publishers, New York City, 1994, At the Olympics, testing was introduced in 1968. Initially, sex verification took the form of physical examinations. It subsequently evolved into chromosome testing, and later testosterone testing. Reports have shown how elite women athletes with intersex conditions have been humiliated, excluded, and suffered human rights violations as a result of sex verification testing. Such cases have included female genital mutilation and sterilization. = Changing identification documents = Access to a birth certificate with a correct sex marker may be an issue for intersex people who do not identify with their sex assigned at birth. Some countries have the gender self-determination legal model such as Argentina, Belgium, Malta, Denmark, Greece, France, Portugal, Norway, Chile, Uruguay, Luxembourg, Colombia, Ecuador, Iceland, and Ireland permit changes to sex classifications via simple administrative methods. Some countries, such as Vietnam, Thailand, Japan, some jurisdictions in both Australia and the United States and many European countries only permit changes to sex classifications following sexual reassignment surgery. Other countries do not permit intersex people to change sex assignment at all or, such as the United Kingdom, only by declaring that they are transgender and obtaining a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. = Third sex or gender classifications = thumbright452px The passports and identification documents of Australia, New Zealand and some other nationalities have adopted \\"X\\" as a valid third category besides \\"M\\" (male) and \\"F\\" (female), at least since 2003. US states have recognised third options since at least 2012, in the case of an 'hermaphrodite' birth certificate sex marker in Ohio. In 2013, Germany became the first European nation to register babies with characteristics of both sexes as indeterminate gender on birth certificates, amidst opposition and skepticism from intersex organisations who point out that the law mandates exclusion from male or female categories. US organization Intersex Campaign for Equality is pursuing third sex classifications for non-binary intersex people, including through a federal court case. On November 22, 2016, the United States District Court for the District of Colorado ruled in favor of Navy veteran Dana Zzyym, associate director of Intersex Campaign for Equality, stating that the State Department violated federal law in denying Zzyym a passport because they did not select male or female as their gender. On September 26, 2016, intersex California resident Sara Kelly Keenan became the second person in the United States to legally change her gender to non-binary. In December 2016, Keenan received a birth certificate with an 'Intersex' sex marker from New York City. Press coverage also disclosed that Ohio issued a birth certificate with a sex marker of 'hermaphrodite' in 2012. The intersex movement supports voluntary and opt- in non-binary and multiple sex classifications, described in the statement of the Third International Intersex Forum. The Open Society Foundations published a report, License to Be Yourself in May 2014, documenting \\"some of the world's most progressive and rights-based laws and policies\\" enabling changes to gender markers on official documents. The report comments on the recognition of third classifications, stating: The Council of Europe acknowledged concerns about recognition of third and blank classifications in a 2015 Issue Paper, stating that these may lead to \\"forced outings\\" and \\"lead to an increase in pressure on parents of intersex children to decide in favour of one sex.\\" The Issue Paper argues that \\"further reflection on non-binary legal identification is necessary\\": The Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions recognised the right of individuals to non-binary or third sex classifications, but stated that, \\"creating a third, separate category for the registration of people born with an intersex trait ... would risk segregating and potentially stigmatising intersex people. It would also remove their right to determine their own sex or gender.\\" In March 2017, an Australian and Aotearoa/New Zealand community statement called for an end to legal classification of sex, stating that legal third classifications, like binary classifications, were based on structural violence and failed to respect diversity and a \\"right to self-determination\\". = Ending official classification by sex or gender = The statement of the Third International Intersex Forum calls for an end to official classification by sex or gender on identification documents. Dan Christian Ghattas of OII Europe states that, \\"providing the options for all parents to leave the sex/ gender entry open for their child would promote the equality of all sexes and genders\\". Laura Inter of Mexican intersex organization Br√∫jula Intersexual, imagines a society where sex or gender classifications are removed from birth certificates and other official identification documents, and Morgan Carpenter of OII Australia states that, \\"the removal of sex and gender, like race and religion, from official documentation\\" is \\"a more universal, long-term policy goal\\".

The Tampa Terminal Subdivision covers track around Yeoman and Uceta Yards and is located at the end of two of CSX's U.S. East Coast main lines to Richmond, Virginia, the A Line and the S Line. Lines The Tampa Terminal Subdivision has three distinct lines running through it. The A and S Lines run east‚Äìwest through the yards, and the AZA line runs from the yards south. =A Line= Amtrak's Silver Star leaving Tampa Union Station on the Tampa Terminal Subdivision in 2012. The A Line is the northern east‚Äìwest line which runs from Mango though Uceta Yard to Tampa Union Station and is 8.1 miles in length. It notably passes through Tampa's historic Ybor City neighborhood. The A Line crosses the TECO Line Streetcar track between Ybor City and Tampa Union Station which is CSX's only at-grade crossing with a streetcar track in Florida. All Amtrak trains to Tampa operates on the A Line along with some local freight trains. The A Line is designated the Lakeland Subdivision east of the Tampa Terminal Subdivision. West of Tampa Union Station, the A Line continues southwest as the Port Tampa Spur. The Port Tampa Spur runs southwest to Port Tampa near MacDill Air Force Base and notably street runs along Polk Street in downtown Tampa before crossing the Hillsborough River. The A Line's designation stands for the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad as it was previously the Atlantic Coast Line mainline. =S Line= The S Line is the southern east‚Äìwest line which runs from control point YN (just east of the Tampa Bypass Canal) through Yeoman Yard to Gary and is in length. The S Line is CSX's main freight route through Peninsular Florida. The S Line is designated the Yeoman Subdivision east of the Tampa Terminal Subdivision. At the west end of the Tampa Terminal Subdivision, the line splits with its northwest track crossing the A Line and leading to the Clearwater Subdivision while the southwest track leads to the Hooker's Point Lead. The S Line's designation stands for the Seaboard Air Line Railroad as it was previously the Seaboard Air Line mainline. =AZA Line= The third line runs on the AZA Line from Yeoman Yard south to East Tampa and is 7.3 miles in length. At its south end the AZA line continues south to Bradenton as the Palmetto Subdivision.CSX Tampa Terminal SubCSX Jacksonville Division Timetable =Neve Spur= Another notable track within the Tampa Terminal Subdivision in the Neve Spur. The Neve Spur runs from a wye on the A Line just west of Uceta Yard and goes northeast a short distance to a point just south of Temple Terrace. The wye at the south end of the Neve Spur is often used for turning locomotives around and is notably where Amtrak's Silver Star is turned around to back into Tampa Union Station twice daily. Yards =Yeoman and Uceta yards= Yeoman Yard The Tampa Terminal Subdivision is centered around Yeoman Yard, CSX's primary classification yard for the Tampa area. Yeoman Yard was built by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad and is located along the S Line. A track on the south side of Yeoman Yard connects the S Line with the AZA line and allows trains to bypass the yard without entering yard limits. Uceta Yard, located just north of Yeoman Yard on the A Line, was once the main classification yard for the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. Though after the Atlantic Coast Line and Seaboard Air Line Railroads merged, Yeoman Yard was retained as the main classification yard. Uceta Yard now operates as an intermodal terminal and car storage facility. =Rockport Yard= Another notable yard is Rockport Yard, located south of Yeoman Yard on a wye off the AZA Line. Rockport Yard serves CSX's Rockport Terminal, a deep-water port used for exporting phosphate. Trains bring phosphate for export mined from the Bone Valley in Central Florida. Rockport became the primary phosphate export facility for the railroad after the closure of Port Boca Grande in 1979. History Hillsborough River Drawbridge on the Port Tampa Spur The A Line was previously the main line of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad with Uceta Yard being their main Tampa yard. The Atlantic Coast Line main line was originally built by the South Florida Railroad, which was part of Henry B. Plant's system of railroads. The line began service in 1884, and was taken over by the Atlantic Coast Line in 1902 after they bought the Plant System. The Neve Spur was originally part of the Tampa and Thonotosassa Railroad, another Plant System railroad which at one point extended northeast to Zephyrhills and Vitis Junction. The S Line was previously the main line of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad with Yeoman Yard being their main Tampa yard. The Seaboard Air Line main line was originally part of the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad and began service in 1890. The Seaboard Air Line acquired the line in 1903. In 1909, the Seaboard Air Line established its own port facility on Seddon Island (known today as Harbour Island). Seddon Island was named after Seaboard's chief engineer W.L. Seddon. The railroad would close and sell the Seddon Island terminal in 1979.Neighborhoods in Tampa Bay, Florida Seaboard built Yeoman Yard in the 1950s to mostly replace what is now known as Old Tampa Yard downtown. The AZA line south to East Tampa was built later in 1924 by the Tampa Southern Railroad, a subsidiary of the Atlantic Coast Line. The control point \\"TS\\" at the north end of the line is a reference to the Tampa Southern. The Hooker's Point Lead and track leading to the Clearwater Subdivision was originally built by the Tampa Northern Railroad in 1908. The Seaboard Air Line bought the Tampa Northern in 1912. Tampa Union Station In 1912, the Atlantic Coast Line, Seaboard Air Line, and the Tampa Northern Railroads jointly built Tampa Union Station to consolidate passenger operations in Tampa at a single location. The Atlantic Coast Line's previous depot (built by the South Florida Railroad) was located on the east side of the intersection of Ashley and Madison Streets. The Seaboard Air Line's depot (built by the FC&P; Railroad) was located at the intersection of Franklin and Whiting Streets. The Atlantic Coast Line and Seaboard Air Line merged in 1967 becoming the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad. This brought all tracks in Tampa under a single owner. In 1980, the Seaboard Coast Line's parent company merged with the Chessie System, creating the CSX Corporation. The CSX Corporation initially operated the Chessie and Seaboard Systems separately until 1986, when they were merged into CSX Transportation. Prior to the merger, the Seaboard main line (S Line) continued west from Gary giving the Seaboard its own access to Tampa Union Station. The S Line route into Tampa Union Station, which ran beside Adamo Drive, was removed in the 1990s, after Amtrak discontinued service to St. Petersburg in 1984.

It serves as CSX's main route through a region of Central Florida known as the Bone Valley, which contains the largest known deposits of phosphate in the United States.V. E. McKelvey and others, \\"Domestic Phosphate Deposits\\", US Geological Survey, Open-File Report 53-165, 1953. The Valrico Subdivision runs from a junction with CSX's S Line in Valrico east to Mulberry and Bartow before turning south to Fort Meade and Bowling Green for a total of 47 miles.CSX Jacksonville Division Timetable Much of the Valrico Subdivision dates back to the early 1900s and was originally operated under the same name by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, a CSX predecessor.Seaboard Air Line Railroad South Florida Division Timetable (1940) Though track to Bowling Green was previously operated by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, another CSX predecessor.Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Southern Division Timetable (1949) Operation The Valrico Subdivision is currently CSX's busiest rail line thorough Bone Valley and carries large amounts of phosphate traffic, its main commodity. The line is mostly dispatched by Track Warrant Control, though there is a small Centralized Traffic Control signal system around Mulberry between IMC and Ridgewood. The line serves phosphate facilities operated by The Mosaic Company, which was created in 2004 after the merger of Cargill Inc. and IMC Global. Mosaic's South Fort Meade Mine is located near the end of the Valrico Subdivision between Fort Meade and Bowling Green. The line also serves Mosaic's processing facility at Ridgewood and previously served the Bonnie Mine just southeast of Mulberry. Both raw and processed phosphate from these facilities (as well as facilities on CSX's Brewster Subdivision and Bone Valley Subdivision) are transported on the line to Valrico, where they continue on the S Line west to Tampa and then transferred to ships at Rockport Yard in Tampa. Phosphate is also sent north from Mulberry to Winston Yard (on the Bone Valley Subdivision) to be sent via rail throughout the country. History The 47 miles of track that are today the Valrico Subdivision were built incrementally from the late 1800s and early 20th century as the phosphate industry in Bone Valley began expanding. =Valrico to Bartow and Homeland= Crossing of the Valrico and Bone Valley Subdivisions in Mulberry. Diamond is located in the median of State Road 37. The Seaboard Air Line Railroad built the segment of the line from Welcome to Nichols around 1905. It was built as an extension of the Plant City, Arcadia, and Gulf Railroad (which is today the Plant City Subdivision), which Seaboard had bought earlier that year. Seaboard extended the line east to Mulberry and Bartow in 1912. The line crossed the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad's Bone Valley Branch (now the Bone Valley Subdivision) in Mulberry. The junction of these two lines is today located in the median of State Road 37 and the lines are connected through Mulberry Yard. The line also connected to the Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railway (now the Achan Subdivision) in Mulberry which at the time went as far as Port Boca Grande where a vast majority of phosphate was shipped in the early 20th century. By 1916, Seaboard would extend the line east from Bartow to Lake Wales, Alcoma, Hesperides, and Walinwa. At Walinwa, the line connected to the Kissimmee River Railway which continued east to Nalaca where it served a turpentine mill. Track from just east of Bartow (at a point known historically as Pembroke Junction) south to Homeland was part of a Seaboard spur built in 1914 to the now-defunct Coronet Pembroke Mine. Track east of Bartow to Lake Wales was abandoned in the early 1980s (the junction where the Plant City Subdivision meets the CSX S Line in Plant City is still known today as Lake Wales Junction because of this extension). Seaboard built the Valrico Cutoff in 1925 which connected the Seaboard main line (CSX's S Line) at Valrico with the track at Welcome. This is today is the westernmost trackage of the line. Seaboard designated the line as the Valrico Subdivision. With the Valrico Cutoff in place, the Valrico Subdivision would additionally become an important route for Seaboard's passenger trains as it provided a direct route from Tampa to Miami (which was accessed through the Seaboard's Miami Subdivision in Lake Wales, which was also completed in the 1920s). Seaboard would operate the Cross Florida Limited over the line, which was one of the first rail services to connect Tampa and Miami directly. The Cross Florida Limited would also have passenger stops in Mulberry and Bartow. The Mulberry depot still stands and is now a phosphate museum. =Homeland to Bowling Green= CSX train passing the historic Fort Meade Depot (milepost AX 875.13) on the Valrico Subdivision. The oldest trackage of the current Varico Subdivision is its south-easternmost trackage from Homeland (just south of Bartow) to Fort Meade and Bowling Green. This segment was built in 1886 by the Florida Southern Railway as their Charlotte Harbor Division (which later became the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad's Lakeland‚ÄìFort Myers Line). Today, this segment of the Valrico Subdivision ends less than a mile south of the Polk/Hardee County line in Bowling Green (just south of the South Fort Meade Mine). The line was abandoned north of Homeland and south of Bowling Green in the late 1980s. The Atlantic Coast Line's former passenger depot in Fort Meade still stands along the line, and the Bowling Green depot stands about a hundred yards south of the end of the track. =Later years= The Atlantic Coast Line and Seaboard Air Line Railroads merged in 1967 to form the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad, which brought all of the track under a single owner. In the Seaboard Coast Line era, the Valrico Subdivision designation continued to cover the line from Valrico east through Bartow and West Lake Wales, which was still in service at the time. Track east of West Lake Wales was redesignated as the Lake Wales Subdivision. Track was removed between Bartow and West Lake Wales by 1982.Seaboard Coast Line Railroad Jacksonville Division and Tampa Division Timetable (1982) Remaining track east of West Lake Wales is now operated by the Florida Midland Railroad. The track from Homeland to Bowling Green (which still ran from Lakeland to Fort Myers in the years after the merger) was part of the Fort Myers Subdivision.Seaboard Coast Line Railroad Jacksonville Division and Tampa Division Timetable (1977) When the Fort Myers Subdivision was abandoned north of Homeland and south of Bowling Green in the late 1980s, the remaining track was annexed to the Valrico Subdivision (CSX's CH Spur and the Seminole Gulf Railway south of Arcadia are discontinuous segments of this line). In 1980, the Seaboard Coast Line's parent company merged with the Chessie System, creating the CSX Corporation. The CSX Corporation initially operated the Chessie and Seaboard Systems separately until 1986, when they were merged into CSX Transportation. Milepost numbers Despite being a continuous line today, the milepost numbers on the Valrico Subdivision are not continuous throughout and remain as they originally were under predecessor companies (the Atlantic Coast Line and the Seaboard Air Line). The segment from Valrico to Welcome Junction (the Valrico Cutoff) is numbered independently from the rest of the line since that was the last track segment to be built. It is numbered SZ 0.0 through SZ 11.8. From Welcome Junction east to Bartow, the mileposts are numbered SV 834.2 through SV 851.1 (numbering which continues from the Plant City Subdivision). When the line turns south on to the former Seaboard Pembroke Mine spur in Bartow, the numbering continues with the prefix SVE since the SV prefix continued along the former east continuation to West Lake Wales. In Homeland, where the line transitions to the former Atlantic Coast Line track, the mileposts abruptly change at approximately SVE 857.3 to AX 870.8 reflecting the Atlantic Coast Line numbering. The end of the line today is at milepost AX 882.7 in Bowling Green.

They were built by the South Florida Railroad as part of their Pemberton Ferry branch (CSX's detoured S Line from Vitis Junction north to Owensboro is also part of the Pemberton Ferry branch). CSX's A Line was originally the South Florida Railroad's main line. The line was narrow gauge when originally built. It was fully converted to standard gauge on August 7, 1891. The Plant System, which the South Florida Railroad was part of, was bought out by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1902. In the Atlantic Coast Line era, the line would serve as the southernmost segment of their line from Du Pont, Georgia to Lakeland via High Springs (R Line), which would be complete by 1913.

Franck, however, had his own strong opinions on the depiction of nature and went to the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf, where he had been recommended to Jakob F√ºrchtegott Dielmann. He was there until 1886. He then began to travel, eventually settling in W√ºrzburg. After finding little success there, he moved to Berlin in 1892 and became a teacher at the Royal Art School. In 1898, he was awarded the title of Professor. That same year, he joined with Lovis Corinth and Max Liebermann to help create the Berlin Secession. In 1902, his first wife died and, two years later, he married one of his students. In 1906, Franck and his family moved to Halensee on the Wannsee, where he attempted to establish an artists' colony modeled on the one in Kronberg, but was unsuccessful. He returned to Berlin and became Director of the Royal Art School in 1915. In 1928, he participated in the International Exhibition at the Carnegie Institute. His book of reminiscences, Ein Leben f√ºr die Kunst (A Life for Art), was published shortly after his death. Family Philipp Franck married, firstly, Katharina Ernst (1866-1902). She died in August 1902, however. In 1904 he married his pupil Martha Kuhlo. Philipp Franck had four recorded children from his two marriages. Since 1906 Franck lived with his family in Berlin-Wannsee. A son from his first marriage was the scientist (1888-1961). His son from his second marriage, Carl Ludwig (\\"Carllutz\\") Franck (1904-1985), became a noted architect. The sculptor, Ingeborg Hunzinger (1915-2009) was a granddaughter. The writer Julia Franck is a great granddaughter. References  Further reading * Ingeborg Becker, Manfred Grosskinsky (eds.), Vom Taunus zum Wannsee ‚Äì Der Maler Philipp Franck (1860‚Äì1944).

It runs along CSX's S Line from Baldwin south to Zephyrhills via Ocala and Wildwood for a total of 155.7 miles. The S Line is CSX's designation for the line that was the Seaboard Air Line Railroad main line from 1903 to 1967. The north end of the line is at Baldwin Junction, where it connects with the Jacksonville Terminal Subdivision to the east, the Callahan Subdivision to the north, and the Florida Gulf & Atlantic Railroad to the west. At its south end, it connects to the Yeoman Subdivision, which continues to Tampa. It also connects with the Vitis Subdivision just south of Dade CityCSX Wildwood SubCSX Jacksonville Division Timetable Operation The Wildwood Subdivision passing through Wildwood Yard as seen in 2008. The Wildwood Subdivision and the Yeoman Subdivision (which both run along CSX‚Äôs S Line) together are CSX‚Äôs main freight route through Peninsular Florida. The Wildwood Subdivision is used exclusively for freight. Freight trains bound for Tampa generally run the full line to the Yeoman Subdivision while trains to Miami, Orlando, and other areas of Southern Florida diverge on to the Vitis Subdivision at Vitis Junction. The line is double tracked in many places to accommodate the large amount of freight traffic and is dispatched through a Centralized traffic control signal system. Some of the double track was installed in the mid 2010s to further increase capacity since through trains no longer use the adjacent A Line, which is now partially state owned. Passenger service previously operated over the line which diminished in the late 1980s when CSX abandoned parts of Seaboard's branch at Wildwood to West Palm Beach and Miami (the Florida Western and Northern Railroad). Amtrak's Silver Star to Miami used this route up until then, which was subsequently shifted to the A Line through Orlando. Passenger service was discontinued completely in 2004 when Amtrak truncated the Palmetto to Savannah, Georgia. =Wildwood Yard= A notable location on the Wildwood Subdivision is Wildwood Yard. Today, Wildwood yard serves as a small CSX maintenance and switching yard. It was historically a busy classification yard in the days of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad. From the 1920s to the 1980s, the yard was significant since the Seaboard's division points to Tampa, Orlando, and Miami were located just to the south. Trains to Orlando previously turned towards Leesburg and Tavares just south of the yard (the wye at the south end of the yard is all that remains of that connection). Trains to Miami turned in Coleman down Seaboard's Florida Western and Northern Railroad. Wildwood station still stands and is co-located in the yard, though passenger service has long been discontinued. In 2013, new double-tracked main lines were built to bypass the yard. The station's platforms were removed to accommodate this expansion. History Historic plaque marking the former location of Owensboro Junction where the Atlantic Coast Line and Seaboard Air Line tracks crossed. The Wildwood Subdivision from Baldwin to Waldo was built in 1859 by the Florida Railroad, which historically ran from Fernandina Beach to Cedar Key (which was the first cross-state railroad route in Florida). From Waldo south to Ocala the line was originally part of the Peninsula Railroad and from Ocala south to Lacoochee (at a point previously known as Owensboro Junction) it was part of the Tropical Florida Railroad. All three of these railroads would be merged into the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad, which would be bought by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad in 1903. The line became the Seaboard's main line. From Owensboro south to what is now Vitis Junction was originally a branch of the South Florida Railroad, and from Vitis Junction to Zephyrhills, it was originally part of the Tampa and Thonotosassa Railroad. Both of those lines would become part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. The Seaboard line originally had its own alignment from Owensboro to Zephyrhills via Dade City, but that segment was abandoned in the early 1970s, shortly after the Seaboard Air Line's 1967 merger with the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. The abandonment was part of an effort to consolidate the merged network, which was named the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad. The Atlantic Coast Line route was kept in favor of the Seaboard route since is it went around the downtowns of Dade City and Zephyrhills. Despite its Atlantic Coast Line heritage, it is unofficially considered part of the S Line since it carries all S Line traffic (though, this segment still retains its ACL milepost numbering with AR and ARF prefixes). In the Seaboard Coast Line-era, the line was designated as the Baldwin Subdivision from Baldwin Junction to Wildwood. From Wildwood to Coleman, it was part of the Miami Subdivision, which continued down the now-abandoned SX branch from Coleman to Auburndale and to the Miami area (the former Florida Western and Northern Railroad). From Coleman to Owensboro, the line was designated as the Coleman Subdivision, and from Owensboro south to Zephyrhills was part of the West Coast Subdivision (which continued up the now-abandoned AR line north from Owensboro to High Springs).Seaboard Coast Line Railroad Jacksonville Division and Tampa Division Timetable (1977) In 1980, the Seaboard Coast Line's parent company merged with the Chessie System, creating the CSX Corporation. The CSX Corporation initially operated the Chessie and Seaboard Systems separately until 1986, when they were merged into CSX Transportation. During late 1980s, the company sought to abandon many redundant routes which created the track structure in place today. The Wildwood Subdivision and the rest of the S Line (CSX's designation for the former Seaboard Air Line main line) continues to be CSX's main route through peninsular Florida.

It has rough grey or brownish, stringy or fibrous bark from the trunk to the thinnest branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves arranged in opposite pairs, lance-shaped to curved, long, wide and a different shade on either side. Adult leaves are lance-shaped or curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The leaves are bluish green on one side and a lighter green on the other. The flowers are borne in groups of seven, nine or eleven in leaf axils on a sometimes branched peduncle, long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval to spindle-shaped, long and wide with a conical to slightly beaked operculum. Flowering mainly occurs from September to November and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, hemispherical or shortened spherical capsule long and wide with the valves about level with the rim. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus carnea was first formally described by the botanist Richard Thomas Baker in 1906 from specimens collected near the Richmond River by William Baeuerlen, (previously known as Wilhelm B√§uerlen). The description was published in Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. The specific epithet (carnea) is a Latin word meaning \\"of flesh\\", possibly referring to the colour of the heartwood. Eucalyptus carnea is part of the white mahogany group as recognised by Ken Hill. Others in the group include E. acmenoides, E. mediocris, E. apothalassica, E. helidonica, E. latisinensis, E. psammitica and E. umbra.

A headframe overlooking Butte. Butte is a city in southwestern Montana established as a mining camp in the 1860s in the northern Rocky Mountains straddling the Continental Divide. Butte became a hotbed for silver and gold mining in its early stages, and grew exponentially upon the advent of electricity in the late-nineteenth century due to the land's large natural stores of copper. In 1888 alone, mining operations in Butte had generated an output of $23 million. The arrival of several magnates in the area around this time, later known as the \\"Copper Kings,\\" marked the beginning of Butte's establishment as a boomtown. The city was also the site of various political events relating to is industrial roots and expansive workforce, and was home to strong labor activism and Socialist movements in the early-twentieth century. After numerous mining-related disasters (including the 1917 Speculator Mine disaster the largest hard rock mining disaster in world history), and a steady decline in copper demand, Butte's Anaconda Copper company shifted to open-pit mining in the mid-twentieth century. Over several decades, mining took place at the Berkeley Pit before operations were ceased in 1983. Post-millennium economic forces in Butte have largely centered on technology and the health industry, as well as efforts to preserve the city's historic buildings and cultural sites. In 2002, Butte was one of only twelve towns in America to be named a Distinctive Destination by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. History =Pre-historic era and native history= The land on which Butte was established is positioned in the Silver Bow Creek Valley (or Summit Valley), a natural bowl sitting high in the Rocky Mountains straddling the Continental Divide. The southwestern side of the bowl is made of a large mass of granite known as the Boulder Batholith, which dates to the Cretaceous era. The land surrounding Butte around Silver Bow Creek was a hunting and fishing area for the native Salish peoples who had settlements to the northwest, near Missoula. The creek's name originates from the Salish \\"Sin-tahp-kay-Sntapqey\\" ( Place Where Something is Shot in the Head). =1860‚Äì1888: Establishment and immigration= Mining prospectors in Montana, 1880s-1890s. Wah Chong Tai building housed one of the city's earliest Chinese-owned businesses. Butte began as a mining camp in the 1860s. Early map drawings of Butte sometimes referred to the settlement as \\"Butte City.\\" In 1874, William L. Farlin staked the Asteroid Mine (later known as the Travona), and was followed by an influx of additional miners seeking gold and silver. The mines attracted workers from Cornwall (United Kingdom), Ireland, Wales, Lebanon, Canada, Finland, Austria, Serbia, Italy, China, Syria, Croatia, Montenegro, Mexico, and all areas of the United States. The legacy of the immigrants lives on in the form of the Cornish pasty which was popularized by mine workers who needed something easy to eat in the mines, the povitica‚Äîa Slavic nut bread pastry which is a holiday favorite sold in many supermarkets and bakeries in Butte‚Äîand the boneless porkchop sandwich. These, along with huckleberry products and Scandinavian lefse have arguably become Montana's symbolic foods, known and enjoyed throughout Montana. In the ethnic neighborhoods, young men formed gangs to protect their territory and socialize into adult life, including the Irish of Dublin Gulch, the Eastern Europeans of the McQueen Addition, and the Italians of Meaderville (Butte's Irish Catholic community has been notably longstanding: As of 2017, the city has the highest percentage of Irish Americans per capita of any city in the United States). Among the migrants, many Chinese workers moved in, and amongst them set up businesses that led to the creation of a Chinatown in Butte. The Chinese migrations stopped in 1882 with the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act. There was anti-Chinese sentiment in the 1870s and onwards due to racism on the part of the white settlers, exacerbated by economic depression, and in 1895, the chamber of commerce and labor unions started a boycott of Chinese owned businesses. The business owners fought back by suing the unions and winning. The history of the Chinese migrants in Butte is documented in the Mai Wah Museum. The influx of miners gave Butte a reputation as a wide-open town where any vice was obtainable. The city's famous saloon and red-light district, called the \\"Line\\" or \\"The Copper Block\\", was centered on Mercury Street, where the elegant bordellos included the famous Dumas Brothel. Behind the brothel was the equally famous Venus Alley, where women plied their trade in small cubicles called \\"cribs\\". The red-light district brought miners and other men from all over the region and was open until 1982 as one of the last such urban districts in the United States. Commercial breweries first opened in Butte in the 1870s, and were a large staple of the city's early economy; they were usually run by German immigrants, including Leopold Schmidt, Henry Mueller, and Henry Muntzer. The breweries were always staffed by union workers. Most ethnic groups in Butte, from Germans and Irish to Italians and various Eastern Europeans, including children, enjoyed the locally brewed lagers, bocks, and other types of beer. =1889‚Äì1899: Industrial expansion and unionism= Underground miners in the Parrot Mine 1900 In the late nineteenth century, copper was in great demand because of new technologies such as electric power that required the use of copper. Three industrial magnates fought for control of Butte's mining wealth. These three \\"Copper Kings\\" were William A. Clark, Marcus Daly, and F. Augustus Heinze. Between 1884 and 1888, Clark constructed the Copper King Mansion in Butte, which became his second residence from his home in New York City. He also, in 1899, purchased the Columbia Gardens, a small park which he developed into a full amusement park, featuring a pavilion, rollercoaster, and a lake for swimming and canoeing. Clark's expansion of the park was intended to \\"provide a place where children and families could get away from the polluted air of the Butte mining industry.\\" Further cultural developments in the city at this time included the emergence of the Boston and Montana Band, a local marching band that formed on December 22, 1887 by Boston investors Adolph and Leonard Lewisohn and miner Charles X. Larrabee. The city's rapid expansion was noted in an 1889 frontier survey: \\"Butte, Montana, fifteen years ago a small placer-mining village clinging to the mountain side, has now risen to the rank of the first mining camp of the world... [It] is now the most populous city of Montana, numbering twenty-five thousand active, enterprising, prosperous inhabitants.\\" In 1888 alone, mining operations in Butte had generated an \\"almost inconceivable\\" output of $23 million () worth of ore. Boston and Montana Band, Butte's longest-standing local band, formed in December 1887. Around the turn of the twentieth century, prosperous mining had generated considerable wealth in Butte, and at the time was the largest city between Chicago and San Francisco. Copper ore mined from the Butte mining district in 1910 alone totaled , making it the largest producer of copper in North America and second only to South Africa in world production of metals. The same year, an excess of of silver and of gold were also discovered. The amount of ore produced in the city earned it the nickname \\"The Richest Hill on Earth.\\" With its large workforce of miners performing in physically dangerous conditions, Butte was the site of active labor union movements, and came to be known as \\"the Gibraltar of Unionism.\\" The Anselmo Mine, which opened in 1887. \\"Jim,\\" the sole surviving horse of the 1895 Kenyon-Connell Warehouse explosion. By 1885, there were about 1,800 dues- paying members of a general union in Butte. That year the union reorganized as the Butte Miners' Union (BMU), spinning off all non-miners to separate craft unions. Some of these joined the Knights of Labor, and by 1886 the separate organizations came together to form the Silver Bow Trades and Labor Assembly, with 34 separate unions representing nearly all of the 6,000 workers around Butte. The BMU established branch unions in mining towns like Barker, Castle, Champion, Granite, and Neihart, and extended support to other mining camps hundreds of miles away. In 1892 there was a violent strike in Coeur d'Alene.Roughneck: The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, p. 50. Although the BMU was experiencing relatively friendly relations with local management, the events in Idaho were disturbing. The BMU not only sent thousands of dollars to support the Idaho miners, they mortgaged their buildings to send more. There was a growing concern that local unions were vulnerable to the power of Mine Owners' Associations like the one in Coeur d'Alene. In May 1893, about forty delegates from northern hard-rock mining camps met in Butte and established the Western Federation of Miners (WFM), which sought to organize miners throughout the West. The Butte Miners' Union became Local Number One of the new WFM. The WFM won a strike in Cripple Creek, Colorado, the following year, but then in 1896‚Äì97 lost another violent strike in Leadville, Colorado, prompting the Montana State Trades and Labor Council to issue a proclamation to organize a new Western labor federation along industrial lines. In 1899, Daly joined with William Rockefeller, Henry H. Rogers, and Thomas W. Lawson to organize the Amalgamated Copper Mining Company. Not long after, the company changed its name to Anaconda Copper Mining Company (ACM). On the evening of January 15, 1895, an explosion occurred at the Kenyon-Connell Warehouse, which killed a total of 57 people (13 of whom were city firefighters) as well as numerous horses and livestock. The explosion was later determined to have been caused by dynamite. A funeral procession of 3,000 people took place for the deceased on January 18, 1895. =1900‚Äì1945: Union activity and civil unrest= Frank Little, an IWW organizer who was lynched in Butte in 1917. Montana School of Mines, 1900. In 1900, Butte opened its first institution of higher education, the Montana School of Mines, which is contemporarily Montana Tech of the University of Montana. Between approximately 1900 and 1917, Butte had a strong streak of Socialist politics, even electing a Mayor on the Socialist ticket in 1914. It had also established itself as \\"one of the most solid union cities in America.\\" After 1905, Butte became a hotbed of Industrial Workers of the World (IWW, or the \\"Wobblies\\") organizing. Rivalry between IWW supporters and the WFM locals culminated in the Butte, Montana labor riots of 1914, and resulted in the loss of union recognition by the mine owners. After the dissolution of the Miners' Union, the Anaconda Company attempted to inaugurate programs aimed at enticing employees. However, a number of clashes between laborers, labor organizers, and the Anaconda Company ensued, including the 1917 lynching of IWW executive board officer Frank Little. Sparked by a tragic accident more than below the ground on June 8, 1917, a fire in the Granite Mountain shaft spewed flames, smoke, and poisonous gas through the labyrinth of tunnels including the connected Speculator Mine. A rescue effort commenced, but the carbon monoxide was stealing the air supply. A few men built man-made bulkheads to save their lives, but many others died in a panic to try to get out. Rescue workers set up a fan to prevent the fire from spreading. This worked for a short time, but when the rescuers tried to use water, the water evaporated, creating steam that burned people trying to escape. Once the fire was out, those waiting to hear the news on the surface could not identify the victims. They were too mutilated to recognize, leading many to assume the worst. Of the 168 bodies removed from the mine, most had died due to lack of oxygen and smoke inhalation as opposed to the actual fire itself. Due to the efforts of men such as Ernest Sullau, Manus Duggan, Con O'Neil, and J. D. Moore, some survived, but the event was the largest hard rock mining accident in the history. The Granite Mountain Memorial was built to commemorate those who died in the accident. The disaster was also memorialized in the song, \\"Rox in the Box\\" on the album The King is Dead by the indie rock band, The Decemberists. The loss of miners in the incident sparked additional strikes and protests, as well as the establishment of the Metal Mine Workers Union, which led 15,000 workers to abandon their jobs. In 1917, copper production from the Butte mines peaked and steadily declined thereafter. By WWII, copper production from the ACM's holdings in Chuquicamata, Chile, far exceeded Butte's production. The historian Janet Finn has examined this \\"tale of two cities\\"‚ÄîButte and Chuquicamata as two ACM mining towns. In 1920, company mine guards gunned down strikers in the Anaconda Road Massacre. Seventeen were shot in the back as they tried to flee, and one man died. On August 3, 1921, the Montana Federation of Colored Women's Clubs held its inaugural meeting in Butte. Disputes between miners' unions and companies continued through the 1920s and 1930s in Butte, with several strikes and protests, one of which lasted for ten months in 1921. In 1923, protestors attempted to blow up the Hibernian Hall on Main Street with dynamite. Between 1914 and 1920, the U.S. National Guard occupied Butte a total of six times to restore civility. Further industrial expansions included the arrival of the first mail plane in the city in 1928, and in 1937, the city's streetcar system was dismantled and replaced with bus lines. The city's first airport, Butte Municipal Airport (now Bert Mooney Airport), was constructed south of the city proper in 1927, and operated frequent flights to and from Salt Lake City. In 1933, Northwest Orient Airlines expanded to service the airport from the West Coast and Midwestern states. = 1946‚Äì1999: Open-pit mining era= The copper mines proved to be prosperous until the 1950s, when the declining grade of ore and competition from other mines led the Anaconda Company to switch its focus from the costly and dangerous practice of underground mining to open pit mining. Since the 1950s, five major developments in the city have occurred: the Anaconda's decision to begin open-pit mining in the mid-1950s; a series of fires in Butte's business district in the 1970s; a debate over whether to relocate the city's historic business district; a new civic leadership; and the end of copper mining in 1983. In response, Butte looked for ways to diversify the economy and provide employment. The legacy of over a century of environmental degradation has, for example, produced some jobs. Environmental cleanup in Butte, designated a Superfund site, has employed hundreds of people. Thousands of homes were destroyed in the Meaderville suburb and surrounding areas, McQueen and East Butte, to excavate the Berkeley Pit, which opened in 1954 by Anaconda Copper. At the time, it was the largest truck- operated open pit copper mine in the United States. The Berkeley Pit grew with time until it bordered the Columbia Gardens. After the Gardens caught fire and burned to the ground in November 1973, the Continental Pit was excavated on the former park site. In 1977 the ARCO (Atlantic Richfield Company) company purchased Anaconda, and only three years later started shutting down mines due to lower metal prices. In 1982, all mining in the Berkeley Pit was suspended. In 1983, an organization of low income and unemployed residents of Butte formed to fight for jobs and environmental justice; the Butte Community Union produced a detailed plan for community revitalization and won substantial benefits, including a Montana Supreme Court victory striking down as unconstitutional State elimination of welfare benefits.McCarthy, Bob J., Re- Claiming Butte: The Doctrine of Subjacent Support, 49 Mont. L. Rev. 267 (1988)  Closure of Berkeley Pit  The Berkeley Pit in 1984. Anaconda ceased mining at the Continental Pit in 1983. Montana Resources LLP bought the property and reopened the Continental Pit in 1986. The company stopped mining in 2000, but resumed in 2003 with higher metal prices, and continues at last report, employing 346 people. From 1880 through 2005, the mines of the Butte district have produced more than 9.6 million metric tons of copper, 2.1 million metric tons of zinc, 1.6 million metric tons of manganese, 381,000 metric tons of lead, 87,000 metric tons of molybdenum, 715 million troy ounces (22,200 metric tons) of silver, and 2.9 million ounces (90 metric tons) of gold. After the closure of the Berkeley Pit mining operations in 1982, pipes which pumped groundwater out of the pit were turned off, resulting in the pit slowly filling with groundwater, creating an artificial lake. Only two years later the pit was classified as a Superfund site and an environmental hazard site. The water in the pit is contaminated with various hard metals, such as arsenic, cadmium, and zinc. It was not until the 1990s that serious efforts to clean up the Berkeley Pit began. The situation gained even more attention after as many as 342 migrating geese chose the pit lake as a resting place, resulting in their deaths. Steps have since been taken to prevent a recurrence, including but not limited to loudspeakers broadcasting sounds to scare off waterfowl. However, in November 2003 the Horseshoe Bend treatment facility went online and began treating and diverting much of the water that would have flowed into the pit. The Berkeley Pit is both a Superfund site and tourist attraction, viewable from an observation deck. Per a 2014 report, scientists believe the Berkeley Pit may reach the critical water level‚Äîpotentially contaminating Silver Bow Creek‚Äîby the year 2023. Beginning in 2019, the Montana Resources and Atlantic Richfield Co. are ordered by the Environmental Protection Agency to begin treating water from the pit, which is to then be discharged into Silver Bow Creek at a rate of per day. Nikia Greene, EPA project manager for mine flooding, assured in 2014: \\"The pit is a giant bathtub. There‚Äôs a hydraulic gradient into the pit. We will never let the water reach the critical level.\\" = 2000‚Äìpresent: Preservation efforts= The Copper King Mansion, built in 1884, underwent restoration in 2011. Contemporarily, around twenty of the headframes still stand over the mine shafts, and the city still contains thousands of historic commercial and residential buildings from the boom times, which, especially in the Uptown section, give it a very old-fashioned appearance, with many commercial buildings not fully occupied. Restoration and preservation of the city's historically-significant buildings has also been undertaken, with the Copper King Mansion as an example, having undergone significant restoration in 2011. . As with many industrial cities, tourism and services, especially healthcare (Butte's St. James Hospital has Southwest Montana's only major trauma center), as well as energy companies (such as the Renewable Energy Corporation and NorthWestern Energy), are economic presences. In 2014, NorthWestern Energy constructed a $25-million facility in uptown Butte. are rising as primary employers, as well as industrial-sector private companies. Many areas of the city, especially the areas near the old mines, show signs of urban blight but a recent influx of investors and an aggressive campaign to remedy blight has led to a renewed interest in restoring property in Uptown Butte's historic district, which was expanded in 2006 to include parts of Anaconda and is now the largest National Historic Landmark District in the United States with nearly 6,000 contributing properties. A century after the era of intensive mining and smelting, the area around the city remains an environmental issue. Arsenic and heavy metals such as lead are found in high concentrations in some spots affected by old mining, and for a period of time in the 1990s the tap water was unsafe to drink due to poor filtration and decades-old wooden supply pipes. Environmental research and clean-up efforts have contributed to the diversification of the local economy in the post-millennium era, and signs of vitality remain, including a multimillion-dollar polysilicon manufacturing plant locating nearby in the 1990s and the city's recognition and designation in the late 1990s as an All-America City and also as one of the National Trust for Historic Preservation's Dozen Distinctive Destinations in 2002.

Press reviews  Caroline Fischer in Concert Klassik.com, 2009: ‚ÄúAtmospherically dense sonority [...], marked sensibility [...] her enormous serenity which wins one over, the plasticity and precision with which she shapes chains of chords, octaval transpositions, runs and the rhythmical complexity.‚Äù Leipziger Volkszeitung, 2009: ‚ÄúHer approach to Liszt is shaped by the musical line, she focuses on the transparency and structure, whether it be in the magnificent transcriptions of songs by Schubert or Schumann in the dissembling Mephisto Waltz No.1.‚Äù Klassik-heute.com, 2009: ‚Äú Fischer satisfies all purity requirements, and invests drive and passion without losing that formal overview which these small, self-contained inner landscapes suggest to the interpreter. [...] Caroline Fischer shows nerve, displays energetic attack and, with rhythmic elasticity, steers the first part onwards with clear contours. Then, with full pianistic vividness, she proceeds to execute the undulations of the B minor tremolos reminiscent of the second St. Francis Legend. Caroline Fischer knows how to build up to pivotional climaxes, and to master them with verve and a willingness to take risks. She understands ‚Äì for instance at the start of the Mephisto Waltz ‚Äì how to provoke an acrid atmosphere in marked contrast to the melancholically sentimental variations of the middle section.‚Äù Wolfsburger Nachrichten, 2008: ‚ÄúPulsating bass figures, striking chords, trills and runs. There are no technical problems for this pianist, so much is clear from the solo passages which she imbues with detailed phrasing, and the cadenzas which she masters with virtuoso brilliance. [...] like a nightingale, the pianist improvises her solo, singing out softly and brightly. The turbulent final movement is a dialogue played out between the orchestra and soloist, who performs her role with effervescent power and virtuosity. As it comes to its dance-like close, the audience erupts into tumultuous and long-lasting applause.‚Äù Wolfsburger Allgemeine Zeitung, 2008: ‚ÄúThe pianist from Berlin proved why she is already a star. It was astounding how powerfully this graceful pianist mastered the demanding Allegro. Impressive, too, with how much feeling she stroked the keys in the Adagio. The perfect ensemble playing with the orchestra was remarkable. That had class. Bravo!‚Äù Badische Neueste Nachrichten, 2007: ‚ÄúAt the piano, Caroline Fischer proved herself to be a spirited interpreter, at once both commanding and sensitive. She plays Grieg with her heart and soul, in a way which is powerful and superior, and which goes to confirm her interpretation as a mature musical statement. Pulsating energy flows through her hands from piano through to forte. In the very solemn Adagio, her velvety piano was full of intensity, just as elsewhere, too, the music was brought to life under her hands. In the Allegro marcato, the lyrical section was defined with great sensitivity. In the jubilant fortissimo, she imparted a great sense of tension.‚Äù Resmusica.com, 2006: \\"Right from the very first bars, the listener is gripped by Caroline Fischer‚Äôs interpretation of Liszt‚Äôs ‚ÄûCampanella‚Äú. She is an exceptional artist, this much is certain. Caroline Fischer‚Äôs interpretations are profound, powerful and expressive; in every respect they do justice to the spirit and score of the composers selected. [ ... ] Without doubt, Caroline Fischer already belongs to the most outstanding great artists of her profession.\\" Klassik.com, 2006: ‚ÄúThe pianist clearly demonstrates her excellent artistic calibre with her first recording. She masters all the technical demands of the literature in a most impressive manner, with a somnambulistic certainty coupled with a controlled touch.‚Äù Klassik-heute.com, 2006: \\"An interpreter whose performances decisively separate her from the mass of other talented, industrious pianists. She performs her programme, which contains a number of virtuoso masterpieces, not only with propriety, but also with a commanding degree of imagination which compels the fastidiously listener to sit up and take notice. Caroline Fischer has something to say across the whole board of the musical literature presented here, she endows the ‚ÄûHungarian No. 13‚Äù with flair and gypsylike pathos, not only in the short grace notes, but also in the dance-like, frivolous finale. She knows how to colour the dramatic vicissitudes of the Don Juan fantasy and to make them stand out from one another - piano-playing of a high degree of solidity and, in the decisive moments, also of a certain ignitable, burning power.\\"  Musical family tree  Caroline Fischer studied i.a. with Prof. Dan and Prof. Sava. Both were pupils of Gy√∂rgy Halmos, who studied with Emil von Sauer. He was a student of Franz Liszt. Liszt received piano lessons from Czerny, who in his own youth had been a student of Beethoven and Hummel. Beethoven himself studied with Haydn.

The fruit is a woody shortened spherical to hemispherical capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level. Taonomy and naming In 1928, Joseph Maiden and William Blakely described Eucalyptus acmenoides var. tenuipes in Maiden's book, A Critical Revision of the Genus Eucalyptus from specimens collected by Harald Ingemann Jensen near \\"Meteor Creek, South Central Queensland\\". In 1931, Blakely and Cyril Tenison White raised the variety to species status as E. tenuipes in Proceedings of the Royal Society of Queensland. The specific epithet (tenuipes) is from the Latin tenui- meaning \\"slender\\" or \\"thin\\" and pes meaning \\"foot\\", referring to the thin pedicels of the flower buds. Distribution and habitat Eucalyptus tenuipes grows in open forest on gently slopes between Rockhampton and St George and sporadically further north.

It is a variant of Stribling from the Old English Stryplynge which means \\"a youth\\". Perhaps the name was given to a person with a youthful appearance. The most recent adaptation of the Strefling surname occurred in the Ukraine in the late 1800s and was solidified when the Ukrainian-German Strefling family immigrated to North America. The first recorded Strefling predecessor was dated 1259, that of Symon Stripling, in the Court Rolls of the Abbey of Ramsey, Ramsey, Cambridgeshire during the reign of King Henry III of England. It was during this period of time that surnames were first used. Other variants of Strefling include: Stribley, Strybley, Streplink, Stripling, Stripp, Strapp, Strepling, Straefling, Striffling, Strifling, Strebling, Striebling, Strelping, Stroepling, Stribbling, Stribling, Striefler, and Strupe. Throughout the centuries, surnames in every country have continued to develop often leading to significant variants of the original spelling. The surname Strefling remains similar-sounding to the original Stryplynge, more so than the other variants. The surname Striebling which was German-sounding, appears to have been, likely unintentionally, returned to its Anglican root in recent history. The Strefling surname variants are primarily found in the United States, Canada, Brazil, England, France, Belgium, Germany, and the Ukraine. The most commonly used variant of the Strefling surname is Stripling, most of which have the surname Stripling are located in England, or have strong recent English heritage. Persons with the Strefling, Strifling, and Striffling surnames in North America are likely decedents of August Striebling, born October 26, 1836, in Berwald, Volhynia. The Strefling name and many of its variants are found in the birth, marriage, and death records maintained by the Saint Petersburg Lutheran Consistory in Saint Petersburg, Russia. In these records it is clear to see the progression of Striebling to Strefling. The Streflings immigrated to North America from Volhynia, Ukraine, in the late 1800s and early 1900s and primarily settled in Weesaw Township, Michigan; Kenosha, Wisconsin; and Rosthern, Saskatchewan. Many of the Streflings were instrumental in the founding of Lutheran Synods in America. The Streflings immigrated to Volhynia (Volyn Oblast) during the reign of Catherine the Great. Russia‚Äôs Tsarina, Catherine the Great, was herself a German, and she invited the German people to join her in Russia. Seeking religious freedom and the promise of fertile land and prosperity, the Strefling family immigrated to Russia in the late 1700s and early 1800s. The Streflings were Protestant Lutherans during a time period where there was a post-reformation resurgence of Catholicism resulting in religious conflicts in Germany. It was also the promise of religious freedom and the opportunity for prosperity that brought them to North America in the late 1800s and early 1900s during a time of secularization and political instability in Russia and Europe. Volhynia was once a part of Russia, Belarus, Poland, and is now in the Ukraine. When the Strefling family immigrated to North America it was considered part of Belarus which translates to \\"White Russia\\" in English. It is not entirely known why the country was referred to as \\"White\\" but, the connotation has nothing to do with skin color. Prior to living in Volhynia, the Strefling family likely had the surname Striefler and lived in the Saarland Bundesl√§nder (Province) of Germany on the border with France. During this time (1700s) The Strieflers likely had close cousins in nearby England, France, and Belgium. Notable Streflings include author Patricia Strefling, interventional cardiologist Dr. Jason Andrew Strefling, orthopaedic surgeon Marlen S Strefling, and businessman Mark M. Strefling.

It was released on July 12, 2011, by the label Yours Truly, and is dedicated to Krell's friend Ryan Douglas Hitchon, who died in August 2010. The extended play consists of three string quartet-driven chamber renditions of songs from How to Dress Well's debut album Love Remains (2010), as well as another track, \\"Suicide Dream 3\\". Just Once was written by Krell, and recorded and mixed by Nic Atamaniuk. It garnered generally positive reviews from music journalists upon its July 2011 distribution, some of the major praises and criticisms going towards its departure from the reverb-and-distortion-heavy sound of Love Remains for a cleaner sound. Composition and production Just Once is dedicated to Krell's friend Ryan Douglas Hitchon, who died in August 2010. Three out of the four tracks on Just Once, \\"Suicide Dream 1\\", \\"Suicide Dream 2\\" and \\"Decisions\\", are string quartet-driven chamber renditions of the more ambient cuts on How to Dress Well's debut studio album Love Remains (2010). These are tracks that Krell thought of as orchestral songs when he made them in the first place.Eddie \\"Stats\\" (2011). \\"Video: How To Dress Well ‚ÄúSuicide Dream 3‚Äù. Okayplayer. Retrieved October 1, 2016. It was when he was creating \\"Suicide Dream 3\\" that he conceived making a record in memory of Hitchon that contained orchestral arrangements of the three songs that he envisioned as orchestral pieces. Krell's vocals are played at a high volume on the mix, and is devoid of any effects except for a little bit of reverb. This is a departure from the digital impulse noise-filled sound that was on Love Remains, where his voice was filtered with a heavy amount of reverb and distortion. Despite the orchestral instruments and a clean sound, some critics noted Just Once to still have a \\"crude\\" and \\"homemade\\" feel as Love Remains did, as well as maintaining the same harmony arrangement style as the full-length album. One critic from Beats per Minute described the tracks as \\"delicately arranged\\" for them to be \\"aggressively homemade\\", an example of this fact being a certain point in the EP where Krell pressing a button to stop recording can be heard. The 405 said that Krell's emotional falsetto mixture of joy and sadness \\"betrays the sense of looking back with a smile.\\" Songs \\"Suicide Dream 1\\" opens with an a cappella part before the strings that build up and what Beats per Minute describes as a \\"pastoral\\" piano play. Krell then sings a solo part in the track as the instrumental atmosphere \\"writhes\\" as Beats per Minute analyzed. Beginning with a sustained violin, \\"Suicide Dream 2\\" then has a \\"beautiful wash of piano\\" that \\"slowly wraps tendrils around the track\\", wrote Beats per Minute. Halfway into the length of the track, the publication analyzed that \\"everything sort of drops away to let singular notes peel off into the expanse while Krell's yearning half-lidded whispers waver around the space.\\" \\"Suicide Dream 3\\" is the EP's only cut to not be a version of a song on Love Remains, and is the most filled with string riffs out of all of the four tracks. Just Once closes with \\"Decisions\\", which Pitchfork Media analysized to be a combination of \\"fuzzy, abstracted versions of about five different emotions\\". The track goes into a waltz-time signature every fourth bar. The song is also the only one on the record to have percussion, consisting of claps and a kick drum.

The 10-inch vinyl record was a limited edition of 1,000 copies, and money from sales of the vinyl were donated to mental health website MindFreedom.org. Critical reception Reviews of Just Once from music journalists were generally positive. Consequence of Sound wrote that \\"Giving the Just Once EP a listen should quell any doubts regarding his versatility, because it's almost like hearing How to Dress Well again for the first time.\\" Beats per Minute praised that there were much less filters on Krell's vocals on the EP than on Love Remains, which better showcased his singing ability. Fact magazine's Tam Gunn gave a similar praise, writing that \\"Krell's voice is more exposed than ever, and he excels under this pressure to an astonishing degree.\\" He also called \\"Suicide Dream 3\\" one of the best How to Dress Well tracks ever made, describing it as \\"staggering: a chalk-coloured lament that‚Äôs flattening and addictive in equal measures\\". The 405 wrote that \\"the song craft on show here throughout ensures that each of the tracks have enough about them to stand up as pretty great songs in their own right and not just as a disposable one-off listen for when you‚Äôre feeling down.\\" A review by The A.V. Club writer Evan Rytlewski felt Krell's voice was better off hiding in many effects, writing that \\"He wails in a gaunt falsetto that's continually stretched just past its range, and the effect is something like Flaming Lips‚Äô Wayne Coyne singing Prince in the shower.\\" The review was still positive; Rytlewski wrote that the tracks \\"reveal how harmonically rich those Love Remains songs were under all their static\\" and that \\"it's a marvel, in retrospect, how Krell condensed such oversized melodies into such scruffy recordings.\\" Coke Machine Glow summarized the record's move from Love Remains towards a more quality recording style as an \\"interesting but ultimately disappointing experiment\\", writing that all of the tracks \\"lack something abstract but necessary\\". Pitchfork described it as \\"a potential argument that How to Dress Well is best in short four- or five-song bursts, the way the first few EPs arrived-- you get the feeling Krell's songs evoke for 18 or 20 minutes, and then you move on.\\" Track listing All tracks written by Tom Krell, arranged by Minna Choi, recorded and mixed by Nic Atamaniuk at Different Fur Studios and mastered by Pete Swanson.

The anonymous work was found at the Faras Cathedral within old Nubia in present- day Sudan. The painting was discovered by a Polish archaeological team during a campaign undertaken in the 1960s under the patronage of UNESCO (the Nubian Campaign) in Faras. Since 1964 the painting is in the collection of the National Museum in Warsaw. It is presented in Room VI of the Faras Gallery. The image of Saint Anne has been used as a logo of the National Museum in Warsaw.  The painting in its original setting  The wall painting of Saint Anne has been found in situ on the wall of the north nave, 3 metres from the floor level. It was painted on the first layer of plaster and was covered by its second layer, featuring a composition of Queen Martha. The northern nave at the Faras Cathedral may have been dedicated for women. The image of Saint Anne was not the only image of a woman presented there ‚Äì this area of the Cathedral contained images of founders, saints, queens, martyrs, mothers and healers. Many of these depictions were probably aimed at private prayer.  Iconography  Saint Anne is a painting preserved in a fragment: it depicts the head and shoulders of the saint, as well as the upper part of her right hand held to her lips. It is possible the full painting depicted the entire figure of Saint Anne ‚Äì standing or seated. = The image of Saint Anne = According to Kazimierz Micha≈Çowski, the saint is dressed in a purple , a type of hooded cloak. The folds of the hood are marked in black. The inside of the hood is light yellow, and its folds light purple. The face of Saint Anne is elongated, her nose long and straight, highlighted with a black, curved contour. The saint's eyes are wide open, with black, large irises encircled with black and purple; lower eyelids painted in light purple, and upper lids in dark purple. Anne's head is painted without a halo, an unusual omission for a portrait of a saint. Her hands are slim, with long fingers painted in light yellow with a purple contour. Her right hand is supporting her face, and the index finger with a visible fingernail is laid on her lips. = The iconography of Saint Anne and literary sources = Canonical sources do not mention Saint Anne; instead, she is mentioned in the Gospel of James ‚Äì part of the Biblical apocrypha from between the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE written in Greek and translated into many eastern and western languages. She also appears in the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew and many other apocryphal texts. These texts describe events related to the birth and childhood of Virgin Mary, and are modelled on the Old Testament, in which the births of biblical patriarchs are described as the result of divine intervention to defeat women's infertility. Saint Anne and her husband, saint Joachim, a devout Jew from the family of David, were childless, which in the Jewish society of the time was seen as shameful. Thanks to prayers and the faith in God's power Anne has conceived and given birth to a daughter, who later became mother to Jesus. Anna and Joachim were later called Theopatores - God's ancestors.  Veneration of Saint Anne in Nubia  Saint Anne is believed to have been venerated in Nubia. It was firstly related to her being the mother of Mary, and so an ancestor to Christ. B. Mierzejewska believes that Nubian women prayed to Saint Anne due to the miraculous conception of her daughter, hoping to gain her support and granting their requests related to childbearing, the health of children, pregnancy and welfare of mothers and children. = Other images of Saint Anne in Nubia =  The second painting of Saint Anne at Faras Cathedral  The veneration of Mary's mother may be confirmed by the placement of another image of saint Anne on the second layer of plaster in the same nave. The second image is painted later and depicts the saint seated on a throne with baby Mary on her lap, perhaps in a breastfeeding position. The preserved fragment of that painting is in the collection of the National Museum of Sudan in Khartoum.  The image of Saint Anne at Abdallah Nirki  The depiction of Saint Anne was also discovered at a church in Abdallah Nirki near Faras. That painting depicts Anne standing. The painting was found in the north nave of a local church.  Symbolism of Anne's gesture  Saint Anne of Faras is the only known depiction of this saint making a gesture of placing a finger on her lips. There are several interpretations of the symbolism of this gesture. It may be a command to remain quiet and silent. It may relate to the \\"God's silence\\", in which, according to Ignatius of Antioch three mysteries related to Mary took place: a miraculous conception, virginity and the birth of the Messiah. Another theory suggests that the gesture relates to prayer. In Egyptian and Palestinian monastic groups and some heretical groups a custom existed of praying quietly while holding a finger of the right hand on one's lips; it was believed this gesture protected people from evil, which might otherwise prevail in human hearts during prayer.  Inscription  The painting features an inscription. Both vertical registers are incomplete. According to S. Jakobielski the content of the inscription is: Saint Anne, mother to the Mother of God. Saint and... Jakobielski offers two theories on the ending of the inscription: Saint and Mary, or Saint and the Mother of Mary; the second version is coherent with the principles of reading the left vertical register before the other lines. One of the words of the inscription has been presented as a monogram representative of the period, used also in Byzantine painting.

Marselis Hotel is a four star hotel (2016) and is member of the Danish hotel organization Horesta. Marselis Hotel was the culmination of almost a century of efforts to have a hotel established in the Marselisborg Forests. In 1965 the local master mason Anker Jakobsen bought the half- timbered Frydenlund house which used to be home to the local park ranger. Jakobsen was deeply engaged in the project and demanded that all bricks be handmade rather than factory produced. The hotel was completed in 1967 and operated until 2001 when it was bought by the hotel chain Helnan International Hotels, founded by Enan Galaly. After 2001 the hotel faced a large renovation and expansion in a modern and maritime style.  Architecture  Marselis Hotel has a unique location, very close to the shore, on a hill in a forest. The building is designed to take advantage of the location and surroundings, designed as a number of connected buildings with shifting heights. The buildings are dug into the hill it is constructed on so there are 3 floors on the side facing the coast but only two on the side facing the forest. The two top floors are designed with rooms for guests while the bottom floor is for restaurant and conference facilities. All guest rooms feature large windows facing the Bay of Aarhus. In contrast to the airy facade of the water-side, the land-side of the buildings have a closed-off appearance with small circular windows to the corridors and hallways. The main entrance is placed in a connecting building that connects the newer hotel to an older villa that now functions as offices. Originally the hotel consisted of 3 wings but since 2001 a fourth has been added. The buildings are made of coffee-brown bricks, handmade so no two are alike, and the floor in the foyer is covered in ceramic tiles. The materials are symptomatic for the detailed workmanship and simple furnishings in one of the finest examples of Brutalist architecture in Denmark. The responsible architects was the architecture firm Friis & Moltke which has built a number of other brutalist structures in Aarhus.

A women's rights activist, she cofounded the Taiwanese Communist Party. Persecuted by the Kuomintang, she escaped to China, where she became a member of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League and the Communist Party of China. Biography Xie was born in Changhua County in 1901 to a working class family, the fourth of seven children. She assumed at least seven other names throughout her lifetime. At the age of twelve, she moved in with another family. Her adoptive family was abusive, and, instead of entering an arranged marriage with their son, Hong Xinhu, she left their home. Xie met and married Zhang Shumin in 1918. For a time, the couple lived in Kobe, Japan, where the Taish≈ç period of democracy heavily influenced Xie. Soon after Xie and Zhang moved to China, the couple split, as Xie had discovered that Zhang was still married to another woman. Xie then began to give sewing lessons, while also making and selling clothes. The May Fourth Movement was a political turning point for Xie, and she later joined Chiang Wei-shui's resistance against Japanese rule. Xie studied sociology at Shanghai University and took part in the May Thirtieth Movement of 1925, the same year she was told to join the Communist Party of China, but there were questions about the legality of her party membership. Xie then moved to Moscow for further education. In 1927, she returned to China and helped found the Taiwanese Communist Party in 1928. Xie's ideology spread to Chiang's Taiwanese People's Party and Taiwanese Cultural Association after she took on leadership positions in the two groups. She believed that a maintaining a distinct Taiwanese identity and allowing bourgeoisie to participate would allow communism to flourish in Taiwan. Others disagreed and Xie was expelled from the Taiwanese Communist Party in 1931. Later that year, she was arrested and sentenced to 13 years imprisonment for advocating communism. In 1939, Xie was released after catching tuberculosis. Alt URL Xie returned to political activism in 1945, when Kuomintang forces arrived in Taiwan, stating that \\"Taiwan must be ruled by Taiwanese.\\" In September 1946, Xie established the Taiwan People‚Äôs Association, which was disestablished by the Kuomintang government in January 1947. In 1947, she convened the 27 Brigade and was involved in the February 28 incident from her home base in Taichung, telling the masses not to damage property or injure anyone. Three weeks later, she escaped to Hong Kong, where she founded the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, and later moved to Xiamen. Under Xie's leadership, the league opposed the aims of the Formosan League for Reemancipation, which backed formal independence or trusteeship. At its founding, Taimeng backed liberation of Taiwan from the control of Chiang Kai- shek and the Kuomintang. In China, Xie was active in the China Youth League and served on the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. However, Xie continued to push for Taiwan's right to self-determination, views for which the Chinese Communist Party targeted her during the Anti-Rightist Movement. Xie died in Beijing in 1970, a victim of the Cultural Revolution. She was posthumously rehabilitated by the Communist Party of China in 1986.

It outlines their vision for the nation were they to win the election. Content The contents of the book include summary-style policy points, photographs of the two authors campaigning, various charts, and excerpts from some of the speeches that Clinton has delivered. The book's presentation style is similar to that of a PowerPoint presentation. The book is broken into three main sections: #Growing Together ‚Äì proposals for the economy #Safer Together ‚Äì proposals regarding national security #Standing Together ‚Äì proposals and beliefs regarding domestic life and policy. Both authors wrote brief introductions that detailed how some of their early upbringing has affected their current worldview. Each author also wrote a conclusion regarding personal reflections about the efforts they would make if elected. Publication The work is of the \\"campaign book\\" genre. As The New York Times described it, \\"Candidates often release hurriedly-written books during their campaigns, often aimed at spreading their message and attracting publicity, rather than topping the best-seller charts.\\" Announcement of the book was first made on August 4, 2016. The publisher, Simon & Schuster, had put out all five of Clinton's previous books. In part, publication of the book was intended to highlight what the authors saw as the policy richness of Clinton's 2016 campaign, and the Clinton-Kaine team's readiness to assume office, in contrast to Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, which was seen by writers for CNN and The Washington Post as comparatively \\"policy- light\\". Upon its release, which with its September 6 publication date came later in the election cycle than usual for books of this ilk, Clinton told reporters that the book was intended to be \\"our blueprint for America's future. We wanted voters to be able to find, in one easy place, all of the various plans and policies that I've been talking about throughout this campaign.\\" Kaine emphasized that the book had a positive message about the country's future, unlike what he said was the pessimistic vision put forth by Trump's 2015 book Crippled America. The campaign chose the slogan and title \\"Stronger Together\\" from 85 possibilities; it was used on the campaign aircraft, campaign bus, and in a series of policy speeches. Critical reaction Amazon.com user reviews of the book became an immediate battleground between Clinton opponents and sympathizers, with Amazon staff removing large numbers of negative reviews that were judged the work of Internet trolls. Critical reaction to the book has been largely negative. Carlos Lozada, the nonfiction book critic for The Washington Post, wrote: \\"By the time I finished this book, I resented its existence. [... It] is a self- confessed cut-and-paste job of campaign fact sheets, speeches and op-eds. That sets rather modest expectations. Yet, even by that standard, and the low bar for candidates' campaign books overall, 'Stronger Together' is an embarrassment, sloppy, repetitive, dutiful and boring.\\" The review ended with a plea against the \\"campaign book genre\\" as a whole. Alex Shephard, a news editor at The New Republic, wrote that: \\"It is a very bad book and there is absolutely no reason for it to exist. Sixteen dollars for a glorified platform is preposterous when you can get all of the information in the book‚Äîmost of which means next to nothing‚Äîfor free online. It begins vacuously (its first two sentences are: 'It has been said that America is great because America is good. We agree.') and doesn't get better from there.\\" Anna Silman, a writer on culture for New York magazine, said that the book can be characterized by \\"its Serif-heavy font, kitschy imagery, and [...] absence of good taste\\". A headline in The Christian Science Monitor read, \\"Are all campaign books awful? Clinton's certainly doesn't buck the trend\\". Politics reporter Evan Halper of the Los Angeles Times was less caustic, saying of the volume, \\"the minutiae is the point. The political aim of the book is less to be a gripping page turner than to make the case that Donald Trump doesn't even have the material to publish such a book if he were so inclined.\\" Writing for CNN, senior producer Edward Mejia Davis compared the book to a similar effort by Bill Clinton and Al Gore, Putting People First: How We Can All Change America, put out during their 1992 campaign. Davis concluded that the comparison revealed a leftward drift in the Democratic Party during the intervening 24 years. Sales Although both Clinton and Kaine promoted the new work in their campaign rallies, the book's initial sales were quite modest, selling fewer than 3,000 copies in its first week of availability. The Times said the figure \\"firmly makes the book what the publishing industry would consider a flop.\\" Any proceeds from the book were slated to go to charity.

While this super genre's roots are seen in classic, pastoral, magical realism, animal metamorphoses, science fiction, and other genres, the term ecofiction did not become popular until the 1970s when various movements created the platform for an explosion of environmental and nature literature, which also inspired ecocriticism. Ecocriticism is the study of literature and the environment from an interdisciplinary point of view, where literature scholars analyze texts that illustrate environmental concerns and examine the various ways literature treats the subject of nature. Environmentalists have claimed that the human relationship with the ecosystem often went unremarked in earlier literature. According to Jim Dwyer, author of Where the Wild Books Are: A Field Guide to Ecofiction, \\"My criteria for determining whether a given work is ecofiction closely parallel Lawrence Buell's\\": * The nonhuman environment is present not merely as a framing device but as a presence that begins to suggest that human history is implicated in natural history. * The human interest is not understood to be the only legitimate interest. * Human accountability to the environment is part of the text's ethical orientation. * Some sense of the environment as a process rather than as a constant or a given is at least implicit in the text.'  Definitions and explanations  \\"The terms 'environmental fiction,' 'green fiction,' and 'nature-oriented fiction,' might better be considered as categories of ecofiction....[Ecofiction] deals with environmental issues or the relation between humanity and the physical environment, that contrasts traditional and industrial cosmologies, or in which nature or the land has a prominent role‚Ä¶[It is] made up of many styles, primarily modernism, postmodernism, realism, and magical realism, and can be found in many genres, primarily mainstream, westerns, mystery, romance, and speculative fiction. Speculative fiction includes science fiction and fantasy, sometimes mixed with realism, as in the work of Ursula K. Le Guin.\\" -Jim Dwyer [Ibid. Chapter 2.] \\"Stories set in fictional landscapes that capture the essence of natural ecosystems....[They] can build around human relationships to these ecosystems or leave out humans altogether. The story itself, however, takes the reader into the natural world and brings it alive...Ideally the landscape and ecosystems--whether fantasy or real--should be as \\"realistic\\" as possible and plot constraints should accord with ecological principles.\\" -Mike Vasey The distinction of true and false ecofiction was made by Diane Ackerman. \\"Often in fiction nature has loomed as a monstrous character, an adversary dishing out retribution for moral slippage, or as a nightmare region of chaos and horror where fanged beasts crouch ready to attack. But sometimes it beckons as a zone of magic, mysticism, inspiration, and holy conversion. \\"False ecofiction is based on the fear that something will go wrong, but true ecofiction is based on an integrative view of reality.\\" -Gabriel Navarre Another perspective is that ecofiction is not divided between true and false, but into three categories: \\"Works that portray the environmental movement and/or environmental activism, works that depict a conflict over an environmental issue and express the author's beliefs, and works that feature environmental apocalypse.\\" -Patricia D. Netzley \\"Ecofiction is an elastic term, capacious enough to accommodate a variety of fictional works that address the relationship between natural settings and the human communities that dwell within them. The term emerged soon after ecology took hold as a popular scientific paradigm and a broad cultural attitude in the 1960s and 1970s.\\" -Jonathan Levin \\"Ecofiction forms a literature-based path towards an invigorated understanding of nature's place in human life and is part of a new phase in nature writing that seeks to include a modern consciousness in narratives of place. The Hopper believes that in order to refashion our lives to accommodate the knowledge we have of our environmental crisis, we have a lot of cultural heavy lifting to do. To reacquaint ourselves meaningfully with the natural world we have to turn our interpretive, inquisitive, and inspired faculties upon it.\\" Dede Cummings, Green Writers Press Ashland Creek Press often states that \\"ecofiction is fiction with a conscience.\\" -John Yunker  Characteristics  Given that \\"Ecocriticism seems to be inherently interdisciplinary, cross-cultural, syncretic, holistic, and evolutionary in its nature,\\" it would seem useful to apply these traits to the large field of literature that is ecofiction, especially given its history, reach, and continuity. Interdisciplinary and holistic: Ecofiction can be seen as an umbrella for, or laterally relative to, many genres and subgenres and works well within the parameters of the main categories of speculative fiction, contemporary fiction, Anthropocene fiction, climate fiction, literary fiction, eco-futurist and solarpunk fictions, magical realism, ecological weird fiction, and more. Further, while ecofiction is \\"fiction with a conscience,\\" per John Yunker, as shown above, it reveals integrity in the concern for our natural world as well as what can be found on numerous storytelling platforms: mystery, thriller, suspense, romance, dystopian, apocalyptic and post- apocalyptic, Arcadian, futuristic, crime, detective, and so on. Given the upstream and downstream effects of such issues as climate change, fracking, coal mining, animal justice, pollution, deforestation, and so on, this branch of fiction is not inclusive and has no demarcation other than the environmental and nature impacts by which it is defined and explained. Cross- cultural and syncretic: Ecofiction is written by authors all over the world. Environmental issues, the desire to protect our natural ecological systems, and the praise of nature is an all-encompassing intention of many authors, which crosses all borders, languages, ethnicities, and belief systems. Many ecofiction novels incorporate LGBT and other egalitarian social issues that mirror sustainable, peaceful, and just environmental futures. Developing: Dwyer's field guide has hundreds of examples of ecofiction across time, from the roots and precursors---the earliest cave drawings, pastoral and classic, etc.--up through the 21st century. The continuity goes on. In May 2017, writing in The New York Times, Yale scholar Wai Chee Dimock reviewed Jeff VanderMeer's novel Borne and said, \\"This coming-of-age story signals that eco- fiction has come of age as well: wilder, more reckless and more breathtaking than previously thought, a wager and a promise that what emerges from the 21st century will be as good as any from the 20th, or the 19th.\\" Two months later, The Association for the Study of Literature and Environment's (ASLE) 17th biennial conference focused on ecofiction as one of its main streams. Ecofiction continues to be alive and relevant, evolving into contemporary study and a way of thinking about new literature. Ecofiction, true to its evolutionary nature, encapsulates the most recent of our environmental crises: climate change. By the time Dwyer's big field study was published in 2010, already climate change had been engaging authors to write cautionary or disaster tales for a few decades. In his field guide, Dwyer cited such examples of climate change fiction as The Swarm and The Day After Tomorrow‚Äîalso noting that \\"Ecofiction rarely fares well in escapist Hollywood.\\" [Ibid. p. 92.] The first anthropogenic global warming (AGW) novel may have been Arthur Herzog's Heat, published in 1977, though plenty of novels up until then imagined or speculated climate change or events. While ecofiction has included AGW fiction since the 1970s, the past decade has also introduced newer specific genres to handle climate change, such as climate fiction, Anthroprocene fiction, and solarpunk. Thus, true to the evolutionary characteristic of ecofiction, from early pastoralism to modern science's understanding of global warming, hundreds of authors have taken up the issue of climate change in the least as a backdrop to their novels or, more heavily, as a moral, didactic cautionary tale centering around this foreboding, current, and very real environmental catastrophe. An environmental fiction database lists hundreds of climate and other novels falling into the ecofiction genre.  History  While the term \\"ecofiction\\" is contemporary, as of the 1970s, its precursors are ancient and include many First People's fictionalizing nature in written form, including pictograms, petroglyphs, and creation myths. Classical literature, such as Ovid's Metamorphoses and Latin pastoral literature, continued this exaltation of nature as did Medieval European literature, such as Arthurian lore and Shakespeare's tales, followed by Romanticism, traditional pastoralism, and transcendentalism. Dwyer notes that Kenneth Grahame's The Wind and The Willows, as well as many nonfiction authors, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, John Burroughs, Margaret Fuller, and John Muir, had \\"strong influences on modern ecological thought, environmentalism, and ecofiction.\\" Up through the late 19th century, classics such as Herman Melville's Moby Dick, Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, H.G. Wells' The Island of Dr. Moreau, W.H. Hudson's A Crystal Age, and Sarah Orne Jewett's The White Heron and Other Stories and The Country of Pointed Firs, among many others, had eco-themes. In the 20th and 21st centuries, nature-related fiction evolved and continued, including eco- feminist fiction writers such as Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Mary Austin. Four \\"radical\\" authors also came on the scene: Jack London, D.H. Lawrence, B. Traven, and Upton Sinclair. Environmental science fiction also became popular from authors like Laurence Manning, George Orwell, William Golding, and Aldous Huxley. Regional environmentalists and authors, such as Zora Neale Hutson, William Faulkner, and John Steinbeck, also wrote about problems in their locales. Conservationists and environmentalists, such as Wallace Stegner and George R. Stewart, also contributed. J.R.R. Tolkien's mythology classics went down into history showing famous and iconic battles of industrialization vs. nature. Postwar ecofiction writers arrived too, such as science fiction authors who were cautionary about the environment: Clifford Simak, Jack Vance, Ray Bradbury, and Kurt Vonnegut, to name a few. Enter Peter Matthiessen and Edward Abbey, which Dwyer says are \\"arguably the most important and enduring new green voices to emerge in this period.\\" And others, such as Jack Kerouac, Gary Snyder, and Michael McClure, represented \\"presentations of the nascent environmental consciousness of the Beat movement.\\" [Ibid.] This brings us up to the 1970s, when, as Dwyer points out, \\"ecofiction in all genres truly flourished...which might be considered the d√©cada de oro (golden age),\\" heralded by John Stadler's anthology Eco-fiction, containing science and mainstream ecofiction written between the 1920s and 1960s. [Ibid.] Eco- fiction, the anthology, starts with this premise: \\"The earth is an eco-system. It possesses a collective memory. Everything that happens, no matter how insignificant it may seem, affects in some way at some time the existence of everything else within that system. Eco-fiction raises important questions about man's place in the system: Will man continue to ignore the warnings of the environment and destroy his source of life? Will he follow the herd into the slaughterhouse?\\" The anthology included the authors Ray Bradbury, John Steinbeck, Edgar Allan Poe, A. E. Coppard, James Agee, Robert M. Coates, Daphne du Maurier, Robley Wilson Jr., E. B. White, J. F. Powers, Kurt Vonnegut Jr., Sarah Orne Jewett, Frank Herbert, H. H. Munro, J. G. Ballard, Steven Scharder, Isaac Asimov, and William Saroyan. Dwyer stated that the title of Stadler's Eco-fiction was his first knowledge of the term ecofiction. [Ibid.] Jonathan Levin goes on to explain, \\"Two key events helped spark this new environmental awareness [leading to ecofiction]: the controversy surrounding proposed dams on the Colorado River that led ultimately to the construction of the Glen Canyon Dam (begun in the mid-1950s and completed about ten years later), and the 1962 publication of Silent Spring, Rachel Carson's expos√© of the environmental impact of toxic pesticides like DDT. Both generated widespread media coverage, bringing complex and urgent environmental issues and the ecological vocabularies that helped explain them into the American lexicon.\\"  Social impact  Ecofiction is often said to be an agent for social change. For example, in 2016, the World Economic Forum's Rosamund Hutt listed \\"9 novels that changed the world.\\" Among these were two novels that may be considered ecofiction, including John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath (about the dust bowl, which was caused by farmers failing to use smart ecological principles) and Upton Sinclair's The Jungle (about Chicago's meat- packing industry). Both novels reached far and wide, and are considered to be among the classics of social change novels. Researchers have recently begun to empirically examine the influence of environmentally engaged literature on its readers. For example, scholars have found that literary fiction can make readers more concerned about animal welfare and climate change and raise awareness of environmental injustice.

His life is obscured because many people named Manchan are found among the monastically-inclined Medieval Irish Christians, and the name is a diminutive of , . Manchan probably died of famine during volcanic winters caused by the extreme weather events of 535‚Äì536, which preceded the 6th century Justinian plague of Mohill. The Shrine of Manchan is a remarkable and unique example of Irish Urnes style art, adapted to Ringerike style, skillful in design and execution. Saint Manchan's feast day is celebrated 14 February by Orthodox Catholics, Roman Catholics, and Anglicans. Life The life of Manchan of Mohill is clouded by obscurity and his genealogy widely debated. The multiplicity of Saints named suggests the name is a diminutive of () . Some sources identify him as Manchan of Mondrehid, a claim challenged, but many others identify him with Manchan of Lemanaghan . An exiled \\"Manchan the Master\\" at the monastery of Mawgan named in the \\"life of David of Wales\\" flourished before Manchan of Mohill. John Colgan decided \\"that for want of authentic documents to prove the contrary, he must consider them as different persons\\" as feasts and chronologies disagree. On the authority of Colgan, and the scribes of Iona Abbey who recorded his death as 538 AD in the Annals of Tigernach, must be considered a distinct \\"Manchan\\", born in Ireland or Wales and flourishing . He belonged to the \\"first order of Patrician clergy\\", active missionary priests accompanying or following Saint Patrick, typically Britons or Irish ordained by him and his successors. Chronologies of the earliest Irish christian tradition have Manchan allied to , contemporary with Saint Berchan and Saint Sinchell the elder (died 549), and a successor of Caill√≠n at Fenagh. Manchan of Mohill, uniquely among Mainch√≠ns, founded many early Christian churches, alluded to by the Martyrology of Donegal as \\"\\" (meaning ), and the Martyrology of Gorman as \\"\\" (\\"\\"). When or where he commenced his religious course is unknown. However the translator of the Annals of Clonmacnoise disbelievingly recorded \\"the Coworbes of Saint Manchan [at Lemanaghan] say that he was a Welshman and came to this kingdom at one with Saint Patrick\\". Persons of this name from Wales include () mentioned in the \\"11th-century life of Cadoc\\" of Llancarfan in Glamorganshire, and Mannacus of Holyhead whose feast day falls on 14 October. The sanctity of Manch√°n of Mohill is recorded. The Mostyn Manuscript No. 88 in the National Library of Wales records several festivals including the 14 February festival of Manchan of Mohill. The \\"Martyrology of Donegal\\" records \\" Mainchein, of Moethail\\", and the \\"Martyrology of Gorman\\" notes \\"Manch√©in of Moethail, Feb. 14\\". The Irish Annals identify , uniquely among all Mainch√≠ns, as the Saint whose relics are venerated by the \\"Shrine of Manchan of Moethail\\", perhaps jointly. Churches Inisnag‚ÄìWales? Confirmed Manchan of Mohill church sites are ‚Äì * (Monastery of Maothail-Manachan) in county Leitrim, founded by Manchan in the 6th century. * (), County Kilkenny- Founded by Manchan in the 5th or 6th century. Probable church sites of Manchan of Mohill would include- * (, \\"Manchan's church\\") in County Kilkenny, is of the Monastery of Inis-Snaig. * (, \\"Grey place of Manchan\\") in County Offaly- Persistent claims Manchan of Mohill moved to Lemanaghan in folklore, is made more plausible by dendrochronological dating suggesting a possibility of an earlier 5th or 6th century church here at Lemanaghan. O'Donovan, and others, believed Manchan of Mohill founded Lemanaghan church. * (, \\"Manchan's church\\") in County Offaly is associated with \\"Manchan of Mohill/Lemanaghan\\" by folklore. * (, 'great grey place') in County Tipperary. The \\"Book of Fenagh\\" claims Manchan of Mohill went here, and the \\"Irish Litanies\\" names a \\"\\". * (, \\"Manchan's church\\") in County Waterford, lies of Inisnag in Kilkenny, and Liath Mh√≥ir in Tipperary. Conjectural church locations of Manchan of Mohill might include- * () in Laois- O'Hanlon, Ware, and Ussher claim Manchan of Mohill founded the church. * Wales- The \\"Coarbs of Lemanaghan\\" claimed Manchan was Welshman who arrived with Saint Patrick. Famine and death A man lying dead, from the plague, church and flames in background The Irish Annals record a cluster of deaths for person(s) named Mochta (died 534 or 535), Mocta/Mauchteus (d. 537), and Manch√°n (d. 538). These entries could correlate to the one person, but one entry is unequivocal- \\"AD 538: Manch√°n of Maethail fell ()\\". Manch√°n probably died as a result of famines caused by the extreme weather events of 535-536. The Irish Annals cite the weather events, and resulting famine, as \\"the failure of bread\\" giving the years 536AD, , and 539AD. Christian veneration of Manch√°n The 6th-century events probably had significant impact on Christianity across Ireland, the dramatic events perhaps illustrating the divinity and sanctity of Manch√°n to his followers. The remains of Manchan were probably preserved for a long time in the Monastery of Maothail-Manachan before being enshrined. =Protection from plague= Manch√°n was probably venerated for considering his 538 death during worldwide famine, and preceded a deadly plague at Mohill. =Kilkenny= In County Kilkenny, Manchan of Mohill is recorded as patron saint of the ancient monastery at Ennisnag. Nearby, Kilmanaheen townland preserves his name. =Leitrim= In county Leitrim, Manch√°n is venerated as patron saint of parish since the foundation of the Monastery of Maothail-Manachan and the Justinian plague of Mohill. John O'Donovan visiting 19th century Mohill, claimed \\"Monahan's (or St. Manchan's) Well is still shown there\\", though the location of his holy well is forgotten. From 1935 to 2015 the GAA football park in Mohill, which officially opened on 8 May 1939, was called after him. Mohill GAA teams preserve his name. St Manchan's Primary School in Mohill, costing 2.5m was opened in 2010. Manch√°n's fair (Monaghan day) Until the late 20th century, the renowned festival of Manch√°n, was held in Mohill each year on the feast day of the Saint, or rather on the \\"Twenty fifth of February\\". The date of the ancient fair of Manch√°n moved to in the New Calendar from 14 February in the Old Calendar, . The plot of the acclaimed novel by John McGahern, titled \\"Amongst Women\\", revolves around \\"Monaghan day\\" in Mohill, county Leitrim. The fair day was also infamous as the backdrop for organized faction fights in the 19th century. =Shrine of Manch√°n= In the 12th century, \\"Ruaidr√≠ Ua Conchobair commenced his reign by creating shrines for the relics of St. Manchan of Moethail\\" and Saint Comman of Roscommon. The Annals of the Four Masters states \\"AD 1166: The shrine of Manchan, of Maethail was covered by Ruaidr√≠ Ua Conchobair, and an embroidering of gold was carried over it by him, in as good a style as a relic was ever covered in Ireland\\". His shrine () could be a lost relic, but is likely identical to the Shrine associated with Manch√°n of Lemanaghan despite being named as the saint being venerated. The shrine of Manchan is an impressive box of yew wood with gilted bronze and enamel fittings, a house-shaped shrine in the form of a gabled roof, originally covered with silver plates of which traces still remain. It stands 19 inches tall, covering a space dimensioned , raised by short legs and clearing the ground surface by two and a half inches. The legs slot into metal shoes, attached to metal rings probably to be attached to carrying-poles when the shrine was leading a procession. Animal patterns of beasts and serpent fill the bosses and borders of the shrine, and one side has a decorative equal-armed cross with bosses. The animal ornament on the principal faces of the relic reveals influences of adapted to Ringerike style. The reincarnation of centuries-old Irish metalworking techniques, such as the juxtaposition of red and yellow enamel, is seen on the shrine, and the Cross of Cong. Before the Vikings there were already varied ethnic types in Ireland, and a long disappearing \\"Mediterranean\\" stratum of architecture and costume identifiable as \\"Iberian\\" is evidenced by the Shrine of Manchan and the Book of Kells. Hewson, referring to theories of Charles Piazzi Smyth, observed the two upper compartments would have held two groups of six figurines and the two lower compartments held two groups of seven figurines, and the total represented a monthly cycle of 26 days divided into two cycles. Shrine of Manchan, ten figures on front, incl. Olaf II of Norway, with axe Illustration, replica shrine of Manchin The ten figures adorning the shrine are newer, probably 13th century. It is believed the half-round cast-bronze figure carrying an axe on the Manchan Shine, is an early representation of Olaf II of Norway (Saint Olaf), considering the sub-Viking context of the art, and iconographical association of a man with axe. In 1861, an \\"appliqu√©\\" figure of gilt, cast copper-alloy, high, wide, and thickness, was reportedly found at the grave- yard of Clonmacnoise, and presented with a short beard and moustache, a pointed decorated hat covering his ears, hands flat on his bare chest, with a pleated decorated kilt, one missing leg, and was very similar those remaining on the shrine of Manchan, so is assumed to have fallen off. Margaret Stokes claimed a robed figurine holding a book, found buried near Saint John's Abbey at Thomas Street, Dublin, bears resemblance to the Manchan shrine figures, but \\"of much finer workmanship and evidently earlier date\\", but unfortunately she fails to expand further. The dress and personal adornment of lay and chieftain costume of 13th-century Irish people is reflected by the figures. The wearing of the \\"celt\\" (anglicized \\"kilt\\", pron. 'kelt'), similar to the present-day Scottish highland kilt, was very common in Ireland, and all figures on the shrine of Manch√°n have highly long ornamented, embroidered, or pleated, \\"kilts\\" reaching below their knees, as kilts were probably worn by both ecclesiastical and laypersons. The wearing of full beards () was only acceptable for the higher classes (nobles, chiefs, warriors), and it was disgraceful to present with hair and beard trimmed short. Reflecting this, all the shrine of Manch√°n figures have beards cut rectangularly, or Assyrian style, usually with no moustache. shrine of Saint Manchan, front shrine of Saint Manchan, back shrine of Saint Manchan, end The technical and stylistic similarities to the \\"Cross of Cong group\\", confirms without doubt the shrine of Manchan was crafted at the \\"well-defined and original\\" fine-metal workshop active in twelfth century county Roscommon. The shrine was likely commissioned by Bishop \\"Domnall mac Flannacain Ui Dubthaig\\", of Elphin, one of the richest episcopal see's in Medieval Ireland, and created by the master gold-craftsman named (\\"Mailisa MacEgan\\"), whom John O'Donovan believed was Abbot of Cloncraff in county Roscommon, though firm evidence for this identification is lacking. The founder and patron saint of this workshop, might have been St. Assicus of Elphin. Ruaidr√≠ Ua Conchobair was apparently patron of the relic, though it was monasteries rather than dioceses which commissioned metal reliquaries. The pertinent question is the sacral function and spiritual identity underlying the shrine. Keane suggested the shrine represents a \\"miniature Ark\\", an object to be carried on \\"men's shoulders\\", an emblem of death to Noah, and those enclosed in the Ark, with their release, on delivery of the Ark, celebrated as Resurrection. Another thought-provoking theory proposes the shrine had a political context, representing an attempt by royal patrons to visually cementing political alliances through the purposeful conflation of two neighbouring saints, both conveniently named \\"Manchan\\". Murray (2013) believes, the argument these reliquaries are multivalent is compelling, when necessary evidence is presented. * The shrine of Saint Manchan \\"is inventive\\", drawing on \\"a variety of traditions, including the archaic forms of the tomb- shrines to create a new and powerful statement of the saint's significance in the twelfth century\\". * \\"The crucified figure in the sculptures from a Persian Rock Temple may assist in explaining the mummy-like figures on the Irish shrine. The similarity of the design would seem to confirm the idea that the figures were intended to signify the inmates of the Ark, undergoing the process of mysterious death, which was supposed to be exhibited in Arkite ceremonies\\". * \\"There is a case for the equation of tent and shrine. \\"papilio\\", whence \\"pupall\\", is primarily the word for butterfly and came to mean tent from a physical resemblance, i.e. from the fact that the wings in two planes meet at an angle. The term .. Piramis (pyramis), literally \\"pyramid\\", and .. the presence of a bearer at each angle, is surely intended to suggest the Ark of the Covenant, a proto-reliquary; pyramis has more than one meaning or connotation .. I suggest that tent-shaped slab shrines were pyramides too\\". There is doubt to which Irish saint the shrine is dedicated. Stokes wondered if the Annals of the Four Masters identified the wrong Mainch√≠n. O'Hanlon and others felt a strong inference can be made that Manchan of Mohill and Manch√°n of Lemanaghan are identical. Graves suggested the shrine was transferred from Mohill for some unrecorded reason. In support of this theory, the English were suppressing Monasteries in Ireland from 1540, and Mohill was occupied by an \\"immense\\" English army. Confused folklore credits Mohill priests saving the shrine from iconoclasts by fleeing the Monastery of Mohill-Manchan to County Offaly- * \\"In 1621, when St. Manchan's monastery was suppressed, some of the fugitive monks succeeded in bringing the shrine back to Le-Manchan\\". * \\"When Mohill Abbey was destroyed in the twelfth century, the holy Shrine would have been carried back to Leamonaghan\\". The association with Clonmacnoise and Clonfert might also be strong as the smaller heads on the shrine (figurines dated 13th century) are considered similar to those \\"on the underside of the abaci of the chancel arch at the Nun's church, Clonmacnoise, and the portal at clonfert\\". Before 1590 the Shrine of Manchan was hidden somewhere in Ireland, and M√≠che√°l √ì Cl√©irigh writing recorded the shrine at Lemanaghan, then situated in an impassable bog. Today the shrine is preserved at Boher Catholic church in County Offaly. =Lost biography of Manchan= James Ussher claimed to have \\"Vita Manchan Mathail\\" (Life of St. Manchan of Mohill) written by Richard FitzRalph showing Manchan , a member of Canons Regular of Augustinian, patron of seven churches, and granted various glebes, lands, fiefs, and tithe to the Monastery of Mohill-Manchan since 608. However, there was no such thing as Canons Regular order of Augustinian, glebes, tithes back in the 5th‚Äì7th centuries, so these contemporary concepts would not illuminate the life of any Saint Manchan. John O'Donovan, James Henthorn Todd, and others, tried unsuccessfully to locate this book. Ussher's claims strongly influenced antiquarian speculation of his life story.

It is a ground orchid with flowers that are bright white on the front, but densely covered with black glands on the back. Description Caladenia atrata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb which usually grows in loose groups. It has an underground tuber and a single, sparsely hairy, linear, dark green leaf, long and about wide. Up to four flowers in diameter are borne on a thin, hairy, wiry spike high. The petals and sepals are bright white on the front and densely covered with black glands on the back. The dorsal sepal is long, wide and curves forward forming a hood over the column. The petals and lateral sepals are asymmetrically linear to lance-shaped, long and about wide. The labellum is long and about wide. It is white to pinkish with purple spots and a purple tip, and egg-shaped when flattened. It has three lobes and curves forward, the lateral lobes erect, surrounding the column. There are blunt teeth on the edge of the labellum and three or four rows of stalked, purplish calli along its mid-line. The column is about long and greenish with red blotches. Flowering occurs from late October to December. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia atrata was first formally described by David Jones in 1994 and the description was published in Muelleria. The type specimen was collected on a hill in the south-eastern suburbs of Hobart. The specific epithet (atrata) is a Latin word meaning \\"dressed in black\\" referring to the black on the outside of the flower. Distribution and habitat Dark caladenia is only known from southern areas of Tasmania where it grows on skeletal soils in stunted forest on hillsides.

She was the first Madonna brought to what is now the United States. The statuette is carved out of wood, and measures approximately three feet in height. A so-called secret society, La Cofrad√≠a de La Conquistadora, maintains, protects, and preserves the icon and her belongings. This confraternity is also responsible for maintaining the icon's chapel located in the north transept of the Basilica. The icon is dressed by the sacristana, or sacristan who maintains the vast wardrobe that includes clothing, veils, crowns, jewels and wigs. Cancer survivors often donate hair for use in fashioning wigs worn by the statue. The garments that the icon is clothed in are often sewn and donated by the faithful; all are rich in detail and very fine, often with elaborate designs. The estimate of her total outfits is close to 300. Even non-Catholics find occasion to honor the statue. For example, actress Ali MacGraw commissioned a piece that was displayed at Santa Fe's Spanish Colonial Museum in an exhibit about the icon mounted during 2010. The statue's origins are not well-known, but the 15th and 17th centuries are the most likely possibilities. Her arrival into America was made possible by the Spanish, who carried several versions of The Virgin Mary with them on their travels. There is a long history of armies carrying statues of saints into battle, for various purposes. Although the exact date of the statue's arrival in the New World is unknown, the Madonna was brought to New Mexico via Mexico City by priest Fray Alonso de Benavides, arriving in Santa Fe on January 25, 1626. Benavides wrote about this date in his journal, but the Archdiocese commonly uses the date of 1625. La Conquistadora was originally known as Our Lady of the Assumption. Each new generation gave The Virgin a new title, with the current title being given to her by Don Diego de Vargas after he had reclaimed the area of Santa Fe 12 years after the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. He believed that La Conquistadora would help him in battle and offer assistance against the Native Americans who controlled the land. To give thanks to La Conquistadora, the Fiesta de Santa Fe is now held every August, in which she is carried in procession to Rosario Chapel and solemn masses are held in her honor (novena masses). Another title was given to the statue in 1992, when then-Archbishop Robert Sanchez bestowed her with the name Our Lady of Peace.  Appearance  The statue of La Conquistadora is slightly less than three feet, at approximately 30 inches of height. She typically is adorned with a dark brown wig, which is often covered by a long veil. Sometimes the wig's length rivals her body's height. As she is a representation of the Virgin Mary, blue is frequently seen in her attire. The outfits that she has worn are numerous; records state that they are somewhere in the 300s. The color scheme of each outfit varies, but many are often blue and white with gold trimmings. She is sometimes adorned with a crown of gold, which possibly relates to the Assumption of the Madonna. As Mary passes on, she is taken to Heaven and given a golden crown for her position as queen of Heaven. Sometimes the statue holds a small figure of the infant Jesus Christ. Eskimo villagers in Holy Cross, Alaska gifted the statue with an ermine cape.  Origin  La Conquistadora's point of origin is still a topic of debate. Some scholars opine that her date of creation is unknown, but highly likely to be during the time of the Renaissance, which occurred from the 14th to 17th centuries. These scholars base this date on the fact that La Conquistadora holds a statue of an infant Jesus in her arms. They refer to the common depiction of the Maesta, also known as Madonna and Child, which was a popular subject for Renaissance artists to replicate and create, from Cimabue to Leonardo da Vinci. However, La Conquistadora does not always hold the infant, and the infant's provenance shows that it was made at a different time by a different carver, so the two statues may have been united by chance or circumstance. Sometimes La Conquistadora holds a rosary or an orb and cross. During Santa Fe's annual Indian Market each year, the statue is dressed with Native American attire, including a manta. Author Jaima Chevalier uncovered new information about the wood used to create the statue, and that information helps to pinpoint the time of origin using dendrochronology analysis from the University of Arizona. Chevalier's book on the topic reveals that church officials Fray Angelico Chavez and Pedro Ribera-Ortega were extremely instrumental in using modern techniques to date the wood used to make the statue. Further, Chevalier's book proves that the statue was made of two entirely different types of wood, making her provenance both mysterious and historically ambiguous.  Journey to America  While the Americas were still in the process of being colonized, La Conquistadora was brought from Mexico City by Fray Alonso de Benavides to Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico. This is when she referred to as Nuestra Se√±ora de La Asunci√≥n (Our Lady of the Assumption). Her role would be as a figure of comfort for new colonists. This role would be short-lived, however, once she would become the traveling companion of future governor Don Diego de Vargas. Renamed La Conquistadora, she was brought back from El Paso del Norte by de Vargas as he mounted a reconquest of New Mexico from the Pueblo peoples of the area. With carrying the statue on his travels, de Vargas hoped that the lands would be taken back in a relatively bloodless manner.  Fiesta de Santa Fe  Following her return to Santa Fe in 1693, a festival was enacted to celebrate the reclamation of the state. This annual thanksgiving procession continues today as the oldest Marian festival in the United States. La Conquistadora is carried in a procession from the Cathedral to Rosario Chapel, where masses are then held. Once the novena masses are concluded, the statue is brought back and Fiesta de Santa Fe festivities begin. Parades and mariachis are a common occurrence at the Festival. The highlight of the Fiesta de Santa Fe is the burning of ‚ÄúZozobra,\\" also known as \\"Old Man Gloom\\"‚Äîan imposing 50 foot tall puppet that represents the problems and hardships of the previous year. Zozobra was designed by artist Will Shuster.  Renaming  La Conquistadora was given a new name in 1992; then- Archbishop Robert Sanchez gave her the new title of Our Lady of Peace. The name change has been ascribed to the need to ameliorate the tensions between the Spanish and the original inhabitants of the New World. She is also invoked as Our Lady of Conquering Love, which captures the spirit of the original title La Conquistadora.

(Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division), revolving around the character of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they attempt a prison breakout. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. The episode was written by Nora and Lilla Zuckerman, and directed by Kate Woods. Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by series regulars Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, and Henry Simmons. The episode's story came from an unused pitch that Lilla Zuckerman made during the writing of the earlier episode \\"Uprising\\", about Ghost Rider breaking into a prison. It was filmed partly in a real prison and partly on constructed sets, and has a subplot inspired by the film Broadcast News that includes connections to the MCU film Captain America: Civil War. The episode is part of the first \\"pod\\" of eight episodes for the season, subtitled Ghost Rider. \\"Lockup\\" originally aired on ABC on October 25, 2016, and was watched by 4.55 million viewers within a week of its release. The episode received mostly positive reviews, with critics highlighting its action sequences, use of Ghost Rider, and character-focused moments such as those between Daisy Johnson (Bennet) and Melinda May (Wen), and between May and Coulson. The effects used for the episode's ghostly antagonists were criticized though.  Plot  After years of searching, scientists Joseph and Lucy Bauer discovered the Darkhold, the Book of Sin, and began to study it. Years later, S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Phil Coulson and Alphonso \\"Mack\\" MacKenzie question Joseph, who has just been woken up from a coma by the apparent ghost of Lucy. He tells them that Lucy has possession of the book, and dies. Coulson decides not to tell the new Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Jeffrey Mace, about this, not knowing if he can trust Mace yet. They decide to go get Eli Morrow, another scientist who was jailed for putting Joseph in the coma, out of prison. At the prison, Coulson and agent Melinda May find the staff have been turned against them by Lucy's ghostly influence. Defending themselves, they call Mack for backup. He arrives with Daisy Johnson / Quake‚Äîa rogue agent that has only recently joined back with the team‚Äîand Robbie Reyes / Ghost Rider‚Äîa demon-like vigilante and Morrow's nephew, as well as a newly developed antidote to Lucy's influence. Meanwhile, Mace is debating the anti- Inhuman Senator Ellen Nadeer on live television, who brings up the prison situation which he is not aware of. Faced with further questions from Nadeer, Mace reveals that he is an Inhuman himself. Lucy opens the prison cells, starting a riot, and Johnson fends off a large group of prisoners with help from May and Coulson even after trying to shut them out. Mack and Reyes find Morrow, who is hesitant to trust S.H.I.E.L.D. but agrees to leave with them when he hears that Lucy has the Darkhold. Morrow is directed to safety, while Reyes stops to confront one of the prisoners, a member of the gang who were responsible for him becoming the Ghost Rider. The prisoner reveals that they were hired to carry out the job, but does not know who by, before the Ghost Rider murders him. Outside the prison, Morrow is found by Lucy who needs his help to read the Darkhold and revert her ghostly state. May talks to Johnson about her recent isolationist approach to their group, and tries to convince her to rejoin S.H.I.E.L.D. and be with them, but Johnson insists that after the issue with the Darkhold is solved she will be leaving once again. Mace later meets with Nadeer in person, and she blackmails him with footage of S.H.I.E.L.D. working with the Ghost Rider.  Production  = Development and writing = In October 2016, Marvel revealed that the fifth episode of the season would be titled \\"Lockup\\". It is written by Nora and Lilla Zuckerman, with Kate Woods directing. The episode was the first of the series to be written by the Zuckermans, and is part of the first \\"pod\\" of eight episodes for the fourth season, subtitled Ghost Rider. The original idea for the episode came when the writers were helping break the story for the episode \\"Uprising\\", which includes large-scale blackouts. Lilla said that a blackout would be a perfect opportunity for Ghost Rider to break into a prison and murder criminals. The series' writers room all loved the idea of seeing Ghost Rider walking through a prison as all the inmates run back into their cells, but the situation did not fit into the episode. Several weeks later, when the room began discussing the fifth episode of the season, they had established that Ghost Rider's uncle Eli Morrow was in prison and from there decided to use the Ghost Rider prison break as the basis for the new episode. The writers wanted Daisy Johnson's story to be prominent in the episode since this is the first episode where she is working with the rest of the time during the season, and also realized that this was the first episode where Phil Coulson and Melinda May are together in a while so they wanted the episode to be an \\"awkward, tension-filled family reunion\\". Their script originally featured a heart-to-heart between Daisy Johnson and Phil Coulson, but executive producer Jed Whedon suggested that it instead be between Johnson and Melinda May, a change that Nora said \\"made the episode sing\\". Lilla said this change allowed the scene to give insight on how important Coulson is for May. Whedon also encouraged the writers to have Mexican characters speak Spanish with one another, which was the first time the pair had written for a language other than English. For Jemma Simmons and Jeffrey Mace's subplot in the episode, the writers were inspired by the film Broadcast News. The episode is also a \\"turning point\\" for the Ghost Rider pod, with Morrow's release from prison moving the story arc into a new section, and so the writers included elements to set-up future episodes. This included a poster of the Quentin Carnival in the background of the opening scene to hint at the future appearance of the character Johnny Blaze. = Casting and filming = News anchor George Stephanopoulos appears in the episode, interviewing the characters Jeffrey Mace and Ellen Nadeer. In October 2016, Marvel confirmed that main cast members Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Ming-Na Wen as Melinda May, Chloe Bennet as Daisy Johnson / Quake, Iain De Caestecker as Leo Fitz, Elizabeth Henstridge as Jemma Simmons, Henry Simmons as Alphonso \\"Mack\\" MacKenzie, and John Hannah as Holden Radcliffe would be starring in the episode. Also revealed was the guest cast for the episode, including Jason O'Mara as Director Jeffrey Mace, Gabriel Luna as Robbie Reyes, Parminder Nagra as Senator Nadeer, Maximilian Osinski as Agent Davis, Patrick Cavanaugh as Burrows, Jose Zuniga as Eli Morrow, Kerr Smith as Joseph Bauer, James Edson as Warden Green, Ricardo Walker as Agent Prince, Sky Soleil as corrections officer, Rolando Molina as Santino, Brandon Keener as Harlan, Jermaine Jacox as ferocious watchdog, Lilli Birdsell as Lucy Bauer, Ward Roberts as Hugo, Usman Ally as Vincent and Devin Barry as producer. O'Mara, Luna, Nagra, Osinski, Cavanaugh, Zuniga, Smith, Walker, Birdsell, Roberts, and Ally reprise their roles from earlier in the series. George Stephanopolous also appears in the episode, as himself. The episode's prison setting was realized with a mixture of location filming at a real prison, and constructed sets. The first scene shot for the episode was the heart-to-heart between Johnson and May. As big fans of Stephen King, the writers had the character Santino read a Spanish version of King's book Pet Sematary while in his jail cell. For the prop of the Darkhold, introduced in this episode, Lilla suggested that the book's cover should feature the word \\"Darkhold\\" as an ambigram, with the series' props department designing a new font to achieve this. The prop department had two weeks to create the book before it was needed for filming the episode, with the final book assembled by a bookbinder using aged, vellum pages that were filled with text and illustrations inspired by Leonardo DaVinci's Vitruvian Man. = Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins = The episode reveals that Mace became a public hero after the bombing of a United Nations meeting in Vienna, an event depicted in Captain America: Civil War. Mace was one of the many diplomats at the meeting, and was photographed saving another's life. However, the episode does indicate that Mace may not be telling the truth about this.  Release  \\"Lockup\\" was first aired in the United States on ABC on October 25, 2016. It began streaming on Netflix, along with the rest of the fourth season, on June 15, 2017.  Reception  = Ratings = In the United States the episode received a 0.8/3 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 0.8 percent of all households, and 3 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. It was watched by 2.30 million viewers. Within a week of its release, \\"Lockup\\" had been watched by 4.55 million U.S. viewers, just above the season average of 4.22 million. = Critical response = Writing for The A.V. Club, Alex McCown-Levy graded the episode a 'B+', calling it \\"a fast-moving and fun adventure, the kind of race-against-time scenario that remains the series‚Äô strong suit [which] played to the show‚Äôs strengths on numerous levels\\". He highlighted Johnson's fight against the prisoners, and Woods' direction of that scene, as well as the heart-to-heart between Johnson and May. McCown-Levy also felt \\"the show is having the most narratively efficient season yet, effectively balancing mission-of-the-week adventures with the longer plots\\", but was critical of Lucy and the low stokes of the villains. Terri Schwartz at IGN scored the episode an eight out of ten, indicating a \\"great\\" episode, and said the highlight was the action and choreography. Schwartz also noted character- focused moments such as the Johnson and May heart-to-heart and the revelations about Mace, while highliy criticizing the ghost effects, saying, \\"Maybe it's Lucy's makeup or maybe it's the downside of having a TV show budget, but the look of these affected beings takes me out of the episode whenever they appear. Because of that ... \\"Lockup\\" didn't pop as much as last week's \\"Let Me Stand Next to Your Fire\\". Marc Buxton of Den of Geek scored the episode three out of five stars, calling it filler, but fun, and saying that the Ghost Rider prison sequence \\"made the episode\\" for him. Buxton said he \\"digs\\" the connections made between Mac and Civil War, but felt the end of that subplot with Simmons was confusing and could have been made clearer. Kevin Fitzpatrick of ScreenCrush said the series \\"deserves some credit for venturing into\\" the prison breakout trope, and thought the action sequences were impressive, but felt that Johnson's storyline was \\"nowhere near as compelling as the series wants it to be\\" and contrived, and said that the Mace/Simmons subplot was \\"consistently dashing any energy or momentum built up from the prison scenes\\". Fitzpatrick also criticized the ghost effects. Collider's Evan Valentine gave the episode four stars out of five, indicating a \\"very good\\" episode, saying, \\"When Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is at its best, it manages to find something interesting and worthwhile for each of its cast to dig their teeth into, and this episode is one of the most on-point examples of that we‚Äôve seen this season.\\" He highlighted the action scenes, character interactions, and the Ghost Rider visual effects. Danny Hale at Flickering Myth said \\"Lockup\\" is \\"a really, really fun episode\\", and was thankful that Johnson rejoining S.H.I.E.L.D. was not \\"resolved without the appropriate time for the audience to feel her absence\\". Hale also noted the introduction of the Darkhold, Coulson and May's interactions, and the added mystery to Mace's character as all things that make \\"for good viewing and has me hooked for next week.\\" Vulture's Scott Meslow scored the episode three stars out of 5, feeling the season was lacking a \\"truly compelling villain\\" and saying the ghost effects look \\"absolutely terrible\\". Meslow said the prison scenes had \\"quippy dialogue\\" and \\"solid action scenes\\", but was more interested in the Mace/Simmons storyline. For Nerdist, Joseph McCabe said, \\"When S.H.I.E.L.D. is at its best, it doesn‚Äôt offer viewers much to dissect. Because it‚Äôs all about its momentum, [and this] is a textbook example: forty-two minutes of adrenaline without a single wasted moment.\\" He felt the episode had several satisfying character-based moments, especially the scenes between Coulson and May, and though McCabe felt Woods was not the most \\"adept at staging fight sequences\\", he still praised the choreography of Johnson's action scenes.
