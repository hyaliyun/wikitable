The region of breaking waves defines the surf zone. After breaking in the surf zone, the waves (now reduced in height) continue to move in, and they run up onto the sloping front of the beach, forming an uprush of water called swash. The water then runs back again as backswash. The nearshore zone where wave water comes onto the beach is the surf zone. The water in the surf zone, or breaker zone, is shallow, usually between 5 and 10 m (16 and 33 ft) deep; this causes the waves to be unstable. Animal life The animals that often are found living in the surf zone are crabs, clams, and snails. Surf clams and mole crabs are two species that stand out as inhabitants of the surf zone. Both of these animals are very fast burrowers. The surf clam, also known as the variable coquina, is a filter feeder that uses its gills to filter microalgae, tiny zooplankton, and small particulates out of seawater. The mole crab is a suspension feeder that eats by capturing zooplankton with its antennae. All of these creatures burrow down into the sand to escape from being pulled into the ocean from the tides and waves. They also burrow themselves in the sand to protect themselves from predators. The surf zone is full of nutrients, oxygen, and sunlight which leaves the zone very productive with animal life. Rip currents Rip current in the ocean. Rip currents are often very difficult to spot with one's bare eyes, take caution in any body of water The surf zone can contain dangerous rip currents: strong local currents which flow offshore and pose a threat to swimmers. Rip-current outlooks use the following set of qualifications: # Low- risk rip currents: Wind and/or wave conditions are not expected to support the development of rip currents; however, rip currents can sometimes occur, especially in the vicinity of jetties and piers. Know how to swim and heed the advice of lifeguards. # Moderate-risk rip currents: Wind and/or wave conditions support stronger or more frequent rip currents. Only experienced surf swimmers should enter the water. # High-risk rip currents: Wind and/or wave conditions support dangerous rip currents. Rip currents are life- threatening to anyone entering the surf.

He is credited as featuring on the band's first three albums; Soulside Journey, A Blaze in the Northern Sky and Under a Funeral Moon, as well as the Goatlord album; the rehearsal tapes of what was originally intended to be their second album (with later added vocals). He is said to have left due to delving into misanthropy, instead of generally leaving, as Darkthrone never had touring stress and he didn't leave prior because of the swift change from death metal to black metal, like other former member Dag Nilsen did. The band maintains that Zephyrous went into a forest and never returned. However, in a 2006 interview with the German website Voices From The Dark Side, Nocturno Culto claims he still has contact with Zephyrous and would like him to join the band as a guest on a few songs at some point. Very little information about Zephyrous is known, as Darkthrone have always maintained mystery about themselves, let alone past members. In two interviews in 2001 and 2002 with Nocturno Culto, he stated that Zephyrous left Darkthrone partly because he felt \\"left out\\" by N.Culto and Fenriz, who were very close at the time, and partly because he was an alcoholic and had a black out while driving his car. \\"He woke up in the hospital with much strings attached to him\\". \\"He left Darkthrone in much anger\\".

Bakker. The book sums up the extant evidence that indicates that dinosaurs, rather than being cold- blooded and wholly lizard-like, were warm-blooded, agile creatures more similar to modern birds than to lizards or other reptiles. Although controversial on publication in 1986, much of The Dinosaur Heresies now represents the prevalent view in paleontological circles (although other parts have been outdated by more current research). The main arguments used to show that dinosaurs were warm-blooded are: * Almost all animals that walk upright today are warm-blooded, and dinosaurs walked upright. * The hearts of warm- blooded animals can pump much more effectively than the hearts of cold-blooded animals. Therefore, the giant sauropod dinosaur Brachiosaurus must have had the type of heart associated with warm-blooded animals in order to pump blood all the way up to its head. * Dinosaurs such as Deinonychus led a very active life, which is much more compatible with a warm-blooded animal. * Some dinosaurs lived in northern latitudes, where it would have been impossible for cold-blooded animals to keep warm. * The rapid rate of speciation and evolution found in dinosaurs is typical of warm-blooded animals and atypical of cold-blooded animals. * The predator/prey ratio of predatory dinosaurs to their prey is a signature trait of warm-blooded predators rather than cold- blooded ones. * Birds are warm-blooded. Birds evolved from dinosaurs, therefore a change to a warm-blooded metabolism must have taken place at some point; there is far more change between dinosaurs and their ancestors, the archosaurs, than between dinosaurs and birds. * Warm-blooded metabolisms are evolutionary advantages for top predators and large herbivores; if the dinosaurs had not been warm-blooded, there should be fossil evidence showing mammals evolving to fill these ecological niches. No such evidence exists; in fact, mammals by the end of the Cretaceous had become smaller and smaller from their synapsid ancestors. * Dinosaurs grew rapidly, evidence for which can be found by observing cross-sections of their bones.

The station is currently owned by iHeartMedia, Inc.. History The station signed on October 18, 1962 as a sister to now defunct 1140 AM WCLW located at 791 McPherson Street in Mansfield, Ohio and owned by Mansfield Broadcasting Inc owned by Frederick Eckardt. Simulcasting 100% of the AM station 105.3 aired a Mainstream Rock/Pop format that was a first in the area. In 1975, the company changed names to Greater Mansfield Broadcasting Inc. having Lynn Eckardt join as Vice President of the company. At that time, WCLW aired a freeform format, with each DJ airing one format, from Big band to AC to AOR to Top 40. In 1983, WCLW-AM would become country competing against nearby WNCO Ashland, Ohio and WCLW-FM would change to a MOR format. Greater Mansfield Broadcasting would sell both WCLW-AM/FM to Cleveland lawyer and radio specialist Harrison Fuerst's Treasure Radio on April 16, 1987 for $2 Million. Fuerst had also owned several radio stations under the banner of Welcome Radio including 1280 KTLK Denver now KBNO (AM) and 105.1 KADX now KXKL-FM, 1490 KLNG Omaha now KIBM, 1460 WOKO Albany now WOPG (AM), 1390 KTUR Turlock/Modesto now KLOC, and 1350 WSLR Akron now WARF and sister station 96.5 WKDD. Under the newly incorporated Treasure Radio Associates, Fuerst was also purchasing WMAN (AM)/Mansfield for $1.6 Million to combine with his 1490 WMGW and 100.3 WZPR now WGYY in Meadville, Pennsylvania, 98.1 WJJR and now defunct 970 WHWB (AM) Rutland. The station changed its call letters to the current WYHT-FM on August 3, 1987. Treasure worked with consultant Nick Anthony, who'd programmed WKDD in Akron, and who currently is Vice President of Rubber City Radio Group. When Anthony joined the station, the entire format and lineup of the newly named Y105 changed adding Scott Bruner and Toni Foxx to mornings; Steve Casale to middays; Sheri Wharton in Afternoons; David G. Cook, evenings; and Eric Taylor, overnights. Program Director for the new Y105 was John Foster and music director Bob Dickey.https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickanthony The music format shifted from adult contemporary to CHR with the call letter change as well. After nearly a decade of ownership, Treasure Radio began divesting properties around the country including WYHT and WMAN for $7.65 Million to Faircom Communications who also owned WFNT and WCRZ in Flint. Less than one year later, Regent Communications (now Townsquare Media) purchased the entire Faircom portfolio for $32 Million. Shortly after the much anticipated Clear Channel/AMFM merger in 2000, Regent Communications announced it would swap WYHT and WMAN Mansfield, WSWR Shelby, KZXY-FM Apple Valley, KIXW (AM) Apple Valley, KIXA Lucerne Valley, KATJ-FM Victorville and KVTR Victorville plus an additional $67 Million in cash. In return Regent Communications secured new markets with both Albany and Grand Rapids August 2020: Y105 has transitioned back to a Hot AC format from CHR, effective Saturday August 1 12:00AM keeping #1 morning show, Dave & Jimmy in the morning in the 5-10am Monday through Friday time slot and \\"best of\\" on the weekends.

Sedimentary budgets are a coastal management tool used to analyze and describe the different sediment inputs (sources) and outputs (sinks) on the coasts, which is used to predict morphological change in any particular coastline over time. Within a coastal environment the rate of change of sediment is dependent on the amount of sediment brought into the system versus the amount of sediment that leaves the system. These inputs and outputs of sediment then equate to the total balance of the system and more than often reflect the amounts of erosion or accretion affecting the morphology of the coast.Komar, P, 1998, Beach processes and sedimentation, Prentice Hill, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, no.2, pg. 66-72Masselink, G & Hughes, M, 2003, Introduction to coastal processes and geomorphology, Hodder Headline Group, London, pg. 11-14 To assess the sedimentary budget the coast has to be divided into two separate morphologies, commonly known as littoral cells and compartments. Sediment compartments can usually be defined as two rocky barriers which mark the ends of a beach and have a fixed sediment budget, although usually leaky to some extent. Littoral cells can either be free or fixed and can occupy a hierarchy of scales, from individual rip cells to entire beaches.Woodroffe, C, 2003, Coasts: form, process and evolution, Cambridge University Press, UK There are various types of natural sources and sinks within a coastal system. Sediment sources can include river transport, sea cliff erosion and longshore drift into an area. Sediment sinks can include longshore drift of sediment away from an area and sediment deposition into an estuary. Anthropogenic activities can also influence sedimentary budgets; in particular damming of a river and in stream gravel mining of a river bed can reduce the sediment source to the coast. In contrast beach nourishment can increase sediment source. In 1966, Bowen and Inman defined a littoral cell and separated sediment inputs, accretion by longshore drift and outputs. Sedimentary budgets are used to assist in the management of beach erosion by trying to show the present sediment movement and forecast future sediment movement.List, Jeffrey H. (2005) \\"Sedimentary budget\\" in Schwartz, Maurice L. (e.d.) Encyclopedia of Coastal Science (Encyclopedia of Earth Sciences Series) Springer The Netherlands pages 846-850 Feedback mechanisms In order to understand the sedimentary budget of a coastal environment it is important to know the different types of feedback that can determine whether there is stability. When a beach environment is effected by wind, wave and tidal energy it responds with either positive or negative feedback which determines whether the system is balanced and in equilibrium. Negative feedback is a stabilising mechanism acting to oppose changes to coastal morphology and establish equilibrium. A coastal environment in equilibrium is able to dissipate or reflect incoming energy without the occurrence of sediment input or output and change to morphology. For example; when a beach in equilibrium erodes during a storm it forms an offshore bar that in turn forces waves to break over it. By doing this the waves lose a lot of energy and dissipate before reaching the shoreline, significantly reducing further erosion. When the storm calms, the bar is then re-worked back on to the beach. In contrast positive feedback pushes a coastal system away from equilibrium by modifying its morphology until a threshold is reached, whereby a different type of response occurs. For example; if a storm event was to breach the foredune of a beach that is not in equilibrium, a vulnerable area would be created, which in turn would become susceptible to the formation of a blowout due to wind exploiting the absence of vegetation. Sediment compartments and littoral cells Compartmentalisation of the shore occurs where there are major obstacles or objects, especially headlands on deeply embayed coasts. The beaches that are the most enclosed are commonly known as pocket beaches. On these type of beaches the volume of sand remains constant and are closed compartments. Littoral cells can be defined as sediment within a coast that is circulated e.g. rip currents. Littoral cells usually develop on coast which are not impeded by headlands and where longshore currents are allowed to develop. Identifying littoral cells is crucial to determine the sediment budget of sandy coasts. In south-west Western Australia, large cuspate forelands and rocky headlands are thought to be boundaries for littoral cells. Boundaries of littoral cells have been defined using tracer studies of sediment movement, geomorphological observation and sedimentological description, heavy mineral sourcing, and analysis of the spatial distribution of wave flux along the shore. Littoral cells are usually an area where changes in the volume of sediment directly affects changes in the coastline, and ideally they are defined to minimise longshore sediment exchange with other littoral cells, for example, a pocket beach surrounded by rocky headlands (which are presumed to exclude sediments). Sub-cells are usually defined to better measure the sediment budget of a coast with varying rates of accretion and erosion. The landward boundary of a littoral cell is usually the foot of a dune or cliff, however, the seaward boundary is difficult to define as mechanisms of sediment transport here are poorly understood. There are three kinds of boundaries between littoral cells: longshore, landward, and seaward; across which sediment may enter the littoral cell or leave it by various processes. It is important to identify which processes operate on a particular littoral cell and also important to identify sediment sources and sinks, as by measuring the sediment gained or lost by these sources and sinks, a sediment budget can be determined. =Sources= Rivers The Waimakariri River on the coast of Canterbury, New Zealand produces 77% of sediment supplied to the Pegasus Bay coastline. Rivers are major point sources of sediment contribution to the coastal sedimentary budget, this being particularly true of coasts with a steep gradient, where rivers directly dump their sediments at the coast. Coasts with a low gradient may lose river sediment to estuaries. Sediment delivery to the shoreline can be very intermittent mostly occurring during floods with the increase in flow typically creating an increase in sediment supplied to the coast. Some rivers are referred to as ‘large’ because they produce high amounts of sediment for which to nourish the coastal environment. For example, the Waimakariri River on the coast of Canterbury, New Zealand produces 77% of sediment supplied to the Pegasus Bay coastline.Bryan, K, Kench, P and Hart, D, 2008,”Multi-decadal coastal change in New Zealand: Evidence, mechanisms and implications”, New Zealand Geographer, vol.64, pg. 117-128 This is not always the case with some rivers referred to as ‘small’ because they struggle to supply enough sediment to keep their coastlines from eroding, for example, the Rakaia River South of Banks Peninsula in Canterbury, New Zealand. The construction of river dams for flood control and hydropower reduces sediment supply to many coastlines due to the trapping of sediment and the decrease in flood peaks and flood intensity. In places such as Southern California of the United States, in particular the San Luis Rey River, dams are built to control flooding of properties along the river. Ironically, in doing so, this is contributing to the damage of coastal properties due to a lack of sediment produced to protect the beaches.Kondolf, G, 1997,”Hungry Water: Effects of Dams and Gravel Mining on River Channels”, Environmental Management, vol.21, no.4, pp.533-551. Another example is the Aswan Dam constructed on the Nile River, Egypt in 1964. Prior to the construction of the Aswan Dam, the Nile River delivered 60-180 million tonnes of sediment and water to the Mediterranean Sea every year. Sediment supply is now almost zero which has produced a significant imbalance to the near shore sedimentary budget, creating major erosion and shifting of sediment along the coast. The effects of sediment trapping due to dams can be exacerbated when combined with other activities such as in-stream gravel mining. Excavation of gravel from a river bed forms pits within the channel profile which can trap much of the incoming bed load sediment, preventing or slowing it from reaching the coastline. Mining can also reducing the amount of overall sediment available for transport, especially when it occurs down stream from dams. For example; approximately 300,000m3 of gravel is extracted from the San Luis Rey River in South California every year, which is almost 50 times more than the bedload sediment yield after the dam was built. Thus, removing more bedload sediment further decreases the sediment yield available to the coast. The removal of natural vegetation for cultivation and land use can increase soil erosion resulting in an increase in sediment yield transported by rivers to the coast. For example; in Westland New Zealand this has had a cumulative effect with clear felling of trees increasing in river sediment yield up to eight times. Sea cliff erosion Sea cliff erosion is a large source of sediment to many coastal sedimentary budgets, initiated by many different processes including wave attack, rainfall and groundwater seepage. Cliff erosion can be influenced by rising sea levels and is magnified with storm surge events. An example of cliff erosion is the erosion of large Pleistocene alluvial fans that span the length of the Canterbury Bight, situated north of the Waitaki River in New Zealand. The erosion of these cliffs, due to high energy wave environments contributes 70% of the overall material supplied to these beaches.Hart D, Marsden I, Francis M. 2008. Chapter 20: Coastal Systems. In: Winterbourne, M, Knox, G.A. Marsden, I.D., Burrows, C (eds.) Natural History of Canterbury (3rd edn). Canterbury University Press, 30p, pp 653-684  Storms  Although less frequently observed than river transport and sea cliff erosion, storms may account for a large percentage of coastal sedimentary budgets. Following Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in 2005, over 131 x 106 metric tons of sediment were deposited along the Louisiana and eastern Texas Gulf Coast. Study of the western Louisiana coastal wetlands found hurricanes appear to be the \\"overwhelming pathway\\" by which sediment is deposited in that location, accounting for amounts of sediment far greater than amounts deposited by the local river systems.Turner, R. Eugene, et al. \\"Wetland sedimentation from hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\\" Science 314.5798 (2006): 449-452. Based annualized estimates of magnitude of sediment deposition, hurricanes have been found to deposit hundreds of times more sediment in these coastal wetland regions than man-made river diversions intended to redirect river-transported sediment to starving wetland systems. For salt marsh wetlands, particularly those of coastal Louisiana, sediment accumulation from hurricanes is \\"sufficient\\" to account for the entire inorganic sedimentary budget. =Sinks= A mangrove can trap sediment with its aerial root structures. Estuaries Estuaries are an example of a coastal sink in that they tend to trap sediment which can be due to tidal circulations and the mixing of fresh and salt water, the injection of river sediment and the presence of mangroves. As the tide rises and falls water and sediment is pumped into the estuary. Because salt water and sediment particles are heavier than fresh water they tend to be carried the bottom until the sediment sinks to the floor and is trapped within the estuary. The movement of sands and offshore material into an estuary generally depends on the direction of longshore drift and the movement of bottom waters across the continental shelf. Estuaries can often trap a lot of coarse bedload sediments that are fed down rivers, intercepting them before they reach the coast. The North Island of New Zealand experiences sediment sinks into estuaries often, enhanced by the presence of mangroves. Mangroves are sediment hungry and trap a lot of suspended sediment with their complex aerial root structure, thus functioning as land builders. Aeolian transport Sand that is blown by the wind inland to form sand dunes usually develop on shorelines where there is suitably strong winds. This can be a major sink for the sediment budget of a shoreline. Longshore drift Diagram demonstrating longshore drift Longshore drift of sediment is important for distributing sediment along the coast, and is considered one of the most important mechanisms. The longshore drift of sediment can be considered both a source and a sink due to the fact that in some case it can add sediment to a coastline but in others transport sediment away from a coastline. An example of both extremes of longshore drift can be found on the Canterbury coastline in New Zealand, either side of Banks Peninsular. Both the Waimakariri River in the north and the Canterbury Bight in the south of the Banks Peninsula provide large amounts of sediment respectively. The difference is the sediment supplied by the Waimakariri River is a source for the coast's New Brighton spit due to the reversal of southern currents transporting sediment to the south. In contrast the Canterbury Bight has a combination of high energy environments and strong southern longshore currents that transport large amounts of sediment north, which can be classified as a sink, putting a deficit to the coasts sedimentary budget. As a result, there is erosion of the Canterbury Bight and a predominantly balanced New Brighton Spit. Models have been developed for measuring longshore drift which can assist in determining a sedimentary budget, if they are integrated over the correct timescale. The sediment budget takes into consideration sediment sources and sinks within a system. This sediment can come from any source with examples of sources and sinks consisting of: * Rivers * Lagoons * Eroding land sources * Artificial sources e.g. nourishment * Artificial sinks e.g. mining/extraction * Offshore transport * Deposition of sediment on shore This sediment then enters the coastal system and is transported by longshore drift. A good example of the sediment budget and longshore drift working together in the coastal system is inlet ebb-tidal shoals, which store sand that has been transported by long shore transport. As well as storing sand these systems may also transfer or by pass sand into other beach systems, therefore inlet ebb-tidal shoal systems provide a good sources and sinks for the sediment budget. Cross-shore movement Wave swash and currents can impact significantly on the sediment budget, although it is difficult to measure. Swash can be either an erosive or accretion process depending on many factors such as the sand texture and the individual wave itself. Although during fair weather the impact of swash is negligible, during storms the sea level can rise high enough to erode dunes and cliffs, dumping large quantities of sediment into the littoral cell, which can only be given back to the dune by aeolian transport. Where storm surge causes sediments to be deposited on the land from the littoral cell, they can form washover fans or open a new tidal inlet which transports sediment away from the littoral cell. Management =Coastal nourishment= When a coastal environment is in sediment deficit, anthropogenic sediment nourishment is one way in which a balanced sedimentary budget can be maintained. This type of coastal erosion management has been adopted all over the world in order to preserve and protect. An example of this is at Mount Maunganui beach in the North Island of New Zealand which had been experiencing erosion, resulting in coastal dune retreat of almost 20m. When ongoing dredging at the entrance to the Tauranga Harbour began, it was decided that the sediment removed would be used to re- nourish the Mt. Manganui beach. The sediment was deposited in the nearshore zone promoting beach accretion by offshore berm emplacement. Results show that most of the 80,000m3 of sediment added to the nearshore zone made it to ashore to re-nourish the beach and even out the past sediment deficit. Nourishment of a coast can be regarded as a fast fix option to reversing a sediment deficit; however, it is important that nourishment is on-going in order to ensure the sedimentary budget remains balanced. =Coastal protection= When protecting the coastline it is important to understand the how the sedimentary budget can be affected when implementing appropriate coastal protecting techniques. Often management plans for coastal erosion have seen the use of ‘hard’ engineering structures as a means of protecting the coastline from recession. In particular groynes which are used to trap the longshore drift of sediment that often deprives a beach. Groynes have the ability to change the coast's sediment budget, accreting up drift beaches but at the same time starving down drift beaches. This management approach is not used so much these days, with modern knowledge of coastal dynamics promoting the use of ‘soft’, natural approaches such as nourishment and preservation of natural systems such as dunes. =Coastal planning= Being able to incorporate the sedimentary budget into a coastal management plan is becoming critical, especially in today's world where the majority of populations are living and owning property very close to the coast. One of the essential components drawn from sediment budget is being able to predict the morphological change that is likely to occur to a coastline over time, especially when creating plans associated with major environmental change such as sea level rise. Incorporating a sediment budget into a coastal plan has been recognised as highly important in the Hawke's Bay of New Zealand for finding information relating to hazard zones, beach property protection, and coastal erosion as well as assess the successfulness of current management strategies.Komar, P, 2005, “Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand: Environmental Change, Shoreline Erosion and Management Issues”, Report for Hawke’s Bay Regional Council. The major setback with using the sediment budget for management and what is probably the underlining issue regarding the sediment budget is its complexity.

The Poetry Foundation is a non-profit, charitable, 501(c)(3) organization. Donations are tax-deductible. History The foundation is the successor to the Modern Poetry Association (previous publisher of Poetry magazine), which was founded in 1941. The magazine, itself, was established in 1912 by Harriet Monroe. Monroe was its first publisher until her death in 1936. Today, the Poetry Foundation is one of the largest literary foundations in the world. Poetry Foundation Library In 2003, Poetry magazine received a grant from the estate of Ruth Lilly originally said to be worth over $100 million, but which grew to be about $200 million when it was given out. The grant added to her already substantial prior contributions. The magazine learned in 2001 that it would be getting the grant. Before announcing the gift, the magazine waited a year and reconfigured its governing board, which had been concerned with fund-raising. The foundation was created, and Joseph Parisi, who had been editor of the magazine for two decades, volunteered to head the new organization. Christian Wiman, a young critic and poet, succeeded to the editorship in 2003. Parisi resigned from the foundation after a few months. The new board used a recruiting agency to find John Barr, a former executive and published poet, to head the foundation. Robert Polito, the poet and critic who founded and directed the graduate writing program at the New School, succeeded Barr in 2013 and served until 2015. In December, 2015, Henry S. Bienen, President Emeritus of Northwestern University was named president. Bienen served as the president of The Poetry Foundation from December 2015 until his resignation on June 10, 2020, in the wake of a widely-panned response to criticisms of the Foundation. =Poetry Foundation building= Part of the Lilly grant was used to build the Poetry Center in Near North Side, Chicago. The Center, designed by John Ronan, opened in 2011. The center holds a library open to the public, houses reading spaces, hosts school and tour groups, and provides office and editorial space for the Poetry Foundation and magazine. Programs =Events= The Poetry Foundation hosts a schedule of events. These include poetry readings, staged plays, artist collaborations, and exhibitions. =Harriet Monroe Poetry Institute= The Harriet Monroe Poetry Institute provides an independent forum to convene discussions about poetry. Poets, scholars, educators and others are invited to share ideas about the intellectual and practical needs of the poetry form, and to generate solutions to benefit the art. =Poetry Out Loud contest= The Poetry Out Loud recitation contest was created in 2006 by the Poetry Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts to increase awareness of poetry through performance and competition. It engages high school students in public speaking and the literature and performance of poetry. The contest gives out a $20,000 award to the first-place winner, $10,000 for second place and $5,000 for third place. Participating schools also receive cash prizes. =Awards= First Poetry issue cover October 1912 The Foundation's awards seek to promote and bring recognition to poets and poetry. The Pegasus Awards are a series of awards to \\"under-recognized\\" poets and poetic forms (the winged horse, Pegasus, was used to illustrate the early magazine covers). They are generally given annually but may be given less often. The Young People's Poet Laureate (formerly the Children's Poet Laureate) is a two-year appointment to an author of children's poetry. The Ruth Lilly Prize is an annual award given for lifetime achievement in poetry to U.S. poets. The Ruth Lilly Poetry Fellowship is awarded to aspiring U.S. poets to support study and writing.

It is the first short story published in the volume Exile and the Kingdom by Albert Camus. Characters The story concerns a childless, married, Pied-Noir couple, Janine and Marcel, living in Algeria. The story is written in the third person perspective following events in the life of Janine. Marcel is a merchant and Janine is his assistant. Assumed French by birth or descent, the couple live an isolated life in Algeria, neither of them speaking the native Arabic language. Plot The story begins with the couple on a business trip through Algeria by bus. It is here that we first learn of the strained relationship between Marcel and Janine. In her thoughts Janine portrays a negative image of her husband who she sees as inert and tied up with his work, having relinquished the passions and ambitions that he possessed as a youth when they met. Janine sees herself as still being attractive in a mature way and reminisces about her adolescence. Also, a French Algerian soldier is on the bus. The soldier seems interested in Janine, letting it be noticed that he is looking at her and offers her a lozenge from a box in his pocket. Janine welcomes the soldier's attention and this reinforces Janine's opinion that she can still be attractive to men but feels dejected when later nothing comes of it. The couple stop at a hotel for the night and decide to visit a nearby fort. At the fort Janine feels inspired and is excited by the experience. Marcel contrastingly is totally unmoved and convinces his wife that they should get out of the cold. Once back at the hotel, Marcel falls asleep in their room. Janine cannot sleep. After consideration, she decides to sneak out of their room that night and return to the fort alone. Once at the fort Janine is overcome with an even stronger feeling of excitement and freedom than when she made love with her husband. At this point the narrative becomes increasingly dramatic and sensual as Janine runs around the fort feeling charged with life, eventually ending up lying on her back beneath the stars. Back at the hotel, Marcel wakes up and Janine breaks down into tears. Janine insists that it's nothing and never tells her husband about her frustration or her trip to the fort. Motifs =Biblical reference= The title of the story is taken from John 8:3-11 - The Adulterous Woman, in which a mob brings an adulteress before Jesus for judgment, the usual punishment for adultery being death by stoning. Jesus decrees that the first stone be thrown by one who is free from sin; until eventually no one remains. This story from the bible parallels Camus' thinking on Capital Punishment as outlined in Reflections on the Guillotine. Namely, that no authority exists which is capable of passing judgment on another human being because no person possesses absolute innocence. =Intent vs. act= Contrary to the title, at no point does Janine commit any physical act of adultery. The adultery in question is symbolic and in her own mind. By the end of the story, Janine is only guilty of the thought but it is not clear if she will take further action on her frustration or if she is prepared to go back to how things were before and accept her life. The title could be read as implying that the will to commit the act is equal to the act itself. =Lost youth= Early in the story, Janine reflects on her adolescence and the period when she met her husband and the choice she had at that time between security and independence. Reacting to various events in the story, Janine's perception of herself changes from awareness of her weight and poor physical condition to pride in still being attractive to other men. The story could be seen as being more about regaining lost youth than adultery itself. =Power= Throughout the story, Janine is recurringly repelled by her husband because of his inherent inertness, advancing age and lack of vitality. Similarly Janine is attracted to notions of primal vigor and power. The man on the bus by whom she is briefly fixated is a soldier and the place where Janine is reinvigorated with a sense of youth is a fort. Janine did not make love to her husband before visiting the fort. On the other hand, she experienced excitement from gazing at the starry night sky at the fort. This is described in an erotic manner, as if her adultery took place not with another man, but with the night itself in a temporarily empowering liberation from her constricting, married, subservient, and following life. At the beginning of the story, Janine is described as basing her existence on her husband, that is, he needs her and so she has a reason to exist. However, she is becoming disenchanted with her husband and his narrow ways, his narrow life. On the trip, her view of the world, both literally and figuratively, are widened. From atop the fort she gets a broader view of the world. She especially identifies herself with the nomads, whose tents she sees in the distance. The nomads are not tied to the town, or to the \\"civilized\\" world in general, yet they heroically continue to exist. This, along with the expansiveness of the vista from the fort top, begin to affect Janine in some deep way she cannot explain. That night, lying in bed next to her husband, she breaks with his narrow neediness and feels called back to the vastness of the desert, as seen from atop the fort. Finally, it is the expanse of the sky and its endless march of stars that overwhelms her. She makes the transition from existing merely as an extension of her husband, to being part of an endlessly larger world. This is her adultery. =Pied Noir and the Arabs in Camus' Algeria= As with other works of Camus, \\"The Adulterous Woman\\" is set in Algeria but native Algerians play no significant part in the story. Marcel especially, displays disdain and distrust for the Arabs; neither he nor Janine have bothered to learn Arabic and whenever Marcel speaks to or about a native Algerian it is to express his disapproval. One novel which is not set in Algeria, The Fall, set in Amsterdam and initially intended as another story in Exile and the Kingdom, is similarly lacking in any native Dutch characters. Both of the main characters in The Fall are assumed to be French, while Dutch citizens have no dialogue and are never referred to by name.

It is a short distance away from the City of Rocks National Reserve, a area with granite columns as much as high. Almo is part of the Burley, Idaho Micropolitan Statistical Area. History Many pioneers followed the Oregon Trail west in the middle of the 19th century, and passed by the future site of Almo. Several of these pioneers wrote letters home describing their encounters with Native Americans. Although these accounts tended to be exaggerated by participants, there is historical evidence of several small incidents that took place from 1860–1862. However, Almo's most famous historical event, the Almo Massacre of 1861, did not occur. In 1938, the Sons and Daughters of Idaho Pioneers paid for and erected a marker in remembrance of the massacre, in which a wagon train of nearly 300 pioneers was supposedly surrounded and slaughtered by Indians. However, the earliest written record of this event is from 1927, and the total absence of information about either the slaughtered pioneers or the five survivors has led the Idaho State Historical Society to recommend the removal of the marker, which the town has refused to do. Almo was established around a post office in 1881. It had previously been part of a ranch belonging to Myron B. Durfee and had often been considered to be in Utah.Andrew Jenson. Encyclopedic History of the Church. (Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1941) p. 12 By 1890, 40 of the 55 families in the Almo vicinity belonged to the LDS Church, and most claimed English or Scandinavian ancestry. Almo at the turn of the century boasted a store, a post office, a school, a brass band, a theatrical group, three saloons, and a welfare society. Almo's population reached 260 by 1920, the peak of Almo's population growth. Its population declined in the years to follow, as less land was available to homestead.

Having evolved out of the handbag house scene in 1993–1994, the genre enjoyed massive, albeit brief, popularity, with several hardbag releases achieving positions in the upper echelons of the UK chart. It was at the time sometimes confused with Nu-NRG, yet the styles were discernibly different. \\"Don't You Want Me\\" by Felix is largely considered to be the track that launched the hardbag explosion. Produced by Rollo Armstrong of Faithless, Red Jerry and Felix, \\"Don't You Want Me\\" was released in 1992, scoring a Top 10 placing on the UK singles chart. The popularity of the hardbag genre reached its zenith in 1995 with releases by Commander Tom, Candy Girls, Rollo & Sister Bliss and Mrs Wood all crossing over into the mainstream. Indeed, the sound began to meld with mákina, evident on tracks such as \\"Forever Young\\" by Interactive and \\"Rainbow Islands\\" by Seb. The two most influential exponents of the sound were Dutch producer Patrick Prins (who, recording a variety of aliases, scored several large UK club and chart hits such as \\"Bits & Pieces\\" – Artemesia) and the late Tony De Vit, whose hardbag composition \\"Hooked\\" is still considered one of the definitive examples of the genre.Timeless Preview – The History of the UK Hard House scene Another great presence in the hardbag scene was Red Jerry, former head of Hooj Choons. Other influential producers include Rollo Armstrong (later of the group Faithless) and Paul Masterson, the latter of whom diversified hardbag remixes to incorporate Hi-NRG elements. By early 1997 the Hardbag craze had died down, since then Hardbag created an influence on UK hard house and Electro house. Labels such as Tripoli Trax expounded this sound via releases such as \\"Bells Of Revolution\\" by Lemon 8 and \\"Raise Your Hands\\" by Knuckleheadz. Several hardbag producers went on to become big names within the trance scene in the late 1990s. These included Matt Darey (as Bi-Boy Action Squad, Orgasmatron and Space Baby), Sister Bliss (as a solo artist and co-producer with Rollo and Jon of the Pleased Wimmin), and John Graham whose Quivver alias had a hardbag hit with 'Saxy Lady' (1994).

The reasons for this may include punishment for a team found guilty of a certain act in the past, stadium safety issues, public health concerns, or to prevent potentially dangerous clashes between rival supporters. In football it is predicated by articles 7, 12 and 24 of FIFA's disciplinary code. Empty stadium in Dresden, Germany. Crowdless games are a rare although not unheard-of occurrence in North American sports. When they do occur, it is usually the result of events beyond the control of the teams or fans, such as weather-related concerns, public health concerns, or wider civil disturbances unrelated to the game. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the entire 2020 Major League Baseball season to be played behind closed doors.Baseball ready to step up to the plate, deliver shortened season NBC Sports, June 23, 2020 Examples =Brazil= In Brazil, the practice of games without public access is known as \\"closed gates\\" (in Portuguese, portões fechados), even referred as such in the Brazilian Football Confederation's rulebook. Once it was applied to a whole tournament: two rounds of the Campeonato Catarinense second division in 2014 were behind closed doors because the participant clubs did not deliver the security checks for their stadia. Sanitary reasons dictated the restriction in 2009, where two games of the Série D were played behind closed doors due to the H1N1 flu pandemic. =France= The French league has a tough line on misconduct. Each smoke grenade sent to the pitch results in a fine, which can then result in playing behind closed doors. If the crowd isn't managed, the club may also be punished. Hence, almost every season, a handful of matches are played behind closed doors. =North America= \\"Behind closed doors\\" or \\"crowdless\\" matches in the major North American sports leagues have historically been exceedingly rare. Most professional sports in the United States have been \\"gate-driven leagues:\\" they relied upon ticket sales and other game-day expenditures such as parking and concessions for the majority of their income, and going crowdless would deprive the leagues of that revenue, while still leaving the leagues responsible for the salaries of the participants. Broadcasting revenues have only in the 21st century risen to become a revenue source substantial enough to offset the loss of ticket sales, and even then it has only been such for the highest level major leagues. Amateur leagues also have the ability to survive crowdless, given their much lower expenses; at the recreational level, most games do not draw crowds. In between, professional minor leagues and fringe leagues cannot practically operate crowdless; Minor League Baseball and the Canadian Football League both cancelled their summer 2020 seasons rather than attempt to go crowdless (the CFL has substantial television revenue, but the league had lost money even with that revenue, making it impossible to operate without ticket sales). Hooliganism has been less of a factor in North American sports than in the rest of the world. Local law enforcement, private security contractors working for either the team or a league, and national agencies such as the United States Department of Homeland Security take large roles in preventing situations of fan violence before they can occur by restricting access to known troublesome fans either at the gate or at the stage of selling tickets (such as \\"do not sell\\" lists), along with heavy restrictions on bringing in items and screening with metal detectors and pat-down searches where bringing in a weapon or explosive device can result in immediate arrest and permanent banishment from a venue, and other examples such as the \\"clear bag\\" policy, which only allows spectators to bring in bags that can be easily seen through. Teams also have incentive to prevent fan violence due to forfeit rules which come with penalties to their records and playoff positioning, and league sanctions such as fines and the stripping of draft picks due to neglecting to create a safe environment for players, which in turn can affect teams for years beyond a violent event. Also sporting events in North America are considered to be more of a family-friendly and uniting affair, as sports fans tend to respect each other as fans of a common sport. In other countries around the world, sports matches are sometimes proxies for bitter and long-standing ethnic, political, and religious divisions; this is less so in the United States, where the broad variety of sports options manifests as different ethnic groups preferring different sports, reducing the chance at intercultural rivalry within a single sport. Furthermore, the much larger geographical footprint of the North American sports leagues mean that even fierce rivals are often based hundreds or even thousands of miles apart. For example, while the Dallas Cowboys are considered to be the bitter rivals of every other team in the NFC East, their nearest division is based almost from the Dallas metropolitan area by air, and over from Dallas by road. Fans elsewhere in the world can easily travel to most if not all of their league's stadiums by road or by train, and bus and rail carriers have evolved there to cater to the expected demand. In contrast, fans of the North American sports leagues would need to travel by air if they wanted to attend most of their team's road games. In contrast to the local derbies of European soccer, some North American teams in the same metropolitan areas, especially in baseball and (gridiron) football, are separated into opposite conferences or leagues so that they are among the least frequent opponents on their schedules, inhibiting the development of a crosstown rivalry and allowing fans in a metropolitan area to support both teams with minimal conflict. Even if many thousands of fans suddenly had the means and inclination to do that on a regular basis, the North American commercial aviation industry at present would not have sufficient spare capacity to accommodate them – even events such as the Super Bowl which draw the most interest from fans willing to travel cause a major logistical challenge for airlines and airport authorities. As a result, unlike in most smaller and more densely populated countries, teams are typically not required to (and typically do not) set aside whole sections of their stadiums for opposing fans. The lack of dedicated sections for opposing fans creates even further disincentive for them to travel to away games. All of these reduce the chances of hooliganism, eliminate the need to segregate fans from opposing teams, and ultimately negate the threat of closed door game due as a consequence of fan violence. In rare circumstances where a serious incident has occurred (such the 2004 Pacers–Pistons brawl in the NBA), sports authorities have leaned toward identifying and excluding the specific people involved as opposed to indiscriminately punishing the wider, law-abiding fan base. In contrast to the rest of the world where \\"behind closed doors\\" games are given out as penalties for previous violations or to prevent potential violence (stadium safety issues, checkered history of rival supporters), such occurrences in North America have happened for entirely different reasons. History =1980–81 European Cup Winners' Cup= After rioting by fans in the first leg against Castilla in Spain, West Ham United were forced to play the second leg at Upton Park in October 1980 to an empty stadium. =1982–83 European Cup= After rioting by fans in a semifinal at Anderlecht in Belgium the previous April, Aston Villa were forced to begin their defence of the European Cup at an empty Villa Park in September 1982, with the match kicking off at 2:30 pm on a Wednesday afternoon.\\"Ipswich assignment no Roman holiday\\" by Peter Ball, The Times page 22, 15 September 1982 =1987–88 European Cup= After UEFA ban resulting from the incidents in the match between Real Madrid and Bayern Munich in a semifinal in Spain the previous April, Real Madrid were forced to play the match at home against Napoli in the European Cup at an empty Santiago Bernabeu Stadium on 16 September 1987. =2007 Italian football= As a result of a policeman being killed during rioting at a Serie A match between Catania and Palermo on 2 February, the Italian Football Federation suspended all Italian matches indefinitely. Subsequently, matches resumed but many clubs were ordered to play their games behind closed doors until their stadiums met with updated security regulations. =2009 Italian football= Juventus were ordered to play a home game behind closed doors after their fans had racially abused Internazionale striker Mario Balotelli during a 1–1 Serie A draw in April 2009. =2009 Davis Cup match in Sweden= In March 2009, Sweden's Davis Cup tennis team was slated to host a qualifying match against Israel's team in the city of Malmo. The Leftist local authorities in Malmo, particularly the city's then-Mayor, did not want an Israeli team to play there and pushed to cancel the match. When the Swedish Tennis Association angrily noted that a cancellation would result in Sweden suffering a forfeit loss and being eliminated from the Davis Cup altogether, it was agreed that the Sweden-Israel match would be played without spectators on nebulous \\"security grounds\\". Rioting outside the arena led to numerous arrests, and in the end Sweden lost to Israel and saw their 2009 Davis Cup run end anyway. =2009–10 UEFA Europa League= FC Dinamo București had to play two home games in European competitions behind closed doors after their match against FC Slovan Liberec on 25 August 2009 was abandoned in the 88th minute due to a pitch invasion by Dinamo fans. =2009 Mexico Clausura= During the penultimate round of league games all teams had to play with closed doors due to the H1N1 swine flu outbreak in infected cities. Several games taking place in areas which were badly affected by the outbreak were also played behind closed doors the following week. Games behind closed doors have been played regularly as a penalty for bad behavior of fans in Mexico, most recently an Apertura 2015 game in which Atlas hosted Querétaro at Estadio Jalisco because of last season quarterfinal game in which Atlas fans invaded the pitch against their hated rivals Guadalajara. =2010–11 Heineken Cup= In rugby union, the 2010–11 Heineken Cup pool stage match between Edinburgh and Castres at Murrayfield was played behind closed doors on 20 December 2010. The match was originally scheduled for 19 December, but was postponed due to heavy snow in Edinburgh that covered the pitch and created major access issues for potential spectators. The competition organiser, European Rugby Cup, decided to hold the rescheduled match behind closed doors to remove any possible danger to spectators attempting to travel to the match. =Turkish football in 2011–12= Starting with the 2011–12 season, the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) instituted a modified version of this rule. The penalty for a team sanctioned for crowd violence is now a ban on both ticket sales to, and attendance by, males over age 12 (as spectators). Women, and children under age 12 of either sex, are admitted free. The first game under the new rule took place on 20 September 2011, when Fenerbahçe hosted Manisaspor at Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium in Istanbul. Over 41,000 women and children attended the match (plus a small number of men who had sneaked into the stadium). The experiment was so successful that the TFF planned to require that teams allocate an unspecified number of free tickets for women and children at all future club matches. Shortly thereafter, the TFF stated that it would reimburse clubs for free tickets given to women and children for regular league games (i.e., games not subject to crowd restrictions), and increased the upper age limit for \\"children\\" for the purposes of free ticketing to 15. =Ajax–AZ, 2011–12 KNVB Cup= A match between Eredivisie clubs Ajax and AZ in the fourth round of the 2011–12 KNVB Cup was replayed behind closed doors at Ajax's home ground, Amsterdam Arena, on 19 January 2012. In the original match, held at the same venue on 21 December 2011, Ajax held a 1–0 lead when a fan ran onto the pitch and launched a karate kick from behind against AZ goalkeeper Esteban Alvarado, who responded by attacking the fan before police and security arrived. When Alvarado was sent off for retaliating against his attacker, AZ left the pitch, and the match was abandoned. The KNVB rescinded the red card and ordered the match replayed in its entirety. After Ajax also apologised to their opponents, they were fined €10,000 for failing to provide adequate security to prevent the fan, who was serving a three-year stadium ban, from entering the arena. Ajax accepted the penalties, and announced that it had extended the fan's stadium ban by 30 years and banned him for life from the club and its season ticket list. =Barcelona–Las Palmas, 2017–18 La Liga= Surrounding violence in Catalonia due to the 2017 Catalan independence referendum, the match between FC Barcelona and UD Las Palmas in the 2017–18 La Liga was played behind closed doors. Barcelona first requested the LFP to postpone their match which was to be played on the same day as the referendum. This request was declined by the LFP, saying that, if Barcelona refused to play the match, their six points would be deducted. To protect the fans, as well as in protest to LFP's decision, Barcelona played the match behind closed doors, a first at their stadium, Camp Nou. The match ended 3–0 in favor of Barcelona. =Philippines–Qatar, 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup Asian Qualifiers= As part of the sanctions handed to the Philippine men's basketball team in the aftermath of their involvement in their brawl against Australia during their home game on 2 July 2018, the Philippine national team is obliged to play their next home match in the second round of the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup Asian qualifiers behind closed doors with the succeeding two home games being placed under probation.FIBA World Cup: Philippine hoops exec saddened to lose 6th man in closed door game ABS-CBN News Accessed 21 July 2018 The lone game that was played behind closed doors was their home game against Qatar on 17 September 2018 at the Smart Araneta Coliseum. =Major League Baseball= On 28 April 2015, Major League Baseball announced a game between the Chicago White Sox and Baltimore Orioles to be played at Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore that evening would instead start at 2:06 p.m. EDT, with no fans being admitted. The unprecedented decision came due to security concerns related to civil unrest in the city, along with a 10 p.m. EDT curfew which would have required suspension of the game had it been played at its original time. The game was to have been the last game of a three-game series, but the first two had already been postponed due to the unrest. The game was televised in the Baltimore and Chicago markets, and was also offered as a \\"free game of the day\\" on MLB's streaming service nationwide. Unofficially, some fans were able to watch the game through obstructed gates in left-center field, along with guests at the nearby Hilton Baltimore which overlooks the playing field. This was the first time a North American major league sports event was held in an empty sports venue; previously in minor league baseball, a 2008 Iowa Cubs game was played without public admittance due to flooding in Des Moines, Iowa, while a 2002 Charleston RiverDogs game in Charleston, South Carolina held a purposeful gimmick \\"Nobody Night\\" where no one was admitted to the park until the attendance figure was made official after the fifth inning; although approximately 1,800 spectators were in attendance, they were restricted to areas around the stadium (concession stands, etc.) until the end of the fifth inning when the attendance count was made. =PGA Tour golf= While large galleries consisting of thousands of fans are standard for top-level professional golf events in the United States, on 30 June 2012, the third round of the 2012 AT&T; National at Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, Maryland was played without fans being admitted due to trees being downed and other storm damage caused by a derecho the night before. Additionally, the start of the third round was delayed to the early afternoon, instead of a morning start that is normal for a round of a golf tournament utilizing a stroke play format, in order to allow for the continuation of course clean-up efforts. This is the first of two recorded instances of any part of a PGA Tour event being played without a gallery present. In the 2016 Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines Golf Course in the La Jolla community of San Diego, California, after inclement weather disrupted play on Sunday and several trees were ripped apart on the golf course, fans were barred from the premises for the Monday conclusion of the final round of the tournament due to safety issues. The 2018 edition of the same tournament also was finished behind closed doors on Monday. The sudden death playoff had reached five holes without a winner, and darkness made it impossible to complete the tournament. The event concluded Monday morning at 8:18 a.m. behind closed doors. =Ice hockey= The Charlotte Checkers of the American Hockey League have played in two such \\"behind closed doors\\" games, both caused by severe winter storms when the opposing team and game officials had already arrived in the city. On 22 January 2016, the Checkers played against the Chicago Wolves behind closed doors because of a severe winter storm, and the same again on 17 January 2018, the Checkers played against the Bridgeport Sound Tigers behind closed doors as a result of inclement weather (ice and snow). Both games were played at Bojangles' Coliseum. In 1985, a measles outbreak on campus led Boston University to hold home ice hockey games without spectators for a week, in order to control the disease's spread. Basketball games were also affected, and other large public events on campus were also temporarily banned. COVID-19 pandemic Games without crowds have become the norm due to the COVID-19 pandemic due to government-imposed restrictions on large gatherings to contain the virus. Many events that were not postponed or cancelled were held behind closed doors as broadcast only events. =Sports= Association football *The 2020 Indian Super League Final between ATK (football club) and Chennaiyin FC was forced to play behind closed doors due to the Coronavirus pandemic.

This measure was taken due to concerns about the spread of COVID-19 in the Bay Area, which prompted most cities in the metropolitan area (including San Francisco) to issue a ban on public gatherings with 1,000 people or higher. The restrictions were made moot with the league suspending the season a few hours later after Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19. Starting 30 July 2020, the game resumed at ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex inside Walt Disney World near Orlando, Florida for the remainder of the season. *The 2020 PBA season is the 45th season of the Philippine Basketball Association.

He is considered the father of micropile technology. He was born in Castelnuovo di Porto, Lazio, Italy on January 2, 1914 and lived in Naples for most of his childhood. At the age of 18 he went to Turin Military Academy where he graduated as a lieutenant by the age of 22. After graduation, he was sent to serve in Tripoli.

Dr. Lizzi started to work for the company SACIF in 1947, but shortly afterwards was the first (and for some time, the only) civil engineer of the newly formed company, Fondedile, where he remained as Technical Director for nearly 50 years. During this time while, Italy specifically, and Europe generally, were being reconstructed, he developed the technology later named pali radice (root pile, micropile) for the restoration of damaged monuments and buildings at the Scuola Angiulli in Naples. The first international application of micropiles was seen in Germany in 1952 for the underpinning of Krupp, in Essen-Bochum and then the Kerkini Dam in Greece. The technique was later applied in hundreds of works by Fondedile in various countries. Pali radice have been used extensively in the restoration of monuments, e.g. Ponte Vecchio in Florence in 1966 and the stabilization of the Leaning Tower of Burano in Venice. He died in Naples on August 28, 2003.

In 1994, a core group of ISM members formed what was then IWM, the International Workshop on Micropiles. The intention of the group was to form an international peer review team for the FHWA State of Practice Study on Micropiles (1993-1997), which focused on \\"classic\\" micropiles, namely drilled and grouted elements of high capacity. The study was undertaken as a contribution to the ongoing French national research project \\"FOREVER\\". This international team of practitioners and academicians have since gathered over the years on several occasions to ensure that the study has reflected current standards and practices worldwide. The synergy of this group of individuals, allied with major demands for technology transfer to \\"newer\\" markets mainly from Japan and Scandinavia, led to the organization of an IWM in Seattle, WA in September 1997. This first IWM has since led to eight additional workshops which have been held since this initial meeting: Ube, Japan (1999); Turku, Finland (2000); Lille, France (2001); Venice, Italy (2002); Seattle, WA (2003); Tokyo, Japan (2004); Schrobenhausen, Germany (2006); and Toronto, Canada (2007). Next workshop is scheduled for the second quarter of 2009 and will be held in London, UK. Countries sponsoring delegates and providing major contributions to the IWM throughout the years include the United States, France, Japan, Germany, Finland (and other Scandinavian countries), Italy, Belgium, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The late Dr. Fernando Lizzi of Naples, Italy, who developed the concept of pali radice (root piles), is regarded fondly as the visionary leader of ISM. He obtained the first micropile patents in 1952, and has used micropiles in the restoration of many important and historic monuments internationally. As the \\"father of micropiles\\", his creative vision has allowed the technology to blossom worldwide and has sewn the \\"roots\\" for its future and that of ISM.

The film's storyline centers on a heroic scientist who, with a small band of other survivors, must face off against a mutant monster following an atomic war that appears to have destroyed human civilization. Plot An atomic war has seemingly destroyed most, if not all, of human civilization, leaving the Earth contaminated with radioactive fallout. The apparent single exception is an isolated box canyon, surrounded by lead- bearing cliffs, in which former U.S. Navy Commander Jim Maddison (Paul Birch) lives with his daughter Louise (Lori Nelson) in a home that he has stockpiled with supplies in anticipation of such an apocalypse. Louise is engaged to be married, but her fiancé is missing. Into this natural bomb shelter stumble survivors, who by chance were inside the canyon when the atomic war occurred. After initially refusing to admit them, Jim relents when his daughter appeals to his humanity. Among the survivors are a geologist, Rick (Richard Denning), who happens to specialize in uranium mining, and a small-time hood, Tony (Mike Connors) with his \\"moll\\" Ruby (Adele Jergens), who were on their way to San Francisco. There are two struggles for survival: the first is a simple question of whether the radioactive fallout will dissipate, and if so, if it will do so before the rain comes to wash out what is in the atmosphere to fall to Earth, contaminating the shelter. The second threat comes in the form of a hideous atomic mutated monster (Paul Blaisdell), which seems bent on killing anything it comes across, but only consuming those creatures contaminated by fallout. A less obvious but no less dangerous threat is the hidden menace of Tony. Although seemingly charming and helpful, his true character and intentions are that he wants the other men out of the way, so that he can have both women for himself. All three dangers coincide as the mutated monster kidnaps Louise. It then releases her into a small lake, where it is obviously afraid to enter. Rick appears and attacks the creature, but it runs away as it begins to rain. Following the creature as it is being destroyed by the rain, they come to realize that the creature is Louise's missing fiancé. Tony, having stabbed Ruby to death after she realized that he wants to be with the younger Louise, then steals Jim's pistol. He quietly waits to ambush Rick when he returns with Louise. As Tony takes aim, Jim produces a second pistol and shoots Tony dead. Jim has been slowly expiring from radiation poisoning. He reveals that the rain is radiation-free and will wash away all of the remaining contamination, making the world safe to venture out into again. As he dies, Jim also reveals that he has heard voices of other survivors on the radio. After the rain, Rick and Louise, now the final two survivors, walk hand-in-hand out of the canyon (as the end card \\"The Beginning\\" appears on screen).

It had been announced in November 1954 before ARC had made any movies. James H. Nicholson of ARC (later AIP) thought up the title, then commissioned Lou Rusoff to write a script.Tom Weaver, Earth Vs. the Sci- fi Filmmakers: 20 Interviews McFarland, 2005 p 115-126 Alex Gordon later recalled: > To be on the safe side, Nicholson wanted Roger Corman to produce and direct. > But he did throw me a bone as executive producer for Golden State > Productions, because I was doing an awful lot on that picture.

The film's monster was made from foam rubber, claws from a magic shop, and toe nails carved from white pine.Frank, Alan. The Films of Roger Corman. Batsford (1998) Paul Blaisdell created and portrayed the monster in the film. Due to Blaisdell's height, he had limited visibility while in the costume. This caused problems when he had to carry Nelson, and almost caused Blaisdell to drown when the costume began to fill with water during filming.Frank, Alan. The Films of Roger Corman.

Alex Gordon said Corman tended to not direct actors at this stage of the career. \\"Lori Nelson particularly needed help [from a director]; she was used to getting it at Universal,\\" said Gordon. \\"One day she was kind of saying, “Gee, Roger won’t tell me anything. I’m doing it the best I can, but he’s not directing me...\\" But there was no crisis or anything.\\" Release The film was released in December 1955 with The Phantom from 10,000 Leagues. The pairing proved popular with audiences, due in part to some savvy marketing by Nicholson. In January 1956, the films were released simultaneously in 250 New England theaters grossing $45,000 from just 2 Boston theaters in its first week. Within two months of release, both films had earned $400,000. In February 1956 Variety reported the film as costing $65,000 and said it had earned more than $400,000 and was on track to make $1 million.

Skegby sits on both sides of a deep valley near the source of the River Meden. It is under Sutton- in-Ashfield. The parish covers about 1,433 acres and used to include the then hamlet of Stanton Hill. History The name of Skegby has a similar origin to the name of Skegness – originating from a Dane named Skeggi (\\"bearded one\\"). Skegby is mentioned in the Domesday Book as \\"a berewick of the King's manor at Mansfield\\". Skegby manor house (which is now in ruins) is located on Mansfield Road. In 1223 Godfrey Spigurnal became Lord of the Manor of Skegby. His descendants held the estate until 1334 when Elizabeth Spigurnal, who married Thomas Gobion, disposed of it to Richard Pensax. His descendant passed it to Percival Lindley in 1450 which was the beginning of the three hundred-year tenure of the Lindley family as Lords of the Manor. The estate passed to John Dodsley in 1820 and the Dodsley family remained in Skegby until the 1930s. The last Manorial Court was held in Skegby Hall on 25 April 1924. The current Lord of the Manor is Dominic Vernon Dodsley Williams, who currently resides in Carmarthenshire. Francis White's \\"Directory of Nottinghamshire,\\" of 1853 tells us that Skegby had \\"an extensive coal mine, and several limestone quarries and kilns\\" and that in the 1800s \\"stocking-making was a common occupation.\\" According to White, Skegby celebrated its Village Feast on the Sunday after 10 July.F. White \\"Directory of Nottinghamshire\\" (Sheffield, 1853) The Anglican church was built in the Norman period, prior to 1571 and was formerly a chapelry to Mansfield. The church was restored and enlarged in 1870. In 1844 a Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built, with a \\"Free Church\\" being built in 1863. In 1865 a National School for both boys and girls was built in Skegby village and a Baptist chapel was built in 1877. Areas of interest Several old buildings and features can be found in Skegby, including the Pinfold on Mansfield Road, which dates from the 18th century, the Troughs on Old Road, which are thought to be over 200 years old, the 17th century Quaker House on Mansfield Road, the 16th century Kruck Cottage and Skegby Hall, which was built in 1720 on the site of a much earlier dwelling. The Skegby Heritage Trail, (not to be confused with the Skegby Trail), which takes in places of historical interest around the village of Skegby, including Skegby Hall Gardens (currently under restoration), and the Manor House, was launched in October 2009 by the Skegby Appreciation Society. The Skegby Trail is a former railway track used by cyclists as an off-road track and as a nature trail by walkers which can be accessed from Buttery Lane in Skegby and ends at Chesterfield Road in Pleasley. From this trail the Teversal Trails, which form part of the Pleasley Trails Network may be accessed via the Link Trail between Skegby and Teversal. Modern Skegby Skegby has a number of small shops, off-licences, take away food outlets, hair salons and a petrol station. Other amenities which can be found in Skegby include a small library which is shared with the nearby village of Stanton Hill and the Woodside Medical Surgery and Pharmacy. There are five pubs in Skegby – the Forest Tavern on Forest Road, the Fox & Crown on Dalestorth Road, the Maypole on Dawgates Lane and the Rifle Volunteer on Forest Road, as well as the Triple S Snooker and Social Club on Mansfield Road. Schools Skegby also has two primary schools, Healdswood Infant and Nursery School on Barker Avenue and St. Andrew's C of E Primary School on Mansfield Road. Churches There are two churches in Skegby, St Andrews Church and Skegby Methodist Church on Mansfield Road Skegby.

The SSSI has a total area of and is the largest area of unenclosed moorland in West Yorkshire. There are extensive areas of blanket bog, interspersed by species-rich flushes and mires. Other habitats include wet and dry heaths and acid grasslands. The blanket bogs are dominated by cotton-grass and heather, with varying amounts of crowberry and bilberry. Areas of wet heath have cross-leaved heath and cranberry. The acid grasslands are dominated by mat-grass and wavy hair-grass with purple moor grass dominating on the wet slopes, along with the heath rush in the wettest places.

Skegby Colliery, owned by the Dodsley family, was originally located on Wharf Road, which is now in the area known as Stanton Hill, but in the first half of the 19th century was just part of Skegby. It was situated near a triangular piece of land known as Gore Field. Stanton Hill was first mentioned in the census in 1871, and then only as a street within Skegby. It probably took its name from the Stanton Ironworks Company, which started sinking the Teversal (Butcher Wood) Colliery in 1867, and later the Silverhill Colliery in 1878. Many of the workers for these new collieries moved from other coalmining areas including Shropshire, Staffordshire, Derbyshire, and Leicestershire. Skegby Colliery was replaced by New Skegby Colliery (later renamed Sutton Colliery) in 1873. It was also known as Brierley Colliery, possibly renamed by the many Staffordshire colliers moving from the Brierley Hill area. This was later taken over by the Blackwell Colliery Company. The huge increase in population of Skegby – from 805 in 1869 to over 3,000 in 1884 – meant that new housing was required in the immediate area. One hundred and thirty-two houses were initially built on Cooperative Street, Institute Street and Cross Row by the Stanton Ironworks Company, beginning in 1877. However, these street names only developed later, because in 1881 they were all recorded as Stanton Hill. By 1881 Stanton Hill was described as a hamlet within the parish of Skegby. Two years after the sinking of Silverhill Colliery the Stanton Ironworks Company acquired more land at Meden Bank, on which were built a further one hundred and twenty cottages and allotments for the workforce. The Blackwell Colliery Company also contributed to the housing in the Stanton Hill area, building the terraces of houses named Longden, Bainbridge, Marshall, Gardiner, Cochrane and Scott's. These streets were named after some of the Directors of the Blackwell Company at the time of construction.

It is a ten-minute walk from Oxford city centre and railway station. In 1980, money was raised by the Oxford Ice Skating Trust (OXIST) for the construction of a new ice rink — a project that was taken over by the Oxford City Council, who continue to own and manage the premises. The rink, designed by Nicholas Grimshaw, was built on Oxpens Road (known as Nun's Walk prior to 1850) and opened in 1984 with an ice hockey match between the Oxford City Stars and the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club. It looks like a ship, thanks to two 30-metre masts at each end that earned it the nickname, \\"the Cutty Sark\\". The north end of the building is fully glazed, allowing plenty of natural light into the rink. The rink offers public and disco. Both group and individual lessons in figure skating and ice dance are available from BITA qualified instructors. In February 2009, the Oxford City Council awarded the contract to manage leisure in Oxford. Since 31 March 2009, all of Oxford Leisure, including the Oxford Ice Rink has been run by Fusion-Lifestyle Ltd.

Within Spain, its frequency is highest in Extremadura, followed by Andalusia, the Canary Islands and Castile and León. In Mexico, there are concentrations in Los Altos de Jalisco, Tamaulipas, and along the Texas-Mexico border. There is no singular theory as to the origin of Macías. A long-standing argument over its origin revolves around whether or not it is of a Sephardi origin. Some argue that Macías originates from the Spanish version of the Hebraic term for the Messiah, while others hold that Macías (pronounced within Spain) actually is the Spanish version of the Biblical name, Matias or Matthew. Given that the Sephardim used surnames that were in many cases identical to those of their Gentile neighbors, it can be reasoned that certain Macías members were Sephardi without the surname Macias being exclusively Sephardi. According to John Woodward (with reference to the Heraldic coat of arms):Macias Coat of Arm \\"Dice, Cards, and other Instruments of Amusement.--Gules, three dice in perspective argent, marked (for six in front, three on the sinister side, two on the top) sable, is the coat of Mathias in England; of a family of the same name in France, and of Quintana in Spain.

Published in 1961 following the Cuban Revolution, it became a reference for thousands of guerrilla fighters in various countries around the world.Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara (World Leaders Past & Present), by Douglas Kellner, 1989, Chelsea House Publishers, , pg 81 The book draws upon Guevara's personal experience as a guerrilla soldier during the Cuban Revolution, generalizing for readers who would undertake guerrilla warfare in their own countries. The book identifies reasons for, prerequisites, and lessons of guerrilla warfare. The principal reason to conduct guerrilla warfare within a country is because all peaceful and legal means of recourse have been exhausted.“Che Guevara on Guerrilla Warfare: Doctrine, Practice and Evaluation”, by Jose A. Moreno, 1970, Comparative Studies in Society and History, Vol. 12, No. 2. Cambridge University Press, pg. 115 The most important prerequisite for conducting guerrilla warfare in a country is the popular support of its people for the guerrilla army. Che asserted that the success of the Cuban Revolution provided three lessons: popular forces can win a war against a regular army, guerrillas can create their own favorable conditions (not needing to wait for ideal conditions to take shape), and in underdeveloped America, the basic place of operation for a guerrilla army is the countryside. Themes Guerrilla Warfare is a manual for left-wing insurgency which draws upon Guevara's experience in the Cuban Revolution. It elaborates the foco theory (foquismo) of revolution in which the guerrilla operates as a vanguard, taking initiative to make revolution without waiting for ideal conditions to present themselves. Although the text has been compared to Mao Zedong's On Guerrilla Warfare, Guevara claimed not to have read Mao's book. Guerrilla Warfare was influenced by two books from the Spanish Civil War: Nuevas Guerras and Medicina contra invasión. South African revolutionaries read the work in the early 1960s; former Minister of Intelligence Ronnie Kasrils noted that the Apartheid regime's police questioned his late wife about an order of \\"Che Guevara's book on guerrilla warfare.\\"Kasrils, Ronnie. The Unlikely Secret Agent. New York: Monthly Review Press, 2010. . p. 9 =Pro-Guerrilla= Guerrilla warfare is presented as a feasible method of communist revolution. Guevara states that the \\"three fundamental lessons\\" of the Cuban Revolution are: \\"1) Popular forces can win a war against the army. 2) It is not necessary to wait until all conditions for making revolution exist; the insurrection can create them. 3) In underdeveloped America, the countryside is the basic area for armed fighting.\\"Guerrilla Warfare, p. 7. =Social Reform= In Guevara's treatment, a guerrilla is not merely a soldier, but a committed social reformer who fights for a cause, a disciplined ascetic. The guerrilla should set the example which will inspire followers, forging solidarity with the peasantry: \\"The peasant must always be helped technically, economically, morally, and culturally. The guerrilla fighter will be a sort of guiding angel.\\"Guerrilla Warfare, p. 39 =Combat= The book describes various forms of combat between guerrilla bands and regular armies; tactics include hit-and-run strikes, protracted combat at a distance, and sabotage. Guevara stresses that his specific Cuban examples should be adapted as local circumstances vary. Synopsis Guerrilla Warfare is divided into seven parts: * an opening dedication to Camilo Cienfuegos, Guevara's friend and fellow revolutionary, who died shortly before the book was completed, * three chapters (in 21 sections) which form the body of the work, * a chapter of two appendices (in two sections), * and finally, an epilogue which gives an appraisal of Cuba's then-current political situation, as it stood in 1961, following the revolution. A section-by-section synopsis of the book is given below. =Dedication to Camilo= Guevara dedicates the book to Camilo Cienfuegos, \\"who was to have read and corrected it when another destiny intervened\\". Cienfuegos is described as a good friend and model revolutionary. =Chapter I: General Principles of Guerrilla Warfare= The book's first chapter describes the nature, strategy and tactics of guerrilla warfare, with reference to its employment in the case of the Cuban Revolution. 1. Essence of Guerrilla Warfare As the success of the Cuban Revolution has demonstrated, guerrilla warfare is a feasible method for making communist revolution against regular national armies. The Cuban example provides three lessons: 1) popular forces can defeat a regular army, 2) warfare can begin immediately, creating its own favorable conditions, and does not need to wait for theoretical \\"ideal\\" conditions, and 3) in underdeveloped America, the countryside is the basic theater of conflict. There are also prerequisites to such an armed conflict. It must be clear to the guerrillas that all peaceful or civil means of recourse have been exhausted, and the guerrillas must also have the popular support of the people. Without the latter, this mode of warfare is untenable. The Chinese Long March is another instructive example of countryside operations of communist guerrillas. 2. Guerrilla Strategy In the opening phases of war, the guerrillas must concentrate on staying alive and making small strikes against the enemy, to steadily weaken it. As the force gains in numbers and friendly territory, it must split into new groups, encircling the enemy and repeating the process. Eventually, the force will change to resemble a regular army in numbers and discipline, at which point it can finally annihilate the enemy and achieve victory, the object of warfare. 3. Guerrilla Tactics Due to the asymmetry between the guerrillas and the regular army, the guerrillas are obliged to employ certain tactics, especially in the beginning. The guerrillas must have high mobility, in order to avoid being drawn into conventional battle with numerically superior forces. They should also routinely operate at night, and open battles with surprise attack. Sabotage of enemy supply chains is also necessary—sabotage is distinguished from terrorism, which should not be employed except in the most extreme circumstances (e.g. killing a high-value enemy target), as the latter tactic may claim innocent lives, and provoke a disproportionate reprisal. 4. Warfare on Favorable Ground For the guerrillas, favorable ground is difficult ground with which they are familiar—examples can include mountains, forests, or deserts. Places of refuge should be established in favorable ground, but the guerrillas must regularly venture out to engage the enemy in battle. In the case of the Cuban Revolution, useful weapons included the M1 Garand rifle, the Belgian FAL, and the M14. As the guerrilla army grows, its first light manufacturing efforts should be directed towards weapons and shoes. 5. Warfare on Unfavorable Ground On the other hand, guerrilla operation on unfavorable ground—such as plains and developed areas—requires certain adjustments in tactics. Units operating on such ground must have even higher mobility, and consequently their size should not exceed fifteen people. One advantage of operation on unfavorable ground is the greater opportunity for procurement of supplies. Guerrillas must always replenish their weapons and ammunition at every opportunity, and understand that their enemy is the primary source of armament. 6. Suburban Warfare Once the war has advanced toward the cities, suburban warfare becomes possible as a form of support operation. The suburban zone is an extreme example of unfavorable ground, and guerrillas operating there will usually confine themselves to supportive sabotage, always under a central command. =Chapter II: The Guerrilla Band= The second chapter describes the daily life of the guerrilla fighter, including political beliefs, daily supply and transportation concerns, military discipline, and battle. 1. The Guerrilla Fighter: Social Reformer The guerrilla is not merely a soldier, but must also model the cause for which he fights, in his views and personal conduct. This means that he must be personally convinced that his enemy upholds an oppressive and unjust society, which must be overthrown through revolution. It also means that he must be an effective communicator with the peasantry, for whom he fights and upon whom he relies for support. 2. The Guerrilla Fighter as Combatant Due to the difficulty of his task, the guerrilla must be extremely robust, both mentally and physically. He must be able to sleep in the open, go without food for several days when necessary, and carry all of his supplies on his back. A guerrilla's basic pack includes clothing, shoes, a knapsack, a hammock with nylon roof, a weapon, a canteen, spare food (canned) and soap. 3. Organization of a Guerrilla Band Units of guerrillas can be organized for operation in several different ways; the choice of formation is a function of the local situation. In one example, five units may move quietly in a column at night, each reinforcing their adjacent members. In the Cuban case, one useful adapted weapon consisted of a Molotov cocktail projectile affixed to a 16 gauge sawed-off shotgun. This improvised weapon became known as the \\"M-16\\" (not to be confused with the M16 rifle). 4. The Combat Actual combat may take many forms. The enemy may be encircled, or it may simply be goaded on and weakened through sporadic fire. In specific circumstances, it is possible to capture an enemy outpost. What is essential to all forms of combat is the necessity for the guerrilla to replenish arms and ammunition through engagement with the enemy. 5. Beginning, Development, and End of a Guerrilla War Drawing again upon the Cuban example, a guerrilla force starts small, and grows. In addition to its military operations, it eventually develops its own manufacturing capabilities, and establishes its own jurisprudence and governmental administration within its own controlled territory, thereby approximating a state. At this advanced stage of development, the guerrilla army-and-state develops into a symmetrical force which can achieve victory over its enemy. =Chapter III: Organization of the Guerrilla Front= The third chapter describes the daily life in the friendly territory inhabited by the guerrilla fighter, and details its various support activities for a war effort. 1. Supply As the guerrillas establish control in given areas, a supply chain must be established to satisfy all of the force's needs, particularly food, salt, and leather for shoes. Peasant farmers can give a portion of their work product to the guerrillas, and supply caches should be stored throughout the countryside. Mules are excellent beasts of burden for guerrilla needs, both because they can shoulder heavy loads, and also because they can traverse the rough ground which is the guerrilla's native territory. If there is enough social cohesion between the guerrillas and the peasants, taxes can also be levied. 2. Civil Organization In order to keep trust with the peasants, guerrillas must also establish forms of civil government in the friendly areas, to administer justice and de facto solutions for day-to-day problems, functions no longer performed in the zone by the alienated enemy state. 3. The Role of the Woman Women's capacity to contribute to a guerrilla effort should not be underestimated, and contrary to popular belief, their presence in a unit does not cause sexual tension. Women can conduct combat, and are especially useful as messengers, because they have greater freedom of movement in hostile territory than single men do. Women can also assist as cooks and nurses. 4. Medical Problems Doctors and medical personnel can assist the guerrilla effort in three capacities, which are a function of the growth and sophistication of the guerrilla territory. In the first case, doctors must fight alongside the guerrillas, operating as field medics. As territory expands, it is possible to establish medics at safe houses. Upon further expansion of the guerrilla territory, it is possible to establish legitimate hospital facilities, with proper equipment and infrastructure. 5. Sabotage Sabotage, again distinguished from terrorism, is an important adjunct activity in war, alongside direct combat. Important targets include supply lines (railroads), infrastructure (bridges, which can be destroyed using dynamite) and communications (telecommunication lines can be crippled by felling a single pole). 6. War Industry The developed guerrilla territory must begin to perform its own legitimate manufacturing; again, essential manufacturing processes for the war effort include shoe production and repair, weapons production and repair in an armory, and salt manufacturing. 7. Propaganda Propaganda must also be disseminated both inside and outside the guerrilla territory; appropriate media include newspapers and radio. 8. Intelligence Good intelligence is essential to obtain before engaging in any battle, and it may be acquired from friendly peasants, or by eavesdropping on the enemy. Again, women make particularly good spies for this sort of intelligence gathering. 9. Training and Indoctrination In its early stages, the war itself and its experience will train the guerrillas; only at later stages does it become feasible to establish dedicated training camps for new recruits. Training must include marksmanship and political indoctrination. 10. The Organizational Structure of the Army of a Revolutionary Movement Like a regular army, a guerrilla army must also have a clear chain of command, and military discipline. When a punishment is deemed necessary, it must be painful. The reason for this is that guerrillas, unlike regular armies, are already accustomed to extreme daily hardships. However, such a punishment need not be physical: for example, depriving a guerrilla of his weapon can wound his pride and motivate the desired corrected behavior. =Appendices= Two appendices further detail guerrilla military operations. 1. Organization in Secret of the First Guerrilla Band Before the first guerrilla group commences its military operations, careful planning is essential. Bases, safe houses and supply caches must be established at multiple locations, and information must be tightly controlled and specialized among a few people, with no one knowing all details of military operation, so that it will be impossible for all secrets to be obtained by the enemy in the event that a given person is captured and tortured. The guerrillas must also physically disperse themselves throughout the countryside, so as not to call attention to themselves. 2. Defense of Power that has been Won Following the defeat of the enemy army at the national level, care must also be taken to retain the political power which has been won. To counter an unfriendly international press, the war effort must continue to disseminate its own propaganda. Further, the whole cultural and military apparatus of the previous regime must be completely swept away, so that soldiers of the old army and their sympathizers cannot rise up again. =Epilogue= The book closes with an epilogue which explicitly treats the Cuban political situation as it existed shortly after the revolution, in 1961. Analysis of the Cuban Situation, its Present and its Future The epilogue details certain laws, entities and policies which were established in Cuba following the revolution, including the Agrarian Reform law and the INRA. The revolution's detrimental impact on the United Fruit Company and other capitalist interests are also mentioned. Although he identifies the United States as an enemy, Guevara closes with optimism for the future of Cuba.  Reception  = Foreign military involvement = While the book was intended for other revolutionary movements in Latin America, Africa and Asia, it was also studied by counter-revolutionary military schools.Szulc (1986), p.380 With the success of Che's military campaign in Cuba and the spread of communism in Latin America, U.S. military activity increased throughout the region. The U.S. military adopted some of Che's own tactics in order to better combat guerrilla fighters in the jungle.Lewis S. Che Guevara and Guerrilla Warfare: Training for Today's Nonlinear Battlefields. Military Review [serial online]. September 2001;81(5):98. Available from: Military & Government Collection, Ipswich, MA. This entailed U.S. military training throughout Latin America in order to counteract the spreading of guerrilla movements throughout the region (for historical context on United States foreign policy in Latin America, see the Good Neighbor Policy). Che faced the results of this training during his final campaign in Bolivia. = Reviews = The book attracted analysis and criticism: See also *Guerilla warfare *History of the Central Intelligence Agency *\\"Yank\\" Levy, author of an earlier book of the same name. * Notes References *. *. *. *. *. *. *.

Geology  High Falls is located in Transylvania County on the Little River through the DuPont State Forest. It is one of 4 major waterfalls on the Little River in this area, the others being Triple Falls, Hooker Falls, and Bridal Veil Falls. Above the falls itself, the river is level and calm. The falls consists of a wide, ever-steepening slide over granite, and the water generally stays on the rock the whole way down. In some places, the water free-falls for a few feet or jumps off the rock face, but it is not possible to get behind the falls anywhere. History High Falls has been known for years to local residents. In the 1990s, DuPont Forest was sold to the State of North Carolina, and as DuPont has completed cleanup of various areas, those areas have been made open to the public as a part of the 10,000+ acre DuPont State Forest. Visiting High Falls Visitors may park at the Hooker Falls parking area, and then hike the Triple Falls / High Falls Trail for roughly 1 mile (past the view for Triple Falls). There are several views of the falls, one from an overlook that lets you view the entire falls, and another from a covered bridge area that passes near the top of the falls on Buck Forest Rd.

It was built in Art Deco and early functionalism style. Originally it was established in 1921 but later it was decided to move to a larger location. A part of the new museum was opened in 1930, at the 500th anniversary of Vytautas the Great, Grand Duke of Lithuania, the namesake of the museum. The finished museum was opened on 16 February 1936. Museum displays historical artefacts pertaining to Lithuania and Kaunas from prehistoric times to the present day, including a large collection of historical weapons. There are expositions dedicated to the military skills of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Vytautas the Great Chapel, collections of weapons, firearms, ammunition, army uniforms of various states, defense of the Kaunas Fortress in 1915, and others.Vytautas statue in the Vytautas the Great War Museum Square commemorating Lithuanian national renaissance figures with the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the middleThe airplane Lituanica, on which Steponas Darius and Stasys Girėnas flew across the Atlantic Ocean in 1933, is on display and remains a popular exhibition. Freedom statue in the square of the Vytautas the Great War Museum In the great hall of the museum there are copies of 17th century cannons. There is also a comprehensive collection of 18th century pistols. Statues of Lithuanian national renaissance figures, and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and eternal flame, are located in the square in front of the museum. During the time of the First Lithuanian Republic (1918–1940), when Kaunas was the temporary capital of Lithuania, national holidays were celebrated in the square. The plaque commemorating book smugglers and distributors Knygnešių sienelė is also situated alongside. The Kaunas 35-bell carillon (range from as1 to as4) in the tower of the Vytautas the Great War Museum was completed in Belgium in 1935. Bell music from the tower was first played in 1937. Regular carillon concerts began in 1956. The first carillonists of the Kaunas carillon were Lithuanian composers Viktoras Kuprevičius and his son Giedrius Kuprevičius. The carillon was restored by the Royal Eijsbouts bell foundry in Asten, Netherlands, in 2005–2006. After the restoration, the carillon has 49 bells and a new keyboard. Every day at midday, the Lithuanian war time song Oi, neverk motušėle (Don’t Cry, Mother) is played. The crypt to Those Perished for the Freedom of Lithuania was constructed in 1938. The crypt was vandalized and destroyed during the time of Soviet occupation. After the restoration the crypt inside covered with black marble was opened again in 1998. The 90th anniversary of the museum in 2011 was marked by the opening of two new galleries: Warfare in Pre-Historic Times and History of Warfare of the Lithuanian Grand Duchy of the 13th-17th centuries. The museum shares its building with the M. K. Čiurlionis National Art Museum and is located in Vienybė Square. The museum and its surroundings are depicted on the 20 litas banknote. Museum's garden has more than ten statues of Lithuanian military chiefs and cultural characters who influenced Lithuania in 19th and 20th century. In 2015, the building was one of 44 objects in Kaunas to receive the European Heritage Label.

Dentists use radiographs for many reasons: to find hidden dental structures, malignant or benign masses, bone loss, and cavities. A radiographic image is formed by a controlled burst of X-ray radiation which penetrates oral structures at different levels, depending on varying anatomical densities, before striking the film or sensor. Teeth appear lighter because less radiation penetrates them to reach the film. Dental caries, infections and other changes in the bone density, and the periodontal ligament, appear darker because X-rays readily penetrate these less dense structures. Dental restorations (fillings, crowns) may appear lighter or darker, depending on the density of the material. The dosage of X-ray radiation received by a dental patient is typically small (around 0.150 mSv for a full mouth series, according to the American Dental Association website), equivalent to a few days' worth of background environmental radiation exposure, or similar to the dose received during a cross-country airplane flight (concentrated into one short burst aimed at a small area). Incidental exposure is further reduced by the use of a lead shield, lead apron, sometimes with a lead thyroid collar. Technician exposure is reduced by stepping out of the room, or behind adequate shielding material, when the X-ray source is activated. Once photographic film has been exposed to X-ray radiation, it needs to be developed, traditionally using a process where the film is exposed to a series of chemicals in a dark room, as the films are sensitive to normal light. This can be a time-consuming process, and incorrect exposures or mistakes in the development process can necessitate retakes, exposing the patient to additional radiation. Digital X-rays, which replace the film with an electronic sensor, address some of these issues, and are becoming widely used in dentistry as the technology evolves. They may require less radiation and are processed much more quickly than conventional radiographic films, often instantly viewable on a computer. However digital sensors are extremely costly and have historically had poor resolution, though this is much improved in modern sensors. explorer. Radiographic evaluation, (B), however, revealed an extensive region of demineralization within the dentin (arrows) of the mesial half of the tooth. When a bur was used to remove the occlusal enamel overlying the decay, (C), a large hollow was found within the crown and it was discovered that a hole in the side of the tooth large enough to allow the tip of the explorer to pass was contiguous with this hollow. After all of the decay had been removed, (D), the pulp chamber had been exposed and most of the mesial half of the crown was either missing or poorly supported. It is possible for both tooth decay and periodontal disease to be missed during a clinical exam, and radiographic evaluation of the dental and periodontal tissues is a critical segment of the comprehensive oral examination. The photographic montage at right depicts a situation in which extensive decay had been overlooked by a number of dentists prior to radiographic evaluation. Regulations  Dental X-ray unit installed in a dental office There are numerous risks associated with the taking of dental radiographs, even though the dose to the patient is minimal, the collective dose needs to be considered in this context as well. Therefore, it is incumbent on the operator and prescriber to be aware of their responsibilities when it comes to exposing a patient to ionizing radiation. The United Kingdom has 2 sets of regulations related to the taking of x-rays. These are the Ionizing Radiations Regulations 2017 and IRMER (Ionizing Radiations Medical Exposures Regulations) 2018. IRR17 principally relates to the protection of workers and the public, along with the equipment standards. IRMER18 is specific for patient protection. These regulations replace the previous versions which were being followed for many years (IRR99 and IRMER2000). This change has come primarily due to Basic Safety Standards Directive 2013 (BSSD; also known as European Council Directive 2013/59/Euratom), which all European Union member states are legally required to transpose into their national laws by 2018. The above regulations are specific to the United Kingdom. Whereas the EU and USA are principally governed by the directive 2013/59/Eurotam and The Federal Guidance For Radiation Protection respectively. The goal of all these standards, including others governing other countries, is primarily to protect the patient, operators, maintain safe equipment and ensure quality assurance. The UK’s Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has also published an accompanying Approved Code of Practice (ACoP) and associated guidance, which gives practical advise on how to comply with the law. Following the ACoP is not obligatory. However, compliance with it can prove very beneficial for the legal person if they were to face any negligence or lack of compliance to the law issues, as it will confirm that the said legal person has been implementing good practice. = Legal Responsibility and Staff Appointments = With IRR17 and IRMER18, there are certain key roles and responsibilities that need to be carried out by a designated person. One person may carry out more than one role. The person or body corporate with the legal responsibility in respect to every dental X-ray and every item of auxiliary equipment associated with radiation safety is known as The Legal Person.  1) Radiation Protection Supervisor  Their role is to ensure compliance with IRR17 and to supervise the arrangements set out in the practice’s Local Rules.  2) Referrer  IRMER18 defines a referrer as a registered medical, dental or other healthcare practitioner who is entitled according to the legal persons procedures to refer individuals for medical exposure to an IRMER practitioner. This would usually be the dentist in a dental practice.  3) Practitioner  IRMER18 defines a practitioner as a registered medical, dental or other healthcare practitioner who is entitled according to the legal person’s procedures to take responsibility for an individual medical exposure i.e responsible to provide the justification for the X-ray.  4) Operator  IRMER18 defines an operator as a registered medical, dental or other healthcare practitioner who is entitled according to the legal person’s procedures to carry out the practical aspects associated with radiographic examination, from patient identification, the X-ray process, to clinical evaluation of the radiographs. It is possible and appropriate for one person to carry out the roles of a referrer, practitioner and operator. External appointments are also a legal obligation to comply with the regulations, these are the Radiation Protection Advisor and Medical Physics Expert. Under IRR17, training of staff is paramount to complying with the regulation. It is the Legal Person’s duty to ensure this standard is met. This training includes but is not limited to: * Ensuring staff are trained appropriated to commensurate their duties, knowing risks of exposures, precautions to be taken and importance to comply with regulations. * Other members accompanying the patient (example a daughter for her elderly parent) and aware of the information regarding their own health and safety. * Protocol for female operators who may be pregnant Justification for the exposure of X-rays to a patient is extremely important to be documented under the regulations. The IRMER practitioner is responsible for justifying the X-ray. The benefit to the patient from the diagnostic information obtained should outweigh the detriment for of the exposure. The information gathered should aid in the patients' treatment planning, prognosis or management. For an exposure to be justified, the practitioner must consider the following: * The availability and findings of previous radiographs * The specific objectives of the exposure in relation to the history and examination of the patient * The total potential diagnostic benefit to the individual * The radiation risk associated with the radiographic examination * The efficacy, benefits and risk of available alternative techniques, which have the same objective but involve no or lesser exposure to ionizing radiation = Optimisation = A common acronym used in this situation is ALARP. This stands for As Low As Reasonably Possible, in reference to the dose delivered to the patient. This responsibility falls on the operator, and he is guided by the written protocols that are in place for every type of standard projection for each X-ray, including the exposure settings. = Quality assurance = It is the Legal Person’s responsibility to ensure quality assurance guidelines are followed in the dental practice. Its primary purpose is to ensure consistent adequate diagnostic information, keeping in mind the ALARP protocol. The essential procedures within a dental programme suited to dental radiology will relate to: * Image quality * Patient dose and X-ray equipment * Darkroom, films and processing * Training * Audits The subsequent image quality then needs to be assessed for its diagnostic acceptability. It is now becoming extremely important for each dental X-ray to be graded in the following way:  Grade 1  * Excellent * No errors in patient preparation, exposure, positioning, processing or film handling  Grade 2  * Diagnostically acceptable * Some errors in patient preparation, exposure, positioning, processing or film handling, which does not detract from the diagnostic utility of the radiograph  Grade 3  * Unacceptable * Errors of patient preparation, exposure, position, processing, or film handling which render the radiograph diagnostically unacceptable. The minimum target a practice should aim for in regards to their total X-rays taken: * Grade 1 – not less than 70% * Grade 2 – not greater than 20% * Grade 3 – not greater than 10% Intraoral radiographic views Placing the radiographic film or sensor inside the mouth produces an intraoral radiographic view. =Periapical view= Periapical radiographs are taken to evaluate the periapical area of the tooth and surrounding bone For periapical radiographs, the film or digital receptor should be placed parallel vertically to the full length of the teeth being imaged. The main indications for periapical radiography are * Detect apical inflammation/ infection including cystic changes * Assess periodontal problems * Trauma-fractures to tooth and/or surrounding bone * Pre/ post apical surgery/extraction. Pre extraction planning for any developmental anomalies and root morphology. Post extraction radiographs for any root fragments any other co-lateral damages. * Detect any presence or position of unerupted teeth * Endodontics. For any endodontic treatment, a pre-treatment radiograph is taken to measure the working length of the canals and this measurement is confirmed with electronic apex locator. A ‘cone fit’ radiograph is used when Master Apical Cone is placed in wet canal to correct working length to achieve frictional fit apically. Next, obturation verification radiograph is indicated after the canal space is fully filled with master cone, sealer and accessory cones. In the end, a final radiograph is taken after a definitive restoration is placed to check the final outcome of root canal treatment. * Evaluation of implants. Intraoral periapical radiographs are widely used for the preoperative due to its simple technique, low cost and less radiation exposure and widely available in clinical settings. =Bitewing view= The bitewing view is taken to visualize the crowns of the posterior teeth and the height of the alveolar bone in relation to the cementoenamel junctions, which are the demarcation lines on the teeth which separate tooth crown from tooth root. Routine bitewing radiographs are commonly used to examine for interdental caries and recurrent caries under existing restorations. When there is extensive bone loss, the films may be situated with their longer dimension in the vertical axis so as to better visualize their levels in relation to the teeth. Because bitewing views are taken from a more or less perpendicular angle to the buccal surface of the teeth, they more accurately exhibit the bone levels than do periapical views. Bitewings of the anterior teeth are not routinely taken. The name bitewing refers to a little tab of paper or plastic situated in the center of the X-ray film, which when bitten on, allows the film to hover so that it captures an even amount of maxillary and mandibular information. =Occlusal view= The occlusal view reveals the skeletal or pathologic anatomy of either the floor of the mouth or the palate. The occlusal film, which is about three to four times the size of the film used to take a periapical or bitewing, is inserted into the mouth so as to entirely separate the maxillary and mandibular teeth, and the film is exposed either from under the chin or angled down from the top of the nose. Sometimes, it is placed in the inside of the cheek to confirm the presence of a sialolith in Stenson's duct, which carries saliva from the parotid gland. The occlusal view is not included in the standard full mouth series. 1\\\\. Anterior oblique occlusal mandible – 45° Technique: the collimator is positioned in the midline, thru the chin aiming an angle of 45° to the image receptor which is placed centrally into the mouth, on to the occlusal surface of the lower arch. Indications: 1) Periapical status of lower incisor teeth for patients who cannot tolerate periapical radiographs. 2) Assess the size of lesions such as cyst or tumours at anterior area of mandible 2\\\\. Lateral oblique occlusal mandible – 45° Technique: The collimator is positioned from below and behind the angle of mandible and parallel to the lingual surface of the mandible, aiming upwards and forwards at the image receptors which is placed centrally into the mouth, on to the occlusal surface of lower arch. Patients must turn their head away from the side of investigation. Indications: 1) Detection of any sialoliths in submandibular salivary glands 2) Used to demonstrate unerupted lower 8’s 3) Assess the size of lesions such as cyst or tumours in the posterior of body and angle of mandible =Full mouth series= A full mouth series is a complete set of intraoral X-rays taken of a patients' teeth and adjacent hard tissue.Carranza's Clinical Periodontology, 9th Ed., W.B. Saunders 2002, page 435. This is often abbreviated as either FMS or FMX (or CMRS, meaning Complete Mouth Radiographic Series). The full mouth series is composed of 18 films, taken the same day: *four bitewings **two molar bitewings (left and right) **two premolar bitewings (left and right) *eight posterior periapicals **two maxillary molar periapicals (left and right) **two maxillary premolar periapicals (left and right) **two mandibular molar periapicals (left and right) **two mandibular premolar periapicals (left and right) *six anterior periapicals **two maxillary canine-lateral incisor periapicals (left and right) **two mandibular canine-lateral incisor periapicals (left and right) **two central incisor periapicals (maxillary and mandibular) The Faculty of General Dental Practice of the Royal College of Surgeons of England publication Selection Criteria in Dental Radiography holds that given current evidence full mouth series are to be discouraged due to the large numbers of radiographs involved, many of which will not be necessary for the patient's treatment. An alternative approach using bitewing screening with selected periapical views is suggested as a method of minimising radiation dose to the patient while maximizing diagnostic yield. Contrary to advice that emphasises only conducting radiographs when in the patient's interest, recent evidence suggests that they are used more frequently when dentists are paid under fee- for-service  Intra-oral radiographic techniques  Accurate positioning is of utmost importance to produce diagnostic radiographs and to avoid retakes, hence minimizing the radiation exposure of the patient. The requirements for ideal positioning include: * Tooth and image receptor (film packet or digital sensor) should be parallel to one another * The long axis of the image receptor is vertical for incisors and canines, and horizontal for premolars and molars. There should be enough receptor beyond the apices of the teeth for record of the apical tissues. * The X-ray beam from the tube-head should meet the tooth and the image receptor at right angles in both the vertical and horizontal planes * Positioning should be reproducible However, the anatomy of the oral cavity makes it challenging to satisfy the ideal positioning requirements. Two different techniques have hence been developed to be utilised in the undertaking of an intra-oral radiograph – Paralleling technique and Bisected angle technique. It is generally accepted that the paralleling technique offers more advantages than disadvantages, and gives a more reflective image, as compared to the bisecting angle technique. = Paralleling Technique = This can be used for both periapical and bitewing radiographs. The image receptor is placed in a holder and positioned parallel to the long axis of the tooth being imaged. The X-ray tube head is aimed at right angles, both vertically and horizontally, to both the tooth and the image receptor. This technique is advantageous as the teeth are viewed exactly parallel with the central ray and therefore there are minimal levels of object distortion. With the use of this technique, the positioning can be duplicated with the use of film holders. This makes the recreation of the image possible, which allows for future comparison. There is some evidence that the use of the paralleling technique reduces the radiation hazard to the thyroid gland, as compared to the use of the bisecting angle technique. = Bisecting Angle Technique = The bisecting angle technique is an older method for periapical radiography. It can be a useful alternative technique when the ideal receptor placement using the paralleling technique cannot be achieved, for reasons such as anatomical obstacles e.g. tori, shallow palate, shallow floor of mouth, or narrow arch width. This technique is based on the principle of aiming the central ray of the X-ray beam at 900 to an imaginary line which bisects the angle formed by the long axis of the tooth and the plane of the receptor. The image receptor is placed as close as possible to the tooth under investigation, without bending the packet. Applying the geometrical principle of similar triangles, the length of the tooth on the image will be the same as that of the actual length of the tooth in the mouth. The many inherent variables can inevitably result in image distortion and reproducible views are not possible with this technique. An incorrect vertical tube head angulation will result in foreshortening or elongation of the image, while an incorrect horizontal tube head angulation will cause overlapping of the crowns and roots of teeth. Many frequent errors that arise from the bisecting angle technique include: improper film positioning, incorrect vertical angulation, cone- cutting, and incorrect horizontal angulation. Extraoral radiographic views Placing the photographic film or sensor outside the mouth, on the opposite side of the head from the X-ray source, produces an extra-oral radiographic view. A lateral cephalogram is used to evaluate dentofacial proportions and clarify the anatomic basis for a malocclusion, and an antero-posterior radiograph provides a face-forward view. = Lateral cephalometric radiography = Lateral cephalometric radiography (LCR) is a standardized and reproducible form of skull radiography taken from the side of the face with precise positioning. It is used primarily in orthodontics and orthognathic surgery to assess the relationship of the teeth to the jaws, and the jaws to the rest of the facial skeleton. LCR is analyzed using cephalometric tracing or digitizing to obtain maximum clinical information. Indications of LCR include\\\\- * Diagnosis of skeletal and/or soft tissues abnormalities * Treatment planning * Baseline for monitoring treatment progress * Appraisal of orthodontic treatment and orthognathic surgery results * Assessment of unerupted, malformed, or misplaced teeth * Assessment of upper incisor root length * Clinical teaching and research =Panoramic films= mandibular condyles, the coronoid processes of the mandible, as well as the nasal cavity and the maxillary sinuses. Panoramic x-ray radiography of the teeth of a 64-year-old male shows dental work performed mostly in UK/Europe in last half of 20th century Panoramic films are extraoral films, in which the film is exposed while outside the patient's mouth, and they were developed by the United States Army as a quick way to get an overall view of a soldier's oral health. Exposing eighteen films per soldier was very time consuming, and it was felt that a single panoramic film could speed up the process of examining and assessing the dental health of the soldiers; as soldiers with toothache were incapacitated from duty. It was later discovered that while panoramic films can prove very useful in detecting and localizing mandibular fractures and other pathologic entities of the mandible, they were not very good at assessing periodontal bone loss or tooth decay.Carranza's Clinical Periodontology, 9th Ed., W.B. Saunders 2002, page 436. Computed tomography There is increasing use of CT (computed tomography) scans in dentistry, particularly to plan dental implants; there may be significant levels of radiation and potential risk. Specially designed CBCT (cone beam CT) scanners can be used instead, which produce adequate imaging with a stated tenfold reduction in radiation. Although computed tomography offers high quality images and accuracy, the radiation dose of the scans is higher than the other conventional radiography views, and its use should be justified. Controversy surrounds the degree of radiation reduction though as the highest quality cone beam scans use radiation doses not dissimilar to modern conventional CT scans.Dory, Miri (August 12, 2014). \\"Digital Dental Imaging in the Cloud\\", Cephx. = Cone beam computed tomography= Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), also known as digital volume tomography (DVT), is a special type of X-ray technology that generates 3D images. In the recent years, CBCT has been developed specifically for its use in the dental and maxillofacial areas to overcome the limitations of 2D imaging such as buccolingual superimposition. It is becoming the imaging modality of choice in certain clinical scenarios although clinical research justifies its limited use. CBCT Indications of CBCT, according to the SEDENTEXCT (Safety and Efficacy of a New and Emerging Dental X-ray Modality) guidelines include Developing dentition * Assessment of unerupted and/or impacted teeth * Assessment of external resorption * Assessment of cleft palate * Treatment planning for complex maxillofacial skeletal abnormalities Restoration of dentition (if conventional imaging is inadequate) * Assessment of infra-bony defects and furcation lesions * Assessment of root canal anatomy in multi-rooted teeth * Treatment planning of surgical endodontic procedures and complex endodontic treatments * Assessment of dental trauma Surgical * Assessment of lower third molars where intimate relationship with the inferior dental canal is suspected * Assessment of unerupted teeth * Prior to implant placement * Assessment of pathological lesions of the jaws (cysts, tumors, giant cell lesions, etc.) * Assessment of facial fractures * Treatment planning of orthognathic surgery * Assessment of bony elements of the maxillary antra and TMJ  Localisation Techniques  The concept of parallax was first introduced by Clark in 1909. It is defined as “the apparent displacement or difference in apparent direction of an object as seen from two different points not on a straight line with the object”. It is used to overcome the limitations of the 2D image in the assessment of relationships of structures in a 3D object. It is mostly used to ascertain the position of an unerupted tooth in relation to the erupted ones (i.e. if the unerupted tooth is buccally / palatally placed / in line of the arch). Other indications for radiographic localization include: separating the multiple roots/canals of teeth in endodontics, assessing the displacement of fractures, or determining the expansion or destruction of bone. * Horizontal parallax: Involves the taking of two radiographs at different horizontal angles, with the same vertical angulation. (E.g. 2 intra-oral periapical radiographs) ** Based on the rule of parallax, the more distant object will appear to move in the same direction as the tube shift, while the object which is nearer to the tube will appear to move in the opposite direction. (Same Lingual Opposite Buccal - SLOB rule) * Vertical parallax: Involves the taking of two radiographs at different vertical angulations (E.g. one periapical and one maxillary anterior occlusal; one maxillary anterior occlusal and one panoramic) * MBD Rule: Commonly employed in endodontics, the MBD rule states that when an exposure is given (about 5-7o) from the Mesial surface, the Buccal root or canal will lie to the Distal of the image With the rise in 3D radiographic techniques, the use of CBCT can be used to replace the undertaking of parallax radiographs, overcoming the limitations of the 2D radiographic technique. In cases of impacted teeth, the image obtained via CBCT can determine the buccal-palatal position and angulation of the impacted tooth, as well as the proximity of it to the roots of adjacent teeth and the degree of root resorption, if any.  Faults  Dental radiographs are an essential component to aid in diagnosis. Alongside an efficient clinical examination, a dental radiograph of a high quality can show essential diagnostic information crucial for the ongoing treatment planning for a patient. Of course when a dental radiograph is recorded many faults may arise. This is immensely variable due to differing use of: image receptor type, X-ray equipment, levels of training and processing materials etc. = General Faults = As previously stated a major difference in dental radiography is the versatile use of film vs digital radiography. This in itself leads to a long list of faults associated with each type of image receptor. Some typical film faults are discussed below with a variety of reasons as to why that fault has occurred.  Dark film  * Overexposure of the image from the use of faulty X-ray equipment and/or incorrect exposure time * Overdevelopment due to excessive time in developing agent * Developer either being too hot and/or too concentrated * Fogging due to poor storage conditions * Use of old stock * Faulty processing unit * Thin patient tissues (The differences in the tissues atomic number depicts the different attenuation of the X-ray beam. Also the penetrative power itself is a component to achieve adequate contrast)  Pale image  * Underexposure due to faulty X-ray equipment and/or incorrect exposure time * Underdeveloped due to inadequate time in developing agent * Developer either being too cold/dilute/exhausted * Developer contaminated by fixing agent * Excessively thick patient tissues * Film packet being back to front also results in a pale image accompanied by an embossed appearance from the lead pattern inside the image receptor packet. * Inadequate/low contrast due to: ** processing error ** under/overdeveloped ** developer contaminated by fixer ** inadequate fixing time ** fixer solution exhausted * Fogging due to: ** Poor storage conditions ** Poor stock control/out of date ** Faulty cassettes ** Faulty processing unit ** Exposure to white light * Lack of sharpness and clarity due to: ** Movement of patient/equipment during exposure ** Excessive bending of the film packet during exposure ** Poor film/screen contact within a cassette ** Speed of intensifying screens (the faster the screen the poorer the detail) ** Overexposure causing burn out edges of thin object (Cervical Burnout) ** Poor positioning in panoramic radiography * Marked Film due to: ** Bend/crimps in the film (dark lines) ** Careless handling of film in the darkroom leading to fingerprints and nail marks ** Splashes of chemicals before processing ** Patient biting too hard onto the film ** Dirty intensifying screens ** Static electricity causing a black starburst appearance * Green tint to the film due to Insufficient fixing * Double exposure which may occur when two images superimposed as a result of the receptor being used twice * Partial image due to: ** Failure to direct collimator to centre of image receptor ** Manual processing – developer level too low and film only partially submerged in developer = Exclusively Digital Faults = As film and digital are very different in how they work and how they are handled it is inevitable that their faults will also differ. Below is a list of some typical digital faults which may arise. It must be kept in mind that these also vary as per the type of digital image receptor which is used: * Thin white lines on PSP image ** Scratched phosphor plate * White areas on edge of PSP image ** Phosphor coating de-bonding * Areas of white “burn out” ** PSP underexposed or plate exposed to light before processing * Grainy digital image. ** Under exposed * Fine zig-zag line through image ** Dust in PSP scanner at level of laser * White curved area at corner of image ** PSP corner folder forward in mouth * Paler “finger shaped” area on image. ** Finger print on PSP surface. * Curved darker area corner of CCD ** Damage to photocells in solid state sensor * Paler portion of image ** Caused by bend across PSP * “Marble effect” to image ** PSP exposed to excessive heat = Faults In Processing = The potential faults associated with the choice of image receptor used have been covered, it should also be noted that other faults elsewhere in the process of formulating an ideal diagnostic radiograph can occur. The majority of these have already been mentioned due to other faults but due to processing inaccuracies alone these may occur: * blank/clear film due to the wrong sequence of solutions (the correct sequence should be develop, wash then fixer) * dark spots form due to developer drips on film before processing * white or blank spots due to fixer drops on film before processing * black or dark film due to an improper safelight or too warm a solution * partial image due to processing solutions being low, film not covered completely by solution, films touching sides of tanks and/or each other on belt * stained glass effect (reticulation) due to a large temperature difference of solution baths * yellow-brownish stains due to an improper water bath * stains from old solutions particularly the developer * risk of retaking on the same image receptor causing a double exposure to patient health implication = Faults In Technique = The training of staff is also an area which can lead to faults in the formulation of an ideal diagnostic radiograph. If someone is not adequately trained this can lead to discrepancies in pretty much any aspect in the process of achieving a diagnostic radiographic image. Below are some examples: * Foreshortening of image (causing the structures on the X-ray to appear too short). This is due to an excessive vertical angulation of the X-ray tube whilst taking the radiograph. * Elongation of the image refers to a lengthening effect on the structures of the X-ray which is due to a decreased vertical angulation of the X-ray tube * Sometimes due to a bend in the film can lead to an elongation effect on just a few teeth rather than the whole image * Overlapping of proximal surfaces is an error of improper horizontal angulation of the image receptor, either being too far forward or backward in respect the X-ray beam * Slanting of the occlusal plane is when the film In the patient’s mouth has been improperly placed as the occlusal plane should parallel to the margin of the film * Apical region not visible * Blurred distorted – movement * Cone cut appearance which may occur when the X-ray beam is not positioned perpendicular over the film * Double exposure occurs when two images are taken on one radiograph * Reversible film * Crimp marks * Light image * Dark image * Image geometry: of which it compiles of the X-ray beam, object and image receptor all of which depend on a specific relationship to each other. Object and film should be in contact or as close together as possible, object and film should be parallel to one another and the X-ray tube head should be positioned so that beam meets the object and the film at right angles. * Characteristics of the X-ray Beam: ideal beam should be able to sufficiently penetrate the film emulsion to produce good contrast, parallel and have a focal trough = Image Quality Scale = It is inevitable that some faults may occur despite the efforts of prevention, so a set of criteria for what is an acceptable image has been created. This has to be implemented so that the amount of re-exposure to a patient is minimal in order to get a diagnostic image and to improve the manner in which radiographs are taken in practice. When considering the quality of a radiographic image there are many factors which come into play. These can be split into sub-categories such as: Radiographic Technique, Type of image receptor (film or digital) and/or the processing of the image. A combination of all these factors are taken into account alongside the quality of the image itself to determine a specific grade for the image to determine if it is up to a standard for diagnostic use or not. The following grades are seen below: * Rate 1 is given when there is an excellent quality image where no errors are prevalent in patient preparation, exposure, positioning, processing and/or film handling. * Rate 2 is given when there is a diagnostically acceptable image where some error of patient preparation, exposure, positioning, processing and/or film handling. Although these errors may be prevalent they do not detract from the diagnostic utility of the radiograph. * Rate 3 is given when there are significant errors in patient preparation, exposure, film handling, processing and/or positioning which renders the radiograph diagnostically unacceptable These all have criteria to fill to fit into each grade. Due to a Grade 3 being diagnostically unacceptable all efforts must be put into place to minimise any faults and to maintain a high standard of Grade 1 and 2 films. In the “Radiographic Guidance Notes 2001” there are minimum and interim targets for each grade. For a Grade 1 the target is to be no less than 50% of radiographs taken annually but is realistically not less than 70%, Grade 2 target is to be no less than 40% but is ideally not greater than 20% whereas grade 3 target should be no greater than 10% which is realistically upheld. = Film Reject Analysis = To maintain a high standard of Grade 1 and 2 images each film needs to be examined to put the image into a specific category. In simplistic terms as depicted by the World Health Organisation, ‘this is a well designed quality assurance programme which should be comprehensive but inexpensive to operate and maintain.” The aim of the quality assurance is to continually achieve diagnostic radiographs of consistently high standards, therefore reducing the number of repeat radiographs by determining all sources of error to allow their correction. This, in turn, will then reduce the exposure to the patient keeping the doses as low as reasonably possible as well as keeping a low cost. How quality assurance is carried out consists of close monitoring of image quality on a day to day basis, comparing each radiograph to one of a high standard. If a film does not reach this standard it goes through the process of film reject analysis. The X-ray equipment is also something to acknowledge and ensure that it is always compliant with the current regulations. As stated above a grade 3 is diagnostically unacceptable and so cannot be used for further treatment of that patient. Instead of just disregarding these images there is a film reject analysis where all grade 3 films are collected and examined to determine the reason/s behind their unacceptable status.

Many local, long distance, and operator circuit-switching systems provided special dedicated circuits to the SES to monitor the quality of customer connections during the call setup process. Calls were selected at random by switching systems and one-way voice connections were established to the SES monitoring center. During this era, most voice connections used analog trunk circuits that were designed to conform with the Via Net Loss plan established by Bell Laboratories. The purpose of the VNL plan and five-level long distance switching hierarchy was to minimize the number of trunk circuits in a call and maximize the voice quality of the connections. Excessive loss in a voice connection meant that subscribers may have difficulty hearing each other. This was particularly important in the 1960s when dial up data connections were developed with the use of analog modems. The SES evaluated multi-frequency outpulsing signaling as well as voice impairments including sound amplitude, noise, echo, and a variety of other parameters. Deployment of common-channel signaling systems such as Common Channel Interoffice Signaling and later Signaling System #7 obviated the need to monitor multi-frequency signaling as it became obsolete. The Service Evaluation System was described in Notes on the Network published by AT&T; in 1970, 1975, 1980 and later versions published by Bell Communications Research (now Telcordia Technologies) in 1983, 1986, 1990, 1994, and 2000.

The picture was produced by Pablo Bossi, Pedro D'Angelo, Diego Dubcovsky and José María Morales. It features Alfredo Casero as Julián and Ingrid Rubio as the air hostess Teresa.. The metaphorical romantic comedy-drama is about a widowed ophthalmologist and a free-spirited airline flight-attendant (who the director believes seems to hold a certain fascination in western culture). Plot The story tells of Julián (Alfredo Casero) an overweight ophthalmologist who is emotionally upset due to the unexpected death of his flight-attendant wife and of Teresa (Ingrid Rubio) a free-spirited young stewardess unhappy in love and fearful that she's pregnant. Julián makes the decision to travel to the Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego, where he and his wife first met, in order to scatter his wife's ashes and to follow his wife in death by ending his own life by freezing to death. At the end of a cold ski lift ride, Julián meets Teresa when they both attempt to commit suicide at the same time by standing out in the snow. Instead of tragedy, they decide get a warm drink and begin to grow to like each other. After spending the night together, they depart. Teresa is a bit upset that she's late for work and blames Julián. She tries to get back to work but has problems because of terrorist threats at the airport. Julián, crashes his rental, but survives and spends a long time in the hospital recovering. He starts to appreciate life again and tries to find her. Fate pushes them back together.

Critical reception Reviewer Fred Thom, writing for the La Plume Noir, liked the look of the film, and wrote, \\"The director multiplies allegories, making the stewardess an angel whose wings would be those of a plane while the hospital shown to us like a corridor towards another life. The images pass slowly, posed and quiet, supported by an atmospheric soundtrack, making Every Stewardess Goes To Heaven a visually bewitching work.\\"Thom, Fred. Le Plume Noir, film review, 2003. Film citic Neil Young liked the film and wrote, \\"Burman aims to craft a frothy lampoon of people whose are fine in the air, hopeless on the ground. While some of the aeroplane-terrorism jokes may seem somewhat awkward post-9/11, it’s hard to avoid being carried along: like the cobbled-together plane we keep hearing about through the film, this may be a slightly ungainly and enterprise, but it gets quite nimbly from A to B.\\"Young, Neil. Jigsaw Lounge, film review, March 15, 2002. Jonathan Holland, critic for Variety magazine, liked the film and its quirky themes, writing \\"A delightful, offbeat romance that combines melancholy and mirth in just the right amounts, Daniel Burman's Every Stewardess Goes to Heaven is a worthy addition to the list of acclaimed pics that have emerged from Argentina recently, as well as a fine followup to Burman's multiple prize-winning (but very different) Waiting for the Messiah (1999). Ingrid Rubio, a sometimes shaky screen presence to date, finds her feet in this sentimental but intelligent story with quirky yet believable characters and stunning polar-circle settings. Charming fable about how people whom life has turned cold must learn to warm up again was well received at the Berlin fest, and further such showings are likely, though that's less than the movie deserves.\\"Holland, Jonathan.

These are the part of the algebraic topology of V that is directly accessible by algebraic methods. Understanding the algebraic cycles on a variety can give profound insights into the structure of the variety. The most trivial case is codimension zero cycles, which are linear combinations of the irreducible components of the variety. The first non-trivial case is of codimension one subvarieties, called divisors. The earliest work on algebraic cycles focused on the case of divisors, particularly divisors on algebraic curves. Divisors on algebraic curves are formal linear combinations of points on the curve. Classical work on algebraic curves related these to intrinsic data, such as the regular differentials on a compact Riemann surface, and to extrinsic properties, such as embeddings of the curve into projective space. While divisors on higher- dimensional varieties continue to play an important role in determining the structure of the variety, on varieties of dimension two or more there are also higher codimension cycles to consider. The behavior of these cycles is strikingly different from that of divisors. For example, every curve has a constant N such that every divisor of degree zero is linearly equivalent to a difference of two effective divisors of degree at most N. David Mumford proved that, on a smooth complete complex algebraic surface S with positive geometric genus, the analogous statement for the group \\\\operatorname{CH}^2(S) of rational equivalence classes of codimension two cycles in S is false.Mumford, David, Rational equivalence of 0-cycles on surfaces, J. Math. Kyoto Univ. 9-2 (1969) 195–204. The hypothesis that the geometric genus is positive essentially means (by the Lefschetz theorem on (1,1)-classes) that the cohomology group H^2(S) contains transcendental information, and in effect Mumford's theorem implies that, despite \\\\operatorname{CH}^2(S) having a purely algebraic definition, it shares transcendental information with H^2(S). Mumford's theorem has since been greatly generalized.Voisin, Claire, Chow Rings, Decomposition of the Diagonal, and the Topology of Families, Annals of Mathematics Studies 187, February 2014, . The behavior of algebraic cycles ranks among the most important open questions in modern mathematics. The Hodge conjecture, one of the Clay Mathematics Institute's Millenium Prize Problems, predicts that the topology of a complex algebraic variety forces the existence of certain algebraic cycles. The Tate conjecture makes a similar prediction for étale cohomology. Alexander Grothendieck's standard conjectures on algebraic cycles yield enough cycles to construct his category of motives and would imply that algebraic cycles play a vital role in any cohomology theory of algebraic varieties. Conversely, Alexander Beilinson proved that the existence of a category of motives implies the standard conjectures. Additionally, cycles are connected to algebraic K-theory by Bloch's formula, which expresses groups of cycles modulo rational equivalence as the cohomology of K-theory sheaves.  Definition  Let X be a scheme which is finite type over a field k. An algebraic r-cycle on X is a formal linear combination :\\\\sum n_i [V_i] of r-dimensional closed integral k-subschemes of X. The coefficient ni is the multiplicity of Vi. The set of all r-cycles is the free abelian group :Z_r X = \\\\bigoplus_{V \\\\subseteq X} \\\\mathbf{Z} \\\\cdot [V], where the sum is over closed integral subschemes V of X. The groups of cycles for varying r together form a group :Z_* X = \\\\bigoplus_r Z_r X. This is called the group of algebraic cycles, and any element is called an algebraic cycle. A cycle is effective or positive if all its coefficients are non-negative. Closed integral subschemes of X are in one-to-one correspondence with the scheme- theoretic points of X under the map that, in one direction, takes each subscheme to its generic point, and in the other direction, takes each point to the unique reduced subscheme supported on the closure of the point. Consequently Z_* X can also be described as the free abelian group on the points of X. A cycle \\\\alpha is rationally equivalent to zero, written \\\\alpha \\\\sim 0, if there are a finite number of (k + 1)-dimensional subvarieties W_i of X and non-zero rational functions r_i \\\\in k(W_i)^\\\\times such that \\\\alpha = \\\\sum [\\\\operatorname{div}_{W_i}(r_i)], where \\\\operatorname{div}_{W_i} denotes the divisor of a rational function on Wi. The cycles rationally equivalent to zero are a subgroup Z_r(X)_{\\\\text{rat}} \\\\subseteq Z_r(X), and the group of r-cycles modulo rational equivalence is the quotient :A_r(X) = Z_r(X) / Z_r(X)_{\\\\text{rat}}. This group is also denoted \\\\operatorname{CH}_r(X). Elements of the group :A_*(X) = \\\\bigoplus_r A_r(X) are called cycle classes on X. Cycle classes are said to be effective or positive if they can be represented by an effective cycle. If X is smooth, projective, and of pure dimension N, the above groups are sometimes reindexed cohomologically as :Z^{N - r} X = Z_r X and :A^{N - r} X = A_r X. In this case, A^* X is called the Chow ring of X because it has a multiplication operation given by the intersection product. There are several variants of the above definition. We may substitute another ring for integers as our coefficient ring. The case of rational coefficients is widely used. Working with families of cycles over a base, or using cycles in arithmetic situations, requires a relative setup. Let \\\\phi \\\\colon X \\\\to S, where S is a regular Noetherian scheme. An r-cycle is a formal sum of closed integral subschemes of X whose relative dimension is r; here the relative dimension of Y \\\\subseteq X is the transcendence degree of k(Y) over k(\\\\overline{\\\\phi(Y)}) minus the codimension of \\\\overline{\\\\phi(Y)} in S. Rational equivalence can also be replaced by several other coarser equivalence relations on algebraic cycles. Other equivalence relations of interest include algebraic equivalence, homological equivalence for a fixed cohomology theory (such as singular cohomology or étale cohomology), numerical equivalence, as well as all of the above modulo torsion. These equivalence relations have (partially conjectural) applications to the theory of motives. Flat pullback and proper pushforward There is a covariant and a contravariant functoriality of the group of algebraic cycles. Let f : X → X' be a map of varieties. If f is flat of some constant relative dimension (i.e. all fibers have the same dimension), we can define for any subvariety Y' ⊂ X': : f^*([Y']) = [f^{-1}(Y')]\\\\,\\\\\\\\! which by assumption has the same codimension as Y′. Conversely, if f is proper, for Y a subvariety of X the pushforward is defined to be :f_*([Y]) = n [f(Y)]\\\\,\\\\\\\\! where n is the degree of the extension of function fields [k(Y) : k(f(Y))] if the restriction of f to Y is finite and 0 otherwise. By linearity, these definitions extend to homomorphisms of abelian groups :f^* \\\\colon Z^k(X') \\\\to Z^k(X) \\\\quad\\\\text{and}\\\\quad f_* \\\\colon Z_k(X) \\\\to Z_k(X') \\\\,\\\\\\\\! (the latter by virtue of the convention) are homomorphisms of abelian groups. See Chow ring for a discussion of the functoriality related to the ring structure.

Although the Senate must confirm certain principal officers (including ambassadors, Cabinet secretaries, and federal judges), Congress may by law delegate the Senate's advice and consent role when it comes to \\"inferior\\" officers (to the President alone, or the courts of law, or the heads of departments). Text Appointments Clause aspects =Advice and consent= The Appointments Clause confers plenary power to the President to nominate various officials. It also confers plenary power to the Senate to reject or confirm a nominee, through its advice and consent provision. As with other separation of powers provisions in the Constitution, the wording here seeks to ensure accountability and preempt tyranny. This separation of powers between the President and Senate is also present in the (immediately preceding) Treaty Clause of the Constitution, which gives international treaty-making power to the President, but attaches to it the proviso of the Senate's advice and consent. Several framers of the U.S. Constitution explained that the required role of the Senate is to advise the President after the nomination has been made by the President.Currie, David. The Constitution in Congress: The Federalist Period, 1789-1801, page 25 (University of Chicago Press 1997) via Google Books: “Madison, Jefferson, and Jay all advised Washington not to consult the Senate before making nominations.”Hamilton, Alexander. Federalist No. 76 (1788): “In the act of nomination his judgment alone will be exercised.” Roger Sherman believed that advice before nomination could still be helpful.Letter from Roger Sherman to John Adams (July 1789) in The Founders Constitution: \\"their advice may enable him to make such judicious appointments.\\" Likewise, President George Washington took the position that pre-nomination advice was allowable but not mandatory.U.S. Senate history on the power to advise and consent: \\"In selecting nominees, Washington turned to his closest advisers and to members of Congress, but the president resolutely insisted that he alone would be responsible for the final selection. He shared a common view that the Senate's constitutionally mandated 'advice' was to come after the nomination was made.\\" The notion that pre-nomination advice is optional has developed into the unification of the \\"advice\\" portion of the power with the \\"consent\\" portion, although several Presidents have consulted informally with Senators over nominations and treaties. The actual motion adopted by the Senate when exercising the power is \\"to advise and consent\\", which shows how initial advice on nominations and treaties is not a formal power exercised by the Senate.[ U.S. Senate Rule 30]: \\"On the final question to advise and consent to the ratification in the form agreed to, the concurrence of two-thirds of the Senators present shall be necessary to determine it in the affirmative.\\"[ U.S. Senate Rule 31]: \\"the final question on every nomination shall be, 'Will the Senate advise and consent to this nomination?'\\" On Nov. 21, 2013, the Senate changed its rules regarding the number of votes needed to end debate on a presidential nomination and bring it to a vote. Before that date, a minority of senators could engage in a filibuster and block a vote on a nomination unless three-fifths of senators voted to end debate. Under the new rules, a simple majority is all that is needed to end debate. The only exception was for nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States, which could still be blocked from going to a vote by a filibuster, until the Senate rules were again changed on April 6th, 2017 during Senate debate on the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Congress itself may not exercise the appointment power; its functions are limited to the Senate's role in advice and consent, and to deciding whether to vest a direct appointment power over a given office in the President, a Head of Department, or the Courts of Law. The Framers of the U.S. Constitution were particularly concerned that Congress might seek to exercise the appointment power and fill offices with their supporters, to the derogation of the President's control over the executive branch. The Appointments Clause thus functions as a restraint on Congress and as an important structural element in the separation of powers. Attempts by Congress to circumvent the Appointments Clause, either by making appointments directly, or through devices such as \\"unilaterally appointing an incumbent to a new and distinct office\\" under the guise of legislating new duties for an existing office, have been rebuffed by the courts. =Appointment of inferior officers= The Appointments Clause distinguishes between officers of the United States who must be appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate; and inferior officers specified by acts of Congress, some of whom may be appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate, but whose appointment Congress may place instead in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments. An earlier proposed draft of the Appointments Clause would have given the President a broader power to \\"appoint officers in all cases not otherwise provided for by this Constitution,\\" but some delegates of the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention worried that this language would permit the President to create offices as well as to fill them, a classic case of institutional corruption. The requirement that the President can appoint inferior officers only when Congress has \\"by Law vest[ed]\\" that power in the President sought to preclude that possibility. One chief questions recurs under the \\"by Law\\" language: Who are \\"inferior Officers,\\" not subject to the requirement of advice and consent; and (2) what constitutes a \\"Department,\\" when Congress seeks to place the appointment power away from the President? As an initial matter, most government employees are not officers and thus are not subject to the Appointments Clause. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court held that only those appointees \\"exercising significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States\\" are \\"Officers of the United States,\\" and hence it is only those who exercise such \\"significant authority\\" who must be appointed by a mechanism set forth in the Appointments Clause. The Framers of the U.S.A Constitution did not define the line between principal officers and inferior officers, and the Supreme Court has been content to approach the analysis on a case-by-case basis rather than through a definitive test. The Court listed in Morrison v. Olson (1988) certain factors as hallmarks of \\"inferior Officer\\" status, such as removability by a higher executive branch official other than the President, and limitations on the officer's duties, jurisdiction, and tenure. In Edmond v. United States (1997) the Court stated that \\"‘inferior Officers' are officers whose work is directed and supervised at some level by others who were appointed by Presidential nomination with the advice and consent of the Senate.\\" Among those officers recognized as \\"inferior\\" are district court clerks, federal supervisors of elections, the Watergate Special Prosecutor, and an Independent Counsel appointed under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. In Lucia v. SEC, 585 U.S. ___ (2018), decided in June 2018, the United States Supreme Court held that administrative law judges are Inferior Officers within the meaning of the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution. =Appointments by heads of departments= Another chief question is, what constitutes a \\"Department,\\" when Congress seeks to place the appointment power away from the President? The phrase \\"Heads of Departments\\" has not been precisely defined by the Supreme Court. On the one hand, judicial interpretations of the phrase refer to the heads of departments that are within the executive branch, or according to Buckley v. Valeo \\"at least have some connection with that branch.\\" Under this view, the heads of all agencies and departments exercising executive power under the President would seem to qualify as \\"Heads of Departments.\\" The Court interpreted in Freytag v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (1991) \\"Heads of Departments\\" to refer \\"to executive divisions like the Cabinet-level departments.\\" The use of the phrase \\"like the Cabinet-level departments\\" could mean that, in addition to the Cabinet departments, other entities within the executive branch that are sufficiently analogous to the Cabinet departments may qualify as \\"Departments\\" for purposes of the Appointments Clause. On the other hand, the Freytag Court itself seemed unclear what it meant by the phrase \\"like the Cabinet-level departments,\\" and certainly stepped back from any bright-line test. The Freytag Court sought to harmonize its analysis with the interpretation given the different term \\"executive Departments\\" in the Opinion Clause (which has been interpreted to refer only to Cabinet departments) and with earlier cases that suggested that only the Cabinet Secretaries qualified as \\"Heads of Departments.\\" Ultimately, the Freytag Court seems to have reserved the question whether the heads of non-Cabinet executive-branch agencies could be deemed to be \\"Heads of Departments\\" for purposes of the Appointments Clause. Perhaps the phrase \\"like the Cabinet- level departments\\" was included in Freytag as an indication that the Court would not necessarily be inflexible about requiring Cabinet status in future cases. If that is so, then \\"Heads of Departments\\" would appear to include (as Justice Antonin Scalia reasons in his concurrence in Freytag) the heads of the Cabinet Departments and also the heads of \\"all independent executive establishments.\\" From 1999 to 2008, a change in the statute governing the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\\"USPTO\\") permitted a number of judges of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences and the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to be appointed by the USPTO Director. This arrangement was challenged as unconstitutional under the Appointments Clause because the appointing party was not the Heads of the Department.Translogic Technology, Inc. v. Dudas, U.S., No. 07-1303, 10/6/08. In order to avoid the crisis that would result from new challenges to many BPAI and TTAB decisions made in that period, Congress passed a 2008 amendment to the statute which specifies that the Secretary of Commerce is responsible for such appointments, and permitting the Secretary to retroactively appoint those persons named by the USPTO Director.

Biography Born in 1609 at San Giovanni Bianco, a town in the Brembana Valley in the province of Bergamo, Ceresa was a pupil and then assistant of the Milanese painter Daniele Crespi, whose style and vocabulary lived on in his work after the master’s death in 1630. He was active in the area of Bergamo and produced a large number of religious works characterised by a sober, understated approach combined with the vivid color of the Veneto school for the many churches and sanctuaries there. He was also a skilful portrait painter whose services were sought after by the noble families of the city. The naturalism pervading the depiction of his subjects recalls the work of Moroni and looks forward to Fra Galgario and Ceruti (Pitochetto). He died in Bergamo in 1679.

Unlike most of the other installments of the series, this episode was not based on a novel by Bernard Cornwell. Plot summary After a prologue set in 1810, which introduces Major Brand (Mark Strong), a British officer serving with Richard Sharpe (Sean Bean), the plot fast-forwards to present-day 1813, where France is losing the war. Major Sharpe is teamed with Brand, now a Colonel renowned for leading a small band of soldiers operating far behind enemy lines. Wellington (Hugh Fraser) assigns them the task of blowing up a store of gunpowder vital to French General Calvet (Olivier Pierre). To do this, they need the expertise of explosives expert Major Pyecroft (Nigel Betts). Major General Ross (James Laurenson), Wellington's head of military intelligence, will accompany them to evaluate Calvet's intentions. Meanwhile, a Gypsy family stumbles upon a secret meeting between a French colonel and a masked Colonel Brand, with one of his men. The interrupted plotters pursue and kill the Gypsies, except for a young woman, Zara (Berrin Politi), who manages to hide. Afterwards, she starts to bury her dead parents, only to flee when another masked man appears. However, it turns out to be Pyecroft, whose face was disfigured by a bomb accident. He digs the graves and takes Zara under his protection. In the British encampment, Zara spots one of her family's horses and tells Pyecroft that the murderers spoke English; next day three gypsies, with whom Zara was to have stayed, are found garrotted. Sharpe's suspicions are aroused by the unexplained deaths and Brand's assumption that 'Pyecroft's gypsy' was among them. As their joint mission unfolds, Sharpe realizes Brand is a traitor and French spy, luring them in order to trap Ross for his knowledge of Wellington's plans. Forewarned, Sharpe is able to turn the tables on the turncoat. After Sharpe's men capture the fort where the gunpowder is stored, he has Ross convene a court-martial, in which Brand is convicted and sentenced to death. Fearing that Brand's influential friends may be able to overturn the verdict, Sharpe conducts an impromptu execution by pushing the traitor into a deep well. The British blow up the gunpowder and escape, while Brand's men are given the opportunity to redeem themselves by acting as a rearguard to hold off the attacking French forces. However all is not well for Sharpe. His wife Jane (Abigail Cruttenden) is becoming more and more dissatisfied with his career as a soldier. Nonetheless a would-be seducer is foiled by Harris, acting as manservant. Pyecroft and Zara become engaged.

He was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States. Recording career =The Rationals= Morgan's first band was The Rationals. In the early years the band went through several lineup changes but in the end, the lineup consisted of Scott Morgan (guitars and vocals), Steve Correll (guitars), Terry Trabandt (bass guitar) and Bill Figg (drums). The band started out playing instrumental blues and surf-inspired music but in 1964 the band played a cover of Barrett Strong's \\"Money\\", which was noticed by manager Jeep Holland. The band soon started to record their music and started touring. In 1968 the MC5 opened for the band when the Five were recording their debut live LP. By the late 60's there was tension building within the band and both Iggy Pop and Scott Asheton were considered as replacements for drummer Bill Figg, and Terry Trabandt was supposedly considering leaving the band. In 1969 the band recorded their self-titled LP which was released in 1970. After an argument at the Embassy Hotel Lounge in Windsor, Ontario, the band finally decided to break up. Morgan then briefly regrouped with a band called Guardian Angel with his brother David on drums and Wayne \\"Tex\\" Gabriel on guitar. = Sonic's Rendezvous Band = After Guardian Angel Morgan joined up with former MC5 guitarist Fred \\"Sonic\\" Smith, drummer Scott Asheton of The Stooges and \\"Lightnin'\\" Gary Rasmussen in the late 1970s to form the Detroit rock supergroup Sonic's Rendezvous Band. The band only officially recorded in a studio once, which resulted in the \\"City Slang\\" single (self-released on their own label, Orchid). The only other studio track to have been released from the session is \\"Electrophonic Tonic,\\" which was considered as a b-side for the \\"City Slang\\" single. However, for reasons now unknown, it was decided that the single would have a stereo version of \\"City Slang\\" on the a-side and a mono version on the b-side. By 1980 the band decided to go their separate ways. In the ensuing years, many bootlegs from the band's high energy live shows at venues such as Detroit's Bookies and Ann Arbor's Second Chance were passed around by fans. Due to the lack of recorded material, the band remained a mystery to many. Later, many of the bootleged recordings would be remastered and released by Mack Aborn Rhythmic Arts in 1999. =The Scott Morgan band and Scott's Pirates= During the 1980s, Morgan formed the Scott Morgan Band, which occasionally played in the Ann Arbor/Detroit area. In 1988, his band released an album entitled \\"Rock Action,\\" which found Morgan (guitar and vocals) backed up by ex-Sonic's Rendezvous bassist Gary Rasmussen and ex- Stooges drummer Scott (aka \\"Rock Action\\") Asheton. The trio later toured in America under the name Scotts Pirates, which took its name from Morgan's song \\"Pirate Music,\\" and released their self-titled album included two tracks from the Rock Action. Rock Action was followed up in 1996 with the record Revolutionary Means in 1996. The same year Scott teamed up with Wayne Kramer of the MC5 and Deniz Tek under the name Dodge Main. The band played live together around the midwest and recorded an eponymous album. One of the shows was recorded however it has not yet been released. In 1998 Morgan teamed up with Swedish rock band The Hellacopters on their U.S tour which led to the EP Scott Morgan and The Hellacopters. =The Hydromatics and The Solution= The Hydromatics was formed by Hellacopters frontman Nicke Andersson (a.k.a. Nick Royale), Tony Slug and Theo Brouwer of Amsterdam punk band Nitwitz. The band was formed during The Hellacopters 1998 tour in America and in 1999 Andersson and Morgan meet up with in Amsterdam with Slug and Brouwer. The band rehearsed for six days before heading out and doing three small clubgigs in Amsterdam and later record their debut album Parts Unknown. During a six-week tour the band also recorded a live CD before Andersson had to leave the band due to his commitments with his other band. He was soon replaced by Andy Frost and in 2001 the second album Powerglide was released and in 2003 the group was disbanded. In 2001 Scott Morgan and Deniz Tek toured extensively in France and Italy with members of the group \\"Sonic Assassin\\" (Romano Pasquini, Pippo Pasquini, and Stefano Constantini). A live album resulted, under the name \\"3 Assassins\\". After the demise of The Hydromatics Morgan once again teamed up with Nicke Andersson in 2004 to form what was initially called Soulmover, but later renamed The Solution. The group recorded their debut album Communicate! in Sweden with an all-Swedish line up of musicians, which was followed by a short tour in the Nordic region.

Role in the play Touchstone is the court jester of Duke Frederick, the usurper's court. Throughout the play he comments on the other characters and thus contributes to a better understanding of the play. Touchstone falls in love with a dull-witted goat girl named Audrey. William, an oafish country boy, makes clumsy attempts to woo her as well, but is driven off by Touchstone, who threatens to kill him \\"a hundred and fifty ways\\". Eventually Touchstone marries Audrey, but a prediction is made that the relationship will not last. Audrey doesn't love Touchstone in the real sense of the feeling but only to become a courtly lady. She is a rustic countrywoman. Touchstone is not a self-centered and selfish man, as is shown when he is willing to follow Celia into the forest of Arden for the simple reason as to be a comfort on the journey and as a security too. Touchstone is thought to be a witty or clever fool, although Rosalind and Celia jokingly say that he is a \\"natural\\" fool (\\"Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of Nature's wit\\" and \\"hath sent this natural for our whetstone\\").Stephen J. Lynch, As You Like it: A Guide to the Play, Greenwood: 2013, p. 46-47Sujata Iyengar, ed., Shakespeare's Medical Language: A Dictionary, Bloomsbury, 2014, 'natural'. Often he tries to show off his wit and intelligence by making some wise comments and references. Touchstone compares himself to Ovid and Jaques likens him to Jove in Ovid's Metamorphoses. The word \\"touchstone\\" appears in Book II of the second 1575 edition of Arthur Golding's translation of this work. in which Mercury tricks Battus into revealing the whereabouts of the cattle of Apollo which Mercury himself has stolen and punishes Battus by turning him into a touchstone. In Shakespeare's Clown, David Wiles suggests that Robert Armin played the part of Touchstone in the first productions of As You Like It (p. 145). The addition of Armin to the Chamberlain's Men in 1599 and the character of Touchstone marked the beginning of a series of court fool characters; these characters differed greatly from earlier Shakespearean fools, typically played by William Kempe, because their humour is mainly derived from the fool's wit and intellect. The earlier fools of this period were often nothing but stooges. References Bibliography * Wiles, David. Shakespeare's Clown. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 1987, .

The write-off removes or reduces the asset from the financial books and results in lower net income for that year. The objective is to ‘take one big bath’ in a single year so future years will show increased net income. This technique is often employed in a year when sales are down from other external factors and the company would report a loss in any event. For example, inventory valued on the books at $100 per item is written down to $50 per item resulting in a net loss of $50 per item in the current year. Note there is no cash impact to this write-down. When that same inventory is sold in later years for $75 per item, the company reports an income of $25 per item in the future period. This process takes an inventory loss and turns it into a 'profit'. Corporations will often wait until a bad year to employ this 'big bath' technique to 'clean up' the balance sheet. Although the process is discouraged by auditors, it is still used. In recent times, General Motors and other US Corporations have taken huge write downs on balance sheet assets resulting in massive losses. The same result can be achieved by recording in one year the future cash costs of expected plant closing or employee layoffs. The objective is to take these losses all at once, so future periods can show positive net income.  Incentives  The incentives behind this earnings management technique varies. A widespread belief of why companies utilize this technique is to improve external reputation and appeal to investors and creditors. In most large corporations, managers are in charge of financial reporting. This gives managers the incentive of bias reporting to increase the reputation of their company and to attribute those gains to their own ability. Other possible reasons why some managers have the incentive to tamper with their company financial reporting is for higher salary and recognition of their abilities to increase profit. It is often believed that earning management activities are common before and after management changes. Thus, other incentives may possibly be led by management turnovers.  Earnings Management  Often time Managers use reporting strategies regardless if the external users are naive and ignore management's ability to manipulate earnings or if users are sophisticated and can accurately deduce the management's disclosure strategy. When times are bad for the corporations financially, as a financial reporting strategy, managers will under-report earnings by the maximum they can in the current period, in order to report higher future earnings. On the other hand, in both academic and business press, earnings management has negative connotations because it suggests the tampering of earnings by management at the disadvantage of investors and other external users. Furthermore, biased financial reporting goes against GAAP regulations. = Accounting Standards = One source finds that aside from manager's and auditor's incentives, accounting standards has a huge impact on earnings management behavior. Moreover, some have argued that the market rewards management for smoother earnings as well. International Accounting Reporting Standards (IFRS) restrict revised earning reports of companies who rely on big bath provisions to maintain their increase in income, even if they are only gaining a very minimal amount of earnings. IFRS is a global set of accounting standards that require companies to report accurate annual earnings. The standards are an accurate measurement of earnings because there is only a single standard rather than multiple standards that could present opportunity to Big Bath strategies.  Applications  In 2016, Samsung reported to have battery issues in the newest Note 7 release. The defective batteries accrued substantial financial costs of approximately three billion dollars from Samsung's reported four billion dollars of net profit. Some predict Samsung will implement the Big Bath technique to have a lower net income in 2016, then will increase in the following years. The Big Bath technique will allow Samsung to wash away bad debts. In a 2014 Wall Street Journal article, emerging banking CEOs are most likely to take Big Baths to increase banking performance and net profits in the following years. New CEOs attribute decrease in income in the first year to former CEOs. Initial artificial decrease in net income provides the illusion of an increased income in the next year.

It is adapted from a 1959 novel by Charles Beaumont. The story depicts the machinations of a racist named Adam Cramer (portrayed by Shatner), who arrives in the fictitious small Southern town of Caxton in order to incite white townspeople to racial violence against black townspeople and court-ordered school integration. The film is also known under its US reissue titles as I Hate Your Guts! and Shame, and The Stranger in the UK release. Plot In the early 1960s, Adam Cramer arrives in the small Southern town of Caxton with an agenda that soon becomes clear. Caxton's \\"whites only\\" high school is about to undergo forced desegregation and admit black students due to a court order, and Cramer, purportedly working on behalf of an organization called The Patrick Henry Society, is a racist working to incite the white townspeople to strongly and possibly violently resist the desegregation. Although Cramer is not from the area or even from the South (shown by his lack of a Southern accent), he quickly charms most of the people he meets, presenting himself as a confident, smooth-talking, well-mannered gentleman. He quickly convinces wealthy landowner Verne Shipman to back him, and seduces Ella, the pretty teenage daughter of the local newspaper editor Tom McDaniel. The white locals are not happy about having black students attend the \\"white school\\", but prior to Cramer's arrival, most were prepared to grudgingly comply with the law. However, after Cramer, with Shipman's help, makes an inflammatory speech in front of the town hall and organizes a cross burning in the black neighborhood, the whites are moved to violence, first threatening a black family who happen to be driving through town after Cramer's speech, and then blowing up the local black church, killing the preacher. After the church bombing, Cramer is jailed, but the locals join together to get him quickly released. Apart from his racist rabblerousing, Cramer also seduces Vi, the emotionally unstable wife of traveling salesman Sam Griffin, Cramer's next door neighbor at the Caxton hotel. Vi, ashamed of her lapse, leaves Griffin, who figures out what happened and comes after Cramer with Cramer's own gun. The terrified Cramer's confident facade crumbles for the first time; when he manages to get the gun and point it back at Griffin, he is too weak to pull the trigger, and Griffin reveals that he already removed the bullets from the gun before the confrontation. Griffin predicts that Cramer will soon lose control of the racially charged tensions that he has ignited in the town. McDaniel, after seeing Cramer in action, realizes that his own sympathies are with the blacks and feels compelled to stand with them against the racists. After the preacher is killed, the families of the black students hesitate to send their children back to the white high school for fear of more violence, but McDaniel encourages them, and walks the students to school himself through the town past the disapproving glares of other white townspeople. After the students enter the school, several townspeople confront and severely beat McDaniel, causing him to be hospitalized with broken ribs, internal injuries and the loss of his eye. Cramer secretly meets with Ella, who is upset and worried about her father, and convinces her that the townspeople are planning to kill her father and that the only way to save him is for Ella to do what Cramer says. Ella, following Cramer's directions, lures her black classmate Joey Green to a storage room on the pretext of helping her get some heavy boxes from a high shelf. She then screams and falsely accuses him of attempting to rape her. Joey denies it, and the principal believes him, but also knows that most people will believe Ella. An angry mob led by Cramer and Shipman forms in front of the school. Joey, rather than escape out the back door with the principal and attempt to reach the safety of the sheriff's office, insists on going out to confront the mob. Shipman beats Joey and the mob begins to lynch him on the school playground swing set. Suddenly Griffin appears with Ella, who confesses that she lied at Cramer's instigation in order to save her father's life. In front of the mob, Ella apologizes to Joey, telling him that Cramer said he would not be harmed and would only be expelled from the white school. Realizing that they have been manipulated by Cramer, the townspeople slowly walk away, ignoring Cramer's exhortations, until only he and Griffin are left on the empty playground. Griffin tells Cramer that his \\"work\\" in Caxton is finished and that he should catch the next bus out of town.

Charles Beaumont, George Clayton Johnson and William F. Nolan were all working screenwriters and novelists; all three of them make their only acting appearance in a feature film in The Intruder. Leo Gordon was also an established screenwriter, writing several novels and films, and over 50 teleplays for various shows, while maintaining a concurrent acting career. Star William Shatner would, years later, also write numerous novels and memoirs. Production The novel was published in 1958 and film rights were optioned by Seven Arts. They were unable to get the project off the ground, and Corman bought the rights in 1960. He tried to get the film made with producer Edward Small for United Artists but Small pulled out. He then envisioned the film costing $500,000 and starring Tony Randall. However, he was unable to raise enough money, with the movie being turned down by UA, Allied Artists and AIP. Corman managed to raise some funds from Pathé Labs, with Corman and his brother Gene putting in the balance.Roger Corman & Jim Jerome, How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never lost a Dime, Muller, 1990 p 98 Gene Corman later said: > We put our hearts, our souls – and what few people do – our money into this > picture. Everybody asked us 'Why would you make this picture?' as if to say > why try to do something you believe in when everything else is so > profitable. Obviously we did it because we wanted to, and we think it's a > damn good job. It was shot in black and white over three and a half weeks on location in southeast Missouri. Some of the production took place in East Prairie, Charleston and Sikeston. Corman presented a watered-down version of the script to the townspeople, but they still did not like it. Before it was finished, local people objected to the film's portrayal of racism and segregation.'Remembering The Intruder,' featurette with accompanying the DVD Special Edition https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0055019 Reception The movie received good reviews but encountered difficulty obtaining release.

It is located on the Rio Grande. The original name of Cieneguilla comes from the Spanish word \\"ciénaga\\" which means \\"marsh\\" or \\"marshy place\\". The swampy ground is caused by several streams running across a small flood plain formed by a bend in the Rio Grande. Because the area featured a flat plain with a constant source of water, it was long frequented by the Jicarilla Apache. The village's modern name of Pilar was adopted after its post office was incorporated in 1918. One story suggests that the name came from the daughter of the office's first postmaster,'Artistic discoveries in Pilar', R. Scott Gerdes, The Taos News, Sept. 11, 2008 who was named for the Nuestra Señora del Pilar apparition of the Virgin Mary, which appeared on an old Roman pillar in Zaragoza, Spain.

The club has strong ties with Dave Gallaher, the New Zealand rugby union footballer, best known as the captain of \\"The Originals\\". Gallaher is mentioned on the team crest, and the team plays its home games at Dave Gallaher Memorial Park in Letterkenny. It has seen success in producing quality players in recent years including Joe Dunleavy and Conor McMenamin who both have represented Ulster and Ireland in their according age groups History The club was founded when the town's rugby players, who were travelling to Derry and Limavady for games each week, decided to form their own club. A team was entered into the Ulster league and initial games were played at Robinson's Field on Letterkenny's Port Road. The following year the club purchased of land at Drumnahoagh near the Dry Arch Roundabout, not far from the town centre. In an ambitious move a club house and changing rooms were constructed. The club flourished for the next decade with a vibrant social scene and successfully ran three teams for many of those years. The club then opted a move to the Silver Tassie between Letterkenny and Ramelton and prepared new pitches to take the club to the next level and provide more space. In 1985 the club continued to flourish when the team won the Forester Cup in Ravenhill. Unfortunately the ownership of the Tassie passed out of club hands and the club underwent a period of decline. The third team failed to field from 1992 and for a while local interest in rugby waned. It was now very clear that the playing surfaces at the fields of Halfway Line were inadequate for rugby especially during the winter months..Letterkenny & District Christmas Annual 2006 Recent times The club is still thriving today thanks to the selfless contribution of its members. The club returned to Letterkenny in 1999 to lands bought at the Glebe and usage of Moore's field next to it. This move improved playing surfaces and made the club more accessible to the large population of Letterkenny. The club was promoted during the seasons of 2004, 2005, 2006. Many of the first team are now home grown players from Donegal and with the rapidly expanding Youth and Mini section this trend will continue to fill the senior teams. Letterkenny won the Gordon West cup in 2011 for the first time in their history after their fifth time in the final Letterkenny Rugby Club hosted an Ulster Rugby open training day in July 2018, with Irish captain Rory Best among those present, and also Jacob Stockdale, Iain Henderson and Stuart McCloskey .Rory Best and Ulster Rugby visit Letterkenny for an open training day, Donegal Now, 26 July 2018. Youth rugby Letterkenny has been at the forefront of developing an outlet for rugby in the North West over the last two decades. It has provided the county with the first underage rugby team, and also was the first rugby team in Donegal to win their section in the Ulster league in 2003, when the U-18's won Section C. With the efforts of Jim Moore, Jason Black, Allen McCrea, Dennis Faulkner,Dermot Dunleavy and others the club has expanded its management and playing members dramatically over the years. Letterkenny RFC now fields and trains teams from U-6's up to senior level, including Ladies (captained by dermot dunleavy), which has mirrored the successes of the Irish International team, and all the popularity it brings with it, to date. Although many of the underage players filter through to the 1st and 2nd XV, Letterkenny has also provided a much needed wealth of experience for those travelling to Senior clubs across the country as players move on to University and beyond. Late 2012 will see the opening of the new Clubhouse and 2013 will see the 40th anniversary of the club.

Built in 1931, it is the oldest funicular in Lithuania and is among the oldest vehicles of such type in the world still operational. The funicular is made of a wood-paneled coachwork and climbs up from behind the Vytautas the Great War Museum to the Basilica of the Resurrection. Opening ceremony of the Žaliakalnis Funicular Railway It was constructed by engineering firm Curt Rudolph Transportanlagen from Dresden, Germany with electrical equipment from AEG and mechanical parts from Bell Maschinenfabrik, Switzerland. The official opening was on 5 August 1931 with one passenger car, while the second car was only a platform ballasted with stones used to counterbalance the passenger car. The electric overhead power cable and the pantographs of the coaches are only used for lighting and heating of the cars. The upper station housed the electrically driven funicular mechanism in the basement, whilst the lower end of the line did not even have a shelter until 1932. The funicular succeeded and became very popular transportation for the city inhabitants and guests. It is known that about 5 million passengers were moved using it between 1950 and 1970. The funicular was renovated between 1935 and 1937. New, larger cars with car bodies from Napoleonas Dobkevičius on underframes from Bell Maschinenfabrik were built, and the lower station was given a proper building.

In connected graphs where shortest paths are well-defined (i.e. where there are no negative-length cycles), we may construct a shortest-path tree using the following algorithm: # Compute dist(u), the shortest-path distance from root v to vertex u in G using Dijkstra's algorithm or Bellman–Ford algorithm. # For all non-root vertices u, we can assign to u a parent vertex pu such that pu is connected to u, and that dist(pu) + edge_dist(pu,u) = dist(u). In case multiple choices for pu exist, choose pu for which there exists a shortest path from v to pu with as few edges as possible; this tie-breaking rule is needed to prevent loops when there exist zero-length cycles. # Construct the shortest-path tree using the edges between each node and its parent. The above algorithm guarantees the existence of shortest-path trees. Like minimum spanning trees, shortest-path trees in general are not unique. In graphs for which all edges weights equal one, shortest path trees coincide with breadth- first search trees.

Maria della Quercia The façade of S. Sisto Vecchio, remodelled by Raguzzini Filippo Raguzzini (19 July 1690 – 21 February 1771) was an Italian architect best known for a range of buildings constructed during the reign of Benedict XIII. Biography Raguzzini was born in Naples into a family of stonemasons. Little is known of his early history, but he was called to Benevento in the wake of the earthquake of 1702, which caused widespread destruction in the city. In Benevento, he came to the attention of Pietro Francesco Orsini, the then archbishop of Benevento for 38 years, who in 1724 became Benedict XIII. This encounter with Orsini would be of crucial significance for Raguzzini's later career. There is considerable scholarly debate about which works in Benevento should be attributed to Raguzzini's early period, but the chapel of San Gennaro in the church of the Annunziata (1710) is thought to be his work. Two later churches, San Filippo (1724–27) and San Bartolomeo (consecrated in 1729) in Benevento, are attributed to Raguzzini from the period after Benedict XIII's election. Once Benedict XIII was elected, Raguzzini moved to Rome and commenced a meteoric rise to the top of the papal architectural establishment. Official honours were lavished on him from as early as 1725, when he was made a Knight of the Golden Spur; in February 1727, he was elected an accademico di merito of the Accademia di San Luca. The pope's patronage saw Raguzzini ultimately serve in almost every major public architectural office in the city. The most significant posts he held were those in which he supplanted the much older and highly respected Roman architect, Alessandro Specchi, whose most important work, the Porto di Ripetta, had been executed in the reign of Clement XI: these roles were those of the architect of the popolo romano (essentially the city architect), the architect of the Tribunale delle acque e strade and the architect of the Sacri Palazzi Apostolici. Raguzzini held these offices from 1728, although they were nominally to be held by the incumbent for life. Specchi died in November 1729. Benedict XIII's reign was marked by financial mismanagement. Benedict himself practically vacated the temporal government of Rome and the Papal States, turning this over to Cardinal Niccolò Coscia who nearly bankrupted the State, and which ultimately led to the cardinal's temporary excommunication and imprisonment in the reign of Clement XII. As a result, few major architectural projects were started during Benedict's reign. The most significant projects executed in Rome by Raguzzini during Benedict's reign were the construction of the Ospedale di San Gallicano in Trastevere (1724 – 26), the erection of the church of Santa Maria della Quercia near the Palazzo Spada (1727 – 31) and the systematisation of Piazza Sant'Ignazio (1727 – 35). The construction of San Maria della Quercia, the church of the butchers’ guild (Università dei macellai) of Rome, appears to have been sponsored by Benedict XIII. The church is named for a miraculous image housed at Viterbo in the care of the Dominicans and, as Dominican himself, Benedict seems to have taken a keen interest in the church. Although renovated, this church is a masterpiece of the style of the 1720s – 1730s and is one of the few early 18th century churches in Rome built from the ground up and designed by a single person. Piazza Sant'Ignazio, surrounded by an ensemble of five residential buildings for the growing administration class of the city, is characterised by its complex interplay of ovoid shapes and the ingenious theatre-wing like construction. People walking from the nearby Piazza di Pietra find themselves suddenly emerging in Piazza S. Ignazio into a confrontation with the church, as if they had stumbled in from offstage. Although the decorative effect of the buildings is an important component of their overall effect, the ensemble signifies a significant departure from the typical operative logic of the anteposed piazza. Raguzzini subtly undermines the supremacy of the church in the church/piazza relationship typical of Counter-Reformation urban planning, and invests the space of the piazza itself with considerable energy and intrigue: in this way, the church has become a pendant to the piazza, rather than the reason for the piazza's existence. Raguzzini's other projects at this time were small commissions, including the renovation of the chapels of the Presepio in the baptistery of San Domenico and the chapel of the Crucifix in the Dominican church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva (1724–1726); the restoration of the church and convent of San Sisto Vecchio near the Baths of Caracalla (completed 1727); minor works in the Sistine Chapel of Santa Maria Maggiore (1725), in San Giovanni in Laterano (1726) and in S. Pietro in Vaticano (1726); the restoration of the high altar in San Simeone Profeta (1724); the enlargement of the convent annexed to Santa Maria in Campitelli (1724) and many others. Outside Rome, Raguzzini was responsible for the building of the Casino Lercari in Albano. When Benedict his patron died in 1730, Raguzzini's fortunes took a turn for the worse, when the coterie of Beneventans brought to Rome by the pope were purged. According to the testimony of Pier Leone Ghezzi, Raguzzini was arrested in the piazza di Trevi on 4 September 1731 and held under house arrest as part of this purge. Although subsequently stripped of many of his official positions, Raguzzini regained many of them through legal action. He was named a virtuoso of the Congregazione al Pantheon in September 1749, which appears to indicate a measure of official rehabilitation. His output from the mid-1730s onward is very small, although his name is frequently encountered in official processes of the Tribunale delle strade. He died in Rome.

Brand names for formulations of this herbicide include Dianat, Banvel, Diablo, Oracle and Vanquish. This chemical compound is a chlorinated derivative of o-anisic acid. Around 2016, dicamba's use came under significant scrutiny due to its tendency to spread from treated fields into neighboring fields, causing damage.Revealed: Monsanto predicted crop system would damage US farms The Guardian, 2020  Use as an herbicide  Dicamba kills annual and perennial broadleaf weeds. Its primary commercial applications are weed control for grain crops and turf areas. It is also used to control brush and bracken in pastures, as well as controlling legumes and cacti. In combination with a phenoxy herbicide or with other herbicides, dicamba can be used for weed control in range land and other noncrop areas (fence rows, roadways, and wastage). Dicamba is toxic to conifer species but is in general less toxic to grasses.Arnold P. Appleby, Franz Müller. \\"Weed Control, 2\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2011, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. Dicamba functions by increasing plant growth rate. At sufficient concentrations, the plant outgrows its nutrient supplies and dies.http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/nr/fid/pubsweb/dicamba_99.pdf Retrieved 20 May 2010 The growth regulating properties of dicamba were first discovered by Zimmerman and Hitchcock in 1942. Soon after, Jealott's Hill Experimental Station in England was evaluating dicamba in the field. Dicamba has since been used for household and commercial weed control. Increasing use of dicamba has been reported with the release of dicamba-resistant genetically modified plants by Monsanto. In October 2016, the EPA launched a criminal investigation into the illegal application of older, drift prone formulations of dicamba onto these new plants. Older formulations have been reported to drift after application and affect other crops not meant to be treated. A less volatile formulation of dicamba made by Monsanto, designed to be less prone to vaporizing and inhibit unintended drift between fields, was approved for use in the United States by the EPA in 2016, and was expected to be commercially available in 2017.  Resistance  Some farmers and researchers have expressed concern about herbicide resistance after the introduction of resistant crops. In the laboratory, researchers have demonstrated weed resistance to dicamba within three generations of exposure. Similar herbicide resistant weeds arose after the introduction of glyphosate-resistant crops (marketed as 'Roundup Ready').The Rise of Superweeds scientificamerican.com Some weed species, like Amaranthus palmeri, have developed resistance to dicamba. Dicamba resistance in Bassia scoparia was discovered in 1994 and has not been explained by common modes of resistance such as absorption, translocation, or metabolism.  Genetically modified crops  The soil bacterium Pseudomonas maltophilia (strain DI-6) converts dicamba to 3,6-dichlorosalicylic acid (3,6-DCSA), which is adsorbed to soil much more strongly than is dicamba, but lacks herbicidal activity. Little information is available on the toxicity of this breakdown intermediate. The enzymes responsible for this first breakdown step is a three-component system called dicamba O-demethylase. Monsanto recently incorporated one component of the three enzymes into the genome of soybean, cotton, and other broadleaf crop plants, making them resistant to dicamba. Monsanto has marketed their dicamba resistant crops under the brand name Xtend. Farmers have expressed concern about being forced to grow resistant crops as protection against drifting dicamba.  Volatilization  Dicamba came under scrutiny due to its tendency to vaporize from treated fields and spread to neighboring crops. Monsanto began offering crops resistant to dicamba before a reformulated and drift resistant herbicide, which they claimed would be less likely to affect neighboring fields, had gained approval from the Environmental Protection Agency. Incidents in which dicamba affected neighboring fields led to complaints from farmers and fines in some US states. A lower volatility formulation, M1768, was approved by the EPA in November 2016. However, this formulation has not been evaluated by experts outside of Monsanto. Dicamba formulations, including those registered in the late 2010s, can be especially prone to volatility, temperature inversions near ground level, and drift.  Toxicological effects  Dicamba does not present unusual handling hazards.dicamba (Banvel) Herbicide Profile 10/83 Retrieved 20 May 2010 = Mammals = It is moderately toxic by ingestion and slightly toxic by inhalation or dermal exposure (oral in rats: 757 mg/kg body weight, dermal LD50 in rats: >2,000 mg/kg, inhalation LC50 in rats: >200 mg/L). In a three- generation study, dicamba did not affect the reproductive capacity of rats. When rabbits were given doses of 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 10, or 20 (mg/kg)/day of technical dicamba from days 6 through 18 of pregnancy, toxic effects on the mothers, slightly reduced fetal body weights, and increased loss of fetuses occurred at the 10 mg/kg dose. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set the NOAEL for this study at 3 (mg/kg)/day. In dog tests, some enlargement of liver cells has occurred, but a similar effect has not been shown in humans.Pesticide Information Profile – Dicamba, Pesticide Management Education Program, Cornell University. = Aquatic animals = Dicamba was tested for acute toxicity in a variety of aquatic animals. The studies accepted by the U.S. EPA found dicamba acid and DMA salt to be practically nontoxic to aquatic invertebrates. Studies accepted by the U.S. EPA found dicamba acid to be slightly toxic to cold water fish (rainbow trout), and practically nontoxic to warm water fish. Recent studies suggest that dicamba should be considered to be a potential endocrine disruptor for fish at environmentally relevant concentrations.  Environmental fate  = Soil = Dicamba is released directly to the environment by its application as an herbicide for the control of annual broadleaf weeds. It may cause damage to plants as a result of its absorption from the soil by plant roots. Dicamba is mobile in most soils and significant leaching is possible. The adsorption of dicamba to organo-clay soil is influenced by soil pH with the greatest adsorption to soil occurring in acidic soils. Dicamba is moderately persistent in soil. Its reported half- life in soil ranges from 1 to 6 weeks. Dicamba is likely to be more rapidly degraded in soils with high microbial populations, but dissipates more slowly in hardwood forests and wetlands than would be expected from the results of laboratory studies. At a level of 10 mg/kg in sandy loam soil, dicamba caused a transient decrease in nitrification after two but not three weeks of incubation. The investigator determined that the decrease in nitrification is not substantial and does not suggest the potential for a prolonged impact on microbial activity. In the same study, dicamba did not affect ammonia formation or sulfur oxidation. In a more recent laboratory study, dicamba, at a concentration of 1 mg/kg soil, did not affect urea hydrolysis or nitrification in four soil types. = Water = Dicamba salts used in some herbicides are highly soluble in water. A recent study conducted from 1991 to 1996 by the U.S. Geologic Survey found dicamba in 0.13% of the ground waters surveyed. The maximum level detected was 0.0021 mg/L.Kolpin, D. W., J. E. Barbash, and R. J. Gilliom. 2000. Pesticides in Ground Water of the United States, 1992–1996. Groundwater 38:858–863. The prevalence of dicamba in groundwater from agricultural areas (0.11%) did not correlate with nonagricultural urban areas (0.35%).  Legality  Arkansas and Missouri banned the sale and use of dicamba in July 2017 in response to complaints of crop damage due to drift. Monsanto responded by arguing that not all instances of crop damage had been investigated and a ban was premature. Monsanto sued the state of Arkansas to stop the ban, but the case was dismissed in February 2018. It has also been acknowledged that the use of dicamba had increased since 2017. Complaints against dicamba accelerated after the EPA approved a Monsanto-created soybean which could tolerate it in 2016. The soybean was a part of Monsanto's Xtend products. In June 2020, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blocked sales of three dicamba-based herbicides in the United States, finding that the Environmental Protection Agency understated risks of spraying. On June 8 2020, the EPA clarified that existing stocks of the dicamba-based pesticides bought before June 3, 2020 may be used according to their previous labels until July 31, 2020. Lawsuits In February 2018, it was reported that numerous farmers from 21 states had filed lawsuits against Monsanto alleging that dicamba damaged their crops, with the most prominent cases coming from Missouri and Arkansas. By August 2019, more lawsuits were filed, alleging that dicamba had damaged crops, gardens, and trees to neighbors of the farmers who used it. On 27 January 2020, the first trial concerning dicamba-related products began in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. The lawsuit involves a peach farmer who alleged that dicamba-based herbicides caused significant damage to his crops and trees. It had also been filed in November 2016, when dicamba was still owned by Monsanto. On 14 February 2020, the jury involved in the lawsuit ruled against dicamba owner Bayer and its co- defendant BASF and found in favor of the peach grower, Bader Farms owner Bill Bader. Bayer and BASF were also ordered to pay Bader $15 million in damages.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-14/bayer-ordered-to- pay-15-million-over-dicamba-crop-damage On 15 February 2020, Monsanto and BASF were ordered to pay an additional $250 million in punitive damages. On February 17, it was announced that dicamba would face many more lawsuits.https://fortune.com/2020/02/17/bayer-basf-dicamba-lawsuit-monsanto/ On February 26, the Peiffer Wolf Carr & Kane Law Firm announced that after the Bader verdict, more 2,000 U.S. farmers hired the law firm to represent them in upcoming lawsuits. In June 2020, Bayer agreed to a settlement of up to $400 million for all 2015-2020 crop year dicamba claims, not including the $250 million judgement.Bayer To Pay More Than $10 Billion To Resolve Cancer Lawsuits Over Weedkiller Roundup  References  = Notes = = Citations =  External links  * Appendix E: Herbicide Information, US Department of Agriculture * Chemical Fact Sheet, Speclab.com * Dicamba Technical Fact Sheet – National Pesticide Information Center * Dicamba General Fact Sheet – National Pesticide Information Center * Dicamba Pesticide Information Profile – Extension Toxicology Network * Monsanto's Xtend Crop System Product Page * EPA Dicamba Reregistration Eligibility Decision Category:Auxinic herbicides Category:Benzoic acids Category:Chloroarenes Category:Salicylyl ethers ","title":"Dicamba"},{"id":"9521235","text":"Edna Louise Hibbard (May 12, 1894 – December 26, 1942) was a stage and motion picture actress from Detroit, Michigan.

Hibbard trained with the Poli Stock Company in Hartford, Connecticut, and Washington, D.C. Soon she performed in Officer 666, Ready Money, and Stop Thief. She spent a year in vaudeville with Lynne Overman in a rendition of The Highest Bidder. Hibbard first came to theatrical prominence as the ingenue lead in Rock-a-Bye Baby in 1918. The play was staged at the Rialto Theater in New York City with the ingenue role being the primary part in the cast. She graduated from drama school in New York before being sent to train under the Selwyns. The New York Times described Hibbard as a combination of Madge Kennedy and Marguerite Clark in appearance. One of her best-received roles was chorus girl Dot Miller in Ladies of the Evening, performed at the Lyceum Theater in 1924.

Elected from the North Wales Regional list, he was Shadow Minister for Rural Affairs from 2007 to 2011. Williams, who was a farmer from North Wales, was a colourful political figure who was respected for his straight talking and campaigning on rural issues; although privately he admitted he never saw himself as a politician. Williams rise to prominence began in 1997–98 when he joined protesters blockading the Port of Holyhead on Anglesey over the importation of Irish beef. He later became a leader in the UK fuel protests in 2000. Political career Williams was first elected to the Welsh Assembly on 1 May 2003 and was re-elected in 2007; serving until his death in 2011. He was Shadow Minister for Rural Affairs from 14 July 2007 and sat on the Sustainability, Rural Development, and Standards committees. Williams had also been the Conservative spokesman for Environment, Planning and Countryside and Local Government in the Second Assembly (2003–07), during which time he was Chair of the North Wales Regional Committee. During his time in the assembly he carved out a role as a champion of farming and rural affairs. Following the news of his death, First Minister and Welsh Labour leader, Carwyn Jones described Williams as a \\"colourful\\" but \\"tough battler\\". Welsh Conservative leader Nick Bourne said he was \\"immensely popular\\" across all parties and UK Prime Minister David Cameron called him a \\"straight talker and a great loss to the assembly and to Wales\\". Personal life Williams, who was born and raised in Cilcain, Flintshire, began work in the agricultural industry aged 15. As well as being a sheep and cattle farmer, he was also a renowned expert and international judge of Welsh cobs (ponies). For more than 20 years, Williams was a member of the Livestock Committee of the Royal Welsh Agricultural Society that organises the Royal Welsh Show In 2010, he realised a lifetime ambition when he was given the honour of judging the supreme champion at the RWS. In total he missed only six Royal Welsh shows in 45 years. Williams was also Chairman of Flintshire County Farmers Union of Wales for eight years, a lifetime member of the Welsh Pony and Cob Society and President of the Denbighshire and Flintshire Agricultural Society. He was married and had a son and daughter. Illness and death Williams was diagnosed with colon cancer in the summer of 2010. He died in April 2011 after an eight-month battle with the disease. In May 2012, an inquest into Williams' death heard that misdiagnosis of the cancer resulted in a five-month delay in its treatment. Williams was initially told by the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board that he had ulcerative colitis in April 2010, five months before the colon cancer was correctly identified. The coroner concluded that the delay may have allowed him to \\"live longer but not necessarily have been cured\\". The case is now subject to a legal action by the Williams family. Legacy Since 2011 the Brynle Williams Memorial Award has been presented at the Royal Welsh Show by the Welsh Government's Department for Agriculture. It recognises the achievements of young farmers who received support from the Welsh Government's Young Farmers Entrant Support Scheme. The award was established in honour of Williams' contribution to Welsh agriculture as both an AM and an active farmer.

T. Finn (1929 – 5 December 2007) was an English actress, known primarily for her role in the 1950s TV serial Quatermass and the Pit, and, after that, her voice work for the 1960s Thunderbirds television series. She also performed in film, radio and theatre in a career that started in the 1940s and lasted until the mid-1970s. Life and work Finn was born and brought up in India. She moved to Britain in July 1946 aboard the Cunard ship 'Scythia' from Bombay, just before the end of British rule, and found a clerical job with the BBC. Noticed for a performance with the BBC Staff Amateur Company, she was then sent to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA). Her first professional work was a part in Edmond T. Gréville's film The Romantic Age (1949), followed by a juvenile lead in a tour of the play Random Harvest. After joining the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, she remained in the company of actors for two years, departing with the role Lady Grey in Henry VI Part III at the Old Vic. A television role followed, as Mrs Crichton in Larger Than Life. At the Arts Theatre in London, she played Sybil Merton in the play Lord Arthur Saville's Crime. She returned to Birmingham to play David in The Boy David; then, back in London, as Ophelia in Hamlet and Olivia in Twelfth Night at the Central School of Speech and Drama's Embassy Theatre. A small part in the film The Large Rope (1953) and a tour of the play Angels in Love followed, after which Finn joined the Bristol Old Vic. Her theatre work led to a role in the BBC Sunday Night Theatre production of A Midsummer Night's Dream in November 1958, in which she played Hermia. Soon afterwards, the director, Rudolph Cartier, cast her in the leading female role, Barbara Judd, in the science-fiction horror serial Quatermass and the Pit (1958–59). Finn's career as a film actress, other than providing voices for two films based on Thunderbirds, did not develop further. During Hammer Films' preparations for a film version of Quatermass and the Pit, Barbara Shelley was cast as Judd, although Nigel Kneale, the writer of the Quatermass series, preferred Finn's performance. In a book about his work, written by Andy Murray, Kneale recalled: \\"I'd liked Christine very much ... but she wasn't the kind of screen star that Hammer wanted. So we got Barbara Shelley, who was taller\\". Finn also performed as a voice actress, supplying the voices of Tin-Tin, Grandma Tracy and other characters in Thunderbirds (1965–66). She also starred in a number of radio plays from the end of the 1950s to the mid-1970s. During the final years of her career, she performed with voice actor Peter Tuddenham.

It also was available around Cambridge on DAB digital radio. It was part of the Classic Gold Digital Network which was owned by GCap and was the sister station of 102.7 Hereward FM. Its studios were based in the Queensgate Centre, Peterborough. History The station was launched on 10 July 1980, as Hereward Radio, broadcasting on 102.7 FM and 1332 AM. On 14 April 1992 the station split its AM and FM frequencies, with 102.7 Hereward FM broadcasting on 102.7 FM and The Worlds Greatest Music Station or WGMS launching on 1332 AM. WGMS was short-lived, as around 1994, it was bought by the GWR Group and re-branded as Classic Gold 1332. Due to going over the limits of the amount of stations a group can own, the GWR Group had to sell all of their \\"Classic Gold\\" stations. They were purchased by the UBC Media Group, although GWR did keep a 20% stake in the brand of stations. Format Classic Gold 1332 played the best songs from the 1960s through to the present day, with a larger focus on the 1960s to the 1980s. It was networked for 20 hours a day during the week, with the single local show presented by Pete Revell. Network shows had local elements broadcast at selected intervals. According to the RAJAR results for the period ending December 2006 the station had 36,000 listeners and a 2.9% market share in its area. On 3 August 2007, all Classic Gold stations were rebranded as simply Gold.

The nearest large settlement is the village of Hartington. History It was originally opened in 1833 for goods by the Cromford and High Peak Railway (which ran from Whaley Bridge to Cromford). It opened for passengers in 1856 but closed in 1877. The line was acquired by LNWR and extended to Buxton in 1894 and the station was reopened. In 1899 the LNWR built a junction just south of the station for a line to Ashbourne and built a new station. Parsley Hay station, showing the Tissington Trail winding southwards In common with the other stations on this line, the platforms and buildings were of timber construction. From this point on to Ashbourne the line was single with passing loops at the stations, though provision was made for doubling which never occurred.Bentley, J.M., Fox, G.K., (1997) Railways of the High Peak: Buxton to Ashbourne (Scenes From The Past series 32), Romiley: Foxline Publishing In contrast to the first part of the line from Buxton, from the previous station at Hurdlow the line had dropped gently and this continued to the next at Hartington, though the curves involved limited the linespeed to . The meeting of the Tissington & High Peak Trails at Parsley Hay. Regular passenger services ceased in 1954 but excursions and special trains continued until October, 1963 while the line southwards closed in October, 1967 with that to Hindlow following in November. Today these two disused trackbeds form the route of two walking and cycling routes. The High Peak Trail follows the old Cromford and High Peak, and the name Parsley Hay has become synonymous with the cycle centre here. The cycle- hire centre at Parsley Hay on a busy August weekend. The track bed from Ashbourne to Parsley Hay was acquired by Derbyshire County Council and the Peak National Park to become the Tissington Trail which was one of the first of such ventures in the country. Later, Ashbourne Tunnel was acquired by Sustrans. Parsley Hay, being located a little to the north of the junction of these walk/cycleways, is ideally located for a cycle hire centre (run by the Park Authority) and a refreshment kiosk serving drinks and snacks all day. There are also toilets here, and a large car park. The trackbed at this point is also part of the Pennine Bridleway, a leisure route which includes through Derbyshire.

It is the largest diving facility in the state of Florida. The spring Vortex Spring is a cold, freshwater spring that produces approximately of water daily. The spring consists of a basin with sloping sides and a cave which links the spring to the Floridan aquifer. Water temperature is steady at with no thermocline, and is typically very clear. The spring runoff flows into nearby Otter Creek, which joins Sandy Creek a short distance upstream of Ponce de Leon Spring. There are many fish in the spring; large carp swim in the basin while freshwater eels live in the cave. The cave has been measured to a total of . Diving Vortex Spring is a popular diving area both for experienced and novice divers. Dive training is offered at the park. There are two underwater training platforms at which are often used for Open Water certification dives, and a \\"talk box\\" that divers swim into, allowing them to talk to each other while under the surface. The cavern entrance is at below the surface, and has an opening of . A handrail is mounted along the wall of the cave. The cave is accessible to , further passage is blocked by a steel grate. Experienced divers are allowed to dive to . The site At the site, many facilities are provided for visitors. Lodging, dive shop, and changing rooms with heated showers are on site. Recreational features include diving boards, rope swings, and slides into the swimming area. Camping facilities, picnic areas, a basketball court, volleyball court, paddle boats, floats, and canoes are also provided. History The cave has been a controversial aspect of the spring. During the early 1990s, 13 divers died while exploring it. The state of Florida threatened to ban diving near cave entrances as a result of frequent cave diving accidents, but local divers responded by developing a special cave diving certification that became the standard requirement for sections of underwater caves known to be particularly hazardous. Vortex Spring complied with this by erecting a locked underwater gate at the entrance to the dangerous section of the cave. Only those who have valid cave diving certificates are permitted to enter, requiring a staff member to unlock the gate, and typically accompany them during the dive. alt=A white warning sign with a picture of the [Grim Reaper] and the headline \\"Prevent your death. Go no farther\\" over black text explaining the dangers to divers of proceeding into the cave without proper equipment and certification In 2010, Ben McDaniel, a diver who was not certified for cave diving, but had been witnessed by staff and other divers gaining access to the restricted area of the cave by forcing open the gate, did not resurface after an employee let him through the gate one evening. It was initially assumed that he had died accidentally after becoming trapped underwater, but extensive searches did not find his body, nor any sign that one was present in the remote recesses of the cave. The only significant evidence that was found were two decompression tanks filled with plain air (rather than the standard mixtures of gases normally used for diving in such conditions). The discovery of the tanks raised suspicions further because, in addition to being filled with the wrong type of gas, they were found just outside the entrance to the cave, though experienced divers know to place tanks close by to the areas they'll be exploring further down, thus keeping them within easy reach in case of emergency. This was seen as odd, considering that McDaniel was last seen deep inside the cave, attempting to bypass the gate to the restricted section by a diving staff member exiting the cave, who then unlocked it for him despite his lack of certification or diving partner. The staff diver then left, witnessing McDaniel entering the restricted zone. It has been speculated that he may have been murdered (especially after the similarly suspicious death of Vortex Spring owner Lowell Kelly late the following year), and that his body was disposed of elsewhere. Another theory is that McDaniel staged his own disappearance to start a new life free from the many personal and financial problems he had been having at the time. Yet another possibility is that McDaniel did simply die by accident, and that his body still lies somewhere in the deepest parts of the cave, which are extremely difficult to access. In 2012, another diver died in the cave, believed by those who recovered him to have been searching for McDaniel's body, motivated by a large reward offered by McDaniel's parents, which they rescinded after news of the event.

T. Grein; 11 October 1862 – 22 June 1935) was a British impresario and drama critic of Dutch origin who helped establish the modern theatre in London.Wearing, J. P. \\"Grein, Jacob Thomas (1862–1935)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2008, accessed 12 March 2013 Biography Born and raised in Amsterdam, Grein moved to London in 1885 and was naturalised as a British subject in 1895. His greatest achievement was founding the Independent Theatre Society in 1891. Their first production was Henrik Ibsen's Ghosts in 1891. Their performances were held as \\"private\\" subscription performances, which allowed them to present plays that were not officially licensed by the Lord Chamberlain's Office. In 1892 the Society produced George Bernard Shaw's first play, Widowers' Houses. Grein married the actress Alice Augusta Greeven in 1904; she later wrote and edited a biography of him under the pseudonym Michael Orme. She also wrote a number of plays as Michael Orme and as Alix Greeven. The Greins worked continually to introduce European drama to London. They founded the German Theatre in London Programme in 1900, hosting German actors and directors such as Max Behrend and Hans Andresen in productions of German drama (performed in German). This programme lasted, in various forms, until 1908.\\"Mr. J. T. Grein\\", The Times, 24 June 1935, p. 9 The influences were not all one way: in April 1907, Grein organised a visit by Herbert Beerbohm Tree's company – based at His Majesty's Theatre – to Hanover and Berlin. The visit was made at the personal invitation of the German Emperor; the imperial railway train transported them from the Hook of Holland. Grein and Tree were awarded the Order of the Red Eagle for their successful tour.Dekker, Nicholas The Modern Catalyst:German Influences on the British Stage pp.23–4 (Ohio State University, 2007) Grein died of a heart attack at his London home at the age of 72.

Career Born in Barnsley, England she first became involved in the hardbag and UK techno scene since 1990. Mrs Wood first came to prominence via her output on the React record label. Her first single \\"Whodunnit?\\" was issued in 1994, shortly followed by one of her best known releases, \\"Calamity Jane\\". In Autumn 1995 Mrs Wood enjoyed crossover success with \\"Joanna\\", largely considered one of the defining tracks of the hardbag era. Featuring a tradestyle remix from Tony De Vit as well as her own more minimal version, \\"Joanna\\" became one of the first hardbag releases to reach the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart, and was at this juncture one of the biggest selling tracks to have been output on React. Further success ensued with \\"Heartbreak\\", which featured vocals from Cleveland City signing Eve Gallagher, another artist who became synonymous with the house music and hardbag scene of the mid 1990s. \\"Heartbreak\\" charted at #44 in the UK, and featured remixes from former Happy Clappers producer C J Scott, as well as a technoid variation from Wood herself, co-produced by longtime cohort, Kevin White. The following year witnessed the release of \\"Feel So Good\\", Mrs Wood's highest placed chart hit, a double A-side coupled with a Sash! remix of \\"Joanna\\". Also included in the mix package were further variations from Dancing Divaz, Nush and the original 1995 remix by Tony De Vit. \\"Road Rage\\" was issued in a limited quantity in late 1996, which Wood released under the sobriquet, Madame Dubois. Shortly after the success of \\"Feel So Good\\", Mrs Wood began producing less commercially orientated, techno and nu-nrg influenced tracks such as \\"1,2,3,4\\", which was less well received, despite featuring a trancey remake from Vincent De Moor. Her debut album followed - Woodwork. Co-produced by Kevin White, Woodwork consisted largely of minimal, techno based compositions. Mrs Wood is perhaps best remembered for her React released mix compilation albums, Mrs Wood Teaches Techno and 1996's Bitter & Twisted (half of which was remixed by her longtime stablemate Blu Peter).

Pickard was tried in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas in 1978. This case was filed against the Raymondville Independent School District (RISD) in Texas by Roy Castañeda, the father of two Mexican-American children. Castañeda claimed that the RISD was discriminating against his children because of their ethnicity. He argued that the classroom his children were being taught in was segregated, using a grouping system for classrooms based on criteria that were both ethnically and racially discriminating. Castañeda also claimed the Raymondville Independent School District failed to establish sufficient bilingual education programs, which would have aided his children in overcoming the language barriers that prevented them from participating equally in the classroom. According to Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563 (1974), a case decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, school districts in this country are required to take the necessary actions in order to provide students who do not speak English as their first language the ability to overcome the educational barriers associated with not being able to properly comprehend what is being taught to them. Castañeda argued that there was no way to sufficiently measure the Raymondville Independent School District's approach to overcoming this barrier. The Castañeda v. Pickard case was tried, and on August 17, 1978, the court system ultimately ruled in favor of the Raymondville Independent School District, stating they had not violated any of the Castañeda children's constitutional or statutory rights. As a result of the District Court ruling, Castañeda filed for an appeal, arguing that the District Court made a mistake in its ruling. In 1981 the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled in favor of the Castañedas, and as a result, the court decision established a three-part assessment for determining how bilingual education programs would be held responsible for meeting the requirements of the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974. The criteria are listed below: *The bilingual education program must be “based on sound educational theory.” *The program must be “implemented effectively with resources for personnel, instructional materials, and space.” *After a trial period, the program must be proven effective in overcoming language barriers/handicaps.

Early life and career Born on April 20, 1923, in Abingdon, Virginia, Widener received a Bachelor of Science degree from the United States Naval Academy in 1944 and then served in the United States Navy until 1949. In 1953 he received a Bachelor of Laws from Washington and Lee University School of Law. He was a Lieutenant in the United States Naval Reserve from 1951 to 1952, and was in private practice in Bristol, Virginia from 1953 to 1969. He was a Commissioner for the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia from 1963 to 1966, and was a member of the Virginia Election Laws Study Commission from 1968 to 1969. Federal judicial service Widener was nominated by President Richard Nixon on June 19, 1969, to the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia, to a new seat authorized by 71 Stat. 586. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on July 11, 1969, and received his commission on July 14, 1969. He served as Chief Judge from 1971 to 1972. His service terminated on October 27, 1972, due to his elevation to the Fourth Circuit. Widener was nominated by President Nixon on September 25, 1972, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit vacated by Judge Albert Vickers Bryan. He was confirmed by the Senate on October 12, 1972, and received commission on October 17, 1972. He assumed senior status on July 17, 2007. He was the last federal appeals court judge in active service to have been appointed by President Nixon. His service terminated on September 19, 2007, due to his death. Succession controversy Widener announced his intent to take senior status upon confirmation of his successor in 2001. William J. Haynes II had been nominated to succeed Widener but was never given a vote in the Senate. In January 2007, Haynes withdrew his candidacy for nomination to replace Widener on the Fourth Circuit. He had long been opposed by Democrats and a few Republicans, and with the Democrats having regained control of the Senate, his chances for confirmation appeared to have completely vanished. On July 17, 2007, Widener took senior status unconditionally. Death Widener died at his home outside Abingdon on September 19, 2007, after a year-long battle with lung cancer.

The preceding four books in order are: Hawksong, Snakecharm, Falcondance, and Wolfcry. It is told from the point of view of Hai the gyrfalcon, cobra mix, who is struggling to find a way out of Ecl, or the darkness. It was released on September 11, 2007. Plot Wyvernhail is the story of Hai - the mongrel daughter of the Falcon Darien and Zane's older brother, Anjay - putting her in line for the Cobriana throne (though crippled and powerless). Hai is a creature out of place - not Avian, but a falcon poisoned with cobra blood . When Hai's cousin, Oliza Shardae Cobriana, abdicates the throne of Wyvern's Court, Hai has visions only of destruction: the serpiente king Salem, dying in her arms; the dutiful falcon guard, Nicias, unable to save a generation of children; and Wyvern's Court engulfed in flames. The cause of this future is Keyi, the daughter of Oliza and Vere, who, after accidentally killing her mother, seems to enjoy chaos and death and brings it upon Wyvern's Court. Now Hai will do anything to protect her new home - even if it means betraying the very people who need her most. In order to protect the people and the world she loves from the future she sees in increasingly horrific visions, Hai is forced to throw away her own happiness and ascend the serpiente throne. Using all the power she had at her disposal, she split her soul and pushed into him her serpiente magic. Nicias kept hold of her to keep her from diving too deep into Ecl, and they were unconscious for a few days. Rosalind, who did not trust Hai, was not sure what to do about her, and apologizes and admits she had been confused for a long time. Darien, Hai's falcon mother, comes to Wyvern's Court and says that the Empress Cjarsa felt a new falcon being born. When Hai reaches for her cobra scales, she could not have it ripple across her skin, and when she tried to return to her broken falcon form, she let out a painful scream and Nicias held onto her. However, when she reached for the falcon magic of Ahnmik, she felt her magic rub upon Nicias's magic, and found that she was now truly falcon. Nicias and Oliza (grudgingly) fixed Hai's wings after they found out she was pure falcon. She and Nicias are together. Then she agrees to dance with Vere Obsidian. Narraration Wyvernhail is narrated by Hai, mongrel falcon-cobra daughter of Darien and Anjay Cobriana.

Iron eagle on a gatepost at the former Eagle Ironworks. The Eagle Ironworks was an ironworks owned by W. Lucy & Co. on the Oxford Canal in Jericho, Oxford, England. William Carter founded the works in 1812 with a shop in the High Street and moved it to its site beside the canal in 1825. It was on Walton Well Road at the northern end of Walton Street and backed onto St Sepulchre's Cemetery. The works ceased production in 2005, was demolished in 2007 and has since been redeveloped, mainly with apartments. History A utility plate in Beaumont Street bearing the name Lucy & Co. William Carter had an ironmongery shop in High Street, Oxford by 1812, when he founded an iron foundry in Summertown which was then a rural location north of Oxford. He moved the foundry to the banks of the Oxford Canal in 1825, one of the first developments in what is now the district of Jericho in central Oxford. The company specialised in iron castings including lamp-posts, manhole covers, ornamental ironwork and agricultural machinery. William Grafton became a partner and in 1830 Carter moved to the Eagle Foundry in Leamington Hastings, Warwickshire. Grafton continued to manage the foundry in Oxford, which became called the Eagle Ironworks. In 1854 the company bought the freehold for the site from St John's College, which owned much of north Oxford. When Grafton died in 1861, William Lucy, his partner, took over the running of the foundry. When he in turn died in 1873, the name of the ironworks became \\"Lucy's\\". The growth of North Oxford and the University of Oxford colleges in the Victorian era expanded Lucy's market. The company responded by adding a new smith shop and foundry to the Eagle Ironworks, designed by local architect William Wilkinson and completed in 1879. Lucy's became a limited company in 1897. It expanded both its product range and its market, including shelving and storage equipment that it sold throughout the country. In the decade after becoming a limited company, Lucy's accordingly increased and diversified the Eagle Ironworks buildings, including a north-lit factory extension designed by George Gardiner and completed in 1901. Production changed to electrical engineering and stainless steel, including arc lamps, electric lamp fittings, steam roller castings and, appropriately for Oxford, library stacking. In both World War I and World War II Lucy's made munitions. Between the wars it concentrated on electrical engineering and making switchgear. After World War II it also made machine tools. Closure and redevelopment The Oxford Canal from Walton Well Road in 2010. The modern apartments by the canal to the right have replaced the former Lucy's Ironworks. In the 1960s the company built two large blocks on its wharves by the canal. In 2005 the company's new US owners moved manufacturing overseas from the United Kingdom and in 2007 it demolished the Eagle Ironworks and redeveloped the site with apartment blocks, which it lets out directly to tenants, trading as Lucy Properties.http://www.lucyproperties.co.uk/ This has been controversial for town planning reasons. In 2006, the site's archaeology was evaluated prior to redevelopment. During the archaeological excavations a 17th-century pit and a possible 19th-century well were found. A new residential road, William Lucy Way, was developed at this time, on the other side of the Canal from the original Lucy's site. Literature Early in the 20th century the poet and short story writer A. E. Coppard (1878–1957) worked at the Eagle Ironworks, as recounted in his autobiography It's Me, O Lord! Oxford-based author Philip Pullman featured the Eagle Ironworks in his 2003 novel Lyra's Oxford. The story includes a fictitious \\"Randolph Lucy\\", a 17th-century alchemist with an eagle-demon who had his laboratory on nearby Juxon Street. An entry for the Eagle Ironworks is included in an extract from a fictitious version of the Baedeker guide. See also * Littleworth Mill, Wheatley, supplied by the Eagle Ironworks in 1784. * W.

The game is an erotic dungeon crawler in which a young warrior Takeru fights to lift a witch's curse that has turned girls into monsters. Following the commercial and critical success of Dragon Knight II, ELF followed up with Dragon Knight III / Knights of Xentar in 1991. A censored remake of Dragon Knight II was published by NEC Avenue in 1992. Gameplay PC-98 Dragon Knight II is available only in Japanese. Its gameplay system has not changed much since the first Dragon Knight game, as it is still a standard dungeon crawler with first-person view perspective and 2D graphics. The player spends most of the time navigating dungeon-like mazes and fighting enemies. As progress is made, the mazes will become more complicated, but as in the first game there is an aid for the player in the form of a mini-map with grid coordinates. The player can also visit shops and converse with non- hostile NPCs. The game starts with just one player character, Takeru, but two other characters join up later on. The game's battle system has also undergone minor changes. It still features turn-based battles that are mostly randomly generated, but the fights are better balanced than in the first game. The player can attack, defend, and use spells and items to deal with various types of female enemies (berserker, banshee, catgirl, centaur, elf, harpy, ninja, mummy, werewolf, and so on), who are being fought only one at a time. These enemies are actually girls who have been transformed into monsters, and whenever the player character fights off one of them, the subdued enemy loses her clothing. Later, when the enemies revert to their normal self, in their gratitude they offer themselves to have sex with the protagonist in a cutscene (censored in the console versions). There is also only one boss to beat at the end. Plot =Characters= *Takeru Yamato (ヤマト・タケル), the protagonist of most media in the Dragon Knight franchise, is womanizing young swordsman who arrives in Phoenix following his victory over the evil Dragon Knights and after Baan made him deliver mysterious scriptures there.

The game was narrated by Kaneto Shiozawa. =Story= The vagabond youth hero of the first Dragon Knight, Takeru Yamato, wanders into a small town of Phoenix and finds it terrorized and devoid of young men. Phoenix had been once ruled by a group of powerful wicked witches until they were destroyed by the all-male Dragon Knights. Three years before the events of the game, a woman known as Mesaanya had arrived in Phoenix. At first she has appeared very friendly and gained the villagers' trust as a healer, but then she revealed her true colors as she took over the Witch Tower and forbade the love between men and women. Next morning after Takeru's arrival, he sees the town changed, as Mesaanya steals the set of seven evil-sealing holy scriptures that Takeru delivered before it can be used against her, possesses a young maiden named Kate, and also kidnaps 28 other village girls and turns them into minions to guard the Witch Tower. Reluctantly, Takeru decides to enter the tower and collect the scriptures to break the curse. The ultimate goal of Takeru is to defeat the witch, who is supposed to wait at the top of the tower, but he also needs to rescue the girls one by one. During the course of the game, Takeru is joined by a burly merchant named Baan, who has originally sent him to Phoenix, and a mysterious spell-casting priestess named Sophia. He also meets and rescues Kate's fiancé, a young man from a neighboring town who went first to rescue Kate without any combat experience and disappeared. Eventually, all the bewitched girls are saved and it is time to find Mesaanya, since the witch's throne room is empty and Kate herself is also not found. Looking for them, Takeru learns that the witches have been conquered with the help of the special-metal Falcon Sword and the Genji Armor capable of resisting magic. Searching of these artifacts, the party descends into a hidden dungeon in the town graveyard where Baan reveals it was his ancestor who has once fought the witches and killed their queen, Mesaanya's ancestor. In a twist ending, Sophia's true identity is revealed having been really a disguised Mesaanya all along. Her magic blast gravely wounds Baan and then she is shocked when Takeru, who is revealed to be a son of god and the legendary armor set that only a god could use wraps itself around him. After the decisive duel Mesaanya is slain, Kate is finally freed from her spell, and peace is restored to the village. With his quest completed, Takeru then spends a night with Kate, who is about to marry, before leaving for his further adventures.Dragon Knight III user manual. ELF Corporation. 1992.. Release The game was originally released in 1990-1991 for the MSX2, NEC PC-8801, NEC PC-9801 and X68000 computer systems. An enhanced PC Engine port that removed sexually explicit content but added voice acting and new graphics was developed by TamTam and released by NEC Avenue in 1992 among controversies as the first erotic game officially published for a video game console. Two soundtracks were released in Japan by NEC Avenue: Dragon Knight II Fantastic Remix! (ドラゴンナイト II ファンタスティック・リミックス!) in October 1991MSX Magazine 10/91, page 61. MSX Magazine 11/91, page 62. and Dragon Knight II PC Engine World (ドラゴンナイト II ～ＰＣエンジンワールド) in 1992, distributed by Nippon Columbia. Reception Just like its predecessor, Dragon Knight II was a commercial success. The game placed third on MSX Magazines \\"MSX Soft Top 30\\" best-selling chart in May 1991, and even one year later has remained there at 28th place.MSX Magazine 5/92, page 7. The PC Engine version was fifth on PC Engine Fan chart in August 1992.PC Engine Fan 8/92, page 63. The magazine's review gave it a highly positive score of 90%.PC Engine Fan 8/92, page 68. Famitsu gave it a score 24/40. Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) reported that Dragon Knight II \\"became a sleeper hit with Japanese role-playing fans. What made it popular is the fact that it was noticeably different from other RPGs because the game opted for lots of women instead of beasts, with some slight characteristics of monsters,\\" predicting that \\"with more action and more scantily clad women to attack,\\" its sequel \\"should really entice the Japanese market!\\" EGM also included the game's \\"tons of interesting people to meet\\" in their 1993 ranking of \\"Top Ten Hottest Video Game Babes\\" at second place. PC Engine Fan listed Mesaanya, Sophia and Kate among the sexiest female characters in the PC Engine games.Super PC Engine Fan 1 page 69. Sequel Takeru (renamed Desmond in the West) returns as the hero of the 1991 sequel Dragon Knight III. It is titled Knights of Xentar in highly rewritten Western- localized versions. Phoenix, where Takeru is a celebrity and the former Witch Tower which is renamed as the Tower of Takeru in honor, is revisited in the sequel. The fully recovered Baan rejoins him there to fight the demons and Kate is romantically met again. Takeru uses the Falcon Sword and the Genji Armor again, and Baan marries Marie, one of the girls from Dragon Knight II.

The family has been related to a number of developmental features such as jaws and limbs. The family seems to be well preserved across species. As DLX/Dll are involved in limb development in most of the major phyla, including vertebrates, it has been suggested that Dll was involved in appendage growth in an early bilaterial ancestor. Six members of the family are found in human and mice, numbered DLX1 to DLX6. They form two- gene clusters (bigene clusters) with each other. There are DLX1-DLX2, DLX3-DLX4, DLX5-DLX6 clusters in vertebrates, linked to Hox gene clusters HOXD, HOXB, and HOXA respectively. In higher fishes like the zebrafish, there are two additional DLX genes, dlx2b (dlx5) and dlx4a (dlx8). These additional genes are not linked with each other, or any other DLX gene. All six other genes remain in bigene clusters. DLX4, DLX7, DLX8 and DLX9 are the same gene in vertebrates. They are named differently because every time the same gene was found, the researchers thought they had found a new gene.  Function  DLX genes, like distal-less, are involved in limb development in most of the major phyla. DLX genes are involved in craniofacial morphogenesis and the tangential migration of interneurons from the subpallium to the pallium during vertebrate brain development. It has been suggested that DLX promotes the migration of interneurons by repressing a set of proteins that are normally expressed in terminally differentiated neurons and act to promote the outgrowth of dendrites and axons. Mice lacking DLX1 exhibit electrophysiological and histological evidence consistent with delayed-onset epilepsy. DLX2 has been associated with a number of areas including development of the zona limitans intrathalamica and the prethalamus. DLX4 (DLX7) is expressed in bone marrow. DLX5 and DLX6 genes are necessary for normal formation of the mandible in vertebrates.

Its population at the 2011 Census was 419. There was sizeable oil production there in the mid-20th century. Geography The village lies between the A617 and the A616 roads between Ollerton and Southwell. Dukes Wood to the south is situated on the top of an escarpment, giving good views over the Trent valley to the east and towards Southwell to the south. Clouds formed by the Cottam Power Station are often seen on clear days to the north-east. A steep hill descends into the village from the south, on which the road passes a large residential training centre for National Grid plc. Heritage The village pub is the Savile Arms in Bilsthorpe Road. The Robin Hood Way, a long-distance footpath that passes through the village, is altogether 168 km (104 miles) long. Eakring Mill was a five-storey brick tower windmill, built some time after 1840 (). The sails were removed in 1912 and the mill was derelict by 1936. It was converted into a house in about 1995. A windmill was shown on a map of 1832, located in Mill Hill Field, where two footpaths cross, () and another windmill shown north of Eakring Brail Wood (). The parish church is dedicated to St Andrew, the Apostle. The grade II* listed building was constructed in the 13th–15th centuries and restored in the early 1880s, when the seating was replaced. It contains a font bearing the date 1674, and a plaque commemorating the installation of the tower clock in 1887. When Gilbert Michell was rector in the earlier 18th-century, the Tudor parsonage house (now the Old Rectory) was the largest house in the village. It \\"came with a large tithe barn and other outbuildings, a fold for animals, and a neighbouring orchard and two fish ponds described as 'pleasure grounds' for the house.\\"Russell McCormmach: Weighing the World.

World War II oil =Geological survey= pylons at Eakring Academy with National Grid plc in March 2004 In the late 1930s oil exploration was undertaken by the D'Arcy Exploration Co Ltd, part of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Using geological data from colliery workings, geologists calculated that an anticline was situated under Eakring. A nearby borehole at Kelham had produced oil. Drilling to levels between had found significant quantities of oil – which turned out to be particularly significant when the Second World War and the U-Boat campaign started. =Drilling= Wells produced oil at Caunton and Kelham Hills. Their specific gravity of 0.86 qualified them to be high-grade oil. The UK typically had oil reserves of , which were under strength. In March 1943, production began at around 100 wells, coordinated by Philip Southwell, a petroleum engineer from the D'Arcy Exploration Company (now BP), who had liaised with Lloyd Noble, president of Noble Drilling Corporation in Oklahoma. During the war, the oilfield produced over or perhaps of oil from 170 pumps (\\"nodding donkeys\\"). Production continued until 1964 and the wells produced .

Television career  Sheldon was originally slated to train for a career in textiles, but a scholarship at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and some work in the theater sidetracked his plans. He worked in some Broadway shows in small character parts. Eventually, he left the stage for a more stable career as a radio broadcaster. Sheldon made his radio debut on WINS Radio as the host and interviewer and as a performer of a daily talk/variety show in 1941. The show became a hit with NYC's listeners and from there he went on to a long and successful career mc'ing several programs, including one with interviewer Maggie McNellis (\\"Sheldon And McNellis At The Latin Quarter\\"). Sheldon made his TV debut on WNBT (now known as WNBC) TV in New York City in 1946, with the first of several children's TV shows \\"Kids Today\\" on WNBT. From 1946 to 1956, he hosted such kids shows as \\"Saturdays With Herb Sheldon\\", \\"Sheldon At Six\\", \\"Kids Today\\" and \\"One Is For Sheldon\\" Unfortunately, Sheldon's tenure at WRCA was short-lived: he violated his contract with WNBT by also working for other stations in the city. After contract was terminated he joined WABD TV Channel 5 as the host of their kids TV shows. He succeeded Sandy Becker as the second host of their successful Sunday comedy/variety kids TV show \\"Wonderama\\" in 1956. Sheldon's appearances on \\"Wonderama\\", \\"The Bugs Bunny Theater\\" (during his tenure the title was changed to \\"Bugs Bunny Presents\\"), \\"The Looney Tunes Show\\" and \\"Speaking Of Animals\\"). He also hosted a teens rock and roll dance and music program \\"Studio Party\\" and a late night old movie show \\"Rickey Tickey Playhouse\\". He again had problems with management for working for other stations, and for working as an MC for nightclub acts. Sheldon was ousted by WABD TV's management on August 8, 1958. He briefly served as the host of two TV shows for WNTA TV Channel 13 in Newark, N.J. \\"Hold That Camera\\" (a late night TV game show for adults) and \\"Funderama\\" (a Saturday morning clone of Wonderama) in 1958 and 1959. On Monday September 14, 1959, Herb Sheldon succeeded Paul Tripp as the third host of WOR-TV Channel 9 NYC's \\"Looney Tunes Show\\". Sheldon wore a straw skimmer, bow tie and striped blazer, and set the show against the backdrop of an enchanted cottage in the woods; he would entertain his viewers between the reruns of the cartoons. The show was so popular that the program's title was soon changed to \\"The Herb Sheldon Show\\". He also hosted \\"The Mischief Makers\\" (the syndicated title for the silent \\"Little Rascals\\" films) weekday evenings on WOR from Monday September 19, 1960 to Friday June 9, 1961.  Retirement  Sheldon continued to host the stations TV's kids shows until heart problems forced him to retire from regular TV work on May 18, 1962. During his retirement years, he co-owned a restaurant in Hempstead, N.Y. and also staged, produced and performed in plays at two theaters that he owned, \\"The Tinkerpond Playhouse\\" in Syosset, N.Y. and The Montauk Point Playhouse. Sheldon also worked with many charities, most notably \\"The United Cerebrial Palsy Telethons\\" with Jane Pickens Hoving, Dennis James and Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme\\".

(11 February 2009). Primate Factsheets: Mouse lemur (Microcebus) Taxonomy, Morphology, & Ecology . Accessed 2009 August Microcebus berthae is one of many species of Malagasy lemurs that came about through extensive speciation, caused by unknown environmental mechanisms and conditions. This primate is found chiefly in the Kirindy Forest in western Madagascar. After its discovery in 1992 in the dry deciduous forest of western Madagascar, it was initially thought to represent a rediscovery of M. myoxinus, but comparative morphometric and genetic studies revealed its status as a new species, M. berthae. This lemur is named after the conservationist and primatologist Berthe Rakotosamimanana of Madagascar, who was the Secretary General of the Groupe d'Etudes et de Recherche des Primates (GERP) from its founding until her death in 2005.  Physical description  Microcebus berthae has short, dense dorsal pelage that is bicolored cinnamon and yellow ochre. The middorsal stripe is tawny in color. The midventral area of this species is chamois in color while the flanks are a mixture of pale chamois and light pale neutral gray. The dorsal and ventral underfur is neutral blackish neutral gray in color. The tail has short hair that is tawny. The crown and ears are also tawny in color. The orbits are surrounded by a narrow dark band. The area between the eyes is cinnamon in color. The hands and feet are dull beige.  Distribution and habitat  Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, which is known to live in Kirindy Forest in Madagascar, is also found to inhabit the Reserve Speciale d'Andranomena. It is also suggested that they live in Analabe, given the spotted distribution of the series. Madame Berthe's mouse lemurs use the tangles of tree vines to sleep in. Because of its limited spread, it is thought that they are specialist creatures that will only live in that one specific environment. Another idea suggests that they most likely compete with M. murinus, chiefly for resources. Because of the high rate of deforestation in the surrounding Menabe forests (52%) between 1985 and 2000, less than of inhabitable forests remained between Kirindy Park, the Tsiribihina River, and the Reserve. Given that this lemur occurs at 0.36 lemurs per ha, it is estimated that about 7,920 mouse lemurs were left in the area in the year 2000. With deforestation continuing to occur on the island nation, the species is listed as critically endangered, at best.  Behavior  Microcebus berthae are typically solitary foragers, but are not without social interaction with other members of their species. About half the time, they sleep alone. Otherwise, they can be found sleeping next to one or more lemurs, with no preference or prejudice to close relatives or members of the opposite sex. Be it alone or in a group, Microcebus berthae tend to sleep in leaf nests in trees, or without a nest, in hole-like structures. On occasion, the paths of two members of the species may cross, leading to different kinds of social encounters. Some encounters involve bouts of mutual grooming, sex, or huddling (an activity which can last up to 23 minutes). Other meet-ups between lemurs might include chasing, biting and grabbing. Overall, male-male and female- female interactions do not differ qualitatively. Unlike other species of lemur, Microcebus berthae do not hibernate during the cold-dry season, instead compensating for food scarcity with a larger than average home range. In a population of Microcebus berthae, males significantly outnumber females. Despite there being no sexual dimorphism in skull length, canine height, or tail length, the average female is larger than the average male in head-body length and head width. Average body mass, while relatively equal during mating season, becomes smaller for males in the duration of time excluding mating season. Males have a home range of about , while females have a home range of about . Females tend to remain in a home range that is close to, or includes their place of birth. This is the opposite of males, who tend to disperse from their place of birth. The home ranges of individual lemurs tend to overlap with each other, with female home ranges overlapping with that of one or two other females, and male home ranges overlapping with that of up to nine other males. Social systems of M. berthae are more similar to the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) than the fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus medius), i.e. Madame Berthe's mouse lemur is sexually promiscuous rather than monogamous. The range in distance of males is larger than that of the females in both Microcebus species, both before and after mating seasons. Research has also been conducted on the distribution of sleeping sites, as well as on testes size and the presence of vaginal plugs. Study of capture rates and physiological proof reveals no evidence that M. berthae has a hibernation season, which increases the chances of sexual activity within the species.  Ecology  Mouse lemurs are considered to be a cryptic species complex. The species-rich mouse lemur genus Microcebus is distributed over nearly all remaining forest areas of Madagascar with a high variability in species distribution patterns and are very similar morphologically. They are so similar, that the gray mouse lemur was considered the only mouse lemur until recent studies proved it to be otherwise. Along with other morphological similarities, the Madame Berthe's mouse lemur and the gray mouse lemur share a similar diet (both containing the same food groups but in different proportions) and live in the same region of western Madagascar. Both of these Microcebus species have an omnivorous diet, and used the same food sources, including sugary homopteran secretions, fruit, flowers, gum, arthropods and small vertebrates (e.g. geckos, chameleons). Because of their recent common ancestry, closely related species ought to exhibit high similarities in their use of biotic and abiotic resources, susceptibility to predators and responses to disturbances and stress. However, despite the overlapping niches, studies have shown that the territories of the two mouse lemur species have very little to no overlap. The Madame Berthe's mouse lemur population is sparse and spread out over a more widespread area; while the gray mouse lemurs had a much denser population in a smaller area. The reason for the mouse lemur species' mutual avoidance is not yet clearly known. The gray mouse lemur has several competitive advantages over Madame Berthe's mouse lemur. It is about twice as large as Madame Berthe's mouse lemur. It also has the advantages of being a generalist, and having fewer deaths by predation, with 70% predation mortality for Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, vs. 50% predation mortality for the gray mouse lemur. The areas used exclusively by each species share structural characteristics and food sources. Gray mouse lemurs are able to live in more types of vegetation than Madame Berthe's mouse lemur yet have smaller, denser territories. This suggests that their avoidance does not stem from environmental differences, but rather by competitive coexistence. = Diet = Madame Berthe's mouse lemur shares its niche with the sympatric gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). Both lemurs feeding ecology suggests that there is a coexistence behavior between the two lemur species. Both species are found in western Madagascar's highly seasonal dry deciduous forest. Madame Berthe's mouse lemur has a very narrow feeding niche unlike the sympatric gray mouse lemur which has a much broader niche. The feeding ecology and the types of food available depend on the type of season in the niche of Microcebus berthae and Microcebus murinus. During the wet, rainy season, more unripe fruit is available which decreases its abundance in the dry season. However, ripe fruit are available all year round with maximum abundance in the dry season. As a food source, flying insects are available in both seasons, but are abundant in the wet season. Madame Berthe's mouse lemur is an omnivore and mainly feeds on fruits and flowers of different tree and shrub species, insect secretions, gum, arthropods and small vertebrates like geckos and chameleons. Compared to the dry and the wet season of Madame Berthe's mouse lemur's niche, it spends more time feeding in the dry season while the wet season is used for mating. Compared to the sympatric gray mouse lemur, Madame Berthe's mouse lemur eats mainly insects, and fruit only occasionally. Similar to the sympatric gray mouse lemur, Madame Berthe's mouse lemur is able to adapt to the fluctuation of resources. There is a high overlap in the feeding niche of both lemurs suggesting that they avoid competition by mutually excluding each other on a small scale.

Early career Castro was born in Mayagüez's in La Quinta barrio to Juan Castro Ayala and Victoria Vélez Cuevas, the second and oldest male child of twelve siblings. He developed the skills necessary to become an entertainer: good singing voice, talent as a percussionist, and good timing for comedy. While working full-time as a messenger for the municipality of Mayagüez, Castro held odd jobs in numerous local orchestras, mostly as a singer and percussionist. These orchestras included William Manzano's and Carlos López's (for both, Mon Rivera had also been a singer and percussionist;, Mingo and his Whoopee Kids; Charlie Miró y sus Pájaros Locos; and San Germán's Happy Hills' Orchestra. One of these orchestras performed a gig at the Baños de Coamo, where producer Tommy Muñiz took notice of Castro's performance. After meeting him, Muñiz asked Castro to perform in La Taberna India, Muñiz's best rated television show, alongside Rafael Cortijo's band. Castro then returned to Mayagüez to prepare for his move to San Juan, which was supposed to occur on August 24, 1956. At a road stop in Quebradillas, however, Castro learned about the sudden death of Ramón Ortiz del Rivero (Diplo), Puerto Rico's most popular comedian at the time. With the country in mourning, Castro was forced to return to Mayagüez and wait one week for his television debut, on August 31. He played congas and sang a few of Mon Rivera's plenas with the Cortijo band that day. He later became a stagehand (first) and musical bit player within the program. When his contracts ran out, Castro returned to singing, and made a second tour of New York with the Happy Hills' Orchestra. Muñiz and other producers regularly staged shows with Puerto Rican talent at the Puerto Rico Theater near Spanish Harlem, in New York City. Asked to return to Puerto Rico by Muñiz, Castro left his orchestra and started playing regular comedy roles in Tommy Muñiz's productions such as \\"Hogar, Dulce Hogar\\" where he played Napoleoncito, the romantic interest of María Antonieta, a maid played by Carmen Belén Richardson. He later played a similar role, \\"Medio Metro\\", along Velda González's Azucena in \\"La Criada Malcriada\\", first on television, later on film. He and José Miguel Agrelot worked together in many comedy television programs and live appearances. Their professional relationship and friendship lasted over 40 years. Agrelot once joked about Castro: \\"we get along so well that I'll probably die in his birthday.\\" In the 1970s, he almost died in a car crash with his red Corvette. He hosted Máxima 940 am radio show \\"Shorty Castro a las 11\\", on weekday noons, together with long-time friend and fellow comedian Tito Negrón. After this show ended suddenly, Shorty stayed unemployed for a while until he started hosting \\"Shortyoganes\\", a new show in the same radio station and at the same daytime, along with his old friend Dr. Oswaldo Oganes. This show also ended quickly. He later hosted a third show, \\"Nuestras Raíces\\", again with Tito Negrón, on weekday mornings. Family Shorty had a son and a daughter, seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. Original characters Castro eventually became a major player in Muñiz's productions, developing comedic characters of his own. Among these were: * Ángelo - a mischievous angel that played pranks on other angels that lived among the clouds in heaven, generally annoying Ángel Guardián, the head angel, played by Jacobo Morales. This character was a favorite of Benicio del Toro's, who claims to have mimicked it as a child. * Armando Galán y Figura - a ladies' man, always on the prowl for female company and constantly acting the part * Ramoneta Cienfuegos de la O - an old maid, constantly craving male companionship, in a way similar to José Miguel Agrelot's Pasión character * Camellito - a clever drunkard, named for his prodigious consumption of alcohol, which resembled that of a camel drinking water * El Conde de París - an enigmatic, silent character -nominally a count- dressed in 1870s garb and a top hat who acted physical comedy bits that were the complete opposite of what was logically expected: pulling a ladder from behind a painter who had to hang from a ceiling, for example. The character's name is a play on Castro's home neighborhood in Mayagüez, named after Paris, France. The character played its bits against a musical backdrop: Ennio Morricone's Muscoli di Velluto, an instrumental song written for the Italian film \\"I Malamondo\\". This European-themed character was a personal favorite of Raul Julia's, who would later dress similarly in the final scene of La Gran Fiesta, a Puerto Rican film. * Don Bernabé - a brash millionaire, dressed in a white suit and Knudsen hat, who would buy out anything and anybody who would stand in his way. * Don Celedonio - an old man who plays domino in the park with three other old men in the TV show \\"Los Kakukómicos\\". Celedonio always makes fun of the one of them which always arrives late, calling him \\"Quick Arrow\\" (\\"Flecha Veloz\\"). * Panchito Zapata y Correa - a short Mexican revolutionary soldier with a large sombrero and wide moustache. * Cabo Alejo - a short policeman with a large baton. * Policarpio - a short, skilled, quick handyman who goes by the nickname \\"Poli\\"; he is the boyfriend of a handmaid named Enriqueta in the TV show \\"Entrando por la cocina\\". * El Otro Gemelo - one of a comic duo of singing twins called \\"Los Gemelos del Oeste\\", a parody of real life duo \\"Los Gemelos del Sur\\", in the TV show \\"Esto no tiene nombre\\". The other twin was Shorty's real life brother, David. They opened their act by dancing to the Jewish folk song \\"Hava Nagila\\", then told several jokes, and always ended their part fighting with each other. * Teniente Tito - also called \\"Tenientito\\" (Little Lieutenant), a short, grouchy army officer. * Rolo - a short look-alike of Shorty's friend, Cuban singer Rolando Laserie, who is always watching TV. After each news or ad he listens to, he asks his wife in a loud voice: \\"¿Oíste eso, Tita?\\" (Did you hear that, Tita?), as the real Rolando always did. Original songs Two of Castro's plenas are particularly better known. \\"Pa' los caborrojeños\\" is an ode to the people of Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, written to coincide with his stints as a singer and percussionist in one of the town's local orchestras, that of Roberto Ortiz. On the other hand, the novelty song \\"Por dos pulgadas\\" (\\"By two inches\\") was a sleeper hit for fellow comedian Juan Manuel Lebrón during Puerto Rico's 1997 Christmas season which became a #1 hit on the Billboard Latin Tropical Airplay chart.  Mayagüez' Parque del Litoral  Puerto Rican Public Law 186 (2010) honored Castro by naming a newly constructed shoreline park in Mayagüez, the Parque del Litoral, after him.

In Hindu mythology, Shraddhadeva Manu (Sanskrit manuśraddhādeva) is the current Manu and is the seventh of the 14 manus of the current kalpa (aeon). He is considered the progenitor of humanity. Forewarned about the flood by the matsya avatara of Vishnu, he saved mankind by building a boat that carried his family and the saptarishi to safety. He is the son of Vivasvana and is therefore also known as Vaivasvata Manu.The Hare Krsnas - The Manus - Manus of the Present Universe He is also called Satyavrata (always truthful).  Ancestry  According to the Puranas, the genealogy of Shraddhadeva is as follows: # Brahma # Marichi, one of the 10 Prajapatis created by Brahma. # Kashyapa, son of Marichi and his wife, Kala. Kashyapa is regarded as the father of humanity. # Vivasvan or Surya, son of Kashyapa and Aditi. # Vaivasvata Manu, because he is the son of Vivasvan and Saranyu (Saṃjñā). He is also known as Satyavrata and Shraddhadeva. The Great Deluge Matsya, the avatara of Vishnu. Shraddhadeva was the king of the Dravida Kingdom during the epoch of the Matsya Purana. According to the Matsya Purana, Matsya, the avatar of Vishnu, first appeared as a shaphari (a small carp) to Shraddhadeva while he washed his hands in a river flowing down the Malaya Mountains. The little fish asked the king to save him, and out of compassion, he put it in a water jar. It kept growing bigger and bigger, until the king first put it in a bigger pitcher, and then deposited it in a well. When the well also proved insufficient for the ever-growing fish, the King placed it in a tank (reservoir), that was two yojanas (16 miles) in height above the surface and on land, as much in length, and a yojana (8 miles) in breadth.DRISCOLL, Ian Driscoll; KURTZ, Matthew Atlantis: Egyptian Genesis, 2009.Sacred Texts. Section CLXXXVI As it grew further, the king had to put the fish in a river, and when even the river proved insufficient, he placed it in the ocean, after which it nearly filled the vast expanse of the great ocean. It was then that Vishnu, revealing himself, informed the king of an all-destructive deluge which would be coming very soon.S'rîmad Bhâgavatam (Bhâgavata Purâna)Canto 8 Chapter 24 Text 12Matsya Purana, Ch.I, 10-33 The king built a huge boat which housed his family, saptarishi, nine types of seeds, and animals to repopulate the earth, after the deluge would end and the oceans and seas would recede. At the time of deluge, Vishnu appeared as a horned fish and Shesha appeared as a rope, with which the king fastened the boat to the horn of the fish.Matsya Purana, Ch.II, 1-19 The boat was perched after the deluge on the top of the Malaya Mountains.The Matsya Purana After the deluge, Manu's family and the seven sages repopulated the earth. According to Purana, Manu's story occur before 28 chaturyuga in the present Manvantara which is the 7th Manvantara. This amounts to 120 million years ago. This narrative is similar to other flood myths like the Gilgamesh flood myth and the Genesis flood narrative.  Descendants  Shraddhadeva married Shraddha and had ten children including Ila and Ikshvaku, the progenitors of the Lunar and Solar dynasties, respectively. The Mahabharata states:Mahabharata Book 1:Adi Parva:Sambhava Parva:Section LXXV, p. 183.The Laws of Manu , translated by George Bühler. Theosophy Conversation between Manu and Bṛhaspati In Theosophy, the \\"Vaivasvata Manu\\" is one of the most important beings at the highest level of Initiation of the ancient Vedic sages, along with Maitreya, and the Maha Chohan. According to Theosophy, each root race has its own Manu who physically incarnates in an advanced body of an individual of the old root race and physically progenerates with a suitable female partner the first individuals of the new root race.

He is a graduate of Oxford University and in addition to a DM has two degrees in psychology.\\"Anthony Stevens, a well-known analyst, psychiatrist and writer on psychology ... calls for a synthesis between the researches of analysts and psychologists who study the dreams of patients and the studies of brain chemistry being undertaken by neuroscientists.\\", Times Higher Education Supplement, 19 May 1995. He is a member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and a senior member of the Independent Group of Analytical Psychologists. Early in his career Stevens did research under the supervision of John Bowlby into the development of attachment bonds between infants and their nurses in a Greek orphanage. This led him to appreciate the role played by archetypal components in the formation of mother-child attachments and was to provide him with the basic insights which inspired his magnum opus, Archetype: A Natural History of The Self. In this book he examines the close conceptual parallelism that exists between the ‘patterns of behaviour’ and their underlying ‘innate releasing mechanisms’ studied by ethology (the branch of biology which studies animal behaviour in the wild) and Jung’s notion of archetypes functioning as ‘active living dispositions’ in the human ‘collective unconscious’. He suggested that together the two disciplines of ethology and analytical psychology could provide the tools required to examine how the human psyche has evolved out of its reptilian, mammalian, and primate precursors to assume the characteristics that are apparent in us at the present time. In addition to maternal attachment, he used this approach to elucidate such phenomena as xenophobia, puberty initiation, sexual bonding, the developmental programme evident in the human life cycle, and so on, attempting to demonstrate that each had an archetypal basis in the genetic endowment and phylogenetic history of our species. In subsequent books and papers he applies the same approach to dreams, symbolism, warfare, and psychiatry. Stevens lives in retirement on the Greek island of Corfu.

In 1958, it still held that \\"Abortion and infanticide are to be condemned.\\" In 1966 Joseph M. Harte, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Arizona founded Episcopalians for Life.Bishop Joseph M. Harte Biography From 1983 to 1996 NOEL operated from Fairfax, Virginia. It published newsletters and educational resources to present their pro-life concerns. NOEL's ministry reached nationwide, ministering to women in unplanned pregnancies, educating Episcopalians about abortion, and working to influence the church by introducing pro-life resolutions at General Conventions. In 1988, the 69th General Convention of the Episcopal Church adopted a resolution that stated: \\"All human life is sacred. Hence it is sacred from its inception until death.\\" The statement went on to call for church programs to assist women with problem pregnancies and to emphasize the seriousness of the abortion decision. In 1994, the Episcopal Church was the first church member of the Anglican Communion to fully support legal abortion at the 71st General Convention, expressing its \\"unequivocal opposition to any... action... that [would] abridge the right of a woman to reach an informed decision about the termination of her pregnancy, or that would limit the access of a woman to a safe means of acting upon her decision.\\" In 1996 the NOEL headquarters moved from Virginia to Sewickley, Pennsylvania.

She was the featured magician on the cover of the June 2009 issue of the magicians' magazine The Linking Ring. Early life Johnson was born in Glens Falls, NY and grew up in Carmel, Indiana. Her mother, Sunny Johnson, was also a performer, being best known as a clown although she also did magic. Sunny, who was featured on the front cover of The Linking Ring magazine in March 2002, still lives in Carmel, where she owns a clowning supplies company. Johnson began learning magic when she was a teenager and used it to earn money to help pay her way through college. Performing career Johnson and her husband Kevin Ridgeway are Christians and, under the name Living Illusions, built up a reputation as performers specialising in faith based events. These included the Will Graham Celebration with evangelist Billy Graham's grandson in May 2008. In 2007 they launched a full-length touring theater show under the name Breathless, which has played across the United States. Johnson's signature escape is the Full View Water Torture Cell - in which she is chained up and locked inside a water filled tank from which she escapes in full view of the audience. The full view aspect differentiates it from Houdini's water torture cell escape, which required a curtain to be drawn to obscure him from the audience while he escaped. She performed the original version of the stunt as part of the Worldwide Escape Artist's Relay in 2005, which was an attempt to set a world record for the largest number of escapes performed in a day. On October 29, 2006, during the 4th Annual International Escape Convention, Johnson was presented with The Masters Award by Thomas Blacke of Escape Masters magazine. She performed a new version of her Full view water cell, making her one of only two artists to have performed at the first four international escape artist conventions that had been held.For 2nd convention see For 4th convention see Full View Water Torture Cell Johnson's Water cell stunt requires her to hold her breath while she picks a series of locks that fasten chains and secure the lid of the cell. She averages 2 minutes and 48 seconds underwater on one breath, however she has occasionally taken up to 3 minutes and 18 seconds to free herself. The longest time she has ever held her breath is 5 minutes and 2 seconds. She ends her shows with this escape and has performed it as often as 30 times in ten days. She offers a $10,000 challenge to anyone who can prove that she takes a second breath, uses an underwater breathing apparatus or a key once she has dropped below the water. Wayne N. Kawamoto from About: magic has written: \\"Her escape was the most dramatic and involving that I have ever witnessed.

It houses a Museum of Ceramics. History The Town Hall is distinguished by its slenderness and grace. Its tower of height of 53 meters is the highest in the old city. Present Town Hall located in the square was not the first in Kaunas. The previous one was destroyed by the fire. The construction of Kaunas town hall started in 1542. At first it was a one-storey building with not daubed facade and vaulting cellars. In the 16th century the first floor was built and the eight storey tower was built in the east of the building. The ground floor was adjusted for trading and prison guards, the first floor - for trial, magistrate, treasure, archive and office. Cellars were used to store the goods. The cellars of the tower were used as a prison. In the year 1638 the renaissance reconstruction was made. In the year 1771 -1775 the second reconstruction was made by architect J. Matekeris. He rebuilt the part of building, which was demolished in the 17th century, replanned the premises and added additional floor to the tower. He decorated the town hall with baroque and classicism style decorations, rebuilt the pediment and erected there the sculptures of Grand Dukes of Lithuania (they survived only until the 19th century). The Town Hall (19th century, Napoleon Orda) In the year 1824 the town hall was used as the premises of the orthodox church and later - ammunition storage. In the year 1836 the town hall was reconstructed again. The residence for Russian czars was made there. From the year 1862 and 1869 there was The Kaunas town club, Russian club, firemen office and Russian theatre. In the year 1869 Kaunas municipality was established in the Town hall. In the year 1944 it was replaced by the archive and in the year 1951 the archive was replaced by Kaunas technical institute. Town Hall at Night 2016 In 1973 the Wedding Hall (marriage registration office) was opened in the ground and first floor of Town hall. The cellars were used by a Ceramics museum. The same year reconstruction damaged the building a lot. In the year 2005 the last reconstruction was made, some of damage was eliminated and the Town hall was painted this time not with white color, but with ivory. Kaunas Town hall is called \\"The white swan\\". Today it is used for the wedding ceremonies, official welcome of city guests, signing of agreements and official events. It features a historical museum of the city mayor, and stores the most important attributes of the city used in ceremonies – a great city key, a mayor’s mark (a gilded chain), samples of the city’s coats of arms and flags, a ceremonial master’s sign and a traditional bell, and the historic flag of the temporary capital city of 1930. The city’s guest book is stored in the Town Hall, and currently has over 350 entries, among them greetings by four kings and queens, three dukes, twelve presidents, Pope John Paul II, cardinals, mayors of other European cities and other famous people.

This detail compares the original design (left) and the submitted alternate detail for the skywalks at the Hyatt Regency, Kansas City. The proposed alternate compounded the loads on the bolts, which resulted in the skywalks collapsing on July 17, 1981. 114 people were killed. This example illustrates the importance of submittal review. Submittals in construction management are shop drawings, material data, samples, and product data. Submittals are required primarily for the architect and engineer to verify that the correct products will be installed on the project. This process also gives the architect and sub-consultants the opportunity to select colors, patterns, and types of material that were not chosen prior to completion of the construction drawings. This is not an occasion for the architect to select different materials than specified, but rather to clarify the selection within the quality level indicated in the specification and quantities shown on plans. For materials requiring fabrication, such as reinforcing steel and structural steel, the architect and engineer need to verify details furnished by the fabricator as well as the required quantities are met. The details from the fabricator reflect both material availability and production expediency. One tragic example of a submitted alternate design is the suspension rod and bolting details resulting in the Hyatt Regency walkway collapse. The steel fabricator was unable to produce lengths of steel as originally designed and proposed using shorter lengths. The proposed alternate compounded the loads on the bolts, which resulted in the skywalks collapsing on July 17, 1981. 114 people were killed. The contractor also uses this information in installation, using dimensions and installation data from the submittal. The construction documents, specifically the technical specifications, require the contractor to submit product data, samples, and shop drawings to the architect and engineer for approval. This is one of the first steps that is taken by the contractor after execution of the construction contract and issuance of the \\"Notice to Proceed\\". The submittal process affects cost, quality, schedule, and project success. On large, commercial projects the submittal process can involve thousands of different materials, fabrications and equipment. Commercial buildings will often have complex pre-fabricated components. These include: elevators, windows, cabinets, air handling units, generators, appliances and cooling towers. These pieces of equipment often require close coordination to ensure that they receive the correct power, fuel, water and structural support. The submittal process gives another level of detail usually not included as part of the design documents. An \\"approved\\" submittal authorizes quantity and quality of a material or an assembly to be released for fabrication and shipment. It ensures that the submittals have been properly vetted before final ordering. In essence, this is the final quality control mechanism before a product arrives on-site. Types of Submittals =Product Data Submittal= The product data submittal usually consists of the manufacturer’s product information. The information included in this submittal are: *Manufacturer, trade name, model or type number and quantities: This information is necessary to compare the submitted item with the specified products and acceptable products listed, in the specification and addenda. *Description of use and performance characteristics: Information should be furnished describing the normal use and expected performance of the product. The architect and contractor reviews this information to confirm that the product is appropriate for the intended use. *Size and physical characteristics: The size and physical characteristics, such as adjustment capabilities, which is reviewed by both the contractor and architect. The contractor has the most available information for comparing adjoining materials and equipment. The contractor also needs to know the size and weight of the equipment for lifting and handling considerations. *Finish characteristics: The architect reviews the available finishes and selects the appropriate finish, if the finish was not previously specified in the documents. The contractor should confirm that finish requirements in the specification are being met by the product. *Specific request for jobsite dimensions: Some materials are custom-fabricated to job conditions, requiring dimensions from the jobsite. These jobsite dimensions are provided by the contractor, prior to release of the product for manufacture. =Shop Drawing= See the article: Shop drawing. =Samples= Many products require submission of samples. A sample is a physical portion of the specified product. Some samples are full product samples, such as a brick or section of precast concrete, or a partial sample that indicates color or texture. http://www.aafes.com/pz-s/construction/Ft%20Benning-Reception%20Ctr/SPECS.pdf The product sample is often required when several products are acceptable, to confirm the quality and aesthetic level of the material. The size or unit of sample material usually is specified. For some materials, a mock-up or sample panel is necessary. A common example of a sample panel is a wall mock-up. This is a full size mock-up of a wall assembly and can include window, exterior veneers and waterproofing. The mock-up serves as both an aesthetic review, but also provides the contractors the opportunity to field test the assembly before full-scale assembly. The mock up may be required to be tested for water tightness and lateral forces. The mock-up panel might be 10 feet wide by 12 feet high, showing the full wall span from floor to floor. Samples usually are required for finish selection or approval. Color and textures in the actual product can vary considerably from the color and textures shown in printed material. The printed brochure gives an indication of available colors, but the colors are rendered in printer’s ink, rather than in the actual material. A quality level may be specified, requiring a selection of color and/or texture from sample pieces of the material. Several acceptable manufacturers may be listed in the specification and a level of quality also may be specified. The contractor, subcontractor, or supplier may have a preference for one of these products, based on price, availability, quality, workability, or service. Samples are usually stored at the jobsite and compared to the material delivered and installed. Comparison of samples with the product received is an important part of project quality control. Review of Submittals Processing time is required to produce and review submittals, shop drawings, and samples. The procedures can seem very cumbersome and time consuming, however, there are substantial reasons for review steps by all parties. The designer is ultimately responsible for the design of the facility to meet occupancy needs and must ensure that the products being installed are suitable to meet these needs. Any change in material fabrication or quantity needs to be reviewed for its acceptability with the original design. Both the architect, contractor and sub-contractor need to be able to coordinate the installation of the product with other building systems. Each level must review, add information as necessary, and stamp or seal that the submittal was examined and approved by that party. After the submittal reaches the primary reviewer, it is returned through the same steps, which provides an opportunity for further comment and assures that each party is aware of the approval, partial approval, notes, or rejection. This approval process is cumbersome and time-consuming. However, modern software products can greatly simplify and improve the efficiency. Typically, the architect will review the submittal for compliance to the requirement in the construction documents. Revisions may be noted on the submittal. Colors and other selection items will be made by the architect during this review. Sometimes the architect will reject the entire submittal and other times will request resubmittal of some of the items. The architect also will make corrections, which normally do not need to be resubmitted, but that do need to be applied to the product. While the architect and engineers review products for performance and design intent, the contractor must review the product for preparation, quantity and installation requirements. The contractor should manage the submittal process just like any other process in the construction cycle. The submittal process requires lead- time consideration to produce the submittal, shop drawing (engineering), review and revise and the shop fabrication period. Careful planning is necessary to ensure that the products are ordered and delivered within the construction schedule, so as not to delay any activities. The contractor must prioritize the submittal process, submitting and obtaining approval for materials needed for the first part of the project. Notes References *Anumba C.J. and N.F.O.

Introduced in the original Streets of Rage in 1991, she is playable in all four games, starting out as an ex-police vigilante in the first game and becoming a private detective by the third game. Blaze is a master of judo who helps her companions, Adam Hunter and Axel Stone, defeat the crime syndicate boss Mr. X throughout all three games. Originally the least strong but fastest of the first game's roster, Blaze later became an all-round fighter of the series as well as a favorite of many. The characters of Mona and Lisa from Streets of Rage (Onihime and Yasha in Bare Knuckle) and Mace from Fighting Force are based on her. Blaze Fielding has been well received by the gaming press, noted for being one of the earliest female heroes in video games. Appearances =Video games= Blaze Fielding made her debut in 1991's Streets of Rage (SoR) as a 21-year-old, low-rank officer in the Police Department of an unnamed large American city. Blaze is the leader of the three young cops who quit the city's corrupt police force in order to settle the rampage that has plagued the city and find out who is behind those events. Along with Adam Hunter and Axel Stone, she manages to defeat the syndicate leader (later named Mr. X) in his own headquarters. In Streets of Rage 2 (1992), set one year later, Blaze, who has moved out of the city and became a dance instructor, discovers along with Axel and Adam's kid brother \\"Skate\\" that Adam has been kidnapped by Mr. X, who was believed to be dead in the previous battle, in order to lure Axel and Blaze to him in retaliation for his prior defeat. She and Axel set out to rescue their friend with Skate and a professional wrestler Max Thunder who too is one of Axel's friends. They manage to reach the hidden headquarters of the Syndicate on an isolated island and defeat Mr. X once again and free Adam in the end. In Bare Knuckle III, the Japanese language version of Streets of Rage 3 (1994), Blaze, along with Axel, has rejoined the police force after the events of Streets of Rage 2. During the events of Bare Knuckle III, Axel and Blaze are being assigned to the leading two cases that will actually reveal to be interconnected: an explosion in the Wood Oak city that could be related to the Syndicate's activities, and the disappearance of General Petrov that could lead to a war between nations. They are being assisted by Adam, Skate and a mysterious ex-researcher Dr. Zan. The English language version of Streets of Rage 3, which features a slightly altered storyline, has Blaze stay in the city after the events of Streets of Rage 2 and become a private detective. When informed by Dr. Zan that the next victim of the Syndicate's evil scheme will be her old friend, the Chief of Police, she immediately sets up a task force to go to his rescue. In 2018, Blaze was announced to return in Streets of Rage 4. She is featured as one of the five playable characters in the game, alongside Axel, Adam and newcomers Cherry Hunter and Floyd Iraia. =Other media= Blaze appears in the Streets of Rage comic written by Mark Millar, originally serialized in Sonic the Comic in 1993 and later published as Streets of Rage: Bad City Fighters. In the bonus story \\"Facts of Life\\" from Sonic the Poster Mag, Blaze and her friends Axel, Max and Skates are abducted by corrupt NYPD officers, but before they can be executed a young honest cop releases her and she rescues the others. The main story shows how Blaze and the others quit the force and became vigilante crime-fighters. She also appears in the Streets of Rage 2 non-canon novella that came with Sega Force magazine, written by Mat Yeo in 1993. In it, Blaze is a CIA agent who, following the events of the first game, returned to Washington after both Axel and Adam fell in love with her and she was unable to choose. In the five years between the events of the two games, she joins an elite intelligence service STRIKE, before reuniting with Axel to help him rescue Adam and defeat Mr. X (with Blaze killing his ninja bodyguard Shiva). In 2016, Sega announced Blaze is planned to appear in their film and television adaptations of the Streets of Rage series. Character design and gameplay A concept art of Blaze in Streets of Rage 4 As disclosed in Read- Only Memory's Sega Mega Drive/Genesis: Collected Works, Blaze had originally began as a Hong Kong Chinese kung-fu lady named Pink Typhoon in the design document for D-SWAT, a game that became Bare Knuckle / Streets of Rage. While Blaze always has brown hair in-game, the main screen, portrait and ending scene in the first game show her with black hair. She wears, along with boots and gloves, a bright red headband, red leather jacket and red miniskirt in the first game; a red bra and miniskirt in the sequel; and the silver version of it in third game (red in Japan).Mean Machines Sega 20 (June 1994), page 48. Backbone Entertainment's rejected pitch for a reboot of Street of Rage featured an updated look of Blaze based on her earlier appearances. In Dotemu's upcoming Streets of Rage 4, Blaze is \\"still a beautiful thirty something bad ass woman.\\" Blaze is a weak-but-fast character in the first Streets of Rage, but has become the series' \\"all-rounder\\" by the second game. She mostly uses her powerful legs to fight and is a judo expert, giving her a more powerful, body-slamming throw move than the other characters. With her balanced stats and good techniques, Blaze is commonly regarded as the best of the playable characters in Streets of Rage 2Mean Machines Sega 3 (December 1992), page 138.Retro Gamer 77, page 63.Retro Gamer 52, page 46. and Streets of Rage 3.Sega Visions 20 (August–September 1994), page 28.Sega Magazin 5/1994, page 86.Sega Pro (Germany) 7/1994, page 50. Her special techniques in the later two games are a cartwheel kick Embukyaku (ダンスキック) and a chi blast attack Kikoushko (カイパーム, \\"Wind Blast\\" in SoR3); her Hishousouzan (フライングタロンスラッシュ, \\"Flying Double Cut\\" in SoR3) is a forward somersault to stun enemies with her fists.Sega Pro (Germany) 3/1993, page 26. Her special moves have been compared to these of Street Fighter characters RyuMEGA 4 (January 1993), page 38. and Guile. She is the only character that performs a special weapon move in SoR2 (a double-hit with a knife). Blaze is the only character that kept her idle move (runs her hand through her hair) through the series. Her jump kick animation was censored in the U.S. version Streets of Rage 2 as to not glimpse her underwear, which surprised the Japanese development team. In the first Streets of Rage, stage-boss twin pair Onihime and Yasha, or Mona and Lisa in the English version, are palette swaps of Blaze's game spriteRetro Gamer 133, page 70. (they look distinctively different from Blaze in Streets of Rage 3). Blaze from Core Design's abortive project of Streets of Rage 4 / Streets of Rage 3D for the Saturn was turned into Mace Daniels in Fighting Force (1997) when this game has been turned into a standalone title; Mace has still continued to be named 'Blaze' in Judgement Force, the pre-release version of Fighting Force. In another canceled Street of Rage 4 project, for the Dreamcast in 1999, Blaze was to be replaced by a female ninja character named Erie and using a similar fighting style. Reception Blaze Fielding was well received, noted for being one of the first strong female heroines in video games, especially on Sega platforms and in the beat 'em up genre, with Violet Berlin describing Blaze as \\"a welcome change\\" when she \\"spoke out for the girls\\" in 1993.MEGA 6 (March 1993), page 15. According to Brazilian Gamers in 1993, Blaze has already been \\"acclaimed by game maniacs as one of the muses of games;\\"Gamers 2 p.34. (\\"Blaze, uma morena muito sensual, aclamada pelos gamemaníacos como uma das musas dos games.\\") German Mega Fun called her the strongest \\"video game babe\\" after Chun-Li,Mega Fun 2/1994 p. 104. (\\"Blaze, das schärfste Videogamebabe nach Chun Li\\".) and Italian Game Power opined Blaze was superior to Chun-Li, even as she was \\"not as beautiful as Final Fight 2's Maki.\\" GameZone's Nick Akerman ranked Blaze as the third toughest female character in gaming in 2008, as did the staff of MeriStation in 2015. IGN Spain put up Blaze and Tyris Flare from Golden Axe to represent the beat 'em up genre in their 2013 list of top ten \\"classic game heroines\\". TechRaptor's Georgina Young included this \\"fan favorite\\" on her 2015 list of top six \\"feminist female protagonists\\" in video games. The staff of Retro Gamer chose Blaze as one of the classic \\"ingredients needed to make the ultimate scrolling fighter\\" as the \\"Player 2 character\\" (Player 1's being Mike Haggar from Final Fight).Retro Gamer 128, page 80. She was also noted for her sex appeal, in particular for the upskirt animation frames, removal of which in America was one early instances of sexual content censored in video games. Famitsu described it as a Japanese fan \\"dogma\\" of \\"Blaze=panties\\" while discussing the Western censorship. Electronic Gaming Monthly named her as the \\"Hottest Video Game Babe\\" of 1993. Digital Press Karl Youngman featured Blaze in his article \\"Classic Babes in Videogames\\" as a representative of a 'biker chick' trope, opining she has best legs in video games and stating that after seeing her he \\"didn't care if I ever saw another 'real' girl again,\\" and a Famitsu reviewer admitted to \\"worship\\" Blaze for both her fighting technique and her sexiness. In 2011, GamesRadar's Jim Sterling recalled this \\"16-bit stunner\\" as \\"one of the sexiest sprites ever.\\" Computer & Video Games compared the \\"gorgeous\\" Blaze to their own Yvette Nicholls, and USgamer's Jeremy Parish speculated Final Fight 3s Lucia might have been \\"Capcom's answer to Streets of Rage favorite Blaze, wearing her short shorts and a tiny vest over a crop-top as she leaps and kicks foes.\\" Italian magazine Mega Console compared Blaze to the superheroine Wonder Woman.MEGA CONSOLE 3 p.83.

Their music combines elements of folk, rock and pop and country. The band has released 5 albums, along with several collections and side projects. They have recorded for Undertow Music since 2002. Early Days Christiansen and Dawson first came to prominence in Chicago with a twang-punk band, Stump the Host. The two founded Dolly Varden in 1993 when Stump The Host disbanded. They originally started as a quartet comprising Dawson, Christiansen, Lisa Wertman Crowe (bass) and Matt Thobe (drums). This lineup recorded a 4-song cassette EP with Brad Wood at Idful Studios in Chicago. After a few months Mark Balletto was added as an additional guitarist. This lineup recorded 3 more songs with Brian Deck and released them along with the Idful recordings as \\"Pet Me\\", a 6-song cassette. In 1994 the group recorded an EP with Doug McBride at Gravity studios in Chicago that has never been released. Lisa left the band in early 1995 and was replaced by Mike Bradburn, thus cementing the line-up that has remained unchanged to the present day (Feb 2011). Career The band released their first album, Mouthful of Lies in 1995. It was recorded in Christiansen's art studio on a 4-track and released on their own Mid-Fi label. 'Mouthful of Lie's' was played regularly on WXRT-FM in Chicago and was named one of the best local albums of 1995 by DJ Richard Milne. The album also got noticed by a handful of national critics and led to the band being courted by several major labels. Dolly Varden signed on with manager Bob Andrews of Undertow Music at this time. Though RCA Records offered the group a 'demo' deal, which would have had the band record songs for RCA's staff to decide whether or not they wanted to release them, the band chose to sign with New York indie label Evil Teen for their second album, which was already in progress. The Thrill of Gravity (1998) was produced by Dolly Varden and recorded by Bundy K. Brown at Uberstudio in Chicago, and features guest appearances by David Grubbs (piano), and Julie Liu on violin. The band did their first national U.S. touring for 'Gravity', supporting Whiskeytown and Gov't Mule, and headlining shows in the Midwest and on the East Coast. '' Dolly Varden's third album, The Dumbest Magnets (Evil Teen Records, 2000), was produced and recorded by Brad Jones (Chuck Prophet, Josh Rouse) at his Alex the Great Studio in Nashville, TN. (The Dumbest Magnets was licensed in 2001 for release in the UK on Flying Sparks Records and in Europe on Fargo Records). \\"Magnets\\" significantly raised the group's profile with rave reviews in Rolling Stone, The Village Voice, No Depression Magazine, Uncut, CMJ and many daily papers across the U.S. The band increased their touring schedule, adding dates in the U.K. and France throughout 2000 and 2001. Legendary BBC radio host Bob Harris was a big supporter of the album and the group in the U.K. For their fourth album, \\"Forgiven Now, released in March 2002 on the newly formed Undertow Records, the group once again recorded with Brad Jones in Nashville, TN. Pedal Steel legend Al Perkins (Rolling Stones, Gram Parsons) makes a guest appearance on the songs \\"There's A Magic\\" and \\"The Lotus Hour\\". 2002 was the group's busiest year of touring to date with shows from coast-to-coast in the U.S. (including an East Coast tour with Jay Bennett and Edward Burch) and 2 trips to the U.K.'' Hiatus After writing, recording and touring together for over eight years, the group took a step back in 2003 to pursue side projects and raise families. Drummer Matt Thobe and bassist Mike Bradburn both became new fathers and chose to take time off from touring. In 2003, Steve and Diane released an album together called Duets. In 2004, guitarist Mark Balletto formed a band called My Record Player and made a self-titled pop rock album reminiscent of the music that originally inspired him to play guitar. In 2005, Dawson recorded a solo album, Sweet Is The Anchor (Undertow Records), heavily influenced by early '70s soul and singer-songwriters. Return The band released their fifth album, 2007's The Panic Bell (Undertow Records), to great reviews in the U.S. and the U.K. and toured the East Coast and the UK in the same year. In 2008 Dolly Varden celebrated the 13th anniversary of their debut album, \\"Mouthful of Lies\\", by releasing a limited-edition 2-CD set (disc 1: \\"The Best of Dolly Varden\\", Disc 2: \\"Rarities\\") and hosting a sold out show at Chicago's Old Town School of Folk Music with special guests Lisa Wertman Crowe, Robbie Fulks, Edward Burch and others. In 2009 and 2010 the group played sporadically in Chicago and St. Louis as Dawson focused on his second solo album, \\"I Will Miss The Trumpets and the Drums\\" and Christiansen focused on a large art installation project, \\"Notes To Nonself\\" with collaborator Shoshanna Utchenik. The band released its sixth studio album, For a While, in 2013. Steve Dawson has said that For a While is notable in that all the songs were written by him or with Diane and that this is the first album in which he has \\"followed my own songwriting advice.\\" Members *Steve Dawson - guitar, lead vocals *Diane Christiansen - guitar, lead vocals *Mark Balletto - guitar, vocals *Mike Bradburn - bass *Matt Thobe - drums Past Members: *Lisa Wertman Crowe - bass, vocals Discography =Early Demos= *Dolly Varden 1993 (cassette) *Pet Me 1994 (cassette) *Gravity Sessions 1994 (unreleased) =Dolly Varden= *Mouthful of Lies 1995 (Mid-Fi Records) *The Thrill of Gravity 1998 (Evil Teen Records) *The Dumbest Magnets 2000 (Evil Teen (US), Flying Sparks (UK), Fargo (Europe)) *Forgiven Now 2002 (Undertow) *The Panic Bell 2007 (Undertow) *13 (2-CD compilation) 2008 (self-release) *For a While 2013 (Mid-Fi) =Steve Dawson & Diane Christiansen= *Duets 2003 (Undertow) =My Record Player= *Come Around 2004 (MRP) =Steve Dawson= *Sweet Is The Anchor 2005 (Undertow) *I Will Miss The Trumpets and the Drums 2010 (Undertow) Reception *\\"The Chicago group Dolly Varden produces rootsy, atmospheric tunes laced with rock, country, and soul influences.

Charles Lawrence In 1754, Nova Scotia's Lieutenant Governor Charles Lawrence, offered land grants to twenty families, who referred to their settlement as Lawrence's Town, which became Lawrencetown. The Acadians and natives resisted the British occupation of Nova Scotia and Acadia by raiding the various communities. In late April 1754, at the outbreak of the French and Indian War, Beausoleil and a large band of Mi'kmaq and Acadians left Chignecto for Lawrencetown. They arrived in mid-May and in the night open fired on the village. Beausoleil killed and scalped four British settlers and two soldiers.

It lies to the north- west of the town of Templemore. The mountain is usually ascended via the townsland of Barnane. There is a car park at the base. History According to local legend, the mountain got its name because the devil took a bite out of it. There is a small gap in the mountain between one outcrop of rock (known as the Rock) and another small plateau. The bite the devil allegedly took made this gap. The legend suggests that the devil broke his teeth taking this bite and spat the Rock of Cashel from his mouth to where it now stands. The Book of Dimma was supposedly discovered in a cave on the mountain in 1789. It is an illuminated manuscript copy of the four Gospels and was written in the monastery of St. Cronan in Roscrea some time during the 8th century. According to legend, Cronan ordered his scribe Dimma to produce the manuscript before sunset on that day. He then used miraculous powers to ensure that the sun did not set for forty days, and Dimma spent all of this period completing the manuscript without feeling the need to eat or sleep.Halpin, J. (1890) \\"The Book of Dhimma\\", Irish Ecclesiastical Record, Vol 11, pp.325–334, available online at http://brigid-undertheoak.blogspot.com/2009/09/book-of-dimma.html The manuscript disappeared following the dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century. There is some debate about whether or not the manuscript was actually found on the Devil's Bit amid claims that it could not have survived without damage in an outdoor environment for over two centuries.Betham, W. (1826) Irish Antiquarian Researches, Vol. 1, pp. 39–109 available online at Google Books The Book of Dimma is currently housed in the library of Trinity College Dublin. The mountain was the scene of a mass anti-tithe meeting on 25 July 1832. The meeting was part of a wider campaign of resistance to the payment of tithes (one-tenth of the value of arable produce) to the Church of Ireland by the majority Catholic population.Higgins, N. (2002) Tipperary's Tithe War 1830–1838: Parish accounts of resistance against a Church tax, St. Helen's Press, Tipperary According to press reports of the time, over 50,000 people attended, many coming from as far away as Co. Galway, although the attendance would have been larger had there not been confusion about whether or not the meeting was cancelled.The Tipperary Free Press, 25 July 1832 Although local folklore states that Daniel O' Connell attended the meeting, it is almost certain that he was not present as he was attending parliamentary debates in Westminster at the time. A semi-fictional account of the meeting was given by Samuel Lover in Legends and Stories of Ireland (1834), where he refers to a mock 'burial' of the tithes by local peasantry.Lover, S. (1834) \\"The Burial of the Tithe\\" in Legends and Stories of Ireland, Baldwin & Cradock, London, pp. 67–106 The tower on the approach to the summit is known as Carden's Folly. The Cardens were an Anglo-Irish aristocratic family who arrived in Ireland during the seventeenth century. They purchased estates in Templemore and Barnane and became the principal landlords in the area in subsequent centuries. The most notable Carden was undoubtedly John Rutter Carden (1811–1866), better known as 'Woodcock', so-called by irate tenants because he was as difficult to shoot as the bird of that name. As well as constructing the folly, he built a magnificent family home on the lower slopes of the mountain. Although the house was demolished in the early 20th century, the ruins of the walled garden can still be seen. In 1854, 'Woodcock' made a notorious attempt to kidnap a lady, Eleanor Arbuthnot, with whom he had become obsessed. A detailed history of the Carden family has been published by a descendant, Arthur Eustace Carden.Carden, A. E. (2004) Carden of Barnane: History of the Barnane Estate in County Tipperary A cross was erected on the Rock in 1953–1954 in celebration of the 'Marian Year dedicated by the Roman Catholic Church. A committee was formed and planning of the work began in early 1953 and construction began in September of that year, it was constructed by the Duggan Brothers. The project manager was Stephen (Steedie) Grey of Templemore. Work was completed at a cost of approximately IR£2,000.The Tipperary Star, 28 August 1954, p.5 The cross was officially blessed by the Archbishop of Cashel and Emly, Most Rev. Dr. Jeremiah Kinane, on Sunday, 22 August 1954. It stands 45 feet high and has a span of 25 feet. The base of 340 tons is 5 feet squared and 10 feet deep. All tools and materials for this construction project were carried to the Rock by hand. The cross is presently illuminated at night. Holy Mass is celebrated at the base of the Rock each year on Rock Sunday, which is the closest Sunday to the feast of St James (25 July). A statue of the Virgin Mary was erected in 1988 on the eastern side of the Rock. A 1980 article in the journal Nature described the finding on the mountain of the earliest record of a fossil flora containing Cooksonia-type sporangia. The Devil's Bit Mountain Statue of the Virgin Mary Carden's Folly View from Devil's Bit Topography The southwestern extremity of the Slieve Bloom range just touches Tipperary at Roscrea. The valley in which Roscrea stands separates this end of Slieve Bloom from the Devil's Bit range, which begins immediately south of the town and runs southwest. This mountain has a singular gap in its contour (very conspicuous from the railway), from which it was formerly called Barnane-Ely, i.e., the gapped mountain of Ely (the old territory in which it was situated), which is still the name of the parish. The other chief summits are Kilduff Mountain (1,462 feet; 445.6 m), Borrisnoe (1,471 feet; 448.4 m), and Benduff (1,399 feet; 426.4 m), all near Devil's Bit in a line to the northwest; and 4 miles (6.4 km) southwest of Devil's Bit, Knockanora (1,429 feet; 435.6 m) and Latteragh (1,257 feet; 383.1 m).http://www.libraryireland.com/Atlas/Tipperary.php The Devil's Bit offers expansive views of the surrounding countryside. When the cross was erected, it was said that nine counties can be viewed from the summit – Tipperary itself, Clare, Cork, Galway, Kilkenny, Laois, Limerick, Offaly, and Waterford.The Tipperary Star, 28 August 1954, p. 1 There is doubt as to whether any part of County Cork is actually visible. One can see the Knockmealdown and Comeragh Mountains in Waterford, along with the Galtees, and, to the north-west, Lough Derg and the River Shannon.Joyce, Patrick Weston (1883). The geography of the counties of Ireland p. 173. Oxford University The triangulation station which marks the highest point of the mountain is on the 'Long Rock' which lies to the east of the Gap. The Long Rock can be climbed if one passes through the Gap and follows the pathway to the right. There is a military firing range on the western slopes of the mountain.

Childhood and studies  León Cadogan was born in Asunción a few months after his Australian parents, John Cadogan (Welsh origin) and Rose Stone (Polish father and Irish mother) who previously used the name Rose Summerfield by her first marriage, came to Paraguay as part of a group of a few hundred people who migrated there in 1893 and 1894.Kevin Murray, \\"Why Paraguay? Australia in the Latin mirror\\" in Art Monthly, #209, May 2008, pp. 39-42. Retrieved 2010-02-04. Led by the mercurial and stridently racist William Lane, the group created New Australia (near the town of Coronel Oviedo), a utopian colony espousing socialism, teetotalism and the ethnocentrism that had already produced an official White Australia policy in their homeland. The New Australia colony soon collapsed in dissension, and its members obtained freehold land instead. A fire in his parents' home in 1904 forced the Cadogan family to leave the colony. They settled in Villarrica, a town with a German- speaking population substantial enough to warrant a newspaper, Villarrica- Actual, that publishes in Spanish and German. Attending that city's German- language school, León, who had previously learned English, Spanish, and Guaraní, learned German as well. He was 18 when he began working as a clerk for the cold-storage facilities of Swift & Co.'s slaughterhouse in the Zevallos Cué barrio of Asunción. Through a friendship struck up with the Frenchman Emile Lelieur, he learned French and gained the opportunity to read classic authors, to learn elementary mathematics and the use of logarithms. In 1919 he moved to Buenos Aires, and two years later his restless spirit led him to the jungles of Caaguazú, where he worked harvesting yerba maté. Absorbed by the rugged and primitive environment, he became interested in the life of the Guaraní people. Cadogan studied, published and became an authority on Mbyá Guaraní, Ava-Guaraní, Pai-tavytera, and Ache-guayaki -- various Guaraní tribes living in the forests of eastern Paraguay. Cadogan was accepted as a member of the Mbya-Guaraní and initiated under the spiritual name of \\"Tupa Kuchubi Veve\\" (\\"One who flies like a whirlwind\\"). The Mbya-Guarani had a secret, esoteric religious language unknown to the world until his initiation. Following the traditions of the group, he kept this name secret until his death. Cadogan published several studies of the language, religion and culture of the Guaraní, becoming a recognized authority of this group. One of his most famous works is Ayvu Rapyta, a collection of religious traditions of the Mbya- Guarani. His works were published in academic publications in Paraguay, Uruguay, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Austria, France and the USA. In 1949 President Felipe Molas López appointed him \\"Protector of Indians\\", but he later lost favour with the thuggish dictator Alfredo Stroessner who tried to politicize and dismantle the organization protecting the indigenous group. Cadogan died in 1973 after forty years dedicated to the Guaraní cause and denunciation of the systemic persecution and abuse they had been subjected to. His library was donated to the Catholic University of Asunción. Pursuant to municipal ordinance 9513/76, a street near his home was named after him. Paraguayans consider him as one of the 100 most important people of the millennium. Léon Cadogan's son Rodger Cadogan currently heads the Fundación Léon Cadogan, an organization that continues to advance the goals of Paraguay's Guaraní people.

The archipelago consists of 48 islands strategically located at the mouth of the Pearl River, a chokepoint on the communication lines to Hong Kong and Macau. The largest island is the Laurel Mountain (Guishan, 桂山) Island, which was formerly known as Trash Tail (Lajiwei, 垃圾尾) Island. Other major islands include Outer Linding (Wailinding, 外伶仃) Island, Dong'ao (东澳) Island, Tri-gate (Sanmen, 三门) Island, Greater Ten-thousand Mountain (Da Wanshan, 大万山) Island, Lesser Ten-thousand Mountain (Xiao Wanshan, 小万山) Island, Burden Pole (Dangan, 担杆) Islands, and Jianpeng (佳蓬) Islands. Prelude After Hainan Island had fallen into the communist hands, the nationalist 3rd Fleet withdrew to Wanshan Archipelago and together with the various nationalist units as the local garrison, the nationalists planned to blockade the mouth of the Pearl River and cutting off the maritime links between the mainland and Hong Kong and Macau. The nationalist naval commander-in-chief Gui Yongqing (桂永清) organized the Wanshan Defense Command, and named nationalist commander-in- chief of the 3rd Fleet Qi Hongzhang (齊鴻章) as the commander, who set up his headquarters on board the frigate Taihe (太和), the largest nationalist warship among more than three dozen nationalist naval vessels in the region, and the flagship of the nationalist 3rd Fleet. In response, the communist force decided to take the archipelago and eliminate the threat and crush the nationalist blockade of the mouth of the Pearl River. The communist deputy corps commander Hong Xuezhi (洪学智) was named as the commander of the Riverine Defense Force of the Cantonese Military Region to be in charge of the incoming operation, and the commander of force began to mass at Zhongshan on May 8, 1950 after a joint command headquarters was set up. Order of battle Nationalist order of battle Around 4,000, including: *1 Marine regiment *1 battalion from the 208th Division of the Youth Army *6 infantry companies of various units *Units of the Cantonese Assault Army *The 3rd Fleet **More than 30 naval vessels, later increased to more than 40. Communist order of battle Around 10,000 total, including: *2 regiments from the 131st Division of the 44th Army *1 Artillery battalion of the 132nd Division *1 Artillery company of the 130th Division *1 Artillery company of the South-central Military Region with 100 mm long range cannons *1 Artillery company from the 50th Army with recoilless guns *1 Artillery regiment of the Pearl River sub-Military Region *Riverine Defense Force of the Cantonese Military Region (naval force) **5 gunboats (including three respectively named Liberation, Vanguard, and Struggle) **1 Landing ship **10 Landing craft **8 Transports First stage The communist task force sailed to Wanshan Archipelago at the dawn of May 25, 1950. Shortly before dawn, the advance guard of the communist force in charge of fire support reached the nationalist anchorage at the Laurel Mountain (Guishan, 桂山) Island. The communist gunboat Liberation, a former nationalist gunboat named Dancing Phoenix defected to the communist side commanded by its former nationalist commander, Captain Lin Wenhu (林文虎), a brilliant naval officer, launched a surprise attack on the nationalist naval force at the anchorage under the cover of darkness. Fully aware that his 25-ton gunboat was completely incapable of sinking its large opponents each displaced over a thousand tons, Captain Lin skillfully ordered his crew to concentrate fire on the superstructures of larger nationalist ships. Nearly every nationalist large warship in the anchorage had its bridge struck, and the flagship, the frigate Taihe suffered the most: nearly everyone on the bridge was either killed or wounded, and Qi Hongzhang (齐鸿章), the nationalist commander-in-chief was severely wounded himself. With the commander-in-chief severely wounded and most of his staff killed, the nationalist command in charge of both land and naval defense was thus effectively paralyzed. The confined space of the anchorage severely limited the maneuverability of the nationalist warships for fearing collision in the darkness, and the communist gunboat was able to utilizing the blind spots of the larger nationalist naval guns by fighting at extremely close quarter when engaging the larger nationalist ships after sinking a nationalist gunboat. In the meantime, two other communist gunboats, Vanguard and Struggle, managed to sink two nationalist gunboats east of Ox Head (Niutou, 牛头) Island, while two battalions of the communist landing force took Green Islet (Qing Zhou,青洲) and Triangle (Sanjiao, 三角) Island. After the sunrise, the nationalist fleet discovered that there was only a single small communist gunboat fighting them, and as the enraged nationalist sailors attempted to avenge the deaths of their comrades-in-arms, every nationalist naval vessel available joined the chase of the communist 25-ton gunboat Liberation. However, unbeknown to the nationalist fleet, it was drawn to a temporary but carefully and skillfully designed trap devised by the communist gunboat captain, who was luring his opponent away from the islands, thus opening the way for the communist landing force. Once the nationalist fleet realized its mistake, it was too late: although the nationalist fleet managed to severely damage the communist landing ship Guishan (桂山) in the chase, the communist landing ship nonetheless successfully beached itself and unloaded all of the landing force it carried. The nationalist fleet was soon faced another dilemma: continue fighting the two communist naval vessels or saving the dying sailors, including the severely wounded commander-in-chief, who was out of consciousness by already this time. The loyal subordinates of the nationalist commander-in-chief chose not to let their commanding officer to die like many other wounded sailors, and speed away from the battlefield to seek better medical help in attempting to save those who were dying. Fearing additional communist naval units that may launch another round of attack, all other nationalist naval vessels retreated from the battlefield around an hour after the first shot was fired, protecting the wounded flagship from possible enemy attacks, thus enabling the 25-ton communist gunboat Liberation to safely return to its mainland base in a hero's welcome, but nationalist naval force nonetheless succeeded in killing the communist deputy political commissar of the flotilla on board the gunboat. Unfortunately for the nationalists, due to the chaos of the battle and the damage to the communication gears on board most of its naval vessels, the decision for the naval units to retreat from the battlefield to save the dying sailors and commanders was not relayed to nationalist force on the island, where the defenders interpreted such retreat as fleeing and abandoning them, and the morale of the land force collapsed as a result. In the meantime, the communist troops landed on the island believed the same and their morale was drastically boosted and their pressure on the defenders intensified. The demoralized nationalist defenders had managed to hold on their positions until the nightfall, and then asked and was allowed retreated from the island under the cover of darkness. Once the main anchorage of the Wanshan Archipelago, the Laurel Mountain (Guishan, 桂山) Island fell into the communist hands, many other islands fell in a domino effect. From May 25, 1950 thru May 28, 1950, Ox Head (Niutou, 牛头) island, Spider Islet (Zhi Zhou, 蜘洲), Dalu (大碌), Large Head Islet (Datou Zhou, 大头洲) and other small islets fell into the communist hands. Second stage On May 28, 1950, the nationalist naval force at the region was reinforced by 3 frigates, 2 landing ships, 4 minesweepers, and several gunboats newly arrived from Taiwan. The nationalist naval force cruised in waters north of Little Green Islet (Xiaoqingzhou, 小青洲) and Ox Head (Niutou, 牛头) island, attempted to bombard the communist positions on lands and the transport fleet. As the communist gunboats came out to meet them, the nationalist force still weary of previous naval engagement three days ago withdrew to open ocean, where the conditions favored the larger nationalist fleet because there was more space to maneuver. However, the communist gunboats did not pursue because the communists were fully aware their meek naval strength and once the mission of preventing the nationalist naval fleet from bombarding the communist assets was completed, the communists gunboats withdrew. Although the bombardment mission ended early and thus was not a success, the nationalists were quick to devise a plan based on the experience to counterattack by wiping out the communist naval force after luring it out to the open ocean, and then retake the islands from the communists who would not have any naval support of their own. However, the communists also learned from earlier experience and reached the conclusion of not to engaging the much stronger nationalist naval force in the open ocean where the condition favored the latter. In attempt to search the communists, a detachment of the nationalist fleet ventured too close to shore and three ships suffered damages from communist shore batteries on the Large Head Islet (Datou Zhou, 大头洲) and Triangle (Sanjiao, 三角) Island on May 30, 1950. The nationalists consequently changed their tactics by letting the communists come to them at the waters favored the nationalists, instead of going to the communist's turf to seek out the communists in the coastal regions that favored the communists. However, the communists had learned from the engagement as well and correctly deducted the nationalist objective, and thus made a plan of their own to counter that of the nationalist: instead of falling into the nationalist trap by fighting the way nationalists had wanted, the best way to engage the superior nationalist naval fleet was to utilize the long range shore batteries, and the much weaker naval force would act as auxiliary to the shore batteries. Third stage On June 5, 1950, the communist force adopted the leapfrog tactic under the cover of shore batteries on adjacent islands and islets close by, succeeding in taking Dong'ao (东澳) Island, Greater Ten-thousand Mountain (Da Wanshan, 大万山) Island, and Lesser Ten-thousand Mountain (Xiao Wanshan, 小万山) Island, forcing the nationalist to withdrew to Outer Linding (Wailinding, 外伶仃) Island, Burden Pole (Dangan, 担杆) Island and other outlying islands. On the night of June 26, 1950, the communists had secretly set up the long-range shore batteries on Tri-gate (Sanmen, 三门) Island under the cover of darkness, and the communist gunboats were also deployed accordingly. Unaware the communist's plan, the nationalist naval fleet carried out their original plan with the help of three more warships newly arrived from Taiwan, including destroyers. More than a dozen nationalist warships were deployed in waters near Outer Linding (Wailinding, 外伶仃) Island, Burden Pole (Dangan, 担杆) Islands, attempting to lure out the communist naval units. In the early morning of June 27, 1950, the hidden communist shore batteries suddenly opened up on the unsuspecting nationalist fleet, and defenders on the nationalist-held islands, the fierce fight lasted for more than five hours. After numerous extraordinarily brave but completely futile attempts to approach the shore to support the nationalist defenders on land which resulted in one gunboat sunk, one destroyer, two large patrol craft two minesweepers and two gunboats damaged, it was painfully clear that the outgunned nationalist fleet must withdraw to the open waters further away in order to avoid annihilation by the superior communist artillery on land. The communist's tactic of using numerically superior land artilleries with greater range than that of nationalist naval guns proved to be a great success and prevented any nationalist naval attempt to support their comrades-in-arms on lands. With the cover of superior firepower from the lands, the communist was able to deploy the leapfrog tactic to take the remaining islands in the nationalist hands. By July 1, 1950, the Outer Linding (Wailinding, 外伶仃) Island fell into the communist hands, and by August 3, 1950, Burden Pole (Dangan, 担杆) Islands also fell. On August 4, 1950, Direct Bay (Zhiwan, 直湾), Northern Sharp (Beijian, 北尖), and Temple Bay (Miaowan, 庙湾) and other islands fell into the communist hands. Finally, on August 7, 1950, the communist campaign to take the Wanshan Archipelago ended in total victory after taking the Mosquito Tail Islet (Wenwei Zhou, 蚊尾洲) Outcome The communist takeover of the Wanshan Archipelago eliminated the nationalist threat to its vital shipping lines to Hong Kong and Macau and crushed nationalist blockade of mouth of the Pearl River. The Wanshan Archipelago Campaign was the first combined army and naval operation for the communists and in addition to damaging and sinking nationalist ships, eleven nationalist ships were captured and they provided valuable local defense asset once they were completely repaired and returned to the active service in the communist fleet. One of the major contributor to the success was the correct tactics of not engaging the overwhelmingly superior opposing naval fleet, but instead, utilizing the numerically and technically superior shore batteries that the communists did enjoy to engage opposing naval targets that were outgunned. The largest island, the Trash Tail (Lajiwei, 垃圾尾) Island, was renamed Laurel Mountain (Guishan, 桂山) Island, in honor of the landing ship Laurel Mountain (Guishan, 桂山), the largest communist naval vessel participated in the conflict. The nationalist control of the Wanshan Archipelago was mostly symbolic for political propaganda and the battle for the control of the archipelago was destined to fail for the same simple reason just like the earlier Battle of Nan'ao Island: the location was just too far away from any friendly bases and thus it was difficult to support in war, and when the support was available, it was rather costly. Although the largest island provided a relatively good anchorage, there was just not enough land to build any comprehensive facilities and infrastructures to support a fleet. As a result, many of the repairs that could be done locally had the comprehensive facilities and infrastructures been available would require traveling back to the distant friendly bases, thus greatly increased cost. When a major damage occurred, tugs were needed to tow the damaged vessel, and in the event of war when tugs could not be available, the damaged vessels had to be abandoned. In contrast, the communists had comprehensive facilities and infrastructures on the mainland and since the archipelago at the communist's doorstep, they could simply recover the abandoned nationalist vessels and repair them after taking them back to the mainland, and put them back into service to fight against the former owners of these vessels, as the case of the eleven naval vessels abandoned by the nationalists after the battle. As for the blockade of the mouth of the Pearl River, it certainly caused difficulties for the communists. However, these difficulties could be overcome because there were and still are link between the mainland and Hong Kong, and Macau via land, and for the maritime traffic, the nationalist naval force could only cover the coastal region outside the effective range of the communist's land batteries and the communist could simply move a little deeper into the Pearl River to avoid the nationalist naval force. Though this did indeed increased the cost for the communist, the price tag for the operation of the naval task force performing this duty so far away from any support base was far greater comparatively speaking, because communist transportation was mostly by wooden junks that only required wind, while the modern nationalist navy required much more, such as fuel and maintenance supplies. Many nationalist strategist and naval commanders had pointed out this disadvantage and along with the geographically disadvantage (i.e. the lack of comprehensive facilities and infrastructures), wisely and correctly suggest to withdraw from the Wanshan Archipelago in order to strengthen the defense elsewhere, but their requests were denied because holding on something at the enemy's door step would have a significant symbolic meaning of great political propaganda value, but when the inevitable fall had finally occurred, the resulting disaster had negated any previous gains in political and psychological propaganda.

In \\"First Strike\\", Weir refers to Campbell's character as Chuck. Speaking at the Pegasus 2 convention in the UK, Campbell stated that he thought this was a mistake on Torri Higginson's part, but Martin Wood decided to keep the scene. The character continued to be called Chuck on-screen, but is given no surname. On the DVD commentary tracks, he has been referred to, jokingly, as \\"Chucknician\\", an amalgam of Chuck and technician. =Other roles= Campbell played Tsunaron in the Jason film Jason X. This last installment was made with a more tongue-in-cheek feel than the others, which was one of the factors which made Chuck consider the role.Interview from Crystal Lake Memories In an online interview, Chuck was asked the question: 'Why do you think the Friday the 13th movies have been a bigger hit than other thrillers featuring serial killers?' His response: \\"Interesting question! I think it might be the car accident syndrome, where sometimes you don't WANT to look, but you always end up turning your head to see what happens. They are so unrealistic and usually quite graphic with their violence, that it becomes almost silly, and you start to laugh and wonder how is the next person going to die.

Dendrochori is located approximately 10 km northwest of Kastoria and 6 km east of the center of the community Kastraki — the village Ieropigi. Dendrohori has 266 inhabitants (2011). History According to the narrative history, the village was founded by immigrants from villages Berik, Ano Sliveni (Gorno Sliveni), Saynovo, Vevi (Banitsa) and Agia Paraskevi (Sveta Petka).Дневник на костурския войвода Лазар Киселинчев, съставител Христофор Тзавелла, с. 312 In the book “Ethnographie des Vilayets d'Adrianople, de Monastir et de Salonique”, published in Constantinople in 1878, that reflects the statistics of the male population in 1873, Dëmbini was noted as a village with 280 households and 800 Bulgarians as inhabitants.„Македония и Одринско. Статистика на населението от 1873 г.“ Македонски научен институт, 1995. стр. 106-107. In the same year all of the inhabitants were Greek Orthodox and none of them had turned to the Bulgarian Exarchate. In 1886 the Greek school of Dymbeni was still operating. In 1905, all of its inhabitants turned to Bulgarian Exarchate.Georgios Lithoxoou, Kastoria villages Dendrohori was a Macedonian BulgarianReport of the International Commission to Inquire into the Causes and Conduct of the Balkan Wars, published by the Endowment Washington, D.C. 1914, p. 197 village of 1650 inhabitants at the beginning of the 20th century.Васил Кънчов. „Македония. Етнография и статистика“, 1900, с.265 (Kanchov, Vasil. Macedonia — ethnography and statistics Sofia, 1900, p. 265), Until 1878 the teaching in the local school was in Greek language. In 1878 Trpo Popovski from neighbour village Kosinec (Ieropigi) started to teach the local pupils the Bulgarian language.Поповски, Търпо. Македонски дневник,2006, с. 32 (Popovski, Trpo.

Paris, 1905, p.180-181. Subsequently, it was one of the first Slavic villages to revolt against the Ottoman Empire in the Ilinden Uprising of 1903, for which the Turkish army exacted heavy reprisals, killing many of the villagers and burning it to the ground. However a stand at the nearby Battle of Lokvata in which the villagers inflicted disproportionate casualties on a much larger Turkish force became a nationalist rallying point and served as the basis for a poem by Lazar Poptraykov. The village sided with Bulgaria during the Balkan Wars and the First World War, but became part of Greece following the First Balkan War. From the 1930s and especially 1940s many of its citizens became active in Macedonian separatist and Communist groups, the latter due to the Communists' advocacy on behalf of equal rights for ethnic minorities. The village sided with the National Liberation Front on the Communist side during the Greek Civil War, and was destroyed when the Communists lost the war. Most villagers were forced into exile, and the village was repopulated mainly with Vlach refugees from Epirus.

Plot  During a sing-along at Camp Hiawatha in 1981, two revelers sneak away to have sex, and are killed by an unseen assailant. Twenty-four years later, four friends (Angela, Jen, Mario, and Vade) are driving through the area on their way to Boston. The quartet becomes lost (passing the same sign several times) and their SUV breaks down after night comes unusually early. All the electronics fail to work, and the group is thrown into hysterics when screams emanate from the surrounding forest, and the vehicle is pelted with debris, prompting them to spend the night in it. In the morning, the travelers are found by campers and counselors from Hiawatha, and invited to stay at the camp, which looks like it has not changed since the 1980s. As the quartet is shown around (noticing how anachronistic the place is) someone murders any campers who go off on their own. That night, the killer rampages through the facilities, butchering everyone except the quartet. At dawn, the travelers awaken to discover that nothing appears to be wrong, and that everyone is alive again. Daniel and Ivan, a pair of counselors who are aware of what is going on, find the four, and explain that the camp is in a time loop, stuck repeating the day of the killing spree. To prove they are telling the truth, the counselors take the others to witness the first murder, a strangulation in the woods, which they have never been able to stop, despite their best efforts. The time- displaced four try to leave on their own, but the SUV will not appear until nightfall, and walking away just brings them back to Hiawatha. Daniel and Ivan state that they are limited in what they can do, but with the help of outsiders, they may be able to break the loop, and move on to whatever fate awaits them. The night of the massacre, it is revealed that Daniel and Ivan are the murderers, and that they manipulated Michelle and Ruben, a pair of outcasts, into helping them with their thrill killing. The psychopaths intend to have the travelers take their place in the cycle, which they believe they can achieve by murdering them, so they can get out. Mario and Vade die, but Angela and Jen manage to kill Daniel and Ivan. The girls go to the SUV, where Lou, the groundskeeper, is attacking Michelle and Ruben. Lou snaps Michelle's neck, and exposits that he took out the perpetrators of the original massacre minutes after it occurred. A wounded Ruben then shoots an arrow into Angela's chest, and is stomped to death by Lou as Jen escapes in the SUV. Three years later, Jen has become a successful writer, and while in her office one day, she receives an email.

A common form of the ritual uses repeated sexual stimulation (but not to physical orgasm) to place the individual in a state between full sleep and full wakefulness as well as exhaustion, allowing the practitioner to commune with their god. The rite Crowley first described the rite in a tract titled Eroto-Comatose Lucidity.Martin, Art, Messianism and Crime: A Study of Antinomianism in Modern Literature and Lives, 1986. The ritual as described by Crowley involves one \\"ritualist-seer\\" and several aides.Urban, Magia Sexualis: Sex, Magic, and Liberation in Modern Western Esotericism, 2006. Donald Michael Kraig advises that the more sexually experienced the aides are, the better the ritual works, and that the aides be members of the opposite sex. Religious scholar Hugh Urban, however, concludes that, for Crowley, aides of the same gender as the ritualist (e.g., homosexual activity) was the highest stage of practice of this ritual. In the first part of the ritual, the aides seek repeatedly both to arouse the ritualist sexually as well as to exhaust him. The ritualist is generally passive in this regard. There is disagreement over whether sexual arousal is enough, or sexual orgasm must be eventually accomplished. Crowley and others argue that orgasm must be avoided. Although later practitioners conclude that orgasm does not need to be avoided, that was how Crowley originally formulated the ritual. Most practitioners agree with Crowley that every means of arousal may be used, such as physical stimulation, genital stimulation, psychological stimulation, devices (such as sex toys), or drugs (an entheogen like hashish, marijuana, or other aphrodisiacs). There should be enough aides so that if one aide tires another may take his or her place. Eventually, the ritualist will tend to sink into sleep due to exhaustion. In the second part of the ritual, the aides seek to come close to awakening the ritualist through sexual stimulation alone. The goal is not to fully awaken her or him, but rather to bring them to the brink of wakefulness. Not all authors agree that the ritualist seer will be in a state between sleep and wakefulness, instead noting that exhaustion will lead to a trance, or \\"sleep of lucidity\\".See: Newcomb, Sexual Sorcery: A Complete Guide to Sex Magick, 2005, p. 71; Frater U.D., Secrets of Western Sex Magic: Magical Energy and Gnostic Trance, 2001, p. 130. The ritualist should be neither too tired or too uncomfortable to aid in the trance-like state. Once the ritualist reaches a near-waking state, sexual stimulation must stop. The ritualist-seer is then permitted to sink back toward (but not into) sleep. This step is repeated indefinitely until the ritualist reaches a state between sleep and wakefulness in which communing with a higher power may occur. Some say a goal during this time is to not become \\"lost\\" in the trance-like state, but to remain open without directing an outcome. The ritualist may also conduct spiritual work while in this state, or witness mystical events. Exhaustion may not be necessary for the ritualist who is \\"bodily pure,\\" Crowley writes. How the ritual ends The rite may end in one of two ways. The ritualist may simply sink into total sleep, or he or she may achieve orgasm and then sink into a deep and \\"undisturbable\\" sleep. Jason Newcomb, however, concludes that sexual exhaustion achieved through repeated orgasm may also lead to the ritualistic state and does not necessarily end the rite. Frater U. D., however, has argued that the orgasmic moment should not be lost and that the individual should strive to use the moment for spiritual or magical purposes. Upon awakening, the ritualist seer could, for example, write down everything he or she has experienced, witnessed, or been told. At least one author concludes that what is desired should be focused on throughout the rite, and that the individual should not be distracted from it or free of desire. Crowley also intended that when men do the ritual, any semen (or \\"elixir\\") produced by orgasm must be consumed by the ritualist, possibly in a Crowley inspired \\"Cake of Light\\". Ordo Templi Orientis practice of the ritual As practiced by Ordo Templi Orientis the rite is much simpler as well as a solo effort. In this version of the rite, a lone individual repeatedly masturbates to orgasm, visualizing the end sought.Martin, Orthodox Heresy: The Rise of \\"Magic\\" as Religion and Its Relation to Literature, 1989.Walker, Encyclopedia of Esoteric Man, 1977.Walker, Body Magic. 1979. Writer Benjamin Walker has argued that this is how the rite was taught by Crowley. Chaos magic practitioner Peter J. Carroll distinguishes such \\"autoerotic\\" rites with visualization from eroto-comatose lucidity.Carroll, Liber Null & Psychonaut, 1987. Similar rites A similar rite of sexual exhaustion described by Crowley leads not to spiritual communing but a sort of vampirism.Belanger, Vampires in Their Own Words: An Anthology of Vampire Voices, 2007. In this rite, the aides use only the mouth to sexually exhaust the ritualist, and the intent of the aides must not be to assist the ritualist but rather to transfer the ritualist's own magical strength to themselves. Crowley claimed that when the ritualist is pushed to the point of death from sexual exhaustion in this way, the ritualist's spirit is enslaved by the aides and his or her power transferred to the aides. Michael W. Ford has argued for alternative rites as well. His concept of Luciferianism incorporates Crowley's ideas about sexual exhaustion, but concludes that the ritualist's will is what sends the spirit forth to bond with higher power.Ford, Luciferian Witchcraft, 2005. Ford argues for two methods of attaining sexual exhaustion and ascension: \\"Via Lilith\\" and \\"Via Cain.\\" In the Lilith ritual, the room should be draped in crimson and black; music which inspires dark emotions, contains chanting, or contains horrific sounds should be played; and images of Lilith, Lilitu, and succubi should hang in the room. In the Cain ritual, both the room and ritualist should be adorned with fetishes of the Horned God and symbols of Cain, and Middle Eastern music should be played. History of the rite Aleister Crowley documented the ritual. However, Crowley may not have been the originator of the rite, and may have learned about it from a female student first. Other authors, however, have concluded that the rite can be traced back much earlier. Occult historian Allen H. Greenfield has observed that there was a deep interest in sexual magic and sex as a spiritual tool which began in the early-to-mid-19th century and built throughout the century. A number of spiritual sexual rites and practices were either allegedly rediscovered or created during this period. Crowley wrote in his work De Arte Magica that eroto-comatose lucidity is also called the \\"sleep of Siloam\\" and both Allen Greenfield and Newcomb note that this rite preceded Crowley.Greenfield, The Roots of Modern Magick: Glimpses of the Authentic Tradition From 1700-2000, An Anthology, 2006. They point out that Paschal Beverly Randolph (\\"arguably the single most important figure in the rise of modern sexual magic\\")Urban, Magia Sexualis: Sex, Magic, and Liberation in Modern Western Esotericism, 2006, p. xi. called this ritualistic state the \\"sleep of Sialam.\\"Newcomb, Sexual Sorcery: A Complete Guide to Sex Magick, 2005. Randolph first discussed the \\"sleep of Sialam\\" in his 1873 work Ravalette, but described it at the time as a once-in-a-century prophetic trance.Deveney, Paschal Beverly Randolph: A Nineteenth-Century Black American Spiritualist, Rosicrucian, and Sex Magician, 1997. In later writings, Randolph used the term as a more general form of clairvoyant sleep used to understand spiritual things. Helena Blavatsky may also have taught the technique, calling it the \\"Sleep of Siloam.\\" In her 1877 work Isis Unveiled, Blavatsky wrote that the trance must be induced through drugs rather than sexual exhaustion. Later, Blavatsky altered her understanding of the rite to mean that drug-induced trance-like state in which a new initiate first comprehends spiritual things. This was described in Blavatsky's 1888 work Secret Doctrine, and she taught that the ritualistic state allowed the individual to either commune with the gods, descend into hell, or perform spiritual acts. Blavatsky taught this was a deep sleep, but Newcomb notes that modern ritualists do not enter sleep but rather a state between sleep and wakefulness. On the other hand, sexual practices used for spiritual purposes are not new. Eastern traditions within taoism and tantrism also incorporated sexual rituals.Wile (1992)Bhattacharyya (1999) pp. 294, 296-7, 423-25. The rite's influence The rite and other sex magic practices have had a limited, marginal influence. Crowley's concepts have been seized on by a couple of bands Killing Joke and Psychic TV.Reynolds, The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion, and Rock 'n' Roll, 1996.

He has appeared in Logroño's previous television programs \\"Sunshine's Café\\" and \\"De Noche Con Sunshine\\", \\"Club Sunshine\\", and currently appears sporadically in \\"Sunshine Remix\\", a program aired on WAPA-TV, a station for which Logroño is vice president for talent affairs. Vitín also appears regularly on Agitando El Show, a late afternoon radio program on Cadena Salsoul, one of Puerto Rico's salsa radio networks. Biography Vitín Alicea is a resident of the coastal Puerto Nuevo barrio of Vega Baja, Puerto Rico. He is allegedly the first cousin (\\"primo coyunto\\") of Logroño's partner in the radio program \\"Agitando, El Show\\", Fernando Arévalo (and Arévalo follows the joke when pressed). Vitín owns a makeshift gymnasium in the backyard of his house, called \\"Musculus\\", which is merely a converted garage. Since he's not wealthy, his weightlifting equipment consists of portland cement molded inside cracker tin cans and linked by galvanized aluminum tubes, similar to what Fred Flintstone would use to lift weights. It also features a legendary garden hose, which Vitín dutifully uses to shower the inevitably all-male visitors to his gym (he constantly claimed his gym is the cleanest in town). He also has a makeshift ring in his gym, with rope and posts he purchased at a hardware store and foam he purchased at an upholstery store. Arevalo, Vitin's radio sidekick, usually complains about Vitín removing the doors from the urinals, to which Vitín simply replies that they are not needed. Vitín is depicted as doggedly persistent and successful in anything he puts his mind into, as long as things do not go wrong (when they do, a comic sketch is born). As a result of his blatant passes and manipulative character, however, there is no known sexual or romantic partner of Vitín's, male or female. This gives the impression that Vitín, as clever as he is, is a perennial loner. Personal life Whenever Vitín is not featured in a proper comedy sketch, he has a habit of receiving famous visitors to his establishments, in both his radio and his television shows. He once hosted a section on \\"Club Sunshine\\" called \\"Desde mi ring con Vitín\\" (\\"From My Ring With Vitín\\") to sketch these interviews, and used Queen's \\"We Will Rock You\\" (played by the program's house band) as a theme song. Inevitably the guest is a male, and Vitín typically hugs and pats (or even pets) him, which inevitably shocks the guest. He would progressively make flattering comments to his guests, which may turn to passes if the guest is not careful. However, one of Vitín's trade moves is to ask questions about the guest's personal likings and agree with whatever the guest says, even self- contradicting himself or his values if the guest says something that Vitín has not expected. For example, Vitín might go to the extreme of saying he hates wrestling if his male guest doesn't like the sport. Usually the interview ends with a blatant pass or physical gesture that embarrasses the guest (a typical one is Vitín standing up, turning around and pump up his muscles with his backside to the guest, flaunting his derriere to him). Usually guests play along until they cannot follow the joke any longer. A willing participant in the joke is Chayanne, who has visited Vitín twice. =Sexual orientation= Vitín is a hyper-macho misogynist (and very probably a closet homosexual, although this has never been proven) who openly derides homosexuals (a la Roy Cohn) but will discreetly make a pass to many a man who approaches him. Vitín does not spare a second to flaunt his masculinity to the point of self-parody. He is an extreme fan of professional wrestling, weightlifting and film. In actuality, Vitín has always complained of having a pot belly, although he claims to take good care of his \\"temple\\", his body (using Saint Paul's verbal analogy). This is actually said in jest, since Logroño occasionally makes jokes about being overweight when he is off character. =Despise of women= A traumatic event happened early in Vitín's life that explains his misogyny to some extent. He claimed that girls at his high school would make passes at him, and would ask him to dance with them on short notice as to have him demonstrate his dancing skills, something that he felt uneasy doing. These same girls persuaded him to decorate the high school's gymnasium for a school dance, only to not show up at the crucial hours before it. He reluctantly had to set up the entire gym alone (feeling that he had been tricked into doing the work alone), and had to endure the teasing of his male friends, who made fun of his \\"interior decorator\\" skills. Since then, Vitín openly despises women. He takes his misogyny to the extreme, to the point of telling almost all his guests and friends that women carry sexually transmitted diseases that they transmit to men, and that because of this, they cannot be trusted. Occasionally, when a woman arrived where Vitín was at, he would say in a loud voice \\"¡Infección a la vista!\\" (\\"Infection in sight!\\"), implying that any woman approaching him or other men was carrying an STD. He usually advised King Cabra to not get close to women, but at the end of each sketch, King Cabra never paid any attention and would leave with the lady. Vitín's attacks on women were harsher on the early days of the character, but Logroño has since toned down the character's criticism towards females. Development In early airings of the character, since Logroño was considerably thinner than he currently is, Vitín constantly wore a muscle shirt bearing one of Leonardo da Vinci's anatomic sketches that displayed a man's muscles. Logroño has since physically outgrown the shirt, and now wears other clothes, but tends to gravitate towards a skeleton shirt. He also wears a beret. Logroño over- modulates his voice when representing Vitín to make him sound like a radio announcer at times: Vitín speaks with a baritone voice, has perfect Spanish language diction (using Castilian phonemes at times, particularly a strong j sound that almost sounds like a \\"kh\\"), and constantly utters a \\"Hmm?\\" to punctuate most sentences, which he sometimes enunciates as questions. He calls those males that he likes \\"Papa\\", a term that has become a comical verbal jab in Puerto Rico against any male who shows his masculinity in public in a blatant way. (\\"Papa\\" is actually a term used by natives of the United States Virgin Islands to refer to Puerto Ricans) Vitín's Q&A; Sometimes Vitín recites a long exchange of questions and answers that has become an audience favorite. He may either expect the responses from either his guest (which may or may not be familiar with the exchange) or his studio audience (who usually do know it by heart; as the audience is not supposed to participate in programs Vitín claims the next-door neighbors are the ones who respond) The exchange goes like this: \\"Mi manguera es tu manguera / ¿Con la fría o la caliente? / ¿Y cómo hay que estar? / ¡Ahí! / El buffet... / ...está servido / ¿Te lo agrando? / A 30... / Mangueras unidas... / ...jamas serán vencidas / Ah... / ¡qué rico! / ¡La Marina... / ...fuera de Vieques! / Machos... / ¡AHI! (the last two repeated at least three times) This roughly translates to: \\"My garden hose is your garden hose... / Do you fancy cold or hot (water)? / And where are we supposed to be? / Right there! / Buffet... / ...is served! / You want a bigger combo? / (Large size, costing) 30 (cents)... / Hoses united... / ...will never be defeated! / Ah... / how delicious! / The United States Navy... / ...out of Vieques!* / (Where are the) Machos...(?) / HERE! (the last two repeated at least three times) The exchange was assembled little by little over the years, and can be explained this way: * \\"Mi manguera es tu manguera\\" is supposedly Vitín's term of endearment to someone he likes, a double entendre parody of the common Spanish phrase: \\"Mi casa es su casa\\". The option of hot or cold water was supposedly the options available to anyone who showers with Vitín's legendary garden hose. * Exchanges that have \\"¡Ahi!\\" as a response are based on the typical chants of labor protesters on strike in Puerto Rico * \\"Buffet is served\\" is a veiled reference to a potential male gay orgy * The reference to 30 cents is taken from typical fast-food menus, which the consumer can \\"biggie size\\" after paying, stereotypically, 30 cents * \\"Hoses united...\\" is a parody on the usual Latin American chant of leftist protestors, \\"El pueblo, unido, jamás será vencido!\\" (\\"A people united will never be defeated\\", which rhymes in Spanish) * The Navy reference referred to the common plea of Puerto Ricans to have the United States Navy vacate their military activities in the island of Vieques. Since the Navy left Vieques, this part of the rant has been removed from the exchange. * \\"¡Ah, qué rico!\\" comes from a sound bite uttered once by Donato, of the Miami-based Latino music duo Donato y Estéfano. Donato was pleasantly surprised by the screaming women in his audience in one of Logroño's television shows, but since the duo was reportedly ambiguous sexually, the quote was often played whenever Vitín wanted to make fun of anything remotely sexual in his sketch. Singing career Vitín has recorded various songs, some of which have become cultural references. He remade Marisol Calero's song \\"Duendes de la noche\\" (\\"Elves of the Night\\") and turned into \\"Hombres en la Noche\\" (\\"Men In The Night\\"), a song where he longs for male company and plays homage to Puerto Rican wrestling hero Carlitos Colón (who once had the song sung to him in a Vitín episode and only provided a deadpan stare as a response). The song has since become an unofficial party anthem, and has been remixed at least once. It was sung once by Danny Rivera on a memorable Vitín episode. Vitín also recorded \\"El Mejor Regalo\\" (\\"The Best Gift\\"), in which he asks his mother to give him videotapes of wrestling matches as a Christmas gift. He later recorded a bachata, \\"¿Pa' qué rayos la mujer?\\" (\\"Why in hell are there any women?\\"), in which he equaled women to trouble. Relationship with wrestling Vitín has been a patron of sorts for professional wrestling in Puerto Rico. He is reportedly the biggest fan of Carlitos Colón, who has played along with the joke, sometimes reluctantly (see above) Vitín has intervened in wrestling matches, and has even been physically attacked by the occasional wrestling heel in television interviews featuring wrestlers. The whole concept of Vitín owning a gym on the first place was supposedly an excuse to have potential wrestlers train at his house, where he could manipulate them psychologically. He called himself a \\"Ternerito Trainer\\" (\\"Ternerito\\" meaning a male calf), for he fancied candidates in the youngish side. Most candidates either fled the place immediately or did pay their cheap dues given the rudimentary quality of the gym's equipment. Two of them deserve mention, since they became Vitín's protegés. Sidekicks =King Cabra= King Cabra was played by Puerto Rican cuatro musician Pedro Guzmán, who was a regular player in the Sunshine's Café house band. King Cabra was a rather naive gym member who sincerely befriended Vitín and did not understand his sexual advances. He did wonder why Vitín would all of a sudden lecture him about STD's, emphasizing the role of women as vectors. At times Vitín would get into trouble, and King Cabra would save him from a thrashing due to his excellent wrestling skills. However, given Vitín's strict celibacy requirements as a pre-requisite for training, King Cabra eloped with Kenya, the Haitian fire-eater at the Gurabo, Puerto Rico Patron Saint feasts. This caused Vitín considerable strife, since he considered King to be his \\"hermano putativo\\" (\\"putative brother\\", a phrase Logroño uses as a comic device, since \\"puta\\" is the vulgar Spanish term for a prostitute) Guzmán's affable character, high pitched voice and short height helped give the character a likable quality, and therefore King Cabra became an audience favorite, getting standing ovations from the program's audience whenever he appeared. When Guzmán left the program to pursue his solo career, the character ended with his departure. =Culebro Mendoza= Culebro Mendoza is Vitín's current sidekick, and is played by Jesús Muñoz, a production assistant of Logroño's turned comedian. Culebro first appeared as an extra in the video for the Vitín song \\"¿Pa' qué rayos la mujer?\\" (see above), where he sang background and wiggled in a \\"snake dance\\" along with the music. The snake (\\"culebra\\" in Spanish) dancer caught the public's attention, and Logroño incorporated him into Vitin's sketches. Culebro is heterosexual (as was King Cabra). He was portrayed originally as an illegal immigrant from the Cibao region of the Dominican Republic that needed immigration papers once he arrived to Puerto Rico, and Vitín provided these. Under protests from the Dominican community in Puerto Rico the story was revisited to portray Culebro as a native of Trinidad and Tobago that spent various years serving as a sailor for a ship based in the Dominican Republic and who learned Spanish with a heavy \\"cibaeño\\" accent. Since reaching Puerto Rico, Culebro has (either naively or because of necessity) remained in Vitín's \\"stable\\" through the years, serving as a janitor at the Musculus gym. Due to his rather spartan living conditions and schedule, Culebro longs for female company, to which Vitín vehemently objects. Culebro displayed his talents for singing bachata in an episode, and audience reaction was positive enough to deserve a recording, a CD album named \\"Culebro Legal\\". Two minor hits from this album were the reggaeton/plena fusion song \\"Seaca Bós\\"(see video) (the stereotypical Cibaeño pronunciation for \\"Se acabó\\", or \\"It's Over\\") and \\"Los deítos 'e los pies\\" (\\"The toes\\"), in which Culebro describes his likings for a lover's toes as a fetish. Both were minor Christmas hits in Puerto Rico in 2004, and \\"Seaca Bós\\" has been used as a wrestling theme song. Vitín has since become Culebro's agent, charging him an 80% fee for managing his career, which ensures Culebro's reluctant involuntary servitude at Vitín's gym for years to come. Yuca Vitín e Indio Nando For a while in their afternoon radio program, Logroño and Arévalo featured a comedy sketch, \\"Yuca Vitín e Indio Nando\\", in which they parodied Native American stereotypes prevalent in old American television series, but using local Puerto Rican references instead. Many of these programs portrayed \\"indians\\" as speaking broken English which, translated into Spanish, made no grammatical sense. Since many of these programs were dubbed in Mexico, Arévalo played his Indio Nando character speaking with a Mexican accent, in a way similar to the dubbed Spanish version of Baba Looey (called \\"Pepe Luis\\" in Spanish) shown in local television airings of Quick Draw McGraw cartoons. Very often Yuca Vitín would joke about how stupid the stereotypes were and how silly would the script to the section be. Yuca Vitín and Indio Nando had a rather constant routine: they opened telephone lines to ask listeners to suggest a public Puerto Rican personality annoying enough to be either scalped or flogged. Since their time reference frame was 1493 (the year when Puerto Rico was \\"discovered\\" by Christopher Columbus' naval crews), they answered \\"the spirits talking over the magic stone\\" (i.e. the voice at the speaker phone) very reverently. Once the audience agreed on a candidate, Yuca Vitín and Indio Nando would simulate a hunt for the character, complete with jungle sound effects, a verbal description of the celebrity using archaic language references (i.e., a celebrity with breast implants would be called \\"She Who Has Basketballs in Her Chest\\") screams of the reportedly captured celebrity while being tortured, and perhaps an unexpected comic reaction (like, for example, should the celebrity wear a wig, having him or her flee the scene while Yuca Vitín held over his or her wig). The Yuca Vitín and Indio Nando sketches are rarely performed today, but they are revived occasionally, even on the occasional television show. Controversies =Name= Vitín Alicea is commonly named Vitín and not Victor since there is already another actor and comedian named Víctor Alicea. There was speculation that the character's name was a jab at Alicea but this was disproved when Guille and Vitín had a dance duel on an episode of Sunshine's Café. =Portrayal of homosexuality= According to Logroño, Vitín Alicea attempts to portray an alternate view of homosexuality that is not necessarily well understood elsewhere. Instead of the effeminate stereotypical characters that are commonplace in Latin American comedy, Vitín's hyper-macho stance was shocking to many during the character's early run. Gay activists in Puerto Rico have attacked Vitín as being an even worse creation than the stereotype. Logroño counters saying that, during a visit to a public school, some students approached him and told him their physical education teacher made passes similar to Vitín's; by this he implied that the character was merely a humorous take on something that naturally occurs in Puerto Rican society.

The three other sports that can be enjoyed through the parent club are Cricket, Squash and Tennis. Grange Hockey Club, originally Edinburgh Northern Hockey Club, was formed in April 1905 and was one of the early hockey clubs in Scotland. The club first started playing at Raeburn Place in 1928 and changed its name to Grange Hockey Club in 1972. With 8 men's teams, 4 ladies teams, veterans and active youth section the Grange Hockey Club is one of the largest in Scotland. The Grange Hockey Club recently celebrated its centenary year, celebrating the 100th year of hockey being played under the Grange name since Edinburgh Northern Hockey Club amalgamated with Grange cricket club to form the modern hockey section of the club. The Grange home kit is white shirts with blue shorts and blue socks.  The Men's Teams  The 1st XI is one of the best sides in the country and regularly supplies players to the Scotland national side. They are the current Scottish League Champions. Scottish Cup Winners, and EuroHockey Trophy Champions. The 1st XI have won the Scottish Cup twice in a row in 2014 and 2015 and most recently in 2018. Playing in the national 1st divisions, the team continue to enjoy great success, both domestically and in European competition. Grange 2nd XI Grange 3rd XI Grange 2nd XI are usually frontrunners in Regional Central League 1, the highest division in which a club 2nd XI are permitted to play by the sport’s governing body. This team provides an excellent platform for young talent in the club to flourish before entering the top level in Scottish Hockey. Grange 3rd XI play in Regional Central League 1 as well. The 3s team is an experienced side with many 'Scottish Masters' representative. They hope to remain competitive in this division giving the Grange 2's and other second teams a run for their money. Grange Development team(s) were established to allow younger players the opportunity to become involved in men’s senior hockey under the guidance of a host of more experienced, high calibre and ex- international players. Grange Development team have been a permanent fixture of East District League 1 for a number of years. Grange 5, 7 and 8th XIs play in East District Leagues 1, 2 and 4 respectively, acting as a development base for new or inexperienced players, and providing an opportunity for those that seek more enjoyment than competitive edge from their hockey. In addition, Grange Hockey Club has an Youth section Under 18 membership of some 160 youngsters between the ages of nine and fifteen, both boys and girls, fielding teams at U18, U16, U14 and U12. Grange Under 16 teams compete in National Leagues while the Under 14 teams take part in a local League for that age group. In recent years Grange have had representatives in the Scotland Boys Under 18 and Scotland Boys and Girls Under 16 Squads, in addition to several representatives in District Squads at both age groups.  Grange Edinburgh Ladies  There are four teams and indoor teams.  Training  Training takes place at St George's School Training for men at all skill levels takes place every Tuesday at St George's Girls School from 7pm till 9pm and is coached by 2 skilled and experienced club members. Training for the men's 1st and 2nd XI takes place at Fettes College pitches on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7pm till 9pm and is a professional set up with three coaches to develop the elite in the club.  Social aspects  The club has a thriving social scene, with a unique clubhouse in the centre of Edinburgh. Most Saturdays it is filled with players, officials and spectators enjoying after match teas.

Casimir-Ney, (1801 – 3 February 1877, in Arras) was a French composer and one of the foremost violists of the 19th century. History During the mid-19th century, Escoffier was highly active as a performer, primarily in string quartets; he was a member of the Quatour Alard-ChevillardStowell, Robin: \\"From Chamber to Concert Hall, France and Belgium\\", The Cambridge Companion to the String Quartet, page 52. Cambridge University Press, 2003. and Société Alard et Franchomme, performing with violinist Jean-Delphin Alard and cellists Auguste Franchomme and Alexandre Chevillard (1811–1877). He was active in Parisian salons and the Société académique des enfants d'Apollon, of which he was president in 1853. He achieved virtually universal critical acclaim as a performer, with special praise for his smooth, broad viola sound. He devoted his efforts almost exclusively to the viola, in contrast to the majority of his contemporaries who went back and forth between the viola and violin. His biography was a mystery until the musicologist Jeffrey Cooper discovered an 1877 obituary of the successful Parisian violist Louis-Casimir Escoffier, who had died aged 75. Escoffier most likely took the Ney part of his pseudonym from Napoleon's marshal Michel Ney. Obituary An obituary from 11 February 1877 edition of Revue et Gazette Musicale de Paris, \\"Nouvelles diverses,\\" page 47, reveals the identity of Casimir Ney. ;Original text: :Un artiste qui a tenu une place des plus honorables dans le monde musical parisien, Louis- Casimir Escoffier, dit Casimir Ney, est mort à Arras, le 3 février, dans sa soixante-seizième année. Casimir Ney était connu pour son remarquable talent sur l'alto; pendant de longues années, il fit partie de nos meilleures sociétés de quatuors, et donna même chez lui des séances périodiques de musique de chambre, qui furent toujours fort recherchées. ;Translation: :An artist who has held a most honorable place in the music world of Paris, Louis- Casimir Escoffier, known as Casimir Ney, died at Arras, February 3, in his seventy-sixth year. Casimir Ney was known for his remarkable talent on the viola; for many years he was a member of some of our best quartets, and even presented periodic chamber music concerts in his home, which were always excellent. Compositions Casimir Ney is most famous for his book of 24 preludes for solo viola, which are extremely difficult to play. He also wrote a trio, a quartet and a string quintet, as well as Eighteen Caprices for Violin on the G-string, and a few works for viola and piano. He also did many transcriptions. The 24 Préludes for viola, published in Paris around 1849, are without a doubt the most ambitious attempt in the 19th century to demonstrate the technical possibilities of the viola. The preludes are designed around the 24 keys, are not really preludes in the traditional sense. They are not introductions to anything else. The choice of terminology, \\"prelude\\" is used to convey a sense of liberty. Unlike etudes, these pieces are meant to be more than just tools for study. The preludes are not arranged in order of difficulty and do not necessarily each focus on a specific technical point. The technical demands made on the player are in some places unbelievable. For example, the interval of the 12th in the Prélude No. 7 is just short of half the string length and is impossible to play except on a small viola with very big hands. Some of the other difficult techniques asked of the performer are many double stops, double harmonics, left hand pizzicato, 4 finger pizzicato, and the exploration of the full functional range of the instrument. ;Original compositions * Grand Trio for violin, viola and cello (before 1845) * 1er Quadrille brillant for flute or viola and piano (1842) * Quadrille \\"La petite Marie\\" for flute, viola, flageolet, cornet and piano (1842) * Quadrille \\"Le Baroque\\" for flute, viola, flageolet, cornet and piano (1842) * Quadrille for piano * Fantaisie brillante for viola and piano, Op. 12 * 1er Quatour (Quartet No. 1) in E minor for 2 violins, viola and cello, Op. 20 (c.1850) * 24 Préludes pour l'alto viola dans les 24 tons de la gamme, composés et dédiés aux artistes (24 Preludes in All Keys for Viola, Composed for and Dedicated to Artists), Op. 22 (published c.1849–1853) * 1er Quintette (Quintet No. 1) for 2 violins, viola, cello and double bass, Op. 24 (1850–1855) * Fantaisie sur la Sicilienne de A.

Previous MP  The seat had become vacant on when the constituency's Labour Member of Parliament (MP), Sir James Melville, had died on 1 May, aged 46. He been Gateshead's MP since the 1929 general election, and had been Solicitor-General from 1929 to 1930.  Candidates  The Conservative Party candidate was Cuthbert Headlam, who had been MP for Barnard Castle from 1924 until his defeat in 1929. Labour selected Herbert Evans, who had stood unsuccessfully at the 1929 election in the Maldon constituency in Essex. In 1929, there had been both a Liberal and an independent candidate in Gateshead, but the by-election was a two-way contest between Labour and Conservative.  Results  The result was a narrow victory for Evans. His 51.6% share of the votes was only a small fall from his predecessor's result in 1929, but Headlam picked up the votes which had previously gone to Liberal and independent candidates, and cut the Labour majority from a safe 31.1% to a precarious 3.2%. However, Evans did not live to defend the seat; he died on 7 October 1931, the day on which Parliament was dissolved for the 1931 general election. The Gateshead seat was then won by the National Liberal Party candidate, Thomas Magnay, and Headlam was re-elected in Barnard Castle.

The premises which they have identified as appropriate to their needs is the Listed B Cell Block adjacent to the Centre for Sensory Impairment in Partick, Glasgow, Scotland. The justification for setting up this project is based on two recent areas of research. Firstly, there was research carried out by RNIB \\"Beyond the Stereotypes\\" which stated that 83% of visibly impaired people of employable age were excluded from the employment field. Secondly, a consultation was undertaken by Gary Dover, GCC, PSSM. The report was titled “Equal Access to Employment” it was formally launched at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow on the 27th May 2004. Within this report there proved to be considerable correlative information with the findings of the RNIB research. The management committee consists of visually impaired individuals who have experience of the limited choice in training and learning opportunities, and are acutely aware of the attitude of potential employers. With a project like SITE in place that will work with visually impaired person there will be opportunities to change employers perspectives and create employment pathways for the visually impaired in Glasgow and the West of Scotland.

Life and career Born in Katowice, Poland, Majewski studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. In the 1970s, he then studied at the National Film School in Łódź, notably as a student of Wojciech Has, who taught Majewski directing. In the early 80s, after completing The Knight and as martial law was declared in Poland, Majewski emigrated to England and then to the United States, where he lived for most of the late Communist era. Majewski is a dual U.S.-Polish citizen, and travels often between those and other countries. He is a member of the American and European film academies and the Polish International PEN. Majewski speaks fluent, and excellent, English, but often works with English- speaking natives on his script. That was the initial role that Julian Schnabel had on Basquiat, before Majewski abandoned the project and Schnabel took it over. In 2006, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City hosted a retrospective of Majewski's work. This was their first ever full retrospective of a Polish filmmaker, and one of their only ever mid-career retrospectives. For that program, Majewski created the film eventually called Glass Lips, though initially it was known as Blood of a Poet.

The building was first mentioned in writing in an edict issued in 1645. The house changed owners several times during the 17th and 18th centuries, and after major fires in the 18th century, it underwent a reconstruction and the third floor was built. In the late 19th century, Kazimierz Sztral renovated the building in a Neo-Renaissance style after a project by a Russian architect Alexiey Polozov. The second floor has decorative sculptures symbolizing agriculture and fishing. The third floor acquired two male busts. Mr. Sztral opened the famous \\"Biały Sztral\\" () café, which operated until 1939. The cafe was named \\"White Sztral\\" (or \\"Sztrall\\") to distinguish it from four other cafes owned by Kazimierz Sztrall, including \\"Zielony Sztral\\" (Green) and \\"Czerwony Sztral\\" (Red). The cafe, frequented by local high society, was immortalised by Konstanty Ildefons Gałczyński in his Vilnian Elegies. Although closed down following the Lithuanian takeover of the city, it was soon reopened and housed the \\"Ksantypa\\" cabaret run by artists who fled from Nazi- occupied part of Poland, among them Janusz Minkiewicz, Mieczysław Szpakiewicz, Stanisława Perzanowska, Marta Mirska and Światopełk Karpiński. As such it operated until the second Soviet occupation. The cafe was re-opened in 2000. Prior to 1918, the upper floors were used for rentals. The Lithuanian Relief Committee operated out of the building during World War I. In one of the Committee's offices on the third floor, on February 16, 1918, the twenty members of the Council of Lithuania signed the Act of Independence of Lithuania, reestablishing Lithuania's independence. Afterwards the house was adapted to the needs of various Lithuanian organizations, as well as continuing to serve as a residence. Soon after Lithuania regained independence in 1990 from the Soviet Union, the house was dedicated as a museum, and opened to the public in 2000. Since 2003 the museum has been a branch of the National Museum of Lithuania. Annual commemoration ceremonies of the independence are held in the House of the Signatories on February 16.

It was built in the late twelfth century and probably replaced the motte and bailey castle a few hundred metres away. History The castle was signed to Walter Heckelutel, as a Licence of the Crenellate, by King Edward I of England on 24 November 1284. This licence to crenellate was thought of as a way for central authority to exert power over the lords, although this is not confirmed. It is also suggested however, that the castle dates back to 1093 when the Normans invaded South Wales. Aberedw is more famously known to be the residence of Llewelyn ap Gruffydd. This man is very well known as the last native Prince of Wales. Aberedw was the last retreat Llewelyn made before he was killed and beheaded by Adam Francton, who then had his head sent to the King of England, in 1282. Description It was a rectangular stone castle with circular towers in diameter at the angles, surrounded by a moat approximately wide. It stands to the east of the River Wye floodplain and remains of the moat are visible on the other three sides. It was entered via a causeway across the ditch on the east side and there are some signs of internal buildings. The eastern towers show some signs of latrine chutes. Today it is a ruin, as most of the west side was destroyed by railway construction in the 19th century. Many stones from the castle were used in the construction of the foundations of the track. The ruins are in poor shape and there is active erosion that is damaging the site.

History Blame Game's initial work is comparable to other bands of the hardcore punk genre, such as Rorschach, His Hero Is Gone, Angel Hair, and Assfactor 4. In 1999, shortly after their forming, Matt McCalvin decided to switch to second guitar, and Chris Ware was brought in on bass. The band played its first official show in 1999 under the name Blame Game (they had performed several times before this under different names) at the Prison Issues Fest, which was organized by Chris Ware at the Under the Couch venue on the Georgia Tech campus. Blame Game then recorded their self-titled demo (recorded on ADAT by Alex Lambert) and it was released on cassette in a limited run of 100 copies. The tape was packaged in a brown paper lunch bag, and it was covered with a sticker of a photograph by artist Kim Hoeckle. Throughout 2000, the band played many shows in and around the south. In 2001 the band went on a mini-tour with Countdown to Putsch in Florida and Georgia. Following the tour, Blame Game recorded 9 songs at the C-11 warehouse with Brooks Meeks (of the Atlanta band The Close). The 9 songs were put on a tour CD-R, and 4 of these tracks were released as a self-titled seven-inch by both Ex-Space Six and Stickfigure Records. 500 of these were printed, and almost every cover was different due to the covers being divided 125 per member of the band and then hand made. Following these initial recordings, Blame Game played small tours and local shows between 2001–2002. Between this time the band began to draw a larger influence from avant-garde performers and bands, such as Captain Beefheart and U.S. Maple, as well as from free jazz performers like Peter Brotzman, Ornette Coleman and Albert Ayler, shifting the band's sound from hardcore punk, to a more wiry, spastic and “improv” oriented sound. In 2002, the band performed on the WREK radio show Live at WREK, playing 12 songs (many of which displayed their newer style) and followed it with a second set which was entirely improvised. In January 2003, the band self-released the Blame Game Trio CD-R, which was recorded by Alex Lambert, and contained entirely improvised material. Later that same year, the band recorded 8 songs at The Living Room Studio (formerly Red Lab Studios) in Atlanta, Ga with recording engineer Ed Rawls. These 8 songs were released on the b-side of a split LP (released by Adagio 830/660 Productions in Europe and Crab Apocalypse in the U.S.) with the German band Zann. Blame Game toured Europe for 3 weeks and the U.S. for 2½ weeks with Zann to support this release. In late 2003 the band recorded 6 new songs, which would top off a 77-minute 27-track cd anthology released by Stickfigure Records. Guitarist Matt McCalvin left the band in December 2003 over musical differences, turning his focus to his new band, Gongfodder. McCalvin would later join the band A-Fir-Ju-Well (now named Gringo Star). George Asimakos (formerly of Camaro Crotch) was brought in to play second guitar after Matt’s departure. Blame Game attempted to do a 6-week U.S. tour in the summer of 2004 after writing new material with Asimakos, but only played a handful of these shows due to vehicle malfunction. In the winter of 2004, the band completed the writing of the Honey and Salt full length, and embarked on an East Coast tour. In January 2005 guitarist Ian Deaton left the band due to personal conflicts and went on to form the band God’s America (2005–2006). Reduced to a three-piece outfit, Blame Game then recorded their first official full length entitled “Honey and Salt” in February 2005 at Zero Return Studios, and it was released by Stickfigure Records on cd and ABC Group Documentation on LP (which contained less tracks due to time constraints). They soon embarked on one US tour, during spring break of 2005, accompanied by their friend Andrew Wiggins. This found them playing shows with Des Ark and Del Cielo. Immediately afterwards, Wiggins was recruited as second guitarist, returning the lineup to include four members. With the full length out, the band embarked on several east coast and midwest tours including a stint opening for Do Make Say Think In late 2005/early 2006 the band finished writing new material, which would be recorded at Zero Return Studios in February 2006. This album was released on LP July 2006 (it contained a CD-R of the album inside the packaging) by Stickfigure Records and Ursa Minor Musik. The CD contained 3 songs by Blame Game, and one soundscape by Magicicada (composed of sounds recorded by Blame Game during practice) totalling around 30 minutes of play. In summer 2006 the band went on a large US tour with Finnish band Echo Is Your Love. Following this tour, drummer Alex Lambert decided to move to New York City, putting the band on an indefinite hiatus. Blame Game played their last known show on January 25, 2007 at the Drunken Unicorn in Atlanta, Ga. The following was left on their website immediately following their last show: January 26, 2007 - We played our last show for quite some time last night. Thanks to all who were a part of it. We are officially on indefinite hiatus. We haven't ruled out playing again but logistically it's not easy anymore with members living in different cities. Still if you have a show or tour opportunity, let us know. We'll consider everything.  Discography  *S/T Demo (Recorded 1999 by Alex Lambert, 100 copies made, self-released, out of print.

He was president of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts from his appointment by Pope Benedict XVI on 15 February 2007 until his resignation was accepted by Pope Francis on 7 April 2018. He spent his early years in the Archdiocese of Milan and became an auxiliary bishop in 1993. He moved to the Roman Curia in 2000. Biography =Early life= Coccopalmerio was born in San Giuliano Milanese, Italy, where his parents were living during World War II, on 6 March 1938 and raised in Sernio, his mother's home town. He was ordained a priest on 28 June 1962 by Giovanni Montini (later Pope Paul VI), then the archbishop of Milan. He received a licentiate in theology in 1963. He received a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical Gregorian University in 1968. In 1976 he obtained a doctorate in law at the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan. =Archdiocese of Milan= He held positions in the archdiocese of Milan until 1994. He was professor of canon law at the Faculty of Theology in northern Italy from 1966 to 1999. Since 1981, he has been a professor of canon law at the Pontifical Gregorian University. On 10 April 1993, Pope John Paul II appointed Coccopalmerio an auxiliary bishop of Milan with the titular see of Coeliana. He was consecrated bishop on 22 May of that year. Within the Italian Episcopal Conference, he is one of the leading voices on legal issues and ecumenical and inter-religious dialogue. Since 2000, Coccopalmerio has been a member of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura. =Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts= On 15 February 2007, he was given the personal title of archbishop and appointed president of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts. Since 2008, at the direction of Pope Benedict, one of his principal responsibilities has been the revision to procedures for handling clergy sex abuse and the applicable punishments. In 2014, he explained: \\"We want to make this delicate material more accessible, more understandable and easier for bishops to apply.\\" At issue is \\"Book VI: Sanctions in the Church\\". Coccopalmerio was reported to have been one of the senior cardinals who, in preparing to announce the lifting of the excommunications of four leaders of the Society of Saint Pius X in January 2009, failed to take account of recent reports that one of them, Bishop Richard Williamson, was a Holocaust denier. He was appointed a five-year renewable term as a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith on 23 December 2010. On 18 February 2012, Pope Benedict XVI created him cardinal-deacon of San Giuseppe dei Falegnami. On 21 April 2012, Cardinal Coccopalmerio was named a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Apostolic Signatura, and the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity. On 22 December 2012, he was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. He can hold these memberships until his 80th birthday. At the Synod of Bishops on New Evangelization in October 2012, Coccopalmerio argued that ecumenical efforts to further unify Christians across sectarian lines could play a pivotal role in countering the ongoing \\"de-Christianization\\" of Europe by presenting \\"an extraordinary sign to Islam\\" of Christian solidarity. =2013 Papal Conclave= In the meetings of cardinals that preceded the papal conclave of March 2013, Cardinal Coccopalmerio proposed to create a moderator of the Curia, a prelate who would identify inconsistencies and devise methods of ensuring consistency among departments of the Roman Curia that sometimes contradict one another. The idea was widely appreciated by some cardinals but some were wary that such an appointment would act as a \\"vice-pope\\" that would effectively set Vatican and Curial policy or duplicate the already considerable authority of the Substitute in the Secretariate of State, who already fills the role of the Pope's \\"chief of staff\\". In advance of that conclave, he said: \\"It's time to look outside Italy and Europe, in particular considering Latin America.\\" He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2013 papal conclave that elected Pope Francis, and was mentioned in the Italian press as a possible pope. According to one report, he received more votes in the conclave than any other Italian cardinal because of his proposal for reform of the Roman Curia. =Synod on the Family= On 27 August 2014, Pope Francis named him to a working group tasked with speeding up the process for assessing the nullity of a marriage. Its work resulted in changes implemented by Francis in September 2015, which eliminated obligatory appeals, eased the dismissal of appeals in certain instances, and instituted a shorter process in some cases. Following the first session of the Synod on the Family held in October 2014, he expressed disappointment that not all the participants addressed the pastoral needs of those \\"who are suffering through problems connected to their relationships\\" and instead \\"showed that they simply wanted to reaffirm the doctrine\\". He provided an example: He also endorsed the idea of access to the Eucharist for some Catholics in irregular marital situations. He offered the example of a woman who lives with a man who has three small children by a wife who abandoned him. He imagined her coming to Communion \\"during her father’s funeral Mass, or the day of one of the children’s confirmation\\". Fearing the consequences of asking her to abandon the man and the children, he asked: \\"So would it really be totally impossible to admit her to communion? In admitting her to communion, would I be going against the doctrine of the indissolubility of marriage? I really don’t think so: In fact, this has to do with a case of exception.\\" =Roman Curia work under Pope Francis= In January 2015, Pope Francis named Coccopalmerio to a new board of review within the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that reviews appeals from clergy found guilty of sexual abuse of minors. In 2015, Cardinal Coccopalmerio questioned the scope of the authority given to the Secretariat for the Economy and its prefect Cardinal Pell. These questions involved not the demand for transparency in all financial operations, but the consolidation of management under the Secretariat for the Economy. In 2017, he said provisions of Amoris Laetitia allow people in irregular marriage access to the sacraments only if they recognize their situation is sinful and desire to change it. The fact that such a couple also believes changing the situation immediately by splitting would cause more harm and forgoing sexual relations would threaten their current relationship does not rule out the possibility of receiving sacramental absolution and Communion. =Resignation= A month after Coccopalmerio's 80th birthday, Pope Francis accepted his resignation and named Filippo Iannone to succeed him. Affairs and allegations =The Capozzi affair= In June 2017, news surfaced that at some point during the month, Msgr. Luigi Capozzi, the private secretary to Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio, had been arrested by Vatican police after illegally using cocaine at a gay orgy party at his (Capozzi's) Vatican apartment.https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2017/06/28/vaticano-fermato-un- monsignore-festini-gay-e-droga-nel-palazzo-del-santuffizio/3691426/ He was afterwards hospitalized at the Roman Pius XI clinic so that he could detox. After that, he had a short period of retreat at a nearby monastery and then spent time at the Gemelli Hospital in Rome. Despite the fact that Capozzi resided in the apartment, the apartment was owned by Coccopalmerio.https://www.catholic.org/news/international/europe/story.php?id=75429 Prior to the arrest, Coccopalmerio had also recommended having Capozzi appointed as a Bishop.https://cal-catholic.com/lower-than-the-rome-of-the- borgias/ A Jerusalem Post article dated July 24, 2019 revealed that following his arrest, Capozzi was ordered to undergo drug rehabilitation therapy and was no longer in the Vatican, but rather a spiritual retreat somewhere in Italy.https://www.jpost.com/OMG/Gay-orgy-drug-party-busted-by-Vatican- police-596717 =The Inzoli affair= In the October 2018 issue of the German Catholic journal Herder Korrespondenz, Benjamin Leven, a German theologian and editor of the said journal reported that, according to his own sources, it was Cardinal Coccopalmerio who approached the Pope in favor of the child abuser Don Mauro Inzoli in order to have him partially reinstated as priest. Leven also alleged that Coccopalmerio is known in Rome for generally opposing the removal of culprit priests from the priesthood, which for him is akin to the “death penalty”.

As Bill Britten, he is best known for his portrayal of Bozo the Clown in the New York City market. College Education And Early Career Britten performed as a mimic and pantomimist for local parties in Philadelphia to finance his college education. He earned a degree in drama at Temple University. After serving in the U.S. Army, where he wrote, performed and produced shows for Special Services, he earned a Master's Degree in drama at the University of Washington in Seattle. He taught speech and drama at a Seattle high school, performed on local television, appeared as a clown for a local gas station franchise and trained with two puppet theaters funded by the University of Washington. Following his college education, Britten studied puppetry with Frank Paris, who created and was puppeteer for the original Howdy Doody marionette that appeared on Puppet Playhouse Presents. Britten later was employed by a resort in New England (either New Hampshire or Vermont). According to television children's programming historian Kevin Butler, Britten conveyed to Butler during a 1980s interview that he had worked for “Wantashanta Lodge on glorious Lake Winemesote” (neither have been documented and this could have been a Britten joke) as a toomler, a Yiddish word explained as someone who takes the initiative to make things happen. It was during this time, according to Britten, that he was assigned by the lodge management to perform comedy skits and to create many games and activities for the benefit of the guests. Working with the staff, Britten and his fellow toomlers created ”Can You Top This?” night, a friendly competition allowing guests and Britten to attempt to tell the funniest jokes. Britten also played guitar and likely included his musical talent as part of the entertainment. This experience, along with reading books and magazines that featured ideas, games, craft making and hobbies, aided Britten in developing activities that he utilized later on television shows such as Time For Fun, Wonderama, Bozo The Clown and The Bozo’s Big Top Circus Show. Britten's sources for creating and performing comedic ideas also included old movie comedies that he watched at a theater in Philadelphia and, years later, at a film history society run by film historian, author and lecturer William K.Everson. Britten also listened to popular radio comedy series of the 1930s and 1940s. He became a fan of Eddie Cantor, ”Baron Munchhausen”(portrayed by Jack Pearl), Ed Wynn and many other well-known comedy performers. He watched Your Show of Shows and was inspired by the comedy skits and characters created by Sid Caesar. Career In New York Television Britten moved to New York City to work in nightclubs. At about this time, he met ventriloquist Doris Faye and they formed Britten-Faye Productions. One of their joint creations was Britten's tramp clown character Prof. Okey Dokey. As the tramp clown, Britten entered and won the Funniest New Clown Of The Year audition with the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, besting approximately 400 other candidates. He received national publicity as the schoolteacher turned clown after performing a pantomime routine in which he attempted to sit in a collapsible chair. Britten performed with the circus at Madison Square Garden during the spring of 1954. He remained in the city when the circus moved to the next destination on its itinerary. Britten made his first television appearance during 1955 (several sources give the year as 1954) on WJZ-TV (later WABC-TV) for the \\"Jolly Gene And His Fun Machine\\" show. On the program, Britten provided puppetry and voice characterization for the show's puppets that included \\"Jolly Gene\\", \\"Yoo Hoo The Cuckoo\\" and \\"Waldo The Dodo.\\" He also drew cartoons on the show's magic screen. Britten remained with the show until 1956. Britten appeared on several top-rated national shows such as \\"Name That Tune\\" and he became the third host of \\"Time For Fun!\\" on weekday afternoons on WABC from December 31, 1956 to August 1, 1958. On the show, he portrayed \\"Johnny Jellybean.\\" Assisted by Faye and her puppets, Britten entertained millions of children at noon each day with his \\"Jellybeaner Salute\\" and \\"Jellybeaner Song.\\" One of the skits that Britten performed as \\"Johnny Jellybean\\" was his unsuccessful effort to obtain a drink of water from a malfunctioning water fountain. This skit was based on a similar routine that the \\"Poor Soul\\" Jackie Gleason character performed on The Cavalcade Of Stars television variety show on the DuMont Television Network during 1951. The information about Gleason's performance in the water fountain skit is derived from a recently discovered kinnie film print of that show that was featured on the television documentary \\"Jackie Gleason’s Cavalcade Of Characters.\\" Britten succeeded Herb Sheldon on August 10, 1958 to become the host of WABD's (later WNEW-TV and now WNYW-TV) \\"Wonderama\\" program. It was the first children's show to be taped before a live studio audience. Britten initially hosted the show as \\"Three Gun Willie The Kid\\" and he was accompanied by Doris Faye's \\"Princess Ticklefeather\\" character. Britten's character, however, proved unpopular and was dropped from the show. Britten also hosted \\"The Looney Tunes Show\\" on Saturday nights from August 9, 1958 until August 30, 1958, and the weekday evenings \\"Bugs Bunny Presents\\" and \\"Funnytoones\\" shows at the same station until his December 1958 departure. On Monday, September 14, 1959, Britten moved to WPIX-TV in New York City and began to portray the character \\"Bozo the Clown\\" for \\"The Bozo Show\\" that aired until March 1, 1963. On March 4, the series changed time slots and was renamed \\"Bozo's Big Top Circus\\". This show lasted until June 2, 1963. During this period, Britten also hosted the Saturday morning cartoon show \\"The Cartoon Express\\", from October 13 to November 3 of 1962. Faye joined him on these shows as \\"Princess Ticklefeather.\\" Britten's last show was \\"Bozo's Cartoon Circus Lunchtime Show\\". The program was broadcast from June 24, 1963 until August 14, 1964, marking the end of his involvement with children's television. A few years earlier, a parent from Westchester County, New York, in a letter published by the New York Daily News, accused Britten of teaching her children to utter the phrase \\"Aw, shut up.\\" In a brief explanation that appeared in a subsequent issue of the newspaper on June 5, 1960, Britten replied: \\"...I must emphasize that she is greatly mistaken in asserting that they are acquiring the expression from me. Apart from many years of performing for children, I have spent many enriching years as a schoolteacher and educator, and I am doubly aware of the influence we performers have on young viewers and our responsibility in that connection. I have never used, nor will I ever use, expressions in bad taste on any of my programs. I feel certain that if (the woman) were to investigate the situation more thoroughly she would find that her children are getting these expressions from other sources.\\" Personal Appearances During his television career, Britten made countless appearances before children at events throughout the New York City area. The appearances included the Christmas parade in Paterson, New Jersey, local circus events and shows at Freedomland U.S.A. in The Bronx. On Friday, June 16, 1961 Britten appeared on the WPIX-TV special program \\"Big Freedomland Special.\\" Other station children's show hosts – Officer Joe Bolton, Captain Jack McCarthy and Chuck McCann – also appeared on the program that was recorded at the popular American history theme park. Britten is mentioned in the book Freedomland U.S.A.: The Definitive History. Programming, Teaching, Broadway, Film Following his work in front of the camera, Britten served as a programming director for WNYC and as a drama teacher at Performing Arts High School in New York City.

A macroscopic traffic model involving traffic flux, traffic density and velocity forms the basis of the fundamental diagram. It can be used to predict the capability of a road system, or its behaviour when applying inflow regulation or speed limits. Fundamental diagram of traffic flow  Basic statements  * There is a connection between traffic density and vehicle velocity: The more vehicles are on a road, the slower their velocity will be. * To prevent congestion and to keep traffic flow stable, the number of vehicles entering the control zone has to be smaller or equal to the number of vehicles leaving the zone in the same time. * At a critical traffic density and a corresponding critical velocity the state of flow will change from stable to unstable. * If one of the vehicles brakes in unstable flow regime the flow will collapse. The primary tool for graphically displaying information in the study traffic flow is the fundamental diagram. Fundamental diagrams consist of three different graphs: flow-density, speed-flow, and speed-density. The graphs are two dimensional graphs. All the graphs are related by the equation “flow = speed * density”; this equation is the essential equation in traffic flow. The fundamental diagrams were derived by the plotting of field data points and giving these data points a best fit curve. With the fundamental diagrams researchers can explore the relationship between speed, flow, and density of traffic. =Speed-density= The speed- density relationship is linear with a negative slope; therefore, as the density increases the speed of the roadway decreases. The line crosses the speed axis, y, at the free flow speed, and the line crosses the density axis, x, at the jam density. Here the speed approaches free flow speed as the density approaches zero. As the density increases, the speed of the vehicles on the roadway decreases. The speed reaches approximately zero when the density equals the jam density. =Flow-density= In the study of traffic flow theory, the flow-density diagram is used to determine the traffic state of a roadway. Currently, there are two types of flow density graphs: parabolic and triangular. Academia views the triangular flow-density curve as more the accurate representation of real world events. The triangular curve consists of two vectors. The first vector is the freeflow side of the curve. This vector is created by placing the freeflow velocity vector of a roadway at the origin of the flow-density graph. The second vector is the congested branch, which is created by placing the vector of the shock wave speed at zero flow and jam density. The congested branch has a negative slope, which implies that the higher the density on the congested branch the lower the flow; therefore, even though there are more cars on the road, the number of cars passing a single point is less than if there were fewer cars on the road. The intersection of freeflow and congested vectors is the apex of the curve and is considered the capacity of the roadway, which is the traffic condition at which the maximum number of vehicles can pass by a point in a given time period. The flow and capacity at which this point occurs is the optimum flow and optimum density, respectively. The flow density diagram is used to give the traffic condition of a roadway. With the traffic conditions, time-space diagrams can be created to give travel time, delay, and queue lengths of a road segment. =Speed- flow= Speed – flow diagrams are used to determine the speed at which the optimum flow occurs. There are currently two shapes of the speed-flow curve. The speed-flow curve also consists of two branches, the free flow and congested branches. The diagram is not a function, allowing the flow variable to exist at two different speeds. The flow variable existing at two different speeds occurs when the speed is higher and the density is lower or when the speed is lower and the density is higher, which allows for the same flow rate. In the first speed-flow diagram, the free flow branch is a horizontal line, which shows that the roadway is at free flow speed until the optimum flow is reached. Once the optimum flow is reached, the diagram switches to the congested branch, which is a parabolic shape. The second speed flow diagram is a parabola. The parabola suggests that the only time there is free flow speed is when the density approaches zero; it also suggests that as the flow increases the speed decreases. This parabolic graph also contains an optimum flow. The optimum flow also divides the free flow and congested branches on the parabolic graph.  Macroscopic fundamental diagram  A macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) is type of traffic flow fundamental diagram that relates space-mean flow, density and speed of an entire network with n number of links as shown in Figure 1. The MFD thus represents the capacity, \\\\mu(n), of the network in terms of vehicle density with \\\\mu_1 being the maximum capacity of the network and \\\\eta being the jam density of the network. The maximum capacity or “sweet spot” of the network is the region at the peak of the MFD function. Figure 1: Sample traffic flow macroscopic fundamental diagram Figure 2: Space-time diagram for the ith link in a traffic flow network = Flow = The space-mean flow, \\\\bar q, across all the links of a given network can be expressed by: \\\\bar q = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{k=1}^n d_i(B)}{nTL} , where B is the area in the time-space diagram shown in Figure 2. = Density = The space-mean density, \\\\bar k, across all the links of a given network can be expressed by: \\\\bar k = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{k=1}^n t_i(B)}{nTL} , where B is the area in the time-space diagram shown in Figure 2. = Speed = The space- mean speed, \\\\bar v, across all the links of a given network can be expressed by: \\\\bar v = \\\\frac{\\\\bar q}{\\\\bar k}, where B is the area in the space-time diagram shown in Figure 2. = Average travel time = The MFD function can be expressed in terms of the number of vehicles in the network such that: n=\\\\bar k \\\\sum_{k=1}^n l_i = \\\\bar k L where L represents the total lane miles of the network. Let d be the average distance driven by a user in the network. The average travel time (\\\\tau) is: \\\\tau = \\\\frac{d}{\\\\bar v} = \\\\frac{nd}{MFD(n)L} = Application of the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) = In 2008, the traffic flow data of the city street network of Yokohama, Japan was collected using 500 fixed sensors and 140 mobile sensors. The studyGeroliminis, N; Daganzo, CF. “Existence of urban-scale macroscopic fundamental diagrams: Some experimental findings.” TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL; NOV, 2008; 42; 9; p759-p770 revealed that city sectors with approximate area of 10 km2 are expected to have well-defined MFD functions. However, the observed MFD does not produce the full MFD function in the congested region of higher densities. Most beneficially though, the MFD function of a city network was shown to be independent of the traffic demand. Thus, through the continuous collection of traffic flow data the MFD for urban neighborhoods and cities can be obtained and used for analysis and traffic engineering purposes. These MFD functions can aid agencies in improving network accessibility and help to reduce congestion by monitoring the number of vehicles in the network. In turn, using congestion pricing, perimeter control, and other various traffic control methods, agencies can maintain optimum network performance at the \\"sweet spot\\" peak capacity. Agencies can also use the MFD to estimate average trip times for public information and engineering purposes. Keyvan-Ekbatani et al.Keyvan-Ekbatani, M., Kouvelas, A, Papamichail, I. & Papageorgiou, M. “Exploiting the Fundamental Diagram of Urban Networks for Feedback-Based Gating.” TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL; DEC, 2012; 46; 10; p1393-p1403 have exploited the notion of MFD to improve mobility in saturated traffic conditions via application of gating measures, based on an appropriate simple feedback control structure. They developed a simple (nonlinear and linearized) control design model, incorporating the operational MFD, which allows for the gating problem to be cast in a proper feedback control design setting. This allows for application and comparison of a variety of linear or nonlinear, feedback or predictive (e.g. Smith predictor, internal model control and other) control design methods from the control engineering arsenal; among them, a simple but efficient PI controller was developed and successfully tested in a fairly realistic microscopic simulation environment.

Childhood and education  Born in the Netherlands, moved to the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) when he was ten. There in the tropics, he began his craft by sketching bronze-skinned Indonesian girls for leisure. He returned to the Netherlands to study at the Academy of Art, to refine his growing mastery of the female figures. Like most continental artists, he gravitated first to Paris and quickly established himself as a portraitist of considerable talent. In 1962, he arrived in New York. Because of the softness and light he infused his portraits, he was chosen by several companies to do commemorative plates. Jansen is, perhaps, best known throughout the United States and Europe for his mother's day plates and puppies plate series.  Notable works  Many of the rich and famous (such as Raquel Welch, Willian Holden, Donald Sutherland, Stephanie Powers, and the LA Times Hearst family. ) sought out Jansen for his portraiture skills, Jansen's sitting fee in the 1960 was US$20,000. In addition, he also gained fame for his portraiture of The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. His Beatles portraits are among the more collectible memorabilia by fans. He was in great demand in the Los Angeles galleries, but sold primarily through Aaron Brothers.  Painting  But despite his national reputation as a portrait artist, he refused many of those demand and resumed his childhood love affair of painting nudes. He then moved to Southern California. For eighteen years, he was commissioned by Playboy Magazine to paint the playmate of the month. In his first six years, he was the artist chosen to paint 58 of the 72 portraits. His works hang in the Hugh Hefner's Playboy corporate headquarters and in the mansion. Rank among the nation's best interpretive artist of nudes, Jansen's canvases hang in collection of a wide range of notables from Jean-Claude Pascal to the late Judy Garland.  Death  He died from an apparent heart attack in 1980 at 50 years of age.

She was regent of Naples from 1386 until 1393 during the minority of her son Ladislaus of Naples. Life She was the fourth daughter of Charles, Duke of Durazzo (1323–1348), and Maria of Calabria, but the only one to have children; her legitimate line of descent, as well as the century-old Capetian House of Anjou, ended with her daughter. In February 1369, Margaret married her paternal first cousin Charles of Durazzo. He was a son of Louis of Durazzo, another son of John, Duke of Durazzo, and his second wife Agnes de Périgord. The bride was twenty-two years old and the groom twenty-four. =Queen= Charles managed to depose her maternal aunt Queen Joanna I of Naples in 1382. He succeeded her and Margaret became his queen consort. Charles succeeded James of Baux as Prince of Achaea in 1383 with Margaret still as his consort. By then becoming the senior Angevin male, Charles was offered the Crown of Hungary. Margaret did not support the idea of deposing Queen Mary of Hungary and discouraged her husband from doing so. Nonetheless, he successfully deposed Mary in December 1385 and had himself crowned. She was the daughter of his deceased cousin Louis I of Hungary and Elizabeth of Bosnia. However, Mary's formidable mother Elizabeth arranged his assassination at Visegrád on 24 February 1386. =Regent= In the meantime, relationships with Pope Urban VI became strained, as he suspected that Charles was plotting against him. In January 1385 he had six cardinals arrested, and one, under torture, revealed Charles' conjure. He thus excommunicated Charles and Margaret and raised an interdict over the Kingdom of Naples. Margaret became a queen dowager and the regent of Naples as the guardian of her minor son from 1386 until 1393. In 1387 she poisoned her elder sister Joanna, Duchess of Durazzo, who might have a better claim to the throne of Naples, and her husband Robert IV of Artois, Count of Eu to death. She survived her husband by twenty-six years but never remarried. Their son Ladislaus succeeded to the throne of the Kingdom of Naples while Mary of Hungary was restored to her throne. Margaret insisted that her husband's death be revenged and Elizabeth was murdered. The heads of her defenders were sent to console Margaret. Pope Boniface IX and Margarethe came to a peace agreement, her excommunication was lifted and with the help of Cardinal Angelo Acciaioli Margaret could continue to serve as regent until July 1393. =Later life= In the last years of her life, the queen dowager retired first to Salerno and then to Acquamela, where she died of plague in 1412. She had become a devout Catholic and a member of a Franciscan Third Order in her last years and requested to be buried as such; she was buried in white habit in Salerno Cathedral.

This overturned a tradition of enslavement in European colonies in the Americas where babies born to enslaved women became the property of the women's owners. Although intended to be a gradual abolition of slavery, the principle was unevenly applied and many countries did not follow through with full abolition. The Freedom of Wombs Law, commonly referred to as The Free Womb Law was indeed a rule that all children who were born and raised from enslaved women were not enslaved at birth. This law provided protections of slave savings for each and every child, so that they could be protected, if anything were to happen. This also acknowledged that slaves could be self-purchased because they eventually did not need to get permission from, or have to really listen to their masters, and or multiple slave owners. This also allowed for potential slave registration to comply with it. It is also known that Congressional leads have changed the outcome of the Free Womb Law. These outlined the specific rules that Indigenous people had to follow in Chapter 4: Interpreting Machudo de Assis of the book entitled \\"Honor Status, and Law In Modern Latin America, written by Sueann Caulfield, Sarah C. Chambers, Laura Putnam and editors.Caulfield, Sueann, et al. \\"Interpreting Machado De Assis: Paternalism, Slavery, and the Free Womb Law.\\" Honor, Status, and Law in Modern Latin America, Duke University Press, 2005, pp. 99–99. By country A movement for independence from Spain grew in the American colonies in the 19th century, influenced by liberal ideas, such as the abolition of slavery, which Mexico had declared in 1829 by President Vicente Guerrero, Great Britain in 1833, and the United States in 1865 at the end of that country's civil war. One of the first steps in gradual abolition was the Ley de Libertad de Vientres, an 1811 law written by Manuel de Salas of Chile.\\"Manuel de Salas\\" In Argentina, the Law of Wombs was passed on February 2, 1813 by the Assembly of Year XIII. The law stated that those born to slave mothers after January 31, 1813 would be granted freedom when contracting matrimony, or on their 16th birthday for women and 20th for men. Upon manumission, they were to be given land and tools to work it.\\"Pasado y presente de los Negros en Buenos Aires\\" In 1853, Argentina fully abolished slavery with the Constitution of 1853. In Colombia, the Law of wombs was first passed by the government of Antioquia in 1814, but it was not until 1824 that the country accepted it.\\"http://www.colombiaaprende.edu.co/html/etnias/1604/article-82844.html\\" After years of laws that only purported a partial advancement towards abolition, President José Hilario López because of the growing popular unrest, pushed Congress to pass total abolition in May 21 of 1851. Former owners were compensated with government issued bonuses. In Peru, the president José de San Martín established \\"the freedom of wombs\\" for those born after the declaration of independence in 1821.\\"La sociedad a inicios de la República\\" Venezuela endorsed a similar law in 1821,\\"Ley de Abolición de la Esclavitud\\" as well as Ecuador,\\"REFORMAS ECONÓMICAS DE MEDIADOS DEL SIGLO XIX\\" Uruguay in 1825,\\"Instrumentos Nacionales de Derechos Humanos\\" Paraguay in 1842\\"De la Independencia a nuestros días\\" and Brazil in 1871.\\"LEI DO VENTRE LIVRE\\" In Brazil, the Rio Branco Law, also referred to as \\"Law of Free Birth\\", was passed by the Brazilian Parliament on 1871. By the 1870s social tensions were rising due to slavery in Brazil between conservatives versus liberals. As a compromise, Parliament favored the idea of emancipating slaves and enacted a law freeing children born to enslaved women. The \\"Law of Free Birth\\" made it so that children born to an enslaved women were not enslaved. Slaves eventually were then granted freedom through manumission and later on, emancipation laws that target older slaves.Caulfield, Sueann, et al. \\"Interpreting Machado De Assis: Paternalism, Slavery, and the Free Womb Law.\\" Honor, Status, and Law in Modern Latin America, Duke University Press, 2005, pp. 99. Spain passed a similar law in 1869 to apply to its plantation colonies of Cuba and Puerto Rico, and passed it in 1870, to take effect in 1872. On the Iberian mainland, Spain had abolished slavery in 1837. It is also known as Ley Moret (Moret Law).\\"La Ley de Vientres Libres y los intereses esclavistas\\" The countries that first denied the enslavement of babies born to enslaved mothers proceeded to abolish slavery in total later.

It affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in July 1937. After a failed merger with a different maritime group in 1988, the union merged with the Seafarers International Union of North America in 2001. Early years Seamen in hiring hall, NMU banner, New York City, December 1941. (Photograph: Arthur Rothstein) The NMU was founded in May 1937 by Joseph Curran, who was at the time an able seaman and boatswain aboard the Panama Pacific Line ocean liner . He was a member of the International Seamen's Union (ISU) but was not active in the work of the union. From March 1 to March 4, 1936, Curran led a strike aboard California, then docked in San Pedro, Los Angeles, California. Curran and the crew of California went on what was essentially a sitdown strike at sailing time, refusing to cast off the lines unless wages were increased and overtime paid. United States Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins personally intervened to resolve the strike. Speaking to the crew by telephone, Perkins agreed to arrange a grievance hearing once the ship docked at its destination in New York City, and that there would be no reprisals by the company or government against Curran and the strikers. On Californias return trip, Panama Pacific Line raised wages by $5 a month to $60 per month. However, United States Secretary of Commerce Daniel Roper and the Panama Pacific Line declared Curran and the strikers mutineers. Curran and other top strike leaders were fined two days' pay, fired and blacklisted, but Perkins was able to keep the strikers from being prosecuted for mutiny. Seamen all along the East Coast struck to protest the treatment of the California's crew. Curran became a leader of the 10-week strike, eventually forming a supportive association known as the Seamen's Defense Committee. In October 1936, Curran called a second strike, the 1936 Gulf Coast maritime workers' strike, in part to improve working conditions and in part to embarrass the ISU. The four-month strike idled 50,000 seamen and 300 ships along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Believing it was time to abandon the conservative International Seamen's Union, Curran began to sign up members for a new, rival union. The level of organizing was so intense that hundreds of ships delayed their sailing time as seamen listened to organizers and signed union cards. One of the co-founders of the organization was the later civil rights activist James Peck. In May 1937, Curran and other leaders of his Seamen's Defense Committee reconstituted the group as the National Maritime Union. It held its first convention in July, and 30,000 seamen left the ISU to join the NMU. Curran was elected president of the new organization. The black, Jamaican-born Ferdinand Smith was elected as the union's secretary-treasurer. Within a year, the NMU had more than 50,000 members, and most American shippers were under contract. Seventh Avenue between 12th Street and 13th Street, designed by Albert C. Ledner, was built in 1964 as the union's headquarters. The hiring halls were in the glass blocks on the ground floor. The union sold it to St. Vincent's Hospital in 1973. Ninth Avenue between West 16th and 17th Streets, were built in 1966, also designed by Ledner. The Ninth Avenue building on the right is currently the Maritime Hotel, while the 17th Street building (left) is being converted into the Dream Downtown Hotel. Immediately after the NMU's founding convention in July 1937, Curran and other seamen's union leaders were invited by John L. Lewis to come to Washington, D.C., to form a major organizing drive among ship and port workers. The unions comprised by the CIO had been ejected by the American Federation of Labor (AFL) in November 1936, and now Lewis wanted to launch a maritime union. His goal was to create a union as large and influential as the Steel Workers Organizing Committee out of the nation's 300,000 maritime workers. Although Lewis favored Harry Bridges, president of the Pacific Coast District of the International Longshoremen's Association, to lead the new maritime industrial union, the other union leaders balked. Curran agreed to affiliate with the CIO, but refused to let Bridges or anyone else take over his union. His views were reflected among those of the other union leaders, and the CIO's maritime industrial union never got off the ground. By 1946, the NMU had 46 branches, a staff of 500, and 73,000 members. In 1948, Lee Pressman joined Joseph Forer, a Washington-based attorney, in representing Ferdinand C. Smith, secretary of the National Maritime Union along with Gerhard Eisler, supposedly the top Soviet intelligence agent in the US, Irving Potash, vice president of the Fur and Leather Workers Union; Charles A. Doyle of the Gas, Coke and Chemical Workers Union, and John Williamson, labor secretary of the CPUSA). On May 5, 1946, Pressman and Forer received a preliminary injunction so their defendants might have hearings with examiners unconnected with the investigations and prosecutions by examiners of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Expansion In 1958 the union decided on an aggressive building program, and hired New Orleans-based architect Albert C. Ledner to design some unique buildings for them, including a headquarters building at Seventh Avenue between 12th Street and 13th Street, completed in 1964, a block-through service annex at 346 West 17th Street and a plaza and \\"pizza-box\\"-shaped companion building next to it on Ninth Avenue, both built in 1966 and both named for Joseph Curran. The Curran buildings held offices for the union and its pension fund, medical and training facilities, dormitory rooms for seaman, a gymnasium, swimming pool and 900-seat auditorium. In 1973, with the union's fortunes fading with the decreased activity in the Port of New York, the headquarters building was sold to St. Vincent's Hospital. The 17th Street and Ninth Avenue buildings were sold in 1987 to Covenant House, a drug rehabilitation program, for use as a runaway shelter and educational facility. Mergers In 1988 the NMU agreed to merge with the Marine Engineers' Beneficial Association (MEBA) to form District 1, MEBA-NMU. The merger did not last. MEBA members charged that the merger referendum was rigged by MEBA president C. E. \\"Gene\\" DeFries. The accusations were serious enough that the United States Department of Justice began an investigation. Union members were even more outraged when they learned DeFries and five other union officers paid themselves more than $2 million in severance payments. During the course of their findings, a group of MEBA members (Led by Alex Shandrowsky, Jesse Calhoon, and Don Keefe) peacefully occupied MEBA's Headquarters in Washington, DC after DeFries refused to disclose information to union members. DeFries and others were later indicted for crimes relating to their manipulation of union elections and misuse of union offices. US versus DeFries (et al.) became the first successful criminal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) prosecution of the governing body of a labor organization, which resulted in the conviction of 18 officials of MEBA), for RICO, RICO conspiracy, embezzlement, extortion, and mail fraud. NMU disaffiliated from the Marine Engineers in 1993. Louis Parise was elected the newly independent union's president. In 1999 the NMU became an autonomous affiliate of the Seafarers International Union of North America, and in 2001 it fully merged with that union (now called \\"Seafarers International Union\\").

She was one of the first full-time, and the first female, professors of the history of medicine in the United States. Biography Mettler was born on October 26, 1909 in Weehawken, New Jersey. Her father, William Charles Asper, was a lawyer. She learned Latin at the Convent of St. Elizabeth, where she received her A.B. in 1931. She studied further at Cornell University where she received her Ph.D. in 1938. During this time she familiarized herself with medicine at the Washington University School of Nursing and at the University of Georgia School of Medicine, where her husband, Fred Mettler, worked. In 1939, she was named assistant professor of medical history at the University of Georgia School of Medicine. In 1941, they moved to New York City, where she held a position as an associate in neurology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. She noted that medical history is typically taught either by delivering chronological lectures or by focusing on a specific topic, and proposed to correlate medical history teaching with the teaching of the medical curriculum. Her major work, The History of Medicine, reflected that approach. It was completed after nine years of work just a few days before her death, and published posthumously. Mettler died on December 1, 1943, three days after the birth of her daughter. See also *List of women who died in childbirth *Maternal mortality References * Mettler FA.

It is situated about west of Kingston upon Hull city centre near to the Humber Estuary and about east of the village of Welton with which it is nearly contiguous. Modern geography The village is bounded to the south by the A63 road, and is north of the Humber Estuary bank. The village is on the southern edge of the Yorkshire Wolds approximately above sea level, to the north-east 'Melton Hill' rises to a height of . The A63 road passes east-west directly south of Melton, and effectively divides the low- lying clays of the Humber foreshore from the chalk uphills of the Wolds.Ordnance Survey, 1:25000, 2006 In 2002–03 the village became part of the South Hunsley Ward of the East Riding of Yorkshire, and within the Haltemprice and Howden parliamentary constituency. South Hunsley School is located on the western fringes of the village. History William Melton, Archbishop of York (died 1340) is thought to have originated from Melton. The land around Melton was enclosed by Act of Parliament in 1771/3. By the beginning of the 19th century the village and environs became the dwelling place of several worthies of Kingston upon Hull; including Benjamin Blaydes (1735–1805), and J.S. Williamson at Melton Hill. In 1823 the population was 107. Melton Grange was built around 1745, Melton Hill to the higher ground north-east of the village was established in the late 1700s, Melton House was constructed around 1830; a Roman burial was discovered near Melton House around 1840, including a gold brooch. In 1840 the Hull and Selby Railway opened, passing Melton about south of the village. left In 1855 the land around Melton was essential rural, and used for agricultural use, with the exception of the gentrified houses and their gardens, some narrow plantations, and a small brick and tile works south of Melton Common in Melton Ings located on the bank of the Humber Estuary. The brick work's workings continued to expand in the early 1900s and had acquired a tramway system within the clay pits.Ordnance Survey, 1:10560, 1855; 1:2500, 1890–1; 1:2500, 1927 By the 1920s the tile works had closed, whilst a large scale cement industry had developed; to the north of Melton chalk was extracted at Melton Bottom Quarry, whilst south of the railway line the Humber Cement Works had been established west of Gibson Lane, the works was connected to the main railway, and served by a small railway halt Melton Halt. The Humber Cement Works also operated an industrial tramway south to the Humber bank, and an aerial cableway connecting the plant to a jetty on the Humber bank at West Clough.Ordnance Survey, 6\\" to 1 mile, 1929, sheets 239SW, 239NW South of the village worker's housing was constructed in the 1920s and 30s for the Humber Cement Works and for the Capper Pass tin smelter; the Capper Pass works was constructed in the 1930s for Capper Pass and Son to the south of the Hull and Selby railway line and directly east of Humber Cement. The houses of Melton House and Melton Hill were demolished in the 1950s. South Hunsley School opened in 1956, on the site of the 1840 Eastdale, which was demolished in the late 1800s. Further houses were built in the village of Melton during the 1960s, at around the same time the scope of extraction of clay and chalk around Melton Bottom Quary was considerably expanded – the worked area expanded south and west, and the Humber Cement works clay extraction pits also expanded west into Welton Ings.Ordnance Survey, 1:10560 and 1:10000, 1956, 1970 The section of the A63 road passing south of Melton was opened in 1963. The cement works closed in 1981; a plant supplying Calcium oxide for use in the plastics industry was established on the site in 1990. The Capper Pass, Melton smelting works closed and was decommissioned in the early 1990s. It was a major employer in the wider area, but also a polluter due to the nature of the work it performed; the site was thought to be responsible for a cancer cluster discovered in the west Hull area in the 1980s, as well as having affecting the health of its own employees. In the early 2000s the site was redeveloped as open air storage and industrial warehousing. A new grade separated junction was constructed on the A63 east of Melton in 2006/7, replacing three at-grade junctions; link roads giving access to Melton Bottom and to planned business parks south of the A63 were also built. Two large industrial estate/business parks Melton West and Melton Park started development south of Melton in the first decade of the 2000s; planning consent for the first phase of 'Melton West' was given in 2007, with the second phase given planning consent in 2011. St. Modwen Properties gained planning permission to develop the 'Melton Park' site in 2006/7, in 2011 the company announced it was planning to use part of the development site for residential development. As of 2012 the quarry at Melton Bottom is owned by OMYA and produces chalk whiting. A southern working named Melton Bottom Chalk Pit is no longer worked, and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to its geological content. The working quarry is known as the Welton Wold Quarry.

The purpose of the VNL plan and a five- level long-distance switching hierarchy was to minimize the number of trunk circuits used during a call and maximize the voice quality achieved on each circuit. Excessive noise or loss meant that subscribers may have difficulty hearing each other. This was particularly important in the 1960s when dial-up data applications were developed using analog modems. The five levels of PSTN switching systems used with VNL were: * Class 1 - Regional long-distance switching system * Class 2 - Sectional long-distance switching system * Class 3 - Primary long-distance switching system * Class 4 - Toll-access switching system * Class 5 - End-office switching system Class 5 end-office switches provide local telephone service and dialtone to residential, business, and government subscribers, as well as telephone company payphones. Residential service includes message rate and flat rate local calling plans with extra charges for long-distance calls and supplementary services such as call waiting, 3-way calling, and call forwarding. Business service is mostly message rate local calling plans with extra charges for long distance and supplementary services. Message Rate calling means that subscribers pay for calls based on duration of the call and distance to the called party. Government subscribers include cities, counties, state, and federal agencies and often included Centrex service. Pay phones were traditionally provided exclusively by telephone companies but during the early 1980s Customer-owned coin-operated telephone services were established. Class 4 toll access switches provide long-distance (toll) telephone service including intrastate calling and inter-state calling. Intrastate calls are generally more expensive than inter-state calls due to favorable tariffs with price plans approved by the Public Utilities Commission or Public Service Commission for each state. Inter-state calls are generally less expensive than intrastate calls since tariffs are filed with the Federal Communications Commission because of the inter-state commerce aspect of the service. Class 4 switches provide access to long-distance service in rural areas. In addition, Class 4 switches traditionally provided operator assisted calls such as person-to-person, collect, and calls billed to third parties. However, many operator services are now automated with minimum human intervention. Class 3 primary switches provided the first layer of the AT&T; long-distance switching network. VNL routing methods preferred trunk connections between Class 3 switches to minimize class 1 and class 2 connections. Class 3 switches also act as Service Switching Points or SSP's that provide access to Intelligent Network services such as Toll-Free, Virtual Private Network, Calling Card, and Credit Card calls. If circuits to other Class 3 switches were unavailable, the call was routed to the Class 2 (and/or Class 1) switch in the same region. Calls were not routed \\"up-chain\\" to Class 2 or Class 1 switches in a different region. Analog circuits between AT&T; long-distance switches are known as Inter-Toll trunks while circuits from a long-distance switch to local switches are known as Toll Completing trunks or toll switching trunks. Trunks between long- distance switches in other carrier networks are known as Inter-Machine Trunks or IMT's. Class 2 sectional switches provide the second layer of long-distance switching. VNL routing methods preferred trunk connections between the originating Class 2 switch and a Class 3 or Class 2 switch in a different region. Calls were not routed \\"up-chain\\" to a Class 1 switch in a different region. Class 1 regional switches provide the final layer of long-distance switching. VNL routing methods preferred \\"down-chain\\" trunk connections between the originating Class 1 switch and a Class 3, Class 2, or Class 1 switch in a different region. Analog trunk connections between Class 1 switches were required to have a loss of zero decibels. The VNL architecture was gradually phased out due to the conversion of network circuits from analog to digital and the related conversion to a non-hierarchical network routing schemes such as AT&T;'s Dynamic Non-Hierarchical Routing or Nortel's Dynamically Controlled Routing methods.

The number of participants needed varies from as few as two players to as many players as can fit on a tennis court. These games are often used by coaches and other tennis instructors to help teach the basic skills of tennis.a substitute shall be allowed to field for any player who may during the match be incapacitated illness or injury, but not for any reason without the consent of the opposing captain. Singles Games Singles games are games that practice the strategies used when playing a match of singles. =One Ball Live= A tennis ball At least eight players are needed for this game. Two players start on the baseline, the back line of the tennis court, of each side with the court split in half vertically. Two tennis balls are played simultaneously on each half of the court starting with a drop hit. A drop hit is an underhand hit by bouncing the ball first. Once one player loses a point on his or her side of the court, they call out “One ball live!” and the single remaining ball is played out among the four players with the court no longer split down the middle. The team that wins this point stays, while two new players on the other side replace the losing team and the game starts over with two balls. The first team to reach ten points wins. This game is designed for use in practicing groundstrokes, the forehand and backhand, at first and then doubles strategy once \\"One ball live\\" is called. =Tag Team Singles= This game format can also be used when the number of players drops to 4 in the game \\"Around the World\\". At least four players are needed for this game. Players are split into two teams. Each team lines up behind the middle of the baseline. One player from each team will start the game off and step up to the baseline. Either player can start the point. Once a player has hit the ball, he or she goes to the end of their line and the next player in line will hit their team's next shot. The same happens for the other team. The rally continues until one team makes a mistake. This version is designed to work on consistency in the players ground strokes. =Relay or Tag Tennis= Relay / Tag Tennis is a tennis game that encourages teamwork and participation at all levels. It can be played as singles or doubles, on any size of court and at any level of play. Players are split into two teams. Each team lines up behind the baseline, or somewhere on the court that is safe. One player from the serving team starts the game and plays the point according to existing and traditional rules and etiquette of tennis. Every player or doubles pair plays out at least one whole rally. Once a player has played their rally/rallies, they go to the end of their line and the next player in line plays their team's next point/rally. Scoring can be traditional (15/30/40/Deuce/Advantage/Game), Tie Break, Ping Pong or any net/wall game scoring format. To ensure every player/doubles pair faces every opponent player/team, when the number of players/teams on opposite sides is equal, the serving team should stay on for two points/rallies, while the receiving team stay on for one point/rally. Any existing tournament and league competition infrastructure can be used to run a Relay / Tag tennis competition. =King of the Court= Three or more players are needed for this game. One person, designated as the “king” or “queen,” goes to the opposite side of the court. The other players make a line behind the baseline of the current side. One challenger steps up and plays a singles point against the “king.” The point is started with either a serve or a drop hit. If the challenger wins, they replace the “king” on the other side of the court. Variations of this game include the challenger having to win two or three points in a row. This game practices playing a singles point. =Champs and Chumps= Six or more players are needed for this game. An equal number of players line up behind each baseline. One side is designated the chumps while the other is designated the champs. A player from each line steps up and plays out a singles point. The point is started with either a drop hit or a serve. The winner of the point goes to the end of the champs’ line while the loser goes to the end of the chumps' line. The game is played for a designated time, and once time is called, the players on the champs side are the winners. This game practices playing a singles point. =On-Off Singles= This was designed when there is a lack of courts. If singles is preferred, over doubles with 4 players. 2 players face off in a separate match and the other 2 have a separate match. The two matches share the court with each match alternating play per point. (two people play their singles point, then alternate as the other two players play their singles point). Doubles Games Doubles games are games that practice the different strategies used in a match of doubles. =Team Doubles= Six or more players are needed for this game. Four players line up in the typical doubles starting positions. The typical doubles starting positions are with one player serving and his partner on the other side of his side of the court at the net. The returning team has a player at the service line in front of the server and a player at the baseline on the other side of the court. The other players wait to play in a line behind the serving or returning players. One team serves the ball and the point is played out. Once the point is over, each side of the court rotates. On the serving side: the server rotates to the net position, the net player sits out, and a new player steps in to serve the ball. On the returning side: the return player rotates to the service line, service line player sits out, and a new player steps in to return the ball. The same team serves the ball until the game is over. The game is played until a team reaches seven or eleven points. Variations in the game include a drop hit to start the point or a coach feeding the ball to start the point. This game is designed to give each player practice at all the doubles positions. =All Position Doubles= Eight or more players are needed for this game. Four players start the first point in the normal doubles starting position. A line of one or more players is to the side of each starting position. The first point is played. Once finished, the first four players rotate in a clockwise direction to the end of the next line. Four new players play out the next point and then rotate in the same manner. The first person to win a total of 10 points wins the game. This game is designed to give each player practice at all the doubles positions. =King of the Court Doubles= Six or more players are needed for this game. One team of two players is designated as the “kings” or “queens” and goes to one side of the court. The other players make a line behind the baseline of the opposite side. One challenging team steps up and plays a doubles point against the “kings.” The point is started with either a serve or a drop hit. If the challengers win, they replace the “kings” on the other side of the court. Variations of this game include the challengers having to win two or three points in a row. This game practices playing a point of doubles. =Rush N' Crush= This game either requires an even number of players 4 or more, or any number of players more than 2 along with an individual ball feeder. The game is traditionally played with doubles teams. A doubles team is designated the rulers and begins on the baseline on the opposite side of the court. The feeder is positioned behind the rulers with respectable space to the rulers for mobility (at least 10 feet behind the line). The other doubles teams are the challengers and take turns on the opposite side of the court with a goal to win 3 points in a row to replace the current rulers. As each point begins, the rulers begin at the baseline, but are free to move anywhere once the point begins. The first point begins with the feeder feeding a short ball to the challengers allowing them to proceed to the net and an offensive. If the challengers win the first point, they remain at the net for the beginning of the next two points (they are allowed free mobility after the point begins). The feeder will randomly designate one player on the challengers team to receive an overhead (a short lob allowing the player to hit a powerful shot similar to a serve from the net), or a volley. With the third point, the other of the two challengers receives an overhead or a volley. If all three points are won the challengers take the place as the new rulers and the previous rulers proceed to the challenger's side. After a certain time, end game may be called and the current rulers are designated as the winners (The power to call end game may go to the feeder). This game was designed to train and encourage aggressiveness and a goal in doubles to move to the net to finish the point. It also trains groundstrokes volleys, and overheads, along with possible use of slices and drop-shots. A super-shot rule may also be put into effect. Here, a feeder may decide at a random time (either the 2nd or 3rd point) to drive a volley between the two challengers. If neither player touches the ball it is called a super-shot and the challengers could be penalized (may run laps, do pushups etc.). With this rule, the game also trains communication between a doubles team. =Triples= Players are divided into teams of three to six players. Each team forms a triangle on each side of the court with one person at the net. Extra players wait behind the baseline. A ball is fed by a coach or player that is sitting out and the point is played using the doubles court. Once the point is over, players rotate clockwise on their respective sides. If there are more than three players, rotate players in and out. The first team to ten points wins. This game is designed to help the net player become more aggressive at the net. =Monkey in the Middle= This game is played in triples formation (a triangle with two players behind the baseline and the third in the team at the net). The game can be played with a feeder positioned off of the court, usually by the net, or without the feeder. A point is begun by feeding the ball to one of the baseline players on either team. The point is played out. Each point is worth one point. If the net player (also known as the monkey), hits a winner, the player earns his/her team 2 points. The next point is begun with a ball being fed to the opposite side of the team that just won the point(s). Games are played to any score 10n + 1 (ex: 11, 21, 31 etc.). =Deep Desperation= Two players go to the baseline of one side of the court as the champs. Two other players go to the net on the opposite side of the champs. These are the challengers. The other players wait at the side of the net post in pairs ready to replace the challengers. The coach lobs a ball over the challenger's heads and the challengers have to run down the lob and play out the point (after it bounces). If the challengers win the point, they replace the champs and the old champs go to the end of the challengers line. If they lose, they go to the back of the challenger's line at the net post. This game is designed to practice running down a lob and getting back into the point. This game is also designed to promote net play and aggressiveness, and shot placement. =Wipe Out= Players are divided into two teams and wait with one team behind each baseline. One player from each team steps up and a singles point is played out starting with a drop hit. The person that wins adds another player from their team to the court while the player that loses goes to the end of their line and a new player replaces him or her. This next point is played one vs. two with the team with only one person on the court starting the ball. The team with one person on the court can use the doubles court while the team with multiple people on the court has to use the singles court. If the team with two people on the court wins, they add another player and play one vs. three. If they lose, all players on the court on that team go to the end of the line and one player replaces them. The other team, the winning team, adds another player to the court. If playing against one player, singles court must be used. If playing against two or more players, doubles court can be used. The game continues until an entire team is on the court and wins the point. This game is designed to practice ball placement. =Around the World= Four or more players are needed for this game. The players are split up evenly on each side of the court and line up behind the baseline. One player from each side steps up to the baseline. Either player feeds the ball and runs to the end of the line on the other side of the court. The person that receives the feed hits the ball and also runs to the end of the line on the other side of the court. The next person in line will hit the next shot and so on. The point continues until an error is made. This process is repeated. Once a person has made three errors, he or she sits out. The last person to make three errors wins. Once the game is down to two people, instead of running to the other side, the person has to hit the ball, drop their racquet, spin around, and continue the point. This game is designed to practice hitting that first shot of each point without first being in a rhythm. =Touch the Curtain= This game requires that there is a wall behind both baselines on the court. 4 individual players take the court with 2 on each side positioned at the baseline. Any extra players will line up by the net post as substitutes. The game also requires a feeder, one who will stand out of the game with a large basket of balls quickly putting a new ball into play once the previous ball is out of play. When the game begins, the 4 players on the court rally the ball back and forth with freedom of mobility and aggressiveness. Each player's main goal is to not be eliminated from the game by falling to a winner (a ball that bounces on the player's court twice). When an individual player mishits the ball, the player is substituted with the next person in line while the feeder immediately puts a ball into play to the opposite (unharmed) side. When a winner is hit, the player within whose court the ball lands (half the court being divided vertically as well), this player is eliminated from the game (it is also popular that a super-shot, or a winner hit through the middle of the court without a definite decision to which player is eliminated, results in both players on that side being eliminated from the game). As more eliminations occur the number of substitutes decrease. When only 4 players remain in the game (no substitutes) a mistake is penalized with the player running back and touching the wall behind the baseline while a ball is put into play in the opposite side allowing the other duo to hit a winner. With 3 players remaining, the same rules apply but the single player only needs to defend a singles court. When 2 players remain, they can decide between themselves to touch the wall, or any other penalty (Dropping the racquet and spinning a full circle is a popular penalty). With that set rule, the 2 players play on a complete singles court until one player remains to be designated the winner. Once a new game begins, the highest ranking players from the previous game usually begin as the substitutes with the winner substituting last, and the runner-up substituting next to last etc. This game is designed to work on the advanced skill of consistency after running to a shot, shot placement, and builds stamina.

In 1291 it fell with the lands of Świdnica to the Silesian Duchy of Jawor, which upon the death of Duke Bolko II the Small in 1368 was ruled by the Kings of Bohemia. From the 16th century onwards, Peterswaldau developed as a centre of weaving. The Lords of Perswaldau had a castle erected in 1617, which was rebuilt in a Baroque style in 1710. The Polish-Saxon cabinet minister Erdmann II of Promnitz acquired the estates in 1721 and gained the privilege to fabricate woven goods by Emperor Charles VI. With most of Silesia, Peterswaldau was annexed from Habsburg-ruled Bohemia by Prussia after the First Silesian War in 1742. In 1765 the lordship passed to Count Christian Frederick of Stolberg-Wernigerode, whose descendants held the estates until their expulsion in 1945. The social hardship of the population in the course of the 19th century industrialisation was perpetuated by the famous Silesian author Gerhart Hauptmann in his play The Weavers, which is set in Peterswaldau. From 1871 the village was part of Germany and in 1945, after Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, it became again part of Poland. It was granted town rights in 1962. From 1975 to 1998 Pieszyce was in Wałbrzych Voivodeship.

(ca. 1220 - before 1294); date of death sometimes given as 1285. was an English Franciscan philosopher, who taught at the University of Oxford in the early 1240s. He was an early commentator on a number of Aristotle's works, in particular those dealing with natural philosophy. Teacher of Aristotle Adam and the theologian Richard Fishacre were two Oxford masters of the mid-13th century. Adam introduced the New Aristotle at the English university at a time when it was prohibited from being taught in Paris, France because of ecclesiastical restrictions. It is probable that Adam received a degree in theology and penned his Aristotelian commentaries during his regency in arts which began by 1243. His explanation of Aristotle's meaning drew heavily on the writing of Averroes. Nature of the soul His particular interest was in whether the agent intellect was within the soul or a power of the soul. Averroes' believed in the latter interpretation while many theologians were inclined to affirm the former. Adam doubted that the agent and possible intellect are of the same substance. He wondered if the substance of the possible intellect is within the soul while that of the agent intellect is outside of it. Like his Oxford colleagues he was curious about the unity of the soul. He felt that Aristotle merely refuted the idea of Plato. The latter believed the various functions of the soul (understanding, opinion, desire, etc.) reflected diverse parts of the soul, which were located in different organs. To answer the question left unanswered by Aristotle, Adam commented that each of the properties reside in the soul as a whole. He elaborated by saying that each individual being can have only one perfection. So it follows that man's perfection must be in one substance. He thought that according to Aristotelian principles, the vegetative and sensitive souls were of different substance than the 'intellective' soul. His attempt to clarify this was inspired by Philip the Chancellor. However Adam's is a more believable argument concerning this matter than is Philip's Summa. Philip the Chancellor insisted that the body and soul were united by a particular medium.Adam of Buckfield, The Problem Of The Rational Soul In The Thirteenth Century, Richard C. Dales, E.J.

Education Butcher was educated at: *University of Pennsylvania, BA with Major Honors (1946) *Howard University School of Law, (1957) *University of Pennsylvania, LLM (1958) Work Butcher's long term teaching post was at Howard University School of Law, where she created the Goler Teal Butcher Award to attract students in international law to the university. Butcher's public work began in 1963 as attorney at the Office of the Legal Advisor, Department of State. From 1971-1974, she was a consultant to the House Foreign Affairs Committee's Subcommittee on Africa. She also served as Assistant Administrator for Africa, Agency for International Development under the Carter Administration, and head of the Clinton Transition Team for the Agency of International Development in 1992. At the forefront of Butcher's human rights advocacy was her passion for ending global hunger and apartheid in South Africa. Butcher's advocacy of the right to freedom from hunger, specifically \\"starvation, chronic hunger, malnutrition,\\" always followed by encouraging the privileged world to act on their duty to help in ending hunger.Goler Teal Butcher, Symposium: World Food Day Food and Law Conference: the Legal Faces of the Hunger Problem 30 How. L.J. 193, 193-94 (1987). She recognized \\"[h]unger is not a mere matter of geography or of distribution of food. It relates to powerlessness, financial, economic and political powerlessness of individuals and social classes within nations and within the international community.\\" Goler Teal Butcher, Symposium: World Food Day Food and Law Conference: the Legal Faces of the Hunger Problem 30 How. L.J. 193, 194 (1987). Butcher's Approach to Ending Global Hunger Butcher believed that there were two approaches to solving the problem of global hunger, a short-term and long-term approach. The short-term approach is providing food to hungry people and the long-term approach is aiding the country to produce and develop its own food and move towards changing terms of trade.Goler Teal Butcher, Symposium: World Food Day Food and Law Conference: the Legal Faces of the Hunger Problem: FOREWORD : The Relationship of Law to the Hunger Problem 30 How. L.J. 193, 200 (1987). With regard to the long-term approach, Butcher promoted the idea that there is an affirmative duty on the richer or donor countries, \\"to adjust -- insofar as congruent with the needs of their own countries -- the terms of trade so that they are equitable and permit the countries where large groups of hungry peoples exist to have the necessary funds (a) to buy both food and the technological assistance, training and various inputs necessary for them to produce food themselves and (b) to be able to have the financial resources to move forward in their development efforts.\\" The negative duty on donor countries is for them to exclude their agricultural sectors from international negotiations and trade liberalization because of the negative effects of industrialized countries dumping of food surpluses on developing countries, the effect on prices for agricultural products and on country imports.Goler Teal Butcher, Symposium: World Food Day Food and Law Conference: the Legal Faces of the Hunger Problem: FOREWORD : The Relationship of Law to the Hunger Problem 30 How. L.J. 193, 200-01 (1987). In addition to the duty on the donor countries, the developing countries also have a duty to \\"establish new laws, amend existing laws, adapt the administrative and regulatory machinery of the state to effectuate the desired economic and development programs, to implement the priorities of the government generally and with respect to agriculture pricing and marketing patterns, the agriculture sector, foreign exchange rates, both as to food and cash crops through budgetary allocations and national investment policies.\\"Goler Teal Butcher, Symposium: World Food Day Food and Law Conference: the Legal Faces of the Hunger Problem: FOREWORD : The Relationship of Law to the Hunger Problem 30 How.

L.J. 139, 160 (1994).

On Africa of the House of Comm. on International Relations, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 53, 31-32 (1977). In her new position, Butcher testified before Congress in hearings dealing with the inadequacy of small business contracting policies in the Africa Bureau due to contracting barriers constructed during the Ford administration. Butcher believed that AID had a responsibility \\"to assure that contractors exercise equal opportunity employment,\\" See Minority and Small Business Contracting Policies of the Agency for International Development's Africa Bureau: Hearing Before the Subcomm. On Africa of the House of Comm. on International Relations, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 53, at 35 (1977). and this responsibility had been \\"virtually ignored.\\" \\"In addition to compliance with existing law and contracting regulations, Butcher proposed several new initiatives, one of which established the Minority Involvement Office in the Africa Bureau.\\" See Minority and Small Business Contracting Policies of the Agency for International Development's Africa Bureau: Hearing Before the Subcomm. On Africa of the House of Comm. on International Relations, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 53, at 39 (1977). Later that year, \\"Butcher returned to Congress to explain why the U.S. should be more responsive to Africa's development.\\" Butcher called Africa \\"the stepchildren of our foreign assistance program\\" and informed Congress of the minimizing AID assistance since 1962, but was encouraged by the \\"current $155 million in development assistance.\\"Goler T. Butcher, Toward A More Responsive AID Policy for Africa: Hearing Before the Subcomm. On Africa of the House Comm. on International Relations, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 3, 2 (1977). During her address, Butcher outlined initiatives to \\"overcome hunger and malnutrition…[to train] personnel in agricultural skills… [to construct] the rural infrastructure necessary for delivery of inputs and information and the outward movement of produce… [to assist] in the development of educational systems [and to give] greater attention to the geographical allocation of our assistance in terms of common or interrelated problems among the countries of the continent…\\" Goler T. Butcher, Toward A More Responsive AID Policy for Africa: Hearing Before the Subcomm. On Africa of the House Comm. on International Relations, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 3, at 3. Each fiscal year Butcher would \\"map out her imaginative programs and her vision of enlarging the role of AID in assistance programs in Africa\\" to the House Subcommittee. In 1979, Butcher noted that Africa was lagging \\"behind…the rest of the countries in the developing world.\\" Clay Smith, Tribute: United States Foreign Policy and Goler Teal Butcher, 37 How. L.J. 139, 166-67 (1994). She attributed this lag to the geographical isolation of Africa and the shortage of trained manpower, an area AID Africa specifically targeted.Clay Smith, Tribute: United States Foreign Policy and Goler Teal Butcher, 37 How. L.J. 139, 167. In order to avoid falling on deaf ears after her frequent testimonials, Butcher would tie U.S. incentives into reasons why the U.S. should focus on supporting Africa's development programs.

History of turbodrilling  *Among the technical breakthroughs in the world oil industry in the 1920s, a special place is held by the invention in 1922 of the reduction-geared, single-stage downhole turbodrill motor by the Russian engineer Matvei Kapelyushnikov, which opened the way for the subsequent mass introduction of turbodrilling in the industry. *In 1924 the first US Patent was issued to a company called Scharpenberg for the first multi-staged turbodrill. *In 1982 the first steerable turbodrill was developed by a company called Neyrfor. This was steerable because it had a stabilizer that was offset from the rest, pulling the tool to one particular side. Using the law of inertia, one could alter the direction of the hole being drilled by changing the direction of the offset. *In 1992 the first steerable turbodrill using a bent housing was created by Neyrfor. The advantage to using the bent housing method of steering instead of an offset stabilizer, is that it provided a straighter hole with less of a corkscrew effect, which in turn made drilling more efficient, faster, and more accurate. *Continuing traditions of Russian engineer Matvey Kapelyushnikov the company JSC \\"NGT\\" constantly improves designs of turbodrills.  How a turbodrill works  Turbodrills use the mechanical energy of the drill itself, and the hydraulic energy provided by the oil rig’s mud pumps to deliver power to the drill bit. The drill bit on a turbodrill spins much faster than on a conventional motor drill. The result is that, though there is less torque, this is compensated for by the increased speed, which makes straighter holes, and can drill faster and easier through tougher ground materials. The process is very similar to a dental drill used by a dentist. These tools are able to dig faster, operate in a much higher temperature environment, deliver longer downhole life, and produce a better and straighter hole quality than a conventional mud motor. In many applications turbodrills can offer their customers significant cost savings over standard drilling systems by saving them time spent drilling the hole since they typically pay drillers by the hour.

The son of Gü'ün U'a, a Jalair leader who had sworn fealty to the Mongols, he became known by his epithet \\"Muqali\\", \\"one who dulls\\", earned through his committed and able service to the Great Khan and the Mongol Empire. During the invasion of Jin China, Muqali acted as Genghis Khan's second-in-command, and was promoted to Viceroy of China, and was entrusted with a great degree of autonomy once Genghis Khan departed to conquer Central Asia. Unlike many Mongol leaders who were willing to massacre to gain any advantage, Muqali usually attempted to convert foes into friends by more conciliatory means, and change the Mongol image in China.Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan (2015), 231. By the time of Ogedei's reign (1229-1241), he was viewed as the best of the extraordinarily talented pool of Mongol generals.Christopher P. Atwood, Pu'a's Boast and Doqolqu's Death: Historiography of a Hidden Scandal in the Mongol Conquest of the Jin. Given his undefeated record despite very limited resources, he is likely one of the greatest military commanders in history. Life Muqali, third son of Gü'ün U'a, was born into the 'White' clan of the Jalair tribe, who had been the hereditary serfs of the Borjigin Mongols. Originally associated with the Jurkin branch of the Borjigin, Muqali's father and uncles pledged allegiance to Temujin when he defeated the Jurkin in 1197. Gü'ün U'a offered his son Muqali to Temujin as a personal slave (emčü bo'ol).de Rachewiltz, I. (ed.) (1993) In the Service of the Khan, Harrassowitz Verlag, Weisbaden Genghis rewarded the defiant Muqali for his integrity and wisdom, and afterwards was a loyal companion. During the coronation of Genghis Khan, which seems to have been a royalist invention Muqali was given the command of the third tumen and control over the eastern mingghans. In 1211, he played a primary role in the Battle of Yehuling, the decisive battle in the first stage of the Mongol conquest of the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty in northern China. After Genghis Khan decided to go to war with the Khwarazmian Empire, he gave control of all Mongol forces to Muqali and gave him the title of King, a largely ceremonial title. Despite Genghis Khan having most of the main Mongol forces taken away and sent to the West, Muqali was able to subdue most of northern China with his small force of around 20,000 Mongols, although some historians give figures of between 40,000 and 70,000 men to account for his foreign auxilaries. In 1217, Muqali attacked modern-day Hebei Province, northern Shandong Province, and northern Shaanxi Province, controlled by the Jin dynasty. This was an important agricultural area, which Muqali had largely subdued by 1219. In 1220, Muqali turned his attention to the rest of Shandong Province; four towns were captured, but the hard-pressed Jin forces managed to hold on elsewhere in the province. After suffering a number of devastating defeats by Muqali in the field, the Jin learned that they could only hope to resist him by holding their cities and outlasting Muqali's staying power. Muqali's last campaign began in 1222. He crossed the Wei River and attacked south, capturing towns that had already been plundered by a previous Mongol general, Samuqa. Meanwhile, the Jin forces launched a counter-attack in Shanxi Province. Muqali swiftly raced to the area; the Jin forces fled without giving battle. Besieging another town, Muqali became seriously ill and died shortly thereafter in 1223. On his deathbed, Muqali declared with pride that he had never been defeated. After his death, Genghis Khan gave command to Muqali's son, Bol. In seven years of campaigning in northern China, he had reduced the Jin dynasty's territories to only Henan Province. He had proven himself to be an excellent general who was indefatigable in his efforts to serve Genghis Khan. His extraordinary tenure was demonstrated by the inefficacy of other Mongol generals who failed to make any headway in China after his death. By the time of Ogedei's ascension in 1229, the Mongol detachments in China had suffered numerous setbacks, which led to a mini-revival of Jin fortunes until Subutai and Tolui were dispatched with the main Mongol army in 1232. Legacy After his death, descendants of Mukhali served the Great Khan of the Mongols, especially those of the Toluid lineage. A few of his descendants, such as Antong and Baiju, later became prominent officials in the Confucian fashion of the Yuan dynasty founded by Genghis Khan's grandson, Kublai Khan. Retainers of the Toluid Hulagu participated in the conquest of Persia, then called Mollai, and later founded the Jalayirid Dynasty which ruled from Baghdad after the collapse of the Hulaguid Ilkhanate.

This species contains suberitine, a neurotoxin that can cause fatal hemolytic hemorrhaging in various animals. While it is highly toxic to fish, it is known to be preyed upon by the hawksbill turtle, Eretmochelys imbricata. There are currently two accepted subspecies of this taxon: Suberites domuncula domuncula and S. domuncula latus. In 1893, Lambe described a new sponge species as Suberites latus. This was later determined to be a junior synonym of S. domuncula and merged into the species as a subspecies under the scientific name S. domuncula latus. S domuncula is well known for colonizing gastropod shells occupied by hermit crabs. At least 13 species of hermit crabs have been found associated with this sponge.

The callous manner in which the child was murdered shocked the Brazilian public. The murder of \\"João Hélio\\", as it became known in the press, touched a raw nerve with the public. It received substantial coverage in Rio's media and throughout Brazil. It sparked a number of public protests demanding concrete solutions to the manifestations of extreme violence plaguing the city and amendments to the constitution and penal code, seeking to increase the punishment for those perpetrating brutal crimes, and to have greater accountability placed upon adolescents who commit murder.  Carjacking  Six-year-old João Hélio (March 18, 2000 - February 7, 2007) (aged 6) was the only son of Élson Lopes Vieites, and his wife Rosa Cristina Fernandes. They were a middle-class Carioca family living in the Zona Norte (north suburbs) of Rio de Janeiro. During one summer evening, João Hélio was riding in the backseat of his mother's car, a Corsa Sedan, as they drove home from a religious center located in the neighborhood of Bento Ribeiro. Also in the car driven by his mother Rosa, were a family friend and João Hélio's older sister, 13-year-old Aline. As she was driving along João Vicente street (Rua João Vicente) and slowed at a traffic light at the corner of Henrique de Melo street in the Oswaldo Cruz neighborhood shortly after nine o'clock at night, there were already two cars stopped ahead of them. One of these was a taxi out of which three young men suddenly emerged, with two of them pointing handguns. They tapped on the car windows to show that they were metal and not fake. They surrounded the family's car and forced everyone to get out. João Hélio's mother, Rosa, who had been a victim of a street assault before, knew not to resist. She rushed to the backseat to help João Hélio unbuckle his seat belt, but was pushed aside by one of the robbers and the car door slammed onto the seatbelt holding the child, leaving João Hélio's body hanging outside of the car. The thieves then accelerated the vehicle at a high speed. Rosa and Aline chased the car screaming. Murder The assailants drove a circuitous route, through several neighborhoods, dragging João Hélio for a total of 7 km (4.3 miles) before abandoning the car with the child's body still attached to it. The assailants traveled in a mostly southeastern direction, traversing four different neighborhoods: Oswaldo Cruz, Madureira, Campinho, and Cascadura. When they passed in front of two different corner bars on the corners of Cândido Bastos and Silva Gomes, and Barbosa and Florentina streets, patrons were horrified at what they were witnessing and shouted frantically at the car's occupants to stop the car. One man on a motorcycle chased the car to alert them that there was a child being dragged but was threatened with a gun held by the robber sitting in the passenger seat (later identified as 18-year- old Diego Nascimento da Silva). This incident when the gun was flashed occurred along Avenida Intendente Magalhães in the neighborhood of Campinho, which was illuminated with floodlights in preparation for Carnaval. The motorcyclist later testified that once he got up close to the car he could see that João Hélio was already deceased. At the time of the incident, Police Chief Hercules Pires do Nascimento stated that the thieves were well aware that they were dragging a child, and even drove in a zig-zag fashion to try to get rid of him. He added that their demeanor was cold and indifferent. At one point one of the thieves shouted to those attempting to alert them, \\"That's not a child, it's a Judas doll.\\" Witnesses reported seeing the child's body toppled over many times, bouncing against the pavement and the rear wheel, aggravated by numerous speed bumps along the route that the thieves took. After the carjackers reached Bornéu street in Cascadura, they turned off onto small Caiari street, which ends in a dead-end. There they parked the car and according to a resident who recognized the group, after getting out of the car and seeing the child, searched the car for valuables and then calmly disappeared down an alleyway of stairs that exits into Três Lagoas square in Cascadura; leaving João Hélio's mangled body still hanging from the car. After killing the child they went home to have dinner with their parents before attending a local church party. The family of one of the thieves turned them in once they found out the truth. Less than eight hours after the murder they were apprehended by the 30th Precinct of Rio de Janeiro's State Police. The thieves were all under the age of 23. One of them was under 18, the Brazilian age of criminal and civil responsibility for an adult. Details about the five who participated in the crime began to emerge in the media.  Public reaction in Rio  Although Rio had historically suffered a high murder rate for several years prior to the murder, the fact that it was a young child subjected to this treatment struck a nerve among Rio's citizens, particularly in the neighborhoods where the thieves drove. The crime sparked a series of public protests and debates throughout Brazil demanding an end to violence and amendments to the constitution and penal code to increase the punishment of criminals involved in brutal crimes. As details of the crime emerged, there was outrage that the thieves never encountered police during the route that they drove: they passed by a military police station in Campinho, a fire station, an army barracks in Madureira, and several open-air corner bars. The lack of any police presence on the streets allowed the crime to occur without interference by law enforcement. =Homage at Maracanã= Less than a week after João Hélio's death, he was memorialized at a soccer game at Maracanã stadium before a match between Botofogo and Flamengo.Tribute banner by Brazilian soccer fans unfurled before match between Botofogo and Flamengo at Maracanã stadium, Rio de Janeiro, February, 2007. In Portuguese it reads: João Hélio para sempre: O Rio chora por você (João Hélio forever: Rio weeps for you) Cemetery in Jardim Sulacap João Hélio was buried at the Jardim da Saudade cemetery in Sulacap, also the final resting place of murdered Rio journalist Tim Lopes, whose manner of death in 2002 (Lopes was tortured to death by drug traffickers) also shocked the Brazilian public and triggered a cry for change. João Hélio's casket was put into the ground surrounded by various family, relatives and friends. João Hélio's sister called out crying, \\"Little brother, forgive me for not being able to save you! I want my brother. I want my baby. I want to hear his voice.\\" Rio's public security chief, José Mariano Beltrame also attended the burial.  Solidarity march (Zona Norte)  A march occurred on March 10, 2007. Local citizens showed up in solidarity asking for peace and protesting against violence and impunity. The route of the march followed the same trajectory that the thieves had taken in the stolen car, passing through four different neighborhoods and ending at rua Caiari in Cascadura. João Hélio's parents walked front and center in the crowd. Everyone massed at the corner of João Vicente and Henrique de Melo streets where the carjacking occurred. Among the participants that day were workers, retirees, and housewives from the community. It started on Saturday afternoon at 3:30. The sun was unusually hot, magnified by the tropical humidity and asphalt. Local thermometers measured 40 degrees Celsius (104 F). As the procession moved down the streets of the different neighborhoods, spectators noted that even elderly participants who were being affected by the strong sun were not dropping out, but continued the entire 7 km. Many walked carrying signs and banners honoring the child. Front and center of the marchers were João Hélio's parents. Some joined the march along its path, and the word \\"justice!\\" was shouted. João's mother, Rosa Vieites said at the time, \\"It's very painful to walk this path, but our community has given us a lot of strength.\\" One of those who marched explained, \\"The important thing is to show up on the street to march, to speak out, and to learn. We can't just accept being passively massacred by violence and do nothing.\\" According to police estimates, about 500 people participated. During the march, 110 policemen were scattered along the route to provide protection. Rio's public security chief, José Mariano Beltrame participated in the procession. Beltrame commented on the march: \\"The public security can't be put solely on the shoulders of the police forces. What the people are bravely doing in the street is a power of the public that is the very thing that can change the social paradigm of violence. =Repercussion= This march was an act of courage. Only three months after João Hélio's death, on May 1, 2007, two policemen were murdered while patrolling João Vicente street, at the location where the carjacking had originally occurred. Their car was surrounded by armed gang members and sprayed with 30 bullets. The subsequent police response involved invading a large complex of favelas called the Complexo do Alemão (The German Complex) the following month. Sentencing The assailants were sentenced by Judge Marcela Assad Karam on January 30, 2008, a week before the one-year anniversary of João Hélio's murder. Before sentencing, the judge gave a statement. She remarked that the assailants had all the windows rolled down in the car that day, and it would have been impossible to ignore the loud sounds of the child's body hitting against the side of the vehicle. =Profile of assailants= * Carlos Eduardo Toledo de Lima, age 23. Was the ringleader of the group and the driver of the hijacked car. Went by the nickname \\"Dudu\\". He was the last to be taken into custody, and was arrested in Marechal Hermes, which is the neighborhood right next to Bento Ribeiro, where the João Hélio's family had initially been the day of the hijacking. He was the one who announced the highjacking to the victims. Sentenced to 45 years imprisonment. * Diego Nascimento da Silva, age 18. Came out of the taxi pointing a handgun - rode in the passenger seat. Pointed gun at motorcyclist. Lived near the praça (square) where the group parked and left the car. Father gave police information as to where to find him - he was hiding out in a particular hill favela (slum or shantytown) with his 16 yr-old brother and Tiago. Sentenced to 44 years imprisonment. Diego has been imprisoned in penitentiary Bangu 2. Behind bars he had a hustle going with 3 other inmates to use cell phones to make up to 1000 calls per day to random people telling them that they are holding family members hostage and then demanding ransom money. * Ezequiel Toledo de Lima, age 16. Younger brother of the ringleader. He was 16 at the time of the crime, and confessed to being responsible for shutting the car door on the seat-belt. He was the other robber to be carrying a handgun. Released from prison in 2010 at the age of 19, he relocated to another city with the government's assistance, because he had received death threats. (While he was incarcerated, he along with two other juveniles, had attempted to murder a prison guard. He also attempted to escape). The city where he was relocated came to light in March 2012, when at the age of 21, Ezequiel was arrested for drug trafficking and being in possession of a stolen vehicle. He had been living in Iguaba Grande, which is located in the State of Rio de Janeiro in the Região dos Lagos, near Cabo Frio. It is also not far from Araruama, where the government had installed a park honoring João Hélio. * Tiago de Abreu Matos, age 19. Was hiding out in the hillside favela with Diego and Ezequiel Was the driver of the taxi, which was owned by his father. Used taxi to transport the three to do the armed hijacking. Sentenced to 39 years imprisonment. * Carlos Roberto da Silva, age 21. He accompanied Tiago to transport the three robbers to the assault at stoplight. Sentenced to 39 years imprisonment.  Aftermath  The crime intensified the discussion about what should be the “majority age” when judging criminals. The barbaric crime sparked a wave of protest and solidarity in the population, particularly in the neighborhoods that the crime occurred. It led to a general discussion about the trivialization and devaluation of the preciousness of life. João Hélio's death was often cited in the media as an example of barbarity surfacing when street violence becomes endemic and is not sufficiently addressed. =Candelária and downtown march= Hundreds of people, among them victims of crime, families affected by violence in one form or another, and Cariocas fed up with the current state of things participated in a mass at the notable downtown cathedral, the Igreja da Candelária, in the Centro part of Rio. Catholic leader Nixon Bezerra de Brito, mentioned other brutal acts of violence that had occurred in recent years in Rio and declared that João Hélio was \\"a martyr in a city that doesn't know how to respect life.\\" This occurred on Wednesday, February 14, 2007. Following the mass, there was a protest march calling for peace and an end to the violence. The march started with approximately 600 people and as others joined during the procession, the number reached about 1,600 people as they moved down Avenida Rio Branco. =Recognition by Samba schools= Several samba schools paid homage to João Hélio during the 2007 carnaval procession in Rio's Sambadrome. The samba school, Estácio de Sá, entered the Sambadrome asking for a minute of silence in homage to João Hélio. Next, the samba school Mocidade Independente de Padre Miguel, also paid respects to João Hélio before beginning the procession of the bateria (drum corps procession). Porto da Pedra unveiled a banner memorializing the child. Mangueira incorporated choreography by Carlinhos de Jesus in which participants were used to form the letters of João Hélio's name. =Parks dedicated to child= Rio's governor, Sérgio Cabral, named a new, large park after João Hélio in the city of Araruama, which is 118 km (73 miles) from Rio de Janeiro. Called Parque Menino João Hélio, the park was dedicated to his memory with plaques and sculptures. One of the plaques is written with the exhortation: \\"Dei a minha vida, em troca peço PAZ! -João Hélio (I have given my life, in exchange, I ask for peace!). The park has various life size sculptures by artist Luiz Costa that show the trajectory of the short life of João Hélio. Photos that were taken to capture the events of the park's inauguration also captured the profound sadness evident in the faces of João Hélio's parents. Rio's municipal government changed the name of a tiny square near where João Hélio's body was found in the neighborhood of Cascadura. Originally called Praça Três Lagoas, it was renamed Praça João Hélio Fernandes Vieites by Rio Mayor César Maia. A small playground was subsequently installed at the site.

The viaduct crosses the Luxulyan Valley, and with it forms an integral part of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape, a World Heritage Site. It is scheduled under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 and due to its poor condition is on Historic England's, Heritage at Risk Register. History In 1813, Joseph Austen inherited the estates of the Treffry family on the death of his mother's brother (he changed his name to Treffry in 1838). He began to develop the assets, particularly the mineral wealth, and saw that the Luxulyan Valley was a convenient route between the south coast and the high ground in mid Cornwall. He built a new artificial harbour, completed in 1829, at Par, a canal up the valley to Ponts Mill and an inclined plane railway to the Fowey Consols mine on Penpillick Hill. To bring water power to the mine he built a leat from Luxulyan along the west side of the valley. He also acquired the moribund port of Newquay and land and mines in the area of Goss Moor, and planned to link them by a railway system. Work began in 1835 on a tramway up the valley, but Austen and his steward William Pease realised that it was not going to meet their ambitions, so it was abandoned and only a few fragments of the route are visible today. Instead, they built a much larger-scale tramway, with the inclined plane from the canal basin, past the Carmears Rocks, to the level of the top of the valley, then a level run through Luxulyan and on to its terminus at the Bugle Inn near Mollinis. This required a high-level crossing of the river, for which they built the great viaduct, 650 feet (198 m) long and 100 feet (30 m) high, the most advanced engineering project in the western peninsula. It was built of stone from the Carbeans and Colcerrow quarries, and the lines from the quarries to the viaduct were the first parts of the tramway to be operational. The tramway was completed in 1844. The viaduct carried both rails and a water channel to bring more water for the Fowey Consols, and this is where the quality of the design and construction becomes apparent. The level of a waterway must be precisely correct, or the water will not flow. On its way down, the water was used to power the Carmears incline, by means of a water wheel, 34 feet (10 m) in diameter. This enabled the tramway to work loads up the incline, against gravity. The last improvement Joseph Treffry made was a continuation of the railway alongside the canal to Par Harbour, but this was not completed until after his untimely death in 1850. Two more granite quarries were at work within the Valley, Rock Mill and Orchard. In 1870 the South Cornwall Granite company opened a railway linking these to Ponts Mill. This is what we now call the Valley Floor Tramway - the Treffry era railways, all horse-worked, were later called tramways to distinguish them from later locomotive-powered lines. The quarries were worked until about 1928; the last stone came from Carbeans in 1933 and the last of Treffry's rails were removed in 1940. In 1872 a group of London businessmen began a massive rebuild of Treffry's tramways to enable them to exploit the ironstone deposits near Newquay. They constructed a new route through the Valley, which left the old one below Ponts Mill, ascended the west side of the Valley, crossed the River Par twice on the Ponts Mill and Rock Mill Viaducts, passed under the Treffry Viaduct, approached Luxulyan through a tunnel and rejoined the old route at Luxulyan railway station. The new consortium was called the Cornwall Minerals Railway. Visiting It is free to visit the viaduct and open all year round. It can be walked across and viewed from across the valley. There is car parking at the bottom of the valley at Ponts Mill which is just off the A390 road at Porcupine, or at the top of the valley just north of the Treffry Viaduct, where there is a junction. There are also many walks to the viaduct from St Blazey village and from Luxulyan railway station on the Newquay branch line which passes beneath the viaduct. Film and television The BBC television programme Seven Man Made Wonders, which was broadcast in 2006, featured the viaduct. The viaduct was used as a location in the film Omen III: The Final Conflict. The viaduct was visited By Geoff Marshall and his wife Vicki Pipe on day 2 of the 2017 web-documentary series All the Stations.

Previous MP The seat had become vacant on when the constituency's Conservative Party Member of Parliament (MP), Sir Nicholas Grattan-Doyle, had resigned from Parliament on 10 April, aged 77. He been the constituency's MP since its creation for the 1918 general election. Candidates During World War II, unopposed by-elections were common, since the major parties had agreed not to contest by-elections when vacancies arose in seats held by the other parties; contests occurred only when independent candidates or minor parties chose to stand. In keeping with the agreement, neither the local Labour Party and Liberal Party fielded a candidate in Newcastle North. The Conservative Party candidate was Henry Grattan-Doyle, whose selection split the local Conservative Association. A group broke away to form the Newcastle North (1940) Conservative Association, and they fielded Sir Cuthbert Headlam as an \\"Independent Conservative\\" candidate. Headlam had been MP for Barnard Castle from 1924 to 1929 and from 1931 to 1935, and had held several junior ministerial posts. He had also contested the Gateshead by- election in 1931, coming a close second in what had been a safe seat for Labour. Results On a very low turnout, the result was an overwhelming victory for Headlam, who took 71% of the votes. Returned to the House of Commons, he promptly took the Conservative Whip, and held the seat as a Conservative until he retired from Parliament at the 1951 election.

He was the originator of horsemanship acts and proprietor of Astley's Amphitheatre . Life and career Ducrow was trained by his father, who had immigrated to England from Belgium in 1793. Ducrow performed within the United Kingdom and in Europe, including in famous venues such as Covent Garden and Drury Lane. He is perhaps best known as the proprietor of Astley's Amphitheatre, where he was also the chief performer. Referred to by some as \\"the Chippendales of his day,\\" Ducrow and his sons would dress in \\"fleshings\\" (flesh-coloured body stockings) to perform physique poses called plastiques, while standing upon the rumps of white stallions cantering round the amphitheatre. Pablo Fanque, the black circus equestrian and later circus owner, best known from his mention in The Beatles song \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\" on the album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, worked in Ducrow's circus for some time.\\"The Illustrated London News,\\" March 20, 1847. Ducrow's shows proved immensely popular. Unfortunately, the Amphitheatre succumbed three times to fire. After the third time in 1841, Ducrow collapsed from a mental breakdown and died shortly thereafter in 1842. William Batty took over management of Astley's Amphitheatre and an employee of Ducrow called Joseph Hillier took over Ducrow's circus company.The Life and Art of Andrew Ducrow by A.H. Saxon Legacy Ducrow is buried on the Main (or Centre) Avenue at Kensal Green Cemetery in London, England, one of the most desirable burial plots of the time. His tomb is one of the largest and most decorated tombs within the cemetery. The decoration is primarily pagan, being drawn from Greek and Egyptian sources. There is no Christian-inspired decoration. The tomb was designed by Ducrow's theatrical designer and originally was brightly painted in pastel hues to attract the eye. These have faded over time. The \\"Courier of St. Petersburg\\", his most famous act, was the forerunner to modern horse acts and is still performed today at equestrian events.

The fleet of 405 cars first entered service in 2011, replacing the M2, M4 and M6 cars, which entered service in 1973, 1987 and 1994, respectively. An additional 60-car order is currently under construction in response to increased ridership; some cars are also planned for use on Shore Line East. Design third rail shoe The M8 is similar in design to the M7 car used on the Harlem Line and the Hudson Line. Like the M7, the M8 is able to pick up 750 Volt DC direct current power from underrunning third rail for operation along the New Haven Line from Grand Central Terminal to Pelham, where the traction power source is transferred to the overhead catenary wire. The overhead wire is at a nominal 12.5 kV AC power from overhead lines via pantographs for operation from Pelham, New York to New Haven, Connecticut (as well as along the New Canaan Branch), and 25 kV AC power from catenary for operation along the Shore Line East route east of New Haven to New London, Conn. Unlike in earlier classes, changeover between the two AC voltages can be made by the engineer while on the move. In response to rising number of people seeking to use their bicycle to solve the \\"last mile\\" problem between Metro-North stations and destinations, ConnDOT has pledged to provide bike racks for storage of two bicycles in the disabled riders area of each rail car. In the event that a disabled rider boards a car, all cyclists must move their bicycles to the entry vestibule. In spite of the hook installation, during peak travel periods only folding bicycles are permitted aboard most Metro North trains. The M8s have new roomier, high-back seats with individual headrests and curved arm rests for more comfort. For improved safety, especially in the vestibules, the cars have larger windows and better lighting. An additional safety feature is the installation of intercom systems that customers can use to contact the train crew in case of emergency. Other features included curved luggage racks, coat hooks, electrical outlets to charge personal devices, and LED displays that show that next stop and automated announcements. The cars also have external public address speakers, and electronic destination signs. Higher reliability is possible with single leaf doors, which also lessen the susceptibility to snow intrusion. Also, the M8s have sealed alternating current motors that are less susceptible to weather. The M8s have regenerative braking; each time that the cars go into braking mode, the cars feed back power into the catenary system. The M8's are equipped with contact shoes that can operate on both Metro-North's under- running and the LIRR over-running third rail. The exterior design of the new M8 rail car is red, in keeping with the traditional exterior color of the New Haven Line rail cars. The body shape is similar to the M7 rail cars that are in operation on the Hudson and Harlem lines. Delivery schedule Four new M8 cars being shipped by CSX through Ohio in 2014 In August 2006, the contract for the M8s was awarded to Kawasaki Rail Car. The Connecticut Department of Transportation and Metro–North Railroad awarded the contract for the M8s to Kawasaki Rail Car in August 2006 for $706.3 million. The contract included 380 cars, of which 210 would be in the base order, and an option order of 90 cars. 65% of the cost was paid by Connecticut, while the remaining 35% was paid by Metro–North. Later on, two additional option orders were added; the first consisted of 42 cars and the second consisted of 38 cars. Full production of the M8's was scheduled to begin in early 2010 but was then delayed. Kawasaki cited problems with steel suppliers and sub-contractors (which is responsible for 60% of the cars). Once production reached full output the cars were delivered at a rate of ten per month. The first M8s were supposed to be delivered in late 2009. In December 2010, the first 24 cars were received and began to undergo testing. The cars were originally supposed to go into revenue service in December 2010, however, because of technical problems, revenue service was deferred until March 1, 2011. The first run of the initial eight- car set (consisting of cars 9114, 9115, 9116, 9117, 9112, 9113, 9108, and 9109) originated in Stamford at 10:30 am, arriving in Grand Central Terminal at 11:28 am. A total of ten eight-car train sets were slated to enter service by the end of the year. On May 7, 2011, Kawasaki announced that deliveries of 20 cars of the 80 scheduled to enter service by the end of the year would be delayed due to supply problems; Kawasaki said it would build the cars at a later date and absorb the costs incurred. At the time of the announcement, 16 cars had entered service, with an additional ten delivered but not yet in service. Two months later, an investigative report by WABC-TV's news operation examined correspondence between Kawasaki and Metro-North over the delays in introducing the cars. At the time it had been claimed the cars merely had software problems, but the documents reporters obtained under New York's Freedom of Information Law showed Kawasaki repeatedly asking for deadline extensions over issues such as bad weather and financial difficulties at the company that supplied the onboard toilets. Railroad officials complained in emails reviewed by the channel that some of the requests \\"defie[d] logic\\" and were a waste of time. Kawasaki said such multiple delays were \\"not unusual given the complexity of the cars and suppliers\\" and were often beyond their control. An unpowered single car at New Haven Yard in 2018 On July 20, 2011, the Connecticut Department of Transportation announced the order of 25 unpowered M8 railcars, with options for up to 25 more, at a cost of $93 million to provide additional service. The new cars are single cars, allowing for one car, instead of two, to be added to an additional train, which is an efficient way to add capacity to meet ridership growth. They were also intended to replace the 48 car M6 fleet. On October 16, 2012, Metro-North announced that they would be installing 15 weekday and 30 weekend M8 trains to their schedule to accommodate increased ridership. Damaged M8 cars in Bridgeport yard two weeks after the Fairfield train crash On May 17, 2013, several cars were damaged in a train accident in Fairfield, Connecticut. Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut credited the M8 railcars' design with potentially saving lives. On January 29, 2014, the MTA board approved a miscellaneous procurement to purchase three additional M8 cars (one pair and one additional B car; to replace cars lost in the Fairfield Crash), twelve car trucks, spare parts, additional bench test equipment and repairs to four additional M8s. Of the total cost of $36 million, $8.4 million will be funded by a credit from Kawasaki in the original contract. The remainder will be funded by Metro-North and ConnDOT. The original order of 405 cars was completed on July 13, 2015, except for the 25 unpowered cars on option. Of the 380 original cars, the first 38 cars were built in Kobe, Japan, while the remaining 342 were built at Kawasaki's plant in Lincoln, Nebraska. The purchase of the M8s was based on ridership growth forecasts, and it was not anticipated that additional train cars would need to be purchased until the 2020–2024 MTA Capital Program. However, increased ridership required additional cars to be purchased. Currently, 24 existing cars are intended to be use for service on Shore Line East. On September 13, 2016, Connecticut governor Dannel Malloy announced plans for the state to purchase 60 additional M8 cars, funded by $200 million from the state and $108 million from the MTA, with delivery beginning in 2019. The cars cost $3.85 million apiece for a total of $231 million; the remaining cost covers other expenses like inspections plus a 15% contingency. Ten of the cars will be bar cars, similar to those of the former M2 fleet retired in 2014. In November 2016, the MTA announced that 60 additional cars would be purchased, with an option order of 34 cars. The cars were expected to enter service in three years, allowing the railroad to lengthen rush hour trains, retire the last M2s, and to have flexibility to increase train service with increasing ridership. The bar cars were later dropped, due to cost and train capacity concerns, as well as Metro- North not being willing to handle the bar themselves, wishing for an outside company to run the operation itself. Testing of M8 cars on the Shore Line East route began in February 2017. As of January 2019, M8s provide all service on the New Haven Line, after the retirement of the last remaining M2 cars at the end of December 2018.

It is at the very northern tip of Cape Brett in the Bay of Islands. It is Māori freehold land, which is administered by the Motu Kōkako Ahu Whenua Trust for the benefit of the descendants of the traditional owners. The island is of great cultural significance to the Ngāpuhi iwi (tribe), and was historically associated with a range of sacred customary activities. Motu Kōkako was said to be the landing place of the canoe Tūnui-a-rangi before it went to Ngunguru and Whangarei. It brings to mind the (proverb) (\\"the rock standing in the sea\\"). This refers to a person who stands against all adversity, just as a rock resists the power of the sea. It is probably the most important island in the Bay of Islands in conservation terms, being in near pristine condition, with no evidence of introduced animals. A 1987 survey of the island found 99 different types of flora, and noted the presence of two types of petrels and lizards. Captain Cook named the island \\"Piercy Island\\" in honour of one of the Lords of the Admiralty. The 'Hole in the Rock', the local tourist attraction The hole at sea level was created over centuries by wind and waves making it one of the most naturally beautiful sites in New Zealand. Being a popular tourist destination there are a multitude of tours offered and if the waters are calm and the tide is right the jet boats will go right through the hole. There are also helicopter tours to the island. The use of the island by tourist boat operators has been the subject of a long running dispute, with tourism companies taking boats through the Hole in the Rock but not paying a share of the takings to the island's owners. Apart from a short period between 1989 – 1992, the owners of the island have received no royalties from the boat operators. Offers by the operators to work together with Motu Kōkako Ahu Whenua Trust were declined. A Treaty of Waitangi claim (Wai 2022) has been lodged by the Motu Kōkako Ahu Whenua Trust and is currently being considered. There is no dispute between the owners and the helicopter tour operators Salt Air. The Trust and Salt Air have signed a joint tourism venture agreement, under which Salt Air pays a levy for each visitor to the island in recognition of the owners' rights.

The type material, consisting of teeth, was used by British palaeontologist Richard Owen to name the species S. cultridens in 1841. Later in 1897, French palaeontologist Henri-Émile Sauvage named a second species, S. girardi, based on two fragments from the mandible and one tooth discovered in Portugal. Suchosaurus is possibly a senior synonym of the contemporary spinosaurid Baryonyx, but is usually considered a dubious name due to the paucity of its remains. In the Wadhurst Clay Formation of what is now southern England, Suchosaurus lived alongside other dinosaurs, as well as plesiosaurs, mammals, and crocodyliforms. History of discovery In about 1820, British palaeontologist Gideon Mantell acquired teeth discovered near Cuckfield in the Wadhurst Clay of East Sussex, part of a lot with the present inventory number BMNH R36536. In 1822, he reported these, after an identification by William Clift, as belonging to crocodiles.Mantell, G.A., 1822, The fossils of the South Downs or Illustrations of the Geology of Sussex, London, Rupton Relfe In 1824, the teeth were mentioned and illustrated by Georges Cuvier, representing the first fossil illustration of a spinosaurid dinosaur (though this group wouldn't be recognized for nearly another century).Cuvier, G., 1824, Recherches sur les ossemens fossiles, deuxième édition. Dufour & d’Ocagne, Paris. 547 pp In 1827 Mantell described additional teeth, pointing out the similarities to the crocodilians Teleosaurus and Gavialis.Mantell, G.A., 1827, Illustrations of the geology of Sussex, London, Lupton Relfe. 92 pp One of these teeth is the present specimen BMNH R4415, others are part of BMNH R36536. In 1841, British palaeontologist Richard Owen named, based on BMNH R36536 as a syntype series, a subgenus Crocodylus (Suchosaurus) with as type species Crocodylus (Suchosaurus) cultridens.Owen, R. (1840–1845). Odontography. London: Hippolyte Baillière, 655 pp, 1–32 The subgeneric name was derived from Greek σοῦχος, souchos, the name of the Egyptian crocodile god Sobek. This reflected the presumed taxonomic affinities; at the time the crocodile-like snouts of spinosaurids were not known. The specific name is derived from Latin culter, \\"dagger\\", and dens, \\"tooth\\", in reference to the elongated form of the teeth. In 1842, Owen again mentioned the taxon as a subgenus,Owen, R., 1842, Report on British fossil reptiles. Part II. Reports of the meetings of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. 11, pp 61-204 subsequently he and other workers would use it as a full genus Suchosaurus. In 1842 and 1878 Owen referred some vertebrae (backbones) to Suchosaurus,Owen, R., 1878, Monograph on the fossil Reptilia of the Wealden and Purbeck Formations. Supplement VIII, (Goniopholis, Petrosuchus, and Suchosaurus). Palaeontolographical Society Monographs, 32, pp 1-15 but these were later identified by Richard Lydekker as likely belonging to ornithischian dinosaurs instead. In 1884, Owen indicated a tooth as \\"Suchosaurus leavidens\\" in a caption,*Owen, R., 1884, A History of British Fossil Reptiles, Volume II. Cassell, London. 224 pp this is usually seen as a lapsus calami (or \\"slip of the pen\\") because this species is not further mentioned. Type mandible and tooth of S. girardi In 1897, French palaeontologist Henri-Émile Sauvage named a second species: Suchosaurus girardi, based on two jaw fragments (specimen MG324) and a tooth, found in the Papo Seco Formation of Portugal by Swiss-Portuguese geologist Paul Choffat. The specific name honours French geologist Albert Girard.Sauvage, H. E. (1897–1898). Vertébrés fossiles du Portugal. Contribution à l’étude des poissons et des reptiles du Jurassique et du Crétacique. Lisbonne: Direction des Travaux géologiques du Portugal, 46p The tooth was considered lost but was rediscovered and in 2013 reported as specimen MNHN/UL.I.F2.176.1, part of remains recovered after a fire in 1978.Malafaia, E.; Ortega, F.; Escaso, F.; Mocho, P., 2013, \\"Rediscovery of a lost portion of the holotype of Suchosaurus girardi (Sauvage, 1897-98), now related to the spinosaurid theropod Baryonyx\\", In: Torcida Fernández-Baldor, F.; Huerta, P. (Eds.). Abstract book of the VI International Symposium about Dinosaurs Palaeontology and their Environment pp 82-84 During the nineteenth and most of the twentieth century, Suchosaurus was usually considered to have been some obscure crocodilian, perhaps belonging to the Pholidosauridae.Buffetaut, E., 2010, \\"Spinosaurs before Stromer: Early finds of spinosaurid dinosaurs and their interpretations\\", Geological Society, London, Special Publications. 343, pp 175-188 Single comparable teeth discovered in England were referred to the genus.Lydekker, R., 1888, Catalogue of the Fossil Reptilia and Amphibia in the British Museum (Natural History), Cromwell Road, S.W., Part 1. Containing the Orders Ornithosauria, Crocodilia, Dinosauria, Squamata, Rhynchocephalia, and Proterosauria. British Museum of Natural History, London. 309 pp However, when publishing a redescription of Baryonyx in 1998, British palaeontologist Angela Milner realised that the teeth of that spinosaurid dinosaur were extremely similar to those of Suchosaurus. In 2003, she suggested both genera represented one and the same animal.Milner, A., 2003, \\"Fish-eating theropods: A short review of the systematics, biology and palaeobiogeography of spinosaurs\\". In: Huerta Hurtado and Torcida Fernandez-Baldor (eds.). Actas de las II Jornadas Internacionales sobre Paleontologýa de Dinosaurios y su Entorno (2001). pp 129-138 An identity would imply the name Suchosaurus has priority. However, the Suchosaurus teeth are also indistinguishable from those of Cristatusaurus and Suchomimus, making it an indeterminate baryonychine. Skeletal reconstruction of Baryonyx, which might be a junior synonym of Suchosaurus, Japan In 2007, French palaeontologist Eric Buffetaut considered the teeth of S. girardi very similar to those of Baryonyx (and S. cultridens) except for the stronger development of the ribs (lengthwise ridges) on the tooth crown, suggesting that the remains belonged to the same genus. Buffetaut agreed with Milner that the teeth of S. cultridens were almost identical to those of B. walkeri, but with a ribbier surface. The former taxon might be a senior synonym of the latter (since it was published first), depending on whether the differences were within a taxon or between different ones. According to Buffetaut, since the holotype specimen of S. cultridens is one worn tooth and that of B. walkeri is a skeleton it would be more practical to retain the newer name.Buffetaut, E. (2007). \\"The spinosaurid dinosaur Baryonyx (Saurischia, Theropoda) in the Early Cretaceous of Portugal.\\" Geological Magazine, 144(6): 1021-1025. In 2011, Portuguese palaeontologist Octávio Mateus and colleagues agreed that Suchosaurus was closely related to Baryonyx, but considered both species in the former genus (Suchosaurus) nomina dubia (dubious names) since their holotype specimens were not considered diagnostic (lacking distinguishing features) and could not be definitely equated with other taxa.  Description  In 2012, American vertebrate palaeontologist Thomas R. Holtz Jr. tentatively estimated Suchosaurus at around in length and weighing between .Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2011) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages, Winter 2010 Appendix. And in 2016, Spanish palaeontologists Molina-Pérez and Larramendi estimated S. cultridens at approximately long, tall at the hips and weighing . The teeth of Suchosaurus girardi were curved, oval in cross section, and had tall roots that were one and a half times taller than the crown. Its teeth, like some other spinosaurids, bore flutes (lengthwise grooves), in S. girardi, there were eight flutes on the lingual side (which faced the inside of the mouth), and four less distinct flutes on the labial side (which faced the outside of the mouth). The tooth enamel, or outermost layer, had a microscopic wrinkled texture.  Palaeoecology  The Wadhurst Clay Formation, part of the Wealden Group, is dated to the Valanginian stage of the Early Cretaceous Period, about 139.8 to 132.9 million years ago.Hopson, P.M., Wilkinson, I.P. and Woods, M.A. (2010) A stratigraphical framework for the Lower Cretaceous of England.

It borders the James Peak Wilderness to the south, and straddles the Continental Divide. The area receives high visitation due to its proximity to the Denver metropolitan area. Geography The area encompasses a stretch of the Front Range. It includes 7 peaks over in elevation. The highest point is North Arapaho Peak at . The peaks are all within of elevation of each other. A portion of the area, encompassing the headwaters of North Boulder Creek, is closed to the public as it is the City of Boulder watershed. Peak names Many of the peaks inside the wilderness area are named after western Native American tribes. The naming scheme was the idea of botany teacher Ellsworth Bethel. By 1914, few of the peaks between Longs Peak and the Arapaho Peaks had names. In the spring of that year Bethel, inspired by the established name of the Arapaho Peaks, settled on 11 tribal names for various summits along the Divide. The United States Board on Geographic Names kept 6 of his names: Apache Peak, Arikaree Peak, Kiowa Peak, Navajo Peak, Ogalalla Peak and Pawnee Peak. He later added Paiute Peak, as his use of the Ute band was denied due to too many other Colorado features sharing that name. Other names, including Shoshoni Peak, Hiamovi Mountain, Satanta Peak and Watanga Mountain were added later. Achonee Mountain in the Indian Peaks Wilderness was named after Cheyenne Peace Chief Ochinee, who negotiated for peace for his tribe and was killed in the Sand Creek massacre. History The Indian Peaks were visited by Native Americans for several thousand years. The Arapaho tribe lived and hunted in the area during the summer months, though little evidence remains of their activities. Mining took place in the 1870s near the Arapaho Peaks. Later, a road was built to Arapaho Pass but never completed. (It is now the hiking trail that leads west from the Fourth of July trailhead.) The mining turned up little more than low-grade ore, and the mines were eventually abandoned. Remnants of mining activity is still found along the Arapaho Pass trail. Arapaho Glacier (now owned by the city of Boulder) is one of a few glaciers still left within the Indian Peaks Wilderness, but, being a part of Boulder's watershed, is off limits to hiking/camping. Several glaciers however, are still hikable and there are a number of routes to take. One set of glaciers, the Isabelle and Fair glaciers have a connecting trail that will send you over the Continental Divide. Isabelle & Fair glaciers were discovered by Mr. Fair in 1904 and were given their names by Prof. Junius Henderson, formerly of the University, who made a study of the glaciers in 1910 at Mr. Fair's request. Mr. Fair believed that water sometime would be run through a tunnel from the Western Slope into Four Mile canyon, that Boulder and the mountain region would continue to grow in popularity, that some day Boulder will have to build a storage dam lower down that those in the Arapahoe glacier region and that a road to the Arapahoe or some other glacier will be constructed and become the most popular drive in the state. The Denver and Interurban Company, which operated an electric line between Boulder and Denver for many years adopted the name \\"Glacier Route\\" at Mr. Fair's suggestion. The figure 8 trails in the Arapahoe and Buchanan pass areas were made largely on the suggestion of Mr. Fair. In January of 1948, a plane carrying three airmen of the Civil Aeronautics Administration crashed about 500 feet below the summit of Navajo Peak due to severe turbulence. After four months and a five day expedition, a team of Denver and Boulder mountaineers recovered their bodies, reporting devastation to the mountainside. The wreckage of the plane is still present and visible in summer. The area of the Indian Peaks was included in Enos Mills' original proposed boundaries for Rocky Mountain National Park. They were removed from the proposal after compromising with local and mining interests. Park superintendents tried to annex the Indian Peaks over the years, but the area would not receive protected status until 1978 when Congress designated the Indian Peaks Wilderness Area. Activities Most visitors hike along the many trails, visiting high passes, lakes and waterfalls en route. The area also contains many notable mountaineering routes. The busiest area is Brainard Lake, which hosts several trailheads and a campground. Fishing is also found in many of the lakes and streams within the wilderness. In the winter, snowshoeing and cross country skiing are popular. Mechanized recreation, such as mountain biking and the use of motorized vehicles, is prohibited in the Indian Peaks Wilderness.

During his tenure as defense minister, he launched several major reforms of the Russian military. Since October 2015 he works as an Industrial Director for Rostec State corporation. Early life and education Born at Krasnodar Krai on 8 January 1962, Serdyukov graduated from Leningrad Institute of Soviet Trade in 1984 with a degree in economics. From 1984 to 1985 he served in the Soviet Army. Since 1985 he had worked in a furniture shop and from 1995 to 2000 was the director general of Furniture Market, a furniture company in Saint Petersburg. Serdyukov's career started to develop very successfully after the election of Vladimir Putin as Russian President in 2000. In 2001, Serdyukov graduated from the Law Department of Saint Petersburg State University. Career From 2000 to 2001 Serdyukov served as deputy chief of the Saint Petersburg Directorate of the Tax Ministry of Russia. From 2001 to 2004 he led the directorate, succeeding Viktor Zubkov, his father-in-law. On 2 March 2004, he was appointed deputy tax minister of Russia. From 2004 to 2007 he led the tax ministry (in July 2004 reorganized into the Federal Tax Service of Russia). During this period, the key officials of the service were replaced mainly by Serdyukov's colleagues from Saint Petersburg. He also often resorted to personnel rotation and appointment of former federal tax officials to the regional tax service departments in the federal subjects of Russia. During his tenure, court decisions in favour of the federal tax service became much more common. While the service was formally subordinate to the finance ministry under Alexey Kudrin, in fact Serdyukov very much leaned towards Presidential aide Viktor Ivanov. On 15 February 2007, President Vladimir Putin appointed Serdyukov as Defense Minister of the Russian Federation, with the main task of fighting corruption and inefficiency in the Russian armed forces.Russia: A New model Army Newsweek This started the conflict, that would last through Serdyukov time as Defense Minister with the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation since General Staff considered appointment of a civilian, with no remarkable military background and former furniture dealer as an insult. To sharpen the conflict, Head of General Staff at the time Yuri Baluyevsky demanded that the new defence minister would have to spend 1 month in General Staff at \\"preparation training\\" to have an idea of the \\"job in hand\\". On 14 September 2007 Serdyukov offered his resignation to the president over family relations with Viktor Zubkov, but this resignation was not accepted. However before Putin responded, Baluyevsky did support the publicly the resignation of Serdyukov and stated that \\"the next defence minister could be a woman\\". In Russian cultural context, this is an insult, not sign of progressive and liberal thinking. After Putin rejected resignation of Serdyukov, Serdyukov retaliated by organising an audit and inspection how the senior members of General Staff did manage with the mandatory physical requirements test for armed forces members. Most of them failed and hence created a storm in a Russian media.https://maailm.postimees.ee/1811545/diivanikaupmees-seljatas- kindrali According to Russian newspapers Serdyukov received the honorable title of Hero of Russia by a March 2012 secret order of President Dmitry Medvedev. Serdkuyov was sacked by Putin on 6 November 2012 and replaced by Sergei Shoigu. In November 2013 Serdkuyov was charged by Russian investigators with \\"negligence\\" for ordering the army to build a road from a village to a private country residence in Russia's south. He was amnestied in 2014 by a presidential decree. In October 2015 he was appointed as an Industrial Director of Rostec State Corporation. His duties include supervising of all the company's aviation-related activities from helicopter-building to airplane engines. =Activities= In office, Serdyukov chose not to get involved in the daily administration of troops and operational-strategic planning, leaving these matters to the professionals. Instead, he focused on organizational and budgetary issues, in which he, according to Moscow Defense Brief, \\"insisted upon an unprecedented (at least for the MoD) level of precision and fastidiousness.\\" This reportedly enabled him to quickly \\"put the generals in their place,\\" and \\"to instill a level of background fear that even the old- timers do not recall having seen before.\\" According to an anecdote, an officer in one of the central directorates of the MoD explained: \\"senior generals go to meetings of the Defense Board as to the scaffold.\\" To deal with the budgetary issues, Serdyukov brought in his old colleagues from the Federal Tax Service and created new department in MoD for financial control. MoD had no control nor oversight until then over the management of defence budget. This had all been managed so far by the General Staff. Years before Serdyukov's appointment as Minister of Defence, the Russian defence budget had been growing significantly but the extra amounts disappeared on regular basis and were not visible anywhere. Apparently bringing this under control was the first and most important reason why Serdyukov was considered and appointed as Minister of Defence.https://diplomaatia.ee/diivanikaupmees-seljatas-kindrali/ According to Moscow Defense Brief, Serdyukov’s first year in office was marked by convulsions, \\"the likes of which have not been seen on the Arbat in decades.\\" The magazine pointed out, that \\"Serdyukov brought apparently unlimited energy to a thorough purge of the department.\\" He fired almost a third of the top officers of the Central Military Administration and initiated a sea of change in the Ministry of Defense. During his time in office, Serdyukov has launched several wide-reaching reforms. The main idea behind his reforms was the transformation from a mass mobilization army to a small force of contract soldiers. In 2010, Serdyukov launched a $430 billion military reform to be achieved over the next 15 years in order to fully re-equip Russian conventional forces. Serdyukov also launched plans to reduce the personnel in the central administration by 30%, which would lead to the liquidation of a significant number of positions filled by generals and colonels. He was demanding drastic cuts in Russia's officer corps. There was an officer to every two and a half men. After the reform there should be just one to every 15, more similar to western armies. The reform would mean losing 200,000 jobs, and has been met with fierce political opposition by the \\"old guard.\\" Because of the pressure, the deadline for implementing the cuts was put back from 2012 to 2016. Army divisions were disbanded and replaced by brigades. The six military districts of Russia were replaced by 4 geographic commands. Addressing acute and long-standing issues such as the ineffectiveness of Russia’s defense industrial and procurement policies was also one of Serdyukov's chief aims. The questions addressed included: \\"why, with so much spending on defense, do the Armed Forces possess so little new equipment? Why does the design and testing of many new types of armament take decades to show results?\\" Serdyukov initiated modifications to the Russian military uniform and addressed the issue of the physical condition of Russia’s generals and senior officers: the entire service personnel of the General Staff, irrespective of rank, must now meet set physical standards upon threat of dismissal. He also called for mergers of Military academies, sharp cuts in the number of military bases, and reductions in rear support and noncombat units. Many of Serdyukov's reforms and anti-corruption measures were met with open opposition and led to many dismissals. His actions, however, gave him a positive image in the eyes of the Russian public. Severe disagreements were reported in late 2007 and early 2008 between Serdyukov and General of the Army Yuri Baluyevsky, Chief of the General Staff, most recently over the Minister's proposed move of the Russian Navy Main Staff from Moscow to Saint Petersburg.Chloe Arnold, Russia: Resignation Signals Trouble Within Defense Ministry, RFE/RL, March 2008, and NVO, General Affront (Ru) Later, this was proved by following Baluyevsky's resignation.

Snow tires, also known as winter tires, are tires designed for use on snow and ice. Snow tires have a tread design with larger gaps than those on conventional tires, increasing traction on snow and ice. Such tires that have passed a specific winter traction performance test are entitled to display a \\"Three-Peak Mountain Snow Flake\\" symbol on their sidewalls. Tires designed for winter conditions are optimized to drive at temperatures below . Some snow tires have metal or ceramic studs that protrude from the tire to increase traction on hard-packed snow or ice. Studs abrade dry pavement, causing dust and creating wear in the wheel path. Regulations that require the use of snow tires or permit the use of studs vary by country in Asia and Europe, and by state or province in North America. All-season tires have tread gaps that are smaller than snow tires and larger than conventional tires. They are quieter than winter tires on clear roads, but less capable on snow or ice. Roadway conditions in winter Snow tires operate on a variety of surfaces, including pavement (wet or dry), mud, ice, or snow. The tread design of snow tires is adapted primarily to allow penetration of the snow into the tread, where it compacts and provides resistance against slippage. The snow strength developed by compaction depends on the properties of the snow, which depend on its temperature and water content—wetter, warmer snow compacts better than dry, colder snow up to a point where the snow is so wet that it lubricates the tire-road interface. New and powder snow have densities of . Compacted snow may have densities of . Snow or ice-covered roadways present lower braking and cornering friction, compared to dry conditions. The roadway friction properties of snow, in particular, are a function of temperature. At temperatures below , snow crystals are harder and generate more friction as a tire passes over them than at warmer conditions with snow or ice on the road surface. However, as temperatures rise above , the presence of free water increasingly lubricates the snow or ice and diminishes tire friction. Hydrophilic rubber compounds help create friction in the presence of water or ice. ;Dry and moist snow conditions on roadways File:Mercedes-Benz S203 Yyteri.JPGVehicle in cold, dry, powder snow, which offers comparatively better traction than moist snow. File:Саратов пробка у Детского парка.jpgVehicles in warm, moist, granular snow encounter decreased roadway traction. Treads Snow tire with metal studs, which improve traction on icy surfaces. Attributes that can distinguish snow tires from \\"all-season\\" and summer tires include: *An open, deep tread, with a high void ratio between rubber and spaces between the solid rubber *Shoulder blocks, a specialized tread design at the outside of the tire tread to increase snow contact and friction *A narrower aspect ratio between the diameter of the tire and the tread width to minimize resistance from the plowing effect of the tire through deeper snow *Hydrophilic rubber compounds that improve friction on wet surfaces *Additional siping, or thin slits in the rubber, that provide more biting edges and improve traction on wet or icy surfaces. Wet-film conditions on hard-compacted snow or ice require studs or chains. =Studs= Many jurisdictions in Asia, Europe, and North America seasonally allow snow tires with metal or ceramic studs to improve grip on packed snow or ice. Such tires are prohibited in other jurisdictions or during warmer months because of the damage they may cause to road surfaces. The metal studs are fabricated by encapsulating a hard pin in a softer material base, sometimes called the jacket. The pin is often made of tungsten carbide, a very hard high performance ceramic. The softer base is the part that anchors the stud in the rubber of the tire. As the tire wears with use, the softer base wears so that its surface is at about the same level as the rubber, whereas the hard pin wears so that it continues to protrude from the tire. The pin should protrude at least for the tire to function properly. Snow tires do not eliminate skidding on ice and snow, but they greatly reduce risks. Studdable tires are manufactured with molded holes on the rubber tire tread. Usually, there are 80 to 100 molded holes per tire for stud insertion. The insertion is done by using a special tool that spreads the rubber hole so that a stud jacket can be inserted and the flange at the bottom of the jacket can be fitted nicely to the bottom of the hole. The metal studs come in specific heights to match the depths of the holes molded into the tire tread based on the tread depths. For this reason, stud metals can only be inserted when the tires have not been driven on. A proper stud insertion results in the metal jacket that is flush with the surface of the tire tread having only the pin part that protrudes. When studs come into contact with pavements they abrade the asphalt or concrete surface. This can result in creating polluting dust and wear in the wheel path that prevents proper drainage. For this reason, studded tires are banned, at least seasonally, in many jurisdictions. Tire–snow interactions The compacted snow develops strength against slippage along a shear plane parallel to the contact area of the tire on the ground. At the same time, the bottom of the tire treads compress the snow on which they are bearing, also creating friction. The process of compacting snow within the treads requires it to be expelled in time for the tread to compact snow anew on the next rotation. The compaction/contact process works both in the direction of travel for propulsion and braking, but also laterally for cornering. The deeper the snow that the tire rolls through, the higher the resistance encountered by the tire, as it compacts the snow it encounters and plows some of it to either side. At some point on a given angle of uphill pitch, this resistance becomes greater than the resistance to slippage achieved by the tread's contact with the snow and the tires with power begin to slip and spin. Deeper snow means that climbing a hill without spinning the powered wheels becomes more difficult. However, the plowing/compaction effect aids in braking to the extent that it creates rolling resistance. ;Tire-snow interactions File:Snow tire compacting snow ahead of it.jpgCompaction of snow under an advancing snow tire, causing rolling resistance while passing through about of snow. File:Impression left by snow tire rolling through snow.jpgCompaction in about of snow left behind a snow tire, showing tread-snow interaction. Regulations thumbTire showing the ASTM 3PMSF (Three-Peak Mountain Snow Flake) symbol, denoting a qualifying snow tire, and a separate snow flake symbol, that recommends tire replacement with of tread remaining ASTM International (American Society for Testing and Materials International) is an international standards organization that develops and publishes voluntary consensus technical standards for a wide range of materials, products, systems, and services. The pertinent standard for snow tires is ASTM F1805 – 16, Standard Test Method for Single Wheel Driving Traction in a Straight Line on Snow- and Ice-Covered Surfaces, which assess tire performance on snow and ice. It measures the traction of tires under acceleration in the rolling direction. Tires that pass this test are entitled to display the 3PMSF (Three- Peak Mountain Snow Flake) symbol. =Asia= In Russia light vehicles and buses must be equipped with snow M+S or 3PMSF tires on all axles from December through February and have a minimum tread depth of . All prefectures of Japan, except for the southernmost prefecture of Okinawa, require the motorized vehicles to be fitted with winter tires or tire chains if the road is icy or slushy. If tread grooves of snow tires are worn off for more than 50% of its original depth, tires must be replaced to meet the legal requirements. Drivers will be fined for failing to comply with the snow tire or tire chains requirements. Nationwide studded tire restrictions for passenger vehicles came in effect in April 1991, followed by restrictions for commercial trucks in 1993. Studded tires are technically still legal in Japan, but the usage is restricted by environmental law and it is a criminal offence to operate a vehicle fitted with studded tire on dry asphalt or concrete. =Europe= A Czech Republic road sign Winter equipment, which mandates the use of snow tires in the winter As of 2016, European regulations pertaining to snow tires varied by country.

As of 2016, snow tires were 3.6% of the US market and 35% of the Canadian market. US states and Canadian provinces control the use of snow tires. No state or province (except for Quebec) requires snow tires. They may require snow tires or chains only in certain areas during the winter: *British Columbia – Snow tires are only required by law in certain \\"designated winter tire & chain-up routes\\" in mountainous regions. In these areas, motorists must use winter tires or carry tire chains. *Alberta – Banff National Park or Jasper National Park require cars to have snow tires or tire chains between 1 November to 31 March, or any other period during which the road is covered with snow or ice. *Quebec – Winter tires or studded tires must be used from 1 December to 15 March. The use of studded tires is regulated in the United States and Canada by individual states and provinces, as follows: *Unrestricted use of studded snow tires is allowed in: (United States) Colorado, Kentucky, North Carolina, Vermont, and Wyoming; (Canada) Alberta, Northwest Territories, Saskatchewan, and Yukon **South Carolina – only restriction is studs must be no more than 1/16 of an inch. **Wyoming – chains must be used during snow emergencies. *Studded snow tires may not be used in Hawaii, Mississippi, Puerto Rico, or Southern Ontario. **Georgia – only during \\"snow and ice\\" conditions. **Illinois – prohibited for nearly all vehicles; only rural mail carriers and persons with disabilities in rural areas may use, 15 November – 1 April. **Minnesota – rural mail carriers and non-residents (maximum of 30 days) only, 1 November – 15 April; The non-resident exemption does not extend to out-of- state students and non-residents employed in Minnesota. **Wisconsin – only mail carriers, school buses and emergency vehicles, 15 November – 1 April; vehicles registered in states which permit studded tires may use in Wisconsin for up to 30 days during the same window. *All other states and provinces allow seasonal use of studded snow tires. **Alabama, Alaska, Florida, Louisiana, Michigan and Texas – only rubber studs are allowed. **Alaska – 16 September – 30 April north of 60 degrees north latitude (including Anchorage and Fairbanks); 1 October – 14 April south of 60 degrees north latitude (including Juneau). **Idaho – firefighting vehicles may use year-round; all other vehicles may use 1 October – 30 April. **North Dakota – school buses may use year-round; all other vehicles may use 15 October – 15 April. **South Dakota – school buses and municipal fire vehicles may use year-round; all other vehicles may use 1 October – 30 April.

The site is a notable example of a periglacial tor landform developed in rocks of the Ardingly Sandstone Member of the Tunbridge Wells Sand Formation. It is popular with rock climbers, and is the largest of the cluster of local outcrops known by climbers as Southern Sandstone. Harrison's Rocks is owned by climbers and is managed on their behalf by the British Mountaineering Council with funding from the English Sports Council.  Geology  Harrison's Rocks are a notable example of a periglacial tor landform, developed in rocks of the Tunbridge Wells Sand Formation of the Wealden Supergroup of early Cretaceous age. Harrison's Rocks is composed of a soft sandstone, which is prone to being worn away.  Climbing  Harrison's Rocks has been owned by the British Mountaineering Council since 2009, and is managed by a local group of volunteers known as the Harrison's Rocks Management Group. There are approximately four hundred short climbs at Harrison's Rocks, ranging widely in difficulty. Climbing is exclusively protected by means of a \\"top rope\\". This is the same as at all Southern Sandstone outcrops. Lead climbing is prohibited for two main reasons. Firstly, it is dangerous because the rock is too friable; any gear placed in the sandstone cracks would easily rip out in the event of a leader fall. Lead-climbing is also discouraged for reasons of conservation - it is unacceptable for climbers to risk further damage to the thin rock crust on the surface of the crags. Unconsolidated and friable sand lies beneath this crust. Deep rope-grooves can be seen in places at Harrison's Rocks and are testament to the fragility of the rock. All of the climbs are quite short, with the highest at approximately and the lowest at . Most climbs have a ring drilled and set into the rock at the top for setting up a top rope, but some rely on the use of tree trunks for protection.

It belongs to the comarca of Los Ancares Lucenses. It had a population of 1,381 in 2009 according to the Municipal Register of Inhabitants. Geography The town stretches along the southern foothills of the Sierra de los Ancares and the valley formed by the upper reaches of the river Navía. It is a vast territory at 112.4 km2. As Nogais has a very low population density with less than 15 inhabitants per square kilometer. The maximum height is in the Sierra de los Ancares in small hills like Travesa, Chan Pintinidoira and Pereira (between 1,000 and 2,000 m) and in the foothills of the Serras del Piornal and Rañadoiro. To the south and southwest the municipality exceeds 1,300 meters, reaching 1,387 meters at Pico do Corvo. The Navia river, which begins in the Piedrafita del Cebrero, crosses Los Nogales from southwest to northwest and collects water from, among others, the Valdeparada river and the stream of Boullón. Winters are cold and summers are cool, with an average temperature of 9 °C and a temperature variation of 13 °C. History There were settlements of Castro culture, such as the fort of Vilabol, Vilaesteva and Quintá. Located here is the Roman bridge of Ponte Naviae along the road from Braga to Astorga. On the road leading to Castile, the hardest part of the climb to Piedrafita began here. This entry to Galiciawas defended by the Doncos tower and castles of Doiras and Valcarce. In the fourteenth century, Doncos was property of higher elder in Galicia named Garcia Rodríguez de Valcarce. In the fifteenth century Doncos belonged to the Earl of Ayala and Countess of Monterrey. But in 1603, when it was owned by Fernando de Toledo, it was already an abandoned tower. The ecclesiastical advantage belonged to the house and lordship of Tores, possession of the Marquis of Camarasa. It seems that in the place of Santo André was a hermitage, converted to a monastery and quickly disappeared. During the War of Independence of Spain, French troops burned Doncos and other sites as well. In 1835, neighbors formed a party of volunteers that prosecuted the Carlists.

Biography  The Afrikaans poet Izak David du Plessis was born on 25 June 1900 at Philipstown and received his education at Steynsburg, Petrusville and later at the Wynberg Boys' High School in Cape Town. After his studies at the University of Cape Town, he was for a time a teacher in Worcester, a journalist in the editorial board of Die Burger and Die Huisgenoot and then lecturer at the Cape Technical College. It was in these years that his interest arose in the social life and cultural products of the Malays. In 1932, he accepted an appointment as a lecturer at the University of Cape Town and in 1935 he was promoted with a thesis on the contribution of the Cape Malay to South African anthem. In the thirties he travelled much abroad, including Europe, East and South America. In 1948, he became head of the Institute of Malay Studies at the Cape Town University and from 1953 to 1963 he served as commissioner and later secretary and adviser for Coloured Affairs, a position that enabled him to advocate a particular vision for people the state labelled as Cape Malay. He also advocated for the establishment of the University of the Western Cape for so-called Coloured students, and he was the first Chancellor. In 1937 his anthologies Vreemde Liefde (Strange Love) en Ballades (Ballads) received the Hertzog poetry award, while in 1962 he received the Scheepers award for Youth literature. From the University of Cape Town, he received an honorary degree. On 11 December 1981, he died in Cape Town.

The term storage container here refers to any container that is used to store products, regardless of its size. Though tank blanketing is used for a variety of reasons, it typically involves using a buffer gas to protect products inside the storage container. A few of the benefits of blanketing include a longer life of the product in the container, reduced hazards, and longer equipment life cycles. Methods In 1970, Appalachian Controls Environmental (ACE) was the world’s first company to introduce a tank blanketing valve. There are now many ready-made systems available for purchase from a variety of process equipment companies. It is also possible to piece together your own system using a variety of different equipment. Regardless of which method is used, the basic requirements are the same. There must be a way of allowing the blanketing gas into the system, and a way to vent the gas should the pressure get too high. Since ACE introduced its valve many companies have engineered their own versions. Though many of the products available vary in features and applicability, the fundamental design is the same. When the pressure inside the container drops below a set point, a valve opens and allows the blanketing gas to enter. Once the pressure reaches the set point, the valve closes. As a safety feature, many systems include a pressure vent that opens when the pressure inside exceeds a maximum pressure set point. This helps to prevent the container from rupturing due to high pressure. Since most blanketing gas sources will provide gas at a much higher than desired pressure, a blanketing system will also use a pressure reducing valve to decrease the inlet pressure to the tank. Although it varies from application to application, blanketing systems usually operate at a slightly higher than atmospheric pressure (a few inches of water column above atmospheric). Higher pressures than this are generally not used as they often yield only marginal increases in results while wasting large amounts of expensive blanketing gas. Some systems also utilize inert gases to agitate the liquid contents of the container. This is desirable because products, such as citric acid, are added to food oils the tank will begin to settle over time with the heavier contents sinking to the bottom. However, a system that utilizes nitrogen sparging (and then subsequently tank blanketing once the nitrogen reaches the vapor space) may have negative impact on the products involved. Nitrogen sparging creates a significantly higher amount of surface contact between the gas and the product, which in turn creates a much larger opportunity for undesired oxidation to occur. It is possible for nitrogen that is as much 99.9% free of oxygen to increase the amount of oxidation within the product due to the high amount of surface contact. Common practices The most common gas used in blanketing is nitrogen. Nitrogen is widely used due to its inert properties, as well as its availability and relatively low cost. Tank blanketing is used for a variety of products including cooking oils, volatile combustible products, and purified water. These applications also cover a wide variety of storage containers, ranging from as large as a tank containing millions of gallons of vegetable oil down to a quart-size container or smaller. Nitrogen is appropriate for use at any of these scales. The use of an inert blanketing gas for food products helps to keep oxygen levels low in and around the product. Low levels of oxygen surrounding the product help to reduce the amount of oxidation that may occur, and increases shelf life. In the case of cooking oils, lipid oxidation can cause the oil to change its color, flavor, or aroma. It also decreases the nutrient levels in the food and can even generate toxic substances. Tank blanketing strategies are also implemented to prepare the product for transit (railcar or truck) and for final packaging before sealing the product. When considering the application for combustible products, the greatest benefit is process safety. Since fuels require oxygen to combust, reduced oxygen content in the vapor space lowers the risk of unwanted combustion. Tank blanketing is also used to keep contaminants out of a storage space. This is accomplished by creating positive pressure inside the container. This positive pressure ensures that if a leak should occur, the gas will leak out rather than having the contaminants infiltrate the container. Some examples include its use on purified water to keep unwanted minerals out and its use on food products to keep contaminants out. To ensure their safety, gas-blanketing systems for food use are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and must adhere to strict maintenance schedules and follow all product-contact regulations with regards to purity, toxicity, and filter specs. As with any use of inert gases, care must be taken to ensure that workers are not exposed to large quantities of nitrogen or other non- breathable substances, which can quickly result in asphyxiation and death.

Narain, Sneha, Sriya Reddy, Seeman and the director himself form the cast. Narain plays Vetrivel, a collector, while Sriya Reddy is a nurse, Sneha is a teacher named Kokila and Seeman plays Muthu. The film deals with four different periods – 1978, 1983, 1991 and 2004.  Plot  The movie revolves around an ailing school in a village in Cuddalore district where the land owner wants to demolish the school while the old students prevent the school from getting shut. Kokila (Sneha) works in the school where she had also studied. The school was constructed by Kokila's grandfather years ago and dispute arises between her family members, where her uncle wanted to demolish the school and sell the land as the school is in a very bad state. The school teachers come up with a plan of organising an alumni get together, so that the school can be saved. Kumarasamy aka Kumar (Thagar Bachan) is a poor man who lives in the same village and is the classmate of Kokila. He is sent to Kanchipuram to meet the district collector Vetrivel (Naren) who also happens to be the alumni of the same school. Vetri and Kumar were close friends during childhood and both feel happy meeting after years. Meanwhile, the two also get to meet Muthu (Seeman) who is a film director now and is also their close friend. All the three friends get united after many years. A flashback is shown where Vetri, Kumar and Muthu were close friends during schooldays. All three belong to poor families and Vetri falls in love with his classmate Kokila, who is a rich girl. Jhansi (Shriya) is a nurse who visits the village for conducting a medical camp. All three boys get closer to Jhansi as she is kind and she looks after them very well. Jhansi takes care of Muthu's education after his father's sudden death. Meanwhile, Vetri and Kokila's love affair is known to her family members and they accuse that Jhansi helped the love and insults her in front of the villagers. Jhansi gets hurt and leaves the village. Muthu also leaves the village along with Jhansi . Vetri goes out of village for undergraduation. Vetri clears civil services and comes back to village with plans of marrying Kokila in a registrar office. But Kokila refuses getting married without her family's consent and requests Vetri to meet her parents once with the hope that they would agree as he is well educated now. But, Kokila's father beat Vetri and his father and in the fight, Vetri's father dies. Kokila's family members lock her in a room. Vetri gets furious that Kokila didn't turn up at the time of his visit and also worries due to his father's death. Vetri decides to leave the village with no plans of returning again. Coming back to present, all three friends meet and share their old good memories. Muthu is married and he takes care of Jhansi still. Also Kumar is married. Kumar describes the pathetic state of their old school in village and requests them to take some action to prevent it from getting shut. The friends decides to try all means to conduct an alumni reunion. But Vetri is not interested to return to the village as he has been humiliated by Kokila's family members long time ago. Kumar and Muthu convince Vetri to come to village. Kokila still loves Vetri but Kumar lies to Kokila that Vetri is married which makes Kokila angry. Kokila feels that Vetri has ditched her and started a new life while she still loves him. An event has been organized to celebrate the 75th year of the school by inviting all the alumni. Vetri and Muthu are invited as special guests as that would make the event more popular. Vetri and Muthu arrive at the village and visit their school. Vetri and Kokila donot talk to each other. The event is organized in a grand manner and this attracts the media attention also. But still the land owner wants to demolish the school. Vetri files a case on behalf of the school against Kokila's uncle and gets the verdict in favour of the school. The event successfully happens and everyone feels happy that the school is saved as many alumni donate for renovation works. Now Kumar informs the truth that Vetri is not yet married and he just lied so that Kokila will forget him and make her mind for marrying someone else. Kokila understands Vetri's love meanwhile Vetri also understands that Kokila was helpless and was locked up by her family members while Vetri was beaten. Vetri and Kokila get united in the end.

The ceremony in St. Louis cleared the way for Lewis and Clark to begin their exploration. Background France had ruled Louisiana from its founding until the Treaty of Paris (1763) which ended the Seven Years' War (whose North American phase was the French and Indian War), in which treaty Spain received the French land west of the Mississippi River (the \\"right bank\\" going downstream) plus New Orleans, and Great Britain received the French lands east of the River (the \\"left bank\\") -- which included what had previously been called the Illinois Country or Upper Louisiana. Spain officially took control of its territory in 1769, when it suppressed the Rebellion of 1768 by area residents who had resisted Spain's assumption of colonial authority in the formerly French domain. The United States extended its western boundaries to the Mississippi River during the American Revolutionary War, when General George Rogers Clark took possession of the lands east of the Mississippi River which had for some years belonged to Great Britain. American control of the territory which became today's Midwestern states (the former Illinois Country and Ohio Country) was not secure until both the Treaty of Paris (1783) and the Jay Treaty (1794) had been formalized. On October 1, 1800, Napoleon Bonaparte concluded France's re- acquisition of La Louisiane (Spanish: Luisiana) from Spain, in the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso. However, the treaty was kept secret and Spain continued to administer the territory. The U.S. and France agreed on April 30, 1803, to the American purchase of Louisiana (which was announced publicly in the United States on July 4). However, the U.S. did not immediately take possession of these lands on the west side of the Mississippi, and Spain continued to administer the territory because it had not yet formally turned it over to France. After the United States' purchase, Thomas Jefferson announced plans for an exploration of the new territory. Spain, however, prohibited any foreign exploration of its territory. Lewis and Clark were to spend the winter of 1803-04 at Camp Dubois in what was then the Indiana Territory, opposite the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. until the lands had been formally turned over to the United States. Ceremonies On November 30, 1803, Spain formally transferred the territory in a ceremony at the Cabildo and Plaza de Armas in New Orleans attended by Spanish Governors Juan Manuel de Salcedo and Sebastián Calvo de la Puerta y O'Farrill and new French Governor Pierre Clement de Laussat. On December 20, 1803, New Orleans and the rest of Louisiana were transferred to the United States in a ceremony with Laussat and incoming United States governor William C.C. Claiborne, with Gen. James Wilkinson in attendance. However, with navigation on the Mississippi halted because of winter, the news was not conveyed to St. Louis. On March 9, 1804, Amos Stoddard, the new U.S. lieutenant governor for District of Louisiana, and Meriwether Lewis arrived in St. Louis by boat and were met by the Spanish lieutenant for Upper Louisiana, Carlos de Hault de Lassus. Hault de Lassus said: :People of Upper Louisiana, by order of the king I am now about to surrender this post and its dependencies. The flag which has protected you during nearly 36 years will no longer be seen. The oath you took now ceases to bind. Your faithfulness and courage in upholding it will be remembered forever. From the bottom of my heart I wish you all prosperity. The Spanish flag was lowered on March 9, and the French flag was hoisted to fly over the city of St. Louis for 24 hours. The French flag, initially supposed to have been lowered at sunset, remained under guard all night. The next morning, March 10, 1804, the American flag was hoisted.

He was often cast as kindly authority figures and appeared in over 200 films until his death.  Early years  Hinds was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Joseph E. Hinds and Mary A. Beetham Hinds. He was the great-grandson of poet Robert Southey. His father was the president of the United States Playing Card Company, He was a graduate of Phillips Andover Academy, Harvard Law School, and New York University Law School and worked for over 32 years as a lawyer before becoming a professional actor. After he lost most of his money in the financial crisis of 1929, Hinds retired as a lawyer and joined the Pasadena Community Playhouse. He started acting in Broadway shows at age 54.  Career  Hinds is perhaps best remembered for playing Peter Bailey, the father of James Stewart and founder of the Bailey Building and Loan, in It's a Wonderful Life (1946) and for his part as Paul Sycamore in You Can't Take It With You (1938), both films directed by Frank Capra. Hinds was also known for his roles in the Abbott & Costello films such as Buck Privates (1941), Ride 'Em Cowboy (1942) and Pardon My Sarong (1942). He also portrayed Lew Ayres' father in the Dr. Kildare film series during the early 1940s. Hinds mostly played supporting roles, often kind and dignified authority figures; often lawyers, doctors, mayors, judges or the father of the main figure. Hinds' first film was If I Had a Million (1932); his second film was The Road Is Open Again (1933) where he portrayed President Woodrow Wilson. His earlier career was reflected in the role of Judge Thatcher, tortured by the mad Dr. Richard Vollin (Bela Lugosi) in The Raven (1935). Hinds acted in a total of about 220 films. His last film was The Bribe, released in 1949, after his death. Death Hinds died of pneumonia in Pasadena, California, on October 13, 1948 at age 73. He was married to Dorothy Cruickshack. They had two children.

It is the first album to use the \\"Starship\\" moniker, a name which Kantner and Grace Slick would later use for the band that emerged after Jack Casady and Jorma Kaukonen left Jefferson Airplane. From a commercial standpoint, it performed comparably to Jefferson Airplane albums of the era, peaking at #20 on the Billboard 200 and receiving a RIAA gold certification. It was one of the first two albums to ever be nominated for a Hugo Award in the category of Best Dramatic Presentation. Overview Beginning in 1965, Paul Kantner had recorded five studio albums with Jefferson Airplane, but by 1970 internal problems had began taking their toll on the band, including the departure of drummer Spencer Dryden in 1970 and a rift that was forming between founder Marty Balin and the rest of the band that would eventually result in Balin's departure from the band in April 1971.Jefferson Airplane (2014) Last Stand At Winterland (Leftfield Media) The group released only one single in 1970, and Kantner took advantage of the hiatus to work on a solo album. Blows Against the Empire is his concept album recorded and released in 1970, credited to Paul Kantner and Jefferson Starship. This marks the debut of the Jefferson Starship moniker, though not of the band of that name itself, since Blows predates the actual formation of the band Jefferson Starship by four years. The album was recorded at Pacific High Recording Studios and Wally Heider Recording Studios in San Francisco. The result derives from a period of cross-collaboration during late 1969 through 1971 by a collection of musicians from various San Francisco bands including Jefferson Airplane, the Grateful Dead, and Quicksilver Messenger Service, along with Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young recording at the time in the city. These musicians included Jack Casady, Joey Covington, David Crosby, David Freiberg, Jerry Garcia, Mickey Hart, Paul Kantner, Bill Kreutzmann, Graham Nash, and Grace Slick. Excepting Covington, all of these musicians would also play or sing on Crosby's debut album recorded at the same time in the same studios. Bassist Harvey Brooks of Electric Flag, and guitarist Peter Kaukonen, brother of Airplane guitarist Jorma Kaukonen, also appear. Stylistically, the songs range from the light folk of \\"The Baby Tree\\", the musique concrète passages of \\"Home\\" and \\"XM\\", and proto-grunge in \\"Mau-Mau (Amerikon)\\". Mostly, however, the songs are delivered in the kind of improvised, free-form rock & roll representative of the Bay Area bands of the day. Lyrically, the album celebrates countercultural idealism; it is set in a future where the counterculture is able to unite and decide their own fate far away from planet Earth. Written in 1970, Kantner describes in \\"Hijack\\" the construction of a starship beginning in 1980, which \\"ought to be ready by 1990\\". Concept The credit to Jefferson Starship reflected many things: the ad hoc all-star line-up; the album being an evolutionary progression from Jefferson Airplane; and finally the story it relates of the hijacking of a starship.Blows Against the Empire. RCA Legacy 82876 67974 2, 2005 reissue, liner notes. The album is a narrative concept album that tells the story of a counter-culture revolution against the oppressions of \\"Uncle Samuel\\" and a plan to steal a starship from orbit and journey into space in search of a new home. The original vinyl release is divided into two album sides. \\"Mau Mau (Amerikon)\\" launched Side One, a counter-culture manifesto and call to arms. In the context of the narrative, this is the free music being performed in the park, drawing everyone together. :: \\"Put your old ladies back into bed, :: Put your old men into their graves, :: Cover their ears so they can't hear us sing, :: Cover their eyes so they can't see us play.\\" :: \\"Get out of the way, let the people play, :: We gotta get down on you, :: Come alive all over you, :: Dancing down, into your town.\\" It celebrates late-sixties counter-culture, depicting people celebrating mind expansion and free love, \\"We'll ball in your parks, insane with the flash of living...calling for acid, cocaine and grass.\\" They've had enough of the military, domestic and abroad, and make one of the earliest references to Ronald Reagan in popular music in the line, \\"You unleash the dogs of a grade-B movie star Governor's war...so drop your fuckin' bombs, burn your demon babies, I will live again!\\" They condemn the divisive strictures of conservative society, and dream of finding a Utopia. \\"The Baby Tree\\", written by Rosalie Sorrels, is about an imaginary island where babies grow on trees and are collected by happy couples when they fall. The scene develops over the remaining album side, in \\"Let's Go Together\\" and \\"A Child Is Coming\\", that a couple is among the gathering in a park outside Chicago the night before the hijacking, tripping on acid as dawn approaches. She reveals that she's pregnant, and predictably they resolve to free their child from the government's \\"files and their numbers game\\" by joining the hijackers. In this setting, \\"The Baby Tree\\" can be seen as their acid-induced daydream about pregnancy, and so fits neatly into the narrative. The allegory of \\"Let's Go Together\\" and \\"A Child Is Coming\\" symbolizes Paul Kantner and Grace Slick's romantic relationship and Slick's pregnancy by Kantner, which would result in the birth of their daughter, China Kantner, the following year. Side two is an integrated suite of songs which opens with \\"Sunrise\\", Grace Slick's allegory describing the breaking dawn the couple was awaiting, while also symbolizing the dawn of a Utopian civilization, freed from conservative mores and violent influences. \\"Sunrise\\" leads directly into \\"Hijack\\", in which the revolutionaries storm the transport to the orbiting starship and head off into space, boarding the ship by the end of \\"Hijack\\" and leaving orbit in \\"Home\\". As the story progresses with \\"Have You Seen the Stars Tonite\\", hopes and misgivings are revealed. After the ship's engines and systems are readied in \\"X-M\\", \\"Starship\\" relates a mutiny fought for control of the ship, to determine whether to surrender and return, or to continue. Eventually the idealists win control, and the ship is flung by gravity sling-shot around the sun and out of the solar system. By Kantner's admission, the underlying premise of the narrative was derived in part from the works of science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein, particularly the novel Methuselah's Children. Kantner went so far as to write to Heinlein to obtain permission to use his ideas. Heinlein wrote back that over the years many people had used his ideas, but Paul was the first one to ask for permission, which he granted. In 1971, Blows was the first rock album ever nominated for a Hugo Award in the category of Best Dramatic Presentation. Although it received the plurality of the vote among the five nominated works, the majority of voters elected not to issue the award that year. Arrangements and instrumentation Throughout the album, Slick's acoustic piano is highlighted. She has said that her chord- heavy technique at the time developed from watching session player Nicky Hopkins during his many recordings with the Airplane. Most of the tracks add standard rock instrumentation to her piano, including electric and acoustic guitars, drums and bass. Thick vocal harmonies backing Kantner and Slick in duet are a signature quality of many of the songs. A notable exception is \\"The Baby Tree\\", which has Kantner singing to a solo banjo accompaniment by Jerry Garcia. \\"Sunrise\\" is Grace Slick's self-penned solo vocal showcase, in part a duet with herself thanks to multitracking. Here she is predominantly accompanied by Jack Casady playing bass in a series of overdubs. \\"Have You Seen the Stars Tonite?\\" features lush vocal harmonies over acoustic instruments with subdued electric guitar overlays. The acoustic parts throughout the second side are centered on Kantner's detuned 12-string guitar,Guitar Player June 1977 using a tuning consisting of octaves and fifths of open C, which David Crosby has likened to the droning tones of bagpipes. Two tracks of the side 2 suite consist entirely of sound effects simulating the starship engines and the flight through space. Scattered among the other songs of the Suite are heavily processed background vocal tracks and sound bites. During the hijack scene, an audio excerpt from the 1953 George Pal film version of War of the Worlds is used: a woman is heard to call out \\"Let me through!\\" followed immediately by the sound of a ray gun firing. Release The original vinyl album was a single platter in a gatefold sleeve. The cover featured a piece of Russian folk art from a painted lacquer box, attributed to CCCP (U.S.S.R. in Russian). Kantner has said he enjoyed stealing the art from Russia because many Jefferson Airplane albums were bootlegged on the Russian black market. The back cover painting depicts a partially opened parcel revealing a room inside with Jerry Garcia peeking out, behind him a Heavy Naked Woman standing on an American Flag the parcel being flown on a string by a trio of breasts with wings. Inside the gatefold is more artwork with track listings and credits, done in silver ink on black background and featuring a Paul Kantner caricature with a head of marijuana-leaf hair rising over a mountainous planetscape and inkblot pair of marijuana leaves in the lower fold. A mushroom on the left hemi-sphere pyramid on the right and the mountainous planetscape is nearly a mirror image. The inner dust jacket was decorated with collages of musician photos, writings and doodles. Original pressings included a full-color booklet as well, with lyrics, poetry and drawings mostly done by Slick during the recording sessions and collected daily by Kantner. Subsequent pressings included a black & white version of the booklet. A small number of promotional copies of the album were released to radio stations on clear translucent vinyl; these are now coveted by vinyl record collectors. =Compact disc reissues= The original compact disc release had mildly dull, slightly under-volume sound quality, and reproduced the gatefold cover art and parts of the inner gatefold, neglecting the booklet and dust jacket art entirely. The remastered CD release has superior sound at improved volume levels. The fold-out CD booklet includes the cover art and provides much of the inner gatefold and dust jacket artwork by including it among the extensive liner notes. Also included is a CD-sized reproduction of the black & white booklet. Finally, the remaster includes bonus tracks of alternate takes, demos and a live recording of Starship with radio promos appended. Note that the editing glitch at 4:00 in the opening song, \\"Mau Mau (Amerikon)\\", is not an error in the digital transfer; it goes back to the original album release. Reception Reviewing in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau found Kantner's singing and melodies \\"murky\\" while believing, \\"for all the record's sci-fi pretensions (does Philip K. Dick actually like this stuff?) it never even gets off the ground.\\" He graded it a C-plus. It was voted number 850 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000). In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Paul Evans said while its experimental quality may have impressed in 1970, the album \\"now suffers from concept-album creakiness\\". William Ruhlmann was more enthusiastic, giving it four out of five stars in his review for AllMusic. \\"Kantner employed often dense instrumentation and complex arrangements\\", he wrote, \\"but there were enough hooks and harmonies to keep things interesting.\\" Track listing ;Notes The original cassette and compact disc releases contained alternate lyrics for \\"Let's Go Together\\" that differed from the vinyl version. The 2005 reissue restored the original lyrics as track three and included the alternate lyric version as a bonus track.

History With the introduction of the 80386 processor, Intel began introducing \\"experimental\\" features that would not necessarily be present in future versions of the processor. The first of these were two \\"test registers\\" (TR6 and TR7) that enabled testing of the processor's translation lookaside buffer (TLB); a special variant of the instruction allowed moving to and from the test registers. Three additional test registers followed in the 80486 (TR3–TR5) that enabled testing of the processor's caches for code and data. None of these five registers were implemented in the subsequent Pentium processor; the special variant of generated an invalid opcode exception. With the introduction of the Pentium processor, Intel provided a pair of instructions ( and ) to access current and future \\"model-specific registers\\", as well as the instruction to determine which features are present on a particular model. Many of these registers have proven useful enough to be retained. Intel has classified these as architectural model-specific registers and has committed to their inclusion in future product lines. Using MSRs Reading and writing to these registers is handled by the \`rdmsr\` and \`wrmsr\` instructions, respectively. As these are privileged instructions, they can be executed only by the operating system. Use of the Linux msr kernel module creates a pseudo file \\"/dev/cpu/x/msr\\" (with a unique x for each processor or processor core). A user with permissions to read and/or write to this file can use the file I/O API to access these registers. The msr-toolsmsr-tools at 01.org package provides a reference implementation. Documentation regarding which MSRs a certain processor implementation supports is usually found in the processor documentation of the CPU vendor. Examples for rather well-known MSRs are the memory type range registers (MTRRs) and the address-range registers (ARRs).

Together with C. capsularis it is the primary source of jute fiber. The leaves and young fruits are used as a vegetable, the dried leaves are used for tea and as a soup thickener, and the seeds are edible.  Origin and history  It is unclear whether Corchorus olitorius originated in Africa or in Asia. Some authorities consider that it comes from the Indo-Burmese area or from India, along with several other related species. Others point out that there is a greater genetic variation in Africa and a larger number of wild species in the genus Corchorus. Wherever it originated, it has been under cultivation for a very long time in both continents and probably grows, wild or as a crop, in every country in tropical Africa. In classical antiquity, Pliny recorded that jute plants were used as food in Ancient Egypt. It may have also been cultivated by the Jews in the Near East, which gives the plant its name.  Botany  Corchorus olitorius is an erect herbaceous plant, fairly branched and grows about 1.5 m high. However, if grown for fibre production, it can reach heights up to 4 m. The taproot leads to a sturdy and hairless stem, which is green with a faint red-brownish hue and sometimes turns a little woody on ground level. The serrate acute leaves alternate, are 6 to 10 cm long a and 2 to 4 cm wide. The plant carries the flowers solitary or in two- flowered cymes opposite of the leaf. The flowers sit on the end of a short stem, count 5 sepals, 5 petals and 10 free and yellow stamina. The fruit is spindle-shaped, dehiscent and divided into transversal sections through five valves. The fruit measures 2 to 8 cm in length and colors vary from greyish- blue to green or brownish-black. Every seed chamber contains 25 to 40 seeds, which sum up to 125 to 200 seeds per fruit.  Cultivation  Corchorus olitorius is an annual crop. The plant grows well in the lowland tropics, ranging from warm temperate zones through tropical desert to wet forest life zones. It can tolerate an annual precipitation between 400 and 4290 mm (optimum 1000 mm per year). Some cultivars are sensitive to waterlogging, especially when they are young. Temperatures between 16.8 and 27.5 °C are optimal for the plant growth. For the soil a pH of 4.5 to 8.2 is needed. The plant prefers a fertile, humus-rich, well-drained alluvial soil but also grows well in suboptimal soil conditions. Before sowing, the soil is prepared carefully by plowing and the seeds are broadcast or dribbled behind the plow in the wet season. Twenty-four hours before seeding, the seeds must be pre- soaked for ten seconds in hot water (around 93 °C) to overcome dormancy. If the small seeds are mixed with sand, it makes it easier to sow them. And if the soil is wet, germination takes place two to three days after sowing. In some systems, the seedlings are transplanted at a height of 10 cm. The plants are grown in rows with a spacing of 20–50 cm. When the plant achieves a height of 8–25 cm, the seedlings are harrowed with a rake three to four times and weeded two to three times. Cow dung, wood ashes or rotted water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) or its ashes are used as manure. The yield of the crop responds more to water availability and soil organic matter than to high mineral nutrient status. = Plant protection = The most serious pests are nematodes from the genus Meloidogyne, leaf-eating beetles and caterpillars. If it is dry, eight to ten weeks after planting, yield losses can occur due to leaf bugs and spider mites attacks resulting in terminal shoot wilt. Damage by nematodes can be minimized by crop rotation. Application of insecticides is also possible, but agent and application time should be chosen carefully since the leaves are harvested for consumption. Attacks were also observed by weevils species (Myllocerus spp.), semilooper (Anomis sabulifera), and yellow mites (Polyphagotarsonemus latus). Diseases (bacterial and viruses infections) are not as serious as pests (insect and nematode attacks). Seedling damp-off occurs but can be reduced by good drainage and cultivation in humus-rich soils with adequate water holding capacity. Attacks by Sclerotium rolfsii in dry weather of the late season can lead to wilts at the stem collar. Anthracnose spots caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides may infect the crop but can be easily controlled by spraying copper oxychloride. = Harvest and yield performance = Harvest can begin after about six weeks: The whole plant can be directly harvested (for jute production) or leaves are harvested by pruning several times during the vegetation period (for food production). The shoot regeneration highly depends on variety, soil fertility, adequate water supply and control of weeds and pests. Amount of pruned shoots and quality reduces with each harvest. Under farming conditions the yield usually reaches around 2.5 t per hectare of edible leaves. Under experimental conditions and with very high fertility application, yields of about 28 t per hectare have been reported. = Post harvest and propagation = For fresh consumption the leaves should be stored above 8 °C and below 15 °C. Low temperatures from 1-8 °C lead to browning of the leaves and too high storage temperatures are manifested in leaf yellowing. To produce seeds, the fruits can be harvested six weeks after flowering. The dried capsules are threshed and can be stored for eight to twelve months in well sealed jars. For storage, the moisture should be around nine percent. = Biochemistry =  Leaves  Leaves of Corchorus olitorius are mainly known to have rich sources of many chemical compound. There are 17 active nutrients compounds in Jute leaves including protein, fat, carbohydrate, fiber, ash, calcium, potassium, iron, sodium, phosphorus, beta-carotene, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and ascorbic acid. = Seeds = According to a comparative analysis of major nutrients of Corchorus olitorius seeds showed that the protein content of the Corchorus olitorius has significantly increased after seed germination process where the sugar level has decreased in the studied seeds. It can be seen from this study that the level of nutrients in the Corchorus olitorius seed changes during the germination process. = Future prospects = C. olitorius could be grown in a floating system with nutrient solution and could produce baby leaves, which would be interesting for the fresh cut leafy vegetable industry in Europe. Uses = Fibre and Textile Use= Jute fibre is made from the bark tissue of C. olitorius and C. capsularis, especially in South Asian countries, though fibre made from C. olitorius is considered to be of lesser quality. Finished fibres appear golden and silky with a length of up to 3 metres and with a diameter of 2.4 µm. The plant stalk is cut and then processed by pulling up, rippling, partial retting, breaking, spinning and combing to obtain fine fibres that are well separated from unwanted woody material. Afterwards the fibres are cured and dried. Many textiles are made of jute, such as yarn, twine, sacking, carpet backing cloth and other blended textiles. It is also used as raw material for cords and strings. In Africa and the Middle East, a different type is grown with the leaves and shoots being used for food while the fibre is considered of little importance. = Culinary Use= C. olitorius is cultivated in Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Egypt as a potherb and its culinary use goes back at least as far as the Ancient Egyptians. It is an important leafy vegetable in Côte d'Ivoire, Benin, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon, Sudan, Uganda, Kenya and Zimbabwe. It is also cultivated and eaten in the Caribbean and Brazil, in the Middle East and in India, Bangladesh, Japan and China. Its leaves are a special favourite of the Boros of northeast India, who make a mucilaginous preparation with its dried leaves mixed with fatty pork and lye called narji. In Nigeria, the leaves are boiled to make a sticky, mucilaginous sauce which is served with balls of cassava which are otherwise rather dry. In Vietnamese cuisine, it known as rau đay and made into a soup with shrimp.  Nutrition  The edible part of jute is its leaves. Richness in potassium, vitamin B6, iron, vitamin A and vitamin C make this crop particularly important, where people cover a high share of their energy requirement by micronutrient-poor staple crops. This vegetable is predominantly eaten in Africa and Asia. A traditional Syrian, Lebanese, Tunisian, Turkish Cypriot, Jordanian, Palestinian and Egyptian dish made of C. olitorius leaves is mulukhiyah.  Medicinal aspects  Consumption of the leaves is reported to be demulcent, deobstruent, diuretic, lactagogue, purgative, and tonic. It is also a folk remedy for aches and pains, dysentery, enteritis, fever, pectoral pains, and tumors. Ayurvedics use the leaves for ascites, pain, piles, and tumors. Elsewhere the leaves are used for cystitis, dysuria, fever, and gonorrhea. The cold infusion is said to restore the appetite and strength. It can act anti-inflammatory, it has gastroprotective properties and can be used as an antifertility agent.

The Alpha Media outlet is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broadcast at 103.9 MHz with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 9.2 kW. The station goes by the name Hot 103.9 and its current slogan is \\"Columbia's #1 Choice for Blazin' Hip-Hop and R&B.;\\" Its studios are on Pineview Road in Columbia, while the transmitter tower is located west of St. Matthews, South Carolina, southeast of Columbia. History The station originally signed on in September 1973 as WHCE (call sign meaning We Have Country Entertainment) in Orangeburg with a country music format. It shared property with Top 40-formatted WORG 1580, but was under slightly different ownership. In 1976, WHCE became WORG-FM and switched to a Top 40-adult contemporary hybrid format, simulcasting much of the programming with the AM station in the process. In the spring of 1989, WORG-FM changed formats to CHR as WKSO with the moniker of 103.9 Kiss-FM (The WORG call letters eventually resurfaced on a new FM station licensed to the nearby community of Elloree). The CHR format lasted until the early 90s when it changed, once again to Urban Contemporary. For the next several years, the station had various Urban formats, including a period where the station simulcasted with WKWQ (now WZMJ) in the Columbia radio market. By June 1999, the station had made a long-planned move into the Columbia market, becoming WHXT with the Hot 103.9 moniker. The station was the first serious challenger to WWDM's long-standing dominance in the Urban Contemporary format, eventually beating them in the Arbitron ratings on several occasions. ICBC bought out WHXT in 2003, and WWDM restructured its format to an Urban AC. WHXT was home to the nationally syndicated Doug Banks Morning Show until the end of 2007; it is now home to The Breakfast Club. The station is owned by Alpha Media through licensee Alpha Media Licensee LLC, which also owns Urban AC WWDM, Classic rock WMFX, Alternative WARQ, and AAA WPCO in the Columbia radio market. On September 9, 2014, WHXT began simulcasting on WSCZ 93.9 FM.

The importance and ubiquity of this technical tool led Gert Pedersen to comment in one of his booksPg. 25; Pedersen, G. K., C*-algebras and their automorphism groups, London Mathematical Society Monographs, . that, :The density theorem is Kaplansky's great gift to mankind. It can be used every day, and twice on Sundays. Formal statement Let K− denote the strong-operator closure of a set K in B(H), the set of bounded operators on the Hilbert space H, and let (K)1 denote the intersection of K with the unit ball of B(H). :Kaplansky density theorem.Theorem 5.3.5; Richard Kadison, Fundamentals of the Theory of Operator Algebras, Vol. I : Elementary Theory, American Mathematical Society. . If A is a self-adjoint algebra of operators in B(H), then each element a in the unit ball of the strong-operator closure of A is in the strong-operator closure of the unit ball of A. In other words, (A)_1^{-} = (A^{-})_1. If h is a self-adjoint operator in (A^{-})_1, then h is in the strong-operator closure of the set of self-adjoint operators in (A)_1. The Kaplansky density theorem can be used to formulate some approximations with respect to the strong operator topology. 1) If h is a positive operator in (A−)1, then h is in the strong-operator closure of the set of self-adjoint operators in (A+)1, where A+ denotes the set of positive operators in A. 2) If A is a C*-algebra acting on the Hilbert space H and u is a unitary operator in A−, then u is in the strong-operator closure of the set of unitary operators in A. In the density theorem and 1) above, the results also hold if one considers a ball of radius r > 0, instead of the unit ball. Proof The standard proof uses the fact that, a bounded continuous real-valued function f is strong-operator continuous. In other words, for a net {aα} of self adjoint operators in A, the continuous functional calculus a -> f(a) satisfies, :\\\\lim f(a_{\\\\alpha}) = f (\\\\lim a_{\\\\alpha}) in the strong operator topology. This shows that self- adjoint part of the unit ball in A− can be approximated strongly by self- adjoint elements in A. A matrix computation in M2(A) considering the self- adjoint operator with entries 0 on the diagonal and a and a* at the other positions, then removes the self-adjointness restriction and proves the theorem.

He spent his entire professional career, from 1955 to 1969, with Italian club A.S. Roma. Most of his family now resides in Boston, Massachusetts USA, with his nephew Michael J. Losi a budding USA Men's National Team Star. Though he was not a native of Rome, during the 15 seasons he played in the capital city, he was nicknamed \\"Core de Roma\\" (Romanesco for Heart of Rome). In total he made 450 appearances with the giallorossi, a record which lasted for 38 years, until 31 January 2007, when Francesco Totti played his 451st match for the club.http://www.corederoma.net/brevissime.asp?ID=5839 At international level, he represented the Italy national football team at the 1962 FIFA World Cup. Club career Born in Soncino, Province of Cremona, Losi started playing football for his hometown club, Soncino. In 1951, he transferred to U.S. Cremonese, and in 1955 to AS Roma where he made his first appearance on 20 March against Inter Milan. He was a fullback with a playing style based on strength but also on fair play. Though his short height (only 1.69 m) he was a great header and thanks to this skill he played many years as a sweeper. He gained the nickname \\"Core de Roma\\" on 8 January 1961, during a match against Sampdoria in which the result was 2–2, Losi was injured but there were no more available substitutions, so he kept playing but succeeded in scoring the winning goal from a corner kick. For this reason Roma's supporters understood that even if he was not Roman, he was a great example of how people from Rome love their team. International career Losi made his first appearance with the Italian national team on 13 March 1960 in a friendly match lost 3-1 against Spain. He was part of the squad that participated in the 1962 FIFA World Cup in Chile, playing two of the three matches of Italy. He has 11 international caps for azzurri. After retirement Losi still lives in Rome, where he is the director of a football team, the \\"Valle Aurelia '87\\". He is one of eleven members of Hall of Fame of A.S. Roma. Outside of football On 3 July 1968, Losi founded the Italian Footballers' Association (AIC), in Milan, along with several fellow footballers, such as Giacomo Bulgarelli, Sandro Mazzola, Ernesto Castano, Giancarlo De Sisti, and Gianni Rivera, as well as the recently retired Sergio Campana, also a lawyer, who was appointed president of the association.

He was notable for the tenacity (and to some extent, success) with which he fought to regain a normal life, and for what the pattern of his deficits helped cognitive scientists to learn about brain function.

A bullet entered his left parieto- occipital area, and resulted in a long coma. Following this he developed a form of agnosia and became unable to perceive the right side of things. Objects he did see often appeared as fragmented pieces rather than whole objects. Even the right side of his own body was invisible to him, an experience that remained terrifying even years later.

Nontrinitarianism is any of several Christian beliefs that reject the Trinitarian doctrine that God is three distinct persons in one being. Modern nontrinitarian groups views differ widely on the nature of God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. Biblical canon P46, an early 3rd-century collection of Pauline epistles. The Biblical canon is the set of books Christians regard as divinely inspired and thus constituting the Christian Bible. Though the early church used the Old Testament according to the canon of the Septuagint (LXX), the apostles did not otherwise leave a defined set of new scriptures; instead the New Testament developed over time. The writings attributed to the apostles circulated amongst the earliest Christian communities. The Pauline epistles were circulating in collected form by the end of the 1st century AD. Justin Martyr, in the early 2nd century, mentions the \\"memoirs of the apostles\\", but his references are not detailed. Around 160 Irenaeus of Lyons argued for only four Gospels (the Tetramorph), and argued that it would be illogical to reject Acts of the Apostles but accept the Gospel of Luke, as both were from the same author.Irenaeus, Adversus Haereses 3.11.8 By the early 200's, Origen may have been using the same 27 books as in the modern New Testament, though there were still disputes over the canonicity of Hebrews, James, II Peter, II and III John, and Revelation,Both points taken from Mark A. Noll's Turning Points, (Baker Academic, 1997) pp 36-37 see Antilegomena. Likewise by 200 the Muratorian fragment shows that there existed a set of Christian writings somewhat similar to what is now the 27-book New Testament. In his Easter letter of 367, Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria, gave a list exactly the same in number and order with what would become the New Testament canon and be accepted by the Greek church. The African Synod of Hippo, in 393, approved the New Testament, as it stands today, together with the Septuagint books, a decision that was repeated by the Council of Carthage (397) and the Council of Carthage (419). Pope Damasus I's Council of Rome in 382, only if the Decretum Gelasianum is correctly associated with it, issued a biblical canon identical to that mentioned above. In 405, Pope Innocent I sent a list of the sacred books to a Gallic bishop, Exsuperius of Toulouse. Nonetheless, a full dogmatic articulation of the canon was not made until the Council of Trent in the 16th century.According to the Catholic Encyclopedia article on the Canon of the New Testament: \\"The idea of a complete and clear- cut canon of the New Testament existing from the beginning, that is from Apostolic times, has no foundation in history. The Canon of the New Testament, like that of the Old, is the result of a development, of a process at once stimulated by disputes with doubters, both within and without the Church, and retarded by certain obscurities and natural hesitations, and which did not reach its final term until the dogmatic definition of the Tridentine Council.\\" Emergence of Christian theology The emergence of Christian theology has sometimes been presented as the triumph of Hellenistic rationality over the Hebraic faith of Jesus and the early disciples. The early African theologian Tertullian, for instance, complained that the 'Athens' of philosophy was corrupting the 'Jerusalem' of faith.Tertullian, De praescriptione haereticorum 7. More recent discussions have qualified and nuanced this picture. * From the very beginning of the Christian movement, followers of Jesus tried to make sense of the impact of Jesus of Nazareth, and began arguing about differing ways of making sense. There has never been an uncontested, unrationalized Christian faith.See, for example, Stephen Sykes, The Identity of Christianity (London: SPCK, 1984) or Wayne Meeks, 'Inventing the Christ: multicultural process and poetry among the first Christians', Studia Theologica 58.1, pp.77-96, for arguments along these lines * These processes of making sense initially drew upon the ideas and narratives of contemporary Judaism, which was already Hellenized in various degrees. As time went by, ideas and narratives from other Hellenistic context were drawn on, but the Jewish scriptures remained a key driver of theological development, and too sharp a distinction between Hebraic and Hellenistic is unsustainable. Some elements of early Christian theologizing previously thought to be thoroughly 'Hellenistic' (e.g., the Prologue of John's Gospel) are now regularly argued to be thoroughly Jewish. * The ideas and narratives drawn on in this process were transformed as they were given a new context in Christian practices of devotion, community – formation and evangelism – and the extent to which borrowings from Hellenistic culture (for instance) were given new meanings in this process should not be underestimated.Larry Hurtado, Lord Jesus Christ (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2003) * One of the characteristics of those strands of early Christianity (in the 2nd and 3rd centuries) sometimes called 'proto- orthodox' (because they are the most direct ancestors of the forms of Christianity that in the 4th century were defined as Orthodox), invested a great deal of time and energy in communication between widely spread conversations, and in pursuing a deep interest in each other's beliefs and practices. This concern and communication seems to have been as much a driver of the development of theological activity as the desire to communicate Christianity to, or make it acceptable in, a Hellenistic culture.See Rowan Williams, 'Does it make sense to speak of pre–Nicene orthodoxy?' in idem (ed.) The Making of Orthodoxy (Cambridge: CUP, 1989), pp.1-23. Patristic theology As Christianity spread, it acquired certain members from well-educated circles of the Hellenistic world; they sometimes became bishops but not always. They produced two sorts of works: theological and \\"apologetic\\", the latter being works aimed at defending the faith by using reason to refute arguments against the veracity of Christianity. These authors are known as the church fathers, and study of them is called Patristics. Notable early Fathers include Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, etc. A large quantity of theological reflection emerged in the early centuries of the Christian church—in a wide variety of genres, in a variety of contexts, and in several languages—much of it the product of attempts to discuss how Christian faith should be lived in cultures very different from the one in which it was born. So, for instance, a good deal of the Greek language literature can be read as an attempt to come to terms with Hellenistic culture. The period sees the slow emergence of orthodoxy (the idea of which seems to emerge from the conflicts between catholic Christianity and Gnostic Christianity), the establishment of a Biblical canon, debates about the doctrine of the Trinity (most notably between the councils of Nicaea in 325 and Constantinople in 381), about Christology (most notably between the councils of Constantinople in 381 and Chalcedon in 451), about the purity of the Church (for instance in the debates surrounding the Donatists), and about grace, free will and predestination (for instance in the debate between Augustine of Hippo and Pelagius). =Ante-Nicene Fathers= Influential texts and writers in the 2nd century include: * The collection known as the Apostolic Fathers (mostly 2nd century) * Justin Martyr (c. 100/114–c. 162/168) * Clement of Alexandria (died c. 215) * Irenaeus of Lyons (c. 130–202) * Various 'Gnostic' authors, such as Marcion (c. 85-c. 160), Valentinius (c. 100–c. 153) and Basilides (c. 117–138) * Some of the texts commonly referred to as the New Testament apocrypha. Influential texts and writers between c. 200 and 325 (the First Council of Nicaea) include: * Tertullian (c. 155–230) * Hippolytus (died 235) * Origen (c. 182–c. 251) * Cyprian (died c. 258) * Arius (256–336) * Other Gnostic texts and texts from the New Testament apocrypha. =First Council of Nicaea=  Nicene Creed  Each phrase in the Nicene Creed, which was hammered out at the Council of Nicaea, addresses some aspect that had been under passionate discussion and closes the books on the argument, with the weight of the agreement of the over 300 bishops in attendance. [Constantine had invited all 1800 bishops of the Christian church (about 1000 in the east and 800 in the west). The number of participating bishops cannot be accurately stated; Socrates Scholasticus and Epiphanius of Salamis counted 318; Eusebius of Caesarea, only 250.] In spite of the agreement reached at the council of 325 the Arians who had been defeated dominated most of the church for the greater part of the 4th century, often with the aid of Roman emperors who favored them. =Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers= Augustine Late antique Christianity produced a great many renowned church fathers who wrote volumes of theological texts, including SS. Augustine, Gregory Nazianzus, Cyril of Jerusalem, Ambrose of Milan, Jerome, and others. What resulted was a golden age of literary and scholarly activity unmatched since the days of Virgil and Horace. Some of these fathers, such as John Chrysostom and Athanasius, suffered exile, persecution, or martyrdom from heretical Byzantine Emperors. Many of their writings are translated into English in the compilations of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers. Influential texts and writers between AD 325 and c. 500 include: * Athanasius (298–373) * The Cappadocian Fathers (late 4th century) * Ambrose (c. 340–397) * Jerome (c. 347–420) * Chrysostom (347–407) * Augustine of Hippo (354–430) * Cyril of Alexandria (376–444) Texts from patristic authors after AD 325 are collected in the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers. Important theological debates also surrounded the various Ecumenical Councils—Nicaea in 325, Constantinople in 381, Ephesus in 431 and Chalcedon in 451. =Papacy and primacy= The theology of the Bishop of Rome having a monarchal papacy developed over time. As a bishopric, its origin is consistent with the development of an episcopal structure in the 1st century. The origins of papal primacy concept are historically obscure; theologically, it is based on three ancient Christian traditions: (1) that the apostle Peter was preeminent among the apostles, (2) that Peter ordained his successors as Bishop of Rome, and (3) that the bishops are the successors of the apostles. As long as the Papal See also happened to be the capital of the Western Empire, prestige of the Bishop of Rome could be taken for granted without the need of sophisticated theological argumentation beyond these points; after its shift to Milan and then Ravenna, however, more detailed arguments were developed based on etc.cf. Richards, Jeffrey. The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476-752 (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1979) p. 9 Nonetheless, in antiquity the Petrine and Apostolic quality, as well as a \\"primacy of respect\\", concerning the Roman See went unchallenged by emperors, eastern patriarchs, and the Eastern Church alike.Richards, Jeffrey. The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476-752 (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1979) pp. 10 and 12 The Ecumenical Council of Constantinople in 381 affirmed Rome as \\"first among equals\\".see J. D. Mansi, Sacrorum Conciliorum Nova et Amplissima Collectio 3, p. 559 By the close of antiquity, the doctrinal clarification and theological arguments on the primacy of Rome were developed. Just what exactly was entailed in this primacy, and its being exercised, would become a matter of controversy at certain later times. Early heresies Urgent concerns with the uniformity of belief and practice have characterized Christianity from the outset. The New Testament itself speaks of the importance of maintaining orthodox doctrine and refuting heresies, showing the antiquity of the concern.e.g. ; ; ; , and the Epistle of James in general. The development of doctrine, the position of orthodoxy, and the relationship between the early Church and early heretical groups is a matter of academic debate. Some scholars, drawing upon distinctions between Jewish Christians, Gentile Christians, and other groups such as Gnostics, see Early Christianity as fragmented and with contemporaneous competing orthodoxies. The process of establishing orthodox Christianity was set in motion by a succession of different interpretations of the teachings of Christ being taught after the crucifixion. Though Christ himself is noted to have spoken out against false prophets and false christs within the gospels themselves Mark 13:22 (some will arise and distort the truth in order to draw away disciples), Matthew 7:5-20, Matthew 24:4, Matthew 24:11 Matthew 24:24 (For false christs and false prophets will arise). On many occasions in Paul's epistles, he defends his own apostleship, and urges Christians in various places to beware of false teachers, or of anything contrary to what was handed to them by him. The epistles of John and Jude also warn of false teachers and prophets, as does the writer of the Book of Revelation and 1 Jn. 4:1, as did the Apostle Peter warn in 2 Pt. 2:1-3:. One of the roles of bishops, and the purpose of many Christian writings, was to refute heresies. The earliest of these were generally Christological in nature, that is, they denied either Christ's (eternal) divinity or humanity. For example, Docetism held that Jesus' humanity was merely an illusion, thus denying the incarnation; whereas Arianism held that Jesus was not eternally divine. Many groups were dualistic, maintaining that reality was composed into two radically opposing parts: matter, usually seen as evil, and spirit, seen as good. Orthodox Christianity, on the other hand, held that both the material and spiritual worlds were created by God and were therefore both good, and that this was represented in the unified divine and human natures of Christ.R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, Medieval Worlds (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 58 Irenaeus (c. 130–202) was the first to argue that his \\"proto-orthodox\\" position was the same faith that Jesus gave to the apostles, and that the identity of the apostles, their successors, and the teachings of the same were all well-known public knowledge. This was therefore an early argument supported by apostolic succession. Irenaeus first established the doctrine of four gospels and no more, with the synoptic gospels interpreted in the light of John. Irenaeus' opponents, however, claimed to have received secret teachings from Jesus via other apostles which were not publicly known. Gnosticism is predicated on the existence of such hidden knowledge, but brief references to private teachings of Jesus have also survived in the canonic Scripture as did warning by the Christ that there would be false prophets or false teachers. Irenaeus' opponents also claimed that the wellsprings of divine inspiration were not dried up, which is the doctrine of continuing revelation. In the middle of the 2nd century, three groups of Christians adhered to a range of doctrines that divided the Christian communities of Rome: the teacher Marcion, the pentecostal outpourings of ecstatic Christian prophets of a continuing revelation, in a movement that was called \\"Montanism\\" because it had been initiated by Montanus and his female disciples, and the gnostic teachings of Valentinus. Early attacks upon alleged heresies formed the matter of Tertullian's Prescription Against Heretics (in 44 chapters, written from Rome), and of Irenaeus' Against Heresies (ca 180, in five volumes), written in Lyons after his return from a visit to Rome. The letters of Ignatius of Antioch and Polycarp of Smyrna to various churches warned against false teachers, and the Epistle of Barnabas, accepted by many Christians as part of Scripture in the 2nd century, warned about mixing Judaism with Christianity, as did other writers, leading to decisions reached in the first ecumenical council, which was convoked by the Emperor Constantine at Nicaea in 325, in response to further disruptive polemical controversy within the Christian community, in that case Arian disputes over the nature of the Trinity. During those first three centuries, Christianity was effectively outlawed by requirements to venerate the Roman emperor and Roman gods. Consequently, when the Church labelled its enemies as heretics and cast them out of its congregations or severed ties with dissident churches, it remained without the power to persecute them. However, those called \\"heretics\\" were also called a number of other things (e.g. \\"fools\\", \\"wild dogs\\", \\"servants of Satan\\"), so the word \\"heretic\\" had negative associations from the beginning, and intentionally so. Before 325 AD, the \\"heretical\\" nature of some beliefs was a matter of much debate within the churches. After 325 AD, some opinion was formulated as dogma through the canons promulgated by the councils. Medieval Christian theology =Byzantine theology= While the Western Roman Empire declined and fell, the Eastern Roman Empire, centred on Constantinople, remained standing until 1453, and was the home of a wide range of theological activity that was seen as standing in strong continuity with the theology of the Patristic period; indeed the division between Patristic and Byzantine theology would not be recognised by many Orthodox theologians and historians.

Theology tended to become more localised, more diverse, more fragmented. The classically clothed Christianity preserved in Italy by men like Boethius and Cassiodorus was different from the vigorous Frankish Christianity documented by Gregory of Tours which was different again from the Christianity that flourished in Ireland and Northumbria in the 7th and 8th centuries. Throughout this period, theology tended to be a more monastic affair, flourishing in monastic havens where the conditions and resources for theological learning could be maintained. Important writers include: * Caesarius of Arles (c. 468–542) * Boethius (480–524) * Cassiodorus (c. 480–c. 585) * Pope Gregory I (c. 540–604) * Isidore of Seville (c. 560–636) * Bede (672–736) =Theology in the time of Charlemagne= Both because it made communication between different Christian centres easier, and because there was a concerted effort by its rulers to encourage educational and religious reforms and to develop greater uniformity in Christian thought and practice across their territories, the establishment of the Carolingian Empire saw an explosion of theological inquiry, and theological controversy. Controversy flared, for instance, around 'Spanish Adoptionism, around the views on predestination of Gottschalk, or around the eucharistic views of Ratramnus. Important writers include: * Alcuin (c. 735–804) * The Spanish Adoptionists Felix of Urgel and Elipandus of Toledo (late 8th century) * Rabanus Maurus (c. 780–856) * Radbertus (c. 790–865) * Ratramnus (died c. 868) * Hincmar (806–882) * Gottschalk (c. 808–c. 867) * Johannes Scotus Eriugena (c. 815–877) =Before Scholasticism= With the division and decline of the Carolingian Empire, notable theological activity was preserved in some of the cathedral schools that had begun to rise to prominence under it—for instance at Auxerre in the 9th century or Chartres in the 11th. Intellectual influences from the Arabic world (including works of classical authors preserved by Islamic scholars) percolated into the Christian West via Spain, influencing such theologians as Gerbert of Aurillac, who went on to become Pope Sylvester II and mentor to Otto III. (Otto was the fourth ruler of the Germanic Ottonian Holy Roman Empire, successor to the Carolingian Empire). With hindsight, one might say that a new note was struck when a controversy about the meaning of the eucharist blew up around Berengar of Tours in the 11th century: hints of a new confidence in the intellectual investigation of the faith that perhaps foreshadowed the explosion of theological argument that was to take place in the 12th century. Notable authors include: * Heiric of Auxerre (c. 835–887) * Remigius of Auxerre (c. 841–908) * Gerbert of Aurillac (c. 950–1003) * Fulbert of Chartres (died 1028) * Berengar of Tours (c. 999–1088) * Lanfranc (died 1089) =Scholasticism= Early scholasticism and its contemporaries Anselm of Canterbury is sometimes misleadingly called the 'Father of Scholasticism' because of the prominent place that reason has in his theology; instead of establishing his points by appeal to authority, he presents arguments to demonstrate why it is that the things he believes on authority must be so. His particular approach, however, was not very influential in his time, and he kept his distance from the cathedral schools. We should look instead to the production of the gloss on Scripture associated with Anselm of Laon, the rise to prominence of dialectic (middle subject of the medieval trivium) in the work of Abelard, and the production by Peter Lombard of a collection of Sentences or opinions of the Church Fathers and other authorities. Scholasticism proper can be thought of as the kind of theology that emerges when, in the cathedral schools and their successors, the tools of dialectic are pressed into use to comment upon, explain, and develop the gloss and the sentences. Notable authors include: * Anselm of CanterburyAnselm of Canterbury (1033/1034–1109) * Anselm of Laon (died 1117) * Hugh of St Victor (1078–1151) * Peter Abelard (1079–1142) * Bernard of Clairvaux (1090–1153) * Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) * Peter Lombard (c. 1100–1160) * Joachim of Fiore (c. 1135–1202) High Scholasticism and its contemporaries The 13th century saw the attempted suppression of various groups perceived as heterodox, such as the Cathars and Waldensians and the associated rise of the mendicant orders (notably the Franciscans and Dominicans), in part intended as a form of orthodox alternative to the heretical groups. Those two orders quickly became contexts for some of the most intense scholastic theology, producing such 'high scholastic' theologians as Alexander of Hales (Franciscan) and Thomas Aquinas (Dominican), or the rather less obviously scholastic Bonaventure (Franciscan). The century also saw a flourishing of mystical theology, with women such as Mechthild of Magdeburg playing a prominent role. In addition, the century can be seen as period in which the study of natural philosophy that could anachronistically be called 'science' began once again to flourish in theological soil, in the hands of such men as Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon. Notable authors include: Aquinas * Saint Dominic (1170–1221) * Robert Grosseteste (c. 1175–1253) * Francis of Assisi (1182–1226) * Alexander of Hales (died 1245) * Mechthild of Magdeburg (1210–1285) * Roger Bacon (1214–1294) * Bonaventure (1221–1274) * Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) * Angela of Foligno (1248–1309) Late Scholasticism and its contemporaries Scholastic theology continued to develop as the 13th century gave way to the fourteenth, becoming ever more complex and subtle in its distinctions and arguments. The 14th century saw in particular the rise to dominance of the nominalist or voluntarist theologies of men like William of Ockham. The 14th century was also a time in which movements of widely varying character worked for the reform of the institutional church, such as conciliarism, Lollardy and the Hussites. Spiritual movements such as the Devotio Moderna also flourished. Notable authors include: Catherine of Siena * Meister Eckhart (1260–1328) * Duns Scotus (1266–1308) * Marsilius of Padua (1270–1342) * William of Ockham (c. 1285–1349) * John Wycliffe (c. 1320–1384) * Julian of Norwich (1342–1413) * Geert Groote (1340–1384) * Catherine of Siena (1347–1380) * Jean Gerson (1363–1429) * Jan Hus (c. 1369–1415) * Thomas à Kempis (1380–1471) Renaissance and Reformation The Renaissance yielded scholars the ability to read the scriptures in their original languages and this in part stimulated the Reformation. Martin Luther, a Doctor in Bible at the University of Wittenburg,Brecht, Martin. Martin Luther. tr. James L. Schaaf, Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985–93, 1:12-27. began to teach that salvation is a gift of God's grace, attainable only through faith in Jesus, who in humility paid for sin.Wriedt, Markus. \\"Luther's Theology\\", in The Cambridge Companion to Luther. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2003, 88–94. \\"This one and firm rock, which we call the doctrine of justification\\", insisted Martin Luther, \\"is the chief article of the whole Christian doctrine, which comprehends the understanding of all godliness.\\"Selected passages from Martin Luther, \\"Commentary on Galatians (1538)\\" as translated in Herbert J. A. Bouman, \\"The Doctrine of Justification in the Lutheran Confessions\\", Concordia Theological Monthly 26 (November 1955) No. 11:801. Along with the doctrine of justification, the Reformation promoted a higher view of the Bible. As Martin Luther said, \\"The true rule is this: God's Word shall establish articles of faith, and no one else, not even an angel can do so.\\"Martin Luther, Smalcald Articles II, 15. These two ideas in turn promoted the concept of the priesthood of all believers. Other important reformers were John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli, Philipp Melanchthon, Martin Bucer and the Anabaptists. Their theology was modified by successors such as Theodore Beza, the English Puritans and Francis Turretin. Luther's seal =Lutheranism= Lutheranism is a major branch of Western Christianity that identifies with the teachings of Luther. Luther's efforts to reform the theology and practice of the church launched The Reformation. As a result of the reactions of his contemporaries, Christianity was divided.MSN Encarta, s.v. \\"Lutheranism \\" by George Wolfgang Forell; Christian Cyclopedia, s.v. \\"Reformation, Lutheran\\" by Theore Hoyer. Archived 2009-10-31. Luther's insights were a major foundation of the Protestant movement. The start of the Reformation The sale of indulgences shown in A Question to a Mintmaker, woodcut by Jörg Breu the Elder of Augsburg, c. 1530. Door of the Schlosskirche (castle church) in Wittenberg to which Luther is said to have nailed his 95 Theses, sparking the Reformation. In 1516–17, Johann Tetzel, a Dominican friar and papal commissioner for indulgences, was sent to Germany by the Roman Catholic Church to sell indulgences to raise money to rebuild St Peter's Basilica in Rome.\\"Johann Tetzel\\", Encyclopædia Britannica, 2007: \\"Tetzel's experiences as a preacher of indulgences, especially between 1503 and 1510, led to his appointment as general commissioner by Albrecht, archbishop of Mainz, who, deeply in debt to pay for a large accumulation of benefices, had to contribute a considerable sum toward the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Albrecht obtained permission from Pope Leo X to conduct the sale of a special plenary indulgence (i.e., remission of the temporal punishment of sin), half of the proceeds of which Albrecht was to claim to pay the fees of his benefices. In effect, Tetzel became a salesman whose product was to cause a scandal in Germany that evolved into the greatest crisis (the Reformation) in the history of the Western church.\\" Roman Catholic theology stated that faith alone, whether fiduciary or dogmatic, cannot justify man;(Trent, l. c., can. xii: \\"Si quis dixerit, fidem justificantem nihil aliud esse quam fiduciam divinae misericordiae, peccata remittentis propter Christum, vel eam fiduciam solam esse, qua justificamur, a.s.\\") and that only such faith as is active in charity and good works (fides caritate formata) can justify man.(cf. Trent, Sess. VI, cap. iv, xiv) One such good work is donating money to the church. On 31 October 1517, Luther wrote to Albrecht, Archbishop of Mainz and Magdeburg, protesting the sale of indulgences. He enclosed in his letter a copy of his \\"Disputation of Martin Luther on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences\\", which came to be known as The 95 Theses. Hans Hillerbrand writes that Luther had no intention of confronting the church, but saw his disputation as a scholarly objection to church practices, and the tone of the writing is accordingly \\"searching, rather than doctrinaire\\".Hillerbrand, Hans J. \\"Martin Luther: Indulgences and salvation\\", Encyclopædia Britannica, 2007. Hillerbrand writes that there is nevertheless an undercurrent of challenge in several of the theses, particularly in Thesis 86, which asks: \\"Why does the pope, whose wealth today is greater than the wealth of the richest Crassus, build the basilica of St. Peter with the money of poor believers rather than with his own money?\\" Luther objected to a saying attributed to Johann Tetzel that \\"As soon as the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory springs\\",Bainton, Roland. Here I Stand: a Life of Martin Luther. New York: Penguin, 1995, 60; Brecht, Martin. Martin Luther. tr. James L. Schaaf, Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985–93, 1:182; Kittelson, James. Luther The Reformer. Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress Publishing House, 1986),104. insisting that, since forgiveness was God's alone to grant, those who claimed that indulgences absolved buyers from all punishments and granted them salvation were in error. Christians, he said, must not slacken in following Christ on account of such false assurances. According to Philipp Melanchthon, writing in 1546, Luther nailed a copy of the 95 Theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg that same day--church doors acting as the bulletin boards of his time--an event now seen as sparking the Protestant Reformation,\\"Luther's lavatory thrills experts\\", BBC News, October 22, 2004. and celebrated each year on 31 October as Reformation Day. Some scholars have questioned the accuracy of Melanchthon's account, noting that no contemporaneous evidence exists for it.Iserloh, Erwin. The Theses Were Not Posted. Toronto: Saunders of Toronto, Ltd., 1966. Others have countered that no such evidence is necessary, because this was the customary way of advertising an event on a university campus in Luther's day.Junghans, Helmer. \\"Luther's Wittenberg\\", in McKim, Donald K. (ed.) The Cambridge Companion to Martin Luther. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2003, 26. The 95 Theses were quickly translated from Latin into German, printed, and widely copied, making the controversy one of the first in history to be aided by the printing press.Brecht, Martin. Martin Luther. tr. James L. Schaaf, Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985–93, 1:204-205. Within two weeks, the theses had spread throughout Germany; within two months throughout Europe. =Justification by faith= From 1510 to 1520, Luther lectured on the Psalms, the books of Hebrews, Romans, and Galatians. As he studied these portions of the Bible, he came to view the use of terms such as penance and righteousness by the Roman Catholic Church in new ways. He became convinced that the church was corrupt in their ways and had lost sight of what he saw as several of the central truths of Christianity, the most important of which, for Luther, was the doctrine of justification--God's act of declaring a sinner righteous--by faith alone through God's grace. He began to teach that salvation or redemption is a gift of God's grace, attainable only through faith in Jesus as the messiah. Luther came to understand justification as entirely the work of God. Against the teaching of his day that the righteous acts of believers are performed in cooperation with God, Luther wrote that Christians receive such righteousness entirely from outside themselves; that righteousness not only comes from Christ but actually is the righteousness of Christ, imputed to Christians (rather than infused into them) through faith.Dorman, Ted M., \\"Justification as Healing: The Little-Known Luther \\", Quodlibet Journal: Volume 2 Number 3, Summer 2000. Retrieved 13 July 2007. \\"That is why faith alone makes someone just and fulfills the law\\", he wrote. \\"Faith is that which brings the Holy Spirit through the merits of Christ.\\" Faith, for Luther, was a gift from God. He explained his concept of \\"justification\\" in the Smalcald Articles: =Response of the papacy= Cardinal Albrecht of Hohenzollern, Archbishop of Mainz and Magdeburg, was using part of the indulgence income to pay bribery debts;Rupp, Ernst Gordon. \\"Martin Luther\\", Encyclopædia Britannica, accessed 2006. portrait by Albrecht Dürer, 1519 Pope Leo X by Raphael. In contrast to the speed with which the theses were distributed, the response of the papacy was painstakingly slow. Cardinal Albrecht of Hohenzollern, Archbishop of Mainz and Magdeburg, with the consent of Pope Leo X, was using part of the indulgence income to pay his bribery debts, and did not reply to Luther's letter; instead, he had the theses checked for heresy and forwarded to Rome.Treu, Martin. Martin Luther in Wittenberg: A Biographical Tour. Wittenberg: Saxon-Anhalt Luther Memorial Foundation, 2003, 31. Leo responded over the next three years, \\"with great care as is proper\\",Papal Bull Exsurge Domine. by deploying a series of papal theologians and envoys against Luther. Perhaps he hoped the matter would die down of its own accord, because in 1518 he dismissed Luther as \\"a drunken German\\" who \\"when sober will change his mind\\".Schaff, Philip. History of the Christian Church. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1910, 7:99; Polack, W.G. The Story of Luther. St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1931, 45. =Widening breach= Luther's writings circulated widely, reaching France, England, and Italy as early as 1519, and students thronged to Wittenberg to hear him speak. He published a short commentary on Galatians and his Work on the Psalms. At the same time, he received deputations from Italy and from the Utraquists of Bohemia; Ulrich von Hutten and Franz von Sickingen offered to place Luther under their protection.Macauley Jackson, Samuel and Gilmore, George William. (eds.) \\"Martin Luther\\", The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, New York, London, Funk and Wagnalls Co., 1908–1914; Grand Rapids, Michigan: Baker Book House, 1951), 71. This early portion of Luther's career was one of his most creative and productive.Spitz, Lewis W. The Renaissance and Reformation Movements, St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1987, 338. Three of his best known works were published in 1520: To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation, On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church, and On the Freedom of a Christian. Finally on 30 May 1519, when the Pope demanded an explanation, Luther wrote a summary and explanation of his theses to the Pope. While the Pope may have conceded some of the points, he did not like the challenge to his authority so he summoned Luther to Rome to answer these. At that point Frederick the Wise, the Saxon Elector, intervened. He did not want one of his subjects to be sent to Rome to be judged by the Catholic clergy so he prevailed on the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, who needed Frederick's support, to arrange a compromise. An arrangement was effected, however, whereby that summons was cancelled, and Luther went to Augsburg in October 1518 to meet the papal legate, Cardinal Thomas Cajetan. The argument was long but nothing was resolved.First edition of Exsurge Domine. =Excommunication= On 15 June 1520, the Pope warned Luther with the papal bull (edict) Exsurge Domine that he risked excommunication unless he recanted 41 sentences drawn from his writings, including the 95 Theses, within 60 days. That autumn, Johann Eck proclaimed the bull in Meissen and other towns. Karl von Miltitz, a papal nuncio, attempted to broker a solution, but Luther, who had sent the Pope a copy of On the Freedom of a Christian in October, publicly set fire to the bull and decretals at Wittenberg on 10 December 1520,Brecht, Martin. (tr. Wolfgang Katenz) \\"Luther, Martin\\", in Hillerbrand, Hans J. (ed.) Oxford Encyclopedia of the Reformation. New York: Oxford University Press, 1996, 2:463. an act he defended in Why the Pope and his Recent Book are Burned and Assertions Concerning All Articles. As a consequence, Luther was excommunicated by Leo X on 3 January 1521, in the bull Decet Romanum Pontificem. =Political maneuvering= What had started as a strictly theological and academic debate had now turned into something of a social and political conflict as well, pitting Luther, his German allies and Northern European supporters against [Charles V, Holy Roman EmperorCharles V], France, the Italian Pope, their territories and other allies. The conflict would erupt into a religious war after Luther's death, fueled by the political climate of the Holy Roman Empire and strong personalities on both sides. In 1526, at the First Diet of Speyer, it was decided that, until a General Council could meet and settle the theological issues raised by Martin Luther, the Edict of Worms would not be enforced and each Prince could decide if Lutheran teachings and worship would be allowed in his territories. In 1529, at the Second Diet of Speyer, the decision the previous Diet of Speyer was reversed—despite the strong protests of the Lutheran princes, free cities and some Zwinglian territories. These states quickly became known as Protestants. At first, this term Protestant was used politically for the states that resisted the Edict of Worms. Over time, however, this term came to be used for the religious movements that opposed the Roman Catholic tradition in the 16th century. Lutheranism would become known as a separate movement after the 1530 Diet of Augsburg, which was convened by Charles V to try to stop the growing Protestant movement. At the Diet, Philipp Melanchthon presented a written summary of Lutheran beliefs called the Augsburg Confession. Several of the German princes (and later, kings and princes of other countries) signed the document to define \\"Lutheran\\" territories. These princes would ally to create the Schmalkaldic League in 1531, which led to the Schmalkald War, 1547, a year after Luther's death, that pitted the Lutheran princes of the Schmalkaldic League against the Catholic forces of Charles V. After the conclusion of the Schmalkald War, Charles V attempted to impose Catholic religious doctrine on the territories that he had defeated. However, the Lutheran movement was far from defeated. In 1577, the next generation of Lutheran theologians gathered the work of the previous generation to define the doctrine of the persisting Lutheran church. This document is known as the Formula of Concord. In 1580, it was published with the Augsburg Confession, the Apology of the Augsburg Confession, the Large and Small Catechisms of Martin Luther, the Smalcald Articles and the Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope. Together they were distributed in a volume entitled The Book of Concord. This book is still used today. =Results of the Lutheran reformation= Luther's followers and the Roman Catholic Church broke fellowship during the Protestant Reformation. In the years and decades following Luther's posting of the 95 theses on the door of the Wittenberg church, large numbers of Europeans abandoned observance of papal authority, including the majority of German speakers. Following the Counter-Reformation, Catholic Austria and Bavaria, together with the electoral archbishops of Mainz, Cologne, and Trier consolidated the Catholic position on the German-speaking section of the European continent. Because Luther sparked this mass movement, he is known as the father of the Protestant Reformation, and the father of Protestantism in general. =Calvinism= =Arminianism= * Humans are naturally unable to make any effort towards salvation * Salvation is possible by grace alone * Works of human effort cannot cause or contribute to salvation * God's election is conditional on faith in Jesus * Jesus' atonement was potentially for all people * God allows his grace to be resisted by those unwilling to believe * Salvation can be lost, as continued salvation is conditional upon continued faith =Orthodox Reformation= The fall of Constantinople in the East, 1453, led to a significant shift of gravity to the rising state of Russia, the \\"Third Rome\\". The Renaissance would also stimulate a program of reforms by patriarchs of prayer books. A movement called the \\"Old Believers\\" consequently resulted and influenced Russian Orthodox theology in the direction of conservatism and Erastianism. Counter-Reformation The Roman Catholic counter-reformation spearheaded by the Jesuits under Ignatius Loyola took their theology from the decisions of the Council of Trent, and developed Second Scholasticism, which they pitted against Lutheran Scholasticism. The overall result of the Reformation was therefore to highlight distinctions of belief that had previously co-existed uneasily. =The Council of Trent= The Council in Santa Maria Maggiore church; Museo Diocesiano Tridentino, Trento Revivalism (1720-1906) =First Great Awakening= =Second Great Awakening= =Third Great Awakening= Restoration Movement The Restoration Movement (also known as the \\"Stone- Campbell Movement\\") generally refers to the \\"American Restoration Movement\\", which began on the American frontier during the Second Great Awakening of the early 19th century. The movement sought to reform the church and unite Christians. Barton W. Stone and Alexander Campbell each independently developed similar approaches to the Christian faith, seeking to restore the whole Christian church, on the pattern set forth in the New Testament. Both groups believed that creeds kept Christianity divided. They joined in fellowship in 1832 with a handshake. They were united, among other things, in the belief that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, that churches celebrate the Lord's Supper on the first day of each week, and that baptism of adult believers, by immersion in water, is a necessary condition for Salvation. The Restoration Movement began as two separate threads, each of which initially developed without the knowledge of the other, during the Second Great Awakening in the early 19th century. The first, led by Barton W. Stone began at Cane Ridge, Bourbon County, Kentucky. The group called themselves simply Christians. The second, began in western Pennsylvania and Virginia (now West Virginia), led by Thomas Campbell and his son, Alexander Campbell. Because the founders wanted to abandon all denominational labels, they used the biblical names for the followers of Jesus that they found in the Bible.McAlister, Lester G. and Tucker, William E. (1975), Journey in Faith: A History of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) – St. Louis, Chalice Press, Both groups promoted a return to the purposes of the 1st-century churches as described in the New Testament. One historian of the movement has argued that it was primarily a unity movement, with the restoration motif playing a subordinate role. The Restoration Movement has seen several divisions, resulting in multiple separate groups. Three modern groups claim the Stone Campbell movement as their roots: Churches of Christ, Christian churches and churches of Christ, and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Some see divisions in the movement as the result of the tension between the goals of restoration and ecumenism, with the Churches of Christ and Christian churches and churches of Christ resolving the tension by stressing restoration while the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) resolved the tension by stressing ecumenism.Leroy Garrett, The Stone-Campbell Movement: The Story of the American Restoration Movement, College Press, 2002, , , 573 pages Restorationism *The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints *Jehovah's Witnesses Modern Christian theology After the Reformation Protestant groups continued to splinter, leading to a range of new theologies. The \\"Enthusiasts\\" were so named because of their emotional zeal. These included the Methodists, the Quakers and Baptists. Another group sought to reconcile Christian faith with \\"Modern\\" ideas, sometimes causing them to reject beliefs they considered to be illogical, including the Nicene creed and Chalcedonian Creed. these included Unitarians and Universalists. A major issue for Protestants became the degree to which Man contributes to his salvation. The debate is often viewed as synergism versus monergism, though the labels Calvinist and Arminian are more frequently used, referring to the conclusion of the Synod of Dort. The 19th century saw the rise of biblical criticism, new knowledge of religious diversity in other continents and above all the growth of science. This led many church men to espouse a form of Deism. This, along with concepts such as the brotherhood of man and a rejection of miracles led to what is called \\"Classic Liberalism\\". Immensely influential in its day, classic liberalism suffered badly as a result of the two world wars and fell prey to the criticisms of postmodernism. Vladimir Lossky is a famous Eastern Orthodox theologian writing in the 20th century for the Greek church. Modern Catholic response to Protestantism Well into the 20th century, Catholics—even if no longer resorting to persecution—still defined Protestants as heretics. Thus, Hilaire Belloc – in his time one of the most conspicuous speakers for Catholicism in Britain – was outspoken about the \\"Protestant Heresy\\". He even defined Islam as being \\"A Christian heresy\\", on the grounds that Muslims accept many of the tenets of Christianity but deny the godhood of Jesus (see Hilaire Belloc#On Islam). However, in the second half of the century – and especially in the wake of Vatican II – the Catholic Church, in the spirit of ecumenism, tends not to refer to Protestantism as a heresy nowadays, even if the teachings of Protestantism are indeed heretical from a Catholic perspective. Modern usage favors referring to Protestants as \\"separated brethren\\" rather than \\"heretics\\", although the latter is still on occasion used vis-a-vis Catholics who abandon their church to join a Protestant denomination. Many Catholics consider Protestantism to be material rather than formal heresy, and thus non-culpable. Some of the doctrines of Protestantism that the Catholic Church considers heretical are the belief that the Bible is the only source and rule of faith (\\"sola scriptura\\"), that faith alone can lead to salvation (\\"sola fide\\") and that there is no sacramental, ministerial priesthood attained by ordination, but only a universal priesthood of all believers. Postmodern Christianity Postmodern theology seeks to respond to the challenges of post modern and deconstructionist thought, and has included the death of God movement, process theology, feminist theology and Queer Theology and most importantly neo-orthodox theology. Karl Barth, Rudolf Bultmann and Reinhold Niebuhr were neo-orthodoxies main representatives. In particular Barth labeled his theology \\"dialectical theology\\", a reference to existentialism. The predominance of Classic Liberalism resulted in many reactionary movements amongst conservative believers. Evangelical theology, Pentecostal or renewal theology and fundamentalist theology, often combined with dispensationalism, all moved from the fringe into the academy. Marxism stimulated the significant rise of Liberation theology which can be interpreted as a rejection of academic theology that fails to challenge the establishment and help the poor. From the late 19th century to the early twentieth groups established themselves that derived many of their beliefs from Protestant evangelical groups but significantly differed in doctrine. These include the Jehovah's Witnesses, the Latter Day Saints and many so called \\"cults\\". Many of these groups use the Protestant version of the Bible and typically interpret it in a fundamentalist fashion, adding, however, special prophecy or scriptures, and typically denying the trinity and the full deity of Jesus Christ. Ecumenical Theology sought to discover a common consensus on theological matters that could bring the many Christian denominations together. As a movement it was successful in helping to provide a basis for the establishment of the World Council of Churches and for some reconciliation between more established denominations. But ecumenical theology was nearly always the concern of liberal theologians, often Protestant ones. The movement for ecumenism was opposed especially by fundamentalists and viewed as flawed by many neo-orthodox theologians. =Liberation theology= =Radical Orthodoxy= Radical Orthodoxy is a form of philosophical theology that has been influenced by the Nouvelle Theologie, especially of Henri de Lubac. An ecumenical movement begun by John Milbank and others at Cambridge, Radical Orthodoxy seeks to examine classic Christian writings and related neoplatonic texts in full dialogue with contemporary, philosophical perspectives. Predominantly Anglican and Roman Catholic in orientation, it has received positive responses from high places in those communions: one of the movement's founders, Catherine Pickstock, received a letter of praise from Joseph Ratzinger before he became Pope, while Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, has contributed to the movement's publications. A major hearth of Radical Orthodoxy remains the Centre of Theology and Philosophy at the University of Nottingham. =Weak theology= Weak theology is a branch of postmodern Christianity that has been influenced by the deconstructive thought of Jacques Derrida, including Derrida's description of a moral experience he calls \\"the weak force.\\"; Weak theology rejects the idea that God is an overwhelming physical or metaphysical force. Instead, God is an unconditional claim without any force whatsoever. As a claim without force, the God of weak theology does not intervene in nature. As a result, weak theology emphasizes the responsibility of humans to act in this world here and now.

Gameplay Players are dealt 13 cards each and must sort their hand into 4 Brag hands of three cards, or if you are lucky enough, in 3 sets of 4 of a kind, discarding the last remaining card. The hands rank is the same as Brag with the highest ranking hand being, 3 threes . All other hands are the same. Once the players have sorted their hands, each plays their highest ranked hand, and the player playing the highest gains one point. If hands are tied, no-one scores. Players then play their second-best hands, then their third best, then final hands. Note that not all players accept 'high card' hands, and many do not accept 'pairs', which means that it is quite common for a player not to have four hands. 'Crashing' Crashing in this game involve a person predicting they are going to win all 4 hands and calling 'crash'. If they win all after predicting they will win all 4 hands usually there is a financial reward usually 1 pound. If a player wins all 4 hands they without calling crash they usually receive a 50 pence reward. If they call crash and do not win all 4 hands they usually have to pay a financial penalty of 50 pence to each player (a cost of 50p to £1.50 depending on whether it is 2,3 or 4 player playing) Gambling The game is very popular in pubs and bars in the UK, and sometimes gambling is involved. All these rules depend on the rules of the house: * * An entry fee is used into a prize kitty and all players pay regardless of if they play or not commonly £1. * If more than 4 players are involved, every player gets dealt a card, and if they receive a jack they enter the game, then stop receiving cards. This goes on until all players are dealt jacks. * At the end of the game, every player except the winner must pay the winner for each point not earned (usually 20p). * If a player crashes then the money for each point not earned is doubled, i.e. player B won on a crash, then Player C owes £2.80; however, this win can only be earned if a player needs more than 4 points to win. * If a player receives 4 of a kind in a hand, then as long as he has the best hand in a go, in the event of 2 or more players receiving a 4 of a kind, then they receive half the entry bet off each player in the game, usually 50p. Hand ranking The Highest ranking hand is 4 of a kind starting with 4 fours followed by Aces, Kings etc. Next it's 3 of a kind starting with Aces Kings and so on. After this, a Run of the same suit, also called Bouncer (all the way through is worth more than a regular run), Ace, 2, 3 the highest Run, followed by Ace, King, Queen and so on.

They were historically awarded to teams and individuals representing South Africa in international competition of any sport, following their creation in 1906. With the arrival of South Africa's new post-apartheid government in 1994, the name Springbok was abandoned by the various control boards since they felt that the term had been abused by the previous apartheid governments, and stigmatised by the anti-apartheid movement. An exception was made in the case of the national rugby union team, who have retained the practice of awarding colours.  History  The first springbok logo was introduced in 1906 during a Springboks tour The first Springbok colours were created in 1906 during the 1906–07 South Africa rugby union tour of the Northern Hemisphere as none had been provided for them and the captain Paul Roos decided that the team need to create their own emblem and nickname to prevent the British press creating one for them. Using the guidelines that the director of the South African Rugby Board (SARB) had given for the playing kit of myrtle green jerseys and a gold collar, Roos instructed that a green blazer with gold piping and a Springbok emblem on the breast pocket would be made for the team in Richmond. Despite this, not many colours were made as they were not standard issue at the time. Later on they became standard issue for all sportsmen representing South Africa internationally but primarily was used by rugby union as the creators. The South Africa rugby union team wearing Springbok colours in 1937 The first dispute over Springbok colours came from the rise of rugby league in South Africa in the 1950s. SARB felt it was their duty as members of the International Rugby Football Board to defend amateur rugby union against professional rugby league after several Springboks had defected to rugby league. In 1959, the SARB declared that all players that represented South Africa in rugby union had to sign a declaration they would not turn professional for two years. Any player who refused this was obliged to return his Springbok colours and was not permitted to purchase a replacement.Conellisen, 13 In 1963, the SARB took the step of copyrighting the Springbok emblem and Springbok colours as a badge under the Heraldry Act to pre-empt any other sporting body copyrighting it. The board initially declared, it was happy to share the Springbok colours providing that they were only awarded to white amateur sportspeople representing South Africa internationally.Conellisen, 18–19 It was also an attempt to try and stop the South Africa national rugby league team from using the colours, though Rugby League South Africa circumvented this by developing their own version of the Springbok colours. Later legislation in 1971 was passed in order to enforce apartheid so that only white South Africans could be awarded Springbok colours though this later extended to those deemed as \\"honorary whites\\". This came after three black Africans were awarded Springbok colours for competing in the World Paraplegic Games. Later as a result of the legislation, Glen Popham was not awarded Springbok colours following winning a gold medal in Karate in the 1969 South African Games alongside his white team, as his race was officially classified as Coloured which the South African National Olympic Committee were not aware of prior. As non-whites were not eligible to be selected for South African national sports teams, the Springbok colours came to be viewed as a symbol of white supremacy in apartheid South Africa because they were only awarded to white sportspeople.  Post apartheid  Following the repeal of apartheid legislation, Springbok colours started to be issued to non-whites. In 1994, following the election of Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress, the National Colours Board was set up to control the distribution of Springbok colours. Despite this, the majority of South Africa's sporting organisations stopped awarding Springbok colours, following the replacement of the Springbok by the Protea as the country's national sporting emblem by government demand. The only sporting body in South Africa that was allowed to retain Springbok colours was the South African Rugby Union as an act of conciliation towards the white minority who made up the majority of the national rugby union team. In 2008, the South African Sports Minister claimed under the National Sport and Recreation Act, 1998, that the Springbok colours copyright had been transferred to the government and the SARU had been issuing it illegally and requested they cease using it. However, legal writers stated that the South African government's claim had expired in 2007 while SARU's copyright still was valid and pursuant to the case of In re: Certification of the Constitution of the RSA 1996, if the government tried to stop the SARU issuing Springbok colours, then the government would be liable to pay millions of Rands in compensation. In 2013, as part of their \\"Yesterday's Heroes\\" programme, SARU retrospectively awarded Springbok colours to all non-whites who had played for a South African national team such as the black SAARB Leopards and the Coloured Proteas. Springbok colours are only awarded to South Africans. Australian Eddie Jones, who worked as a technical advisor to South Africa for the 2007 Rugby World Cup, was not allowed Springbok colours as a non-South African and was obliged to wear a South Africa tracksuit when pitchside. Following South Africa's victory that year, all other players and coaching team members were expected to wear their Springbok colours to the post-tournament awards dinner. In protest at Jones not being issued with colours, Bryan Habana gave his to Jones and the team attended the awards dinner in suits instead.

In literature The cover to the 2017 book Essays in Anarchism and Religion features Paradise Lost engravings by Gustave Doré *In addition to printing an illustrated edition of the poem, much of the mystic poetry of William Blake is a direct response to or rewriting of Paradise Lost. Blake emphasized the rebellious, satanic elements of the epic; the repressive character Urizen in the Four Zoas is a tyrannical version of Milton's God. In addition to his famous quip in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell about Milton belonging to the devil's party, Blake wrote Milton: a Poem which has Milton, like Satan, rejecting a life in Heaven. *Paradise Lost influenced Mary Shelley when she wrote her novel Frankenstein. Shelly uses a quote from Book X of Paradise Lost on the epigram page of her novel and Paradise Lost is one of three books Frankenstein's monster finds; this, therefore, influences his psychological growth. The concept of the \\"Fallen Angel,\\" an epithet of Satan, is used to both describe the protagonist, Victor, and to describe his monster. *Poet Percy Bysshe Shelley specifically notes in the preface to his lyrical drama Prometheus Unbound that he constructed his character Prometheus in part as an attempt to revise Milton's Satan. *In C.

Background  Orton's screenplay was a revised version of a 1966 script called Shades of a Personality, by Owen Holder, which producer Walter Shenson wanted Orton to \\"punch-up\\", in his words; Orton incorporated portions of this prior draft, but used, as the opening of the story, a concept he and his companion Kenneth Halliwell had explored in a now-lost novel from 1957, The Silver Bucket. The story's skeleton also borrowed liberally from Orton's final novel, written in 1959, called The Vision of Gombold Provol (posthumously published as Head to Toe). After a proper contract had been drawn up, allowing Orton to buy back the rights to his script should it be refused, Orton submitted the script to the Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein; after a long period without hearing from either Epstein or the Beatles on the subject, his screenplay was returned to him without comment. Orton further revised Up Against It after this event, paring down the four leads to three (mainly by combining the George and Ringo parts). Producer Oscar Lewenstein accepted the script, considering Mick Jagger and Ian McKellen for two of the leads. Lewenstein and Orton planned a meeting with director Richard Lester at Twickenham Film Studios to discuss filming options on the script. On the morning the chauffeur arrived to take Orton to the meeting, he discovered Orton and Halliwell dead inside their home. Halliwell had bludgeoned Orton to death with a hammer and then committed suicide with an overdose of Nembutal tablets.  Synopsis  The screenplay begins with the expulsion from a provincial town of two young men of no fixed ambition, Ian McTurk and Christopher Low; Ian is a sexually profligate charmer, Low quixotic and pure of heart. They are banished because Ian has deflowered Rowena Torrence, niece of the local high priest, Father Brodie; present to see them off are amiably opportunistic Mayor Terence O'Scullion, sexually dangerous police official Connie Boon (\\"rhymes with loon\\", the Mayor says), and plain-Jane secretary Miss Patricia Drumgoole, who is desperately in love with Ian. Wandering the woods outside of town, Christopher meets and winds up at the mansion of eccentric millionaire Bernard Coates; also present at the mansion is the sinister Connie, who frightens the innocent Low into sexual slavery. Meanwhile, Ian has fled the scene, enraged by Miss Drumgoole's revelation that Rowena is to marry Coates. He comes upon a group of anarchists led by Jack Ramsay, a rootless troublemaker whose plan is to assassinate the new (female) Prime Minister. Also in Ramsay's ragged cadre are the deposed Mayor, embittered kept boy Christopher, and Miss Drumgoole, now a government clerk out to commit sabotage. Jack, Ian, and Christopher affect female drag to gain entrance to the Royal Albert Hall, where Jack guns down the PM. They escape. Later, Jack disrupts the Prime Minister's funeral march with a speech in favor of public debauchery and an end to private perversion. The crowd finds this notion not merely sensible but appealing. A riot ensues, and the three hide out in the newsagent's shop of Jack's wizened anarchist father. Ian is lured away by the treacherous Rowena, and captured; Jack and Christopher are cornered by police and shot down. For the next ten years Ian languishes in prison -- before being liberated by the miraculously still-living, and patiently tunnel-digging, Jack. They make their escape through a sewer and into the sea, where they are pulled into a luxury yacht attended by none other than Christopher Low; it seems he is cabin boy to Rowena and Coates, who are now married. A mad tea party follows, attended by all three heroes, Rowena, Coates, the Mayor and his wife, and Miss Drumgoole. Ian again tries and fails to seduce Rowena; while Miss Drumgoole, still in love with Ian, throws herself overboard when he rejects her. Before they can be arrested, Jack, Ian, and Christopher abscond in the lifeboat; they find Miss Drumgoole adrift, whereupon they are caught in a storm. Ian awakens on a beach and is taken to a hospital, where Connie reappears to draft him into the war now being fought between government and rebel forces. At the recruitment center he reunites with Jack and Christopher; they convince him to go over to the rebels. The three go off to battle, where Ian is wounded and they again cross paths with Miss Drumgoole. The Mayor turns up, as does Jack's father; sides are switched again, and still again. Finally the bickering crew crash their stolen ambulance into a lorry carrying wounded -- and in an epic disaster scene, a series of escalating conflagrations climaxes in the opening of the earth itself to swallow the dead, the dying, the wounded, and even their scurrying medics. At which point Father Brodie materializes, surrounded in sepulchral procession by the chants and prayers of the faithful, to bless the hellish battlefield. Ian sobs, Christopher kneels in spiritual surrender, and Jack loses his mind. All are taken prisoner -- only to be given medals and honored as heroes: their initial ambulance crash, it seems, resulted in the winning of the war and defeat of the rebels. Jack's anarchist father is now a decorated general; the Mayor has been restored to power; and Christopher is engaged to Connie. But in a welter of last-minute reversals, the world is set off-balance yet again. Christopher, appalled once too often by Connie's virulent sexism, calls off their engagement; Jack's father finds himself demoted to hotel bellhop; and Ian, though he still loves Rowena, offers himself to the faithful Miss Drumgoole. (\\"My heart is broken, but everything else is in working order.\\") She accepts the proposal of marriage -- to all three heroes. Ian, Jack, and Christopher wed Miss Drumgoole in a mass officiated by Father Brodie and attended by the whole happy cast, and the screenplay ends with bride and grooms in polygamous morning-after intimacy, disappearing with squeals of delight under the conjugal sheets.  Legacy  The revised version of Up Against It was first published, with an introduction by Orton's biographer John Lahr, in 1979; the original draft has never been published. The manuscript of this draft resides in the Joe Orton Collection at the University of Leicester. Although the actual screenplay has never been staged or filmed, a musical theatre adaptation of Up Against It opened Off Broadway on 14 November 1989, with music by Todd Rundgren. Tony-nominee Alison Fraser appeared in it. A recording of Rundgren's song demos for the show was released in Japan in 1997 (Up Against It!). Several recorded songs from the show, however, appeared on Rundgren's albums Nearly Human and 2nd Wind.  Radio Play  A 90-minute radio play, produced by Armada and adapted by John Fletcher and directed by John Adams, (featuring various Beatles songs interspersed), was broadcast in September 1997 in the UK on BBC Radio 3. It included Fawlty Towers′ Prunella Scales and Blur's singer Damon Albarn in the cast (who enters 25 minutes in), plus Leo McKern as the narrator (who previously starred as the villain in Help!).

History =Early White House cooks and chefs= Beginning with George Washington, slaves prepared food for American presidents, First Families, and for social gatherings. Although slavery ended in the United States after the American Civil War, African Americans continued to provide nearly all the cooking in the White House kitchen. Occasionally, a professional chef was used beginning in the latter half of the 19th century. President Ulysses S. Grant employed a Union Army cook until his embarrassed wife forced him to hire an Italian-trained chef. President Rutherford B. Hayes used the services of cook and nurse Winnie Monroe, a freed African American slave. Chester Arthur used a cook who formerly worked at his private residence as his White House chef for casual dining, and hired French-trained professional chef Alexander Fortin to oversee preparation of important political meals and state dinners. President Grover Cleveland also used a French chef to prepare his meals during his first term. President Benjamin Harrison had a French chef as well, but fired him after only a short time in favor of the services of Dolly Johnson, a freed African American slave who had cooked for the Harrisons in Indianapolis. President William McKinley hired a local cook for everyday dining, but a French-trained chef traveled from New York City to prepare formal dinners. Swedish native Sigrid Nilsson served as President Woodrow Wilson's chief cook at the White House from 1915 to 1919.; American-trained professional chef Alice Howard served presidents Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson, while \\"head cook\\" Katherine Buckley worked for Herbert Hoover and Henrietta Nesbitt served as housekeeper and head cook for Franklin D. Roosevelt. Vietta Garr, President Harry S. Truman's long-time personal cook and domestic assistant, came to the White House as head cook in 1945 after Truman fired Nesbitt for insubordination. Dwight D. Eisenhower used the services of French- trained chef François Rysavy from 1954 to 1957; and former United States Navy chef Pedro Udo (a Filipino) from 1957 to 1960. Zephyr Wright, one of the last personal chefs to work in the White House, prepared meals for President Lyndon B. Johnson. =Executive Chef= Dolly Johnson, personal cook to President Benjamin Harrison, in the small White House kitchen in 1890 In 1961, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy reorganized the White House staff under her supervision, and created the title of Executive Chef for the first time. Kennedy hired French-born and -trained chef René Verdon, who served until 1965. Verdon established a new standard for White House dining, one in which only the highest quality ingredients and cooking techniques were acceptable. The first meal he crafted for the White House, a lunch for British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, was featured on the front page of The New York Times.; Verdon resigned at the end of 1965 in a dispute with President Lyndon B. Johnson over the cuisine being offered at the White House. The Johnsons brought long-time family cook Zephyr Wright to the Executive Residence, where she became the First Family's personal chef. For formal dining, the Johnsons hired 43-year-old Swiss-born and -trained chef Henry Haller to be Executive Chef. Haller proved so popular that he remained in the position until October 1, 1987. Jon Hill, a 33-year-old American-born and -trained chef, served as Executive Chef from October 1, 1987, to January 8, 1988. Hill resigned after First Lady Nancy Reagan expressed significant disapproval of his cooking and presentation. He was replaced by White House assistant chef Hans Raffert. Raffert, a German-born chef who trained throughout Europe, joined the Nixon White House kitchen staff in 1969, and was the first White House chef to create a gingerbread house as part of the Executive Residence Christmas decorations. Raffert was 60 when he became Executive Chef, and retired in October 1992 just before he turned 65. French-born and trained chef Pierre Chambrin succeeded Raffert as Executive Chef, but he was asked to resign in March 1994 after refusing to cook the low-fat American cuisine favored by President Bill and First Lady Hillary Clinton. Walter Scheib was appointed Executive Chef in April 1994. While his tenure under the Clintons was a happy one, he had a more difficult time meeting the needs of President George W. Bush, First Lady Laura Bush, and Mrs. Bush's Social Secretary, Lea Berman. Laura Bush wanted a more formal presentation, and President Bush disliked soup, salad, and poached fish—staples of Scheib's cuisine.; Scheib was fired by the Bushes in February 2005, and succeeded in August 2005 by Cristeta Comerford, a White House sous-chef whom Scheib had hired in 1995. Comerford was the first woman to be selected for the post. President Barack Obama retained Comerford as Executive Chef, but brought chef Sam Kass from Chicago to act as the First Family's personal chef. Kass, who assumed several policy positions in the White House as well, resigned in December 2014. In November 2009, Marcus Samuelsson became the first guest chef at a White House state dinner when Comerford temporarily stepped aside to allow him to cook for Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Comerford was retained as Executive Chef by President Donald Trump. =List of Executive Chefs= * René Verdon 1961–1965 * Henry Haller 1966–1987 * Jon Hill 1987–1988 * Hans Raffert 1988–1992 * Pierre Chambrin 1992–1994 * Walter Scheib 1994–2005 * Cristeta Comerford 2005–present Duties and staff The Executive Chef is the manager and executive chef of the three White House kitchens. The Executive Chef also supervises a staff of five, and a part-time staff of 20 to 25 assistant chefs and kitchen helpers. The Executive Chef is responsible for planning and preparing all menus and meals for the First Family and for all entertaining (informal, formal, and state dinners) served by the White House, either away or on-site. The Executive Chef is formally hired by the First Lady, and reports to the White House Chief Usher. The Executive Chef has no purview over any of the desserts or pastries served at the White House. The White House Executive Pastry Chef operates as a separate entity, but coordinates with the Executive Chef for all meals and events. The White House Executive Chef made between $80,000 and $100,000 annually in 2005. The chef receives no overtime, and the workload can vary considerably depending on whether the First Family is in residence or traveling, if there is a special event, or if a holiday occurs. =The kitchen= The White House Executive Chef works in one of two kitchens at the White House: The main kitchen, which is located in the northwest corner of the Ground Floor of the White House, and the Family Kitchen on the Second Floor.; The Executive Pastry Chef works in the Pastry Kitchen on the mezzanine of the sub-basement. The main kitchen was last renovated in 1971. As of 2011, the White House Executive Chef used a natural gas oven and range manufactured by Vulcan Restaurant Equipment; a Traulsen refrigerator and freezer; a Cimbali M32 espresso machine; a Hobart 300 gravity-fed food slicer; Mauviel stainless steel pots and pans; and Misono knives.

Yeardley probably named the plantation after his wife's wealthy father, Anthony Flowerdew, just as he named another plantation \\"Stanley Hundred\\" after his wife's wealthy mother, Martha Stanley. (Yeardley's wife, Temperance Flowerdew, came from English gentry in the County of Norfolk.)Southall, James P.C., \\"Concerning George Yardley and Temperance Flowerdew\\", William and Mary Quarterly, Jul 1947 A \\"hundred\\" was historically a division of a shire or county. With a population of about 30, the plantation was economically successful with thousands of pounds of tobacco produced along with corn, fish and livestock. Sir George paid 120 pounds (possibly a hogshead of tobacco) to build the first windmill in British America. Today, Flowerdew Hundred plantation is a private residence. History The plantation survived the Indian massacre of 1622 with only six deaths, remaining an active and fortified private plantation unlike many others in the area, such as the Citie of Henricus and Martin's Hundred, that were abandoned. The first windmill erected in English North America was built at Flowerdew Hundred by 1621, and was an English post mill. In 1624, Abraham Piersey, Cape Merchant of the Virginia Company, purchased Flowerdew Hundred renaming it Piersey's Hundred. Piersey's Stone House was the first home with a permanent foundation in the colony. The 1624 Muster lists approximately sixty occupants at the settlement, including some of the first Africans in Virginia. Throughout the seventeenth century, Flowerdew Hundred continued to prosper with the establishment of a secondary settlement. In 1683, with the passage of the king's Advancement of Trade Act, Flowerdew Towne was formed down river, but it was not very successful within the James River planter economy. Sometime after 1720, a ferry ran from Flowerdew Hundred across the stretch of the James known as \\"Three Mile Reach\\" to the north bank of the James. An ordinary or tavern was eventually built there for the convenience of the passengers. Part of the old Hundred was acquired by the Joshua Poythress and passed through several of his descendants also named Joshua Poythress. The property was shelled during the 1781 campaign of Gen. Benedict Arnold. He ordered Lt. Col. Simcoe and some Queen's Rangers to spike the guns near Hood's fort on the eastern edge of the property and then continued to the capital of Richmond, setting it afire. The Plantation was re-formed again through the work of John Vaughn Willcox, a Petersburg merchant. He married the last Poythress heiress and bought up the surrounding lands that were part of the original land grant that had been sold off. In 1804 they built a new farmhouse on the high ridge overlooking the fertile bottom lands along the James, but maintained their primary residence in nearby Petersburg. The Civil War came to Flowerdew in June 1864 when the Commanding General of the Armies of the United States Ulysses S. Grant ordered his men to cross the James River in an effort to outflank Gen. Robert E. Lee and capture the City of Petersburg and its rail hub that was vital to the Confederate war effort. In support of the Overland Campaign, the Corps of Engineers, in a remarkable feat of construction, built a pontoon bridge across the James in one evening, setting a record for the longest floating bridge ever built. Grant's Crossing from Weyanoke to Flowerdew (or Wilcox Landing as it was then known) held this record until World War II. The Army of the Potomac with three corps and a supply train crossed the river in about three days heading for City Point to begin the Siege of Petersburg. The site of the pontoon bridge was found again in 1986 by Eugene Prince and Taft Kiser. Using Prince's Principle, a simple 35 mm camera, a cypress tree on the riverbank, and an Alexander Gardner photograph taken in 1864, they were able to place the bridge into the modern landscape. A dead limb on a cypress tree in the Gardner photograph was still present 122 years later and confirmed the location as the site of the crossing. The old Willcox house was torn down in 1955 though a magnolia planted in 1840 still survives in the yard of the large mansion that was built on its former site in the late 20th century. The bald cypress tree that anchored the great pontoon bridge also remains. In 1978, a commemorative windmill of English post design was built on the farm by English Millwright Derrick Ogden. The windmill has since been sold and removed from the property. Over the years the name has been spelled as Fleur de, Flowerdieu, Flower de and Flourdy Hundred. Other names for the property include Piersey or Peircey's Hundred, Selden's (Selden family), Hood's, and Bellevue. It is listed on Virginia's Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail, Civil War Overland Campaign Lee-Grant Trail, and the National Register of Historic Places. Flowerdew Hundred Plantation is currently owned and operated by the Justice family, headed by patriarch Jim Justice, that has extensive farming and milling operations in West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina including 50,000 acres (200 km2) that it farms through its Justice Family Farms group headquartered in Beckley, West Virginia. Archaeology The original land grant of 1,000 acres contains over 60 archaeological sites ranging from archaic Native American encampments to twentieth century homesteads. Registered sites include 44PG64 (Stone House excavation); 44PG65 (Fortified Area); 44PG113 (Selden House sites) and 44PG98 (Flowerdew Towne/Ferry Complex). Archaeological investigations began at Flowerdew in the late 1960s and continued through 1995, when archaeologist James Deetz led the final excavation within the original limits of the fortified area. The excavations yielded more than 500,000 artifacts, all of which are currently housed at the University of Virginia.Layers of the Past: Discoveries at Flowerdew Hundred. https://explore.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/show/layersofthepast/ 2012-2013.

He became a symbol of courage and patriotism in Israel. Biography =Early life= Israeli Military Chief Rabbi Shlomo Goren on left, saluting, at the grave of Uri Ilan (1955) Ilan was born in 1935 in kibbutz Gan Shmuel. His mother was Fayge Ilanit, a member of the First Knesset. He joined the Golani Brigade in 1953. He was the great- grandson of the famed Talmudic scholar Rabbi Shimon Shkop. =Capture and suicide= According to the Israel Defense Forces, he was captured by the Syrians on December 8, 1954, near a Syrian post in the Golan Heights along with four soldiers in his team. The soldiers were taken into custody in Quneitra and sent to a Damascus prison for interrogation. In the Syrian prison, they were sent to separate cells and tortured. Believing his comrades to have been killed, as falsely claimed by his captors in an attempt to weaken morale, Ilan hanged himself on 13 January 1955 in his prison cell, using a rope made from the fabric of the mattress cover. In his clothing, Ilan hid nine notes addressed to his homeland, Israel, and his family. The most famous is a scrap of paper on which he wrote the Hebrew words \\"לא בגדתי. התאבדתי\\" (\\"Lo bagadeti, hitabadeti\\") which means: \\"I did not betray. I committed suicide,\\" that is to say, he chose to end his own life so as not to reveal military secrets under torture. He was buried on 14 January 1955 in Kibbutz Gan Shmuel. =Return to Israel= On 29 March 1956 the four Israeli soldiers who were captured along with Uri Ilan were returned to Israel in exchange for 40 Syrian soldiers. Ilan's suicide and the notes he left behind set off a great outpouring of grief in Israel, but also a sense of national pride.

Santiebeati.it (2002-06-29). Retrieved on 2011-02-02. is the patron saint of Camerino, Italy and Raiano, Italy. Christian tradition holds that he was a 15-year-old who was tortured, and martyred by decapitation at Camerino during the persecutions of Decius. Martyred with him were 10 other Christians, including the priest Porphyrius, Venantius' tutor; and Leontius, bishop of Camerino. Before Venantius was killed, he was scourged, burned with flaming torches, hanged upside-down over a fire, had his teeth knocked out and his jaw broken, thrown to the lions, and tossed over a high cliff. His 11th century Acts state additionally that he managed to briefly escape from Camerino and hide at Raiano, where a church was later dedicated to him. Veneration Venantius was buried outside the city walls of Camerino, where a basilica was built in the fifth century, and later rebuilt many times in succeeding centuries. The cult of Venantius became popular: his image appeared on coins and in litanies; springs near the basilica, which were associated with the saint, were used by lepers and people with peptic ulcers to cure their afflictions. Venantius subsequently replaced Saint Ansovinus as the city's patron saint. In 1259, during the destruction and sacking of Camerino by the troops of Manfred of Sicily, the relics of Venantius were transported to safety to the Castel dell'Ovo at Naples. They were restored to Camerino in 1269 by order of Pope Clement IV, an opponent of Manfred. In the 17th century, Pope Clement X, who was a former bishop of Camerino, further contributed to the spread of his cult: he raised the saint's feast to the level of a double rite and composed hymns for Venantius' office. In the General Roman Calendar of 1670–1969 he has a third-class feast on 18 May. Image:Pfärrenbach Wandmalerei Venantiuslegende 2.jpgVenantius is decapitated and then buried.

He served as an Army First Lieutenant and infantry rifle platoon leader in Iraq from 2003 through 2004. Rieckhoff was released from the Army National Guard in 2007. Founding and purpose IAVA was founded in 2004 by Iraq War veteran Paul Rieckhoff to provide resources to and community for post-9/11 veterans. The organization is headquartered in New York City and maintains a policy office in Washington, DC. IAVA's mission is to unite, empower and connect post-9/11 veterans through education, advocacy, and community. Its programs include non-partisan advocacy on Capitol Hill, data- driven research on post-9/11 veteran issues, veterans transition assistance through its Rapid Response Referral Program (RRRP), and community building through its VetTogether and online community events. In 2012 Stars and Stripes reported that \\"IAVA representatives are frequent cable news guests and regulars at hearings on Capitol Hill, where few if any veterans initiatives are passed without their blessing.\\" The Washington Post has stated that \\"With its ability to talk intimately about both the horror of combat and the difficulty of coming home...[IAVA]...has emerged as a key player on veterans issues on the Hill.\\" In regards to IAVA's CEO Paul Rieckhoff, Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) has been quoted as saying, \\"He's relentless. When [Paul Rieckhoff] brings a new issue to me, I know that's what I should be fighting for.\\" In early 2019, Paul Rieckhoff stepped down as CEO and transitioned to the Board. His COO, Jeremy Butler, a Navy veteran, was elevated to the position. Jeremy continues to press on with an ambitious agenda, in the characteristic style of IAVA. According to IAVA, the organization has over 425,000 members. IAVA membership is free and is available to \\"all veterans, families, and civilian allies.\\" Advocacy IAVA has been involved in, and at times led, the passage of a number of pieces of legislation since its establishment. The organization publishes an annual policy agenda that focuses on recommendations for Congress, the Executive Branch, Private Sector, State Nonprofits and other stakeholders. The IAVA Policy Agenda lists various veterans issues that the organization is engaged in with its \\"Big Six\\" priorities: # Combat Suicide Among Troops and Veterans #Reform the VA for Today's Veterans #Initiate Support for Injuries from Burn Pits #Defend Veteran and Military Education Benefits # Fully Recognize and Improve Services for Women Veterans # Establish Support for Veterans Who Want to Utilize Medical Cannabis  Legislative accomplishments  116th Congress * 9/11 First Responders (2019): IAVA joined again with 9/11 First Responders to pass the Never Forget the Heroes: James Zadroga, Ray Pfeifer, and Luis Alvarez Permanent Authorization of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund Act (S. 546/H.R. 1327). Signed into law on July 29, 2019 (Public Law No: 116-34). * Combating Veteran Suicide (2019): IAVA helped develop and introduce the Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act (S. 785), to expand efforts aimed at ending veteran suicide. * Burn Pits Accountability Act (2019): In 2019, IAVA continued its campaign to raise awareness of military exposure to burn pits and other airborne toxins while deployed with the reintroduction of the Burn Pits Accountability Act (H.R. 5671 / S. 3181). * She Who Borne The Battle: In early 2019, IAVA continued its campaign to better recognize the service of women veterans and fill gaps in care for them at the VA. The centerpiece of the campaign is the Deborah Sampson Act (S. 514), revised from the 11th Congress and re-introduced. IAVA also worked to develop the Honoring All Veterans Act (H.R. 3010) to establish a gender neutral motto for the VA. See a comprehensive listing of IAVA’s supported legislation and legislative victories for the 116th Congress. 115th Congress * She Who Borne The Battle (2017): IAVA launched this campaign to better recognize the service of women veterans and fill gaps in care for them at the VA. The centerpiece of the campaign was the Deborah Sampson Act (S. 681/H.R. 2452). * Burn Pits Accountability Act (2018): IAVA launched a campaign to raise awareness of military exposure to burn pits and other airborne toxins while deployed. The centerpiece of the campaign was the Burn Pits Accountability Act (H.R. 5671 / S. 3181) to improve Department of Defense accountability and VA research. * Defend the GI Bill (2017–18): In 2017, IAVA was successful in advocating for the passage into law of the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act (S. 1598/H.R. 3218) which expanded benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Signed into law on August 16, 2017 (Public Law No: 115-48). IAVA spent much of the year successfully turning back an attempt to pay for the new legislation through the establishment of a $2,400 fee levied on new servicemembers. IAVA launched a campaign to turn back a 2018 decision by the Department of Defense to limit the ability to transfer unused portions of the Post-9/11 GI Bill to family members to those servicemembers with less than 16 years of service. A petition with more than 50,000 signatures was sent to then-Defense Secretary James Mattis. See a comprehensive listing of IAVA’s supported legislation and legislative victories for the 115th Congress. 114th Congress * Defend The GI Bill (2016): In 2016, the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees introduced veterans omnibus bills that include significant cuts to the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Through advocacy on Capitol Hill, in the media, and grassroots efforts by its members, IAVA has been successful in holding off passage of that legislation into law. * Female Veteran Suicide Prevention Act (2016): IAVA successfully advocated for legislation (S. 2487/H.R. 2915) that requires the VA to include metrics on women veterans in evaluation of mental health and suicide prevention programs, among other provisions. The bill was signed into law on June 12, 2016. * James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Reauthorization Act (2015): IAVA joined forces with the Feal Good Foundation and 9/11 first responders and survivors to secure a fully funded 75-year extension of the World Trade Center Health Program Fund and five-year, $4.6 billion Victim Compensation Fund extension, which helps provide care to 9/11 first responders. * Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans (SAV) Act (2015): IAVA developed and led the campaign to pass the Clay Hunt SAV Act and ensured that it was one of the first pieces of legislation passed by the 114th Congress. It was signed into law by the President on February 12, 2015. The SAV Act expands access to mental health care for military and veterans; strengthens oversight of military mental health care programs, among other provisions. 113th Congress * Ending the VA Backlog (2013): IAVA advocated to end the backlog of veterans' disability claims at the VA. With the help of allied organizations, IAVA prompted the VA to implement reforms to its claims processing system. These efforts resulted in the number of veterans waiting over 125 days to receive compensation for service-connected disabilities to decrease by over 60 percent. * Combating Military Sexual Assault (2013): IAVA has been an advocate for reforms to the military justice system that protect victims of military sexual assaults and prevent future assaults. In 2013, IAVA successfully advocated to include thirteen amendments in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2014 (NDAA) that improve victims' rights, strengthen prevention efforts, and protect whistleblowers within the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act of 2014. The organization has continued with this advocacy in the current 114th Congress. 112th Congress * VOW to Hire Heroes Act (2011): IAVA successfully advocated to pass this law, which addresses the career challenges veterans face in transitioning from combat to career. The legislation requires separating service members to take the Transition Assistance Program that provides job search resources like resume and career counseling. This law also establishes tax credits of up to $9,600 for every veteran hired and begins the work of translating military skills and training into their civilian equivalents. 111th Congress * New GI Bill 2.0 (2010): In 2010, IAVA worked to pass the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Improvements Act, also known as the New GI Bill 2.0. The legislation expanded the Post-9/11 GI Bill to include veterans studying at vocational schools, granted National Guardsmen and Reservists responding to national disasters full benefits, and simplified the Yellow Ribbon Program. These new provisions benefitted almost 400,000 veterans in their first year. * Mandatory Mental Health Screening (2009): IAVA successfully advocated to pass this bill which mandates that every returning service member is screened for mental health injuries, helping remove the stigma of seeking help and catching mental health injuries early. 110th Congress * Post-9/11 \\"New\\" GI Bill (2008): IAVA played the lead role in passing the Post-9/11 GI Bill, considered by many to be the most important veterans' benefit for the generation of post-9/11 veterans. This landmark legislation has sent more than one million veterans to college. * Joshua Omvig Suicide Prevention Bill (2007): This legislation has worked to address the veteran and service member suicide epidemic. It helped establish the Veterans' Crisis Line that has served more than half a million veterans in crisis, instituted better suicide prevention training for VA staff, and launched a campaign to reduce the stigma of seeking mental health care.  Research  IAVA regularly publishes data-driven research reports to educate on the issues pertaining to post-9/11 veterans. The purpose of these reports is to drive the development of solutions to benefit veterans and their families. These reports include: * IAVA 2018 Annual Member Survey * IAVA 2015 Annual Member Survey * IAVA 2014 Annual Member Survey * IAVA 2013 Annual Member Survey * Unsung Heroes: Military Families After 10 Years of War * New York's Newest Veterans: Key Findings and Policy Implications of the RAND Corporation's Needs Assessment of New York State Veterans * Red Tape: Veterans Fight New Battles for Care and Benefits * Women Warriors: Supporting She 'Who Has Borne the Battle * Careers After Combat: Employment and Education Challenges for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans * Coming Home: The Housing Crisis and Homelessness Threaten New Veterans * Invisible Wounds: Psychological and Neurological Injuries Confront a New Generation of Veterans  Rapid Response Referral Program (RRRP)  IAVA's Rapid Response Referral Program (RRRP) provides support to service members, veterans, and their families who need resources and assistance. The RRRP program is staffed by a team of transition managers who connect veterans to resources that can support their needs on issues relating health, financial, housing, legal, employment, etc.  VetTogethers  IAVA's VetTogethers are local events that are organized by its members through IAVA's social network website myIAVA. These events are meant to connect veterans to their community and build awareness and friendships.

The first of its kind, it focused exclusively on issues pertaining to defense, foreign policy, and veterans. The Forum was presented by NBC News and MSNBC and was moderated by former TODAY Show co- anchor Matt Lauer from the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York City. The audience were mostly veterans and active duty service members. The forum generated controversy among some supporters of Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson because he was not invited to the event.[25] [26] On September 1, 2016, IAVA invited Gov. Johnson and Dr. Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, to participate in an upcoming Commander-in-Chief forum of veterans issues. The Johnson campaign distanced themselves from any protests and considered the invitation.[27]  References  External links * Official homepage * Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America programming on C-SPAN Category:American military personnel of the Iraq War Category:American military personnel of the War in Afghanistan (2001–present) Category:American veterans' organizations Category:Political advocacy groups in the United States Category:2004 establishments in New York City Category:Organizations established in 2004 ","title":"Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America"},{"id":"9523884","text":"Parque del Carmen (Carmen's Park) is a park in Santa Clara, Cuba, which honors the city's founding.

In front of it, there is a gray marble monument surrounding a Tamarind tree indicating the foundation of Santa Clara. Each pillar supporting the bar represent the 7 families who moved to the site in 1689 from the town of Remedios near the north coast. Next to the Foundation is another monument which honors Captain Roberto Rodriguez, known as “El Vaquerito” (little cowboy), a young soldier who died in the Battle of Santa Clara. When notified of his death, revolutionary leader Che Guevara said: “Today it is like I have lost 300 men”.

He played wing, centre and fullback. Career Terblanche played in 37 tests for South Africa, scoring 19 tries, including a South African test record of four tries (equalled with Chester Williams and Pieter Rossouw) on debut against Ireland at Bloemfontein on 13 June 1998, which he later bettered by scoring a then record five tries against Italy on 19 June 1999. Terblanche started his career under the tutelage of Nick Mallet at the Boland Cavaliers (66 caps). He made his debut in 1999 for the and played for the Ospreys in Wales. Terblanche moved back to the Sharks for the 2007 Currie Cup season in South Africa. He played his return game for the Durban-based franchise at Fullback and scored two tries and claimed man of the match in the Shark's 32–16 defeat over Western Province, the team who has won the Currie Cup title a record 32 times. This was also his 100th match played for the Sharks. He is known as a great finisher—his test try per match ratio of 0.51 is among the highest in Springbok history and is significantly better than those of players like Carel du Plessis (0.33), Breyton Paulse (0.4) and Jean de Villiers (0.4), on par with current stars Jaque Fourie (0.5), Bryan Habana (0.54) and old legend Pieter Rossouw (0.48) but short of Ray Mordt (0.66 or two tries in every three tests), and Danie Gerber's (0.79) incredible scoring records. On 3 October 2007 it was announced that Terblanche had re- signed for the Sharks on a one-year contract. In 2010, Terblanche was appointed captain of the Sharks. In that same year he led them to victory in the Currie Cup final, with the Sharks beating Western Province 30 - 10. On 1 November 2011 he signed a 3-month contract with Ulster rugby to provide cover for Jared Payne, who ruptured his Achilles tendon in the PRO12 match against Treviso on 7 October.

Because providing an opinion of value is the definition of an appraisal in the United States, the practice of the look-up, when excess care is not taken, runs a greater risk of being in violation of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) than an assignment with a more thorough Scope of Work. USPAP scope of work rule Standard practices Due to the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), licensed and certified real estate appraisers in the United States who are involved in a federally related transaction are required to follow federally accepted, uniform standards, known as USPAP, which are promulgated by the Appraisal Standards Board (ASB) of the Appraisal Foundation. In the Appraisal Foundation's \\"Advisory Opinion 19\\" (AO-19) Appraisal Foundation website the Appraisal Foundation makes clear the following: :\\"An appraiser must perform assignments ethically and competently, in accordance with USPAP and any supplemental standards applicable to the assignment. An appraiser must not engage in criminal conduct. An appraiser must perform assignments with impartiality, objectivity, and independence, and without accommodation of personal interests.\\" An appraiser must not accept an assignment that includes the reporting of predetermined opinions and conclusions, and further, the Management section of the Ethics Rule in USPAP states: :\\"It is unethical for an appraiser to accept an assignment, or to have a compensation arrangement for an assignment, that is contingent on any of the following: #The reporting of a predetermined result (e.g., opinion of value); #A direction in assignment results that favors the cause of the client; #The amount of a value opinion; #The attainment of a stipulated result; or #The occurrence of a subsequent event directly related to the appraiser’s opinions and specific to the assignment’s purpose.\\" State laws Because most comp checks are not intended for use in a federally related transaction, the federal laws requiring the uniform standards (USPAP) to be adhered to do not apply. However, the several states and the territories that make up the union have written into their own professional licensing standards for real estate appraisers that, in most cases, a licensed or certified real estate appraiser, when providing a value for real property, is required by statute or regulation to be in compliance with USPAP. In the appraisal of real property and within the context of individual state laws, there are two types of \\"comp checks\\" that can be done ethically and legally. Neither are practical. The first takes place when a mortgage broker calls an appraiser and asks for the range of sale prices in a particular neighborhood, without describing a subject property. In this case, the appraiser can provide a list of sales in the project, with a brief description, and the range of sale prices in the project, without comparison and without discussion of a specific value. In this way the appraiser avoids completing an appraisal on a subject property and provides a consultation service instead. However, the mortgage broker rarely accepts this as helpful and will typically insist on more specific results. Therefore, many appraisers will not provide this service as they feel it can be construed as misleading, the broker only hearing what he wants to hear. Alternatives The alternative and legal \\"comp check\\" is not a comp check at all but an appraisal. If an appraiser believes a value for a particular property can be reliably determined without leaving the office and inspecting the property, and that the necessary approaches to value to determine a reliable opinion can be completed from a desk, an appraiser can accept the \\"comp check\\" as an appraisal request, and provide an opinion of value for a subject property verbally. An engagement letter (i.e., a detailed order identifying the user and the use of a request) for such an assignment is necessary, and a written workfile with a signed certification must be maintained by the appraiser on this report, even if the results are verbally reported. This workfile must contain all data necessary to support the opinion of value provided. Such an appraisal is wrought with liabilities and the competent appraiser will refuse any such assignment unless the house being appraised and its immediate market are very well known by the appraiser. Because any such report would have to be made based on extraordinary assumptions in regards to condition and quality of the house, the appraiser, even when the area and subject property are well known, is wise to make such a report based on the hypothetical condition that an inspection was made, and the report \\"subject to a physical inspection\\" open to change should differences in assumptions be observed. Most of the better appraisers will not complete this type of an assignment, even if they are very familiar with the area, because there is more work to it than meets the eye and brokers expect it free of charge. What most mortgage brokers do not realize, however, is that a comp search appraisal will often not fit their needs, as an appraisal for lending purposes with a different scope of work can reasonably result in a significantly different value, and the direction of the difference is not predictable. For a mortgage broker or loan officer, the best alternative to the \\"comp check\\" is simply asking the owner to be realistic in what they believe their house is worth and work with those numbers. Brokers will collect payment for the appraisal up front plus a reasonable application fee and, if the owner was unrealistic about the value of his/her home and it adversely affects the ability for the owner to obtain financing, neither the broker nor the appraiser can be construed as being at fault. Concerns One of the biggest concerns for appraisers, when it comes to \\"comp checks\\" is that mortgage brokers and loan officers who call with such requests are actually \\"appraiser shopping\\". Many people are of the opinion that appraisers come in two types: aggressive and conservative. This is a misnomer. If there are two types of appraisers in a lending appraisal assignment, they are \\"Honest, Competent Market Value Appraisers\\" and everyone else. A mortgage broker and or lender is advised to shop for a new appraiser when they find they are working with someone other than the honest and competent Market Value Appraiser.

Name The name Ffrith (the Welsh double \\"f\\" is pronounced simply as \\"f\\") reflects a spelling and pronunciation particular to Flintshire: it is derived from a North Welsh word meaning variously a \\"pasture\\", \\"enclosure\\" or \\"forest\\" and borrowed originally from the Middle English word \\"frith\\", meaning a forest or game preserve.Owen, H. W. The place-names of east Flintshire, University of Wales Press, 1994, p.297 The name Belmont or Bell Mount was also commonly used for the village in the 19th century. In local usage the village is usually referred to as \\"the Ffrith\\". Location The village is situated in the southernmost part of the county in the wooded valley of the River Cegidog at the point where the Nant-y-Ffrith stream flows into it. Neighbouring villages include Cymau to the east, Brymbo to the south- east and Llanfynydd, one mile to the north. The nearest major towns are Wrexham to the south-east and Mold towards the north-west. History Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of Roman presence in the area. A Roman villa was built here, a Roman road is thought to have passed through and lead mining may have taken place. Several centuries later, Offa's Dyke was constructed across the area.Ffrith, Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust In 2005 the archaeological television programme Time Team led a dig in the area in conjunction with the Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust. Several excavations were conducted throughout the village. Evidence indicates it was a substantial Roman settlement. In the nineteenth century, the village's size and importance grew as quarrying for limestone and silica and mining for lead and fireclay became more significant. A railway line, the Wrexham and Minera Joint Railway was built through the village and a small station, a number of shops and several pubs opened. Industry in the area declined through the twentieth century, with the last fireclay level closing in the late 1960s. The railway ceased operation in 1952. A large stone viaduct still stands near the village. The village shops and pubs have all closed.Wrexham Evening Leader There is a rare example of a packhorse bridge dating from at least the eighteenth century in the village.

After a sudden and devastating firefight, Cliff is caught and subjected to brutal torture at the hands of the enemy.

Segers is in fact the more common form in contemporary documents, and was used by the painter himself (modern use is about equally divided between the two): Neil MacLaren, The Dutch School, 1600–1800, Volume I, National Gallery Catalogues, p. 418-20, 1991, National Gallery, London, He has been called \\"the most inspired, experimental and original landscapist\\" of his period and an even more innovative printmaker.Slive, 183 Life Mountainous Landscape, c. 1650; oil on panel by Seghers. Bredius Museum, Hague – destroyed by fire in Oct. 2007.The attribution is contested by many. See other references for the fire in Amersfoort. Hercules was born in Haarlem, as the son of a Mennonite cloth merchant, originally from Flanders, who moved to Amsterdam in 1596. There Hercules was apprenticed to the leading Flemish landscapist of the day Gillis van Coninxloo, but his apprenticeship was presumably cut short by Coninxloo's death in 1606. Seghers and his father bought a number of his works at the auction of the studio contents, as Pieter Lastman did. Seghers' father died in 1612, after which he returned to Haarlem, joining the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke. He returned to Amsterdam in 1614 to obtain custody of an illegitimate daughter, and the following year married Anneke van der Brugghen from Antwerp, who was sixteen years older than he was. In 1620 he bought a large house in the Jordaan on the Lindengracht for about 4,000 guilders, but by the late 1620s he was in debt, and in 1631 had to sell it. From his studio at the top of the house, which was pulled down in 1912, he had a view on the recently finished Noorderkerk which is on one of his etchings.Kannegieter, Z.J. (1942) Het huis van Hercules Segers op de Lindengracht te Amsterdam. In: Historische studiën en schetsen, p. 24-25. The actual price of the house is not recorded, and is an estimate by Kannegieter, based on similar sales. In the same year he moved to Utrecht and started to sell art. In 1633 he moved to the Hague. He appears to have died by 1638, when a Cornelia de Witte is mentioned as widow of a \\"Hercules Pieterz.\\". Like much of the detailed documentation of Segher's life, this link depends on the assumed rarity of his first name. Some later sources said that Segers took to drink towards the end of his life and died after falling down the stairs.Hoogsteder & Hoogsteder, Mathieu Dubus, avant- gardist His posthumous reputation was boosted by the Inleyding tot de hooge schoole der schilderkonst (Introduction to the High School of Painting) of Samuel van Hoogstraten which presented him rather as a Romantic genius avant la lettre, lonely, poor and misunderstood, based mostly on his etchings. Prints Landscape with Fir, c. 1620–30; etching on painted paper, in Rijksmuseum He is mainly known for his highly innovative etchings, mostly of landscapes, which were often printed on coloured paper or cloth, and with coloured ink, and hand-coloured and often hand-cropped to different sizes. He also made use of drypoint and a form of aquatint as well as other effects, such as running coarse cloth through the press with the print, for a mottled effect. Altogether only 183 known impressions survive from all his fifty-four plates and most are now in museums; the Rijksmuseum print room has easily the best collection. Rembrandt collected both paintings (he had eight) and prints by Seghers, and acquired one of his original plates, Tobias and the Angel (HB 1),In fact a free copy by Seghers of the Goudt print of Adam Elsheimer's \\"Large Tobias\\" painting, now lost. See Slive, 184 which he reworked into his own Flight into Egypt (B 56), keeping much of the landscape. Rembrandt also reworked the Seghers painting Mountain Landscape, now in the Uffizi, and his landscape style shows some influence from Seghers. Although the dating of his prints remains unclear, his Town with four towers (HB 29) is believed both to be one of the later prints and, by comparison with paintings, to date from around 1631. Given the small number of surviving impressions, it is unlikely that prints were a major source of income for him. His Pile of books (see Rijksmuseum link) is an unusual still-life subject for a 17th-century print. He seems to have invented the \\"sugar-bite\\" aquatint technique, which was rediscovered in England over a century later by Alexander Cozens (it is also called lift-ground etching). Paintings Panoramic Landscape, c. 1625; oil on canvas, mounted on panel Museum Boymans-van Beuningen, only attributed to Seghers since 1951.R van Luttervelt, Dutch Museums, p.202, 1960, Thames & Hudson, London. Hercules Seghers was probably best known to his contemporaries for his paintings of landscapes and still-life subjects such as The River Valley; his paintings are also rare, with perhaps only fifteen surviving (one was destroyed in a fire in October 2007Armando Museum in Ruins After Fire). The Stadholder, Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange bought landscapes in 1632. Many of his painted landscapes are fantastic mountainous compositions, whereas in his prints it is often the technical approach rather than the subject which is extreme. Seghers painted landscapes tend to show a wide horizontal view, with emphasis on earth rather than sky; two in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin had strips of sky added at the top later in the century to meet a changed taste. Apart from Coninxloo, Seghers drew from the Flemish landscape tradition, perhaps especially Joos de Momper and Roelandt Savery, but also the \\"fantastic and visionary aspects of Mannerist\\" landscape painting.Slive, 184–185 The 1680 inventory of the collection of the marine painter Jan van de Cappelle, who owned five paintings by Seghers, describes one as a view of Brussels, which if correct would presumably mean Seghers traveled there, probably when young, when his style shows most Flemish influence (in so far as the chronology of his work is clear).

Early life and education Catharni Stern was born on 22 August 1925. Her governess, Miss Cox conventionally restricted her when Catharni was young. At the age of six, she got a prolonged illness and was confined to bed for half a year, which became the major restriction of her childhood. But she was deprived of creative exploration, such as in modelling with clay found on the beach at Bude during the ritual annual fortnight at the seaside or in carving motor cars out of blocks of salt.John Doubleday. ‘A Personal Introduction to the Exhibition’. Catharni Stern Sculptor. The Minories Catharni was constantly experiencing changing schools in both the public and private systems because her family moving house. She was educated at Chelmsford County High School then studied at the Mid-Essex School of Art, Chelmsford. Then, Catharni took a job on a farm working with sheep. She was eager for fame, excitement and exploration and then she applied to and was accepted by Liverpool University to study for a degree at the School of Veterinary Science. Her agricultural career was put to an end after two years because of a hernia, but she went on to work on a milk round. Then she was enrolled at Chelmsford Art School to do a course in Commercial Art. After one year, she moved to the Regent Street Polytechnic to study Fine Art. She then spent the next two years studying sculpture at Chelmsford. She successfully completed her N.D.D. course with sculpture as her specialist subject and was then accepted by the Royal Academy School where she studied for a further two years. In 1953, she got Feodora Gliechen Award for Sculpture Works Stern worked at Poole Potteries during the 1950s. Catharni Stern studied one year A.T.D. course at London University Institute of Education. Then there came a turning point in Catharni Stern’s career in 1960: She left her teaching job at Bournemouth and applied for and was appointed to a post as part-time Tutor at Bournemouth College of Art. She was then able to devote her energies to the production of sculpture. Shortly thereafter she was offered a full-time post at Saint Martin's School of Art in London but declined, preferring instead to continue part-time teaching there and at Southend School of Art. She has been active in producing sculpture, paintings, and other graphic media. Her style has been modernist, but also realist. She still produces art pieces, mostly for private sale. During the holidays Catharni Stern devoted all her energies to sculpture in an old stable block which she used as a studio. It was tucked away behind Market Hill in her hometown of Maldon, Essex. From 1955 to 1960, she produced a great deal of work and a recollection of her studio. Some of the work showed evidence of stylistic. During those years she gradually became an identifiable voice. With regard to the use of media: Catharni Stern has done rather less carving but she has made more use of clay. Her approach remains consistent because the works are directly modelled in order to enable them to be fired to partially vitrified terracotta or to stoneware temperatures. She has brought a dignify to the medium that for many years has been largely absent. =Exhibitions= Stern had an exhibition at the Ransome Gallery in 1977. And her exhibition with the Alwin Gallery in 1981 was entirely of bronzes. She undertook two major carvings in wood, both Madonnas, one for the Diocese of Truro and the other for Willesden Parish Church. She has exhibited in London, East Anglia and the Netherlands. Her last major exhibition was in 1994, but a retrospective exhibition was conducted at Chelmsford Museum in 2006.Catharni Stern exhibition at Chelmsford Museum accessed 16 February 2007 =Public art= Stern's bronze sculpture St Francis is in Chelmsford, and a terracotta St Francis is in St Giles' Church, Langford;St Giles' Church accessed 16 February 2007 a bronze relief Seven Men in the Waistcoat of Edward Brightimage of Stern's bronze relief accessed 16 February 2007 (the Fat Man of Maldon), is in the Kings Head Centre, Maldon; she designed the logo (based on the Bright's coat motif) for a local walking club, the Maldon and Dengie Hundred Group . The body of small bronzes which she was then accumulating formed the basis of her first and subsequent exhibitions in London at the Whibley Gallery. Her first London one-man show was in 1962 and she exhibited with Whibley at approximately two years internals until the gallery closed in 1975. =Auction= Stern's work is regularly sold at auction. Social Stern has lived in Maldon, Essex since the 1970s. Her interests include walking, cycling, birdwatching, travelling and observing people participating in sports or just looking. Family Catharni Stern’s family has produced many dedicated to the idea of service to the community. Her unusual name came through a mistake in the transcription of a telegram sent by her father, suggesting that she be called Catharine. Catharni Stern’s father was a reserved and even severe man. He transferred his ministry to the Church of England and become Rector of Brampton. Their son Ernest Hamilton Stern was born in 1886, was educated as a Paymaster in the Royal Navy retired with the rank of Captain in 1946. Her mother was born Mary Christie Underwood. Catharni Stern’s relationship with her mother was close and based on an empathy and friendship which overlaid and exceeded the simple mother/child bond. This was in large measure because that her mother was vulnerable to a recurrent manic-depressive illness but they all shared a perceptive interest in the creative arts.

The racing operation is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of the Great Canadian Gaming Corporation which acquired the lease of the city-owned track in 2004. History The track was originally known as Exhibition Park Race Track but has always been referred to by the public and the media as Exhibition Park. July 1, 1939, marked the first time thoroughbred racing used an electric starting gate, the invention of Texan Clay Puett. On the first Monday in August, a public holiday, the track hosts BC Cup Day that features a series of six races for top thoroughbreds in various classes. In September, the two most important races for three-year-olds in British Columbia, the British Columbia Oaks and the British Columbia Derby, are run at Hastings Racecourse. On May 18, 2011 it was reported that the course could close at the end of its 2012 lease due to low profits from wagering revenue and slots as well as difficulty reaching an agreeable new lease with the city. A decision by Great Canadian had to be made by October 31 of that year. The result of those negotiations was that the track remain open and running. In 2012, Hastings Racecourse made international headlines when little-known Mexican- born jockey Mario Gutierrez (who had emigrated to Canada in 2006 and begun riding at Hastings, winning the track's riding titles in 2007 and 2008), won the Santa Anita Derby, the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes aboard I'll Have Another.

The Okanogan Conservation District is bound by the Canada–U.S. border to the north, the crest of the Cascade Mountains to the west, the Columbia River to the south, and Okanogan-Ferry County boundary line to the east. Conservation Districts in Washington are primarily grant funded. Each District must secure funding to implement the conservation program that is established by the Board of Supervisors. History The Okanogan Conservation District was started by a group of farmers and ranchers in 1940. The District at the time was centered upon the small community of Loomis. Over the next 15 years several other small conservation districts were started in Okanogan County and they operated separately for another dozen years. Beginning in 1958, some of these districts began combining to increase efficiency and improve delivery of programs.

Robertson returned a fumble 16 yards for a touchdown against the Minnesota Vikings in a Rams 34- 17 victory. He only started 6 of the 13 games he played in, losing his starting job to Bob Brudzinski. Robertson may be best known for a play in the 1978 season, when, while attempting to tackle then-rookie Houston Oilers running back (and NFL Hall Of Famer) Earl Campbell, Robertson was head-butted in the sternum and run over by Campbell on his way down the field against the Rams. The play is often shown as a part of NFL Films highlights; especially those concerning Campbell. =Buffalo Bills= After the season, the Rams traded Robertson to the Buffalo Bills. After he was traded Robertson signed a 4-year $920,000 contract making him among the highest paid NFL linebackers, averaging $230,000 a season. In 1979, in his first year as a member of the Bills, Isiah brought his 8 years experience and football savvy to the young Bills linebacking corps, which included standout rookie Jim Haslett. He had another outstanding year. Isiah registered 93 tackles, a quarterback sack, recovered 2 fumbles, and had 2 interceptions. In a game against the Cincinnati Bengals, he intercepted a pass and ran 23 yards for a touchdown. It was the last touchdown of his career. In 1980, Robertson had 76 tackles as part of an 11-5 record season for the Bills, in which won the Eastern division. The team then lost 20-14 in the playoffs to the San Diego Chargers. In 1981, Robertson had 48 tackles and 23 assists for a total of 71 tackles. The Buffalo Bills posted a 10-6 record and were a wild card team in the playoffs. They defeated the New York Jets 31-27 in the playoffs and then lost to the Cincinnati Bengals in another playoff game. Robertson would play one more year, 1982, and he started all nine games as recorded 34 tackles. Robertson retired from the NFL on May 2, 1983.Associated Press, \\"Isiah Robertson Retires,\\" [Tucson] Arizona Daily Star, May 3, 1983, pg. E2.

Robertson's limo, which came to a rest perpendicular to the road along which he had been traveling, was then t-boned by a car from behind, pushing him into the opposite lane of traffic, where he was hit by a car traveling in the other direction. Robertson was transported to a nearby hospital, where he subsequently died. Police reports indicate that Robertson had been driving the limousine at an excessive rate of speed when he lost control. Isiah Robertson was 69 years old at the time of his death. The Professional Football Researchers Association named Robertson to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2016 He was voted to the Pro Bowl in 1971 and then in every year from 1973 to 1977, cementing his place as one of the NFL's premiere linebackers of the 1970s.Associated Press, \\"Bills' Robertson Retires,\\" Longview [TX] News-Journal, May 3, 1983, pg. 2-B.

The battle centered on the boomerang-shaped Elsenborn Ridge east of Elsenborn, Belgium. In this region, Elsenborn Ridge marks the westernmost ridge of the Ardennes, rising more than above sea level; unlike the uplands further north, east and south, it has been extensively logged. West of Elsenborn Ridge, where the land descends in gentle hills to the cities of Liège and Spa, was a network of Allied supply bases and a well-developed road network. The Germans planned on using two key routes through the area to seize Antwerp and force a separate peace with the United States and Britain. Capturing Monschau, the nearby village of Höfen, and the twin villages of Rocherath-Krinkelt just east of Elsenborn Ridge, were key to the success of the German plans, and Hitler committed his best armored units to the area. The untested troops of the 99th Infantry Division had been placed in the sector during mid-November because the Allies thought that the area was unlikely to see battle. The division was stretched thin over a front, and all three regiments were in the line with no reserve. In early December, the 2nd Infantry Division was assigned to capture a crossroads named Wahlerscheid, at the southern tip of the Hurtgen Forest. German forces counterattacked in what the Americans initially thought was a localized spoiling action, but was actually a leading element of the Battle of the Bulge. The 2nd Division consolidated its lines, pulling back into Hünningen, then Rocherath-Krinkelt, and finally to the dug-in positions held by the 99th Division at Elsenborn Ridge. In a fierce battle lasting ten days, the American and German lines were often confused. During the first three days, the battle raged in and around Rocherath-Krinkelt. Attacking Elsenborn Ridge itself, the Germans employed effective combined arms tactics and penetrated the American lines several times, but their attacks were not well coordinated and were frustrated by the rugged terrain and the built-up area. To push the Germans back, the U.S. Army called in indirect fire on their own positions, and at one point rushed clerks and headquarters personnel to reinforce their lines. The Americans had positioned considerable artillery behind Elsenborn Ridge and these artillery batteries repeatedly pounded the German advance. The Germans, although possessing superior armor and numbers, were held in check by the Americans' well-prepared and defensive positions, new proximity fuses for artillery shells, and innovative tactics, which included coordinated time on target artillery strikes. The Sixth Panzer Army was unable to take its immediate objectives on the Meuse River. The stubborn American resistance forced Kampfgruppe Peiper to choose an alternative route well south of Monschau and Elsenborn Ridge, resulting in only the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH) achieving a major breakthrough for the Sixth Panzer Army's front, in the Losheim Gap. A series of major battles to contain LSSAH would take place concurrently to the fighting on Elsenborn Ridge. During the battle the Americans lost about 5,000 men killed, and many more wounded; exact German losses are not known, but they included significant amounts of armor. While the Americans had considerable supplies and enough troops to replace their losses, German losses could not be replaced.  Background  Walter Model, Gerd von Rundstedt and Hans Krebs plan for the Ardennes Offensive (Battle of the Bulge) in November 1944. \\"We gamble everything!\\" were the words used by Gerd von Rundstedt, commander-in-chief of the German Western Front, to describe Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein (\\"Watch on the Rhine\\"). Adolf Hitler first officially outlined his surprise counter-offensive to his astonished generals on 16 September 1944. The assault's ambitious goal was to pierce the thinly held lines of the U.S. First Army between Monschau and Wasserbillig with Army Group B (Model) by the end of the first day, get the armor through the Ardennes by the end of the second day, reach the Meuse between Liège and Dinant by the third day, and seize Antwerp and the western bank of the Schelde estuary by the fourth day. The Germans had designated five routes, or rollbahns, through the sector near Elsenborn which would give them direct access to the road network leading to the port of Antwerp; capturing this would split the American and British armies. Hitler believed the attack would inflame rivalries between the Americans and the British, and that the two countries would negotiate a peace as a result. His generals tried to persuade him to set a less ambitious goal, but he was adamant. As they had done in 1914 and 1940, the Germans planned to attack through the Losheim Gap in Belgium. =German unitshttps://www.tracesofwar.com/articles/4447/Battle-for-the- Elsenborn-Ridge.htm= 1 SS-Panzerkorps * 1 SS-Panzerdivision ** 34 Panzer IVs ** 37 Panthers ** 10 Jagdpanzers ** 30 Tiger IIs * 3 Fallschirmjäger Division ** 12 Volksgrenadier-Division *** 6 StuGs ** 12 SS-Panzerdivision \\"Hitlerjugend\\" *** 38 Panthers *** 39 Panzer IVs *** 47 Jagdpanzers ** 277 Volksgrenadier-Division *** 6 Jagdpanzers 2 SS-Panzerkorps * 2 SS- Panzerdivision \\"Das Reich\\" *** 58 Panthers *** 28 Panzer IVs *** 28 StuGs * 9 SS-Panzerdivision \\"Hohenstaufen\\" *** 35 Panthers *** 56 StuGs *** 39 Panzer IVs *** 21 Jagdpanzers * 67. Armeekorps ** 272 Volksgrenadier-Division ** 326 Volksgrenadier-Division German army boundaries and the territorial objectives of the offensive German 6th Army progress during the offensive Adolf Hitler personally selected the best troops available and officers he trusted for the counter-offensive. The lead role was given to Sepp Dietrich's 6th Panzer Army, while 5th Panzer Army was to attack to their south, covering their flank. 6th Panzer Army was given priority for supply and equipment and was assigned the shortest route to the ultimate objective of the offensive, Antwerp. 6th Panzer Army included the elite of the Waffen-SS, and totalled four armored, or panzer, divisions and seven infantry divisions in three corps. 6th Panzer Army's 1,000-plus artillery pieces and 90 Tiger tanks made it the strongest force deployed. Although Dietrich's initial sector frontage was only , his assault concentrated on less than half that ground. Relying on at least a 6:1 troop superiority at the breakthrough points, he expected to overwhelm the Americans and reach the Meuse River by nightfall of the third day. The German assault force also included many volksgrenadier units. These were new units formed in the fall of 1944 by conscripting boys and elderly men, men previously rejected as physically unfit for service, wounded soldiers returning from hospitals, and transfers from the quickly shrinking German navy and air force. They were usually organized around cadres of veterans. Von Rundstedt believed the operation would decide the outcome of the war. A German document captured by 394th Inf. Regt. on 16 December contained his orders:Lone Sentry =German dispositions= The German troops holding the region around Monschau were part of LXVII Armeekorps led by General der Infanterie Otto Hitzfeld. They had been placed under the command of the 6th Panzer Army in preparation for Wacht Am Rhein. LXVII Armeekorps' sector covered about , from a point just south of Vossenack, northeast of Monschau, to a point southeast of Camp d’Elsenborn in the south. LXVII Armeekorps was composed of 326th, 272nd and 246th Volksgrenadier Divisions and 3rd Panzergrenadier Division. The 326th was designated to take the area north and south of Monschau. The 246th and 3rd Panzergrenadier Division were tasked with taking Höfen and Monschau and nearby villages and then driving northwest to seize the Eupen road, which would allow I SS Panzer Corps to attack west over Rollbahn B. To the south of LXVII Armeekorps was I SS Panzer Corps, with 1st SS Panzer Division and 12th SS Panzer Division, 12th Volksgrenadier Division and 277th Volksgrenadier Division, and 3rd Fallschirmjäger Division. 1st SS Panzer Division had been formed from Adolf Hitler's personal bodyguard regiment. It had the primary responsibility for breaking through the Allied lines and reaching the Meuse River and then Antwerp. 12th SS Panzer Division was composed of junior officers and enlisted men who had been drawn from members of the Hitler Youth, while its senior non-commissioned officers and officers were generally veterans of the Eastern Front. I SS Panzer Corps was given the role of breaking through to an east–west road in the northern sector of the Ardennes, code-named Rollbahn B, through Spa. 3rd Fallschirmjäger Division and 12th Volksgrenadier Division were responsible for opening the way to Rollbahn D for SS Standartenführer Joachim Peiper's Kampfgruppe Peiper, the lead element of 1st SS Panzer Division. According to Dietrich's plan, LXVII Armeekorps would secure 6th Panzer Army's northern flank. By sidestepping Monschau to seize the area of poor roads, forested hills, and upland moors of the Hohe Venn, LXVII's divisions would block the main roads leading into the breakthrough area from the north and west. Simultaneously, I SS Panzer Corps to the south would use its three infantry divisions to punch holes in the American line and swing northwest to join the left flank of LXVII Corps. Together, the infantry divisions would form a solid shoulder, behind which the tanks of I and II SS Panzer Corps would advance along 6th Panzer Army's routes leading west and northwest. To maximize the speed of the operation, and to avoid potential bottlenecks and logistical confusion, the two armored divisions of 1st SS Panzer Corps were assigned separate routes west. 12th SS Panzer Division was to utilize three routes (Rollbahn A, B and C) to the north through Elsenborn, Bütgenbach, Malmedy, Spa, and Liège. 1st SS Panzer Division was given two routes in the south (Rollbahn D and E) through Losheim, Lieugneville, Vielsalm, Werbomont, and Huy. The German plan of advance included Rollbahn A passing through a crossroads in the center of Rocherath and Rollbahn B skirting the southern edge of Krinkelt and continuing on toward Wirtzfeld. The Germans' first objective was to break through the defending line of the inexperienced 99th Infantry Division and the positions of the battle-hardened 2nd Infantry Division. Once they broke through the Americans, they needed to seize Elsenborn Ridge so they could control the roads to the south and west and ensure supply to the German troops. The plan also included Operation Stößer, a paratrooper drop behind American lines in the High Fens at the Baraque Michel crossroads north of Malmedy. Its objective was to seize terrain and bridges ahead of the main body after the two corps broke through the American defenses. The drop was set for 03:00 on 17 December and the units dropped were ordered to hold the crossroads for 24 hours until the arrival of 12th SS Panzer Division. Dietrich planned to commit his third corps, II SS Panzer Corps, with 2nd SS and 9th SS Panzer Divisions, in the second wave. Once I SS Panzer had broken the American lines, 2nd SS Panzer Division would exploit the opening. Among the thirty-eight Waffen-SS divisions, these were elite units. = Initial Allied positions = Vehicles of the 99th Division moving through Wirtzfeld en route to Elsenborn. Monschau, on the northernmost sector of the German attack, was an essential objective of their offensive; a key road led northwest to Eupen where V Corps headquarters was located. That same road continued further to Liège where General Courtney Hodges maintained First Army Headquarters. This included several large supply depots in the Namur-Liège areas. On 16 December, the only combat unit guarding the highway to Eupen was 38th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron. Except for their positions around Höfen, 99th Division and its three regiments, 393rd, 394th, and 395th, were positioned within towns and villages to the east and south of Elsenborn Ridge and in the thick coniferous forest around them. The division had not yet fired its weapons in combat. There were insufficient troops to man defensive positions along the entire front, and the Americans could only maintain a series of strong points. Each regiment was responsible for protecting approximately of front, roughly equivalent to one front-line infantry man every . There were undefended gaps in many places along the line which could only be patrolled. There were no units in reserve. Lt. Col. McClernand Butler, commanding officer of the 395th, later wrote: A camouflaged pillbox in the forest served as a regimental command post. With such a long front to watch over, Maj. Gen. Walter E. Lauer found it necessary to place all three regiments of his division in the frontline. 1st and 3rd Battalions of 395th Infantry Regiment in the north, about 600 front-line infantry men, held a position about long and had no units in reserve. The infantry at Höfen occupied a line of foxholes along of the front to the east of the village, backed up by dug-in support positions. 99th Infantry Division used the relatively quiet period to prepare an extensive defensive system, including redundant lines of communication, precise positioning of weapons to provide interlocking grazing fire, and aggressive patrols that kept the Germans off guard. They also carefully integrated artillery support; registered on likely targets based on probable enemy approaches. 393rd Regiment held the center and 394th watched over the south. By mid-December, the troops were well dug in and had wired their positions with barbed wire and trip flares. They covered their fox holes with felled timber. The weather was unusually calm and cold. Between 19 December 1944 and 31 January 1945, the average maximum temperature at the front lines in Europe was 33.5 °F. (0.83 °C.), and the average minimum temperature 22.6 °F. (−5.2 °C.). The American defensive line in the Ardennes had a gap south of Losheimergraben. General Leonard T. Gerow, in command of V Corps, recognized it as a possible avenue of attack by the Germans. This area, which lay between V Corps and Troy H. Middleton's VIII Corps to its south, was undefended; just patrolled by jeep.  Battle of Heartbreak Crossroads  American soldiers of Company G, 38th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division, U.S. First Army, take refuge in doorways during mortar barrage laid down by Germans after the Americans seized a German forest stronghold camouflaged as a two-story residence. The Battle of Heartbreak Crossroads, part of the Battle of Hürtgen Forest, in turn part of the attempt to capture the Roer River dams, was fought at a crossroads near the Siegfried Line that ran along the Hoefen- Alzen and Dreiborn ridges, about north of Krinkelt-Rocherath. In early December, the experienced 2nd Infantry Division was tasked with capturing the crossroads. After attacking for two days without result, on 14 December two squads found a way through the well-emplaced German guns on the south side of the road. They cut the barbed wire and forged a path between the German defenses. They penetrated a trench line behind the pill boxes and held off German patrols for five hours, but when darkness fell they returned to the American lines. On 15 December, an American patrol advanced once more through the breach in the barbed wire and captured a portion of the trench line. They alerted the regimental command post, and Colonel Higgens, commanding officer of 2nd Battalion, led two companies into the trenches behind the pill boxes. By the early morning of 16 December, 9th Infantry Regiment pressed the attack another against stubborn resistance, capturing the crossroads and the road network around it. They had insufficient TNT to destroy the pillboxes.  German attack  : =Initial assault= On the morning of Saturday, 16 December, a snowstorm blanketed the forests and the temperature dropped to . The German attack opened with a massive artillery bombardment along a wide front just before 05:30. American commanders initially believed that the German fire was a retaliatory assault in response to the American advance at the Wahlerscheid crossroads. Large numbers of German infantry followed the barrage and attacked. The northern assault was led by the I SS Panzer Corps. 1st SS Panzer Division was the spearhead of the attack, led by SS Obersturmbannführer Joachim Peiper's kampfgruppe, which consisted of 4,800 men and 600 vehicles, including 35 Panthers, 45 Panzer IVs, 45 Tiger IIs, 149 half-tracks, 18 105mm and 6 150mm artillery pieces, and 30 anti-aircraft weapons. Dietrich's plan was for the 12th Panzer Division to follow 12th Volksgrenadier Division's infantry who were tasked with capturing the villages and towns immediately west of the International Highway along the Lanzerath- Losheimergraben road and to advance northwest towards Losheimergraben. From there they would capture Bucholz Station and then drive through Honsfeld, Büllingen, and a group of villages named Trois-Ponts, to Belgian Route Nationale N-23, and cross the River Meuse. During the actual battle the 1st SS instead bypassed Elsenborn, taking a route further south than planned. The German 277th Volksgrenadier Division, assigned the task of capturing Krinkelt- Rocherath, just southeast of Elsenborn Ridge, was composed for the most part of inexperienced and poorly trained conscripts. Rocherath to the north and Krinkelt to the south share the same main street. The infantry advance was supported by an array of searchlights that lit up the clouds like moonlight allowing the inexperienced German infantry to find their way, but in some locations the German troops, backlit by the searchlights, became easy targets for American forces. These clouds, and the snowstorms over the following days, prevented the superior Allied air forces from attacking German forces. The American troops in the forward positions near the International Highway were quickly overrun and killed, captured, or even ignored by the Germans, intent on keeping to their timetable for a rapid advance. However, during their retreat earlier that autumn they had destroyed the Losheim-Losheimergraben road bridge over the railway. German engineers were slow to repair the bridge on the morning of 16 December, preventing German vehicles from using this route. A railroad overpass they had selected as an alternative route could not bear the weight of the German armor. Peiper received new orders directing him west along the road through Lanzerath to Bucholz Station. Before even reaching Lanzerath, Peiper lost three tanks to German mines and was slowed by mine- clearing operations. German infantry advance through the Ardennes forest. U.S. 3rd Battalion, 395th Infantry Regiment was positioned about to the north of Elsenborn Ridge near the towns of Monschau and Höfen. From 05:25 to 05:30 on 16 December, the battalion's positions \\"in and around Höfen received a heavy barrage of artillery and rockets covering our entire front line.\\" Morning report to the 395th Regiment, 15 December 1944 The enemy artillery, rocket and mortar fire cut all landline communications between the front-line units and headquarters. Only some radio communications between front line and the heavy weapons company remained operational. Twenty minutes after the barrage lifted, German infantry from the 753rd Volksgrenadier Regiment attacked the 395th in the dark in strength at five points. The German attack concentrated in the battalion's center, between I and K Companies. Another German force attempted to penetrate the Monschau area, immediately north of the Battalion's left flank. The 395th was outnumbered five to one and was at times surrounded. It initially pushed the Germans back with machine gun, small arms and mortar fire, and hand-to-hand combat and stopped the German advance. Without radio communication between the front-line artillery liaison officer and 196th Field Artillery, their guns could not be brought to bear on the German assault until communication was restored at 06:50. The artillery had registered the forward positions of the American infantry and shelled the advancing Germans while the American soldiers remained in their covered foxholes. It was the only sector of the American front line attacked during the Battle of the Bulge where the Germans failed to advance. By 07:45, the Germans withdrew, except for a group which had penetrated the Battalion's center and was soon repulsed. At 12:35, the Germans launched their attack again, and were pushed back by artillery and mortar fire. The result of the first day of what would become known as the Battle of the Bulge was 104 Germans dead \\"in an area yards in front of our lines to behind the line, and another 160 wounded counted in front of battalion lines.\\" The 3rd Battalion lost four killed, seven wounded, and four missing. \\"We learned from a German Lieutenant prisoner of war that the enemy's mission was to take Höfen at all costs.\\" General Lauer, commanding officer of the 99th, ordered Col. Robertson at Wahlerscheid to hold his position until at least the next morning when more orders would be forthcoming. Robertson told his men to hold and he also prepared them for an orderly withdrawal in the morning. Early the next morning General Gerow, commander of US V Corps, told Robertson to turn south and withdraw to a crossroads just north of Rocherath- Krinkelt where they were to establish a road block. Robertson's troops were heavily engaged and withdrawal was complicated, but successfully completed. 9th Infantry Regiment pulled back to the Baracken crossroads at the edge of the forest, about to the south of the cross roads at Wahlerscheid. The other units moved south through the area near Rocherath-Krinkelt. Robertson moved his headquarters from Wirtzfeld, south and west of Rocherath-Krinkelt, to Elsenborn, just west of the ridge line. Robertson also informed Gerow that he intended to hold Rocherath-Krinkelt until troops east of the villages had retreated through them to the ridge line, which then would become the next line of defense. This defensive line was intended to safeguard the key high ground on Elsenborn Ridge from the German advance. The area around Elsenborn Ridge became a collection point for ragtag groups of American troops whose units been broken and scattered at the start of the enemy offensive. With so many troops from different units arriving in every kind of condition, organizing a coherent defense was a huge task, but one that occurred with surprising speed under the circumstances. Intelligence about the attack that reached the Americans was spotty and contradictory. To the east of Rocherath and Krinkelt, the Germans had made a deep penetration. Rocherath-Krinkelt had to be held to allow 2nd Infantry Division with its heavy weapons and vehicles to reach positions around Elsenborn. The 99th Division had already put its last reserve into the line. The 2nd Infantry Division, with the attached 395th, was left to defend the endangered sector of the corridor south. =German paratrooper drop= A patrol of Company F, 3rd Battalion, 18th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, searches the woods between Eupen and Butgenbach, Belgium, for German parachutists who were dropped in that area The Germans' Operation Stößer was a plan to drop paratroopers in the American rear in the High Fens area, north of Malmédy, and to seize the key Baraque Michel crossroads leading to Antwerp. The operation, led by Oberst Friedrich August Freiherr von der Heydte, was a complete failure. To conceal the plans from the Allies and preserve secrecy, von der Heydte wasn't allowed to use his own, experienced troops. Most of the replacement paratroops had little training. The Luftwaffe managed to assemble 112 Ju 52 transport planes, but the pilots were inexperienced. They took off on the night of 16–17 December into strong winds, snow, and limited visibility with around 1,300 fallschirmjäger. It was the German paratroopers' only nighttime drop during World War II. The pilots dropped some behind the German front lines, others over Bonn, and only a few hundred behind the American lines, in widely scattered locations. Some aircraft landed with their troops still on board. Only a fraction of the force landed near the intended drop zone. These were buffeted by strong winds that deflected many paratroopers and made for difficult landings. Since many of the German paratroopers were inexperienced, some were crippled on impact and others died where they landed. Some of their bodies were not found until the following spring when the snow melted. The wide scattering of the drops led to considerable confusion among the Americans, as fallschirmjäger were reported all over the Ardennes, and the Allies believed a division-sized jump had taken place. The Americans allocated men to secure the rear instead of facing the main German thrust at the front. By noon on 17 December, von der Heydte's unit had scouted the woods and rounded up a total of around 300 fallschirmjäger. The force was too small to take the crossroads on its own, and had limited ammunition. =17 December= The main drive against Elsenborn Ridge was launched in the forests east of Rocherath-Krinkelt on the early morning of 17 December. This attack was begun by tank and panzergrenadier units of 12th SS Panzer Division. 989th Infantry Regiment of 277th succeeded, after heavy and costly combat in the woods, in overrunning the forward American positions guarding the trails to the villages, capturing a large number of prisoners and leaving many small units isolated. By 11:00, this attack had driven units of 99th Infantry Division back into the area of Rocherath-Krinkelt. These units were joined by forces of 2nd Infantry Division moving into the villages from the north. The German attack swiftly bogged down against the heavy small arms and machine gun fire from the prepared positions of 99th Infantry Division on their flanks. The German infantry struggled to make their way through the dense woods and heavy brush in their path. The German forces also drew a rapid response from American artillery, who had registered the forward positions of their infantry. The artillery fired on the exposed advancing Germans while the American troops remained in their covered foxholes. The troops around the villages were assisted by tanks from 741st Tank Battalion, assisted by a company of 644th Tank Destroyer Battalion equipped with M10 tank destroyers, a company of 612th Tank Destroyer Battalion, and a few towed 3-inch guns from the 801st Tank Destroyer Battalion. They were instrumental in helping hold back the German advance in the fighting in and around Rocherath-Krinkelt. Sgt. Bernard Cook guards a German prisoner walking past a burning Panzerkampfwagen V Panther tank at Krinkelt on 17 December 1944. To the northeast of the 99th Division, the 1st Infantry Division had been recuperating near Liege, from nearly constant combat since it took part in the Normandy landings on 6 June. When the German counterattack broke the division hastily relocated to the unguarded southern end of the 99th's line near Bütgenbach. Troops from the 1st and 9th Infantry Divisions, moved into position to fortify Elsenborn Ridge and complete the defense. The 9th Division held positions on the northern portion of the ridge, in the vicinity of Kalterherberg. Held up by their inability to cross the railroad bridge that German engineers were slow to repair, and by the Intelligence and Reconnaissance platoon of 394th Infantry Regiment at Lanzerath Ridge, elements of 1st SS Panzer Division did not arrive in force at the 99th's positions until the afternoon of 17 December. Finding Rollbahn C blocked, 1st SS Panzer Division initially moved south for Rollbahn D. The Germans changed their mind about routing both units through the southern rollbahns, and on 18 December 12th SS Panzer Division was given the task of opening up the road to Rollbahn C. They made a probing attack that afternoon which failed. In the early morning of 17 December, Kampfgruppe Peiper quickly captured Honsfeld and shortly afterward Büllingen. Peiper's unit seized of fuel for his vehicles; a Tiger II's consumption was about . The Germans paused to refuel before continuing westward. They had been assigned Rollbahn B which would take them through Spa. At 09:30 on 17 December, Peiper sent a section of the Kampfgruppe north to reconnoiter, but they encountered strong resistance, improvised by tank-destroyers of the 644th Tank Destroyer Battalion, and lost two Panzer IVs. Two days into the offensive, the high ground of Elsenborn Ridge and two of the three routes the Germans planned to use remained within the American fortified defense zones. A Tiger II of SS Panzer Abteilung 501 advances west past a column of American prisoners of the 99th Infantry Division captured at Honsfeld and Lanzerath. Believing the way north to Rollbahn B was blocked, and knowing that 12th SS Panzer was well behind him, unable to dislodge the Americans from either Elsenborn Ridge or Domaine Butgenbach, Peiper and the 1st SS Panzer Division were forced to choose the more difficult Rollbahn D to the south. The road was narrow, in many places single-track, at times unpaved. When Peiper reviewed his newly assigned alternative route on a map, he exclaimed that the road was \\"suitable not for tanks but for bicycles!\\" The route forced vehicles to tail each other, creating a column of infantry and armor up to long, and prevented them from concentrating their force. Captured soldiers from the 12th SS Panzer Division \\"Hitler Jugend\\" Orders from Field Marshal Walter Model and Generalfeldmarschall Gerd von Rundstedt that Elsenborn Ridge be captured and the advance of Sixth Panzer Army resume were being sent down the chain of command to 12th SS Panzer Division Headquarters with increasing urgency. General Hermann Priess, commander of the 1st SS Panzer Corps, ordered Obersturmbannführer Hugo Kraas, Commander of the 12th SS Panzer Division, to take command of all forces facing Elsenborn Ridge and capture it. The battle- seasoned veteran American tankers resisted repeated attacks by lead elements of Sixth Panzer Army from 16–19 December. Fighting against the superior German Panther and Tiger tanks, supported by infantry, the battalion fought many small unit engagements. Using their size and mobility to their advantage, their Shermans stalked the German tanks in twos and threes until they could destroy or immobilize them with shots from the flanks or rear. =18 December= The American withdrawal was hastened by an increasing shortage of ammunition. Fortunately for the defense, three tank destroyers of 644th Tank Destroyer Battalion arrived with a good supply of bazookas and anti-tank mines. These reinforcements were put to good use when the 12th SS Panzer Division launched a powerful tank and infantry attack on Rocherath-Krinkelt. The American forces responded with a powerful artillery barrage supported by mortar fire, bazooka rockets, and anti-tank mines that repelled the German attack around midnight of 18 December. The German attack failed to clear a line of advance for the 12th SS.

On 18 December, German infantry and armor resumed their attack on Rocherath-Krinkelt. They were supported by the German 560th Heavy Antitank Battalion equipped with the state-of-the-art Jagdpanther tank destroyer. The Jagdpanther was armed with an 88mm cannon and the German leadership expected it to be a decisive element of the battle. The encounter opened with both sides targeting the village area with repeated artillery strikes, and German armored vehicles advanced into Rocherath-Krinkelt. All that day and night, the battle raged, with SS tank and assault guns hitting the villages from the east, supported by a barrage of nebelwerfer rockets. These forces were met in turn by heavy artillery shells with proximity fuses and about 20 Sherman tanks belonging to 741st Tank Battalion, and several M10 tank destroyers. The narrow streets of the town made effective maneuver difficult. Bazooka rounds fired from rooftops and artillery air bursts caused by proximity fuses created a lethal rain of splinters. Sherman tanks, hiding in alleyways and behind buildings, quickly knocked out six German tanks; eight more were destroyed by 57mm anti-tank guns, anti-tank rockets, bazookas, and mines. Neither side was inclined to take prisoners, and the losses on both sides were heavy.  Corps boundary gap  The small village of Lanzerath was at an intersection southeast of Krinkelt-Rocherath. It was held by a single intelligence and reconnaissance platoon of the 394th Infantry Regiment, which was dug into a ridge near the village of about 15 houses. They were initially supported by Task Force X, made up of 2nd Platoon, Company A, 820th Tank Destroyer Battalion; and 22 men of the 820th's 2nd Recon Platoon, commanded by Lieutenant John Arculeer, who were mounted on an armored half-track and two jeeps. Shortly after the early morning German bombardment ended, Task Force X pulled out without a word and headed south. That left the 18 men of the reconnaissance platoon alone, along with four forward artillery observers, to fill the gap. The American troops were positioned on a slight ridge overlooking the village. During a 20-hour-long battle, the 18-man platoon, led by 20-year-old lieutenant Lyle Bouck Jr., inflicted 93 casualties on the Germans. The American troops seriously disrupted the entire German Sixth Panzer Army's schedule of attack along the northern edge of the offensive. The entire platoon was captured, and only many years later were they recognized with a Presidential Unit Citation. Every member of the platoon was decorated, making it the most highly decorated platoon of World War II. =19 December= At dawn on 19 December, the third day of the offensive, the Germans decided to shift the main axis of the attack south of Elsenborn Ridge. A new armored attack, led by 12th SS Panzer Division and supported by 12th Volksgrenadier Division, was launched against Domäne Bütgenbach, south east of Bütgenbach, in an attempt to expose the right flank of the Americans. 3rd Panzer Grenadier Division, supported by elements of the 12th and 277th Volksgrenadier Divisions to its left and right, made a frontal attack on the Elsenborn Ridge, with the objective of seizing the high feature called Roderhohe. The soft ground in front of the ridge was almost impassible and one Sturmgeschütz assault gun after another got stuck, and the 3rd Panzer Grenadier Division lost 15 tanks that day to American artillery. During 19 December, about 100 Germans seized four buildings in the village of Höfen, opening a wedge in the American lines about by After American rifle and mortar fire failed to dislodge them, 612th Tank Destroyer Battalion brought their 57mm anti-tank guns to bear directly on them. Follow up attacks with white phosphorus grenades finally caused the surviving 25 Germans to surrender, while 75 were found dead within the buildings. The German attack on the American extreme left flank was repulsed by artillery and rifle fire. Despite the fierce onslaught, the battalion did not commit its reserves, which in any case only consisted of one platoon of forty men. Troops cross an open field near Krinkelt The Americans abandoned the rubble of Rocherath-Krinkelt, and General Robertson ordered the remnants of 2nd Division to withdraw to defensive positions dug into the open terrain along the ridge. Troops from the remaining elements of 99th Infantry Division also used this time to withdraw to Elsenborn Ridge and fortify positions on it. They found it required dynamite to blow holes in the frozen ground. Elements of 741st Tank Battalion formed the rearguard to allow an orderly withdrawal from Rocherath-Krinkelt to positions behind Wirtzfeld to the west and northwest. By the afternoon the tankers had reported destroying twenty seven tanks, two Jagdpanzer IVs, two armored cars, and two half-tracks while losing eight of their own tanks. At the battalion level, units reported killing sixteen tanks; regimental 57mm guns claimed nineteen; and bazooka teams claimed to have killed seventeen more. While the numbers were undoubtedly exaggerated, they indicate the ferocity of the fighting. The German tank companies were rendered ineffective and didn't play a significant role in later fighting. At 17:30 that evening, the remaining troops of 393rd and 394th Infantry Regiments withdrew from their positions around the Baracken crossroads, just north of Krinkelt-Rocherath, and retreated along a boggy trail about toward Elsenborn Ridge. American lines collapsed on either side. \\"We were sticking out like a finger there\\", Butler said. Increasingly isolated, the unit was running low on ammunition. A resourceful platoon leader found an abandoned German ammo dump. Butler claimed that \\"We stopped the tail end of that push with guns and ammunition taken off the German dead\\". By the time the fight for the villages ended, five American soldiers had earned the Medal of Honor: Sgt. Lopez, Sgt. Richard Cowan, Pvt. Truman Kimbro, Sgt. Vernon McGarity, and Sgt William Soderman. Another Medal of Honor was posthumously awarded to Henry F. Warner of the 26th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division. =20–22 December= On 20 December, bolstered by reinforcements from the 12th Volksgrenadier Division, the Germans attacked from the south and east. This assault also failed. On 21 December, the Germans tried to bypass Dom Butgenbach to the southwest. A few German armored units penetrated Butgenbach, but the 2nd Battalion, assisted by some reinforcements, stopped them again. Troops of the 26th Infantry Regiment reposition an anti tank cannon near Butgenbach. \\"A\\" Company, 612th Tank Destroyer battalion, carrying troops of the 2nd Infantry Division, 9th Infantry Regiment In an effort to bolster command and control of the northern shoulder, Eisenhower gave Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery, commander of the 21st Army Group, command of all troops north of the German advance on 20 December. This was done in part because Montgomery controlled an uncommitted reserve, the British XXX Corps. This made little difference to the American troops defending Elsenborn Ridge, however. On the same day, Sixth Panzer Army made several all- out attempts to smash the American lines. It committed artillery, tanks, infantry, and self-propelled guns, supported by a Jagdpanther battalion and remnants of the Panzer IV and Jagdpanzer IV units. They unsuccessfully attacked at 09:00, 11:00 and 17:30. They were met by a deluge of American artillery and anti-tank gun fire from units of the American 1st Infantry Division, backed up by strong artillery support. All attacks were repelled with heavy losses. On 21 December, 12th SS Division made an even heavier attack, but 613th Tank Destroyer Battalion. equipped with the new M36 tank destroyer, stopped the attack. On 22 December, the Germans attacked on the right of Elsenborn Ridge for the last time, this was again smothered by heavy American artillery fire from M1 howitzers. The American howitzers fired 10,000 rounds on the 22nd. 26th Infantry Regiment and a company of Sherman tanks from 745th Tank Battalion played key roles. Fortunately for the Americans, on 23 December a cold wind from the northeast brought clear weather and froze the ground, allowing free movement of tracked vehicles and the return of effective air support. The Americans cheered wildly at the return of clear weather and much heavier air support. The air attacks played a significant role in defeating the German attack. Von Rundstedt had sacrificed most of two of the best divisions on the Western Front during his repeated attempts to overrun the Elsenborn Ridge and Monschau. Unable to access the Monschau-Eupen and Malmedy-Verviers roads, he was unable to commit II Panzer Corps, which was still waiting in reserve on the east flank of I SS Panzer Corps. Von Rundstedt's hopes of reaching Liège via Verviers were stopped cold by the stubborn American resistance. =Attack stalls= M5 three-inch gun of the U.S. 7th Armored Division on 23 December 1944 in Vielsalm, Belgium On 26 December, 246th Volksgrenadier Division made a final, forlorn, attack on the Elsenborn Ridge against units of the U.S. 99th Infantry Division. This attack by infantry conscripts was mowed down by artillery fire virtually at the moment of its start. The artillery concentration of an entire American army corps made the Elsenborn Ridge position virtually unassailable. At sunrise on 27 December 1944, Sepp Dietrich and his 6th Panzer Army were in a difficult situation east of Elsenborn Ridge. 12th SS Panzer Division, 3rd Panzergrenadier Division, and its supporting volksgrenadier divisions had beaten themselves into a state of uselessness against the heavily fortified American positions. They could advance no further, and as the Americans counter-attacked, on 16 January 1945, the Sixth Panzer Army was transferred to the Eastern Front. The weather improved in late December and early January, allowing Allied planes to attack the Germans from the air and seriously hinder their movement. The Germans launched an air offensive of their own in the Netherlands, destroying many Allied aircraft but sacrificing even more of their own irreplaceable aircraft and skilled pilots. They also launched a major ground offensive in Alsace on 1 January, but failed to regain the initiative. The end of Battle of the Bulge is officially considered to be 16 January, exactly one month after the Germans launched it, but fighting continued for three more weeks until early February when the front lines were reestablished on the positions held on 16 December.  Impact of the battle  Aiming the 4.2-inch mortar with a direct sight. It was an excellent weapon for close support with a respectable range due to its rifled tube. The organized retreat of 2nd and 99th Divisions to the Elsenborn Ridge line and their subsequent stubborn defense blocked the 6th Panzer Army's access to key roads in northern Belgium that they were relying on to reach Antwerp. It was the only sector of the American front line during the Battle of the Bulge where the Germans failed to advance. Historian John S.D. Eisenhower noted, \\"...the action of the 2nd and 99th divisions on the northern shoulder could be considered the most decisive of the Ardennes campaign.\\" Peiper's forces were plagued by overcrowding, flanking attacks, blown bridges, and lack of fuel, meaning that the Germans were unable to repeat the rapid advances they achieved in 1940 in the same area. The Germans were denied access to three of five planned routes of advance across their northern sector of the battle and were required to significantly alter their plans, considerably slowing their advance in the north. This success allowed the Americans to maintain the freedom to effectively maneuver across the north flank of the Germans' line of advance. Liège, northwest of Spa, was the location of one of the largest American supply centers in Europe and the headquarters of First Army. Only from Spa lay Verviers, an important and densely stocked rail head. Had the Germans been able to capture this area, the outcome of the battle may have been different. General Courtney Hodges, Commanding General of the First U.S. Army, wrote to the commanding general of 2nd Division, \\"What the Second Infantry Division has done in the last four days will live forever in the history of the United States Army.\\" After the war, Hasso von Manteuffel, Commanding General of the Fifth Panzer Army, wrote that the German counteroffensive \\"failed because our right flank near Monschau ran its head against a wall.\\" = Disproportionate German casualties = A dead German soldier lies on a corner in Stavelot, Belgium, on 2 January 1945. The cost of the relentless, close-quarters, intense combat was high for both sides, but the German losses were irreplaceable. An exact casualty accounting for the Elsenborn Ridge battle is not possible. The American 2nd and 99th Infantry Divisions' losses are known, while only the Germans' armored fighting vehicles losses are accounted for. During the battle, small American units, company and less in size, often acting independently, conducted fierce local counterattacks and mounted stubborn defenses, frustrating the Germans' plans for a rapid advance, and badly upsetting their timetable. By 17 December, German military planners knew that their objectives along the Elsenborn Ridge would not be taken when planned. The 99th Division devastated the attacking volksgrenadier formations. The 99th lost about 20% of its effective strength, including 465 killed and 2,524 evacuated due to wounds, injuries, fatigue, or illness. This performance prevented the Sixth Panzer Army from outflanking Elsenborn Ridge, and resulted in many commendations and unit citations for the 99th. = Media attention = Despite the success on Elsenborn Ridge, other units' actions during the Battle of the Bulge received greater attention from the press. This was due in part to Bastogne having been a rest and recreation area for many war correspondents. The rapid advance by the German forces that resulted in the town being surrounded, the spectacular resupply operations via parachute and glider, along with the fast action of General Patton's Third U.S. Army, all captured the public's imagination and were featured in newspaper articles and on radio. But there were no correspondents in the area of Saint-Vith, Elsenborn or Monschau. The public had less interest in the static, stubborn resistance of the troops in the north.  Weapons and tactics  = German combined arms = The force and mobility of the attack depended on the commitment of Germany's latest weapons and armored fighting vehicles. At the beginning of World War II, the German army had led the world in mechanized warfare tactics, overwhelming enemies repeatedly with their rapid Bewegungskrieg or \\"Blitzkrieg\\" tactics of combined warfare. Late in the war, the Germans had developed a number of advanced armored vehicles. The Tiger II, Panther and Jagdpanther were armed with new, high velocity 8.8 cm KwK 43, and the 7.5 cm KwK 42 cannons. Due to the flat trajectory and greater armor penetration of these guns, and the fact that thicker armor was used to shield them, German tanks enjoyed a superiority in firepower over nearly every American vehicle in use. Despite their superiority, the advanced German tanks were few in number and often experienced breakdowns because of unreliable mechanical parts. These units were supported by new volks-werfer brigades: artillery units firing masses of 150 mm and 300 mm rockets. Although lacking in accuracy, a barrage from these units could cover a large area with high explosive. For more infantry firepower, SS Panzergrenadiers were equipped with the new Sturmgewehr 44. This was the world's first mass-produced assault rifle and more advanced than any other military rifle at the time. The new Panzerfaust 100 was an improved short range anti-tank rocket grenade that could penetrate any armor fielded by the American army. German infantry in half-tracked armored personnel carrier German tactics for the offensive involved an initial intense artillery barrage, followed by an immediate infantry attacks by the volksgrenadier divisions supported with light assault guns such as the Sturmgeschütz IV. This initial attack with relatively non- mobile and more expendable troops were used to clear major roads for use by the SS panzer divisions, which would then rapidly move to capture bridges on the Meuse river for the final drive to Antwerp. These armored divisions were employed in a much more organized and controlled fashion, and with better leadership, than was usual for the Americans. The German concept of the armored division was an independent unit that carried with it all its supporting elements, making it more mobile and flexible than an American armored division, and able to concentrate greater force at the point of attack. Shock and high speed were intended to overwhelm resistance, as it did during the first drive from the Ardennes in 1940. These tactics made up what was referred to as blitzkrieg, or lightning war. The German command expected that the allied high command would take weeks to adjust to the impact. But Hitler failed to consider the constricted, winding, often unpaved roads of the northern Ardennes and underrated the capabilities of the American units on the northern shoulder. = American innovations and tactics = M7 Self-propelled 105mm (\\"The Priest\\") near La Gleize, Belgium during the Battle of the Bulge. On the American side, the defense depended on field fortifications, innovative use of light anti-tank weapons such as the bazooka and anti-tank mines, and most importantly the support of a formidable array of indirect fire. American tanks and anti-tank guns were considered ineffective against the newer German fighting vehicles. This was compensated to some extent by use of the 76 mm (76.2 mm) M1A1 gun, designated as the 3-inch cannon, mounted on the Sherman tank and the M18 Hellcat tank destroyer. The British had also designed high velocity anti-armor ammunition for the 57mm anti-tank cannon, which gave this gun a new lease of life against the heavier German tanks. American gunners were quick to trade for whatever their allies wanted for this highly effective ammunition. The Americans also adapted the 90mm anti-aircraft gun as an anti- tank cannon, and mounted it on an open turret of a Sherman tank chassis as the M36 Jackson tank-destroyer. Since the Normandy invasion, the American army had suffered greater than expected losses, and found countering German armored counter-attacks particularly difficult. Learning from this, American tactical doctrine began to include a defense in depth, using mobile armored cavalry squadrons with light tanks and anti-tank guns to screen defensive positions. When attacked, these cavalry units would delay the Germans for a short time, then retreat through defensive positions to their rear. These positions consisted of fortifications set around terrain choke points like villages, passes and bridges; in the area of Elsenborn Ridge, the twin villages of Domäne-Bütgenbach and the area around them proved to be the best areas for defense. Machine gun and infantry positions would be protected by barbed wire and mine fields. Anti-tank mine \\"daisy chains\\" were also used; these were composed of a line of mines lashed in a row which would be dragged across a road with a rope when a column of German tanks approached. This defensive line would be backed by bazooka positions in buildings, dug-in anti-tank guns, and tank destroyers firing from covered positions further to the rear. = Artillery role = M1 (9.5-inch) howitzer, one of the \\"Black Dragons\\", the largest field gun in American service during World War II. As German mobile units backed up against the American defenses, the Americans utilized their superior communications and artillery tactics, such as \\"time on target\\", a sequence of firing so that all shells impacted on the target simultaneously. This allowed large numbers of artillery pieces, distant from the battle, to concentrate unprecedented firepower on attacking German units. Also new to the European battlefield were artillery proximity fuses. These had been developed in 1942 and were first used by ships in anti-aircraft guns. During the Battle of Britain they helped bring down German aircraft and rockets over England. Rather than exploding upon direct impact, the shells detected when they were near a target and detonated before contact, maximizing the effect of the shrapnel. Shells armed with these fuses were very effective, but the Allies limited their use in Europe. The Pentagon feared that a dud would be recovered by the Germans who would reverse engineer it and use the information to design radar countermeasures or employ them against the Allies. Near Monschau, 326th Volksgrenadier Division quickly overran the Americans forward positions. Colonel Oscar A. Axelson, commanding officer of 405th Field Artillery Group, saw a need and ignored orders, and 196th Battalion was one of the first to use the fuses. The American Army was also lavishly supplied with the self- propelled artillery and ammunition it took to make these firepower-based tactics successful. When effectively employed and coordinated, these attacks negated the advantage of superior German armor and armored tactics. The effectiveness of the new fused shells exploding in mid-air stirred some German soldiers to refuse orders to move out of their bunkers during an artillery attack. General George S. Patton said that the introduction of the proximity fuse required a full revision of the tactics of land warfare. The American defense also involved abundant tactical air support, usually by P-47 Thunderbolt fighter bombers. These \\"flying tanks\\" were armed with air to surface rockets which were very effective against the thinly armored upper decks of German armored vehicles. Snowstorms prevented the utilization of these aircraft in the battle until the weather cleared on 23 December.  Legacy  = Medal of Honor recipients = Pfc José M. López, a machine gunner with Company K, 393rd Infantry Battalion, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his courage while conducting a fighting withdrawal with his unit from tree to tree. Sgt Richard Cowan killed about one hundred enemy while covering the retreat of Company I, 393rd Infantry Battalion, and was awarded the Medal of Honor. T/5 Sgt Vernon McGarity was wounded early in the battle, and after receiving first aid, returned to his unit. As squad leader, he directed and encouraged his soldiers throughout the intense fight which ensued. He repeatedly braved heavy fire to rescue wounded men, attack the advancing Germans, and retrieve supplies. Pvt Truman Kimbro led a squad that was assigned to mine a crossroads near Rocherath, Belgium; the road was under direct fire. Kimbro left his men and although wounded, successfully laid mines across the road before he was killed. Sgt William A. Soderman faced German tanks three times on an open road and destroyed the leading tank with a bazooka, stopping or slowing the German advance, allowing his fellow troops to safely withdraw. Cpl Henry F. Warner of the 26th Infantry Regiment was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for single-handedly disabling several German tanks during a running battle near Bütgenbach. =Memorials= Several monuments have been built to commemorate the battle.

His output ran the gamut of the theatrical and operatic repertoire, from musicals, such as Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat, and popular plays, such as Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None, through classics such as Shakespeare and Molière, to Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine's Sunday in the Park with George and Alexander Borodin's Prince Igor. Early life Pimlott's father worked in insurance, but the younger Pimlott was interested in the performing arts from a young age. The first film he saw, The King and I, and first theatre visit, to see Christopher Plummer in Richard III at Stratford, both made a great impression. He was educated at Manchester Grammar School, where he met the younger Nicholas Hytner. They performed together in the school orchestra (Hytner played flute and Pimlott the oboe) and in school plays: Pimlott was an admired Gertrude opposite TV historian Michael Wood's Hamlet. Reading English at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, Pimlott also acted in university productions with Hytner and Declan Donnellan. Opera and theatre work Pimlott began his career with the English National Opera, where he was Staff Director from 1976 to 1978. He moved to Opera North from 1978 to 1980, directing productions of Puccini's La bohème and Tosca, Verdi's Nabucco and Massenet's Werther, and the British première of Alexander Borodin's Prince Igor, which he translated with David Lloyd-Jones. He then worked with Scottish Opera, directing Don Giovanni, and Opera Australia, and then worked in regional opera houses in Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield. While at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, he directed productions of Twelfth Night and The Winter's Tale. In 1988, he directed a production of the York Mystery Plays which was staged in the city's Museum Gardens, against the backdrop of the ruined St Mary's Abbey, and which featured the Indian actor Victor Banerjee as Jesus. Also in 1988, he directed the British première of Botho Strauss's Der Park. Pimlott developed a wide range of theatrical work, which included avant garde, Shakespeare and popular musicals, such as the revival of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat with Jason Donovan and then Phillip Schofield at the Palladium in 1991 and on Broadway in 1993, Doctor Dolittle at the Hammersmith Apollo in 1998, and Bombay Dreams and at the Apollo Victoria in 2002 and in New York in 2004. At the National Theatre, he worked on the British première of Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine's Sunday in the Park with George in 1990, and a new translation of Molière's The Miser in 1991. Pimlott directed many works with the Royal Shakespeare Company, working with RSC artistic director Adrian Noble, beginning with Julius Caesar in 1991, with Robert Stephens as the lead. He later produced Richard III in 1995, with David Troughton as the lead actor; Richard II in 2000 with Samuel West as the title character and David Troughton as Bolingbroke; and Hamlet at Stratford in 2001 with West again as the lead. For the RSC, he also produced T. S. Eliot's Murder in the Cathedral in 1993, Tennessee Williams' Camino Real at Stratford in 1997, with Leslie Phillips, Peter Egan and Susannah York, and staged Antony and Cleopatra at Stratford in 1999, with Alan Bates and Frances de la Tour (although an opening scene that showed oral sex was dropped when the production moved to London). He was Company Director at the RSC in Stratford in 1996 and an Associate Director of the RSC from 1996 to 2002. During his time with the RSC he also had Jason Carr (the composer of incidental music to ten of his RSC plays) commissioned to write a musical adaption of Charles Kingsley's novel The Water Babies; in the end the RSC never produced it but Pimlott later had it mounted at Chichester where he was Artistic Director, alongside Martin Duncan and Ruth Mackenzie, from 2003 to 2005. Pimlott also directed world premières of Phyllis Nagy's Butterfly Kiss, The Strip and Neverland. His restaging of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat was revived in 2007 at London's Adelphi Theatre with Lee Mead in the title role. Before the show opened, booking was so brisk that the musical's originally planned six-month run was doubled. \\"I suppose he’s a dreamer. Even when things are going really badly he never gives up hope\\", Pimlott wrote of Joseph in the 1991 production's programme. \\"We all dream a lot, some are lucky, some are not...\\" Last years A lifelong Gilbert and Sullivan afficiando, he was the director of the short-lived Savoy Theatre Opera project in 2004, founded by Raymond Gubbay. He took to the stage for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in their last season at the Strand, playing Sir Joseph Porter in H.M.S. Pinafore. With Martin Duncan and Ruth Mackenzie, he was appointed as the joint artistic director of the Chichester Festival Theatre between 2003 and 2005, reviving its fortunes. He directed Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None at the Gielgud Theatre in the West End in 2005, with Tara FitzGerald, Gemma Jones and Graham Crowden, and Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin at the Royal Opera House in 2006. He was awarded the OBE in the 2007 New Year Honours list. Although he had been suffering from lung cancer, at the time of his death he was rehearsing a revival of Tennessee Williams' The Rose Tattoo, starring Zoë Wanamaker, which was taken over by his friend Nicholas Hytner. Also in later years, Pimlott's oboe playing became something more than a hobby, and he played in a number of professional concerts. He married German soprano Daniela Bechly in 1991. Steven died at home in February 2007 . Daniela and their two sons and daughter; Oskar, Raphael and Phoebe continue living in their family home in Great Horkesley.

It specialises in providing services to small cap publicly listed companies. Since 1988 it has held annual conferences, noted for their lavish evening entertainments and charitable fund-raising.  History  In 1977 Walter Cruttenden III founded Capital Data Bank, a system that matched private companies with private investors by computer. Under Cruttenden's chairmanship that company grew into Cruttenden & Co. and began offering brokerage services in 1984. Byron Roth joined in 1992 and bought a 15% share of the company. He became president in 1994, upon which the company was renamed Cruttenden Roth. Byron Roth became CEO in 1997 and retained that post when he became chairman on Cruttenden's resignation in November 1998. Initially described as an amicable departure, in July 1999 Roth sued Cruttenden for stealing the company's clients and employees. In February 2000 the firm changed its name to Roth Capital Partners, Inc. Between 2003 and 2010 about 350 Chinese companies gained listings in US stock markets through reverse takeovers and in August 2010, Barron's reported that Roth's promotional materials claimed that it had pioneered the practice of PIPE financing and had helped raise over $2.8 billion for 67 Chinese companies listed on the U.S. markets. By 2012 the company had scaled back its operations in China after investors lost faith in Chinese reverse takeover deals, predominantly due to a series of corporate- accounting scandals. =Conferences= The company has organized annual conferences since 1988. Held in Orange County, California their purpose is to facilitate small public companies make pitches to institutional investors. The conferences feature lavish evening entertainments which have featured exotic sets, scantily clad dancers, and performers such as Snoop Dogg and The Pussycat Dolls, and they have sometimes been criticised for this, being compared to the lavish parties of Drexel Burnham Lambert's of the mid-1980s. In 2006, Byron Roth reported that although an event costs the company around $2.5 million to stage, they usually pay for themselves. The New York Post reported in February 2007 that Roth had hosted clients at an event where the primary feature was \\"several dozen\\" topless Asian models with the ticker symbols of the companies Roth underwrote body-painted on, and in August 2011, Reuters published a similar report about that year's conference. The 2018 conference was attended by 1,000 invited investors and 500 companies, with entertainment from Migos and Pat Benatar. By the end of this conference, it was reported that since 2011, Roth's conferences had raised funding greater than $1 million for the Challenged Athletes Foundation, an organization which helps those with physical challenges gain and maintain access to sports.  Criticism  In 1998 the Los Angeles Times reported that Roth had been criticized for its underwriting practices, citing the company's role in the initial public offering of Aviation Distributors Inc., which later faced multiple shareholder lawsuits alleging the company had manipulated its revenues in order to boost the company's stock price. The company initially went public at $5 per share and later traded as high at $12.88 per share before falling to just 97 cents per share following the announcement of the lawsuits. In 2010 Barron's cited questions that had been raised by investors about Orient Paper, China Natural Gas and China Green Agriculture, firms underwritten by Roth, and which were later investigated for fraud by the SEC. The Washington Post reported in September 2013 that Roth had been involved in the initial public offering of China Electric Motor Company (NASDAQ: CELM) following its reverse takeover in 2010. Roth issued five 'buy' ratings on the stock. However, about a year later, CELM delayed its regulatory filings, trading in the stock was halted and the company's auditor resigned. In October 2011, CELM was delisted and several lawsuits were filed. The company was featured in the 2017 financial documentary The China Hustle for its underwriting relationships with Chinese companies that led to losses for American stockholders.

Understanding the difference between blittable and non-blittable types can aid in using COM Interop or P/Invoke, two techniques for interoperability in .NET applications. Origin A memory copy operation is sometimes referred to as block transfer, shortened to bit blit (and dedicated hardware to make such a transfer is called a blitter). Blittable is a .NET-specific term expressing whether it is legal to copy an object using a block transfer. Interoperability overview Interoperability can be bidirectional sharing of data and methods between unmanaged code and managed .NET code. .NET provides two ways of interoperating between the two: COM Interop and P/Invoke. Though the methodology is different, in both cases marshalling (conversion between representations of data, formats for calling functions and formats for returning values) must take place. COM Interop deals with this conversion between managed code and COM objects, whereas P/Invoke handles interactions between managed code and Win32 code. The concept of blittable and non- blittable data types applies to both—specifically to the problem of converting data between managed and unmanaged memory. This marshalling is performed by the interop marshaller, which is invoked automatically by the CLR when needed. Blittable types defined A blittable type is a data type that does not require special attention from the interop marshaler because by default it has a common representation in managed and unmanaged memory. By pinning the data in memory, the garbage collector will be prevented from moving it, allowing it to be shared in-place with the unmanaged application. This means that both managed and unmanaged code will alter the memory locations of these types in a consistent manner, and much less effort is required by the marshaler to maintain data integrity. The following are some examples of blittable types available in the .NET framework: *\`System.Byte\` *\`System.SByte\` *\`System.Int16\` *\`System.UInt16\` *\`System.Int32\` *\`System.UInt32\` *\`System.Int64\` *\`System.UInt64\` *\`System.IntPtr\` *\`System.UIntPtr\` *\`System.Single\` *\`System.Double\` Additionally, one-dimensional arrays of these types (including unsafe fixed buffers) as well as complex types containing only instance fields (which includes readonly fields) of these types are blittable. The presence of static or const fields that are non- blittable does not cause the type to become non-blittable, because such fields play no part in marshalling. Complex types (that is structs or classes) must also have instance field layout of Sequential applied using the [StructLayout] attribute in order to be considered blittable by the .NET marshaler. Structs have this attribute applied automatically by the compiler, but it must explicitly be added to a class definition to make an otherwise non-blittable class blittable. If a type is not one of the blittable types, then it is classified as non-blittable. The reason a type is considered non-blittable is that for one representation in managed memory, it may have several potential representations in unmanaged memory or vice versa. Alternatively, there may be exactly one representation for the type in both managed and unmanaged memory. It is also often the case that there simply is no representation on one side or the other. The following are some commonly used non-blittable types in the .NET framework: *\`System.Boolean\` *\`System.Char\` *\`System.Object\` *\`System.String\` There are many more blittable and non-blittable types, and user-defined types may fit in either category depending on how they are defined (MSDN). Usage This very restrictive notion of blittable types appears to limit the usefulness of the interoperability services provided by .NET, but this is not so. While blittable types allow a straightforward definition of interoperable types, various ways exist to explicitly define how a non-blittable type should be converted by the interop marshaler. For example, in the .NET languages there are many attributes which can be applied to fields in types, to types themselves and to method parameters to indicate to the marshaler how to handle those particular data. These attributes have various purposes, such as detailing the packing or alignment of a type, specifying offsets of fields in a type, specifying array or string representations, controlling parameter-passing style for function calls, specifying memory management techniques, and more. If none of the attributes or other tools that are provided in the framework are adequate, fine-grained control is provided by the ability to implement the \`ICustomMarshaler\` interface and manually perform the conversion of data in both directions. Understanding what constitutes a blittable type allows a developer to identify situations where intervention is and is not required for a type to be correctly marshaled. In this way, less time is wasted on over-specification of types or function calls.

Francis James Child collected two variants in The English and Scottish Popular Ballads. It is based on the parable of the rich man and Lazarus (also called \\"Dives and Lazarus\\" and found in ), but the story contains some miraculous elements, and has its emphasis slightly changed from the more traditionally Jewish to a more popularly Western Christian view of the afterlife. As in other popular renderings of the parable, Dives (Latin for rich or splendid) was considered as a proper name, and the name even was changed to Diverus in variant B. Synopsis The rich man Dives or Diverus makes a feast. The poor man Lazarus comes to Dives' door and repeatedly begs 'brother Dives' to give him something to eat and drink. Dives answers that he is not the brother of Lazarus, denies Lazarus food and drink, and sends his servants to whip him and his dogs to bite him. However, the servants are unable to whip Lazarus, and the dogs \\"lick his sores away\\" instead of biting him. As both men die, angels carry Lazarus to heaven, and serpents drag Dives to hell. In one version Dives asks Lazarus (who is apparently unable to help him) for a drop of water, and complains about his eternal punishment. : As it fell out upon a day, Rich Dives he made a feast, And he invited all his friends, And gentry of the best. : ...Then Lazarus laid him down and down, And down at Dives' door : ' Some meat, come drink, brother Dives, Bestow upon the poor.

Benzotrichloride is an unstable, colorless (to yellowish), viscous, chlorinated hydrocarbon with a penetrating odor. Benzotrichloride is used extensively as a chemical intermediate for products of various classes, i.e. dyes and antimicrobial agents.  History  Benzotrichloride is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and hence its use is subject to a list of reporting requirements by companies or institutions which synthesize, store or use it in large quantities. In 2018, EU member states have approved a European Commission proposal to restrict the use of carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic (CMR) substances in clothing, textiles and footwear. In 2015, the Commission published a preliminary list of 286 CMRs it proposed to restrict. Benzotrichloride was listed in this document as a toxic and carcinogenic compound. According to the harmonised classification and labelling (CLP00) approved by the European Union (EU), this substance is toxic if inhaled, causes serious eye damage, may cause cancer, causes skin irritation, is harmful if swallowed, and may cause respiratory irritation. According to Web of Science this compound and manufacturing processes related to it have been thoroughly discussed in scientific literature since 1954.  Structure and reactivity  Benzotrichloride hydrolyzes rapidly in the presence of water into benzoic acid and hydrochloric acid with a half life of about 2.4 minutes, thus making the compound unstable in the presence of water. In other chemical reactions, BTC reacts at the chlorinated α-carbon, for example in substitution reactions. BTC is a poorly water-soluble, clear to yellowish liquid with a penetrating odor. The synthesis of BTC is performed by free radical chlorination of toluene. BTC is used as an intermediate in the synthesis of benzoyl chloride, benzotrifluoride and 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone which in turn are also intermediates in other reactions. Those compounds are further used to synthesize chemicals needed in the pharmaceutical industry (benzoyl peroxide), the synthesis of pesticides, dyes and UV-absorbing compounds which are often used in paint and plastics to prevent degradation by sunlight. Some examples of unrelated reactions with benzotrichloride are: Benzotrichloride can react with resorcinol to for 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone, which is used in sunscreen as a UV-absorber :C6H5CCl3 \\\\+ resorcinol → 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone: It can also be partially hydrolysed to benzoyl chloride: : C6H5CCl3 \\\\+ H2O → C6H5C(O)Cl + 2 HCl Transformation into benzotrifluoride, a precursor to pesticides is also possible: : C6H5CCl3 \\\\+ 3 KF → C6H5CF3 \\\\+ 3 KCl : Preparation Benzotrichloride is produced by the free radical chlorination of toluene, catalysed by light or radical initiators such as dibenzoyl peroxide. Two intermediates are observed: : C6H5CH3 \\\\+ Cl2 → C6H5CH2Cl + HCl : C6H5CH2Cl + Cl2 → C6H5CHCl2 \\\\+ HCl : C6H5CHCl2 \\\\+ Cl2 → C6H5CCl3 \\\\+ HCl After synthesis the product is checked on purity and the benzal chloride is discarded.  Metabolism  In a rat experiment with radiolabeled [14C]-benzotrichloride a single 40 mg/kg body weight dose was administered. The absorption half-life of BTC from the gastrointestinal tract was determined to be 3 hours. The concentration in the blood peaked at 4 h reaching 6.5 ppm, this decreased to 2.6 ppm after 24 h. The elimination of half-life in blood was 22 h. Elimination took place for 90% through urine and 10% through faeces. After 72 hours 1.5% of the dose was still present in tissue. The highest concentration levels were present in liver, kidney and fat. BTC is rapidly metabolised via hydrolysis to benzoic acid and hydrochloric acid. This benzoic acid is first metabolized into benzoyl-CoA, which is metabolized into hippuric acid by replacing CoA with glycine. This hippuric acid is then excreted. 90% of the BTC was recovered from the rat urine as hippuric acid while small amounts of benzoic acid (0.7%) and phenyl acetic acid (0.8%) were also present. Four unidentified metabolites (5.5%) were also present in urine.  Toxicity  = Signs of toxicity = Several symptoms are related to the tested exposure to benzotrichloride (BTC) in rats: irritation of the eyes, the skin and the respiratory tract. Under occlusive conditions, rabbit skin which was exposed to BTC showed irritation. Next, severe eye irritation was reported in rabbits, after administering 0.1 mL of BTC. This eye irritation lasted up to 7 days. Finally, several rat studies into the acute toxic effects indicate that the respiratory system will be irritated after inhalation or oral uptake of BTC. The effects of repeated inhalation, estimated with experiments on rats, include the following. BTC can lead to bronchitis and bronchopneumonia, depressed weight gain and gasping. Microscopically, inflammation and squamous metaplasia of the cells lining the nasal, tracheal, bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium can occur in rats. Histopathologically, an increased incidence of portal inflammatory cells infiltrate the liver and also bile duct proliferation is likely to occur. The toxicity of BTC in mammals was assessed by Chu I. et al. (1984) by tracking several characteristics in rats for 28 days after oral intake of BTC. Growth rate and food consumption were not found to be affected by treatment. No deaths occurred during these trials. = Animal toxicity =  Acute toxicity  = Inhalation = Inhaling 1147 mg/m3 of benzotrichloride (BTC) for 3 hours resulted in 1 out of 6 male rats dying (after 3 days). On the other hand, inhaling 995 mg/m3 of BTC for 3 hours resulted in 4 out of 6 female rats dying within 13 days. However, reducing the duration of exposure to only one hour with a concentration just above 800 mg/m3 resulted in no male or female rats dying. The treated rats had irritated oral and ocular mucous membranes, while behaviour and breathing were altered for up to 13 days. = Dermal = Out of 10 female rats 1 died after being exposed to 5000 mg/kg body weight of BTC. This indicates that the median lethal dosage, the LD50 value, is higher than 5000 mg/kg body weight. The rats showed sedation starting from day 1 until day 8-10. = Oral = Studying 15 male and 15 female rats per dose group, after being given an oral dosage, an LD50 of 2188 mg/kg bodyweight and an LD50 of 1590 mg/kg bodyweight were found for males and females, respectively. Laboured breathing, polyuria, sanguineous urine, and reduced activity were observed, lasting from 15 minutes after ingestion until 7–9 days. The deceased rats had empty intestinal tracts and white-stippled stomachs. Moreover, pure compound administration resulted in a male LD50 of 1249 mg/kg body weight. Symptoms in these male rats included: bloody eyes, ataxia, cramps, diuresis, weight loss. Another study found an LD50 of 770 mg/kg (male) and 702 mg/kg (female) after administering these rats with benzoyl chloride in corn oil. Besides the same symptoms described earlier, upon necropsy lung congestion, thymus with red foci and yellow stained urogenital region and fluid filled intestines were found. = Repeated dose toxicity =  Inhalation  The toxic effects of repeated benzotrichloride exposure have been assessed for inhalation, dermal exposure and oral ingestion. After repeated exposure to a concentration of 12.8 mg/m3 twice weekly for 30 minutes, over 12 months in mice, severe bronchitis and bronchial pneumonia were observed. After exposure of 5.1 mg/m3 for 6 hours a day, 5 days a week for 4 weeks, no adverse effects were observed in rats. Note that the exposure times resemble a 5-day work week (although with only 30 hours).  Dermal  After dermal administration in rabbits between 50–200 mg/kg bodyweight per day (5 days a week, 3 weeks) skin irritation up to necrosis was observed, suggesting that it is a dermal irritant.  Oral  After feeding rats 0.048–53 mg/kg body weight for 28 days, only mild microscopical liver kidney and thyroid structure change was observed, even at the lowest dose. The data presented in this study suggest that BTC possess a low order of oral toxicity in the rat. = Mutagenicity and carcinogenicity =  Inhalation  Genotoxic potential was shown in bacteria and mammalian cell system, micronucleus formation occurred in bone marrow cells. Actual cancer incidence increase was clearly observed too: The same study finding bronchitis after long term respiratory use, found that 81% of mice had lung adenomas(8% in control), 27% skin adenomas (0% in control), 11% malignant lymphomas (0% in control). Similar studies also showed significant carcinogenicity. This shows that even though long-term inhalation damages the lungs, it also increases cancer risk, which is a risk needing stricter regulation.  Dermal  Dermal and oral studies all showed significant lung cancer increase, together with either significant skin cancer and stomach cancer increase respectively. Research, after suspicion of carcinogenicity in benzoyl-chloride producing factories, on ICR mice also showed significant incidence of tumors: skin-cancer(68%) and pulmonary tumors(58%) after applying 2.3 microliter/animal twice weekly for 50 weeks.  Oral  In humans only a few cases of lung cancer are linked to either benzoyl chloride or benzotrichloride, although smoking also might have played a role. Both NCI thesaurus and NPT carcinogen reports classify BTC as “reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen”, based on limited evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans and sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in experimental animals.  Aquatic effects  Daphnia magna (a planktonic crustacean) were tested, 24 h-EC50 of 50 mg/L was found. The toxic effects were attributed to HCl formation, as benzotrichloride dissociates rapidly into the far less toxic benzoic acid and HCl on water exposure. Compensating the pH decrease in water from the HCl negated toxic effects, suggesting that water acidification is the reason for the low aquatic life toxicity. Benzoic acid has an EC50 of >100 mg/L towards aquatic life, is readily biodegradable and does not accumulate, so is not regarded as toxic towards aquatic life. = Fertility = No extensive studies were done on fertility effects. As the carcinogenic potential on its own already warrants extensive restrictions, no additional restrictions are needed for effect on fertility, although the genotoxic properties suggest that fertility might be affected.  Mechanism of toxicity  Part of the toxicity of benzotrichloride can be explained by its hydrolysis to benzoic acid, whose further metabolism can cause toxic effects. Benzoyl-CoA formation can deplete acetyl-CoA levels, hampering processes requiring acetyl-CoA, like gluconeogenesis via pyruvate carboxylase. Hepatic ATP levels are also lowered by 70-80%, at doses of 720–1440 mg/kg benzoic acid via intraperitoneal injection, by reducing acetyl-CoA availability for ATP production, which can have a wide range of consequences for affected cells. Ammonia toxicity can be amplified by benzoic acid, as it inhibits ureagenesis, reducing ammonia detoxification. Furthermore, benzoic acid can displace bilirubin from the albumins, posing a risk of bilirubin toxicity, as it diffuses into tissues. Benzoic acid was shown to be genotoxic in vitro. Benzoic acid therefore might have a role in BTC carcinogenicity, but BTC has more carcinogenic potential than benzoic acid, suggesting that an intermediate in hydrolysis is responsible for at least part of the carcinogenicity. Research showed that the mutagenicity was not caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase, but it did not elucidate what metabolite was the main carcinogen. As the hydrolysis product HCl is a strong acid, reported severe eye and lung irritation are not surprising after BTC administration.

He played hurling with his local club Geraldine O’Hanrahans and with the Wexford senior inter-county team from 1957 until 1968. Playing career =Club= O’Brien played his club hurling with his local club Geraldine O’Hanrahans in New Ross. He enjoyed some success with the club, culminating in the winning of a senior county title with the club in 1966. =Inter-county= O’Brien first came to prominence on the inter-county scene with the Wexford senior team in 1957. He made his debut in a National Hurling League game against Dublin in January of that year. At the time Wexford were regarded as one of the best teams in the country, however, their form had dipped in recent years. In 1958 Wexford made it to the final of the National League. Limerick were the opponents on that occasion and O’Brien made a cameo appearance as a substitute. Wexford won a thrilling contest by 5-7 to 4-8 giving O’Brien his first major title. Two years later in 1960 O’Brien was the regular left corner-forward on the team. That year Wexford reached the Leinster final where Kilkenny provided the opposition. After an exciting game Wexford emerged victorious by 3-10 to 2-11 giving O’Brien his first Leinster title. This victory allowed Wexford to advance directly to the All-Ireland final where Tipperary were the opponents. O’Brien’s side got off to a good start with a quick goal by Mick Hassett. A second goal was scored by Oliver ‘Hopper’ McGrath just after the interval to put Wexford in the driving seat. With a minute to go the crowd invaded the pitch thinking that the game was over. When the disorder was cleared Tipp continued but only had twelve players on the field. Bill Moloughney scored a later point for Tipp; however, this was not entered into the official records. It was too later in any case as Wexford won by 2-15 to 0-11 giving O’Brien his first All-Ireland medal. Wexford lost their provincial crown in 1961, however, O’Brien captured a second Leinster medal in 1962 as Kilkenny fell by 3-9 to 2-10. Another All-Ireland final meeting with Tipperary beckoned for Wexford and O’Brien. The Leinster men got off to a bad start as Tom Moloughney and Seán Moloughney scored two goals for Tipp inside the first minute. Wexford fought back and the game remained level for most of the rest of the match. O’Brien himself scored a remarkable goal from all of seventy yards out. It was not enough for Wexford as Tipperary won the game by 3-10 to 2-11. Wexford were outclassed in Leinster for the next two years, however, 1965 saw O’Brien add a third provincial medal to his collection as arch-rivals Kilkenny fell once again. Yet again Wexford faced Tipperary in the All-Ireland final. Of all their meetings in recent years this proved to be the most one-sided. Tipp won easily with two unorthodox hand- passed goals by Seán McLoughlin. Tipp also scored seven unanswered points in the last quarter to win the game by 2-16 to 0-10. In 1967 O’Brien was captain of the Wexford team as he captured a second National League medal. The following year he won his fourth and final Leinster title. Kilkenny, who were the reigning All-Ireland champions, were accounted for in the provincial decider on a score line of 3-13 to 4-9. For the fourth time of the decade Wexford subsequently faced Tipperary in the All-Ireland final with the Munster men leading by two victories to one. At half-time it looked as if Tipp were cruising to another victory as they took an eight-point lead. Just after the restart Wexford had a Christy Jacob goal disallowed before Tony Doran scored a goal after just six minutes. Tipp fought back; however, it was too late as Wexford won by 5-8 to 3-12. It was O’Brien’s second All-Ireland medal. It also turned out to be his last game for Wexford as the knee trouble that had caused him trouble throughout recent seasons finally meant an end to his inter-county career. =Provincial= O’Brien also lined out with Leinster in the inter- provincial hurling competition. He won his sole Railway Cup medal in 1965 as Leinster defeated Munster.

Early life  Agras was born in Gargalianoi (now in Trifylia municipality), Messenia in 1880, from an important family of that region, members of which had participated in the Greek War of Independence. He entered the Hellenic Military Academy, from where he graduated as lieutenant of the Hellenic Army in 1901. The increasing presence of Bulgarian Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization guerrilla troops in Ottoman-held Macedonia and their actions against the followers of the Patriarchate of Constantinople and generally against the Macedonian Greek population concerned Greek public opinion in Athens, which led to the creation of some underground organizations financed by wealthy Greeks, initially without official support, with the intention of establishing Greek military bands in Macedonia to confront the threat. Agras entered one of these organizations, the Macedonian Committee in 1904, after the death of Pavlos Melas.  Involvement in the Macedonian Struggle  Tellos Agras in the middle, together with two other leaders of the Macedonian Struggle, Nikiforos (Ioannis Demestichas) to his left and Kalas (Constantine Sorros). In September 1906, he entered Macedonia leading a 14 men band with the mission to protect Macedonian Greek villages in Giannitsa Lake (called O Valtos, i.e., \\"the Swamp\\" by locals) from the attacks of VMRO members that controlled the northern part of the lake. With the help of local Macedonian Greeks such as the wealthy tradesman Zafeiris Loggos and Antonis Mingas from Naoussa, in only three months he managed to limit Bulgarian presence in the Swamp. But on November 14, 1906 Agras was seriously injured after an unsuccessful attack against the leader of the Bulgarian guerrilla troops, Apostol Petkov, near the village of Zervochori and was recalled to Thessaloniki to be healed. He continued his activity in the area for some months but his health deteriorated by his continuous presence and fights in the lake, resulting in his infection by malaria. The coordinator of the Greek forces, Konstantinos Mazarakis- Ainian, concerned for his life, ordered Agras to withdraw to Naoussa in April 1907, where he started recruiting locals to man the band of his substitute Captain Amyntas, alias Lieutenant Doumpiotis. However, by that time, Ottoman forces, although initially passive and not intervening in Greek-Bulgarian fights, began attacking both, worried by the presence of so many armed bands in the area. That led Agras to seek cooperation with the leaders of the Bulgarian forces of the area against the Turks and a meeting was arranged on June 3, 1907 between Agras and his opponent, Captain Zlatan, near the town of Aghia Foteini, 10 km north of Naoussa. According to their agreement each group would be unarmed. In the event, the Bulgarians came armed and Agras, with his close friend Mingas were arrested by Zlatan and later hanged on June 7 outside the village of Tekhovo. The news of his death shocked the local Greek population and his fellow fighters who continued his work and eventually managed to predominate in the area of Giannitsa Lake, after the decisive victory of Captain Amyntas against Zlatan on June 30 in Xeroleivado. Tellos Agras is considered to be a martyr of the Greek Struggle of Macedonia and one of the most important and effective band leaders of it. He and his exploits are better known through the pages of the novel Ta Mystika tou Valtou (\\"The Secrets of the Marsh\\"), written by Penelope Delta. References *Dakin Douglas.

They are also available for self-guided tours of outdoor locations,As employed in the gardens of Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, England or as a part of an organised tour. It provides background, context, and information on the things being viewed.Fisher (2004), p. 49. Audio guides are often in multilingual versions and can be made available in different ways. Some of the more elaborate tours may include original music and interviews.Walkin' Broadway from CityListen Audio Tours includes several original interviews with notable Broadway artists and producers Traditionally rented on the spot, more recently downloaded from the Internet or available via the mobile phone network. Some audio guides are free or included in the entrance fee, others have to be purchased separately. History Willem Sandberg, director of the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam from 1945 to 1962, pioneered the world's first museum audio tours. When invented in 1952, the developers were drawn by its unique potential to mediate an experience individually controllable by each visitor, which was content-rich, was personal to them, was available at any time, and suited learning styles not served by catalog, text panel, or label. Sandberg's ambulatory lectures were delivered through a closed-circuit shortwave radio broadcasting system in which the amplified audio output of an analog playback tape recorder served as a broadcast station, and transmission was via a loop aerial fixed around the gallery or galleries. Identical lectures in Dutch, French, English, and German were recorded onto magnetic tapes, broadcast in turn through the aerial, and picked up by visitors through a portable radio receiver with headphones, when inside the loop. The system was such that all visitors with a receiver could only hear a specific piece of commentary at any time; hence, groups of visitors would move through the galleries and look at exhibits as if guided by an invisible force, in complete synchronicity. Electronic multimedia guides Audio guide set for Louvre tour supporting Korean language. A multimedia electronic guide is a device specially designed to provide audio, visual or textual content to museum visitors with or without user interaction. It may also provide alternative content corresponding to different personal preferences. It may include accessories such as headphones, a digital pen and displays with LEDs or LCD screens. These smart guides may be operated to supply content in different languages and accents, with different voice alternatives, with text, and with age group specific content. They can be operated in several ways: * Touch/push-button systems are operated by the visitor. The visitor enters the code assigned to the object or location to the electronic museum guide and the related content is provided.The Learning Experience With Electronic Museum Guides. * Location aware systems operate semi-automatically. They sense the location by several alternative technologies and provide the related content. If the sensing area is not narrow enough to detect every different object then the visitor will enter or select the content he or she wants. Location aware systems provides better quality tours to disabled people.Accessible Design of a Portable Electronic Museum Guide for Universal Access , University of Cambridge, UK. * Line of Sight Aware Systems operate automatically. They sense the location and the target object and provides the related content. These systems may include software that will attempt to measure the visitor's aims and interest areas and may provide shallower or deeper information for the object. These systems may need special technologies for target detection. These electronic guides can provide the museum management with useful statistics and reports,Learning from Museums: Visitor Experiences and the Making of Meaning (2000), American Association for State and Local History Book Series. . which may include tour statistics, visitor statistics, opinions, and other surveys. Cell phone tours A cell phone tour is an audio tour where pre-recorded or stream audio interpretation for a heritage site or a cultural exhibit is provided via a cell phone.Stephen Neuhauser, Cells and Sites: How Historic Sites are Using Cell Phone Tours , National Trust Historic Sites Blog , July 3, 2008. Cell phone audio tours have the advantage that most visitors already have the equipment needed to take the audio tour, being their cell phones. Each venue is assigned a phone number with appropriate stop numbers, displayed next to the exhibit. Once a visitor has dialled in, they will be prompted and can enter the corresponding stop number of the exhibit they’re viewing, to hear the recorded content. These tours also enable the visitors to: fast forward, rewind, pause, as well as leave a feedback message for each exhibit or the whole tour; simply by pressing a number. In addition to audio content, some providers are also able to stream video, and text message recent visitors with updates . This is the old-style approach, not used widely. Smartphone tours Smartphones have significant advantages over cell phones, as they have story-triggering technologies (GPS, bluetooth, NFC, QR-code scanner) and can use the power of mobile apps to deliver the right story in the right language in the right place and in the right context (e.g. the evening tour, or a winter tour). Stories could be adjusted to the pace and mood of the user. Of course, such guided tours will use other types of content, above audio: photo, texts, video, quests. Such apps can work online and offline. Smartphone tours could guide the user outdoor (streets, highways, zoos, parks, archaeological sites) and indoor (museums), using different guiding techniques. There are many apps available on the market, developed by cities, museums and private companies: Examples (individual guides): * Detour (various international capitals) * City Pirates (Audioguides for German cities) * Louvre Museum Paris (also virtual tours for Nintendo DS) * iTour Bamberg (history tour developed by City of Bamberg, Germany) =Platform solutions= Like it happens with any other type of content (e.g., YouTube in video), development of smartphone guiding apps inevitably led to the launch of so-called \\"platforms\\", which aggregate thousands of tours and stories: ;Examples (platforms) * izi.TRAVEL * PocketGuide * Guidigo * VoiceMap etc. Those platforms often come with the disadvantage of varied quality and missing update responsibility for individual tours. Some offer free tours while others rely on paid audio guides. However, there are also many beneficial changes due to the existence of audio guide platforms: ;The museum market changes * Museums can publish guided tours in an hour and change it at any moment. The audio guide is not anymore a one-time-off project * Museums finally own the content they develop (in the age of hardware audio guides museums rarely owned the content) * Museums can go outside and provide tours for the city * Museums can cooperate with other cultural institutions * Museums can invite people from the local communities to help them to develop stories (i.e. leverage the crowdsourcing) * Museums can finally invade the tourism market and carry on their educational mission on tourists * With a new voice, with other museums, with crowdsourced projects, with co-operation with tourism and universities, museums can apply for large grants from public funds ;The tourism market changes * Cities can control the tourist's traffic, e.g. send tourists away from the city center * From the other side, the small cities around big ones can get some tourists by providing guided tours * Cities can enrich the rent-a-bike/boat/car experience with storytelling * Cities may help tourists to \\"feel like local\\" with the help of local communities * In the city context, museums and story developers can enjoy local businesses to promote their tours and stories for free, as such tours bring extra value for the users of such businesses. E.g. public transport, mobile operators, hotels, rental services are happy to promote the tours in the vicinity. It is called the Storytelling Smart City concept. ;The modern technology implications * Self-driving cars introduce an opportunity to make mobile storytelling a part of car infotainment system. Passengers will get stories on the roads (presumably for free), and those stories will be * Personal assistant apps like Apple Siri or Google Assistant will use location- based stories as well. Being the audio-based apps, such assistants do need audio-based and location-based content. Development of \\"storytelling capacity\\" for Voice Assistants will be a powerful driver for raising public interest to Mobile Storytelling and attract more storytellers and funds.

During his seven-year tenure with the group, Cook oversaw the production of nearly one-hundred new plays by fifty American playwrights. He is particularly remembered for producing the first plays of Eugene O'Neill, along with those of Cook's wife Susan Glaspell, and several other noted writers. While teaching English literature at the University of Iowa from 1896 to 1899, Cook also taught what is thought to be the first creative writing course. Titled \\"Verse-Making,\\" the course was continued by Cook's colleagues at the university after he left. It was not until the 1950s that the Iowa Writers Workshop was founded. Biography Cook wrote: \\"I was born and raised in Davenport, Iowa, where my family was one of the town's oldest and most wealthy. My father, a corporate lawyer, strongly encouraged my education from a young age, while my mother instilled in me a passion for culture and the arts. I completed my bachelor's degree at Harvard in 1893.\\" He continued his studies in Europe at the University of Heidelberg in 1894 and at the University of Geneva the following year. Upon completing these studies, Cook returned to Iowa. He taught English literature and classics at the University of Iowa from 1895 until 1899. He also taught an early creative writing course, which he called \\"Verse Making\\".[https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/20713/Cohen_washington_0250E_10606.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed;=n Sarah Cohen, School of Unlikeness: The Creative Writing Workshop and American Poetry], PhD dissertation, 2012, University of Washington During the 1902 academic year, Cook was an English professor at Stanford University. It was not until the 1950s that Paul Engle is credited with developing what is considered the world's first creative writing program, the Iowa Writer's Workshop, which has gained renown.A Community of Writers: Paul Engle and the Iowa Writers' Workshop, ed. Robert Dana, University of Iowa Press, 1999, p226S. Wilbers, The Iowa Writers Workshop: Origins, Emergence and Growth, University of Iowa Press, 1980, p35 In Davenport, Cook associated with other young writers in what was informally referred to as the Davenport group. Among them was writer Susan Glaspell. He divorced his second wife, and he and Glaspell married in 1913. To escape community gossip and seek larger world for their work, the couple moved to New York City, where they lived in Greenwich Village. There they had a daughter Nilla and son Harl together. In the summer of 1915 they went to Provincetown, Massachusetts for the season, as did many other writers and artists from the Village. Cook was among the founders of the Provincetown Players that year, an important step in the development of American theatre. The group would perform works by Cook and Glaspell, as well as the first plays of Eugene O'Neill and Edna St. Vincent Millay, among others. Cook would lead the Provincetown Players until 1919, at which time he took a sabbatical. Although he returned to the group in 1920, internal wrangling and his own frustration led to his effectively abandoning the cooperative. Later years Wife Susan Glaspell with Cook wearing his fustanella. Pictured also is Cook's dog from which he contracted a fatal disease. In 1922, Cook and his family moved to Greece. They lived at Delphi, where they spent the summers camped in spruce huts high above the village on Mount Parnassus. After a short time, Cook began to wear fustanella, the traditional Greek shepherd's attire. In 1924 he contracted a rare infectious disease from his pet dog and died. Cook's obituary appeared on the front page of the New York Times. He is buried at Delphi in a small cemetery within hundreds of feet of the ruins of the famous Temple of Apollo, home of the oracle. So beloved was Cook by the locals that the Greek government allowed a stone from the temple foundation to be used as his grave marker. Years later his daughter Nilla Cram Cook was buried beside him.

Born in Lisdowney, County Kilkenny, Carroll first played competitive hurling during his schooling at St. Kieran's College. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of eighteen when he first linked up with the Kilkenny minor team. He made his senior debut during the 1971 championship. Carroll subsequently became a regular member of the starting fifteen and won three All-Ireland medals, five Leinster medals and one National Hurling League medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on three occasions. As a member of the Leinster inter- provincial team on a number of occasions Carroll won one Railway Cup medal. At club level he won one championship medal with University College Dublin while he also enjoyed a lengthy career with Lisdowney. His brother-in-law, Jimmy O'Brien, was a two-time All-Ireland medallist with Wexford. Throughout his career Carroll made 22 championship appearances. He retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1971 championship. In retirement from playing Carroll became involved in the administrative affairs of the Gaelic Athletic Association. He served as secretary of the Kilkenny County Board between 1984 and 1995. Carroll is regarded as one of the greatest hurlers of his era, culminating with his selection as the Texaco Hurler of the Year in 1969. He has sometimes been voted onto teams made up of the sport's greats, including at centre-back on the Fitzgibbon Cup Hurling Team of the Century in 2012. Playing career = College = During his schooling at St. Kieran's College in Kilkenny, Carroll established himself as a key member of the senior hurling team. In 1957 he was captain of the team and won a Leinster medal following a 6-3 to 3-0 defeat of Patrician College. St. Flannan's College provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland decider and held the lead until the dying minutes. A late goal at the death secured a remarkable 4-2 to 2-7 victory for St. Kieran's and an All-Ireland medal for Carroll. = University = During his studies at University College Dublin, Carroll quickly came to the attention of the selectors of the college hurling team. In 1958 he failed to make the starting fifteen but was included on the extended panel as the Dublin outfit faced University College Galway in the final of the Fitzgibbon Cup. A huge 7-9 to 2-1 victory gave Carroll, who came on as a substitute, a first Fitzgibbon Cup medal. UCD surrendered their title to old rivals University College Cork in 1959, however, the sides renewed their rivalry the following year. By now Carroll was a regular at centre-back and won a second Fitzgibbon Cup medal following the 4-10 to 4-3 victory. Carroll lined out in a fourth successive Fitzgibbon Cup decider in 1961, as University College Galway provided the opposition once again. The game was a close affair, however, a narrow 3-6 to 3-4 victory gave Carroll a third Fitzgibbon Cup medal. = Club = Carroll first enjoyed success at club level as a Gaelic footballer with Galmoy, an amalgamation of teams from Johnstown, Galmoy and Lisdowney. In 1955 he was a member of the minor team that faced St. Canice's in the minor decider. A 2-7 to 1-2 victory gave Carroll his first championship medal. By this stage Carroll was also a regular on the Lisdowney junior team. In 1960 the team qualified for just their second ever junior championship decider, having lost at their first attempt eighteen years earlier. A hard-fought 3-8 to 2-5 defeat of Knocktopher secured a championship medal for Carroll. His studies in Dublin also allowed Carroll to line out for University College Dublin in their county championship. A defeat of St. Vincent's in the 1961 secured a Kilkenny Senior Hurling Championship medal for Carroll. After just two years in the top flight of Kilkenny hurling, Lisdowney qualified for the senior decider in 1962. A 5-7 to 2-8 defeat by Bennettsbridge resulted in disappointment for Carroll. By 1978 Carroll was approaching forty years of age, however, he still continued to line out with Lisdowney who were now playing in the intermediate grade. The club reached the final that year, however, a 2-21 to 4-7 score line resulted in defeat of Carroll's side. =Minor= Carroll was seventeen year-old when he was called up to the Kilkenny minor team in 1956. He won a Leinster medal that year following a 4–7 to 3–7 defeat of Wexford in the provincial decider. On 23 September 1956 Kilkenny faced Tipperary in the All-Ireland final. A 4–16 to 1–5 trouncing, with teen sensation Jimmy Doyle contributing 2-3, resulted in defeat for Carroll and his side. The following year Carroll added a second Leinster medal to his collection, as Offaly were defeated by 5–10 to 4–2. For the second year in-a-row, Tipperary provided the opposition in the All-Ireland final on 1 September 1957. In a close game Tipperary eventually triumphed by 4–7 to 3–7. =Senior= Early success Carroll made his senior championship debut on 18 June 1961 in a 6-8 to 5-7 Leinster semi-final defeat by Wexford. After two years without success, Carroll won his first Leinster medal in 1963 following a 2–10 to 0–9 defeat of Dublin. This victory allowed Kilkenny to advance directly into an All-Ireland showdown with Waterford on 1 September 1963. \\"The Cats\\" entered the game as underdogs, however, Eddie Keher proved to be the difference with a magnificent display in which he scored fourteen points. Despite a hat-trick of goals from Waterford's Séamus Power, Kilkenny secured a 4–17 to 6–8 victory. It was Carroll's first All-Ireland medal. All-Ireland defeats Carroll added a second Leinster medal to his collection in 1964 as Dublin were defeated on a 4–11 to 1–8 score line. The All-Ireland final on 6 September 1964 saw Kilkenny enter the game as firm favourites against fierce rivals Tipperary. John \\"Mackey\\" McKenna scored Tipperary's first goal after ten minutes as the Munster champions took a 1–8 to 0–6 interval lead. The second half saw Tipperary score goals for fun, with Donie Nealon getting a hat-trick and Seán McLoughlin another. Kilkenny were humiliated at the full-time whistle as Tipperary triumphed by 5–13 to 2–8. After surrendering their provincial crown in 1965, Kilkenny bounced back the following year by reaching the final of the National Hurling League. An aggregate 10–15 to 2–15 defeat of New York gave Carroll a league medal. He later won a third Leinster medal following a 1–15 to 2–6 defeat of Wexford. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 4 September 1966 pitted Kilkenny against Cork for the first time in nineteen years. Kilkenny were the favourites, however, a hat-trick of goals by Colm Sheehan gave Cork a merited 3–9 to 1–10 victory. Kilkenny resurgence Carroll was moved to left corner-back in 1967 and collected a fourth Leinster medal as Kilkenny retained their provincial crown following a 4–10 to 1–12 defeat of Wexford after a scare in the opening half. On 3 September 1967 Kilkenny faced Tipperary in the All- Ireland decider. Tipperary looked like continuing their hoodoo over their near rivals as they took a 2–6 to 1–3 lead at half-time. Goalkeeper Ollie Walsh was the hero for Kilkenny as he made a series of spectacular saves, however, the team lost Eddie Keher and Tom Walsh to injury in the second half. In spite of this, Kilkenny laid to rest a bogey that Tipperary had over the team since 1922, and a 3–8 to 2–7 victory gave Carroll a second All-Ireland medal. He finished off the year by claiming an Oireachtas medal following a 4-4 to 1-8 defeat of Clare. Wexford put an end to Kilkenny's hopes of retaining the title in 1968, however, the Noresiders bounced back the following year with Carroll collecting a fifth Leinster medal following a 3–9 to 0–16 defeat of Offaly. On 7 September 1969 Kilkenny took on Cork in the All-Ireland decider. The Leesiders got into their stride following an early goal by Charlie McCarthy and led by six points coming up to half time when Kilkenny raised a green flag themselves. Kilkenny upped their performance after the interval and ran out winners on a 2–15 to 2–9 scoreline. The victory gave Carroll a third All- Ireland medal as well as the man of the match title, while he was later named as the Texaco Hurler of the Year. Cork and Kilkenny renewed their rivalry before the end of the year, however, a 4-14 to 3-10 victory gave Carroll a second Oireachtas medal. Decline After surrendering their provincial and All-Ireland crowns to Wexford the following year, Carroll was dropped from the starting fifteen in 1971. He was a non-playing substitute as Kilkenny defeated Wexford by 6-16 to 3-16 to take the Leinster title once again. On 5 September 1971 Kilkenny faced Tipperary in the All-Ireland final, however, Carroll still remained on the bench. He was introduced as a substitute for \\"Fan\\" Larkin, however, Tipperary emerged the victors on a score line of 5–17 to 5–14. This defeat brought the curtain down on Carroll’s inter-county career. =Inter-provincial= In 1965 Carroll was at centre-back on the Leinster inter-provincial team. He won a Railway Cup medal that year following Leinster's 2-11 to 0-9 defeat of Munster. Post-playing career In retirement from playing Carroll became involved in the administrative affairs of the Gaelic Athletic Association. In 1982 he was elected chairman of the Northern Board before taking over as secretary of the Kilkenny County Board in 1984. Carroll held this position for over a decade. Personal life Born in Lisdowney, County Kilkenny, Carroll and his twin brother, Mick, were raised on the family farm. Educated locally at Lisdowney National School, he was enrolled in St. Kieran's College in 1952. After finishing his studies here in 1958, Carroll was accepted to University College Dublin, however, an administrative error meant that he received no notification of the fact that he had been accepted to the veterinary course. Instead he started studying agricultural science and, following his graduation, Carroll began working with Teagasc. Carroll married Angela Lenehan, a native of Kilkenny city, in 1966 and settled down in the Dicksboro area of Kilkenny. The couple had five children: Pat (born 1967), Donal (born 1969), Helen (born 1971), Ted (born 1973) and David (born 1977). On 22 December 1995 Carroll died suddenly.

Background Working on and off as a car salesman, a mapmaker and a topographer, Everett was arrested in September 1980 following a bank robbery in Knoxville, Tennessee and convicted of armed robbery. However, after escaping from federal custody less than a month later, he fled to Alabama in a stolen car in violation of the Dyer Act. After another bank robbery in Orlando, Florida, additional warrants against Everett were filed in November, and he was eventually added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list on May 13, 1981, for over 86 bank robberies. Capture and aftermath Evading authorities for a year and a half, Everett robbed another bank in Sacramento, California in January 1983. Everett took up residency in the State of Arkansas. Three years later, Officer Kevin Faler from the Hot Springs Police Department at Hot Springs National Park, along with other officers, arrested him on August 12, 1985, after a 45-minute vehicle pursuit. After the pursuit, Everett was found in possession of a loaded 357 Magnum, stolen bank money and a hand-held programmable police scanner along with a piece of graph paper outlining the map of Arkansas counties with police frequency codes. He was subsequently arrested and again tried escaping from the city jail at least twice. He was subsequently imprisoned in a Federal penitentiary in the State of Kentucky sentenced to 20 years. According to Officer Tony Bishop of the Hot Springs Police Department, Mr. Everett was a violent man with a violent past. Officer Kevin Faler received a commendation for the capture of the F.B.I.'s Ten Most Wanted in America. After serving 18 years in prison, Everett was released in 2003 and died in 2005.

Ancient Egypt also has its own museum. History of the building The neo-classical building at Königsplatz with Corinthian columns was established in 1848 as counterpart to the opposite Glyptothek and commissioned by the Bavarian King Ludwig I. The architect was Georg Friedrich Ziebland. Already from 1869 to 1872 the building housed the royal antiquarium before the Munich Secession resided here from 1898 to 1912. From 1919 the building contained the New State Gallery. The museum building was severely damaged by bombing in World War II but was reconstructed and reopened to the public in the late 1960s to display the State Collection of Antiques. Collections Dionysus cup by Exekias (circa 530 BC) Golden garland of Armento The State Collection of Antiquities is based on the Wittelsbach antique collections, especially the collection of attic vases of King Ludwig I. In 1831 his agent Martin von Wagner acquired pottery from the archeological excavation in Vulci, his agent Friedrich von Thiersch purchased by auction the antiques from the estate of Lucien Bonaparte. The king acquired also antique gold jewellery from the collection of Caroline Murat, Etruscan bronzes excavated in Perugia and Greek terra-cottas from South Italy. After the king's death in 1868 his collection was united with the Wittelsbach antique collection which was founded already by Albert V, Duke of Bavaria. Later the museum got extended by purchase and donations. Among these private collections are the donations of Paul Arndt (1908), of James Loeb (1933), and of Hans von Schoen (1964). These comprehensive collections specialised in smaller antique objects, glassware, bronzes, terra-cottas, jewelry, gold and silver. During World War II the museum lost especially Etruscan pottery, which was stored in the bombed Neue Pinakothek. Permanent exhibition =Antique pottery= The internationally renowned collection of antique pottery is outstanding, comparable only with the collections of the Louvre and the British Museum. On display is already Cycladic art. The Mycenaean pottery is represented as well as the pottery from the geometric, the archaic, the classical and the Hellenistic period in Greece. The museum exhibits artworks of the most famous Greek potters and painters like the Amasis Painter, Exekias, Archikles, Glaukytes, the Penthesilea Painter, the Andokides Painter, Oltos, Kleophon, Phintias, Euphronios, Euthymides, Epiktetos, the Pan Painter, the Berlin Painter, Hieron, Makron, Douris, the Brygos Painter, the Acheloos Painter and Lydos. The collection contains numerous masterpieces such as the Belly Amphora by the Andokides Painter ( between 520 and 510 BC) and the Dionysus cup by Exekias (circa 530 BC). One of the masterpieces of Etruscan art is a head vessel depicting the Etruscan demon Charun (400-350 BC). =Terracotta and bronzes= The Standing Woman is a notable statuette of terracotta (Boeotia from the crossing of 5. by the 4th century B.C.). The Beauty is one of the best preserved ancient terracotta figures in the world. It was made in the early 3rd century BC and was found in the vicinity of Athens. The Goddess of Beauty and Love is a masterpiece of Hellenstic bronze art and dates back to around 100 BC. = Jewellery and glass= Roman cage cup from Cologne (circa 400 AD) An outstanding example for antique jewellery is the gold Funerary Garland from Armento (4th century BC). A Golden Diadem from the Black Sea, an elaborately decorated headdress from the Crimean Peninsula was produced in around 150 BC. A famous Roman Goblet from Cologne made of reticella (or network) glass (4th century AD) still shows its Latin inscription BIBE MULTIS ANNIS (Drink many years yet!). It was a present of the City of Cologne in return for King Ludwig's support for the completion of Cologne Cathedral. = Portraits and gems= An antique mummy portrait which originates from around 140 AD depicts a young upper-class man of imperial Egypt belongs to the most beautiful and best-quality antique mummy portraits that exist. Part of the Staatliche Antikensammlungen is also a comprehensive collection of ca 800 engraved gems donated by Helmut Hansmann (1924-1996).

They had won the two previous tournaments and were considered much stronger than the other three home nations, none of whom had qualified for the finals in Mexico. The English however struggled in their opening fixture, drawing with the Welsh away, and although they subsequently beat the Irish, were unable to overcome the Scots. Scotland had a good opening to the campaign, but drew their last two games, whilst Wales salvaged parity following a victory over Ireland in their final fixture.

On November 7, 2007, Glass Lips opened in New York City. The New York Times critic, Jeannette Catsoulis, wrote: “Lech Majewski creates an aesthetic of dysfunction that’s as beautiful as it is disturbing. After a while the film’s expressiveness becomes so hypnotic that it’s difficult not to make your own connections.” Joe Leydon of Variety wrote: “Glass Lips exerts a chilly fascination from minute to minute… Experimental pic by noted Polish-born artist-filmmaker is a harshly beautiful, dialogue-free meditation on the indelible influence of childhood trauma.” New York Post film critic, V. A. Musetto, gave the film three and a half stars (out of four) and wrote: “The hypnotic, painterly images of Glass Lips combine with haunting music in one of the most unusual, beautiful films of the year.” The film stars Patryk Czajka as Sebastian, Joanna Litwin as Sebastian’s mother, and Grzegorz Przybył as Sebastian’s father. As the film begins, Sebastian is in a mental asylum; he recalls events from his life beginning with his birth. Many of the sequences of the film are surrealistic. None of the actors speak any words, but the electronic voice of an answering machine gives the date at one point, and there is a voice-over song that gets repeated. The film includes some shocking images, such as a woman who gives birth to a large bloody rock, and a man eating dog food. In addition to directing, Majewski is credited as the writer, producer, and cinematographer.http://www.lechmajewski.com/html/blood_of_a_poet.html  Cast  * Patryk Czajka as Sebastian * Joanna Litwin as Mother * Grzegorz Przybył as Father * Ryszarda Celińska as Older Mother * Leonard Brzoza as Sebastian - teenage boy * Warner Widera as Sebastian - kid * Dorota Lis as Doris * Michalina Rutowska as Maid Notes External links * * Official Polish website Lech Majewski Artysta Obrazu Obraz Artysty *epoznan.pl Category:2007 films Category:Films directed by Lech Majewski Category:Polish films Category:American films ","title":"Glass Lips"},{"id":"9524312","text":"Coláiste Ailigh is a secondary school in County Donegal, Ireland, offering a curriculum taught through the Irish language.

Richard Nash, lyrics by Carolyn Leigh, and music by Cy Coleman. The original production opened on Broadway in 1960, starring a 49-year-old Lucille Ball in her only Broadway show. The show introduced the song \\"Hey, Look Me Over\\", which was subsequently performed as a cover version by several musicians. Background and production Nash had envisioned the main character of Wildy as a woman in her late 20s, and was forced to rewrite the role when Lucille Ball expressed interest not only in playing it but financing the project as well. Desilu, the company owned by Ball and her soon-to-be ex-husband Desi Arnaz, ultimately invested $360,000 in the show in exchange for 36% of the net profits, the rights to the original cast recording (ultimately released by RCA Victor), and television rights for musical numbers to be included in a special titled Lucy Goes to Broadway, a project that eventually was scrapped. Ball also was permitted to choose her leading man. Kirk Douglas's salary demands and heavy film schedule eliminated him from the running, and Gordon MacRae, Jock Mahoney, and Gene Barry were considered before she selected Keith Andes. Michael Kidd, who co-produced with Nash, directed and choreographed, and he got songwriters Coleman and Leigh on board.

After two previews, the show opened on December 16 at the Alvin Theatre. The cast included Paula Stewart and Swen Swenson, with Valerie Harper among the chorus members. Vivian Vance, Ball's costar from I Love Lucy, was in the opening night audience and was photographed giving the star a congratulatory hug backstage after the show. Hampered by lukewarm reviews and Ball's lingering illness, it ran for only 171 performances. Ball quickly realized audiences had come expecting to see her Lucy Ricardo persona and began mugging and ad- libbing to bring her characterization closer to that of the zany housewife she had portrayed in I Love Lucy. It was clearly Ball who was drawing the crowds, and when she fell ill and demands for refunds ran high, the producers announced plans to close the show for a week in late March 1961 to allow her to recover her strength. The closure came sooner than planned when Ball, suffering from a virus and chronic fatigue, departed for Florida on February 8.Karol, Michael.

This ultimately made it infeasible for the production to remain active, forcing it to close permanently on June 3, 1961. Wildcat was Ball's only appearance in a Broadway production. She previously had been cast in the Bartlett Cormack play Hey Diddle Diddle, a comedy that premiered in Princeton, New Jersey on January 21, 1937. Ball played the part of Julie Tucker, \\"one of three roommates coping with neurotic directors, confused executives, and grasping stars who interfere with the girls' ability to get ahead.\\" The play received good reviews, but there were problems, chiefly with its star Conway Tearle; the play was scheduled to open on Broadway at the Vanderbilt Theatre, but closed after one week in Washington, D.C. when Tearle suddenly became gravely ill.Brady, Kathleen (2001), Lucille: The Life of Lucille Ball. New York: Watson-Guptill Publications, pp. 73-74. The Australian production of Wildcat starring Toni Lamond opened at Princess Theatre, Melbourne in July 19, 1963. The production employed British actor Gordon Boyd and Canadian actress Norah Halliday to play Joe Dynamite and Janie, respectively, among a cast of 82 performers. The Australian production reinstated cut song \\"Ain't It Sad, Ain't It Mean\\" as a duet for Wildcat and Sookie. The show closed September 14, 1963. Plot Wildcat \\"Wildy\\" Jackson arrives in 1912 in Centavo City with dreams of striking oil but with neither capital nor know-how to help her accomplish her goal. Joe Dynamite, the most successful crew foreman in the territory, finds her ruggedness appealing and agrees to work with her if she can prove ownership to her claimed land and hire a crew. She finds owned by a hermit prospector, but Joe is certain the property is dry. Wildy attempts to lure him with her female charms, but when he still rejects her plans she has him falsely arrested, then released into her custody. A grateful Joe agrees to start work on the project but abandons it once he discovers it was Wildy who had him jailed. Left high and literally dry by her partner and crew, Wildy resorts to desperate measures to strike a Texas-sized gusher.

He scored 58 goals in 270 appearances in the 7 seasons he was there.FA Cup Final 1959 In 1958 against Manchester City he was the first Forest player to score a First Division post-war hat trick. His goal against Aston Villa at Hillsborough won that 1958-59 FA Cup semi final. Forest were 2-0 up after 14 minutes. Luton Town hit back midway through the second half after Forest's opening goalscorer Roy Dwight broke his leg in the 33rd minute. Forest had further personnel issue when cramp reduced Bill Whare to little more than a hobbling spectator. Quigley helped Forest protect their 2-1 lead to lift the trophy at Wembley.FA Cup Final 1959 He left Nottingham Forest in February 1965. =Huddersfield Town and Bristol City= At Huddersfield Town he scored 5 goals in 68 appearances.

A location was rented, and the first camp was attended by 23 boys. In 1949, incorporation papers were obtained in the name of Susque Boys' Club, Inc. In 1951 Camp Kline, where the first camp was held, became unavailable, so Bob Dittmar began looking for an alternative location. Land along Lycoming Creek in Lycoming County was available and ideal, so the advisory board met, and agreed to purchase the land for $10,000. In 1953 the purchase was finalized, and the following summer, Camp Susque moved to its current location. Bob Dittmar and Bob Christenson designed a logo for the camp. Camp Susque's observatory, used for stargazing, is on the left. On the right is the Susque Pond. Attendance continued to grow, and the facilities continued to expand. As such, a girl's camp program was added, and the name changed to Camp Susque.2 Each year, there are three weeks of a boys only camp, with three levels, Littlemen (grades 3-5), Redmen (grades 6-8), and Woodsmen (grades 9-11), followed by three weeks of girls only camp with the levels of Jays (grades 3-5), Doves (grades 6-8), and Hawks (grades 9-11). The camp also has a \\"Young Explorers Camp\\" for children grades 1~3 who are not yet old enough to attend the regular week-long camp. There is also a \\"Family Camp\\" where families can rent a tent platform, cabin, or room in a lodge. Camp Susque also offers off-site \\"Wilderness Trips\\", for teens 14-18. One of these, the \\"Adirondack Adventure\\" is a week long canoe trip in New York; it entails canoeing each day to a different island, and camping there for the night. There is also a hike up Mount Ampersand in the middle of the week.2 Camp Susque also houses and sponsors The Susque Academy. The academy is a two-week intensive worldview studies program, primarily intended as an academic and spiritual formation opportunity for high school and early college-age students. The curriculum consists of five core classes focusing on worldviews, apologetics, devotional classics, Biblical studies, and practical theology. The program goal is to ground students in Christian truth while exposing them to alternative truth- claims found in contemporary culture. Additional seminars provide a look at art, music, literature, science, ethics, politics, leadership, and personal discipline. Camp Susque is not only a summer camp, but also has events during the winter season. Winter Camps are co-ed and split into four age groups. The Chill is for campers in grades 3-5, the Frost for grades 6-8, the Freeze for grades 9-12 and the Blast for college-age young adults. Freeze and Blast occur during or over the Christmas to New Year's holidays. Frost and Chill occur in January and late February, respectively.

The racetrack is often referred to as \\"the border oval\\" because of the track's proximity (barely a mile as the crow flies) to the U.S. border. Its most important race is the Prince of Wales Stakes, the second leg of the Canadian Triple Crown. History Fort Erie Race Track was built by the Fort Erie Jockey Club and opened on June 16, 1897. It was at one time owned by the Cella family, who also owned Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas. They sold it in 1952 to renowned Canadian horseman E. P. Taylor, acting on behalf of the Ontario Jockey Club. Prior to this acquisition, Fort Erie was regarded as a \\"ramshackle\\" facility that was restricted to only 14 days of racing a year. Taylor closed many of the smaller tracks around Ontario and instead focused on developing Thoroughbred racing in Toronto and Fort Erie. Taylor expanded the racing season for Fort Erie to 42 days over the summer. He also hired horticulturist Gene Muma, who transformed the facility into \\"physically, the most beautiful race course in North America.\\" In 1996, the Ontario government announced that it would open casinos, to be operated by the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG), at racetracks across the province. To compensate the tracks for the use of their facilities and potential \\"cannibalization\\" of customers, the OLG directed 20% of the revenue from slot machines to the racetracks, which responded by increasing purse sizes. However, the subsidy was abruptly removed in June 2012, leading to the announcement that Fort Erie Race Track would close at the end of the year. The track inked a one-year transition funding deal with the province in early 2013, which allowed it to open and run the 2013 season. In November 2013 plans were unveiled by the Fort Erie Live Racing Consortium for the track to host a festival meet around the theme of the Chinese Year of the Horse, with the Prince of Wales Stakes running in July. The plan also called for horse training to begin in late April, followed by a point-based racing tournament running through early August. Racing continued on until early October, with a total of 400 races across the season. A consortium led by American businessmen Carl Paladino, Joel Castle and Joe Mosey purchased the property in August 2014. Paladino stated that he had planned to invest in the track to capitalize on the construction of Canadian Motor Speedway, but that the speedway's status in \\"development hell\\" (which Paladino blamed on the Liberal Party of Ontario's opposition to an exit ramp off the Queen Elizabeth Way for the speedway) led him to consider selling off the track if the Liberals won the 2018 provincial election. At one point, Paladino listed the property of roughly 300 acres in several parcels with a total value of C$17.25 million. However, with the 2018 election of the Conservative party, Paladino announced that he would hold on to the race track. In 2018, the Ontario government reached a 19 year funding agreement with Ontario Racing. \\"A few years ago, Fort Erie wondered if they would survive,\\" said John Hayes, chairman of Ontario Racing. \\"It's time to stop worrying about the past. Instead of worrying about putting food on the table, we need to worry about how we can flourish and thrive.\\" Racing fixtures The Prince of Wales Stakes is Fort Erie's most important annual event. It was first run in 1929 but achieved its current prominence in 1959 when E.P. Taylor made it the second leg of the Canadian Triple Crown. Among the winners of the Prince of Wales are New Providence, With Approval, Dance Smartly, Peteski and Wando. The Puss N Boots Cup is run annually at the start of the fall meeting. It is named after the horse Puss N Boots, who was leading in the Vandal Stakes (then run at Fort Erie) when he decided to jump the inner hedge near the finish line. The horse landed in one of the infield ponds, dumping his jockey in the process. In recognition, the winning jockey of the Cup jumps into the pond in celebration. A number of other stakes races were once run at Fort Erie but have since been transferred to Woodbine. This includes the Bison City Stakes, the second leg of the Canadian Triple Tiara for fillies. Northern Dancer won the Summer Stakes in 1963 when it was still run at Fort Erie. Dachshund racing was added to the track's schedule in 2018; the success of the first race held that year led to the addition of a basset hound race for 2019.https://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/news/2019/01/19/fort-erie-race-track- going-to-the-dogs-again.html References Category:Horse racing venues in Ontario Category:Sports venues in Ontario Category:1897 establishments in Ontario Category:Sports venues completed in 1897 ","title":"Fort Erie Race Track"},{"id":"9524365","text":"Kiamichi Technology Center is a public career and technology education center in Wilburton, Oklahoma.

He is an Olympian, Winter X Games, and U.S. Grand Prix Champion. Early life Louis Vito was born in Columbus, Ohio, but grew up in the nearby city of Bellefontaine. In his teenage years, he moved to Vermont to pursue his love of snowboarding by enrolling in the Stratton Mountain School – a ski and snowboarding academy. There, he spent his high school years snowboarding in the morning and studying in the afternoons, and traveling to competitions when time permitted. After graduating high school, he moved to Sandy, Utah. Career Louie Vito has won four of the past five U.S. Snowboarding Grand Prix Overall Championships, six X Games medals, two Winter Dew Tour Cup Overall Championships, among many other accolades. He rose to prominence on the professional snowboarding scene at age 17 by completing a backside 1080 at the Australian Open Snowboarding Championships – making him the first rider to successfully pull off the complex move in an Australian competition. This helped propel Vito to the top of the podium, capturing his first of two consecutive championships there. Vito is currently the reigning Winter Dew Tour Overall Champion and U.S. Grand Prix Overall Champion. In September of 2009 Vito competed on the ninth season of Dancing With the Stars. Partnered with professional dancer Chelsie Hightower, he rehearsed for the show at the same time that he was training for the Olympics. Three months later, he represented the United States at the 21st Olympic Games in Vancouver. Charity Each year Vito holds the \\"Louie Vito Rail Jam\\" in his hometown at Mad River Mountain. The event is held to mentor young riders who are given the opportunity to compete without an entry fee and get outfitted in Vito’s premium gear. The Rail Jam supports local charity, St. Vincent De Paul, through money raised from auction items and food donated for the food bank by everyone who attends.

Jean-Baptiste Forqueray (3 April 1699 – 28 June 1782), the son of Antoine Forqueray, was a player of the viol and a composer. Forqueray was born in Paris. He is most famous today for his 1747 publication of twenty-nine pieces for viol and continuo which he attributed to his father (except for three, for which he himself took credit). In the avertissement he states that he was responsible for the bass line (thus the figures as well) and the viol fingerings. Stylistically, they are very much influenced by Italian music and belong to the generation of Jean-Marie Leclair (1697–1764) and Jean-Pierre Guignon (1702–1774). Modern violists regard these Pieces de viole as the most virtuosic music for the instrument. Paolo Pandolfo and Lorenz Duftschmid have both recorded the complete publication. Forqueray published the same pieces for harpsichord, possibly in arrangements made by his wife Marie-Rose, in 1749 (ed. Colin Tilney, Paris, 1970) but remarkably did not transpose any of the music, so the melodies lie relatively low in the range of the harpsichord. Forqueray's pupils included Louis XV's daughter Princesse Henriette-Anne and the future King Frederick William II of Prussia. Forqueray was married twice: to Jeanne Nolson on 29 July 1732 and, after her death, to the harpsichordist Marie-Rose Dubois on 13 March 1741. He died in Paris .

Situation The municipality O Saviñao is located in the Ribeira Sacra, in the District of Terra de Lemos, located in the southern part of the province of Lugo, bordered by the municipalities of Pardela and Taboada to the north, Pantón to the south and east, Monforte de Lemos and Vault and west Taboada and Chantada. The average altitude is 600 meters above sea level, crossing the area are the rivers Río Sardiñeira, Rio Saviñao, Rio Pez, Rio Barrantes and Rio Porriño. The river Miño is the longest river in Galicia and forms the western boundary of the councils area. The council consist of 29 parishes, its capital, Escairón, with approximately one thousand inhabitants, the second town is Currelos, the economy of the town is mainly agricultural, also has dairies, Bodegas (wineries), construction, etc. Plus the odd rural tourism business in the form of Casas Rurais. Escarión also has a very small industrial estate. Markets (ferias) are held, in Escairón on 8 and 9 of every month and in Currelos on 26 of the month. Heritage The municipality of O Saviñao possesses a wealth of valuable heritage. In archaeology include the Anta-Abuime or field Mamoas of Abuime. This is a small burial chamber situated about four kilometres to the north of Escairón. There are numerous castros (Celtic settlements) in this council, including Abuime de Castro, Castro de Torre in Freán, Castro de Illón in Licin, Castro da Portela in Diomondi, Mourelos de Castro, Castro Besta in Vilelos and Castro de Villacaiz. The Villacaiz and Abuime are the most visible. Architecture Examples of the varied architecture of churches and other religious buildings in the area include * The Pazo in Vilelos, ‘L’ shaped, with a chapel plus shields of Ulloa. The founders of the Pazo were Don Juan Gonzalez de Ulloa and Doña Catalina Lopez of Sober. It is not open to the public. * The Pazo Arxeriz of which was owned by Juan Lopez Súarez (Xan of Forcados), its first founder was Gonzalo Raxo, Knight of the Order of Santiago in the mid-sixteenth century. It has a square and highlights its two escutcheons located on the north facade of Pazo; has many units that were annexed recently restored. It is now a museum, see links below. * Pazo das Cortes, near the Romanesque church of San Pelayo of Diomondi is U shaped and has an attached chapel dedicated to Our Lady of the Assumption. There are shields of Somoza, from the eighteenth century. Not open to the public- * Casa da Abbey of St. Stephen Ribas do Minho, is surrounded by a stone wall and is accessed by a portalón with semicircular arch, is rectangular and a small chapel outside. Not open to the public. In addition to the above listed pazos are the following, which are of minor note: Pazo of Lamaquebrada in Fión, Pazo de Casadonas in Licin, Pazo de Fraguas in Louredo, Casa Grande Mosiños, etc. None of which are open to the public. There are several churches of note. All are in the Romanesque style of architecture. The most important is Santo Estevo de Ribas de Miño. This monastery was constructed in the 12th century. It is said the same stonemason (Master Mateo) that designed the Portico da Gloria for the Cathedral in Santiago de Compostela designed this building too, but there is no basis for this tradition. The main door does resemble the Portico, but in a smaller version, with artistic connections to the portals of San Xoan de Portomarin and the cathedral of Ourense. The unusual western crypt is also said to resemble the one in Santiago. The living quarters and cloisters no longer remain. The Church has the largest Rosaton (round) window in Spain. After the decay of some parts of the monastery the stones were used to build village houses. The church is still used today for wedding, funerals, baptisms and mass. Nearby is the Romanesque church of the village of Diomondi. It is dedicated to San Pelayo, and an inscription of 1170 on the interior of the tympanum of the west portal dates the setting of the lintel. The sculptural decoration at Diomondi is related to Lugo Cathedral, and the same masons worked at San Pedro de Portomarin where a faded inscription on the west tympanum records the date of 1182 for the church's consecration.D'Emilio (2007) p. 22 The only building of military architecture is the tower Candaira in Rebordaos, is the thirteenth century with a square of 9.81 by 9.94 metres, consists of three floors, the upper floor is the battlements. The original owner of the tower was Don Francisco de Quiroga Taboada Garza and Alvarez de Castro. Not open to the public.

It publishes articles and student-written notes that propose legal reforms. These reforms can occur in one of three ways: (1) changing the actual text of laws; (2) changing the enforcement of laws; or (3) changing the interpretation of laws. Periodically, the journal hosts symposia where academics and policymakers discuss legal reform. Past symposia have focused on topics such as media regulation, market-oriented welfare reform, managed care reform, jury reform, and Title IX reform. History The University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform was established in 1968 under the name Prospectus: A Journal of Law Reform. It was originally conceptualized as a faculty edited journal. Before the publication of the first issue, the untimely death of Frank E. Cooper, the first faculty editor, transformed the journal into a wholly student-run journal.Francis A. Allen, On Coming of Age: Twenty-Five Years of the University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform, 25 U. Mich. J.L. Reform 1 (1991). Then-Dean Francis A. Allen authored the first article. In this Prospectus for Reform, he set two goals for the journal: \\"to report efforts to improve the law and its administration and to stimulate thought and ... action to this end,\\"Francis A. Allen, A Prospectus for Reform, 1 Prospectus 1, 2 (1968). and \\"to enlarge the opportunities for law journal experience of students at the University of Michigan Law School.\\"Id. at 3. Starting with its fourth volume in 1971, the journal obtained its current name. David L. Callies served as the first managing editor. A year later, Ronald B. Schram became the first editor-in-chief. The first woman to serve as editor-in-chief was Margaret L. Houy. The current editor-in-chief is Patrick Andrew Thronson.  Selection  The University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform uses a competitive process that takes into account an applicant's writing sample, résumé, personal statement, and performance on a citation editing exercise. Applicants are also required to identify an area of law in need of reform that could serve as the basis for a note. The journal selects between 46 and 50 editors annually from the incoming second-year law school class.

Some pedalboards contain their own transformer and power cables to power multiple pedals. Pedalboards help the player manage multiple pedals. The entire pedalboard can be packed up and transported to the next location without disassembly. Pedalboards often have a cover that protects the effects pedals during transportation. There are many varieties of pedalboard cases, including homemade do it yourself pedalboard cases, store-bought pedalboard cases, and custom-made pedalboard cases. Hard shell pedalboard-cases have foam padding, reinforced corners, and locking latches. During performance, with the lid removed, the bottom of the case is a pedalboard. Most pedalboards have a flat surface where pedals and their power supplies attach using hook-and-loop fasteners or other techniques, and often have a removable lid or padding to protect the pedals when not in use. Some pedalboards have handles or wheels to facilitate transportation. Fig. 1: This picture of a custom-made wooden pedalboard shows the \\"audience\\" view of a pedalboard, with the pedals arrayed towards the bassist. Pedal power supply Most effects pedals are powered by varying levels of DC voltage, depending on the manufacturer. Possible voltages include 9V, 12V, 15V, 18V, 24V, and 40V, though 9V is most common. Some effects pedals accept a range of voltages, producing different effects. Guitar players can experiment with varying voltages to generate different sounds. DC power can be generated by batteries, an AC/DC power supply, or a rechargeable battery. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages. Using individual batteries is fine for occasional players, because they don't have to worry about the cost of replacement batteries or changes in sound as batteries get tired. Battery life varies depending on the pedal's power draw. Professional players normally replace all batteries with new ones before a show. A DC power supply is a good alternative, though the initial cost is higher. However, one must pay attention to ground loops and power line hum. Noise gates can help to reduce the noise by suppressing the signal below a certain volume threshold, but this only controls unwanted noise without actually removing it from the signal. Fig. 2: A metal pedalboard with wheels using a single rechargeable effects pedal battery The third approach is to use a powerful rechargeable battery to drive all the pedals, and a battery charger to recharge the battery. This eliminates ground loops because the pedals are grounded at a single point: the amplifier. There are batteries on the market that can power over 20 effects pedals for eight hours on a single charge. The effects pedals are connected to the rechargeable battery via isolated DC-DC converters, which produce the required voltages. Using a rechargeable effects pedal battery or AC/DC power supply in conjunction with a “pedalboard suitcase” reduces setup time prior to a show.

Both the magazine's name (Chimurenga is a Shona word that loosely translates as \\"liberation struggle\\") and the content capture the connection between African cultures and politics on the continent and beyond.  History  Chimurenga was launched in 2002 as a magazine promoted by Kalakuta Trust and founded by Ntone Edjabe. It is based in Cape Town, South Africa, but its network is international. Chimurenga focuses on Africa and its diaspora, aiming at capturing the connection between African cultures and politics on the continent and beyond. Chimurenga gradually began developing a series of publications, events (called Chimurenga Sessions) and specific projects. = Notability = Chimurenga is reviewed by newspapers and magazines and it is presented inside conferences, events and exhibitions. In 2007, it was part of the Documenta magazine project within Documenta exhibition in Kassel; in 2008 it was reviewed by an article of The New York Times.Rachel Donadio, The Empire Writes Back in The New York Times, 07/07/2008. Its director Ntone Edjabe talks about the magazine and its approach during numerous interviews and conferences also at the Centre Pompidou in Paris and the Art Academy in Berlin in 2005, at the Dakar Biennale in 2006 and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2009.

Activities  In addition to its magazine, Chimurenga produces other publications, events and specific projects. = Magazine = The first issue of Chimurenga magazine was published in April 2002. Each issue has a specific theme. Initially a quarterly, Chimurenga now appears approximately three times a year. Interrogating the superficial has always been the core agenda of the publication. The various renegades are captured in a series of profiles \\"thinking out loud\\". Chimurenga shies away from the Q&A; format and includes deconstructed and imagined interviews, surreal short stories and poetry and other devices that challenge strict notions of fact and fiction. Covers are equally indicative of the orientation of a journal which is at once theoretical, erotic, and provocative. One cover featured the words of \\"Strange Fruit\\", the song about Southern lynchings that Billie Holiday immortalised. Another featured Neo Muyanga's portrait of Steve Biko's bruised face. The first edition showed Peter Tosh at a gig in Swaziland in the early 1980s, pointing an AK-47-shaped guitar in the direction of South Africa and chanting down Babylon. Chimurenga orients itself not only to radical people that form its immediate target group, but also to the lay reader. It is distributed in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Kenya, Swaziland, Botswana and Ghana. Its distribution has seen it read on campuses in Germany, the United States, Great Britain and France.

The algorithm negotiates introduced in 1997 M6, with the modified key length, which is enlarged to 64 bits or more. This cipher operates with Feistel network and designed to reach high performance on small implementation or 32 bits devices. For instance, by using round numbers = 10 it present encryption speed at 32 Mbps for dedicated hardware of 6K gates and 25 MHz clock or 208 Mbps for program, that uses C-language and Pentium-I 266 MHz. Due to the openness of description, it should not be used in open or multivendor software. Structure of algorithm File:Structure_of_M8_cipher.png =Basic structure= The structural characteristics are that the cipher is based on substitution-permutation block like DES. There are 3 kinds of calculations: 32-bit circular rotation, addition in modulus 232 and 32 bits-wise XOR. Actual function may be different each round. Key is used to be calculated using its value and that defines actual function each round. After decision process, which is using round number, decision and expansion keys, the algorithm gets basic function (e π) or (d π). Then it is used either by key scheduler (which also takes 256 key expansion key and 64 bits data key), that products 256 bits execution key, and encryption/decryption block. Algorithm decision key is consist of 24 bits. First 9 bits determine calculations: 0 means addition in 232modulus, 1 means bit-wise XOR. Other 3 blocks for 5 bits define left circular rotations. Algorithm expansion key concludes 3 blocks for 32bits, which determine α,β and γ. The difference between basic function is only in the order of permutations: (e π) does it in the end, (d π) - at the beginning of calculation block. =Structure of basic functions= The structure has 9 blocks of calculations and 3 optionally blocks of left circle rotations. It has a 64-bit block size and also 64-bit key length. It is Feistel cipher with S-blocks, that are dependent on large execution key. At the start, there is permutation for (d π). Then algorithm takes the first block of plaintext and makes calculation 1 using KL, then it optionally does rotation and goes to calculation 2. The it repeats, but there is α instead of KL. Then it uses β for doing cal. 5. Then algorithm does calculations and rotation, described earlier, but using KR. Further, it is used γ to do calc.8 and obtained result calculates with the other block of plaintext. In conclusion, algorithm permutates blocks. For the (e π) it is the same, excluding the order of permutation and calculations of blocks. =Key schedule= The execution key obtains from 256-bit key expansion key, which divides into 2 identical set of four 64-bit blocks K0–K3, and 64 bit of data key. Every block of key expansion key is used to calculate with 32 bit of data key by (e Π [0-7]) and gives eight 32-bit blocks of expansion key on the output. =Encryption= Obtained expansion key divides into 4 pair block of 32-bit. This block divides into 32 bits of left and right range it is used to do calculations with 64-bit plaintext blocks using 4 subsequent steps. Then obtained ciphertext encrypts again using the same pairs of block of expansion key and the same steps round times. =Decryption= To decrypt cipher text it is enough to do the same operation, but using the another basic function. Modes of operation As determined in ISO 8372 or ISO/IEC 101116 there are 4 applicable modes: #Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode #*The simplest encryption mode. Using this plaintext divides into blocks, which encrypts separately. The disadvantage of this method is the lack of diffusion. It means that data hides not enough well and it is not recommended to use for cryptographic protocols at all. #Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode #*In this mode each block of plaintext is XORed with the previous before being encrypted. Every block will depend on all previous blocks and it should be used initialization vector in the first block to make each message unique. #Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode #*This mode mode, a close relative of CBC, makes a block cipher into a self-synchronizing stream cipher. Operation is very similar; in particular, CFB decryption is almost identical to CBC encryption performed in reverse. #Output Feedback (OFB) mode #*This mode makes a block cipher into a synchronous stream cipher. It generates keystream blocks, which are then XORed with the plaintext blocks to get the ciphertext. Just as with other stream ciphers, flipping a bit in the ciphertext produces a flipped bit in the plaintext at the same location. This property allows many error correcting codes to function normally even when applied before encryption. Because of the symmetry of the XOR operation, encryption and decryption are exactly the same. Cryptoanalysis *In M8 key determines both calculation objects and round numbers. If a hostile person knows the structure of every round, it will be possible to evaluate M8 by using conventional methods. With the estimate of Hitachi, there is possibility that if it has less than 10 rounds, it will be easier to encrypt M8 than DES. Therefore it is recommended to use >10 rounds. The cryptographic strength increases as the number of rounds are growing, but it is necessary to remember, that the speed of encryption will decrease inversely as round numbers. If the structure of rounds are not known, there is only the way to do exhaustive search, which will be non-effective due to a huge number of round function variations. Summary, it is needed to trade-off between speed and safety of the algorithm. *Like an M6, it is sensitive to mod n cryptanalysis, which was suggested in 1999 by John Kelsey, Bruce Schneier, and David Wagner. It is a form of partitioning cryptanalysis that exploits unevenness in how the cipher operates over equivalence classes (congruence classes) modulo n. These attacks used the properties of binary addition and bit rotation modulo a Fermat prime. One known plaintext allows recovering the key with about 235 trial encryptions; \\"a few dozen\\" known plaintexts reduces this to about 231. *Because it has weak key schedule, M8 is subject to decryption to a slide attack, which requires less known plaintext than mod n cryptanalysis, but less calculations. Lets assume that cipher has n bits and uses key scheduler, which consist K1-KM as keys of any length. This encryption method breaks up into identical permutation functions F of cipher. This functions may consist of more than 1 round of cipher, it is defined by key-schedule. For example, if cipher uses alternating key-schedule, which switches between K1 and K2, there are 2 rounds into F. Every Ki will appear at least once. Depending of characteristics of cipher, next step will collect 2n/2 pairs of plaintext and ciphertext. By the birthday paradox, it should not be required to collect more than this number. Theh these pairs, which are denoted as (P,C), are used to find \\"slid\\" pairs, which are denoted as (P0,C0)(P1,C1). Every \\"slid\\" pair has the property P0=F(P1) and C0=F(C1). \\"Slid\\" pair get its name because it \\"slid\\" over one encryption. It can be imagined like result of applying one time function F. Once this pair is identified, the key can be easily extracted from this pairing, and the cipher is broken because of vulnerability to known-plaintext attacks. The process of finding a slid pair can be different but follows the same basic scheme.One uses the fact that it is relatively easy to extract the key from just one iteration of F. Choose any pair ofplaintext-ciphertext pairs, (P_0,C_0) (P_1,C_1) and check to see what the keys corresponding to P_0 = F(P_1) and C_0 = F(C_1) are. If these keys match, this is a slid pair; otherwise move on to the next pair. With 2^{n/2} plaintext-ciphertext one slid pair is expected. The number of false-positives depends on structure of the algorithm. False-positives can be reduced by applying keys to different message-cipherkey pair, because it is very low possibility for a good cipher, that the wrong key can correctly encrypt >2 messages. Sometimes the structure of the cipher greatly reduces the number of plaintext- ciphertext pairs needed, and thus also a large amount of the work. The clearest of these examples is the Feistel cipher using a cyclic key schedule.The reason for this is given a P = (L_0,R_0) the search is for a P_0=(R_0, L_0 \\\\bigoplus F(R_0,K)). This reduces the possible paired messages from 2^n down to 2^{n/2} (since half the message is fixed) and so at most 2^{n/4} plaintext-ciphertext pairs are needed in order to find a slid pair.

The Turlock Basin makes up 542 square miles (347,000 acres) of this total. This aquifer is located within Merced and Stanislaus counties in the Central Valley bounded by the Tuolumne River to the north, the Merced River to the south and San Joaquin River to the west. The Sierra Nevada foothills bound the sub-basin to the east. Groundwater in the San Joaquin Valley occurs mostly in younger alluvial material. The Turlock Basin lies to the east of the city of Turlock. Groundwater in the Turlock Basin occurs in older alluvial deposits. Large portions of the San Joaquin Basin have experienced overdraft of water and infiltration of agricultural water pollutants, resulting in poor water quality.Earth Metrics Inc., Environmental Screening Analysis for the Tylly Road Property, Turlock, California, March 1989 Land use and water quality The primary land use overlying the Turlock Basin is crop production with more than 250,000 acres used for irrigated crops. From 1952 to 2006, urbanized areas have increased from 4000 to 20000 acres, mostly in the Turlock Irrigation District. Potential areas of concern: * In 2006, 39 of 513 wells tested above the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for various contaminants such as nitrates, pesticides and volatile organic carbons (VOCs). * A study published in 2016 by engineering firm Todd Groundwater showed dropping groundwater levels in 38 wells over a 40-year period (1971-2011). The City of Turlock receives its entire water supply for domestic use from groundwater. The character of the water is generally a sodium sulfate type,State of California Department of Water Resources, 1975 and some local wells have been historically closed due to DBCP pesticide poisoning. In testing the ground water contents there was found to be 120 contaminants. In an area that relies on groundwater for essential needs it greatly diminishes the supply with contaminants present. The main contaminants we see are arsenic and nitrates. Arsenic is present naturally however the assessments done show in the 2014 study shows the contamination of Arsenic with a level of 11.8 ppb in the drinking water. From agriculture, fertilization, and increased urbanization we have also seen increased levels of nitrates. The nitrates are at 45 mg/L and pose a direst health risk. Nitrates in water can cause increased infant illness and death. The main water source is being contaminated by man, and is in return harming man with toxins in the ground water consumed. Basin management organization The Turlock Groundwater Management Plan is identified as: # Maintain an adequate water level in the groundwater basin. # Protect groundwater quality and implement measures, where feasible, to reduce the potential movement of existing contaminants. # Monitor groundwater extraction to reduce the potential for land subsidence. # Promote conjunctive use of groundwater and surface waters. # Support and encourage water conservation. # Develop and support alternate water supplies, and educate users on the benefits of water recycling. # Continue coordination and cooperation between the TGBA members and customers.

Description  The author coins the term \\"collective joy\\" to describe group events which involve music, synchronized movement, costumes, and a feeling of loss of self. There is no precise word in English to describe the phenomenon. The book describes cycles of creation and suppression of collective joy events. The events generally arise spontaneously and are regarded as dangerous (see Collective hysteria, Riot). The powerful elements of society gradually convert the participants into spectators. This conversion drains the events of their power, and the cycle begins anew. The author describes Western Society as particularly lacking in such events and describes current and recent examples of Collective Joy events.  Well-known examples of Collective Joy  = Historical = * Woodstock Festival = Current = * Brazilian Carnival and Mardi Gras * Burning Man: Possibly the best modern example of collective joy, this event erases social boundaries, encourages participation as a near-religious experience, and has no basis in a historical or religious festival. * Rock concerts and raves: The most familiar example of collective joy to most Americans. The term especially applies to Grateful Dead concerts. * Love Parade: costumed dancers and electronic music festival held in many cities around the world.  Collective Joy in transition  * Sports fans: The author contends that group movement like \\"the wave\\" and costuming (body paint, team colors) represent an attempt by participants to wrest the spectator nature of professional sports back into the realm of collective joy, by making fans active participants in the team events. * Halloween: In the past three decades, Halloween has transitioned from a children's holiday to an adult holiday, including street fairs in major cities such as New York's Village Halloween Parade and San Francisco's Castro District.

Family and early life Shaw's parents were Louis Agassiz Shaw Sr. and Mary Elizabeth Saltonstall. Both parents came from wealthy and politically influential Boston Brahmin families with roots extending back to the Mayflower. The couple's elder son was Quincy Adams Shaw III (born May 21, 1885). Louis Sr. died at home in Chestnut Hill from tuberculosis when Louis Jr. was only four years old on July 2, 1891. Shaw's father was born at 26 Mount Vernon Street in Beacon Hill in 1861, and the following year the family moved to Jamaica Plain. He attended George Washington Copp Noble School in Boston, and graduated from Harvard University in 1884. He married Mary Elizabeth Saltonstall on June 30, 1884 in Newton, right after the graduation ceremony. Shaw's uncle Robert Gould Shaw II was the first husband of Nancy Witcher Langhorne. She later married Waldorf Astor, the eldest son of William Waldorf Astor and Mary Dahlgren Paul of the Astor family. Shaw's paternal grandparents were Quincy Adams Shaw (one of the richest men in Massachusetts through his investment in the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company) and Pauline Agassiz. Shaw's great grandfather, for whom he was named, was Louis Agassiz, noted professor of zoology at Harvard University. Another of Shaw's great grandfathers was Leverett Saltonstall I, a member of the United States House of Representatives. Shaw married Joanne Bird of East Walpole on June 14, 1910. The couple had two children, Joanne Bird Shaw (born March 31, 1911) and Pauline Agassiz Shaw (November 4, 1915 — October 30, 1992). Education Louis Jr. followed his father's educational footsteps, first attending the George Washington Copp Noble School (which had been renamed the Noble and Greenough School in 1892) and later attending Harvard University, graduating in 1909. Shaw's cousin Leverett Saltonstall also pursued the same academic path. Shaw continued to study for a couple of years after graduation, taking classes in botany, geology, and zoology. He contracted tuberculosis in the summer of 1911, and was consequently unable to work until the spring of 1913. Career An Emerson iron lung. The patient lies within the chamber, which when sealed provides an oscillating atmospheric pressure. This particular machine was donated to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Museum by the family of polio patient Barton Hebert of Covington, Louisiana, who had used the device from the late 1950s until his death in 2003. Beginning in 1914, his research focused exclusively on physiology. Shaw and his family moved into the brownstone building located at 6 Marlborough Street in the Back Bay in 1917, having acquired the property upon the death of his grandmother, Pauline Agassiz Shaw. The building had a long history, having served as a private day school (18851893), later as headquarters of the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association (19041915), and then as headquarters of the Women's Municipal League of Boston (19151917).Boston Architecture: 6 Marlborough Street From late 1917 until early 1919, Shaw and his research team conducted investigations in his home laboratory on the physiological effects of poisonous gases and other problems related to the ongoing war in Europe. In the spring of 1919, he joined the faculty at the Harvard-MIT School for Health Officers in the department of industrial hygiene. The Harvard-MIT School for Health Officers was a joint venture between Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that began in 1913. The joint venture ended in 1922, when the Harvard School of Public Health was formally established. Shaw and his family continued to live at 6 Marlborough Street at least until 1927. Shaw was a member of the Tennis and Racquet Club, located on Boylston Street not far from his house. In that year, Shaw was arrested for the distillation of alcohol, which was illegal in the United States during Prohibition, in effect from 1920 to 1933. Shortly after that event, the house was demolished and replaced by a five-story, 21-unit apartment house. Shaw was an instructor in physiology at the Harvard School of Public Health, where he is credited in 1928 along with Philip Drinker (1894–1972, associate professor of industrial hygiene) and his brother Cecil Kent Drinker (1887–1956, later dean of the Harvard School of Public Health) for inventing the first widely used iron lung. The machine was powered by an electric motor with air pumps from two vacuum cleaners. The air pumps changed the pressure inside a rectangular, airtight metal box, pulling air in and out of the lungs.

It was released on August 29, 2000, through Roc-A-Fella, Columbia, and Sony Music. Jay-Z, Damon Dash, and Amil served as executive producer with a team of producers that included Just Blaze. Before the album's release, Amil was best known for her feature on Jay-Z's 1998 single \\"Can I Get A...\\". She was one of several up-and-coming artists signed to Roc-A-Fella, alongside Memphis Bleek and Beanie Sigel, who released an album in 2000. Although it was her only album on Roc-A-Fella, Amil had been closely associated with the label and its cofounder Jay-Z, earning the moniker \\"First Lady of Roc-A-Fella\\". A hip hop album, the lyrics of All Money Is Legal focus on wealth and, to a lesser degree, Amil's personal life. It was recorded at Playground Studios in Los Angeles and at The Cutting Room, The Hit Factory, and Quad Studios in New York City. Future spouses Jay-Z and Beyoncé met for the first time during these recording sessions. Although Jay-Z had written Amil's verses for their past collaborations, she wrote her own lyrics for all the album's tracks. Amil mostly raps throughout the album, but sings on some tracks. According to academic commentators and music critics, Amil adopted the persona of a \\"gold digger\\" throughout the album. Reviews were mixed, the production and Amil's verses dividing critics. The album peaked at number 45 on the US Billboard 200 chart. Two singles – \\"I Got That\\" with vocals from Beyoncé and \\"4 da Fam\\" with verses from Memphis Bleek, Beanie Sigel, and Jay-Z – were released from the album and promoted with music videos. \\"I Got That\\" reached number one on the Bubbling Under R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles Billboard chart, and \\"4 da Fam\\" charted on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs. Shortly after the release of All Money Is Legal, Amil was dropped from the Roc-A-Fella roster. Rumors circulated within the industry that her departure stemmed from personal conflict with Jay-Z. Years later, she publicly denied the rumors and said she had left because she was unable to handle industry pressures and wanted to have more time to care for her child. Although her music career continued, Amil did not sign to another major label and she dropped out of the commercial mainstream of hip hop.  Background and recording  In 1997, Amil formed the girl group Major Coins with Liz Leite and Monique. Amil was not interested in being a solo artist at the time and was uncertain about pursuing a career as a rapper, and later said, \\"I never looked at it as going beyond me being known in the streets.\\" When Jay-Z asked Leite to provide vocals for \\"It's Like That\\" from his third studio album Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life (1998), Amil accompanied her to the recording studio. Jay-Z asked Amil to freestyle during the sessions, and her vocals were featured on the album single \\"Can I Get A...\\". He later encouraged her to become a solo artist. alt=A black-and-white photograph of Jay-Z After Major Coins disbanded, Jay-Z signed Amil to Roc-A-Fella in 1998. She was one of several new artists signed to the label, and she became a high-profile member of the label and received the nicknames \\"Diana Ross\\" and \\"the First Lady of Roc-A-Fella\\". According to a 2015 Fact article, Amil's signing to the label became the subject of industry gossip. She denied reports of a pregnancy involving a married man and a romantic relationship with Jay-Z. Foxy Brown accused Jay-Z of using Amil to try to create a new artist similar to herself.Brown (2005): 64 In a 2003 interview, he denied these claims and said he stopped working with Brown in favor of Amil because the two women frequently fought on tour.Brown (2005): 66 Before the release of her debut album, Amil featured on albums by Mariah Carey, Jermaine Dupri, Tamar Braxton, and Funkmaster Flex. She collaborated again with Jay-Z for the 1999 singles \\"Nigga What, Nigga Who (Originator 99)\\" and \\"Do It Again (Put Ya Hands Up)\\" and the 2000 song \\"Hey Papi\\". Jay-Z wrote all of Amil's verses for these collaborations. She also performed on his Hard Knock Life tour. Amil, who became known as one of Jay-Z's protégés, described her work with him as \\"a natural thing\\" and \\"always smooth\\". As she told Vibe in 2000, \\"[He] just put this career in my hands. I went from having nothing at all to wearing diamonds.\\" The same year, she appeared in a Sprite advertisement campaign alongside Roxanne Shante, Mia X, Angie Martinez, and Eve; they are referred to as the Five Deadly Women, a reference to the 1978 film Five Deadly Venoms. She also played a lead character, Tanya, in the 2000 direct-to-video film Get Down or Lay Down; it was distributed through a joint deal with Roc-A-Fella and Miramax. Amil was also the only prominent female in the 2000 documentary Backstage. All Money Is Legal was recorded at The Cutting Room, The Hit Factory, and Quad Studios in New York City, and Playground Studios in Los Angeles. Amil, Jay-Z, and Damon Dash were the album's executive producers. It was one of several albums from up-and-coming artists at Roc-A-Fella to be released in 2000, along with Memphis Bleek's The Understanding and Beanie Sigel's The Truth. Amil has co-writing credits on all the album's songs, and Jay-Z said she had a \\"talent for song-making\\". To be taken seriously as a solo artist by \\"naysayers who say Jay is her puppeteer\\", Amil said: \\"I kept this album me — nothing more, nothing less.\\" She said she wanted to avoid sexual topics on All Money Is Legal and had planned not to use any profanity in her future music, explaining: \\"I know I sin, but I'm trying to become a better person.\\" Producer Just Blaze contributed to All Money Is Legal, and felt his work on the album raised his profile within Roc-A-Fella. Beyoncé recorded her guest vocals for \\"I Got That\\" in 2000 in a separate recording session. Her then-manager Mathew Knowles paid Roc-A-Fella for the featured spot as a way to assess her viability as a solo artist, since she was still a part of Destiny's Child at the time. As a result of this collaboration, Beyoncé met her future husband Jay-Z for the first time.Taraborrelli (2015): p. 264  Composition and lyrics  All Money Is Legal is a hip hop album with 13 tracks. Alongside Just Blaze, the album's production team included Tyrone Fyffe, Jon-John Robinson, LES, Poke & Tone, Rockwilder, EZ Elpee, Chavon Henry, Sean Lashley, K-Rob, Jay Garfield, Lofey, and Omen. David Browne, writing for Entertainment Weekly, described its compositions as having \\"low slung beats and [an] uncluttered vibe\\" similar to Jay-Z's music from that era, and the Dayton Daily News' Talia Jackson said the album had his signature funk samples and R&B; choruses. Lyrically, the songs on All Money Is Legal focus mainly on material possessions and money, as evidenced by the album title. Some tracks touch on more personal issues, specifically \\"Smile 4 Me\\" and \\"Quarrels\\". The New York Daily News' Jim Farber wrote that Amil was more personal in her music than Foxy Brown and Lil' Kim, whom he described as \\"sexy cartoons\\". Amil raps most of her vocals on the album, but also sings on several tracks like \\"Get Down\\". Critics have referred to Amil's rapping style as sing songy, and Farber said she \\"specializes in short, jabbing melodies\\". The opening track \\"Smile 4 Me\\" was inspired by Amil's life, and includes the lyrics: \\"Got my people up north trying to slice the bid / While I'm in love with a nigga with a wife and a kid.\\" On \\"Smile 4 Me\\", Amil retells aspects of her life before her music career, such as living on welfare and shoplifting. The second song, \\"I Got That\\", features Beyoncé on its chorus and encourages women to become more independent. Commentators compared the song to music released by Destiny's Child, and a Spin writer said it continues the \\"statement[s] of simple financial and romantic independence\\" found throughout Beyoncé's discography. Amil references Satan as being at the root of all business in the bass-heavy track \\"Quarrels\\", which has additional vocals by R&B; singer Thomas. Other critics interpreted the song as being about an unhealthy relationship. In \\"Girlfriend\\", she worries about infidelity after taking a woman's boyfriend, and raps about the shame of going \\"from Gucci sandals back to no-name brands\\" on \\"Anyday\\". Amil's lyrics on All Money Is Legal have been cited as an example of the theme of \\"gold digging\\" in hip hop performed by women. In a 2003 academic paper, women's studies professor Layli D. Phillips and social psychology professor Dionne P. Stephens cited Amil and All Money Is Legal as part of a trend of female hip hop artists performing the stereotypical role of a \\"Gold Digger\\". Along with the \\"Freak\\", \\"Diva\\", and \\"Dyke\\", Phillips and Stephens named the \\"Gold Digger\\" as one of the major archetypes adopted by female rappers, defining the role with the following terms: They highlighted the lyric \\"You know I gotta keep tricks up the sleeve, leav' em bankrupt with blue balls till the dick bleed\\" from the title track \\"All Money is Legal (A.M.I.L.)\\" as an example of the Gold Digger persona in Amil's music. Vibe's Andréa Duncan wrote that Amil used the album to balance her onstage persona as a gold digger with her more mellow personality in her personal life. Len Righi, writing for The Morning Call, described Amil's style as \\"golddigger rap\\", but noted the album contained songs that were \\"not all diamonds and major coins\\". All Money Is Legal includes three features from Jay-Z. Amil and Jay-Z rap about materialism on \\"Heard It All\\", which features the pair attempting to scam one another. He also contributed to \\"That's Right\\" after hearing Just Blaze's production during a recording session. His final appearance is the album closer \\"4 da Fam\\", also featuring Memphis Bleek and Beanie Sigel. For his verse in \\"4 da Fam\\", Jay-Z rapped about expecting a child: \\"I got four nephews and they're all writing ... and I'm having a child, which is more frightening.\\" A column in Vibe interpreted the line as a pregnancy announcement from Jay-Z, who was an uncommitted bachelor at the time. In a 2000 statement to the New York Daily News, Jay-Z denied these reports. He had his first child, Blue Ivy, with Beyoncé in January 2012.  Release and promotion  alt=A picture of Beyoncé sitting on a box \\"I Got That\\" was released on July 5, 2000, as the album's lead single. The music video for \\"I Got That\\" appeared on the list of BET's most-played clips for the weeks of August 1 and 8, 2000. The video also played on The Box—a now-defunct music video network—during the same two weeks. Kathy Iandoli of Dazed praised \\"I Got That\\" as a showcase for Amil's potential as a rapper. Conversely, Vibe named the song among the year's worst artistic pairings in hip hop for its Beyoncé feature. \\"I Got That\\" reached number one on the Bubbling Under R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles Billboard chart on September 16. Beyoncé's vocals have been applauded retrospectively; Andrew Unterberger at Spin said the song \\"deserved better, and Bey's breathy chorus is a big reason why\\", and Iandoli said that \\"Beyoncé did Amil the favor of her life\\" with her feature. All Money Is Legal was released through Roc-A-Fella, Columbia, and Sony Music on August 29, 2000, as a cassette, and CD. It was issued in both an \\"explicit\\" version with a Parental Advisory label and a \\"clean\\" version with edited lyrics. The album had originally been scheduled for a release in early August. With an acronym form matching the artist's name, All Money Is Legal is alternately titled A.M.I.L.: (All Money Is Legal). The album sold 29,000 copies in the first week of its release, and simultaneously debuted and peaked at number 45 on the US Billboard 200 chart. On the Billboard Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart, All Money Is Legal reached its peak position at number 12 on October 7, 2000, and was on the chart for a total of eight weeks. The second single, \\"4 da Fam\\", was released on July 29, 2000, and issued as a Double A-Side with \\"I Got That\\"; an accompanying \\"4 da Fam\\" music video had premiered earlier in the summer. For a 2017 Vulture article, John Kennedy had a lukewarm response to the song, calling it \\"a passable Roc-A-Fella posse cut that feels more like a team-building exercise\\". In a 2018 Complex article, Andrew Barber and Al Shipley considered \\"4 da Fam\\" to be \\"really a Jay record\\" despite being on Amil's album; they praised Jay-Z for having \\"the best verse and batt[ing] clean up\\". The song peaked at number 99 on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs Billboard chart and number 29 on the Hot Rap Songs Billboard chart. \\"That's Right\\" and \\"Get Down\\" were released on a 12-inch single and vinyl record as promotional singles.  Critical reception  The album received a mixed response from critics. In Vibe, Andréa Duncan praised it as a \\"surprisingly diverse and thoughtful collection of tracks\\". AllMusic's MacKenzie Wilson said Amil was \\"bold enough to make it solo\\" with her \\"New York childhood street smarts\\" and a \\"sultry sassiness\\" throughout the music. A reviewer for The Source commended the album as \\"a set that displays [Amil's] feminine flair\\". and Anthony M. Thompson for the San Antonio Express-News described it as having a \\"distinct, woman's touch\\". Despite criticizing All Money Is Legal as \\"unfortunately titled\\", Dan DeLuca said in The Philadelphia Inquirer that Amil's rapping abilities distinguished her from other female rappers and allowed her to stand out from the album's featured artists. In Entertainment Weekly, David Browne praised some of the lyrics—specifically, references to Aesop and Blake Carrington—but he dismissed the overall focus on money as unoriginal. Ta-Nehisi Coates, writing for the Washington City Paper, panned All Money Is Legal as \\"a schizophrenic work\\" with songs \\"swinging from aching honesty to gangsta-bitch schtick\\". Coates deemed the album \\"self-hating\\" and said Amil had \\"reduc[ed] herself to a prostitute with a microphone\\" with the sexually explicit lyrics. Several reviewers cited \\"Quarrels\\" and \\"Smile 4 Me\\" as album highlights. An anonymous review columnist in Billboard praised the autographical \\"Smile 4 Me\\" as \\"a testament to [Amil's] lyricism\\" and wrote that her verses in \\"Quarrels\\" on themes of morality would \\"make heads both nod and think\\". Despite an overall negative assessment of the album, Coates said Amil had successfully pulled from her past in \\"melancholy confessionals\\" like \\"Smile 4 Me\\". The Morning Call's Len Righi praised \\"Smile 4 Me\\" as the song that Amil best represents her \\"gritty self-assurance\\" and \\"fierce determination\\". Righi later named All Money Is Legal among the best albums of the year. A Vibe columnist identified \\"Quarrels\\", alongside Eve's 1999 single \\"Love Is Blind\\", as examples of \\"strong-willed, pro-woman songs\\" written and recorded by female rappers. Despite their criticism of Amil's album as inferior to her collaborations with Jay-Z, Soren Baker, writing for the Los Angeles Times, believed she demonstrated \\"promise when she becomes more personal in her storytelling\\". On the other hand, the Dayton Daily News' Talia Jackson criticized Amil as \\"less than believable when she is not rapping about her material world\\". In a 2014 Billboard interview, Amil said \\"Smile 4 Me\\" was one of her favorite songs from the album and that she generally preferred the songs drawn from her personal life. Retrospective assessments of All Money Is Legal have remained mixed. In a 2018 Rolling Stone article, Rob Sheffield praised Amil for releasing \\"her own kick-ass album with [an] excellent title\\" following her early collaboration with Jay-Z. In an article for PopMatters published about three years after the album's release, Terry Sawyer said Amil's music was generic and left only a \\"fleeting, shrugging impression\\". He unfavorably compared Amil to rapper Sarai, saying both had \\"virtually identical\\", \\"silken, imploded vocal styles\\". At Fact, Son Raw said Amil's voice made her music a \\"love-her-or-hate-her proposition\\", but highlighted \\"4 da Fam\\" as a \\"prime Roc La Familia-era posse cut\\". Complex also included All Money is Legal in a 2015 listicle on \\"factually incorrect\\" titles for hip hop albums because, in their words, \\"guess what, Amil, all money is not legal.\\"  Aftermath  alt=A picture of Amil in a gray zip-up jacket Amil was removed from the Roc-A-Fella roster shortly after the release of All Money Is Legal. After appearing in a music video alongside the rapper Baby (later known as Birdman), a February 2001 Vibe column speculated that she was likely to sign a record deal with Cash Money, the label he co-founded. But she never signed a deal with Cash Money, and—other than a select few releases—she largely dropped out of the mainstream, major-label recording industry. Music industry rumors attributed Amil's departure from Roc-A-Fella to personal conflict between her and Jay-Z, as well as his disapproval of her (reported) weight gain. During a 2011 interview with Vibe, she responded to the rumors about her and Jay-Z: Amil said she took a hiatus from her music career because she was mentally unprepared for the pressures of the industry and she wanted to take care of her child, who suffered from asthma. Describing herself as \\"rebell[ing] against the industry\\" after the album's release, she refused to do promotion for it and said: \\"I faded myself.\\" She said she regretted signing a record deal, preferring to be \\"an around the way rapper\\" and a songwriter instead. Jay-Z did not comment on Amil's departure from Roc-A-Fella at the time and, as of 2017, has still never publicly discussed why Amil was dropped from the label. However, Jay-Z did defend the quality of All Money Is Legal against its detractors in a 2013 appearance on the New York radio show The Breakfast Club. When DJ Envy asked Jay-Z who had been the \\"worst signing\\" at Roc-A-Fella, Charlamagne tha God interrupted to say \\"Amil!\\" and Jay-Z replied, \\"Nah, nah, I wouldn't say Amil. Amil's album, you should listen to it. It's good!\\"  Track listing  Credits adapted from the liner notes of All Money Is Legal.

Playing career Brown was born in Austrey, near Tamworth, England and started his career with the local Tamworth club, before joining Aston Villa in February 1898. He only made two first-team appearances for Villa in the 1900–01 season (in which he scored two goals) before moving (along with Tommy Bowman) to Southampton in May 1901. Brown was reputed to be the fastest sprinter in English football and was known as the \\"Tamworth Sprinter\\". His career at Southampton got off to a slow start, scoring only once in his first three games before injury forced him to miss three games in October/November 1901. On his return from injury, he started to score more freely and by Christmas he had scored seven goals. In his next game he doubled his tally for the season as he scored a club record seven goals in a match against Northampton Town at The Dell on 28 December 1901. His first goal came almost straight from the kick-off and within five minutes he had completed his hat trick. By half time Saints were 7–0 up, with Brown contributing four. He added three more in the second half as Saints completed the rout, winning 11–0 (the other goals came from Sam Meston (2), Fred Harrison and Archie Turner). He finished the 1901–02 season having scored 25 league goals from 25 games, as Saints ended the season in third place in the Southern League. He also made eight appearances in the FA Cup, scoring four times including Saints' goal in the replay of the final on 28 April 1902, as Saints went down 2–1 to Sheffield United. During the summer of 1902, he sustained a serious injury which lost him his place in the starting line-up to John Fraser. Brown only made one further appearance for Southampton, before being sold to Queens Park Rangers in October 1902. After two seasons with QPR, he moved on to Preston North End in May 1904 and then to Blackpool in March 1906, where he finished his career.

In the Finnish epic Kalevala, he is an ancient Finnish ruler. In Estonian mythology and Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald's epic poem Kalevipoeg, King Kalev was the father of King Kalevipoeg and the husband of Linda. History Some historians have suggested that the oldest known written reference to Kaleva (Kalev / Kalevi) can be found from the 6th or 7th century Anglo-Saxon poem Widsith, which became copied in the Exeter Book, a manuscript of Old English poetry compiled in the late 10th century. Widsith states: > Caesar ruled the Greeks, Caelic the Finns ... I was with the Greeks and > Finns and also with Caesar ... Some historians have interpreted the term \\"Caelic\\" in Widsith to refer to the ancient Finnish ruler Kaleva, discussed in the Finnish epic Kalevala. The first clear written mentioning of Kaleva appears in 1641 in the Leyen Spiegel by Heinrich Stahl. Lauri Honko, Religion, Myth, and Folklore in the World's Epics: The Kalevala and Its Predecessors, Published by Walter de Gruyter, 1990, The name of Estonia's national epic Kalevipoeg means \\"son of Kalev\\" and the name of Finnish national epic Kalevala means \\"Land of Kaleva\\". Some have suggested that Kalevala might be the Estonian mainland.Matti Kuusi and Pertti Anttonen. \\"Kalevala Lipas\\" (Finnish Literary Society, 1985). According to the 18th century Finnish folklore-collector Kristfrid Ganander, Kaleva had 12 sons in total, which included such renowned heroes as Väinämöinen, Ilmarinen and Hiisi. Myths In Estonian stories, sons of Kalev were originally considered royalty. In Finnish stories though, they are more often referred to as giants who built several castles and lived in various regions of Finland. In either case, they are often blamed for oddities in nature, such as strangely large or weird stones for instance. Myths tell that as more and more of the citizens became Christianized, their inhabitants began to hate Kaleva's sons for remaining pagans. Soon, Kaleva's sons were forced to leave their country, Kalevala. As time passed, Christians invaded more and more land, pushing Kaleva's sons further away. Eventually, Kaleva's sons found an island where they stayed and from where refused to leave. Christian priests then came and cursed them, until they took a big stone and sailed away with it. They have not been seen since then, but the legend has it that they often appear in the night time and destroy crops on the farm lands or cut down forests. According to the legend, almost the same type of visitations are done by the Hiisi people, who resemble trolls. They too were forced to flee by the Christians. Derived Finnish people called the star Sirius Kalevan tähti, Kaleva's star. Orion's Belt was called Kalevan miekka, Kaleva's sword, and swirls in the Milky Way Kalevan porras, Kaleva's step, or Kalevan kynnys, Kaleva's threshold. Legacy =In paintings= Oskar Kallis, an Estonian painter from the 1900s, produced the Kalevipoeg series of paintings portraying the epic heroic figure Kaleva/Kalevi/Kalev.

She was said by a reviewer to be 20 years old in September 2006 . is a Ukrainian singer and actress from the city of Burshtyn. Born and raised in Ukraine, the singer currently resides in Los Angeles, California. Childhood Newton found her own voice as a child growing up in the town of Burshtyn, in the western part of Ukraine. Mika taught herself to sing at an early age by imitating famous artists she heard on the radio. She began begging her mother to invite friends over so she could have an audience to perform in front of. \\"I didn't know if I wanted to be a singer, but I knew I loved performing,\\" says Mika. By age nine, she was entering regional voice competitions. This gave Mika her first taste of a real stage – and she wanted more. \\"I'm so honest on stage,\\" she says. \\"It's when I'm my true self. I think the more honest you are, the more people will connect with you, and that's when you can really make an impact.\\" It wasn't until she saw a video of Michael Jackson performing his international sensation, Earth Song that Mika decided to pursue her dream. \\"I didn't know who he was or where he was from, but the passion in his performance was inspiring,\\" she says. Mika quickly enrolled in performing arts school where she studied voice, piano, acting, dance and pantomime. She continued to compete in both local and international talent competitions, taking first place in nearly every one of them. At the age of 16, Mika moved from her hometown of Burshtyn to Kyiv, where she studied out of the Vocal Department at the College of Circus and Variety Arts. While attending a performing arts school as a teenager (where she studied voice, piano, acting, dance, and pantomime), she continued to compete in local and international talent contests, taking first place at nearly all of them, which led to attention from music industry players, at the age of 16 she got signed with the record label Falyosa Family Factory. Her first name, Mika, is a derivative from Mick Jagger's first name and Newton stands for a new tone. Besides making her way up in vocal career, Mika Newton is pursuing acting. She has already starred in two films – \\"Life By Surprise\\" and \\"Money For Daughter\\" where she played a supporting role and a lead role respectively. Eurovision 2011 Newton was originally chosen on February 26, 2011 to represent Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest 2011 in Düsseldorf, Germany among 43 other countries, with her entry \\"Angel\\". The Final of the national selection of participants from Ukraine for Eurovision song contest aired live on First National Television Channel. There were 19 participants.

Zlata Ognevich took the second place and Jamala took the third place. In the Eurovision final on 14 May 2011 Newton finished fourth with 159 points, behind the entries from Azerbaijan (the winner with 221 points), Italy and Sweden. During her performance, she was accompanied by sand-artist Kseniya Simonova who was the 2009 winner of Ukraine's Got Talent. Career Before Eurovision Song Contest, Mika went on to release two albums and, thanks to providing theme songs to a number of popular Ukrainian and Russian films and television shows, earned herself the nickname, the \\"Queen of Soundtracks.\\" It wasn't long before she drew interest from JK Music Group. They invited Mika to Los Angeles for a two-week recording session with legendary songwriter Walter Afanasieff, whose resume includes several Mariah Carey and Celine Dion hits. Mika also got the opportunity to perform in front of Grammy Award-winning producer Randy Jackson. \\"I could feel his [Randy's] energy, and knew right away he was something special,\\" she says. After winning 4th-place in Eurovision Song Contest 2011, Mika Newton signed a contract with JK Music Group and Randy Jackson's Friendship Collective. In June 2011 she moved to Los Angeles, where she started developing her music career as a pop-rock singer in the USA. Mika has since devoted herself entirely to her work. She spends most of her days either locked in the recording studio, practicing her English, or attending acting classes. Mika is strongly committed to charitable work. She frequents events at foster homes and juvenile detention centers and participates in auctions to benefit disadvantaged youth. \\"I feel I have a strong message for young people. I want to share my experiences and show them that yes, you can achieve your dreams if you're willing to work hard. Just don't ever quit.

Its English première by the Royal Court Theatre opened after the Dutch première, at the Ambassadors Theatre, in London, on 12 September 1996. Characters *Devlin *Rebecca \\"Both in their forties\\" (n. pag. [ii]). Setting \\"Time: Now\\" (n. pag. [ii]) Place: \\"A house in the country […] Early evening. Summer\\" (1). Synopsis The one-act play opens with Devlin and Rebecca, described as \\"Both in their forties\\", talking in what appears to be a home living room on an early summer evening. As the play develops, it becomes clear that Devlin and Rebecca are probably married, although their relationship to each other is not defined explicitly; it must be inferred. Initially, Devlin seems Rebecca's husband or lover, her therapist, and potentially her murderer. Some critics have described their discussion as more between a therapist and his patient than between two lovers or between a husband and a wife.Although many critics have observed this point, Merritt observes that Pinter, who sat in on rehearsals of the Roundabout production in early 1999, apparently approved the couple's wearing wedding bands on stage, noting also that Pinter deleted a reference to \\"husband\\" in one of his unpublished manuscripts of the play held in The Harold Pinter Archive in the British Library, in effect rendering that aspect of their marital relationship more ambiguous or at least less obvious (\\"Harold Pinter's Ashes to Ashes: Political/Personal Echoes of the Holocaust\\" 83n3). Merritt also points out, as many critics do, that, since the play was published in 1996 with a time period described as \\"Now\\" (1996 or later), Rebecca, being in her \\"forties\\", is too young to have been alive from the late 1930s through World War II (1945) and to have experienced firsthand such a Holocaust survivor's experience as the mother's experience that she has incorporated in her monologues (74–75). Devlin questions Rebecca in forceful ways, and she reveals personal information and dream-like sequences to him. In their first exchange, Rebecca tells of a man who appears to be sexually abusing her and threatening to strangle her (1–27). Rebecca tells Devlin that she told the killer, \\"Put your hand round my throat\\" (3)—an act which Devlin acts out directly towards the end of the play (73–75), asking Rebecca to \\"Speak. Say it. Say 'Put your hand round my throat.' \\" (75). The first exchange is followed immediately by Devlin asking \\"Do you feel you're being hypnotized?\\" \\"Who by?\\" asks Rebecca. \\"By me,\\" answers Devlin, adding \\"What do you think?\\", to which Rebecca retorts, \\"I think you're a fuckpig\\" (7–9). In response to Devlin's further inquiries about her \\"lover\\", Rebecca relates several dream-like sequences involving the man who she has quoted initially (7–27). She tells Devlin that this \\"lover\\" worked as a \\"guide\\" for a \\"travel agency\\" (19). She goes on to ask, \\"Did I ever tell you about that place . . . about the time he took me to that place?\\" This place turns out to be \\"a kind of factory\\" peopled by his \\"workpeople\\" who \\"respected his . . . purity, his . . . conviction\\" (23–25). But then she tells Devlin, \\"He used to go to the local railway station and walk down the platform and tear all the babies from the arms of their screaming mothers\\" (27). After a \\"Silence\\", Rebecca changes the subject abruptly with: \\"By the way, I'm terribly upset\\" (27). She complains that a police siren which she had just heard has disappeared into the distance. Devlin replies that the police are always busy, and thus another siren will start up at any time and \\"you can take comfort in that at least. Can't you? You'll never be lonely again. You'll never be without a police siren. I promise you\\" (29–30). Rebecca says that while the sound of the siren is \\"fading away,\\" she \\"knew it was becoming louder and louder for somebody else\\" (29) and while its doing so made her \\"feel insecure! Terribly insecure\\" (31), she hates the siren's \\"fading away; I hate it echoing away\\" (31). (At the end of the play, an \\"Echo\\" of her words occurs.) Rebecca tells Devlin that she had been writing a note, and that when she put the pen she was using down, it rolled off the table: > REBECCA: It rolled right off, onto the carpet. In front of my eyes. > DEVLIN: Good God. > REBECCA: This pen, this perfectly innocent pen. > DEVLIN: You can't know it was innocent. > REBECCA: Why not? > DEVLIN: Because you don't know where it had been. You don't know how many > other hands have held it, how many other hands have written with it, what > other people have been doing with it. You know nothing of its history. You > know nothing of its parents' history. > REBECCA: A pen has no parents. (33–39) In another monologue Rebecca describes herself looking out the window of a summer house and seeing a crowd of people being led by \\"guides\\" toward the ocean, which they disappear into like lemmings (47–49). That leads to her description of a condition that she calls \\"mental elephantiasis\\" (49), in which \\"when you spill an ounce of gravy, for example, it immediately expands and becomes a vast sea of gravy,\\" Rebecca says that \\"You are not the victim [of such an event], you are the cause of it\\" (51). Referring both to the \\"pen\\" and anticipating the references to \\"the bundle\\" later in the play, she explains, \\"Because it was you who spilt the gravy in the first place, it was you who handed over the bundle\\" (51). After an exchange about family matters relating to \\"Kim and the kids\\"—Rebecca's sister, Kim, Kim's children, and Kim's estranged husband (55–63), in which Rebecca may be conveying her own attitude toward Devlin in commenting on Kim's attitude toward her own husband—\\"She'll never have him back. Never. She says she'll never share a bed with him again. Never. Ever.\\" (61)—there is another \\"Silence\\" (65). Devlin says, \\"Now look, let's start again\\" (65). Rebecca tells Devlin, \\"I don't think we can start again. We started...a long time ago. We started. We can't start again. We can end again\\" (67). \\"But we've never ended,\\" Devlin protests (67). Rebecca responds, \\"Oh, we have. Again and again and again. And we can end again. And again and again. And again\\" (67). That exchange and Rebecca's reference to him earlier as a \\"fuckpig\\" demonstrate Rebecca's strong hostility toward Devlin. After another \\"Silence\\" and Rebecca's and Devlin's singing the refrain from song alluded to in the play's title \\" 'Ashes to ashes' – 'And dust to dust' – 'If the women don't get you' – 'The liquor must' \\" (69). After a \\"pause\\", Devlin says \\"I always knew you loved me. […] Because we like the same tunes\\", followed by another \\"Silence\\" (69). After it, Devlin asks Rebecca why she has never told him about \\"this lover of yours\\" and says how he has \\"a right to be very angry indeed\\" that she did not, \\"Do you understand that?\\" (69–70). After another \\"Silence\\" (71), instead of responding, Rebecca describes another sequence, where she is standing at the top of a building and sees a man, a boy, and a woman with a child in her arms in a snowy street below (71–73). In her monologue, she shifts suddenly from the third-person \\"she\\" to the first-person \\"I\\", and Rebecca (not the woman) is \\"held\\" in Rebecca's own \\"arms\\": \\"I held her to me,\\" and she listens to its \\"heart […] beating\\" (73). At that point (73), Devlin approaches Rebecca and begins to enact the scene described by Rebecca at the beginning of the play, directing her to \\"Ask me to put my hand round your throat\\" as she has earlier described her \\"lover\\" as doing (73–75). The last scene of the play recalls cultural representations of Nazi soldiers selecting women and children at train stations en route to concentration camps (73–85). She begins by narrating the events in the third person: \\"She stood still. She kissed her baby. The baby was a girl\\" (73), but she switches from the third person to the first person in continuing her narrative. As this narration develops, an \\"Echo\\" repeats some of Rebecca's words as she recounts the experience of a woman who has walked onto a train platform with a \\"baby\\" wrapped up \\"in a bundle,\\" beginning with: \\"They took us to the trains\\" (\\"ECHO: the trains\\"), and \\"They were taking the babies away\\" (\\"ECHO: the babies away\\"), and then Rebecca shifts from using the third person \\"she\\" to using the first-person \\"I\\" (77): \\"I took my baby and wrapped it in my shawl\\" (77). Finally, Rebecca (or the woman or women with whom she has identified from such past historical events) is forced to give her baby wrapped in \\"the bundle\\" (\\"the bundle\\" being a synecdoche for the baby wrapped up in a shawl) to one of the men. As if Rebecca were such a woman, she recalls getting on the train, describing how \\"we arrived at this place\\"—thus recalling the other \\"place\\" about which she asks Devlin early in the play, the \\"factory\\": \\"Did I ever tell you about that place . . . about the time he [her purported lover] took me to that place?\\" (21). In the final lines of the play, as if the woman's experience were her own, Rebecca shifts again significantly from the third-person \\"she\\" used earlier relating to the woman to the first- person \\"I\\", while denying that she ever had or ever knew of \\"any baby\\": > REBECCA: And I said what baby > ECHO: what baby > REBECCA: I don't have a baby > ECHO: a baby > REBECCA: I don't know of any baby > ECHO: of any baby > Pause. > REBECCA: I don't know of any baby > Long silence. > BLACKOUT.

He won the English league championship in 1894–95 with Sunderland and the Scottish Football League championship with Celtic in 1895–96. He also played in the 1897 FA Cup Final for Everton and the 1900 FA Cup Final for Southampton, and made one appearance for Scotland in 1896. Football career Meechan was born in Broxburn, West Lothian, the son of a shale miner who had migrated from Donegal in Ireland. In his youth, he played amateur football for three local football clubs, Broxburn Emmett, Broxburn Shamrock and Broxburn F.C., before joining Hibernian in February 1892. In December 1891, Broxburn Shamrock played the holders of the Scottish Cup, Heart of Midlothian, in a sixth round tie. Despite being the team captain, Meechan refused to play in the match, won 5–4 by Hearts, because of a dispute over the \\"terms\\" under which he would play. In June 1893, he moved south of the border to join Sunderland for whom he made 60 appearances, scoring once, helping them to become Football League champions in 1894–95. While at Sunderland, he was the subject of a dispute in the West Lothian Courier, when a contributor challenged his right to register to vote at Broxburn, while living and working in England. In May 1895, Meechan returned to Scotland to join Celtic, helping them take the Scottish championship in 1895–96. In his time at Celtic, he made an appearance for the Scottish Football League against the Irish League on 15 February 1896, followed by his sole international appearance for Scotland, in a 3–3 draw with Ireland on 28 March 1896. His Celtic career ended on a controversial note when he, and two other players, refused to play a match against Hibernian in November 1896. Meechan together with John Divers and Barney Battles refused to play because of the presence at the stadium of a reporter who had heavily criticised Celtic following a Glasgow Cup defeat against Rangers the previous week. Following his \\"strike\\", Celtic suspended the three men, with Meechan and Divers being released. In January 1897, Meechan and Divers joined Everton, with Meechan helping them reach the final of the FA Cup in 1897, which was won 3–2 by Aston Villa. In his one and a half seasons with Everton, Meechan made a total of 28 appearances. In August 1898, Meechan moved to the south coast for a club record fee of £200, when he joined a Southampton team that was dominating the Southern League and contained a host of international and ex- First Division players. So good were they that they easily despatched three top flight clubs, including Meechan's former Everton teammates on their way to the 1900 Cup Final against Bury. On the day of the game Meechan, and his Scottish colleagues were angered by the selection of an out of form English forward, Jack Farrell, over the free scoring Roddy McLeod who had played brilliantly in the games leading up to the final. The English players wanted their forward in the team and got their way. The bitterness between the two camps showed on the field and led to a 4–0 defeat. Following the bitter dispute at Southampton, Meechan joined Manchester City in September 1900, for whom he made six appearances in the 1900–01 season. He made his City debut in a 2–1 win against Sheffield United.p287 He left Manchester at the end of the season to join Barrow in the Lancashire League for a season before re-joining Broxburn F.C. in March 1902. He then spent the 1903–04 season in the Scottish Second Division with Clyde before returning to his home town to play out his career with Broxburn Shamrock. Life after football In 1905, Meechan migrated to Nova Scotia in Canada, where he failed to find employment as a football coach and returned to mining. Meechan died in Port Morien in mid-1915, aged 43, with his wife, Annie Thompson, expecting their eighth child. The cause of his death was variously attributed to appendicitis or pneumonia brought about after spending a night in the snow looking for a missing relative, possibly aggravated by his work as a miner.

Early life Leiken was born in New York City in 1939. Leiken grew up in Great Neck, New York, where he attended public school through the tenth grade. He graduated from the Deerfield Academy. Education Leiken earned a B.A. from Harvard University in English, in 1961,\\"Robert S. Leiken\\". Contemporary Authors Online. Detroit: Gale, 2007.

He attended Oxford University in 1961-1962, and later completed a doctorate in politics there, at St Antony's College. In 2003 he was awarded the Bosch Berlin Prize in Public Policy by the American Academy in Berlin. Leiken was fluent in Spanish. He also studied French, German, Classical Greek and Latin. University teaching After receiving his M.A. from Harvard, Leiken served as an Acting Assistant Professor of Humanities at Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1968–1971. In 1971 he went to Mexico, where he served as a Professor of Economics at the National Agricultural University of Mexico (Universidad Nacional Agricola Autonoma de Chapingo) and also as a Professor of Economic History at the Center for Economic Research and Teaching. He also served as a Visiting Professor of Political Science at Boston College and as a Visiting Professor of Communications at Boston University. Community organizing =Mexico= In 1971 Leiken left the United States for Mexico, where he stayed until 1975 and returned from 1977–1980. In Cuernavaca he taught English at a labor union center called CEFESOM and political economy at a research university CIDOC. =Boston= Leiken returned to Boston in 1975. Between 1975 and 1977 Leiken worked as a community organizer, helping to integrate blacks and whites in Dorchester neighborhoods. Policy and research centers Upon returning to the United States in 1980, Leiken became a Senior Fellow at the Georgetown Center for Strategic and International Studies. Since then, he has served as a Senior Associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Research Associate at the Harvard University Center for International Affairs, a Visiting Fellow at the International Forum for Democratic Studies, a Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution, and The Center for the National Interest. The wide ideological variety of these organizations is emblematic of Leiken's effort to resist the tendency in Washington to derive policy from politics rather than investigation and has earned a reputation for patient, concrete and unbiased analysis. Nicaragua Leiken's October 1984 article in The New Republic entitled \\"Nicaragua's Untold Stories\\" criticized the Sandinistas for mismanagement, corruption, and human rights abuses, and political indoctrination. A 1986 profile in The National Journal wrote > The turning point came in the fall of 1984, when, after an intense 10 day > trip to Nicaragua, Leiken returned \\"appalled and angry\\" over conditions > there. He wrote an article criticizing the Sandinistas in terms that were, > for a liberal Democrat, unmistakably powerful and all the more striking > because they appeared in the traditionally liberal The New Republic, which > itself was undergoing something of a political reorientation to a more > centrist line.Christopher Madison, \\"Profiles in Influence: A Scholar's About > Face On the Sandinistas,\\" The National Journal, June 14, 1986 Leiken's article caused controversy among both Democrats and Republicans, according to Time Magazine: > The idea that a well respected liberal analyst would launch such a strong > attack on the Sandinistas caused considerable stir in Washington. Leiken's > apparent conversion was seen by the entrenched left as a betrayal and by > Reaganites as a vindication of their long held views.

But perhaps the > greatest impact of Mr. Leiken's change of heart and mind was felt somewhere > in the middle those who had come to rely on his scholarship and who now felt > moved to reexamine their Sandinista sympathies. He was also acclaimed for an op-ed in the New York Times (\\"The Sandinistas Might Lose...\\", February 12, 1990) on the eve of the first free elections in Nicaragua for correctly predicting the Sandinistas' stunning loss. Leiken's account of the Sandinistas and of the Contras made him a target of former leftist colleagues. He was to experience similar attacks later from conservatives upon the publication of his 2005 Foreign Affairs article, \\"The Moderate Muslim Brotherhood\\". The article argued that Al Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood are bitter enemies, and that the Brotherhood's \\"relative moderation offers Washington a notable opportunity for engagement—as long as policymakers recognize the considerable variation between the group's different branches and tendencies.\\"Leiken, Robert S.; Brooke, Steven (March/April 2007). \\"The Moderate Muslim Brotherhood\\" (article preview only; subscription required). Foreign Affairs. Clinton Administration Leiken served as the Executive Director of the Presidential Commission on Broadcasting to Cuba under President Bill Clinton. Later life Leiken's later work focused on jihadis, European Muslim immigration, Mexico, and immigration. Leiken's last book, Europe's Angry Muslims, was published in January 2012, by Oxford University Press. It received an enthusiastic review in the cover story of the May 24, 2012 New Republic and strongly favorable reviews in The Economist, the Christian Science Monitor, The New Statesman and The Evening Standard and elsewhere. Around the time of his death, he was working on a memoir (entitled 'How I Lost All My Friends)' of his times and thoughts as a labor and clandestine revolutionary organizer in Mexico, a community organizer during Boston's busing crisis of the mid-1970s, a critic of the Sandinistas, and a controversial analyst in Washington.

Leiken"},{"id":"9524912","text":"\\"Canada's New Government\\" was a branding term or political slogan used by the Government of Canada during the first twenty months of the 28th Canadian Ministry under Stephen Harper. Previously, federal government announcements simply referred to the \\"Government of Canada\\". Harper, leader of the Conservative Party, took office as Prime Minister of Canada on February 6, 2006. Immediately thereafter, the federal government began to use the term as part of a marketing campaign to differentiate the Harper government from the previous Liberal Party government, led by Paul Martin. For the first few months after Harper's party assumed office, it is believed that this term was used only in very high level communication and press releases from the Prime Minister's Office and the offices of federal cabinet ministers. It was also applied to some government communication through the www.gc.ca web portal. Beginning in the summer of 2006, wider use of the term was encouraged by the Harper government in Canada's public service, however policies for its use were unclear. The phrase was quietly dropped in October 2007, with most references reverting to the \\"Government of Canada\\".'New' government becomes old news for Tories, Canadian Press, October 16, 2007 Okulitch incident Issues regarding usage of the phrase within the public service culminated in a situation where Andrew Okulitch, a retired research scientist and at that time a scientist emeritus with the Geological Survey of Canada, refused to comply with a communications directive from Natural Resources Canada that specified employees use the term. It read as follows: :\\"As per the Minister's Office, effective immediately, the words \\"Canada's New Government\\" are to be used instead of \\"the Government of Canada\\" in all departmental correspondence. Please note that the initial letters of all three words are capitalized.

Autry and Burnette were uncredited, but the scene served as a screen test for the duo for subsequent singing cowboy films, beginning with The Phantom Empire (1935), in which Autry had his first leading role.George-Warren 2007, pp. 124–129. Based on a story by Wallace MacDonald and John Rathmell, the film is about a cowboy who loses his horse in a rigged horse race and gets framed for the murder of a stagecoach driver. The film was shot on location in Kentucky and Keystone Studios in California. Plot A cowboy named Kentucky Ken (Ken Maynard) and his sidekick, Cactus (George \\"Gabby\\" Hayes), meet a beautiful woman named Lila Miller (Evalyn Knapp) when her car accidentally goes off the road. Lila's father, Charlie Miller (H. B. Warner), owns the dude ranch where Ken and Cactus intend to enter their prize horse Tarzan in a gruelling canyon race. Two other men, Chandler and Tracy, have also arrived for the race. They are also plotting to blackmail Charlie, who has a secret criminal past, for half of his gold mine and ranch operation earnings. Chandler also hopes that his blackmail scheme will force Charlie into granting him permission to marry Lila, who is showing a definite interest in Ken. Charlie refuses to be bullied, however, and claims he was innocent of the crime. Before the race, Chandler and Tracy trick the gambling-prone Cactus into a wager in which Tarzan will be the prize if Ken loses the race. To assure their victory, Tracy sets up a trip-wire on the course, which injures Tarzan and allows Tracy to win the race. After he discovers the broken wire and suspects foul play, Ken refuses to give up his horse to Chandler. Shamed by his foolish behavior, Cactus vows to identify the saboteur, whose boot prints he discovers in the ground near the wire. Meanwhile, Tracy double-crosses Chandler by robbing the ranch stagecoach carrying a shipment of Charlie's gold. During the robbery, the driver is killed. Ken, who is trying to catch the bandits, is jailed for the crime after Tracy implicates him to the sheriff. With the help of Cactus and Tarzan, Ken escapes from jail and arrives at the ranch just as Chandler shoots Tracy. Again, Ken is suspected of the killing. After Cactus arrives with proof that Tracy's boots match the prints found on the racecourse, Ken tricks Chandler into a confession by claiming he possesses a damning note left by Tracy. The sheriff reveals to Chandler that Charlie came to him about the blackmail attempt and that, unknown to Chandler, whose real name is Monte Korber, Charlie had been pardoned of the earlier crime years before. With his reputation at last clear, Ken is free to court Lila, who has always loved him. Cast * Ken Maynard as Ken, alias Kentucky * Evalyn Knapp as Lila Miller * H. B.

Production =Casting= Gene Autry and Smiley Burnette in In Old Santa Fe In Old Santa Fe was Ken Maynard's first film for Mascot Pictures. He was paid $10,000 per week for four weeks to shoot the serial film. He was the highest-paid Western actor in Hollywood at the time.Green 2002, p. 105. For the first time, longtime character actor George Hayes developed a new \\"cranky but lovable\\" sidekick character that became very popular with audiences and led to his definitive sidekick role in John Wayne and Hopalong Cassidy Westerns and later, as Gabby Hayes, brought him \\"singing-cowboy immortality\\" in Gene Autry and Roy Rogers films.Green 2002, pp. 105–106. The film also features the first screen appearance of Gene Autry, singing a bluegrass rendition of \\"Wyoming Waltz\\" accompanied by Smiley Burnette on accordion. Both Autry and Burnette were unbilled, but the scene served as a screen test that would lead to many subsequent singing cowboy films. The film was later rereleased with Gene Autry being given top billing in the redesigned film credits. =Principal photography= Filming began on September 17, 1934, at Mack Sennett's Keystone Studios in California, and the principal photography was concluded in late September 1934. The producer, Nat Levine, introduced a modern West setting for the film, a dude ranch where horses and roadsters shared the open spaces and the actors dressed in contemporary Western fashions. The traditional lawman hero was replaced by radio stars and touring entertainers who \\"happened to foil evildoers in their spare time, rode powerful, intelligent horses, and formed posses composed of guitarists, fiddlers, and harmony singers.\\" This new modern approach to the Western became a hallmark of Gene Autry and Roy Rogers films made at Republic Pictures in the coming decade.Green 2002, p. 106. =Filming locations= * Keystone Studios, 1712 Glendale Blvd., Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California, USA (studio) =Soundtrack= * \\"As Long As I've Got My Dog\\" (Harold Lewis, Bernie Grossman) by Ken Maynard (dubbed by Bob Nolan) * \\"Someday in Wyoming\\" by Gene Autry * \\"Mama Don't Like Music\\" (Gene Autry, Smiley Burnette) by Smiley Burnette * \\"Down In Old Santa Fe\\" (Harold Lewis, Bernie Grossman) by Gene Autry and Smiley Burnette * \\"Because You Didn't Get a Girl\\" by Ken Maynard (dubbed by Bob Nolan) References ;Citations ;Bibliography * * External links  * Category:1934 films Category:American films Category:American Western (genre) films Category:1934 Western (genre) films Category:English-language films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films directed by David Howard Category:Films directed by Joseph Kane Category:Mascot Pictures films Category:Films produced by Nat Levine ","title":"In Old Santa Fe"},{"id":"9524919","text":"Diacalymene is a genus of trilobite from the order Phacopida, suborder Calymenina.

In particular, it identifies a \\"strategy of tension\\" involving violent attacks which are then blamed on radical left-wing groups in order to convince allied governments of the need for counter-action. It has been called the Westmoreland Field Manual because it is signed with the alleged signature of General William Westmoreland. It was labelled as supplement B (hence \\"30-31B\\"), although the publicly released version of FM30-31 only has one appendix, Supplement A.  History  The first mention of the document was in the Turkish newspaper Barış (sometimes anglicized to Barish), in 1975. A facsimile copy of FM30-31B then appeared a year later in Bangkok, Thailand, and in various capitals of north African states. In 1978, it appeared in various European magazines, including the Spanish Triunfo and El Pais. The Italian press picked up the Triunfo publication, and a copy was published in the October 1978 issue of L'Europeo. A wide range of field manuals, including 30-31, can be accessed through websites that catalog U.S. field manuals. However, 30-31B is not among the field manuals published by the military.

The discovery in the early-1990s of Operation Gladio (NATO stay-behind networks) in Europe led to renewed debate as to whether or not the manual was fraudulent.

It is a cargo cult of the Yaohnanen tribe, who believe that Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, the consort to Queen Elizabeth II, is a divine being. Origins According to ancient Yaohnanen tales, the son of a mountain spirit travelled over the seas to a distant land. There, he married a powerful woman and in time would return to them. He was sometimes said to be a brother to John Frum. The people of the Yaohnanen area believe that Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, the consort to Queen Elizabeth II, is a divine being. They had seen the respect accorded to Queen Elizabeth II by the colonial officials and concluded that her husband, Prince Philip, must be the son referred to in their legends. It is unclear just when this belief came about, but it was probably some time in the 1950s or 1960s. It was strengthened by the royal couple's official visit to Vanuatu in 1974, when a few villagers had the opportunity to actually see Prince Philip from a distance. The Prince was not then aware of the sect, but it was brought to his attention several years later by John Champion, the British Resident Commissioner in the New Hebrides. Champion suggested that Prince Philip send them a portrait of himself. He agreed and sent a signed official photograph. The villagers responded by sending him a traditional pig-killing club called a nal-nal. In compliance with their request, the Prince sent a photograph of himself posing with the club. Another photograph was sent in 2000. All three photographs were kept by Chief Jack Naiva, who died in 2009. Anne, Princess Royal, visited Tanna in October 2014. She is the only daughter of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. She had visited Vanuatu in 1974, but had not previously travelled to the island. On 27 September 2007, Channel 4 broadcast Meet the Natives, a reality show about five Tanna men from the Prince Philip Movement on a visit to Britain. Their trip culminated in an off-screen audience with Philip, where gifts were exchanged, including a new photograph of the Prince. The sect in the news In 2010 Australian journalist Amos Roberts visited Tanna and reported on the locals' celebration of Philip's 89th birthday, for SBS's magazine program Dateline. In 2011 the people of Yaohnanen village were featured in an episode of the second series of An Idiot Abroad with Karl Pilkington. In 2013, Man Belong Mrs Queen, a book by British writer Matthew Baylis, investigated the historical and anthropological origins of the movement and provided an account of the author's own stay on the island of Tanna.Man Belong Mrs Queen Baylis, Matthew (2013) Old Street Publishing.

Playing career Born in Dundee, Petrie started his career in his native Scotland, before moving south to join Sheffield Wednesday in April 1894. In round 1 of the 1896 FA Cup, Petrie was part of the Wednesday team that narrowly defeated his future employers, Southampton, before going on to win the final in April. After three seasons with Wednesday, Petrie moved to the south coast to join Southern League champions Southampton in May 1897, displacing John Hodgkinson. In his first season with the Saints, playing alongside Arthur Chadwick and Samuel Meston in the half-back line, he only missed two league games as Southampton claimed the Southern League title yet again. In 1897–98, Saints also reached the semi- final of the FA Cup before going out to Nottingham Forest in a replay (played in a blizzard). Described in Holley & Chalk's The Alphabet of the Saints as \\"very much a team player, Bob was never showy but always reliable and at his best when the chips were down.\\". He did, however, have a drink problem and shortly after joining Southampton was reprimanded by the board over his drinking. In the 1889–99 season, as a result of injury he lost his regular place to Scottish international John Robertson and only made nine appearances as Southampton, (now in their new home at The Dell), took the league title for the third consecutive season. In the following season, Robertson having moved back to Scotland to join Rangers, Petrie resumed his place in the centre of the half-back line as Southampton took third place in the league, but reached the final of the FA Cup against Bury. Southampton were the first Southern League club to reach the FA Cup final, and had already beaten three top flight clubs on the way to the finalGiant Killers 1900 but they failed to produce anything like their best form, conceding three goals in the first 20 minutes eventually losing 4–0. Two days after the final, Petrie made his final appearance for the Saints in a 4–1 league victory over Bristol City, after which he was replaced by fellow-Scot Don Greenlees. In his three seasons with Southampton, he made a total of 68 appearances, scoring six goals. In 1900 he moved to New Brighton Tower for their final season before the club was disbanded. He then returned to his native Scotland playing out his career for a variety of clubs, including three years with Arbroath and a spell with Brechin City just short of his 40th birthday.

His mother inherited money from Shropshire, and his father from the north of Ireland. According to legend, Betty's father frivolously spent his money, which resulted in his losing a large portion of his inheritance. This loss might have contributed to the extreme exploitation of his child. His son, Henry Betty, appeared in Spalding theatre for Fanny Robertson in October 1839. Career William Henry West Betty by John Opie. National Portrait Gallery, London. William Betty first showed his desire for the stage at the age of eleven when, in 1802, his father took the young boy to Belfast to watch Sheridan's Pizarro, starring Sarah Siddons in the role of Elvira. Her performance inspired him so much that William stated, \\"I shall certainly die if I may not be a player.\\" Betty's father introduced William to Michael Atkins, manager of the Belfast Theatre. After meeting the child, Atkins said, \\"I never dared to indulge in the hope of seeing another Garrick, but I have seen an infant Garrick in Betty.\\" Not long after meeting Atkins, Betty was introduced to the theatrical prompter Thomas Hough, so he could direct, train, and mentor young William in the role of Osman in Voltaire's Zair. While this was going on, there was an insurrection in Ireland which resulted in the closing of the Belfast theatre. Atkins knew he needed a huge attraction to bring in the crowds and he immediately thought of William. After some hard planning, it was settled, and on 11 August 1803, the eleven-year-old William Henry West Betty debuted professionally as the well-known Osman. His appearance brought in a large crowd, and reports stated that his performance was flawless and extremely well received. He next took on the role of Young Norval in John Home's Douglas. This role fit him much better since he was actually playing a child and, once again, he astonished people in the theatre. News of Master Betty soon began spreading across Europe. James Northcote, 1805) Master Betty's fame extended beyond just Belfast to Dublin, where Betty's father talked to Frederick Edward Jones, manager of the Crow Street Theatre. They were able to reach an agreement for Betty to appear again in Home's Douglas at the Theatre Royal, where he debuted on 28 November 1803. There he also played Frederick in Elizabeth Inchbald's Lovers' Vows, the title role in Tancred , and in William Shakespeare's Hamlet. It was said that in three hours of study he committed the part of Hamlet to memory. The citizens of Dublin became so excited over Betty that the civil authorities extended the curfew an hour for those attending the theatre. His parents then had Betty tour in Scotland and England in 1804, where he was treated with thunderous applause as he reprised past roles such as Young Norval in Douglas. His performances sold out and earned nearly 850 pounds the last six nights. Home, the author of Douglas, came to watch Betty and claimed that he \\"considered it the only performance where Young Norval was played according to his conception of the character.\\" Having become the biggest sensation in Dublin and Belfast, Master Betty was ready for London. On 1 December 1804, guards were hired to handle the anxious crowd at the doors of the Covent Garden Theatre waiting to get a glimpse of the child sensation. Some waited in line for hours. Constables stood inside the theatre, ready to stem any chaos. Once the doors were open, people flooded inside to find seats, creating a huge disorder. Clark Russell described the event: > Shrieks and screams of choking, trampled people were terrible. Fights for > places grew; Constables were beaten back, the boxes were invaded. The heat > was so fearful that men all but lifeless were lifted and dragged through the > boxes into the lobbies which had windows. Master Betty played Selim in Brown's Barbarossa or the Freedom of Algiers, an imitation of Voltaire's Mérope. The boy did not come on stage until half-way through the show, but he was still grandly received by his audience, including the prince of Wales. The second night, the patrons started a small riot, injuring many of the audience members and damaging the theatre. At Drury Lane, the house was similarly packed, and he played for the then unprecedented salary of over 75 guineas a night. Betty was also a great success socially. George III himself presented Betty to the queen, and William Pitt upon one occasion adjourned the House of Commons that members might be in time for his performance. Retirement and attempted comebacks Some of the roles Betty (thirteen) had played An advert on 3 February 1807 of a tour of the provinces: > THEATRE, STAMFORD. Messrs. ROBERTSON and MANLY, most desirous of manifesting > their respect for the town Stamford and its vicinity, have the satisfaction > of announcing the appearance of The celebrated YOUNG ROSCIUS Three Nights > during the Mart, 9th, 10th, & 11th March. They have gladly availed > themselves on this occasion of presenting to the very liberal patrons of the > Theatre this distinguished young Actor, whose extraordinary talents cannot > fail of contributing highly to the pleasures of their season. N. B. The very > great expence attending Master Betty's engagement compels the necessity of > raising the prices of admission ; Boxes, 5s. Pit, 3s. 6d.—Gallery, 2s. Provincial theatres raising their ticket prices in order to cover the higher fees charged by well known actors on tour in the provinces did not go unnoticed or without comment. The following hint has been given to Master BETTY'S Father, in a Provincial Journal, which we hope will not be given in vain. The Salopian Journal, after a liberal eulogium on Young BETTY'S acting, says \\" There is one character yet which will delight us all to him personate - that of Benefactor of the Salopian Infirmary; by performing on one night for that noble Institution.\\" What a monument of fame might both Father and Son; easily raise if the latter were, in the Provincial Towns in which he performs, to appear one night in support of every neighbouring Institution for the relief of infirmity and distress. The fees charged did not appear to have put off James Robertson (actor) as he offered additional appearances at their other theatres, however Master Betty declined as he was going to appear on a Northern tour. \\"Master BETTY's profits, for three nights performances at Boston Theatre amounted to £182. 18s. 6d. being half the takings. At Stamford he received the huge sum of £800 for five weeks. He declined accepting Robertson's proposals for Wisbech, Peterboro' &c.; as he was immediately going into the North for the whole of the summer\\" reported the British Press on 30 March 1807. Betty did however appear the next year on the Lincoln Circuit, first at Huntingdon between 20 and 25 May, then at Peterborough 27 May and 1 June, finally at the Georgian Wisbech Theatre (now the Angles Theatre), Isle of Ely in June not long before he quit the stage in 1808 in order to attend Christ's College in Cambridge. After graduation, he lived with his family in the country, having become financially secure. He was invited back to Covent Garden in 1812. He arrived in London on Monday 26 October, his first appearance was to be Achmet. The critics derided his performance, talking more about his former career as a child actor than his performance at the age of 21. Betty never returned to perform in London again. Nine years later, he once again tried to mount a comeback and failed. He then tried to commit suicide, which also failed. He gave up acting in 1824. Hough, his former dramatic tutor from his youth did not survive to see him retire, Hough died in London in the summer of 1821. Betty devoted the remainder of his life to works and theatrical charities. He died on 24 August 1874 in Ampthill Square, London.  Legacy  A review of Carl Miller's Play Master Betty was published in The Stage on 26 July 1990.

He spent four seasons with United playing at the top level in English football, and played a major part in them reaching the runners-up position in the 1896–97 season. In the summer of 1897, he was one of four Football League players who were signed by Southern League champions Southampton. Described by Holley & Chalk as \\"a dapper, clever forward (who)when at his best, was virtually unstoppable\\" his first season at The Dell was often interrupted by ill-health and he was out of the team from March onwards, thus missing out on \\"Saints\\" first FA Cup Semi-final against Nottingham Forest.Giant Killers 1898 In the 1897–98 season he made thirteen appearances at the start of the season, before losing his place to Bob Brown, scoring six goals as Southampton again claimed the Southern League championship. At the end of the season, because of his poor health, he decided not to sign a new contract and moved to Kent where he played for Gravesend United, also then in the Southern League. He returned to Southampton in March 1899, taking over from Tom Smith at outside-right, in time to help the Saints clinch the championship for the third successive season. The following season, Saints were able to finish in only third place in the table, as they were concentrating their efforts on the FA Cup where they reached the final for the first time in their history, the highlight of which was a 4–1 drubbing of Newcastle United in which Yates was among the scorers.Giant Killers 1900 Unfortunately, the Cup Final was a great disappointment as Saints were swept aside 4–0 by Bury. In 1900–01 he was part of the forward line-up which claimed the league title for the fourth time in five years after which he again left the club for an easier life in Sussex where he turned out occasionally for Hastings & St Leonards, keeping in touch with his former club by acting as a scout. He also spent some time in Denmark coaching for Copenhagen. On 6 July 1904, Yates became the first professional coach in Dutch football, when he signed a six-week contract with HVV.Voetbal International, 26 September 2012, page 70 In March 1905, after a brief period coaching with 93 Club, Copenhagen, he returned to The Dell for the third time (making him the only player in Southampton's history to sign for the club on three separate occasions). He only made one appearance (against Northampton Town on 18 March 1905) before finally retiring from playing football. In his three separate spells with Southampton, he made a total of 77 appearances, scoring 22 goals. Later career Over the next few years, he again turned out for both Gravesend and Hastings & St Leonards, before coaching in Brazil and USA. While at Hastings, he \\"discovered\\" Horace Glover and recommended him to his former club – Glover went on to make over 170 appearances for Southampton in the next five years, before joining West Ham United. He returned to Southampton in 1907, taking up employment as a stevedore in Southampton Docks. He was still dogged by ill-health resulting in him losing his job. Unable to find employment, he committed suicide on Southampton Common in September 1922.

Bailey (January 13, 1807 – February 5, 1876) was a British-born physician who immigrated to the United States, where he became a pioneer and politician in the Oregon Country, particularly the Willamette Valley. Bailey participated in the Champoeg Meetings that led to the creation of a provisional government in Oregon. Bailey was selected as a member of that government, first on the Executive Committee and later in the Provisional Legislature of Oregon. Early life William Bailey was born in Great Britain on January 13, 1807.Corning, Howard M. Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956. In England he was said to have studied medicine, before emigrating with his mother to the United States sometime before 1834. In the U.S. he enlisted in the Navy and traveled to the West Coast as a seaman, but deserted his ship in San Francisco. There is no evidence that he practiced medicine in the United States. Oregon William Bailey moved to Oregon from California in 1835, settling in the Willamette Valley. Bailey's group included John Woodward, George K. Gay, and John Turner. On this journey north, the group fought with the Rogue River Indians, losing four of their eight members of the party. Woodward, Gay, Bailey, and Turner were the survivors. Years later, Bailey and Gay murdered a Native American youth in the same area in retaliation during a cattle drive north from California. Bailey was working in the Willamette Cattle Company cattle drive from Mexican-owned California to Oregon. Leading the cattle drive was Ewing Young. In 1834 his party had killed several Rogue River natives on their journey to Oregon. This prompted their retaliation against Bailey's party the following year. Politics When the wealthy Ewing Young died without a will or known heir in February 1841, discussions about forming a settler government based in the Willamette Valley began. During these settler meetings, Bailey was selected as chairman of the committee to draft a constitution and laws for the region. The plans fell through due to the opposition by French-Canadians and instead only a probate court was established.Loewenberg, Robert J., \\"Creating a Provisional Government in Oregon: A Revision.\\" Seattle: The Pacific Northwest Quarterly 68, No. 1 (1977), pp. 19-21 Many participants in the talks were active in the later Champoeg Meetings, which led to the creation of the Provisional Government of Oregon. During the provisional government, William Bailey served as a member of the Second Executive Committee, along with Peter G. Stewart and Osborne Russell. This body acted in place of a single executive, though it was replaced with a governor in 1845 to streamline the executive branch of the government. The first and only governor was George Abernethy. In 1848, Bailey was elected to the provisional legislature from the Champoeg district.Grover, La Fayette, The Oregon Archives. Salem: A. Bush. 1853, p. 260 Marriage and Later life In Oregon Bailey married Margaret Jewett Smith from the Methodist Mission on 4 March 1839.Hussey, John A. Champoeg: Place of Transition, A Disputed History. Portland: Oregon Historical Society. 1967. pp. 90-91 In 1842 he sold his farm for $300 and left the Oregon Country for the United States of America. The couple returned two years later in May 1844, having to spend $700 to purchase his old farm. Selling his farm for $1,275 in 1850, the Baileys by September 1853 had established a homestead in Champoeg. Bailey at this point was openly having sex with any willing native woman.Lavender, David. Land of Giants; The Drive to the Pacific Northwest, 1750-1950. Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday Publishing, 1958. The couple's marriage continued to deteriorate, with Margaret fearing William's violent behaviors. The two did not have any children and divorced in 1854. On 2 November 1855 Bailey remarried to Julia M. Sheil. Bailey developed his property in Champoeg. He died there on February 5, 1876. He was buried at St. Paul Cemetery in St. Paul, Oregon.

Playing career As a player, he was a defender or Midfielder starting his career at Exeter City before a controversial transfer to local rivals Plymouth Argyle with Darran Rowbotham joining Exeter City in part exchange. For this reason, the Plymouth fans took time to accept Marker but his whole hearted performances in a green shirt soon made him a fans' favourite. Marker was awarded the club's Player of the Year award in 1990. His performances for Argyle also caught the eye of then Blackburn Rovers manager Kenny Dalglish who paid £500,000 to bring Marker to Ewood Park, with both Keith Hill and Craig Skinner moving in the opposite direction. Marker's first team involvement at Blackburn was limited as he was largely used as backup for regular centre-backs Colin Hendry and Henning Berg, or holding midfielder David Batty. He played no games in Blackburn's Premiership 1994/95 title- winning season. He moved on to Sheffield United in 1997 and made regular appearances over two seasons. However, by this time hip and back injuries were beginning to take their toll and Marker returned to Plymouth Argyle for a short loan period, before spells at Cheltenham Town and Tiverton Town where injuries eventually forced him into premature retirement. In 2011, eleven years after his retirement, two hip replacements, and at the age of 46, Marker made a single appearance for Ivybridge Town, coming on as a late substitute in a South West Peninsula League match at home to Dartmouth. He was cautioned for a late tackle within two minutes of his introduction. Such behaviour was not unexpected, considering how his other tackle ruined Ben Thornley's career in 1994https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/10/ben-thornley-manchester- united-giggs-scholes-beckham-drinking-book. Coaching career After retiring from the professional game Marker was involved with Plymouth amateur and youth club Tamarside FC from 2003 to 2009. He joined the club in 2003 to initially help coach his son's team, later getting involved in the club's senior team and was appointed club Chairman in 2006. He combined the role of Reserve Team manager and Youth Manager until leaving the club at the end of the 2008–09 season. In October 2010 it was announced that Marker had been appointed first team coach of Ivybridge Town, who play in the Premier Division of the South West Peninsula League. In June 2013 Marker was appointed First Team Manager after the resignation of Graeme Kirkup.

Early career Born in Great Marlow, Milward was one of the first Southerners to establish himself in the Football League. The son of a tradesman, he was educated at Sir William Borlase's Grammar School and played for the school's Old Boys team and for Marlow, before joining Everton in May 1888. A well-built, hard-working, determined and technically clever winger, he contested every ball, played at full stretch for the duration of the game and had a knack of delivering a cross-field pass to perfection from up to 40 yards, combined with his shooting power from wide positions. Everton =League debut= Milward made his league debut as centre-forward at Leamington Road against Blackburn Rovers on 10 November 1888. Both teams had uniforms of similar colours: blue and white, but Rovers allowed Everton to wear their normal colours and came out in red and black jerseys. The match started at a frantic pace but neither side was particularly threatened. However, at one point Everton's right side struggled to cope with the Rovers' attack and Rovers exploited this to score. At half-time the score was 1–0 to Blackburn Rovers. In the second half, Everton had the sun behind them and started more aggressively. Everton's goalkeeper Robert Smalley had to make a good save to prevent Rovers scoring, but with the wind at their backs, Everton's play became flat and Rovers took full advantage scoring twice more, with the match finishing 3–0 to Blackburn Rovers. =1888–89 season= After their defeat at Blackburn in Milward's debut game, he was left out from 17 November until 29 December 1888. The new year of 1889 saw Milward back in favour, and he was picked to play at outside-left in the home match against Stoke City Potters where he scored his first League goal in a 2–1 win. Robert Watson made the pass and Milward shot past the Potters' keeper. The following week Preston North End were the visitors and Milward made his second appearance at centre-forward. From 19 January to 9 February, he played three games in a row, all at centre-forward. He missed the visit to West Bromwich Albion but returned at centre-forward for the final game of the season, a 3–1 home win over Blackburn Rovers. He scored his second goal in that match. Milward played six matches for Everton where he scored two of his team's six goals. The team's 35 total goals scored that season was the second lowest tally by any League club. Everton finished eighth. (registration & fee required) Later career He quickly established himself and forced his way into the England squad, being one of five Everton players in the national team to play against Scotland in 1891. By this time Milward was noted as a hard- working outside-left and at Everton and had forged a great partnership with Edgar Chadwick. Milward scored 11 goals in 22 games when Everton won the Football League title in 1890–91 and also won two FA Cup Runners-up medals before leaving Everton in 1897 and joining the newly formed New Brighton Tower club. In 1899 Milward was enticed south to join an impressive-looking Southampton team who, despite being in the Southern League, boasted a star- studded side of experienced ex-internationals and former top flight players. With Milward in the side they surged past three top flight clubs in 1900 to reach the cup final, with Milward himself netting a brace to humiliate his former Everton colleagues in the first round. On the day of the match, in- fighting between the English and Scottish players over the selection of one of the forwards caused a rift in the team that was evident in their easy defeat. Milward died at Winchester on 1 June 1941.

It lies on Calle Marta Abreu, one of the city's main arteries, only two blocks from Parque Vidal and next to the cultural centre \\"El Mejunje\\". Overview The cathedral is the most important religious building in the city. The much argued-about church was built in 1940 after its colonial predecessor in Parque Vidal was demolished in 1923. Neo-Gothic in style, the new cathedral includes a wonderful collection of leaded stained glass windows, the marble \\"pilón\\" or holy water basin used for baptisms for most of the city's history (those thereby baptized are called \\"pilongos\\"), and the statue of Jesus in the upper front holding a gold monstrance. But the most impressive piece of art is the larger-than-life statue of the Virgin Mary inside the structure, locally known as \\"la Virgen del camino\\" (Travelers' Virgin). Until the Cuban Revolution, this statue was located on the road to Havana as a way to bless travelers. It was pulled down soon after and it disappeared for more than three decades. It was finally re-discovered around 1995 in a ditch, covered by soil and undergrowth. Already forgotten by the citizens of Santa Clara, a political battle ensued to decide whether to give it to a museum or the church. It was finally granted to the religious authorities. The construction of the cathedral went through several public controversies. It was a heated electoral issue for ruling mayors in colonial times. Most of them and a number of citizens back in the 1920s were torn between the possibility of keeping the colonial \\"Iglesia Mayor\\" (Grand Church, 1738) located in Parque Vidal, or tearing it down in order to make space for a re-designed and bigger plaza and re-locating the cathedral in a nearby location. Some people insisted on keeping the historic building, since it was one of the oldest in the growing city, realizing its importance as heritage. Eventually it was destroyed and two decades later the new one was constructed. Not happy with this action, Church authorities raised a formal complaint versus the city and won, although the church has never received the compensation that was awarded.

Background George Royal was a bay horse foaled in Cloverdale, British Columbia. He was sired by Dark Hawk out of the mare Polly Bashaw. His great- grandsire was Hyperion, son of the English Triple Crown Champion Gainsborough. He was originally owned by Robert Hall and Ernie Hammond and trained by Robert W. Hall. Racing career The colt began racing at two at Vancouver's Exhibition Park, winning four of his eight starts. Although a winner of nine consecutive stakes races at age three, he received little notice in Canada in 1964 as a result of Northern Dancer becoming the first Canadian-bred to win the Kentucky Derby. Ridden and eventually trained by Texan Donald Richardson, George Royal was sent to California to compete, where Johnny Longden took over as jockey. In 1965, George Dunn handled his conditioning, for a short time, on behalf of Robert Hall. In 1965, George Royal won the 1-mile San Juan Capistrano Handicap on the turf at Santa Anita Park, then later the Canadian International Stakes at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto. His performances in 1965 made him the first British Columbia-bred horse to win Canadian Horse of the Year honours. In 1965 George Royal made Canadian history when he became the 1st horse to ride in a commercial passenger plane when he flew with Air Canada from Vancouver to Toronto. In 1966, in Johnny Longden's last race as a jockey, George Royal repeated as winner of the San Juan Capistrano Handicap. In the Clubhouse at Santa Anita Park there is an oil painting of the finish of the 1966 San Juan Capistrano, which was also used for the cover of the Santa Anita official program during the 1967 racing season. That fall, jockey Ismael Valenzuela made it back-to-back wins in the Canadian International Stakes. Stud record Retired to stud duty as number two in earnings by a Canadian- bred horse, George Royal stood at Robert W. Hall's Emerald Acres farm in Aldergrove, British Columbia, where he sired several stakes winners before suffering a stroke in 1981 that led to his having to be humanely euthanized. He was buried at the family farm, Emerald Acres, where a monument marks the spot. Honours On its creation in 1976, George Royal was inducted in the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame. Honored by the British Columbia Horse Racing Hall of Fame, his statue stands in the paddock at Hastings Racecourse in Vancouver and a stakes race there bears his name.

It houses the remains of the revolutionary Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara and twenty-nine of his fellow combatants killed in 1967 during Guevara's attempt to spur an armed uprising in Bolivia. The full area, which contains a bronze 22-foot statue of Guevara, is referred to as the Ernesto Guevara Sculptural Complex.Santa Clara's Che Guevara Memorial and Museum Interview with Cuban sculptor José Delarra History =Historical overview= Guevara was buried with full military honors on 17 October 1997 after his remains were discovered in Bolivia, exhumed and returned to Cuba. At the site, there is a museum dedicated to Guevara's life and an eternal flame lit by Fidel Castro in his memory. Santa Clara was chosen as the location in remembrance of Guevara's troops taking the city on December 31, 1958, during the Battle of Santa Clara. The result of this final battle of the Cuban Revolution was Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista fleeing into exile. Nearby, in another part of the city, a Fulgencio Batista military supply train derailed by Guevara during the battle also remains in its original location. =Return of remains= In October 1997, Guevara's remains, and those of six comrades who died with him in Bolivia, arrived in a motorcade from Havana in small wooden caskets aboard trailers towed by green jeeps.Revolutionary's Remains are Returned to City of his Greatest Victory by The Associated Press, October 15, 1997 As the remains were unloaded before a crowd of several hundred thousand people, a choir of schoolchildren sang Carlos Puebla's elegy to Guevara, \\"Hasta Siempre\\" (Until Forever) and then Fidel Castro declared the following: His speech was followed by a coordinated 21 cannon-shot salute in both Santa Clara and Havana, while air raid sirens were set off across the length of the island. In addition to those of Che Guevara the remains of six other guerrillas who lost their lives in the 1966–1967 Bolivian Insurgency were also entombed in the mausoleum on October 17, 1997: * Carlos Coello (Tuma) – Cuban, killed in action at Rio Piraí on June 26, 1967. * Alberto Fernandez Montes de Oca (Pacho) – Cuban, killed in action at Quebrada del Yuro on October 8, 1967. * Orlando Pantoja Tamayo (Olo) – Cuban, killed in action at Quebrada del Yuro on October 8, 1967. * René Martínez Tamayo (Arturo) – Cuban, killed in action at Quebrada del Yuro on October 8, 1967. * Juan Pablo Navarro-Lévano Chang (El Chino) – Peruvian, captured and executed in La Higuera on October 9, 1967. * Simeon Cuba Sarabia (Willy) – Bolivian, captured and executed in La Higuera on October 9, 1967. Monument Work on the complex began in 1982, and it was inaugurated upon completion on December 28, 1988 with Raúl Castro in attendance. The project was conceived by architects Jorge Cao Campos, Blanca Hernández and José Ramón Linares; along with sculptors and José de Lázaro Bencomo and José Delarra (its prime creator). Additionally 500,000 Santa Clara residents contributed more than 400,000 hours of volunteer work in the construction of the sculptural complex, who worked in unison with skilled artisans of the Eliseo Díaz Machado Foundry in Guanabacoa.Che Memorial Reaches 2.5 Million Visits By Freddy Perez Cabrera, January 5, 2009 Many different aspects of Guevara's life are represented throughout the complex. For example, his time in Guatemala and at the United Nations is sculpted, while his farewell letter to Fidel is inscribed in full. The adjacent decorative wall depicts him in the Sierra Maestra consulting with Fidel, beside Camilo Cienfuegos, and in the mountains on horseback. Another section shows Guevara as Minister of Industry performing his usual voluntary work. Lastly literacy tutors, children in schools, and young pioneers are depicted issuing the daily salute that all Cuban children recite each morning \\"We will be like Che.\\" The structural complex rests on a rolling hilltop overlooking the city of Santa Clara, and contains a large tiled plaza.Cubans Still Embrace \\"El Che\\" as Hero by Philip True, San Antonio Express News, January 19, 1998 At the end of the plaza are two large billboards with quotes by Fidel Castro declaring \\"Che - it was a star that put you here and made you of this people\\", and \\"We want everyone to be like Che.\\" Carved in stone underneath the statue is the well known declaration by Guevara that \\"One thing I learned in the Guatemala of Arbenz was that if I would be a revolutionary doctor, or just a revolutionary, first there must be a revolution.\\" =Symbolism= A number of elements of the memorial contain a symbolic meaning. For instance, the monument is orientated 190 degrees pointing Che's figure directly towards South America, reflecting his focus and outlook for one united Latin America. Additionally, the 22 foot bronze statue of Che has him carrying his gun rather than aiming, symbolizing that he is \\"continuing onward\\". The sling which Guevara wore during the battle, the result of an earlier broken arm, is also etched into the statue but he is not wearing the sling to symbolize \\"a part of his personality, a man rebelling even against himself.\\" At the base of the memorial is Guevara's motto, \\"Hasta la Victoria Siempre\\" (Until the Eternal Victory). Visitor totals From October 1997 to October 2009 over 3 million people visited the memorial site from over 100 countries.Che Guevara Memorial Reaches Three Million Visitors Cuban News Agency, October 17, 2009 In 2008, more than 247,700 Cubans and foreigners visited the sculptural complex.Cubans, Foreigners Visit Che Monument Prensa Latina, April 11, 2009 Additional interments at the site Between 1997 and 2000 ongoing efforts by forensic anthropologists operating in southeast Bolivia yielded the recovery of 23 additional sets of remains belonging to other guerrillas who had perished during the Bolivian Insurgency. All of these were subsequently transferred to Cuba where they too were interred in the Che Guevara Mausoleum. The first of these burials took place on December 29, 1998, the 40th anniversary of Guevara's victory in the Battle of Santa Clara, and consisted of 10 separate sets of remains: * Haydée Tamara Bunke Bider (Tania)- Argentine-East German, killed in action at Vado del Yeso on August 31, 1967. * Manuel Hernández Osorio (Miguel)- Cuban, killed in action at Quebrada de Batan on September 26, 1967. * Mario Gutierrez Ardaya (Julio)- Bolivian, killed in action at Quebrada de Batan on September 26, 1967. * Roberto Peredo Leigue (Coco)- Bolivian, killed in action at Quebrada de Batan on September 26, 1967. * Aniceto Reinaga Cordillo (Aniceto)- Bolivian, killed in action at Quebrada del Yuro on October 8, 1967. * Francisco Huanca Flores (Pablito)- Bolivian, killed in action at Los Cajones on October 12, 1967. * Garvan Edilverto Lucio Hidalgo (Eustace)- Peruvian, killed in action at Los Cajones on October 12, 1967. * Jaime Arana Campero (Chapaco)- Bolivian, killed in action at Los Cajones on October 12, 1967. * Octavio de la Concepcion Pedraja (Moro)- Cuban, killed in action at Los Cajones on October 12, 1967. * Julio César Méndez Korné (Nato)- Bolivian, shot by fellow guerrillas after being gravely wounded in Mataral on November 15, 1967.

Taslan is an expired registered trademark of DuPont for this process, first registered on October 19, 1954. In German the word is Luftex. The process is simply feeding a bundle of continuous filament yarns into a small jet nozzle with various amounts of slack (overfeed). High pressure air ( > 100 PSI ) creates a suction and a turbulent airstream which tangles any slack into a yarn with a similar hand as a spun yarn. It is the turbulent airflow that tangles the fibers. This method of yarn productions creates a yarn that is normally more even than a spun yarn and does not pill like a spun yarn. Taslan is also a name for yarn made using this process.

Amateur footballing career and early coaching career Born in Roeselare, Dury began his career as an amateur footballer in the Belgian lower leagues playing for Hulste Sport from 1971 to 1981. He made his first coaching experiences at Harelbeke where he was in charge of the second team, as well as at KSK Beveren-Leie, K.S.K. Ronse and R.R.C. Tournaisien. Professional coaching career =Zultse VV/Zulte- Waregem, RCH Gent= With the exception of a season-long stint at RCH Gent, Dury coached Zultse VV from 1990 to 2010 with Zultse being merged into S.V. Zulte Waregem in 2001. Having helped his team to promotions from the first level of the Belgian provincial leagues (1991), the Belgian Fourth Division (1994 and 1999), the Belgian Third Division (2002) and the Belgian Second Division (2005) he won the second division championship with Zulte-Waregem in the 2004–05 season achieving promotion to the highest level in Belgian football, the Belgian Pro League. In the club's first season in the highest division Dury guided Zulte-Waregem to a sixth place in the league as well as to winning the 2005–06 Belgian Cup, earning qualification to the Europa League. Following these achievements, two personal honours were bestowed on him: he was voted coach of the year 2006, and West-Flemish personality of the year by the watchers of the regional television chains Focus and WTV in 2006. In 2007, he signed a professional contract as coach of the club while giving up his previously-held job as detective.

The children of Edmund Boyle (Richard Cosway) On 31 August 1764 he married firstly Anne Courtenay (1742–1785), daughter and eventual heir of Kelland Courtenay (1707–1748). They had six children, one daughter and five sons, including Edmund Boyle and Admiral Sir Courtenay Boyle, and separated in 1782. On 17 June 1786, he married secondly Mary Monckton, daughter of the 1st Viscount Galway: her salon was one of the centres of intellectual life in London for half a century. The ODNB considers that Charles Dickens used Maria, Lady Cork as the template for Mrs Leo Hunter in The Pickwick Papers and that 'Benjamin Disraeli, who knew Lady Cork well, is said to have described her accurately as Lady Bellair in his 1837 novel Henrietta Temple'.

In a racing career which lasted from May 1948 until 1950 he ran seventeen times and won fourteen races. He was the best British two-year- old of 1948 and returned from a narrow defeat in the 2000 Guineas to become the dominant sprinter in England in 1949 and 1950. Background Abernant was a grey horse who was bred by Catherine Macdonald-Buchanan and raced in the colours of her husband Reginald Macdonald-Buchanan. He was sired by The Derby winner Owen Tudor, by Hyperion, a son of the English Triple Crown winner, Gainsborough. Abernant's dam, Rustam Mahal, was a non-winning daughter of Rustom Pasha and the very important broodmare Mumtaz Mahal who in turn was sired by The Tetrarch. Abernant was a half brother to Kurdistan (by Tehran) who was a successful sire in New Zealand, siring among others, Baghdad Note, a winner of the Melbourne Cup. Abernant was a dark-grey horse during his racing career although like all grey horses, his coat lightened as he aged. Abernant was sent into training with Noel Murless at Beckhampton in Wiltshire. Racing record =1948:two-year-old season= Abernant was beaten on his debut in a race at Lingfield, but won his remaining five races in 1948. He won the Chesham Stakes at Royal Ascot, the National Breeders' Produce Stakes at Sandown, the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster (beating Nimbus by six lengths) and the Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket. His only serious challenge came in the National Stakes in which he had to be ridden out by Richards to beat Star King. At the end of the year, he was rated the best British two-year-old in the Free Handicap. Timeform Annual of 1948 Stated “has terrific speed: runs very freely and although in each of his last 2 races he did not appear to have anything left in him at the finish: top class racehorse.” Timeform rated Abernant at 133 as a two year old.Timeform Annual 1948 =1949:three-year-old season= On his first appearance as a three-year-old, Abernant won over seven furlongs at Bath and was then moved up to one mile to contest the one mile 2000 Guineas at Newmarket. He started favourite at odds of 5/9 and led from the start under Gordon Richards. In the closing stages his stamina failed and he was caught and beaten a short head by Nimbus in the closest finish in the race's history. Following his defeat at Newmarket, Abernant reverted to sprint distances and went through the rest of the season unbeaten. His wins included the King's Stand Stakes, the July Cup, the King George Stakes and the Nunthorpe Stakes. In the Nunthorpe he won by five lengths despite only taking the lead inside the final furlong. =1950:four-year-old season= At age four in 1950, he was beaten in the King's Stand Stakes, when he failed to concede twenty-three pounds to the three-year-old Tangle. He won the Lubbock Sprint Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse, to give Richards his 4000th winner. He repeated as the easy winner of the July Cup, the Nunthorpe Stakes and the King George Stakes. He ended his career that year with fourteen wins from the seventeen races he entered. On Abernant's retirement, Murless said that \\"there is nothing left for him to win\\". Assessment Abernant's Timeform rating of 142 equals that of Ribot as the fourth best ever awarded. In the years that followed his retirement, among the many accolades, The Independent newspaper wrote that Abernant \\"was the best sprinter ever to grace a racecourse.\\" Timeform rated Abernant the best horse of his generation in Europe at ages two, three and four years of age. He was the joint-highest rated horse of 1949 (with the stayer Alycidon) and the highest-rated horse of 1950. In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Abernant the best British sprinter of the century and the No. 20 horse in their global ranking, one place ahead of Man o' War. Gordon Richards described Abernant as the fastest horse he ever rode. Stud record Abernant sired the winners of over 1,000 races including Abermaid (1962 1,000 Guineas Stakes), Even Star (Irish 1,000 Guineas), Welsh Rake (1963 Queen Anne Stakes) Zahedan (1965 National Stakes) and Thin Ice (Sanford Stakes).Abernant (GB) Retrieved on 11 June 2009 He died in 1970 at age twenty-four and is buried at Egerton Stud in Newmarket. In a recent interview with trainer Mark Tompkins, Julie Murless, the daughter of Abernant's trainer, recalled that the gentle horse loved children and as a child of five she would sit on his back.

The route is long and runs from U.S. Route 522 (US 522) near Shade Gap east to US 11/US 15 in Camp Hill. PA 641 heads east from Shade Gap in Huntingdon County and immediately crosses PA 35 before it heads across Tuscarora Mountain into Franklin County. The route intersects PA 75 in Spring Run before it crosses Kittatinny and Blue mountains and reaches a junction with PA 997 in Roxbury. PA 641 heads into the agricultural Cumberland Valley and enters Cumberland County, where it intersects PA 696 in Newburg and PA 233 in Newville before reaching Carlisle. In Carlisle, the route runs concurrent with US 11 and PA 74 on High Street and crosses PA 34 in the center of town. East of here, PA 641 has an interchange with Interstate 81 (I-81) and heads to Mechanicsburg, where it intersects PA 114. The route continues through the western suburbs of Harrisburg and has an interchange with US 11/PA 581 before ending in Camp Hill. PA 641 has a truck route, PA 641 Truck, that bypasses the winding stretch across Kittatinny Mountain. PA 641 was designated in 1928 to run from PA 74 in Carlisle east to US 11 (Carlisle Pike) in Camp Hill. The same year, the road between Shade Gap and east of Spring Run and for a short distance to the west of Roxbury became part of PA 433 while PA 333 was designated onto the road between Roxbury and Newburg. In 1937, PA 641 was extended west to PA 433 east of Spring Run, replacing the portion of PA 333 between Roxbury and Newburg and running concurrent with PA 433 for a short distance to the west of Roxbury. The east end was moved to its current location at US 15 in the 1950s, with a realigned US 15 replacing the section of PA 641 north on 32nd Street to Carlisle Pike. In the 1960s, PA 641 was extended west to Shade Gap, replacing that stretch of PA 433 while the PA 433 designation was also removed from the road to the west of Roxbury.

Here, PA 641 turns south onto North Orange Street and passes under Norfolk Southern's Shippensburg Secondary before it comes to an intersection with US 11. At this point, PA 641 turns east for a concurrency with US 11 on West High Street, passing between the railroad tracks to the north and businesses to the south. The railroad tracks head further to the north and the road continues east through the campus of Dickinson College, passing to the north of a few homes and businesses. US 11/PA 641 runs through more of the college campus and comes to an intersection with PA 74, at which point that route joins US 11/PA 641 on West High Street. The three routes head into the commercial downtown of Carlisle, where it comes to an intersection with PA 34 at Hanover Street at the center of town. Here, US 11 turns north to follow PA 34 while PA 74/PA 641 continue east on East High Street, heading through more of the downtown. Past the downtown area, the road runs past homes before passing businesses as a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane. PA 74 splits from PA 641 by heading southeast on York Road, providing access to southbound I-81.

PA 641 passes under a Norfolk Southern branch line serving the naval facility and continues through developed areas. The route comes to a partial interchange with the US 11/PA 581 freeway, with access to northbound US 11/eastbound PA 581 and from southbound US 11/westbound PA 581. Past this interchange, the road continues through residential and commercial areas, entering the borough of Camp Hill. Here, PA 641 becomes a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane and comes to its eastern terminus at an intersection with US 11/US 15. History When Pennsylvania legislated routes in 1911, what is now PA 641 was designated as part of Legislative Route 121 between Shade Gap and Spring Run and as part of Legislative Route 264 between Spring Run and Roxbury. At this time, the current alignment of the route between Carlisle and Camp Hill was a paved road. PA 641 was designated in 1928 to run from PA 74 in Carlisle east to US 11 (Carlisle Pike) in Camp Hill, following its current alignment east before turning north on 32nd Street to US 11. The same year, PA 433 was designated onto the road between US 522 in Shade Gap and Amberson Road and between Cold Spring Road and Roxbury while PA 333 was designated onto the road between Roxbury and Newburg, both these sections of PA 433 and PA 333 were unpaved. The road between Newburg and Carlisle was an unnumbered road that was unpaved between Newburg and Green Spring and paved between Green Spring and Carlisle. In 1937, PA 641 was extended west from Carlisle to PA 433 at the intersection of Amberson Road and Timmons Road, following its current alignment. The route ran concurrent with PA 433 between Roxbury and Cold Spring Road. The extended PA 641 designation replaced PA 333 between Roxbury and Newburg. The entire length of PA 641 was paved in the 1930s along with the section of PA 433 between Shade Gap and the western terminus of PA 641. The eastern terminus of PA 641 was moved to its present location at US 15 in the 1950s, with a rerouted US 15 replacing the route along 32nd Street. In the 1960s, PA 641 was extended west to its current terminus at US 522 in Shade Gap, replacing the section of PA 433 between Shade Gap and Amberson Road. In addition, the concurrent PA 433 designation was removed from PA 641 between Cold Spring Road and Roxbury. Major intersections PA 641 Truck Pennsylvania Route 641 Truck (PA 641 Truck) is an truck route of PA 641 in Fannett Township in Franklin County that bypasses a winding section of PA 641 that crosses Kittatinny Mountain. PA 641 Truck begins at PA 641 by heading east-southeast on two-lane undivided Amberson Road, which is designated as State Route 4006 (SR 4006). The road soon turns to the northeast and runs through a mix of farmland and woodland, with the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76) parallel to the northwest. The truck route heads through the community of Laurel Grove before it passes under the Pennsylvania Turnpike. PA 641 Truck curves to the east and runs through farmland before it turns southeast onto Cold Spring Road, still following SR 4006. The road curves to the south as it comes to a bridge over the Pennsylvania Turnpike just west of the Kittatinny Mountain Tunnel. The truck route heads southwest through forested areas as it traverses Kittatinny Mountain. PA 641 Truck reaches its eastern terminus at another intersection with PA 641 between Kittatinny and Blue mountains. In 1928, Amberson Road and Cold Spring Road were designated as part of PA 433; both roads were unpaved. This section of PA 433 was paved in the 1930s. The PA 433 designation was removed from Amberson Road and Cold Spring Road in the 1960s, leaving these roads unnumbered. With the creation of the Location Referencing System in 1987, Amberson Road and Cold Spring Road were designated as SR 4006. PA 641 Truck was assigned to its current alignment by 1991.

It is across the river directly north of Rimouski, Quebec. It belongs to the Pessamit Innu Band. The reserve includes the communities of Betsiamites and Papinachois. Etymology It has been argued that the word Betsiamites could mean \\"those arriving by river\\". However, most authors today agree that the word came from the Innu root \\"Pessamit\\", meaning of \\"place where there are leeches or lampreys or sea eels\\". The dialect spoken at Mistissini uses the older form \\"upesciyâmîhc\\" as the locative noun referring to the town, and the form \\"upesciyâmîw-iyiniw\\" in reference to the people of Pessamit. The local form of the name can be explained by phonological changes that have occurred in the local dialect. In particular, the dialect of Pessamit has undergone the following phonological changes - it regularly drops short initial vowels, it has lost consonantal pre-aspirations, it has coalesced -sc- to -ss-, and final -c's have changed to final t's.http://www.puq.ca/catalogue/livres/grammaire-langue-innue-2589.html This has resulted in local pronunciation of Pessamit from the more historical upesciyâmîhc. The names Betsiamites and Bersimis have been in use concurrently since the mid 19th century. The Innu and Oblate missionaries used Betsiamites, whereas Bersimis was preferred by Admiral Henry Wolsey Bayfield during his hydrographic surveys of the St. Lawrence and by the Hudson's Bay Company. Further interchangeable use between these names can be seen from the designation of the post offices on both sides of the Betsiamites River: on the west side, it was called Bersimis from 1863 to 1910, then Moulin-Bersimis (Bersimis-Mills) until 1945, and Rivière-Bersimis from then on. On the east side in the Innu village, the post office opened as Notre-Dame-de-Betshiamits in 1881, renamed to Bersimis in 1898 until 1919, and then took the name Betsiamites when demanded by the people. Similarly, the Indian reserve went through a few name changes: first Bersimis, then Betsiamites in 1981, and since 2008, Pessamit. History Indigenous people had lived or visited the site for centuries prior to arrival of Europeans. Early in the 17th century, Samuel de Champlain reported the presence of an Innu village on the North Shore of the Saint Lawrence that he identified as Sauvages Bersiamiste on his map of 1632. During the French Era, a trading post was established at the mouth of the Betsiamites River called Pointe-des-Bersimites by Gilles Hocquart in 1733 (although this post was probably located on the west bank of the Betsiamites River rather than on the east bank where the village now stands). During that same period, numerous Jesuit missionaries evangelized and converted the Innu that visited the various trading posts along the coast. In 1845, the registers of the Notre-Dame-de-Betshiamits Mission opened and a few years later in 1849, the Innu began to clear the site of present village in order to build a chapel. In 1855, the Hudson's Bay Company established its post, and from 1860 on, an industrial community developed on the west side of the Betsiamites River, known as Bersimis (now Rivière-Bersimis in the Municipality of Colombier), that by 1900 was larger than the Innu village on the east side. In 1853, the Innu of Betsiamites were first assigned a reserve of west of the Outardes River, known as the Manicouagan Reserve, that was described by John Rolph, Commissioner of Crown Lands, as: \\"On the River St Lawrence from the River of Vases to the River of Outardes at Manicouagan about 11 miles in breadth by 10 miles in depth.\\" (The River of Vases is now known as Ragueneau River, so the reserve roughly corresponded to the current municipality of Ragueneau). In 1861, the Governor General in Council allowed the Innu to move from Manicouagan to the Bersimis Reserve, that had the same area of Manicouagan Reserve, namely . But the formation of the reserve hardly affected the Innu because, for many years thereafter, most families remained nomadic and would spend almost all of their lives in the forest, hunting for caribou, beaver, and bear, as well as hare and partridge to supplement their diet. In fact, the Innu were slow in adopting new techniques and improvements, such as canvas canoes or metal stoves, but rather maintained their traditional beliefs, knowledge, behaviors, and techniques.Natural Resources Canada - Legal Surveys Division, Historical Review - Betsiamites In 1924, the band council permitted the Government of Quebec to construct the provincial highway (Quebec Route 138) across the reserve, and in 1955, the local road between the village and the highway was built. On February 21, 1981, the Band Council of Bersimis renamed itself and the reserve to Betsiamites. In 2005, the Betsiamites Band Council was renamed again, this time to the Innu Council of Pessamit, and on November 6, 2008, the Commission de toponymie du Québec (Quebec Geographical Names Board) agreed to change the name of the reserve to the Pessamit Indian Reserve. Economy The largest employer on the reserve is the band council, followed by Société d'aménagement et de développement forestier de Betsiamites, a forestry corporation that is managing the logging activities in the forests making up a large portion of the reserve's territory. Economic development is led and supported by the Société de développement économique de Betsiamites, and tourism is promoted by the Développement touristique de Betsiamites, the organization that manages the Papinachois Resort and the Lac- des-Îles Outfitter. Other economic activities include mining, wind power, and hydroelectricity projects.

Main characters ; : :Embodiment of the no-nonsense personality, 19-year-old (as shown on her profile shown in episode 7) Inspector Re-l Mayer of the is in charge of investigating a series of brutal murders apparently committed by AutoReivs infected with the Cogito Virus. She is also the granddaughter of Donov Mayer, the Regent of Romdo. Given her privileged status, she demands respect from those around her (in the Japanese dub, she addresses Vincent as \\"o-mae\\"). Re-l eventually accompanies Vincent on his journey in order to learn more about the mysterious Proxies and why she feels so drawn to them. Re-l's signature appearance consists of dark clothes, black hair and a liberal amount of blue eye-shadow. ; : :An immigrant from Mosk working for Romdo's within the , set up to hunt and dispose of infected AutoReivs. In the first few episodes, Vincent's eyes remain closed, his hair is slicked down with a large cowlick, and he appears short and \\"dumpy.\\" However, as the series progresses, he opens his bright green eyes more, stops styling his hair, and carries himself with more confidence and seriousness. He is originally driven to become a Model Citizen, but ultimately fails to suppress the burden of his traumatic past and flees from Romdo. He has a romantic interest in Re-l Mayer. ; : :An infected Companion Type AutoReiv with the mind of a child. Pino was originally owned by Raul Creed and his wife, Samantha, whom Pino served as a surrogate child. She was scheduled for decommissioning after the Creeds were granted a real baby son by the government, but the untimely deaths of Samantha and their baby son at the hands of Monad Proxy leaves Pino infected with the Cogito Virus. She becomes very attached to Vincent early in the series and accompanies him on his journey. Pino possesses long purple hair, green eyes, a child-like physique and often wears a pink rabbit costume, which is significant as her role as the 'white rabbit' character in the series. She is commonly seen playing a melodica. In the Japanese dub, Pino often refers to herself in the third person and refers to Re-l as \\"Re-l Re-l.\\" Recurring characters ; : :An Entourage AutoReiv belonging to Re-l Mayer, Iggy contracted a \\"weaponized\\" version of the Cogito Virus and grew to become enraged at Re-l's lack of regard for him. He despises Proxies and blames Vincent for taking Re-l - his sole Raison d'Être - away from him. He develops an unusual state of both loving (because she is his master and raison d'être) and hating (because she is selfish and arrogant) Re-l, and locks her up to \\"protect\\" her, while he attempts to kill Vincent. Re-l escapes after being attacked by an AutoReiv belonging to a Proxy she killed, and the AutoReiv pursues her. The AutoReiv goes into a self-detonation mode, and Iggy sacrifices himself to protect Re-l, leaving little more than his broken head behind (which leaves Iggy conscious to some extent). In the end, not wanting to see Iggy suffer due to the virus, Re-l shoots him and buries his head. ; : :The newly appointed Director-General of the , who reports directly to the Regent. He and his wife took Pino as a surrogate child prior to the beginning of the series. Initially loyal to the system, he comes to despise the ruling order responsible for the city's slow decay and lashes out destructively. His mentality also slowly degenerates, as he frequently has hallucinations of a smirking Vincent Law close by. He is quite skilled and accurate with a pistol (as shown in the beginning scenes of episode 17). He eventually ends up wounded when \\"Real\\" Mayer, a clone of the original Re-l, attacks him. He then goes in search for Pino, his only surviving loved one, but is knocked aside by an infected armed AutoReiv and falls on a large shard of glass. He eventually dies from the wound and is found by his Entourage, Kristeva. ; : :Raul Creed's Entourage AutoReiv, Kristeva carries out her duties to Raul loyally. She later takes up the role of being Pino's guardian, per Raul's request. It is strongly implied at the end of the series that she is infected with the Cogito Virus, though her new raison d'être, Pino, allows her to keep her sanity. ; : :Chief physician leading the Proxy Research Team, Director of the , and Re-l Mayer's personal physician. Daedalus displays a strange obsession for Re-l Mayer. He has two Entourages, Deleuze and Guattari. In the final episodes, Daedalus has been revealed to have created a fake Re-l (named \\"Real\\" Mayer) from Monad Proxy's Amrita Cells as a replacement for the original Re-l and eventually gives her wings. Now mentally unstable, he no longer cares what happens to the world. The fake Re-l is taken over by Monad Proxy and leaves. Daedalus, concluding that Re-l has always left him behind, is crushed to death by falling rubble. He survives long enough to witness his clone Re-l be incinerated by sunlight. He is named after Daedalus, a figure from Greek mythology and father of Icarus. ; :Berkeley: :: :Husserl: :Lacan: :The elderly debilitated (also ) of Romdo City. He speaks by proxy through the voices of 4 Entourages in the form of stone statues (called, as a group, the Council, the and the ) named after famous philosophers: Derrida, Lacan, Husserl and Berkeley. These AutoReivs appear as Michelangelo's statues from the Medici Chapel, two resting on either side of Donov's chamber. Donov is Re-l's grandfather. He is murdered in Episode 21 by Proxy One, and his Entourage presumably perishes when his house collapses. Other characters =Romdeau Dome City= ; : :Vincent's Entourage AutoReiv. She is killed in Episode 3 by attacking AutoReivs. ;Petro Seller : :Vincent's boss. He dies in the final episodes. He bears a bizarre resemblance to Adolf Hitler ;Cage Seal : :Re-l's boss. ;Samantha Ross : :Raul Creed's wife. She is accidentally killed by Monad Proxy during her chase after Vincent along with her newborn child. =The Commune= ; : :The self- appointed leader of the Commune and a compulsive liar. He is intent on getting all the outcasts of Romdo back into the city. He is executed by drones upon arriving at Romdo Dome Bay in Re-l's AHT. (episode 6) ; : :A woman who lives in the Commune. Some consider her weird. She has a son, Timothy, who is killed. Though she manages to hold off the drone onslaught, she suffers a fatal wound during the firefight and dies in episode 6. ; : :Quinn's son and a friend of Pino. Shot through the head by a drone in episode 5. ;The Three Villagers : : : :A trio of aged villagers. One is a middle-aged man, another an aged man with grey-brown hair, and an old woman wearing a hat. The old woman is shot dead by aquatic drones, her hat remaining. The men survive but die in the wasteland, buried by Vincent. =Proxies= (from a word meaning \\"one who acts for another\\") is the name for 300 dark-skinned humanoid beings with near-godlike powers created by the original humans thousands of years prior to the start of the series to watch over the ruined Earth. Each Proxy is the overseer of a dome city and has total control over it. By design, direct sunlight is fatal to Proxies, since they would become obsolete once the planet healed and the original humans returned. Proxies are otherwise incredibly resilient and immortal thanks to \\"Amrita Cells.\\" It is also implied that a dome city will suffer and eventually die off if it does not have a Proxy watching over it. ;Ergo Proxy (Vincent Law) : :Agent of Death and the series' titular character. Ergo Proxy is a \\"clone\\" of Proxy One, Romdo's creator and guardian, who was created to help bring about the destruction of the human race because of Proxy One's anger at humanity's treatment of and plans for the Proxies, specifically Monad Proxy. Ergo Proxy often wears a white mask with elements of both The Phantom of the Opera and a harlequin jester to differentiate from Proxy One. Vincent initially has no control over his transformations, changing into Ergo Proxy whenever another Proxy reveals itself, but is implied to be in control of his abilities by the end of the series. ;Kazkis Proxy (Kazkis Hauer) : :Agent of Sunlight; Creator and Supervisor of Asura Dome. In his human form, he's an alcoholic with a predilection for red wine (though as a Proxy, he cannot become inebriated). He and Senex Proxy built opposing towers in their respective, connected cities and had hoped to eventually unite. With these plans foiled by her death, he sees Vincent as her replacement but becomes enraged when he realizes that the latter has no recollection of his past. In the ensuing battle, he forces Vincent to come to terms with his true nature as a Proxy, but is mortally wounded in the process. He chooses to perish in the fire he created and spiritually reunites with Senex. ;Senex Proxy : Agent of Moonlight; Creator and Supervisor of Halos Dome. She takes the shape of a female and has feeler- like strips that extend from her head. These are used as her primary means of attack via skewering. She is defeated by Ergo Proxy in episode 8. ;Monad Proxy : :Creator and Supervisor of Mosk Dome; Proxy Thirteen. Entrusted with the memories of Ergo Proxy. Killed by Ergo Proxy early in the series, but is reborn in Daedalus Yumena's Re-l clone, \\"Real\\" Mayer, possessing white hair and golden eyes like her original body's. Has the ability to sprout wings from her back like an angel. Willingly flies into direct sunlight (fatal to Proxies) after saying goodbye to Vincent, mirroring the story of Icarus. Her original body is implied to have been tampered with by Romdo's scientists when she was captured, evidenced by the patchwork patterns on her body and the heavy metal collar with a vial of unknown liquid attached to her neck. ;Proxy One : :The main antagonist of the series, he is Ergo Proxy's original and true self, and calls Vincent his shadow. He was first alluded to in episode 15 and is the one behind the events of the entire series, having created Vincent and then sent him back to Romdo from Mosk to start his revenge plan. Near the end of the series, Proxy One is revealed to be the one who fired the thermonuclear missile Rapture, destroyed Amnesia to hide Vincent's memories, and killed Donov Mayer. He is killed by a combination of Vincent's attacks and sunlight. In spite of his demise he arguably achieves his ultimate goal and leaves Vincent as a legacy who survives the sunlight going against the \\"creator's\\" original plans. ;\\"Swan\\" : :A mysterious Proxy who invades Vincent's dreams. Her motives are unclear. It is implied that \\"Swan\\" may actually be Monad Proxy reaching out to Vincent. ;Will B. Good : :Proxy and creator of all the characters in Smile Land. He resembles Walt Disney, with Smile Land resembling Disneyland and its characters being drawn in early Disney style. ;Unknown Proxies :Two Proxies appear in the series but are never named. A large Proxy that lived in the wilderness with an AutoReiv, their home appeared to be the ruins of an artificial womb system, so there may have been a city there at one point. This Proxy is killed by Re-l when she shot it using the special bullets designed to kill Proxies. The other is a proxy whose true form is never seen. It lived in a dome where it had killed all the inhabitants for not accepting it. This Proxy had the ability to assume the form of other humans and proxies, copying Vincent and Re-l, but not Pino, as she was an AutoReiv. Vincent killed this Proxy in the lake at the center of the dome. =Halos Dome City= ;Commander Patecatl : :Seen in episode 8, he is the leader of the human survivors of Halos Dome City, who are trying to protect their city's artificial birthing system from the invading AutoReivs. He takes Vincent and Pino in, enlists Vincent's help in their war efforts, and decides to convert the Rabbit into a battle ship. He and his lieutenant later imprison Pino and Vincent when two soldiers are inexplicably killed. Realizing their inevitable defeat, he deserts his forces during the final attack but is killed by Senex Proxy before he can escape on the chopper. ;Lieutenant Omacatl : :Commander Patecatl's second in command. ;Mayahuel : :A crazed prisoner in the cell next to Vincent and Pino, she is obsessed with the \\"Master of the Moon\\" (who is later revealed to be Senex Proxy). She is skewered by debris when the chopper brought down by Senex crashes on her. Although dying, she narrates the ensuing battle between Ergo and Senex and draws her last breath moments after Senex's defeat. =The Game Show= ;MCQ : :Host of the show. Revealed as a proxy upon his death in the end of episode 15. ;AD : =Mosk Dome City= ;Amnesia : :An AutoReiv that was entrusted to be the Memory Guardian for Ergo Proxy. Amnesia was entrusted with Ergo Proxy's intentionally lost memories back in an underground layer in Mosk that was only accessible by using a Proxy pendant. However, Proxy One had entered the area before Vincent had and destroyed Amnesia to ensure that no memories are obtained by Vincent (as all of them revealed his true nature as a part of Proxy One). He is last seen broken on his chair with a Proxy pendant (marked with the Roman Numeral I as opposed to Vincent's XIII) attached to his neck, repeating the phrase \\"That which is divided, must become one\\". His final words hinted at them to return to Romdeau. =Smile Land= ;Will B. Good : :The creator of all the characters in Smile Land. His conversation with Pino reveals himself as a proxy governing Smile Land. ;Al : ;Pull : ;Rogi : :Rogi is a created cricket by Will B.

Often a breezeway is a simple roof connecting two structures (such as a house and a garage); sometimes it can be much more like a tunnel with windows on either side. It may also refer to a hallway between two wings of a larger building – such as between a house and a garage – that lacks heating and cooling but allows sheltered passage.

In business, overhead or overhead expense refers to an ongoing expense of operating a business. Overheads are the expenditure which cannot be conveniently traced to or identified with any particular cost unit, unlike operating expenses such as raw material and labor. Therefore, overheads cannot be immediately associated with the products or services being offered, thus do not directly generate profits. However, overheads are still vital to business operations as they provide critical support for the business to carry out profit making activities. For example, overhead costs such as the rent for a factory allows workers to manufacture products which can then be sold for a profit. Such expenses are incurred for output generally and not for particular work order; e.g., wages paid to watch and ward staff, heating and lighting expenses of factory, etc. Overheads are also very important cost element along with direct materials and direct labor. Overheads are often related to accounting concepts such as fixed costs and indirect costs. Overhead expenses are all costs on the income statement except for direct labor, direct materials, and direct expenses. Overhead expenses include accounting fees, advertising, insurance, interest, legal fees, labor burden, rent, repairs, supplies, taxes, telephone bills, travel expenditures, and utilities. There are essentially two types of business overheads: administrative overheads and manufacturing overheads.  Administrative overheads  Administrative overheads include items such as utilities, strategic planning, and various supporting functions. These costs are treated as overheads due to the fact that they aren't directly related to any particular function of the organization nor does it directly result in generating any profits. Instead, these costs simply take on the role of supporting all of the business' other functions. Universities regularly charge administrative overhead rates on research. In the U.S. the average overhead rate is 52%, which is spent on building operation, administrative salaries and other areas not directly tied to research.Tracy Jan. Research giants win on federal funding: Fend off US bid to cut overhead payments. Boston Globe. March 18, 2013. https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2013/03/17/harvard-mit-and-other- research-schools-thwart-obama-administration-effort-cap-overhead- payments/Nk5PT0Mc8MQZihFVNs5gNK/story.html Academics have argued against these charges. For example, Benjamin Ginsberg showed how overhead rates are primarily used to subsidize ballooning administrative salaries and building depreciation, neither of which directly benefit research; although it does benefit the administrators that determine university policy in his book The Fall of Faculty. An article written by Joshua Pearce in Science argued that overhead accounting practices hurt science by removing funds from research and discouraging the use of less-expensive open source hardware. He went into detail on the accounting showing how millions were wasted each year on overhead cash grabs by university administrators in ZME Science. How Antiquated Accounting Costs American Science Millions a Year. ZME Science 3.9.2016. = Examples =  Employee salaries  This includes mainly monthly and annual salaries that are agreed upon. They are considered overheads as these costs must be paid regardless of sales and profits of the company. In addition, salary differs from wage as salary is not affected by working hours and time, therefore will remain constant. In particular, this would more commonly apply to more senior staff members as they are typically signed to longer tenure contracts, meaning that their salaries are more commonly predetermined.  Office equipment and supplies  This includes office equipment such as printer, fax machine, computers, refrigerator, etc. They are equipment that do not directly result in sales and profits as they are only used for supporting functions that they can provide to business operations. However, equipment can vary between administrative overheads and manufacturing overheads based on the purpose of which they are using the equipment. For example, for a printing company a printer would be considered a manufacturing overhead.  External legal and audit fees  This includes the cost of hiring external law and audit firms on behalf of the company. This would not apply if company has own internal lawyers and audit plans. Due to regulations and necessary annual audits to ensure a satisfactory work place environment, these costs often cannot be avoided. Also, since these costs do not necessarily contribute directly to sales, they are considered as indirect overheads. Although in most cases necessary, these costs can sometimes be avoided and reduced.  Company cars  Many companies provide usage of company cars as a perk for their employees. Since these cars do not contribute directly to sales and profits, they are considered an overhead. Similar company perks that are a one-off or constant payment such as partner contract fees with a gym will also fall under administrative overheads.  Travel and entertainment costs  This will include company-paid business travels and arrangements. As well as refreshments, meals, and entertainment fees during company gatherings. Although one might argue that these costs motivate workers to become more productive and efficient, the majority of economists agree that these costs do not directly contribute to sales and profits, therefore shall be categorized as an administrative overhead. Despite these costs occurring periodically and sometimes without prior preparation, they are usually one-off payments and are expected to be within the company's budget for travel and entertainment.  Manufacturing overheads  Manufacturing overheads are all costs endured by a business that is within the physical platform in which the product or service is created. Difference between manufacturing overheads and administrative overheads is that manufacturing overheads are categorized within a factory or office in which the sale takes place. Whilst administrative overheads is typically categorized within some sort of back- office or supporting office. Although there are cases when the two physical buildings may overlap, it is the usage of the overheads that separates them. = Examples =  Employee salaries  Although the general concept is identical to the example under administrative overheads, the key difference is the role of the employee. In the case of manufacturing overheads, employees would have roles such as maintenance personnel, manufacturing managers, materials management staff, and quality control staff. It would also include the set wages for janitorial staff members. Once again, the key difference lies in the nature of their respective jobs and the physical location in which their jobs are carried out.  Depreciation of assets and equipment  This refers to the reduction in value of equipments as it becomes older and more obsolete. For example, if a printer has a potential useful life span of 5 years, the amount that it can be sold for will decrease each year. Therefore, this value in depreciation is calculated as a manufacturing overhead. Moreover, this also applies to vehicles as they tend to depreciate in value significantly after the first year. When calculating manufacturing overheads, accountants mainly use two methods: straight-line method and declining balance method.  Property taxes on production facilities  Every single property unless government owned is subject to some form of property tax. Therefore, the taxes on production factories are categorized as manufacturing overheads as they are costs which cannot be avoided nor cancelled. In addition, property taxes do not change in relation to the business's profits or sales and will likely remain the same unless a change by the government administration. The rent for factory buildings is considered a manufacturing overhead  Rent of factory building  Unless the business decides to purchase land and build its own factory, it will be subject to some sort of rent due to the amount of capital required to build a privately owned factory. Therefore, this rent must be paid to the landlord on a regular basis regardless of the performance of the business. Although the rent for the building provides the physical platform for the company to produce its products and services, it is not a direct contributor.  Utilities for factory  This would vary depending on how the utility bill is structured. In the case of it being an overhead, the utility bill is pre-negotiated meaning that the monthly utility bill will be the same regardless of the amount in which the factory actually consumes. This will only be relevant in various countries where there is an option for standardized utility bills. However, due to the vast consumption of electricity, gas, and water in most factories, most companies tend to not have standardized utility bills as it tends to be more expensive. Standardized utility bills are also oftentimes discouraged by governments as it leads to wastage of resources and negative externalities of production.  Application of business overheads  For most businesses, business overheads are calculated by accountants for budgeting purposes but also often so the business has an idea of how much they must charge consumers in order to make a profit. The following are common accounting tools which take account of business overheads. A standard break- even analysis chart = Break-even analysis = The break-even analysis determines the point which the business's revenue is equivalent to the costs required to receive that revenue. It first calculates a margin of safety (the point which the revenue exceeds the break-even point) as that is the \\"safe\\" amount which the revenue can fall whilst still remaining to be above the break-even point. The graph on the right shows a typical break-even chart. Contribution refers to sales of the product or service, it can also be interpreted as the business's revenue stream. Fixed costs in this case serves the same purpose as business overheads, it will simply be shown as a straight horizontal line on the graph as shown. = Shut-down graph = In economics, revenue curves are often illustrated to show whether or not a business should stay in business, or shut down. In theory, if a business is able cover variable operational costs but unable to cover business overheads in the short run, the business should remain in business. On the other hand, if the business is not even able to cover operational costs, it should shut down. Although this rule largely differs depending on the size of the business, the business's cash-flow, and the competitive nature of the business, it serves as a model rule for most small competitive businesses to operate on. =Activity- based costing= Activity-based costing (ABC) aims to reduce the proportion of costs treated as overheads by allocating costs to each activity involved in the production of a product or delivery of a service.Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (2006), Activity Based Costing: Topic Gateway Series No. 1, accessed 25 February 2019 = Balance sheet = Balance sheet is a financial statement which outlines a company's financial assets, liabilities, and shareholder's equity at a specific time. Both assets and liabilities are separated into two categories depending on their time frame; current and long- term. Business overheads in particular fall under current liabilities as they are costs for which the company must pay on a relatively short-term/immediate basis. Although the balance sheet by itself does not offer much information, it is a useful piece of financial information when combined with other documents such as the income statement or ratio analysis as it offers a diverse and well-rounded description of the company's financial position.

It is the ethyl ester of acrylic acid. It is a colourless liquid with a characteristic acrid odor. It is mainly produced for paints, textiles, and non-woven fibers. It is also a reagent in the synthesis of various pharmaceutical intermediates. Production Ethyl acrylate is produced by acid-catalysed esterification of acrylic acid, which in turn is produced by oxidation of propylene. It may also be prepared from acetylene, carbon monoxide and ethanol by a Reppe reaction. Commercial preparations contain a polymerization inhibitor such as hydroquinone, phenothiazine, or hydroquinone ethyl ether. Reactions and uses =Precursor to polymers and other monomers= Ethyl acrylate is used in the production of polymers including resins, plastics, rubber, and denture material.Ethyl acrylate Hazardous Substance Fact Sheet, New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services Ethyl acrylate is a reactant for homologous alkyl acrylates (acrylic esters) by transesterification with higher alcohols through acidic or basic catalysis. In that way speciality acrylates are made accessible, e.g. 2-ethylhexyl acrylate (from 2-ethylhexanol) used for pressure-sensitive adhesives, cyclohexyl acrylate (from cyclohexanol) used for automotive clear lacquers, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (from ethylene glycol) which is crosslinkable with diisocyanates to form gels used with long-chain acrylates (from C18+ alcohols) as comonomer for comb polymers for reduction of the solidification point of paraffin oils and 2-dimethylaminoethyl acrylate (from dimethylaminoethanol) for the preparation of flocculants for sewage clarification and paper production. As a reactive monomer, ethyl acrylate is used in homopolymers and copolymers with e.g. ethene, acrylic acid and its salts, amides and esters, methacrylates, acrylonitrile, maleic esters, vinyl acetate, vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, styrene, butadiene and unsaturated polyesters. Copolymers of acrylic acid ethyl ester with ethene (EPA/ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymers) are suitable as adhesives and polymer additives, just like ethene vinyl acetate copolymers. Copolymers with acrylic acid increase the cleaning effect of liquid detergents, copolymers with methacrylic acid are used as gastric juices tablet covers (Eudragit). The large number of possible comonomer units and their combination in copolymers and terpolymers with ethyl acrylate allows the realization of different properties of the acrylate copolymers in a variety of applications in paints and adhesives, paper, textile and leather auxiliaries together with cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. =As Michael acceptor and HX acceptor= Ethyl acrylate reacts with amines catalyzed by Lewis acids in a Michael addition to β-alanine derivatives in high yields: Michael addition of an amine to ethyl acrylate The nucleophilic addition at ethyl acrylate as an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound is a frequent strategy in the synthesis of pharmaceutical intermediates.

Vollhardt, N.E. Schore, Organische Chemie, 5. Aufl., Wiley-VCH, 2012, Natural occurrence Ethyl acrylate is also used as a flavoring agent. It has been found as a volatile component in pineapples and Beaufort cheese and is a secondary component in vanilla flavor obtained from heat extraction of vanilla in amounts of up to 1 ppm. In such high concentrations it negatively affects the extracted aroma.Sensory-Directed Flavor Analysis, Ray Marsili edit., CRC Press, Taylor & Francis Group, Boca Raton, 2007, Safety The International Agency for Research on Cancer stated, \\"Overall evaluation, ethyl acrylate is possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B).\\"IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans, Volume 71, International Agency for Research on Cancer (1999) The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) states, \\"Human studies on occupational exposure to ethyl acrylate... have suggested a relationship between exposure to the chemical(s) and colorectal cancer, but the evidence is conflicting and inconclusive. In a study by the National Toxicology Program (NTP), increased incidences of squamous cell papillomas and carcinomas of the forestomach were observed in rats and mice exposed via gavage (experimentally placing the chemical in the stomach). However, the NTP recently determined that these data were not relevant to human carcinogenicity since humans do not have a forestomach, and removed ethyl acrylate from its list of carcinogens.\\"EPA Technology Transfer Network, Air Toxics Web Site , United States Environmental Protection Agency (accessed 2008) (Occupational exposure generally involves exposure that occurs regularly, over an extended period of time.) It is toxic in large doses, with an LD50 (rats, oral) of 1020 mg/kg, and day to day continuous exposure to 5 ppm is considered safe. As of October 2018, the FDA withdrew authorization for its use as a synthetic flavoring substance in food, without regard to its continuing stance that this substance does not pose a risk to public health under the conditions of its intended use. One favorable safety aspect is that ethyl acrylate has good warning properties; the odor threshold is much lower than any level of health concern. In other words, the bad odor warns people of ethyl acrylate's presence long before the concentration reaches a level capable of creating a serious health risk. Reports of the exact levels vary somewhat, but, for example, the U.S. E.P.A. reports an odor threshold of 0.0012 parts per million (ppm), but the E.P.A.'s lowest level of health concern, the Acute Exposure Guideline Level-1 (AEGL-1) is 8.3 ppm, which is almost 7000 times the odor threshold.

Life Spiegelberg was born in Strasbourg, in the Alsatian region of northeastern France. He studied at the universities of Heidelberg, Freiburg, and Munich, where he encountered Edmund Husserl and many others in the vanguard of the European phenomenological movement. He received his Ph.D. in 1928 from the University of Munich. His doctoral dissertation was written under the direction of the phenomenologist Alexander Pfänder and was titled Gesetz und Sittengesetz (Law and Morality). In 1937 Spiegelberg left the continent and studied for a year in England before emigrating to the United States. In the U. S., he taught first at Swarthmore College and then at Lawrence University, which later awarded him an honorary doctoral degree. In 1953-54 and 1955-56 he received grants from the Rockefeller Foundation for the preparation of the first edition of his landmark historical survey, The Phenomenological Movement: A Historical Introduction. In 1963, he relocated to Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri and remained there until his retirement as Emeritus Professor in 1971. He also served as visiting professor at the universities of Michigan and Southern California and as Fulbright Lecturer at the University of Munich. Spiegelberg conducted five influential workshops in phenomenology, during the summers of 1965, 1966, 1967, 1969, and 1972. The first workshop was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation and the second by a grant from the Monsanto Company. In 1981 Washington University established a series of lectures in phenomenology in his honor. Herbert Spiegelberg died of leukemia, at the age of 86, at his home in St. Louis, Missouri. His collected papers are available in the archives of the Washington University Libraries. Philosophy Spiegelberg played a major role in the development of interest in phenomenology in America.

In each film food writer Gates explores unusual food stories in some of the world's more dangerous places. He uses food to explore and understand people's culture and the challenges they face. He has eaten such obscure foods as rat in India, baby seal in the Arctic and radioactive soup in Chernobyl. Series three completed filming in October 2007 and it aired on BBC Two in March 2008.  Episodes  =Series One= Afghanistan Stefan cooks his way around Afghanistan, finding out how the country's reconstruction is going. He samples the testicles of the legendary fat-tailed sheep, known to the locals as the \\"Afghan Viagra\\"; narrowly avoids being blown up by abandoned Soviet Scud missiles; and has dinner with a former Taliban commander. South Korea Stefan's in South Korea to find out whether there's anything wrong with eating dogs. He visits a farm where over 2000 dogs are raised for their meat, picks up a few recipes from \\"Dr Dogmeat\\", and hears allegations that dogs are tortured to death. Uganda 18 July 2006 Gates visits refugee camps in war-torn Northern Uganda, to find out how people survive on meagre UN food rations. The UN gives them just 60% of their daily needs. Fiji and Tonga Gates visits the South Pacific to find out why they are over-eating. In Tonga he finds the fattest people on earth (91% are overweight). In Fiji, he tries the local inebriant kava kava and slaughters a piglet for lunch. China 25 July 2006 Gates finds how the rapid pace of modernisation is changing the way people eat. He spends a day working at the Kung Fu fast food joint, samples the menu of a Beijing restaurant, and attempts to shake off his Communist party minders to talk to one of China's poverty-stricken farmers. =Series Two= Chernobyl Gates visits the site of the world's worst ever nuclear disaster to discover how people have survived in its aftermath. Inside the Exclusion Zone, deemed too dangerous to live in, he finds, amongst the ghost towns, a handful of people who have moved back in illegally and live on dangerously contaminated land. Arctic Gates visits the Arctic Circle to spend time with the Inuit living on some of the harshest terrain in the world. He is taken on a seal hunt and tried the local delicacy: eighteen- month-old rotten walrus. India Gates visits the state of Bihar, India’s poorest state to meet the Dalits, or “Untouchables”. These are the lowest group in the Indian caste system. He helps a dalit girl make dung cakes for fuel. Gates joins them as they are about to tuck into one of their few sources of protein: roasted rat which they catch themselves. Otherwise they survive on rice and little else. He then meets the private militia of the landowners in Bihar, who have hired the men to protect their properties from the dalit labourers, who they accuse of stealing from them in communist agitations. Gates then travels west across India by rail towards Mumbai, where he talks to people living in the slums of Mumbai, particularly Biharis who have immigrated in an attempt to make a better living. He talks to a dalit dabawalla, a person who carries lunches from people's homes to their offices at midday. Indians prefer their lunches to be freshly cooked and home-made by their wife or mother, thus creating such an occupation. Venezuela Gates finds a country divided between rich and poor and the country's president, Hugo Chávez, using food handouts as part of his socialist revolution. He helps out in one of the soup kitchens providing food to the poor and he also visits a subsidized food shop where the food is quickly running out much to the anger of those waiting in line. He then travels into the hinterland where he finds the ranch owners furious as Chávez has encouraged the poor to take some of their land and farm it themselves. Burma Gates spends two weeks in the jungle with the Karen people who are being hunted by the Burmese army who are starving them out of their villages.

Turner Construction was founded in New York City in 1902 by Henry Chandlee Turner. Its first project was a $690 concrete vault in Brooklyn, followed by concrete staircases for the New York City Subway. By the late 1920s, Turner was constructing buildings for large businesses in the United States. Turner's stock began trading on the American Stock Exchange in 1972. Turner's projects have included large buildings and numerous sports stadiums. Then, in 1999, HOCHTIEF purchased Turner. In 2010s, the company was involved in a multi-year bid rigging scheme related to interior work at Bloomberg L.P. resulting in its then vice president Ronald Olson to plead guilty to federal charge of tax evasion on accepting $1.5 million in bribes from subcontractors and then project superintendent Vito Nigro to plead guilty to grand larceny.

History =Early years= In 1902, Henry Chandlee Turner (b. 1871) founded Turner Construction Company with $25,000 in start-up capital, at 11 Broadway, in New York City. Turner's first job was a $690 project to build a concrete vault for Thrift Bank in the borough of Brooklyn. In 1904, a Scottish industrialist named Robert Gair hired Turner Construction to build several concrete buildings in Brooklyn, including a plant that was recognized as the largest reinforced concrete building in the United States at the time. Around the same time the company was developing plans for the Gair building, Turner began building concrete staircases for the New York City Subway. The original design showed the stairs were to be made of steel, but Turner persuaded Gair to use concrete as an alternative. His proposal was applauded and led to contracts for staircases and platforms for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company's first subway line. The company established branch offices in Philadelphia in 1907, followed by Buffalo in 1908, and Boston in 1916. Within the first 15 years, Turner Construction Company constructed buildings for some of the country's largest businesses, including a building for Western Electric and 26 Broadway for Standard Oil. From World War I to the Great Depression, the company's billings grew to nearly $44 million. Like most industries, construction suffered during the economic collapse and Turner's volume fell to $2.5 million by 1933. The company recovered and revenues increased to $12 million by 1937. The company suspended commercial construction during the war years, focusing instead on the construction of military camps, factories, and government buildings. In 1941, Henry Turner stepped down as president to serve as chairman and make room for his brother, Archie Turner, as president. In October 1946, Henry Turner retired as chairman, handing the post to his ailing brother. For his replacement, Archie Turner selected Admiral Ben Moreell, the individual responsible for forming the Seabees. One month after Moreell's appointment, Archie Turner died of a heart attack. =1950s–80s= Turner, together with three other main contractors Fuller, Slattery, Walsh built the United Nations Secretariat Building in New York, which was completed in 1952. Also in same city, Turner built the One Chase Manhattan Plaza in 1956. During the 1960s, notable projects included the Lincoln Center and Madison Square Garden in 1967. From the early 1950s to the late 1960s, the company opened offices in Cincinnati, Los Angeles, Cleveland, and San Francisco. In 1969, Turner issued over-the-counter stock and in 1972, the company's stock began trading on the American Stock Exchange. Throughout the 1970s, the company added offices in locations such as Atlanta, Seattle, and Portland. Notable projects included the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Hospital in 1974 and the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Library in 1977. Howard Sinclair Turner became president in 1965, and was chairman from 1970 to 1977, when he was succeeded by Walter B. Shaw. In 1984, Shaw appointed Herbert Conant as president. = 1990–present = The John F. Kennedy Library Turner Construction Company erected several professional sports stadiums during the 1990s. Sports construction was not new to the company: Turner's first sports contract was construction of the promenade at Harvard Stadium in 1910, followed by Pitt Stadium for the University of Pittsburgh in 1925.Turner News: Centennial edition Turner Construction, 2002 In 1995, the company completed construction of the Rose Garden in Portland, Oregon. In 1996, they built Charlotte, North Carolina's Bank of America Stadium, followed by completion of Sports Authority Field at Mile High in 2001. In August 1999, Hochtief AG of Germany purchased The Turner Corporation for $370 million.Hochtief agrees to buy Turner for Euros350.1m Business International, 1999 By extension, Turner Construction Company gained access to HOCHTIEF's operations in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the heavy construction field. In 2002, Turner Construction expanded its presence in the Washington, D.C. area by acquiring J.A. Jones- Tompkins Builders, Inc., the former subsidiary of J.A. Jones Construction Company. Tompkins Builders, Inc., a new entity, is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Turner Construction.CapNet leaves nest Washington Business Journal, 8 August 2003 By 2016, Turner had 45 office locations around the world. In August 2017, Turner Construction flouted permit regulations and unlawfully closed two lanes in middle of downtown Portland, Oregon. In response, the city withheld inspection until the fine was paid off and the behavior prompted city transportation commissioner Dan Saltzman to issue the following statements: > \\"Amidst one of the busiest summer construction seasons in recent memory, I’m > disappointed at the blatant disregard for the public,\\" \\"For a private > construction company to block a lane during rush hour, delaying thousands of > people and undermining our efforts to reduce traffic congestion is > unacceptable,\\" Saltzman said in the statement. \\"We will hold them > accountable.\\"  Bid rigging scheme in 2010s  In February 2018, investigators with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office started looking into Turner Construction and Bloomberg over a suspected $100 million construction fraud. There was conspiracy, bribery and kickbacks involved. which occurred between 2010-2017. In a multi-year bribery and bid rigging scheme involving Turner, a former Turner vice president, Ronald Olson, pleaded guilty to bribery in July 2020. Olson pleaded guilty to tax evasion for US$1.5 million he received in connection with Bloomberg jobs while he was working for Turner. He received bribes from subcontractors in exchanging for awarding them contracts for Bloomberg L.P. projects. He was one of 14 individuals facing charges over this scandal. Operations Exterior of Invesco Field at Mile High on November 2004 Turner has 46 offices in the U.S., is active in 20 countries around the world, and averages 1,500 projects per year. Turner services include construction management, general contracting, consulting, construction procurement, insurance, and risk management. According to Engineering News- Record's 2014 Top 400 Contractors Sourcebook, Turner is the largest \\"Green contractor\\" in the United States. 2019 Cincinnati 3CDC site death  One worker was killed and four were injured in a partial collapse on November 25, 2019 in the 14 story luxury apartment at 4th & Race under construction in Cincinnati that is being built by Turner for Cincinnati Center City Development Corporation (3CDC) and Flaherty & Collins. Cement was being poured onto seventh floor which was being supported from below on a temporary structure called \\"shoring\\" placed on the sixth floor. Workers were inspecting for cement seepage from sixth floor when the floor above collapsed from the weight of cement. A worker has gone missing in the collapse who was found dead more than a day later in the rubble. Turner's previous fatality was in 2012 in Hillsboro, Oregon.

Its structure is achieved by drafting two arcs which rise steeply from each springing point on a small radius, and then turning into two arches with a wide radius and much lower springing point. It is a pointed sub-type of the general flattened depressed arch. Two of the most notable types are known as the Persian arch, which is moderately \\"depressed\\", and the Tudor arch, which is much flatter. This type of arch uses space efficiently and decoratively when used for doorways. It is also employed as a wall decoration in which arcade and window openings form part of the whole decorative surface. Tudor arch at Layer Marney Tower, 1520s Persian arches on the Si-o-se-pol bridge, Isfahan, c. 1600 The 17th century Buland Darwaza at Fatehpur Sikri has a four-centred archway with vaulted iwan. It is a mainstay of Islamic architecture, especially Persian and Mughal architecture; in the latter the lowest arches often have scalloped edges. In Asia it typically has a less depressed form than in \\"Tudor\\"-style examples. In English architecture, it is often known as a Tudor arch, as it was a common architectural element during the reigns of the Tudor dynasty (1485–1603), though its use predates 1485 by several decades, and from about 1550 it was out of fashion for grand buildings. It is a blunted version of the pointed arch of Gothic architecture, of which Tudor architecture is the last phase in England.Augustus Pugin, Specimens of Gothic Architecture: Selected from Various Ancient Edifices in England, 1821, Volumes 1-2, google books. Use in Islamic architecture The four-centered arch is widely used in Islamic architecture, originally employed by the Abbasids and especially that of Persianate cultures, including Mughal architecture as well as Persian architecture. For example, almost all iwans use this type of arch. It was especially common in the architecture of the Timurid Empire and its successor states. The earliest examples of a four- centered arch are in the portals of the Qubbat al-Sulaiybiyya, an octagonal pavilion, and the Qasr al-'Ashiq palace, both at Samarra, where the Abbasid caliphs constructed a purpose-built capital city for their empire in the 9th century.Petersen, A.

Use in English architecture The Tudor arch was especially used for doorways, where it gives a wide opening without taking too much space above, compared to a more pointed Gothic arch. In Tudor architecture of the grander sort it is so used when the window openings are rectangular, as for example at Hampton Court Palace. In such cases it can be even flatter than usual, and may not be four-centered in terms of geometry, with some of the upper edges effectively straight. A notable early example is the west window of Gloucester Cathedral. There are three royal chapels and one chapel-like Abbey which show the style at its most elaborate: King's College Chapel, Cambridge; St George's Chapel, Windsor; Henry VII's Chapel at Westminster Abbey, and Bath Abbey. However, numerous simpler buildings, especially churches, built during the wool boom in East Anglia, also demonstrate the style. When employed to frame a large church window, it lends itself to very wide spaces, decoratively filled with many narrow vertical mullions and horizontal transoms. The overall effect produces a grid-like appearance of regular, delicate, rectangular forms with an emphasis on the perpendicular, characteristic of the style, known as Perpendicular Gothic in England, of the 15th and early 16th centuries. This is very similar to contemporary Spanish style in particular. In buildings such as Hampton Court the Tudor arch is found together with the first appearance of Renaissance architecture in England, much later than in Italy. In the later period it is generally only used for major decorative windows, perhaps in an oriel window, or a bay window supported on a bracket or corbel.

It was dedicated to two saints associated with the city of Camerino: Venantius of Camerino, a martyr; and Ansovinus, bishop of Camerino. The church was also called SS Venanzio ed Ansovino de' Camerinesi. Description The original church at the site was named San Giovanni Battista in Mercatello, after a marketplace here, moved later to Piazza Navona. In 1542, Pope Paul III granted the church to a confraternity, and later to Basilian Monks from the Abbey of Grottaferrata. They in turn ceded it to the Confraternity of the Camerinesi. Under their ownership, Antonio Liborio Raspantini refurbished the church. The main altar was designed by Giovanni Battista Contini, and the main altarpiece by Luigi Garzi. Side paintings were by Agostino Masucci. The ceiling of the apse was frescoed by Pasqualini. Garzi also painted a Virgin with Saints Charles and Phillip. Antonio Gherardi designed and decorated a chapel with a canvas depicting St Anne. The chapel also had a Birth of the Virgin by Michelangiolo Cerruti, and a painting by Antonio Grecolini.Guida metodica di Roma e suoi contorni, by Giuseppe Melchiorri, Rome (1836); page 425.

The tract was granted in 1764 by Lieutenant Governor Cadwallader Colden of the New York crown colony, in the name of King George III to the board of governors (trustees) of King's College – the predecessor of today's Columbia University and the Canadian University of King's College. The grant was intended for the eventual expansion of the college. The emergence of the Vermont Republic in 1777 forestalled claim of the grant, and Vermont's General Assembly made a grant of the same land in 1785 to William Samuel Johnson, an American founding father and jurist who informally represented Vermont before the Continental Congress and argued for its eventual admission to the federal union. By coincidence the association with King's College (Columbia University) continued, as Johnson became president of then Columbia College in 1787. Though Columbia University never moved to King's College Tract, eventually a college was located there.

The bombings heightened tensions in the country following the Cedar Revolution, and on the eve of the two-year anniversary of the assassination of Rafic Hariri. The bombings On Tuesday, February 13, 2007, a bomb exploded on a bus transporting 26 people from Bteghrine to the Lebanese mountain village of Ain Alaq. A second bus following behind stopped, and then a bomb on that bus exploded. Killed were Michel Attar (born 1989), Laurice Gemayel, and Mahmoud Hammoud, an Egyptian laborer. A further 21 other people were injured. The two bombings occurred on the eve of a Cedar Revolution rally planned to commemorate the two-year anniversary of the assassination of the former Lebanese prime minister, Rafik Hariri. The bombing occurred less than a mile from the Christian village of Bikfaya, the hometown of the former president, Amin Gemayel, whose son Pierre Gemayel, a cabinet minister and member of the anti-Syrian, March 14 Alliance, was assassinated by gunmen in November. Amin Gemayel, also a member of the March 14 Alliance, had just returned from the United States where he met with president George W. Bush in the White House on February 8, 2007. In addition to scaring the Lebanese from attending the Cedar Revolution the following day, many analysts also saw the bombings in Gemayel's stronghold of Metn as a Syrian warning to Gemayel who was a possible candidate for the Lebanese presidency. The bombings did not deter hundreds of thousands of flag-waving Lebanese, Christians, Muslims, and Druze, to gather in Martyr's Square in Beirut on February 14 to honor Hariri and show support for the anti-Syrian, pro-western government of Fouad Saniora. Reactions *Amnesty International condemned the bombings and accused the perpetrators of the attacks of \\"showing complete disregard for the most fundamental principles of humanity.\\" *Egypt condemned the bombings. *France condemned the bombings. *Germany condemned the bombings. *The United Kingdom condemned the bombings. *Indonesia condemned the killing, calling it an act of terror that would hinder political reconciliation among the Lebanese.People's Daily Online - Indonesia condemns Lebanon bombing *Prime Minister Fouad Siniora promised to pursue the criminals who murdered Attar, Gemayel and Hammoud. He believed that the terrorists were the same forces who assassinated Hariri in 2005. He said that the Lebanese will not be \\"scared or terrorized\\" and the terrorists will be brought to justice. *The leaders of the March 14 Alliance accused the Syrian government of committing the bombings in Ain Alaq to deter the Lebanese from participating in the rally honoring the second anniversary of Hariri's assassination. *The state-controlled media in Syria accused the March 14 Alliance and the anti-Syrian parliament majority of being behind the two bombings.The Daily Star - Politics - Syria blames March 14 for bus bombings as families bury victims *On February 15, 2007, The U.N. condemned the two bombings, and the Security Council agreed to provide Lebanon with technical assistance to help probe the bombing that killed Michel Attar, Laurice Gemayel and Mahmoud Hammoud. Arrests and criminal charges On March 14, 2007, Lebanese Internal Security, better known as the Sûreté Générale du Liban, arrested four Syrians who confessed to the bombings in Ain Alaq. The Lebanese Interior Minister, Hassan Al Sabaa, believed that the four Syrians were members of a radical Palestinian group, Fatah al-Islam, which allegedly has close ties to the Syrian intelligence agency. However, it was still not clear who actually ordered the attack. Syria denied the Lebanese allegations. On June 21, 2007, Lebanese State Prosecutor Saeed Mirza filed charges against 16 Fatah al-Islam suspects accused of carrying out the bombings. Nine of the 16 suspects accused were in custody when the charges were filed; other, including Fatah al-Islam head Shaker al-Abssi were still being sought.

Photograph by Carl Van Vechten Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, Carl Van Vechten Collection, [reproduction number LC-USZ62-132955] Hutchins Harry Hapgood (May 21, 1869, Chicago – November 19, 1944, Provincetown, Massachusetts) was an American journalist, author and anarchist. Life and career Hapgood was born to Charles Hutchins Hapgood (1836–1917) and Fanny Louise (Powers) Hapgood (1846–1922) and grew up in Alton, Illinois, where his father was a wealthy manufacturer of farming equipment. He is the younger brother of the journalist and diplomat Norman Hapgood. After a year at the University of Michigan, he transferred to Harvard University, where he took a B.A. in 1892 and earned his Masters in 1897. Two of the intervening years were spent studying sociology and philosophy at the universities of Berlin and Freiburg, Germany. At first, he became a teacher of English composition at Harvard and the University of Chicago, but was eventually inspired by his older brother, Norman to pursue a career in journalism.Biographical Essay by Dowling, Robert M. American Writers, Supplement XVII. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2008 He obtained his first employment with the New York Commercial Advertiser (later known as the New York Globe). His mentor there was Lincoln Steffens, the muckraking reporter. On June 22, 1899, he married Neith Boyce, Steffens' assistant and a journalist in her own right. In 1904, when the Advertiser was revamped as the Globe, he went back to Chicago for a time and became the drama critic for the Chicago Evening Post. Returning to New York, he spent much of his career as an editorial writer for the New York Evening Post, the Press, and the Globe.David Minter, \\"Hutchins Hapgood,\\" American National Biography, NY: Oxford University, 10 (1999): 34-5. Biographical entry. Following the deaths of his father in 1917 and his eldest son Boyce (in the 1918 flu epidemic), Hapgood's career began to decline. A few years later, general disillusionment over the decadence of the postwar world led him to retire. Hapgood died on November 19, 1944, in Provincetown and was buried in the family plot in East Cemetery, Petersham, Massachusetts.

Born in Hexthorpe, Doncaster he played as a defender primarily for Sheffield United with whom he won the First Division once, the FA Cup twice and gained two caps for England. He then went on to achieve relative success as the manager of Bristol City. Playing career =Club career= Thickitt started his career as a youngster with Doncaster amateur side Hexthorpe Wanderers before being offered an extended trial as a guest player with Sheffield United in 1891 at the age of seventeen. United opted not to sign him after he appeared in five games that season. Following an injury to their captain Ramsey Grey on 21 March 1891, Thickitt was brought in by Doncaster Rovers for the remainder of that season in the Midland Alliance League. After this, he was offered professional terms at nearby Rotherham Town where he became a regular in the first team and appeared in The Football League. Cigarette card depicting Thickitt playing for Sheffield United. By 1893 Sheffield United had become one of the top sides in the country but had not forgotten about Thickitt and signed him from Rotherham Town for £30 in November of that year, two seasons after his initial trial. Thickitt was immediately installed as first choice right back for the Bramall Lane club, a position he retained for almost ten years. Although described at the time as a big, sturdy man he had a surprising turn of speed and this, in conjunction with his tackling and willingness to work hard endeared him to the fans and the club alike. Both he and United enjoyed a spectacularly successful spell during his time there, winning the First Division title in 1898 and finishing runners up on two more occasions, whilst he also gained two FA Cup winners medals in 1899 and 1902 with a runners-up medal sandwiched in between in 1901. In his later years at the club he began to suffer from injuries but was renowned for playing when he shouldn't have, resulting in a story circulated at the time that he had played in the 1899 FA Cup Final swathed in forty yards of bandages and fortified with copious amounts of whiskey! Although the Manchester doctor who had given the story to the press later admitted to have made it up Thickitt's reputation made it easy for supporters to believe. He was also a very moral man, offering to take a pay cut in 1895 because he believed he had missed too many first team games after contracting Typhoid fever. With his career seemingly coming to an end Thickitt eventually transferred to Bristol City in May 1904 where he played on for another season before being appointed manager in 1905. =International career= Thickitt was called up for England in 1899 and made two appearances in the Home Championship, against Wales on 20 March and Scotland on 8 April of that year. Thickitt in an England team photo of 1899. Managerial career Thickitt played for Bristol City in the 1904–05 season when the club was managed by Sam Hollis. He took over as manager in March 1905 after Hollis departed and steered the club to English football's top flight at the first attempt. The most crucial decision he made was probably the re-signing of Billy Wedlock, who had left the club in 1901. In securing promotion from the English Second Division as champions in 1906, Bristol City won 14 league matches in a row (equalling a record set by Manchester United the previous year and only matched since by Preston North End and Arsenal). Bristol City continued to progress under Thickitt's direction; the club ended the 1906–07 season as runners-up in the first division and Thickitt led them to their one and only FA Cup Final appearance against Manchester United in 1909 (a game won 1–0 by United.) City then started to slide and Thickitt's tenure as manager came to an end following a 1–0 defeat away to Notts County in October 1910. Thickitt's last game in charge was halted temporarily by the appearance of an aeroplane which caused much excitement amongst the fans. Reverend J W Marsh, the referee, was so distracted by the appearance of the plane (flown by pioneer aviator Paul de Lesseps) that he held-up play for a while and then ended up recalling the players to the field of play (after he had blown the final whistle) because he had forgotten to add the four minutes or so lost because of the hold-up. Relegated at the end of the 1910–11 season, City didn't play top-flight football again until 1976.

She was also a noted piano teacher who taught many students in the nobility, including the Duchess of Devonshire and her daughters. Biography Before her marriage, Maria Hester Park gave four well-received performances, mostly in the Oxford area,Schleifer, p. 118. on both the piano and the harpsichord.Wollenberg, p. 284. Her first public appearance was at the age of twenty-two as Maria Hester Reynolds in the Hanover Square concert series with a concerto on the harpsichord. She played a Clementi duet with Jane Mary Guest on 29 April 1783, a concerto at Willis's Rooms in March 1784 and a performance as Mrs Park (\\"late Reynolds\\") in May 1791. After her marriage in London in April 1787 to Thomas Park, an engraver turned antiquarian and man of letters, she ended her career as a performer, although she earned even more fame as composer and teacher. Her marriage appears to have been happy; several of her husband's love poems to her still exist. She corresponded with Joseph Haydn, who, on 22 October 1794, sent her a sonata of his composition (Hob. XVI:51) and a thank you letter in exchange for two of her pieces. She died in Hampstead, London at the age of 53, after many years of ill health. The Parks had five daughters and a son. Park's music It has been said of Maria Hester Park that she was \\"hugely popular in the elegant drawing rooms of eighteenth century England\\" and that she \\"made her living composing the sort of music performed by Jane Austen heroines.\\".Interview with Diana Ambache, BBC, Woman's Hour, Monday 1 April 2002, https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/2002_14_mon_03.shtml, Accessed 10 September 2010. She has been described as \\"one of the most prolific of the 18th century women composers.\\" Her works are varied, competent, and professionally arranged. Her sonatas, according to The Norton/Grove dictionary of women composers, are \\"varied and spirited.\\"Sadie, p. 361. Her Sonata in C is stylistically close to Mozart, pleasant to the ear without being overly challenging either to the performer or the listener. Mozartean features apparent in her Sonata in F include a constant bass line of straight eighth notes that form the outlines of chords, and a distinct melody with ornamentation. There are also many basic scale patterns and simple arpeggios, and the majority of her pieces are clean, lacking the melodrama of later romantic works. Her surviving music spans a quarter of a century.

It is nocturnal and an arboreal quadruped, and is not very agile. It produces three types of vocalisation: a squeak, which is high in pitch and is produced with the mouth closed, and is used between infants and their mothers; a whistle, which is higher in pitch than the squeak, so it is hard to hear with human ears, and is used as a communicative and possibly territorial call; and a grunt, which is usually given in series and is very powerful, used when an individual is being attacked in its nest. This species is only known to exist from one museum specimen from Ambositra, north of Fianarantsoa in east-central Madagascar. As of 2010, no studies in the wild have been conducted of the lesser iron-gray dwarf lemur, and it is unknown whether it still survives in this region.

They were originally developed for the Mega Drive/Genesis and Dreamcast video game consoles, and have been ported to numerous systems. The story follows the eponymous Ecco, a bottlenose dolphin, who fights extraterrestrial threats to the world. The games are known for their high difficulty level. Ecco was created by Ed Annunziata, who also produced Chakan: The Forever Man. Games =Ecco the Dolphin= Released in 1992, the original game followed the exploits of a young dolphin named Ecco as he searched the seas, and eventually time itself, for his missing pod. =Ecco: The Tides of Time= Released in 1994, the sequel follows Ecco's exploits after the conclusion of the original game as he travels the oceans, the past, and the future in his quest to save the planet once more. =Ecco Jr.= Released in 1995, this title was intended as edutainment and lacked the sophistication and difficulty of the previous two titles in series. When Ecco and his friends find out Big Blue, a wise and famous whale, is near they must do favors and break crystals in order to pass the stage and find Big Blue. =Ecco Jr. and the Great Ocean Treasure Hunt= Released in 1995, an edutainment game similar to Ecco Jr. on the Sega Genesis, this title was released on the Sega Pico. In this game, Ecco and his friends explore the ocean and the ruins that lie within to find various treasures. This game distinguishes itself by utilizing stylus control for the gameplay. =Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future= Released in 2000, this title reenvisioned the Ecco mythos in a new Earth with a new premise. Storylines and ports The Ecco the Dolphin games can be divided into two distinct storylines: the Mega Drive/Genesis games (Ecco the Dolphin, Ecco: The Tides of Time, and Ecco Jr.) and the Dreamcast game (Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future). Ecco the Dolphin and Ecco: The Tides of Time were both re-released for the Sega CD, Master System and Game Gear, and Defender of the Future was originally released for the Dreamcast and later re-released for the PlayStation 2. The Sega CD version of Ecco the Dolphin was ported to Microsoft Windows in 1995. Ecco the Dolphin was also re-released on the Game Boy Advance as part of the fourth Sega Smash Pack. All of the Mega Drive games have been released on Valve's Steam platform, as well as being ported to Nintendo's Virtual Console and the first game was ported to Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade. Two six-part comic book series of Ecco the Dolphin stories based on the first game were featured in Sonic the Comic. Series one was written by Woodrow Phoenix and drawn by Chris Webster in 1993. Series two followed in 1995. Archie Comics Sonic the Hedgehog series later featured a Dolphin character named Echo thought to be a tribute to this series, though this character was humanoid and female. Legal dispute and after In late 2016 series creator Ed Annunziata reached a settlement with Sega regarding the legal rights to the franchise. The attempt to regain the intellectual property rights, in part, arose from Annunziata's unsuccessful attempt to make a spiritual successor called The Big Blue funded through Kickstarter which could not use the Ecco name. Although the exact details of the settlement were unclear, it was believed by media outlets including Venture Beat that it could pave the way for a new installment in the franchise by Annunziata. Soon thereafter Annunziata himself talked about wanting to revive the series for the Nintendo Switch. Soundtrack Ecco: Songs of Time is a soundtrack album which contains the original soundtrack from the Sega CD versions of Ecco the Dolphin and Ecco: The Tides of Time. It was released on September 3, 1996. The music is composed by Spencer Nilsen. The music is atmospheric and ambient, heavy on high-quality synthesizer, low-frequency percussion and various samples, including dolphin squeaks and squeals. =Track listing= Tracks 1–11 from Ecco: The Tides of Time, tracks 12–18 from Ecco the Dolphin References Category:Scuba diving video games Category:Sega Games franchises Category:Video game franchises introduced in 1992 ","title":"Ecco the Dolphin"},{"id":"9526152","text":"The Method of Factors is a technique in cognitive behavioral therapy to organise a session of exposure therapy.

A former politician, Miller was the 63rd Mayor of Toronto from 2003 to 2010. He entered politics as a member of the New Democratic Party, although his mayoral campaign and terms in office were without any formal party affiliation. He allowed his party membership to lapse in 2007. Miller declined to seek a third term as mayor in the 2010 election, citing family reasons. He subsequently served as an advisor on urban issues at the World Bank from 2011 to 2013. Background Miller was born in San Francisco, California. His American father, Joe Miller, died of cancer in 1960, and his English mother Joan returned with her son to Thriplow, south of Cambridge. Miller spent his earliest years in England before moving to Canada with his mother in 1967. He attended Lakefield College School on a scholarship at the time Prince Andrew was a student there.Grove News: 125th Anniversary Commemorative Edition, Lakefield College School Prince Andrew later wore a \\"Miller for Mayor\\" campaign button during a 2003 stop in Toronto. See \\"Sure bet: Lawyer to be mayor\\", Toronto Star, June 16, 2003, B03. Miller completed a four-year undergraduate degree at Harvard University, graduating summa cum laude in Economics in 1981. He earned a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Toronto Faculty of Law in 1984 and became a partner at the prominent Toronto law firm of Aird & Berlis LLP, specializing in employment, immigration law and shareholder rights. He represented Toronto Islands residents in a 1985 arbitration case while an articling student, and later described this experience as his introduction to municipal politics. He married fellow lawyer Jill Arthur in 1994, and the pair have two children. Miller joined the New Democratic Party (NDP) in 1985.\\"Parkdale-High Park\\", Toronto Star, October 22, 1993, A8. He first ran for Metropolitan Toronto council in 1991, campaigning on a platform of public transit improvements to establish Toronto as a world-class city.Jane Armstrong, \\"The winding, tree- lined avenues of Swansea may seem worlds away...\\", Toronto Star, October 21, 1991. He lost to incumbent councillor Derwyn Shea. Miller was subsequently the NDP's candidate for Parkdale—High Park in the 1993 Canadian federal election, and finished fourth against Liberal incumbent Jesse Flis. He did not renew his membership in the NDP when it expired in 2007, stating that he did not want to be seen as partisan when dealing with the provincial and federal governments. In 2011, he joined NYU Poly as a faculty member. Councillor =Metro councillor= Miller campaigned for the Metro Toronto Council a second time in 1994, and was elected for the High Park ward over former Member of Parliament Andrew Witer and future cabinet minister Tony Clement. Following the election, he was appointed to the Metro Planning and Transportation Committee, the Metro Anti-racism Committee, and the Board of Governors for Exhibition Place.\\"Metro appointments\\", Toronto Star, December 10, 1994, A4; Peter Small, \\"Vote gives a lifeline to racism committee\\", Toronto Star, August 4, 1995, A7. He spoke against Metro's decision to cut $3 million from its staffing budget in early 1995, arguing that the resulting hardship for laid-off workers during a national recession would be \\"unconscionable\\".Gail Swainson, \\"Just days after they started work 25 welfare staffers sent packing\\", Toronto Star, April 1, 1995, A3. The provincial government of Mike Harris amalgamated several surrounding municipalities into the City of Toronto in 1997, with the stated intention of eliminating duplication of services and increasing efficiency. Miller argued that the decision to eliminate six local councils and establish a \\"megacity\\" was carried out without public approval.David Miller, \\"The megacity\\", The Globe and Mail, December 31, 1986, A12. He proposed an alternate plan to fold the six local councils into the existing Metro council, but this received little support.Ijeoma Ross, \\"Metro votes for unified city\\", The Globe and Mail, February 14, 1997, A1. He campaigned for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1996, running as the NDP candidate in York South to succeed outgoing party leader Bob Rae. He was narrowly defeated by Liberal Party candidate Gerard Kennedy. =Toronto councillor= =1997–2000= Miller was elected to the new City of Toronto council in the 1997, winning one of the two seats in Ward 19, High Park. He was appointed to the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) after the election, and became a prominent ally of TTC chair Howard Moscoe.Paul Moloney and Jack Lakey, \\"TTC brass lock horns over who's the boss\\", Toronto Star, June 9, 1998, B1; Paul Moloney, \\"Moscoe given another chance\\", Toronto Star, June 12, 1998, B3. He was also appointed to lead a twelve-member committee that studied the transition to amalgamated municipal services, and successfully advocated that Toronto City Hall rather than Metro Hall to be the permanent seat of the new government.Kim Honey and Richard Mackie, \\"Councillors opt for modest pay increase\\", The Globe and Mail, January 9, 1998, A8; \\"Who does what\\", Toronto Star, January 12, 1998, B4; Bruce DeMara, \\"Make city hall council's home, committee says\\", Toronto Star, January 29, 1998, C7. Miller later served on a three-member committee that recommended changes to the municipal ward boundaries.\\"Petty politics mar debate on ward boundaries\\", Toronto Star, January 17, 2000, p. 1. Miller issued a formal apology on behalf of the TTC in June 1999, following complaints about a subway advertisement by the Toronto police union that some believed depicted Hispanics as criminals.Paul Moloney, \\"Police union ad incites hatred, ethnic groups say\\", Toronto Star, June 2, 1999, p. 1. The following year, he argued that the union's controversial \\"Operation True Blue\\" telemarketing campaign was creating a climate of intimidation for Toronto residents.Bruce DeMara and Rebecca Bragg, \\"Police union slammed by council\\", Toronto Star, January 28, 2000, p. 1. Both Miller and his wife claimed that they had received threatening telephone calls during the 2000 municipal election, after the police union listed his home telephone number in a campaign advertisement.Mark Gollom, \\"City councillor enraged by police union ad\\", National Post, October 20, 2000, A09; \\"Disgraceful tactic\\", Toronto Star, October 20, 2000, p. 1. Miller became known as an advocate for waterfront parklands during his time on council. He supported several aspects of a 2000 report from Robert Fung of the Toronto Waterfront Task Force, while criticizing the proposal to sell parkland near Exhibition Place for private development.Robert Benzie, \\"Proposed sale of parkland 'shortsighted'\\", National Post, June 13, 2000, A20. He also opposed plans to construct a condominium near Toronto's High Park within his ward, instead supporting the construction of affordable housing for low-income residents.Morgan Campbell, \\"Group wants study of condo plan\\", Toronto Star, August 29, 2001, B03.; Paul Moloney, \\"Low-income housing project endorsed\\", Toronto Star, September 13, 2000, p. 1. Toronto's existing Keele Valley Landfill would reach capacity by 2002. Miller strongly opposed a plan by Toronto Mayor Mel Lastman to ship the city's garbage to the Adams Mine in Northern Ontario, which was ultimately voted down by council. The city instead sent its trash to Carleton Farms Landfill.James Rusk, \\"Garbage seen as way to unseat Lastman allies\\", The Globe and Mail, September 20, 2000, A19. Miller instead supported shipping the garbage to Michigan. =2000–2003= Following electoral redistribution, Miller was re-elected in 2000 over fellow councillor Bill Saundercook in Ward 13, Parkdale-High Park. He was re-appointed to the TTC and sought election as its chair, but was passed over in favour of Brian Ashton.\\"Whiners should praise Lastman, not bury him\\", Toronto Star, December 8, 2000, p. 1. Jennifer Lewington, \\"Moraine adviser appointed to find way to protect area\\", The Globe and Mail, June 13, 2001, A18. Other major city committees and agencies he served on include the Administration Committee, the Humber York Community Council, the Ethics Steering Committee, the Immigration and Refugee Issues Working Group, Labour Relations Advisory Group, and the Oak Ridges Moraine steering committee. See David Miller, City of Toronto council biography , davidmiller.org. In 2001, he expressed concern that the WheelTrans bus service for the disabled might be contracted out to the private sector.Paul Moloney, \\"City looks at contracting out\\", Toronto Star, July 26, 2001, p. 1. He opposed other privatization efforts in the same period. See Moira Welsh, \\"City's closed door report called illegal\\", Toronto Star, February 15, 2001, p. 1. Miller won the unanimous support of his colleagues in July 2001 for a motion requesting that the federal government approve the transfer of gasoline-tax revenues to Toronto's public transit system.Jennifer Lewington, \\"Region's politicians cheer gas-tax plan in federal report\\", The Globe and Mail, July 19, 2001, A18. See also David Miller, \\"Long-term funding still needed by TTC\\", Toronto Star, May 6, 2002, A21. He later suggested that Toronto's building revenues could be put toward priority spending rather than being stored in reserve accounts, arguing that the city's real estate boom would allow council to defer transit hikes and provide programs for children and the homeless.Paul Moloney, \\"Council's left wing eyes untapped taxes\\", Toronto Star, February 21, 2002, B03. He was also a leading voice in exposing Toronto's MFP computer leasing scandal in 2001 and 2002, bringing to light several questionable lobbying practices at city hall.Jack Lakey, \\"Council to probe lease deal\\", Toronto Star, January 16, 2002, A01; Royson James, \\"Reports pull no punches in MFP mess\\", Toronto Star, December 21, 2001, B01; Laurie Monsebraaten, \\"Council to try again on MFP deal\\", Toronto Star, January 3, 2002, B01l; John Barber, \\"Safest prediction for mayor's race is free-for-all\\", The Globe and Mail, August 24, 2002, A18; \\"City inquiry pays off\\", Toronto Star, October 4, 2002, A22; Don Wanagas, \\"Nightmare on Front St.\\", National Post, January 31, 2003, A13. As chair of the city's working group on immigrant and refugee issues, Miller introduced a mentorship program making it easier for recent immigrants to gain work experience in Toronto.Catherine Porter, \\"Mentors helping skilled immigrants get first jobs\\", Toronto Star, May 25, 2004, A22. Miller was given an A+ grade and named the best councillor by Toronto Life magazine in November 2000 for his work on council.Toronto Life, November 2000. Webhome.idirect.com In April 2002, the Toronto Environmental Alliance awarded him an \\"A\\" grade for his work on the TTC.Paul Moloney, \\"Councillors chided for their TTC work\\", Toronto Star, April 8, 2002, B03. Mayor Mel Lastman and Miller had an adversarial relationship on council. This was exemplified during a May 2002 debate when Lastman yelled at Miller, \\"You will never be mayor of this city because you say stupid and dumb things!\\" Miller later remarked that the exchange was what encouraged him to run for mayor. Despite being council opponents, Lastman attended the funeral for Miller's mother.John Barber, \\"Mel's funny, but Miller has last laugh\\", The Globe and Mail, May 23, 2002, A19; James Rusk, \\"Lastman loses council battle\\", The Globe and Mail, May 23, 2002, A19; Bruce DeMara, \\"Lastman attack falls flat\\", Toronto Star, May 23, 2002, B03; Linda Diebel, \\"Miller: A candidate 'clear on who he is'\\", October 11, 2003, A01. Miller later became the most prominent opponent of Lastman's plan to build a $22 million bridge to the Toronto Island Airport. Supporters of the bridge argued that it would eliminate one of the world's shortest ferry rides, make airline service more efficient, and provide a financial benefit to the city. Miller argued that the bridge would prevent the city from revitalizing its waterfront, and asserted that the proposed deal put the interests of developers and lobbyists ahead of the public. The bridge became a major issue when he ran for mayor during the 2003 campaign.John Barber, \\"Is City Hall still too clubby to speak up?\\", The Globe and Mail, May 28, 2003, A19. =2003 mayoral campaign= Miller's plans to run for mayor were well- known around city hall in 2002, and there was little surprise when he formally declared his candidacy in January 2003.Jennifer Lewington, \\"Councillor opens mayoral campaign\\", The Globe and Mail, January 9, 2003, A16. His earliest supporters included councillors Howard Moscoe, Sandra Bussin, Irene Jones and Anne Johnston and urban planner Jane Jacobs.\\"Maybe Mel should move to Ottawa\\", Toronto Star, February 23, 2002, B02; Don Wanagas, \\"Jacobs endorses Miller for mayor\\", National Post, October 29, 2002, A17; \\"Miller makes sudsy entrance\\", Toronto Star, January 11, 2003, B02. He was later endorsed by councillors Olivia Chow, Joe Pantalone and Brian Ashton, public figures such as June Callwood, Judy Rebick, Margaret Atwood, Michael Ondaatje and Michele Landsberg, American environmental activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Canadian Union of Public Employees and the Toronto Professional Fire Fighters Association.Don Wanagas, \\"Chow backs Miller for mayor\\", National Post, August 1, 2003, A12; Michelle Landsberg, \\"Why some prominent women won't vote for Hall\\", Toronto Star, October 5, 2003, A02; Vanessa Lu, \\"Women won't get this vote\\", Toronto Star, October 7, 2003, A01; Royson James, \\"Politicians beguile with city hall myths\\", Toronto Star, October 17, 2003, B03; James Cowan, \\"Candidate airs beef\\", National Post, November 8, 2003, TO06; James Cowan, \\"U.S. activist backs Miller\\", National Post, October 9, 2003, A18. The Toronto Star newspaper, journalist Royson James and councillors Raymond Cho and Michael Walker also endorsed Miller near the end of the campaign.\\"David Miller best to lead Toronto\\", Toronto Star, November 6, 2003, A24; Royson James, \\"Miller is best able to lead city's revival\\", Toronto Star, November 6, 2003, November 6, 2003, B01; \\"Miller's election band wagon is starting to creak\\", The Globe and Mail, November 8, 2003, A20; James Cowan, \\"Union backs Miller for mayoralty run\\", National Post, March 5, 2003, A15; Scott Stinson, \\"Firefighters to back Miller for mayor\\", National Post, October 30, 2003, A16; Jack Lakey, \\"Now 'deputy mayor,' Joe Pantalone has always been on the winning side\\", Toronto Star, September 30, 2005, A7. Miller's campaign organization was diverse. As well as support from many New Democrats and social activists, his top campaign strategists included veteran Conservative John Laschinger and Liberal Peter Donolo. Architect Jack Diamond was also a co-chair of his campaign.Stephen Wickens, \\"Diamond backs smart growth\\", The Globe and Mail, December 4, 2003, G1. Miller used a broom as a prop in this campaign, symbolizing his commitment to cleaning up Toronto both literally, in terms of litter, and metaphorically, arguing that there were shady deals at City Hall. He pledged to cancel the airport bridge, appoint a municipal ethics commissioner, and promote public transit by fully implementing the TTC's ridership growth plan. He supported a police request to hire thirty-two new officers, and opposed rival candidate John Tory's plans for trash incineration in favour of continuing garbage shipments to Michigan.Royson James, \\"There's a new sheriff in town\\", Toronto Star, November 11, 2003, A01; James Cowan, \\"Waterfront key issue in mayor's race, Miller says\\", National Post, January 9, 2003, A15; Jennifer Wells, \\"All eyes on Tory\\", Toronto Star, January 23, 2003, C01; David Miller, \\"We need 'old deal' back for TTC\\", Toronto Star, April 17, 2003, A27; James Cowan, \\"Mayoralty race\\", National Post, April 23, 2003, A17; David Miller, \\"Shady backroom deals threaten our waterfront\\", Toronto Star, April 24, 2003, A29; Vanessa Lu, \\"Tory supports trash-burning incinerator for Toronto\\", Toronto Star, October 4, 2003, A30; Jennifer Lewington, \\"Miller onside with police adding 32 officers to ranks\\", The Globe and Mail, November 8, 2003, A19. At one stage in the campaign, Miller raised the possibility of collecting tolls on the Don Valley Parkway and Gardiner Expressway. After criticism from other candidates, including John Tory who described it as \\"Highway Robbery\\", Miller dropped the suggestion. At the start of the campaign in early 2003, Barbara Hall led by a wide margin, with John Nunziata a distant second, while Miller and Tory initially had support in single digits. Miller's polling numbers stalled around 12-13% for most of 2003, but increased in October when front-runner Hall suddenly lost much of her support.Jennifer Lewington, \\"Hall leads race for mayor, poll shows\\", The Globe and Mail, May 3, 2003, A11; Bruce Demara, \\"Waiting for sparks to fly\\", Toronto Star, August 9, 2003, B04; \\"The Mayoral Race\\", The Globe and Mail, September 5, 2003, A1; Don Wanagas, \\"Hall's fear suggests lead may be shaky\\", October 7, 2003, A14; Vanessa Lu, \\"Miller vaults into close second place behind Hall\\", Toronto Star, October 11, 2003, A01; Don Wanagas, \\"Two-man race shaping up as Hall loses ground\\", National Post, October 21, 2003, A16. He first led a citywide poll on October 22, 2003, scoring 31% support against 29% for Hall and 23% for John Tory.James Cowan, \\"New poll gives Miller narrow lead\\", National Post, October 22, 2003, A18. Hall's support continued to dissipate, and she fell to a distant third. The final stage of the campaign was between Miller and Tory, who each had a base of solid support; Miller among urban residents and progressives, while Tory was backed by the suburbs and conservatives. Days before the vote, prominent Hall supporters Bob Rae and Kyle Rae acknowledged that she could not win, and encouraged her supporters to vote for Miller over Tory.Bruce DeMara and Vanessa Lu, \\"Hall ally gets in Miller's corner\\", Toronto Star, November 9, 2003, A01 Miller defeated Tory 43% to 38% (Hall was third with 9%), and appointed Jane Jacobs and former Toronto Mayor David Crombie to chair his transition team. Mayor Miller's first term as mayor focused on issues such as waterfront renewal, public transit and municipal reform. He also shifted toward a focus on community safety issues following an increase in gun violence during 2005. Many of Miller's initiatives did not come to fruition within his first few years as mayor. Supporters pointed out they were centred on long-term development goals, while detractors criticized the pace of change. =Waterfront policy= Toronto City Centre Airport Bridge Soon after his election, Miller led the council to reverse its support for the Toronto City Centre Airport Bridge. He argued that the bridge was detrimental to the regional environment, was unwanted by most local residents, and stood in the way of a more comprehensive renewal of the waterfront economy. Supporters of the bridge argued that it would make airline service more efficient, and provide a financial benefit. The vote, held on December 3, 2003, was 32-12 in favour of withdrawal.Vanessa Lu, \\"Decision puts ball in Ottawa's court\\", Toronto Star, December 4, 2003, A01. Afterwards, the federal government announced that it would withdraw its support for the project.James Cowan, \\"Ottawa backs city on bridge\\", National Post, December 5, 2003, A16; Martin Patriquin, \\"Miller glad to get bridge promise in writing\\", National Post, May 25, 2004, A19. There were subsequent threats of legal action against the City by the Toronto Port Authority (TPA) and developer Robert Deluce, but these were settled in 2005 when the federal government agreed to pay $35 million in compensation. The federal payment was controversial for both supporters and opponents of Miller's administration. Liberal MP Tony Ianno defended it as providing fair compensation to legitimate claimants, and saying that it invalidated Miller's pledge to cancel the bridge without incurring further expense.John Barber, \\"Toronto's own Bridge of Sighs\\", The Globe and Mail, May 4, 2005, A17. Miller's allies, including NDP leader Jack Layton, argued that the payout was overly generous, and did not reflect the true costs of cancellation.John Barber, \\"Stop this plane, we want to get off\\", The Globe and Mail, February 4, 2006, M1. Shortly after the settlement, Miller announced that he would seek the repayment of $27 million in back taxes from the Port Authority to the city.John Spears, \\"Port settlement gets mayor's eye\\", Toronto Star, May 5, 2005, B05. David Miller at the opening for the Quay to the City. Airport expansion In early 2006, Robert Deluce announced the creation of a company called Porter Airlines that would start a commuter service at the Island Airport, with the planes built at Bombardier's Downsview plant. It would provide travelers with direct flights to Toronto's city centre, which Pearson International is currently unable to offer, as it is located 30 km away. Opponents of expansion argued that increased services would result in greater noise pollution for downtown residents, as well as preventing other economies from flourishing in the waterfront region. Miller argued that the city may soon have to face the choice of \\"an industrial or revitalized waterfront\\". Some supporters of expansion have suggested this is a false dichotomy, and have argued that expansion can be integrated with a larger revitalization plan. Deluce's proposal won support from both business interests and Canadian Auto Workers leader Buzz Hargrove, who said it would create new jobs for workers in the region.Gabe Gonda, \\"Airline launches into protests\\", Toronto Star, February 3, 2006, B01. A Toronto Star report from early February 2006 indicated most Toronto residents opposed expansion.Christopher Hume, \\"Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory\\", Toronto Star, February 4, 2006, B01. In late September 2006, it was reported that Robert Deluce's REGCO (the parent company of Porter Airlines) received $20 million of the $35 million paid by the federal government. This payment assisted Deluce in starting his new airline, and opponents have charged that it was for all intents and purposes a federal subsidy. Miller described the payout as \\"totally improper\\".John Barber, \\"Cries of outrage fly about airport deal\\", Toronto Star, September 28, 2006, A11. Toronto Port Authority (TPA) The bridge and airport debates are reflective of a more general division between Miller's administration and the TPA, the federal body created by former Liberal MP Dennis Mills that controls the Toronto Island Airport.John Barber, \\"Politicians muddy waterfront squabble\\", The Globe and Mail, May 5, 1998, A10. Miller called for the TPA to be either eliminated or significantly reformed, and has argued that more oversight powers should be granted to the Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Corp., which is managed by all three levels of government. Miller himself joined the TWRC as a voting member in 2006.Bruce DeMara and Kerry Gillespie, \\"Sink port authority, Miller demands\\", Toronto Star, April 28, 2004, B2; Jennifer Lewington, \\"Call for waterfront action wins praise\\", The Globe and Mail, October 30, 2004, A14; Kerry Gillespie, \\"Miller seeks waterfront helm\\", The Globe and Mail, November 11, 2004, B1; \\"The battle over lakeside land\\", The Globe and Mail, October 8, 2005, A17; Jennifer Lewington, \\"Agency plans audit of waterfront spending\\", The Globe and Mail, January 14, 2006, A18. The Harper government announced in May 2006 that it would conduct a review of the Port Authority, and scrutinize past decisions related to the bridge project. Former deputy minister of justice Roger Tassé was named to oversee the review. Miller described himself as \\"cautiously optimistic\\", although he later found it \\"very regrettable and very worrying\\" that federal Transport Minister Lawrence Cannon appointed five members of the Port Authority executive before the report was complete.Kelly Patrick, \\"Tories revisit cancelled island link\\", National Post, May 2, 2006, A10; Vanessa Lu and Phinjo Gombu, \\"Critics laud port authority review\\", Toronto Star, May 2, 2006; Janice Mawhinney, \\"Appointments raise island airport fears\\", Toronto Star, August 27, 2006, A3; James Cowan, \\"Porter Airlines steaming ahead\\", National Post, August 30, 2006, A8. When the Tassé Report was released in November 2006, it defended the Port Authority's decision to sign a bridge contract just before the 2003 election, and described the $35 million payout to DeLuce as \\"reasonable\\". Miller dismissed the document as \\"not worth the paper it is written on\\", while MP Olivia Chow referred to it as a \\"total whitewash\\" and accused the Conservative government of doing a \\"complete about face\\" on the issue.Kelly Patrick and James Cowan, \\"Expo bid dead\\", National Post, November 3, 2006, A1; Simon Tuck and Jeff Grey, \\"Critics blast port authority 'whitewash'\\", The Globe and Mail, November 3, 2006, A1. Expo 2015 In April 2005, Miller encouraged council to begin work on a bid to host the Expo 2015 world fair. He argued that the event would assist the city's plans for waterfront renewal, and would \\"show Toronto to the world\\". Council voted 37-2 to launch a bid in May 2006.Paul Moloney and Joseph Hall, \\"Fair could remove waterfront's 'ugly warts\\", Toronto Star, April 15, 2005, B1; James Cowan, \\"City votes to go after world Expo\\", National Post, May 26, 2006, A8. Councillors Michael Walker and Rob Ford voted against the bid. The bid collapsed in November 2006, when the federal, provincial and municipal governments failed to reach agreement on who would cover potential losses. Miller refused to blame either level of government for the failed bid, although councillor Brian Ashton argued that the province was mostly to blame.Kelly Patrick and James Cowan, \\"Expo bid dead\\", National Post, November 3, 2006, A1. Power plant Miller and former TWRC chair Robert Fung criticized the provincial government's plan to build a large power plant in Toronto's waterfront area, and urged the province to build a smaller facility in its place. Then Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty argued that the plant would be necessary to meet Toronto's energy needs.James Cowan, \\"Mayor zaps proposal for power plant\\", National Post, February 2, 2006, A12; John Spears, \\"Fung wades into lakeside power plant issue\\", Toronto Star, February 3, 2006, B4; James Cowan, \\"Cut power plant in half, report urges\\", National Post, February 8, 2006, A8. Other investments In October 2005, Miller announced $70 million in waterfront investments over five years, dedicated toward new boardwalks, promenades, public places and related attractions.Jennifer Lewington, \\"Waterfront improvements\\", The Globe and Mail, October 12, 2005, A15. HtO, Toronto's first urban beach, was started in late 2005.Christopher Hume, \\"It has taken time, but waterfront comes of age with urban beach\\", Toronto Star, December 5, 2005, B3. In January 2006, the provincial government announced it would expedite the approval process of five waterfront parks. See Paul Moloney, \\"Province expedites five waterfront parks\\", Toronto Star, January 21, 2006, F8. =Fiscal policy= Following his election, Miller appointed conservative councillor David Soknacki as Toronto's budget chief.Vanessa Lu, \\"The $6.5 billion man\\", Toronto Star, January 1, 2004, B01. Although Miller and Soknacki are from different ideological backgrounds, they were political allies in managing the city's finances. Toronto's budget shortfall when Miller assumed office was $344 million.Paul Moloney, \\"Residents to have a say on city's $344M deficit\\", Toronto Star, January 7, 2004, B2. There was a general agreement among local politicians and political analysts that the city needed to increase its residential property tax base. Miller promised to hold such increases to 3% per year. Miller's first budget was passed by city council in late April 2004, by a vote of 29-10. The city eliminated its previous shortfall while increasing spending by 6%, and keeping residential property taxes increases at 3% and business and industrial property taxes to 1.5% The city's total operating budget for the year was $6.7 billion.Peter Kuitenbrouwer, \\"'Sticky tape' budget passes with 3% hike\\", National Post, April 29, 2004, A16. Miller engaged in a scaled-back consultation process prior to delivering his second budget in 2005.Kelly Gillespie and Paul Moloney, \\"Miller likes what he hears\\", Toronto Star, November 29, 2004, B7. Following months of difficult negotiations, the city passed a balanced budget by taking $19.8 million from its reserve funds. Soknacki acknowledged that this was a difficult decision, and Miller's administration argued that the provincial government had increased Toronto's budgetary difficulties by not providing $72.3 million for provincially mandated social programs.James Cowan, \\"City to 'raid reserve' to avoid shortfall\\", National Post, February 23, 2005, A15. During the late stages of negotiations, provincial Municipal Affairs Minister John Gerretsen suggested that the city could make up for its budgetary shortfall by raising property taxes above 3%. Miller rejected this advice.Jennifer Lewington, \\"Raise taxes, minister advises city\\", The Globe and Mail, February 5, 2005, A13. The total operating budget for the year was $7.1 billion, with residential property tax increases again held to 3% and business and industry property tax increases held to 1.5%. Increased funds were provided to policing, transit, parks and social programs. Miller and Soknacki argued that it was the best possible budget under the circumstances, although it was criticized by several right- wing councillors.Catherine Porter and Bruce DeMara, \\"Tax hike certain for next year, too\\", Toronto Star, March 2, 2005, B3. In late 2005, Miller endorsed a policy which shifted a portion of Toronto's property tax burden from businesses and commercial operators to homeowners. Acknowledging that this was a difficult decision, he argued that it was necessary to prevent an exodus of jobs from the city. The decision was endorsed by the Toronto Industry Network.Jennifer Lewington, \\"Council gives green light to tax hike\\", The Globe and Mail, October 29, 2005, A21. Toronto's capital budget for 2006 was $1.3 billion, and was targeted toward such items as road repairs, police stations and recreation centres.Jennifer Lewington, \\"Capital-budget picture rosy, Miller declares\\", The Globe and Mail, December 10, 2005, A22. Miller clashed with Toronto Board of Trade President and CEO Glen Grunwald at a February 2006 budgetary consultation meeting, after Grunwald presented a number of policy measures designed to solve Toronto's budget shortfall. Grunwald's recommendations included reducing spending on non-priority items, increasing user fees, privatizing some services and implementing the auditor general's 800 suggestions.Thestar.com Miller criticized the suggestions as \\"poorly researched\\", and said that the Board of Trade presentation \\"didn't befit the role they have as city builders.\\" In January 2006, there were media reports that Toronto was facing a $532 million shortfall on its operating budget. To promote cost-cutting, Miller and Soknacki encouraged the city to adopt a \\"zero-based budgeting\\" approach, wherein all city departments begin with zero authorized funds and are required to defend all proposed expenditures.\\"Zero- based solution\\", Toronto Star, January 11, 2006, A18. The city later announced a hiring freeze.Jennifer Lewington, \\"City's budget makers mind the gap\\", The Globe and Mail, February 1, 2006, A12. Early fears of significant tax increases were allayed by significant provincial investment in the city. Led by Miller, council passed a $7.6 billion operating budget by a vote of 27-17, again holding residential tax increases to 3% and business tax increases to 1%. The budget contained new money to hire police officers and bus drivers.James Cowan, \\"City council approves $7.6-billion budget\\", National Post, March 31, 2006, A12. David Soknacki did not run for reelection in 2006. After the election, Shelley Carroll was appointed as the city's new budget chief. The city introduced $7.8 billion operating budget with a 3.8% property tax increase in 2007; Miller argued that the increase was necessary for the city's expenses.Jennifer Lewington, \\"Toronto property-tax hike double the inflation rate\\", The Globe and Mail, March 27, 2007, A1. Miller has also pushed for new municipal taxes (mostly \\"sin taxes\\") and parking fees under the new City of Toronto Act.John Spears, \\"Drinks, cars, movie tickets among Miller's tax targets\\", Toronto Star, March 27, 2007, E1. Based upon a 2007 city report, Miller proposed imposing a $60 vehicle-registration tax and a 1.5 per cent land transfer tax, which would be expected to generate $354 million. He argued that the new measures were essential to sustaining the city's budget, without reducing services or raising property taxes. The Canadian Taxpayers Federation and Toronto Board of Trade were opposed, with the latter warning that the proposals would have a negative economic impact on businesses. Miller asserted that residents support the notion of increased taxes as long as the money is being used properly. A survey conducted by the Environics Research Group showed that 70 percent of respondents supported a cut in expenditures rather than new taxes. A similar number also preferred that the proposals to be debated in the 2010 municipal election before being implemented, as Miller did not mention new taxes during the 2006 campaign. On July 16, council voted 23-22 to defer debating the measures until after the October 2007 provincial election. Miller denied that it was a personal defeat, while Councillor Case Ootes, who led the opposition to the measures, described it as a \\"wake-up call\\" to Miller that residents wanted spending curbed.\\"City defers tax vote until after Ontario election\\", CTV, Monday, July 16, 2007, Toronto.ctv.ca, toronto.ctv.ca\\"New taxes should wait until next election: poll\\", CTV, Thursday, July 12, 2007 Toronto.ctv.ca, toronto.ctv.ca In the aftermath, Miller immediately proposed several drastic service cuts with the stated intention of saving $100 million from the operating budget. These measures included closing the Sheppard Subway line, cancelling underused bus routes, and scrapping renovations and extra staff to the mayor's office. Miller argued that these were the only responsible steps that Toronto could take to prevent a financial crisis. This drew criticism from several councillors and columnists, with provincial Finance Minister Greg Sorbara attacking the cuts as \\"quick, perhaps poorly thought out decisions\\". While they acknowledged the city was faced with a significant budget crisis, they described Miller's announcements as a political ploy, citing his initial move to go to the media instead of calling special session to discuss the cuts, with Brian Ashton suggesting that Miller was punishing councillors that did not support the new taxes. Miller dismissed Ashton from the executive committee for being the lone member to vote for the deferral of the new taxes. The committee is part of the new \\"strong mayor\\" system where key issues are dealt with before being brought to full council. The stated intention was to streamline the decision-making process, but Ashton and Ootes have criticized Miller for treating it as a cabinet and limiting debate with the whole council. Ashton argued that Miller did little to persuade skeptical councillors and the public of the need for new taxes. Under Miller's direction, City Manager Shirley Hoy implemented $34-million in service cuts to the 2007 budget in August 2007 without seeking council approval. Miller's spokesperson defended the move, saying \\"we've got a serious financial shortfall that has to be addressed\\". The North York and Etobicoke community councils passed motions, by 9-1 and 6-1 majorities respectively, asking Toronto council to stop its plan to close community centres on Mondays and delay the opening of ice rinks. The North York motion was tabled by David Shiner, but two allies of the Mayor Howard Moscoe and John Filion voted for it, with Shelley Carroll as the lone dissenter. Based upon interviews, a majority of councillors are expected to vote to reverse the controversial cuts at the next meeting scheduled for September 26. Ashton suggested that \\"[Miller]'s grip is slipping\\" and \\"It's like the emperor is doing a slow striptease\\".Communities.canada.com An arbitrator later ruled that the library closures violated the collective bargaining agreement with the union.Toronto.ctv.ca Miller has since pushed to have the two tax measures implemented. An Environics Research Group for real estate and construction groups showing that 62% were against the measures, while 85% thought that the mayor's campaign at fairtaxes.ca either had no effect on their support for the new taxes or turned them against. Miller pointed out that two-thirds of 30,000 hits to the website were in favour of the plan. He also argued that at neighbourhood meetings, most initial questions were not about taxes but rather about service improvements.Torontosun.com The measures were passed on October 23, 2007 by a majority of 26 to 19 and 25 to 20.680news.com =Transit policy= Miller took part in negotiations with the federal and provincial governments during 2004, which resulted in one billion dollars in additional funding being allocated for the TTC over five years.

The capital budget was $285 million. With Miller's permission, the TTC approved a small fare increase in early 2005. The price of adult tickets and tokens was increased by ten cents, while adult cash fare was increased 25 cents. The TTC mitigated this change by introducing a weekly $30 pass that could be transferred among several users. TTC chair Howard Moscoe said that the rise was unfortunate, but argued that it was \\"basically an inflationary increase\\".Jeff Gray, \\"Fare hike gets green light\\", The Globe and Mail, February 10, 2005, A18.

Other opponents, including the Canadian Automobile AssociationToronto City Summit Alliance - Issues Facing Our City - Regional Transportation , torontoalliance.ca have argued that the right-of-way will increase automobile congestion, since the proposal bans left turns and may divert traffic to neighbourhood streets. Supporters have questioned this latter claim, claiming instead that the previous right-of-way streetcar implemented on Spadina Avenue was a success.Eye.net Former Toronto mayor John Sewell, a long-standing supporter of public transit, has emerged as a vocal opponent of the right-of-way plan.Peter Kuitenbrouwer, \\"Official Plan the mantra for St. Clair\\", National Post, April 24, 2004, TO3.

Miller endorsed the TTC's plan to purchase new subway cars from Bombardier, which awarded a contract for construction of the cars via a non- competitive bid. Some members of council criticized the deal, noting that other city departments require competitive bids on contracts of this size. They also cited a study from rival company Siemens that its proposal could have saved the city up to $100 million (Bombardier officials have questioned this figure).

The city had previously approved several large increases for the police during Mel Lastman's tenure as mayor.Katherine Harding, \\"Police: Show us your budget\\", The Globe and Mail, February 7, 2004, M1. The force's 2004 request was for $691.4 million, an increase of $57 million from the previous year.Kerry Gillespie, \\"The high price of law and order\\", Toronto Star, February 21, 2004, B04.

In November 2006, Miller stood with Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Premier Dalton McGuinty to announce tougher bail conditions for persons accused of gun crimes. Miller and McGuinty both support Harper's plan for a \\"reverse-onus\\" provision, in which persons accused of gun crimes will be required to demonstrate why they should not be held in custody before a trial.Janice Tibbetts, \\"Harper to announce gun-crime bill in Toronto\\", National Post, November 23, 2006, A16; Jennifer Lewington and Timothy Appleby, \\"Harper touts tougher bail rules\\", The Globe and Mail, November 24, 2006, A18. Harper has rejected Miller's call for a ban on handguns.Jim Byers, \\"Leaders gather in rare accord\\", Toronto Star, November 24, 2006, E1. Later in the year, Miller became involved in a labour dispute between the Police Services Board and the Toronto Police Association. The board, led by councillor Pam McConnell, wanted to save revenue by clawing back existing rates of retention pay and eliminating lunch-hour pay for officers on inactive duty during compressed shifts.Melissa Leong, \\"Police to begin job action\\", National Post, October 12, 2005, A9/front. The police association argued that the proposals would cause an exodus of officers and result in lower pay for officers working compressed schedules. After a series of acrimonious meetings, negotiations broke down and the association entered a work-to-rule campaign by refusing to patrol or hand out fines.Unnati Gandhi, \\"Don't wear uniforms at rally, Blair says\\", The Globe and Mail, November 2, 2005, A17. During the course of this dispute, the association printed full- page advertisements in the Toronto Star and Toronto Sun asking the mayor to become personally involved through his role as a board member.Wooden patio furnitures, torontocopsaretops.ca It also issued an open letter which asked if Miller wanted to be remembered \\"as the mayor who was tough on crime, or the mayor who was tough on cops\\".Jennifer Lewington and Oliver Moore, \\"Hope glimmers in police talks\\", The Globe and Mail, November 1, 2005, A14.

Police Chief Fantino In June 2004, the deadlocked Toronto Police Services Board voted not to renew Fantino's contract as chief. The next month, city council rejected a motion from Fantino's supporters which sought to overturn the decision. The mayor's position was that a full council debate on the matter would have violated the Police Services Act.Katherine Harding, \\"Council won't budge on Fantino\\", The Globe and Mail, July 22, 2004, A8. Miller's refusal to allow a debate drew criticism from the Toronto Sun who ran a cartoon comparing Miller to Adolf Hitler. (The paper's editor apologized after Miller and the Canadian Jewish Congress condemned the cartoon.)Katherine Harding, \\"Hitler cartoon is 'despicable,' Miller says\\", The Globe and Mail, July 24, 2004, A9. Former councillor Rob Davis led a protest march in support of Fantino.Katherine Harding, \\"Support for Fantino 'tepid,' poll finds\\", The Globe and Mail, August 18, 2004, A8. Some journalists and Ontario Finance Minister Greg Sorbara, whose government shortly afterwards appointed Fantino as Commissioner of Emergency Management, speculated that Miller played an influential behind-the-scenes role in the board's decision not to renew Fantino's contract. Miller denied this, saying that he would have preferred the board to reserve any decision until September.Rosie DiManno, \\"Miller should fess up on role in chief's ouster\\", Toronto Star, July 26, 2004, A02. Ontario Finance Minister Greg Sorbara was also critical, saying that Miller \\"has to assume officially the responsibility\\" for Fantino's contract not being renewed, and should \\"not keep pretending that he has nothing to do with it\\". Miller described Sorbara's comments as \\"total nonsense\\". See John Barber, \\"Miller, Sorbara trade verbal blows over Fantino ouster\\", The Globe and Mail, July 7, 2004, A10. In early 2005, Miller argued that Fantino's replacement as Chief of Police should revamp the city's scheduling practices. He argued that the existing system was designed for the convenience of officers living outside of Toronto, and should be revised to permit more officers on the streets during important periods.Jeff Gray, \\"Overhaul scheduling of police, Miller urges\\", The Globe and Mail, January 28, 2005, A10. The following month, he unexpectedly sided with the Toronto Police Association against the Toronto Police Services Board in opposing mandatory drug testing for officers.Megan Ogilvie, \\"Drug tests for police looming\\", Toronto Star, February 11, 2005, B1. In March 2005, Miller asked of the Police Services Board that he be granted a participatory role in the selection of the next police chief. He argued that he could provide \\"a voice that represents all Torontonians rather than that of a particular stakeholder\\", and said that he would recuse himself from formal deliberations and the final decision. Board member Case Ootes responded that the mayor's request amounted to political interference, and said there was \\"some contradiction\\" between the request and Miller's earlier refusal to engage in public debate over Fantino's removal. The Board turned down Miller's request. By way of compromise, he was allowed to see the board's shortlist of candidates and propose interview questions for applicants.James Cowan, \\"Mayor denied role in hiring police chief\\", National Post, March 9, 2005, A10. Fantino was succeeded on a temporary basis by Mike Boyd, a retired deputy chief who had worked closely with Miller when the latter was still a councillor.Linda Diebel, \\"Looking for a police chief most perfect\\", Toronto Star, February 20, 2005, A05. In April 2005, the board chose Bill Blair as Fantino's permanent replacement. There was some media speculation that the mayor's office would have preferred Boyd for the position, though Miller denied this.Joe Friesen, \\"Blair noses out Boyd as new police chief\\", April 7, 2005, A1. In an effort to move beyond previous hostilities, Miller awarded Fantino with the Key to the City on April 14, 2005. During the ceremony, Miller described Fantino as \\"a man of integrity who has done tremendous work to help keep Toronto safe.\\"\\"Former top cop's work to keep city safe rewarded with key to Toronto\\", National Post, April 15, 2005, A13. Miller indicated that he would take a seat on the Police Services Board halfway through his first term, and replaced Ootes during the city's mid-term shuffle of positions in May 2005. Deputy Mayor Joe Pantalone indicated that Ootes was replaced because his right-wing policy views were inconsistent with the aims of Miller's administration.Catherine Porter, \\"Ootes dumped from police board\\", Toronto Star, May 5, 2005, B2. Anti-crime measures In February 2004, Miller introduced an anti-crime package highlighted by increased community outreach programs and job opportunities for at-risk youth. He also appointed Ontario Chief Justice Roy McMurtry to head a panel on gun-related crime in the city.Royson James, \\"McMurtry to head advisory panel\\", Toronto Star, February 19, 2004, A1. Fantino described Miller's plan as \\"holistic\\", and gave it his support.Katherine Harding and Jeff Gray, \\"Miller proposes new panel to fight guns and gangs\\", The Globe and Mail, February 19, 2004, A13; Nicole MacIntyre, \\"Fantino praises 'holistic' crime strategy \\", Toronto Star, February 20, 2004, F2. Some councillors expressed concern that the measures would not be effective against serious criminals, and Etobicoke councillor Doug Holyday suggested that Miller should instead lobby the federal government for tougher laws.James Cowan, 'Group hug' not enough: councillor\\", National Post, February 25, 2004, A14/front. Nonetheless, council unanimously approved Miller's plan on March 1, 2004.Jennifer Lewington, \\"City council adopts mayor's anti- violence plan\\", The Globe and Mail, March 2, 2004, A13. After a series of gang-related shootings in summer 2005, Miller argued that lax American gun laws were creating unsafe conditions in Toronto. He noted that half the firearms in Toronto originated in America.Nicholas Kohler, \\"Mayor blames lax U.S. gun laws after day of gunplay\\", National Post, July 27, 2005, A1. The mayor also announced that most of a $4.3 million police budget surplus would go toward hiring 150 new officers. He had previously opposed hiring large numbers of new officers when campaigning for mayor, at a time when gang- related shootings in the city were fewer and less pronounced. Some journalists noted similarities between Miller's revised policy and that proposed by John Tory in 2003.Nicholas Kohler, \\"John Tory, Mayor at last\\", National Post, August 12, 2005, A1; Unnati Gandhi, \\"Surplus will be used to hire more officers\\", The Globe and Mail, September 17, 2005, A17.

Corruption In April 2004, a small number of Toronto officers were charged with aiding figures connected to the Hells Angels biker gang.Allan Woods and Shannon Kari, \\"Four Toronto officers charged with corruption\\", National Post, April 27, 2004, A2. Shortly thereafter, Miller was overheard saying \\"Is your police force in jail? Mine is.\\" in a private aside to the Lord Mayor of London, who was in Toronto to announce a new partnership between the cities. Miller explained that he made the comment in order to introduce the scandal to his guest, following an awkward press scrum which the Lord Mayor walked away from after several questions about the local controversy. He later apologized, saying \\"the allegations are serious and I shouldn't have referred to them with humour\\". After the mayor's initial comment, Fantino was quoted on the CablePulse 24 program The Chief as saying, \\"I feel like someone has driven a stake through my heart\\". He later accepted Miller's apology.Peter Kuitenbrouwer, \\"Miller apologizes for joking about police\\", National Post, May 1, 2004, A8. Immigration In February 2006, the Toronto Police Services Board unanimously supported a policy to have officers refrain from asking witnesses and victims of crime about their immigration status. The purpose of this policy change was to ensure that illegal immigrants will not be intimidated from reporting serious crimes to the police. Both Miller and Blair supported the policy.Joe Friesen, \\"Police 'don't ask' policy okayed\\", The Globe and Mail, February 16, 2006, A13. Crime Miller and Blair also opposed efforts by the Guardian Angels vigilante group to establish a base in Toronto.Peter Cheney, \\"Civilian patrol group persistent about starting Toronto chapter\\", The Globe and Mail, February 20, 2006, A10. Their opposition failed to stop the Angels, who have since initiated patrols in the city. A poll taken by Ipsos-Reid in October 2005 showed that the mayor, council, police and judges all received low to middling grades from the Toronto public in their handling of increased gang activity. The poll gave Police Chief Bill Blair and the Toronto Police Services a C average grade, followed by community leaders (C-), Miller (D+), city council (D), the Attorney General of Ontario (D), and the judges and justices of the Peace (D).Nicholas Kohler, \\"66% back curfew for children, National Post, October 26, 2005, A1/front. =Environmental policy= Shortly after assuming office, Miller introduced a $3 million \\"clean and beautiful\\" city initiative to involve ordinary Torontonians in the cleanup of their city.Jennifer Lewington, \\"Know an area gone to seed?

The City of Toronto is introducing a 9% water rate increase for 2007, with similar increases expected for the foreseeable future. Miller's administration argues that the money is needed to fix aging water and sewer pipes.John Spears, \\"Big water users up in arms\\", Toronto Star, January 11, 2007, A21. The price of water will increase by 10.8% on March 1, 2007. Miller has indicated that the increase will be equivalent to 9% over the full year. See John Spears, \\"Water rate jumps 10.8 % to repair pipes, sewers\\", Toronto Star, February 8, 2007, A16. In March 2007, Miller unveiled a plan to reduce the city's greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2020, and by 80% in 2050 (based on a 1990 baseline). Miller has argued that the plan is viable, and is based on similar initiatives in the European Union.Jim Byers, \\"Miller to unveil green plan\\", Toronto Star, March 23, 2007, A3; Donovan Vincent, \\"Phase 1: Miller's 'bold ideas'\\", Toronto Star, March 24, 2007, A1. Garbage disposal When Miller was elected mayor, Toronto's garbage had for several years been shipped to Carleton Farms Landfill in Michigan, USA, through a contract with the firm Republic Services. This arrangement was strongly criticized by politicians in both Michigan and Ontario, citing the undesirability and accidents of trucks passing through.\\"Trash talk\\", CBC News Online, July 31, 2004. Opponents argued that it would not be sustainable in the long term, with US politicians lobbying to close off the border to garbage exports, while the Southwestern Ontario Trash coalition of cities voiced concerns that they would be forced to bear Toronto's garbage in the event of a border closure. Some politicians, including John Tory and Dalton McGuinty, supported the option of local trash incineration as it would reduce dependence on landfill space. Miller opposed this, citing both cost concerns and a threat to the environment.Jack Lakey, \\"Waste disposal fires up debate\\", Toronto Star, November 5, 2003, A07. He also reiterated his opposition to shipping Toronto's garbage to the Adams Mine landfill near Kirkland Lake in Northern Ontario.Dana Borcea, \\"Miller remains opposed to Adams mine: Toronto's trash\\", National Post, November 19, 2003, A8. In 2005, Miller led the city in renewing its contract with Republic for five years.John Barber, \\"Sanity prevails as council renews garbage contract\\", The Globe and Mail, May 19, 2005, A12. In 2006, Miller spearheaded a decision for the City of Toronto to purchase Green Lane Environmental Ltd., a large landfill area near St. Thomas in southwestern Ontario. It is believed that this purchase will solve Toronto's waste disposal problems for several years, as the city explores other options for the future. Council voted 26-12 to accept the plan.Jennifer Lewington, \\"City moves to buy landfill that can last years\\", The Globe and Mail, September 20, 2006, A12. This was criticized by London Mayor Anne Marie DeCicco-Best and provincial Minister of Colleges and Universities Chris Bentley, as they received no notice of the deal, but they conceded that they could do little to block it.\\"Garbage dump to 'pay for itself,' mayor says\\", CBC News Online. September 21, 2006. On September 21, 2006, Toronto Star columnist Royson James suggested that the city had received a better offer for the Green Lane site one year earlier, and failed to act on it. Miller described James's accusation as \\"categorically false\\", acknowledging that the city received a conditional proposal in 2005 but denying that any formal offer was made or that a price was negotiated. He added that a deal would have been impossible, as the province had not granted its approval at the time. Green Lane has upheld Miller's version of events. This controversy notwithstanding, James has written in support of the Green Lane purchase.Royson James, \\"Did Miller miss better landfill deal?\\", Toronto Star, September 21, 2006, A1; Donovan Vincent and Vanessa Lu, \\"Dull mayoral race erupts over garbage issue\\", Toronto Star, September 22, 2006, A1. The deal was completed in December 2006, with Toronto paying $220 million for the site.Paul Moloney, \\"City's trash deal finalized\\", Toronto Star, December 21, 2006, A14. During Miller's tenure, Toronto has also expanded its Green Bin recycling program, a composting project designed to reduce the amount of waste that Toronto ships to landfills. The project was initiated in Etobicoke in 2002, and the other areas of Toronto have been added since Miller's election as mayor. Green Bin became citywide in October 2005 when North York was included in the program. In marking the achievement, Miller described Toronto as \\"a North American leader in recycling and composting programs\\".Kerry Gillespie, \\"Green bin gets red carpet\\", Toronto Star, October 20, 2004, B2; Toronto.ca Toronto currently recycles and composts 40% of the garbage collected by the city; it plans to increase this figure to 60% in 2010, and 100% in 2012.Jennifer Lewington, \\"City moves to buy landfill that can last years\\", The Globe and Mail, September 20, 2006, A12. Some have questioned the accuracy of the 40% number. See John Lorinc, \\"This numbers game is garbage\\", The Globe and Mail, November 18, 2006, M1. Miller reiterated his opposition to trash incineration in the 2006 mayoral campaign.John Spears and Kerry Gillespie, \\"Burning trash costly: Miller\\", Toronto Star, November 1, 2006, B1. The final legal hurdle to the Green Lane purchase was resolved in March 2007, and the deal was signed in early April.Jennifer Lewington, \\"Landfill deal reached after secret debate\\", The Globe and Mail, March 29, 2007, A3; Jennifer Lewington, \\"Toronto trash gets new home\\", The Globe and Mail, April 4, 2007, A15. =Housing policy= Miller convened a summit on affordable housing in late February 2004, bringing in representatives from all three levels of government. As the summit was formally convened, he secured $24 million in funding from the provincial government to construct more than 900 units of housing for low-to-middle income earners.\\"Martin's \\"home\\" run\\", Toronto Star, February 26, 2004, A24; \\"Cash to build 900 affordable homes a sure thing\\", Toronto Star, February 26, 2004, B2. Council voted later in the year to approve $13.6 million for new housing projects, amounting to 312 new homes.Paul Moloney, \\"Housing approvals signal a city trend\\", Toronto Star, August 3, 2004, B1. Miller's housing advisor, Sean Goetz-Gadon, argued in 2004 that Toronto could accommodate 10,000 subsidized housing units for both people experiencing homelessness and those at risk of homelessness.Carol Goar, \\"\\"Welcome truce on housing front\\", Toronto Star, April 28, 2004, A22. Miller brought forward a series of measures to provide shelter and warmth for Toronto's homeless population during the winter months in 2004, including a decision to set up an emergency centre before Christmas. The shelter had 80 beds, and provided reference services. During the previous Lastman administration, the city had responded to specific emergencies rather than determining a strategy in advance.Jennifer Lewington, \\"Eyeing winter, Miller pushes warm-up plan for homeless\\", The Globe and Mail, November 4, 2004, A18; Catherine Porter, \\"City shelter to help find homes\\", Toronto Star, December 2, 2004, B2. In early 2005, Miller helped steer a motion through council which banned the people from sleeping in Nathan Phillips Square. He said that the plan was intended as a \\"nudge\\" to push people in the direction of finding shelters, and added that no one would be arrested.Catherine Porter, \\"Homeless face icy reception\\", Toronto Star, January 20, 2005, B2. The initiative entitled Streets to Homes also called for the creation of 1,000 new affordable housing units per year, and the creation of another emergency shelter.Catherine Porter, \\"From the street to their own home\\", Toronto Star, January 31, 2005, B2. Members of the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty protested Miller's plans during a council meeting in late January. See Royson James, \\"Spectacle only helps Miller's plan\\", Toronto Star, February 2, 2005, B3. By December 2005, the city had helped 533 people experiencing homelessness find permanent apartments.Jeff Gray, \\"Hundreds of homeless off streets\\", The Globe and Mail, December 30, 2005, A1. In May 2005, Miller's administration presided over the approval of 6,500 new units of housing on brownfield land near the Don River. The project, originally called Ataratiri, had been delayed for 17 years.Jennifer Lewington, \\"West Don Lands gets the nod\\", The Globe and Mail, May 6, 2005, A15. Two months later, Miller led council in creating a new committee to fast-track the approval of affordable housing.Jeff Gray and Jennifer Lewington, \\"Council approves affordable housing changes\\", The Globe and Mail, July 20, 2005, A9. In February 2006, Miller began a comprehensive housing renewal project in Toronto's Regent Park area.Michael Peeling, \\"Regent Park bricks begin to tumble\\", National Post, February 14, 2006, A8. In January 2007, Miller criticized an Ontario Municipal Board decision which allowed a high-rise project on Queen Street West. The area is known for art galleries and low-rent studios, and Miller has argued that high-rise construction will compromise the city's creative sector.Raveena Aulakh and Jennifer Lewington, \\"Mayor condemns OMB ruling\\", The Globe and Mail, January 17, 2007, A14. He later introduced a motion directing staff to \\"pursue all available options\\" against the OMB's decision.

Toronto is expected to receive the largest share of the revenue.Robert Benzie, \\"City gets housing boost\\", Toronto Star, February 28, 2007, A1. =Culture= Miller created a new Toronto Film Board in November 2004 to improve the economic prospects of the city's multibillion-dollar film industry. He was himself designated as the board's chair, and convened its first meeting in February 2005.Jennifer Lewington, \\"Mayor to propose city set up film board\\", The Globe and Mail, November 23, 2004, A19; Bruce DeMara, \\"Miller-led board eyes film industry rescue\\", Toronto Star, December 1, 2004, B2; Murray Whyte, \\"Board aims to boost film industry\\", Toronto Star, February 11, 2005, B2.

In June 2005, Miller welcomed a federal commitment to provide $1.9 billion to Ontario municipalities over five years from federal gas tax revenues.James Cowan, \\"PM signs Ontario cities deal\\", National Post, June 18, 2005, A10. This program was extended in 2006 by Martin's successor as Prime Minister, Stephen Harper. See Bruce Campion-Smith, \\"New deal for cities lives on but quietly\\", Toronto Star, January 20 F1. Miller convened a meeting of Canada's major urban mayors in January 2004, and argued at the summit that Canadian cities needed enhanced powers of governance to deal with a variety modern challenges. In September of the same year, Miller hosted a meeting of ten major city Canadian mayors, examining the issue of federal gas tax revenues.Bruce DeMara, \\"Leaders seek gas-tax magic\\", Toronto Star, September 17, 2004, B2. In February 2004, Miller called for greater coordination between all three levels of government in overseeing patterns of immigration within Canada.Nicholas Keung, \\"Cities want immigration deal\\", Toronto Star, February 10, 2004, A14. In early 2005, the City of Toronto earmarked up to $5 million to assist about 2,000 refugees who were expected to arrive from tsunami- ravaged areas of Southeast Asia.Jennifer Lewington, \\"City sets aside $5-million to resettle tsunami refugees\\", The Globe and Mail, January 14, 2005, A10.

Miller endorsed only two candidates in the 2006 federal election: Liberal John Godfrey and New Democrat Peggy Nash.\\"Miller plays it cool for election\\", The Globe and Mail, December 3, 2005, A24. Unsuccessful NDP candidate and former provincial MPP Marilyn Churley blamed Miller for withholding support from other New Democrats. According to one report, Churley briefly mused challenging him for mayor in 2006 before deciding not to do so. Miller supported Paul Martin's call for a total ban on handguns, and urged Martin to bring forward tougher bail conditions on persons accused of gun crimes.Anne Dawson and Allan Woods, \\"Critics assail gun plan\\", National Post, December 9, 2005, A1.

Despite ideological differences, Miller commended Stephen Harper, who was elected as Martin's successor in 2006, for taking urban issues seriously. Miller supported the appointment of Lawrence Cannon as Minister for Communities in February 2006, and tried without success to persuade the Harper government against eliminating Canada's national child-care plan.John Spears and Stan Josey, \\"Miller looks at new cabinet, says he sees lots of positives\\", Toronto Star, February 7, 2006, B4; David Miller, \\"Don't kill national child- care plan\\", Toronto Star, February 16, 2006, A21.

In early March 2007, the Harper government introduced a $1.5 billion plan to assist Toronto's public transit system and expand provincial highways. Miller welcomed the new revenue, saying that it was a step in the direction of permanent funding.Chinta Puxley, \\"PM mends fences with Ontario with more than $1.5B for transit, environment\\", Canadian Press, March 6, 2007, 16:15; Peter Brieger, \\"$1.5B to ease gridlock: Tories pledge money for GTA transit and highways\\", National Post, March 7, 2007, A1.

Globe and Mail columnist John Barber, however, has noted that this was not echoed by other city mayors and described the One Cent Campaign as \\"wishful thinking\\". With Dalton McGuinty's 2007 provincial budget also being similarly dismissive of Miller's demands, Barber suggested that the city could realistically solve its problems by making use of its new taxing powers.John Barber, \\"Miller's propaganda penny-wise, policy-foolish\\", The Globe and Mail, March 24, 2007, A10. Theglobeandmail.com During the 2008 federal election campaign, Miller declared that the Green Party of Canada was the only one to directly address city issues such as transit and infrastructure. He went on to say that he wasn't endorsing any particular party.\\"Toronto mayor suggests Greens best bet for cities\\", CBC News. September 17, 2008. On June 18, 2009, Miller requested federal funding from the Harper government's $12-billion stimulus spending, for new streetcars in the Transit City initiative. The city faced a deadline of June 27, 2009 to commit to the $1.2-billion deal signed with Bombardier for the 204 streetcars. To put pressure on the Harper government to come up with its one-third share of the cost, Miller and Premier Dalton McGuinty made an announcement in Thunder Bay to fund the new streetcars. However, federal Transport Minister John Baird rejected the request outright. Baird stated that streetcar funding clearly failed to meet the stimulus bill's requirement that the funds would have to be spent in 2 years, as that was meant to put money into the economy quickly to buoy demand and staving off deflation, while Transit City would have been a long-term project. Also the stimulus required funds to be spent on infrastructure in the municipality where the application is granted to create local employment, whereas the jobs created by building streetcars would be in Thunder Bay and not Toronto. Baird noted that Toronto was the only one out of 2,700 applicants that didn't meet the eligibility criteria. =One Cent campaign= Miller formally launched a campaign for Canada's cities to receive one of six cents charged on every dollar under the existing Goods and Services Tax at the Toronto City Summit Alliance's Toronto Summit 2007. He has argued that the transfer will provide a reliable and permanent source of funding for cities. A website called www.onecentnow.ca has been set up to promote the campaign.\\"Mayor David Miller launches campaign to fund cities - One Cent of the GST NOW!\\" [press release], Canada NewsWire, February 26, 2007, 13:30. Karen Stintz and several other councillors criticized Miller for spending $100,000 on the program before it was debated on and approved by council, and suggesting that he was advancing his personal agenda. Miller's office argued that council approval was unnecessary for the initiative, as it had appeared in his campaign platform.Donovan Vincent, \\"Mayor's one-cent bid under fire\\", Toronto Star, March 7, 2007, C3. Federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty has indicated that he does not support the proposal, stating that he would be \\"interested in reducing taxes for all Canadians and directly to Canadians, not through other governments.\\"Jennifer Lewington, \\"Miller campaigns for slice of GST\\", The Globe and Mail, February 27, 2007, A2. Liberal opposition leader Stéphane Dion endorsed a permanent gas tax transfer to municipalities, but stopped short of endorsing Miller's GST proposal.\\"Dion promises Miller gas tax revenues instead of one-cent share of GST\\", National Post, February 28, 2007, A10. Liberal MP John Godfrey said the proposal needed to be further defined before any party would support it.\\"Public fails to buy into One Cent Now campaign\\", April 14, 2007, National Post, James Cowan, Canada.com Critics of the one cent campaign said that it was losing support, citing declining petition signatures and no federal politicians on side, and suggested that residents have become desensitized to Miller's frequent calls for outside funding to fix the city's problems. Miller remained optimistic, saying that it was too early to judge the success of the program, and argued that he had successfully put back on the agenda the idea that national success was linked to cities. In early May 2007, mayors from Canada's 22 largest cities gave their unanimous support to the one-cent plan.Jennifer Lewington, \\"One-cent now' campaign stirs big-city mayors to lobby Ottawa\\", The Globe and Mail, 4 Mary 2007, A15. Mississauga mayor Hazel McCallion initially expressed pessimism over Miller's 'One-cent now' campaign, stating that \\"I can assure you our citizens [of Mississauga] can't point out to us where there's a lot of waste. Toronto, unfortunately, has that situation, in which their citizens are saying it, as well as their board of trade has been saying it and even their own councillors are saying it\\". Denzil Minnan-Wong compared the two mayors, saying \\"Hazel McCallion runs a tight ship. David Miller's ship has leaks all over the place,\\" and some commentators suggested that Toronto would have a difficult time making a credible case to the federal government for funding. She unveiled her own plan known as 'Cities Now!' to get federal funding for municipal infrastructure.Communities.canada.com Canada.com However, McCallion's proposal did not receive support during a meeting with fifteen regional mayors, and she agreed to support Miller's campaign.Chris Wattie, Mayoral smackdown: Miller wins, but compromises. National Post. November 19, 2007. Communities.canada.com Provincial government Miller's relations with the provincial government of Dalton McGuinty have generally been cordial, although the two governments have had disputes over finances. Miller argues that the former provincial government of Mike Harris burdened the city with disproportionately high service costs, and has asked the provincial government to re-assume responsibility for some of these programs. As of 2007, Toronto pays $730 million for services that were provincial responsibilities before Harris came to power (Harris stated that the downloads were necessary to reduce the provincial deficit, and to compensate for reduced transfer payments from the federal government of Jean Chrétien).\\"New deal for cities far from complete\\" [editorial], Toronto Star, January 11, 2007, A24.

Miller later criticized the McGuinty government's proposal to negotiate future projects with the Association of Municipalities of Ontario rather than with individual municipalities, arguing that this would weaken Toronto's negotiating ability.William Lin and Kerry Gillespie, \\"City left out in cold: Moscoe\\", Toronto Star, August 22, 2004, A6.

Miller supported the change, saying that municipal leaders need longer terms of office to carry out their mandate.Angela Pacienza, \\"Municipal election terms extended\\", The Globe and Mail, May 11, 2006, A14.

Miller responded that Toronto's share was only $275 million, with the remainder coming from the provincial and federal governments.Jeff Gray, \\"Pitfield vows to fight tax hike\\", The Globe and Mail, March 29, 2006, A13. Pitfield was unable to provide the specific increase in municipal spending when questioned by reporters.

Kidin, \\"Can You Believe the Length of this Wiki Entry??\\", Toronto DeathStar, February 22, 2009, A1. 2010 election On September 25, 2009, Miller announced that he would not seek a third term as mayor in the 2010 election, citing family reasons. An Ipsos Reid poll earlier that month revealed that almost 8 in 10 Torontonians wanted Miller replaced as mayor, over dissatisfaction at his handling of the 39-day municipal strike. Many of Miller's supporters had defected to other potential candidates, likely to be former Ontario Progressive Conservative leader John Tory or Deputy Premier George Smitherman. In early October 2010, Miller gave his endorsement to Deputy Mayor Joe Pantalone, who claimed that he was \\"no clone of David Miller\\", but whose platform largely continued the status quo with Miller's policies, in contrast to the other mayoral candidates who advocated sweeping changes. Pantalone was lagging considerably behind Councillor Rob Ford and former Ontario Deputy Premier George Smitherman in polls,Miller to endorse Pantalone  Toronto & GTA  News. Toronto Sun (October 5, 2010). Retrieved on 2013-07-26. and Smitherman dismissed Miller's support of Pantalone saying \\"If voters wanted the status quo, David Miller would still be in this race.\\" Miller has accused Ford and Smitherman of wanting to \\"tear down Toronto\\", and suggested that Smitherman posed the greater danger as mayor. Late in the campaign, Smitherman left a voice-mail with Miller to ask Pantalone to withdraw from the race but Miller never returned the call. (Back in the 2003 mayoral election, Smitherman had worked for the campaign of Barbara Hall, which tried to persuade Miller to drop out of the race.) Ford was elected mayor with 47.1% of the vote, while Smitherman and Pantalone finished second and third, with 35.6% and 11.7%, respectively. Post-mayoral career Following his term as mayor, Miller rejoined the law firm of Aird & Berlis LLP where he specialized in international business and sustainability. He split his time between Toronto and Brooklyn, New York, where he accepted a three- year appointment at the Polytechnic Institute of New York University as Future of Cities Global Fellow to teach courses on finding technological solutions to urban problems. In 2013 he was appointed president and CEO of WWF-Canada, the Canadian division of the international World Wildlife Fund. At the end of 2017, he left his position as CEO of WWF-Canada to become North American director for C40 Cities climate change coalition.https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/10/04/former-toronto-mayor- david-miller-joins-climate-change-coalition.html Electoral record = Municipal politics = Electors could vote for two candidates in the 1997 election.

Like many Young Communist organisations, it was modelled after the Soviet Komsomol. It aimed to cultivate young cadres into the party, as well as to help create the \\"new man\\" envisioned by communist ideologues. History Founded in 1922, the UTC went underground along with the rest of the party when it was banned in 1924. A marginal group under strict control of the Comintern's Young Communist International, it began to emerge as a mass movement in 1944, after the Red Army had entered Romania and the party became legal once again. Nicolae Ceaușescu was the First Secretary of the UTC from August 23, 1944 to June 1945. Beginning in 1948, the Romanian Workers' Party (PMR, as it was then called) began to contemplate merging and purging the country's youth organisations - political, professional, religious, cultural, etc. At the same time, young people were faced with several waves of arrests. Starting in 1945, participants at anti- communist demonstrations were arrested, while category-based arrests began in 1948. Members of youth liberal, peasant, and Iron Guard organisations were targeted, and political and religious youth organisations were shut down. The educational reform of 3 August 1948 initiated the ideological re-education of youth and Sovietization of the educational system by restructuring it along Marxist-Leninist principles. That year, the Komsomol recommended the formation of a single youth group, and at a congress on March 19-21, 1949, hitherto separate youth organisations were merged to create a Union of Working Youth (Uniunea Tineretului Muncitoresc; UTM). Its name was changed back to UTC in 1965. Right after the single organisation was formed, the party asked for a purge, which in its first phase involved the \\"re-signing up\\" of UTM members (equivalent to PMR \\"verification\\" campaigns). After this process, 34,000 UTM members and activists were purged as \\"dangerous elements\\" (kulaks (chiaburi), former Iron Guard or National Christian Party members, former members of democratic parties, religious activists (especially non-Orthodox ones), UTM leaders who did not heed PRM decisions, etc.). The UTM now numbered 650,000 members; purges would continue, under the pretext of \\"improving its class composition\\", especially after the turbulent years of 1952, 1956, and 1968. Removal from the UTM could mean social exclusion, professional marginalisation or even open the way to a criminal investigation. One's social origin and membership in a communist organisation were the most important factors in climbing up the political, social and professional ladders. UTM purges were one way that institutions, universities, schools, army units and factories were cleansed of troublesome elements. These purges had a major social impact, quickly and decisively changing the face of society, as membership steadily rose (some 20% of youths were in UTM in 1950; by the end of the decade, a third; in another decade, half; and by the 1980s the great majority). One major dilemma was how to deal with the peasantry. Poor peasants were at first eagerly welcomed into the UTM, but 40% of those initially purged were peasants. This made the group rather unrepresentative in a country whose population was three-quarters rural at the time. The beginning of collectivisation in 1949 demanded a large presence of communist organisations in the villages, but by the end of the 1950s, only about 28.5% of the eligible rural population was in the UTM, which numbered 30-35% peasants. Their share steadily fell as urbanisation increased, to about a quarter in the 1960s and under 20% in the 1980s. Starting in the 1950s, UTM activists were mobilised to help with collectivisation, participating in propaganda actions and unmasking class enemies at the party's behest. At UTM meetings, members were asked to convince their relatives and friends to give over their land to collectives, to denounce kulaks and those who opposed collectivisation, and even to speak out against marriages between kulaks and poor peasant girls. In 1952, as Ana Pauker fell from grace for her \\"right-wing deviationism\\" that involved massive membership sign-ups, which, without proper vetting, had introduced numerous Iron Guardists and other \\"enemy elements\\" into the party, the ensuing purge hit the UTM as well. Between August 1952 and June 1953, 19,000 UTM members and activists were excluded for \\"right-wing deviationism\\". By contrast, 12,000 had been eliminated between October 1950 and August 1952. The crisis was accompanied by several leadership changes until 1956, when the party found in Virgil Trofin, who had worked as an officer in the Superior Political Directorate of the Army, the iron hand it was searching for to control the UTM; he held the post for eight years before being promoted into the party, surviving the successive intra-party crises of the late 1950s. After the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, the UTM began to target university and high- school students. In fact they had long been eyed with suspicion for ideological reasons. Students had played a key role in the anti-communist demonstrations of 1945-46. Half of those initially purged from the UTM were students. In 1950, instructions for admission of new members specified that meritorious students \\"devoted to the organisation and the Party\\" would be admitted. At the same time, ideological criteria were applied for university admission, on the basis of social origin and pre-communist political allegiance (either of the students themselves or of their parents). Of 57,000 students, some 80-90% were in the UTM, as admission was otherwise very hard to obtain. By 1953, university and high-school students formed almost 30% of the UTM, a figure that declined sharply after 1956. In 1957 it had fallen to under 20%, and to under 10% by 1958-59, due to the massive purges provoked by the student protests of 1956. During these demonstrations, UTM activists were instructed to prevent, discourage, denounce, unmask and fight against the \\"enemy protests\\" and were mobilised, alongside party activists and workers, to spy on student gatherings, crush demonstrations and waste students' free time. During the Bucharest student movement of 1956, groups of young UTM workers were assembled to physically beat the \\"bandits\\" (i.e., student protesters), and in 1957, UTM activists helped arrest young protesters in Cluj. Starting in 1956, several thousand students were arrested, of whom tens were sent to prison. Countless unmasking and indoctrination sessions were held by PMR and UTM leaders and activists. Tens of UTM chapters across Romania were dissolved. Up to 1,500 UTM members were removed from the group every month. For the first time since 1948, total membership declined. Between July 1, 1956 and July 1, 1957, the proportion of workers in the UTM rose from 27% to 35%, while that of university and high-school students fell from 14% to 9%. Students at theological institutes were expelled from the UTM. During this period, Ion Iliescu, head of the UTC between 1967 and 1971, led the Union of Romanian Communist Student Associations.Uniunea Asociațiilor Studenților Comuniști din Romania (UASR) was yet another mass student organisation; the Union of Romanian Schoolchildren's Associations (UAER; Uniunea Asociațiilor Elevilor din Romania), in which Iliescu was also active, was its junior wing. After Nicolae Ceaușescu came to power in 1965, he pursued the goal of expanding mass organisations, trying to include as many people as possible in communist structures. Thus, while in 1960 UTM had 1.9 million members, UTC had 2.4 million members in 1971, 3.9 million in 1985, and 4.1 million by the end of the 1980s, when it was one of the most powerful mass organisations in the country. In 1983, 90% of 9th graders belonged to the UTC, and 98% in 1988. Beginning in 10th grade, practically everyone was in the UTC, membership being mostly automatic and compulsory. Those not in were usually excluded or expelled for some reason rather than simply not interested. In the 1970s and 1980s, internal instructions for admission to the UTC combined political and meritocratic criteria. The UTC's anti-religious mission persisted. For instance, on December 26, 1968, Ion Iliescu convened an urgent session of the UTC's Central Committee to express his distress at the lack of combativeness displayed by UTC members toward 2,000 Christmas carolers the day before.\\"Ion Iliescu a condamnat colindătorii în 1968 până i-a băgat la beci \\" (\\"Ion Iliescu Condemned the Carolers in 1968 until He Put Them in Prison\\"), Gândul, December 20, 2006. =Structure= Membership was open to persons between the ages of fourteen and twenty-six; UTC members over eighteen could also become members of the PCR. The Tenth Party Congress in 1969 introduced the requirement that applicants under the age of twenty-six would be accepted into the party only if they were UTC members. Having essentially the same organizational structure as the Romanian Communist Party (PCR, from 1965), the UTC was both a youth political party and a mass organization. Its mission was to indoctrinate young people in the spirit of communism and mobilize them, under the guidance of the PCR, for the building of socialism. The UTC organised political and patriotic courses in schools, among peasant groups, and among workers and members of the armed forces. It also guided and supervised the activities of the Union of Romanian Communist Student Associations. The structure of the UTC underwent a number of changes in the decades following its creation. By the 1980s, the organization functioned on the national level with an eight-member Secretariat, including the first secretary, who was also the UTC chairman, and a bureau of twenty-one full and ten candidate members. The first secretary of the UTC also held the position of minister of youth. From 1983 to 1987, Ceauşescu's son, Nicu, functioned as UTC first secretary. This showed the importance of youth organisations for the regime, as Nicu was virtually the heir to power, and was also a clear indication of its dynastic and clientelistic nature. Nicu's poor reputation contributed to cynicism and corruption in the youth organisations, whose members had become blasé, bureaucratic and ritualised in nature, a far cry from their predecessors' fervor in the 1940s-1950s. The UTC had come to serve the dictator's personality cult, a form of political consolidation and social control. In each of the forty counties (which took their present form in 1968) and the city of Bucharest, UTC committees were patterned after the national- level organization. The UTC had its own publishing facilities and published its own propaganda organ, Scînteia Tineretului (\\"The Spark of Youth\\"). Other organizations Members of Șoimii Patriei around 1983, standing beneath a portrait of Ceaușescu Another youth movement, the Pioneer Organization, was created for young people between the ages of nine and fourteen. Until 1966 the Pioneers functioned as an integral part of the UTC, but thereafter they were under the direct control of the party Central Committee. Moreover, there were Șoimii Patriei (\\"The Fatherland's Falcons\\"), a youth organization established in 1976 where children aged four to seven could enter and where they learned to respect the party, also participating in demonstrations. The UTC, the Pioneers and Şoimii Patriei, like the rest of the party, ceased to exist after the Romanian Revolution of 1989.

Born in Carlingford in Ireland Boyle was a left back whose most successful playing spell was with Sheffield United with whom he reached the FA Cup Final on three occasions, playing on the winning side on two of them. He also played for Sunderland and Motherwell as well as representing Ireland on five occasions. He later had a brief spell as player-manager with York City in 1912. Career =Club career= Boyle moved from his home in Scotland to join Sunderland in 1896, making his Football League debut against Blackburn Rovers in December of that year. After two years at the Tyne and Wear club he moved South to the League Champions Sheffield United in December 1898 for £175. He became a regular for the Blades in a period when they were a dominant force in English football, finishing runners up in the league in his first season and winning the FA Cup in both 1899 and 1902 along with another unsuccessful appearance in the 1901 FA Cup Final. Described as a 'robust' player by the local media he was considered a 'fine tackler' and 'superb kicker' during his time at Bramall Lane. By 1903 however his relationship with the club had deteriorated following a dispute after the club failed to award him a benefit match which he believed he was owed. He was twice suspended for 'misconduct' before being transferred for a 'nominal' fee of £100 in 1904. Having told United that he wished to return to Scotland Boyle spent only one season at Motherwell before he moved to Clapton Orient who had recently been admitted to the Football League. He then drifted back into the amateur game with brief spells at Wigan Town, Chorley and Eccles Borough where his playing career looked to have come to an end. After several years out of the game however Boyle was appointed as player-manager of newly admitted Midland League team York City in 1912, before being replaced by Tommy Collier later the same season. =International career= Boyle was capped five times for Ireland during his time with the Sheffield United. He would have won several more had he not rejected the call up on a number of occasions to play for the Blades instead. Personal life Although born in Ireland, Boyle's family had moved to Scotland when he was a child and it was here he began playing football regularly. Following the end of his playing career he worked as a miner at Brodsworth Colliery where he also coached the colliery football team, Brodsworth Main, now Brodsworth Welfare AFC. His son Tommy Boyle would also go on to play for Sheffield United with whom he too won an FA Cup winners medal in 1925.

The Penal Laws, which outlawed Catholic observances, meant the people of Cashel assembled for worship outside, at mass rocks close to Lady Well and at Derryhaun. ;Harbour and islands Barley Harbour is cut-limestone harbour located outside the village on the lakeshore. Four groups of islands are in the parish of Cashel: the Black Islands; Clawinch, Priests' Island and Inis Clothrann. St Diarmuid founded a monastery on Inis Clothrann around 540 AD. On Saints' Island are the ruins of an Augustinian monastery that survived until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century. A canon named Augustine McGradion (Uighistin Mag Ráidhin) compiled the Annals of [All] Saints (Annales Prioratus Insulae Omnium SS) in this monastery in the 15th century. This island can now be accessed via a causeway. ;Castles Five castles are recorded in the parish of Cashel: Elfeet, Caltramore, Corool, Portanure and the castle of Baile Nui (Newtown). The ruins of Elfeet Castle can still be seen. George Calvert, the owner of a 15th-century tower house in the area, became governor of the province (later state) of Maryland and founder of Baltimore in America.

Anyone may upload programs and the content is posted to the web page immediately. Origins The A-Infos audio internet archive began in response to a reorganisation of the Pacifica radio station that eliminated many of its more controversial programmers. An interview with Lyn Gerry reports that the original intention of the project was \\"to create a “wire service” of sorts where radio producers can source other producer's material in a wide process of collaboration.\\" It may have been the first website to allow free upload and download of audio files, a deliberately created free alternative to the concentration of corporate media outlets and perspectives.Thesis paper Operations Radio4all accepts donations from its users and has never carried advertising or received corporate sponsorship. Radio4All.net is operated exclusively by volunteers on an occasional basis, many of whom have never met in person, but who communicate through a mailing list. Lyn Gerry has stated that the decision not to censor any material was mainly pragmatic.MP3 Interview Skidmark Bob interviews Lyn Gerry about A-Infos Radio Project Contents The A-Infos Radio Project was the first grassroots media project of its kind on the internet to allow free upload and download of programs, and has attracted a wide variety of audio material. The focus remains on public domain radio programmes from various perspectives and often of an alternative political nature. Programs address both local and global issues and perspectives vary substantially, but the most often included are environmentalism, socialism, humanitarianism and anarchism. Beginning in the late 1990s using dial up modem connections talented program producers and micro-radio stations began exchanging radio programming segments using radio4all.net as an open audio library. Lyn (Lyn Gerry) Attended the N.A.B. 2000 counter convention in San Francisco CA Radio Show #31 and presented this concept to the then hopeful Low Power FM station applicants who were awaiting FCC licensing of this new type of Local Non-Corporate radio station service. In a few years more than 500 LPFM stations were licensed and began broadcasting and creating content and sharing it with other like minded station across North America and worldwide. Radio4all.net ran as a free service worked well for the no-budget LPFM stations springing up across the country.(WSCA,WRIR Shows in mp3, WCOM,KNFS,KQRP, KRFP KRFP-LP, FRSC,etc.) In December 2016 the archive reached 90,000 uploads from over 5,000 producers, of which around 68,000 were still available for download. As a 100% non- commercial operation, it relies on donations. The site has occasional outages and has occasionally limited download speed. On May 14, 2012 the site suffered an outage due to late payment of domain renewal charges, but was soon restored. The site functions autonomously without human intervention or moderation; anyone can upload or download programs.

Much of Boyce’s earlier work was published with help from her parents, Mary and Henry Harrison Boyce. Neith Boyce later co-founded the Provincetown Players alongside Susan Glaspell, George Cram Cook, her husband Hutchins Hapgood, and others. Boyce worked with the Provincetown Players in several capacities that included directing, performing, hosting productions in her home, and having all four of her plays produced. Boyce’s plays featured plots that focused on women’s sexuality, personal relationships, and agency.  Early life  Neith Boyce was born in Franklin, Indiana, the second of five children to Henry Harrison Boyce and Mary Boyce. Henry Harrison Boyce had a wife and child before his relationship with Mary Boyce. This first marriage ended in a complicated divorce. In 1880, the diphtheria epidemic resulted in the death of all the Boyce children, except for Neith. The now family of three traveled from Milwaukee to Indiana and finally settled in Los Angeles. Neith Boyce was self-educated in her family home in Franklin, Indiana. She did this by reading the books in her parents’ library. She later attended an alternative college that was overseen by an “old melancholy clerical gentleman.” Like most women at the time, Boyce also received music lessons.  Career  = Early Writing and Journalism = Neith began publishing pieces as a teenager in the 1880s in the Los Angeles Times, which her father co-founded. By the mid-1880s the Boyces were leading citizens in Los Angeles. The family later moved to Boston in 1891, where Mary Boyce became an associate editor for The Cycle, which was a publication oriented towards women’s rights issues. Mary Boyce helped publish a great deal of Neith Boyce’s editorial work and poetry. The first of Neith Boyce's works to be published with the help of her mother was a segment titled “women’s nature poetry.” After her family moved to New York in 1896, Boyce began publishing articles and short stories successfully in Vogue magazine. By the late 1890s, Neith Boyce was living in Greenwich Village with two other young women, who, like herself, were salaried newspaperwomen. The three made their way by writing for various New York City newspapers. Neith Boyce worked for Lincoln Steffens, then editor of The Commercial Advertiser. Boyce published her first book in 1896, The Chap-Book.Neith Boyce c.1900 = Playwright = Boyce’s husband, Hapgood, took to spending summers in Provincetown, Massachusetts. Boyce became involved with the local community of female playwrights in Provincetown and was one of the founding members of the Provincetown Players. All four of Boyce’s works for the stage were first presented by the Provincetown Players. Boyce also wrote, directed, and performed for the company. Major themes that are consistent throughout Boyce’s work include: * Cases that argue for young men and women to experience periods of sexual or relational experimentation to avoid making serious mistakes. * The power of social conventions, whether for good or evil. * The negative effects on women’s character from having to cope with life independently. * The general difficulty of women’s lives. Boyce’s Constancy (1914) inaugurated the first season of the theatre that would become the Provincetown Players. The play deals with the tempestuous relationship between two of her summer neighbors who were also members of the Provincetown Players, Mabel Dodge and John Reed. Boyce addresses sexual double standards through satirizing the love affair between Dodge and Jack Reed, both of whom were married at the time to other people. In the play, the male lead, Rex, cannot remain faithful to his lover, Moira, yet expects her to await his return from his latest love affair. This topic points to Boyce’s frustration with the sexual double standard in her own marriage, as well as the hypocrisies practiced by the male members of the Provincetown Players. The second production was of Enemies (1916) which was a collaboration between Neith Boyce and her husband. Enemies was written as a dialogue between a man and a woman that reflected the then contemporary war between the sexes. Neith Boyce wrote the woman’s lines, and Hutchins Hapgood wrote the man’s. The couple appeared in the play when it premiered in Provincetown. Enemies was one the first plays to be produced for radio. Both Two Sons and Winter’s Night were produced in 1916, however, a printed version of Winter’s Night was not available until 1928. This published copy of Winter’s Night featured several revisions from the script originally presented in Provincetown. Winter’s Night features a female protagonist who rejects a proposal from her late husband's brother to start a dress-making business. This results in the suitor’s suicide.  Personal life  Neith Boyce met her husband, Hutchins Hapgood, while working for The Commercial Advertiser. Hapgood himself had a long career as a novelist and journalist. They married on June 22, 1899. The two would function as friends and advisors to such cultural celebrities as Mabel Dodge, Djuna Barnes, Alfred Stieglitz, Georgia O’Keeffe, and Gertrude Stein. Hapgood and Boyce had what was outwardly claimed to be a “modern marriage” in which both partners were equal, and neither was bound by sexual fidelity. However, behind closed doors, Boyce was solely responsible for the children, while Hapgood enjoyed numerous affairs. Hapgood’s jealousy prevented Boyce from enjoying the sexual freedom that he enjoyed for himself. Her one exception to this restrictive marriage was Hapgood’s support of her writing, and Boyce’s ability to use her writing as a means to voice her own discontent and frustration. Boyce died in Richmond, New Hampshire.

Biography =Early life and career= Hager was born on May 25, 1951, in Champaign- Urbana, Illinois, the son of Lowell P. Hager and Francis Erea Hager. While a student in junior high, he established his first publication, the Cap'n Crunch Courier, a humor xerox zine that was given away free. Two years later, while a student at Urbana High School, he created The Tin Whistle, a monthly newspaper that was eventually distributed in four high schools in Central Illinois. One of his friends, Jim Wilson (later known as Chef Ra), became the first black elected Senior Class President at Urbana High. Wilson was later banned from the football team, even though he had been the starting end and place kicker because of his association with Hager. Hager briefly visited Haight-Ashbury in 1968, and the following year he attended the first Woodstock festival. He obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Theater (Playwriting), and a Masters of Science in Journalism, both from the University of Illinois. After graduation, Hager moved to New York City, worked for a number of magazines before becoming a reporter for the New York Daily News. During this time, he began researching the hip hop movement of the South Bronx. His first article on the subculture was published on the cover of the Village Voice and was the first time the words \\"hip hop\\" appeared in the Village Voice .Hip-Hop Journalists Host Round Table Panel Discussion by Clover Hope -- Raquel Cepeda, former editor-in-chief of Russell Simmon’s One World magazine and editor of the book And It Don't Stop: The Best Hip-Hop Journalism of the Last 25 Years, mentioned a piece by writer Steven Hager called “Afrika Bambaataa’s Hip-Hop,” as the first time the term “Hip-Hop” was coined in a major article. The article is reprinted in her book. Hager based his article on interviews with Afrika Bambaataa, founder of the Zulu Nation, and one of the three original hip hop DJs (the others being Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash). Hager sold his original story Beat Street to Harry Belafonte, and the film with the same name was distributed by Orion Pictures. In 1984, St. Martins' Press released his book, Hip Hop, the first history of rap music, break dancing and graffiti art.Hager, Steven. Hip Hop: The Illustrated History of Break Dancing, Rap Music, and Graffiti. St Martin's Press, 1984 (out of print). (In 2012, an ebook version was published at www.smashwords.com.) Hager followed that book with \\"Art After Midnight,\\" an examination of the New York club scene and its influence on artists, primarily Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring and Kenny Scharf.Hager, Steven. Art After Midnight: The East Village Scene. St. Martin's Press, 1986 (out of print). (The entire text of Art After Midnight (including the much-quoted Basquiat interview) was reprinted in The Octopus Conspiracy and Other Vignettes of the Counterculture: From Hippies to High Times to Hip-Hop and Beyond as well as Adventures in the Counterculture.Hager, Steven. Adventures in the Counterculture: From Hip Hop to High Times. High Times Books, 2002.) =High Times and beyond= In 1988, Hager was hired as editor of High Times magazine. He is most famous for removing hard drugs (e.g., cocaine and heroin) from the magazine, and concentrating on advocating personal cultivation of cannabis. Hager became the first editor in the world to publish and promote the work of hemp activist Jack Herer. Hager also created the Cannabis Cup, a cannabis awards ceremony held every Thanksgiving in Amsterdam, and The Freedom Fighters, the first hemp legalization group. The High Times Freedom Fighters were famous for dressing up in Colonial outfits and organizing hemp rallies across America. One rally, The Boston Freedom Rally, quickly became the largest political event in the country, drawing an audience of over 100,000 to the Boston Common. Hager created a garage-rock revival band called the Soul Assassins. The band played many of the rallies. Their biggest show was opening for the Butthole Surfers in front of 50,000 people in Washington, DC. During this time, Hager asked his friend from high school, Jim Wilson, to become a columnist for the magazine. Wilson became known as Chef Ra and contributed a cooking-with-pot article in every magazine for 15 years. Chef Ra was also a member of the High Times Freedom Fighters and became the featured speaker at many of the rallies. In 1990, Hager became the first person outside Marin County to promote 420, and Freedom Fighter councils, Cannabis Cup ceremonies, Whee! festivals were always scheduled for 4:20 PM. In September, 1991, Hager wrote an article in High Times titled \\"Heritage of Stone,\\" a comprehensive analysis of the John F. Kennedy assassination that has been widely circulated on the internet as a definitive article on the subject. Judge Jim Garrison cited it as \\"the best magazine article ever written on the subject.\\" The article indicated Kennedy was likely murdered because of his growing opposition to the Vietnam War, and implicated J. Edgar Hoover and Allen Dulles in the cover-up. In the mid-1990s, Hager turned the membership list of the Freedom Fighters over to NORML, and began concentrating on creating events that advocated the environmental benefits of hemp while also demonstrating the spiritual uses of cannabis. The World Hemp Expo Extravaganja, or Whee! Festivals, were held in Oregon, Washington, Michigan, New York, and Ohio. Unfortunately, most of the promoters who held Whee! festivals found themselves subject to intense law enforcement efforts to shut down their venues. The primary focus of Whee! was a silent, Sunday, sunset meditation for peace in the drug war. During this period, Hager was contacted by the Waldos, the inventors of 420, and became the first person to interview them. Hager created the Counterculture Hall of Fame in 1997 as part of the ceremonies at the Cannabis Cup. Hager learned to shoot and edit video and started documenting all research on videotape. He has produced several feature documentaries including Let Freedom Ring, Secrets of the Dutch Grow Masters, The Cannabis Cup, Saint Stephen, The Tom Forcade Story, and The 20th Cannabis Cup, assembling one of the world's largest archives of cannabis-related video. In 2002 he directed the video shoot that was later released as Live in Amsterdam. In 2004, he wrote most of the narration for a/k/a Tommy Chong and also appears in the film. Hager appeared in Episode #12 (\\"Pittsburgh\\") of the Showtime series Weeds, playing himself at an event modeled on the Cannabis Cup. Hager's 2004 book The Octopus Conspiracy and Other Vignettes of the Counterculture: From Hippies to High Times to Hip-Hop and Beyond compiles some of his previously published work; the chapter \\"Nomenclature of an Octopus Cabal\\" theorizes that a network of secret societies manufactures war for profit and social control. In 2007, he produced a reality television show based around his job at High Times magazine. Hager appears in the 2013 film 420: The Documentary and provides the history of the phrase and its ceremonial use, as well as his role in spreading awareness on the spiritual aspects of cannabis. In 2014 Hager created Abakus Media in Denver, published the ebook Cannabis Cures Cancer?, and founded the Pot Illuminati. His essay \\"The New Pot Enlightenment\\" was included in the 2017 book Cannabis and Spirituality: An Explorer's Guide to an Ancient Plant Spirit Ally. During the pandemic of 2020, Hager created a podcast titled Everything you know is Twisted.

Named after German aviation engineer and inventor Anton Flettner. In a rotor ship the rotors stand vertically and lift is generated at right angles to the wind, to drive the ship forwards. In a rotor airplane the rotor extends sideways in place of a wing and upwards lift is generated. The Magnus effect The Magnus effect is named after Gustav Magnus, the German physicist who investigated it. It describes the force generated by fluid flow over a rotating body, at right angles to both the direction of flow and the axis of rotation. This force on a rotating cylinder is known as Kutta–Joukowski lift, after Martin Kutta and Nikolai Zhukovsky (or Joukowski), who first analyzed the effect. The Flettner rotor is just one form of the Magnus rotor, which in general need not be cylindrical. Marine applications =Rotor ships= E-Ship 1 with Flettner rotors mounted A rotor ship uses one or more Flettner rotors mounted upright. They are rotated by the ship's engines, when they act like sails to propel the ship under wind power. A conventional powered water propeller may or may not be provided for additional operational flexibility. An early prototype, the Baden Baden (formerly the Buckau) crossed the Atlantic in 1925, but interest was not revived until energy-saving became a major concern in the new millennium. The E-Ship 1 was launched in 2008 and new vessels continue to appear. =Stabilizers= A Flettner rotor mounted beneath the waterline of a ship's hull and emerging laterally will act to stabilize the ship in heavy seas. By controlling the direction and speed of rotation, strong lift or downforce can be generated. The largest deployment of the system to date is in the motor yacht Eclipse. Rotor airplanes The Plymouth A-A-2004 on Long Island Sound Some flying machines have been built which use the Magnus effect to create lift with a rotating cylinder at the front of a wing, allowing flight at lower horizontal speeds. The earliest attempt to use the Magnus effect for a heavier-than-air aircraft was in 1910 by a US member of Congress, Butler Ames of Massachusetts. The next attempt was the Plymouth A-A-2004 in the early 1930s, by three inventors in New York state.

They are not found below immediate subtidal habitats, and more likely are found in the highest tier of shallow-water barnacle fauna. They can be found in the most rigorous wave-washed locations, and some species are found in the surf zone above high tide mark, only receiving water from wave action at high tide.  Definition and Discussion  The shell wall consists of eight wall plates, which reduce to six, and four in some species. Plate reduction is accomplished by fusion of rostrolatera with adjacent laterals, or initially by suppression of carinolatus II, reducing plate number from eight to six. Unlike the superfamilies Coronuloidea and Balanoidea, the rostrum rarely fuses with rostrolatus. In soft parts, caudal appendages are rare, and the mandible usually has three or our teeth, rarely five, and frequently bears fine bristles. Cirri I and II, sometimes III, bear specialized setae to comb net-forming cirri for food particles. These are termed comb setae, which are thin spines bearing fine bristles, and card setae (also known as grapple setae). Card setae are grapple-like or wool carder-like in appearance. The other chthamaloid family, Catophragmidae, differs from Chthamalidae in possessing whorls of imbricating basal plates. In field work, this is the easiest characteristic to observe. Taxonomic classification of chthamalid barnacles has proven challenging because of the preferred environment, resulting in convergence of shell and opercular form. Characters used in classification are weighted heavily to soft part morphology. As this requires time and specialized equipment, effort is made in this project to aid identification for field and biodiversity surveyors. Usually, any given region harbors less than three chthamalid species, which will usually concentrate to preferred microhabitats. Becoming familiar with what should be expected in each area narrows the range of species dramatically. Then, unusual finds can be spotted and sampled for further lab study. DNA sequence data and allozyme analyses have proved promising in uncovering cryptic species populations. Excellent examples of species that have been separated initially or only using molecular data include the sister species Chthamalus fragilis and Chthamalus proteus,{{cite journal  author= Paul R.

He also made two appearances for England in 1901. Born in Mexborough, during his time with the Blades he won the Division One championship in 1898 and two FA Cup winners medals in 1899 and 1902. He later went on to have a two-year spell at Bristol City before retiring from full-time football. Playing career =Club career= Nicknamed \\"Cocky\\", Bennett started his career with his home town club of Mexborough, where his form prompted Sheffield United to try and sign him on a number of occasions although both he and his father held out for a better deal. He eventually signed for the Blades in 1896 for a transfer fee of £10. Initially supporters felt Bennett had a surly attitude and was not fit enough to play at the top level as he was a heavy, thick-set man. Dropping two stones following a fitness regime, however, he showed a good turn of speed and became a mainstay of the Blades side that dominated the game in that period. Bennett was the top scorer in the side that were crowned First Division Champions in 1898 and played in the FA Cup finals of 1899, 1901 and 1902, being on the losing side only in 1901. Despite his success Bennett was placed on the transfer list in 1903 but persuaded United to give him a new contract and stayed with the South Yorkshire club until 1905, when he moved to Bristol City. Despite being past his prime, Bennett helped his new club to the Second Division championship in 1906 before retiring from full-time football. =International career= Bennett was awarded two caps for England, playing against Wales and Scotland in the 1901 Home Championship. =Honours= Sheffield United *Division One champions: 1897–98 **Runners-up: 1896–97 and 1899–00 *FA Cup winners: 1899, 1902 **Finalists: 1901 Bristol City *Division Two champions: 1905–06 Personal life Bennett came from a footballing family: his brother William had played for The Wednesday and appeared in the 1890 FA Cup Final, whilst another brother 'Tip' played for Barnsley. After leaving Bristol City he moved to Denaby Main, where he took a job as a miner and played for the local amateur side. Bennett was killed in April 1908 following a roof fall at Denaby Main Colliery as he was making his way back to the surface after his shift, leaving a widow and four children.

The United States Department of Defense MRAP program began in 2007 as a response to the increased threat of IEDs during the Iraq War. From 2007 until 2012, the MRAP program deployed more than 12,000 vehicles in the Iraq War and War in Afghanistan. Production of MRAP vehicles officially ended in 2012. This was followed by the MRAP All Terrain (M-ATV) vehicle. In 2015, Oshkosh Corporation was awarded a contract to build the Oshkosh L-ATV as the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, a lighter mine-resistant vehicle to replace the Humvee in combat roles and supplement the M-ATV. History Light armored vehicles designed specifically to resist land mines were first introduced in specialized vehicles in the 1970s by the Rhodesian Army, and further developed by South African manufacturers, starting in 1974 with the Hippo armored personnel carrier (APC).Heitman, Helmoed-Römer. South African Armed Forces. Buffalo Publications 1990. p 44. The Casspir infantry mobility vehicle was developed for the South African Defence Force after 1980; this was the inspiration for the American MRAP program and the basis for some of the program's vehicles. In 2004, the TSG/FPI Cougar was designed by a British-led U.S. team, to a U.S. Marine Corps requirement. It became the springboard from which the MRAP program was launched.Marine Administrative Message (MARADMIN) 550/2, \\"Urgent USMC Requirements Generation Process for Operation Enduring Freedom,\\" October 16, 2002; MARADMIN 533/03, \\"Operation Iraqi Freedom II UUNS Process,\\" November 21, 2003; MARADMIN 424/04, \\"Operation Iraqi Freedom III UUNS The original concept was to replace Humvee-type vehicles with a more robust, survivable vehicle when on patrol \\"outside the wire\\". Because there are only two \\"armor quality\\" steel mills in the U.S., the Russian-owned Oregon Steel Mills and the International Steel Group (now part of the Indian firm ArcelorMittal), qualified to produce steel armor for the U.S. Department of Defense, it negotiated to ensure enough steel was available to keep pace with production. =MRAP program= The U.S. military's MRAP program was prompted by U.S. casualties from IEDs during the Iraq War.

MRAP Armor Weight Reduction Spiral (MAWRS) Program resulted in armor technologies 40 percent lighter, with technologies fielded on more than 10,000 MRAP vehicles. The program was led by the Army Research Laboratory and MAWRS was fielded on MRAP vehicles in 2008. Forecasting the need for better and lighter protection from Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), ARL developed aggressive weight reduction goals in MRAP vehicles and set out to demonstrate practical technology options by the end of FY08. The program's combined technical approach was to exploit computing and terminal effects experimentation to scale known technologies for the defeat of lED threats, understand the most viable armor mechanisms for efficient penetrator defeat, and then introduce light-weight composites, new materials and enhanced ballistic mechanisms to reduce the add-on weight of final armor packages. The ARL's MAWRS program was recognized by U.S. Army Materiel Command as the \\"Top Ten Great Inventions of 2008.\\" =2009= Oshkosh Corp., Oshkosh, Wisconsin, was awarded a $1,064.46 million firm-fixed-priced delivery order under previously awarded firm-fixed-price contract W56HZV-09-D-0111 to exercise an option for 1,700 MRAP All Terrain Vehicles. A similar Army contract for 1,700 MRAP All-Terrain Vehicles was valued at a further $1,063.7 million. By 2009, the U.S. Department of Defense had spent $20 billion on the MRAP program. Total MRAP program expenditure with final deliveries was expected to be $48.5 billion (FY10-11).  Criticism  The MRAP program has been criticized for its high, nearly $50 billion cost, the potential logistical difficulties due to high fuel consumption and varied designs, a greater disconnection between troops and the local population due to MRAPs' massive size and menacing appearance conflicting with current counter-insurgency (COIN) strategy, and unclear disposal. In 2007, it was unknown what the U.S. military would do with MRAPs following its withdrawal from Iraq, since they are expensive to transport and operate.Defense Tech: Corps Asks for MRAP Slowdown Andrew Krepinevich and Dakota Wood. Of IEDs and MRAPs: Force Protection In Complex Irregular Operations\\" , 17 October 2007. MRAP funding has pulled money away from other tactical vehicle programs, most noticeably the Humvee replacement, the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, which has been delayed by two years.. InsideDefense.com NewsStand: The Insider, 27 September 2007. According to Army Times, troops openly wonder about the design of some MRAP versions. One question centers around the inwards-facing design of the rear seats, given that an outward-facing design would have allowed troops to fire their weapons through ports, which some versions even lacked. The height and steepness of the dropdown stairs at the rear of some versions was observed to make exiting the vehicle dangerous. Also, troops riding in the rear can easily hit their heads on the ceiling while bouncing around in rough terrain, thereby engendering the risk of serious brain and spinal injuries. Earlier reports had stated that the MRAP had been well received, with US troops stating that they would rather be hit by an IED in an MRAP than in a Humvee. = Rollovers and electric shock = A Caiman after rolling into a ditch A report dated 13 June 2008 by the 'Marine Corps Center for Lessons Learned' indicated concerns about MRAP vehicles rolling over in combat zones. The V-shaped hulls of the MRAP give it a higher center of gravity, and the weight of the MRAP can cause the badly built or poorly maintained roads in rural Iraq or Afghanistan to collapse. Of the 66 MRAP accidents between 7 November 2007 and 8 June 2008, almost 40 were due to rollovers caused by bad roads, weak bridges, or driver error. In many of the rollovers, troops were injured. However, in two separate incidents, five soldiers were killed by rolling over into a canal, thereby becoming trapped underwater with no means of escape. The report said 75% of all rollovers occurred in rural areas, often where roads had been built above grade with an adjacent ditch or canal. The report also raised concerns associated with MRAP vehicles snagging on low-hanging power lines in Iraq or its antennas getting close enough to create an electric arc, which may lead to the electrocution of the passengers. The person located in the gunner's hatch is at the highest risk. = Effectiveness = Cougar MRAP hit by a large IED in Iraq. All crew survived The MRAP may not be sufficiently effective against Explosively Formed Penetrators (EFP), which use an explosive charge to propel a specially shaped metal plate at high velocity while simultaneously deforming it into an armor-piercing projectile. Use of EFPs in the Iraq war more than doubled in 2006, and as of 2007 was expected to continue to increase. In 2007, 11 percent of all roadside bomb fatalities were due to EFPs. In 2007, the Marines had estimated that the use of the MRAP could reduce casualties in Iraq due to IED attacks by as much as 80 percent. The MRAP weakness was addressed by the next-generation MRAP II. As an interim solution, the military installed a variant of the Humvee's IED defeating Frag Kit 6 armor, which adds significant weight, as well as width to the already large and heavy vehicle. In July 2008, the U.S. military reported the number of EFP attacks had dropped by 70 percent. On 19 January 2008, a 3rd Infantry Division U.S. Army soldier operating as the exposed turret gunner, was killed in a Navistar MaxxPro MRAP vehicle by an ANFO IED estimated at 600 lb. It is unknown whether the gunner was killed by the explosion or by the vehicle when it rolled over after the blast. The vehicle's v-hull was not compromised. The crew compartment also appeared to be uncompromised, and the three other crew members inside the vehicle survived; one with a shattered left foot, a broken nose and several broken teeth; one with a fractured foot; and the third physically unharmed. Although this was reported as the first MRAP combat death, later reports stated that three soldiers had been killed by IEDs in RG-31s and two by EFPs in Buffalos before this incident. On 6 May 2008, eight soldiers had been reported killed in the thousands of MRAPs in Iraq, according to the news service Knight Ridder. In June 2008, USA Today reported that roadside bomb attacks and fatalities were down almost 90% partially due to MRAPs. \\"They've taken hits, many, many hits that would have killed soldiers and Marines in unarmored Humvees\\", according to Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Maj. General Rick Lynch, who commanded a division in Baghdad, told USA Today the 14-ton MRAPs have forced insurgents to build bigger, more sophisticated bombs to knock out the vehicles. Those bombs take more time and resources to build and set up, which gives U.S. forces a better chance of catching the insurgents in the act and stopping them. According to Marinetimes.com, the Taliban was also focusing their efforts away from anti- materiel IEDs and more toward smaller anti-personnel bombs that target soldiers on patrol. In 2014, the US acknowledged that Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant was operating an advanced armored personnel carrier captured in Iraq.

Competitors who were rejected included Force Dynamics (reinforced Cougar), GDLS Canada (upgraded BAE OMC RG-31), Navistar subsidiary IMG (upgraded MaxxPro), Textron's upgraded M1117, and Protected Vehicles, Inc's upgraded Golan vehicle, with improved side doors and different armor.EFP Mines? Ceradyne & i3 Say \\"Bull!\\" 19 December 2007, defenseindustrydaily.com Blackwater USA (Grizzly APC with Ares EXO Scale appliqué armor) was later disqualified due to a limited amount of armor in the frontal area of the vehicle. The two qualified designs were an upgraded Caiman, originally designed by Armor Holdings which was later acquired by BAE Systems, and the Bull, a combined effort between Ideal Innovations Inc, Ceradyne and Oshkosh. Both of the designs weighed 40,000 lb or more. According to the Army Times in August 2007, the Pentagon had already decided to buy first-generation 14- to 24-ton MRAP I vehicles with extra Frag Kit 6-derived armor, not the 30-ton MRAP II vehicles, when placing its final MRAP orders at the end of summer, after a field commander's report. The paper also reported that, in addition, the Pentagon may buy some shorter, lighter MRAPs in their final batch. A senior Pentagon official told them that \\"the roads are caving in\\" under the weight of MRAPs and \\"We want it to weigh less than it weighs now\\". =Survivable Combat Tactical Vehicle= In 2010 Textron presented the Survivable Combat Tactical Vehicle (SCTV), a protective capsule that can increase Humvee survivability to MRAP levels while significantly improving mobility; the modifications come in five kits, but all five need to be installed before the vehicle can be properly called an SCTV. The vehicle features a monocoque V-shaped hull and angled sides to help deflect rocket- propelled grenades (RPGs) with scalable levels of protection. It has greater engine power, replacing the 6.5 liter diesel engine with a Cummins 6.7 liter diesel and Allison 6-speed transmission, as well as a stronger suspension, improved brakes, higher ground clearance, and many other modifications. The U.S. military have however preferred the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle. =Joint Light Tactical Vehicle= Vehicles built as part of the MRAP program are often criticized for their bulk, which limits their ability to maneuver. The Joint Light Tactical Vehicle is designed to provide the same protection as an MRAP vehicle with lower weight and greater maneuverability. In 2015, Oshkosh was awarded a contract to produce up to 49,100 vehicles for the US Army and Marine Corps based on its successful MRAP All terrain vehicle design. Post-war applications With the end of the Iraq War and the drawdown of the War in Afghanistan, there was some question as to what to do with MRAPs, as they were designed specifically for asymmetric warfare. The Army decided they would keep them in some sort of service post-war. Of the approximately 20,000 MRAPs in service, 30 percent (6,000) will stay in brigade combat teams as troop transports and route clearance vehicles, 10 percent (2,000) will be used for training, and 60 percent (12,000) will go into storage. MRAPs are to be superseded by the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle when it enters service in 2016. It still may be used until 2022, when the JLTV is in use in sufficient numbers.Army Refining Long Term MRAP Plan - Military.com, May 25, 2012 On 1 October 2012, the Pentagon officially closed the MRAP production line. As of that date, 27,740 MRAP vehicles of all types had rolled off the assembly lines of seven manufacturers, and 12,726 vehicles were still in the Afghanistan theater of operations, about 870 were sold to foreign militaries, with 700 on foreign order.Pentagon shuts MRAP production line - DoDBuzz.com, October 1, 2012 In early July 2012, five MRAP vehicles were delivered to the 2nd Infantry Division in the Korean Peninsula. The 2ID tested over 50 vehicles to see how they would be used by American troops in the region and if their capabilities were right for Korea to protect against mines buried along the Korean Demilitarized Zone. In addition to force protection, the MRAPs provided a platform for \\"mission command-on-the-move\\" to give commanders communications and command-and-control capabilities while moving across the battlefield. Most, if not all, of the MRAPs delivered in Korea were deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan and were refurbished in the U.S. Previous combat experiences would determine how to best use the vehicles in South Korea. Integration into 2ID formations was to take less than a year, with positioning on the front line the following year.MRAPs represent new tool on contentious Korean peninsula - Stripes.com, 12 July 2013 U.S. military officials said the MRAPs were brought in to determine whether they would enhance their ability \\"to preserve peace and deter aggression on the Korean peninsula.\\" North Korean military officials claimed they would be used to safely cross the DMZ to mount an all-out attack on the North, and said the forward deployment of such military hardware disturbed peace and stability in the region. However, by August 2013, the 2ID had decided not to utilize the over 80 MRAPs on the peninsula. They determined the vehicles were \\"not suitable for maneuver battalions to use\\" and that there are no plans to add MRAPs to their fleet in the foreseeable future. The vehicles were returned to the Army fleet management system for use in more suitable regions.MRAP No Good for Korea, 2ID Decides - Military.com, 16 August 2013 The U.S. government is looking to sell about 2,000 out of the 11,000 MRAPs it has in Afghanistan. The logistical and financial task of bringing all the vehicles back to the U.S., or destroying some in-country, is too great and foreign buyers are sought to take them. Several countries have reportedly shown interest, but none have signed agreements. The cost of buying them would include shipping them out of Afghanistan themselves.US Looking to Sell Portion of Afghan MRAP Fleet - Defensenews.com, 4 December 2013 If the MRAPs cannot be sold to allies, U.S. forces will have to resort to destroying the vehicles before they leave the country. The quantities of MRAPs have been ruled as \\"in excess\\" of the needs of the U.S. military and would cost $50,000 per vehicle to ship them out of the country, and they won't be given to the Afghan National Security Forces because they can't maintain them or operate their electronic systems. The cost of destroying them would be $10,000 per vehicle.U.S. Must Demolish Thousands of Its Vehicles in Afghanistan - DoDBuzz.com, 14 March 2014 In September 2014, the U.S. approved a $2.5 billion deal with the United Arab Emirates Army for over 4,500 surplus U.S. MRAPs for increased force protection, conducting humanitarian assistance operations, and protecting vital international commercial trade routes and critical infrastructure. 1,150 vehicles were Caimans.United States approved major contract of MRAP vehicles for UAE - Armyrecognition.com, 27 September 2014 The Defense Department is expected to send 250 MRAPs to Iraq to bolster the Iraqi National Security Forces against Islamic State militants. Iraqi forces were equipped with MRAPs after the U.S. withdrawal in 2011, but many were captured by ISIL during the June 2014 Northern Iraq offensive, and subsequently destroyed later by American air strikes. The vehicles will likely be transferred, rather than sold, as excess defense articles and be drawn from the U.S. stock of 1,500 MRAPs stored in Kuwait.Pentagon to Send 250 MRAPs Back To Iraq to Fight ISIS - Defensetech.org, 12 December 2014 Of the 250 vehicles, 225 will go to Iraqi Security Forces, while 25 will be given to Kurdish Peshmerga forces.Iraq; Kurdish forces incept surplus US MRAPS - Dmilt.com, 7 January 2015 = Post-war reductions = As of September 2013, the U.S. Marine Corps had 3,700–3,800 MRAP vehicles and planned to reduce their inventory to 1,200–1,300 due to sequestration budget cuts, but then increased that number to 2,500 vehicles in May 2014. In 2013, the U.S. government planned to keep about 5,600 of 8700 M-ATVs, with some 250 vehicles for U.S. Special Operations Command. From 2007 to 2011, the Army bought about 9,000 Navistar MaxxPro vehicles and planned to keep only about 3,000.Industry Working To Give the MRAP New Life - Defensenews.com, 21 October 2013Navistar Pitches New Uses for Old MRAPs - DoDBuzz.com, 23 October 2013 Following the drawdown from Afghanistan by the end of 2014, the U.S. Army will reduce its total MRAP fleet to 8,000 vehicles. The Army plans to divest 7,456 vehicles and retain 8,585. Of the total number of vehicles the Army is to keep, 5,036 are to be put in storage, 1,073 used for training and the remainder spread across the active force. The M-ATV will be kept the most at 5,681 vehicles, as it is smaller and lighter than other MRAPs for off-road mobility. The other most retained vehicle will be the MaxxPro Dash with 2,633 vehicles and 301 Maxxpro ambulances; other MRAPs such as the Cougar, Caiman, and larger MaxxPros will be disposed.\\"Majority of MRAPs to be scrapped or stored\\". Military Times, 5 January 2014 They estimated in 2014 \\"it will need to spend $1.7 billion in supplemental wartime dollars over the next several years to modernize and retain 8,585 mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicles, while divesting itself of another 7,456 MRAPs it no longer needs.\\" On 12 May 2016 the first shipment of MRAP vehicles from the United States arrived in the port of Alexandria for delivery to the Egyptian military. The delivery is the first batch of a total of 762 MRAP vehicles that the U.S. is transferring to Egypt. This new capability will be used to combat terrorism and promote stability in the region.https://eg.usembassy.gov/u-s-delivers-armored-mrap-vehicles-egyptian- military/ The equipment is being provided under the US Department of Defense's Excess Defense Articles grant program. = U.S. law enforcement usage = FBI Mine Resistant Ambush vehicle The United States Department of Homeland Security Rapid Response Teams used MRAPs to assist people affected by hurricanes in 2012, and to pull destroyed government vehicles onto the street so they could be towed. The Federal Bureau of Investigation used an MRAP-type vehicle in a child kidnapping case in Midland, Alabama, in 2013. The Department of Defense's Defense Logistics Agency is charged with off-loading 13,000 MRAPs to 780 domestic law enforcement agencies on waiting lists for vehicles. The DLA does not transfer property to the agencies, so the vehicles are allocated to the agencies with costs picked up by them or the state, while the vehicles remain the property of the Defense Department. To receive an armored vehicle, a requesting agency has to meet certain criteria, including justification for use (such as for shooting incidents, SWAT operations and drug interdiction), geographical area and multi-jurisdiction use, the ability to pay for repairs and maintenance, and security and restricted access to the vehicle. Police departments and other agencies in the U.S. can acquire MRAP vehicles through the DLA's 1033 program, which redistributes no longer needed military equipment to state and municipal agencies. Some police departments have picked up surplus MRAPs with no transfer costs or fees. Domestic agencies plan to use them in disaster relief roles, as they can go through flooded areas unlike normal police armored vehicles, and provide security in response to terrorist threats. Some MRAPs used by police forces have the machine gun turret removed and are repainted black. In 2014, it was reported that the Los Angeles Unified School District and the San Diego Unified School District acquired MRAPs for the school police. Organizations have become critical about police use of military vehicles and worried about police militarization. Proponents of the domestic acquisitions argue they fill the same role as the standard police Lenco BearCat armored vehicles. Proponents, such as Sgt. Dan Downing of the Morgan County Sheriff's Department, said the unique mine resistant capability is important as veterans leaving the military may have learned about making IEDs. The American Civil Liberties Union has concerns about militarization of American police and that the military hardware could escalate violent situations. Many vehicles have been obtained by rural police with few officers or crime. These police reject the notion of militarization and maintain that an MRAP would be an addition to their inventory to be prepared for any situation, with the main purpose of protecting occupants. About 150 other surplus vehicles, including Humvees, were obtained by police departments in New York for situations where MRAPs could also be used. More MRAPs have been requested for domestic use. Though the vehicles are obtained for free, the drawbacks are weight (as much as 18 tons), low fuel efficiency and expensive refitting with a closed turret, new seating, loudspeakers, and emergency lights can cost around $70,000. =NASA usage= NASA has acquired several MRAPs for use in an emergency evacuation of an Orion spacecraft on the launch pad.

A music journalist noted of Kelly, \\"Like Primer, he combines an enquiring eye for a song with a moderately conservative taste in sound, producing music that lives by the principles of classic Chicago bar blues yet is not enslaved by the past\\". Early life Kelly was born in the Near West Side community area of Chicago, Illinois, United States. His father was a gospel musician, and his uncle, LeRoy McCauley, was a part-time blues musician. Kelly's own interest in and talent for performing music were on display at an early age; he was playing guitar by the age of seven, despite never having had a formal lesson. Then, at the age of 10, Kelly performed blues for the first time at a Chicago school. As a teenager, he sat in at various clubs on Chicago's South Side and later appeared both as a solo artist and as a sideman in those clubs, backing such artists as the West-Side singer Mary Lane when he was 15. It was during this time that Kelly developed his unique \\"ringing\\" guitar sound, which raised his profile among members of Chicago's blues community. Early career Kelly experimented with disco music during the late 1970s, but he had rekindled his interest in blues music by the end of the decade. Major influences on Kelly's playing style during this stage of his musical development included B.B. King, Muddy Waters, and Johnny Christian. In 1987, Kelly was invited to become a member of saxophonist A.C. Reed's Sparkplugs. Kelly's tenure with this group influenced his vocal style, while allowing him to refine his guitar skills, and provided him with road experience. After playing with Reed's band for three years, however, Kelly decided to strike out on his own. One reason for this decision was his eagerness to cultivate his own style, which has come to be characterized as a mixture of electric blues, R&B;, funk, and disco. Kelly's urge to leave Reed's band also stemmed from his desire to adapt his blues playing to the perceived tastes of a particular audience. With regard to the latter point, Kelly has said, \\"If the older folks come in, I want to take them back to the Delta blues. When the middle-aged folks come in, they just want to hear regular-type blues. If a younger crowd comes in, they want to hear up-to-date type blues.\\" Rise to prominence Kelly formed the Backstreet Blues Band soon after he ended his tenure with Reed, and signed a recording contract with the Vienna, Austria-based Wolf Records International in 1992. Members of Kelly's band included John Primer on guitar; David Honeyboy on harmonica; Eddie Shaw on the saxophone; Erskine Johnson on the keyboard; and Johnny Reed playing bass. In 1994, Kelly and his band had a breakthrough when his debut album, Call Me, earned critical acclaim and introduced Kelly to audiences beyond the Chicago area. The album went on to win the Best Album of 1994 (New Recording) as well as the Living Blues Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album in 1995. The following year, Kelly released Joyriding in the Subway, which featured assistance on lyrics and vocals by Vivian Kelly, Vance Kelly's daughter. As with Kelly's debut outing, Joyriding in the Subway also included the guitarwork of John Primer, bass playing of Johnny Reed, and keyboard music of Erskine Johnson. Critics largely praised the album and noted its \\"stylistic breadth,\\" citing influences on the songs such as A.C. Reed, Tyrone Davis, and Little Milton. Recent activities Kelly has worked steadily since these two hit releases of the 1990s, producing a string of well-received albums that showcased his signature mix of blues, soul, and funk styles. He continues to record with the Backstreet Blues Band, most recently releasing the album Bluebird on October 2008. He has also played at numerous blues gatherings, including the annual Chicago Blues Festival. Between 1999 and 2002, Kelly took part in three separate European concert tours. While Kelly remains relatively unknown outside of the Chicago blues community, his fan base is loyal and has expanded considerably over the years. His daughter, Vivian Kelly, is a blues musician in her own right who released her debut album, Hit Me Up, on October 10, 2006. A musical documentary, Someplace Else, made by film makers Kai-Duc Luong and Avisheh Mohsenin, portraying Kelly and featuring many of his trademark songs, was released in 2008 and played at international film festivals such as the Hawaii International Film Festival, Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival and Rhode Island International Film Festival.

He spent most of his career on the faculty of Yale University. Career The son of the noted physicist William R. Bennett Sr., Bennett Jr. received his bachelor's degree in physics from Princeton University. Bennett's graduate work in physics was on spectroscopy and collisions of the second kind in the noble gases. He received his Ph.D. from Columbia University. Bennett became a tenured professor at Yale University in 1962 and retired in 2000. He and Ali Javan co- invented the first gas laser (the helium-neon laser) at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey. He discovered the argon ion laser, was first to observe spectral hole burning effects in gas lasers, and created a theory of hole burning effects on laser oscillation. He was co-discoverer of lasers using electron impact excitation in each of the noble gases, dissociative excitation transfer in the neon-oxygen laser (the first chemical laser), and collision excitation in several metal vapor lasers. He was one of the first to incorporate the use of computers to teach physics and, with his daughter Dr. Jean Bennett, devised a method of real-time spectral phonocardiography for the detection and classification of heart murmurs. He set a stringent limit on the existence of “The Fifth Force” and showed that it was improbable that magnetic fields from power lines could cause cancer. He wrote eight books, held twelve patents and published over 120 research papers. He received the 1965 IEEE Morris N. Liebmann Memorial Award. His research on the physics of musical instruments became the basis of a popular course he gave at Yale. His principal avocation was playing chamber music. He studied the clarinet with Simeon Bellison and performed as a clarinet soloist with several amateur symphony orchestras.

Biography The WAMPAS Baby Stars of 1925 Natalie Joyce is seated, lower right Born as Natalie Marie Johnson on November 6, 1902, one of eight children to Henry and Elizabeth Johnson in Norfolk, Virginia, U.S. In 1920, at the ago of 18, Johnson's first job performing was alongside her oldest sister in the Ziegfeld Follies. She moved to Los Angeles, CA in 1922 and began her motion picture career in a series of two-reel comedies produced by the Christie Film Company. Around this time she began being billed as Natalie Joyce. She was named one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars of 1925. In 1927 she co-starred as a circus entertainer with Tom Mix in The Circus Ace for Fox Pictures. In 1928 she portrayed a Panama beauty in A Girl in Every Port, and she was part of the cast of Through the Breakers. Her first cousin was actress Olive Borden. Joyce gave the Los Angeles Police Department important information in their quest to find two physicians wanted in the death of 22-year-old dancer Delphine Walsh in May 1929. Walsh died in a Glendale, California hospital following an illegal procedure, the term then used for an abortion. After being away from making movies for a time, Joyce returned in Cock o' the Walk (1930), also known as The Soul of the Tango. Produced by James Cruze, the cast included Joseph Schildkraut, Myrna Loy, and Olive Tell. Joyce appeared in the ingenue role. After retiring from acting, Joyce worked as a bookkeeper and opened a hair salon. She married aviator William Morris Pryce in 1933.https://oliveborden1947.blogspot.com/2019/05/natalie-joyce.html The couple had one son named Michael.

It was built by the Standard Motor Company and sold by Standard's subsidiary, The Triumph Motor Company (1945). It was announced at the October 1949 British International Motor Show, but deliveries did not commence until the middle of 1950. One of the nine prototype Triumph Mayflowers, \\"JWK 612\\", was factory tested 5000 miles across Europe in 1950, they used the famous rooftop test track of Impéria Automobiles in Belgium. The Mayflower was manufactured from 1949 until 1953. The Mayflower's \\"upscale small car\\" position did not find a ready market, and sales did not meet Standard's expectations. The company's next small car, the Standard Eight of 1953, was a basic 0.8-litre economy car. Design and engineering The Mayflower used a version of the pre-war Standard Flying Ten's side-valve engine updated with an aluminium cylinder head and single Solex carburettor. The engine developed at 4200 rpm. The 3-speed gearbox, with column shift, came from the Standard Vanguard and had synchromesh on all the forward ratios. There was independent suspension at the front using coil springs and telescopic dampers, but a solid axle with semi-elliptic leaf springs, also based on the Vanguard's design, was at the rear. Lockheed hydraulic brakes were fitted. The Mayflower was the first car with unitary construction to be manufactured either by Standard or by the Triumph company that existed before Standard bought its assets. The body was designed by Leslie Moore, chief body designer of Mulliners of Birmingham with input from Standard's Walter Belgrove. The body shells were built by Fisher and Ludlow at Castle Bromwich, Birmingham. The Mayflower had traditional \\"razor edge\\" styling similar to that of the Triumph Renown, imitating the style then still used by Bentley and Rolls-Royce cars. Standard's managing director Sir John Black believed this would be especially appealing to the American market. One advantage of the car's upright styling was that it could seat four people in comfort despite its small size, although there were complaints about the rear seat being constrained by the rear axle and being too narrow as a result. =Non-saloon versions= Ten drophead coupés were built in 1950. Standard Motor Company (Australia) Limited produced a coupé utility variant of the Mayflower at their Port Melbourne plant in Victoria, Australia. 150 examples were built from Mayflower Saloon CKD kits imported from the United Kingdom, with bodywork locally modified to form a rear load area to which a timber floor and side panels were added. Performance A Mayflower tested at Brooklands racing circuit, by British magazine The Motor in 1950 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0– in 26.6 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £505 including taxes. Reception The Mayflower was announced and displayed for the first time on 28 September 1949, the first day of the Earls Court Motor Show.\\"The Mayflower is an elegant little car with a 1250cc, four cylinder engine, three speed gearbox, and a full width, two-door saloon body with much the same knife-edge lines as the bigger Triumph saloon. The interior finish is in the same good taste as the external lines and the whole car is an attractive combination of the merits of modern design with the high quality looked for in British cars.\\" - Deliveries, including complete knock down (CKD) kits for overseas markets, began in the middle of 1950. Despite its low performance, the Mayflower impressed automobile testers, including Tom McCahill from Mechanix Illustrated and The Scribe from Autocar. Legacy Triumph Mayflower The Mayflower had been an attempt to create a small car with an upmarket image, but it failed to meet its sales targets. Standard announced the Mayflower's replacement in a press release in early February 1952; the announcement further stated that the replacement would probably not be on sale until 1953. The Standard Eight, which replaced the Mayflower, had a basic specification and was aimed at a different type of buyer. From the ending of Mayflower production in 1953 there was no small saloon with the Triumph name available in the United Kingdom until the launch of the Triumph Herald in 1959. The Standard Ten saloon and Standard Companion estate were sold as Triumphs in the United States. The front suspension design from the Mayflower was used on the Triumph 20TS prototype and, with modifications, on the Triumph TR2. =Cultural impact= The Mayflower is the subject of a well-known painting by Australian artist John Brack—The Car. =Die-cast models= Die- cast models of the Mayflower include Mikansue models from the 1980s, Lansdowne models from the 2006, and Oxford Diecast 00 scale models from 2008.

For potentials that decay faster than 1/r^3 as r\\\\to \\\\infty, it is defined as the following low-energy limit: : \\\\lim_{k\\\\to 0} k\\\\cot\\\\delta(k) =- \\\\frac{1}{a}\\\\;, where a is the scattering length, k is the wave number, and \\\\delta(k) is the phase shift of the outgoing spherical wave. The elastic cross section, \\\\sigma_e, at low energies is determined solely by the scattering length: : \\\\lim_{k\\\\to 0} \\\\sigma_e = 4\\\\pi a^2\\\\;.  General concept  When a slow particle scatters off a short ranged scatterer (e.g. an impurity in a solid or a heavy particle) it cannot resolve the structure of the object since its de Broglie wavelength is very long. The idea is that then it should not be important what precise potential V(r) one scatters off, but only how the potential looks at long length scales. The formal way to solve this problem is to do a partial wave expansion (somewhat analogous to the multipole expansion in classical electrodynamics), where one expands in the angular momentum components of the outgoing wave. At very low energy the incoming particle does not see any structure, therefore to lowest order one has only a spherical outgoing wave, called the s-wave in analogy with the atomic orbital at angular momentum quantum number l=0. At higher energies one also needs to consider p and d-wave (l=1,2) scattering and so on. The idea of describing low energy properties in terms of a few parameters and symmetries is very powerful, and is also behind the concept of renormalization. The concept of the scattering length can also be extended to potentials that decay slower than 1/r^3 as r\\\\to \\\\infty. A famous example, relevant for proton-proton scattering, is the Coulomb-modified scattering length. Example As an example on how to compute the s-wave (i.e. angular momentum l=0) scattering length for a given potential we look at the infinitely repulsive spherical potential well of radius r_0 in 3 dimensions. The radial Schrödinger equation (l=0) outside of the well is just the same as for a free particle: :-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} u(r)=E u(r), where the hard core potential requires that the wave function u(r) vanishes at r=r_0, u(r_0)=0. The solution is readily found: :u(r)=A \\\\sin(k r+\\\\delta_s). Here k=\\\\sqrt{2m E}/\\\\hbar and \\\\delta_s=-k \\\\cdot r_0 is the s-wave phase shift (the phase difference between incoming and outgoing wave), which is fixed by the boundary condition u(r_0)=0; A is an arbitrary normalization constant. One can show that in general \\\\delta_s(k)\\\\approx-k \\\\cdot a_s +O(k^2) for small k (i.e. low energy scattering). The parameter a_s of dimension length is defined as the scattering length. For our potential we have therefore a=r_0, in other words the scattering length for a hard sphere is just the radius. (Alternatively one could say that an arbitrary potential with s-wave scattering length a_s has the same low energy scattering properties as a hard sphere of radius a_s.) To relate the scattering length to physical observables that can be measured in a scattering experiment we need to compute the cross section \\\\sigma. In scattering theory one writes the asymptotic wavefunction as (we assume there is a finite ranged scatterer at the origin and there is an incoming plane wave along the z-axis): :\\\\psi(r,\\\\theta)=e^{i k z}+f(\\\\theta) \\\\frac{e^{i k r}}{r} where f is the scattering amplitude. According to the probability interpretation of quantum mechanics the differential cross section is given by d\\\\sigma/d\\\\Omega=f(\\\\theta)^2 (the probability per unit time to scatter into the direction \\\\mathbf{k}). If we consider only s-wave scattering the differential cross section does not depend on the angle \\\\theta, and the total scattering cross section is just \\\\sigma=4 \\\\pi f^2. The s-wave part of the wavefunction \\\\psi(r,\\\\theta) is projected out by using the standard expansion of a plane wave in terms of spherical waves and Legendre polynomials P_l(\\\\cos \\\\theta): :e^{i k z}\\\\approx\\\\frac{1}{2 i k r}\\\\sum_{l=0}^{\\\\infty}(2l+1)P_l(\\\\cos \\\\theta)\\\\left[ (-1)^{l+1}e^{-i k r} + e^{i k r}\\\\right] By matching the l=0 component of \\\\psi(r,\\\\theta) to the s-wave solution \\\\psi(r)=A \\\\sin(k r+\\\\delta_s)/r (where we normalize A such that the incoming wave e^{i k z} has a prefactor of unity) one has: :f=\\\\frac{1}{2 i k}(e^{2 i \\\\delta_s}-1)\\\\approx \\\\delta_s/k \\\\approx - a_s This gives: \\\\sigma= \\\\frac{4 \\\\pi}{k^2} \\\\sin^2 \\\\delta_s =4 \\\\pi a_s^2 See also *Fermi pseudopotential *Neutron scattering length References * Category:Quantum mechanics Category:Scattering theory ","title":"Scattering length"},{"id":"9526574","text":"Tintic High School is a small rural public high school in Eureka, Utah, United States.

It is primarily used in assisted reproduction to control ovulation. The drug works by blocking the action of GnRH upon the pituitary, thus rapidly suppressing the production and action of LH and FSH. Ganirelix is used in fertility treatment to prevent premature ovulation that could result in the harvesting of eggs that are too immature to be used in procedures such as in vitro fertilization. GnRH agonists are also sometimes used in reproductive therapy, as well as to treat disorders involving sex-steroid hormones, such as endometriosis. One advantage of using GnRH antagonists is that repeated administration of GnRH agonists results in decreased levels of gonadotropins and sex steroids due to desensitization of the pituitary. This is avoided when using GnRH antagonists such as ganirelix. The success of ganirelix in reproductive therapy has been shown to be comparable to that when using GnRH agonists. Medical uses Ganirelix is used as a fertility treatment drug for people with ovaries. Specifically, it is used to prevent premature ovulation in people with ovaries undergoing fertility treatment involving ovarian hyperstimulation that causes the ovaries to produce multiple eggs. When such premature ovulation occurs, the eggs released by the ovaries may be too immature to be used in in-vitro fertilization. Ganirelix prevents ovulation until it is triggered by injecting human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). Ganirelix is administered by a subcutaneous injection of 250 µg once per day during the mid to late follicular phase of a patient's menstrual cycle. Treatment should start on the 5th or 6th day after the start of ovarian stimulation, and the mean duration for its use is five days. Preferably, the subcutaneous injections are delivered in the upper leg, and the patient can be trained to do this themself. Continued use of the drug should take place until the administration of hCG begins. hCG administration is begun when a sufficient number of follicles have developed due to the effects of endogenous and or exogenously administered follicle stimulating hormone. Contraindications Ganirelix should not be used in women who are already pregnant, and because of this the onset of pregnancy must be ruled out before it is administered. Women using ganirelix should not breast feed, as it is not known whether ganirelix is excreted in breast milk. Side effects Clinical studies have shown that the most common side effect is a slight reaction at the site of injection in the form of redness, and sometimes swelling. Clinical studies have shown that, one hour after injection, the incidence of at least one moderate or severe local skin reaction per treatment cycle was 12% in 4 patients treated with ganirelix and 25% in patients treated subcutaneously with a GnRH agonist. The local reactions generally disappear within 4 hours after administration. Other reported side effects are some that are known to be associated with ovarian hyperstimulation, including gynecological abdominal pain, headache, vaginal bleeding, nausea, and gastrointestinal abdominal pain. In some rare cases, less than 1 user in 10,000, hypersensitivity to ganirelix can cause anaphylactoid reactions, most likely due to allergy. =Birth defects= A follow-up analysis for ganirelix done by the Marketing Authorisation Holder compared the number of congenital malformations between individuals whose mothers were treated with ganirelix compared with individuals whose mothers were treated with a GnRH agonist. The total number of congenital malformations was higher in the ganirelix group than in the GnRH agonist group (7.6% vs. 5.5%). This falls within the range for the normal incidence of congenital malformations, and current data do not suggest that ganirelix increases the incidence of congenital malformations or anomalies. No important differences in the frequency of ectopic pregnancies and miscarriage were noted with the use of ganirelix.  Interactions  Currently, no studies have been done to assess the possible drug-drug interactions between ganirelix and other drugs. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Ganierlix is a synthetic peptide that works as an antagonist against gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) (\\"Ganirelix acetate injection,\\" 2009). Ganirelix competitively blocks GnRH receptors on the pituitary gonadotroph, quickly resulting in the suppression of gonadotropin secretion. This suppression is easily reversed by discontinuation of ganirelix administration. Ganirelix has a significantly higher receptor binding affinity (Kd = 0.4 nM) than GnRH (Kd = 3.6 nM). =Pharmacokinetics= When ganirelix is given to healthy adult females, steady-state serum concentrations are reached, on average, after three days (\\"Ganirelix acetate injection,\\" 2009). A study administering ganirelix to healthy adult females (n=15) found the mean (SD) elimination half-life (t1/2) to be 16.2(1.6) hours, volume of distribution/absolute bioavailability (Vd/F) 76.5(10.3) liters, maximum serum concentration (Cmax) 11.2(2.4) ng/mL, and the time until maximum concentration (tmax) 1.1(0.2) hours. One 250 µg injection of ganirelix resulted in a mean absolute bioavailability of 91.1%. Chemistry Ganirelix is derived from GnRH, with amino acid substitutions made at positions 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 10. History The European Commission gave marketing authorization for ganirelix throughout the European Union to N.V. Organon in May 2000.

It was created by magician and inventor Robert Harbin. Description One of the two performers, the restrainee, is placed in a standing position in a large frame and restrained there with various straps, manacles, chains and locks. The second performer, the restrainer, circles the frame, drawing a curtain first across the front, and then around one side and the back. Almost as soon as the restrainer disappears behind the frame, the restrainee appears from the other side of the apparatus, drawing back the curtain as they come. This reveals the restrainer now restrained in the frame; the two seem to have changed places by magic. In practice, the roles of restrainer and restrainee have been interchangeable between magician and assistant. Sometimes it begins with the assistant restraining the magician, with the implication that in this way the assistant is gaining \\"revenge\\" for all the other tricks they do where the assistant is put in a box. However it is also performed with the assistant being restrained at the beginning and emerging at the end to with the magician restrained as \\"revenge\\" for the opening part.

Dell has been called \\"one of the most flamboyant, versatile and influential American Men of Letters of the first third of the 20th Century.\\"Krupnick, Mark (1996). Floyd Dell, Sensible Rebel [Review of the book Essays From the Friday Literary Review, 1909-1913, by Floyd Dell (Edited by R. Craig Sautter)]. Chicago Tribune, February 25, 1996. In Chicago, he was editor of the nationally syndicated Friday Literary Review. As editor and critic, Dell's influence is seen in the work of many major American writers from the first half of the 20th century. A lifelong poet, he was also a best-selling author, as well as a playwright whose hit Broadway comedy, Little Accident (1928),Greasley, Philip A., Dictionary of Midwestern Literature, Indiana U. Press, 2001 was made into a Hollywood movie. Dell wrote extensively on controversial social issues of the early 20th century, and played a major part in the political and social movements originating in New York City's Greenwich Village during the 1910s & 1920s. As editor of left-wing magazine The Masses, Dell was twice put on trial for publishing subversive literature. Biography =Early life and career= Dell was born in Barry, Illinois, on June 28, 1887 to Anthony Dell, a Civil War veteran and unsuccessful butcher, and Kate Crone, a home maker. Dell spent his childhood in poverty, with his family moving often. He lived in Quincy, Illinois, for a large portion of his childhood. Encouraged by his mother, a former school teacher, Dell became a voracious reader, spending much of his time at Quincy's local library. In 1903 Dell moved with his family to Davenport, Iowa, which was then a liberal and cosmopolitan port city and center of trade with a thriving literary and intellectual scene. Initially attending Davenport High School, Dell did not return to school after the summer of 1904, instead becoming a reporter at a local paper. Dell also became an active socialist and associated with other local writers to form what would be called the 'Davenport group'. While in Davenport, Dell also began publishing poetry, first in local papers, then in national periodicals. By the time Dell left Davenport for Chicago in 1908, he had escaped blue-collar life to emerge as a promising young professional writer and intellectual. It was also in Davenport that Dell met Marilla Waite Freeman, the director of the library. Dell is quoted as saying that he \\"caught a glimpse of mountaintops\\" through Freeman's inspiration, and he dedicated a number of poems and novels to her. Freeman also served as the model for the librarian character, Helen Raymond, in Moon-Calf. Playbook for The Angel Intrudes (1917). In Chicago Dell became editor and book reviewer for of the Chicago Evening Post's nationally distributed Friday Literary Review, the \\"leading organ of literary modernism in America at the time.\\"Stansell, Christine, American Moderns: Bohemian New York and the Creation of a New Century, Princeton University Press; 1 edition (December 6, 2009) Dell used his position as editor to introduce many Americans to modernist literature and promote the work of many Chicago writers, including Theodore Dreiser, Sherwood Anderson, and Carl Sandburg. Dell's further influence as a critic can be seen in the work of many major American writers from the first half of the 20th century. =Greenwich Village= Relocating to New York City in 1913, Dell became a leader of the pre-war bohemian community in Greenwich Village and managing editor of Max Eastman's radical magazine The Masses. Following the passing of the Espionage Act of 1917, the government officially labeled the magazine \\"treasonable material\\" in August of that year and issued charges against its staff for \\"unlawfully and willfully… obstruct[ing] the recruiting and enlistment of the United States\\" military. The \\"conspirators\\" faced fines up to 10,000 dollars and twenty years imprisonment. After deliberating for three days, the jury was unable to come to a unanimous decision. The jurors seeking to convict the defendants blamed one juror for being unable to conform to the majority opinion, as he was also a socialist. Not only did the other eleven jurors demand the prosecutor to levy charges against the lone juror, but they attempted to drag the socialist supporter out into the street and lynch him. The Judge, given the uproar, declared a mistrial. A second trial also resulted in a deadlocked jury. Dell joined fellow Davenporters Susan Glaspell and George Cram Cook as a member of the Provincetown Players and his play King Arthur's Socks was the first performed by that historic theater group. =Later life & career= Following the war, Dell turned to fiction and his first novel, the bildungsroman (or coming-of-age) Moon-Calf, became a best seller. It was an early book for the publisher Alfred A. Knopf and published at a time when many mid-western writers were writing about small-town life; Sinclair Lewis's book Main Street was published within days of Moon-Calf. By 1920 Moon-Calf had sold 38,500 copies and went through eleven printings. This was followed by several other novels with limited success. His autobiographical memoir, Homecoming, is a striking eyewitness view of the social and artistic-bohemian history of the midwest. Dell continued to publish both fiction and non-fiction until the end of his life. Dell joined the WPA and U.S. Information Service in 1935 from which he retired following World War II. He married Beatrice Marie, and had two sons. One son, Christopher Dell, became a writer as well. He married and had two daughters: Jerri Dell who is the current literary executor and archivist of the Dell Collection, and Kathryn Dell Kaufman; then he divorced and remarried Kate Kane. With Kate he had a daughter, Mia Dell, who is married and has three children. Floyd Dell died in Bethesda, Maryland, near Washington, D.C., on July 23, 1969. In 2015, he was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame.
