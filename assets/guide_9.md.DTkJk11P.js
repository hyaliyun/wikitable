Family Regulski came from an impoverished family. His parents' names and occupations are not known. His talent was recognized as a boy by two wealthy landowners of the area, Stanisław Kostka Potocki and Ignacy Potocki, when he did carvings using an awl and knife with olive pits. The Potocki families paid for his education in national schools and then further training in Rome and Naples, which lasted until 1780. He Married to Marianne Chmielewska, they had three children, of whom distinguished himself eldest son of Stanislaw, translator and poet. Career In 1783, most likely by their patrons brothers Potocki, Regulski was appointed to the royal court as an officer medal collection and other collections of King Stanisław August Poniatowski. In order to create an Academy of Fine Arts, the king was planning to entrust the management of collections of antiques. But when the creation of a new university did not happen, he instead appointed Regulski as the official Polish Mint artist. Regulski was most successful in carving gems: the image of the king as gifts, the royal family, and different depictions of the mythical, historical and contemporary. As a sculptor he represented classicism. He executed a commemorative medal engraving, and made such a medal with a portrait of the king on the obverse to commemorate the start of construction of the church of St. Providence and medal-military gift for Prince Józef. Politics On April 19, 1794, Regulski joined the Kościuszko Uprising. Some sources imply that it belonged to the Polish Jacobins. Soon he was brought before the court on charges of inciting the people of the capital and enforcing the Targowica Confederation, but after a hearing in the Supreme Court he was acquitted. After the Third Partition of Poland and the start of Prussian rule in Warsaw, Regulski was favored by Frederick William II of Prussia. In 1795 he moved to Berlin, and was appointed curator of the Royal Collection. The king sent him to Italy in order to make purchases antiques to enrich the Berlin collection. When Regulski returned to the Prussian capital, the king was already Friedrich Wilhelm III. The new monarch was devoid of any interest in art, so he refused to pay for the purchases made. Regulski went with them in 1798 to Warsaw, where he devoted himself to art and enlarging his collection. Death On July 28, 1807 Regulski died in Warsaw. After his death his collections were dispersed. Unfortunately, he did not always sign the gem and small sculptures, so it is difficult to figure out which of the surviving engraved gems in Polish museums and cameos are his work.

It is a National Register of Historic Places listing.National Register of Historic Places in El Paso County, Colorado. American Dreams. Retrieved July 1, 2013. History The chapel was built in 1929 as a memorial to Alice Bemis Taylor's husband, Frederick Morgan Pike Taylor. Designed by John Gaw Meem on the property of Taylor's summer home, La Foret, it was her private place of worship until 1942 when she died. It was donated to the United Church of Christ's Rocky Mountain Conference in 1944. The chapel's interior and exterior were restored using a State Historic Fund grant of $120,000. Description It is historically significant because it is a John Gaw Meem \\"Santa Fe Style\\" church building, built north of the San Luis Valley. The pueblo chapel is surrounded by a walled courtyard near a ravine in the Ponderosa pine forest. It appears much as it had when originally built with stuccoed walls, log vigas, a bell from \\"an old mission church in New Mexico\\". The two-storied building is entered through double carved wooden doors. It has an altar and north and south transepts, each with side porches. Inside the church are a number of wood carvings features. Eugenie Shonnard carved 20-foot reredos of seven saints. Archways to the transepts \\"rough hewn wood carvings\\". The altar, pulpit, lectern, and other furnishings are made of carved wood, also by Shonnard. Above the log vigas is a herringbone pattern made of Aspen saplings. Flagstone is used for flooring. A spiral staircase is used to access the second story where there is additional seating. Bainbridge Bunting wrote in his book, ‘’John Gaw Meem: Southwestern Architect:’’ > The Taylor chapel, Meem’s first essay in the traditional church form, was > commissioned in 1928 by Mrs. Alice B. Taylor. As in his early Spanish-Pueblo > houses, the forms here ten to be more picturesque, the batter of the walls > is exaggerated, and the profiles of the parapets self-consciously irregular. > The woodwork is also elaborately carved, much more so than any that survives > in a mission church. This is especially true of two interior doors leading > to the “transepts.” These and the reredos were carved by Meem’s friend > Eugenie Shonnard... It reflects Taylor's values of piety and simplicity, \\"passion for Southwestern art\\", and with an \\"unparalleled view\\" of Pikes Peak. La Foret The chapel is one of two historic properties located in the La Foret Conference and Retreat Center. The Ponderosa Lodge is also on the National Register of Historic Places. The center is located on 400 acres of meadows and Ponderosa pines. The center had originally been a 500-acre summer estate of Alice Bemis Taylor, a philanthropist and an important Colorado Springs family. Mrs. Taylor held artist-in-residence programs on the estate she called La Foret. The Taylor Memorial Chapel was built one year after the lodge as a memorial to her husband, Frederick Morgan Pike Taylor. Alice Taylor died in 1942 and the property was deeded to the Colorado Congregational Church by the Bemis Taylor Foundation. The center is now open to United Church of Christ members, other denominations and organizations. La Foret now has a number of cabins, a dining hall, sports fields and courts, and outdoor theater seating. Black Forest fire Taylor Memorial Chapel and other buildings at La Foret Conference and Retreat Center were spared from the Black Forest fire (June, 2013), at least partly due to mitigation efforts. The retreat center created the \\"Black Forest Strong\\" organization to serve as a resource to the recuperating Black Forest community. The seven point plan includes grief counseling, serving as a community resource center, providing aid to victims and organizing events. In addition, the plan includes preservation, reseeding efforts, and mitigation training and services.

Four of the territories were in the north and under British control – Sarawak, Brunei, Labuan, an island, and British North Borneo; while the remainder, and bulk, of the island, was under the jurisdiction of the Dutch East Indies. On 16December 1941, Japanese forces landed at Miri, Sarawak having sailed from Cam Ranh Bay in French Indochina. On 1 January 1942, the Japanese navy landed unopposed in Labuan. The next day, 2 January 1942, the Japanese landed at Mempakul on North Borneo territory. After negotiations as to the surrender of Jesselton with the Officers-in- charge of Jesselton and waiting for troop reinforcements, Jesselton was occupied by the Japanese on 8 January. However, it took the Japanese until the end of the month to conquer the entire territory of British Borneo. The Japanese subsequently renamed the northern part as , Labuan as and the neighbouring Dutch territories as . For the first time in modern history all of Borneo was under a single rule. British Borneo was occupied by the Japanese for over three years. They actively promoted the Japanisation of the local population by requiring them to learn the Japanese language and customs. The Japanese divided the North Borneo into five provincial administrations (shus) and constructed airfields. Several prisoner of war camps were operated by the Japanese. Allied soldiers and most colonial officials were detained in them, together with members of underground movements who opposed the Japanese occupation. Meanwhile, local Malay leaders were maintained in position with Japanese surveillance and many foreign workers were brought to the territory. Towards the end of 1945, Australian commandos were deployed to the island by US submarines with the Allied Z Special Unit conducting intelligence operations and training thousands of indigenous people to fight the Japanese in guerrilla warfare in the Borneo Campaign in preparation for the arrival of the main Allied liberation missions. Following landings in North Borneo and Labuan from 10June 1945 by a combination of Australian and American forces, the island of Borneo was liberated. The British Military Administration formally took over from the Japanese on 12September 1945.  Background  A Japanese poster released following the beginning of the Pacific War, with the main slogan translated as \\"Let's win the Greater East Asia War!\\" The Japanese intention to gain control of Borneo was associated with the concept of a unified Greater East Asia. This was developed by General Hachirō Arita, an army ideologist who served as Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1936 to 1940. Japanese leaders envisioned an Asia guided by Tokyo with no western interference and likened the Japanese Empire to an Asian equivalent of the Monroe Doctrine. The island was seen by Japan as strategically important, being located on the main sea routes between Java, Sumatra, Malaya and the Celebes. Control of these routes was vital to securing the territory. Japanese military movement in the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDA) area from 1941 to 1942 With the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, Japanese immigrants had been welcomed since the 1900s. Companies such as Mitsubishi and Nissan were involved in trade with the territory. Japanese immigrants had also been in the Raj of Sarawak since 1915, with some of them working as hawkers and some Japanese women working in the red-light district. This presented opportunities for espionage, which were taken up by the Japanese military, especially from 1930. Secret telegrams revealed that the Japanese ships docking regularly at Jesselton were engaged in espionage. In 1940 the Americans and British had placed an embargo on exports of raw materials to Japan because of its continuing aggression in China and the Japanese invasion of French Indochina. Chronically short of natural resources, Japan needed an assured supply, particularly of oil, in order to achieve its long-term goal of becoming the major power in the Pacific region. Southeast Asia, which mostly consisted of European colonies, subsequently became a prime target for Japan. It hoped to obtain resources as well to ending the Western colonialism period.  Invasion  2nd Yokosuka Naval Landing Force under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Genzo Watanabe (standing, top left) on a transport ship heading to Borneo prior to their invasion in December 1941 The Japanese invasion plan called for the British territories to be taken and held by the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) and the Dutch territories to the south by the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). The IJA allocated the 35th Infantry Brigade to northern Borneo. The Brigade was led by Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi and consisted of units previously stationed at Canton in southern China. On 13December 1941, the Japanese invasion convoy left Cam Ranh Bay in French Indochina, with an escort of the cruiser , the destroyers of the 12th Destroyer Division, , , and , submarine-chaser 'CH-7', and the aircraft depot ship Kamikawa Maru. Ten transport ships carried the advance party of the invasion force. The Support Force—commanded by Rear Admiral Takeo Kurita—consisted of the cruisers and and the destroyers and . The Japanese forces intended to capture Miri and Seria, then move on Kuching and the nearby airfields. The convoy proceeded without being detected and, at dawn on 16December, two landing units secured Miri and Seria with little resistance from British forces. Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi, commander of the invasion force Kuala Belait and Lutong were captured on the same day with around 10,000 Japanese soldiers ashore. On 22December, Brunei Town was captured and the main Japanese force moved westwards towards Kuching after securing the oilfields in northern Sarawak. The Japanese air force bombed Singkawang airfield to deter any Dutch attack. After escorts drove off a lone Dutch submarine, the Japanese task force entered the mouth of the Santubong River on 23December. The convoy, including twenty transports carrying Japanese troops commanded by Colonel Akinosuke Oka, arrived off Cape Sipang and had completed disembarkation by the next morning. The 2nd Battalion of the 15th Punjab Regiment, which was stationed in Kuching, was the sole Allied infantry unit on the island. Although they resisted the Japanese attack on the airfield, they were soon outnumbered and retreated up the Santubong River. On 25December, Japanese troops successfully captured Kuching airfield. The Punjab Regiment retreated through the jungle to the Singkawang area. After the Japanese secured Singkawang on 29December, the rest of the British and Dutch troops retreated further into the jungle, moving south to Sampit and Pangkalanbun, where a Dutch airfield was located at Kotawaringin. On 31December a force under Lieutenant Colonel Genzo Watanabe moved northward to occupy the remainder of Brunei, Beaufort and Jesselton. Jesselton was defended by the North Borneo Armed Constabulary with 650 men. They provided little resistance and the town was taken on 9January. On 3January 1942 the IJA invaded Labuan Island. On 18January, using small fishing boats, the Japanese landed at Sandakan, the seat of government of British North Borneo. On the morning of 19January Governor Charles Robert Smith surrendered British North Borneo and was interned with his staff. The occupation of British Borneo was thus completed. The Dutch southern and central Borneo were also taken by the IJN, following its attacks from east and west. After ten weeks in the jungle-covered mountains, Allied troops surrendered on 1April. = Propaganda and assimilation = Japanese propaganda mural in Jawi script from a building in the town of Kuching. The text, in the Malay language, reads \\"Ya Allah, terpeliharalah kami oleh tentera Jepun daripada aniayai\\" (O Allah, we are saved from persecution by the Japanese troops). The Tokyo-based Asahi Shimbun newspaper and the Osaka-based Mainichi Shimbun began publication in Malay in both Borneo and the Celebes Island, carrying news on behalf of the Japanese government. Following their occupation, the Japanese began a process of assimilation of the local people. Propaganda was displayed throughout the Bornean territories and slogans such as \\"Asia for Asians\\" and \\"Japan, the light of Asia\\" were widely displayed. Ethnocentrism was central to this plan with Japanese values, world view, culture, spirit, emperor worship and racial superiority being promulgated. As part of the process of Japanisation (Nipponisation), schoolchildren and adults were instructed to go to nihon-go classes to learn the Japanese language. Students had to wear uniforms and a peaked cap with a blue sakura (cherry blossom) emblem, which was replaced by a red one as the students attained higher grades. Each morning students were required to sing the Japanese national anthem with gusto followed by bowing to the Japanese flag before marching to their classrooms. This was done to make the population \\"think, feel and act like Japanese East Asians\\". Their treatment of the local indigenous people and Chinese immigrants differed. Attempting to ensure the indigenous local were not their enemies an administrative directive on 14March 1942 declared that: A different principle applied to the local Chinese as they were considered to be the only community which could offer a serious challenge to Japanese authority: Attempts were also made to inculcate anti-Western feeling with local government officers required to attend Japanese night classes. Unlike his counterparts in North Borneo and Sarawak which were previously ruled by European officials, the Brunei Sultan, Ahmad Tajuddin, was retained by the Japanese with no reduction in salary. Malay government officials were usually retained in their posts.  Administration  = Administrative areas = Under the Japanese occupation British Borneo were divided into five provinces (shūs): * Kyūchin-shū (久鎮州): Sarawak First and Second Divisions, Pontianak and Natuna Islands.Including a portion of Dutch Borneo of Pontianak and its adjacent islands * Miri-shū (美里州): Sarawak Fourth and Fifth Divisions, Brunei Town. * Seigan-shū (西岸州): Western North Borneo of Api, Beaufort, Kota Belud, Kota Marudu, Keningau, Weston and Labuan. * Shibu- shū (志布州): Sarawak Third Division * Tōgan-shū (東岸州): Eastern North Borneo of Elopura, Beluran, Lahad Datu and Tawau. Each of the five shūs had a Japanese provincial governor, or the administration remained in the hands of the local people with Japanese surveillance. Each of the provinces constituted prefectures or . Jesselton and Sandakan were renamed Api and Elopura respectively. = Occupation forces = Marquis Toshinari Maeda, the first commander of the Japanese forces in northern Borneo, pictured in 1941 before his death in 1942 Once Sarawak was secured, control of the rest of British Borneo fell to the Kawaguchi Detachment, while neighbouring Dutch Borneo was administered by the IJN. In mid-March 1942, the navy detachment was redeployed to Cebu. The 4th Independent Mixed Regiment, also known as the Nakahata Unit, under Colonel Nakahata Joichi took over the tasks of mopping up operations, maintaining law and order, and establishing a military government. On 6April 1942, the unit came under Lieutenant General Marquess Toshinari Maeda's Borneo Defence Army who became responsible for the area. His headquarters was initially at Miri, but Maeda considered it unsuitable and moved to Kuching. In July the Nakahata Regiment was reorganised into two 500-man battalions, the 40th and 41st Independent Garrison Infantry Battalions. Maeda was killed along with Major Hataichi Usui and Pilot-Captain Katsutaro Ano in an air crash while flying to Labuan Island on 5September 1942. The Japanese then renamed the island in remembrance to him. Maeda was replaced by Lieutenant General Masataka Yamawaki from 5September 1942 to 22September 1944. General Hideki Tōjō of the Imperial Japanese Army and the Prime Minister of Japan inspecting an airfield in Kuching while Japanese troops give a salute during a visit on 7July 1943 By 1943 the battalions combined strength had reduced to 500 men. The military government moved its headquarters again in April 1944 to Jesselton. Yamawaki was formerly Director of the Resources Mobilisation Bureau; his appointment in 1942 was interpreted by the Allies as part of a drive to establish Borneo as a significant location for storage of supplies and the development of supporting industry. Law enforcement in Borneo fell to the notorious Kenpeitai, the Japanese military police, who were directly responsible to the military commander and the Japanese War Ministry. They had virtually unlimited power and frequently used torture and brutality. The Kenpeitai headquarters were in a two-storey bungalow on Java Street (Jalan Jawa), Kuching. From April 1944 it was relocated to the Sports Club Building in Api. Japanese justice became synonymous with punishment out of all proportion to the offence. They revived the pre-war civil court system from November 1942, with local magistrates applying the Sarawak Penal Code. With the Allied advance in the Pacific, the Japanese realised that Borneo was likely to be retaken. The Borneo Defence Army was strengthened with additional units and renamed 37th Army. Command passed to Lieutenant General Masao Baba from 26December 1944. = Military infrastructure and bases = Imperial Japanese Navy ships departing Brunei Bay for the battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944 Airfields were constructed by prisoners of war and conscripted labour from various locations, including from Brunei, Labuan, Ranau and Elopura. Before the Japanese occupation, there were only three airfields: in Kuching; Miri; and Bintulu in Sarawak, while in North Borneo there were none. Due to this, the Japanese planned to construct a total of twelve airfields in different parts of northern Borneo to strengthen its defence, of which seven were to be located in Api, Elopura, Keningau, Kudat, Tawau, Labuan and Lahad Datu. The Japanese also launched a series of road projects in North Borneo, with the roads linking Ranau with Keningau and Kota Belud with Tenghilan to be improved as well a new road linking Kudat and Kota Belud to be constructed. As these roads passed through mountainous areas, a large number of forced labourers were needed to realise the projects. In preparing for Allied retaliation Lieutenant general Masataka Yamawaki created an indigenous force consisting of around 1,300 men in 1944. Most of them were stationed in Kuching, with others in Miri, Api and Elopura; all were tasked to maintain peace and order, gather intelligence and to recruit. Brunei harbour was also used by the IJN as a refuelling depot and as a staging post for the Battle of Leyte Gulf. = Prisoner of war camps = Batu Lintang camp in Kuching in 1945 The Japanese had major prisoner of war (POW) camps at Kuching, Ranau, and Sandakan, plus smaller ones at Dahan and other locations. Batu Lintang camp held both military and civilian prisoners. The camp was finally liberated on 11September 1945 by elements of the Australian 9th Division under the command of Brigadier Tom Eastick. Sandakan camp was closed by the Japanese prior to the Allied invasion; most of its occupants died as a result of forced marches from Sandakan to Ranau. In total the Japanese are believed to have held an estimated 4,660 prisoners and internees at all camps in northern Borneo, with only 1,393 surviving to end of the war.  Effects of occupation  = Economy = Following the occupation government offices re-opened on 26December 1941. Japanese companies were brought in and granted monopolies in essential goods. In early 1942 the first branch of Yokohama Specie Bank opened in Kuching in the former building of Chartered Bank. The Japanese Southern Development Treasury also opened an office to oversee investment throughout northern Borneo. Two Japanese insurance companies, Tokyo Kaijo Kasai and Mitsubishi Kaijo Kasai, began operations. All motor vehicles were confiscated by Japan Transport Co. for limited compensation. The Japanese recruited labours to construct airfields for extra food and payment, while detainees were forced to work. The POWs who worked to build the airstrip also received a small salary weekly, typically enough to purchase an egg. Together with the rest of Southeast Asia, Japan exploited Borneo as a source of raw materials. The Japanese authorities enforced a food self-sufficiency policy. Priority for all resources including foodstuffs was given to Japanese troops with only a limited ration available for the local population. Through Mitsui Morin and Mitsui Bussan, foodstuffs such as rice, maize, tapioca, sweet potatoes and coconut oil were monopolised. Sago supplies were controlled by the Mitsubishi's Tawau Sangyo. Stealing and smuggling were punishable by death. The IJA and the IJN attempted to rebuild the oil industry to contribute to Japan's war effort. The Japanese particularly exploited the Chinese community, mainly due to their support for the Kuomintang and contributions to the China Relief Fund and British war efforts. The elites in major towns bore the heaviest burden and those with lesser resources went bankrupt. The military government strictly controlled Chinese businesses, those who were unwilling were forcibly encouraged. Japanese policy in this area was summarised in Principles Governing the Implementation of Measures Relative to the Chinese [Kakyō Kōsaku Jisshi Yōryō] issued by the Japanese headquarters in Singapore in April 1942. Japanese government-issued 1,000 dollar notes in 1945, featuring a man with water buffaloes in a stream Before the invasion, the Japanese government had printed unnumbered military yen notes for use in all occupied territories in Southeast Asia. Increasing inflation coupled with Allied disruption of Japan's economy forced the Japanese administration to issue banknotes of larger denominations and increase the amount of money in circulation. From January 1942 the Japanese set the military notes at par with the national yen. = Residents = 9 of the 300 indigenous peoples, Malays and Javanese who survived Japanese detention in Miri Effects of the occupation among the local population varied widely. The Japanese allowed Malay officials to maintain their positions in the civil service, but generally Malays were abused together with the Chinese and the indigenous peoples. In response to a directive from Singapore in 1942, the poor treatment of indigenous people began to be alleviated as they were not perceived to be the main enemies of Japan. With the sparse and widely dispersed local population in northern Borneo, the Japanese military administration had little choice but rely to forced labour from abroad, mainly from elsewhere in the Dutch East Indies and occupied China, under the management of the North Borneo Labour Business Society (Kita Boruneo Romukyokai). Chinese skilled workers were brought from Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shantou, and Indonesians from Java. Although all workers were provided with board and lodging, the Chinese received better treatment as they were considered to be the more skilled workers. Most of the Javanese workers were sent to Brunei, while the more skilled Chinese workers were employed in boat-building in Kuching and Elopura. Young Chinese males attempted to avoid being captured for forced labour, while young Chinese females were terrified of being taken as comfort women. Many coastal inhabitants fled to avoid these threats. A search for Chinese agitators on the Mantanani Islands in February 1944 led to the mass killing of 60 Suluk and several Chinese civilians. A Chinese survivor of Japanese detention in Elopura As both Korea and Taiwan had been under the domination of Japan for decades, many citizens of both territories were forced to work for the Japanese military under harsh conditions. A number were sent to Borneo to work as prison guards, replacing the existing Japanese guards. They received no training for the treatment of POWs and many were involved in brutalising the prisoners, whose treatment deteriorated after the replacement of Japanese guards in Elopura by the Taiwanese in April 1943.  Resistance  =Albert Kwok= Albert Kwok, leader of a resistance movement in North Borneo On the west coast of North Borneo, a resistance movement developed led by Albert Kwok, a Chinese from Kuching, who after working with the China Red Cross moved to Jesselton in 1940. He collaborated with local indigenous groups in North Borneo. After establishing contact with American forces in the Philippines Kwok travelled to Tawi-Tawi for training. He returned with three pistols, a box of hand grenades and a promise of further weapons. However, the promised weapons were not delivered and Kwok had to launch a revolt with his locals armed with only knives and spears. Though they were poorly equipped, the attack still managed to kill at least 50 Japanese soldiers and temporarily capture Api, Tuaran and Kota Belud in early November. As the Japanese began to retaliate, Kwok's force retreated to their hide-out. The Japanese launched ruthless counter-measures, bombing coastal settlements and machine-gunning local people. Almost all villages in the area were burnt down and 2,000–4,000 civilians were executed. The Japanese threatened further mass civilian killings and so Kwok surrendered with several of his senior aides. They were executed on 21January 1944 in Petagas, Putatan. After the failed uprising the Japanese conducted regular reprisals. The inhabitants of North Borneo were unable to organise a further uprising due to the level of Japanese surveillance. = Force Z = Members of Operation Agas in sarongs made from parachute silk. The group was formed to carry out guerrilla warfare against the Japanese forces with the full support of the natives. As part of the Borneo Campaign Australian commandos were landed using US submarines. The Allied Z Special Unit began to train Dayak people from the Kapit Division in guerrilla warfare. This army of tribesmen killed or captured some 1,500 Japanese soldiers. They also provided intelligence vital to securing Japanese- held oil fields and to facilitating the landings of Australian forces in June 1945. Most of the Allied activities were conducted under two intelligence and guerrilla warfare operations: Operation Agas in North Borneo; and Operation Semut in Sarawak. Tom Harrisson, a British anthropologist, journalist and co- founder of Mass-Observation was among those parachuted in to work with the resistance.  Liberation  24th Infantry Brigade landing from on Maeda- shima, 10June 1945 The Allies organised a liberation mission known as the Operation Oboe Six to reconquer the northern part of Borneo. This followed their success with Operations Oboe One and Oboe Two. Under the cover of a naval and aerial bombardment, the 9th Australian Division landed on Borneo and Labuan on 10June with a force of around 14,000 personnel. With narrow roads and swampy conditions near the island beaches, the unloading operations by Royal Australian Engineers were hampered. Landings in the Brunei Bay area went more easily. The prediction of strong Japanese resistance proved inaccurate, with only few air raids against the Allied forces. 2/43rd Battalion advance with a Matilda tank on Maeda-shima in a sweep mission to clear the area of Japanese troops, 12June 1945 The 24th Infantry Brigade, part of the 9th Division, landed at the southern end of Labuan, near the entrance of Brunei Bay, and commanding the approach to northern Borneo. The 20th Infantry Brigade landed near Brooketon, on a small peninsula at the southern end of the bay. The 20th Infantry Brigade rapidly secured Brunei Town against relatively light opposition, suffering only 40 casualties in the campaign. The 24th Infantry Brigade encountered stronger opposition in taking Labuan, where the defenders withdrew to an inland stronghold and held out among dense jungle-covered ridges and muddy swamps. To subdue the Japanese resistance an intense naval and artillery bombardment was laid down over the course of a week before an assault was put in by two companies of infantry supported by tanks and flamethrowers. 2/17th Battalion inspecting the bodies of dead Japanese soldiers in Brunei during an operation on 13 June 1945 After securing Labuan, the 24th Infantry Brigade was landed on the northern shore of Brunei Bay on 16June, while the 20th Infantry Brigade continued to consolidate the southern lodgement by advancing south-west along the coast towards Kuching. The 2/32nd Battalion landed at Padas Bay and seized the town of Weston before sending out patrols towards Beaufort, inland. The town was held by around 800–1,000 Japanese soldiers and on 27June an attack was carried out by the 2/43rd Battalion. Amid a torrential downpour and in difficult terrain, the 2/32nd Battalion secured the south bank of the Padas River. Meanwhile one company from the 2/43rd was sent to take the town and another marched to the flanks, to take up ambush positions along the route that the Japanese were expected to withdraw along. The 2/28th Battalion secured the lines of communication north of the river. Indigenous peoples carrying Japanese rifles walking along a street in Brunei on their return to their villages on 17 June 1945 On the night of 27/28June, the Japanese launched six counter-attacks. Amid appalling conditions, one Australian company became isolated and the next morning another was sent to attack the Japanese from the rear. Fighting its way through numerous Japanese positions, the company killed at least 100 Japanese soldiers and one of its members, Private Tom Starcevich was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his efforts. Following this, the Japanese withdrew from Beaufort and the Australians began a slow, cautious advance, using indirect fire to limit casualties. By 12July they occupied Papar, and from there sent out patrols to the north and along the river until the cessation of hostilities. In August the fighting came to an end. The division's total casualties in the operation were 114 killed and 221 wounded, while the Japanese losses were at least 1,234.  Aftermath  = Japanese surrender = Baba signs the surrender document in Labuan, British Borneo, being watched by Australian Major General George Wootten and other Australian units on 10September 1945 After the surrender of Japan on 15August 1945 Lieutenant General Masao Baba, commander of Japanese forces in northern Borneo, surrendered at Layang-layang beach of Labuan on 9September. He was then brought to the headquarters of Australian 9th Division, where at the official surrender ceremony on 10September he signed the surrender document and handed over his sword to the divisional commander, Major General George Wootten. The location became known as Surrender Point. Disarmed Japanese troops marching towards a prisoner of war compound in Api after surrendering to the Australians on 8October 1945 It was estimated that around 29,500 Japanese remained on the island. 18,600 belonged to the IJA, 10,900 to the IJN. The greatest concentrations of Japanese troops were in the interior. There were some Japanese who refused to surrender and moved further inland. After calls from Lieutenant general Baba they also surrendered. The Japanese repatriation following the surrender took several months, delayed due to lack of shipping. It was supervised by the Australians as Borneo along with New Guinea, Papua and the Solomon Islands were under their authority. Australian forces also supervised the destruction of Japanese weapons and ammunition and the evacuation of internees and Allied POWs from Japanese camps. The British Military Administration (BMA) took over the task of management from the Australians on 12September 1945 and summarised the situation towards the end of October: The observation revealed that despite the destruction caused by the Allied bombardments, there were few Japanese casualties. Widespread malnutrition and disease amongst the population was caused by acute food shortages. In response the BMA provided food and medical supplies and reconstructed the public infrastructure, including roads, bridges, the rail network, sewerage and water supplies. = War crimes trials = Presiding members of the war crimes trials in Labuan on 20December 1945 The Australians held war crime trials on Labuan from 3December 1945 to 31January 1946. There were 16 trials involving 145 alleged war criminals, and these resulted in 128 convictions and 17 acquittals. Lieutenant Colonel Tatsuji Suga, who had been responsible for the Batu Lintang camp administration, believing that his entire family had been killed during the US atomic bombing of Hiroshima committed suicide before his trial's conclusion. Captain Susumi Hoshijima, who was responsible for the administration of Sandakan camp, was found guilty of war crimes and hanged in Rabaul, New Guinea in 1946. Captain Susumi Hoshijima (centre) during the war crimes trial in Labuan, January 1946. He was found guilty of causing the deaths of POWs at Sandakan camp and subsequently hanged in 1946. Many Korean and Taiwanese who had been prison guards were tried in the minor war crimes trials. In Sandakan 129 Taiwanese guards were found guilty of brutalising POWs and 14 were sentenced to death. The International Military Tribunal for the Far East concluded that during the resistance movement in North Borneo the military police were involved in torturing and killing hundreds of Chinese in an apparently systematic attempt to exterminate the Suluk coastal population. The last commander of the Japanese army in northern Borneo, Masao Baba, was charged on 8March 1947 with command responsibility for the Sandakan death marches that caused the death of over 2,000 Allied POWs and brought to Rabaul for trial. During the trial he confessed to being aware of the weakened condition of the prisoners but still issuing direct orders for a second march. The trial concluded on 5June with a death sentence; Baba was hanged on 7August 1947.  Honours and legacy  = War memorials = Australian troops inspecting the Labuan War Cemetery after its opening ceremony on 10September 1945 To honour the sacrifices of fallen liberators during operations for the recovery of Borneo, a cemetery named the Labuan War Cemetery was constructed and maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The cemetery holds the graves of 3,908 soldiers, including some POWs from Borneo and the Philippines. Most of the graves are unidentified, the 1,752 identified graves lists 1,523 soldiers, 220 airmen, five sailors and four civilians; 858 Australians, 814 British, 43 Indians, 36 Malayans and 1 New Zealander as well as members of the local forces from North Borneo, Brunei and Sarawak. 34 Indian soldiers, whose remains were cremated, are commemorated on a memorial in the Indian army plot. Each grave was originally marked with a large cross, but later replaced with a headstone. The headstones of those whose names were unknown are emboldened with the words \\"Known Unto God\\". Peace and victory flag from the Jesselton Chinese Celebration Committee presented to the AIF following the end of the war in 1945 The Petagas War Memorial garden is built on the site where hundreds of people, including women and children, were massacred by the Japanese. The memorial lists 324 members of Kinabalu guerrillas of various races and ethnic groups. Other memorials such as the Kundasang War Memorial, the Last POW Camp Memorial and Quailey's Hill Memorial are dedicated to Australian and British soldiers who died in the death marches as well to honouring the sacrifices of the native population. Sandakan Memorial Park is built on the site of Sandakan Camp to honour POWs and internees. The Cho Huan Lai Memorial is dedicated to the Chinese Consulate General and several colleagues who were executed by the Japanese. The Sandakan Massacre Memorial is dedicated to 30 Chinese who were executed by the Japanese for being members of underground movements. The Sandakan War Monument is dedicated to the citizens of the town who died in the war. For bravery in fighting the Japanese in close combat Tom Starcevich was honoured with the Starcevich Monument. The Japanese also remembered, through the Jesselton Japanese Cemetery, Sandakan Japanese Cemetery and Tawau Japanese War Memorial.

In April 2013, Munk announced that Hybris has been extended to allow Wayland compositors to use graphic device drivers written for Android. Weston has had support for libhybris since version 1.3, which was released on 11 October 2013.  Features  Hybris loads \\"Android libraries, and overrides some symbols from bionic with glibc\\" calls, making it possible to use Bionic-based software, such as binary-only Android drivers, on glibc- based Linux distributions. Hybris can also translate Android's EGL calls into Wayland EGL calls, allowing Android graphic drivers to be used on Wayland- based systems. This feature was initially developed by Collabora's Pekka Paalanen for his Android port of Wayland.

The Wellington Convention played a role in the 1991 United Nations General Assembly's resolution calling for a global moratorium of driftnet fishing on the high seas. Creation, signatures, and ratifications The Convention was concluded at Wellington on 24 November 1989. It was opened for signature to states which have territory within the South Pacific. The Convention was signed by Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji, France, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, United States, and Vanuatu.Treaty status. Of the states that signed the Convention, it has not been ratified by France, Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Samoa, which did not sign the Convention, has acceded to it. Additionally, Papua New Guinea has notified New Zealand—the depositary state—that the prohibitions of the Convention had been taken into account when Papua New Guinea enacted its Fisheries Act 1994.

The resolution called for a worldwide moratorium on driftnet fishing and cited the entry into force of the Wellington Convention as contributing support to such a moratorium. Protocols The Convention has two Protocols that supplement it. Both were concluded at Noumea, New Caledonia on 20 October 2000 Ratification of Protocol I allows states that do not have territory in the Convention Area to nevertheless agree that they will prohibit their nationals and their fishing vessels from using driftnets while fishing in the Convention Area. Protocol I has been ratified only by the United States; it entered into force for the U.S. on 28 February 1992.Protocol I status. Ratification of Protocol II allows states that do not have territory in the Convention Area but have territory in the waters that are contiguous to the Convention Area to nevertheless agree that they will prohibit their nationals and their fishing vessels from using driftnets while fishing in the Convention Area.

Born in Alessandria, he was released from his familial bonds (patria potesta) in 1453 when he is documented to have established a workshop in Genoa.Natale, Vittoria. \\"Giovanni Mazone\\". Grove Art Online. Giovanni's father, Giacomo, was also a painter and the family is first mentioned in 1414, in regards to a rental dispute.Italian Encyclopedia His first documented piece is from 1463 for a relief carving of a chapel's altar in Genoa Cathedral, at which time he would have met Vincenzo Foppa who came to Liguria as specified by that contract, and who would later influence Mazone's style. He received another carving contract in 1476 to renovate the main altar in the cathedral. His workshop specialized in making wood frames for polyptychs, and documentation shows he ran a busy establishment. In the mid-1460s he made a polyptych, now dispersed, of Saint Nicholas, heavily decorated with gilded relief work. His Annunciation polyptych, now held at Santa Maria di Castello shows Netherlandish influences, particularly in the rendering of the central panel. Jan van Eyck's portable altarpiece, the Dresden Triptych, was in Liguria in Italy by the end of the 15th century, and apparently influenced Mazone's style.Harbison (1991), Jan van Eyck, The Play of Realism. London: Reaktion Books, 1991. . p. 61 Another polyptych, Virgin and Child Enthroned with the Four Evangelists, shows a number of influences, including Netherlandish and Provençal. Documented workshop assistants from that period probably brought additional stylistic elements to the piece. His single signed and dated work, Noli me tangere was probably produced at about the same period as his triptych of the Nativity. From the 1480s, his ability with perspective grew, when under Foppa's influence he painted Virgin and Child Enthroned and St. Mark with Four Saints. His 1489 Nativity, painted for the Sistine Chapel shows a complete break with Netherlandish influences and a movement toward a Paduan style. This piece was commissioned by Giuliano della Rovere, who went on to become Pope Julius II.

Under the Lanteen Laboratories brand, Riddlesbarger operated a chain of clinics in Illinois, Wisconsin and Michigan, which were promoted through radio advertising. Riddlesbarger is believed to have been an Army Air Corps pilot during World War I. He later worked for the U.S. Post Office, flying air mail starting in 1920, but was grounded in 1921 for failing to promptly report a forced landing, resulting in delay to the mail. Riddlesbarger invented a diaphragm that was successfully marketed through his firm, Lanteen Laboratories, using storefront clinics called \\"Medical Bureaus of Birth Control Information\\" and a variety of media, including radio, direct mailings to doctors, and in packages of sanitary napkins.Holz, p. 134 One of Riddlesbarger's clinic operators, Adele Gordon, was, with her husband John, unsuccessfully prosecuted in 1935 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin for selling birth control devices.Holz, pp. 123-126 Lanteen Laboratories had been organized in 1928, with 90% of its stock owned by Riddlesbarger. Lanteen sold a comprehensive line of products, including contraceptive jellies, douches, tampons and suppositories. The proceeds from Riddlesbarger's venture went to purchase a ranch in southern Arizona which he named Lanteen Ranch, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Kinjockity Ranch. Riddlesbarger commissioned Phoenix architect Edward C. Morgan to design the Pueblo Revival house and guest house, and the interior was decorated by designer and sculptor Raymond Phillips Sanderson. Riddlesbarger, through the Lanteen Arabian Foundation, bred Arabian horses at the ranch, most notably owning Antez, a famous sire originally owned by Will Keith Kellogg. Antez sired Palominos while with Riddlesbarger. Bamboo Harvester, who played Mister Ed in the eponymous television show, was a grandson of Antez. Although he intended to live at the ranch full-time, Riddlesbarger sold the ranch in 1946 and moved to Tucson. He had lost a substantial judgment in tax court over Lanteen's purchase of the ranch lands and subsequent payment of the ranch to him as a dividend. He was unsuccessfully prosecuted in 1948 for statutory rape for an alleged affair with a house servant, and left the United States shortly thereafter. A final divorce decree was granted in favor of his former wife Fay Riddlesbarger in 1948, following proceedings that began in 1931, and allegations of coercion, but further proceedings continued into 1952, reaching the Illinois Supreme Court. Rufus had two daughters with Fay. Legal proceedings in the 1950s indicate that Rufus settled in east Africa in what was then Tanganyika.

On 24 February 1894, Christine attended a lecture of Vivekananda in Detroit, United States which inspired her. She started communicating with Vivekananda through letters. Christine went to India in 1902 and began working as a school teacher and a social worker. In 1911, after the death of Vivekananda's disciple Sister Nivedita, Christine took charges of Nivedita's girls' school. Some scholars of Vivekananda's life, including Sister Gargi and Pravrajika Vrajaprana, believe that Vivekananda regarded Christine as his daughter.  Early life and career  Sister Christine was born as Christina Greenstidel on 17 August 1866, in Nuremberg, Germany. She was a Lutheran who later became a Christian Scientist. She had five younger sisters. When Christine was three years old, her family moved to the United States and settled in Detroit, Michigan. Christine's father was a German scholar, but the family lacked financial resources. She was seventeen years old when her father died, and she became the sole breadwinner of the family, obtaining a job as a teacher in the Detroit Public School system in 1883.  Religious apprenticeship in the United States  = Lectures in Detroit = In 1894, Christine was attending a series of lectures in Detroit with her friend Mary Funke. Swami Vivekananda was in Detroit early that year for six weeks; he delivered several lectures while there. On 24 February 1894, Christine attended a lecture by Vivekananda. She was so impressed by Vivekananda that she attended many more of his lectures and became an admirer and disciple. She later recounted her experience of that first lecture: > Never have I heard such a voice, so flexible, so sonorous. It was the voice > of God to me! That range of emotion, that silvery music—I have never heard > in any other. It was sheer music... > It was the mind that made the first great appeal, that amazing mind! What > can one say that will give even a faint idea of its majesty, its splendour? > It was a mind so far transcending other minds, even of those who rank as > geniuses... Its ideas were so clear, so powerful, so transcendental that it > seemed incredible that they could have emanated from the intellect of a > limited human being. Christine also said that she started loving India after attending Vivekananda's lectures: > Our love for India came to birth, I think, when we first heard [Swami > Vivekananda] say the word, \\"India\\", in that marvellous voice of his. It > seems incredible that so much could have been put into one small word of > five letters. There was love, passion, pride, longing, adoration, tragedy, > chivalry, heimweh,\\"Heimweh\\" is a German word roughly equivalent to > \\"homesickness\\". See Heimweh for details. and again love. Whole volumes could > not have produced such a feeling in others. It had the magic power of > creating love in those who heard it. Ever after, India became the land of > heart's desire. = Meeting at Thousand Island Park = Swami Vivekananda in New York in 1895. That year, he initiated Sister Christine into Brahmacharya at Thousand Island Park. After Vivekananda left Detroit, contact between him and the two young women ceased for a time. In July 1895, Christine and Funke decided to travel to Thousand Island Park in Northern New York State to meet Vivenkananda; he was staying there and teaching a group of his disciples. During the journey, they were caught in a rainstorm and finally reached Thousand Island Park at night, \\"wet, bedraggled and totally unexpected.\\" Vivekananda warmly welcomed them. Funke later recalled the incident saying, \\"He greeted us so sweetly, it was like a benediction.\\" Vivekananda invited them to stay there for a few days and attend his lectures. The two young women at once accepted the invitation. Vivekananda told others that two of his disciples had travelled hundreds of miles to find him. They were to stay from 20 July to 9 August 1895; during that time they attended 18 lectures.  Religious initiation  When Christine and Funke attended the first Saturday lecture, they learned that Vivekananda was initiating some of his disciples. The next Sunday afternoon, Vivekananda told Christine that he did not know Christine well enough to feel sure if she was ready for initiation. He then added that he possessed a power which he used very rarely—the power of reading someone's mind. He asked Christine's permission to read her mind to get to know if she was mentally prepared for initiation. Christine assented and after he starting to read her mind Vivekananda asked her again: \\"May I read all?\\" Christine again assented. On the following day he initiated her. Vivekananda gave Christine a mantra and made her his disciple. Christine later said that Vivekananda was apparently satisfied after reading her mind.  Vows of Bramhacharya  During the lectures, Christine became one of the chosen and favourite students of Vivekananda. He gave five disciples vows of Brahmacharya (lifelong celibacy), and Christine was one of them. Vivekananda dedicated her to the Divine Mother and reserved her for his Indian works. Christine and Funke continued to attend Vivekananda's lectures until he left for New York on 7 August 1895. = Relationship with Vivekananda = Swamiji was in constant touch with Christine. Some scholars of Vivekananda's life, including Sister Gargi and Pravrajika Vrajaprana, believe that Vivekananda regarded Christine as his daughter. He had written in one of his letters to her, when he announced his plan to visit London, \\"It will be such a pleasure to see you\\" and closed with the blessing, \\"Mother knows best. I dedicate you to her forever. What more can I do? This is the highest, the best, and loveliest.\\" She was there to receive him when he arrived at the harbour aboard the ship S.S. Golconda. She also met for the first time Sister Nivedita who had also traveled with Vivekananda. After two weeks in London, he and Christine went to Detroit, a journey described by Christine as a blessing of \\"ten inspiring days in his presence.\\" He stayed with her family for five days. In the later part of the 1890s, she helped in the administrative functions of the Vedanta Society in Detroit. After his return to India, he continued his correspondence with Christine, even composing a nursery rhyme for her. Soon thereafter, Christine's mother died and she decided to move to India. Life in India = Arrival = Sister Christine (left) with Sister Nivedita (right) in India On 7 April 1902, Christine arrived in Kolkata, India. On the next morning she went to Belur Math to meet Vivekananda where she spent the entire day with him. According to the notes of Swami Brahmananda's notebook, Christine started visiting Belur frequently and came to the Math on 18, 23, 25, 26 April and 1, 4 May and stayed for the entire day each time. = Travel to Mayavati = In the summer, as the weather of Kolkata became very warm and dry, Vivekananda decided to send his Western women disciples to Mayavti. Vivekananda initially planned to travel with his disciples and visit the Himalayas, but, the plan was changed later. Sister Nivedita wrote in a letter to Josephine MacLeod, dated 19 April— > Christine and I are staying on here till May the 1st, but Swami is not > coming to us, as I had thought he would... we [Christine and Nivedita] may > come to Mayavati together... I feel that is very possibly her destiny to > remain in the Himalayas a year or so — meditating. I should think that to be > her power. On 5 May 1902, Sister Christine and Sister Nivedita started their journey to Mayavati. Vivekananda paid 150 for their travel expenses. They reached Mayavati on 10 May, where they were cordially welcomed by Mrs. Sevier. They started staying with Vivekananda's disciples of Mayavati. = Death of Swami Vivekananda = Sister Nivedita, Sister Christine, Charlotte Sevier, and Lady Abala Bose in Mayavati Nivedita returned to Kolkata in mid-June as works in her school had already started. Swami Vivekananda died at Belur Math on 4 July 1902. He wrote his last letter to Christine on 21 June (1902). In the second week of July, Christine received Nivedita's letter— > Tomorrow you will receive this news that will desolate your life. I can only > tell Dear, that if my presence could keep you there, you were never absent > from his side on Saturday ... Death came to him so beautifully on Friday > night! A half hour's sleep after meditation, and he was gone! After the death of Vivekananda on 4 July 1902, she came back to Kolkata. She lived in a house of Bosepara Lane, and joined the school run by Sister Nivedita as a teacher. She also helped older women. She remained in India until she returned to the U.S. in 1914. In 1924 she returned to India but found that life on Bosepara Lane had changed in her absence and the house where she had lived a decade before had collapsed. Christine went to the school, hoping to rejoin it as a teacher, but the school authorities rejected her request. She stayed with Basiswar Sen the eminent scientist and agriculturist, first in his house in 8, Bosepara Lane and then in Kundan House in Almora. She lived on an annual allowance of 500 dollars provided by Josephine MacLeod. Boshi Sen used to call Christine his mother and Christine used to treat Boshi as her spiritual child. She had given her only treasures, rosary and letters to Swami Vivekananda to Boshi. In Almora she delved deeper into Raja Yoga which Swami Vivekananda had asked her to follow.Boshi Sen - Scientist and Karmayogi, by Hironmoy Mukherjee, Bulletin of Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, 2009 She stayed in India until March 1928, when she decided to go back to the U.S. because of deteriorating health. She stayed in Detroit for some time and then moved to New York. In New York she fell seriously ill and was admitted to a nursing home of her friend where she died on 27 March 1930.

He returned to Amritsar later to pursue a career as a school teacher. In 1921, Josh took an active interest in the Akali movement for the liberation of gurdwaras from mahants. Josh zealously opposed the British Raj in India, and as a result of his anti- British activities was arrested. He was tried and sentenced to three years imprisonment. At that time he became the member of the Shiromani Gurudwara Parbandhak Committee and the Shiromani Akali Dal. Josh was a prolific writer.

Early life It is believed he was born in Spain in the town called Villa de Reinoso, in Castile, in 1770, although others say that he could have been born in Salta. Son of Francisco Alvarez Arenales and Maria Gonzalez.Los Antepasados, A lo largo y más allá de la Historia Argentina, Ibarguren Aguirre, Carlos Federico, (Unpublished book), Tomo III, Los Hoyos (Reliability: 3). In 1784 he came with his family to Buenos Aires, where he was educated to follow an ecclesiastical career. Arenales chose a military career. Fights in Upper Peru After completing his studies he was sent to Upper Peru, where he was part of the Chuquisaca Revolution of May 25, 1809, first movement against Spanish rule held in the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. With the victory in the Battle of La Florida, he received many wounds and almost lost his life, protected the entrance to the High Peru of the Northern Army, in his third attempt to incorporate the Upper Peru to the revolution, led by José Rondeau, and reoccupied the city of Cochabamba.Genealogy Family tree of Arenales Peruvian War of Independence Signature of Arenales There he was promoted to general and confronted Martin Miguel de Guemes, leader by the way he was carrying on the Guerra Gaucha, successful defensive strategy of defending northern border, but very expensive for the province, especially for high classes. In the mid-1817 he was named provincial commander of the army of Cordoba in almost permanent struggle with small groups of rebels gauchos, no positive results against the feds. = Sierra Campaign = In 1819 Arenales joined the Army of the Andes in Chile. General José de San Martín orders Arenales to command an expedition as part of the Freedom Expedition of Peru, sending him to Pisco, Peru on 5 October 1820, beginning the Sierra Expedition. After his arrival, at the destination, he took over the two major campaigns to the mountains. On 6 December 1820, Arenales led troops into the Battle of Pasco (es), using thick snowfall to launch a surprise attack. Arenales defeated the royalist troops commanded by Diego O'Reilly, capturing O'Reilly and incorporating prisoners into his own forces. Upon news that royalist forces were defeated by Arenales' expedition, the city of Huánuco called for a town meeting on 9 December 1820. Don Eduardo Lúcar y Torre, a colonel of the royalist army, allowed the citizens of Huánuco to vote on whether or not to join Arenales' cause, with the majority voting to join the patriot movement. On 15 December 1820, Huánuco declared independence and because of their assistance, Lúcar y Torre was named Mayor of Huánuco and José Figueroa was named the commander of arms. On 8 January 1821, Arenales regrouped with General San Martín. Governor of Salta On January 1, 1824 he was named governor of Salta. His administration was orderly and efficient, seeking a liberal provincial government in accordance with the central government which had been established by Bernardino Rivadavia in Buenos Aires. The following year he made a final campaign to Upper Peru, hoping to fight against one the last two royalist strongholds in continental America (the other being El Callao in coastal Peru), but royalist general Pedro Antonio Olañeta was murdered by his own soldiers, and ultimately Arenales accomplished nothing. He even failed to reinstate the Tarija region (now in Bolivia) as part of Salta. Death He died in the town of Moraya, Bolivia, in 1831, at the home of Colonel José Manuel Pizarro. He was buried there in the common ossuary except the skull, preserved by Colonel Pizarro and delivered in the city of Buenos Aires to María Josefa Uriburu Arenales, daughter and mother of the future president of Argentina, José Evaristo Uriburu. In May 1959 his remains arrived in Salta, being deposited in the \\"Pantheon of North Glories of the Republic\\", after satisfying a civic-military moving ceremony at the Cathedral of Salta.

History File:NYC Restore The Fourth July 4th.jpgRestore the Fourth NYC Restore the Fourth originated from the social media website reddit shortly after the information leak by Edward Snowden, which detailed the US National Security Agency's (NSA) mass surveillance programs, most notably the PRISM. A subforum (known on reddit as a subreddit) dedicated to the movement was created on June 8, 2013, garnering over 15,000 subscribers in 2 weeks. From there, Restore the Fourth moved to Snoonet, which is an IRC network for reddit communities. Most organization prior to July 4, 2013 occurred there, where local organizers, national organizers, and users from the subreddit collaborated. The first Restore the Fourth protest occurred on June 30, 2013, in Madison, Wisconsin. Subsequent Independence Day protests occurred on July 4 with more than 70 local rallies across all 50 U.S. states and Washington, D.C.Restore the Fourth Protests On July 4, many protests hosted hundreds of attendees, and as many as 500 protesters attended the rallies in Washington, D.C. and 950 in New York City. In Munich, Germany, protesters gathered in front of the U.S. Consulate wearing Edward Snowden masks. Organizers estimated a national turnout of more than 10,000. Further rallies were held to mark Orwell Day (August 4), to push for the passage of the USA Freedom Act (October 26), and to call for the shutting down of the growing network of fusion centers across the United States (April 10). During November 2013 - April 2014, the organization saw a period of significant turnover, before relaunching with national elections in May 2014 as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit with 25 chapters around the country, under the leadership of Alex Marthews.

Responses Restore the Fourth had received support from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Sen. Rand Paul, and Judge Andrew Napolitano. The NSA addressed the July 4 protest in a statement, saying: \\"The Fourth of July reminds us as Americans of the freedoms and rights all citizens of our country are guaranteed by our Constitution.

The pilot had been ordered by ABC on January 31, 2012 and cast during the following two months. Filming began in March. ABC declined to pick up the pilot on May 14, but Lifetime did so on June 22, ordering 13 episodes. Although most of the cast had been selected by this time three additional regular supporting characters were added in November 2012 for inclusion in the pilot and the continuing series. The episode revolves around the murder of a Latina maid in Beverly Hills and the introduction of her cadre of associates who are also Latina maids. The maids are shown in their employment surroundings with their upper class employers who play supporting roles. The main character is not actually a maid but rather the mother of the primary murder subject who poses as a maid to gain entrance into the world where she might find clues to prove her son's innocence. The pilot episode was released online in both Spanish and English on June 9, 2013, before its television debut on June 23. The episode, which was written by series creator Marc Cherry and directed by Paul McGuigan, debuted with a 1.99 rating. The episode was the first episode of any television series with an all Latina leading cast, but the roles as maids was controversial due to its presentation of Latinas in stereotypical roles. Nonetheless, critical feedback was generally positive. Plot Ana Ortiz plays Marisol, the central character of the show. In the opening scene, Evelyn Powell (Rebecca Wisocky) gives her maid Flora (Paula Garces) the following warning \\"I think what you people do is heroic ... You wash clothes you can't afford. You polish silver you will never dine with. ... I am in awe of your determination to succeed in this great country of ours. That said, if you don't stop screwing my husband, I'm going to have you deported.\\" Subsequently, a season-long story arc around which the show revolves begins with Flora's murder. Flora was stabbed by a mysterious figure while scrawling a rape claim that accuses Evelyn's husband Adrian Powell (Tom Irwin). She manages to drag herself to the pool during a lavish party and falls in. At her funeral, her four maid friends Zoila (Judy Reyes), Valentina (Edy Ganem), Rosie (Dania Ramirez) and Carmen (Roselyn Sanchez) agree not to divulge their knowledge of the infidelity and its circumstances. The employer of Zoila and her daughter Valentina, Genevieve Delatour (Susan Lucci), is enduring emotional distress. For both personal reasons and out of concern for Genevieve, Valentina comes up with the idea that Genevieve's son Remi (Drew Van Acker) should return to live at home rather than University of Southern California campus housing in order to help stabilize his mother. Zoila eventually recognizes and tries to temper Valentina's romantic interest in Remi. Meanwhile, Rosie is fighting for her young son to join her from Mexico while working for the self-absorbed Spence (Grant Show) and Peri (Mariana Klaveno). Along with Sam Alexander (Wolé Parks) and Odessa Burakov (Melinda Page Hamilton) Carmen is a staff member for Latino music star Alejandro Rubio (Matt Cedeño) who she is trying to convince to help her start her music career. Marisol (Ana Ortiz), who is not really a maid, successfully interviews to be the fifth maid for the show as an employee of second wife Taylor (Brianna Brown) and Michael (Brett Cullen), who hires her despite objections from Taylor. Background and production The teleplay and story were written by series creator Marc Cherry, and the episode was directed by Paul McGuigan. Most filming occurred in and around Los Angeles. Cherry created the show with a multiple female lead dynamic that was similar to his previous success, Desperate Housewives. His first job in Hollywood was as a personal assistant, allowing him to relate to the maid characters to some degree. He felt that Devious Maids provided a vehicle to deal with themes that Desperate Housewives did not, while being very different than the similarly themed Downton Abbey, due to Downton's historic nature. The format of the show that was pitched to ABC was as a spinoff of Desperate Housewives. While Roselyn Sanchez's character Carmen appeared as a gardener in the final episode of Desperate Housewives, \\"Finishing the Hat\\", the final version that was produced is not strictly a spinoff. ABC ordered the pilot based on the Mexican telenovela Ellas son la Alegría del Hogar (translation: \\"They Are the Home's Joy\\", which is sometimes referred to as The Disorderly Maids Of The Neighborhood), on January 31, 2012. Dania Ramirez was the first lead cast member to be cast, being announced on February 15. Ana Ortiz joined the cast as the central character on February 17. On February 23, both Sanchez and Judy Reyes were added to the cast. When Edy Ganem was announced in the cast on March 2 the show was still described as centering on the other four maids (Ortiz, Reyes, Sanchez and Ramirez). Dania Ramirez plays Rosie. Rebecca Wisocky, who joined the cast on February 23, had previously guest starred on Desperate Housewives as Bree Van de Kamp's mother. She had shot the final season episode, \\"Women and Death\\" less than a month before testing for Devious Maids. Most of the other supporting roles were filled in during March: Brianna Brown (March 6); Susan Lucci, Drew Van Acker and Brett Cullen (all March 9); Mariana Klaveno and Grant Show (both March 12); and Tom Irwin (March 16); Brown was considered for the show after she impressed executive producer Sabrina Wind with her 2011 season 1 guest appearance on Homeland. Eva Longoria was announced as an executive producer on March 26. She had worked previously with Cherry on Desperate Housewives, and was hired to add perspective to the Latina roles. ABC Studios gave Cherry permission to start making senior staffing offers for the show on May 1, which was perceived as an indication that the show would be picked up. Judy Reyes plays Zoila. On May 14, 2012, the pilot was not picked up by ABC for the 2012–13 United States network schedule. On June 22, Lifetime picked up the pilot with a thirteen-episode order. The network stated that they were \\"thrilled to be getting into business with one of entertainment’s true visionaries. This show and Marc Cherry’s unique story telling voice perfectly articulate Lifetime’s strategy of attracting top-tier creatives with their most original and exciting projects.\\" Wolé Parks was added to the cast in a regular role on November 21. Melinda Page Hamilton and Matt Cedeño were added to the cast in recurring roles with the promise of promotion if the show got picked up for a second season on November 26. Both were expected to appear in the pilot episode. The episode was marketed as an important milestone in television history because it was the debut of the first television show with an all Latina leading cast. However, in the days leading up to the debut, there was controversy surrounding the concept of having Latina actresses glorify the stereotypical roles of maids, nannies and gardeners. On May 3, Tanisha Ramirez criticized the show in The Huffington Post as a wasted opportunity, but executive producer Longoria countered that the show presents \\"modern day woman's view on universal themes.\\" Cosmopolitan for Latinas editor Michelle Herrera Mulligan responded to Longoria by calling the show an \\"insulting disgrace\\". Cherry defended the show for its substantive themes: \\"Devious Maids deals with themes of racism, classism and immigration. These women all work in the homes of rich people, but they have goals and dreams that are much greater than the people they work for realize.\\" The pilot episode was released online in both Spanish and English on June 9, 2013, before its television debut on a variety of platforms, including myLifetime.com and the Lifetime video watch app. The first two episodes were available on Lifetime. In the weeks before its June 23 premiere, the cast members were scheduled to host screenings around the country: Ramirez and Sanchez on June 4 in Miami, Reyes and Ganem on June 6 in Dallas, and Ortiz and Lucci on June 11 in Chicago. The show's premier party was held in Los Angeles on June 17. Reception =Ratings= The episode first aired on June 23, 2013 in the United States, debuting with a 1.99 rating in the 10PM (Eastern Time Zone) time slot. In the adults 18-49 viewer demographic, Devious Maids posted a 0.65 rating, which lagged the 0.74 rating for The Client List's season finale the week before in the same time slot for Lifetime. Cable television shows in the same time slot included the Mad Men season 6 finale, \\"In Care Of\\", on AMC (which drew a 2.69 rating), Falling Skies on TNT (3.59 rating). The shows ratings were modest compared to other Lifetime drama series debuts such as Drop Dead Diva, The Client List and Army Wives, which all had ratings close to 3 million. Approximately one third of the Devious Maids viewership for the pilot (662,000) were from the Lifetime network's target demographic of women ages 25-54. The pilot attracted higher ratings in subsequent weeks. =Reviews= The show resembles Desperate Housewives in many ways, including having a \\"pilot\\" that revolves around a death, according to Daily News critic David Hinckley. Hinckley states that the pilot presents each of the five main characters in a way that makes them intriguing, while tackling contemporary issues with a mix of comedy and drama. Hinckley lauded the show by saying \\"... a Cherry drama rises or falls on the pretty simple test of whether it’s fun, and 'Devious Maids' has the right stuff to get to there.\\" Alessandra Stanley, the chief television critic for The New York Times, at first described the show as a \\"landmark\\" where the rich \\"Beverly Hills employers are mere foils for the real heroines, who are poor, Hispanic and striving: desperate housekeepers.\\" Stanley felt that servant heroines are a bit of an overused perspective in 2013 as is the use of tongue-in-cheek humor. After describing the evolution of maid, butler and nanny roles on television, Stanley notes that this was not a show that depicts \\"how the other half really lives\\", but rather \\"an over-the-top dramedy\\". Robert Bianco of USA Today felt the show benefited from not being picked up by ABC, where it would have been in the shadow of Desperate Housewives, and from being scheduled as summer television, where its competition was weak. Bianco believed that the various storylines were gracefully woven together in the scenes of the episode. Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette described the show as a guilty pleasure. Owen stated that although the show was not original for following Desperate Housewives path, it was good summer entertainment that managed to slip in a bit of \\"social satire\\". Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times panned the show's pilot, describing it as \\"a silly, hyperactive version of Downton Abbey\\", although she acknowledged that the episode had elements of The Great Gatsby (the opening murder) and West Side Story (the schoolgirl crush). San Francisco Chronicle critic David Wiegand said \\"the pilot episode may not break any new ground, but it's energetic and funny\\". He also noted that \\"it's a hoot the first time we see the maids get the better of their shallow, self-absorbed bosses...\\", but he felt that this theme might lack the depth to retain audience interest.

They include vernacular Vietnamese language, tribal and montagnard, Chinese language (both from the Chinese domination of Vietnam and the indigenous Confucian administration afterward 1100-1900), Champa and Khmer language names, as well as a number of names influenced by contact with traders and French Indochina.Alexander Woodside Lost Modernities: China, Vietnam, Korea, and the Hazards of World ... 2009- Page 24 \\"Vietnamese place names illustrate the point, such as the names of some of the most important Vietnamese cities south of the Red River delta. Da Nang is probably a Vietnamese transcription of a Cham name, preserving the memory of the old Hinduized kingdom of Champa in what is now central Vietnam; Saigon (officially Ho Chi Minh City since 1975) is probably a Vietnamese transcription of a Khmer place name (although there are other theories); and Hue may well take its name from foreign traders' mispronunciations, centuries ago, of the second word in the name of its Vietnamese prefecture Thuan Hoa.\\" Chinese geographical terms occur frequently in the place names of Vietnam.Soviet Geography - Volume 11 1970 - Page 811 \\"The places of the southern part of Vietnam are of more recent origin. ...

For example, the Đuống River has 3 names: * sông Đuống - Vietnamese \\"river\\" sông, followed by a fully local Vietnamese demotic name Đuống * sông Thiên Đức - Vietnamese \\"river\\" sông followed by a formal tên chữ in Hán \\"Heavenly Virtue\\" * Thiên Đức giang - Chinese name \\"Heavenly Virtue\\" (天德), followed by fully Chinese word for \\"river\\" (江) *Bằng Giang - Chinese name Bằng river (凭江/平江) As in this example it is usual to follow Vietnamese syntax for sông prefix (placing it before the name), and Chinese syntax for suffix giang (placing it after the name). The 4th alternative Đuống giang does not (or should not) exist. Villages often have a local Vietnamese name (often unwritten but known to people who live there), and a formal Chinese tên chữ name assigned by Vietnamese Confucian administrators in previous centuries for taxation and other purposes. Larger towns and Cities however generally only have 1 name - though historically a local demotic name may be remembered, or, as in the case of Saigon, the local purely Vietnamese name may have grown into the official name and a Chinese name created to mimic the sound of the Vietnamese name.

He was born in 1917 in Aleppo. He was the third Supreme Guide of the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood, taking over from Issam al-Attar in 1973. Early life and education Abu Ghuddah was born and raised in Aleppo, studying at the Academy of Islamic Studies in Aleppo and later received advanced training in psychology and education at Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt. His father, Muhammad Ansari, was known to be a pious man, and was a businessman in the textile industry. Muhammad's father, Bashir Ansari, was one of the biggest textile traders in Aleppo, and the family line could be traced back to Khalid ibn al-Walid, one of the companions of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad.Shaykh Abdulfattah Abu Ghuddah (rahimahullah ta\`ala) (1917 - 1997) He manifested differences in views with Al-Dhahabi and Ibn Taymiyyah. Teachers Some of his teachers whom he studied with were giants like: #'Isa al-Bayanuni, #Ibrahim al-Salqini, #Muhammad Raghib al-Tabbakh, #Muhammad al-Nashid, #Muhammad Sa'id al-Idlibi, #Mustafa al-Zarqa, #Muhammad Najib Siraj al-Din #Muhammad Zahid Al-Kawthari Notable Students Among many of his students are: #Shaikh Muhammad Awwamah #Muhammad Taqi Usmani #Muhammad Abdul Malek #Sheikh Nureddin Yildiz #Dr. Taqiyu-d-Deen Nadwi Mazaahiri #Sheikh Muhammad Talha Bilal Maniar #Sheikh Salman Husaini Nadwi Muslim Brotherhood Abu Ghuddah lived in Cairo between 1944 and 1950, during which time he met Hassan al-Banna, the Founder and First General Guide of the Muslim Brotherhood. Abu Ghuddah joined the Muslim Brotherhood under the auspices of al-Banna, and became a member of the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood upon his return to Syria in 1950. He rose to prominence in Islamic circles in Aleppo, and became an instructor at his former school, Academy of Islamic Studies. In 1960 he became an instructor of theology at Damascus University along with the principles of Fiqh, Hanafi Fiqh, and Comparative Fiqh. Abu Ghuddah stood for election in the 1961 parliamentary election, and was later appointed as the Mufti of Aleppo by President Nazim al-Kudsi. Abu Ghuddah was critical of the often authoritarian policies of Issam al-Attar, the Supreme Guide of the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood, whom he claimed was unrestrained in his power and never consulted others on political affairs. al-Attar stepped down from the party leadership in 1962 and Abu Ghuddah replaced him as Supreme Guide of the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood. Abu Ghuddah was critical of the 1966 Syrian coup d'état which brought Salah Jadid to the Presidency. Abu Ghuddah used his position to rally scholars, whom he encouraged to boycott the state and voice opposition to Jadid's violent policies. Ghuddah also appeared at Friday sermons in Aleppo, and encouraged Syrians to oppose Jadid's rule. Ghuddah opposed Jadid's rule extensively, and claimed Jadid did not represent the Syrian people. As a result of Ghuddah's activities in the opposition he was arrested and imprisoned in the remote Tadmor Prison, where he was kept for 11 months, before being released along with all other political prisoners in 1967 as part of an amnesty following the Six-Day War with Israel. Exile and death Abu Ghuddah left Syria and went into exile in Saudi Arabia, where he taught and researched in a variety of Islamic research at the Faculty of Islamic Sciences at Riyadh University, and guest lectured at the Omdurman Institute in Sudan. During the early years of his exile he continued to actively opposed the Syrian government during his exile, and served as the Inspector General of the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood from 1976 to 1983, leading the Islamic uprising in Syria. Following the failure of the uprising Abu Ghuddah abandoned his political career and turned to academia. He taught at Jeddah University and published numerous works on theology. He had his personal library, which he greatly missed during his exile as he was a serious scholar who loved reading, writing, researching, and collecting books. Abu Ghuddah later returned to Syria in December 1995 under an arrangement with the Syrian government whereby he could return to Aleppo as long as he refrained from politics and focus on academia and religion. During his stay in his native land, he suffered a heart attack and developed soreness of the eyes In mid 1996 he returned to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia for medical treatment. He began to bleed from the eyes and the condition got worse despite treatment until he lost consciousness and died in Riyadh on 16 February 1997 (9 Shawwal 1417 AH) at dawn. Mufti Muhammad Taqi Usmani was greatly saddened when he received the news of the demise of his beloved teacher and \\"Shaikh\\". Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian President, promptly sent condolences to the family. An official delegation, including the Minister of the Awqaf, the Governor of Aleppo, and the Chief of the Aleppo Police Department visited the family, and delivered condolences from Hafez al-Assad. Assad also offered the use of his personal plane for transporting Abu Ghuddah's body back to Syria, although he was ultimately buried in Medina near the grave of Muhammad. Travels Abu Ghuddah met Mufti Muhammad Shafi when he visited Damascus in 1956 at a conference arranged by the World Muslim Congress and later visited Karachi in 1962 to research some manuscripts in the libraries of Pakistan and India. Mufti Muhammad Taqi Usmani welcomed him at Darul 'Uloom Karachi with a speech in Arabic. Abu Ghuddah later gave Mufti Muhammad Taqi Usmani ijaazah (permission) to narrate Hadeeth from him. While teaching at Riyadh University, he visited Pakistan several times and obtained ijaazah (permission) to narrate Hadeeth from Mufti Muhammad Shafi. He also stayed in the company Mawlana Sayyid Muhammad Yoosuf Binnori when he visited India. Mufti Muhammad Taqi Usmani admires him so much that he calls him his Shaikh.

It is not known if the company was a 'front' for Seaboard expansion into new markets but the use of a front company has been a common practice in Florida. The railway was to link Jacksonville with both St. Augustine and Pablo Beach (later named: Jacksonville Beach) with a 45-mile rail network. The tunnel would have had the additional bonus of being the first man-made crossing of the St. Johns River and was planned for interurbans and streetcars as well as automobiles and pedestrians. The opening of the St. Elmo Acosta toll Bridge in 1921 connected both sides of the river and it was used by streetcars, automobiles and pedestrians. Nothing more was heard from the FIR&T; Company, but several more interurban schemes played into the area's electric railway history.

Their discovery was announced in 2011. However, later research suggests that the two exoplanets probably do not exist, and that \\"pulsation modes visible beyond the cut-off frequency of the star\\" were a more likely explanation for the signals believed to indicate exoplanets. This is not proven with certainty one way or the other. If it exists, Kepler-70c orbits its host along with another planet, Kepler-70b. Both of these planets orbit very close to their host star. Kepler-70c completes one orbit around its star in just 8.232 hours. It is also one of the hottest exoplanets as of mid-2013. It has a high density, suggesting that it is largely composed of metals. Kepler-70b passes 240,000 km away from Kepler-70c during their closest approach. This is currently the closest recorded approach between planets. Such orbital configuration is relatively stable due to orbital resonance between planets and small Hill spheres of planets due to proximity of the star. According to the main author of the paper in Nature which announced the discovery of the two planets, Stephane Charpinet, the two planets \\"probably plunged deep into the star's envelope during the red giant phase, but survived.\\" However, this is not the first sighting of planets orbiting a post-red giant star - numerous pulsar planets have been observed, including one that orbits closer to its host star, and consequently in a shorter time than, any other planet. Origins The two planets may have started out as a pair of gas giants which spiraled inward toward their host star, which subsequently became a red giant. This engulfed the planets, evaporating all but their solid cores, which now orbit the sdB star. Alternatively, there may only have been one gas giant engulfed in this way, with the rocky/metallic core having survived evaporation but fragmented inside the star. If this theory is correct, the two planets would be two large sections of the gas giant's core. According to the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia, the star left the red giant stage ago.

The ship was constructed in 1981, launching in 1982 and was the first self-unloading vessel designed, for ocean service, built for CSL. In 1997 the vessel was operated on behalf of National Gypsum Company as M.H. Baker III. In 2003, the ship returned to her former name Atlantic Superior. She was sold for scrap and broken up at Xinhui by Jiangmen Zhong Xin Shipbreaking in 2015. Design and description Atlantic Superior had a gross register tonnage of 24,638 tons and a deadweight tonnage of 38,510. The ship was long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of . The ship was powered by a diesel engine driving one shaft. This gave Atlantic Superior a maximum speed of . The ship had a draught of . The ship had five holds and had a total capacity including hatches of . The ship could discharge her contents via a boom. The boom could elevate from level and had a total height of . The boom could swing in a 180° arc and sat from the stern of the ship. The discharge rate was 4,000 tonnes per hour for coal and 5,500 tonnes per hour for ores. Service history Atlantic Superior was laid down by Collingwood Shipbuilding at Collingwood, Ontario and launched on 9 November 1981. The ship was completed on 28 June 1982. On 30 September 1982, in her first year of service, the vessel ran aground on Seven Isle Shoal in the lower reaches of the St. Lawrence River. She ran aground at 4 am in foggy conditions while en route to Quebec City. She was carrying a load of wheat from Thunder Bay, Ontario. 2,000 tons of wheat had to be removed before three tugs were able to free her from the shoal on 1 October 1982. In 1994 CSL shifted the vessel to the Pacific Ocean. In 1997 the vessel was moved back to the Atlantic Ocean, was renamed M.H. Baker III, and started operating for the National Gypsum Company. CSL continued to own the vessel, and operated it on behalf of National Gypsum under a long term contract. She was renamed Atlantic Superior in 2003, and CSL operated her on the Great Lakes for several years. CSL operated her largely on the Atlantic Ocean again, making occasional voyages to the Great Lakes.

In the Ezhil programming language, Tamil keywords and language-grammar are chosen to easily enable the native Tamil speaker write programs in the Ezhil system. Ezhil allows easy representation of computer program closer to the Tamil language logical constructs equivalent to the conditional, branch and loop statements in modern English based programming languages. Ezhil is the first freely available programming language in the Tamil language and one of many known non-English- based programming languages. The language was officially announced in July 2009, while it has been developed since late 2007. Description The syntax of Ezhil is broadly similar to that of BASIC: blocks of code are run in sequential order, or via functions definitions, in a common control flow structures include \`while\`, and \`if\`. The termination of function block and statement blocks should have the termination keyword, similar to END in BASIC. Declarations are not necessary as Ezhil is a dynamic typed language, though type conversions must be made explicitly. Ezhil has built-in types for Numbers, Strings, Logicals and Lists. =Goals= * Educational: Ezhil language is targeted toward K-12 students, and native-Tamil speakers, to learn elementary computerscience principle * Intuitive: Ezhil language syntactic sugar is arranged to allow a sentence structure closer to the head final Tamil language, where the usual word order is SOV, in contrast to the SVO order of English. =Features= * Arithmetic and logical operations, precedence indicated with parenthesis * Over 350+ builtins - many of them commonly found in the Python standard library * Procedural programming using functions, supporting recursion, call-by-value etc. * Ezhil as a language - it is not a macro-processor, and it is a complete compiler-front-end * Ezhil language has syntax highlighting support for Notepad++ and Emacs =Keywords= Conditional Statements are modeled after the IF-ELSEIF-ELSE statement . Loop control statements deriving from the WHILE statements are chosen. The function declaration syntax is kept simple. Details include the print statement, and the flow control statements below. 1.- : PRINT statement - பதிப்பி 2.- : BREAK statement - நிறுத்து 3.- : CONTINUE statement - தொடர் 4.- : RETURN statement - பின்கொடு 5.- : IF-ELSEIF-ELSE-statement - ஆனால், இல்லைஆனால், இல்லை 6.- : END-statement - முடி 7.- : FUNCTION-statement - நிரல்பாகம் 8.- : WHILE- statement - வரை =Type system= Ezhil has four basic types, for Numbers, Strings, Logicals and Lists. It does not allow creation of new types, being a procedural language without structures or objects. Language - control structures, function declarations and operators grammar Standard language grammar for control structures for Ezhil language is given below, Ezhil programs in Notepad++ syntax highlighting mode =If-else statement= @( CONDITION ) ஆனால் #True branch இல்லை #False branch முடி =Loop statement= @( CONDITION ) வரை #LOOP BODY முடி =Operators= Standard logical operators, equality \\"\\", inequality \\"!=\\", arithmetic comparison \\">=\\", \\"<=\\",\\">\\",\\"<\\" are supported. Arithmetic operators like \\"+\\",\\"-\\",\\"*\\",\\"/\\" indicate standard plus, minus, product, division. Modulo is denoted by \\"%\\", and exponent by \\"^\\" characters. =Comments= '#' character denotes a single-line comment from the point to end-of-line. Multi-line comments are not defined. =Function declaration= நிரல்பாகம் [FUNCTION_NAME] ( ARGLIST ) [FUNCTION BODY] முடி Variable scoping, and visibility Ezhil supports only call-by- value, and copies all data structures on function invocations. Globals are not supported. Recursion is supported and functions invocation copies variables. Implementations Current Ezhil implementationhttps://github.com/arcturusannamalai/Ezhil-Lang is tightly integrated with the Python runtime. Ezhil interpreter is based on a readline- like CLI, while it can also be run in a batch mode. The interactive mode consumes programs as UTF-8 encoded text and builds a tree, using a compiler front-end, to build an AST, and executes it using the Python objects build from this AST.

After having a mediocre rookie season, Kim broke out in the 2008–09 season when he ranked fourth in total points with 513. The following season, he racked up a team- leading 530 total points, ranked fourth in the league. In the 2010–11 season, he was sidelined with ankle ligament injury. He came back from the injury prior to the 2010-11 postseason but struggled throughout the postseason, scoring only 20 points in three semi-playoff games. In the 2011–12 season, Kim converted his position to opposite spiker to fill a void at opposite spiker after an injury to Milan Pepic. As an opposite spiker, Kim had another breakout season, scoring a career-high 671 points. Prior to the 2012-13 V-League season, Kim helped the Greaters win their first KOVO Cup, scoring over 20 points every game during the tourney, and eventually earned MVP honors. The Greaters, however, finished the 2012-13 regular season in fifth place, failing to reach the postseason. Kim was named the Greaters' captain in 2012. However, his team and individual performance deteriorated during his captaincy reign. From 2012 to 2017 the Greaters missed the playoffs and Kim's offensive stats declined gradually, plagued by ankle and waist problems. After the 2016–17 season, Kim was traded to OK Savings Bank Rush & Cash, and converted his position to middle blocker due to his chronic waist injuries. =National team= While attending Inha University in 2005, Kim got called up to the South Korean national under-21 team for the 2005 World Junior Championship, where South Korea finished in sixth place.

A knowledge society differs from an information society in that the former serves to transform information into resources that allow society to take effective action while the latter only creates and disseminates the raw data.Castelfranchi, C. (2007). Six critical remarks on science and the construction of the knowledge society. Journal of Science Communication, 6(4), 1-3. The capacity to gather and analyze information has existed throughout human history. However, the idea of the present-day knowledge society is based on the vast increase in data creation and information dissemination that results from the innovation of information technologies.Vallima, J. & Hoffman, D. (2008). Knowledge society discourse and higher education. Higher Education, 56(3), 265-285. The UNESCO World Report addresses the definition, content and future of knowledge societies.United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (2005). Toward knowledge societies. UNESCO World Report. Conde-sur-Noireau, France: Imprimerie Corlet.  Information and communication technology  The growth of Information and communication technology (ICT) has significantly increased the world’s capacity for creation of raw data and the speed at which it is produced. The advent of the Internet delivered unheard-of quantities of information to people. The evolution of the internet from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 offered individuals tools to connect with each other worldwide as well as become content users and producers. Innovation in digital technologies and mobile devices offers individuals a means to connect anywhere anytime where digital technologies are accessible. Tools of ICT have the potential to transform education, training, employment and access to life- sustaining resources for all members of society.van Weert, T. J. (2006). Education of the twenty-first century: New professionalism in lifelong learning, knowledge development and knowledge sharing. Education and Information Technologies, 11(3), 217-237. However, this capacity for individuals to produce and use data on a global scale does not necessarily result in knowledge creation. Contemporary media delivers seemingly endless amounts of information and yet, the information alone does not create knowledge. For knowledge creation to take place, reflection is required to create awareness, meaning and understanding. The improvement of human circumstances requires critical analysis of information to develop the knowledge that assists humankind. Absent reflection and critical thinking, information can actually become \\"non-knowledge\\", that which is false or inaccurate.Innerarity, D. (2012). Power and knowledge: The politics of the knowledge society, European Journal of Social Theory, 16(1), 3-16. The anticipated Semantic Web 3.0 and Ubiquitous Web 4.0 will move both information and knowledge creation forward in their capacities to use intelligence to digitally create meaning independent of user-driven ICT.Harvey, P.L. (2010). Applying social systems thinking and community informatics thinking in education. In Rudestam, K.E., & Schoenholtz-Read, J. (Eds.), 91-128. Handbook of online learning. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc.Berners-Lee, T. (2009, Mar 13). Tim Berners-Lee: The next web of open, linked data [Video]. Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM6XIICm_qo  Social theory  The social theory of a knowledge society explains how knowledge is fundamental to the politics, economics, and culture of modern society. Associated ideas include the knowledge economy created by economists and the learning society created by educators. Knowledge is a commodity to be traded for economic prosperity. In a knowledge society, individuals, communities, and organizations produce knowledge-intensive work. Peter Drucker viewed knowledge as a key economic resource and coined the term knowledge worker in 1969.Drucker, P.F. (1969). The age of discontinuity: Guidelines to our changing society. New York, NY: Harper & Row Fast forward to the present day, and in this knowledge-intensive environment, knowledge begets knowledge, new competencies develop, and the result is innovation.Paavola, S. & Hakkarainen, K. (2005). The knowledge creation metaphor: An emergent epistemological approach to learning. Science & Education, 14, 535-557. A knowledge society promotes human rights and offers equal, inclusive, and universal access to all knowledge creation. The UNESCO World Report establishes four principles that are essential for development of an equitable knowledge society: *Cultural diversity *Equal access to education *Universal access to information (in the public domain) *Freedom of expression However, they acknowledge that the digital divide is an obstacle to achievement of genuine knowledge societies. Access to the internet is available to 39 percent of the world’s population.Sanou, B. (2013). The world in 2013: ICT fact and figures. Retrieved from http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ICTFactsFigures2013.pdf This statistic represents growth as well as a continued gap. Among the many challenges that contribute to a global digital divide are issues regarding economic resources, geography, age, gender, language, education, social and cultural background, employment and disabilities.  Politics  To reduce the span of the digital divide, leaders and policymakers worldwide must first develop and understanding of knowledge societies and second, create and deploy initiatives that will universally benefit all populations. The public expects politicians and public institutions to act rationally and rely on relevant knowledge for decision-making. Yet, in many cases, there are no definitive answers for some of the issues that impact humankind. Science is no longer viewed as the provider of unquestionable knowledge and sometimes raises more uncertainty in its search for knowledge. The very advancement of knowledge creates the existence of increased ignorance or non-knowledge.Gross, M. (2010). Ignorance and Surprise: Science, Society, and Ecological Design. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. This means that public policy must learn to manage doubt, probability, risk and uncertainty while making the best decisions possible. To confront the uncertainty that comes from an increase in both knowledge and the resulting lack of knowledge, members of a society disagree and make decisions using justification and observation of consequences. Public policy may operate with the intent to prevent the worst possible outcome versus find the perfect solution. Democratization of expert knowledge occurs when a knowledge society produces and relies on more experts. Expert knowledge is no longer exclusive to certain individuals, professional or organizations. If in a knowledge society, knowledge is a public good to which all people have access, any individual may also serve as a creator of knowledge and receive credit as an expert. Since politicians rely on expert knowledge for decision making, the layperson who may lack specialized knowledge might hold a view that serves as expertise to the political process.  Education  As technologies are deployed to improve global information access, the role of education will continue to grow and change. Education is viewed as a basic human right. For a society where reading and counting are a requisite for daily living, skills in reading, writing, and basic arithmetic are critical for future learning. However, in a knowledge society, education is not restricted to school. The advent of ICT allows learners to seek information and develop knowledge at any time and any place where access is available and unrestricted. In these circumstances, the skill of learning to learn is one of the most important tools to help people acquire formal and informal education. In a knowledge society supported by ICT, the ability to locate, classify and sort information is essential. Equipped with this skill, the use of ICT becomes an active versus a passive endeavor and integral to literacy and lifelong learning. One marker of a knowledge society is continuous innovation that demands lifelong learning, knowledge development, and knowledge sharing. The institution of education will need to become responsive to changing demands. Education professionals will need to learn along with everyone else, and as leaders of changing designs in learning, they will serve as a bridge between technology and teaching. The ability to individually reflect on personal learning requirements and seek knowledge in whatever method is appropriate characterizes lifelong learning. One model that supports this type of learning is the W. Edwards Deming Plan-do-check-act cycle that promotes continuous improvement. Educational professionals will need to prepare learners to be accountable for their own lifelong learning.

The strike-slip earthquake killed at least 35 people and injured 276 others in the province of Aceh (on the northern end of Sumatra) where approximately 4,300 homes were damaged or destroyed. Background Earthquakes are common in Sumatra as it lies at the convergent boundary where the Sunda Plate is subducting beneath the Indo-Australian Plate. The plates are converging obliquely at a rate of 60 mm per year and the right lateral component is accommodated by strike-slip faulting within Sumatra, mainly on the Great Sumatran fault. In 2004, Sumatra was devastated by the Sumatra–Andaman earthquake and resulting tsunami that killed tens of thousands in the area and 230,000 people around the Indian Ocean. In 2009, an earthquake near Padang on Sumatra killed more than 1,000. In April 2012, an 8.6-magnitude quake killed five people in Aceh. Earthquake characteristics At 2:37pm local time (07:37 UTC) on July 2, 2013, a 6.1 magnitude earthquake struck at a depth of with an epicenter near Sumatra's northwestern tip, south of Bireun. It occurred on the Semangko Fault. The quake lasted approximately 15 seconds and was felt from regional capital Banda Aceh to Bener Meriah. The quake was powerful enough to cause concern in Banda Aceh, from the epicenter, and shaking was felt as far as Malaysia. At least fifteen aftershocks occurred, with three powerful ones registering magnitudes of 4.3, 5.5 and 5.2. Damage A damaged house As of July 5, the official death toll stood at 35, with eight people still missing. A further 276 people were injured. The Bener Meriah and Central Aceh districts were hardest hit by the quake. In Bener Meriah, nine deaths were reported. More than 100 people were hospitalized due to their injuries and 537 houses were badly damaged in the district. A further 252 houses suffered minor damage. Several hundred residents slept outdoors the night of July 2, afraid to return to their homes for fear of aftershocks. \\"There were strong aftershocks last night and people didn’t want to go back home, so they stayed in the open overnight,\\" commented an official, \\"but we don’t have enough tents\\". In Central Aceh, 26 deaths were reported. A mosque collapse killed six children and trapped 14 others. Rescuers dug through the rubble throughout the night of July 2–3, but did not locate any of the trapped children. Numerous landslides occurred in the district and 1,368 houses were destroyed. A further 2,135 houses suffered minor damaged. On July 3, a local official commented \\"People are still frightened, especially after the aftershocks last night. Nobody dared to stay at home. Everyone slept on the roads or in car parks.\\" The main hospital was overcrowded with patients, causing tents to be set up outside to handle the overflow. Response A government plane and helicopter were sent in to assist local police and soldiers in rescue efforts. Several roads were destroyed in the quake or blocked by landslides, hampering rescue efforts. Power and cell phone tower outages made communications difficult. Three truckloads of bottled water, food, and other supplies were dispatched to the region. The Aceh Disaster Mitigation Office said more help would be provided when they had better data on what was needed.

A member of the Liberal party, he is the son and political heir of the assassinated political activist, politician, and presidential candidate, Luis Carlos Galán Sarmiento. Career Galán attended the Instituto Pedagógico Nacional in Bogotá, where he graduated in 1989, the year his father was assassinated. After his family relocated to France, he enrolled at the Paris Institute of Political Studies where obtained a Certificate of Political Studies in 1992. He later attended the École des Hautes Études Internationales, also in Paris, where he graduated in 1996 with a Licentiate in International Affairs, and in 1997, graduated again with a Master of International Affairs with his thesis: New Liberalism: Or the New Way of Doing Politics in Colombia, that was later published by Planeta publishing company in Colombia. In 2003 he received a Master of Science in Foreign Service from the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. In 1997, he returned to Colombia after eight years abroad, and quickly took the mantle of politics left by his father. He backed Rudolf Hommes Rodríguez against his uncle Antonio Galán Sarmiento in the mayoral race for Bogotá, which caused a great deal of controversy, and he went on to disavow former associates of his father for abusing the memory of his father and using his image for political gains, which infuriated members of the New Liberalism party, which his father had founded. He further moved to the right of his father when in 1998, he backed the Conservative party presidential candidate, Andrés Pastrana Arango. He became the campaign's youth director for Pastrana, and after Pastrana won the election, he named Galán Deputy Director for Youth at the Ministry of National Education. In 2004, he was named Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Embassy of Colombia in London by President Álvaro Uribe Vélez. He resigned in August 2005, and returned to Colombia to run for Senate. =Senate= Galán ran for Senate during the 2006 elections as the second-in- line of the open-option electoral list put forth by the Liberal party. The Liberal party list received a total of 1,436,657 votes, of which Galán received 64,449, the second-highest number of votes after Juan Manuel López Cabrales, the third-in-line of the Liberals' electoral list. During this term he was a member of the Senate's Second Commission that deals with Foreign Affairs and National Defence. He ran again in 2010, this time as head of the open-option electoral list put forth by the Liberal party. The Liberal party obtained 1,724,151 votes, of which 81,555 were for Galán who obtained the second-highest number of votes after Arlet Patricia Casado Fernández, the third-in-line of the Liberals' electoral list. He is currently a member of the Senate's First Commission that deals with Statutory Laws and Internal Affairs. Political positions =Drugs= Galán is in favour of drug liberalization policies, both to decriminalize and to legalize its use, and has openly called for a public debate on the issue in light of the failure of the War on Drugs. Galán was the author of Law 1566 of 2012 which made psychoactive drug use, abuse, and addiction a public health issue, and mandated that it be treated as a disease, thus placing its treatment under the existent publicly funded health care system. =Euthanasia= Galán is in support of voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, and as member of the Senate's First Commission voted in favour and worked to pass legislation that would regulate such practices. Both practices are allowed in Colombia after a 1997 Constitutional Court ruling, but no such laws to document and regulate the practice have been passed by Congress, preventing many from taking such measures, \\"no one can be legally forced to suffer or feel pain, to prolong a painful life, everyone has every right to be the master of their destiny and to have available the opportunity to decide, together with their family, about euthanasia procedures\\". =LGBT rights= In 2013, Galán voted in favour of Recognition of same-sex unions in Colombia both in the Senate's First Commission and in the floor of the senate, expressing his position in favour of marriage for same-sex couples over other forms of legal unions which he considered non-viable. Personal life Juan Manuel was born on 29 July 1971 in Bogotá, D.C., Colombia, to Luis Carlos Galán Sarmiento and Gloria Pachón Castro; the eldest of their three children; his two younger brothers are, Claudio Mario and Carlos Fernando. His father, Luis Carlos, was a former Education Minister, Ambassador, and Senator, who was shot to death by hitmen hired by the notorious drug lord Pablo Escobar on 18 August 1989, when the former was running for President of Colombia. Juan Manuel's maternal aunt, Maruja, then-wife of Luis Alberto Villamizar Cárdenas, was kidnapped a year later, also on orders of Escobar, as part of a larger scheme by Escobar and his allies to put pressure on the Government to stop an extradition deal with the United States, something Juan Manuel's father supported.

She is married to Sanjay Singh, who is a retired Indian Foreign Service officer. Career Singh is an Indian Foreign Service officer of the 1976 batch. She is a German speaker and served in various positions at the Indian embassies at Bonn, Accra, Paris, and Bangkok. She was India's Consul general at Milan during 2000–04. She has also served as India's High Commissioner to Australia (2007–2012). In Delhi she has served on the Ministry's Economic Co-ordination Unit and dealt with Nepal, West Europe and the EU as director, undersecretary and joint secretary. Her tenure as High Commissioner to Australia was marked by turbulence in Indo-Australian ties following racial attacks on Indian students and later by the Australian Labour Party's decision to make an exception for India regarding the sale of uranium. She has a reputation for toughness, volunteering as a liaison officer on a rain-hit Kailash Manasarovar Yatra in 1983, taking a tough stance with the Australian authorities on dealing with the racial attacks against Indians there, and, as joint secretary handling Western Europe, she advocated India's stance of not accepting prescriptive aid from small European Union nations.  Foreign Secretary  In 2013 Sujatha Singh succeeded Ranjan Mathai as Foreign Secretary of India. She was appointed over S. Jaishankar, and assumed office on 1 August 2013.The fact that she had never served as ambassador to any of India's neighbouring nations was seen as a challenge, and it was said that she had been favored for the post for being a woman, and the UPA government under chairperson Sonia Gandhi was absolutely diligent in promoting women wherever remotely possible. Singh was the third female officer to head the Indian diplomatic corps after Chokila Iyer and Nirupama Rao. In the normal course, she should have retired from the Indian Foreign Service in July 2014 upon her 60th birthday, but appointments to the position of foreign secretary are usually made for a tenure of two years, and such was the case with her. She thus received an extension in service of thirteen months, and her two-year term as Foreign Secretary should have ended in August 2015. However, a government order on 28 Jan 2015, issued by the newly elected government of Narendra Modi, terminated her extended service and appointed another person to the post of Foreign Secretary. This was S. Jaishankar, who as Indian Ambassador to United States had played a key role during Indian Prime Minister Modi's visit to the US, and in US President Obama's visit to India.

The effect is non-linear and reversible. The effect was observed by N. Normand and O. Normand., who observed that the permittivity, of chalcogenide glass increased by as much as 5% when irradiated with an electron gun in the 30 keV range; they also noticed that the change was accompanied by a change in the thickness of the film. Recently San-Roman-Alerigi, Anjum and Ooi, demonstrated that the permittivity of chalcogenide thin films could also be reduced by as much as 50% when the sample was illuminated by 300 keV electrons; moreover they also demonstrated that the electron induced permittivity modification was reversible Mechanism The change in permittivity occurs because of the disruption in the atomic structure of the materials. That is, the changes are due to the breaking of bonds and re- bonding within the atomic structure of the amorphous or crystalline structures. This modification in turn modifies the carrier traps within the band structure, reducing them, and hence ensuing the decrement in the permittivity This contrasts with the photorefractive effect where the change is induced by the alteration in the electron distribution due to the photon- absorption.

Administratively, it is part of the St. Joseph's Parish in the Archdiocese of Semarang. Constructed between 1870 and 1875 to meet the needs of Semarang's growing Catholic population, the red-brick church building was designed by the Dutch architect W. I. van Bakel and built at a cost of 110,000 gulden. The church grew extensively over the following fifty years, at first dominated by ethnic Europeans and persons of mixed descent but later having a majority indigenous congregation. As the Catholic population grew, the size of the parish diminished as new ones were established. The church complex consists of, among other things, the church building, a presbytery, and a convent. St. Joseph's itself is highly decorated, including nineteen stained glass windows (including three dedicated to church's patron saint, Joseph), carvings showing the fourteen Stations of the Cross, and an altar imported from Germany. The single tower is home to two bells produced by Petit & Fritsen. History =Catholicism in Semarang= The Roman Catholic Church first entered Semarang, Dutch East Indies, in what is now Central Java, Indonesia, in the early 19th century. In 1808 Father Lambertus Prinsen (1777–1840) was sent from the Netherlands to the Indies as the pastor for Semarang and several surrounding settlements, including Salatiga and Klaten. He quickly established a council for handling religious duties, and baptisms began the following year; fourteen people, mostly Dutch, were baptised in 1809. However, this congregation did not have a church in which they could pray. Until 1815 the congregation used the nearby Immanuel Church, a building intended for Protestants. Between 1815 and 1822 services were held at the homes of members of the congregation, then from 7 August 1822 Mass was held at Prinsen's new home (near Immanuel). The congregation required its own church building, and already owned land which could be used: in 1828 the Catholics had purchased a former hospital and the surrounding land in Gedangan, near the , and established an orphanage there. However, there were insufficient clergy for further development. Mgr. Joseph Lijnen (1815–82), who had become the congregation's pastor in 1858, left the Indies for Heythuysen, Netherlands. There, he convinced several Franciscan nuns to join him in the Indies and develop the congregation through education and ministry. Upon returning to the Indies, designs were made for a church building across from the orphanage and convent established for the nuns. =A new church= The church was designed by Dutch architect W. I. van Bakel in a neogothic style. The construction costs of 110,000 gulden were funded partly by the colonial government, as well as the sale of unused land and donations from Catholics throughout the colony. The first stone was laid by the pastor Lijnen on 1 October 1870, and construction continued smoothly until 12 May 1873, when the nearly completed tower collapsed; various reasons have been put forward, including an insufficient frame and poor quality bricks. After the collapse, the design of the church was modified to be lower, and further construction was undertaken using bricks imported from the Netherlands as ballast for ships. The construction of the building was completed on 12 December 1875, and the church was blessed by Lijnen. It was the first Catholic church in the city, and served mostly those of European or mixed descent. Interior of Gedangan Church Further additions to the interior were made over the next quarter-century. A new Gothic altar, produced in Düsseldorf, Germany, was installed in 1880. Two years later a communion bench was installed. The tower was also given a clock and bells during this period; the clock was removed in 1978 since the machinery was broken. Lijden died in 1882, and the Jesuit Joannes de Vries became the parish priest, the first in an unbroken line of Jesuit pastors which continues until the present day. De Vries was soon after elected provincial superior for the province, and thus he spent much of his time away from the church. By 1885 there were 1,620 Catholics in Semarang, up from approximately a thousand four years earlier. Many of these were in the colonial military. J. Keijzer replaced de Vries after the latter's death in 1887 and headed the church for seven years. During his tenure, the church and surrounding grounds were expanded significantly. Construction of a multi-story presbytery began in the 1880s and completed on 1 August 1890. Across the street, in 1888 the nuns established an elementary school, and they also began construction of a chapel for the convent, which was opened on 6 August 1892. During this period the church building received stained glass windows and new pews. Further construction continued into the 20th century. A pipe organ was installed in 1903; it was restored in 1993, but remains in poor condition. Also installed that year were carvings depicting the fourteen Stations of the Cross. =Growth and evangelism among the indigenous population= At the close of the 19th century the Catholic church in the Indies began targeting the majority-Muslim indigenous population. They were not alone; Protestant missionaries such as Sierk Coolsma of the Netherlands Missionary Union and Mattheus Teffer of the Netherlands Missionary Society had had some success with the Sundanese in Cianjur and Javanese in Ambarawa, respectively. Keijzer, before stepping down as head pastor in 1894, sent a letter to the Netherlands asking that men be sent to learn the Javanese language, in order to enable them to preach to the people and translate the catechism and some prayer books. Three Jesuits were sent \\\\- P. Hebrans in 1895 and P. Hoevanaars and Frans van Lith (1863-1926) in 1896. The three studied Javanese in Gedangan over a period of a year. Ultimately van Lith was the most successful, establishing a school in Muntilan to train teachers, who were hoped to further spread Catholicism through their teaching duties. This eventually led to the establishment of the , which established a number of Catholic schools throughout Java. Furthermore, in 1904 he spearheaded a mass baptism at Kalibawang, Kulon Progo, near Yogyakarta. A total of 168 Javanese were baptised. Van Lith's efforts eventually returned to Semarang, where he established a Kanisius school in the parish of Gedangan in 1924. By the early 20th century the Catholic population of Semarang had become large enough to support multiple parishes. In 1915 the chapel in Karangpanas, in the southern part of Semarang, was elevated to the status of parish church and dedicated to St. Athanasius. A third church, in the Randusari area of western Semarang, was established in 1927 and became a parish church in 1930. Further parishes were established over the following decades, until in 2000 St. Joseph's Church was one of nine parish churches in the city, serving the subdistricts of East Semarang, Genuk, Sayung, and parts of North Semarang. In 1940, under recommendation of Mgr. Petrus Willekens, the Apostolic Vicariate of Batavia was divided in two; Semarang became the capital of the new vicariate. The newly appointed vicar apostolic, Mgr. Albertus Soegijapranata (1896–1963), had his seat at the church in Randusari, but lived in the presbytery in Gedangan. =After the colonial period= Japanese occupation, the clergy prevented seizure of the presbytery. In March 1942 the Indies were occupied by the Empire of Japan. The occupation government captured numerous (mostly Dutch) men and women, both clergy and laymen, and instituted policies that changed how services were held. They forbade the use of Dutch in services and in writing, and seized several church properties; several others, including the presbytery at Gedangan, were protected by the clergy. After two European head pastors, G. Schoonhoff and G. de Quay, were confined, ultimately on 27 August 1943 the ethnic Javanese Soegijapranata took on parish duties in addition to his work as vicar apostolic. Although he promoted non-compliance with Japanese demands considered damaging to the church, Soegijapranata also endorsed some collaboration. For instance, on 28 February 1944 a Latin-language Mass was delivered at Gedangan by , bishop of Nagasaki. On 17 August 1945, shortly after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and with Japan's defeat an increasing certainty, President Sukarno proclaimed the independence of the Indonesian state. During the ongoing revolution against returning Dutch forces, Europeans were detained (although the Dutch head pastors remained). These detentions, and post-revolution politics which decimated the European population in independent Indonesia, ensured that the congregation remained dominated by the Javanese and other indigenous peoples. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s Gedangan remained a center of Catholic activity in Semarang. The Jesuit provincial superior continued to be placed in the Gedangan presbytery until 1949, when he was moved to the church in Karangpanas, then again from 1954 to 1962 (when he was sent to Karangpanas again). The central offices of the Kanisius Foundation remained on the church grounds until a new office was opened in 1970. Further construction has continued as well: an office building, named Bintang Laut, was completed on 6 August 1988, and renovations to the church building took place in the early 1990s. The church continues to hold regular services, including five on Sundays. Description One of the church's stained glass windows St. Joseph's Church is located on the east side of Ronggo Warsito Street in Semarang, Central Java. Administratively, it is part of the parish of St. Joseph in the Archdiocese of Semarang. The red-brick building can seat 800 people. It faces west and has windows on all sides, as well as five entrances (two on the north side, two on the south side, and one on the west side). The roof is a white cross-ribbed vault supported by ionic columns. The interior of the church has nineteen stained glass windows, three behind the altar and eight along each side of the church building. The windows behind the altar focus on St. Joseph and depict, from right to left, the sojourn of the Holy Family in Egypt; the daily lives of the Holy Family; and the death of Joseph. Four of the sixteen windows on the sides of the church (those closest to the altar and those closest to the doors) depict lilies. The remaining twelve windows each depict a single saint, including Ignatius of Loyola, Stanislaus Kostka, and Saint Cecilia. Further ornamentation of the walls includes carvings depicting the fourteen Stations of the Cross as well as twelve triforiums holding paintings illustrating the Lord's Prayer, the Bread of Life Discourse, and praise to Christ and Mary. On top of the altar, at the eastern end of the church, is a tabernacle. The altar, imported from Germany in 1880, is decorated with statues of Abraham, Peter, Paul, and Melchizedek. The tower is home to two cast iron bells, one measuring in height and wide at the base, and the other measuring in height and in diameter at the base. The bells were produced by Petit & Fritsen in April 1882 and exported from Rotterdam by the Caminada brothers. Both are inscribed with a dedication, in Latin, stating that the bells were donated by a Semarang-born Frenchman named Joseph Andrieux. The bells are further decorated with engraved plants and crosses. When the bells were installed in 1882, they were accompanied by a clock. However, over the years the machinery wore down, and in 1978 it was replaced with a round face decorated with the Christogram IHS (short for \\"Iesus Hominum Salvator\\", meaning \\"Jesus, Saviour of Men\\"). To the north of the church proper is a presbytery, established on 1 August 1890. The two-story building has a high foundation and marble flooring. Both stories have high ceilings, above the floor. Further to the north is the Bintang Laut building, containing offices for the parish council and other administrative needs. On the west side of Ronggo Warsito Street is a convent for the Franciscan nuns, which has a neo-Gothic chapel.

A map of Illinois free And slave counties in 1824 showing shaded counties that were favorable to legalizing slavery in Illinois Map of the Underground Railroad from 1830-1865 including escape routes that went through Illinois Slavery in Illinois existed for more than a century. Illinois did not become a state until 1818, but earlier regional systems of government had already established slavery. France introduced African slavery to the Illinois Country in the early eighteenth century. French and other inhabitants of Illinois continued the practice of owning slaves throughout the Illinois Country's period of British rule (1763-1783), as well as after its transfer to the new United States in 1783 as Illinois County, Virginia. The Northwest Ordinance (1787) banned slavery in Illinois and the rest of the Northwest Territory. Nonetheless, slavery remained a contentious issue, through the period when Illinois was part of the Indiana Territory and the Illinois Territory and some slaves remained in bondage after statehood until their gradual emancipation by the Illinois Supreme Court. Thus the history of slavery in Illinois covers several sometimes overlapping periods: French (c. 1660s-1764); British (c. 1763-1783); Virginia (c. 1778-1785); United States Northwest Territory (1787-1800), Indiana Territory (1800-1809), Illinois Territory (1809-1818) and the State of Illinois (after 1818). During the early decades of statehood, the number of slaves in Illinois dwindled. In the decade before the American Civil War, an anti-Black law was adopted in the state which made it difficult for new Black emigrants to enter or live in Illinois. Near the close of the civil war, Illinois repealed that law and became the first state to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which abolished slavery nationally. Colonial period During the French colonial period of Illinois, Illinois was a part of the region known as the \\"Illinois Country\\", which also loosely encompassed lands that would become the future U.S. states of Indiana, Wisconsin, and Missouri. The Illinois Country was part of New France and was governed by its slavery laws. French settlers first brought African slaves into the Illinois Country from Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti) around 1720 under the terms of the Code Noir, which defined the legal conditions of slavery in the French Empire and restricted the activities of free Negro people. Although older accounts claim that Philip François Renault imported five hundred Negro slaves to the Illinois Country in 1721, it is likely that he imported far fewer. A document \\"from 1720 describes the Jesuits as owning sixteen to eighteen slaves, 'Negroes and Savages .'\\" After an unsuccessful attempt at lead mining, Renault founded St. Philippe, Illinois, in 1723, and used his enslaved people for agricultural purposes to produce crops. The institution of slavery continued after Britain acquired the eastern Illinois Country in 1763 following the French and Indian War. At the time, nine hundred slaves lived in the territory, although some of the French would take at least three hundred with them as they left the future state of Illinois for lands west of the Mississippi River (in future Missouri). United States territory Slavery continued following the American Revolutionary War, when the territory was ceded to the United States. The first legislation against slavery was the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which forbade slavery in the Northwest Territory. However, territorial laws and practices allowed human bondage to continue in various forms. Territorial governors Arthur St. Clair and Charles Willing Byrd supported slavery and did not enforce the ordinance. When the Indiana Territory (which included the future State of Illinois) was split from the Northwest Territory in 1800, residents petitioned the United States Senate to allow slaves. A proposal offered emancipation to Illinois-born male slaves at age thirty-one and female slaves at age twenty-eight. Southern-born slaves were to be slaves for life. No response to the proposal was ever issued. The Illinois Territory, created in 1809, kept the Indiana Territory's Black Code, which restricted free blacks and required them to carry documents to prove their freedom. Slaveowners could keep their workers in bondage by forcing them to sign indentures of very long length (40 to 99 years), threatening them with sale elsewhere if they refused. Furthermore, free black people could be kidnapped and sold in St. Louis or states where such sales were legal. The Illinois Salines, a U.S. government-run salt works near Shawneetown was one of the largest businesses in the Illinois Territory; it exploited between 1,000 and 2,000 slaves hired out from masters in slave states to keep the salt brine kettles continuously boiling. Slavery during statehood While Illinois' first state constitution in 1818 stated that slavery shall not be \\"thereafter introduced\\", slavery was still tolerated in the early years of Illinois statehood, and the constitution did not have a clause forbidding an amendment to allow slavery. However, due to the efforts of a coalition of religious leaders (Morris Birkbeck, Peter Cartwright, James Lemen, and John Mason Peck), publisher Hooper Warren and politicians (especially Edward Coles, Daniel Pope Cook and Risdon Moore), Illinois voters in 1824 rejected a proposal for a new constitutional convention that could have made slavery legal outright. Slavecatchers from Missouri would travel to Illinois either to recapture escaped slaves, or kidnap free blacks for sale into slavery, particularly since Illinois' legislature tightened the Black Code to state that recaptured escaped slaves would have time added to their indentures. The following year a law barred blacks from being witnesses in court cases against whites, then two years later barred blacks from suing for their freedom. In Phoebe v Jay, Judge Samuel D. Lockwood, previously Coles' anti-convention and abolitionist ally, held that the 40-year indenture of Phoebe (entered into in 1814) could be transferred to Joseph Jay's heir, his son William Jay, arguing that the new state's Constitution superseded the anti-slavery provisions of the Northwest Ordinance.Ress, David (2006). Gov. Edward Coles and the Vote to Forbid Slavery in Illinois, 1823–1824. McFarland Publishers. Jefferson, N.C. p. 162. . Despite these laws tolerating de facto slavery, in a series of legal decisions beginning with Cornelius v. Cohen in 1825, the Illinois Supreme Court developed a jurisprudence to gradually emancipate the enslaved people of Illinois. In that first case, the justices decided that in order for a contract of servitude to be valid, both parties must be in agreement and sign it. In Choisser v. Hargrave, the court decided that indentures would not be enforced unless they complied with all provisions of Illinois law, including that they be registered within 30 days of entering the state. In 1836, the court in Boon v. Juliet held that children of registered slaves brought into the state were free, and could themselves only be indentured until the age of 18 or 21 years (depending on their sex) according to the state's Constitution. In Sarah v. Borders (1843), the court held that if any fraud occurred in the signing of an indenture contract, it was void. Finally, in the 1845 decision, Jarrot v. Jarrot, the court ended tolerance of slavery even for descendants of former French slaves, holding that descendants of slaves born after the 1787 Northwest Ordinance were born free. removed web link 21 Sept 2016 because now an internet marketing site In one of the predecessors of the Dred Scott decision, Moore v. People, 55 U.S. 13 (1852), the Supreme Court of the United States upheld a conviction for harboring a fugitive slave from Missouri, as had the Illinois Supreme Court a few years earlier. Illinois residents participated in the underground railroad for fugitive slaves seeking freedom, with major routes beginning in the Mississippi River towns of Chester, Alton and Quincy, to Chicago, and lesser routes from Cairo to Springfield, Illinois or up the banks of the Wabash River. The Illinois' Constitution of 1848 banned slavery, section 16 of its Declaration of Rights specifying, \\"There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the State, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.\\" Nevertheless, subsequent legislation led to one of the most restrictive Black Code systems in the nation until the American Civil War. The Illinois Black Code of 1853 prohibited any Black persons from outside of the state from staying in the state for more than ten days, subjecting Black emigrants who remain beyond the ten days to arrest, detention, a $50 fine, or deportation. The Code was repealed in early 1865, the same year that the Civil War ended.Bridges, Roger D. The Illinois Black Codes. http://www.lib.niu.edu/1996/iht329602.html At that time, Illinois also became the first state to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which abolished slavery nationally.

Print as one of the most terrifying programs broadcast during radio's Golden Age. It was originally broadcast December 5, 1946.  Plot summary  The plot is presented as a \\"story within a story,\\" framed by a meeting between detective Sam Spade (played by Howard Duff) and a friend who has discovered the manuscript regarding the mysterious house. After a brief introduction, the narrative shifts to the story presented in the manuscript. The story begins a few days before Christmas. James (Robert Taylor) and Ellen (Cathy Lewis), married seven years and having recently relocated to California for the husband's engineering job, move into a hastily finished rental house in a development that was started before the war. Dusty furniture and creaky hinges seem to be the only problems with the place at first glance. But the very night they move in, the two hear inhuman cries in the night, and find blood oozing out from under a closet door they can't open. Fleeing the house in a panic, they return with a pair of policemen, only to discover the closet door is unlocked and the blood has vanished. The following night, Ellen, sleep- walking, attacks James like a crazed animal and bites him savagely, waking with no memory of the attack; then the milkman is discovered with his throat torn out. The narrative concludes with James' indication that he has accepted his fate and is no longer afraid; he knows now what he must do. Just then there's a knock on the door and the inhuman scream is heard again. A newspaper article clipped to the manuscript notes that James killed Ellen with a shotgun before turning the weapon on himself. The episode then returns to the framing story, with Sam Spade discussing the case with his friend. The friend explains the paradox that the manuscript was found in the same house in which the story appears to have taken place, but that at the time the manuscript was found, the house was derelict and unfinished. Impossibly, the story set down in the manuscript appears to have taken place in the house *after* the manuscript was discovered. Spade suggests that this is just a coincidence and leaves. After Spade leaves, his friend returns to his regular occupation -- a rental agent for the housing development. As the story concludes, a young couple comes into his office and asks about renting the house in Cypress canyon. The couple is James and Ellen.

This is a documentary film which explores the impact of cultural identity on the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, where music and song provided a source of inspiration to the freedom fighters and a spiritual bond for the whole emerging nation.  Background  During the Liberation War in 1971, a cultural troupe, named Bangladesh Mukti Shangrami Shilpi Shangstha used to travel to refugee camps and different areas in Mukta Anchal, perform patriotic songs, arrange puppet shows and stage dramas to inspire the freedom fighters and people with the spirit of war.

Crew  * Tareque Masud, director, co-producer * Catherine Masud, co-producer, editor * Lear Levin, Cinematography  Synopsis  In 1971 the people of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) waged a war of liberation against West Pakistan, which ended in December 1971 with the foundation of the country of Bangladesh. The film Muktir Gaan is a special and rear archive of footage of this war. Firstly the footage taken by American filmmaker Lear Levin shot of a group of young musicians and actors who at the time travelled through the country with battle songs and political puppet shows. The film follows the group not only during their performances for refugees and guerillas but also during their travels, which has produced many melancholy pictures. Levin's material is available for the first time thanks to two filmmakers from Bangladesh who, being discontent with the present regime, wanted to remind the Bengal people of the initial motives of the war of liberation: freedom and democracy. The film was screened in Bangladesh where it was a resounding success.  Music  The songs in Muktir Gaan have been sung by various singers of the country. The film also features Brig Gen (retired) Giasuddin Chowdhury, Aminul Haque Badshah and other nameless freedom fighters who fought for liberation of the country. * Bipul Bhattacharjee * Debobroto Chowdhury * Dulal Chandrashil * Laila Khan * Lata Chowdhury * Lubna Marium * Mahmudur Rahman Benu * Shaheen Samad * Sharmin Murshid * Swapan Chowdhury * Tariq Ali See also * Artistic depictions of Bangladesh Liberation War * Independent films of Bangladesh References External links * * Category:1995 films Category:1995 documentary films Category:Bangladeshi films Category:Bangladeshi documentary films Category:Bengali-language films Category:Films based on the Bangladesh Liberation War Category:Films directed by Tareque Masud Category:Films directed by Catherine Masud Category:Films shot in Bangladesh Category:1990s Bengali-language films ","title":"Muktir Gaan"},{"id":"39846435","text":"Vrindavan Railway Station is on the Mathura-Vrindavan link.

Education and working positions Ali H. Chamseddine was born in 1953 in the town of Joun, Lebanon. He received his BSc in Physics from the Lebanese University in July 1973. After receiving a scholarship from the Lebanese University to continue his graduate studies in Physics at Imperial College London, Chamseddine received a Diploma in Physics in June 1974, under the supervision of Tom Kibble. After that, Chamseddine did his PhD in Theoretical Physics at Imperial College London as well, in September 1976, where he studied under supervision of Nobel Prize winner Abdus Salam. Later on, Chamseddine did his post-doctoral studies at the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), and then continued his scientific career at universities including American University of Beirut, CERN, Northeastern University, ETH Zurich, and University of Zurich. Scientific achievements Chamseddine worked for his PhD dissertation on the newly developed field at the time: Supersymmetry. His Thesis, \\"Supersymmetry and higher spin fields\\", which was defended on September 1976, laid the foundation for his work with Peter West “Supergravity as a gauge theory of supersymmetry\\" using the fiber bundle formulation.Chamseddine, A. H., & West, P. C. (1977). Supergravity as a gauge theory of supersymmetry. Nuclear Physics B, 129(1), 39–44. This work is considered to be the most elegant formulation of N=1 Supergravity. In 1980, while at CERN as a Scientific Associate, Chamseddine discovered ten-dimensional supergravity and its compactifications and symmetries in four dimensions.Chamseddine, Ali H. \\"N= 4 supergravity coupled to N= 4 matter and hidden symmetries.\\" Nuclear Physics B 185.2 (1981): 403–415. A year later, Chamseddine moved to Northeastern University, Boston, where he coupled ten-dimensional supergravity to Yang–Mills matter, and at the same time discovered the dual formulation of N=1 Supergravity in ten dimensions.Chamseddine, Ali H. \\"Interacting supergravity in ten dimensions: the role of the six-index gauge field.\\" Physical Review D 24.12 (1981): 3065. This model turned out to be the low energy limit of the heterotic superstring.Green, Michael B., John H. Schwarz, and Edward Witten. Superstring theory: volume 2, loop amplitudes, anomalies and phenomenology. Cambridge university press, 2012. Chamseddine's most important achievement in the field is the one he did in 1982 in collaboration with Richard Arnowitt and Pran Nath at Northeastern University. They constructed the most general coupling of the supersymmetric standard model to supergravity, making the supersymmetry a local symmetry, and employing the super Higgs mechanism and developing the rules of tensor calculus.Nath, Pran, A. H. Chamseddine, and R. Arnowitt. \\"Applied N= 1 supergravity.\\" (1983). They then constructed the minimally supergravity standard model mSUGRA, which produces a supersymmetric standard model with spontaneous breaking with only four parameters and one sign instead of the more than 130 parameters that were used before.Dimopoulos, Savas, and Howard Georgi. \\"Softly broken supersymmetry and SU (5).\\" Nuclear Physics B 193.1 (1981): 150–162. This work showed that the breaking of supersymmetry is a pure gravitational effect, which occurs at the Planckian scale and thus induces the breaking of electroweak symmetry. Their paper \\"Locally supersymmetric grand unification\\"Chamseddine, Ali H., Ro Arnowitt, and Pran Nath. \\"Locally supersymmetric grand unification.\\" Physical Review Letters 49.14 (1982): 970. is a highly cited paper and it is the model used by experimentalists at the LHC in the search for supersymmetry.Baer, Howard, et al. \\"Post-LHC7 fine-tuning in the minimal supergravity/CMSSM model with a 125 GeV Higgs boson.\\" Physical Review D 87.3 (2013): 035017. In 1992, Chamseddine started to work on a quantum theory of gravity, using the newly developed field of non-commutative geometry, which was founded by Alain Connes, as a suitable possibility. Together with Jürg Fröhlich and G. Felder, Chamseddine developed the structures needed to define Riemannian noncommutative geometry (metric, connection and curvature) by applying this method to a two-sheeted space.Chamseddine, Ali H., Giovanni Felder, and J. Fröhlich. \\"Gravity in non- commutative geometry.\\" Communications in Mathematical Physics 155.1 (1993): 205–217. Later on, in 1996, Chamseddine started collaborating with Alain Connes that continues to the present day. They discovered the \\"Spectral action principle\\",Chamseddine, Ali H., and Alain Connes. \\"The spectral action principle.\\" Communications in Mathematical Physics 186.3 (1997): 731–750. which is a statement that the spectrum of the Dirac operator defining the noncommutative space is geometric invariant. Using this principle, Chamseddine and Connes determined that our space-time has a hidden discrete structure tensored to the visible four-dimensional continuous manifold. This principle, with the help of non-commutative geometry, determines all the fundamental fields and their dynamics. The surprise is that the resulting model was nothing but the Standard Model of particle physics with all its symmetries and fields, including the Higgs field as the gauge field along discrete directions as well as the phenomena of spontaneous symmetry breaking. The fermions come out with the correct representation, and their number is predicted to be 16 per familyChamseddine, Ali H., and Alain Connes. \\"Noncommutative geometry as a framework for unification of all fundamental interactions including gravity. Part I.\\" Fortschritte der Physik 58.6 (2010): 553–600. The advantage of noncommutative geometry is that it provides a new paradigm of geometric space expressed in the language of quantum mechanics where operators replace coordinates. The new approach is in line with Albert Einstein's view where general relativity resulted from the geometry of curved manifolds. In 2010, Chamseddine and Connes noticed that the model has one new scalar field, not present in the Standard Model, which is responsible for the small neutrino masses.Chamseddine, Ali H., and Alain Connes. \\"Resilience of the spectral standard model.\\" Journal of High Energy Physics 2012.9 (2012): 1–11. After the discovery of the Higgs particle, which is known not to be consistent with extending the Higgs coupling to very high energies, it was found that this new scalar field is exactly what is needed and cures the stability problem of the Standard Model.Elias-Miró, Joan, et al. \\"Stabilization of the electroweak vacuum by a scalar threshold effect.\\" Journal of High Energy Physics 2012.6 (2012): 1–19. In recent work, Chamseddine, Alain Connes and Viatcheslav Mukhanov, discovered a generalization of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation for geometry where the Dirac operator takes the role of momenta and the coordinates, tensored with Clifford algebra, serve as maps from the manifold to a sphere with the same dimension.Chamseddine, Ali H., Alain Connes, and Viatcheslav Mukhanov. \\"Quanta of Geometry.\\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1409.2471 (2014).

Clarke participated in film, television, radio and other media in a number of different ways. (Note: in media, in this article, does not include his published writings.) In film =Screenplay author= Clarke is most famously known as co-author, along with Stanley Kubrick, of the screenplay for the film 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), widely considered to be one of the most influential films of all time.  2001: A Space Odyssey  Clarke's venture into film was the Stanley Kubrick directed 2001: A Space Odyssey. Kubrick and Clarke had met in New York City in 1964 to discuss the possibility of a collaborative film project. As the idea developed, they decided to loosely base the story on Clarke's short story, The Sentinel, written in 1948. Originally, Clarke was going to write the screenplay for the film, but Kubrick suggested during one of their brainstorming meetings that before beginning on the actual script, they should let their imaginations soar free by writing a novel first, on which they would base the film. (See: 2001: A Space Odyssey.) \\"This is more or less the way it worked out, though toward the end, novel and screenplay were being written simultaneously, with feedback in both directions. Thus I rewrote some sections after seeing the movie rushes—a rather expensive method of literary creation, which few other authors can have enjoyed.\\" The novel ended up being published a few months after the release of the movie. Due to the hectic schedule of the film's production, Kubrick and Clarke had difficulty collaborating on the book. Clarke completed a draft of the novel at the end of 1964 with the plan to publish in 1965 in advance of the film's release in 1966. After many delays the film was released in the spring of 1968, before the book was completed. The book was credited to Clarke alone. Clarke later complained that this had the effect of making the book into a novelisation, that Kubrick had manipulated circumstances to downplay Clarke's authorship. For these and other reasons, the details of the story differ slightly from the book to the movie. The film contains little explanation for the events taking place. Clarke, on the other hand, wrote thorough explanations of \\"cause and effect\\" for the events in the novel. James Randi later recounted that upon seeing the premiere of 2001 for the first time, Clarke left the theatre in tears, at the intermission, after having watched an eleven-minute scene (which did not make it into general release) where an astronaut is doing nothing more than jogging inside the spaceship, which was Kubrick's idea of showing the audience how boring space travels could be. Clarke shared a 1969 Academy Award nomination with Stanley Kubrick in the category Best Writing, Story and Screenplay – Written Directly for the Screen for 2001: A Space Odyssey.Arthur C. Clarke – Awards In 1972, Clarke published The Lost Worlds of 2001, which included his accounts of the production, and alternate versions, of key scenes. The \\"special edition\\" of the novel A Space Odyssey (released in 1999) contains an introduction by Clarke in which he documents the events leading to the release of the novel and film. 2010: The Year We Make Contact In 1982 Clarke continued the 2001 epic with a sequel, 2010: Odyssey Two. This novel was also made into a film, 2010, directed by Peter Hyams for release in 1984. Because of the political environment in America in the 1980s, the film presents a Cold War theme, with the looming tensions of nuclear warfare not featured in the novel. The film was not considered to be as revolutionary or artistic as 2001, but the reviews were still positive. Clarke's email correspondence with Hyams was published in 1984.Arthur C. Clarke and Peter Hyams. The Odyssey File. Ballantine Books, 1984.Excerpt from The Odyssey File. Titled The Odyssey File: The Making of 2010, and co-authored with Hyams, it illustrates his fascination with the then-pioneering medium of email and its use for them to communicate on an almost daily basis at the time of planning and production of the film while living on opposite sides of the world. The book also included Clarke's personal list of the best science-fiction films ever made. Clarke also appeared in the film himself (see below). Rendezvous with Rama Clarke's award-winning novel Rendezvous with Rama (1972) was optioned for filmmaking decades ago, but this motion picture is in \\"development hell\\" as of 2012. In the early 2000s, the actor Morgan Freeman expressed his desire to produce a movie based on Rendezvous with Rama. After a drawn-out development process – which Freeman attributed to difficulties in getting financing – it appeared that in 2003 this project might be proceeding, but this is very dubious. The film was to be produced by Freeman's production company, Revelations Entertainment, and David Fincher has been touted on Revelations' Rama web page as far back as 2001 as the film's director. After years of no progress, Fincher stated in an interview in late 2007 (in which he also credited the novel as being influential on the films Alien and Star Trek: The Motion Picture) that he is still attached to helm. Revelations indicated that Stel Pavlou had written the adaptation. In late 2008, Fincher stated the movie is unlikely to be made. \\"It looks like it's not going to happen. There's no script and as you know, Morgan Freeman's not in the best of health right now. We've been trying to do it but it's probably not going to happen.\\" However, in 2010 it was announced that the film was still planned for future production and both Freeman and Fincher mentioned it as still needing a worthy script. =Other= The 1998 film Deep Impact originated as a joint adaptation of Clarke's 1993 novel The Hammer of God and remake of the 1951 film When Worlds Collide, and the project was originally acknowledged as such, although the finished film did not acknowledge any of its sources as it was judged as being different enough to not require it. =Appearances= Clarke appeared in 2010, first as the man feeding the pigeons while Dr. Heywood Floyd is engaged in a conversation in front of the White House. Later, in the hospital scene with David Bowman's mother, an image of the cover of Time portrays Clarke as the American President and Kubrick as the Soviet Premier. In 1994, Clarke appeared in a science fiction film; he portrayed himself in the telefilm Without Warning, an American production about an apocalyptic alien first contact scenario presented in the form of a faux newscast. In television =Series host= In the 1980s Clarke became well known to many for his television programmes investigating paranormal phenomena Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World (1980), Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious Universe (1985) and Arthur C. Clarke's World of Strange Powers (1994), enough to be parodied in an episode of The Goodies in which his show is cancelled after it is claimed he does not exist. =TV commentator= Following the 1968 release of 2001, Clarke became much in demand as a commentator on science and technology, especially at the time of the Apollo space program. The fame of 2001 was enough to get the Command Module of the Apollo 13 craft named \\"Odyssey\\". In 1988, Stephen Hawking, Arthur C. Clarke and Carl Sagan were interviewed in God, the Universe and Everything Else. They discuss the Big Bang theory, God and the possibility of extraterrestrial life. =Television adaptations= The first of Clarke's works to be adapted for television was \\"All The Time In The World\\" which he adapted himself as an episode of the American Tales of Tomorrow series in 1952. Clarke's short story \\"The Star\\" was adapted for television in 1985 as a segment of the revival of The Twilight Zone. Clarke's short story \\"Breaking Strain\\" was adapted as the 1995 TV movie Trapped In Space. The 2002 Futurama episode \\"Godfellas\\" was partially inspired by Clarke's short story \\"The Nine Billion Names of God\\".Cook, Lucius (April 26, 2004).

Retrieved on July 2, 2007 In 2013, the SyFy Channel announced they were producing a six-hour miniseries of Clarke's novel Childhood's End, which aired in 2015. In radio In a 1974 taped interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the interviewer asked Clarke how he believed the computer would change the future for the everyday person, and what life would be like around the year 2001. Clarke accurately predicted many things that became reality—including online banking, online shopping, and other now commonplace things. Responding to a question about how the interviewer's son's life would be different, Clark responded: \\"[H]e will have, in his own house, not a computer as big as this, [points to nearby computer], but at least, a console through which he can talk, through his local computer and get all the information he needs, for his everyday life, like his bank statements, his theater reservations, all the information you need in the course of living in our complex modern society, this will be in a compact form in his own house ... and he will take it as much for granted as we take the telephone.\\"Arthur C.

In music In 1994 Mike Oldfield recorded an album called The Songs of Distant Earth, based on Clarke's novel of the same name. In games In 1984 a text adventure computer game with pictures, based on Clarke's 1973 novel Rendezvous with Rama, was made by Trillium (later known as Telarium).

Etimološki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Založba ZRC, p. 149. History Gradec started developing as a settlement after 1849, when the railroad was built. In 1885 a cotton mill with 3,250 spools was established by Julius Schwarz and Eugen Zublin. After this, other workshops were built, and during the interwar period large residential units were built, creating the neighborhood known as Na stavbah (literally, 'by the buildings'). Gradec was annexed by Litija in 1955, ending its existence as a separate settlement.Spremembe naselij 1948–95. 1996. Database. Ljubljana: Geografski inštitut ZRC SAZU, DZS. Ribče Castle Ribče Castle () stood above the railway station in the settlement. The castle was built at the end of the 16th century. Its many owners included Johann Balthasar von Burgstall from Krupa, and members of the Wutalitsch, von Scharffeneck, Graffenweger, von Coppini, Moshacher, Ursini-Blagay, von Wolkensberg, and Auersperg families.Gradovi v Sloveniji: Ribče Notable people Notable people that were born or lived in Gradec include: *Janko Vrančič (1889–1959), technical writer and lawyer \\"Vrančič Janko\\".

An accomplished Hawaiian composer, she composed the popular Hawaiian love song Sanoe with Queen Liliʻuokalani, which was about a love affair in the Hawaiian royal court in the 1870s.  Early life and family  Born on December 24, 1851, in the city of Honolulu, on the island of Oahu, she was the daughter of William Keolaloa Kahānui Sumner, an ali‘i of partial Hawaiian descent, and his punalua (two or more spouses) partner Haa Maore aka Mauli Tehuiari‘i, a Tahitian princess and the sister of Sumner's lawful wife Manaiula Tehuiari‘i. She was of Hawaiian, Tahitian and English descent. Her father High Chief William K. K. Sumner (1816–1885) was the eldest son of High Chiefess Keakua‘aihue Kanealai Hua and the British Captain William Sumner (1786–1847), of Northampton. Captain Sumner arrived in Hawaii in 1807 as a cabin boy; initially befriending Kauai's king Kaumualiʻi, he later became a naval captain under King Kamehameha I, who united the Hawaiian Islands in 1810. Sumner captained the government schooner Waverly and deported the party of Catholic missionaries led by Alexis Bachelot and Patrick Short in 1831. Hua, her paternal grandmother, was the cousin and hānai (adoptive) sister of High Chiefess Ahia Beckley, wife of Captain George Charles Beckley, who was one of the reputed designers of the Flag of Hawaii. Related to the Kamehamehas through Uminuikuka‘ailani, her grandmother descended from the famous twins Kahānui and Kaha‘opulani, the Kohala chiefs who reared Kamehameha during his infancy. Elizabeth attended Oahu College from 1864 to 1865. Elizabethʻs elder paternal half-sister was Nancy Wahinekapu Sumner (1839–1895); their mothers were sisters. Their family's ancestry and connection to the ruling families of Hawaii and Tahiti allowed the two sisters to associate with many members of the royal family of Hawaii. Nancy was a prominent lady of the court during the reigns of King Kamehameha IV and King Kamehameha V, serving as a lady-in-waiting to Queen Emma and close friend to Princess Victoria Kamāmalu. Elizabeth's elder maternal half-sister Sarah Chapman Weed, the daughter of Princess Mauli and William Chapman, was an associate of Queen Emma. Sarah had an antagonistic relation with Nancy and a verbal conflict between them started a rift in the two sides of the family. This family dispute resulted in Mauli's and Sarah's' eviction from their home on Sumner Island (a former islet in Pearl Harbor) by Nancy's mother Manaiula. Subsequently, Elizabeth decided to renounce her Sumner surname in favor of Chapman.  Compositions  Elizabeth Keawepoʻoole Sumner (seated, far right) with Liliʻuokalani and Likelike, 1880 Elizabeth became the lady-in-waiting of Princess Likelike, befriending her and her elder sister Princess Liliʻuokalani. Both princesses were the royal sisters of the reigning King Kalākaua who had won the royal election of 1874 against Queen Emma. Liliʻuokalani, who would later reign as the last queen of Hawaii, called Elizabeth by the name of Lizzie. Also known as Kapeka, she collaborated with Liliʻuokalani and wrote several songs under this name. Their best known composition was Sanoe, which along with Aloha ʻOe were amongst Liliʻuokalani most classic works. This romantic mele (song) described a secret love affair in the court of King Kalākaua in the 1870s involving an unknown man and a married lady at the royal court given the pseudonym \\"Sanoe,\\" meaning \\"the fog or mist of the mountaintop,\\". The identity of the lady has been popularly ascribed to Kapeka herself or Likelike, although the lyrics do not disclose the woman's identity. Other songs credited to Elizabeth include Penei No, Pua Ani Ani, and Ka Lei Na Ke Aloha with most of her work still in private hands. Beside being an accomplished composer, she was expert in the traditional chants of Ancient Hawaii. She composed a kanikau (death chant) for her half- sister after Nancy's death from asthma on January 10, 1895.  Marriages and children  = Marriage to Achuck = Elizabeth married a wealthy Chinese businessman Mr. Achuck (1832–1877). Achuck was the adopted, Hawaiianized name of Qʻing Ming Qwai, who had immigrated in 1849 from Zhongshan in the Guangdong province of China. He was the friend and business partner of Chun Afong, Hawaii's first Chinese millionaire, with whom he co-owned Afong & Achuck, a chain of stores formed in 1865, which sold Oriental novelties to Chinese residents and the upper echelon of Honolulu society. Although not the first, the interracial marriage of a Hawaiian high chiefess to a Chinese businessman was considered unconventional at best. Her father disproved of the union but \\"found solace in the fact that the 'Chinaman' was a wealthy one.\\" Considered a beauty of the royal court, Elizabeth had numerous prominent suitors and marriage proposals. Queen Emma, a political rival to the Kalākaua family and a friend of her sister Nancy, referred to Elizabethʻs husband as the \\"pigtail suitor Achuck.\\" Commenting on Achuck's previous two marriages, one which was still legal, she stated in a letter, \\"Fancy spending a lifetime with a heathen Chinese who has the diversion of two wives at home to whom he must now and again go to spend a time with.\\" Achuck's first wife was still alive in China while he had also previously contracted a marriage with a Hawaiian girl named Kamaua. Kamaua was twelve years old at the time of her marriage to Achuck and was a student of Protestant missionary Reverend Lowell Smith of the Kaumakapili Church, who orchestrated the match. Achuck later dissolved the union with Kamaua on the charges of adultery. In a ceremony presided by the Reverend Father Herman Koeckemann, Achuck and Elizabeth were married on the evening of July 3, 1872, at the residence of Princess Likelike and her husband Archibald Scott Cleghorn in Honolulu. Princess Liliʻuokalani and her husband John Dominis were their witnesses. Because of the family dispute, Elizabeth married under the surname of Chapman, using the name of her mother's second husband instead of her Sumner surname. With Achuck, she had two known daughters. The eldest named Anastasia Nalanialua Achuck (1874–1947), married James Kenneth Olds, Jr. in 1895, and the younger daughter was named Mary Achuck, who married H. G. Morse and later William Kaea Sproule. = Marriage to Lapana = Daughter Mauli Keawepoʻoole (1885–1899) After Achuck's death, Elizabeth remarried to a Hawaiian man named Lapana Keawepoʻoole, a painter who later became a police officer and turnkey at Oʻahu prison.1900 United States Census1910 United States Census; Keawepoʻoole was the shortened version of Keawepoʻooleinamoku, the name of Lapanaʻs grandmother, High Chiefess Keawepoʻooleinamoku of Molokai and Lanaʻi. Another variation often used Keawepoʻoʻole literally means \\"headless Keawe.\\" The name has also been often spelled Keawepoʻole or Keawepoʻoolenamoku. Lapana and Elizabeth had one daughter Mauli Keawepoʻoole, who had been a student at the Kamehameha Girls' School before dying on May 28, 1899 from cephalitis. After suffering from diabetic complications for four months, Elizabeth died in Honolulu at her daughter's residence on Liliha street on February 22, 1911. She was sixty years old at the time of her death. Her funeral service was held at the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace and was attended by ladies of the Kaʻahumanu Society. She was buried in an unmarked grave at Honolulu Catholic Cemetery, also known as the King Street Catholic Cemetery where other members of the Sumner family including her father are also buried.

He is formerly Director of Animal Sentience with the Humane Society Institute for Science and Policy, and Department Chair for Animal Studies with Humane Society University,Humane Society University in Washington, DC. He lectures internationally on animal behavior and the human-animal relationship. He also served as Associate Editor of the journal Animal Sentience from 2015 to 2019. Early life and education Balcombe was born in Hornchurch, England. He grew up in New Zealand and Canada before settling in the United States in 1987. Balcombe earned a Bachelor of Science degree in biology in 1983 from York University in Toronto, then a Master of Science in biology from Carleton University in Ottawa in 1987. In 1991, he completed a Ph.D in ethology (animal behavior) at the University of Tennessee, where he studied mother-pup vocal communication in the Mexican free-tailed bat.  Career  Balcombe has worked for several animal protection organizations, including The Humane Society of the United States, Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. He also worked as a research coordinator and grant writer for Immersion Medical, a for-profit company that makes virtual reality training simulators for minimally-invasive surgery.. In addition to writing books, Jonathan currently does professional editing for aspiring and established authors. He also teaches a course in animal sentience for the Viridis Graduate Institute. Writing Balcombe's first book, The Use of Animals in Higher Education: Problems, Alternatives, and Recommendations, was published by Humane Society Press in 2000. His trade book, Pleasurable Kingdom: Animals and the Nature of Feeling Good, was released by Macmillan in 2006. The book details Balcombe's positions on the sentience of animals, and the existence of pleasure seeking behavior, in contrast with the behavioralist mainstream, which rejects anthropomorphism of animals. Deutschlandradio called the book a \\"convincing and a fun read.\\" In 2010, Balcombe published Second Nature: The Inner Lives of Animals, in which he surveys recent scientific discoveries about animal cognition, emotion, and virtue, and aims to \\"protest against what he sees as an unbroken tradition of human cruelty and indifference.\\" The Exultant Ark: A Pictorial Tour of Animal Pleasure was released in 2011 by the University of California Press. Using images of contented animals in their natural environment, Balcombe \\"proves that animals aren’t always engaged in a battle for survival but will frequently do things for nothing more than the feeling of satisfaction.\\" Balcombe disputes the mainstream scientific community's belief that the animal kingdom is an unforgiving struggle for survival. The book briefly broke into the top 100 on Amazon.com following favorable reviews in The New York Times and the New York Post. Balcombe's 2016 book, What A Fish Knows, combines science and story- telling to examine the inner lives of the world's most diverse group of vertebrates. What A Fish Knows has a release date of June 7, 2016, from Scientific American/Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Balcombe has published over 60 scholarly articles and book chapters on various topics, including animal behavior, animal research, animal dissection, medical simulation, and veganism. His essay titled \\"After Meat\\" appears in the 2016 book \\"Impact of Meat Consumption on Health and Environmental Sustainability,\\" edited by Dora Marinova and Talia Raphaely.  Advocacy  Balcombe uses a variety of platforms to advocate for a sea-change in the human-animal relationship. In addition to his books and journal papers, he is a regular speaker at conferences, campuses, public schools and other venues. He is interviewed often in the media, and he has written blogs for Psychology Today, One Green Planet, Secretary of Innovation, and Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine.

He was born at Knaresborough, Yorkshire and died at Leeds, also in Yorkshire. Prentice was a right-handed batsman often used as an opener and a right-arm off-break bowler, used irregularly and often rather expensively. He played a few matches for Yorkshire's second eleven in the Minor Counties Championship in 1931. But with competition for places in Yorkshire's first eleven very stiff, he left to join Leicestershire, where he was not qualified for County Championship games until 1935. From then on until the end of the 1949 season he was a regular in the Leicestershire first team. Pre-war cricket Not yet qualified, Prentice had made his first-class debut in Leicestershire's match against Oxford University in 1934, batting at No 7 in the first innings, when he made 39, but opening in the second innings. He was picked for the first game of the 1935 season and kept his place through what Wisden Cricketers' Almanack called \\"the most successful season in the history of the club\\". Prentice himself had a modest record, with 713 runs at an average of 16.20, and only two scores of more than 50. But, Wisden noted, \\"possessed of a solid defence, (he) often played an invaluable innings in a crisis\\". His record improved to 989 runs and an average of 24.12 in 1936, but Wisden was less impressed: \\"Prentice showed extremely sound defence, but did not appear to have many strokes at his command,\\" it wrote, noting also that, with the likely unavailability of Alan Shipman in 1937, \\"efforts were made to convert Prentice into an opening batsman\\". Prentice was awarded his county cap in 1936. The move to open the innings was an immediate success: in 1937, Prentice scored 1506 runs at an average of 32.73 and of his opening partnership with Les Berry Wisden wrote that \\"with the exception perhaps of Yorkshire and Sussex no other county possessed such consistent opening batsmen\\". It added: \\"Prentice confirmed all the high opinions formed of him. Using more strokes than previously, he also retained his solid defence and proved an extremely difficult batsman to dislodge.\\" In the first match of the season, Prentice made his first first-class century, an innings of 163 against Hampshire. He followed that with 127 in the second game, against Northamptonshire, and in both games he shared a century opening partnership with Berry. He made four centuries in the season. In addition, because of a shortage of spin bowlers, he bowled more than 400 overs of off-spin, and though his 24 wickets cost more than 55 runs apiece, against Lancashire he took five wickets for 82 runs, his first five-wicket return, though the Lancastrians totalled 469 in their only innings of the match. He was less prolific in both 1938 and 1939, failing to score 1000 runs in either season and missing a few matches through injury in each of them. Post-war cricket Prentice returned to Leicestershire after the Second World War, although he was thereafter handicapped to a degree by a bad fracture of the wrist he had sustained on war service. In a rather more mobile batting order, with competition for the opening places, Prentice often batted at No 3 in the first four post-war seasons, but passed 1000 runs in each of them. He bowled less after the war, and scarcely at all after 1947, but in 1946, despite the presence in the Leicestershire attack of Vic Jackson and Jack Walsh, he took five Gloucestershire wickets for 46 runs, and these were the best figures of his career. The 1948 and 1949 seasons were the best of his career as a batsman. In 1948, he scored 1328 runs at an average of 36.88 and headed the Leicestershire batting averages for the first and only time. His figures in 1949 were even more impressive – 1742 runs and an average of 38.71 – though he was beaten in the county's averages by Berry, who had been out of form in 1948. The 1949 record included five centuries before the end of June and the five included an innings of 191 against Nottinghamshire which was the highest of his career. Prentice was granted a testimonial in 1950, but had a poor season with bat, losing his place in the team mid-season and regaining it only at the end of the year. At the end of the 1950 season, he retired from full- time cricket to go into business; he appeared in just four matches in 1951, playing as an amateur, and those were the last games of his career.

C. Escher, in which \\"strings of fish shoot up like rockets from infinitely far away\\" and then \\"fall back again whence they came\\".Escher, as quoted by . It is one of a series of four woodcuts by Escher depicting ideas from hyperbolic geometry. Dutch physicist and mathematician Bruno Ernst called it \\"the best of the four\\".. Inspiration The (6,4,2) triangular hyperbolic tiling that inspired Escher Escher became interested in tessellations of the plane after a 1936 visit to the Alhambra in Granada, Spain,.. and from the time of his 1937 artwork Metamorphosis I he had begun incorporating tessellated human and animal figures into his artworks. In a 1958 letter from Escher to H. S. M. Coxeter, Escher wrote that he was inspired to make his Circle Limit series by a figure in Coxeter's article \\"Crystal Symmetry and its Generalizations\\". Coxeter's figure depicts a tessellation of the hyperbolic plane by right triangles with angles of 30°, 45°, and 90°; triangles with these angles are possible in hyperbolic geometry but not in Euclidean geometry. This tessellation may be interpreted as depicting the lines of reflection and fundamental domains of the (6,4,2) triangle group.Coxeter expanded on the mathematics of triangle group tessellations, including this one in . An elementary analysis of Coxeter's figure, as Escher might have understood it, is given by .. Geometry The alternated octagonal tiling, a hyperbolic tiling of squares and equilateral triangles, overlaid on Escher's image Escher seems to have believed that the white curves of his woodcut, which bisect the fish, represent hyperbolic lines in the Poincaré disk model of the hyperbolic plane, in which the whole hyperbolic plane is modeled as a disk in the Euclidean plane, and hyperbolic lines are modeled as circular arcs perpendicular to the disk boundary. Indeed, Escher wrote that the fish move \\"perpendicularly to the boundary\\". However, as Coxeter demonstrated, there is no hyperbolic arrangement of lines whose faces are alternately squares and equilateral triangles, as the figure depicts. Rather, the white curves are hypercycles that meet the boundary circle at angles of approximately 80°. The symmetry axes of the triangles and squares that lie between the white lines are true hyperbolic lines. The squares and triangles of the woodcut closely resemble the alternated octagonal tiling of the hyperbolic plane, which also features squares and triangles meeting in the same incidence pattern. However, the precise geometry of these shapes is not the same. In the alternated octagonal tiling, the sides of the squares and triangles are hyperbolically straight line segments, which do not link up in smooth curves; instead they form polygonal chains with corners. In Escher's woodcut, the sides of the squares and triangles are formed by arcs of hypercycles, which are not straight in hyperbolic geometry, but which connect smoothly to each other without corners. The points at the centers of the squares, where four fish meet at their fins, form the vertices of an order-8 triangular tiling, while the points where three fish fins meet and the points where three white lines cross together form the vertices of its dual, the octagonal tiling. Similar tessellations by lines of fish may be constructed for other hyperbolic tilings formed by polygons other than triangles and squares, or with more than three white curves at each crossing.. Euclidean coordinates of circles containing the three most prominent white curves in the woodcut may be obtained by calculations in the field of rational numbers extended by the square roots of two and three.. Symmetry Viewed as a pattern, ignoring the colors of the fish, in the hyperbolic plane, the woodcut has three-fold and four-fold rotational symmetry at the centers of its triangles and squares, respectively, and order-three dihedral symmetry (the symmetry of an equilateral triangle) at the points where the white curves cross. In John Conway's orbifold notation, this set of symmetries is denoted 433. Each fish provides a fundamental region for this symmetry group. Contrary to appearances, the fish do not have bilateral symmetry: the white curves of the drawing are not axes of reflection symmetry.. Conway wrote that \\"The work Circle Limit III is equally intriguing\\" (in comparison to Circle Limit IV, which has a different symmetry group), and uses is it as an example of this symmetry group.. Paper presented to the 8th International Conference on Geometry, Nahsholim (Israel), March 7–14, 1999. For example, the angle at the back of the right fin is 90° (where four fins meet), but at the back of the much smaller left fin it is 120° (where three fins meet). Printing details The fish in Circle Limit III are depicted in four colors, allowing each string of fish to have a single color and each two adjacent fish to have different colors. Together with the black ink used to outline the fish, the overall woodcut has five colors. It is printed from five wood blocks, each of which provides one of the colors within a quarter of the disk, for a total of 20 impressions. The diameter of the outer circle, as printed, is ..

Its niche market is the Turkish emigrant population in northern Europe and the bank is jointly owned by a Turkish Halk Bankası and HCBG Holding BV. The bank conducts its activities through locations in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, and Turkey. History DHB Bank was established as a commercial bank under Dutch law on 30 December 1992. Starting its operations with NLG 17.8 million equity (EUR equivalent 8.1 million) and NLG 18.2 million asset size (EUR equivalent 8.3 million), the bank grew to a become a fully fledged commercial bank with an equity of EUR 241.8 million and asset size of 1,826.9 million at the end of 2017. With its head office in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, DHB Bank has a main branch in Düsseldorf, a main branch in Brussels (and 3 sub-branches in Liege, Antwerp and Charleroi) and a representative office in Istanbul. On 1 August 2003 the bank acquired Disbank's Dutch subsidiary Dısbank Nederland. In the second half of 2008, DHB Bank acquired a 66.65% stake in Export & Credit Bank Inc, Skopje (EC Bank), which was sold to Turkey Halk Bankası in the second quarter of 2011. Activities DHB Bank's activities are anchored in traditional commercial banking, based primarily on retail funding (and wholesale funding to a certain extent) and mainly wholesale asset generation (again relatively small retail asset generation). DHB Bank's business model and revenue stream fully rely on real banking transactions, and there is no reliance on any kind of speculative income. Therefore, the bank tries to minimize the market risk by avoiding FX position or interest rate position, and derivative transactions are mainly done for assets and liabilities hedging purposes. The bank conducts its activities through the executional authorities and responsibilities of the Managing Board (MB), under the supervision of the Supervisory Board (SB), and cascades these down throughout the organization founded on different building blocks (i.e. departments and functions). DHB Bank's retail operations consist of retail deposits and consumer loans. Retail deposits are collected from Germany and the Netherlands via Internet and call centre channels. On the assets side, wholesale banking is the foremost revenue generation source for DHB Bank. The bank's wholesale asset generation activities are centralized at the head office in Rotterdam. Wholesale asset generation activities comprise primarily placements in the form of corporate loans, syndications, to an extent bilateral loan to banks, and securities investments. Geographical diversity is an essential feature of DHB Bank's activities on the asset side with exposures primarily in the European Economic Area (EEA).

Four years later he attended the 2008 Beijing Paralympic Games, where the triple jump was confirmed to be his best discipline, to the detriment of the 200 m sprint. This change was providential, because it enabled him to hang his first Paralympic medal, a bronze, with his eyes on the track at that time, his guide Raul Sabaté. In London 2012 he completed his third consecutive Games, participating in four disciplines and getting together with his current guide Enric Martín, two fifth places in the final triple jump (12,19m) and length (6,08m) as best records, and an eleventh place in the 100m which is his best so far (11,79s) and a record of Spain in the semifinals of the 4x100m relay with a time of 43,26s. = IPC World Championship = His first participation was in Quebec 2003, achieving a fourth position in the long jump for best performance.

But its international explosion came two years later, in the championship of Bialastok (Polonia 2001), which was proclaimed runner-up in the 100 meters and the 4x100 relay. Two years later, in Assen 2003, he repeats performance with two new bronze medals in the long jump (6,06m) and 4x100 respectively, becoming one of the best European sprinters and jumpers and endorsing his status in the championships of Espoo (Finlandia 2005) where, in addition to greatly improving his brand in the length, he proclaims runner-up with a record of 6,19m and brushes the podium in the final of the 100 meters.

In his sixth appearance in a European Championships, Swansea (Wales 2014), he returns to the podium getting his ninth continental medal, bronze in the long jump with a mark of 5,93m which puts the icing on the cake of a great 2014 when he wins back the crown of Spain as a champion in the 100 meter sprint in 2012 and becomes a national runner-up in the long jump.  Medal Template  He competed in the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens, Greece, the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, China where he was the third best athlete in the triple jump.

The stairway to CSP  Sustainable profitability can be achieved through a stairway with four steps, each step part of a value chain by production, coworkers, customers and brands. Through this process, corporates can gain a larger overall perspective on their business. That means a new holistic approach where economic, human beings, and the environment are interrelated to make a long-term sustainable profitability. This creates an ambiance of a win-win-situation for all parts that’s involved. = Step 1 - The product = Raw material for a profitable and sustainable business. The first step towards achieving CSP is to study and analyze the product or the service and see how it can be made more sustainable and profitable. The fundamentals of CSP entail analyzing what the product consists of: components such as working conditions, raw material and environmental impact. The study requires close collaboration with suppliers and allows companies to build a solid foundation in the effort towards a more sustainable profitability. Environmental measures can result in savings and an increased income. (CSP). Energy efficiency, use of recycled materials, minimizing of material waste, and engaged and healthy employees are direct cost saving actions. As a business it is important to focus on the part of the product or the service process that needs attention and invest with the goal of shaping a more sustainable business. = Step 2 - The employees = The employees are the ambassadors to maintain sustainable profitability. CSP also addresses how companies can attract motivated and engaged employees that work towards increasing business developments. Young graduates looking for jobs are now evaluating companies for both its CSR values and business environment. Therefore, it is important for companies to strive to become a CSP-oriented company, where the leadership strives for ever-improving agreements, policies and values. Companies are facing a great challenge to implement CSP in their operations and communicating changes internally and externally. Profitability comes when employees feel more engaged with their work. This in turn leads to better performance and efficiency, an important factor for companies to who want to maintain an increasing level of profitability. = Step 3 - The customers = The help to sustainable profitability. Customers demand an increasing amount of products and services that are socially and environmentally responsible. This fact emphasizes the skill of learning to listen and respond to consumers' and investors' requirements, both of whom are crucial to the profitability of the company. We live in a tough business environment where gaining and retaining customers can be difficult. Many companies understand that solid profitability lies in sustainable development, and in order to keep their own CSR values intact, they must consider the implications of working with other companies that do not possess the same values. = Step 4 - The brand = The brand is a yardstick for sustainable profitability. The fourth step to reach sustainable profitability is to add and communicate the positive values that social- and environmental responsibility brings. Without communicating what companies actually are doing for both society and the environment, stakeholders miss out on the opportunity to make a conscious choice. Companies can’t rely simply on PR or marketing to boost their brand credibility. The information society we live in today requires both credible and transparent forms of communication, as it increasingly becomes easier for consumers and stakeholders to examine whether a company really lives what it preaches.Ryott, Anna, Hotopp, Ulrika (2013). Affärsaktivisten- manifest för lönsam och hållbar business. Ekerlids förlag.  The difference between CSP and CSR  An increasing number of companies are realizing the importance of an orderly and active CSR-orientation as socially, environmentally and economically responsible. It is important both to enhance the brand and to make a difference for people and society. CSP, Corporate sustainable profit probability, is about how companies can make CSR work profitably. If the company sets the CSR-concept in the business strategy, the positive effects will come spontaneously and the CSR course becomes even more sustainable and profitable in the long-run.  Affärsaktivisten, the book  Affärsaktivisten (The business activist), written by Anna Ryott, the former general secretary of the SOS Children Villages in Sweden, is the first book about CSP. Affärsaktivisten is a guide to the new era of probability where sustainability becomes a part of the corporates DNA. The book involves big Swedish business profiles, like Antonia Ax:son Johnson, Micael Dahlén and Alice Bah Kuhnke, that engage in \\"good business\\", in both senses of the term.

Plot On Friday at noon, 54 hours before the wedding, Ted and Lily begin checking into the Farhampton Inn. The man at the front desk (Roger Bart) is condescendingly sympathetic towards Ted when he reveals he is at the wedding alone. Lily learns from Marshall that he missed his earlier flight and heads to the bar intending to drown her sorrows, even paying the bartender, named Linus, to constantly place another drink in her hand once it's empty. Finding out their rooms aren't ready yet, Ted and Lily join Barney, Robin and Barney's brother James for drinks as Barney reveals a curse that was placed on the Stinsons in early nineteenth-century Russia, when two brothers ran over an old Gypsy woman, that would cause all Stinson men to constantly be desperate for sex, but believes the curse to be lifted due to James's successful marriage to Tom. However, when Barney leaves to speak to Marshall on the phone, James reveals that he and Tom are getting divorced due to James cheating on him. Horrified, Robin begs James not to drop the bombshell on Barney that weekend, feeling Barney's positive feelings about marriage come from James' relationship. James reluctantly agrees only for a somewhat intoxicated Lily to accidentally blurt it out anyway (prompting Ted to ban her from any more drinks, which fail due to Linus, the bartender). Barney immediately heads to the front desk and Robin, worried that he's freaking out and thinking about leaving, follows and begs him not to just head to a strip club. Barney promises he isn't, but had actually come to get the keys to James's room which he had prepared specially for him and Tom (including a banner reading 'Love is Awesome' and a life-size erotic cake of two naked men). Barney assures Robin that even if James is getting a divorce he still believes in true love thanks to her and doesn't plan on going anywhere. Back in Minnesota, Marshall speaks to Barney on the phone who encourages him to stop acting so nice but instead get more under- handed as it is the only way he'll make it back in time. Marshall refuses; however, he and Daphne find out that all flights to New York are cancelled due to a storm meaning the only way he'll make it back in time is to rent a car. Daphne throws one of Marshall's bags into a restricted area (something Barney had told Marshall to do) and by the time he retrieves it and makes it to the Rent-a-Car place he finds himself at the back of a long line with Daphne near the front of an adjacent queue. Marshall prays for a miracle, and is dismayed when an old man ends up in charge of his line. The man, amazingly, is actually extremely efficient and Marshall gets ahead of Daphne and snags the last car (even if it is the environmentally unfriendly \\"Monstrosity\\"). However, the Rent-a-Car place doesn't have any child seats for Marvin. Daphne tells Marshall that if he gives her the keys, she can go in the car and buy a child seat. Despite the fact she is almost certainly lying, Marshall not only gives her the keys but also money to buy a car seat. Marshall is confident that being nice has finally paid off. However, after being left waiting for a while realizes that Daphne probably isn't coming back. Just as Marshall is about to give up, Daphne returns with the child seat and the two finally head out for New York. In the bar, Ted asks James how he's coping. James admits that while he's trying to be happy for Barney, he can't help but have a different perspective on weddings now that he knows what comes afterwards isn't always good. The receptionist arrives to tell James his room is ready, and Ted tells him not to give up and promises he won't either. The audience is then shown a flashforward to exactly a year later, as Ted visits the bar again but this time with the Mother (the first time the two are seen together on screen). The two are clearly very much in love, and Ted tells the Mother that he promised himself he would return there with her as he was sitting in the bar. The Mother tells him that he hadn't even met her at that point one year ago. Ted confirms this, but assures her he knew she was just around the corner. In the final scene, Ted is told his room is finally ready only to find it filled with the decorations from James' room much to his dismay. Critical reception Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gave the double-episode premiere of \\"The Locket\\" and \\"Coming Back\\" a B+ rating. Alan Sepinwall of Uproxx also rated the double- episode saying that there was many \\"annoying little things, and a few big ones\\" but one big thing they got absolutely right: That was the Mother. Bill Kuchman of Popculturology gave the second half of the season premiere high marks, saying that watching Ted and The Mother together is \\"what we were promised almost a decade ago, and now we’re finally watching it happen.\\" He also praised the chemistry Cristin Milioti had with Josh Radnor, saying \\"the showrunners appear to have done the impossible\\" with this casting. Max Nicholson of IGN gave the episode an 8.0/10 rating saying it \\"introduced several great subplots, including a scene between Ted and the Mother.\\" References External links * Category:How I Met Your Mother (season 9) episodes Category:2013 American television episodes ","title":"Coming Back (How I Met Your Mother)"},{"id":"39847833","text":"Chinese Journal may refer to *Chinese Medical Journal *Chinese Journal of Physics *Chinese Journal of International Law ","title":"Chinese Journal"},{"id":"39847834","text":"Punjabi language films are produced both in India and Pakistan. * List of Pakistani Punjabi-language films * List of Indian Punjabi films * Category:Lists of films by language ","title":"List of Punjabi-language films"},{"id":"39847859","text":"Mura is a surname.

Symbiosis has also produced a solar eclipse festival in May 2012 at Pyramid Lake of the Paiute Tribe and collaborated in November 2012 near Cairns, Australia with Rainbow Serpent, Mother (Japan) and creators of Glade Festival. Symbiosis Gathering has been called an \\"adult-Disneyland\\", Neverland, and compared to Burning Man, Lightning in a Bottle, Boom Festival, and Rainbow Serpent Festival. The 2017 production has been called \\"the most transcendental event in the known universe\\" and was aligned with the total solar eclipse in Oregon on August 21, 2017. Symbiosis has been called a transformational festival but organizers much prefer to be known as an 'international gathering' that happens to be in the United States. Past locations Symbiosis Gathering was first held at Cutter Scout Camp near the Santa Cruz mountains in 2005, for a crowd of around 800 people and it grew to over 15,000 for the 10 year anniversary in September 2015. The Gathering has been held in a variety of locations including Angels Camp in 2006 and 2007, Camp Mather near Yosemite National Park in 2009, at Pyramid Lake in May 2012 during an annular solar eclipse, and Woodward Reservoir in Oakdale, CA.\\"County supervisors green light a second Symbiosis festival\\" By Ken Carlson. Merced Sun-Star From 2013-2016, Symbiosis Gathering was held on the 2900-acre Woodward Reservoir and has been called the \\"MVP\\", a \\"true gem\\" and \\"the most unique aspect\\". The event is held on a \\"five-nubbed\\" peninsula and has open swimming throughout the weekend. The festival also boasts the most evolved demonstration of Art Boats, which has likely come from the influence of nearby DIY events Burning Man and Maker Faire. Called the \\"jewel of Symbiosis' production\\" was the \\"Swimbiosis\\" stage which saw the sound system pointed out on the water where the dancefloor extended to thousands of people on rafts, makeshift boats, and swimming in the reservoir.  2017 total solar eclipse  The 2017 edition was aligned with the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017 which was the first total solar eclipse seen in the continental U.S. since 1979. The festival was a collaboration between numerous international producers including Bass Coast (CAN), Beloved (US), Envision Festival (CR), Hadra (FR), Noisily (UK), Ometeotl (MX), Origin Festival (SA), Rainbow Serpent (AUS), Re:Birth (JPN), Sonic Bloom (US), and Universo Parallelo (BR). The event was held with seven music stages and over 40 different areas of workshops, large art sculptures, and other displays, which was planned for over 30,000 people. Oregon Eclipse is the largest event of its kind (and the first U.S. event) to offer a ticket only available to be purchased in Bitcoin.  Ethos  The mission statement of Symbiosis declares that the Gathering is a music, art, and conscious lifestyle event and has consistent messaging about community. There are strong participatory elements in many aspects including participants bringing their own art, live painting both on and off stage, and installations that one can touch and climb. Co- founder Bosque Hrbek calls Symbiosis a \\"collaborative experiment\\" and prefers the description of an \\"international gathering\\" as staff includes teams of people who also work on international events such as Rainbow Serpent Festival, Boom Festival, and Brazil's Universo Paralello among others. The producers calling the event a Gathering rather than a festival with the intention that the true value of the event is in people coming together. The theme to the 2016 edition is Family Tree, where families are encouraged to bring children to participate in a kids village throughout the event Symbiosis is known for \\"embodying an ethos of creativity, sustainability and experimentation through its vibrant art installations, esoteric lineup and infectious vibes\\" as well as having a lineup of live and electronic, downtempo, trance, and world music as well as permaculture, sustainability, kirtan, and yoga workshops. Symbiosis Gathering includes an ecological component that encourages sustainable lifestyle choices and to leave places in better condition than when they arrived. Symbiosis has hosted multi-day immersives in 2006, 2007, 2013, 2015, and 2016 focusing on sustainability, yoga, visionary art, permaculture, and indigenous wisdom. The producers have positioned three events to coincide with solar eclipses, including the event in Oregon during the total solar eclipse on August 21, 2017. Many performance troupes can be found integrated with the programming including the producers of the Edwardian Ball, Bay Area's Vau de Vire Society, and Lucent Dossier Experience, among others. Organizers have no screens or projections at the event instead relying on lighting and structure for ambience to create more participating and less observing. The event has no corporate sponsorship, an aspect which is shared by only Burning Man in gatherings of substantial size.  Music  The music selection of Symbiosis has been called eclectic, diverse, quirky, obscure, and underground including live bands such as CocoRosie, Les Claypool, and STS9 among others. The lineup also has an electronic bent with techno and house, with psytrance, downtempo, dubstep, as well as more analog gypsy and quirky performances. The 2015 edition was lauded to have \\"acoustic based musicians, female musicians, butoh artists, and many other cutting edge experimental visual and sonic performance artist that are breaking ground\\" at the time. Symbiosis also has a number of US debuts, unannounced, and surprise performances including edIT and Ooah from The Glitch Mob performing as \\"Crying over Porcelain for No Reason\\" which to date had only happened in '09 and '15 both at Symbiosis Gathering. Art The art of Symbiosis has been called trippy, otherworldly, mind-blowing and lauded by many as an essential aspect of the experience. Structures that have been erected at Burning Man have often found their way to Symbiosis due to the relative proximity of time and location between the two events. Sculpture and installation artists such as Gerard Minakawa of Bamboo DNA, Michael Christian, Hybycozo, Shrine, and Bryan Tedrick are a few of the artists who have built major installations at the events. The stages are also built more as artistic creations than truss structures to hold rock bands. Each stage is created to have its own unique aesthetic which leads to numerous different environments throughout the festival.

Founded in August 1998, the society encourages thousands of members from all around the globe to recognize their happy moments and think about happiness in their daily life.  Purpose  The Secret Society of Happy People supports people who want to share their happiness despite the ones who don’t want to hear happy news. Their mottos include “Happiness Happens” and “Don’t Even Think of Raining on My Parade”. The main purpose of the Society is to stimulate people’s right to express their happiness “as loud as they want”.  Reception  The Society was founded in August 1998 in Irving, Texas, by Pamela Gail Johnson. In December 1998, it gained international reception, when it challenged advice columnist Ann Landers for discouraging people from writing happy holiday newsletters enclosed with their holiday cards. In a letter to Landers, Johnson demanded an apology “to the millions of people you made feel bad for wanting to share their happy news.” The Society’s campaign persuaded Landers to change her advice on holiday letters, one of the rare occasions the columnist had a change of heart. Within the next few years the Society grew bigger being supported by thousands of fans from more than 34 countries.  Founder  Pamela Gail Johnson founded the Secret Society of Happy People with the main idea of creating a “safe place” where people can share their happy moments, without being discouraged by the parade rainers. Since 1998 she has been managing the Society by writing posts, writing the newsletter, updating social media information and answering fan’s questions on her blog Ask Pamela Gail: Where Happiness Meets Reality. Each blog post is formed as an answer to the member’s questions submitted through the website. The purpose is to give people advice for handling their unhappy moments and learning the lesson out of each and every one of them. The column is posted weekly. Pamela is also the author of The Secret Society of Happy People’s Thirty-One Types of Happiness Guide released in November 2012 and Don’t Even Think of Raining on My Parade: Adventures of the Secret Society of Happy People.  Events  = Happiness Happens Day= thumb In 1999 the Society declared 8 August as the \\"Admit You're Happy Day\\", now known as the \\"Happiness Happens Day\\". The idea was inspired by the event that happened the previous year on the same date- the first member joined the Society. In 1998 the Society asked the governors in all 50 states for a proclamation. Nineteen of them sent proclamations. = Happiness Happens Month = Celebration of happiness was expanded in 2000, and thanks to the support of not-so-secretly-happy members from around the world, the Society declared August as Happiness Happens Month. The purpose of Happiness Happens Day and Month is to share happiness and encourage people to talk and think about happiness. = HappyThon = Every year, the Society organizes an online social media event known as HappyThon, on Happiness Happens Day. The aim of this event is to send inspirational messages via social networks, emails or texts, share happy moments, philosophy, quotes, etc. HappyThon is the first online social media event that promotes happiness around the world. Since 1998 the Society have been organizing voting and announcing the Happiest Events and Moments of the Year. Before the end of the century, a vote for 100 of the Happiest Events, Inventions and Social Changes of the Century was organized. In the third week of January the Society hosted Hunt for Happiness Week. They asked the current governors for proclamation, and got it by seven of them.

Gilchrist served as a Texas state highway engineer, president of Texas A&M; University and the first chancellor of the Texas A&M; University System. Gilchrist received numerous awards and honorary degrees. He is the namesake for several transportation- related entities. Biography Gibb Gilchrist was born in Wills Point, Texas, on December 23, 1887. He briefly attended Southwestern University and graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a civil engineering degree. Gilchrist spent several years with the Santa Fe Railroad, where he rebuilt the Galveston County rail line between High Island and Port Bolivar that had been destroyed in the area's 1915 hurricane. Gilchrist served in World War I and became a captain of engineers. He went to work for the state highway department in Texas after the war. He married Vesta Weaver in 1920. They had one child, Henry Gilchrist, who became a Dallas attorney. In 1924, Gilchrist was named state highway engineer. He resigned the next year, shortly after Ma Ferguson was replaced roads advocate Pat Neff as Texas governor. He became an engineering consultant to private business but was again appointed state highway engineer in 1928. Under his direction, a system of roadside rest stops was constructed throughout the state. He resigned in 1936 after Governor James Allred used state highway funds to finance an assistance program for the elderly. In 1937, Gilchrist became the dean of engineering at Texas A&M; University. He was appointed university president in 1944. During his presidency, new rules were issued against student hazing, which prompted some student cadets to call for Gilchrist's dismissal. He became the first chancellor of the Texas A&M; College System in 1948. He served in that capacity until 1953. He spent his retirement in College Station. Gilchrist died in College Station on May 12, 1972. Honors and awards Gilchrist was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Austin College in 1939. He was awarded honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from Baylor University and Southwestern University in 1946. Gilchrist was a Mason and he served as Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Texas in 1952. Legacy The community of Gilchrist, Texas, is named for him. The Gibb Gilchrist is one of the vessels in the Galveston Island Ferry fleet. A street in College Station, Texas is named after the Gilchrist family. The Gibb Gilchrist Building of the Texas Transportation Institute is located in Texas A&M;'s Research Park. The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) issues the Gibb Gilchrist Award to recognize outstanding service within TxDOT. In 2000, Texas A&M; removed a photograph of Gilchrist that had hung at the university because Gilchrist was pictured in front of Confederate Army general Robert E. Lee. In 2002, the picture was returned to the Gibb Gilchrist Building, but it was placed in a first-floor conference room rather than its former location in the building's lobby.

By using a single-ended optical fiber around the current conductor that utilizes the magneto-optic effect (Faraday effect), FOCS measures uni- or bidirectional DC currents of up to 600 kA within ±0.1% of the measured value. Because it does not need a magnetic yoke, an FOCS is smaller and lighter than Hall effect current sensors, and suffers no reduction in accuracy due to saturation effects. Because magnetic field sensing is distributed around circumference, it is unaffected by stray magnetic fields, and there is no need for magnetic centering. It also does not need recalibration after installation or during its service life. Because the optical fiber is inherently insulating, electrical isolation is easier to maintain. The optical phase detection circuit, light source and digital signal processor are contained within the sensor electronics; this technology has been proven in highly demanding applications such as navigation systems in the air, on land and at sea. Applications In 2013, ABB launched a 420 kV Disconnecting Circuit Breaker (DCB) with integrated FOCS. Since one FOCS replaces many conventional current transformers, engineering and design of the substation is simplified. By reducing the material needed, including insulation, a 420 kV DCB with integrated FOCS can reduce a substation’s footprint by over 50% compared to the conventional solution of live tank breakers with disconnectors and current transformers.

Crackdown against illegal sand mining Serving as the Ottappalan Sub-Collector, Arora took stern action against illegal sand- mining in the Bharathapuzha at Ottapalam, Pattambi, Thrithala, and Thiruvanthapuram. The illegal mining of sand was carried out indiscriminately using covert means from ‘kadavus' in the capital district in Kerala. No ‘kadavus' have been approved and no passes have been issued by geologists. In spite of various directions and court orders, the law enforcement agencies had failed to control this illegal activity. Quoting Shri Arora, The Hindu newspaper mentioned the local bodies that were auctioning sand had failed to stop illegal sand-mining, which had resulted in the destruction of the river. Strict rules for students’ road safety in Kerala His campaign in Kerala to ensure that schools comply with safety regulations is highly praised. He took the charge to inforce various safety measures viz. display ‘On school duty' boards on autorickshaws, cars, mini-vans and other hired while transporting students. He also mandated maximum carriage capacity for Autorickshaws, 10 years of driving experience and an EIB driving permit for the drivers. He made it mandatory for school buses to have a fire extinguisher, first-aid box, well-fortified windows, lockable doors and emergency exits. Arora also ordered Regional Transport Officers (RTOs) to impound student carriers violating safety norms after April 1, 2011 and to prosecute their drivers and registered owners. Ban on illegal mining operations in the quarries in Thiruvananthapuram Acting as a District Collector and District Magistrate, Dr. Arora banned all the blasting operations leading to illegal and unscientific cutting in the quarries in Thiruvananthapuram to ensure the health and safety of the people. This was followed by constitution of a committee headed by the Additional District Magistrate along the District Geologist and the District Officer of the Kerala State Pollution Control Board (PCB) as members to carry out a safety audit of mining operations in the 181 quarries in the district. Ensured free and fair polling at Kannur Arora made the polling at Kannur district in Kerala free and fair by deploying 150 videographers at sensitive booths, all trained to capture critical events on election day, like sealing of electronic voting machines (EVMs), positioning of voting compartments, polling agents, voters waiting in queue at the close of scheduled hour and the last voter in queue, visits of sector officers, the observers and other electoral functionaries. Kannur, otherwise has been one of the most difficult poll pavements during elections. Formulation of strict guidelines for parading of elephants In the midst of growing dissonance between Kerala's captive elephants and the mobile-toting population, Dr. Dinesh Arora (the then District Collector of Thiruvananthapuram) formulated a new set of regulations after a district-level meeting to prevent cruelty to elephants under the Kerala Captive Elephants (Management and Maintenance) Rules 2003. The regulations came into effect from May 1, 2011 and it demanded organisers of celebrations using elephants to seek permission from the District Forest Officer, two weeks in advance. The DFO is now required to submit a copy of the permit to the Collector. This permit is based on a certificate issued by the Forest Veterinary Officer or the veterinary surgeon of the Elephant Squad. The DFO has to inspect the mahout's certificate, movement register and other documents to ensure that the elephant to be paraded is free of musth, diseases, injuries and signs of pregnancy, before issuing a permit. Health Initiatives As State Mission Director, Arogyakeralam of National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), Govt. of Kerala, Arora under took a Rapid Assessment to explore the overall reach as well as the performance of the Radio Health FM programme in Thiruvananthapuram in disseminating health promotion among the public. Providing transparency in rural electrification Dinesh Arora, who heads the efforts of Government of India in rural electrification has played an instrumental role in formulating the 'Garv App' and also setting up of institutional mechanism of Gram Vidyut abhiyanta. The Garv App was formally unveiled by Power Minister Piyush Goyal in March 2016. The mobile app enables GVAs to update photographs of the electrical infrastructure along with GPS coordinates during their visit for monitoring the progress of electrification and map it with pre-defined milestones. As most of the unelectrified villages lack proper network connectivity, so it has been ensured that data can also be captured in ‘offline mode’ and get synced with the server after returning to network area. The mobile app provides a dashboard, which gives an overview of the electrification status of the 18,452 un-electrified villages of the country. It displays the number of milestones achieved, status of the progress state-wise, district-wise and village-wise. One can even track the names of contractors implementing the projects in any un-electrified village, date of award of project at the village level, number of villages visited till date by GVAs, visits undertaken in last seven days, villages electrified in past four weeks etc. Recently, Piyush Goyal during the launch of 'GARV' newsletter for rural electrification felicitated REC executive director Dinesh Arora for achieving one-third of the rural electrification target by electrifying more than 6,000 villages across the country.

Article written for the South African Biographical Dictionary  Biography  = Early life and education = Pierre de Villiers Pienaar was born on 11 August 1904 on the farm, 'Elandsfontein', Gatsrand (currently in the Fochville district), that was destroyed in The Anglo-Boer War during the scorched earth text campaign. He attended the primary farm school on 'Elandsfontein', and then went to Boy's High, Potchefstroom, where he matriculated in the first class in 1921. In 1922 he entered the University of the Witwatersrand and the Johannesburg Teachers Training College. He received the B.A. degree in Education the beginning of 1925, and later that year the Honours B.A. degree in the first class.

The following year P. was awarded a Union Bursary to further his studies in Utrecht, Netherlands (September 1927 – April 1928), and Hamburg, Germany (1928–1929), where he continued his research in general linguistics and the phonetics of Afrikaans at the Department of Experimental Phonetics of the University of Hamburg. Here, under the leadership of Prof. G. Panconcelli- Calzia, he was awarded the PhD degree in 1929. As a note of interest, the farm 'Elandsfontein' mentioned above was the farm where renowned Boer War scout, Danie Theron, was temporarily buried after his death in combat in the Fochville area during September 1900. (Theron was reburied in 1903 to the family cemetery of his late fiancée Hannie Neethling, on her father's farm Eikenhof.)Instinsky-Theron (www.instinsky.de). \\"Danie Theron\\" , 1999.

Through his efforts the University of the Witwatersrand in 1948, instituted a four-year degree course with Phonetics and Logopedics as major subjects, the first of its kind in South Africa. He remained head of this Department till the end of 1956. In 1957 he joined the University of South Africa for two years as Professor of Afrikaans and Netherlands Linguistics.

He held this appointment as Professor Emeritus in the Department for two years, and became Honorary professor for the period 1973–1974. In 1973 he opened a private consulting room in Pretoria for the rehabilitation of persons with voice disorders. In his retirement he was still engaged in the field of Afrikaans Phonetics. He was appointed Head of the Speech Archives sponsored by the Department of National Education and the Human Sciences Research Council. Among his students who majored in Phonetics, three have become heads of university departments of Phonetics or African Languages in South Africa (L.W. Langham, D.T. Cole, and E.O.J. Westphall). During his tenure at the universities he persuaded the Departments of Education of all the South African provinces to appoint speech therapists and audiologists in schools, hospitals and other institutions, thus improving the speech and hearing of thousands of people. His diagnostic acumen and therapeutic skill with voice disordered cases have earned the respect of several Ear, Nose and Throat specialists who increasingly referred cases of this nature to him and the speech therapists that he had trained. P. was a member of several scientific societies and served on a number of commissions, committees and councils of the Government and other institutions such as the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), the Department of Education, the Film Council, the Department of Health, the South African Academy of Arts and Science, the Transoranje Institute for Special Education, the South African Council for the Deaf, and others.

Rieber and R.S. Brubaker); \\"Afrikaanse Verklarende Woordeboek (1973)\\" (Afrikaans Explanatory Dictionary), with M.S.B. Kritzinger and F.J. Labuschagne). During the period 1929–1940 he wrote a number of literary works: Skakels van die Ketting (Links of a chain) (1928); Ruth e.a. Kortverhale (1934); Magte (Powers) (1936); Die Oorlogskind e.a. Kortverhale (The war child, short stories) (1940). He loved the theatre, classical music events, and opera. In his younger days he took singing lessons from an Italian maestro. He played tennis and attended many rugby matches. He was fond of sketching, gardening, carpentry, and writing poetry and short stories. He had a large library and would discuss the books with his circle of literary friends. Above all he loved the tranquility of the Kruger National Park; and was indeed an honorary game ranger. As patriarch of the extensive Pienaar family he often had to solve their problems. On these occasions he relaxed on the family farm 'Elandsfontein' by walking in the veld and enjoying the bird life. = Marriage, family and children = He married Frederika Vermaak on 31 January 1928 in Greytown, Natal. They had three children: Rousselot De Villiers Pienaar (professor and head of the Department of Genetics, University of Stellenbosch), Uys De Villiers Pienaar (Park-head of the Kruger National Park 1970–1987, then Chief Director of National Parks until 1991 when he retired), and Anne Lize Mordant (née De Villiers Pienaar, veterinary surgeon). In August 1977 Pierre de Villiers Pienaar suffered a massive stroke that left him paralysed and with no speech.

Life Jiránek was born on 24 July 1698 in Lomnice nad Popelkou (Northern Bohemia, present-day Czech Republic). His parents were servants of the Counts of Morzin; František also started to work for them as a musician. Count Václav Morzin sent him to Venice in 1724 to improve his musical abilities. His teacher was probably Antonio Vivaldi himself. Count Václav Morzin was a very important supporter of Vivaldi (Vivaldi dedicated to him his famous Four Seasons). In 1726 Jiránek came back to Prague and worked as a violinist in the Prague ensemble of Václav Morzin. In this ensemble worked also Antonín Reichenauer and Johann Friedrich Fasch. After the death of Václav Morzin in 1737 Jiránek left Prague and was employed by the Prime Minister of Saxony, Heinrich von Brühl in Dresden. In Dresden his work was informed by the coming Classical music. After the death of Heinrich Brühl in 1763 he retired and died in 1778 in Dresden. Works Only Jiránek's instrumental works have been preserved (e.g. violin concertos, symphonies or concertos). His work was strongly influenced by Vivaldi's musical style, although it has also many original distinctive elements. In fact their styles are so similar that Jiránek's works have occasionally been misattributed to Vivaldi. See, for example, the Violin Concerto in D major RV Anh. 8, which is now known to have been a Jiránek composition, catalogued as Jk Ap. 1.

GoldieBlox, which pairs a construction kit with a storybook, launched in 2012 as a prototype on Kickstarter. Its Kickstarter campaign led to more than $1 million in pre-orders placed in the first month. It has gone on to sell in retailers including Toys \\"R\\" Us and Amazon. The company was founded by Debbie Sterling, a Stanford engineering graduate and entrepreneur. The company is based in Los Angeles, California. History While a student at Stanford, Sterling noticed that the percentage of women in engineering in the United States was only 11%. After research, Sterling found that girls begin to lose interest in math and science as young as age 8.https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/what-high-school- engineering-taught-me-and-how-it-can-empower-other-girls/ After two years studying early child development, including girls and the gender marketing of toys, Sterling learned that girls excel in verbal skills, reading and writing. She created GoldieBlox to combine the story of Goldie, a girl inventor who loves to build, with a construction kit. To fund her first round of production, Sterling created a Kickstarter campaign in 2012. The project reached its funding goal of $150,000 in 4 days, and went on to raise a total of $285,881 with 5,519 backers by the end of the campaign. Products Geared toward ages 4–9, toys in the GoldieBlox series introduce engineering concepts to girls through storytelling and building. Each toy introduces new characters and concepts. There are six sets in the series. In 2014, GoldieBlox began introducing digital content. The company's first mobile app, GoldieBlox and the Movie Machine, was introduced in October. The app features the company's first-ever animated cartoon, and was named by Apple as one of the Best Apps of 2014. Bloxtown, GoldieBlox's digital playground, also has original videos of new design ideas for kids to watch and build at home. Videos =GoldieBlox & Rube Goldberg \\"Princess Machine\\"= GoldieBlox's \\"Princess Machine\\" video launched on YouTube in November 2013. The video features three young girls building a Rube Goldberg machine built by Brett Doar, and was set to a parody tune of the Beastie Boys song \\"Girls\\". Shortly after the release, the Beastie Boys reached out to GoldieBlox, inquiring about the use of their song without their permission. Goldieblox responded by suing for declaratory judgment in the U.S. District Court of San Francisco seeking declaration of fair use due to parody. GoldieBlox claimed fair use on the grounds that they had \\"created its parody video specifically to comment on the Beastie Boys song, and to further the company's goal to break down gender stereotypes and to encourage young girls to engage in their intellect.\\" The Beastie Boys responded with an open letter, in which they lauded \\"the creativity and message behind the ad,\\" voiced their support for GoldieBlox's mission, but ultimately declared that the band did not permit their \\"music and/or name to be used in product ads,\\" a claim which was further bolstered by a stipulation in deceased band member Adam Yauch's will. The band concluded their letter by stating, \\"when we tried to simply ask how and why our song 'Girls' had been used in your ad without our permission, YOU sued US.\\" GoldieBlox responded by taking down the video and writing their own open letter, stating that, \\"although we believe our parody video falls under fair use, we would like to respect [Yauch's] wishes and yours.\\" Regardless, the Beastie Boys went ahead with the counter lawsuit and a settlement was ultimately reached. The settlement granted GoldieBlox a retroactive license for the song. In exchange, GoldieBlox \\"agreed to make annual payments of 1% of its gross revenue, until the total payments reached $1 million, to a charitable organization chosen by the Beastie Boys and approved by GoldieBlox which supports \\"science, technology, engineering and/or mathematics education for 'girls'\\". =\\"This is Your Brain on Engineering (GoldieBlox Easter PSA)\\"= The company's \\"This is Your Brain on Engineering (GoldieBlox Easter PSA)\\" video launched on YouTube in April 2014.

The video focused on the need for female role models inspired by ingenuity and creativity. In the video, Big Sister prescribes her ideals of beauty and perfection to young girls. Little Sister, a girl inspired by Goldie, rebels against the mantra, breaking the girls free and leading them to a world of possibilities. The video is set to \\"Help I'm Alive\\" by Metric. =\\"Lightning Strikes\\"= GoldieBlox released their first single and animated music video, \\"Lightning Strikes,\\" in December 2014. The track is an original song written and performed by Emily Haines, the lead singer of Canadian rock band Metric. The video and song feature Goldie, a strong female character who comes up with a great idea and strives to accomplish it, despite whatever set-backs occur along the way. Advertisements =Intuit's Small Business Big Game Super Bowl commercial= In February 2014, GoldieBlox won Intuit's Small Business, Big Game contest, earning a 30-second commercial spot during the broadcast of Super Bowl XLVIII. The commercial airtime was valued at $4 million. With the advertisement, GoldieBlox became the first small business to air an ad in the Super Bowl.

Early life Kanjibhai Rathod from Maroli village in south Gujarat, was considered the first successful director in Indian cinema. His rise to fame in an era when most people stayed away from films due to a peculiar stigma attached to the filmdom. Not much is known about Rathod's personal life. Film historian Virchand Dharamsey writes, he was coming from the poor background, but he belonged to a rich Rajput clan (caste), he can be considered the first successful professional director of India.\\" Career Rathod began as a still photographer with the Oriental Film Company. His experience earned him a job in Kohinoor Film Company and its owner Dwarkadas Sampat made him a director. Rathod's 'Bhakta Vidur' released in 1921, was perhaps the first criticism of the British colonialism in a popular feature film. This mythological allegory directly alluded to political issues, particularly the controversy over the Rowlatt Act. An adaptation from a section of the Mahabharata, this film showed the British as the Kauravas and its protagonist Vidur as Gandhi. Sampat himself played the role donning the Gandhi cap and khadi shirt. The film raised a storm - while a big hit in Bombay, it was banned by the British in Karachi and Madras, write historians. Rathod was the first film-maker to direct a crime thriller in 1920s on contemporary events. His Kala Naag (1924) was based on famous double murder case in Bombay. Rathod introduced Zubaida to film industry with his Gulbakavali. By the time he left for Saurashtra Film Company in Rajkot in 1924, Rathod had enough work on his name. At the launch of Krishna Film Company, he returned to Mumbai in 1931, the year of first talkies. Dharamsey writes in his 'Light of Asia: Indian Silent Cinema 1912–1934' that Rathod directed five talkies out of 17 made in 1931. He remained active in the industry even in 1940s, but he was not as successful directing talkies.

Production is expected to ramp up to approximately 3.6 Mtpa of saleable production by the middle of 2014. With JORC compliant measured and indicated resources and proved and probable ROM reserves of some 123 mt and 96 mt respectively at mine startup the current mine life is estimated to be in excess of 24 years. Middlemount Coal is an incorporated joint venture between Peabody Energy Australia and Yancoal Australia.

The principal crops grown by Indian farmers were maize (corn), beans, and squash, including pumpkins. Sunflowers, goosefoot,Minnis 262 tobacco,Minnis 303 gourds, and plums, were also grown. Evidence of agriculture is found in all Central Plains complexes. Archaeological sites in Nebraska reveal cultivated crops such as little barley (Hordeum pusillum), sunflowers (Helianthus annuus), goosefoot (Chenopodium berlandieri), marsh elder (Iva annua), and maize (Zea mays).Minnis 305 Tribes periodically switched from farming to hunting throughout their history during the Plains Village period,Minnis, p. 301 AD 950–1850. Environment A map showing the location of the Great Plains The primary constraint on agriculture on the Great Plains is that precipitation is often deficient for growing maize, the primary crop of Indian farmers. In addition, on the northern Great Plains the growing season is short. Agriculture on the Plains seems to have had an ebb and flow, advancing westward into the drier areas in favorable wet periods and retreating in drier periods. The periodic abundance or scarcity of bison was also a factor in human settlements on the plains. The animal was an important food resource for Plains people, as well as providing skins for clothing and shelters. The Great Plains are often looked upon by anthropologists as a cultural backwater, derivative of societies in the eastern woodlands or the American Southwest. Contrary to that opinion, the Plains in the late prehistoric and proto-historic period (roughly AD 1400 to 1750) attracted migrants from both east and west. Prehistory A Wichita village surrounded by fields of maize and other crops Gathering wild plants, such as the prairie turnip (Psoralea esculenta) and chokecherry (Prunus virginiana) for food was undoubtedly a practice of Indian societies on the Great Plains since their earliest habitation 13,000 or more years ago.Numerous references including Hirst, K. Kris, \\"The (pre) History of Clovis.\\" About.com Archaeology, accessed 3 June 2013 Over time Plains people learned to grow or facilitate the growth of native plants useful as food. Many native plants cultivated by Indians in the Eastern Agricultural Complex were also cultivated on the Great Plains. Squash and beans were cultivated in what is now the United States, independent of Mesoamerica.Gibbon, Guy E. and Kenneth M. Ames Archaeology of Prehistoric Native America: An Encyclopedia. New York: Routledge, 1998: 238. Maize is a tropical crop first cultivated in Mexico which found its way northward to the United States over thousands of years. Maize agriculture began on the Great Plains by AD 900, initiating the Southern Plains villagers period of western Oklahoma and Texas. It probably came about as an extension westward and northward of the Caddoan cultures of eastern Texas. The Plains Village culture consisted of hamlets and semi-permanent villages along major rivers such as the Red, Washita, and Canadian. Subsistence was a combination of agriculture and hunting. A drying climatic trend beginning AD 1000 or 1100 may have tipped the subsistence scale more toward hunting and less toward a dependence upon agriculture.Drass, Richard R.

The Missouri River Valley in present-day North Dakota was probably the northern limit of pre-historic maize cultivation on the Great Plains. Prior to cultivation, Indian farmers had to breed maize varieties that would mature in short growing seasons. Prehistoric evidence of maize cultivation north of the border of the United States and Canada on the Great Plains is lacking but by the 1790s maize was being grown by Indian farmers as far north as the mouth of the Red River north of Winnipeg, Manitoba.Schneider, Fred, \\"Prehistoric horticulture in the northeastern plains.\\" Plains Anthropologist\\", 47 (180), 2002, pp. 33-50; Moodie, D. W. and Kaye, Barry. \\"The Northern Limit of Indian Agriculture\\" Geographic Review Vol. 59, No. 4 (Oct 1969), pp. 512-529 The principal known Indian peoples who farmed extensively on the Great Plains when first discovered by European explorers were, from south to north, Caddoans in the Red River drainage, Wichita people along the Arkansas River, Pawnee in the Kansas River and Platte River drainages, and the Arikara, Mandan, and Hidatsa along the Missouri River in the Dakotas. Other peoples migrated or were pushed onto the Great Plains in late prehistoric or proto-historic times. Some of them, such as the Sioux and Cheyenne, gave up agriculture to become nomadic; other such as the Dhegiha (the Osage, Kaw, Omaha, and Ponca) and the Chiwere (Otoe, Iowa, and Missouria) continued to farm while also hunting buffalo for a major part of their livelihood. Archaeologists have found evidence of agriculture practiced by Apache people (the Dismal River culture) living on the Great Plains in western Kansas and Nebraska in the 17th century. The semi- nomadic Apache were pushed southward and off the Great Plains by the fully nomadic Comanche in the 18th century.Scheiber, Laura L. \\"The Late Prehistoric on the High Plains of Western Kansas: High Plains Upper Republican and Dismal River\\" in Kansas Archaeology, pp 141-148 Cultivation and yields Lacking iron tools and draft animals the prehistoric Indian farmer on the Great Plains primarily cleared and cultivated wooded land along rivers, especially the lighter soils on elevated river terraces which periodically flooded, renewing their fertility. They avoided cultivating the heavy soils of the open prairie with their deep mats of fibrous roots.Scullin, Michael \\"Indian Gardening and Cooking\\" http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/offices/scullin/Cookbook.129831.html , accessed Aug 30, 2008 The high productivity of maize compared to European grains such as wheat enabled Indian farmers to produce large crops with a relatively low expenditure of effort, simple tools, and a small amount of cultivated land—although farming on the drought-prone Great Plains was always a risky endeavor. Whereas wheat and other grains in medieval Europe had average grain yields of two to ten seeds harvested for every one planted, maize yielded as high as \\"one hundred grains to one.\\" Schroeder, Sissel \\"Maize Productivity in the Eastern Woodlands and Great Plains of North America\\" American Antiquity, Vol. 64, No. 3 (July 1999), pp. 501-502; Jordan, William Chester The Great Famine: Northern Europe in the Early Fourteenth Century Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1996, pp. 25-26 The average size of family plots of Indian farmers may have been about with yields of 10-20 bushels (627 - 1,254 kg) of shelled maize per acre. This would have been sufficient, after accounting for post-harvest losses to pests and rotting and the retention of seed corn, to provide about 20 percent of the caloric needs of an Indian family of five persons. Some families may have cultivated up to which would have produced sufficient maize for family consumption plus a tradeable surplus.Schroeder, Sissel \\"Maize Productivity in the Eastern Woodlands and Great Plains of North America\\" American Antiquity, Vol. 64, No. 3 (July 1999), p. 512 Higher yields of up to 40 bushels (2,508 kg.) per acre have been reported on newly cleared land. Land declined in fertility in subsequent crop years.Munson-Scullin, Wendy and Scullin, Michael, (2005) \\"Potential Productivity of Midwestern Native American Gardens\\" Plains Anthropologist, Vol. 50, No. 193, pp. 9-21 Among the Hidatsa, typical of Great Plains farmers, fields were cleared by burning which also fertilized the soil. The three implements used by Indian farmers were the digging stick, hoe, and rake. The digging stick was a sharpened and fire-hardened stick, three or more feet long, that was used to loosen soil, uproot weeds, and make planting holes. The hoe was made from a buffalo or elk shoulder blade bone, or scapula, lashed to a wooden handle. The rake was made from wood or an antler. Some Indian women preferred the bone hoe even after the iron hoe was introduced by European traders and settlers.Wilson, Gilbert L. Buffalo Bird Woman's Garden: Agriculture of the Hidatsa Indians St Paul: Minnesota Historical Society Press, 1987, p. 11-14 Sunflowers were the earliest crop planted in spring. Sunflowers were planted in clumps around the edges of fields. Maize was next planted. Indian planting techniques are called Three Sisters agriculture. About five seeds were sown in a low mound of soil. The mounds were spaced about five feet apart. When the maize plants were a few inches high, climbing beans and squash seeds were planted between the mounds. The large squash leaves shaded the soil, preserving moisture and crowding out weeds. The beans fixed nitrogen in the soil and climbed up the corn stalks as support.Munson- Scullin, 2005 The Wichita, and possibly other southern peoples, planted or tended thickets of low-growing Chickasaw Plum trees separating and bordering their maize fields. Tobacco was planted in separate fields and tended by old men. Women did most of the other farming, although men assisted in clearing land.Wilson, pp. 16, 121 Indian farmers avoided fertilizing their fields with manure. As the soil declined in fertility with each crop year, unproductive fields were fallowed for two years and then replanted.Wilson, pp. 114, 117 Farming year  The Pawnee in Nebraska were among the best of the Plains Indian farmers and had elaborate rituals connected with the planting and harvesting of maize. In spring, they planted 10 varieties of maize, seven varieties of pumpkins and squashes, and eight varieties of beans. The maize included flour, flint, and sweet corn plus one ancient variety raised only for inclusion in the \\"sacred bundles\\" common among Plains Indians. The Indians were aware that the different varieties of maize could hybridize if grown in close proximity and planted different varieties in fields a substantial distance apart.Wilson, p. 59 One of the rituals of the Pawnees during the spring planting season to ensure the fertility of the soil was the Morning Star ceremony and the ritual sacrifice of a young girl captured from an enemy tribe. The Morning Star sacrifice did not take place every year. The last human sacrifice by the Pawnee was in 1838.Welfish, Gene. The Lost Universe: Pawnee Life and Culture Lincoln:University of Nebraska Press, 1965, pp. 95-123 Common to many other Plains farmers, the Pawnee left their villages in late June when their corn crop was about knee high to live in tipis and roam the plains on a summer buffalo hunt. They returned about the first of September to harvest their crops. Maize, beans, and pumpkins were dried, packed into rawhide bags, and stored in bell-shaped underground storage pits. The Pawnee followed the harvest with a month of celebrations and in early December departed their villages again for a winter hunt, their stored agricultural products hidden beneath the ground. This yearly cycle of life was common among the Plains farmers, especially after the acquisition of the horse in the late 17th and 18th century gave then the mobility to undertake lengthy hunts far from their permanent villages.Weltfish, pp. 239-271, 409-411 Trade Trade between the farming and the nomadic hunting Indians was important on the Great Plains. The Mandan and Hidatsa villages on the Missouri River in the Dakotas conducted a large trade with the non-agricultural hunting Indians. In fall 1737, the French explorer La Vérendrye found a group of Assiniboine planning to undertake their annual two-month-long, thousand-mile round trip south to the Mandan villages to trade bison meat for agricultural goods.Boyd, Matthew and Surette, Clarence \\"Northernmost Precontact Maize in North America\\" American Antiquity, Vol. 75, No. 1 (Jan 2010), pp. 117-133 The trading expedition was conducted on foot with dogs as draft animals as neither the Assiniboine nor the Mandans yet possessed horses. There is abundant evidence of similar long-distance trading between farmers and hunters among other tribes of the Plains.McGeshick, Joseph R., Smith, Dennis J., and Shanley, James.

It is located over the former site of the township of Blair Athol. The mine has coal reserves amounting to 195 million tonnes of Thermal coal, one of the largest coal reserves in Asia and the world. The mine has an annual production capacity of 12.9 million tonnes of coal. Coal was first discovered at this location in 1864 and has been mined from this area since this time by different companies. Underground mining changed to small- scale open cut mining in the 1920-1930s, the first open cut coal mine in Queensland. In 1968, the Blair Athol coal field was taken over by two large multinationals, CRA and Clutha Development. Exploration showed that the township was over the main coal seam, resulting in the relocation of residences to the nearby town of Clermont in the mid-1970s. In 1984, the Rio Tinto company opened its main mine at this location, as a large scale open cut mine. Peak production was reached in 2009 with 11.3 million tonnes of coal exported. Rio Tinto Coal Australia closed the mine in August 2012 because it was nearly exhausted. Blair Athol was bought by New Emerald Coal, a subsidiary of Linc Energy in 2013.

Military expansion to the south began under the previous Qin dynasty and continued during the Han era. Campaigns were dispatched to conquer the Yue tribes, leading to the annexation of Minyue by the Han in 135 BC and 111 BC, Nanyue in 111 BC, and Dian in 109 BC. Han Chinese culture took root into the newly conquered territories and the Baiyue and Dian tribes were eventually assimilated or displaced by the Han Empire. Evidence of Han dynasty influences are apparent in artifacts excavated in the Baiyue tombs of modern southern China. This sphere of influence eventually extended to various ancient Southeast Asian kingdoms, where contact led to the spread of Han Chinese culture, trade and political diplomacy. The increased demand for Chinese silk also led to the establishment of the Silk Road connecting Europe, the Near East, and China. Background Mural showing cavalry and chariots, from the Dahuting Tomb () of the late Eastern Han Dynasty (25–220 AD), located in Zhengzhou, Henan province, China Military campaigns against the Baiyue began under the Qin, the dynasty that preceded the Han. The First Emperor of the Qin craved for the resources of the Baiyue and ordered military expeditions against the region between 221 and 214 BC. He sent a large contingent of soldiers against Lingnan in 214 BC, comprising conscripted merchants and soldiers. Military garrisons were installed, the Lingqu Canal was constructed, and new areas were placed under Qin administration. The collapse of the Qin caused the dissolution of Qin administration in southern China. Indigenous Yue kingdoms emerged in the former Qin territories, including the Nanyue kingdom in Guangxi, Guangdong, and Vietnam, Minyue in Fujian, and Eastern Ou in Zhejiang. Supported by the Han military, Minyue was established in 202 BC and Eastern Ou in 192 BC after the fall of the Qin dynasty. Zhao Tuo, a former Chinese commander of the Qin, established Nanyue in 208 BC after the death of the emperor Qin Shi Huang. Emperor Gaozu, first emperor of the Han dynasty, approved Zhao Tuo's new title as king. Zhao was born in the city of Zhending in Central China, and the ruling class of the new kingdom was composed of Chinese officials from the former Qin dynasty. In 180 BC, Zhao offered to submit as a vassal state and the Han accepted, a decision partly based on his family's northern Chinese ancestry. Military campaigns By 111 BC, Emperor Wu of Han successfully conquered Nanyue and annexed it into the Han empire. ceramic statues of one Chinese cavalryman and ten infantrymen with armor, shields, and missing weapons in the foreground, and three more cavalrymen in the rear, from the tomb of Emperor Jing of Han (r. 157–141 BC), now located at the Hainan Provincial Museum =Campaigns against Minyue and Eastern Ou= Military campaigns were launched against the Baiyue under the reign of the Han emperor Wu. The Eastern Ou Kingdom requested Han military assistance when Minyue invaded the kingdom in 138 BC. Supreme commander Tian Fen opposed Han intervention. Tian told the emperor that the Yue tribes could not be trusted. Battles between the Yue tribes occurred frequently, and Tian believed that protecting them was not a responsibility of the Han court. The Han official Zhuang Zhu convinced the emperor to intervene in the war. Zhuang's argument was based on the emperor's role as the Son of Heaven, a concept in Chinese political philosophy. In Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian, Zhuang is reported to have said: > The only thing we should worry about is whether we have strength enough to > rescue them and virtue enough to command their loyalty... Now a small > country has come to report its distress to the Son of Heaven. If he does not > save it, to whom can it turn for aid? And how can the Son of Heaven claim > that the rulers of all other states are like sons to him if he ignores their > pleases? The Minyue surrendered after a Han naval force led by Zhuang Zhu was dispatched from Shaoxing in northern Zhejiang, and withdrew from Eastern Ou. The Yue tribes of Eastern Ou were transferred to the north, between the Yangtze River and Huai River. A second intervention was launched in 135 BC after Minyue, ruled by Zou Ying, invaded Nanyue, ruled by Zhao Mo. Nanyue had been a Han vassal since 180 BC. Zhao asked the Han for their support, and the emperor responded by sending an army led by Wang Hui and Han Anguo against Minyue. Zou Ying was assassinated with a spear by his younger brother Zou Yushan, who plotted against the ruler with the royal family and prime minister. Ying beheaded the corpse and gave the head to a messenger, who delivered it to Wang as a sign of Minyue's surrender. After the assassination, Minyue was succeeded by a state divided into a dual monarchy composed of the kingdom of Minyue, controlled by a Han proxy ruler, and the kingdom of Dongyue, ruled by Zou Yushan. As general Yang Pu returned north with his soldiers after the Han–Nanyue War in 111 BC, he requested the emperor's permission to annex Dongyue. The emperor refused after he considered the morale of the troops. Zou Yushan had promised to supply an army to assist the Han in their war against the Nanyue. The army never arrived and Zou blamed the weather conditions, while secretly maintaining a diplomatic relationship with Nanyue. Zou began a rebellion against the Han after learning of Yang's plot against him. A Han military campaign was dispatched and led by General Han Yue, General Yang Pu, military commander Wang Wenshu, and two marquises of Yue ancestry. The revolt was repressed and the Han annexed Dongyue in the last months of 111 BC, conquering the remaining territory of the former Minyue. Sima Qian records that the entire population of Dongyue was exiled, a claim that is implausible. =Campaign against Nanyue= Zhao Tuo, the founder of Nanyue kingdom in southern China and northern Vietnam. In the 110s BC, Jiushi (), the empress dowager of Nanyue, wife of the deceased Zhao Yingqi and a native Han Chinese, mooted the unification of Nanyue with Han China. This proposal was met with resistance in the Nanyue nobility which, although nominally tributary to the Han, had not paid tribute in years. The queen was executed by Lü Jia, leader of those who had opposed her, in the summer of 112 BC. The Han dynasty took umbrage at the diplomats killed with her and saw this event as an act of rebellion. Emperor Wu sent a military campaign consisting of 2,000 soldiers led by General Han Qianqiu to quell the revolt. The general died in battle and the Han forces lost. The second campaign, led by the generals Lu Bode and Yang Pu, was dispatched by sea with 100,000 soldiers in the fall of 112 BC. They reached the city of Panyu, located in modern Guangzhou, in 111–110 BC and defeated the rebels. Lingnan was once again brought under Chinese control, and nine Chinese commanderies were created to administer Guangdong, the island of Hainan, and the Red River Delta of northern Vietnam. The two Han commanderies located in Hainan were abandoned in 82 BC and 46 BC, despite the Han government's interest in the area's rare resources. Ma Yuan's statue on Mount Fubo, Guilin In the early years of the Eastern Han, following the usurpation of Wang Mang and the re-establishment of the Han, the tribal elites of Nanyue remained loyal to the Han. In 40 AD, revolts against Han rule were led by the Trung sisters near the Red River Delta. The rebellion was defeated in 43 by the general Ma Yuan, a participant in the battles that followed Wang Mang's usurpation. The Han reestablished control of Nanyue. The Trung sisters were executed or killed during the fighting. In popular accounts, they vanished in the sky, fell sick, or took their own lives by jumping into a river and drowning. Violence in the region continued, and there were seven periods of unrest between 100 and 184. A new strategy was adopted, orchestrated by the official Li Gu, that sought to appoint honest officials, exile hostile tribes, and pit tribal leaders against each other. The strategy was only partially successful. =Campaign against Dian= In 135 BC, Tang Meng led the earliest Han expedition against Dian, establishing the Jianwei commandery in southwestern China. The Dian tribes were involved in the trade of livestock, horses, fruit, and slaves, and was attractive to the Han because of their resources and metalworking expertise. Trade routes between Dian and the rest of the Han empire were opened up by Han soldiers. The Han continued their expansion northward, and annexed the territory near Shu. Ceramic statues of a prancing horse (foreground) and a cavalryman on horseback (background), Eastern Han Dynasty (25–220 AD) Due to the Han–Xiongnu War on the north, the rising cost of administration in the distant state led to the Han abandoning the commandery. A group of Chinese explorers were captured by the Dian for four years. They were part of an expedition traveling southwards to establish an alternative trade route for the goods reported in Central Asian markets in 122 BC. Dian was conquered during a military campaign launched by Emperor Wu of Han in 109 BC, and the Yizhou commandery was established in the former kingdom. Archaeologists discovered the king of Dian's imperial seal inscribed by the Han, confirming Dian's surrender and status as a subject of the Han. The Dian led a series of unsuccessful rebellions against Han rule, beginning with two revolts in 86 BC and 83 BC. Chen Li, governor of the Zangge commandery, crushed a rebellion in 28–25 BC. Under Wang Mang's reign as usurper of the Han throne between 9-23 AD, hostilities in southwestern China persisted. Wang sent military campaigns to quell the unrest. Seventy percent of the soldiers in one campaign died from illness. Another campaign, comprising 100,000 men and with double the supplies, was not fruitful. Rebellions continued in 42-45 and 176. The Han expanded further during Emperor Ming's reign (57–75 AD). The new commandery of Yongchang () was established in what is modern Baoshan, Yunnan in the former Dian Kingdom. The Dian tribes west of Yuexi/Yuesui Commandery (越巂, modern Xichang in southern Sichuan) submitted to Han rule in 114 AD. Emperor Huang (r. 146-168) encouraged the cultural assimilation of the tribes during his reign between. Under Emperor Huangti, sinicization of the Dian involved the teaching of Chinese ethics and Han Chinese culture was promoted in Yunnan. Despite periodic unrest, the Dian Kingdom was eventually absorbed into the Han Empire. Conquered by the Han dynasty, Han Chinese settlers began moving into the lowlands once inhabited by the Dian. Over the centuries, the Dian were assimilated by the Han Chinese and were virtually extinct by the 12th century AD. Historical significance =Chinese migration and cultural assimilation= The imperial seal of Nanyue king Zhao Mo. Artifacts uncovered in Nanyue sites show a mixture of Chinese and Yue elements. Han Chinese migration from northern and central China populated Yunnan and Guangdong. The political turmoil that followed Wang Mang's usurpation led to another wave of Chinese migration. Han settlers and soldiers from the north were affected by diseases common in tropical regions, such as malaria and schistosomiasis. Sinification of the Yue and Dian tribes was brought about by a combination of Han imperial military power, regular Han Chinese settlement and an influx of Han Chinese refugees. The military invasions and an influx Han Chinese immigrants created a culture that merged Han Chinese traditions with indigenous elements. Evidence from modern archaeological digs in the area reveal the extent of Han Chinese influence. Han dynasty tombs in Guangzhou, Guangdong show that the native tools and ceramics were gradually replaced by those modeled after Chinese styles by the Western Han. Excavations from the period have uncovered bronze mirrors, stoves, wells, incense burners, tripods, and lanterns manufactured in the style of the Han Chinese. Cultural assimilation in Guangxi and Guizhou happened during the late Western Han and occurred later than in Guangdong. As in Guangdong, a number of Han-style mirrors, coins, ceramics, bronze, iron, and lacquerware were discovered in the region's tombs. Modern Yunnan in southwestern China was annexed into the Han Empire after the establishment of a Chinese prefecture in 109 BC. The growing influence of Chinese culture is apparent in excavated Dian artifacts, and coins, ceramics, mirrors, and bronzes have been discovered in Dian manufactured with Han stylistic elements. Dian art adopted the aesthetics of Han imports and by 100, the indigenous Dian culture had largely disappeared. Northern Chinese culture had become largely ingrained in the south. The expansion of China from the North China Plain to the south, a process that began in the Qin dynasty, had reached its height under the Han. =Trade and foreign contact= Map of the provinces, commanderies, and protectorates of the Han dynasty in 87 BC. The Southward expansion of the Han dynasty brought the empire into contact with the civilizations of Southeast Asia. Chinese cultural and technological influence spread to nearby Southeast Asian kingdoms. Remnants of Chinese pottery from the Han dynasty have been excavated in Sumatra, Borneo, and Java that date from the 1st century. Archaeologists have also discovered bronze axes in Cambodia that were based on the design of Chinese axes. Han dynasty emperors and their successors maintained commercial and diplomatic ties with various South and Southeast Asian kingdoms. Han dynasty ships traveled as far as India, expanding the horizon for new foreign markets for Chinese goods and services through maritime trade within the orbit of the Indian Ocean. Trade relationships were also established between China and foreign empires through the conquered territories. Trade connected China with the Indian Mauryan, Sātavāhana and Shunga Empires, the Persian Parthian Empire, and the European Roman Mediterranean. Roman dancers and entertainers were sent to Luoyang as a gift to China from a Burmese kingdom in 120. A kingdom referred to in the Book of Han as Huangzhi delivered a rhinoceros in the year 2 AD as a tribute. An Indian embassy arrived in China between 89 and 105. Roman merchants from the province of Syria visited Nanyue in 166, Nanjing in 226, and Luoyang in 284. Foreign products have been found at archaeological sites excavating tombs in southern China. Originating with the overseas demand for Chinese silk, the ancient Silk Road trade routes were responsible for the transmission of goods and services as well as ideas between ancient Europe, the Near East, and China.

This is accomplished by attaching the protein of interest to a protein which is known to localize to the surface of the bacterial outer membrane. First introduced in the 1990s, the technique is now widely used in research science and in biotechnology to manipulate bacteria for protein studies, drug discovery, and vaccine development. Mechanism Autodisplay is based on the mechanism of bacterial autotransporter proteins. These proteins have a signal peptide at the N-terminus which allows them to be translocated across the bacterial inner membrane and into the periplasm. In the periplasm a β-barrel domain at the protein's C-terminus inserts into the bacterial outer membrane, forming a channel through which the rest of the protein can pass. The rest of the protein threads through this channel across the outer membrane and to the surface of the bacteria. Once it reaches the surface, the protein may stay connected to the membrane-bound β-barrel or it may be cleaved from the membrane and secreted into the extracellular environment. There are several known Autotransporter pathways. Autodisplay uses this autotransporter system by inserting a protein of interest between the N-terminal signal peptide and the C-terminal β-barrel of an autotransporter. This allow the protein of interest to be carried to the bacterial surface by the regular autotransporter mechanism. History Autodisplay is based on the autotransporter proteins of gram-negative bacteria, which were first discovered in the late 1980s, when the IgA1 protease of Neisseria gonorrhoeae was described. By the early 1990s, several groups had attempted to attach heterologous proteins to IgA1 protease and express the product in Escherichia coli, however the N. gonorrhoeae IgA1 protease was not expressed well in E. coli, limiting the usefulness of this system. Subsequently, the IgA1 protease was replaced by an autotransporter native to E. coli, namely the AIDA-1 protein from Enteropathogenic E. coli. This was expressed to much higher levels in E. coli than the previously used N. gonorrhoeae protein had been, allowing this system to be used for larger- scale biotechnological applications. Autodisplay was invented with goals such as whole cell catalyses, especially with substrates which cannot cross the membranes of bacteria, the expression of peptides/proteins without an attached purification and the expression of immobilized peptides/proteins.

Operations at the mine were carried out by Theiss until December 2017 when a joint venture between US based Peabody Energy (10%) and Australian company New Hope Coal (90%) took over. The mine employs about 900 people. Extraction is undertaken by a terrace mining truck and shovel operation. Exports from the mine are sent to Asia, Europe, India and South America. Pits The original mining pit was exhausted in June 2005, followed by Broadmeadow and Wallanbah pits in 2009. Two more pits, Bullock Creek and Plumtree South were utilised from 2010 onwards.

The mine has coal reserves amounting to 196 million tonnes of coking coal, one of the largest coal reserves in Asia and the world. Collinsville has an annual production capacity of 6 million tonnes of coal. History Mining began at the site in 1919. Because it is close to the Port of Townsville where American coal-fired warships were based during World War II men were requisition to the mine. On 1 May 1952, 150 miners took part in Queensland's first stay down strike. The men stayed in the underground mine to protest the lack of payment for a days work. The miners were unable to enter the mine on 15 April due to a lack of winchman. In 1954, seven miners lives were lost at the mine in the Collinsville coal mine disaster. A mining heritage centre was opened 50 years later to commemorate the disaster. Mount Isa Mines (MIM) gained a controlling interest in 1972. In 2003, MIM was purchased by Xstrata. Management of the mine was continued by Thiess until early 2013. In July 2013, more than 300 workers were dismissed in an effort to return the mine to profitability.

Günther Zehetner and Hans Lehrach (3 February 1994). Nature, vol 367, pp. 489-491 The RLDB distributed macroarrays generated at the ICRF to research groups worldwide. The macroarrays consisted of clones of genomic and cDNA libraries transferred to 22 × 22 cm nylon filters with the help of robots which have been developed by Zehetner at the ICRF. Experimental results done with the standardized materials were reported back by researches and collected in the Primary Database.Preparation and screening of high-density cDNA arrays with Genomic Clones (Methods in Molecular Biology, vol 175:. Genomics Protocols, edited by: MP Starkey and R. Elaswarapu, Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ), Günther Zehetner, Maria Pack, and Katja Schäfer (2001), pp. 169-188 In early 1995 the RLDB was moved to Berlin to the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, where it continued its work.Max-Planck-Institut will Gen-Bank einrichten, Die Welt, 31 May 1995 In the summer of 1995, the Resource Centre was established as part of the German Human Genome Project (DHGP) by Hans Lehrach (Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics (MPIMG), Berlin-Dahlem), Günther Zehetner (MPIMG, until July 2000 Scientific Director of the Berlin Resource Center) and Annemarie Poustka (German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg). As Resource Center/Primary Database (RZPD) it took over the work of the RLDB. It was funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in order to provide the materials free of charge to the members of the DHGP, while they were available to other researchers at cost prize. The RZPD became the largest database for genetic clones worldwide and was associated with many of the major national and international gene and genome research projects. Frozen microtiter plates with library clones The RZPD was one of only two distributors in Europe for IMAGE cDNA clones and also constructed its own plasmid, cosmid, YAC and cDNA libraries. Each clone was stored in a well of a 96 or 384 well microtiter plate, which were kept, while not used for spotting, in deep freezers at -80 °C. On 1 July 2000 the RZPD was converted into a Non- Profit-Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung (gGmbH). This company with limited liability was supported by three of the most important research companies in Germany: the Max Planck Society, the German Cancer Research Center and the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC Berlin-Buch). As scientific company members served Hans Lehrach (MPIMG), Annemarie Poustka (DKFZ), Jens Reich (MDC) Matthias Uhlen (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm) and Harald zur Hausen (DKFZ). On 31 July 2007 the non-profit company was disbanded. A large part of the existing services was taken over by two new companies. ImaGenes (a start-up company by the former managing directors of the RZPD) and ATLAS Biolabs GmbH, which was co-founded by Lehrach with the former department heads of the RZPD, Uwe Radelof und Bernd Drescher.RZPD wird ImaGenes – Wirtschaftlicher Erfolg ermöglicht Änderung der Rechtsform GenomXPress 3/07, 2007 Services Neo-baroque institute building in Berlin The scope of services was constantly expanded and included the provision of genomic cell clones and cDNA databases, cell cultures, microarrays, expression profiles, Affymetrix services and PCR offers.

It took its name from the date of the 1934 right-wing putsch against the Popular Front in France which was defeated by various left-wing groups. History The \\"Sixth of February\\" Battalion was founded on 20 December 1936 but did not become active until 31 January 1937. It was formed mainly by French and Belgian volunteers, although it also included Algerian, Moroccan, Tangerine, Greek, Syrian, American, Chinese, Jewish Palestinian and Hungarian troops. The name of the unit was in reference to the violent demonstration of 6 February 1934 in Paris, which was led by far-right leagues against the left-wing French parliament. Until mid-1937, it was part of the XV International Brigade. The Frenchman Gabriel Fort was its commander until 12 February 1937, when he was severely wounded during the Battle of Jarama, where the unit fought between 11 and 27 February. Then, the Romanian Émile Schneiberg took command until his death two days later in the same battle. On 4 August 1937 it was moved to the XIV International Brigade, and comprised three companies of riflemen. The 1st Company had a machine-gun section. Gabriel Fort was designated commander again on 7 August, but lost his vision in Villanueva de la Cañada during the following fights. It was part of the XIV International Brigade Bis between 27 September 1937 and 23 February 1938, but it belonged again to the XIV until its dissolution on 22 April 1938.

The mine has coal reserves amounting to 1.48 billion tonnes of coking coal, one of the largest coal reserves in Asia and the world. The Ensham mine has an annual production capacity of 2 million tonnes of coal. Ensham consists of six pits on either side of the Nogoa River. Operations currently utilise the open-cut method of mining. Extraction is conducted by dragline and truck and shovel operations. A transition to underground mining is required to access the highest quality coal. Coal is transported to port via the Blackwater railway system. As thermal coal prices declined in 2012 mining operations were reduced to 40% of capacity and a further round of permanent job cuts was announced. Flooding The mine was inundated by floods in January 2008. Two pits were left filled with water. One dragline was submerged in 15 metres of water. Total mine damages have been estimated at around $300 million. Because of precaution such as the construction of flood protection levees after the 2008 flood the mine was not affected by the 2010–11 Queensland floods.

His motive is not entirely clear, although he was undoubtedly a double agent who acted as a spy for both French and British governments, and was on the point of being charged with treason by the British authorities. Personal malice against Harley, who was responsible for having Guiscard's English pension cut in half, may also have been a motive. Career  He was born into a distinguished family, being a younger brother of the Count de Guiscard who was appointed the first French Governor of Namur, although his right to call himself a Marquis has been disputed. He became a priest, but his notorious debauchery made it impossible for him to continue in that calling. He then embarked on a career as a soldier, joining his brother in a number of military campaigns, but was expelled from the French Court for a serious though unspecified offence. In revenge he joined the Camisard rebellion against the French Crown, and when it failed he began wandering around Europe, offering his services to any foreign Court hostile to France. He arrived in England in 1705, where he attempted to interest the authorities, such as diplomat Richard Hill, in a series of largely impractical schemes to defeat the French. Hill reported that Guiscard would be able to incite revolt among the Catholics in Dauphiné and Languedoc as well as provide access to a host of French agents working under Louis XIV. He further substantiated these claims to Hill by claiming to carry a vial of poison with him in case pursuing agents of the French King found him. By 1706, he had convinced Queen Anne's government to pay him a pension of 600 guineas as well as entertain the thought of leading an invasion of Normandy in support of the previously mentioned uprising. To this end, he was given command of a regiment to land at Normandy and incite the revolt but the landing ultimately never took place. This, in combination with no meaningful intelligence or impact eventually led to a steady decline of Guiscard's credibility among the British court as well as a decrease income. The attempt on Harley's life  In 1711, enraged by his lack of reward, he began a counterplot with the French Crown, which was quickly detected, leading to his arrest and his appearance before the Council, where he attempted to kill Harley. Why he was allowed into the Council meeting carrying a knife is unknown: the most likely explanation is that he had not been searched thoroughly enough, as the British Government at the time was surprisingly lax about security. Harley, though stabbed and bruised, recovered: his survival was generally attributed to the fact that he was wearing an ornate gold brocade waistcoat, which acted as a shield against the penknife. In the ensuing fracas Guiscard was attacked by several members of the Council and fatally wounded, most likely by James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde. Guiscard implored Ormonde to finish the deed, but Ormonde refused, saying that it was not for him to cheat the hangman. Belatedly the Council realised that Guiscard should be kept alive for questioning, and some effort was made to preserve his life, but he died just over a week a later in Newgate Prison. The unsuccessful attempt to murder Harley had major political consequences. Harley's popularity, which had been on the decline, recovered at once, as a wave of rejoicing at his survival swept the country, and even his enemies praised his courage in the face of danger.

Together both mines are referred to as the Gregory Crinum complex. The complex is owned by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance. In mid 2013, the Crinum mine contained 8.3 million tonnes of coal and was forecast to continue extraction for another four years. Operations at the Crinum mine began in 1997 and it employs about 200 people. Longwall mining at Crinum finished in 2007. Crinum received the Queensland Mining Industry Health and Safety Innovations Award in 2009 for a safety guard which prevents falls onto a coveyor belt.  Sale of Mine  On 27 March 2019, BMA completed the sale of the mine to Sojitz Corporation for A$100 million. In addition to the sale of the mine to Sojitz, BMA is providing appropriate funding for rehabilitation of the site, with all rehabilitation liabilities transferred to Sojitz.  Closure  In September 2012, it was announced that production at the mine was to cease on 10 October 2012. Due to falling coal prices the mine had become uneconomic. The Crinum underground mine was not closed and the coal handling preparation plant at Gregory would continue to be used. Floods Severe flooding affected operations at the mine in 2008.

He was born in 1944 in Hama. He is the eleventh Supreme Guide of the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood, taking over from Ali Sadreddine Al-Bayanouni from August 2010 until 6 November 2014. Mohammad Farouk Tayfour served as his deputy.  Early life  al-Shaqfeh was born in Hama in 1944 into a family of well known scholars. His father, Sheikh Khalid al-Shaqfeh, was President of the Society of Hama.\\"Engineer\\" Mohammad Riad Khaled Shaqfa He attended High School in Hama, graduating in 1963, and then studied at the University of Damascus's Faculty of Engineering, graduating with a bachelors in Civil Engineering in 1968.  Muslim Brotherhood career  al-Shaqfeh joined the Muslim Brotherhood in 1961, whilst he was still in High School. He became a member of the Muslim Brotherhood Management Centre in Hama in 1978, and then Head of the Centre in 1979. He left Syria at the end of 1980. He was elected to the leadership of the Brotherhood in 1983, and became a member of the Executive Committee of the National Alliance to save Syria in 1990, and a member of the Alliance's Political Bureau in 1999. In July 2010 the General Committee of the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood met in Istanbul for their leadership elections. The group elected al-Shaqfeh to succeed al-Bayanouni as Supreme Leader. A month after his election al-Shaqfeh declared his intent to continue the suspension of anti-government activities by the Muslim Brotherhood, and spoke in October 2010 of his hope of resolving issues with the Syrian government through the help of Turkey. He also expressed a willingness to change the name of the organisation, were his other demands met, and the group allowed to return to Syria, although there was no response from the Syrian government.  Role in the Syrian Civil War  At the beginning of the protests the Brotherhood, under the auspices of al-Shaqfeh, refrained from participation, only issuing a statement on the protests at the end of April 2011. The statement called for the overthrow of the Syrian government. The Brotherhood later took part in the establishment of the Syrian National Council in Istanbul in October 2011, and was believed to be the most powerful group within the Council. The Brotherhood was represented by al- Shaqfeh and his deputy, Mohammad Farouk Tayfour.  Views  During a 2012 interview with Dubai TV, al-Shaqfeh stated that the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood desired the return of the Golan Heights to Syria, and would pursue the return with all means available, including potential military force. Shaqfeh also stated that the Muslim Brotherhood did not believe a post-revolutionary Syria would ever recognise Israel, which he called \\"alien to this region.\\" On the issue of Hatay Province, which is claimed by Syria although controlled by Turkey, al-Shaqfeh claimed the issue would be discussed eventually, although the focus should be on the Golan Heights. This prompted the interviewer to accuse the Brotherhood of playing down claims to Hatay due to the Brotherhood perceived closeness to the Turkish government.

The mine has coal reserves amounting to 970 million tonnes of coking coal, one of the largest coal reserves in Asia and the world. The mine has an annual production capacity of 5.5 million tonnes of coal. In 2011, seven million tonnes of coal were produced. The mine is operated by Glencore Australia and owned by Queensland Coal, Nippon Steel Australia, Marubeni Coal and Sumisho Coal Development. Resources at the site were originally discovered in 1968. Construction of the Hail Creek mine began in 2001. Production at the open-cut mine began in 2003. Extraction is done by the dragline, truck and shovel method. Two seams are mined. These are the Elphinstone Seam, average thickness of 6.4 metres and Hynds Seam, averaging 8.3 metres in thickness. Coal is exported via the Goonyella railway line. In early 2011, production was halted ahead of Cyclone Yasi. As a result of severe monsoon rain force majeure was declared and not lifted at Hail Creek until May 2011. In February 2013, the operators of the mine were fined $2,200 for a breach of environmental guidelines when it released water from the mine. The relatively low penalty was criticised as a slap on the wrist. Glencore began operational management of Hail Creek mine from 1 August 2018 after the completion of a deal that saw Glencore acquire Rio Tinto’s 82% interest in the Hail Creek coal mine and adjacent coal resources, as well as its 71.2% interest in the Valeria coal resource. The investment reflects Glencore's focus on identifying high quality assets that complement our existing operations and marketing capabilities.

The mine has coal reserves amounting to 158 million tonnes of coking coal, one of the largest coal reserves in Asia and the world. The mine has an annual production capacity of 4 million tonnes of coal. Both hard/semi hard coking coal and thermal coal is mined. The mine was previously known as Gordonstone Mine. The Kestrel Mine is owned by the Kestrel Joint Venture which comprises Kestrel Coal Resources and Mitsui Kestrel Coal Investment. The mine has been managed by Rio Tinto Coal Australia until 2018 when it was sold to Kestrel Coal Resources( a joint venture between EMR Capital and Adaro Energy). In October 2013, the Kestrel South coal mine extension was opened. The extension allowed for an increased production of six million tonnes a year. The mine's life was extended by 20 years. During part of 2013 and through 2014 operations at Kestrel North were wound down. A 7.9 km overland conveyor is used to transfer coal to a coal handling and preparation plant. Coal is then transported by the Blackwater railway system to the Port of Gladstone for export. Customers are mainly located in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Europe, India and China.  Industrial dispute  The mine was the subject of a long-running workers' strike from October 1997 to August 1999, commemorated in the heritage-listed Lilyvale Stand Monument.

The robust quantization of these electronic phases is due to strong localization of electrons in their disordered, two-dimensional potential. But, at the quantum Hall transition, the electron gas delocalizes as can be observed in the laboratory. This phenomenon is understood in the language of topological field theory. Here, a vacuum angle (or 'theta angle') distinguishes between topologically different sectors in the vacuum. These topological sectors correspond to the robustly quantized phases. The quantum Hall transitions can then be understood by looking at the topological excitations (instantons) that occur between those phases.  Historical perspective  Just after the first measurements on the quantum Hall effect in 1980, physicists wondered how the strongly localized electrons in the disordered potential were able to delocalize at their phase transitions. At that time, the field theory of Anderson localization didn't yet include a topological angle and hence it predicted that: \\"for any given amount of disorder, all states in two dimensions are localized\\". A result that was irreconcilable with the observations on delocalization. Without knowing the solution to this problem, physicists resorted to a semi-classical picture of localized electrons that, given a certain energy, were able to percolate through the disorder. This percolation mechanism was what assumed to delocalize the electrons As a result of this semi-classical idea, many numerical computations were done based on the percolation picture. On top of the classical percolation phase transition, quantum tunneling was included in computer simulations to calculate the critical exponent of the \`semi-classical percolation phase transition'. To compare this result with the measured critical exponent, the Fermi-liquid approximation was used, where the Coulomb interactions between electrons are assumed to be finite. Under this assumption, the ground state of the free electron gas can be adiabatically transformed into the ground state of the interacting system and this gives rise to an inelastic scattering length so that the canonical correlation length exponent can be compared to the measured critical exponent. But, at the quantum phase transition, the localization lengths of the electrons becomes infinite (i.e. they delocalize) and this compromises the Fermi-liquid assumption of an inherently free electron gas (where individual electrons must be well-distinguished). The quantum Hall transition will therefore not be in the Fermi-liquid universality class, but in the 'F-invariant' universality class that has a different value for the critical exponent. The semi-classical percolation picture of the quantum Hall transition is therefore outdated (although still widely used) and we need to understand the delocalization mechanism as an instanton effect.  Disorder in the sample  The random disorder in the potential landscape of the two- dimensional electron gas plays a key role in the observation of topological sectors and their instantons (phase transitions). Because of the disorder, the electrons are localized and thus they cannot flow across the sample. But if we consider a loop around a localized 2D electron, we can notice that current is still able to flow in the direction around this loop. This current is able to renormalize to larger scales and eventually becomes the Hall current that rotates along the edge of the sample. A topological sector corresponds to an integer number of rotations and it is now visible macroscopically, in the robustly quantized behavior of the measurable Hall current. If the electrons were not sufficiently localized, this measurement would be blurred out by the usual flow of current through the sample. For the subtle observations on phase transitions it is important that the disorder is of the right kind. The random nature of the potential landscape should be apparent on a scale sufficiently smaller than the sample size in order to clearly distinguish the different phases of the system. These phases are only observable by the principle of emergence, so the difference between self-similar scales has to be multiple orders of magnitude for the critical exponent to be well-defined. On the opposite side, when the disorder correlation length is too small, the states are not sufficiently localized to observe them delocalize.  Renormalization group flow diagram  309x309px On the basis of the Renormalization Group Theory of the instanton vacuum one can form a general flow diagram where the topological sectors are represented by attractive fixed points. When scaling the effective system to larger sizes, the system generally flows to a stable phase at one of these points and as we can see in the flow diagram on the right, the longitudinal conductivity will vanish and the Hall conductivity takes on a quantized value. If we started with a Hall conductivity that is halfway between two attractive points, we would end up on the phase transition between topological sectors. As long as the symmetry isn't broken, the longitudinal conductivity doesn't vanish and is even able to increase when scaling to a larger system size. In the flow diagram, we see fixed points that are repulsive in the direction of the Hall current and attractive in the direction of the longitudinal current. It is most interesting to approach these fixed saddle points as close as possible and measure the (universal) behavior of the quantum Hall transitions.  Super-universality  If the system is rescaled, the change in conductivity depends only on the distance between a fixed saddle point and the conductivity. The scaling behavior near the quantum Hall transitions is then universal and different quantum Hall samples will give the same scaling results. But, by studying the quantum Hall transitions theoretically, many different systems that are all in different universality classes have been found to share a super-universal fixed point structure. This means that many different systems that are all in different universality classes still share the same fixed point structure. They all have stable topological sectors and also share other super-universal features. That these features are super-universal is due to the fundamental nature of the vacuum angle that governs the scaling behavior of the systems. The topological vacuum angle can be constructed in any quantum field theory but only under the right circumstances can its features be observed. The vacuum angle also appears in quantum chromodynamics and might have been important in the formation of the early universe.

Origin  Clan Ewen of Otter claimed descent from Donnsleibhe, who was said to be a descendant of an Irish prince of the O'Neill dynasty named Ánrothán Ua Néill, who left Ireland for Kintyre in the 11th century. He was a son of Áed, son of Flaithbertach Ua Néill, King of Ailech and Cenél nEógain, died 1036. There are several other Argyll clans which claim a descent from this prince--Clan Lamont, Clan Maclachlan, Clan MacNeil of Barra, and also the MacSweens who left Scotland to settle in Ireland in the 14th century. From this descent, these clans claim a further descent from the legendary Niall Noigíallach, High King of Ireland, who lived from the mid 4th century to the early 5th century. The only genealogy to survive regarding Clan Ewen of Otter, is the so-called MS 1467, now held in the National Library of Scotland. The Gaelic manuscript was written in 1467 and contains the genealogies of many Scottish clans. Unfortunately the MacEwen genealogy is practically unreadable in places. The MS 1467 was uncovered by W. F. Skene in the early 19th century, who transcribed and translated it. The following is his translated transcription for the MacEwens of Otter: Contradicting Skene's transcription (above), Niall Campbell, 10th Duke of Argyll, considered the MacEwens of Otter as a branch of the MacSweens, and thus descended from Dugald, son of Suibne (who is thought to have left his name to one of the oldest stone castles in Scotland--Castle Sween). Another origin suggested by earlier writers posited descent from the 13th-century Ewen Mac Dunslebhe, whose brother Fearchar is the ancestor of Clan Lamont. However, there is no obvious reason to doubt that the clan took its name from the Ewen listed in the genealogy of MS1467 above. This would date the foundation of the Clan Ewen of Otter to the first half of the fourteenth century.  History  The chiefs of the clan lived at Otter, on Loch Fyne. Their castle, 'MacEwen Castle' was located on the rocky shore of the loch, near Kilfinan. Ruins of the castle are still present in the area. In March 1432, Swene MacEwen resigned his title to the Barony of Otter to his feudal lord, King James. The king restored Swene to his title, but designated Gillespie Campbell (heir to Duncan Campbell of Lochow) as heir to the Barony of Otter. When Swene died in 1493, the barony passed into the hands of the Campbells. Since the death of Swene the line of chiefs of the MacEwens of Otter has been untraced, however according to tradition, a MacEwen clan arrived in the earldom of Lennox \\"under a chieftain of their own\\" during the fifteenth century; the same tradition, which refers to a new banner, suggests that the clan chief was granted arms by Mary Queen of Scots at some time before her defeat at The Battle of Langside in 1568.

It is one of the most common cause of acute hepatitis and liver failure in the horse. Signs and symptoms There is a rapid onset of clinical signs over the period of 2–7 days, beginning with anorexia, lethargy, and hyperbilirubinemia (icterus and discolored urine). Signs of hepatic encephalopathy (ataxia, blindness, aggression, and coma) and fever can also occur. Other signs include photodermatitis, hemorrhagic diathesis, dependent edema, and colic. The reason for colic is unknown, but is thought to be due to rapid decrease in the size of the liver, and the increased risk of gastric impaction. Rarely, weight loss can occur. Cause The most current theory is a result of a recent study that suggests it is caused by a pegivirus, referred to as Theiler's disease- associated virus (TDAV).Chandriani S, Skewes-Cox P, Zhong W, Ganem DE, Divers TJ, Van Blaricum AJ, Tennant BC, Kistler AL (2013) Identification of a previously undescribed divergent virus from the Flaviviridae family in an outbreak of equine serum hepatitis. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 110(15):E1407-15. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1219217110 Eight horses that had received prophylactic botulinum antitoxin and developed subsequent signs of Theiler's disease were subjected to a test for a viral infection based on RNA sequencing techniques. When TDAV was found, the original source of virus (the antitoxin) was injected into 4 additional healthy horses, with one displaying increased liver enzymes and all 4 having increased levels of TDAV, showing that the virus can be spread by inoculation. Measuring levels of virus in the originally infected horses has shown that the disease can become chronic, with some horses displaying low virus levels one year after initial infection. All horses that were initially negative remained so, suggesting that the virus is poorly transmitted horizontally. However, not all horses that tested positive for this virus showed clinical signs, so additional causative factors such as immune mediated hypersensitivity or co-infections with other agents may be required to produce disease. Diagnosis At present this can only be made definitively by liver biopsy or post mortem examination. Given the isolation of a causative virus it should soon be possible to diagnose this by serology, polymerase chain reaction or viral culture. On necropsy, the liver will be small, flaccid, and \\"dish-rag\\" in appearance. It has a mottled and bile stained surface. On microscopy there is marked centrilobular to midzonal hepatocellular necrosis and a mild to moderate mononuclear infiltrate. Mild to moderate bile duct proliferation may also be present. On radiology, the liver may be shrunken and difficult to visualize on ultrasound. Ascites may be present. =Lab tests= The most characteristic feature are elevated levels of gamma glutamyl transferase (100–300 IU/L), aspartate transaminase (>1000 IU/L) and sorbitol dehydrogenase, with AST levels > 4000 IU/L indicating a poor prognosis. High levels of unconjugated and total bilirubin, and serum bile acids, can be seen. Moderate to severe acidosis, leukocytosis, polycythaemia, increased creatine kinase and hyperammonemia may be present, and hemolysis can occur at the end stage. The prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is often prolonged. Subclinical horses may only show elevated liver enzymes without any other clinical signs. Horses are rarely hypoglycemic, but blood glucose monitoring is ideal to indicate which horses may be benefited by glucose treatment. =Differential diagnosis= This is quite extensive and includes *acute infectious hepatitis *acute mycotoxicosis *acute pyrrolizidine toxicosis *haemolytic disease *hepatotoxins Treatment There is currently no specific therapy. Intravenous fluids and treatment of the hepatic encephalopathy may help. Increasing dietary levels of branched chain amino acids and feeding low protein diets can help signs of hepatic encephalopathy, which is often accomplished by feeding small amounts of grain and/or beet pulp, and removing high-protein feedstuffs such as alfalfa hay. Grazing on non-legume grass may be acceptable if it is late summer or fall, although the horse should only be permitted to eat in the evening so as to avoid photosensitization. Due to the risk of gastric impaction, stomach size should be monitored. Sedation is minimized and used only to control behavior that could lead to injury of the animal and to allow therapeutic procedures, and should preferably involve a sedative other than a benzodiazepine. Stressing the animal should be avoided if at all possible. Plasma transfusions may be needed if spontaneous bleeding occurs, to replace clotting factors. Antibiotics are sometimes prescribed to prevent bacterial translocation from the intestines. Antioxidants such as vitamin E, B-complex vitamins, and acetylcysteine may be given. High blood ammonia is often treated with oral neomycin, often in conjunction with lactulose, metronidazole and probiotics, to decrease production and absorption of ammonia from the gastrointestinal tract. Prognosis This depends on the degree of hepatocellular necrosis that has occurred. Decreases in the SDH and prothrombin time along with improvement in appetite are the best positive predictive indicators of recovery. GGT may remain elevated for weeks even if the horse is recovering. Horses that survive for greater than one week and that continue to eat usually recover. Cases with rapid progression of clinical signs, uncontrollable encephalopathy, haemorrhage or haemolysis have a poor prognosis. Horses that display clinical signs have a mortality rate of 50–90%. Epidemiology This condition most commonly occurs after the administration of a horse origin biological agent such as equine-derived antiserum, and usually occurs 4–10 weeks after the event. Diseases that have been vaccinated against using equine-origin antiserum, resulting in subsequent Theiler's disease, include: African horse sickness, Eastern and Western Equine Encephalitis, Bacillus anthracis, tetanus antitoxin, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum, Streptococcus equi subspecies equi, Equine influenza, Equine herpesvirus type 1, pregnant mare's serum, and plasma. Although it occurs sporadically, It appears to be spreadable within a premises, and there have been outbreaks occurring on farms involving multiple horses over several months. In the Northern hemisphere it is most common between August to November. It is seen almost exclusively in adult horses, and lactating broodmares given tetanus antitoxin post foaling may be more susceptible. History This disease was described in 1919 by Arnold Theiler, a South African veterinary surgeon, after vaccinating horses against African horse sickness using a live virus vaccine and equine antiserum. It was later described in the United States after vaccinating horses for Eastern Equine Encephalitis, again using live virus vaccines and equine-derived antiserum. It has since been reported throughout North America and Europe.

The film version was directed by series producer Edward J. Montagne and its supporting cast includes Carl Ballantine, Gavin MacLeod, Jean Willes, Claudine Longet, and George Kennedy. The film was followed by a sequel entitled McHale's Navy Joins the Air Force which did not feature Borgnine or Carl Ballantine. Another film, also called McHale's Navy, was released in 1997 with a completely different plot and an entirely different cast except for Borgnine playing a 75-year old McHale. In nearly every way the 1964 film is merely an extension of the TV series and allows fans of the TV series to see the show in vibrant color. Even the film location for New Caledonia is identical to the one used in the series. For more information on the main characters see the TV series McHale's Navy. The movie was released on DVD for Region 1 on January 31, 2011. https://www.amazon.com/McHales-Navy-Universal-Vault- Series/dp/B004LLIRTA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1381244536&sr;=8-1&keywords;=McHale%27s+Navy+1964+movie The film was released following the end of the second season of the television series. Plot Set \\"Somewhere in the South Pacific\\" in 1943, Gruber's gambling scheme backfires when he tries to raise money for St Theresa’s Orphanage through off-track horserace betting. Heavy bets on the horse \\"Silver Spot\\" leaves the crew owing a large sum to sailors and marines. A little while later when the crew is in New Caledonia, Ensign Parker runs PT-73 into the dock and destroys the dock and cargo of businessman Henri Le Clerc (George Kennedy), leaving the crew even more in debt. However, while on a reconnaissance mission to an island the crew comes across Silver Spot who was lost on the island after the horse was being moved from Australia. They decide to enter Silver Spot in a race in New Caledonia to win enough money to pay all their debts. Otherwise the only way to pay all their debts is for McHale to marry his old flame Margot Monet (Jean Willes), also known as Maggie Monahan, who owns a gambling parlor in New Caledonia (but who McHale would rather not marry). They try to disguise the horse with much heavy hair, but when the hair starts to come off during the race they decide to use a smoke screen from the 73 to keep anyone from seeing too much. However, this made it impossible for the racetrack authorities to know who won. But the smokescreen also caused a Japanese submarine to be captured by the 73. In the end Le Clerc is so grateful for saving his town from a Japanese attack he forgives the debt. The crew also gets a reward for rescuing Silver Spot which just happened to be enough to pay the sailors and marines. While all this was going on the Pt-73 crew was dogging Binghamton (Joe Flynn) and his aide Carpenter (Bob Hastings). And just as they were leaving New Caledonia the bashful Parker is kissed by Bouchard and the lightheaded Parker sets off a depth charge which destroys Le Clerc's dock and cargo again. But rather than marry Monet to pay for the new damage, McHale and crew immediately scramble to get out of New Caledonia.

Series supporting players Joe Flynn and Tim Conway are the leads for this sequel to the first movie made in 1964 also named McHale's Navy. Most of the film is based on their two characters particularly Ensign Parker. Series star Ernest Borgnine was unavailable due to a scheduling conflict while he appeared in the 1965 film The Flight of the Phoenix. However, in a Cinema Retro interview, Borgnine said the producer Edward Montagne wanted to make the film cheaply, without him and would not show him the script.Cinema Retro interview Carl Ballantine also doesn't appear in the movie and the PT-73 crew is not seen in large portions of the film. The movie, which also features Ted Bessell, was directed by series producer Edward Montagne. Except for Quinton McHale (Ernest Borgnine) and Lester Gruber (Carl Ballantine) the film features all the main characters from the TV series. The film is titled \\"McHale's Navy Joins the Air Force\\" and similar designations on the TV show are U.S.A.F.. Since the film is situated \\"Somewhere in the South Pacific 1943\\" this would be historically inaccurate. Until 1947 the Air Force was part of the U.S. Army and was known as the U.S. Army Air Forces (U.S.A.A.F) beginning in 1941. (However, the opposite could be said otherwise about the title as many armed servicemen colloquially referred to the Army Air Force (U.S.A.A.F.) as the \\"Air Force\\" for short during the time period the movie is set in.)

Carpenter's (Bob Hastings) PT-116. While in Brisbane, Binghamton orders the PT-73 crew to remain on board, but they switch uniforms with Russian crewmen on the adjoining docked ship so they can leave the ship without being noticed. In a mix up Parker (Tim Conway) switches uniforms with Lt. Harkness (Ted Bessell) who then is mistakenly arrested by the Russian NKGB and put on the Russian ship, but he later escapes and spends the entire movie trying to get back. Parker impersonates Lt. Harkness with Binghamton helping him until Harkness comes back. Because of Harkness's reputation as a lady killer women are drawn to the very shy Parker. Parker also has to avoid General Harkness (Tom Tully) who is Lt Harkness's father for fear of being found out. In the meantime Harkness (or rather Parker) is promoted three times to Lt. Colonel by unwittingly scoring three military victories. Even after being found out, Parker is by then too big a hero and the military brass decide to sort of cover up the whole mix up of Parker pretending to be someone else. At the end of the film Parker does an impressive impersonation of then President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Cast Joe Flynn ... Captain Wally Binghamton Tim Conway ...

It was aired on July 1, 2013. The episode was written by Michael Taylor and it was directed by Michael Nankin Plot During a debate between Datak (Tony Curran) and Amanda (Julie Benz) in the town square, Nolan (Grant Bowler) shoots a young Castithan aiming a rifle at the stage. The apparent assassination attempt is turns out to be a prank set up by Alak (Jesse Rath), and the dead 'shooter' one of his friends. The killing causes Nolan to lose the public's support, and Datak seizes the opportunity to oust him as Lawkeeper. Secretly contacting Earth Republic he digs up dirt on Nolan's past as a marine in the Pale Wars. Broadcasting his finding to the town as Nolan tries to make amends with the dead youth's family. Seeing that his past is coming to light, Nolan goes to Amanda's office and resigns. He confronts and beats Datak but is stopped from killing him by Irisa (Stephanie Leonidas), and the two decide to leave Defiance. Alak ponders his role in his friend's death, asking his father why he suggested the prank knowing what might happen, but is stopped from asking further questions. Later Alak tries to give his respects to his friend's parents but is rejected. While out he is assaulted by men on Rafe's (Graham Greene) order. Rafe tells him that he is disappointed in him, and is beginning to question letting him marry Christie (Nicole Muñoz). Warning him that the time he disappoints him he will have him killed. Meanwhile, Kenya (Mia Kirshner) goes to the Tarr residence to see Stahma (Jaime Murray). Accusing her of knowing that Datak set up Nolan, asking how she can love such a ruthless man. Stahma explains that she loves Datak because of how cold and ruthless he is and not for being kind. Kenya berates her and threatens to expose their relationship to the town, doing it to hurt Stahma rather than to affect their respective family's political standings. Stahma pretends to be unfazed to dissuade Kenya, knowing how damaging the truth would be, turning her back on her. Datak meets an Earth Republic official, planning to grant ER the town's mines once he becomes mayor in exchange for their support. In her lab, Yewll (Trenna Keating) experiments on the gold artifact she took from Nicky. She discovers that it is connected to Irisa and is causing her great pain every time it is activated. As Nolan and Irisa prepare to leave, Yewll activates it, causing Irisa to collapse. Nolan brings her to Yewll's office, and after telling Nolan to stay outside, she operates on Irisa's back and finds strand like appendages coming out of her and connecting with ones coming from the gold artifact. During the \\"operation\\", Irisa has a vision of her past, showing a silver object, identical to the gold one, melding with her body. Awaking she knocks out Yewll and escapes. Nolan enters the lab to find it ruined with Irisa gone. Irisa chases the girl she saw in her vision through the woods. Falling unconscious, she is found by Rynn (Tiio Horn) who debates whether to kill her or not after what Nolan did to Sukar. The girl from Irisa's vision watches in the distance.

Rowan Kaiser from The A.V. Club gave an A- grade to the episode saying: \\"The most effective way to build a setting that will support good storytelling is to give the world a solid history. [...] Defiance has a solid history, which makes it a good example of why the historical approach to world-building works.\\" Jim Garner from TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.3/5 saying that next week's finale episode had a lot to cover. Lisa Macklem from Spoiler TV said that this week's episode had much intrigue. \\"Next week we have the election. Datak has clearly allied himself with the Earth-Republic, and Amanda may regret not doing so herself – though I think that is unlikely. I suspect that Datak will win the election and come to regret the alliance himself.

Mariano de Avila (right) The San Sebastian Cathedral is a late 19th-century church in Bacolod, Negros Occidental in the Philippines. It is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bacolod. History A small village inhabited by Malayans called Magsungay was placed under the protection of St. Sebastian by early Christian missionaries during the 1700s. This village was later came to be known as San Sebastian de Magsungay and was put under the governance of Bernardo de los Santos, the village’s first gobernadorcillo. Due to widespread Moro pirate attacks, the people of Magsungay moved to a new settlement upon the hilly terrain called bakólod, the precursor of the modern-day city of Bacolod. In 1806, Fr. Leon Pedro was appointed as its first parish priest. Years later, Fr. Gonzaga, a young priest from Barcelona, would envision the construction of the San Sebastian Church. =Original church= Fr. Julian (or Juan) Gonzaga, from Barcelona, Spain, the parish priest from 1818-1836, constructed the original church in 1825. It was made of wood with galvanized iron roof. The church initially possessed a medium-sized bell. Donations of other church bells were made by Fr. Roman Manuel Locsin, who gave a large one, and Fr. Mariano de Avila, who gave another when he became the parish priest in 1863 after the death of Fr. Locsin. =Stone church= Plaque on the wall of the church Construction of the structure in its present form began on 27 April 1876 under the leadership of Fr. Mauricio Ferrero, OAR. Prison labor was provided by the politico-military Governor, Roman Pastor, who prevailed upon Fr. Ferrero to also design and supervise the construction of a stone prison, the old Provincial Jail. Coral stone from the island of Guimaras was used as the primary building material. Hardwood from trees in Palawan was used for wooden portions of the structure. Fr. Mariano de Avila's bell was installed in the bell tower during the church's construction. Bishop Mariano Cuartero of the Archdiocese of Jaro consecrated the church on the eve of the feast of Saint Sebastian, 19 January 1882. The following day Bishop Cuartero celebrated pontifical mass before a congregation of government and Church officials of the province and Iloilo, parish priests and leading citizens. =Bell towers= In 1885, construction of the two bell towers commenced. The right tower was constructed first. Don Luis Ruiz de Luzurriaga donated a large clock which was mounted on this structure. The left tower was then constructed. The towers were made of aluminum sheet framed in hardwood. That year, the church organ was installed in the narthex, above the church entrance. The church was declared a cathedral in 1933 when Bacolod became a diocese. During the centennial celebration of the Cathedral in 1976, the bells were transferred from the belfry to the churchyard.Bacolod City Government. \\"Places of Interests.\\" Retrieved 2 May 2014. =Reconstructions= San Sebastian Cathedral facade Bishop Manuel Yap consecrated the cathedral in solemn ceremonies presided over by the Apostolic Nuncio on 7 March 1956 after renovation. The main altar was simplified and a life-size statue of Saint Sebastian was enshrined. The cathedral again underwent renovation under the then-Vicar General and Bacolod parish priest, Antonio Fortich, who became the third Bishop of the Diocese of Bacolod in 1967. In 1969, the Bacolod City Engineer’s office declared the bell towers a public hazard; Fr. Mariano de Avila's bell was removed from the belfry and the structures were subsequently demolished. The church organ was also disassembled and never returned to its original place, as was Fr. de Avila's bell. The cathedral's rector, Fr. Antonio Santes, then raised funds to rebuild the towers in their present form. In 1976 the Lions Club of Bacolod had a special belfry built where today Fr. de Avila's bell hangs, along with Fr. Mauricio Ferrero’s smaller bell.

Mauricio Ferrero also constructed the parish rectory, which is now the Bishop’s house. Construction began on 21 May 1891 and was completed in 1894. The wood came from Palawan, while the coral stones were from Guimaras. The bricks were locally made, and labor was mostly by Chinese masons. Patron saint Saint Sebastian as depicted by Il Sodoma The San Sebastian Cathedral is named in honor of Saint Sebastian, an early Christian saint and martyr more commonly known in the Philippines as San Sebastian. The Spanish missionaries had placed Magsungay, the village that was the precursor of the modern city of Bacolod under the care and protection of Saint Sebastian sometime in the middle 1700s. Luis Fernando de Luna (1777-1779), a corregidor, donated a relic of the Saint for the growing mission, and the village came to be known as San Sebastian de Magsungay. Pro-cathedral On December 25, 1994, then-Bishop of the Diocese of Bacolod, Monsignor Camilo Gregorio declared the San Diego Parish Church a pro-cathedral of the San Sebastian Cathedral.

In the beginning, there were questions concerning the purchase of a house for which Wulff had accepted a loan from an entrepreneur family with whom he was friends. In this context, Wulff tried to influence media coverage before the scandal became public. Additional investigations were started into Wulff's political dealings with various entrepreneurs with whom he and his family spent their private vacations. Since it was not clear who had paid for these holidays, Wulff was subsequently accused of favoritism and unethical behavior. The district attorney's office in Hanover requested the lifting of Wulff's immunity on February 16, 2012. He resigned as German President the next day. He was acquitted of all corruption charges in February 2014. Background In January 2010, German media reported that Christian Wulff, then Minister-President of Lower Saxony, had accepted a complimentary flight upgrade from Air Berlin for a family trip to Miami on September 15, 2009. In doing so, he violated ministerial laws of Lower Saxony, which prohibit members of state government from accepting gifts worth more than 10 Euro. Subsequently, Wulff paid Air Berlin the 3,000 Euro the flights would have cost. Following this incident, the Green faction in Lower Saxony's state parliament began a parliamentary inquiry to find out more about business dealings between Wulff and Egon Geerkens, a local entrepreneur. Responding to the inquiry, the State Chancellery of Lower Saxony denied any business relationship between Wulff and Geerkens. In June 2010, Wulff was elected German President. Following rumors about possible favors obtained by Wulff in connection with the purchase of a house in early 2009, the news magazine Der Spiegel contacted the local registry of deeds on December 14, 2010 to request access to his files. The request was denied on December 16, 2010, prompting Der Spiegel to call on the Higher Regional Court in Celle to overturn that decision. After that court only partially overturned the earlier determination, Der Spiegel appealed to the Federal Court of Justice, which sustained the appeal and ordered the registry of deeds to grant the news magazine access to Wulff's files. On October 20, 2011, Der Spiegel accessed the registry of deeds and discovered that the house had a lien of 500,000 Euro against it and that the Stuttgart-based BW Bank had provided a financing loan of 415,000 Euro. Loan scandal In an email sent to Wulff on November 28, 2011, the German tabloid Bild requested additional information concerning the details of the house purchase. On December 5, 2011 Olaf Glaeseker, then Wulff's spokesperson, provided a copy of the loan agreement, which showed that entrepreneur Erich Geerkens’ wife Edith had loaned 500,000 Euro to Wulff in the fall of 2008. The loan had a very favorable interest rate of only four percent and contained no provisions for repayment. On December 10, 2011, Bild contacted Wulff again by email and asked why he had not disclosed the loan contract with Edith Geerkens when responding to the parliamentary inquiry in February 2010 and whether he had tried to deceive the state parliament of Lower Saxony. In addition, “Bild’ requested detailed information about financial transactions between Geerkens and Wulff. At the time of this request, Wulff was on an official visit to Dubai. On December 12, 2011, Bild reported the loan from Edith Geerkens to Wulff and raised the question whether he had misled Lower Saxony's State Parliament in February 2010. On December 13, 2011, the German Federal Presidential Office confirmed Edith Geerken's loan to Wulff and declared that he had correctly responded to the parliamentary inquiry, as the funds were provided by Mrs. Geerkens and that there was therefore no business relationship between Wulff and Egon Geerkens. On December 15, 2011, Wulff issued a written statement reiterating that he did not have a business relationship with Mr. Geerkens and that he had correctly responded to the parliamentary inquiry. At the same time, he expressed regret that he may have created a wrong impression. Wulff declared that he had paid back Edith Geerkens in full in March 2010 by taking on a short-term, flexible- interest rate loan from Stuttgart-based BW-Bank through contacts arranged by Egon Geerkens. In the meantime, Wulff said, the loan had been converted into a long-term loan. In an article published on December 16, 2011, Der Spiegel quoted Egon Geerkens as saying he had led the loan negotiations with Wulff. While the money did indeed come from his wife's bank account, Egon Geerkens stated that he had signed the cheque and given it to Wulff. On December 18, 2011, Wulff's lawyers published a list of personal holiday trips where he had been a house guest with friends. Six such trips were listed between 2003 and 2010, including stays with Mr. and Mrs. Geerkens, with Carsten Maschmeyer and Wolf-Dieter Baumgartl. One day later, journalists were given access to this list along with documents pertaining to the controversial loan. On December 21, 2011, Wulff's lawyer confirmed that Egon Geerkens was involved in the loan negotiations and that he also participated in the prior search for a suitable property. The following day, Wulff suddenly relieved his long-time spokesman and advisor Olaf Glaeseker of his duties. German media reported that Glaeseker tendered his resignation because of fears that the ongoing investigation could compromise his family's privacy. On December 22, 2011, Wulff also held a press conference where he apologized for his conduct in connection with the loan scandal. Wulff conceded that he should have made his personal records available more quickly, \\"that was not straightforward and I am sorry,\\" he said. At the same time, he stressed his desire to stay in office and asked the German people trust him. That same day, the district attorney's office in Hanover also announced that it would not start a formal investigation into Wulff's loan dealings. In the evening of December 22, reports surfaced that in March 2010, the government of Lower Saxony under Wulff may have given a false response to a parliamentary inquiry related to the funding and organization of the so-called \\"Nord-Sued Dialog\\", an event designed to promote the public image of the states of Lower Saxony and Baden-Wuerttemberg. In March 2010, the state government of Lower Saxony had denied any financial or organizational ties to this event, which had been organized by the event manager Manfred Schmidt. On December 27, 2011, it became known that the supervisory board of BW-Bank, which had provided Wulff with a loan to pay back the Geerkens loan, requested additional information concerning this transaction as the bank had previously not been informed of the loan. On December 30, 2011, BW-Bank provided the German public with the details of its business relationship with Wulff. Accordingly, the first talks between Wulff and the bank started in December 2009 and were arranged by Egon Geerkens. On March 21, 2010, these negotiations led to the signing of a \\"short-term, flexible-interest rate loan\\" which Wulff used to pay back Edith Geerkens. On December 12, 2011, the bank sent Wulff a contract to convert the short-term flexible interest-rate loan into a long-term loan. BW-Bank received the contract signed by Wulff on December 21. The contract mentions January 16, 2012 as the start date. Critics charged that Wulff had not yet finalized the long-term loan when he made his public statement on December 15, 2011. In response, Wulff's lawyers declared that the interest rate for this loan had already been fixed as of November 15, 2011. On December 31, 2011, Der Spiegel raised the question whether the conditions of Wulff's BW-Bank loan were somehow connected to his role in the takeover of Porsche by Volkswagen. As member of the Volkswagen supervisory board, Wulff played an important role in making the takeover possible. However, all parties concerned denied any connection to the BW-Bank loan. Media scandal On December 31, 2011 it was reported that Wulff had tried to call Bild editor-in-chief Kai Diekmann on December 12, 2011, one day before the tabloid's first article on the loan scandal. Wulff, who was on a state visit to the Persian Gulf at the time, left an aggressive message on Diekmann's mailbox and threatened to take legal steps against the relevant journalists if Bild were to publish the article. In this context, Wulff also spoke of a \\"final break\\" and \\"war\\" between him and Bild. Furthermore, Wulff also tried to intervene by calling Matthias Doepfner, CEO of Axel-Springer, the publishing house that owns Bild, and left a similarly aggressive message on his mailbox. Doepfner called Wulff back but rejected his demands. Two days later, Wulff apologized to Diekmann for his message. After Wulff's attempts to interfere with Bild, coverage of the loan scandal became public he was widely criticized. TV interview and 400 questions On January 4, 2012, Wulff was interviewed by both the ARD and ZDF German national television channels. Wulff admitted personal wrongdoing, and referred to his call to Kai Diekmann as a \\"grave mistake\\". Wulff indicated that by calling Diekmann he had only tried to delay, but not to prevent publication of the article. In contrast, Wulff defended both his private vacations with entrepreneur friends and the personal loan from Edith Geerkens. Wulff declared that journalists had sent him a list of more than 400 questions, and announced that he would publish all questions and answers on the Internet. Kai Diekmann rejected Wulff's characterization of his mailbox message and asked for the president's permission to make the recording public. Wulff did not authorize the release of the message. In contrast to Wulff's earlier announcement that all questions and answers related to the loan scandal would be published online, his law firm issued only a six-page summary on January 5, 2012 and placed it online, as a press release. On January 10, 2012 Wulff's lawyer declared that attorney-client privilege prevented a more detailed release of information. Within a week several newspapers began making use of their right to publish their own enquiries with the respective responses. On January 18, 2012 after a barrage of criticism from within Wulff's own party, including Chancellor Merkel, his lawyer released a total of 237 pages with question and answers related to the loan scandal and put it online. His lawyer also presented online transcripts of legally released interviews by journalists. David Groenewold and Nord- Süd-Dialog On January 14, 2012 it was reported that David Groenewold´, a media executive, had invited the Wulff couple to the Octoberfest 2008 in Munich and covered part of their hotel bill - without their knowledge, according to Groenewold. On January 16, 2012 the district attorney's office in Hanover declared that there was not yet an initial suspicion but that investigations were still ongoing - especially in light of Wulff's hotel upgrade paid for by Groenewold that had just become public. In connection with Nord-Süd-Dialog it was reported on January 18 that Wulff had become actively involved in contacting potential sponsors. A spokesperson for Talanx, an insurance company, confirmed that its CEO Herbert Haas had been approached by Wulff. Talanx ended up sponsoring the event to the tune of 10,000 Euro. On January 19, 2012 the district attorney's office in Hanover searched the home and offices of Wulff's former spokesman Olaf Glaeseker as part of its investigation into potential corruption in connection with Nord-Süd-Dialog. The raid was based on accusations that Glaeseker, during his time in public office, had strongly promoted the event's organization and fundraising activities in exchange for free personal holidays in the vacation homes of Nord-Süd-Dialog event manager Manfred Schmidt. Schmidt's offices were also searched on the same day. On January 20, 2012 it became known that the state chancellery of Lower Saxony led by Wulff was actively involved in conducting Nord-Süd-Dialog in 2009. For example, Wulff's then-spokesman Olaf Glaeseker had requested 44 students from the Hanover's Medical University as service personnel but had failed to pay the subsequent invoice sent by the state of Lower Saxony. Furthermore, Glaeseker had instructed the Lower Saxonian agriculture ministry to pay for 800 cook books that were distributed to the guests of the Nord-Sued-Dialog. A few days later, on January 24, 2012 it was confirmed that Glaeseker had also reached out to potential sponsors of the Nord-Sued-Dialog 2009 on behalf of Wulff. On January 26, 2012 the district attorney's office in Hanover ordered a search of Glaeseker's former office in the German Federal Presidential Office and seized various documents and computers. Developments leading up to the Resignation On January 30, 2012, it became known that Egon Geerkens had been a client of Wulff's former law firm until 2004. Furthermore, Geerkens had rented office space to the law firm until 2007. In response, the law firm declared that Wulff had not worked for them since 1994. This was confirmed by Wulff's lawyer. Following media reports that the Wulff couple had benefited from exceptionally favorable conditions in connection with the leasing of an Audi Q3, the district attorney's office in Berlin began an investigation into potential favoritism. Wulff's lawyer and Audi rejected the allegations. In this context, Audi declared that the agreed monthly leasing rate of 850 Euro was \\"in line with market conditions\\". On February 8, 2012, there were media reports about a joint vacation of the Wulff family and David Groenewold on the island of Sylt that was booked and paid for by Groenewold. In this context, Wulff declared that he had immediately reimbursed Groenewold for his share of the hotel bill in cash when he checked out of the hotel. As David Groenwold had previously received credit guarantees from Lower Saxony worth several million Euro, German media reported on February 9, 2012 that the district attorney's office in Hanover had started an investigation into potential favoritism charges in connection with the Sylt vacation. On February 16 the district attorney's office in Hanover requested the lifting of Wulff's presidential immunity due to well-founded initial suspicions of favoritism and unethical behavior. On February 17, 2012, Wulff resigned as German Federal President. Explaining his resignation, Wulff stated that \\"(the German people's) trust and thus his effectiveness have been seriously damaged\\" and that \\"for this reason it is no longer possible for him to exercise the office of president at home and abroad as required.\\" A new presidential election was required within a month to elect his successor. Until a new President was elected, Horst Seehofer of the Christian Social Union (CSU) was acting president. The new president, Joachim Gauck, was elected on 18 March by a Federal Convention. Further developments After the request by the district attorney's office in Hanover to lift Wulff's immunity had been leaked to the press, there were media reports that the prosecutors had questioned Wulff's explanation that he reimbursed Groenwold in cash when checking out of the hotel in Sylt in August 2008. The investigations showed no corresponding withdrawals on Wulff's bank account that would back up his claim. In view of Wulff's negative account balance leading up to the Sylt vacation, prosecutors deemed the possibility that Wulff had kept a cash gift from December 2007 until August 2008 as \\"economically unwise\\". On February 26, 2012, further details emerged regarding the cash gifts that Wulff received in December 2007. According to Wulff, he received 1,000 euro as a birthday present and a Christmas present of 2,500 euro from his mother-in-law to his wife Bettina. Six days after receipt of the birthday gift, the Wulffs left for a Sylt vacation in December 2007. Regarding the Sylt trip in August 2008, the district attorney's office said that they had questioned Wulff's cash reimbursement explanation because there was an eight-month gap between the Christmas gift in December and the Sylt vacation in August 2008, and because Wulff's bank account was in the red by more than 10,000 euro in July 2008. On March 1, 2012, the district attorney searched David Groenewold's home and offices with his permission and seized a large volume of documents and data. One day later, the district attorney searched Wulff's personal home and seized one computer among other things. Since the search was conducted with the permission of the Wulff family, no search warrant was required. On June 1, it became known that the district attorney's office in Berlin had closed its probe into allegations that Wulff had engaged in unethical behavior in connection with, among other things, the leasing of an Audi Q3. The investigation did not yield firm evidence backing up the accusations. In January 2013, a report by the State Police Office in Hanover became public indicated that the investigators were not able to find evidence of corruption that could be used in court. Wulff's mother-in-law had confirmed his statement regarding the cash gifts to her daughter. According to Wulff, he had used the money to pay for the hotel. Furthermore, investigators confirmed the legality of Wulff's room upgrade at a Munich hotel by David Groenewold in 2008. Since Wulff had the right to be reimbursed for this trip by the State of Lower Saxony, he did not derive a personal benefit from the upgrade. According to the investigators, this refuted the claims of corruption levelled at Wulff. On January 26, 2013, German media reported about a letter from David Groenewold to Wulff dated September 29, 2008. The letter had been turned over by the State Chancellery of Lower Saxony to the district attorney's office in Hanover in late 2012. In the letter, Groenewold had asked Wulff for support in the marketing of his movie John Rabe. In particular, the letter referred to the Siemens which Groenewold had not yet managed to secure as a sponsor. In late 2008, Wulff wrote a letter to Siemens CEO Peter Loescher and asked him to support the movie. The district attorney's office subsequently called on two of Wulff's former aides as witnesses in the investigation. In February 2013 further details emerged about Wulff's personal finances between 2007 and 2011. According to the district attorney leading the investigation, Wulff found himself in a permanently strained financial situation with a bank account that was at times more than 80,000 in the red. In March 2013 the Hanover district attorney offered to settle the case in exchange for a fine. On April 9, Wulff announced that he had rejected this deal. Three days later the prosecution filed corruption charges against Wulf. The only remaining allegation against him concerned a Munich hotel and food bill of 770 euro paid by Groenwold. On August 27, 2013, the Hanover regional court announced that it would try Wulff on accepting unfair advantages, after downgrading the initial corruption charges. On February 27, 2014, two years after his resignation, Christian Wulff was acquitted of all corruption charges by the Hanover regional court.

Opened on 12 November 2012 and costing $50 million, the theatre encompasses an area of making it the third largest theatre in the Middle East. Construction Plans for the construction of a new theatre originated in 2003 but had been delayed due to unknown reasons. The establishment of a new and larger theatre would alleviate pressure on the aging 670-seat Cultural Hall theatre, which had struggled with hosting theatrical events during the Spring of Culture programs. In December 2007, the Works and Housing Ministry officially launched the project, having unveiled a conceptual design and scheduled construction to begin in June 2008 and to be completed by June 2010. Unknown reasons caused the delay of the project's construction until 2011. The theatre itself was constructed on the demolished site of the Bahrain Heritage Village, which itself was a constructed in the 1980s and meant to be a replica of a typical Bahraini village. The Heritage Village was relocated to Arad in the neighbouring island of Muharraq in December 2009 to save costs. Construction officially began June–July 2011 and carried on until November 2012. In July 2012, it was feared that the theatre's construction would not be completed in time to coincide with the country's already-scheduled culture programs. As a result, the Works ministry drafted a total of 700 people to work on the site, 625 of which worked during daylight and the rest during the night to ensure that no delays occurred. The main entrance's steel poles were fixed in July 2012 as well as the cladding walls of the main auditorium. Air conditioning units, leather and glass materials were put in place in the last months of construction. Design View of the theatre and a dhow from Muharraq island. The theatre was designed by the French company Architecture-Studio, with Atkins serving as the local consultant. Other consultants were Theatre Projects Consultants, SETEC Bâtiment, XU Acoustique and L'Observatoire. The theatre's structure was built as a cubic glass shaped building, alongside an artificial lake which was meant to provide a promenade for visitors, with the roof coated in gold colouring- some commentators have dubbed the theatre as having an \\"Arabian Nights theme\\". The architects wanted the roof to create a \\"shimmering gold jewel\\" effect and as a result, the stainless steel cladding panels were measured down and sent to a British company Rimex to add an unidentified compound to produce this effect. The foyer's floor is made of Paloma stone from Italy, with the walls being made of glass which allows visitors to obtain an unblocked view of the lagoon outside. The glass relied on a unique glazing system that involved using 54mm thick glass panels that acted as the main structural component in holding the main glass in place. These main glass pieces were high and were bonded with the glass fins of the structure using a special type of silicone with an Aluminium extrusion. Each glass fin weighed up to 800 kg. The vertical columns supporting the roof were kept relatively narrow by designing a thick steel tube filled with concrete to serve as the wall. This was achieved by setting the columns in place and then having a cement slurry poured inside to stiffen them. The building's air-conditioning units had to be out of view of visitors for aesthetic reasons and a vent system has been designed that encompasses the entire perimeter of the building which brings cool air through hidden grilles between the glass. The 1001-seat auditorium's interior is clad with acoustically deafened Canadian Elmwood, which was meant to give visitors the impression of being on a Dhow. In fact, the 1001 seats symbolically represent the Thousand and One Arabian Nights. The seats face an long stage in a raked seating method that was designed to improve the viewpoint for the audience. The forestage and proscenium, which covers an area of 19,000m x 10,500m, of the stage were specially modified to present a variety of different methods of staging, with the orchestra pit lying on top of Serapid LinkLift Systems to alter the size of the stage and auditorium. The Orchestra Pit Lift is made up of two halves for versatility. A seating wagon can be moved manually to fill the orchestra pit to enlarge the auditoriums capacity. The 150-seat studio theatre has dual purposes and can be used to host conferences and rehearsals as well as serving as a small theatre, with different seating arrangements and staging configurations. These seats and configurations can be transported around using a retractable seating unit and a demountable platform system where configurations can be constructed from a ready-made kit. Opening The theatre was opened as scheduled on 12 November 2012 in an opening ceremony attended by the King of Bahrain Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa. In his opening speech, he praised Bahraini members of the literary world and also praised Shaikha Mai bin Mohammed Al Khalifa, the culture minister who first suggested the construction of the theatre. In November 2012, the theatre hosted its debut performance with Plácido Domingo performing at a waterfront concert, just days after the theatre opened. The second performance was Russian ballet gala organized by the Bolshoi Ballet Company in December 2012.

It is located close to the town of Deal in Kent, South-East England. Belonging to the Middle Anglo- Saxon period, it was part of the much wider tradition of burial in Early Anglo-Saxon England. Mill Hill was an inhumation-only cemetery, with no evidence of cremation. Location Mill Hill is close to the foot of the North Downs dip-slope, forming a 2 kilometre ridge of Upper Chalk. The cemetery lies on the south-east end of this ridge, adjacent to two disused chalk quarries opposite Deal Waterworks. The site on which it was located is now under two housing developments, Walmer Way and Fairview Gardens, on the south west side of St. Richard's Row on Mill Hill, Deal. Background The Kingdom of Kent. With the advent of the Anglo-Saxon period in the fifth century CE, the area that became Kent underwent a radical transformation on a political, social, and physical level. In the preceding era of Roman Britain, the area had been administered as the civitas of Cantiaci, a part of the Roman Empire, but following the collapse of Roman rule in 410 CE, many signs of Romano-British society began to disappear, replaced by those of the ascendant Anglo-Saxon culture. Later Anglo-Saxon accounts attribute this change to the widescale invasion of Germanic language tribes from northern Europe, namely the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. Archaeological and toponymic evidence shows that there was a great deal of syncretism, with Anglo-Saxon culture interacting and mixing with the Romano-British culture. The Old English term Kent first appears in the Anglo-Saxon period, and was based on the earlier Celtic-language name Cantii. Initially applied only to the area east of the River Medway, by the end of the sixth century it also referred to areas to the west of it. The Kingdom of Kent was the first recorded Anglo-Saxon kingdom to appear in the historical record, and by the end of sixth century, it had become a significant political power, exercising hegemony over large parts of southern and eastern Britain. At the time, Kent had strong trade links with Francia, while the Kentish royal family married members of Francia's Merovingian dynasty, who were already Christian. Kentish King Æthelberht was the overlord of various neighbouring kingdoms when he converted to Christianity in the early seventh century as a result of Augustine of Canterbury and the Gregorian mission, who had been sent by Pope Gregory to replace England's pagan beliefs with Christianity. It was in this context that the Mill Hill cemetery was in use. Kent has a wealth of Early Medieval funerary archaeology. The earliest excavation of Anglo-Saxon Kentish graves was in the 17th century, when antiquarians took an increasing interest in the material remains of the period. In the ensuing centuries, antiquarian interest gave way to more methodical archaeological investigation, and prominent archaeologists like Bryan Faussett, James Douglas, Cecil Brent, George Payne, and Charles Roach Smith \\"dominated\\" archaeological research in Kent.

It is one of the few villages in the area which came directly under the Crown rather than being dependent on an estate. Its inhabitants were proud of their status as \\"free farmers\\". The village was an important halt for travelers with its inn, first documented in 1666. The village is first mentioned in the Danish Census Book (1231) as Stockæmarc. It was originally part of the village of Bregerup (then Brikathorp) which in the Middle Ages had a hospital for lepers known as \\"St. Jørgens Hospital\\", first mentioned in 1389. When Bregerup was demolished, Count Adam Christopher Knuth established Knuthenlund in 1729, a driving force for the Stokkemarke community. \\"Kongeriget Danmark / 3. Udgave 3.

It was once an independent municipality but was absorbed into Maribo Municipality following the local government reform in 1970. Since the 2007 reform it has come under Lolland Municipality. The rural community expanded in the 20th century thanks to the establishment of several machinery works, especially Poul Rees a/s, bringing prosperity to the village and providing employment. The village also had its own dairy, a soap factory and a juice facility for the Maribo Sugar Factory.\\"Stokkemarke og omegn - De frivillige foreningers landsby\\", Lolland.dk.

The centrally located church is dated to the mid-13th century with a fine 16th-century tower. Opposite the church, the former library now serves as a cultural center and a youth club. In addition to a food store, a flower shop and a bakery, the village has an antique dealer and a bank. There are currently plans for renovating the centre of the village while improving its institutions and ensuring road safety. Knuthenlund is receiving support for increased involvement in organic farming (accredited farming) and the production of goat cheese. There are also plans to convert the 18th-century Ørbygård which overlooks the sea into a hotel. Stokkemarke's associations and leisure facilities include a badminton club, a gymnastic society, a riding school and a youth centre. The village is well placed for rambling with possibilities for walks through the wooded surroundings. There are footpaths from the village to Knuthenlund and Hestehave.

Its life is estimated at 29 years. It is a joint venture between the Canadian mining company Sherritt (12%), who also serves as Ambatovy’s operator, Sumitomo Corp. (47.67%), Korea Resources Corp. (27.5%), and Ambatovy Holdings Limited (12.83%). Ambatovy is the largest investment in Madagascar’s history and has made nickel Madagascar’s top export item, accounting for 27% of exports in 2015. Ambatovy currently employs approximately 8,000 people, directly and through subcontractors, 90% of whom are Malagasy. The Mine, located in the Alaotra Mangoro region, is set on two nickel deposits, the Analamay and Ambatovy deposits, with estimated reserves of 125 million tonnes of ore. The Plant site is located on the eastern coast of the island in Toamasina and is connected to the Mine by a 220 km slurry pipeline. Ambatovy’s products are nickel (99.8% pure), cobalt (99.8% pure) and ammonium sulphate, byproduct of the metal refining process that is used in agriculture. Ambatovy’s nickel products have been listed on the London Metal Exchange since 2015. Ambatovy is becoming known for its efforts in corporate sustainability and environmental preservation and conservation. It is a pilot project for the Business and Biodiversity Offsets Project and routinely wins awards, such as the Green Star Award, in the Prevention and Preparedness category, and the Nedbank Capital Sustainability Award, both in 2015, for its activities and interventions in its communities. It also fosters local procurement and business creation, as well as supporting local hiring and community returns. It is impossible to estimate the indirect contributions of Ambatovy in local job creation but some international studies {link to World Bank CSRM report estimate the impact of the mining industry as two to five indirect jobs for every one directly employed individual. Timeline In November 2006, Ambatovy received its environmental permit. The construction period of the project ended in 2011 and first production of nickel was achieved in late 2012. In September 2012, the Malagasy Government authorized Ambatovy to operate. Commercial production was achieved in 2014 and Financial Completion was attained in 2015.

The film, written and directed by Gnana Rajasekaran, was shot back to back in the Tamil and English languages. The film was produced by the independent Indian production house Camphor Cinema, ventured by Srivatsan Nadathur, Sushant Desai, Sharanyan Nadathur, Sindhu Rajasekaran. The cast consists of Indian and British film, stage and screen personalities. It marks the Tamil debut of Abhinay Vaddi, the grandson of veteran Tamil film actors Gemini Ganesan and Savitri, as the protagonist. Featuring an ensemble cast of Suhasini Maniratnam, Bhama, Kevin McGowan, Abbas, Nizhalgal Ravi, Michael Lieber, amongst others in supporting roles, the film was set in the early 1900s, tracing the life of Ramanujan, and shot across five different locations, across India and England, which includes Kumbakonam, Namakkal, Chennai, London and Cambridge. The film features, music and background score composed by Ramesh Vinayagam, cinematography handled by Sunny Joseph and editing done by B. Lenin. Ramanujan was received Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Film in 2013, although the film had released, a year later. The film was released worldwide on 11 July 2014, across India and United Kingdom. It was released simultaneously in Tamil and English languages.  Plot  Set in the early 1900s, the film traces the life of the prodigious math genius Srinivasa Ramanujan from the time he was a young Tamil Brahmin to his years in England, where he attended Cambridge University during World War I. The film follows his relationships with his mother Komalatammal, his wife Janaki, and his collaborator Professor G. H. Hardy. The film also showcases how Indian society viewed a mathematician of such great stature.

Michael Lieber was signed to play Edensor Littlewood. Lieber confessed he had no knowledge of Ramanujan, when he signed the film, and went as far as to meet Béla Bollobás, who worked with Littlewood personally, for his research work. He found it difficult to speak the Tamil lines, but appreciated it later on, \\"I would be lying if I said that the task of learning Tamil was not daunting at first, but once I got the hang of it I was able to appreciate what a beautiful language it is. There were many different ways of learning the Tamil lines; some used audio tapes, prompting, flash cards, or word boards. I learnt the meaning of the words and memorised chunks of dialogue.\\" Similarly, Kevin McGowan, who was signed for the role of G. H. Hardy, was unfamiliar with the story of Ramanujan. The film also stars Bhama, Suhasini Maniratnam, Abbas and Richard Walsh amongst others. Sunny Joseph, best known for his high-profile Malayalam works with directors Adoor Gopalakrishnan and Shaji N. Karun, was signed as cinematographer. = Filming = The film has been shot in the five main locations of Ramanujan's life, Kumbakonam, Namakkal, Chennai, London and Cambridge. The first two schedules were shot in India while the third was done in England, where they took the permission of Cambridge University to shoot. The task to create a script in multiple languages was described by Sindhu Rajasekaran as \\"quite a chore. Roxane de Rouen and I are working with Gnana Rajasekaran, the director of ‘Ramanujan,’ to make the characters speak words that make them real. No, you wouldn't find roadside urchins who speak in Queen's English here; people would speak what comes to them naturally: Tamil, English, Indian English, even Tamenglish. What a delight it is to live in this world where languages are not borders, but an element to experiment with...\\" Music The film's soundtrack and score were composed by Ramesh Vinayakam. Vinayakam called it an honour to have composed music for the film and \\"an opportunity for me to travel on a new path\\" and added that he was given the required creative freedom by the director and producer. He said that he had to go classical for one part of the film and into European sounds for another segment. No modern instruments, but old world instruments were used in order to bring the period alive, while four orchestral pieces were recorded in Germany, where the composer worked with the Stuttgart-based GermanPops Orchestra that has worked on contemporary and classical styles. Being a film about a mathematician, the songs were related to mathematical terms as well. Poet Vaali had written a number, \\"Narayana Narayana\\", which was said to \\"incorporate the idea of infinity and nothingness\\", while another number, written by Thirumalisai Alvar thousands of years ago, \\"stresses that numbers are absolute\\". One of the instrumental tracks, \\"One to Zero\\" was described as a \\"musical metaphor\\" as it was based on the numbers, with Vinayakam explaining, \\"One is represented by one note, two by two notes and so on, while zero is represented by a rest. After the initial exposition, at any point of time, three of these layers criss-cross each other from a distance of one beat from each other\\". \\"Narayana\\" was sung by Vani Jayaram, who said that she was initially surprised that she was given a song whose pitch (shruthi) was less than what she usually sings in but came to know that, in the days of Ramanujan, people only sang in that pitch. The soundtrack album of Ramanujan was released at the Suryan FM radio station in Chennai on 13 June 2014. The album, which features eight tracks, including four songs and four instrumentals, was praised by critics. Indiaglitz in its review wrote, \\"Ramesh Vinayakam was always there and thereabouts with his wonderful albums in the past. With this album he has struck the right chords towards his name once again. This must be the break he's been looking for years\\". musicaloud.com gave it a score of 9 out of 10 and wrote, \\"Ramesh Vinayakam expertly draws from Carnatic and Western classical styles to produce one of the finest period film soundtracks ever\\". Behindwoods.com gave it 3 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"Ramanujan enthralls the listener by transporting them to a bygone era of classical music\\". Noted Malayalam film composer M. Jayachandran, praised Vinayakam for his music in Ramanujan. The album was also named by Deccan Music2014 Best of Tamil Music Deccan Music - 12 December 2014 and MilliblogMilliblog Annual Music Round Up Milliblog - 13 December 2014 as the best Tamil music album of the year 2014.  Release  The official trailer of the film was released on 16 June 2014. On 9 July 2014, the producers of Ramanujan arranged a special screening at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, receiving an invitation from the president Pranab Mukherjee. The film was simultaneously released in India and United Kingdom in Tamil and English languages on 11 July 2014. After the film's theatrical run, the makers released the VCD and DVD formats of the film in late 2014, which featured the making video, behind-the- scenes featurette, and deleted scenes from the film. Reception The film received mixed reviews from critics, who generally praised the acting but criticized the writing.

The rapid increase in the volume of raw event data generated by the digital world enables methods that go beyond typical analysis by demographics and other traditional metrics that tell us what kind of people took what actions in the past. Behavioral analysis focuses on understanding how consumers act and why, enabling accurate predictions about how they are likely to act in the future. It enables marketers to make the right offers to the right consumer segments at the right time. Behavioral analytics can be useful for authentication as for security purposes. It uses non-identifiable but individually unique factors to confirm who the user is. The identity of the user is authenticated in the background using factor such as mouse movement to typing speed and habits, login history network detail like IP address, browser used, etc. Behavioral analytics utilizes the massive volumes of raw user event data captured during sessions in which consumers use application, game, or website, including traffic data like navigation path, clicks, social media interactions, purchasing decisions and marketing responsiveness. Also, the event-data can include advertising metrics like click-to-conversion time, as well as comparisons between other metrics like the monetary value of an order and the amount of time spent on the site. These data points are then compiled and analyzed, whether by looking at session progression from when a user first entered the platform until a sale was made, or what other products a user bought or looked at before this purchase. Behavioral analysis allows future actions and trends to be predicted based on the collection of such data. Since the analysis requires collection and aggregation of large amounts of personal data, including highly sensitive one (such as sexual orientation or sexual preferences, health issues, location) which is then traded between hundreds of parties involved in targeted advertising, behavioral analytics is causing significant concerns about privacy violations. While business analytics has a more broad focus on the who, what, where and when of business intelligence, behavioral analytics narrows that scope, allowing one to take seemingly unrelated data points in order to extrapolate, predict and determine errors and future trends. It takes a more holistic and human view of data, connecting individual data points to tell us not only what is happening, but also how and why it is happening. Examples and real world applications Visual Representation of Events that Make Up Behavioral Analysis Data shows that a large percentage of users using a certain eCommerce platform found it by searching for “Thai food” on Google. After landing on the homepage, most people spent some time on the “Asian Food” page and then logged off without placing an order. Looking at each of these events as separate data points does not represent what is really going on and why people did not make a purchase. However, viewing these data points as a representation of overall user behavior enables one to interpolate how and why users acted in this particular case. Behavioral analytics looks at all site traffic and page views as a timeline of connected events that did not lead to orders. Since most users left after viewing the “Asian Food” page, there could be a disconnect between what they are searching for on Google and what the “Asian Food” page displays. Knowing this, a quick look at the “Asian Food” page reveals that it does not display Thai food prominently and thus people do not think it is actually offered, even though it is. Behavioral analytics is becoming increasingly popular in commercial environments. Amazon.com is a leader in using behavioral analytics to recommend additional products that customers are likely to buy based on their previous purchasing patterns on the site. Behavioral analytics is also used by Target to suggest products to customers in their retail stores, while political campaigns use it to determine how potential voters should be approached. In addition to retail and political applications, behavioral analytics is also used by banks and manufacturing firms to prioritize leads generated by their websites.

London: Black Dog Publishing, 2007, p. 204 Boris Pearlman was a classically trained violist from New York City. Life and work 1979 Boris Policeband 7\\" recording: Stereo / Mono Boris Pearlman became Boris Policeband after a live performance in 1976 during which he monitored, on headphones, police communications from a scanner and recited their chatter while he accompanied himself on electric violin. Boris was fascinated by cop culture and the often prosaic and sometimes poetic reality of law enforcement chatter. Over the years the cop- talk and violin-screech coalesced into discrete songs that at times recalls the dissonant violin playing of the Fluxus artist Henry Flynt. In 1978 Sylvère Lotringer conducted a one-page interview with Policeband (with a one-page photo) in Columbia University's philosophy department publication of Semiotext(e) called Schizo-Culture: The Event, The Book.Sylvère Lotringer & David Morris (Eds), Schizo-Culture: The Event, The Book, Semiotext(e), 1978, re-published in 2013, pp. 64-64 In 1979 Boris Policeband released a 7\\" recording called: Policeband: Stereo / Mono that was produced by artist Dike Blair. He also appears with two tracks on the no wave recording New York Noise Vol. 3 that was released in 2006.Various – New York Noise Vol. 3, Soul Jazz Records – SJR LP 147 His live noise music performances were extremely loud/edgy aggressive/dissonant, and even though most songs were under a minute long and a set rarely exceeded 10 minutes, Boris could quickly empty a room. That was something he took pride in. He appears in the film that Coleen Fitzgibbon and Alan W. Moore created in 1978 (finished in 2009) of a no wave concert to benefit Colab called X Magazine Benefit that documents a performance of Boris Policeband, along with those of DNA and James Chance and the Contortions. Shot in black and white super-8 the film captures the gritty look and sound of the music scene during that era. In 2013 it was exhibited at Salon 94, an art gallery in New York City.COLEEN FITZGIBBON AND ALAN MOORE: X MAGAZINE BENEFIT COLAB 1978, 2009 Boris, a self-proclaimed materialistic- socialist who practiced antidisestablishmentarianism,Sylvère Lotringer & David Morris (Eds), Schizo-Culture: The Event, The Book, Semiotext(e), 1978, re- published in 2013, p. 64 was a downtown post-punk club fixture. His days were spent combing through SoHo art galleries, as he was fascinated with conceptual art, and Lower East Side pawnshops for material to add to his collection of used books, sunglasses (which he was never seen without), and wristwatches. Every night he was in no wave clubs, like CBGBs, Tier 3 and the Mudd Club, where he leaned against a wall while listening to classical music with an ear plug on his transistor radio while engaging in snappy repartee and/or swapping insults with other club goers. Boris ended Policeband in the mid-80s to pursue classical viola.

Notable examples of buildings incorporating Pueblo Deco elements include the KiMo Theater in Albuquerque, New Mexico and the Arizona Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix, Arizona. Pueblo Revival style is associated with Art Deco's borrowing of non-Western stylistic elements, principally from Egyptian, Asian and Native American sources. The style emphasizes applied ornament, often in metalwork, together with extensive tilework and wall murals. Additional structures incorporating Pueblo Deco design include the El Navajo Hotel and the McKinley County Courthouse, both in Gallup, New Mexico.

The Greek geographer Herodotus (5th century BC) describes India, calling it (Roman transliteration: hē Hindikē chōrē, meaning \\"the Indian land\\"), after Hinduš, the Old Persian name of the Indus river and the associated satrapy of Sindh in the Achaemenid Empire. Darius the Great had conquered this territory in 516 BC. The Greek colonies in Asia Minor (western Turkey) were already part of the Achaemenid Empire since 546 BC and, thus, the Greeks and Indians came into contact with each other as subjects of the Empire.  Background  According to Herodotus 4.44, Scylax of Caryanda, a Greek explorer sailed down the length of the Indus in the service of Darius. Hecataeus of Miletus, around 500 BC, wrote about the geography and peoples of India. The Greek physician Ctesias also wrote about India. Most of these works have not survived in their original form but fragments are known through transmission by later writers. Not only individual Greeks, but also large groups of Greeks were forced to settle in Bactria (northern Afghanistan), who must have had prolonged contact with Indians. Herodotus's account is believed to be based on these accounts.  Description  The Greeks (or Persians) were not aware of the geography of India (or Asia in general) east of the Indus basin. Herodotus in 4.40 is explicit about India being on the eastern fringe of the inhabitable world, : \\"As far as India, Asia is an inhabited land; but thereafter, all to the east is desolation, nor can anyone say what kind of land is there.\\" (trans. A. D. Godley 1920) But he knew of Indians (Hindwan) living beyond the Persian province of Hinduš (3.101): : \\"These Indians dwell far away from the Persians southwards, and were no subjects of King Darius.\\" (trans. A. D. Godley 1920) In book 3 (3.89-97), Herodotus gives some account of the peoples of India; he describes them as being very diverse, and makes reference to their dietary habits, some eating raw fish, others eating raw meat, and yet others practicing vegetarianism. He also mentions their dark skin colour. :\\"The tribes of Indians are numerous, and they do not all speak the same language--some are wandering tribes, others not. They who dwell in the marshes along the river live on raw fish, which they take in boats made of reeds, each formed out of a single joint. These Indians wear a dress of sedge, which they cut in the river and bruise; afterwards they weave it into mats, and wear it as we wear a breast-plate. Eastward of these Indians are another tribe, called Padaeans, who are wanderers, and live on raw flesh. [...] There is another set of Indians whose customs are very different. They refuse to put any live animal to death, they sow no corn, and have no dwelling-houses. Vegetables are their only food. [...] All the tribes which I have mentioned live together like the brute beasts: they have also all the same tint of skin, which approaches that of the Ethiopians. [...] Besides these, there are Indians of another tribe, who border on the city of Caspatyrus, and the country of Pactyica; these people dwell northward of all the rest of the Indians, and follow nearly the same mode of life as the Bactrians. They are more warlike than any of the other tribes, and from them the men are sent forth who go to procure the gold. For it is in this part of India that the sandy desert lies. Here, in this desert, there live amid the sand great ants, in size somewhat less than dogs, but bigger than foxes. [...]\\" (trans. Rawlinson) In 3.38, Herodotus mentions the Indian tribe of the Callatiae for their practice of funerary cannibalism; in a striking illustration of cultural relativism, he points out that this people is just as dismayed at the notion of the Greeks practicing cremation as the Greeks are at that of eating their dead parents. In book 7 (7.65,70,86,187) and in 8.113 Herodotus describes the Indian infantry and cavalry employed in Xerxes' army. Only after the conquests of Alexander the Great and the emergence of the Indo-Greek kingdoms did the Mediterranean world acquire some first-hand knowledge about the region (conversely, Indians also became aware of the existence of the Greeks during this period, naming them Yavana in Sanskrit). By the 3rd century BC, Eratosthenes recognized \\"India\\" as terminating in a peninsula (reflecting a first grasp of the geography of the Indian Subcontinent) instead of just placing it generically at the far eastern end of \\"Asia\\". Eratosthenes was also the first Greek author to postulate an island Taprobane at the far south of India, later becoming a name of Sri Lanka. European knowledge of the geography of India did not become much better resolved until the end of Antiquity, and remained at this stage throughout the Middle Ages, only becoming more detailed with the beginning of the Age of Sail in the 15th century.

Life Léon-Emile Bazin was born in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1900. In 1915 he joined the firm of Henri Prost, where he met Albert Laprade and Joseph Marrast. In 1923 he enrolled in the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts, and graduated in 1930. In 1925 Bazin entered into a partnership with Albert Laprade that lasted until 1936. Bazin won a competition in 1929 for the Porte d'Honneur of the 1931 Paris Colonial Exposition, although only after accepting many modifications suggested by the jury. Bazin collaborated on many of Laprade's projects. These included the garage on Rue Marbeuf, which won much praise internationally, the Écho du Nord building in Lille and the Palais de la Porte Dorée for the 1931 Colonial Exhibition. Louis Bouquet created a painting named Souvenir du Musée des Colonies that depicts the men who worked on the Palais de la Porte Dorée: Laprade and Bazin, Bouquet himself, the sculptor Alfred Janniot and the interior decorator Jacques-Émile Ruhlmann. The painting also includes an anonymous black woman wearing only a skirt, resembling Josephine Baker, who represents the indigenous colonial people. Bazin worked with Laprade on the competition for the Génissiat Dam. Bazin left Leprade in 1936 to form his own agency. However, Laprade and Bazin worked together to design the Peace Monument in the Place du Trocadero for the 1937 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne. They also collaborated on the pavilion for diffusion of the French language and the pavilion and garden of Iraq. Bazin was appointed chief architect for reconstruction of the Loiret department in 1941. After the liberation of France in 1944 he was reappointed to this position, and in 1950 became consulting architect to Loiret and Loir-et-Cher. In 1947 he became consultant architect for Électricité de France and the Compagnie Nationale du Rhône and in this role undertook a number of power plants. He was appointed chief architect of civilian buildings and national monuments in 1959, and was attached to the Museum of African and Oceanic Art at the Palais de la Porte Dorée he had helped to build with Laprade. Following Louis Arretche he worked on the reconstruction of Saint-Malo, the housing estate at Melun and the new city of Orléans-La Source. Léon-Emile Bazin died in Paris in 1976 .

The two routes share the roadspace through the junction, along with a local road, the A598 Finchley Road / Regent's Park Road, together with some other local residential roads, and was described by Arriva London in 2011 as \\"a major hotspot for traffic congestion\\", with approximately 94,000 vehicles traversing the junction daily. London Buses route 102, which runs from Brent Cross Shopping Centre to Edmonton Green station, also goes through the junction. Other routes that cross the junction include the 13, 232 and 460. The junction was created as part of the construction of the Barnet Bypass, which opened in 1928, with future provision for the North Circular. It was designed as a dual carriageway junction, but due to the urban sprawl of London already surrounding it, meant that by the 1950s it had a 30 mph speed limit, traffic lights and pedestrian crossings. In 1967, the junction was widened from two to three lanes in each direction, which remains the basic configuration today. In October 2011, Britain's first \\"hands free\\" pedestrian crossing was installed at the junction, so that the local Jewish community did not have to use electricity or operate machinery on the Sabbath. Traffic is held every 90 seconds over this duration (sunset Friday to sunset Saturday), with foot traffic principally to and from Kinloss Synagogue. During 2011, the junction was also upgraded in order to improve traffic movements. Traffic between the North Circular Road and Finchley Road / Regent's Park Road was rerouted into a central area, as right turns had previously restricted other traffic movements. The improvements cost over £30 millioncitation needed. On 13 January 2012, the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson officially opened improvements to the junction, stating \\"This is a tremendous example of how we are improving London’s roads for every type of user.\\" External links * SABRE : Henlys Corner References Category:Road junctions in London Category:A1 road (Great Britain) Category:Finchley ","title":"Henlys Corner"},{"id":"39849713","text":"Andrey Kuznetsov was the defending champion but decided not to participate.

The Maternity package (, ) is a kit granted by the Finnish social security institution Kela, to all expectant or adoptive parents who live in Finland or are covered by the Finnish social security system. The package contains children's clothes and other necessary items, such as nappies, bedding, cloth, gauze towels and child-care products. It was first issued in 1938 to parents with a low income, and contained a blanket, crib sheets, diapers, and fabric which parents could use to make clothing for the baby. Since 1949 it has been given to all mothers-to-be, provided they visited a doctor or municipal pre-natal clinic before the end of their fourth month of pregnancy, and the pregnancy has lasted at least 154 days. The contents of the package are updated approximately every year. A mother may choose to take the maternity package, or a cash grant of 170 euros, but 95% of Finnish mothers choose the box because it's worth significantly more. Between 2006 and 2019, the total maternity grant program cost an average of 10.3 million euros per year, with 7 million being spent on maternity packages and 3.3 million given out as cash benefits or adoption grants. The maternity packages each year cost between 183 and 223 euros, averaging 190 euros each over the full 15-year period; an average of 37,000 are given out each year. Following a BBC story in June 2013, the baby box began to receive international attention. Similar packages, commercial or state-sponsored, are being trialled around the world. Private companies have started selling packages purporting to be the \\"Finnish baby box\\" or similar to it, but the original boxes are not sold commercially. Package Parts of the maternity package in 2014. In 1949, the box given was standard to all expectant mothers who visited a doctor before the fourth month of pregnancy per the Finnish Maternity Grants Act. A baby bottle was added to the package, but was removed in later packages to encourage breastfeeding. The requirement to visit a doctor as a prerequisite to receiving the package was done in order ensure that the woman received adequate prenatal care. The maternity package can either be applied for online, on Kela's website, or by completing and returning a form. The current package contents include bodysuits, a sleeping bag, outdoor gear, bathing products for the baby, nappies and cream, bedding, a hooded bath towel, nail scissors, hairbrush, toothbrush, wash cloth, muslin squares, a picture book, teething toy, bra pads, and condoms. It also contains a small mattress, allowing the box containing the package to become a crib in which many newborns have their first naps. Condoms are included by way of precaution, not as a discouragement, as a new pregnancy is possible within a few weeks of childbirth and many parents wish to have a little time between the births of their children. The maternity package is not a commercial product, and therefore Kela cannot sell it. Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge received a maternity package as a gift from Kela in 2013. Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel of Sweden were given one in 2012. Content of the package in 2017 In 2017 the box contained following items: * Snowsuit / sleeping bag * Insulated mittens and booties * Sleeping bag / blanket * Light-weight overall with hood 68–74 cm * Wool-blend coverall 68–74 cm * Wool cap * Balaclava hood * Cap * College overall / jumpsuit 62–68 cm * Romper suit * Wrap around body suit 50–56 cm * Bodysuit with extender 62–68 cm * Bodysuit 68–74 cm * Bodysuit 62–68 cm * 2 × Wrap around bodysuit 50–56 cm * 2 × Leggings 62–68 cm * 2 × Leggings 68–74 cm * 2 × Footed leggings 50–56 cm * Tights 62–68 cm * Socks and mittens 19–21 * Socks 19–21 * Sleeping bag / nightdress 62–68 cm * Bedding and linen  Blanket, off-white  Duvet cover with pattern of baby footprints on green background  White sheet  Protector 90 cm × 150 cm (can be used, for instance, as protection for the mattress)  Mattress * Pocket nappy and cotton gauze insert * Towel * Personal care items (bra pads, nail scissors, toothbrush, digital thermometer, talcum powder, nipple cream, condoms (6pcs), lubricant, sanitary towels, bath thermometer, hairbrush) * Feeding bib * Drooling bib / scarf * First book titled \\"Lystileikit vauvan kanssa” in Finnish and Swedish * Cuddly toy / comfort blanket Effects There is no evidence that the baby box has lowered infant mortality in Finland. However, there is great promise for the baby box's potential in public health, with reports soon forthcoming on this topic from Finnish research groups.https://research.uta.fi/babybox/ The program is now considered a part of the culture of Finland. As of June 2019, there had been one experimental study conducted on the use of baby boxes (a.k.a., \\"cardboard bassinets\\"), in combination with safe sleep education, for reducing bed-sharing, which is a risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and sleep-related deaths (SRD). Researchers at Temple University Hospital assigned study participants (i.e., mother-infant dyads) to one of the following conditions for postpartum hospital discharge: standard hospital discharge instructions; standard instructions plus additional safe infant sleep education based on the AAP safe infant sleep recommendations; or both types of instruction plus a gifted baby box from The Baby Box Company. The researchers concluded that the third condition (i.e., both types of instruction plus a gifted baby box) reduced the rate of bed-sharing during the first week of the infant's life (as self-reported by the participating mothers), particularly for exclusively breasfeeding mother-infant dyads. Similar programs in other countries =Argentina= In July 2015, Argentina's Ministry of Health under then-president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner introduced \\"Plan Qunita\\" which distributes maternity packages to parents of newborn babies. At the rollout of the program, about 144,000 Qunitas were issued. =Australia= The baby bundle provided to the parents of every baby born in New South Wales In Australia, the state of New South Wales began a program providing a baby bundle to the parents of every baby born from 1 January 2019. The bundle contains picture books, mats, a first aid kit, a sleeping bag, thermometers, and consumable child-care products such as cloths and wipes, with a total retail value of AU$300. Similarly, the state of Victoria began a baby bundle program starting from July 2019, for all first- time parents and carers. =Canada= In 2016, a program modeled on the Finnish baby box concept was launched in the northern territory of Nunavut, as a way of combatting its high infant mortality rate. =Scotland= A similar scheme in was introduced in Scotland in 2017. After a three-month pilot scheme in Clackmannanshire and Orkney, the Scottish \\"baby box\\" began to be issued to all parents with newborns in summer 2017, with over 52,000 such boxes issued in the first twelve months of the programme. =United States= In the summer of 2017, it was announced that the U.S. state of New Jersey would become the first state in the country to adopt the baby box program.

The plan, described as a \\"Labour Plan\\", was one of the foremost examples of De Man's doctrine of \\"Planisme\\" (state planning). The policy was aimed at \\"instilling a mixed economic system\\" by the creation of \\"a nationalized sector covering the organization of credit and the main industries which have already in reality been monopolized.\\" It was broadly similar to the Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1933 \\"New Deal\\" in the United States and the later SDAP's 1935 Plan of Labour in the Netherlands. Criticism Despite the support of the POB-BWP, the plan was criticized by many left-wing commentators. Leon Trotsky derided the plan as \\"a plan to deceive the toilers\\" and \\"a renovated instrument of bourgeois- democratic conservatism.\\" Trotsky further attacked the plan in a January 1934 article, entitled Revisionism and Planning, in the newspaper New International.

These poems were written in Sicily during the spring of 1882, where Nietzsche remained for three weeks after arriving from Genoa. In May 1882, those eight idylls were published in Internationale Monatschrift by Ernst Schmeitzner, Nietzsche's publisher at the time, with whom he would later sever all ties and whom he will eventually sue. They stem from the same voluminous amount of poetic attempts he took upon himself from February to April 1882, from which Nietzsche later composed his Vorspiel in deutschen Reimen to Die fröhliche Wissenschaft in 1882. From these eight poems, Nietzsche used six, in marginally modified form, for the Lieder des Prinzen Vogelfrei, the appendix for the second edition of Die fröhliche Wissenschaft in 1887.

It is native to the northern Western Ghats in India where it is split between three regions, Satara in Maharashtra, the Nilgiri mountains in Tamil Nadu and Kodagu district in Karnataka. Vulnerability R. satarae is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN due to it being restricted to less than 2,000 km2 of forest habitat that remains. The locations it is found in are highly fragmented and it is vulnerable to changes in its habitat. The species is facing a decline in the quality of its habitat and the number of mature individuals in the population. It is highly sensitive to changes in its habitat. The main threats faced by the species include loss of forests to plantations, logging, pesticide use, and planting of exotic species. Habitat The species has only been seen in the moist deciduous and evergreen forests of the northern Western Ghats are of India, between 700 and 2,150 m in altitude. It lives almost exclusively in nests or burrows in the middle or high canopy, only occasionally going to the ground near the base of a tree or vine. It eats fruits and insects. Appearance R. satarae has a long, soft coat with a golden brown back and white underside. Its tail is very long. It was originally described as a subspecies of the black rat (Rattus rattus) due to its similar appearance. However, DNA evidence has shown that they are two distinct species with no interbreeding despite them occupying the same habitat. Their similarities are thought to be due to convergence as a result of sharing the same ecological niche.

Early life Mike Greenstein was born in Wichita Falls, Texas on December 6, 1920 at a time when his father, legendary strongman Joe Greenstein (\\"The Mighty Atom\\"), was working in the oil fields in Texas. The family later moved to Brownsville, Brooklyn where the senior Greenstein began his shows as a miniature Samson in vaudeville and Yiddish theaters. The senior Greenstein soon earned the nickname the Mighty Atom. Around that time, the junior began training with his father and his three brothers at a young age. During World War II, he joined the Army Air Corps as mechanic MOS. During that time, his father was touring the country entertaining troops and did shows to raise money for war bonds. Inspired by his father, the younger Greenstein decided to start an act of his own to entertain the troops at the various bases he was stationed in by bending bars, breaking chains, and pulling passenger-filled cars with his hair or his teeth. He also performed shows at theaters in the towns near the bases where he was stationed at during his off duty liberty. He later attended aviation school in Manhattan, and subsequently worked at Trans World Airlines for 19 years. He also worked at local Waldbaum’s and photographed weddings. Career Living his later years in Rockaway, Queens, New York, Greestein was a strength athlete by profession, known as the Mighty Atom, Jr. He was capable of pulling a car with his bare teeth, nearly to his dying day. Greenstein was an active advocate of cancer prevention; his father had died of cancer, and his wife and daughter both predeceased him due to breast cancer. He was a contestant on season 9 of America's Got Talent at 93 years old and passed through the auditions round, but he was eliminated in the Judgement Round.

In particular, résistancialisme refers to exaggerated beliefs about the size and importance of the resistance and anti-German sentiment in German-occupied France in post-war French thinking. The term was coined by Rousso in 1987. He argued that résistancialisme rose among Gaullists and Communists soon after the war and became mainstream during the Algerian War. In particular, it was used to describe the belief that resistance was both unanimous and natural during the period, and justify the lack of historiographical interest in the role of French collaboration and the Vichy government. Rousso emphasises that résistancialisme should not be confused with \\"résistantialisme\\" (with a \\"t\\", literally \\"Resistor-ism\\") who is a pejorative term used by Jean-Marie Desgrange to criticize individuals who retrospectively exaggerated or faked their own involvement in the wartime resistance in an attempt to enhance their own status after the war, for instance François Mitterrand.  Context  Shaved women accused of having sexual relations with German soldiers forced to parade. The challenge for the French government in the aftermath of World War II was enormous. The end of German occupation immediately created an atmosphere of confidence and hope in the future and La Resistance became associated to this renewal. However, this positive and unitary attitude did not last. Soon, French people called for tougher measures against women and men suspected of collaboration. In addition to the legal purge () conducted by the French government from 1944 to 1949, France underwent a wave of public executions and humiliations known as the wild purge (). These purges included the execution of at least 9000 people, and the head shaving of women who had had relationships with the German enemy.de Gaulle's Liberation of Paris speech at the Paris City Hall on the 25th of August 1944. In this period of complete disorder and confusion, different voices from the resistance emerged; the two main voices being the Gaullist and the Communist. Hence the need for France to come up with a dominant unifying narrative that would later be referred to as the resistancialist myth, or simply resistancialism. This narrative presented the Vichy Regime as a parenthesis in French history which did not question \\"the righteousness of the French nation\\". The myth is often embodied by de Gaulle's Liberation of Paris speech, delivered at the Paris City Hall on the 25th of August 1944.  The construction of an official memory  At a time when the French territory had never been so fragmented, the resistancialist myth was introduced soon after the war, in 1947, in order to counter the emerging tensions of the Cold War and face the communist memorial discourse. The collectively built memory had the purpose of, in the words of French historian Pierre Laborie, \\"give a reassuring vision of the dark years\\" in minimizing the influence of Vichy in the French society and portraying the Résistance as having much more support that it actually had. = A selective memory = All discourse not in accordance with the official memory was to be carefully monitored. Censorship intervened in numerous cases where the Occupation was depicted too dramatically. For instance, movies such as Les Honneurs de la Guerre (1962) had to be modified several times in order to be released, because the role of the Milice was deemed too important. Another example is the removal of a scene which portrayed a French policeman participating in the arrest of Jews in Alain Resnais's movie Night and Fog (1956). The censors went not only to the point of amending fictions, they actually stood to hide actual facts and depictions of reality. When de Gaulle returned to power in 1958, he participated actively to the creation of the resistancialist myth. The memory of Résistance was sacralized and elevated as the cement of the French nation. Landmark events such as the transfer of the Jean Moulin's remains to the Panthéon are representative of such efforts. The message the government aimed to transmit was a syllogism, present in the famous discourse of Minister of Culture André Malraux at this event: if the Resistance is embodied by de Gaulle, and that de Gaulle represents France, then logically Resistance equals France. = The infringement in popular culture = This national narrative had also progressively come to shape popular culture. Cinema had been considered a useful tool both to create the myth in the aftermath of the war and to question it after 1968. The Battle of the Rails (La Bataille du rail) is 1946 a war movie by René Clément illustrating the French Resistance among railway workers which consisted in sabotaging the German rail network. This movie is one of the most famous French Résistance movie and greatly contributed to Resistancialism. A few years later, René Clément directed the historical film Is Paris Burning (1966) based on a book by Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre. This movie depicts the liberation of Paris staged by the French Resistance and the Free French forces. Not only did the aftermath of World War II French cinema silence the existence of collaboration to favor the myth of Resistancialism but it also buried the memory of foreign forms of resistance such as the Manouchian group.  Conflicting memories  = Communists and Gaullists = The Carrefour Marcadet metro station was renamed Guy Môquet in 1946, when the Rue Balagny was renamed in honour of a symbol of the French Resistance, Guy Môquet, who was killed at the age of seventeen. The Communists were the quickest to present themselves as the inheritors of the Liberation. Dubbing themselves the \\"party of the 75,000 martyrs\\", whereas about 35,000 French in total, and not all communists, were executed. The communists “probably lost only a few thousand men to German firing squads”, but the figure of 75 000 became an accepted truth and contributed to the legacy of the resistance remaining central to the Party's identity. Right after the Liberation, several ceremonies were held honoring fallen communists and eighteen squares and streets in Paris were almost immediately renamed after communist martyrs. The Gaullist party was also keen to take ownership of the legacy of the resistance. The official discourse was that, apart from a few traitors, France had supported the French Résistance and France had liberated itself alone. The central power invested time and energy to make the occupation look like a dark parenthesis, insisting on the idea that the Vichy regime did not represent France. Among these efforts were for example the Ordinance of 9 August 1944, which rendered all the legislation enacted since 16 June 1940 null and void, the renaming of the avenue Maréchal Pétain in avenue Dr Louis Mallet who had been a French Résistant, or the refusal to proclaim the restoration of the Republic on August 24 at the Hôtel de Ville as it implied that it had for a moment ceased to exist. The goal was to separate the image of France from the one of Vichy. Traces of the construction of that myth can be found in the de Gaulle's speeches during the Liberation and at the end of the war. For instance, during his first speech on a liberated French territory on 14 June 1944, de Gaulle assured the inhabitants of Bayeux to \\"continue the struggle today, as you have not ceased to do since June 1940\\". When he returned to power as a result of the political crisis of 1958, de Gaulle reinforced the mythology of the Resistance, notably though the pantheonization ceremony of Jean Moulin. While both factions shared differences with each other, there was consensus between both on that “the Resistance had represented the real France and incarnated the true feelings of the French people throughout the Occupation”. This helped foster and spread the myth of a highly-resistant France during the Occupation period. = Dissenting and silenced memories = The myth of the resistance became so overpowering that it for a long period of time, it squeezed out alternative memories of the Occupation period. Many resistants were for instance critical of the idea that a majority of the french population had taken part in the Resistance. The resistance fighter Alban Vistel expressed this frustration, stating that \\"it is time to unmask a pious myth which has not really deceived anyone. The great majority of the people of this country played only a small and fleeting part in the events. Their activity was passive, except at the last moments”. While traditional conservatism and the far-right in France had been discredited due to its role in the Vichy government, many rehabilitated former collaborators challenged the prevailing Resistance narrative. Rather than attacking the Resistance as a whole, they created the term \\"resistentialism\\" to criticise those who they saw as pseudo-resisters while also attempting to rehabilitate the memory of Pétain and his collaborationist government. With the myth of the resistance requiring heroes, the memories of victims of the Nazi regime not involved in the resistance were often buried within the collective memory. This is visible in the way different groups of deportees were recognised as victims by the Government. While political and resistant deportees were recognised as victims of the Vichy and Nazi regime, Service du travail obligatoire (STO) workers, French workers who had been sent to Germany to work as forced labour, were not. During the post-war period, there was an enduring suspicion that these men could have avoided the STO and joined the Resistance instead.  Deconstructing the myth  Shortly after the Général de Gaulle's death in November 1970, a new approach to the History of World War II which was less anxious to write a \\"récit national\\" (national narrative) started to emerge. = The emergence of memories = Georges Pompidou who had not been part of the résistance, succeeded de Gaulle to the French Presidency in 1969. In a desire to formally end \\"this time when french people did not love each other\\", he abandoned the resistancialist tradition. Concomitantly, a new generation affirmed itself after the May 1968 events in France, greatly liberalizing french society. In 1971, The Sorrow and the Pity by Marcel Ophüls definitively brought to an end the patriotic myth of mass resistance by depicting a country which wallowed in the collaboration. Time (magazine) wrote that the film punctured \\"the bourgeois myth—or protectively askew memory—that allows France generally to act as if hardly any Frenchmen collaborated with the Germans\\". This was followed in 1972 by the publication of Old Guard and New Order, 1940–1944 by Robert Paxton, which directly challenged the traditional view pioneered by Robert Aron's Histoire de Vichy (1954). Paxton argued that the Vichy government was in fact eager to collaborate with Nazi Germany and did not practice \\"passive resistance\\" to German rule. The book was translated into french in 1973 and was welcomed by both communists and the jewish community, while receiving mixed reactions among resistance groups because of the claim that there was no real resistance until 1941. = A late recognition = In the 1970s, the emergence of a memory around anti-Jewish policies under the Vichy regime led to a first prosecution in France for crimes against humanity in 1979, 15 years after a law made this crime imprescriptible. Jean Leguay, second in command in the French National Police during the Nazi Occupation of France had been one of the main instigator of the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup in which 13,152 Jews were arrested and sent into deportation, including 4 000 children. Although Leguay died before the en of the instruction, this prosecution opened a path for the French justice and the trials followed one another in the 1980s. Klaus Barbie was extradited from Bolivia in 1983 and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1987 for his role in the roundup of the Izieu Children and the murder of numerous resistants fighters, including Jean Moulin. Paul Touvier was arrested in 1989 and also sentenced to life imprisonment in 1994 for the execution of 7 Jewish hostages at the Rillieux-la-Pape cemetery in 1944. After serving as budget minister under Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, Maurice Papon was in 1998 convicted of crimes against humanity for his participation in the deportation of more than 1600 Jews during the occupation. Simultaneously, stories emerged from the Nazi concentration camps survivors, and the complicity of occupied states in these atrocities. In 1985, Shoah by Claude Lanzmann gave a voice to these former detainees in a 9 hours long documentary. French Jews organized themselves in associations like the Sons and Daughters of Jewish Deportees from France created by Serge Klarsfeld. The 50th anniversary of the Vel' d'Hiv round up was commemorated in 1992 by François Mitterrand, but it was not until July 1995 that President Jacques Chirac formally recognized the responsibility of the state in the deportation of French Jews during the Second World War.

Tropical Fish (A Golden Guide). Golden Books. New York: 1989. Distribution The bluefin killifish is found throughout Florida, except for its panhandle, where it is not found west of the Choctawhatchee River. It is found in the Chipola River drainage of southeastern Alabama, and sporadically along the Atlantic coast up to central South Carolina. It has been introduced to Texas, North Carolina, and California. Description Normally, the bluefin killifish can grow up to , but the maximum length recorded is . The maximum recorded age of the bluefin killifish is 2 years. Ecology Lucania goodei lives in heavily vegetated ponds and streams with little to no current. It is often found in spring habitats, and can also survive in moderate salinity, as well as low oxygen environments where it uses its upturned mouth to gulp air at the surface. Otherwise, it swims well below the surface. It is not a seasonal fish, unlike some other killifish. Species naming Lucania goodei was described by David Starr Jordan in 1880 with the type locality given as the Arlington River a tributary of St. John's River in Florida. The specific name honors the American ichthyologist George Brown Goode (1851-1896) who was the collector of the type.

Background TSC is co- chaired by Chris Gabrieli, Chairman of the National Center on Time & Learning, and Luis Ubiñas, President of the Ford Foundation. Expanded learning time is an issue that has long been on the education agenda in the United States. As more schools across the country began exploring how to expand their school schedules following new federal investments and research noting the impact of longer school years on student achievement became available, the coalition was formed. TSC launched on May 10, 2012 with a mission: to inspire and motivate communities across the country to add more learning time to a redesigned school day and year, enabling children everywhere – especially in disadvantaged schools – to get the education they need to succeed. =Founding featured signatories= The Coalition's founding 100 signatories have diverse and often contradicting backgrounds the list includes both national teachers’ unions, Randi Weingarten and Dennis Van Roekel; the founders and leaders of leading charter school networks including KIPP co-founders Michael Feinberg and Dave Levin and CEO of Zearn Evan Rudall; educational policy leaders and innovation pioneers including Linda Darling-Hammond, Jon Schnur, Geoffrey Canada, Wendy Kopp and Pedro Noguera; leading scholars such as University of Chicago Professor Charles M. Payne and President of Smith College Kathleen McCartney (dean); superintendents and local leaders such as Chicago's Rahm Emanuel, Houston's Terry Grier, Boston's Thomas Menino, LA's John Deasy, New York City's Michael Bloomberg and Dennis Walcott, and DC Public School's Kaya Henderson; state education leaders such as Massachusetts’ Paul Reville and New York's John King, Jr.; civil rights leaders such as Wade Henderson, Tom Saenz, and Antonia Hernandez; and business leaders such as legendary investor Peter Lynch, Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix, and Eli Broad of the Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation. Current work In May 2013, TSC celebrated a year of progress, noting that in its first year it gained the support of over 25,000 grassroots members and 200 featured signatories in education, business, and policy leaders. The Time to Succeed Coalition website provides tools for supporters to join the ELT movement as well as contact local leaders and media about why they support expanding learning time. =TSC Massachusetts= On April 2, 2013, TSC launched the first state coalition in Massachusetts at a briefing for legislators, staff and thought leaders at the State House. The briefing brought together Governor Deval Patrick, Secretary of Education Matthew Malone, Massachusetts Teachers Association, Stand for Children, the Massachusetts Charter Public School Association, Citizen Schools, business leaders, and Massachusetts 2020, a Boston-based non-profit that leads the Commonwealth's statewide initiative to expand learning time in district schools. With over 85 signatories, TSC Massachusetts is a broad and diverse coalition of leaders who believe that expanding learning time in Massachusetts schools is a critical strategy for students in high-poverty schools. The state coalition is calling for the state to develop a sustainable framework for all expanded-time schools.

Operations Established in 1933, as of 2009 the company derives most of its power from 19 major dams on the Rhone River with associated power stations, for which it has a concession until 2023. The company also has wind and solar power farms. This company has been totally independent of Électricité de France (EDF) since 2002, and is EDF's main competitor in the French electricity market. Its production averages 14.4 billion TWh per year, a quarter of the national hydropower and 3% of French electricity production. Since its inception, the company was entrusted by the State to develop and operate the Rhone, with three important goals: power generation, navigation, irrigation and other agricultural uses. The Génissiat, Donzère-Mondragon, Beauchastel, Montélimar, Seyssel and Chautagne dams, previously operated by EDF, are the main facilities. Shareholding France implemented directives to open the electricity market to competition in the early 2000s, but by law the public had to retain a majority stake in CNR. The Caisse des dépôts et consignations holds 33.20% of shares, and 16.83% are held by various local communities, totaling 50.03%. Electrabel, a subsidiary of ENGIE, acquired the remaining 49.97%. The European Commission found that GDF Suez had effectively controlled CNR since December 2003 due to the dilution of public ownership among the different communities and their lack of participation at general meetings. Electrabel was fined 20 million euros for not having warned the European Commission about the effect of the acquisition. History  Lock at Beaucaire, Gard High tension lines at Avignon Key events in the history of the company: *1899: On the initiative of the Chamber of Commerce of Lyon, 27 representatives of chambers of commerce in the region voted in favor of developing the Rhone for the three purposes of navigation, irrigation and the use of the driving force. They asked for state funding. *1921: On 27 May the Organic Law of the CNR was published in the Official Journal. The development of the Rhône must comply with the three purposes, which are inseparable. *1933: On 27 May the CNR held its formative general assembly. The capital was divided into four equal groups. The first (A) was wholly owned by the City of Paris. The second (B) by 251 shareholders, local communities in the region interested in development. The third (C) by the PLM. Finally, the fourth (D), by the major industrial energy companies of the time, including Giros- Loucheur, Azaria, Empain, Mercier and Durand. *1934: The state granted the CNR a concession for the Rhone with a term of 99 years. *1935: Start of construction of the port of Lyon (later Port Edouard Herriot). *1937: Start of construction of the first dam on the Rhone, the Génissiat Dam. *1946: CNR narrowly escaped the nationalization of the electricity sector. Following the intervention of Léon Perrier and Édouard Herriot, Article 41 of the nationalization law said a special law to be passed before 31 December 1946 would determine the conditions for liquidation of the CNR. *1948: CNR and EDF make an initial financial agreement during the commissioning of the Génissiat plant and dam. *1965: The mission of the CNR is redefined in the context of planning policy. *1980: End of development of the Lower Rhone (Vaugris) and law on the Rhine-Rhone link. *1986: End of the development of the Upper Rhone Sault Brénaz Dam. *1997: On 19 June, abandonment of the Rhine-Rhone project. *2000: Act of 10 February on the modernization and development of the public electricity service. *2001: 28 March – report of Michel Gentot allows the CNR to regain ownership of its production facilities. 1 April: CNR can freely market its electricity. 11 December: The Murcef law confirms the status of majority public ownership of CNR. *2003: Publication of decrees relating to the modernization of the concession and the implementation of laws; entry of Electrabel into the capital. *2006: CNR alone operates the Rhone facilities.

He is also a member of the UFI - Universitè Franco-Italienne, and has been a founding member of the AIT-Ateneo Italo Tedesco, holding the chairmanship until 2012. Work His work focuses on topics such as behavioural economics, theory of organisation and organisational learning, and theory of decisions, under the umbrella of the scientific approach developed by Herbert A. Simon (Nobel Prize 1980) from the 1950s onwards, which today is summarized as the “bounded rationality” approach.Herbert A. Simon, Massimo Egidi, Riccardo Viale, Robin Marris, \\"Economics, Bounded Rationality and the Cognitive Revolution\\" , Edward Elgar Publishing (March 31, 2008) He currently serves as Rector at LUISS University, Rome. A parallel line is represented by the collaboration with Reinhard Selten (Nobel Prize 1994), again on the themes of bounded rationality, and by studies on Behavioural economics carried out in the last decade. Study of biases in problem-solving Egidi's experiments in problem solvingEgidi M., Bonini N. (1999). Cognitive Traps in Individual and Organizational Behavior: some empirical evidence. Revue D'Economie Industrielle; p. 153-186. suggest that biases in problem solving may result from the process of mental editing by which subjects produce an imperfect and incomplete “representation” of the decision problem. From these experiments,see also Egidi M., Narduzzo A. (1997). The Emergence of Path-Dependent Behaviors in Cooperative Contexts. International Journal of Industrial Organization; p. 677-709., stable sub- optimal routinized behaviors emerged, and offered clear evidence that individuals, having discovered the solution of a problem in a limited domain, try to make use of the same solution beyond the original domain. This phenomenon has been previously discovered in a particular setting by Abraham S. Luchins, and defined “mechanization of thought”;Abraham S. Luchins (1942) Mechanization in problem solving. In: Psychological Monographs 34, APA: Washington. individuals remain locked into the procedure they have learnt, without reacting to new instances of the problem even when a new and better solution is evidently available. Individuals therefore extrapolate the solution of a problem beyond the domain of optimality, because they have categorized the situation incompletely or imperfectly. They make, in fact, systematic use of default classifications in order to reduce the short-term memory load and the complexity of symbolic manipulation. The result is the construction of an imperfect mental representation of the problem that nevertheless has the advantage of being simple. Herbert Simon’s “Bounded Rationality” can therefore be interpreted as full rationality within an imperfect representation.

It runs south from Guillaumes to Daluis. Geography The canyon starts off at Guillaumes, running north to south, west of the , and ends at the small commune of Daluis, where the Var widens. The 6-kilometer-long gorge is cut in the red rock (sandstone colored by iron oxide, 260 million years old) by the river Var. Notable views along the gorge (a touristic high point and one of a number of \\"long, lonely canyons\\" in the area) include the final waterfall of the Clue d'Amen. Geology and history Geological overview of the area; Dôme de Barrot in center, Gorges de Daluis on right. The area is dominated by the Dôme de Barrot, 2136 meters high, dating from the Permian. Former copper mining operations in the Dôme are still visible from the gorge, and unique mineral specimens have been found there. During the Beuil- Guillaumes insurrection of July–August 1944, the Pont de Berthéou was one of two bridges blown up by the French resistance in July 1944 (the Pont du Pra d'Astier on 7 July, the Pont de Berthéou the following day) in an attempt to halt German troops advancing toward Guillaumes. Environment and tourism Looking north from the Var valley into the gorge. South from Guillaumes, the D902/D2202 runs on the west side of the gorge, with the southbound lane going through 17 tunnels. The (now defunct) Alpes-Maritimes railroad line from Pont- de-Gueydan to Guillaumes, inaugurated in 1923, runs east from Guillaumes and crosses the gorge at the Pont de la Mariée, spanning 58 meters. Bungee jumping is done from the 80-meter-high bridge. Other notable sights include the Tête de la Femme, a rock formation resembling a woman's head on the west side of the road, just north of the Pont de Berthéou, and the gorge is a popular destination for rafting and canoeing.

By the early 13th century, the Île de la Cité Notre-Dame cathedral school had many famous teachers, and the controversial teachings of some of these led to the creation of a separate Left-Bank Sainte-Genevieve University that would become the centre of Paris's scholastic Latin Quarter best represented by the Sorbonne university. Twelve centuries later, education in Paris and the Paris region (Île-de-France région) employs approximately 330,000 people, 170,000 of whom are teachers and professors teaching approximately 2.9 million children and students in around 9,000 primary, secondary, and higher education schools and institutions. The Lycée Louis-le-Grand. Primary and secondary education Paris is home to several of France's most prestigious high-schools such as Lycée Louis-le-Grand, Lycée Henri-IV, Lycée Janson de Sailly and Lycée Condorcet. Other high-schools of international renown in the Paris area include the Lycée International de Saint Germain-en-Laye and the École Active Bilingue Jeannine Manuel. The Kingsworth International School along with the International School of Paris, are within the city. The Internationale Deutsche Schule Paris, the American School of Paris, the British School of Paris, the German international school and École Japonaise de Paris, along with the Japanese international school are located in nearby suburbs. Higher-education In the academic year 2004–2005, the Paris Region's 17 public universities, with its 359,749 registered students, comprised the largest concentration of university students in Europe. The Paris Region's prestigious grandes écoles and scores of university-independent private and public schools have an additional 240,778 registered students, that, together with the university population, creates a grand total of 600,527 students in higher education that year. Universities Sorbonne Chapel The cathedral of Notre-Dame was the first centre of higher-education before the creation of the University of Paris, Le Sorbonne, which was founded in about 1150. The universitas was chartered by King Philip Augustus in 1200, as a corporation granting teachers (and their students) the right to rule themselves independently from crown law and taxes. At the time, many classes were held in open air. Non-Parisian students and teachers would stay in hostels, or \\"colleges\\", created for the boursiers coming from afar. Already famous by the 13th century, the University of Paris had students from all of Europe. Paris's Rive Gauche scholastic centre, dubbed \\"Latin Quarter\\" as classes were taught in Latin then, would eventually regroup around the college created by Robert de Sorbon from 1257, the Collège de Sorbonne. The University of Paris in the 19th century had six faculties: law, science, medicine, pharmaceutical studies, literature, and theology. Following the 1968 student riots, there was an extensive reform of the University of Paris, in an effort to disperse the centralised student body. The following year, the former unique University of Paris was split between thirteen autonomous universities located throughout the city of Paris and its suburbs. Each of these universities inherited only some of the departments of the old University of Paris, and are not generalist universities. Panthéon-Assas University, Panthéon-Sorbonne University, Paris- Descartes University and Paris-Nanterre University inherited the law faculty; Paris Descartes University, Paris-Diderot University and Pierre-and-Marie- Curie University inherited the medicine faculty, and the latter two inherited the scientific departments; Paris-Sorbonne University and Sorbonne Nouvelle inherited the arts and humanities. In 1991, four more universities were created in the suburbs of Paris, reaching a total of seventeen public universities for the Paris (Île-de-France) région. These new universities were given names (based on the name of the suburb in which they are located) and not numbers like the previous thirteen: University of Cergy-Pontoise, University of Évry Val d'Essonne, University of Marne-la-Vallée, École supérieure Robert De Sorbon and University of Versailles Saint-Quentin-en- Yvelines. Students also have the opportunity to study abroad in North America via the MICEFAhttp://micefa.org/ program. Grandes écoles The Paris region hosts France's highest concentration of the prestigious grandes écoles – specialised centres of higher-education outside the public university structure. The prestigious public universities are usually considered grands établissements. Most of the grandes écoles were relocated to the suburbs of Paris in the 1960s and 1970s, in new campuses much larger than the old campuses within the crowded city of Paris, though the École Normale Supérieure has remained on rue d'Ulm in the 5th arrondissement. The Paris area hosts 55 grandes écoles, including a high number of engineering schools, some of them led by the prestigious Paris Institute of Technology (ParisTech) which comprises several colleges such as Arts et Métiers ParisTech, École Polytechnique, École des Mines, AgroParisTech, Télécom Paris, and École des Ponts et Chaussées. Other prestigious engineering schools are located in Paris, including École Centrale Paris, considered one of the top 3 in France, and Supélec. There are also many business schools, including INSEAD, ESSEC, HEC and ESCP Europe. The administrative school such as ENA has been relocated to Strasbourg, the political science school Sciences-Po is still located in Paris's left bank 7th arrondissement. The Parisian school of journalism CELSA département of the Paris-Sorbonne University is located in Neuilly-sur-Seine. Sainte-Geneviève Library The grandes écoles system is supported by a number of preparatory schools that offer courses of two to three years' duration called Classes Préparatoires, also known as classes prépas or simply prépas. These courses provide entry to the grandes écoles. Many of the best prépas are located in Paris, including Lycée Louis-le-Grand, Lycée Henri-IV, Lycée Saint- Louis, Lycée Janson de Sailly, and Lycée Stanislas. Two other top-ranking prépas (Lycée Hoche and Lycée privé Sainte-Geneviève) are located in Versailles, near Paris. Student selection is based on school grades and teacher remarks. Prépas are known to be very demanding in terms of work load and psychological stress.  Private foundations  The Pasteur Institute (French: Institut Pasteur) is a French non-profit private foundation dedicated to the study of biology, micro-organisms, diseases, and vaccines.

Malabar cuisine Thalassery biryani prepared There are broadly two classes of the non-vegetarian cuisine in Kerala; Malabar cuisine which is from North Kerala and Syrian Christian cuisine which is from the South (Travancore and Kochi regions). The two are clearly distinct from each other; the former has Mughlai-Arab, Portuguese, British, Dutch, Jewish and French influences and the latter includes a mix of Kerala traditional dishes rich in coconut as well as various recipes of Syrian, Dutch, Portuguese or British origin. Most dishes of Malabar cuisine, including Thalassery biryani, involve frying in ghee; there are sweet and spicy variants and they are predominantly non-vegetarian. Some typical examples include Ari pathiri, Chatti pathiri, Coin porottas, Kallummakaya fry, Arikkadukka and Biryanis with chicken, mutton, prawn, fish, egg as well as Sweeteners such as Aleesa, Kadalapparippu ada. Aleesa (അലീസ), a sweet Ramadan dish that fuses Arabian and Malabar cuisine; in the past, Malabari people introduced this dish even to Karachi, now in Pakistan Biryani is traditionally seen only as an occasional serving and not as staple food. Breakfast dishes include Pathiri, Orotti etc. The sweeteners are mostly used as snacks to be consumed in the afternoon or early evening. Biryani was introduced into the region due to the Islamic influence and the recipe gradually evolved into Thalassery biryani. Thalassery Faloodha Thalassery Falooda is a regional variant of the Persian dessert. This is a cocktail of fruit salad, dry fruits such as blackcurrant, pistachio, cashew, almond (badam), rose milk and vanilla ice cream. Green Mussel dishes The Asian Green Mussel (Perna viridis) cuisines are favored in Thalassery dishes. The mussel is called Kallu-mma-kaya (fruit on the stone) or kadukka. They grow on rocks in contact with the sea. Other dishes include Kallummakaya porichathu (fried mussel), Arikkadukka (Stuffed-in-shell mussel, steamed and fried), Kallumakkaya Ularthiyath or Mussel Stir Fry, Kallumakkaya Varattiyathu, mussel pickles. Elambakka (clams) are also popular.Farmers urge to take up mussel culture. The Hindu (6 October 2010).

The Hindu (8 January 2007). Thalassery natives are known for their generous hospitality towards guests. Thalassery Snacks Another Thalassery dish is Kozhi-kkalu, made of sliced and fried tapioca. Pappadam-Pazham kuzhakkal, Aval um Poriyum kuzhakkal are other popular dishes. Muttamala, Taripoli, Pazham nirachatu (fried banana filled with grated coconut sugar or jaggery), Unnakaya, Kaayi pola, Chatti pathiri and Ari pathiri are other local dishes. Porridges such as Mutaari kachiyatu (ragi porridge), are popular. Muttamala and Muttasirka are a traditional sweet made using egg, where Muttamala is yellow noodle-like made of egg yolk and Muttasirka is white-colored and made of egg white. Typically, Muttamala is spread over pieces of Muttasirka, and they are further adorned with cherries. Unnakkai (ഉന്നക്കായ്‌) also known as Unnakaya, Unnakka, Kaai Ada, and Kaai Porichathu, is a spindle-shaped sweet dessert made of plantains. It is a famous Malabar snack often served at weddings, iftar parties and other festivities. It is prepared by stuffing plantain with flavored coconut (and optionally with egg) and fried in ghee. Chatti pathiri is similar to Lasagne where layers of spiced (masala) beef or chicken mixture are placed between layers of egg dipped pancakes and baked in oven. It is especially served in Malabar Muslim weddings and reception parties. Thalassery Biryani Thalassery biryani () is a rice- based dish blended with spices and chicken. As it is the only biryani recipe in Kerala cuisine, it can also be called Kerala biryani.http://food.manoramaonline.com/food/in-season/ramadan-food-ramzan- thalassery-biriyani-recipes-chicken.html Thalassery biriyani is the only type of biriyani in whole of Kerala which uses Kaima rice for preparation. This spread to nearby places like Kozhikode where it is known as Kozhikode biriyani, albeit being essentially the same. The main difference between Thalassery biryani and other biryanis is that it uses only Khaima/Jeerakasala ricea short-grain, thin rice which is also called biryani rice in Kerala. The dish does not use basmati rice. Biryani is an exotic dish of Mughal origin, but this variant is an indigenous recipe of Malabar. It is a symbol of the cultural amalgamation of Mughal and Malabari cuisines. The Mughals brought the cuisine of biryani from Samarkand, and later variations of biryani developed in different parts of India. Thalassery biryani may have come to the region because of the influence of the Muslim rulers of Mysore and Arkot. Thalassery biryani is a cultural embodiment and is reminiscent of foreign influences in Malabar; it is a reminder of the Mughal-Arab cultural influence in North Kerala due to the trade that lasted for many centuries before the 1900s and the emigration to the Middle East of locals from the 1970s onwards. Thalassery sea port was an export trade centre for spices where a convergence of European, Arab and Malabar cultures occurred. =Etymology= The name \\"Thalassery biryani\\" (, , , ) originates from Thalassery, a town in the coastal Malabar region in North Kerala, India. The word \\"biryani\\" is derived from the Persian word biryān (n) () which means \\"fried\\" or \\"roasted\\". Biryani was believed to have been invented in the kitchens of the Mughal Emperors; Thalassery biryani is one of many ways of preparing biryani dishes. In the local dialect-Malayalam, there is a small variation in pronunciation. It is called biri-yaa-ni instead of bir-yani =Historical and cultural influences= Thalassery biryani with RaitaThalassery biryani is an ample insignia of the Islamic cultural influence in the region. The dish is a traditional Mappila or Malabar cuisine. Ancient written recordsexcept for a few treatise by historiansciting the origin of Mappila's (Malabar Muslims) are rare. The mythology about the conversion of the last Chera Emperor (Cheraman Perumal)Rama Varma Kulasekhara Perumalto Islam from Mahodayapuram (Kodungallur) by Malik Deenar and subsequent conversion of Perumal's sister and nephew residing in Dharmadam(a village located north of Thalassery) is generally believed to be the origin of Islam in North Malabar. Perumal is believed to have left Kerala from an erstwhile feudal province in the region named Poyanad (Poya Nadu-'The province from where he left') which lies in between Thalassery and Kannur taluks (Governed by local chieftains named Randuthara Achanmar before 1947). Perumal's nephew Mahabali, is believed to be the first Ali Raja of the Arakkal kingdom (The Sultanate of Lakshadweep and Cannanore)the sole Muslim kingdom of Kerala. The Arakkal Kingdom controlled Dharmadam until the formation of Kerala state on 1 November 1956. The legend showcases that these incidents had a significant influence in introducing Islamic culture in Thalassery. In the ancient period ThalasseryAn erstwhile port town in North Malabar was geographically in the convergence point of three regional provinces Chirakkal, Kottayam and Kadathanad. It was also the end point of the 'Perya pass' coming from the eastern hilly areas of Coorg and Wayanad making it an important trade center of spices in Malabar. The Arab traders, the Arkot rulers and the invasion of Sultanate of Mysore were the other important factors which introduced and developed various Islamic culture in the region. During the Muslim holy month of Ramzan, Malabar dishes are made in abundant varieties. The Muslim community of Malabar differs culturally; the lifestyle of the trader communities near the coastal towns differs from that of the farming communities in the inland and hilly areas; Malabar cuisine varies throughout the region. In the modern era as communication improved exponentially, the differences of culture between coastal and hilly area became inconspicuous resulting in the amalgamation of food culture within the Muslim community in Malabar . The Mughlai cuisine had a significant influence upon Malabar recipes. Mughali recipes including Biryani, Kebab and Naan spread throughout India. The ingredients included rice, maida, wheat and there was extensive use of ghee (clarified butter) and oils for preparation. Sweet delicacies were made from jaggery (unrefined sugar). Most of these dishes are non-vegetarian; chicken, mutton, lamb and beef are used but pork is not consumed due to religious regulations. Dish range from mild to extremely spicy, and the dishes have distinct aromas. The practice in Islamic food culture is that the non-vegetarian dishes are required to be \\"Halal\\" compliant, such foods are supposed to be consumed by Muslims as a religious directive. The Malabar Mappila dishes are preferred by some societies to be compliant with the 'Halal' method of food processing. =Differences from other biryani= Short-grained thin Kaima/Jeerakasala rice (left) and long- grained thin Basmati rice (right). Kaima/Jeerakasala is used to make Thalassery biryani. Thalassery biryani uses a unique, fragrant, small-grained, thin rice variety named Kaima or . This rice even though small in size, is different from the common small rice used in many Indian rice dishes. Kaima/Jeerakasala is not round unlike these common smaller variants and the fragrance of Kaima/Jeerakasala is another distinct feature. Other kinds of rice that could be used are Jeera rice, Jeerakasemba or small Bangladeshi biryani rice. The rice is white, short (small) grained, thin (not plum), but it is the aroma of these rice varieties which make then distinctive. The recipe and cuisine of Thalassery biryani has clear conspicuous differences with other biryani variants. The Kaima/Jeerakasala rice does not need pre- soaking, water is only used to clean the rice. After adequate boiling there should not be any water remaining in the cooking dish as it should have been evaporated completely. This is a major difference from other rice preparation, in which water has to be drained off after cooking. The blending of ghee rice with masala is done by the dum process (A method of cooking by sealing a lid tightly and placing hot charcoal on it). The biryani masala and ghee rice are arranged in layers inside the dish. Meat is cooked with masala on slow fire; it is layered with rice and the lid of the container is sealed with Maida dough or a loin cloth. Hot coal or charcoal is placed then above the lid. Thalassery biryani is a Pakki-Biryani. There are two types of biryani; \\"Pakki\\" and \\"Kacchi\\", In Pakki style, the ghee rice is added to the fully cooked chicken-masala mix and then cooked by the \\"dum\\" process; where as in Kacchi style the ghee rice is added to the half cooked chicken and then cooked till it is fully cooked or the dum process is used. Specially dressed chicken is poured into the masala dish. The chicken is slowly cooked in the masala, and gets blended well with the juices of masala and spices. The Thalassery biryani recipe has additional distinct features; unlike other biryanis it is not oily because of the dum process used for preparation. A unique blend of spices is added and the Kaima rice also adds a unique flavour. No oil is used to make the chicken, which is added raw into the masala mix. =Ingredients= For the recipe, see Thalassery biryani at dining *Khaima(Jeerakasala) rice *Chicken *Onion *Ginger *Garlic *Green chilli *Lime juice *Shallot *Coriander leaves *Mint leaves *Tomato *Ghee *Hydrogenated vegetable oil (vanaspati) *Coconut oil * Edible Rose water *Curd or yoghurt *Table salt *Spices: Garam masala powder, Persian Cumin (Caraway), Mace, Turmeric powder, Red chili powder, Black pepper powder, Crushed curry leaves (Optional) Cinnamon, Cloves, Cardamom, Malabar leaf (Indian bay leaf), Indian white Poppy seed(Kaskas) and for garnishing and texture Saffron soaked in milk, Pinch of artificial food colour, yellow or orange; and fried (coconut oil) mix of Onion, Cashew nuts and Kismis (sultana raisins), Star anise (Optional).

After the meal, hot lime-black tea (known among the Muslim community as 'Sulaimani') is served; this adds a special taste after the main course and is an aid to digestion. Lime tea is a common afters in the Malabar region, especially with a rice based main-course. Fried Indian anchovy or smelt can be served as a starter if required and this is garnished with chopped onion, curry leaves and lime juice squeezed over it. Fried chicken in smaller pieces is also seen in some fiestas as accompaniments or as starters. Daahashamani water, a medicated herbal water, is preferred to be used when drinking water with biryani. Daahashamani is an ayurvedic medicine and natural thirst reliever and digestive aid prepared by mixing dry ginger, cardamom, cloves, coriander seeds, mimosa catechu, sapanwood, vetiver, puncturevine and sandal wood, it is usually available in local markets. =Popularity= The dish is popular and is often served in Malabar in weddings and other celebrations and parties. Biryani is an unavoidable dish for the Muslim community. Even though Sadya is the traditional cuisine for Hindu weddings in the region, Some Hindus and Christians often serve biryani, mainly because it is easier to prepare than other main course dishes and it is a complete food that avoids the extra effort of making curry. =Nutrition= The dish is rich in nutrients as it is a rice-spice dish. It is high in proteins and carbohydrates, and is also a source of minerals and vitamins. Nutritional value (According to U.S Dept. of Agriculture) of the spices is mentioned in the notes. The dish contains unsaturated and saturated fats; the saturated fat can be reduced by adjusting the quantities of hydrogenated vegetable oil (vanaspati) and ghee. =In fiction= The Malayalam movie, \\"Ustad Hotel\\" is based on the preparation of Malabar biryani.

As the capital of France, Paris is the seat of France's national government. For the executive, the two chief officers each have their own official residences, which also serve as their offices. The President of France resides at the Élysée Palace in the 8th arrondissement, while the Prime Minister's seat is at the Hôtel Matignon in the 7th arrondissement. Government ministries are located in various parts of the city; many are located in the 7th arrondissement, near the Matignon. The two houses of the French Parliament are located on the left bank. The upper house, the Senate, meets in the Palais du Luxembourg in the 6th arrondissement, while the more important lower house, the Assemblée Nationale, meets in the Palais Bourbon in the 7th arrondissement. The President of the Senate, the second-highest public official in France after the President of the Republic, resides in the Petit Luxembourg, a small annex to the Palais du Luxembourg. France's highest courts are located in Paris. The Court of Cassation, the highest court in the judicial order, which reviews criminal and civil cases, is located in the Palais de Justice on the Île de la Cité, while the Conseil d'État, which provides legal advice to the executive and acts as the highest court in the administrative order, judging litigation against public bodies, is located in the Palais Royal in the 1st arrondissement. The Constitutional Council, an advisory body with ultimate authority on the constitutionality of laws and government decrees, also meets in the Montpensier wing of the Palais Royal. City government Map of the arrondissements of Paris. Paris has been a commune (municipality) since 1834 (and also briefly between 1790 and 1795). At the 1790 division (during the French Revolution) of France into communes, and again in 1834, Paris was a city only half its modern size, composed of 12 arrondissements, but, in 1860, it annexed bordering communes, some entirely, to create the new administrative map of twenty municipal arrondissements the city still has today. These municipal subdivisions describe a clockwise spiral outward from its most central, the 1st arrondissement. The arrondissements are all follows (see map for location): *1st arrondissement of Paris *2nd arrondissement of Paris *3rd arrondissement of Paris *4th arrondissement of Paris *5th arrondissement of Paris *6th arrondissement of Paris *7th arrondissement of Paris *8th arrondissement of Paris *9th arrondissement of Paris *10th arrondissement of Paris *11th arrondissement of Paris *12th arrondissement of Paris *13th arrondissement of Paris *14th arrondissement of Paris *15th arrondissement of Paris *16th arrondissement of Paris *17th arrondissement of Paris *18th arrondissement of Paris *19th arrondissement of Paris *20th arrondissement of Paris In 1790, Paris became the préfecture (seat) of the Seine département, which covered much of the Paris region. In 1968, it was split into four smaller ones: The city of Paris became a distinct département of its own, retaining the Seine's departmental number of 75 (originating from the Seine département's position in France's alphabetical list), while three new départements of Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne were created and given the numbers 92, 93, and 94, respectively. The result of this division is that today Paris's limits as a département are exactly those of its limits as a commune, a situation unique in France. Municipal offices Each of Paris's twenty arrondissements has its own town hall and a directly elected council (conseil d'arrondissement), which, in turn, elects an arrondissement mayor. A selection of members from each arrondissement council form the Council of Paris (conseil de Paris), which, in turn, elects the mayor of Paris. In medieval times, Paris was governed by a merchant-elected municipality whose head was the provost of the merchants. In addition to regulating city commerce, the provost of the merchants was responsible for some civic duties such as the guarding of city walls and the cleaning of city streets. The creation of the provost of Paris from the 13th century diminished the merchant Provost's responsibilities and powers considerably. {border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"float:right; margin:1em; background:#f9f9f9; border:1px #aaa solid; border-collapse:collapse; font- size:95%;\\" + 'Composition of the Council of Paris - style=\\"background:#e9e9e9; border-bottom:2px solid gray;\\" !colspan=2PartySeats - ! style=\\"background-color: \\"• Socialist Partyalign=\\"right\\"56 - ! style=\\"background-color: \\" Union for a Popular Movementalign=\\"right\\"54 - ! style=\\"background-color: \\"• The Greensalign=\\"right\\"16 - ! style=\\"background-color: \\"• French Communist Partyalign=\\"right\\"13 - ! style=\\"background-color: \\" Union of Democrats and Independentsalign=\\"right\\"16 - ! style=\\"background-color: \\"• Citizen and Republican Movementalign=\\"right\\"5 - ! style=\\"background-color: \\"• Miscellaneous Leftalign=\\"right\\"2 - ! style=\\"background-color: \\"• Left Partyalign=\\"right\\"2 - ! style=\\"background-color: \\" MoDemalign=\\"right\\"1 } A direct representative of the king, in a role resembling somewhat the préfet of later years, the Provost (prévôt) of Paris oversaw the application and execution of law and order in the city and its surrounding prévôté (county) from his office in the Grand Châtelet. Many functions from both provost offices were transferred to the office of the crown-appointed lieutenant general of police upon its creation in 1667. For centuries, the prévôt and magistrates of the Châtelet clashed with the administrators of the Hôtel de Ville over jurisdiction; the latter notably included the quartiniers, each of whom was responsible for one of the sixteen quartiers (which were in turn divided into fourcinquantaines, each with its cinquantainier, and those in turn were divided into dizaines, administered bydizainiers): > All of these men were in principle elected by the local bourgeois. At any > one time, therefore, 336 men had shared administrative responsibility for > street cleaning and maintenance, for public health, law, and order. The > quartiniers maintained the official lists of \\"bourgeois de Paris\\", ran local > elections, could impose fines for breaches of the bylaws, and had a role in > tax assessment. They met at the Hôtel de Ville to confer on matters of > citywide importance and each year selected eight of \\"the most notable > inhabitants of the quarter\\", who together with other local officials would > elect the city council. The last of the Prévôt des marchands of Paris was assassinated on the afternoon of the French Revolution Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789. Paris became an official \\"commune\\" from the creation of the administrative division on 14 December the same year, and its provisional \\"Paris commune\\" revolutionary municipality was replaced with the city's first municipal constitution and government from 9 October 1790. Through the turmoil of the 1794 Thermidorian Reaction, it became apparent that revolutionary Paris's political independence was a threat to any governing power: The office of mayor was abolished the same year, and its municipal council one year later. The Hôtel de Ville, Paris (town hall). Although the municipal council was recreated in 1834, for most of the 19th and 20th centuries, Paris — along with the larger Seine département of which it was a centre — was under the direct control of the state-appointed prefect (préfet) of the Seine department (until 1968) and the prefect of Paris (1968-1977). This left the largest city in the nation as the only one without a mayor, meaning that Paris had less autonomy than the smallest village. The state-appointed Prefect of Police was in charge of police in the same jurisdiction. With the exception of a few brief occasions, the city did not have a mayor from 1794 to 1977, and the Paris Prefecture of Police is still under state control today. Despite its dual existence as commune and département, Paris has a single council to govern both; the Council of Paris, presided over by the mayor of Paris, meets as either as a municipal council (conseil municipal) or a departmental council (conseil général), depending on the issue to be debated. Paris's modern administrative organisation still retains some traces of the former Seine département jurisdiction. The Prefecture of Police (also directing Paris's fire brigades), for example, has still a jurisdiction extending to Paris's petite couronne of bordering three départements for some operations such as fire protection or rescue operations, and is still directed by France's national government. Paris has no municipal police force, although it does have its own brigade of traffic wardens. Capital of the Île-de-France région Île-de-France. As part of a 1961 nationwide administrative effort to consolidate regional economies, Paris as a département became the capital of the new région of the District of Paris, renamed the Île-de-France région in 1976. It encompasses the Paris département and its seven closest départements. Its regional council members, since 1986, have been chosen by direct elections. The prefect of the Paris département (who served as the prefect of the Seine département before 1968) is also prefect of the Île-de- France région, although the office lost much of its power following the creation of the office of mayor of Paris in 1977. Intercommunality Few of the above changes have taken into account Paris's existence as an agglomeration. Unlike in most of France's major urban areas such as Lille and Lyon, there is no intercommunal entity in the Paris urban area, no intercommunal council treating the problems of the region's dense urban core as a whole; Paris's alienation of its suburbs is indeed a problem today, and one of the main causes of civil unrest such as the suburban riots in 2005. A direct result of these events are propositions for a more efficient metropolitan structure to cover the city of Paris and some of the suburbs, ranging from a socialist idea of a loose \\"metropolitan conference\\" (conférence métropolitaine) to the right-wing idea of a more integrated Grand Paris's' (\\"Greater Paris\\"). International relations Paris and its region host the headquarters of many international organisations including UNESCO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the International Chamber of Commerce, the Paris Club, the European Space Agency, the International Energy Agency, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, the European Union Institute for Security Studies, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, the International Exhibition Bureau and the International Federation for Human Rights. Paris is today one of the world's leading business and cultural centres and its influences in politics, education, entertainment, media, science, and the arts all contribute to its status as one of the world's major global cities.According to :Globalization and World Cities study by the University of Loughborough, 2010 /Global Cities Index by A.T.

History The year 1810 witnessed the arrival of the first ever Protestant missionary, the Rev. John Hands of London Missionary Society at Bellary, Karnataka State (erstwhile Mysore). During the later part of 19th century also witnessed the arrival of other missionary societies such as the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society (1821) Basel Mission (1834), the society of propagation of the Gospel and the Church Missionary Society. Except for the Basel Mission, the other Missions became part of the South Indian United Church (SIUC) which came into existence in 1908. The South Indian United Church (SIUC) was formed and sustained by the efforts of the Rev. Vedam Santiago of Madurai. When he envisioned the formation of the Church of South India a number of hurdles had to be crossed including those of caste. The Anglican Bishop Azariah was approached by Rev. V Santiago and persuaded to be a leading force in the bringing together of the varied churches in South India. Thus it was that Rev. V Santiago along with other SIUC leaders brought about the Church of South India under the later leadership of Bishop Azariah. When the Church of South India was formally inaugurated in 1947, Mysore Diocese was one of fourteen dioceses. Acceding to a proposal made by the Synod in 1964 to create smaller dioceses to provide better administration, the Diocese in 1969 approved the scheme for dividing the Diocese into three units. As a result of this division, the Central Karnataka diocese came into existence on 1 May 1970, on trifurcation of the then Mysore diocese. Under the leadership of Bishop Norman C Sargant, the Mysore Diocese was trifurcated and the Mysore Central Diocese came into being in the year 1970. When Mysore was renamed as Karnataka then the Diocese also changed its name from Mysore Central Diocese to Karnataka Central Diocese. About The diocese has around 120 pastorates covering three major divisions viz Bangalore, Kolar Gold Fields and Tumkur. Rt. Rev. Dr. Prasana Kumar Samuel is the current bishop of the diocese.

This was the first church to be built in Bangalore. In 1812 this was shifted outside the fort area and was called the Fort church, which was used as a place of worship for English soldiers. Over a century this church ministered to the families living in the suburb area A need was felt by the Mysore government to construct Vani Vilas Hospital and it was found that this church in the fort area was in the way. The government allotted the present site for the new church. The foundation stone was laid by Sir Mirza Ismail the then Dewan of Mysore. It was completed and dedicated in the name of St. Luke by the Lord Bishop of Madras Rt. Rev. E H M Waller on the 9th March1935. * St. Mark's Cathedral, Bangalore St. Mark's Cathedral was founded in 1808 and was completed in 1812. The Bishop of Calcutta consecrated this Cathedral in 1816. This Cathedral is a beautiful colonial structure having a graceful dome over a semicircular chancel. Roman archers along the walls are one of the most beautiful features of the cathedral. This cathedral was modeled along the lines of the 17th-century St Pauls Cathedral. The entrance has elaborate woodwork and ornate carvings coupled with majestically done ceilings and domes. The monument was enlarged in 1901 and rebuilt in 1927. The new structure is known for its stained glass work. The church is named after St.Mark, the author of St. Mark's gospel. * Holy Trinity Church, Bangalore Holy Trinity Church, located at Trinity circle at the east end of the MG Road, is a major landmark in Bangalore.

He has been conductor and musical director of the contemporary music ensemble Spectrum and the English Chamber Choir throughout his career and has also worked extensively in commercial music with many leading artists, in particular Rick Wakeman, Vangelis and Eric Lévi. Apart from conducting he is also known as a singer in both classical and commercial music, has founded and directed a number of festivals and similar projects, spent a few years writing and editing for the BBC, and is a forensic musicologist (i.e. expert on legal matters of copyright, plagiarism, sampling etc.) in the UK. Early Years – Education He was born in Worcester in 1947 and began his musical education as a boy chorister at Canterbury Cathedral. Music scholarships followed to St Edward's School, Oxford and Magdalen College Oxford, where he obtained an M.A. (Oxon) in music, and also sang as a Lay Clerk at New College. This was followed by postgraduate studies at Oxford in composition, and at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, London in bassoon and singing (counter- tenor). He then embarked on his professional career in 1971. Spectrum and the performance of contemporary music Whilst still at the Guildhall, he formed, together with his partner (later wife) Ann Manly, Spectrum – a flexible instrumental ensemble devoted to the performance of contemporary music. The group's debut coincided with the establishment of the Arts Council Contemporary Music Network, a scheme designed to tour new music and provide opportunities for multiple performances of works which required rather more rehearsal than the standard classical repertoire; within months Spectrum had been engaged to perform one of the first network tours, with a programme which included William Walton's Façade recited by the then youthful mezzo-soprano Sarah Walker. Shortly afterwards, he achieved another 'first' when he conducted, as part of another Arts Council CMN tour, the opening concert of the first Huddersfield Festival of Contemporary Music, this time with the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble and the Australian pianist Roger Woodward, the programme including Xenakis' Eonta. The association with Xenakis, in particular, stemmed from Guy's time at Oxford when he worked as a student intern on the English Bach Festival (EBF) – founded and directed by the Greek musical entrepreneur Lina Lalandi. During this time (1967–70) Lalandi brought to Oxford not only Iannis Xenakis, but also Olivier Messiaen and Karlheinz Stockhausen and she gave opportunities to several emerging musicians from Oxford, not only in contemporary performance, but also the rapidly expanding field of baroque and classical music performed on 'period' instruments. Among other early performances given by Spectrum was the British première of Xenakis's octet Anaktoria in the EBF's London season at St John's Smith Square in May 1971, and the ensemble's association with Xenakis and Lina Lalandi was to continue for the next thirty years. Spectrum toured Germany supported by the British Council in 1974, became regular visitors to the Middelburg New Music Festival in Holland from 1975, gave numerous performances in London including for the Society for the Promotion of New Music (SPNM) and the Park Lane Group (PLG) and began recording on a regular basis for BBC Radio 3, in particular the Music in Our Time series – including a series featuring American composers. A particularly fruitful period for the ensemble came during the 1980s as a result of two collaborations: violinist Irvine Arditti became leader of the group (when strings were required) and brought with him his fellow players from the Arditti String Quartet, and the link with Middelburg introduced the American pianist and avid champion of new music, Yvar Mikhashoff, who in turn became an influential artistic adviser to the Almeida Festival in London. During this time, in addition to its regular work in London, Spectrum toured the East Coast of the US, giving concerts in New York, Hartford, Buffalo and Albany, and also made two award-winning recordings: Jonathan Harvey's Bhakti, the first release of the newly- established ‘New Music Cassettes’ label launched by SPNM in 1989 and a Sunday Times Pick of the Year, and a collection of Xenakis ensemble pieces for Wergo in 1990, which was awarded the Preis der Deutschen Schallplattenkritik. At the recommendation of Iannis Xenakis, Guy Protheroe was appointed Guest Conductor to the Xenakis Ensemble in Holland for several years, working with many international composers including John Cage. During the 1990s Spectrum ceased to promote or perform on a regular basis, due to a combination of circumstances: the Arditti String Quartet had risen to become one of the most acclaimed and busiest string quartets anywhere, leaving its players little time to do anything else; Yvar Mikhashoff succumbed to Aids and died in Buffalo in 1993; there was very little public funding dedicated to new music performance (and much of the music then being written was in new styles which turned out to be much more programmable in mainstream classical concerts), and in addition the Protheroes were increasingly in demand in the sphere of commercial music. However, in almost a full circle, Spectrum was brought together again in January 2000 to give the first professional performances in the newly-constructed Linbury Studio Theatre at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. The promoter was Lina Lalandi, and the work was Xenakis's Oresteia Suite, in a staged version by the French director Alain Germain. For this production the ensemble was extended to include a group of singers and actors and the performances received universally outstanding critical acclaim. The English Chamber Choir (ECC) The English Chamber Choir was formed by the conductor David Measham as a splinter group from the London Symphony Chorus and formally constituted in 1972. A few months later it was in need of a chorus master to deputise while the current post-holder was away from London. Guy Protheroe began working with the Choir and has continued ever since. When David Measham left for Australia, Guy was appointed conductor and musical director and together he and the Choir have enjoyed over four decades of music-making, in venues ranging from the Royal Albert Hall to village churches in France and Switzerland, singing music from over six centuries in numerous languages and recording not only classical albums and CDs but also taking part in many live and recorded commercial productions. It was in 1972 and '73 that the newly-formed Choir was invited to sing in the stage performances of the rock opera Tommy with The Who, and the 1973 shows at the Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park, London, were Guy's introduction to the commercial business of 'popular' music – an area in which he became immediately at home and frequently involved, alongside his more 'classical' engagements. Both Guy and the Choir took part in the live concert and recording of Rick Wakeman's Journey to the Centre of the Earth at the Royal Festival Hall in January 1974 and the Choir also took part in the 40th anniversary UK tour and a new recording of the work in an extended version in 2014, all conducted by Guy. Over the years Guy has directed the ECC in hundreds of performances and projects in the UK and also in Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Greece and Switzerland. A few years after the ECC was founded a chamber orchestra, the English Players, was formed to accompany it in the choral/orchestral repertoire from the 17th century onwards, playing on period instruments as appropriate, both in the UK and Europe. Together the Choir and Players have performed works ranging from Monteverdi's Vespers of 1610, through Bach's Passions and the B minor Mass, Handel's Dixit Dominus and Messiah, Mozart's Requiem and C minor Mass, to Brahms Ein Deutsches Requiem and Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius. In May 2012 he conducted the Choir and Players in a very rare revival of the Portuguese composer Antonio Teixeira's Te Deum (1734) for 16 soloists, 5 choirs and orchestra at the Brighton Festival. The Choir's unaccompanied (a cappella) repertoire ranges from mediaeval times to today – highlights including Thomas Tallis's 40-part motet Spem in alium which it has performed by invitation of the Lord Mayor of London at the Mansion House, and many compositions inspired by the music of the Eastern Church (and in particular Byzantine chant) including Sir John Tavener, Ivan Moody and the Greek-Canadian composer Christos Hatzis. The Choir has sung publicly in the presence of HM The Queen and most members of the Royal Family and, at the personal invitation of HM The Queen, at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle. Together Guy Protheroe and the ECC have a long list of recording credits which include The Byzantine Legacy (Sony Greece, 2000) EcleCtiCa (2008) and The Troparion of Kassiani (Naxos, 2011). [These titles are all available for download.] The Choir is also featured on many of the albums on which Guy Protheroe collaborated with Vangelis, Rick Wakeman, Eric Lévi and many others. (See discography for more details) In recent years the ECC has enjoyed a successful association with the Belmont Ensemble and their conductor Peter G Dyson, taking part in many concerts at the Church of St Martin-in-the-Fields in Trafalgar Square, London. Guy has also conducted with the Choir and Players a wide range of Jewish music, often in his own arrangements, in concerts and recordings, including contributing to the massive Milken Archive of American Jewish Music. He has also appeared with the Choir many times on television shows with stars including Stephen Fry, Gordon Ramsey and Chris Moyles, and also on BBC Radio 2, 3 and 4 – with a regular slot each year the Sunday before Christmas on Radio 4's Broadcasting House with Paddy O'Connell. Commercial music After beginning as chorus master for The Who's Tommy, Guy Protheroe has worked on films, television and radio commercials and in concerts with a wide variety of artists as conductor, musical director, arranger, composer and lyricist including John Anderson, Tangerine Dream, Black Sabbath, George Martin, Larry Adler, Barrington Pheloung, Dave Stewart, David Arnold, Roy Wood and Mark Almond. He had a long-standing relationship with Vangelis as musical director, arranger, lyricist and vocal soloist in many recordings and films, from the 1975 album Heaven and Hell to the Ridley Scott films Blade Runner and 1492: Conquest of Paradise. Concert venues with Vangelis include the Royal Albert Hall, the Royal Festival Hall, a Docklands concert in Rotterdam to an audience of nearly 300,000 and a concert on the Acropolis in Athens, both the latter with live television coverage. He was chorus master for the Vangelis title music for the 2002 World Cup, and in 2004 he recorded an album of Vangelis works with Giorgia Fumanti, a second album following in 2005. In 2012 the BBC commissioned from Guy a large-scale orchestration of the title music of Conquest of Paradise for Music Nation, performed in Glasgow in March 2012 by 300 singers and musicians as part of the 2012 Olympic celebrations. Protheroe has also long been associated with Rick Wakeman, from the 1974 Journey to the Centre of the Earth and 1975 The Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table (performed on ice in Wembley Arena) to the 1999 Return to the Centre of the Earth and The New Gospels, and the more recent albums The Wizard and the Forest of all Dreams (2002), Out There (2003) and the DVD Amazing Grace (2007). With his wife, Ann Manly, he has orchestrated all the works for an \\"unplugged\\" concert programme (Rick on concert grand piano, with symphony orchestra and chorus) first given in Bulgaria in 2008, and he has since conducted many further performances in London (Chelsea Festival), the Lugano Jazz Festival (Switzerland), Poland, Chile and Argentina, in Cheltenham Centaur and also in the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London. In May 2009 he conducted two large-scale open-air performances of a new and expanded, orchestrated version of The Six Wives of Henry VIII at Hampton Court Palace with Wakeman celebrating 500 years of the accession of Henry VIII, also released on DVD and CD. In September 2012, he conducted the recording of the new expanded version of Journey to the Centre of the Earth in Abbey Road Studios and also conducted the first live performance of this version, together with The Six Wives of Henry VIII, in Buenos Aires. (The new orchestrations of all these recent albums have also been undertaken by Guy Protheroe and Ann Manly.) Among other concerts and recordings, in April/May 2014 he conducted Journey on a 14-concert UK tour, with a further concert tour in October 2014 of Argentina and Brazil. Protheroe was lyricist, arranger, musical director, and vocal soloist on Eric Lévi's score to the French smash- hit comedy film Les Visiteurs (1993) and also on the album Era (1996) with over 6 million sales in mainland Europe and South America. (Protheroe is also the male vocal soloist, double-tracked, on the track Ameno from Era.) The more recent Era 2, Era 3: The Mass and Era 4: Reborn have all reached high chart positions internationally; Era 5: Classics was released in November 2009; Era 6: Classics 2 in October 2010; and Era 7: 7 Seconds in 2017. Another Era album was released in 2013 entitled Arielle Dombasle By Era. The project to date has sold nearly 15 million albums. All were recorded in Abbey Road Studios and Air Studios in London, and also in Paris. In June 2012 he conducted two large- scale concerts of Era in Moscow and also was guest conductor in an Era concert in Menorca, and further performances took place in December 2013 in the Kremlin, Moscow and St Petersburg. In September 2017 he was a special guest at an Era concert in Bergen, Norway, which featured a chorus of 150 singers. In recent years, Protheroe has been chorus master for many feature films, including Titus, Bless The Child, The Count of Monte Cristo, Reign of Fire, Gangs of New York, Johnny English, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, The SpongeBob Squarepants Movie, and for the Spielberg/Hanks television series Band of Brothers.

In March 2017 he was chorus master for the 50th Anniversary Concert of Procul Harum at the Royal Festival Hall; the following day he conducted a re-recording of Black Sabbath's Supertzar – he conducted the original recording with Black Sabbath in February 1975 (for the album Sabotage). In 2018, he is due to appear as chorus master for a concert celebrating the 3rd anniversary of ARW (band Featuring Jon Anderson, Trevor Rabin, Rick Wakeman). He has also recently been chorus master for \\"live music to screen\\" performances in the Royal Albert Hall of Gladiator and Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone; Beauty and the Beast follows in December 2017, more Harry Potter and other major films are scheduled at the RAH soon. He has composed, arranged and conducted music for many commercials, and in spring 2014 he was featured on screen in the Three Mobile 0800 Singing Dictionary TV adverts shown on all commercial channels filmed in Wookey Hole Caves, directing a chorus of 80 professional singers in bizarre verbal definitions. He has also conducted choruses for Arsenal Football Club, for a television commercial and also for a Club electronic Christmas card, directing from the corner flag! The Greek and Eastern Mediterranean Connection In addition to Xenakis, Lina Lalandi had also introduced Guy and Ann to the work of the Greek Byzantine Choir, under its director Lycourgos Angelopoulos. As it happens, one of their tutors at Oxford had been the Viennese musicologist Egon Wellesz who, at that time, was the foremost scholar to transcribe and document early Byzantine chant (i.e. the chant preserved in the Orthodox church, as opposed to the various strands like Gregorian chant which were developed in the Roman Catholic church in Western Europe). And it was a chance connection following a Rick Wakeman recording that introduced to Guy working closely with Vangelis. So by the mid 1980s he was involved with music stemming from Greece that was both ancient and modern. And around this time other composers, notably John Tavener in England and Christos Hatzis in Canada, were beginning to write music inspired by the Byzantine tradition. This led to a close association with the performance of music from the Eastern Mediterranean, not only from Greece itself but also from the Jewish tradition and that of the Magreb. Guy Protheroe has not only conducted, performed and recorded music from all these traditions, but also instigated and directed a number of festivals and concert series in London (see Project Direction below) and participated in a European Union project 'Medimuses' which set out to document the performing traditions of the Magreb in partnership with several partner organisations, including Écume (Échanges Culturels en Mediterranée) in Marseilles, for whom he also conducted Purcell's opera Dido and Aeneas in Tunis (ancient Carthage) with cast and musicians all drawn from around the Mediterranean, the first opera to have been produced in Tunisia for 85 years. He has collaborated with Cappella Romana, the US vocal ensemble based in Portland, Oregon and Seattle directed by Alexander Lingas, which also pioneers contemporary works related to the Byzantine tradition. In September 2010 he conducted the opening concerts of its season in Portland and Seattle, and members of CR have joined with the English Chamber Choir for recordings and performances in London, notably at the 21st International Congress of Byzantine Studies held at King's College London in 2006. Guest conducting Guy Protheroe has conducted in many countries in Europe and also the US and South America in concerts, broadcasts and recordings with orchestras, choruses and ensembles including such diverse groups as the Xenakis Ensemble in Holland (for several years as Guest Conductor), Academy of Ancient Music, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Ulster Orchestra, Orion Orchestra, Orchestra Europa, City of Santiago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus (Chile), Rosario Chamber Orchestra and Chorus (Argentina), Buenos Aires Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, Ensamble Coral (Buenos Aires), Orquestra Unisinos Anchieta and Coral Porto Alegre (Brazil), Orchestra e Coro della Svizzera Italiana (Orchestra and Chorus of Italian Switzerland), Symphony Orchestra of Płock and Vox Juventutis (Poland), Ensemble Écume (Marseille), BBC Singers, Royal Choral Society, Chelsea Opera Group, Grand Choir: Masters of Choral Singing (Moscow), Academic Choir of the Saint-Petersburg State Electrotechnical University (LETI), Greek State Opera Chorus, Kühn Choir (Prague), Band of the Royal Engineers and most of the Guards Bands. Singing While a music scholar at Magdalen College Oxford, Guy Protheroe also sang as a counter-tenor (alto) Lay Clerk at New College Oxford, where he took over from one of the best-known counter-tenors of his generation, James Bowman. On moving to London he sang with a number of prominent freelance choirs including the Monteverdi Choir under John Eliot Gardiner and the Schütz Choir with Roger Norrington, and was a member of the Choir of St Bride's Church, Fleet Street. After a few years, he switched to singing baritone and from 1993 to April 2015 was a member of the Chapel Choir of the Royal Hospital, Chelsea (home of the Chelsea Pensioners), taking over his position from the leading baritone Roderick Williams. His voice is however probably best known from tracks on the French international hit Era albums, notably Ameno (in which he is featured double-tracked, and is singing his own lyrics). This track has been used internationally in many different media and is especially familiar to many millions throughout Europe and South America, and uses range from television commercials to computer games, and even wrestling and martial arts. Cover versions include a highly successful recording by the Red Army Choir of Russia. Guy's voice has also featured as that of a monk singing chant on the film soundtracks of 1492: Conquest of Paradise, Les Visiteurs and Nostradamus – which has led to him being described as ‘the monk without the tonsure’. Project Direction Guy Protheroe has directed and originated a number of artistic projects and series, reflecting his diverse interests in the arts as a whole. These range from anniversary celebrations in words and music of literary figures such as T.S. Eliot, W.B. Yeats and Gerard Manley Hopkins to a retrospective at the Almeida Festival of the Italian avant-garde composer Sylvano Bussotti. He has long been involved in Greek music and culture. He was Artistic Director of the 1989 Greek Festival in London – a large-scale celebration of Greek culture past and present involving music, poetry, film and architecture in 50 events, based at London's South Bank Centre – and in 1990 a shorter festival devoted to Byzantine music. He also co-directed the Byzantine Festival in London held in March 1998, which presented all aspects of Byzantine culture, from literature and music to health care and cookery. The Festival included a major concert at St Paul's Cathedral in the presence of the Prince of Wales, the Syrian Patriarch of Antioch and the Greek Patriarch of Alexandria (the first time the heads of these Churches in schism from each other had met for over 1,500 years) and Archbishops from several countries. The Byzantine Festival also presented events in Plovdiv, Bulgaria in June 1999 as part of Greece's contribution to European Cultural Month there, and in April 2000 at the Megaron Concert Halls in Athens. Another major Byzantine Festival was presented in London in March 2004, including another Royal Concert in St Paul's Cathedral in which Guy Protheroe conducted the world première of Christos Hatzis's Troparion of Kassiani. He was, for the Byzantine Festival, on the Steering Committee of MediMuses, a three-year international project run from Greece and funded by the European Commission researching and promoting the history and performance of the modal music (maqam) of the Eastern and South Mediterranean. In this connection in February 2005 he hosted a unique international seminar on The Mediterranean Voice in London with many leading performers and recording artists from the Middle East and North Africa, and a major concert of ensembles from Beirut and Thessaloniki. In August 2006 he was music adviser to the 21st International Congress of Byzantine Studies (held in London and attended by over 1,000 Byzantine scholars), directing and conducting concerts and recordings. Writing and speaking Guy Protheroe has contributed to many journals and books, including The Listener, Musical Times, Music and Musicians, Tempo, Viking/Penguin Opera Guide, British Music Now, The Artist, The Expert, The Lawyer, Cambridge Papers in Modern Greek, to the European Broadcasting Union and festivals worldwide. He has appeared as a guest lecturer at a number of leading universities, including Cambridge, London, Cardiff and St Andrew's, and for other professional organisations, has been interviewed on many radio and television programmes, and has been guest dinner speaker for institutions including Lincoln's Inn. In 1974 Guy Protheroe was recruited by the BBC as a scriptwriter for Radio 3. From 1977 to 1985 he was Music Presentation Editor, then Music Information Editor, for the BBC with editorial responsibility for the BBC's written and spoken information concerning classical music and musicology, and commissioning editor for BBC printed material relating to classical music. He was also BBC representative to conferences of the European Broadcasting Union, the US Music Personnel (public radio) and the US Concert Music Broadcasters (commercial radio). Forensic musicology Since appearing as expert witness in the Vangelis Chariots of Fire High Court case in 1987, Protheroe has been constantly engaged as a musicologist by international recording artists and composers, record companies, music publishers, music production companies, advertising agencies, collection societies and legal firms. He is consulted on matters of copyright in music and lyrics (plagiarism, breach of contract, libel, claims of co-authorship and unlicensed reproduction and adaptation, copyright in arrangements) and also of copyright in sound recordings (piracy, electronic adaptation and sampling etc.). He has been consulted on around 1,000 claims of plagiarism and other copyright matters and over 3,000 investigations of piracy and sampling, the latter mainly for the IFPI (International Federation of the Phonographic Industry). He has provided opinions on many aspects of copyright, such as definition of “classical music” to the Performing Right Society and definition of “segue” in broadcasts to Phonographic Performance Limited. His High Court appearances include as the expert in the Spandau Ballet case (1999), as expert for The Sunday Times in the libel case over the authorship of The James Bond Theme (2001), and in the Young At Heart case (co-authorship arising from the input of a session player, 2002). In October 2002 he was the first Single Joint Expert in music in the Malmstedt/Roxette case. In 1999 he provided evidence in the Macarena case regarding “substantiality” in a sample – the only sampling case yet to reach the UK courts and which resulted in a settlement. In 2004 he appeared as expert in Lionel Sawkins -v- Hyperion Records (a landmark case concerning when copyright arises in editions of historical music); in Mark Taylor -v- Rive Droite Music (when is a musical work complete); and in the Patents County Court in Locksley Brown -v- Mcasso Music Production Ltd (originality in rap lyrics).

She was best known for her appearance as a contestant on the reality television show Big Brother 15 Early life Gries was born in San Angelo, Texas, on September 3, 1990, and raised on the ranch of her father, a German Texan. Before middle school, following her parent's divorce, she moved to Castle Rock, Colorado, with her mother. There she attended Douglas County High School, graduating in 2009. She spent the summers with her father in Texas. From a young age, Gries took an interest in cheerleading, serving on an Elite Cheerleading All-Star team before high school. In high school she was a part of varsity dance and varsity cheer; from 2005 to 2007, Gries served as a coach at the Castle Rock School of Gymnastics. From June 2011 to April 2012, she served as an Ice Girl cheerleader for the Texas Stars Hockey Club. Pageantry and modeling career While still in high school, Gries competed for and won the title of Miss Colorado Teen International 2007. Gries has worked locally in Texas as a specialty model, doing work for Maxim in Austin, Texas and was signed by Belle Petite as a promotional model. She was also signed to Zephyr Talent. As of part Zephyr Talent, Gries has landed numerous gigs in Texas, including modeling lingerie on the runway during Austin Fashion Week at La Zona Rosa Marketplace. She was dropped from Zephyr Talent after making racial slurs on Big Brother.  Big Brother 15  Gries appeared on Big Brother 15 in 2013. While in the house, Gries quickly formed a romantic relationship with David Girton. She was also part of the \\"Blonde-tourage\\" alliance with Girton, Kaitlin Barnaby, Jeremy McGuire, Nick Uhas, GinaMarie Zimmerman, and Jessie Kowalski. After Girton was evicted, Gries won the \\"Big Brother BBQ\\" Head of Household competition in the following week with McGuire (her teammate) and ended up taking the HOH position. She chose to target Elissa Slater for eviction, blaming her for Girton's exit. However, Slater was granted that M.V.P. power for a second week in a row and was able to flip the vote against Uhas, who was later evicted that week. Gries was nominated for eviction in the third week, though her ally McGuire was ultimately evicted from the house. She was nominated for a second consecutive time the following week, but worked out a deal with Helen Kim and Slater to stay in the game. Following the eviction of her ally Barnaby, Gries won her second Head of Household competition in \\"Roulette Me Win\\", making her the first HouseGuest to hold the title twice this season. She kept her end of the bargain with Slater and Kim, allowing them to control the nominations and orchestrate the eviction of Howard Overby. =Controversy= Gries became the center of controversy after making remarks widely condemned as racist and homophobic by the show's live feed viewers as well as host Julie Chen. These comments led to a negative reaction from many fans, and more than 27,000 people signed a petition asking that Gries be expelled from the house before she was evicted. She also became known by the moniker \\"Aaryn the Aryan\\" in several gossip blogs that covered the controversy.'Big Brother' Ousts Proud Aryan Aaryn - TheWrap On the controversy, CBS stated \\"Big Brother is a reality show about watching a group of people who have no privacy 24/7 — and seeing every moment of their lives. At times, the HouseGuests reveal prejudices and other beliefs that we do not condone. We certainly find the statements made by several of the HouseGuests on the live Internet feed to be offensive. Any views or opinions expressed in personal commentary by a HouseGuest appearing on Big Brother, either on any live feed from the house or during the broadcast, are those of the individual(s) speaking and do not represent the views or opinions of CBS or the producers of the program.\\" It was later speculated that the HouseGuests had been warned about these comments. She was seen on the show's live Internet feed referring to Herren as a \\"queer\\", and also referred to Asians as \\"squinty eyed\\". She remarked that Kim, her Korean American housemate, should \\"go make some rice.\\" In a notable confrontation with African American houseguest Candice Stewart, Williams flipped over Stewart's bed and aggressively mocked her with a stereotypical accent when Stewart expressed disapproval of the act and threatened to \\"raise hell\\" if it happened again. She also referred to Stewart as \\"Aunt Jemima\\". Many of the comments were eventually aired on the show, leading to media scrutiny and even more backlash from fans. Her comments in the house led to Aaryn losing representation from her talent agency and her job as a magazine spokesmodel. Gries's mother apologized for the offensive comments after hiring a publicist, and spoke out against the exploitation of her daughter's words for ratings in an interview given to the Los Angeles Times a few days after her eviction. She further attempted to demonstrate Gries's racial tolerance by indicating she took a young African American man to her prom as her date, claiming the man was \\"one of her closest friends through high school\\". Further, she stated \\"Aaryn's first true love was Cuban American, and she has cousins of Japanese descent who she truly loves; she has never discriminated against anyone for their sexual orientation whether within our family or not. Aaryn truly loves all people equally.\\" Gries's African- American prom date identified himself to TMZ as Mike Miller, sharing prom pictures with the online publication. Miller claimed Gries was not \\"prejudiced or hateful.\\" He also said Gries's sense of humor was that of a \\"smart-ass.\\" Gries later apologized for such comments. Personal life Gries attended Texas State University, with a major in psychology. Gries has worked locally in Texas as a specialty model, doing work for Maxim in Austin, Texas, and was signed by Belle Petite as a promotional model.

She is currently represented by DC Moore Gallery, New York.  Early life and education  Katherine Bowling grew up in Tidewater, Virginia. She received her BFA from Virginia Commonwealth University in 1978.  Painting  Bowling's first New York show, as well as her first solo exhibition, was in 1987. Bowling's works tend to be landscape paintings that often feature woods and fields as well as roads. Many of her paintings are based on her photographs of woods and fields surrounding and in Scholarie County, where she rents a house. As Molly O'Neill notes in an essay on Bowling and her work, this area is \\"fifty miles northwest of the vistas that inspired the Hudson River School painters in the mid-1800s.\\" Bowling focused in particular on the imagery of roads for the theme of her exhibition at Greenberg Van Doren, Divide. As the title implies, writes Lilly Wei in the exhibition's accompanying catalog, Bowling views the roads as \\"abstract marks in the landscape that divide and order space.\\" Even with roads she has often traveled, Bowling finds something new on closer inspection that alters her perception of the familiar and mundane. Bowling explains that the roads \\"function as a metaphor for memory and displacement.\\" In 2001, Bowling exhibited a number of seascape paintings. In her essay on the exhibition, art historian and critic Nancy Princenthal writes that, far from being an aberration from Bowling's typically home-based scenes, the ocean paintings are \\"a return to childhood memories and life long inclinations. A native of Virginia, she spent her first summers at the Atlantic shore and on the Chesapeake Bay.\\" Primarily, however, Bowling's works focus on capturing the play of light and shadow. Art critic Eleanor Heartney notes that \\"Her paintings, like those of Monet, Pissarro, and Renoir, focus on the ephemeral moment and the fleeting impression, conjuring the flicker of sunlight through the trees, the shifting shadows of early evening, the reflections of clouds and foliage glancing across the rippling surface of a lake.\\" O'Neill argues that Bowling additionally \\"has an innate sense of abstraction and she ranges happy as an uncaged chicken, pecking elements from the Impressionists' obsession with light; from modern photography; and the drip paintings of Jackson Pollock.\\" Bowling is influenced by the use of light in the paintings of European Romantics such as J.M.W. Turner and John Constable as well as by the later work of George Inness. Her paintings also recall landscapes by Claude Lorraine, Albert Pinkham Ryder and Camille Corot. = Process = Bowling is known for her use of spackle. She uses a long process of layering and sanding to create the \\"back-lit\\" effect found in her paintings. First, the paintings begin as photographs which she typically takes near her rented house in the Hudson Valley. Then, she uses these photographs, which serve as her \\"preliminary drawings,\\" to aid in the painting process. She also paints from memory and direct observation. Bowling paints on square panels of plywood. Bowling considers rectangular pieces to be too horizontal and rife of implications already of landscapes and horizons. She sometimes paints on one of these square and sometimes paints on several square panels together. The seams between these adjoined panels are left visible. Next, Bowling applies layers of spackle. O'Neill remarks that \\"Inspired, perhaps, by her day job of painting houses, [Bowling] turned to more industrial media: damp vinyl spackle, a building compound that is applied to wooden panels to create a matte, fresco-like surface. Thinned oil pigments are poured, allowed to dry, and then the Sisyphean task of sanding begins.\\" Initial layers generally correspond with the color of the light—varying from pinks, golds, blues, and oranges. Through this layering and sanding, she creates a luminous quality in her landscapes. Despite rigorous sanding, air bubbles within the spackle layers are revealed occasionally on the surface. Rather than disguise them, Bowling integrates them. Heartney writes that Bowling \\"allows these irregularities to become part of the painting so that the viewer's perception of the play of light and shadow across the image cannot be separated from an awareness of surface itself.\\" In later stages of painting, Bowling stands above panels to throw, dribble, and splatter paint with a hair dryer, recalling the techniques of Abstract Expressionists such as Jackson Pollock.
