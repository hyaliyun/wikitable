He wrote the popular science books The Cosmic Code (1982), Perfect Symmetry (1985), and The Dreams of Reason: The Computer and the Rise of the Sciences of Complexity (1988). Biography Pagels obtained his PhD in elementary particle physics from Stanford University under the guidance of Sidney Drell.Part of this PhD research was published in the article S. D. Drell and H. R. Pagels, \\"Anomalous Magnetic Moment of the Electron, Muon, and Nucleon\\", Phys. Rev. 140, B397 - B407 (1965). His technical work included the Physics Reports review articles Quantum Chromodynamics (with W.Marciano) and \\"Departures from Chiral Symmetry\\". A number of his published papers dealt with the source of the mass of elementary particles in quantum field theory, especially the Nambu–Goldstone realization of chiral symmetry breaking. He also published (with David Atkatz) a visionary paper entitled \\"Origin of the Universe as a quantum tunneling event\\" (1982)Phys. Rev. D 25, 2065–2073 (1982) that prefigured later work done in the field. The list of his graduate students includes Dan Caldi, Saul Stokar and Seth Lloyd. Pagels was an outspoken critic of those he believed misrepresented the discoveries and ideas of science to promote mysticism and pseudoscience. In his capacity as executive director of the New York Academy of Science in 1986, Pagels submitted an affidavit in a case involving a former member of the Transcendental Meditation movement who had sued the organization for fraud.Skolnick, A.A. \\"Maharishi Ayur-Veda: Guru's marketing scheme promises the world eternal 'perfect health'.\\" Journal of the American Medical Association. 1991 Oct 2;266(13):1741–2, 1744–5, 1749–50 As president of the International League for Human Rights, Pagels worked to support freedom for researchers in other countries. He was a fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at New York University, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, a member of the Science and Law Committee of the New York Bar Association, and a trustee of the New York Hall of Science. In 1969, Pagels married Elaine Pagels, later theology professor, author, and MacArthur Fellow.Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World – Page 1062 Mary Zeiss Stange, Carol K. Oyster, Jane E. Sloan – 2011. In 1969, she married Heinz R. Pagels, a noted theoretical physicist, and subsequently gave birth to two children. Their son Mark died in 1987 after a four-year illness. The couple had an adopted daughter Sarah and an adopted son David. Heinz Pagels died in 1988 in a mountain climbing accident on Pyramid Peak, a 14,000-foot summit 10 miles to the southwest of the Aspen Center for Physics, where he spent his summers. Many writers of his obituary quote a dream he wrote about in his book The Cosmic Code: Pagels' work in chaos theory provided the inspiration for the character of Ian Malcolm in Michael Crichton's novel Jurassic Park.Crichton, Michael, Jurassic Park (1990). NY: Ballantine Books. Page unnumbered, information listed in Acknowledgments. Pagels was a 1956 graduate of Woodberry Forest School in Virginia. The school awards The Heinz R. Pagels Jr. Physics Memorial Award each year to a graduating student who has demonstrated outstanding achievement in physics. Popular writings Pagels had a gift for explaining complex topics in easy to understand terms, avoiding both oversimplification and needless technicalities. The cosmologist David Schramm described Pagels' first book The Cosmic Code as \\"a beautiful account of modern physics\\". In reviewing Pagels' 1985 book Perfect Symmetry, Schramm wrote: \\"Heinz Pagels is one of less than a handful of active scientists who can write excellent prose about the scientific frontier for a general audience.\\" In his book, The Cosmic Code, Pagels wrote: \\"Science is not the enemy of humanity but one of the deepest expressions of the human desire to realize that vision of infinite knowledge,\\" \\"Our capacity for fulfillment can come only through faith and feelings. But our capacity for survival must come from reason and knowledge.\\" Science, he warned, is not \\"as resilient as commerce, religion, or politics. It needs careful nurturing.\\" If humankind ultimately abandons science, it would be \\"an error that might cost us our existence.\\"Pagels, Heinz, The Cosmic Code (1982).

France's independent court system enjoys special statutory protection from the executive branch. Procedures for the appointment, promotion, and removal of judges vary depending on whether it is for the ordinary (\\"\\") or administrative stream. Judicial appointments in the judicial stream must be approved by a special panel, the High Council of the Judiciary. Once appointed, career judges serve for life and cannot be removed without specific disciplinary proceedings conducted before the Council with due process. The Ministry of Justice handles the administration of courts and the judiciary, including paying salaries or constructing new courthouses. The Ministry also funds and administers the prison system. Lastly, it receives and processes applications for presidential pardons and proposes legislation dealing with matters of civil or criminal justice. The Minister of Justice is also the head of public prosecution, though this is controversial since it is seen to represent a conflict of interest in cases such as political corruption against politicians. At the basic level, the courts can be seen as organized into: *ordinary courts ('), which handle criminal and civil litigation *administrative courts ('), which supervise the government and handle complaints The structure of the French judiciary is divided into three tiers: *Inferior courts of original and general jurisdiction *Intermediate appellate courts which hear cases on appeal from lower courts *Courts of last resort which hear appeals from lower appellate courts on the interpretation of law. There are exceptions to this scheme, as noted below. Glossary There exist significant problems with applying non-French terminology and concepts related to law and justice to the French justice system. For this reason, a glossary has been provided to define many of the key terms used in the rest of the article. *appel \\"appeal\\": for almost all courts in France (except very minor cases), it is possible to appeal the ruling, both for disagreement on how the court appreciated the facts or on disagreements with how the court interpreted the law. Another recourse is cassation. *Cassation The supreme courts (Cour de Cassation and Conseil d'État) act as cassation jurisdictions, which means that they have supreme jurisdiction in quashing the judgments of inferior courts if those courts misapplied law. Generally, cassation is based not on outright violations of law, but on diverging interpretations of law between the courts. Cassation is not based on the facts of the case. Cassation is always open as a final recourse. *chambre \\"division\\": subdivisions of a large court of general jurisdiction, which may be each specialized on a specific area of law. *Code \\"law code\\": collection of enacted statutory law or regulations relating to a single topic. Modern French law codes date back to the Napoleonic Code, though all codes have since been thoroughly revised or even rewritten. Some codes were written as such; others were codified by taking existing statutes and statutory instruments (regulations and orders) and re-organizing them into a single law code. *commissaire du gouvernement \\"Commissioner-in-Council\\": unaffiliated judicial officer who advise the government in cases heard by administrative courts or regional audit courts. Despite their title, they are not commissioned by the executive but are drawn from a court's active judges. They do not represent the government. Because of the confusing terminology, they were renamed rapporteur public (public report drafter). *Contradictoire. There is a requirement that all justice should render a decision after a débat contradictoire, which means that all suspects, or people risking a penalty, should be able to contradict the allegations that they face. This implies, for instance, that they should be able to have an attorney to defend them, and that this attorney should have access to the prosecution files. Another implication is that trials in absentia (that is, without the presence of the suspect) had limited legal consequences, since it is a requirement of the débat contradictoire that the suspect should be able to speak for himself or herself. *contravention \\"misdemeanor, summary offence\\": lowest kind of crimes punishable by fines or, in the past, at most short jail sentences. They consist mostly of minor parking and traffic violations. *crime \\"major felony, major indictable offence\\": severest crime punishable by a prison sentence greater of 10 or more years; the vast majority of crimes committed are, in decreasing frequency, rape and homicide. *délit \\"minor felony, minor indictable offence\\": intermediate crimes punishable by prison sentences of fewer than 10 years; includes theft. Let us also note the délit de fuite — fleeing the scene of an accident with the knowledge that it had resulted in severe bodily harm to other parties, or fleeing from the police. *Inamovibilité \\"security of tenure\\": judges cannot be removed from office, except through specific disciplinary proceedings (conducted by the National Judicial Council, an independent tribunal), for infringements on their duties. They may be moved or promoted only with their consent. These protections are meant to ensure that they are independent from the executive power. *Jurisprudence While French judges, in the civil law tradition, do not create law, and thus there is no precedent or case law properly said, they may interpret existing statute law, as well as generic principles derived from the French Constitution and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. In particular, the decisions of the higher courts are of great importance and may establish long-lasting doctrine known as jurisprudence constante. While there is no stare decisis rule forcing lower courts to decide according to precedent, they tend to do so in practice with respect to jurisprudence constante. *magistrat \\"judicial officer\\": general term encompassing judges (magistrats du siège) and prosecutors (parquet); the magistrature, or \\"judiciary\\", is a collective term for all judicial officers. Magistrats are government employees, but statutorily kept separate and independent from the other branches of government. Magistrats are expected to maintain a certain degree of distance (as is the case with all government employees); that is, they must refrain from actions and statements that could hinder their impartiality or make it appear that their impartiality is compromised, e.g., refrain from making public political statements. The Ecole Nationale de la Magistrature, or \\"National Judicial Academy\\" in Bordeaux is responsible for educating judges and therefore only admits French nationals. *ordre administratif \\"administrative courts, administrative stream\\": courts of this order judge most cases against the government. *ordre judiciaire \\"judicial courts, judicial stream\\": courts of this order judge civil and criminal cases. *Paritaire Regarding certain courts, commissions and other bodies making decisions with respect to two opposed groups of persons, this means that the body contains representatives from the two groups in equal proportion (parity). *parquet \\"Office of the Prosecutor\\": responsible for the prosecution of cases. It is headed by the procureur. It requests enquiries to be made; during court hearings, it brings forward accusations against the suspect. In addition, it has a role of general monitoring of courts. In the case of an appellate or a cassation court, the parquet is called parquet général. The name parquet means \\"wooden floor\\" in French; possible etymologies for the judicial use include the fact that the prosecutors speak from the floor of the courtroom (as opposed to the judges, who are in a higher elevation), and the possible meaning of \\"small park\\", alluding to a small enclosure in which attorneys stayed inside the courtroom. *président \\"presiding justice\\": chief judge of a division of a court; premier président or President of the Court refers to the Chief Justice. *procureur \\"public prosecutor\\": This occupation in the magistrature can be translated into prosecutor, but the functions of the procureur also include the general monitoring of the activity of the court in both criminal and civil cases (say, to see if judges apply the law in a consistent manner). The procureur in a court of appeal or higher court is a procureur général or an avocat général. *Publicité All civil, administrative and criminal justice, as well as all financial cases where individuals may be fined, end up with audiences open to the public. There are narrow exceptions to this requirement: cases involving national security secrets, as well as cases of rape and other sexual attacks, may be closed or partially closed to the public, respectively in order to protect the secret or in order not to add to the pain of the victim. Cases with defendants who are minors (or rather, defendants who were minors at the time of the crime) are not open to the public and the names of the defendants are not made public, so that they are not stigmatized for life. *siège \\"Bench\\": seat of justice and, by extension, the judges sitting on the panel trying the case. The magistrats du siège, or professional judicial career judges, are said to be inamovible, that is, they cannot be transferred without their consent. *tribunal: generally refers to a court of record of first instance having original jurisdiction and whose judgments are appealable. LawProcedural= While in Germanic Europe the supreme courts can and do tend to write more verbose opinions supported by legal reasoning, the typical Francophone court of cassation decision is short, concise and devoid of explanation or justification. There is no stare decisis, or principle of precedent, binding lower courts to respect superior courts' rulings (case law) on questions of law; but a line of similar case decisions, while not precedent per se, forms the jurisprudence constante. =Criminal= Public offenses are categorized as: * ', serious felonies, which are heard by the Assize Court (') * ', less serious felonies and misdemeanors, which are heard by the Criminal Court (', also called the Correctional Court) * ', minor offenses and violations, which are heard by the Police Court (', also called the Police Tribunal) For petty misdemeanors like most traffic violations, suspected offenders may either plea nolo contendere and pay a set fine amount (amende forfaitaire) or contest the charge in court. The court may then find the defendant innocent or guilty, but if found guilty, they are liable to be sentenced a higher fine. If it is done Organization French court organization. At the basic level, the courts can be seen as organized into: *ordinary courts ('), which handle criminal and civil litigation *administrative courts ('), which supervise the government and handle complaints =Ordinary=Minor jurisdiction At the bottom of the court hierarchy are the courts of minor jurisdiction. The Police Court (', also called the Police Tribunal) hears ', minor criminal offenses such as traffic violations, minor assaults, and breaches of the peace. The Civil Court (') hears minor civil cases. Major jurisdiction The next tier are the courts of major jurisdiction. When the court hears ', less serious felonies and misdemeanors, it is called a Criminal Court (', also called a Correctional Court). When the court sits to hear civil matters, it is called a Civil Court (', also called a Grand Instance Court). It has general jurisdiction for civil matters over 10 000 €. Litigants are statutorily required to be represented by a lawyer, or '. The court also sits as a Juvenile Court ('). The courts are normally composed of 3 judges, but some offenses such as traffic offenses, soft drugs, and misuse of credit cards and checking accounts may be heard by 1 judge. Specialized jurisdiction The Labour Court (France) (conseil de prud'hommes) hears disputes and suits between employers and employees (apart from cases devoted to administrative courts); the court is said to be ' because it is composed of equal numbers of representatives from employer unions, e.g., MEDEF and CGPME, and employee unions. The Agricultural Land Tribunal (') hears cases dealing with long-term leases for farm land estates. The Social security tribunal (') hears suits over welfare and state benefits. The Business Court (tribunal de commerce) hears matters involving trade and business disputes and the panel is elected from the local business community. Court of Assize The Court of Assize (', also called a Court of Sessions) sits in each of the departments of France with original and appellate jurisdiction over ', or serious felonies. As a court of first instance, it is normally composed of 3 judges and 9 jurors, but in some cases involving terrorism and the illegal drug trade the court may sit as 3 judges alone. When it sits as a court of appeal, it is composed of 3 judges. Court of Appeal The Court of Appeal (') handles appeals from most lower courts. It is composed of 3 judges. The Court is divided into a number of divisions or courts: social security, business, general civil, and criminal. Formerly, it required the intervention of a solicitor or case attorney (avoué) to prepare and manage the case and to act as an intermediary between the barrister and the appellant or appellee; the functions of the avoué were abolished in 2012. Appeals may take anywhere from 18 to 24 months, if not longer. Court of Cassation The Court of Cassation (') is the highest level of appeal in France. These courts sit in six chambers with fifteen judges in each; however, only seven judges need to be present to hear a case. There are more than 120 judges serving in the court. The Court of Cassation hears appeals from the assize courts and the courts of appeal.Dammer, H.R. & Albanese, J.S. (2014). Comparative criminal justice systems. (5th ed). Wadesworth Cengage learning: Belmont, CA. Criminal cases are heard in only one of the court's five chambers and the court has no legal authority to deny a criminal appeal. The Court is referred to as the guardian of the law. It only reviews questions of law, not questions of fact. The Court’s essential purpose is to ensure that the interpretation of the law is uniform throughout the country. The Court is located in the Hall of Justice building in Paris. It was established in 1790 under the name ' during the French Revolution, and its original purpose was to act as a court of error with revisionary jurisdiction over lower provincial prerogative courts ('). However, much about the Court continues the earlier Paris Parliament Court. =Administrative=Administrative courts of general jurisdiction=Administrative courtAppellate administrative courtCouncil of State=Financial courts The financial courts - national Court of Audit (cour des comptes) and regional audit courts (chambres régionales des comptes) - have jurisdiction to try cases involving possible misuse of public funds, and, in some rare instances, of private funds. They are empowered and mandated by Article 15 of the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen which set forth that French citizens have the right to hold public officers, agents, and officials accountable for the finances they oversee and operate. The courts' roles and responsibilities are laid out in the Financial Court Code. Jurisdictional court The Jurisdictional Court, or tribunal des conflits, handles conflicts between the civil system of justice and the administrative system of justice. There are two kinds of conflicts: *Positive conflict: both systems consider themselves competent for the same case. *Negative conflict: both systems consider that the other system is competent for the case, resulting in a denial of justice. In both cases, the tribunal des conflits will render final judgment on which system is competent. =Constitutional Council= The Constitutional Council (') practices judicial review of legislative acts and laws. The ordinary and administrative courts have refused to perform this type of judicial review, outside of 2 exceptions in 1851. It supervises controversies of elections and performs judicial review by determining the constitutionality of parliamentary legislation. Jurisdiction The Court of Audit and regional audit courts mostly adjudicate cases regarding public funds, carrying out: *Mandatory audits of public accountants to track national and local government funds. *Discretionary audits of public corporations, publicly subsidized private organizations, and social security and welfare agencies. *Since 1999, audits of private charities who regularly receive public donations. Neither national or regional audit courts hear cases related to private organizations, with the few exceptions noted here. Instead, financial cases concerning private funds and money fall within the jurisdiction of the civil justice system. Prior to 1982, France only had a single national Court of Audit. With a push toward decentralization in the creation of province-like administrative regions and the increased role of local elected officials and considering the Court's enormous docket, France saw fit to establish regional audit courts. The national court now deals primarily with the government, public establishments, and (semi-)public companies on a national level, while the regional courts handle the local level. The court may occasionally delegate national-level audits to regional courts, as is often the case with post-secondary educational facilities. An important concept in the business of the financial courts is the difference between, in French public accountings, between ordonnateurs (managers who order expenses and perception of payments) and payeurs (the public accountants who pay expenses and recoup debts). The Court only judges public accountants; but it may also make observations about the decisions taken by the ordonnateurs, and possibly send them before other courts for mismanagement (see below). Activities These jurisdictions act as courts in the ordinary sense of the word in some limited circumstances. That is, they judge the accounting of public accountants (comptables publics) and may fine them in case of certain failures: *They may fine public accountants if they are late in handing over their accounting. *They may find that the accountant neglected to collect money owed to the state (or other government) or, through negligence, unduly gave away state (or other government) money. The responsibility of the public accountant in those circumstances is personal and unlimited, meaning that he or she has to refund all lost money. This situation is known as débet (from Latin: \\"he owes\\"). Because of the possibility of débet, all public accountants must have external warranty as well as insurance. In practice, many débets grossly exceed the financial means of the public accountants concerned, and the Minister of Finance may end up pardoning the debt (remise gracieuse). *They may find that somebody or some organization did accounting operations on public funds whereas they were not public accountants. In those circumstances, they are found to be de facto public accountants (comptables de fait) and they face the same constraints and penalties as de jure public accountants. In addition, the Cour des Comptes supports and provides half of the judges of the Cour de discipline financière et budgétaire (Court of financial and budgetary discipline), the other half being provided by the Conseil d'État. This court tries ordonnateurs — that is, the persons who order expenses and the recovery of debts, and may fine them for undue expenses or for sums that they should have decided to recover. However, the court cannot try government ministers, or (in almost all cases), local elected officials; thus, with few exceptions, the only ordonnateurs that face the court are civil servants. If the Cour des Comptes or the regional chambers discern criminal behavior in the accounts that they audit, they refer the matter to the appropriate criminal court. Most of the activity of the Cour des Comptes and the regional chambers is not of a judicial kind (juridictionnel); rather, they act as a general auditing system. However, even for these activities, they act with almost complete independence of both the executive and the legislative branches. The court and chambers may advise, or reprimand, ministries, administrations and public establishments that they audited. The court and chamber publish a yearly report in which it discusses a selection of misuses of funds and other incidents. In addition, they may also publish specialized reports. The court and chambers are free to inquire on whatever they wish within their field of competency; the court may also be commissioned reports by Parliament. In all these advisory and publishing activities, the court and chambers do not limit themselves to pure accounting issues, but they also take the efficiency of public services into account. They may, for instance, criticize an expense that was legally ordered and accounted for, but which was inappropriate with respect to criteria of good financial management. The 2001 Loi d'orientation sur les lois de finances (LOLF, law fixing the framework for budget acts) changed the way budget was passed in France: now, budget is attributed to specific missions, and the efficiency of spending on each mission is to be assessed. In that context, the court's missions will include an increased dose of assessment of efficiency.

Tahdiya is a clause in Islam that would permit a Muslim to lie to an enemy (and the Infidel)and even create a peace treaty which he plans to renege on, in the name of Allah. The concept is drawn out from the story of Mohammed and the Bnei Koraish (a Jewish Tribe). They fought a battle but neither side was winning. So they made a treaty, and went back to their encampments. Once the Jews had set aside their weapons and begun to learn the Torah and go to sleep, Mohammed and his followers sneaked in during the night and slaughtered the Jews as they slept.

The system is also a binary star system made up of two stars and possibly a third. As of 2005, two extrasolar planets are known to orbit the primary star.  Stellar components  The primary star of the system (catalogued as Gliese 777A) is a yellow subgiant, a Sun-like star that is ceasing fusing hydrogen in its core. The star is much older than the Sun, about 6.7 billion years old. It is 4% less massive than the Sun. It is also rather metal-rich, having about 70% more \\"metals\\" (elements heavier than helium) than the Sun, which is typical for stars with extrasolar planets. The secondary star (Gliese 777B) is a distant, dim red dwarf star orbiting the primary at a distance of 3,000 astronomical units. One orbit takes at least tens of thousands of years to complete. The star itself may be a binary, the secondary being a very dim red dwarf. Not much information is available on the star system.  Planetary system  In 2002 a discovery of a long-period, wide-orbiting planet (Gliese 777b) was announced by the Geneva extrasolar planet search team. The planet orbited in circular path and the orbital eccentricity was increased in later measurements (e=0.36). The planet was \\"Jupiter-twin\\" and was turned to \\"eccentric Jupiter\\" with mass about 1.5 times Jupiter and about the same size. In 2005 further observation of the star show another amplitude with a period of 17.1 days. This indicates one of the smallest discovered planets at the time. The mass was only 18 times more than Earth or about same as Neptune with very low eccentricity. There was a METI message sent to Gliese 777. It was transmitted from Eurasia's largest radar, 70-meter Eupatoria Planetary Radar. The message was named Cosmic Call 1; it was sent on July 1, 1999, and it will arrive at Gliese 777 in April 2051.

Synopsis  The book predominantly recounts Ralston's experience being trapped in the canyon and how he was forced to amputate his own right arm with a dull multi-tool in order to free himself after the arm became trapped by a boulder. It also describes Ralston's childhood, how he took up outdoor activities after moving to Colorado from Indiana, how he came to be an obsessive outdoorsman and how he left his engineering career at Intel in Arizona to take up outdoor activities as much as possible. The book goes back and forth, in alternating chapters, between Ralston's past experiences and his entrapment in the slot canyon, and the efforts of his mother to find him. Included in some editions are pictures of his days in the canyon, various photos from the past excursions he speaks of in the book, a glossary of mountaineering jargon, and maps of Bluejohn Canyon and the proximity of the canyon in central-eastern Utah.  Reception  Inc. magazine named Ralston's account one of seven \\"great entrepreneurship books that have nothing to do with business.\\"  Adaptation  The book was adapted into the 2010 film 127 Hours, starring James Franco as Ralston and directed by Danny Boyle. Since the film's release, the autobiography has also been sold with the title 127 Hours: Between a Rock and a Hard Place. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor.

History of the church The church was established in 1922. after dissolution of Austro-Hungarian empire. The church opposed the Nazis in World War II. After the Communist coup d'état of 1948, the Lutheran Church lost control over its schools and social services, and many church periodicals ceased to be published. More than one hundred clergy were persecuted; many were imprisoned and restrained from exercising their ministry. Until 1989 the Church lived under the strict control of the regime and in 1993 the Synod adopted a new constitution. Number of adherents and beliefs The ECAV is the second largest church in Slovakia (c. 7% of population). It considers the Gospel as contained in the Bible to be the source of faith in the triune God and the rule for life. Jesus is regarded as the head of the Church and it functions on the basis of the equality of God’s children. The Augsburg Confession is recognized as a correct explanation of central issues of faith. At present there are 326 congregations grouped into 14 conferences (seniorats), and two districts: the East and the West Districts. There are about 355 active clergy. The Church administers 657 functional churches and ecclesiastical buildings. Relations with other churches ECAV is a member of the Lutheran World Federation, the Conference of European Churches, and the World Council of Churches. Slovak Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Serbia Most members of the Slovak ethnic community in Vojvodina (Serbia) are adherents of the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession, under jurisdiction of Bishop of Novi Sad.

Designated a National Historic Landmark District and a city Cultural District, it is one of the city's oldest neighborhoods and originally was home to the city's wealthiest and most fashionable families. The name derives from the Mount Vernon home of George Washington; the original Washington Monument, a massive pillar commenced in 1815 to commemorate the first president of the United States, is the defining feature of the neighborhood.  Overview  The Baltimore City Planning Commission defines the neighborhood as being bound by Eager Street to the North, The Jones Falls Expressway (JFX) to the east, Franklin Street to the South, and Eutaw Street to the West. The Commission also considers the northern section to be the Midtown-Belvedere neighborhood after the Belvidere estate of John Eager Howard, the Revolutionary War patriot. The Inner Harbor is about half a mile south of Centre Street. Being close to downtown, Mount Vernon is well-served by public transit. Many area major bus routes head through the neighborhood on their way to the financial district including the Purple Line of Charm City Circulator which runs through Mt. Vernon northbound on Charles Street and southbound on St. Paul Street. The Light Rail line runs along Howard Street on the west edge of the neighborhood, and the Metro Subway runs beneath Eutaw Street a block west of that; both have stations within easy walking distance of the neighborhood. Penn Station, served by Amtrak and MARC commuter rail, is also one block to the north past Mount Royal Avenue and over the JFX. Mt Vernon Place UMC Although mainly residential, Mount Vernon-Belvedere is home to a mix of institutions, including the Peabody Conservatory of the Johns Hopkins University, Walters Art Museum, University of Baltimore, Maryland Historical Society, Contemporary Museum, Maryland Institute College of Art, Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, Baltimore School for the Arts, Lyric Opera House, Center Stage, Enoch Pratt Free Library Central Branch, Spotlighters Theatre, the Eubie Blake National Jazz Institute, and the Peabody Bookshop and Beer Stube (demolished 1997). In the decades after World War II, the neighborhood has also become home to many professional service providers, including medical and legal offices, publishing firms, architectural firms, insurance and financial institutions, and fund managers. Art galleries, retail stores, hotels, and bed and breakfasts (B&Bs;) also populate the neighborhood, and Mount Vernon has a rich nightlife, with a variety of restaurants, cafes, and bars located along N Charles Street and throughout the neighborhood. During the 1970s, Mount Vernon began to form into a gay village for Baltimore with the establishment of the Gay and Lesbian Community Center of Baltimore (GLCCB) in 1977, now known as the Pride Center of Maryland. LGBT milestones included the first Pride parade in 1975, and the creation of the GLCCB Health Clinic in 1980.  Architectural history  The centerpiece of the Mount Vernon neighborhood, the cruciform arrangement of parks surrounding the Washington monument, represent one of the nation's first examples of city planning for the express purpose of highlighting a monument. The Washington Monument was completed in 1829 to a design by Robert Mills, and in 1831 the Howard family was granted permission to lay out the surrounding parks. The parks are now lined by stately homes. The parks, which have survived almost intact, are considered to be the finest existing urban landscapes by the Beaux-Arts architectural firm of Carrere & Hastings, who also designed the New York Public Library, portions of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., and the residence that houses the Frick Collection. Elsewhere in the neighborhood are many older apartment buildings and three- and four-story rowhouses; most of the latter were originally single-family dwellings. Though many have been broken up into multiple apartments, a growing number are being restored back to single family use. The historic beaux-arts Belvedere Hotel, opened in 1903, was converted to condominiums in 1991. On the northeast corner of Washington's monument sits the Mount Vernon Place United Methodist Church. Conceived as a cathedral of Methodism, it was built on the site of the Charles Howard mansion – the house in which Francis Scott Key died. The southeast corner is occupied entirely by buildings comprising the Peabody Institute, and the southwest corner includes three buildings forming the Walters Art Museum. The Stafford Hotel, built in Mount Vernon in 1894, now serves as an apartment building for students at Johns Hopkins University. The old Mount Vernon Hotel, built in 1847, was the mansion home of U.S. Congressman William Julian Albert (1816–1879) where he entertained Abraham Lincoln. Later the house was converted into a hotel (1867) and was where Oscar Wilde stayed as part of his 1882 lecture tour of America. The building is extant at 702 Cathedral Street, in the district. A portion of the neighborhood, mainly to the west and south of the Washington Monument, was designated a National Historic Landmark District on November 11, 1971, for the significance in architecture and landscape planning. It is included within the Baltimore National Heritage Area. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 4,520 people living in the neighborhood. The racial makeup of Mount Vernon was 55.3% White, 33.4% African American, 0.2% Native American, 7.4% Asian, 1.2% from other races, and 2.3% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.1% of the population. 60.4% of the population were employed, 3.5% were unemployed, and 36.0% were not in the labor force, a reflection in part of the student population. The median household income was $21,225. About 15.2% of families and 26.9% of the population were below the poverty line. 5.6% of occupied housing units were owner-occupied. 10.2% of housing units were vacant. Education Public schools are operated by the Baltimore City Public School System. This includes the Baltimore School for the Arts on Cathedral Avenue. In 2010 Baltimore Leadership School for Young Women (BLSYW), a charter secondary school for girls, moved into its permanent campus, the former headquarters of the Greater Baltimore Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) in Mount Vernon. The BLSYW was the first newly established public school in that area in three decades.

Central America jets  Chlorophyll growth due to nutrients mixed by 2001 winter jets Mountain jet effects are apparent in average temperatures around Central America The North Pacific east of about 120°W is strongly influenced by winds blowing through gaps in the Central American cordillera. Air flow in the region forms the Intra-Americas Low-Level Jet, a westward flow about 1 km above sea level. This flow, trade winds, and cold air flowing south from North America contribute to winds flowing through several mountain valleys. Along Central America are three main wind jets through breaks in the American Cordillera, on the Pacific Ocean side due to prevailing winds. * Tehuano wind blows from the Gulf of Mexico through Chivela Pass in Mexico's Isthmus of Tehuantepec and out over the Gulf of Tehuantepec on the Pacific coast. Chivela Pass is a gap between the Sierra Madre del Sur and the Sierra Madre range to the south. * Papagayo wind shrieks over the lakes of Nicaragua and pushes far out over the Gulf of Papagayo on the Pacific coast. The Cordillera Central Mountains rise to the south, gradually descending to Gatun Lake and the Isthmus of Panama. * Panama winds slice through to the Pacific through the Gaillard Cut in Panama, which also holds the Panama Canal. = Cause = The air flow is due to surges of cold dense air originating from the North American continent. The meteorological mechanism that causes Tehuano and Papagayo winds is relatively simple. In the winter, cold high-pressure weather systems move southward from North America over the Gulf of Mexico. These high pressure systems create strong pressure gradients between the atmosphere over the Gulf of Mexico and the warmer, moister atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean. Just as a river flows from high elevations to lower elevations, the air in the high pressure system will flow \\"downhill\\" toward lower pressure, but the Cordillera mountains block the flow of air, channeling it through Chivela Pass in Mexico, the lake district of Nicaragua, and also Gaillard (Culebra) Cut in Panama. Many times, a Tehuano wind is followed by Papagayo and Panama winds a few days later as the high pressure system moves south. The arrival of these cold surges, and their associated anticyclonic circulation, strengthens the trade winds at low latitudes, and this effect can last for several days. The wind flow over Central America is actually composed of the confluence of two air streams; one from the north, associated with cold surges, and the other from the northeast, associated with trade winds north of South America. = Local effects = The winds blow at speeds of 80 km/h or more down the hillsides from Chivela Pass and over the waters of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, sometimes extending more than 500 miles (800 km) into the Pacific Ocean. The surface waters under the Gulf of Tehuantepec wind jet can cool by as much as 10 °C in a day. In addition to the cold water that is detectable from other satellite sensors, the ocean's response to these winds shows up in satellite estimates of chlorophyll from ocean color measurements. The cold water and high chlorophyll concentration are signatures of mixing and upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich deep water. Fish converge on this food source, which supports the highly successful fishing industry in the Gulf of Tehuantepec.

History  Radical Dance Faction (RDF) were founded by Chris Bowsher in Hungerford in 1986. Originally known as 'Military Surplus', the band has experienced many line up changes, with at least thirty different people having been part of the band at one time or another. Bowsher is the only person who has been in every line up of the band. RDF's music combines punk, dub, and ska, while Bowsher's lyrics, spoken rather than sung, deal mainly with political issues, such as the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 in the song \\"Chinese Poem\\". Bowsher also witnessed first hand the Hungerford massacre, describing his experience in the song \\"Hot on the Wire\\". In 1990, they signed to Southern Records, releasing two albums on their own imprint Earthzone and going on to tour Germany and other parts of Europe. One tour was as the support act to Rebel MC and they also supported Ziggy Marley at one point. RDF appeared at the huge Summerjam festival in Germany, July 1993. RDF were a regular act on the UK free festival scene prior to the 1994 Criminal Justice Act, and were part of the crusty/anarcho punk movement until they called it day in the mid 1990s. Their final album (until reformation) Raggamuffin Statement was a mixture of live recordings and remixes with new songs, including \\"Martin Foran\\", about the wrongly convicted prisoner. The band reformed in 2006, playing various festivals around the UK during 2007. They reformed again in 2012 and appeared at the Bearded Theory festival in Derby. The band commenced a short tour in October 2012 to promote new album - Ammunition. In recent years they have performed at Glastonbury, Boomtown, Rebellion, Willow Man and Green Gathering festivals. In 2018 RDF released their latest work, Daydream Dystopia, produced by Youth Sounds.

It is the state's longest highway, traveling across the northern areas of Washington, from U.S. Route 101 (US 101) at Discovery Bay on the Olympic Peninsula to US 2 near the Idaho state border in Newport. The highway travels across Whidbey Island, North Cascades National Park, the Okanagan Highland, the Kettle River Range, and the Selkirk Mountains. SR 20 connects several major north–south state highways, including Interstate 5 (I-5) in Burlington, US 97 through the Okanogan–Omak area, SR 21 in Republic, and US 395 from Kettle Falls to Colville. SR 20's path across the Cascades follows one of the oldest state roads in Washington, established in 1896 as a wagon route. The wagon road fell into disuse within a decade, and the state government postponed the construction of a new route across the North Cascades for several decades. The development of the Skagit River Hydroelectric Project spurred boosters to lobby the state for a new route across Washington Pass, which was opened in 1972. SR 20 originally ran from the Mount Vernon area to Okanogan. By 1973, SR 20 was extended over existing state highways in northern Washington, replacing SR 113 and portions of SR 525 and SR 536 near Port Townsend; SR 30 and SR 294 from Tonasket to Tiger; and part of SR 31 from Tiger to Newport. Although US 12 has a larger east–west extent, SR 20 is the longest highway in Washington at , only longer than US 12. The highway has been called \\"The Most Beautiful Mountain Highway in the State of Washington.\\" Route description Liberty Bell Mountain from elevation Washington Pass on North Cascades Highway SR 20 begins at a wye junction with US 101 at the southwest end of Discovery Bay on the Olympic Peninsula, just north of the terminus of SR 104\\\\. The highway travels northerly through the rural Quimper Peninsula and follows the east shore of Discovery Bay before reaching a junction with SR 19 near Jefferson County International Airport. SR 20 turns north onto the highway and passes Fort Townsend State Park on the southern outskirts of Port Townsend near Glen Cove. Within Port Townsend, the highway travels east through suburban areas as Sims Way and towards the historic downtown as Water Street. To the southwest of Port Townsend's historic district, the route turns southeast into the city ferry terminal. SR 20 continues onto the Port Townsend–Coupeville ferry which travels northeast across the Admiralty Inlet to the Keystone terminal on Whidbey Island. The ferry, operated by Washington State Ferries, takes approximately 30 minutes between terminals and runs year-round. From the Keystone ferry terminal, located adjacent to Fort Casey State Park, the highway travels east between the shore of Admiralty Bay and Crockett Lake, while making a short diversion to the north. SR 20 turns northwest at an intersection with SR 525, which terminates and is supplanted by SR 20\\\\. The highway, designated as part of the Cascade Loop and Whidbey Scenic Isle Way state scenic byways, passes the Naval Outlying Landing Field Coupeville and Rhododendron County Park before taking a turn west towards Coupeville and Ebey's Landing National Historical Reserve. SR 20 passes to the south of downtown Coupeville, with eastbound lanes traveling westward and vice versa, and wraps around the western shore of Penn Cove in a long 180-degree turn that passes Fort Ebey State Park. The highway continues northeast into Oak Harbor, where it travels around the downtown area and heads towards Naval Air Station Whidbey Island. SR 20 makes a wide turn around the base's runway and enters Deception Pass State Park. The highway leaves Whidbey Island on the Deception Pass Bridge, crossing over Deception Pass, Pass Island, and Canoe Pass on its way to Fidalgo Island. SR 20 continues northeast, passing between Lake Campbell and Similk Bay, to Sharpes Corner, where it is joined by a spur route serving Anacortes. SR 20 turns east and supplants the spur route's divided highway, traveling across the Swinomish Reservation and crossing the Swinomish Channel to the Skagit Valley. The highway follows a branch of the BNSF Railway, serving the Shell and Marathon oil refineries on March's Point, along the south side of Padilla Bay. Near Skagit Regional Airport, it intersects SR 536, which connects to Mount Vernon, and veers northeast along a four-lane expressway. SR 20 enters the city of Burlington, where it intersects I-5 and transitions into a city street and turns north onto Burlington Boulevard. The street crosses the BNSF Railway and turns east onto Avon Avenue, crossing the BNSF mainline and joining the North Cascades Highway. SR 20 continues northeast out of Burlington along a branch of the BNSF Railway and the Skagit River into Sedro-Woolley, where it becomes concurrent with SR 9 while bypassing the city's downtown. The highway travels east along the Skagit River, climbing uphill into the Cascade Mountains and passing the towns of Lyman and Concrete, located below Lake Shannon and Baker Lake. At Rockport, SR 20 intersects the eastern terminus of SR 530, which continues towards Darrington and Arlington. After passing Marblemount, the highway enters North Cascades National Park and Whatcom County. It heads further northeast through Newhalem, a preserved company town for Seattle City Light, and the narrow Diablo Canyon to the Diablo Dam and Diablo Lake, a reservoir that is colored turquoise blue. The roadway makes a long hairpin turn around the southern arm of the lake, crossing it at a narrow point and passing a scenic viewpoint, and continues northeast to Ross Lake. From Ross Lake, SR 20 follows Ruby Creek and Canyon Creek, heading southeast out of the national park and back into Skagit County. The highway crosses Rainy Pass and briefly joins the Pacific Crest Trail as it travels around Whistler Mountain, climbing up into Chelan County. SR 20 turns north and crosses Washington Pass into Okanogan County, making a hairpin turn and beginning its descent into Eastern Washington. SR 20 travels northeast along Early Winters Creek and the base of Delancy Ridge towards Mazama, where it meets the Methow River. The highway continues southeast along the north side of the river to Winthrop, an old-west-themed town where SR 20 forms the main street between two river crossings. SR 20 heads south through Twisp to a junction with SR 153, where it leaves the Methow River and turns northeast up Frazer Creek towards Loup Loup Pass and the Loup Loup Ski Bowl. The highway descends into the Okanogan Valley near Malott and continues northeast along the Okanogan River to the city of Okanogan. SR 20 takes a turn south over the Okanogan River to join US 97 and bypass the city, while the highway is superseded by SR 215\\\\. The concurrent SR 20 and US 97 continue along the east side of the river through the Colville Indian Reservation, intersecting SR 155 in eastern Omak and SR 215 to the north of the another river crossing. The highway travels north through the farming community of Riverside to Tonasket, where SR 20 leaves US 97 and takes a turn east towards the Okanogan Highlands. It climbs Bonaparte Creek and crosses Wauconda Pass, near Mount Bonaparte and the ghost town of Wauconda, before beginning its descent into Republic. SR 20 enters Republic on 6th Street and turns south onto Clark Avenue, the town's main street, before coming to a junction with SR 21\\\\. The highway turns northeast onto the Sherman Pass Scenic Byway, carrying the concurrent SR 20 and SR 21, and follows the Sanpoil River. SR 21 leaves the byway at Sanpoil Lake, while SR 20 travels into the Kettle River Range along O'Brien Creek. The highway dips south into the Colville National Forest and climbs the ridge, crossing Sherman Pass in a series of hairpin turns. The pass, located above sea level, is the highest in the state. SR 20 descends along Sherman Creek towards Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake on the Columbia River, which it crosses on a highway concurrent with US 395\\\\. The two routes travel east through Kettle Falls, intersecting SR 25, and follow the Colville River upstream to the city of Colville. At Colville, SR 20 turns east away from US 395 and continues into the southern reaches of the Selkirk Mountains. The highway forms the northern boundary of the Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge and follows the Little Pend Oreille River north through a series of glacial lakes. After entering Pend Oreille County, SR 20 makes a series of hairpin turns to descend into the Pend Oreille Valley. At an intersection with SR 31 in Tiger, the highway turns south to follow the Pend Oreille River, becoming part of the International Selkirk Loop and Pend Oreille Scenic Byway in the process. SR 20 continues south along the river, joined by the Pend Oreille Valley Railroad, and intersects SR 211 at Usk. Approximately southeast of Usk, the highway terminates at US 2, just west of the Washington–Idaho state line. =Names and designations= Portions of SR 20 are known as the North Cascades Highway (originally the North Cross State Highway), which is a designated Washington State Scenic Byway and a National Forest Scenic Byway. The Sherman Pass Scenic Byway begins at Republic, and extends east across the mountainous Kettle River Range, Colville National Forest, and the Columbia River through Kettle Falls to Sherman Pass. The highway also forms most of the Washington segment of U.S. Bicycle Route 10, which travels between Anacortes and the Montana state border. =Annual closure= Q-Q plot for first opening/final closing dates SR 20 is one of only four State Routes in Washington that have portions closed in the winter (the others being SR 410, SR 123, and SR 504). Washington Pass (elev. ) and nearby Rainy Pass (elev. ) annually receive up to of snow throughout the winter, and are prone to avalanches leaving over of snow on the road. , the median first open date was April 21. The median final closure date was November 26. During the drought of the winter of 1976/77, the highway was not closed. History What is known today as the North Cascades Highway was originally the corridor used by local Native American tribes as a trading route from Washington's Eastern Plateau country to the Pacific Coast for more than 8,000 years. After the California Gold Rush of 1849, white settlers started to arrive in the North Cascades looking for gold as well as fur-bearing animals. This far north, the settlers needed a clear route through some of the most rugged terrain in Washington Territory. Kangaroo Ridge is due east of Washington Pass It wasn't until 1895, however, that funding to explore a possible route through the Cascade Range was appropriated. After one year of surveying possible routes in the Upper Skagit River region, the State Road Commission concluded in 1896 that the Skagit gorge was not a practical route. Instead, the commission settled upon the Cascade Pass route, several miles south of the Skagit gorge. The Cascade Pass route began to be roughed out in 1897 and shortly afterward, state highway maps showed the road as either State Highway 1 or the Cascade Wagon Road. In the following years, floods on the Cascade River took out most of the work completed on the road and led Washington's first State Highway Commissioner to report in 1905 that almost all the money appropriated for the road had been wasted. After these unsuccessful attempts to build a northern cross-mountain highway, the state designated that a highway be built along the Methow River from Pateros to Hart's Pass, high above Eastern Washington's Methow Valley. This road was completed in 1909. By 1936, both of Seattle City Light projects, Gorge Dam and Diablo Dam had been completed and were attracting visitors and families to the area. In 1940, the first stage of the completion of Ross Dam was reached. Because this influx of population and interest in the area once again demonstrated the need for a northern route over the high Cascades, highway promoters began to try and persuade other boosters to finally abandon the idea of the ill-fated Cascade Pass route and instead look to agreeing on a route across Rainy and Washington Pass. In 1953, the North Cascades Highway Association was formed with politicians, lobbyists, and business owners from both sides of the North Cascades taking part. As these boosters pushed Olympia harder to move forward on the highway plan, more and more requests for huge sales of old-growth timber from along the highway corridor came in. These increasing timber requests were used to support the need for a highway. Finally, in 1958, the State of Washington appropriated funds to build a highway from the Seattle City Light company town of Diablo to Thunder Arm, a southern arm of Diablo Lake. Funds were also allotted to improve access roads on both sides of the North Cascades and construction on this section of the highway began in 1959. The corridor was designated as Primary State Highway 16 (PSH 16) in 1962, replacing several earlier designations that were shared with other highways. Over the next nine years, construction of the road would continue along with the signing of the North Cascades National Park bill by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968. With this bill, the hope of using the highway as access for high-dollar timber sales was quashed. Nonetheless, businessmen and residents on both sides of the North Cascades were hopeful and supportive of the tourist dollars that would be seen with the opening of the \\"North-Cross Highway\\".North Cascades Highway approaching Silver Star Mountain Moreover, the Methow Valley town of Winthrop, Washington was in the process of transforming itself from a sleepy cow-town into a tourist town with a western-style theme, complete with false-front buildings and boardwalk sidewalks. Finally, in mid-1972, the more- than-a-century-old idea of connecting western Washington with eastern Washington by a northern highway route had come to fruition. Amidst fanfare, music provided by the Concrete High School Band, and ribbon cutting, Highway 20 was officially connected from western to eastern Washington via Washington Pass on September 2, 1972. Then-governor Daniel J. Evans, a host of state dignitaries, and then-President Richard M. Nixon's brother Donald were in attendance for the opening and vehicle procession over the Cascade Mountains. The highway's construction came with conservation measures and upgrades to camping facilities in the then-new North Cascades National Park to handle the expected traffic. =Associated routes= From 1964 until 1973, SR 20 was designated as SR 113 from Discovery Bay to Coupeville. The route had historically been the Port Townsend branch of (PSH 9 PT) and a branch of (SSH 1D) in 1937, during the creation of the Primary and secondary highways. In 1964, these two highways became SR 113, as part of a new numbering system created by the Washington State Legislature and the Washington State Department of Transportation. When SR 20 was extended west from Fredonia in 1973, SR 113 was decommissioned. The Port Townsend–Keystone ferry wasn't technically part of SR 20 until 1994 when all of the Washington State Ferries routes were added to the state highway system. SR 20; and SR 20 Spur were the western segments of from 1964 until 1973. This map also details the former numbering of SR 20 south of Sharpes Corner toward Deception Pass and Whidbey Island From Coupeville to Sharpes Corner (just outside Anacortes), the modern SR 20 was designated SR 525, and prior to 1964 as SSH 1D. When the North Cascades Highway was completed, and the SR 20 designation extended Westward, the SR 525 designation was supplanted to Coupeville. From Mt. Vernon to the Anacortes Ferry Terminal, the modern SR 20 (and SR 20 Spur, west of Sharpes Corner) was designated SR 536, and prior to 1964 as the Anacortes Branch of PSH 1. When the North Cascades Highway was completed, and the SR 20 designation extended Westward, the SR 536 designation was supplanted, and the SR 20 Spur designation created to keep the route to the ferry terminal within the highway system. From 1964 to 1973, the route from Colville to Tiger was designated as SR 294, and the route from Tiger to Newport as SR 31. Major intersectionsSpur and business routesSR 20 Spur= The western land terminus of SR 20 Spur is the Anacortes Ferry Terminal State Route 20 Spur (SR 20 Spur, also State Route 20 North and the Paul Luvera Sr. Memorial Highway) is a spur route of State Route 20 in the U.S. state of Washington. The highway travels north from SR 20 to the Anacortes Ferry Terminal, entirely within the city of Anacortes in Skagit County, except the ferry portion, which travels within San Juan County. The roadway was established in 1937 as the western segment of the Anacortes branch of , which became in 1964 and renumbered to SR 20 Spur and SR 20 in 1973. In 1994, SR 20 was extended along the San Juan Islands ferry, which serves Lopez Island, Shaw Island, Orcas Island and San Juan Island. Map of SR 20 Spur State Route 20 Spur (SR 20 Spur) begins at an intersection with State Route 20 southeast of downtown Anacortes at the southern end of Fidalgo Bay at the Sharpes Corner Roundabout. From the terminus, the roadway travels northwest and later west near the bay. The route turns northward at a round about, one block west of R Ave, to become Commercial Avenue heading toward downtown Anacortes. The street travels through downtown Anacortes before turning west to become 12th Street and later goes southwest along the waterfront as Oakes Avenue to an intersection with Sunset Avenue after passing Anacortes Airport. At Sunset Avenue, SR 20 Spur becomes Ferry Terminal Road and curves north to the Anacortes Ferry Terminal in Ship Harbor. The roadway after the intersection with SR 20 had a daily average of 23,000 motorists in 2007. SR 20 Spur was established in 1937 as the Anacortes branch of (PSH 1 AN), which ran from the Anacortes ferry terminal to PSH 1 in Mount Vernon, using the current highway along with State Highway 20 and . The route intersected (SSH 1D, now SR 20) in Anacortes, (former ) in Fredonia and a SSH 1C branch (became , now SR 20). PSH 1 AN was later renumbered during the 1964 highway renumbering to SR 536, SSH 1D became SR 525 and PSH 16 became SR 20. When SR 20 was extended west to Discovery Bay from Fredonia in 1974, SR 536 was shortened and SR 20 Spur was created. The roadway ended at the Anacortes ferry terminal until 1994, when the route was routed onto the San Juan Islands ferry operated by Washington State Ferries. =SR 20 Business= SR 20 Business was a bannered route through Okanagan and Omak that followed the former route of SR 20 and US 97, while SR 20 bypasses the cities along with US 97 along the East Bank of the Okanogan River. This route has been replaced with SR 215.

The term true conchs, being a common name, does not have an exact meaning. It may refer generally to any of the Strombidae but sometimes is used more specifically to include only Strombus and Lambis.Goodenough, W. H. & Sugita, H. (1980). \\"Trukese-English dictionary\\". Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society. p. 235] The family currently includes 23 extant, and 10 extinct genera. Distribution A live scorpion conch (Lambis scorpius) in Mayotte. One can see the eyes as well as the scythe-shaped operculum. Live Conomurex decorus in La Réunion. Live Lentigo lentiginosus in La Réunion. Strombid gastropods live mainly in tropical and subtropical waters. These animals are widespread in the Indo-West Pacific, where most species and genera occur. Nearly 40 of the living species that used to belong to the genus Strombus can be found in the Indo-Pacific region.Abbott, R.T. (1960). \\"The genus Strombus in the Indo- Pacific\\". Indo-Pacific Mollusca 1(2): 33-144 They also occur in the eastern Pacific and Western Atlantic, and a single species can be found on the African Atlantic coast. Six species of strombids are found in the wider Caribbean region, including the queen conch Aliger gigas, the goliath conch Lobatus goliath, the hawk-wing conch Lobatus raninus, the rooster tail conch Aliger gallus, the milk conch Lobatus costatus, the West Indian fighting conch Strombus pugilis, and the Florida fighting conch Strombus alatus. Until recently, all of these species were placed in the genus Strombus, but now many species are being moved into new genera. Morphology and life habits Strombids have long eye stalks. The shell of a strombid has a long and narrow aperture and a siphonal canal. The shell margin has an indentation near the anterior end which accommodates one of the eye stalks. This indentation is called a strombid or stromboid notch. The stromboid notch may be more or less conspicuous, depending on the species. The shells of most species in this family grow a flared lip upon reaching sexual maturity, and they lay eggs in long, gelatinous strands. The genera Strombus and Lambis have many similarities between them, both anatomical and reproductive, though their shells show some conspicuous differences. Strombids were widely accepted as carnivores by several authors in the 19th century, an erroneous concept that persisted for several decades into the first half of the 20th century. This ideology was probably born in the writings of Lamarck, who classified strombids alongside other supposedly carnivorous snails, and was copied in this by subsequent authors. However, the many claims of those authors were never supported by the observation of animals feeding in their natural habitat. Nowadays, strombids are known to be specialized herbivores and occasional detritivores. They are usually associated with shallow-water reefs and seagrass meadows. Behavior Unlike most snails, which glide slowly across the substrate on their feet, strombid gastropods have a characteristic means of locomotion, using their pointed, sickle-shaped, horny operculum to propel themselves forward in a so-called leaping motion.Parker, G. H. (1922). \\"The leaping of the stromb (Strombus gigas Linn.)\\". Journal of Experimental Zoology 36: 205-209. Burrowing behavior, in which an individual sinks itself entirely or partially into the substrate, is also frequent among strombid gastropods. The burrowing process itself, which involves distinct sequential movements and sometimes complex behaviors, is very characteristic of each species. Usually, large strombid gastropods, such as the queen conch Eustrombus gigas and the spider conch Lambis lambis, do not bury themselves, except during their juvenile stages. However, smaller species such as Strombus canarium and Strombus epidromis may bury themselves even after adulthood. Taxonomy For a long time, all conchs and their allies (the strombids) were classified in only two genera, namely Strombus and Lambis. This classification can still be found in many textbooks and on websites on the internet. Based on molecular phylogeny in addition to an extensively documented fossil record, both genera have been subdivided into several new genera by different authors. =Genera= The family Strombidae actually comprises 23 extant genera and 10 extinct genera (marked with a dagger †). ;Extant genera File:Canarium mutabile forma zebriolatus 01.JPGCanarium mutabile File:Conomurex decorus 01.jpgConomurex decorus File:Dolomena variabilis 01.JPGDolomena variabilis File:Doxander vittatus entropi 01.JPGDoxander vittatus File:Euprotomus aurisdianae 01.JPGEuprotomus aurisdianae File:Lobatus gigas 01.jpgEustrombus gigas File:Gibberulus gibbosus 01.JPGGibberulus gibbosus File:Harpago chiragra 01.JPGHarpago chiragra File:Laevistrombus canarium canarium 01.JPGLaevistrombus canarium File:Lambis scorpius indomaris 01.JPGLambis scorpius File:Lentigo lentiginosus 01.JPGLentigo lentiginosus File:Lobatus gallus 01.JPGLobatus gallus File:Margistrombus marginatus marginatus 01.JPGMargistrombus marginatus File:Mirabilistrombus listeri 01.JPGMirabilistrombus listeri File:Sinustrombus sinuatus, Bohol, Philippines.jpgSinustrombus sinuatus File:Strombus pugilis 01.JPGStrombus pugilis File:Terestrombus terebellatus 01.JPGTerestrombus terebellatus File:WLA hmns Strombus thersites.jpgThersistrombus thersites File:Strombus dentatus Linné, 1758 (3373474340).jpgTridentarius dentatus ;Extinct genera ;Genera brought into synonymy * Afristrombus Bandel, 2007 is a synonym of Persististrombus Kronenberg & Lee, 2007 * Aliger Thiele, 1929 is a synonym of Lobatus Swainson, 1837 * Decostrombus Bandel, 2007 is a synonym of Conomurex Bayle in P.

In a 2005 monograph, Simone proposed a cladogram (a tree of descent) based on an extensive morphoanatomical analysis of representatives of the Aporrhaidae, Strombidae, Xenophoridae, and Struthiolariidae. In his analysis, Simone recognized the Strombidae as a monophyletic taxon supported by 13 synapomorphies (traits that are shared by two or more taxa and their most recent common ancestor), comprising at least eight distinct genera. He considered the genus Terebellum as the most basal taxon, distinguished from the remaining strombids by 13 synapomorphies, including a rounded foot. Though the genus Tibia was left out of the analysis, Simone regarded it as probably closely related to Terebellum, apparently due to some well known morphological similarities between them. With the exception of Lambis, the remaining taxa were previously allocated within the genus Strombus. However, according to Simone, only Strombus gracilior, Strombus alatus, and Strombus pugilis, the type species, remained within Strombus, as they constituted a distinct group based on at least five synapomorphies. The remaining taxa were previously considered as subgenera, and were elevated to genus level by Simone in the end of his analysis. The genus Eustrombus (now considered a synonym of Lobatus), in this case, included Eustrombus gigas (now considered a synonym of Lobatus gigas) and Eustrombus goliath (= Lobatus goliath); similarly, the genus Aliger included Aliger costatus (= Lobatus costatus) and Aliger gallus (= Lobatus gallus). A different approach, this time based on sequences of nuclear histone H3 and mitochondrial cytochrome-c oxidase I (COI) genes was proposed by Latiolais and colleagues in a 2006 paper. The analysis included 32 strombid species that used to, or still belong in the genera Strombus and Lambis.Latiolais J. M., Taylor M. S., Roy K. & Hellberg M. E. (2006). \\"A molecular phylogenetic analysis of strombid gastropod morphological diversity\\". Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 41: 436-444. . PDF. Human use Several species belonging to numerous genera among the Strombidae are considered economically important. Used as food, fishing bait, tools or simply as decoration, some strombid snail species have been used in human culture for centuries.

Strong (customer) authentication definitions  Strong authentication is often confused with two-factor authentication or more generally multi-factor authentication. However, strong authentication is not necessarily multi-factor authentication. Soliciting multiple answers to challenge questions may be considered strong authentication but, unless the process also retrieves 'something you have' or 'something you are', it would not be considered multi- factor authentication. The FFIEC issued supplemental guidance on this subject in August 2006, in which they clarified, \\"By definition true multifactor authentication requires the use of solutions from two or more of the three categories of factors. Using multiple solutions from the same category ... would not constitute multifactor authentication.\\" Another commonly found class of definitions relates to a cryptographic process, or more precisely authentication based on a challenge response protocol. This type of definition is found in the Handbook of applied cryptography. This type of definition does not necessarily relate to two-factor authentication, since the secret key used in a challenge-response authentication scheme can be simply derived from a password (one factor). A third class of definitions says that strong authentication is any form of authentication in which the verification is accomplished without the transmission of a password. This is the case for example with the definition found in the Fermilab documentation.http://www.fnal.gov/docs/strongauth/ The fourth class, which has legal standing within the European Economic Area, is Strong Customer Authentication. The Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) Alliance has been striving to establish technical specifications for strong authentication and has 250 members and over 150 certified products.

It was based on the 1964 novel Marooned by Martin Caidin. While the original novel was based on the single-pilot Project Mercury, the film depicted an Apollo command and service module with three astronauts and a space station resembling Skylab. Caidin acted as technical adviser and updated the novel, incorporating appropriate material from the original version. The film was released less than four months after the Apollo 11 Moon landing, attracting enormous public attention. It won an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects for Robie Robinson.  Plot  Three U.S. astronauts — commander Jim Pruett (Richard Crenna), \\"Buzz\\" Lloyd (Gene Hackman), and Clayton \\"Stoney\\" Stone (James Franciscus) — are the first crew of an experimental space station on an extended duration mission. While returning to Earth, the main engine on the Apollo spacecraft Ironman One fails. Mission Control determines that Ironman does not have enough fuel remaining to use the reaction control system as a backup to initiate atmospheric entry. Nor is there sufficient fuel to re- dock with the station and wait for rescue. The crew is effectively marooned in orbit. NASA debates whether a rescue flight can reach the crew before their oxygen runs out in approximately two days. There are no backup launch vehicles or rescue systems available at Kennedy Space Center in Florida and NASA Administrator Charles Keith (Peck) opposes using an experimental U.S. Air Force lifting body, the X-RV, that would be launched on an Air Force Titan IIIC booster rocket; neither the spacecraft nor the booster is man-rated, and there is insufficient time to put a new crewed NASA mission together. Even though a Titan IIIC is already on the way to nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station for an already-scheduled Air Force launch, many hundreds of hours of preparation, assembly, and testing would be necessary. Ted Dougherty (David Janssen), NASA's Chief Astronaut, opposes Keith and demands that something be done. The President agrees with Dougherty and tells Keith that failing to try a rescue mission will kill public support for the crewed space program. The President tells Keith that money is no factor; \\"whatever you need, you've got it\\". While the astronauts' wives (Lee Grant, Mariette Hartley and Nancy Kovack) agonize over the fates of their husbands, all normal checklist procedures are bypassed to prepare the X-RV for launch. A hurricane headed for the launch area threatens to cancel the mission. High winds cause a scrub of the launch in time to save all three Ironman astronauts. However, the eye of the storm passes over the Cape 90 minutes later during a subsequent launch window, permitting a launch with Dougherty aboard in time to reach the ship while at least some of the crew survives. Insufficient oxygen remains for all three astronauts to survive until Dougherty arrives. There is possibly enough for two. Pruett and his crew then debate what to do. Stone tries to reason that they can somehow survive by taking sleeping pills or otherwise reducing oxygen consumption. Lloyd offers to leave since he is \\"using up most of the oxygen anyway\\", but Pruett overrules him. He orders everyone into their spacesuits then leaves the ship, ostensibly to attempt repairs, although this option has been repeatedly dismissed as impractical. When Lloyd sees Pruett going out the hatch, he attempts to follow, even though he is tethered to the ship. Stone restrains Lloyd, and they both watch Pruett. There is a hiss of air as Pruett's space suit tears on a metal protrusion. He dies from anoxia, Lloyd and Stone look on as Pruett's body drifts away into space. With Pruett gone, Stone takes command. A Soviet spacecraft suddenly appears and its cosmonaut tries to make contact. It can do nothing but deliver oxygen, since the Soviet ship is too small to carry additional passengers. Stone and Lloyd, suffering oxygen deprivation, cannot understand the cosmonaut's gestures or obey Keith's orders. Dougherty arrives and he and the cosmonaut transfer the two surviving and mentally dazed Ironman astronauts into the rescue ship. Both the Soviet ship and the X-RV return to Earth, and the final scene fades out with a view of the abandoned Ironman One adrift in orbit.

Production  An earlier version of the film (based on the 1964 version of the novel) was in pre-production in 1965, with Frank Capra producing and directing, from a screenplay by Walter Newman; Capra heavily revised the script while seeking funding from investors, in order to reduce the budget. Amid concerns about the size of the project, Columbia Pictures' M. J. Frankovich offered Capra $3 million to make the film, prompting him to abandon development. When Marooned was eventually produced with John Sturges as director and Mayo Simon as screenwriter, the budget was $8 million. Given that Apollo missions were being watched regularly by television audiences, it was very important to the producers that the look of the film be as authentic as possible. NASA, and its primary contractors such as North American Aviation and Philco-Ford, helped with the design of the film's hardware, including the crew's chairs inside the capsule, the orbiting laboratory — which used an early mock-up of the Skylab concept — the service module,Mateas, Lisa. \\"Marooned (1969)\\" (article) Turner Classic Movies the actual Plantronics headsets worn by the actors in the spacecraft, as well as authentic replicas of actual facilities, such as the Mission Operations Control Room (MOCR) at Johnson Space Center in Houston and the Air Force Launch Control Center (AFLCC) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.

The Apollo Command Module used in making the film was an actual \\"boilerplate\\" version of the \\"Block I\\" Apollo spacecraft; no Block I ever flew with a crew aboard, mainly due to the Apollo 1 fire exposing over a thousand defects. While the Block II series had a means of rapidly opening the hatch, the Block I did not (a major factor in the Apollo 1 fire), and the interior set was constructed using the boilerplate as a model. To blow the hatch in the movie, Buzz pulls on a handle attached to a hinge. Astronaut Jim Lovell and his wife Marilyn Lovell referred to the film years later in a special interview. Their recollection is shared as a feature on the DVD release of Apollo 13, a 1995 film directed by Ron Howard. The couple describes a 1969 film — never specifically named — in which an astronaut in an Apollo spacecraft \\"named Jim\\" faces mortal peril. The couple says the film gave Lovell's wife nightmares. Her experience inspired a dream sequence in Apollo 13. There were some discrepancies between real-life procedures and what is shown in the film. For instance, several scenes show various people communicating directly with the astronauts in space. In actuality, only CAPCOM (an astronaut) and astronauts' wives would have been permitted to communicate with the spacecraft, all others in MOCR and AFLCC would only be able to communicate on the internal network or to their respective backroom teams. Conspicuously absent from the film is any person resembling a flight director. In real life, \\"Flight\\" is in charge of a space mission during that director's shift. The filmmakers felt that adding a flight director would distract from the interpersonal dynamic between Keith and Dougherty. Release Marooned had its premiere on November 10, 1969 in Washington, D.C. during the National Association of Theater Owners convention. The film opened at the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles on December 11, 1969. Its New York premiere on December 17, 1969 at the new Ziegfeld Theatre was the first film shown at the new theatre. Reception The film grossed $43,500 in its first week at the Egyptian.

It is the ratio of the percentage change of one of the variables between the two points to the percentage change of the other variable. It contrasts with the point elasticity, which is the limit of the arc elasticity as the distance between the two points approaches zero and which hence is defined at a single point rather than for a pair of points. Like the point elasticity, the arc elasticity can vary in value depending on the starting point. For example, the arc elasticity of supply of a product with respect to the product's price could be large when the starting and ending prices are both low, but could be small when they are both high. Formula The y arc elasticity of x is defined as: :E_{x,y} = \\\\frac{\\\\% \\\\mbox{ change in } x}{\\\\% \\\\mbox{ change in } y} where the percentage change in going from point 1 to point 2 is usually calculated relative to the midpoint: :\\\\% \\\\mbox{ change in } x = \\\\frac{x_2 - x_1}{(x_2 + x_1)/2}; :\\\\% \\\\mbox{ change in } y = \\\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{(y_2 + y_1)/2}. The use of the midpoint arc elasticity formula (with the midpoint used for the base of the change, rather than the initial point (x1, y1) which is used in almost all other contexts for calculating percentages) was advocated by R. G. D. Allen for use when x refers to the quantity of a good demanded or supplied and y refers to its price, due to the following properties: (1) it is symmetric with respect to the two prices and quantities, (2) it is independent of the units of measurement, and (3) it yields a value of unity if the total revenues (price times quantity) at the two points are equal. The arc elasticity is used when there is not a general function for the relationship of two variables, but two points on the relationship are known. In contrast, calculation of the point elasticity requires detailed knowledge of the functional relationship and can be calculated wherever the function is defined. For comparison, the y point elasticity of x is given by :E_{x,y} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial y} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{y}{x} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\ln x}{\\\\partial \\\\ln y} Application in economics The arc elasticity of quantity demanded (or quantity supplied) Q with respect to price P, also known as the arc price elasticity of demand (or supply), is calculated as :(\\\\% \\\\mbox{ change in }Q)/(\\\\%\\\\mbox{ change in }P) =Example= Suppose that two points on a demand curve, (Q_1, P_1) and (Q_2, P_2), are known. (Nothing else might be known about the demand curve.) Then the arc elasticity is obtained using the formula :E_p =\\\\frac{\\\\frac{Q_2-Q_1}{(Q_1+Q_2)/2}}{\\\\frac{P_2-P_1}{(P_1+P_2)/2}}. Suppose the quantity of hot dogs demanded at halftime of football games is measured at two different games at which two different prices are charged: at one measurement the quantity demanded is 80 units, and at the other measurement it is 120 units. The percent change, measured against the average, would be (120-80)/((120+80)/2))=40%. If the measurements were taken in reverse sequence (first 120 and then 80), the absolute value of the percentage change would be the same. In contrast, if the percentage change in quantity demanded were measured against the initial value, the calculated percentage change would be (120-80)/80= 50%. The percent change for the reverse sequence of observations, 120 units to 80 units, would be (80-120)/120 = -33.3%. The midpoint formula has the benefit that a percentage change from A to B is measured in absolute value as the same as one from B to A. Suppose that the change in the price of hot dogs, which led to this change in quantity demanded from 80 to 120, was from $3 to $1. The percent change in price measured against the midpoint would be (1-3)/2 = -100%, so the price elasticity of demand is 40%/(-100%) or -0.4. It is common to refer to the absolute value of the price elasticity as simply price elasticity, since for a normal (decreasing) demand curve the elasticity is always negative and so the \\"minus\\" part can be made implicit. Thus the arc price elasticity demand of the football fans is 0.4.

Bass pedals are an electronic musical instrument with a foot-operated pedal keyboard with a range of one or more octaves. The earliest bass pedals from the 1970s consisted of a pedalboard and analog synthesizer tone generation circuitry packaged together as a unit. The bass pedals are plugged into a bass amplifier or PA system so that their sound can be heard. Since the 1990s, bass pedals are usually MIDI controllers, which have to be connected to a MIDI-compatible computer, electronic synthesizer keyboard, or synth module to produce musical tones. Some 2010s-era bass pedals have both an onboard synth module and a MIDI output. Bass pedals serve the same function as the pedalboard on a pipe organ or an electric organ, and usually produce sounds in the bass range, which, in organ terminology is the 16′ stop. Some bass pedals have an 8′ stop (an octave higher) which can be used by itself or combined with the 16' stop. Bass pedals are used by keyboard players as an adjunct to their full-range manual keyboards (the keyboards played with the hands), by performers of other instruments (e.g., electric bass or electric guitar), or by themselves. Bass pedal units usually have a smaller range (13 notes) than a church pipe organ's pedal keyboard (32 notes for an American Guild of Organists standard pedalboard). Bass pedals with larger ranges are less common, but do exist, such as 17 notes (C to E), 20 notes (C to G), and 25 notes (C to C two octaves higher). As well, bass pedals usually have shorter pedals than those on a church pipe organ's pedalboard. Elements All bass pedal units consist of foot-operated pedals mounted in a chassis that sits on the floor. The chassis has buttons on top, also designed to be operated with the feet, which enable the performer to change the sound. Typical buttons include a 16' and 8' button to give a contrabass or bass sound. Some models may have a sustain button; despite the name, it is used differently from an electronic piano's sustain pedal. Whereas an electronic piano's sustain pedal is a momentary, non- latching switch depressed to provide sustain, and then released to end the sustained note, a bass pedal unit's electronic sustain is a latching switch, which, when clicked on automatically sustains all notes for a fixed, short period after the pedal is released. The benefit of the bass pedal's sustain button is that it facilitates legato, sostenuto basslines in slow ballads. Some units with sustain also had a rolling dial to enable the setting of the automatic sustain length. A 1970s-era bass pedal is typically monophonic, which meant that it could only play one note at a time. Even if the player presses two pedals simultaneously, such as a C and a G, only one note sounds. Given that bass pedals are typically used to play deep-pitched basslines, some models had a \\"low note priority\\" circuit. With this circuit, if the player pressed two or more pedals, the unit would only sound the lowest pitched note. A 1970s unit might have a choice of several imitated instruments, such as organ bass, string bass (with more decay), or tuba. Some units had a rolling dial, once again foot-operated, to control the volume. A 1970s unit might have a single output: a 1/4 jack. A unit from this era might have only one visual indicator: a power on LED. Since the bass pedals are on the ground, there is a risk that the player might accidentally press on one of the buttons and change the sound. The reduce this risk, some bass pedals have plastic covers over some of the buttons or \\"U\\"-shaped \\"switch guard\\" protectors near some buttons. Some 1990s and later bass pedals gave the player the option of selecting a monophonic or polyphonic setting. The polyphonic setting could sound more than one pitch at a time. Even though contrabass instruments are less likely to be used to play chords (three or more notes sounded together) than their higher- pitched cousins (as deep-pitched chords can sound unclear and \\"muddy\\"), a contrabass instrument like a bass pedal unit can still effectively play some dyads (two-notes sounded together), such as perfect fifths, perfect fourths, and octaves. On a bass pedal unit with a wider range, such as a 20-note unit, a minor tenth or major tenth might sound pleasing, especially at an 8' register. A 1990s or later unit might have a 1/4 jack output and one or more 5-pin MIDI jacks (e.g., MIDI out or thru). Some 1990s or later units have alphanumeric LED displays and/or small LEDs to provide information to the player about the settings. =Organ bass pedals= A few of the bass pedals designed to be used with electronic or clonewheel organs have features that operate the upper manual keyboards, such as an expression pedal or swell pedal, which is a treadle-style potentiometer for controlling the volume; buttons to turn on or change the speed of a Leslie speaker, a rotating horn speaker in a cabinet; or program change buttons, which send a MIDI message to the other upper keyboards to change to a new sound or setting. Some bass pedals designed to be used with electronic organs have a MIDI merge feature, so that one or more keyboards can have their MIDI outs plugged into the bass pedal, and then the bass pedal merges the MIDI messages and sends them, via the bass pedal's MIDI out, to the organ sound module. This function might be needed if a keyboardist had two MIDI controller keyboards, and the bass pedals, and wants the MIDI messages from all three controllers to be sent to the sound module. HistoryOrigins= This Sisme combo organ shows the more portable type of combo organs made in the 1970s. This organ has bass pedals in a separate chassis. Eventually, these types bass pedals were designed and sold as standalone units. Pedalboards have been a standard feature on pipe organs for centuries, and since the 1930s, electromechanical organs such as the Hammond organ often included pedalboards. In the 1960s, home spinet organs by Hammond, Farfisa, and other manufacturers included short, 13-note bass pedals attached to the base of the chassis. In the 1970s, electronic organ makers were aware that musicians wanted organs that could be taken to gigs at bars and festivals, so organs were made more portable. To make organs more portable, they were changed from being housed in heavy wooden consoles with an integrated amplifier and speaker and bass pedals (the home organ approach) to being made as a main keyboard, a detachable stand, and detachable bass pedals. The organist was expected to plug the organ into a Leslie speaker or other instrument amplifier and speaker. Even if the total weight of a split-apart organ was the same, portability was improved, because the individual components were lighter than an entire home console organ. Once organ companies were making portable organs, some manufacturers began building bass pedals that could function separately from the organ console. These afforded the player great portability, and flexibility in combining them with other instruments and electronic equipment. A 1970s-era musician with a standalone bass pedal could use it under an organ for one set, put it under an electric piano for a second set, then pull it out and use it while playing guitar for a third set. =1970s and 1980s= Moog Taurus (1976-1981) An early and popular bass pedal device was the Moog Taurus. Moog called this instrument a \\"Pedal Synthesizer\\" in their literature, and explicitly pointed out that its five-octave range made it \\"more than a bass instrument\\". . Despite these efforts, most players used them for basslines, and the term bass pedals stuck. The Taurus I and II models are no longer in production, but they are prized as vintage instruments. In 2010, Moog introduced a new model, the Taurus III, in a limited run of 1000 units. The Taurus III (2010-2012) offered more features, including fuzz bass. Several progressive rock and hard rock groups (such as Yes, Genesis, Van der Graaf Generator, Led Zeppelin and Rush) and alternative rock groups such as U2 and The Police used bass pedals. Often, the group's bass guitarist would play in a standing position, meaning that they could only use one foot at a time to play, rather than play sitting down with both feet, as organists traditionally had. However, John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin used bass pedals while sitting down at a keyboard. Bass guitarists frequently used Taurus pedals to hold down sustained, low-pitched pedal points while performing high-register melodic lines or percussive parts on the bass guitar. In 1983, Phil Collins' song \\"I Don't Care Anymore\\" featured Taurus pedals, unusually played by hand. Bassist Mo Foster appears in the music video as the man behind the machine. =1990s and 2000s=Jazz, rock, and popular music Since the 1990s, most electronic pedalboards have been MIDI controllers, which do not perform any tone generation themselves. These pedalboards have to be connected to a MIDI-compatible computer, electronic keyboard or rack-mounted synthesizer to produce musical tones. Despite the fact that these pedalboards can control any kind of MIDI device, and can therefore produce a virtually unlimited range of musical pitches (and other sounds), ranging from a high-pitched melody to percussion sounds, they are still often referred to as \\"bass pedals\\". Current manufacturers of these products, such as Hammond, Roland, Studiologic (formerly known as Fatar), R. W. Designs, mostly sell keyboards with 13-note keyboards (C to C, one octave), 17-note (C to F, an octave and a fourth) keyboards, or 25-note keyboards (C to C, two octaves). Pedalboards with less than a 32-note range are often used by jazz, rock, or popular music performers. Baroque and church music To perform the Baroque church music repertoire (e.g., J.S. Bach), a 30-note keyboard (C to F, two octaves and a fourth) is needed. A smaller number of manufacturers, such as Classic Organworks, sell a MIDI controller in full- sized 32-note AGO layout that can be used to perform virtually all the organ repertoire. In the art music and church music context, MIDI pedalboards and digitally sampled or synthesized pipe organ instruments are used either as practice instruments or as performance instruments. Some universities and churches use MIDI pedalboards and digital organs as practice instruments, to allow a larger number of students to have practice time. Some churches use MIDI pedalboards to trigger digitally sampled sounds for the low register of the pipe organ. This has led to some controversy, because this mixes digitally sampled, electronically amplified sounds with the wind-driven pipe sound of the rest of the pipe organ; some purists argue that this is inappropriate, or that the sound or tonal quality of the digital bass voices are unsuitable. Other uses While bass pedals are usually used to perform basslines, MIDI- equipped pedals can be used for a range of other purposes. The different pedals can be assigned to perform different chords, which allows a one man band-style performer to perform chords with a single foot-press. As well, MIDI pedals can be used with a keyboard workstation or an arranger keyboard to trigger different parts of sequenced song arrangements. For example, a performer could use the pedals to trigger the chorus, verse, and solo sections of a sequenced song. Another musical use of MIDI pedals would be to have each pedal linked to a different drum sound, such as a bass drum, snare, and cymbals; this would permit the performance of rudimentary drum kit parts. A MIDI-equipped pedalboard can also be used for non-musical purposes: *theatre lighting * stage lighting in a rock club *special effects *sound design *VJ- ing *recording system synchronization *audio processor control *computer networking, as demonstrated by the early first-person shooter game MIDI Maze, 1987 *animatronic figure control *animation parameter control, as demonstrated by Apple Motion v2 Such non-musical applications of the MIDI 1.0 protocol (sometimes over MIDI-DIN, sometimes using other transports) are possible because of its general-purpose nature. Any device built with a standard MIDI Out connector should in theory be able to control any other device with a MIDI In port, just as long as the developers of both devices have the same understanding about the semantic meaning of all the MIDI messages the sending device emits. This agreement can come either because both follow the official MIDI standard specifications, or else in the case of any non-standard functionality, because the message meanings are directly agreed upon by the two manufacturers.

He is the author of the insubmersibility theory, and developer of a Cyrillic-based semaphore alphabet. A proponent of icebreaker use, he supervised the first ever polar icebreaker construction, Makarov also designed several ships. The town of Shiritoru on Sakhalin island was renamed Makarov in 1946 in his honor. Early life Makarov's birthplace in Nikolaev Stepan Makarov was born in Nikolaev (present-day Mykolayiv, Ukraine) in a family of a fleet praporshchik (прапорщик по Адмиралтейству, an auxiliary officer). His family moved to Nikolayevsk na Amure on the Pacific coast of Russia in 1858, and Makarov attended school there. In 1863 he joined the Imperial Russian Navy, where he served as a cadet aboard a clipper of the Russian Pacific Fleet. In 1866 he took part in the voyage of the corvette from Vladivostok to Kronstadt via the Cape of Good Hope. Between 1867 and 1876 Makarov served with the Baltic Fleet as flag captain under Admiral Andrei Popov. He transferred to the Black Sea Fleet in 1876. In 1870 Makarov invented a design for a collision mat to seal holes in a ship's hull. The invention was displayed at the 1873 Vienna World's Fair, which Makarov attended. Russo-Turkish War Makarov was highly decorated for his service as a captain of the Russian torpedo boat tender in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78. He was one of the first to adopt the idea of using flotillas of torpedo boats and had combat experience as a torpedo boat commander. On 14 January 1878 he launched torpedoes from a boat (which itself was launched from a tender) sinking the Ottoman Navy vessel Intibakh at Batumi in the world's first successful attack using the self- propelled Whitehead torpedo.\\"The following January[1878], Makarov acquired automotive Whitehead torpedoes, and on the 14th of the same month he destroyed the Turkish despatch boat INTIBAKH by two of these torpedoes launched at a distance of 230 feet (70 m) by the torpedo launches CHESME and SINOPE, the first successful operational use of this weapon.\\" -p8. Norman Polmar and Jurrien Noot (1991). Submarines of the Russian and Soviet Navies, 1718-1990. Naval Institute Press. . From 1879–1880, he was part of the maritime contingent during the Russian conquest of Central Asia. He was promoted to captain, 1st rank, on 1 January 1881. Naval innovator The icebreaker Yermak Over the next two decades, Makarov specialized in naval research, publishing over fifty papers on oceanography and naval tactics.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 217. As captain of the corvette Vityaz, Makarov directed a round-the-world oceanographic expedition from 1886–89. When Makarov was promoted to rear admiral in 1890, he was the youngest person to reach such a position in the history of the Russian navy. From 1890–1894, Makarov was Chief Inspector of Naval Ordinance, during which time he invented the \\"Makarov cap\\", an armor-piercing projectile whose design was soon copied by all navies. From 1894–1895, Makarov was commander of the Mediterranean Squadron. From 1895–1896, Makarov was in charge of naval training. He became a vice admiral in 1896, and began to concentrate on the design for new warships, especially icebreakers needed to establish a northern sea route between Europe and East Asia. Makarov led an expedition to survey the mouths of the Ob and the Yenisei Rivers in 1897. As part of his research on icebreaking methods, Makarov visited the Great Lakes of North America in 1898 to study methods in use by railroad ferries in winter.Port Huron (MI) Daily Times, April 14, 1904. pg. 1 He proposed the world's first polar icebreaker, , oversaw her construction, and commanded her on her maiden voyage in 1899. In 1899, Makarov was also appointed commander and military governor of Kronstadt in January 1900. In 1901, Makarov commanded Yermak on an Arctic expedition to survey the coasts of Novaya Zemlya and Franz Josef Land. Lake Baikal icebreakers SS Baikal in service on Lake Baikal Makarov also designed two icebreaking steamships to connect the Trans-Siberian Railway across Lake Baikal: the train ferry built in 1897 and passenger and package freight steamer built in about 1900, based upon his study of similar vessels on the North American Great Lakes. Armstrong Whitworth in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England, built the ships in kit form and sent them to Listvyanka on Lake Baikal for reassembly. Their boilers, engines and some other components were built in Saint Petersburg. Baikal had 15 boilers, four funnels, was long and could carry 24 railway coaches and one locomotive on her middle deck. Angara is smaller, with two funnels. Baikal was burnt out and destroyed in the Russian Civil War. Angara survives, has been restored and is permanently moored at Irkutsk where she serves as offices and a museum. Russo-Japanese War After the Imperial Japanese Navy's surprise attack at Port Arthur on 9 February 1904, Admiral Makarov was sent to command the Imperial Russian Navy's battle fleet stationed there on 24 February, establishing the battleship as his flagship. His leadership differed greatly from any other Russian naval officer during this war, offering diversity, aggression, and an ability to \\"inspire confidence in his subordinates\\".Grant, p. 131 Upon his assumption of command in early 1904, Makarov greatly increased the activity in the Russian squadrons, as well as the general defense of Port Arthur.Grant, p. 93 Until then the Russian fleet had generally done nothingGrant, p. 121 but exist, as a fleet in being.Mahan, p. 456 Under Makarov's leadership, \\"Russian squadrons put to sea nearly every day, constantly on the move, and ensuring that it was never taken by surprise outside the protection of Port Arthur's\\" shore batteries.Grant, p. 120 Unlike his predecessors, Makarov sought engagements with the Japanese,Grant, p. 126 and kept his vessels in an order of battle in the roadstead of Port Arthur.Grant, p. 115 When Japanese cruisers bombarded Port Arthur from the Yellow Sea in March, his cruisers returned fire with such intensity that the Japanese ships were forced to withdraw. That same month the Japanese Navy tried to seal the port's entrance by sinking a number of old steamships as blockships in the harbor's channel. Russian cruisers assigned to protect the entrance pursued the escorting Japanese warships and quickly put them to flight.Grant, p. 116 Stepan Makarov monument in Kronstadt (2008) On 13 April 1904 the Russian destroyer Strasny returning from patrol, tried to re- enter the mouth of the Port Arthur but was intercepted by Japanese destroyers.Grant, p. 125 An engagement began between the opposing destroyers, and when observed by Makarov he immediately sent the cruiser to assist Strasny, while he led three battleships, four cruisers, and a group of destroyers into the Yellow Sea to seek battle with the surrounding enemy warships.Grant p. 126 The Japanese warships withdrew with Makarov in pursuit. With the arrival of enemy heavy units upon the scene, Makarov, now exceeding his gunfire support range from shore, turned about and headed back to Port Arthur; the Japanese fleet did not pursue. As Petropavlovsk moved closer to the harbour's entrance, she detonated a Japanese mine.Watts, p. 20 Secondary explosions followed quickly in succession and Petropavlovsk sank, taking Admiral Makarov with her.Grant, p. 127, 128Spector, p. 2 The admiral's remains and those of five of his officers were recovered from the wreck of Petropavlovsk by Japanese salvage teams, and in 1913, as a gesture of good will, the officers and crew of the Japanese cruiser presided over the funeral for the admiral in the military cemetery of Port Arthur. Monuments Stepan Makarov on a Soviet postage stamp There are monuments to Makarov in his native Mykolayiv, Ukraine, and in Vladivostok and Kronstadt, Russia. A number of ships have been named Admiral Makarov. An island in the Tsivolk group of the Nordenskiöld Archipelago was named after him. National University of Shipbuilding in Mykolaiv (Nikolayev) and State Maritime Academy in Saint Petersburg are named after him. Three icebreakers have been named after Makarov. The first was a steam-powered icebreaker built in 1941 as V. Molotov that was renamed Admiral Makarov in 1956. The second Admiral Makarov was built in 1975 and remains in service . The third one, Stepan Makarov, is an icebreaking standby vessel that was completed in 2016.

While most authorities now consider it a separate species, some (including the American Ornithologists' Union) continue to consider it conspecific with the black-billed streamertail. The red-billed streamertail is the national bird of Jamaica. When the black-billed streamertail of eastern Jamaica (found mostly in the parish of Portland) is considered a separate species, the red-billed streamertail occurs west of a line from Morant Bay following the Morant River, and via Ginger House and the middle Rio Grande to Port Antonio. These birds feed on nectar from flowers using a long extendable tongue or catch small insects on the wing. The next-to-outermost rectrices of the male are long, far longer than its bearer's body. Females lack the elongated rectrices, and are largely white below. Adult males in flight produce a distinctive whirring flight sound. The whirring is synchronised with the wingbeats and video footage shows primary feather eight (P8) bending with each downstroke, creating a gap that produces the fluttering sound. Bird sound other than via vocal organs is referred to as sonation. The bird is featured in Ian Fleming's James Bond short story For Your Eyes Only. The first line of the book reads, \\"The most beautiful bird in Jamaica, and some say the most beautiful bird in the world, is the streamer-tail or doctor humming-bird.\\" Description The adult male measures 4.5 inches (11.5 cm) without the 'streamers'. With the streamers, it measures 10 inches (25 cm). The crown and tail are black. The feathers at the nape of the neck form tufts. The body is a bright iridescent green. The bill is red with a black tip. The 'black-billed' streamertail is identical in every respect except for the colour of the bill, but is a slightly smaller bird. The female's crown, neck and back are pale green. The lores are pale brown, the wings dark brown, and the tail black with outer feathers tipped with white. The underparts are white. The bill has a dark brown upper mandible and pinkish-brown lower mandible.

W. E. Huntingford, \\"William A. Shack: The Gurage: a people of the ensete culture\\" The Gurage people traditionally inhabit a fertile, semi-mountainous region in southwest Ethiopia, about 125 kilometers southwest of Addis Ababa, bordering the Awash River in the north, the Gibe River, a tributary of the Omo River, to the southwest, and Lake Zway in the east. In addition, according to the 2007 Ethiopian national census the Gurage can also be found in large numbers in Addis Ababa, Oromia Region, Dire Dawa, Harari Region, Somali Region, Amhara Region, Gambela Region, Benishangul-Gumuz Region, and Tigray RegionTable 3.1 on 2007 Ethiopian Regional States Census Data It is believed the name Gurage is acquired from a place called Gura, Eritrea. This belief is based on the assumption that the southern Afroasiatic language speakers of the Gurage people originally came from the Northern Ethiopia. A southward Semitic migration during the medieval period is often used to explain origin of The Gurage. However, there is no written evidence for this explanation. One of the other commonly used explanation for origin of the Gurage, and other southern Afroasiatic languages including Harari, Argobba and the extinct Gafat, is military expeditions to the south towards the end of Kingdom of Axum. However, the military expedition explanation is unlikely as it would have been impossible for few soldiers to implant their language in the region for so long so effectively. Language The Gurage languages are a subgroup of the South Ethiopic languages within the Semitic family of the Afroasiatic language family. They have three subgroups: Northern, Eastern and Western. The exact number of Gurage languages is not known. Like other Ethiopian Semitic languages such as Amharic, the Gurage languages were heavily influenced by the surrounding non-Semitic Afroasiatic Cushitic languages. Studied Gurage languages include Soddo, Masqan, Inor, Mesmes (now extinct), Seven Houses, Chaha, Muher, Zay, and Siltʼe. Gurage is written left-to-right using a system based on the Geʽez script. Description Gurage artist Mahmoud Ahmed According to the historian Paul B. Henze, their origins are explained by traditions of a military expedition to the south during the last years of the Kingdom of Aksum, which left military colonies that eventually became isolated from both northern Ethiopia and each other.Henze, Layers of Time (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 112. However other historians have raised the issue of the complexity of Gurage Peoples if viewed as a singular group, for example Ulrich Braukhamper states that the Gurage East people may have been an extension of the ancient Harla people. Indeed, there is evidence that Harla architecture may have influenced old buildings (pre-16th c.) found near Harar (eastern Ethiopia), and the Gurage East group often cite kinship with Harari (Hararghe) peoples in the distant past. Braukhamper also states King Amda Seyon ordered Eritrean troops to be sent to mountainous regions in Gurage (named Gerege), which eventually became a permanent settlement. In addition to Amda Seyon's military settlement there, the permanence of Abyssinian presence in Gurage is documented during his descendants Zara Yaqob and Dawit II's reigns. Braukhamper also notes that some Amhara troops and their families likely fled areas in modern-day Gondar and Gojjam into the Gurage region during the Ethiopian-Adal War of the 1530s, since Abyssinia was drastically outgunned by the Adal troops which received supplies and arms from the Ottoman Empire. Thus, historically, Gurage peoples may be a complex mixture of Abyssinian, Harla, and other groups which migrated and settled in that region for differing reasons. The majority of the inhabitants of the Gurage Zone were reported as Muslim, with 51.02% of the population reporting that belief, while 41.91% practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, 5.79% were Protestants, and 1.12% Catholic. According to the 1994 Ethiopian census, self-identifying Gurage comprise about 2.7% of Ethiopia's population, or about 1.4 million people.Ethiopia: A Model Nation of Minorities (accessed 6 April 2006) The populations of Gurage people are not exactly known because approximately half of the population live outside of the Gurage zone. The Gurage live a sedentary life based on agriculture, involving a complex system of crop rotation and transplanting. Gurage people are known as hard workers and as a model of good work culture in the whole Ethiopia.Ensete is the main staple food, but other cash crops are grown, which include coffee and khat, both traditional stimulants. Animal husbandry is practiced, but mainly for milk supply and dung. Other foods consumed include green cabbage, cheese, butter, and roasted grains, with meat consumption being very limited (also used in rituals or ceremonies). The Gurage, the writer Nega Mezlekia notes, \\"have earned a reputation as skilled traders\\".Nega Mezlekia, Notes from the Hyena's Belly (New York: Picador, 2000), p. 227. One example of an enterprising Gurage is Tekke, who Nathaniel T. Kenney described as \\"an Ethiopian Horatio Alger, Jr.\\": \\"He began his career selling old bottles and tin cans; the Emperor [Haile Selassie] recently rewarded his achievement in creating his plantation by calling him to Addis Ababa and decorating him.\\"Kenney, \\"Ethiopian Adventure\\", National Geographic, 127 (1965), p. 582. Agriculture and ensete A Gurage teenager picking potatoes on one of the Ethiopian highlands The principal crop of the Gurage is ensete (also enset, ensete edulis, äsät or \\"false banana plant\\"). This has a massive stem that grows underground and is involved in every aspect of Gurage life. It has a place in everyday interactions among community members as well as specific roles in rituals. For example: the ritual uses of Ensete include wrapping a corpse after death with the fronds and tying off the umbilical cord after birth with an ensete fiber; the practical uses include wrapping goods and fireproofing thatch. Ensete is also exchanged as part of a variety of social interactions, and used as a recompense for services rendered.Shack, Dorothy. \\"Nutritional Processes and Personality Development among the Gurage of Ethiopia\\" in Food and Culture: A Reader. Ed. Carole Counihan and Penny van Esterik. (New York: Routledge, 1997). p121. Ensete can be prepared in a variety of ways. A normal Gurage diet consists primarily of kocho, a thick bread made from ensete, and is supplemented by cabbage, cheese, butter and grains. Meat is not consumed on a regular basis, but usually eaten when an animal is sacrificed during a ritual or ceremonial event. The Gurage pound the root of the Ensete to extract the edible substance, then place it in deep pits between the rows of ensete plants in the field. It ferments in the pit, which makes it more palatable. It can be stored for up to several years in this fashion, and the Gurage typically retain large surpluses of ensete as a protection against famine. The resulting paste is used to make porridge and bread. The only way to eat ensete is to make into a paste. In addition to ensete, a few cash crops are maintained (notably coffee and khat) and livestock is raised (mainly for milk and fertilizer). Some Gurage also plant teff and eat injera (which the Gurage also call injera). The Gurage raise zebu. These cattle are primarily kept for their butter, and a typical Gurage household has a large quantity of spiced butter aging in clay pots hung from the walls of their huts. Butter is believed to be medicinal, and the Gurage often take it internally or use it a lotion or poultice. A Gurage proverb states that \\"A sickness that has the upper hand over butter is destined for death.\\" Different species of ensete are also eaten to alleviate illness.Hunger, Anxiety, and Ritual: Deprivation and Spirit Possession Among the Gurage of Ethiopia Author(s): William A. Shack Source: Man, New Series, Vol. 6, No. 1 (Mar., 1971), pp. 30-43 The Gurage regard overeating as coarse and vulgar, and regard it as poor etiquette to eat all of the ensete that a host passes around to guests. It is considered polite to leave at least some ensete bread even after a very small portion is passed around.Hunger, Anxiety, and Ritual: Deprivation and Spirit Possession Among the Gurage of Ethiopia Author(s): William A. ShackSource: Man, New Series, Vol. 6, No. 1 (Mar., 1971), pp. 30-43 It is typically expected that a Gurage will extend hospitality to their neighbors and kinfolk in dispensing ensete freely to them. Food The Gurage in rural highland areas centre their lives on the cultivation of their staple crop Ensete. Kocho is made by shaping the ensete paste to a thick circle and wrapping it in a thin layer of ensete leaves. Its baked in a small pit with coals. Sometimes the paste is just cooked over a griddle. Kitfo a minced raw beef mixed with butter and spicy pepper is commonly attributed to the Gurage.

He was claimed to be one of the greatest of the Karaite scholars of the early Middle Ages. The Karaite historian Solomon ben Jeroham regarded him as greater even than Anan ben David. His name indicates that he is originally from Nahawand, a town in Iran (Persia).Yoram Erder, “Benjamin al-Nahāwandī”, in: Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World, Executive Editor Norman A. Stillman. Consulted online on 24 June 2017 Works Benjamin's work is, for the most part, known only in quotations made by subsequent Karaite writers. Japhet ben Ali, in the introduction to his commentary on the minor prophets, wrote that Benjamin was the author of several works, mostly in Judeo-Arabic: *a commentary on the Torah, in which he frequently refers to Oriental customs; *a commentary on Isaiah; *a commentary on Daniel, in which the word \\"yamim\\" (days)—in the verse \\"Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days\\" (xii. 12)—is explained by \\"years,\\" pointing thus to the year 1010 as the epoch of the arrival of the Messiah; *a commentary on Ecclesiastes and Song of Songs. *Sefer Mitzvot (\\"Book of Commandments\\"); *Sefer Dinim or \\"Mas'at Binyamin\\" (\\"Book of Laws\\", or \\"Gift of Benjamin\\"), written in Hebrew, and published at Koslov (Eupatoria) in 1834—containing civil and criminal laws according to Holy Writ. Rabbinical ordinances One of Benjamin's innovations was the adoption of many rabbinic ordinances, previously rejected by the Karaites. Unlike the rabbis, however, he left to the free choice of individual Karaites to reject or adopt these regulations. His opinion on these matters is summed up in his writing, Sefer Dinim (Book of Rules), in which he wrote \\"As for other rules, which are observed and recorded by the Rabbanites and for which I could find no pertinent biblical verse, I have written them down also, so that you might observe them likewise if you so desire.\\" For example, Benjamin promoted the rabbinic idea of cherem, with the caveat that the wrongdoer would have to be cursed for seven days following his refusal to obey a judge's summons, to give him a chance to repent and obey (Mas'at Binyamin 2a). Ironically, some dispute his authorship of the commentary on Isaiah and instead regard it as the work of Saadia Gaon, one of the greatest opponents of Karaism. Biblical Exegesis Benjamin at times approached the Rabbinites in Biblical exegesis also, and combated Anan's interpretations. Thus he maintained with the Rabbinites, against Anan, that the obligation to marry the widow of a childless brother extended only to the brother of the deceased and not to his further relations. He adopted the Talmudical interpretation of the Biblical words concerning the Sabbath—\\"Abide ye every man in his place\\" (Ex. xvi. 29)—maintaining that the prohibition herein expressed has reference, not to the residence, but to a distance beyond 2,000 yards of the town (cf. Elijah Bashyazi, \\"Adderet,\\" p. 63). Freedom in thought However, in spite of many concessions to Rabbinism, Benjamin adhered firmly to the principle, expressed by Anan, of penetrating research of the Scripture. In Benjamin's opinion one ought not to tie oneself down to the authorities, but to follow one's own convictions: the son may differ from the father, the disciple from the master, provided they have reasons for their different views. Inquiry to Benjamin was a duty, and he held that errors arrived at through sincere inquiry do not constitute a sin (compare Yefet ben Ali's commentary, cited in Dukes's \\"Beiträge,\\" ii. 26). Philosophy of the Bible Benjamin seems to have written a work in which he expounded the philosophical ideas contained in the Bible. Judging from the quotations made by later Karaite writers, such as Jacob al-Qirqisani, Yefet ben Ali, and Hadassi, Benjamin betrayed the influence of Philonic ideas, while he adopted the Motazilite theories on the divine attributes, free-will, and other questions of a like character expounded before by Anan. God, he holds, is too sublime to mingle with the material world; and the idea that matter proceeded directly from God is inadmissible. God created first the Glory (\\"Kabod\\"), then the Throne (\\"Kisse\\"), and afterward an Angel. This Angel created the world, in which he is the representative of God. God Himself never came in contact with men, nor did He speak to Israel on Mt. Sinai. The Law and the communications to the Prophets proceeded from the Angel, to whom are referable all the anthropological expressions concerning God found in the Bible (Hadassi, \\"Eshkol,\\" 25b). The soul forms a part of the body, and is therefore perishable. The Biblical references to reward and punishment can be applied only to the body (Saadia, \\"Emunot we ha-De'ot,\\" vi. 4). This theory of an intermediary power, and the system of allegorizing all the Biblical passages concerning God, upon which Benjamin insists again and again in his commentaries on the Bible, were borrowed from the writings of the etc. Magâriyah (Men of the Caves). This etc., the establishment of which, in consequence of a confusion in the text of Shahrastani, has been wrongfully attributed to Benjamin, is identified with the Essenes by Abraham Harkavy, who shows that they were called \\"The Men of the Caves,\\" because they lived in the desert. Benjamin wrote his halakhic works in Hebrew.

He played a key role in the Union victory at the Battle of Stones River. Early life Negley was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, son of Jacob Negley and Mary Ann Scott. His aunt Sarah married Thomas Mellon. He was educated in public schools, and graduated from the University of Pittsburgh (which was known as the Western University of Pennsylvania at the time). He served in a volunteer regiment, Company K of the Duquesne Greys, 1st Pennsylvania Volunteers, during the Mexican–American War. After the war, he became a farmer and horticulturist. Civil War General James S. Negley (standing uncovered) and Staff during the Battle of Lookout Mountain On April 19, 1861, Negley was appointed brigadier general in the Pennsylvania Militia. He raised a brigade of Pennsylvania volunteers and served under Robert Patterson in the Shenandoah Valley in 1861. His appointment as brigadier general expired on July 20 but he was reappointed brigadier general of volunteers on October 1, 1861. In October, he was placed in command of the 7th Brigade in the Department of the Ohio. He commanded the Union expedition (raid) against Chattanooga during the Confederate Heartland Offensive. The expedition proved to be a successful demonstration of the Union Army's ability to strike deep into the heart of Confederate held territory.James B. Jones, Jr. \\"Negley's Raid.\\" North & South, vol. 11, no. 2, p. 84. On November 29, 1862, he was appointed major general of volunteers and took command of the 8th Division in the Army of the Ohio. His division became the 2nd Division in George H. Thomas' Center Wing of the XIV Corps during the Battle of Stones River. On the second day of fighting, he led a successful counterattack against Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge on the Union left flank. He commanded his division during the Tullahoma Campaign and the Battle of Chickamauga. During the maneuvering that preceded the Battle of Chickamauga, Negley's division, in the advance of Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas's corps, was almost trapped in a cul-de-sac named McLemore's Cove, but command confusion in the Confederate Army of Tennessee allowed them to escape in what became known as the Battle of Davis' Crossroads.Cozzens, pp. 175-85. After the Union defeat at Chickamauga, Negley, whose division became scattered during the second day's fighting, was relieved of command, but was acquitted of any wrongdoing during the battle. The most recent study of his actions is highly critical to the general for vanishing from sight without anyone knowing where to find him.David Powell, \\"Negley at Horseshoe Ridge,\\" in The Chickamauga Campaign, ed. Steven E. Woodworth, Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 2010), pp. 140-164. Negley, however, blamed his misfortunes on the prejudices toward him of West Point graduates. When Ulysses S. Grant became general-in- chief in 1864 he discussed restoring Negley to command.Grant, p. 368. However, after serving on several administrative boards, Negley resigned in January 1865. Fort Negley, built in Nashville, Tennessee in 1862 was named after him. It was the largest stone inland fort built during the war. Postbellum career After the war, Negley was elected as a Republican to the United States Congress in 1868 and served from 1869 to 1875. In 1877, during the Pittsburgh Railway Riots, Negley served as commander of the militia organized by the city of Pittsburgh to maintain order in the city. He served on the board of managers of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers from 1874 to 1878 and from 1882 to 1888. He was re-elected to Congress in 1884 and served from 1885 to 1887. After retiring from politics, he was engaged in the railroad industry. The community of Negley, Ohio bears his name after being founded by the New York, Pittsburgh & Chicago Railway line. In 1897, he became a Veteran Companion of the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of Foreign Wars. Negley died in Plainfield, New Jersey, aged 74. He is buried in the Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh. The famous twentieth century foreign correspondent Negley Farson was a relative and namesake of the general.

It is shaped like a five-pointed star. This allowed for greater numbers of gun emplacements on its walls than a traditional Japanese fortress, and reduced the number of blind spots where a cannon could not fire. The fort was built by the Tokugawa shogunate to protect the Tsugaru Strait against a possible invasion by the Russian fleet. Goryōkaku is famous as the site of the last battle of the Boshin War. The fighting lasted for a week (June 20–27, 1869).

His films include Bad Day at Black Rock (1955), Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957), The Magnificent Seven (1960), The Great Escape (1963), and Ice Station Zebra (1968). In 2013, The Magnificent Seven was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Although both he and fellow director Preston Sturges were from the Chicago area and shared the same last name, they had no known close relation to each other.  Career  Sturges started his career in Hollywood as an editor in 1932. During World War II, Sturges directed documentaries and training films as a captain in the United States Army Air Forces.John Sturges at Encyclopedia Britannica. Retrieved May 24, 2020. Sturges's mainstream directorial career began with The Man Who Dared (1946), the first of many B movies. He made imaginative use of the widescreen CinemaScope format by placing Spencer Tracy alone against a vast desert panorama in the suspense film Bad Day at Black Rock (1955), for which he received a Best Director Oscar nomination. Over the course of his career, Sturges developed a reputation for elevated character- based drama within the confines of genre filmmaking. He was awarded the Golden Boot Award in 1992 for his lifetime contribution to Westerns. He once met Akira Kurosawa, who told him that he loved The Magnificent Seven (which was a remake of Kurosawa's Seven Samurai). Sturges considered this the proudest moment of his professional career. The Magnificent Seven was an inductee in the 2013 National Film Registry list. Sturges commented that its popularity is due in part as a springboard for several young actors, transporting the locale from Japan to Mexico, putting a twist into the career of Yul Brynner, and having part of its score used as the Marlboro cigarette commercial theme.

Though the brand is now headquartered in California, its origins and main company today are in Hong Kong. Maisto mainly manufactures die-cast models of automobiles, aircraft, and motorcycles. The company has also manufactured a number of Tonka products under license from Hasbro. It also now owns the former Italian Bburago and Polistil brand names. Company history In the 1980s, Maisto became well known as a diecast vehicle producer after a business conglomeration of May Tat Toy (Mainly motorcycles), May Cheong (MC Toy - which produced smaller vehicles), and Maisto. Through the 1990s, Maisto was considered the US division of Master Toy Co. Ltd. of Thailand with May Cheong being the Kowloon, Hong Kong, subsidiary (Johnson 1998, 119). Maisto 1:18 scale 1951 VW export sedan. Note good detail on 'metal' of spare tire, but imprecision of whitewall. The May Cheong Group is based in Hong Kong and their products are made in China and Thailand (Rixon 2005, 64). The factories in China and Thailand manufacture 1:12, 1:18, 1:24, 1:25, 1:27, 1:43, 1:31 and 1:64 scale replicas. Most models are officially licensed products, based on popular vehicles. Others, however, are fantastical rod and custom creations more in line with the Hot Wheels formula. The US warehouse and distribution center, aka Maisto International, Inc, is located in Fontana, California. In 2005 the May Cheong Group acquired the assets of the famous Italian brand Bburago. Later, Maisto also obtained the Polistil name, another well-known Italian scale model manufacturer that had previously gone bankrupt. Automobiles BMW Z8 roadster. Maisto gained popularity around 1990, mainly competing in 1/18 scale with Italian Bburago, Polistil and the more expensive - and often more spotty Franklin Mint Precision Models. By 2000, a whole host of companies like Yatming, Ertl, and even Mattel's Hot Wheels had entered the larger scale 1:18 fray. Especially since Bburago failed (being now a part of May Cheong itself), no other company overall has been able to compete with Maisto at the larger scale, except perhaps Jada Toys. Even so, the 1:18 scale market is not as prevalent as it was. Circa 2010, 1:24 is still popular, but the larger scales have waned in retail stores. Maisto vehicles of 1/18 scale usually have all features open with nicely appointed engines and interiors. Models have nearly perfectly proportioned bodies and usually have excellently researched detail considering models are mass- produced in the hundreds of thousands. Still, paint application may be too thick or not uniform, and details that should be chrome are often painted silver (Strohl 2005, p. 74). Body panels may be uneven, lights unrealistic, and trim rather thick and gaudy (Review: Maisto 2010). Muscle Machines magazine noted that the 1963 Dodge 330 Hemi was completely devoid of any indication of a gear shift of any type (even push button on the dash; see Strohl 2004, p. 14). Collectors wanting finer crafting in this size must look to AUTOart, CMC, or Exoto at the higher dollar end of miniature modeling. Audi Quattro Rosemeyer concept car in 1:18 scale. 1/64 scale Maisto die-cast models are comparable in quality and details to Matchbox, Hot Wheels and Johnny Lightning, but new models in this scale are not released very often. Newer lines offer vehicles in more customized themes. One such line is the AllStarz which features custom rims, special paint jobs, lowered suspension and super upgraded in-car entertainment systems. Another line is Pro Rodz which uses the same themes but consists of classic American muscle cars. Both lines are in direct competition with 'Jada Toys' 'Dub City' and 'Big Time Muscle' brands that started the 'bling' trends in auto toys. Around late 2010, Maisto toys sold in Wal-Mart stores took on the name 'Adventure Wheels' on all Maisto packaging with red-orange and yellow gold box and blister pack colors with black trim. Maisto produces many licensed properties that reflected contemporary promotional and industry trends. For example, it is an official licensee of Harley-Davidson Motorcycle Company. Chrysler is a big user of Maisto for promo models - one example was the offering of three different versions of the PT Cruiser (stock, sport and panel) made available first to auto journalists, but later sold normally in Walmart and other stores (Doty 2000, p. 88). The brand was popularly seen in Sam's Club until about 2010. LinesVehicles= Maisto Porsche 550 Spyder in 1:32 scale.

The route exists in two sections, which both form the Nassau Expressway. NY 878's western terminus is the Belt Parkway and Conduit Avenue (NY 27) in Ozone Park, within southern Queens. Its southern terminus is immediately before the Village of Atlantic Beach, at the Atlantic Beach Bridge in Lawrence, within southwestern Nassau County. NY 878 is discontinuous between Farmers Boulevard in Queens and the town of Inwood in Nassau County. The two sections are connected to each other by Rockaway Boulevard and Rockaway Turnpike. NY 878 is maintained in part by the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT); the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT); and the government of Nassau County. The NYSDOT also maintains part of Rockaway Boulevard, which is designated as the reference route NY 909G. The of NY 878 between I-678 and the JFK Expressway is officially designated Interstate 878 (I-878), but not signed as such. This segment is instead signed as NY 878\\\\. The NYSDOT designated the eastbound lanes of the freeway as I-878 in January 1970, but the entire Nassau Expressway was publicly re-designated as NY 878 by 1991. The unsigned Interstate 878 is the shortest Interstate Highway in the United States. NY 878, the Nassau Expressway, was originally planned in 1945 as a freeway between the Belt Parkway in Queens and Long Beach in Nassau. The expressway was supposed to replace Rockaway Boulevard and Turnpike in the vicinity of what is now JFK Airport, connecting to a proposed Long Beach Expressway south of Atlantic Beach Bridge. The short freeway portion in Queens was originally built as part of Interstate 78 (I-78) in the late 1960s, but the segment of I-78 through New York City was canceled in March 1971 due to community opposition. Through the 1970s, the rest of the freeway south of 150th Street was also canceled for various reasons. A scaled-down version of the road in Nassau County, a 4-lane arterial road, was completed in 1990. There has been an attempt to complete the section of the freeway in Queens, but it was deferred due to the early 1990s economic recession. Route descriptionNorthern segment= Looking westward at the beginning of the eastbound Nassau Expressway at Cross Bay Boulevard, concurrent with NY 27\\\\. The northwest section in Queens is mostly built to freeway standards, except for a traffic light at the eastern end of the highway. It lies along the north edge of JFK Airport, just south of the Belt Parkway and Conduit Avenue (NY 27). Officially NY 878 starts at the interchange between the Belt Parkway, Conduit Avenue (NY 27) and Cross Bay Boulevard, and it stretches east to the intersection of Rockaway and Farmers Boulevards. The eastbound freeway does begin in the median of Conduit Avenue just west of Cross Bay Boulevard, but it carries NY 27 until the highways split at a point between the IND Rockaway Line underpass and Lefferts Boulevard. The separate NY 878 begins at that split, but the route only carries eastbound one-way traffic until it reaches the junction with I-678 (Van Wyck Expressway). There it becomes a two-way freeway. NY 878 continues east past the JFK Expressway, and the freeway ends at a traffic light at North Hangar Road. NY 878 ends soon after at Rockaway Boulevard and Farmers Boulevard. The stretch from I-678 (Van Wyck Expressway) east to the JFK Expressway is designated but not signed as I-878 by the Federal Highway Administration. This makes I-878 the shortest three-digit Interstate Route and the shortest Interstate Highway in the Interstate Highway System. This section of NY 878 only has route designations for the eastbound lanes.For images of the signs, see: * The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) designates I-878 as the stretch of NY 878 from the Van Wyck Expressway east to the 150th Street underpass. The entire segment, including the unsigned I-878, is maintained by the NYSDOT. Rockaway Boulevard in Queens, as well as Rockaway Turnpike in Nassau County, connect the two halves of NY 878\\\\. From the end of NY 878 to near Guy R. Brewer Boulevard, the road is maintained by the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT). From Guy R. Brewer Boulevard to just before the city line, the road is designated as the unsigned state reference route NY 909G. The last before the city border are city-maintained. The part of Rockaway Turnpike that connects to NY 878 is maintained by Nassau County. =Southern segment= The southeast section of NY 878 is a surface expressway, with only two bridges grade-separating the highway from intersecting routes – over the Far Rockaway Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, and under Seagirt Boulevard at a trumpet interchange. Signage for NY 878 can be seen from the split with Rockaway Turnpike south to the toll plaza of the Atlantic Beach Bridge in Lawrence. However, the NYSDOT only considers a piece of the highway to be part of NY 878\\\\. The state-maintained portion of NY 878 comprises the segment south of Burnside Avenue in Inwood. The segment from Rockaway Turnpike to Burnside Avenue is maintained by the highway. The southern section of NY 878 has no connections to other state routes. History Predecessors and planning = Heading north from the Atlantic Beach Bridge on NY 878 in Nassau County The portion of Rockaway Boulevard and Turnpike between NY 27 and the Atlantic Beach Bridge was originally designated as NY 104 by 1931. However, this designation was removed by 1932. The expressway was first proposed in late 1945, to connect Brooklyn with southeastern Queens and the South Shore of Long Island, as well as to provide a link to Idlewild (now JFK) Airport. It was among several highways planned jointly between Robert Moses' Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA), and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. By 1949, the Nassau Expressway was planned along with a replacement for the original Atlantic Beach Bridge. It was envisioned by Moses and Nassau County executive J. Russell Sprague as a vital link between Atlantic Beach, the Belt Parkway system, and the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge. A contract for preliminary engineering work was awarded that year. As originally proposed, the highway would have only extended from the interchange with Van Wyck Expressway and Belt Parkway to the Atlantic Beach Bridge. In the beginning, the Nassau Expressway was supposed to be a single highway, with the now- separate spurs to be connected by a highway running parallel to Rockaway Boulevard and Rockaway Turnpike. The connector highway would have passed through the wetlands of Idlewild and Hook Creek, then turned south through the small community of Meadowmere, Queens, located near Five Towns. This route was favored as a replacement to Rockaway Boulevard/Turnpike, which was viewed as inadequate and congested. A map of the expressway was presented to the Nassau residents in 1951. Three years later, the state made the first land acquisitions for the Nassau segment of the expressway. The Nassau Expressway was proposed alongside the never-built Long Beach Expressway. The Long Beach Expressway would have extended east past the Atlantic Beach Bridge along the South Shore to Long Beach and Lido Beach, ending at a junction with the Loop Parkway leading to Jones Beach and the Meadowbrook State Parkway. The Long Beach Expressway would have been a six-lane expressway, running along Reynolds Channel on the north shore of the Long Beach Barrier Island to New York Avenue, then along Park Avenue, which was the primary commercial thoroughfare of Long Beach. The Nassau Expressway was mapped as part of the Interstate Highway System in 1961. At that point, the New York State Department of Public Works began purchasing land for both the Nassau and Long Beach Expressways. Over of land were ceded from Idlewild Park near JFK Airport for the construction of the expressway. The small community of Meyers Harbor, located in the Hook Creek wetlands east of the modern Five Towns Shopping Center, was condemned and destroyed to provide a path for the expressway. Many homes in Inwood were either condemned and demolished or relocated in order to facilitate the expressway. However, Long Beach residents opposed the proposed expressway's routing along Park Avenue, as the residents believed the highway would create a \\"Chinese Wall\\" dividing their community. The Long Beach Expressway was vetoed by the state in 1967 due to community opposition. = Construction and delays = The first section of the Nassau Expressway to be built was a eastbound-only segment between Cross Bay Boulevard and 150th Street. The eastbound lanes ended at a point near JFK Expressway. The Nassau Expressway intersected with the Van Wyck Expressway at JFK Airport. The construction of this section was approved by the New York City Planning Commission and New York City Board of Estimate in 1963, and work began in 1965. The new roadway was completed in either 1967 or 1971. The construction of the highway's eastbound lanes drastically reduced congestion and increased average traffic speeds for drivers traveling eastbound on South Conduit Avenue and the Nassau Expressway. Westbound drivers on North Conduit Avenue continued to experience congestion since no new highway lanes had been built for these drivers. This corridor saw an average of 600,000 daily trips by 1981, of which 20% were made by airport travelers. Construction along Rockaway Boulevard and in Nassau County was hindered due to the presence of muck, which was located in the wetlands near the Queens-Nassau border. The muck could not be built upon, and removing it would be both expensive and environmentally risky. The wetlands had previously been used as a garbage landfill by the New York City Department of Sanitation. In addition, residents opposed this segment of the highway. As with the canceled Long Beach Expressway it would have created a \\"Chinese wall\\" between communities in Nassau County. In March 1971, Governor Nelson Rockefeller revealed a plan for improving New York City highways. The plan denied funding to several proposed New York City Interstate Highways, including the Nassau Expressway segment east of 150th Street to Rockaway Boulevard. Rockefeller said that these highways did not qualify for a funding agreement from the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1952, in which the federal government would pay 90% of the proposed highway's cost. The New York Times quoted a state official who said that this move had the effect of canceling these projects. By that time, less than a quarter of the proposed $51.8 million, highway had been completed. The only section open at the time, the eastbound freeway west of JFK Airport, had been built at a cost of $18 million. Maps from the 1970s show that the connector between the Van Wyck and Rockaway Boulevard had yet to be constructed. However, a 1971 New York Times article mentioned that the freeway between the Van Wyck Expressway and 150th Street was already open. At the time, the entire highway from Queens to Nassau was planned for completion in 1981. By around late 1973, work on the project restarted. Builders sought funds from the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973 to pay for construction. At that time, plans called for the completion of the highway's westbound lanes west of 150th Street, as well as the sections of the freeway along Rockaway Boulevard and in Nassau County. Rockaway Boulevard would have also been relocated and modernized. However, the federal government refused to approve the funding, and the money was instead distributed among projects in Arkansas; Indiana; and Fort Worth, Texas. This further delayed the construction of the Nassau Expressway. By then, the unbuilt segment in Nassau was called the \\"phantom expressway\\" because it had been in the planning stages for decades. The right-of-way for the unbuilt expressway became an unused, rodent-infested \\"wasteland\\". Meanwhile, Rockaway Turnpike was carrying five times the number of cars it had been built to accommodate. In 1976, New York Governor Hugh Carey announced the publication of the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT)'s five-year, $212 million highway improvement plan. This proposal included completing much of the rest of the Nassau Expressway. Three years later, the NYSDOT published plans for the segment of the expressway that would be built in Nassau. A revised plan for the Nassau County section of the highway was introduced around 1981. It called for a four-lane arterial highway between Rockaway Turnpike and the Atlantic Beach Bridge. This section was opened in March 1990. Also around 1980, plans to complete the westbound lanes of the expressway in Queens were reintroduced. The new expressway would include direct access to Aqueduct Racetrack. Work on the expressway project was to begin in 1998. However, by the 1990s, the project had not commenced, even though the new expressway would have relieved congestion on the parallel Belt Parkway. Construction was delayed indefinitely in 1995 due to a lack of funds due to the early-1990s recession, as well as a general decline in horse racing at the Aqueduct Racetrack, which obviated the need for the westbound freeway in Queens. In 1998, Nassau County legislator Bruce A. Blakeman proposed renaming the southern portion of NY 878 after President Ronald Reagan. Originally, he wanted that name applied to the Seaford–Oyster Bay Expressway (NY 135) further east. After opposition to that expressway's renaming, Blakeman then proposed renaming the Nassau Expressway after Reagan. However, the Nassau Expressway renaming proposal was also opposed. In October 2014, Nassau County Legislator Howard Kopel (representing Lawrence) and New York State Assemblyman Phil Goldfeder (representing Howard Beach, Broad Channel, and the Rockaways) advocated for the completion of the entire Nassau Expressway, in order to alleviate traffic on Rockaway Boulevard and Rockaway Turnpike, and to provide an evacuation route in the event of a natural disaster. =Designation history= I-78, including the Bushwick Expressway, Nassau Expressway, and Clearview Expressway extension From circa 1959 until 1970, the I-878 designation was used for a section of what is now I-278 (Bruckner Expressway) between Sheridan Boulevard (formerly the Sheridan Expressway) and the Cross Bronx Expressway (I-95) in the Bronx. I-278 was routed north on the Sheridan, while its present route was taken by I-878. At that time, the northwest piece of present NY 878 was to be part of I-78, which would have continued from the Holland Tunnel along the Lower Manhattan Expressway, Williamsburg Bridge and Bushwick Expressway to reach the Nassau Expressway at Cross Bay Boulevard. Northeast of Kennedy Airport, I-78 was to turn north onto the Clearview Expressway, using the Throgs Neck Bridge and Cross Bronx Expressway to end at the Bruckner Interchange. * Note that I-95 is shown on the Hutchinson River Parkway north of the Bruckner Interchange, but the 1955 \\"Yellow Book\\" map shows the I-78 route on the Bruckner Expressway. The one-way eastbound section of the Nassau Expressway from Cross Bay Boulevard to the Van Wyck Expressway was built in 1967, when the highway was still part of I-78. I-78 through New York City was canceled in March 1971. Effective January 1, 1970, the year before, the Nassau Expressway and unbuilt Cross Brooklyn Expressway, stretching from I-278 at the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge east to the Atlantic Beach Bridge, was officially designated I-878 by the NYSDOT. The Nassau Expressway was redesignated as NY 878 by 1991. Until 2005, the southern terminus of the southern portion of NY 878 was at Meadow Causeway. At the time, the portion of the Nassau Expressway from Meadow Causeway to the Seagirt Boulevard interchange was maintained by Nassau County while the section between the Seagirt Boulevard interchange and the Atlantic Beach Bridge toll barrier was maintained by the NYSDOT as NY 900V, a long reference route. In 2005, NY 878 was extended south to its present terminus at the Atlantic Beach Bridge toll barrier, resulting in an overlap with NY 900V. The NY 900V designation, now redundant to NY 878, was removed by October 2007. Major intersections Exit numbers on NY 878's northern segment are only posted in the eastbound direction. There are no exit numbers for the westbound lanes. * For images of the signage, use Google Street View.

Virtually all DLCs are cross-border, and have tax and other advantages for the corporations and their stockholders. In a conventional merger or acquisition, the merging companies become a single legal entity, with one business buying the outstanding shares of the other. However, when a DLC is created, the two companies continue to exist, and to have separate bodies of shareholders, but they agree to share all the risks and rewards of the ownership of all their operating businesses in a fixed proportion, laid out in a contract called an \\"equalization agreement\\". The equalization agreements are set up to ensure equal treatment of both companies’ shareholders in voting and cash flow rights. The contracts cover issues that determine the distribution of these legal and economic rights between the twin parents, including issues related to dividends, liquidation, and corporate governance. Usually, the two companies will share a single board of directors and have an integrated management structure. A DLC is somewhat like a joint venture, but the two parties share everything they own, not just a single project; in that sense, a DLC is similar to a general partnership between publicly held corporations. Examples Some major dual-listed companies are listed in :Category:Dual-listed companies include:Jaideep Bedi, et al., \\"The Characteristics and Trading Behavior of Dual-Listed Companies\\", Reserve Bank of Australia, June 2003. *BHP (Australia/UK 2001- ) — BHP Group Limited (Australian Securities Exchange, ASX), BHP Group plc (London Stock Exchange, LSE) *Carnival Corporation & plc (Panama/UK 2003- ) — Carnival Corporation (NYSE), Carnival plc (LSE) *Investec (South Africa/UK 2002- ) — Investec plc (LSE), Investec Limited (JSE) *Ninety One (South Africa/UK 2020- ) — Ninety One plc (LSE), Ninety One Limited (JSE) *Rio Tinto Group (Australia/UK 1995- ) — Rio Tinto Limited (ASX), Rio Tinto plc (LSE) *Unilever (UK/Netherlands 1930- ) — Unilever plc (LSE), Unilever N.V.

In virtually all cases, the two companies are listed in different countries. There are often tax reasons for companies from different jurisdictions to adopt a DLC structure instead of a regular merger where a single share is created. A capital gains tax could be owed if an outright merger took place, but no such tax consequence would arise with a DLC deal. Differences in tax regimes may also favour a DLC structure, because cross-border dividend payments are minimized. In addition, there may be favourable tax consequences for the companies themselves. Once companies have chosen a DLC structure, there can be major tax obstacles to cancelling the arrangement. Issues of national pride may sometimes also be involved; where both parties to a proposed merger or takeover are in a strong position and do not need to merge or accept a takeover, it can be easier to push it through if the country with the smaller business is not \\"losing\\" its corporation. A third motive is the reduction of investor flow-back, which would depress the price of the stock of one of the firms in their own market if the merger route were used instead. That is, some institutional investors cannot own the shares of firms domiciled outside the home country or can only own such shares in limited quantity. In addition, in a merger, the non-surviving firm would be removed from all the indices. Index tracking funds would then have to sell the shares of the surviving company. With the DLC structure, all of this would be avoided. A fourth motive is that DLCs do not necessarily require regulatory (anti-trust) consent and may not be constrained by the requirement of foreign investment approval. Finally, the access to local capital markets may be reduced when a quotation disappears in a regular merger. This is based on the idea that local investors are already familiar with the company from the pre- DLC period. However, the DLC structure also has disadvantages. The structure may hamper transparency for investors and reduce managerial efficiency. In addition, issuing shares in a merger and capital market transactions (such as SEOs, share repurchases, and stock splits) are more complex under the DLC structure. Mispricing in DLCs The shares of the DLC parents represent claims on exactly the same underlying cash flows. In integrated and efficient financial markets, stock prices of the DLC parents should therefore move in lockstep. In practice, however, large differences from theoretical price parity can arise. For example, in the early 1980s Royal Dutch NV was trading at a discount of approximately 30% relative to Shell Transport and Trading PLC. In the academic finance literature, Rosenthal and Young (1990)Rosenthal, L., and C. Young, 1990, The seemingly anomalous price behavior of Royal Dutch/Shell and Unilever N.V./PLC, Journal of Financial Economics 26, 123-141. and Froot and Dabora (1999)Froot, K.A., and E.M. Dabora, 1999, How are stock prices affected by the location of trade?, Journal of Financial Economics 53, 189-216. show that significant mispricing in three DLCs (Royal Dutch Shell, Unilever, and Smithkline Beecham) has existed over a long period of time. Both studies conclude that fundamental factors (such as currency risk, governance structures, legal contracts, liquidity, and taxation) are not sufficient to explain the magnitude of the price deviations. Froot and Dabora (1999) show that the relative prices of the twin stocks are correlated with the stock indices of the markets on which each of the twins has its main listing. For example, if the FTSE 100 rises relative to the AEX index (the Dutch stock market index) the stock price of Reed International PLC generally tends to rise relative to the stock price of Elsevier NV. De Jong, Rosenthal, and van Dijk (2008)de Jong, A., L. Rosenthal and M.A. van Dijk, 2008, The Risk and Return of Arbitrage in Dual-Listed Companies, June 2008. report similar effects for nine other DLCs. A potential explanation is that local market sentiment affects the relative prices of the shares of the DLC parent companies. Because of the absence of \\"fundamental reasons\\" for the mispricing, DLCs have become known as a textbook example of arbitrage opportunities, see for example Brealey, Myers, and Allen (2006, chapter 13).Brealey, R.A., Myers, S.C. and Allen, F. (2006) Principles of Corporate Finance, 8th edition, McGraw-Hill Irwin. Arbitrage in DLCs Price differences between the two markets in which dual-listed companies are listed (also called mispricing) has led to a number of financial institutions trying to exploit the mispricing by setting up arbitrage positions in such circumstances. These arbitrage strategies involve a long position in the relatively underpriced part of the DLC and a short position in the relatively overpriced part. For example, in the early 1980s an arbitrageur might have built up a long position in Royal Dutch NV and a short position in Shell Transport and Trading plc. This position would have yielded profits when the relative prices of Royal Dutch and Shell converged to theoretical parity. An internal document of Merrill Lynchhttp://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~msiegel/merrill.doc investigates arbitrage opportunities in six DLCs. Lowenstein (2000)Lowenstein, R., 2000, When genius failed: The rise and fall of Long-Term Capital Management, Random House. describes arbitrage positions of the hedge-fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) in Royal Dutch/Shell. LTCM established an arbitrage position in this DLC in the summer of 1997, when Royal Dutch traded at an eight to ten percent premium. In total $2.3 billion was invested, half long in Shell and the other half short in Royal Dutch (Lowenstein, p. 99). In the autumn of 1998 large defaults on Russian debt created significant losses for the hedge fund and LTCM had to unwind several positions. Lowenstein reports that the premium of Royal Dutch had increased to about 22 percent and LTCM had to close the position and incur a loss. According to Lowenstein (p. 234), LTCM lost $286 million in equity pairs trading and more than half of this loss is accounted for by the Royal Dutch/Shell trade. The example of LTCM is a good illustration of why arbitrage by financial institutions has not succeeded in eliminating the mispricing in DLCs. An important characteristic of DLC arbitrage is that the underlying shares are not convertible into each other. Hence, risky arbitrage positions must be kept open until prices converge. Since there is no identifiable date at which DLC prices will converge, arbitrageurs with limited horizons who are unable to close the price gap on their own face considerable uncertainty. De Jong, Rosenthal, and van Dijk (2008) simulate arbitrage strategies in twelve DLCs over the period 1980-2002. They show that in some cases, arbitrageurs would have to wait for almost nine years before prices have converged and the position can be closed. In the short run, the mispricing might deepen. In these situations, arbitrageurs receive margin calls, after which they would most likely be forced to liquidate part of the position at a highly unfavorable moment and suffer a loss. As a result, arbitrage strategies in DLCs are very risky, which is likely to impede arbitrage.

He was a long time friend and associate of mobsters Lucky Luciano and Meyer Lansky, who he sat on The Commission (mafia) with. Zwillman's criminal organization was a part of the National Crime Syndicate and mainly operated throughout the 1920s-1950's with its peak in the late 1930s. Biography It is believed that Zwillman was born on July 27, 1904, in Newark, New Jersey. He was one of seven children born to Reuben and Anna Slavinsky Zwillman, Russian- Jewish immigrants. He was forced to quit school to support his family after his father's death in 1918. Zwillman first began working at a Prince Street café, the headquarters of a local alderman in Newark's Third Ward. However, in need of more money, Zwillman was eventually forced to quit, later selling fruits and vegetables in his neighborhood with a rented horse and wagon. Zwillman was unable to compete with the cheaper Prince Street pushcarts, however, so he moved to the more upper-class neighborhood of Clinton Hill, where he began selling lottery tickets to local housewives. He observed that much more money was made selling lottery tickets than produce, so he concentrated on selling lottery tickets through local merchants. By 1920, Zwillman controlled the bulk of the numbers racket with the help of hired muscle. =Prohibition= At the start of Prohibition, Zwillman began smuggling whiskey into New Jersey through Canada, using several World War I armored trucks. Zwillman later joined a syndicate headed by Joseph Reinfeld to smuggle liquor from Canada using ships. They were reputed to have controlled 40% of liquor smuggling. Zwillman used this revenue to greatly expand his operations in illegal gambling, prostitution, and labor racketeering, as well as legitimate businesses, including several prominent night clubs and restaurants. In 1929, he was sent to prison for six months, for assaulting an associate. It was the only crime for which he was ever convicted. Zwillman dated actress Jean Harlow at one time and got her a two-picture deal at Columbia Pictures by giving a huge cash loan to studio head, Harry Cohn. Zwillman also bought Harlow a jeweled bracelet and a red Cadillac. He referred to her in derogatory terms to other mobsters in secret surveillance recordings. He married Mary de Groot Mendels Steinbach, in 1939. She was the only daughter of Eugene Mendels, whose father, Emanuel S. Mendels, was a founder of the American Stock Exchange (then known as the Curb Exchange). The Zwillmans had a daughter, Lynn Kathryn Zwillman born c. 1944. Mary Zwillman had a son from previous marriage, who became Abner Zwillman's stepson. =The \\"Al Capone of New Jersey\\"= After Dutch Schultz's murder in 1935, Zwillman took over those of Schultz's criminal operations that were in New Jersey. The press began calling Zwillman the \\"Al Capone of New Jersey.\\" However, Zwillman often sought to legitimize his image, offering a reward for the return of the Lindbergh baby in 1932, and contributed to charities, including $250,000 to a Newark slum-clearing project. Shortly after taking over Schultz's operations, Zwillman became involved in local politics, eventually controlling the majority of local politicians in Newark for over twenty years. During the 1940s Zwillman, along with long-time associate Willie Moretti, dominated gambling operations in New Jersey, in particular the Marine Room inside Zwillman's Riviera nightclub, The Palisades. In 1951, Zwillman's activities were a major focus by the Kefauver Committee on organized crime. While Zwillman acknowledged that he was a bootlegger during Prohibition, he insisted that his subsequent businesses were legitimate. Zwillman was also close to many celebrities, including Joe DiMaggio. When Zwillman was being investigated by the Kefauver Committee along with other alleged \\"Outfit\\" members he reportedly planted three trunks full of money with DiMaggio to hide it from the IRS. It was not returned after Zwillman's death. In 1956, Zwillman was tried for income tax evasion. The jury became deadlocked and the charges were dismissed. Several associates of Zwillman were subsequently arrested and charged with bribing two of the jurors. Death During the 1959 McClellan Senate Committee hearings on organized crime, Zwillman was issued a subpoena to testify before the committee. Zwillman was found hanged in his West Orange, New Jersey, residence on February 27, 1959, shortly before he was to appear. In accordance with Jewish custom, he was buried the same day, after a funeral attended by 1,850, including celebrities and his 80-year-old mother, Ella. Zwillman's death was ruled a suicide, attributed to intractable income tax and health problems. His stepson, John Steinbach, said that he was also depressed about Senate investigations into jukebox racketeering and a jury tampering investigation, related to a previous failed attempt to prosecute him. However, police found bruises on Zwillman's wrists, supporting a theory that Zwillman had been tied up before being hanged. It is often speculated that Vito Genovese had ordered Zwillman killed. Others have alleged that Meyer Lansky, suspecting that the New Jersey gangster had agreed to become a government informant, gave permission for the Italian Mafia to take action against Zwillman. The theory that he was hanged was also supported by deported mobster Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano, who allegedly told journalist Martin Gosch in Italy that the suicide theory was nonsense, and that before hanging him, Zwillman's killers had trussed him up like a pig. Martin Gosch's biography (which he co- authored with Richard Hammer) of Lucky Luciano is somewhat controversial and considered fictional by many mob experts. However, the authors have claimed that the contents are entirely based on interviews with Luciano, who died before the book was published. His widow remarried three years later, to sports figure Harry Wismer. His daughter Lynn married Winslow G. Tuttle in 1968. ReferencesFurther reading *Stuart, Mark A.

The Battle of Mill Springs, also known as the Battle of Fishing Creek in Confederate terminology, and the Battle of Logan's Cross Roads in Union terminology, was fought in Wayne and Pulaski counties, near current Nancy, Kentucky, on January 19, 1862, as part of the American Civil War. The Union victory concluded an early Confederate offensive campaign in eastern Kentucky. In late 1861, Confederate Brig. Gen. Felix Zollicoffer guarded Cumberland Gap, the eastern end of a defensive line extending from Columbus, Kentucky. In November he advanced west into Kentucky to strengthen control in the area around Somerset and made Mill Springs his winter quarters, taking advantage of a strong defensive position. Union Brig. Gen. George H. Thomas, ordered to break up the army of Maj. Gen. George B. Crittenden (Zollicoffer's superior), sought to drive the Confederates across the Cumberland River. His force arrived at Logan's Crossroads on January 17, 1862, where he waited for Brig. Gen. Albin Schoepf's troops from Somerset to join him. The Confederate force under Crittenden attacked Thomas at Logan's Crossroads at dawn on January 19. Unbeknownst to the Confederates, some of Schoepf's troops had arrived as reinforcements. The Confederates achieved early success, but Union resistance rallied and Zollicoffer was killed. A second Confederate attack was repulsed. Union counterattacks on the Confederate right and left were successful, forcing them from the field in a retreat that ended in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Mill Springs was the first significant Union victory of the war, much celebrated in the popular press, but was soon eclipsed by Ulysses S. Grant's victories at Forts Henry and Donelson. Background In 1861 the critical border state of Kentucky had declared neutrality in the fight to maintain the Union. This neutrality was first violated on September 3, when Confederate Brig. Gen. Gideon J. Pillow, acting on orders from Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk, occupied Columbus, and two days later, Union Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant seized Paducah. Henceforth, neither adversary respected the proclaimed neutrality of the state and the Confederate advantage was lost; the buffer zone that Kentucky provided was no longer available to assist in the defense of Tennessee.Eicher, pp. 111–13. By early 1862, a single Confederate general, Albert Sidney Johnston, commanded all forces from Arkansas to the Cumberland Gap. His forces were spread thinly over a wide defensive line. His left flank was Polk in Columbus with 12,000 men. The center consisted of two forts under the command of Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman, with 4,000. Forts Henry and Donelson were the sole positions to defend the important Tennessee and Cumberland rivers, respectively. His right flank was in Kentucky, with Brig. Gen. Simon Bolivar Buckner's 4,000 men in Bowling Green, and about 4,000 in the Military District of East Tennessee under Maj. Gen. George B. Crittenden, which had the responsibility for guarding the Cumberland Gap, the gateway for entering pro- Unionist East Tennessee.Esposito, text to map 25. Crittenden's 1st Brigade was commanded by Brig. Gen. Felix Zollicoffer, whose main responsibility was to guard the Cumberland Gap. Assuming that the gap was fortified satisfactorily, in November 1861 he advanced west into Kentucky to move closer to the Confederate forces in Bowling Green and to strengthen control in the area around Somerset. The southern bank of the Cumberland River at Mill Springs was a bluff and a strong defensive position, whereas the northern bank was low and flat. Zollicoffer chose to move most of his men to the north bank where they would be closer to nearby Union troops, incorrectly assuming that it was more defensible. Both Crittenden and Albert Sidney Johnston ordered Zollicoffer to relocate south of the river, but he could not comply because he had insufficient boats to cross the unfordable river quickly and was afraid his brigade would be caught by the enemy halfway across.Eicher, p. 161; Kennedy, p. 32; Woodworth, pp. 65–66. Union Brig. Gen. George H. Thomas received orders to drive the Confederates across the Cumberland River and break up Crittenden's army. Thomas left Lebanon and slowly marched through rain-soaked country, arriving at Logan's Crossroads on January 17, where he waited for Brig. Gen. Albin F. Schoepf's troops from Somerset to join him. Crittenden, who until early January had remained in his headquarters in Knoxville, arrived at Mill Springs and realized that his inexperienced subordinate was in a dangerous situation. He devised a plan to attack the Union force before it could concentrate against him. One section of the Union Army, three brigades under Thomas, was located at Logan's Crossroads, while Schoepf's brigade was at Somerset, separated by rain-swollen Fishing Creek, which might be a sufficient barrier to prevent the forces from joining together quickly. Crittenden ordered Zollicoffer to attack the Union camp at Logan's Crossroads at dawn on January 19.Woodworth, p. 67. Opposing forcesUnionConfederate=Battle thumbupright=1.5Battle of Mill Springs, Confederate attacks Battle of Mill Springs, Union attacks The Confederate march through the night was hampered by rain and mud, and the troops arrived at Logan's Crossroads cold and miserable. Many of the men carried antique, Napoleonic-style flintlock muskets, which became almost useless in the wet weather. The slowness of the march had cost them the element of surprise. Nevertheless, they launched a spirited attack, led from the front by Zollicoffer, and achieved some initial success. The 15th Mississippi Infantry and the 20th Tennessee pushed back the (Union) 4th Kentucky Infantry, under Col. Speed S. Fry, as well as the 2nd Minnesota and 10th Indiana and some Union cavalry.Eicher, p. 162; Woodworth, pp. 67–68. In the poor visibility of the dark woods, clouded with gunsmoke, confusion reigned. Zollicoffer, who was conspicuous in front of his men with a white raincoat, mistakenly approached the Union 4th Kentucky infantry, believing they were Confederates firing on their own men. Zollicoffer was shot and killed, allegedly by Col. Fry himself.Fry is generally credited with firing the fatal shot that killed General Zollicoffer, although this has been disputed since there was also a group of Union soldier around Colonel Fry who fired at the same time. See for instance, Brown, p. 63, and Eicher, p. 162. Johnston, p. 54, states that Zollicoffer was killed by \\"a Federal officer.\\" Smith, p. 18, contends that the recognition of Fry's role was from General Thomas, but that Southern historians prefer to attribute the deaths to a volley from Fry's regiment. According to an account of Dr. D. B. Cliffe, one of Zollicoffer's surgeons, the general died from four bullets—two in the head and one each in the chest and thigh. The sudden death of their commander and heavy fire from Fry's regiment caused the center of the Confederate line to fall back momentarily in confusion. Crittenden rallied his men and ordered a general advance by Zollicoffer's brigade and the brigade of Brig. Gen. William H. Carroll.Eicher, p. 162; Kennedy, p. 32; Woodworth, p. 68. At this point, Thomas arrived on the field and ordered the 9th Ohio to advance while the 2nd Minnesota maintained heavy fire from the front line. Col. Robert L. McCook, commanding Thomas's 3rd Brigade, wrote that the lines were so close that the \\"enemy and the Second Minnesota were poking their guns through the same fence.\\" When the 9th Ohio turned the Confederate left flank, the battle was decided. The Confederate troops broke and ran back toward Mill Springs in a disorderly rout, and Crittenden, who was rumored to be drunk during the battle, was powerless to stop them. They frantically crossed to the south side of the Cumberland, abandoning twelve valuable artillery pieces, 150 wagons, more than 1,000 horses and mules, and all of their dead and wounded. The retreat continued all the way to Chestnut Mound, Tennessee, (near Carthage), about due east of Nashville.Woodworth, pp. 68–69; Hewitt, p. 43; Eicher, pp. 162–63. Aftermath Casualties were relatively light. Union losses were 39 killed and 207 wounded, Confederate 125 killed and 404 wounded or missing. Crittenden's military career was also a casualty. Accused of drunkenness and treason, his army was disbanded and he was reassigned to be a corps commander under Buckner at Bowling Green. Within two months he was relieved of his command and arrested for a subsequent episode of drunkenness.Woodworth, pp. 68–69. In October 1862, after a court of inquiry ordered by General Braxton Bragg, Crittenden resigned as a general and served without rank on the staff of Brig. Gen. John S. Williams and other officers in western Virginia for the remainder of the war.Hewitt, p. 43. The Battle of Mill Springs, along with the Battle of Middle Creek on January 10, broke the main Confederate defensive line that was anchored in eastern Kentucky.Kennedy, p. 30. Confederate fortunes in the state did not rise again until summer when Gen. Braxton Bragg and Maj. Gen. Kirby Smith launched their Kentucky Campaign, which culminated in the Battle of Perryville and Bragg's subsequent retreat. Mill Springs was the larger of the two Union Kentucky victories in January 1862. With these victories, the U.S. carried the war into Middle Tennessee in February. Battlefield today Map of Mill Springs Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. The Mill Springs battlefield is located in Pulaski County, not far from Nancy, Kentucky and also in Mill Springs in Wayne County across from the lake (Cumberland river at the time of the battle). The historic town of Mill Springs, after which the battle was named, is actually across Lake Cumberland. This section of the battlefield, in Wayne County Kentucky, still offers the only two remaining structures remaining from the actual battle. The Brown-Lanier House and the West Metcalfe house are still standing and have weekend guided tours available in the summer months. Both buildings are operated by the Mill Springs Battlefield Association. To access this portion of the battle area on the other side of the lake one must travel via Highway 90 south towards Monticello and onto Highway 1275. Portions of the battlefield in Pulaski county are preserved as a county park (named Zollicoffer Park in honor of the slain general). The Mill Springs Battlefield Association has protected portions of the battlefield by the acquisition of development rights to what is still a largely rural landscape, or by outright purchase. Zollicoffer Park contains the Confederate Cemetery, which consists of a mass grave. There is a corresponding Mill Springs National Cemetery in Nancy, where the Union dead were interred. The battlefield, which covers about , was named by the United States Secretary of the Interior as one of the top twenty-five priority battlefields and is considered a historic landmark. The Zollie Tree was the tree attributed as the place Felix Zollicoffer fell; it no longer exists, the victim of a lightning strike, but the stump is marked. The Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and its partners have acquired and preserved 685 acres at Mill Springs. American Battlefield Trust \\"Saved Land\\" webpage. Accessed May 22, 2018 On November 4, 2006, the Mill Springs Battlefield Visitors Center and Museum was officially dedicated.\\"It's Open!\\", The Zollie Tree (newsletter of the Mill Springs Battlefield Association), V. XI, No. 7, Winter 2007, p. 1. Several commemorative ceremonies are held at the battlefield each year, including candlelight tours, living history presentations, and occasional re-enactments. On January 15, 2013, Kentucky Representative Hal Rogers introduced the bill H.R. 298, officially titled \\"To direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study to evaluate the significance of the Mill Springs Battlefield located in Pulaski and Wayne Counties, Kentucky, and the feasibility of its inclusion in the National Park System, and for other purposes.\\" Rogers said that \\"the Battle of Mill Springs is a source of great pride and interest to the people I serve.\\" Rogers argued that the Battlefield was a \\"jewel\\" and would be \\"an excellent addition to the National Park Service.\\" The John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, signed into law on March 12, 2019, established the site as Mill Springs Battlefield National Monument.

BiographyEarly life= Egerton was raised in Utah, United States (U.S.) and explained his early relationship to music in a 2009 interview: \\"I was a music fanatic from the beginning of my life. Including pounding my head on the floor along with my parent's records ... which explains a lot.\\" Egerton's first significant musical influence was the Beatles, but he also grew up listening to his parents' music collection: > A lot of 50's and 60's rock and roll as a kid, and a little jazz. My mother > had good taste in music, and I grew up with a great variety. When I was 11, > a neighbor lent me Frank Zappa's Absolutely Free which sparked my interest > in \\"unusual\\" music ... opening the door for punk rock. =Music career= Egerton played drums and guitar in the punk rock/death rock band Massacre Guys. Formed in Salt Lake City, Egerton played with the Massacre Guys from 1980 to 1985 alongside bassist Karl Alvarez, with whom he grew up. Egerton explained in 2012 that he taught Alvarez how to play the bass guitar during their time in the band. In 1985 Egerton relocated to Virginia, U.S., where he studied classical guitar and played in the band Auto Da Fe, with former Iron Cross vocalist Sab Grey, Washington metropolitan area drummer Eric Wallgren, and former Black Market Baby bass player Paul Cleary. In late 1986, Egerton joined Alvarez in Descendents. In 2006 Egerton began recording for a new project named \\"40Engine,\\" alongside former All vocalist Scott Reynolds. The band released the songs \\"Sunny Disposition\\" and \\"She Has Everything\\" on the Internet in late 2007/early 2008. As part of a collaboration with guitarist Jason Crowley, called \\"Crowley/Egerton,\\" Egerton played drums and bass for songs that were made available online in 2007. Egerton formed an instrumental project called \\"Slorder,\\" and the band released its debut EP in January 2009. In 2010, Egerton released The Seven Degrees of Stephen Egerton on the Paper + Plastick label. The album features Egerton playing with a variety of vocalists, including Milo Aukerman, Joey Cape, and Mike Herrera. Two album release shows occurred in Oklahoma, U.S., during May 2010, and Slorder also performed at both shows. Egerton explained in a July 2012 interview that Descendents had transformed into a lesser responsibility for the band members, as singer Aukerman was unable to commit to a full-time band schedule at the time; furthermore, three of the four members were parents. Egerton stated that he was satisfied with the new arrangement, whereby the band played around 20 shows on an annual basis: \\"We fly in; we rock out, have fun, don’t burn it out, go home and back to normal. I love it.\\" During the surprise guest appearance of Black Flag at the 30th-anniversary Goldenvoice show—held at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in California, U.S. in December 2011—at which Descendents was the headline act, Keith Morris and Chuck Dukowski joined Bill Stevenson and Egerton to play Black Flag's first e.p., Nervous Breakdown. In January 2013, the formation of the same lineup that played Nervous Breakdown as the band FLAG was announced, with Black Flag’s third singer and one-time rhythm-guitar player Dez Cadena joining the band afterward. Prior to a September 2013 FLAG performance at Irving Plaza in New York City, U.S., Dukowski said regarding the band's formation: \\"I knew Bill [Stevenson] and Stephen [Egerton] would rage.\\" Although the backgrounds of the band's membership are diverse, FLAG solely perform \\"the songs of Black Flag.\\" Egerton recorded a guitar solo for Role Model, the 2013 album of Australian band Bodyjar. =Production career= In July 2012, Egerton explained that he was continuing to run the Armstrong Studios recording facility—based at his house in Tulsa, Oklahoma, U.S.—where he engineers, produces and mixes music: > I’m very fortunate in that my main day job is mixing and mastering records. > I do most of my work in my spare bedroom; I have a studio at home and > sometimes I record bands there but mostly I do mixing and mastering so it > works out convenient for me. I’m there all the time ... In September 2009, Egerton revealed that he enjoyed recording more than touring, as he liked the idea of music being \\"permanent,\\" and stated that, by that stage, he had been involved in the recording of \\"Probably 30 or so bands, and more than 50 projects over the last bunch of years.\\" In a 2010 interview, Russ Rankin of the American punk band Good Riddance, identified Egerton—during his time at the Blasting Room studio alongside Descendents drummer Stevenson—as a producer who \\"really understood what Good Riddance was about\\": > Also, the way they [Egerton and Stevenson] recorded … it was completely out > of the ordinary … we'd been through the culture where you'd lay down the > drums first, then you lay down the bass, then you lay down the guitars, and > then you do the vocals … and we get to the Blasting Room and once the drums > were done it was like, all bets are off … it was definitely a new approach > for us anyway, we'd never done anything like that before…so I think that > those guys really brought out the best in us, they challenged us, but they > also, I think, had a really innate sense of knowing what we were trying to > get done. Egerton and Stevenson also mixed Bodyjar’s Jarchives: 10 Years of Bodyjar compilation album. Personal life Egerton and his wife reside in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with their children, Sophie and Felix O'Reilly. Egerton explained in 2012 that he chose Tulsa so that his children could be near to his wife's parents, and in 2009 he also mentioned the \\"inexpensive\\" cost of living in the city. Egerton provided a brief insight into his daily schedule in 2012: > I’m the guy that takes [the kids] to the bus, my wife’s job is set hours, I > have complete flexibility in my schedule. I live a mile from school, if I > need to take care of something I do. I really like it because my Mom had to > work and my Dad was gone, so to be there for them [the kids] feels good. Egerton's wife is originally from Perth, Australia.

It was located east of Sacramento, on the south side of U.S. Route 50 in Sacramento County, California. Mather Field was one of 32 Air Service training camps established after the United States entry into World War I in April 1917.William R. Evinger: Directory of Military Bases in the U.S., Oryx Press, Phoenix, Ariz., 1991, p. 147. The Mather AFB land has various post-military uses including Sacramento Mather Airport, established in 1995. Some of the land was included in the City of Rancho Cordova, when it was incorporated in 2003. History Mather Air Force Base was named after Second Lieutenant Carl Spencer Mather, a 25-year-old army pilot killed in a mid-air collision while training at Ellington Field, Texas on 30 January 1918. Mather learned to fly in 1914 at the Curtiss Flying School in Hammondsport, New York, and became an instructor there at the age of 20. He enlisted as an aviation cadet in August 1917 and as a licensed pilot was commissioned with part of his class as a second lieutenant on 20 January 1918. He continued training to earn a Reserve Military Aviator rating and promotion to first lieutenant but was killed ten days later. The remainder of his class requested that Mills Field be renamed in Mather's honor. =World War I= In January 1918, the Department of War sent a cadre of officers to the Sacramento, California area to survey sites for an aviation school. The group decided on a location about 12 miles southeast of Sacramento called Mills Station. An agreement to lease the land to the Army was concluded, and the construction of some 50 buildings began on 15 March 1918. Mills Field, named after the local community was opened on 30 April 1918. It covered over 700 acres and could accommodate up to 1,000 personnel. Dozens of wooden buildings served as headquarters, maintenance, and officers’ quarters. Enlisted men had to bivouac in tents. Mather Field's first commander was 1st Lieutenant Sam P. Burman, who assumed command on 15 March 1918. The first unit stationed there was the 283d Aero Squadron, which was transferred from Rockwell Field, North Island, California.Special Collections of the Sacramento Public Library, Mather Field, Images of America, Arcadia Publishing (9 January 2012), Flight training 2d L. Carl Spencer Mather Only a few U.S. Army Air Service aircraft arrived with the 283d Aero Squadron, Most of the Curtiss JN-4 Jennys to be used for flight training were shipped in wooden crates by rail. Mather Field served as a base for primary flight training with an eight-week course. The maximum student capacity was 300. In 1917, flight training occurred in two phases: primary and advanced. Primary training consisted of pilots learning basic flight skills under dual and solo instruction. After completion of their primary training at Mather, flight cadets were then transferred to another base for advanced training. Training units assigned to Mather Field:Order of Battle of the United States Land Forces in the First World War, Volume 3, Part 3, Center of Military History, United States Army, 1949 (1988 Reprint) * Post Headquarters, Mather Field April 1918-November 1919 * 200th Aero Squadron, June 1918–November 1918 (redesignated as Squadron A, Mather Field July 1918) * 201st Aero Squadron, June 1918–November 1918 (redesignated as Squadron B, Mather Field July 1918) * 283d Aero Squadron (II), April 1918–November 1918 (redesignated as Squadron C, Mather Field July 1918) * 294th Aero Squadron (II), June 1918–November 1918 (redesignated as Squadron D, Mather Field July 1918) * Squadron E, Mather Field July 1918-November 1918 * Flying School Detachment (Consolidation of Squadrons A-E), November 1918-October 1919 With the sudden end of World War I in November 1918, the future operational status of Mather Field was unknown. Many local officials speculated that the U.S. government would keep the field open because of the outstanding combat record established by Mather-trained pilots in Europe. Locals also pointed to the optimal weather conditions in the Sacramento area for flight training. Cadets in flight training on 11 November 1918 were allowed to complete their training, however no new cadets were assigned to the base. The separate training squadrons were consolidated into a single Flying School detachment, because many of the personnel at Mather were being demobilized. Flight training activities finally ceased on 8 November 1919. = Inter-war years = With the end of World War I, in December 1919 Mather Field was closed as an active airfield. However, a small caretaker unit was assigned to the facility for administration. Nonetheless, on 13 December 1919, the United States House of Representatives passed an appropriations bill for $9.6 million for the purchase of additional land at military camps “which are to be made part of the permanent military establishment.” Mather Field was allocated $78,000 of this amount.United Press, “House Passes Bill To Buy March Field,” Riverside Daily Press, Riverside, California, Saturday evening, 13 December 1919, Volume XXXIV, Number 269, page 8. Mather was used by the aerial forestry patrol. It also was used intermittently to support small military units. However, with the return to a peacetime economy, Mather Field were deemed unnecessary as a military training facility, and it was closed on 12 May 1923. The War Department ordered the small caretaker force at Mather Field to dismantle all remaining structures and to sell them as surplus. Throughout the remainder of the 1920s, the War Department leased the vacant land to local farmers and ranchers. Mather Field was reactivated on 1 April 1930 as a sub post of the Presidio of San Francisco and Hamilton Field during the 1930s, and of Stockton Field briefly in 1941. Mather, however, had to be refitted with new electrical, water, and telephone lines. Soon, Mather was again alive with activity, though the renovation process could not compare to the original base construction. Note: The airfield served only for aerial forest patrol, beginning 8 January 1919. It was placed on inactive status, 22 June 1922; and closed on 12 May 1923. The airfield was reactivated 1 April 1930; and placed in inactive status, 1 November 1932. It was designated a subpost of the Presidio of San Francisco, unk-13 May 1935; designated a subpost of Hamilton Field, 13 May 1935; designated a subpost of Stockton Field, 21 February 1941. =World War II= A Cessna AT-17 Bobcat at the base, 9 May 1942 The Field was reestablished as a separate post and activated on 13 May 1941. The field area was increased from 872 to in June 1941. Sub-bases and auxiliary fields of Mather included: * Concord Army Air Field * Franklin Auxiliary Airfield (Aux 1) * Lincoln Auxiliary Airfield (Aux 2) * Winter-Davis Flight Strip (Aux 4) * Elk Grove Auxiliary Airfield (Aux 5) In 1941 Mather Field became the site for advanced navigator training. The Army Air Forces Navigator School began operating on 2 August 1941. Major new construction was completed 16 March 1942. The school consisted of a rigorous 18-week course consisting of instruction in celestial navigation and dead reckoning. To complete the course, cadets were required to spend 100 hours navigating during both local and long-range flights. However, in 1943, Army Air Forces Training Command transferred the Navigator School from Mather Field to Ellington Field, near Houston, Texas. Mather became a twin-engine Advanced Flying School, training pilots on North American B-25 Mitchell medium bombers. In 1944–45 it became an aerial port of embarkation to the Pacific in preparation for the expected transfer of large numbers of men and aircraft from Europe to the Pacific. During the summer of 1945, the 509th Composite Group was transferring from its Second Air Force training base at Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, the group landed at Mather prior to embarking on its trans-Pacific movement to Tinian (in the Marianas Island chain). Due to the extraordinary security of the unit because of its atomic mission, the commanding general of Mather Field was told at gunpoint that he was not allowed on board the B-29 The Great Artiste, which had landed there. =Cold War=Air Training Command Main Gate, about 1955 During the Cold War, Mather AFB became the sole aerial navigation school for the United States Air Force after its companion navigation schools at Harlingen Air Force Base, Texas, and James Connally Air Force Base, Texas, were closed and Ellington Air Force Base was converted into a joint Air National Guard Base, Coast Guard Air Station and NASA flight facility in the 1960s. The 3535th Navigator Training Wing of Air Training Command (ATC), was responsible for bombardier training beginning in 1946 and later transitioned to undergraduate navigator training (UNT), advanced navigator bombardier training, electronic warfare officer training and weapon systems officer training after the closure of the other navigator training bases. Renamed the 3535th Flying Training Wing, the wing initially flew the Convair T-29 for Air Force navigator training until the early 1970s, when it was replaced by the Boeing T-43A (Boeing 737-200) aircraft. The 3535th was replaced by the 323d Flying Training Wing on 1 April 1973. In 1976, following the decommissioning of Training Squadron Twenty-Nine (VT-29) at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, Texas, the 323d began training student Naval Flight Officers in the Advanced Maritime Navigation training pipeline. Navy students in this pipeline were destined to fly land-based naval aircraft such as the Lockheed P-3 Orion, Lockheed EP-3 Aries and Lockheed EC-130 and Lockheed LC-130 Hercules aircraft. This resulted in the UNT course being redesignated as Interservice Undergraduate Navigator Training (IUNT). The Navy also activated Naval Air Training Unit (NAVAIRTU) Mather as the parent activity for United States Navy instructors, USN students and NATO/Allied naval aviation students assigned to the 323d at Mather. The Marine Aerial Navigation School also relocated to Mather in order to train enlisted United States Marine Corps and United States Coast Guard navigators for Marine Corps KC-130 and Coast Guard HC-130 aircraft. Cessna T-37 aircraft were added to the IUNT curriculum in the late 1970s for USAF students destined for high performance aircraft such as the F-4 Phantom II/RF-4, F-111/FB-111 and B-1 Lancer. The 323d continued training USAF navigators, Naval Flight Officers, NATO/Allied students, and conducting advanced training for radar navigator/bombardiers, electronic warfare officers and weapons systems operators until it was inactivated on 30 September 1993. Concurrent with the wing's inactivation, all USAF Navigator and Naval Flight Officer maritime navigation pipeline training was moved to Randolph Air Force Base, Texas and consolidated under the 12th Flying Training Wing, which up until that time trained and certified instructor pilots. Radar stations Mather AFB had a late 1940s/early 1950s Radar Bomb Scoring detachment of the 3903rd Radar Bomb Scoring Squadron. The Mather AFB general surveillance radar station was established after a second stage of \\"additional Lashup stations and heavy radar equipment [was] authorized\\" in the fall of 1949. Site L-37 began operation with an AN/CPS-6 in June 1950, and the 668th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was assigned on 1 January 1951 . The station later converted to AN/FPS-20A and AN/FPS-6 and AN/FPS-6B radars. By 1960 the station became a joint-use facility with the Federal Aviation Administration and in 1961, the two height-finder radars were removed. The station became part of the San Francisco Air Defense Sector with the radars providing radar data to the Beale Air Force Base DC-18 SAGE Direction Center via the Burroughs AN/FST-2 Coordinate Data Transmitting Set at Mill Valley Air Force Station (Z-28). The 668th was inactivated on 1 September 1961, and Detachment 2 of the 666th Radar Squadron performed subsequent operations until inactivated on 1 September 1966. The FAA operates the Mather radar site with an AN/FPS-91A of the Joint Surveillance System. Strategic Air Command Mather AFB Control Tower, 1986 On 1 April 1958, the Strategic Air Command (SAC)'s 4134th Strategic Wing composed of the 72d Bombardment Squadron and 904th Air Refueling Squadron was assigned to Mather AFB, the latter flying the KC-135A Stratotanker. The Strategic Wings were formed in the late 1950s as part of SAC's plan to disperse its heavy bombers over a larger number of bases, thus making it more difficult for the Soviet Union to knock out the entire fleet with a surprise first strike. The wing had one squadron of B-52 Stratofortresses with 15 aircraft. Half of the planes were maintained on 15-minute alert, fully fueled, armed, and ready for combat. The remaining planes were used for training in bombardment missions and air refueling operations. The wing also had a squadron of KC-135 tankers. The 4134th Strategic Wing was discontinued on 1 February 1963. Det. 1 320 BW operated at the old bomber alert area at Mt. Home AFB, from 1969 until the spring of 1975 when it disbanded and the two bombers and two tankers returned to Mather. Concurrent with the inactivation of the 4134th, the 320th Bombardment Wing was activated and absorbed its assets. It operated as a tenant unit from 1963 to 1989, initially with the B-52F Stratofortress before converting in 1968 to the B-52G. The 441st Bombardment Squadron replaced the 72d and the 904th Air Refueling Squadron was transferred from the 4134th to the 320th.. In addition to SAC nuclear alert, the 320th also conducted conventional operations, including maritime missions in support of the Navy with aerial mines and AGM-84 Harpoon missiles. The 320th was inactivated on 30 September 1989.320th Air Expeditionary Wing#320th Bombardment Wing (Cold War) The 940th Air Refueling Group, an Air Force Reserve unit, moved to Mather AFB from McClellan Air Force Base in 1977, shortly after it transitioned to the KC-135A. Operationally-gained by SAC, the unit upgraded to the KC-135E in 1986. With SAC's inactivation in 1992, the unit was then gained by the Air Mobility Command and redesignated the 940th Air Refueling Wing in 1993. Following the closure of Mather AFB, the 940th relocated back to McClellan AFB in 1993. When McClellan closed in 1998 the wing then moved to its current station at Beale Air Force Base.940th Air Refueling Wing =Closure= Emblem of the 3535th Navigator Training Wing (ATC) Emblem of the 4134th Strategic Wing Emblem of the 320th Bombardment Wing Parts of the airfield were listed on the National Priorities List as a Superfund site on 22 July 1987. The entire site was listed on 21 November 1989. On 30 September 1993, the , including 129 acres (522,000 m²) of easements, of Mather AFB was decommissioned under the 1988 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. Most of the base was transferred to Sacramento County, California.

This colourless, sharp-smelling liquid, the diacyl chloride of oxalic acid, is a useful reagent in organic synthesis. Preparation Oxalyl chloride was first prepared in 1892 by the French chemist Adrien Fauconnier, who reacted diethyl oxalate with phosphorus pentachloride. It can also be prepared by treating oxalic acid with phosphorus pentachloride. Oxalyl chloride is produced commercially from ethylene carbonate. Photochlorination gives the tetrachloride, which is subsequently degraded: :C2H4O2CO + 4 Cl2 → C2Cl4O2CO + 4 HCl :C2Cl4O2CO → C2O2Cl2 \\\\+ COCl2 Reactions Oxalyl chloride reacts with water giving off gaseous products only: hydrogen chloride (HCl), carbon dioxide (CO2), and carbon monoxide (CO). : In this, it is quite different from other acyl chlorides which hydrolyze with formation of hydrogen chloride and the original carboxylic acid. Applications in organic synthesisOxidation of alcohols= The solution comprising DMSO and oxalyl chloride, followed by quenching with triethylamine converts alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes and ketones via the process known as the Swern oxidation. =Synthesis of acyl chlorides= Oxalyl chloride is mainly used together with a N,N-dimethylformamide catalyst in organic synthesis for the preparation of acyl chlorides from the corresponding carboxylic acids. Like thionyl chloride, the reagent degrades into volatile side products in this application, which simplifies workup. One of the minor byproducts from the N,N-dimethylformamide catalyzed reaction is a potent carcinogen, stemming from the N,N-dimethylformamide decomposition. Relative to thionyl chloride, oxalyl chloride tends to be a milder, more selective reagent. It is also more expensive than thionyl chloride so it tends to be used on a smaller scale. :400px This reaction involves conversion of DMF to the imidoyl chloride derivative (Me2N=CHCl+), akin to the first stage in the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction. The imidoyl chloride is the active chlorinating agent. =Formylation of arenes= Oxalyl chloride reacts with aromatic compounds in the presence of aluminium chloride to give the corresponding acyl chloride in a process known as a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The resulting acyl chloride can be hydrolysed to form the corresponding carboxylic acid. =Preparation of oxalate diesters= Like other acyl chlorides, oxalyl chloride reacts with alcohols to give esters: : Typically, such reactions are conducted in the presence of a base such as pyridine. The diester derived from phenol, phenyl oxalate ester, is Cyalume, the active ingredient in glow sticks. =Other= Oxalyl chloride was reportedly used in the first synthesis of dioxane tetraketone (C4O6), an oxide of carbon. Precautions In March 2000, a Malaysia Airlines Airbus A330-300 was damaged beyond repair after a cargo of prohibited oxalyl chloride (falsely declared as hydroxyquinoline) leaked into the cargo bay. It is toxic by inhalation, although it is over an order of magnitude less acutely toxic than the related compound phosgene.

She joined the circle of de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre. In de Beauvoir's first novel L'Invitée, she and her sister, Wanda, were fused together to make the character of the younger friend Xavière, to form with the actress Françoise and the actor, director Pierre a ménage à trois.She Came to Stay, 1943), which was dedicated to Olga (where her name appears as Kosakievicz in the Norton translation). Olga, along with Bianca Lamblin and Natalie Sorokin, later stated that their \\"trio\\" relationships with Sartre and de Beauvoir damaged them psychologically.Rogers, Nigel * Mel Thompson, Philosophers Behaving Badly (2004), London, UK, Peter Owen Publishers. A motivation of Sartre to write the play The Flies, was to give Olga Kosakiewicz an Opportunity for a debut as a theater actress. The Flies should be premiered at the Comédie-Française, but the Intendant Jean- Louis Barrault did not agree in Satre's condition that Olga Kosakiewicz should assume the role of Electra. So it was premiered on June 3, 1943 at the (aka Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt). In 1946 in Simone de Beauvoir's unique Drama Les Bouches inutiles she played Clarice the daughter of Catherine and Louis d'Avesnes the main characters. In Sartre's trilogy of novels, Les Chemins de la Liberté (The Roads to Freedom), the character of Ivich is considered a representation of Olga. Deirdre Bair's biography of Simone de Beauvoir examines this relationship. Hazel Rowley also discusses it at length in her book about the relationship between Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre. In 1946 Olga married Jacques-Laurent Bost, a long-time lover of de Beauvoir. She died of tuberculosis in 1983.

He was a significant scholar in the Calvinist tradition, alongside Abraham Kuyper and B. B. Warfield. BiographyBackground= Bavinck was born in the town of Hoogeveen in the Netherlands to a German father, Jan Bavinck (1826-1909) who was the minister of theologically conservative, ecclesiastically separatist Christian Reformed Church (Christelijke Gereformeerde Kerk). After his high school education, Bavinck first went to the Theological School in Kampen in 1873, but then moved on to Leiden for further training after one year in Kampen. He wrote in his student journal notes that the reason made him to transfer his studies was because he was motived by the preaching of the pastor Johannes Hendricus Donner, who was also ministering in Leiden by that time. He studied under prominent faculties such as Johannes Scholten and Abraham Kuenen, and finally graduated in 1880 from the University of Leiden having completed a dissertation on the ethics of Ulrich Zwingli. A year later, Bavinck was appointed Professor of Dogmatics at Theological School in Kampen. While serving there, he also assisted his denomination that had formed out of the withdrawal of orthodox Calvinists earlier from the state Hervormde Kerk, a withdrawal movement called the \\"Afscheiding\\" (Secession) in its merger with a second and subsequent larger breakaway movement that also left the Hervormde Kerk, this time under the leadership of Abraham Kuyper, a movement called the \\"Doleantie\\" (the Complaint: a historical reference to the term used by orthodox Reformed ministers who opposed Arminianism prior to the National Synod of Dordt, 1618–19). The now-united Church combined the \\"Afgescheidenen\\" and \\"Dolerenden\\" into the Gereformeerde Kerken in Nederland (GKiN). As a result of the merger, GKiN inherited the denominational seminary of the Afscheiding churches and that seminary became the denominational seminary of the GKiN, where Bavinck stayed put, so as to ease the transition of his colleagues and people within the much larger new Church. Already, when the Afgescheidenen merged with the Dolerenden, there was a minority of the Seceders who stayed out of the union; they formed their new denomination as the Christelijke Gereformeerde Kerken (CGK), and they established their own theological seminary in the town of Apeldoorn. =Move to Amsterdam= Amidst all these developments, Bavinck stayed put and pursued his class lectures, research, writing, and publication - making his distinctive mark as an orthodox Calvinist theologian and churchman. The recently founded Free University in Amsterdam (VU), under the leadership of Abraham Kuyper, was meant to be a bastion of Reformed learning in all fields of thought. The Free University including its Theology Faculty for training clergy, unlike Kampen Seminary, was independent of both the state and all church denominations. But, of course, theology was the VU's initial leading concern for some decades. So, Bavinck, when he was first invited to join the VU Faculty, had to weigh the merits of teaching what concerned him in his theological research, in such a seemingly independent environment. With Kuyper in the same faculty, he might have come to feel quite crowded. After refusing the invitation of Abraham Kuyper several times to come to Amsterdam, finally Bavinck accepted Kuyper's plea. In 1902 he succeeded Abraham Kuyper as Professor of Theology at the Free University in Amsterdam. Kuyper himself had developed other workloads, and simply wanted the best man available to replace himself. Thus, Bavinck moved to the big city, with his first edition of multi-volume Gereformeerde Dogmatiek already in publication. He arrived well-credentialed and well- respected. He remained at VU for the remainder of his teaching career. In 1906 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1911, he was named to the Senate of the Netherlands Parliament. He assisted in the encouragement of the Gereformeerde people to build their own Christian schools, without state financial help, until such a time as the 80-years \\"School War\\" was brought to an end by the granting of government assistance to all schools. In 1908 he visited the United States and gave the Stone Lectures at Princeton Theological Seminary. =Bavinck and Kuyper= Inevitably he has been compared with his contemporary Abraham Kuyper. J. H. Landwehr, Bavinck's first biographer, had this to say of the two: \\"Bavinck was an Aristotelian, Kuyper had a Platonic spirit. Bavinck was the man of clear concept, Kuyper the man of the fecund idea. Bavinck worked with the historically given; Kuyper proceeded speculatively by way of intuition. Bavinck's was primarily an inductive mind; Kuyper's primarily deductive.\\" One major difference in ideas between Bavinck and Kuyper is formulated largely in theological terms contrasting a doctrine called \\"Common Grace\\" with a doctrine called \\"the Antithesis.\\" Bavinck emphasized Common Grace, while Kuyper emphasized (sometimes severely) the Antithesis. A comparison of the two positions, which came to designate two interwoven and contentious traditions in the GKiN and the Neo-Calvinist Christian social movements that flowed from its membership, is presented in Jacob Klapwijk's important work of Reformational philosophy, entitled Bringing into Captivity Every Thought (English, 1986). TheologyBavinck's Doctrine of Revelation= Bavinck sensed the open question caused by the subjectivistic tendency of Friedrich Schleiermacher's doctrine of revelation. Deeply concerned with the problem of objectivism and subjectivism in the doctrine of revelation, he employed Schleiermacher’s doctrine of revelation in his own way and regarded the Bible as the objective standard for his theological work. Bavinck also stressed the importance of the church, which forms the Christian consciousness and experience.

Early life Gilbert was born in Zanesville, Ohio. He graduated from West Point in the famed Class of 1846, finishing 21st out of 59 students.Eicher, p. 598. His classmates included twenty future Civil War generals, including George B. McClellan, Stonewall Jackson, George Stoneman, Darius N. Couch, and George Pickett. During the Mexican–American War he served in the 3rd U.S. Infantry and 1st U.S. Infantry and fought at Veracruz and Mexico City. Then he served in Texas for two years. Returning to West Point in 1850 as the Assistant Professor of Geography, History and Ethics he was promoted to first lieutenant on June 10, 1850. In 1855, now a captain in the 1st Infantry, he returned to Texas for frontier duty and Indian fighting. He was also the first member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity chapter at Ohio University (Beta Kappa). Civil WarEarly service= When the Civil War started, Gilbert commanded the post of Fort Cobb, Oklahoma. Gilbert rejoined the regiment and fought in the Battle of Wilson's Creek, where he was wounded. He was appointed Inspector General in the Army of the Ohio during the Battle of Shiloh and the Siege of Corinth. =Promotion to Major General= During the Confederate Heartland Offensive, Maj. Gen. William \\"Bull\\" Nelson was wounded in the battle of Richmond and his Army of Kentucky severely mauled. Department commander Horatio G. Wright needed to select a replacement for the wounded Nelson and the two ranking officers, Generals Charles Cruft and James S. Jackson, refused the promotion.Bragg's Kentucky Invasion Therefore, at the recommendation of both Cruft and Jackson,Official Records Wright promoted Gilbert to fill the vacancy, and Gilbert was elevated to acting major general pending the approval of the president.Wright's Official Report Several days later, on September 9, President Abraham Lincoln promoted Gilbert to brigadier general of U.S. Volunteers.Noe, p. 84. Wright's promotion to acting Major General, however, gave Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell enough leverage to appoint Gilbert to a corps command in his Army of the Ohio over such generals as Jeremiah T. Boyle, Jefferson C. Davis, and Albin F. Schoepf. Buell later denied knowing Gilbert had not actually received an official appointment.Noe p.97 =Perryville= Proudly wearing two stars in his shoulders, Gilbert was temporarily placed in command of the corps-sized Army of Kentucky in the absence of Nelson. About the time Nelson was well enough to resume command he was murdered in Louisville. When the Army of Kentucky was assimilated into the Army of the Ohio it was redesignated as its III Provisional Corps, and Gilbert retained the command.Noe, pp. 83, 97. A week later, Gilbert was engaged in the Battle of Perryville. His troops were successful in checking the last of the Confederate attacks and driving a Confederate brigade back through Perryville, but Gilbert was criticized for his slow action in battle and he was widely despised by the men in his corps for his actions as a martinet.Noe, p. 98. Gilbert's appointment to brigadier general was not confirmed by the Senate and it expired on March 4, 1863. Some officers in the Army, including Buell's Chief of Staff James B. Fry, were surprised to find out Gilbert had not officially been promoted to major general.Official Records Testimony of General Mitchell Leaving the Volunteer service and returning to the regular army he was appointed Major in the 19th U.S. Infantry. He also was brevetted as lieutenant colonel and colonel. =Later assignments= Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans took command of the Army of the Ohio and the subsequent reorganization as the Army of the Cumberland left Gilbert without a permanent command. He commanded the 10th (Provisional) Division in Tennessee at the Battle of Harpeth River. In July 1863 he was assigned to the East on administrative duty, serving as Assistant Provost Marshal General and Chief Mustering Officer in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and later Hartford, Connecticut, for the remainder of the war. Postbellum career Gilbert served on the frontier serving in the 28th U.S. Infantry and 7th U.S. Infantry Regiments. When he retired in 1886 he was the Commanding Officer of the 17th U.S. Infantry with the rank of colonel. He died in Baltimore, Maryland on January 17, 1903; and was buried in Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky. He was the brother of Union Brig. Gen. Samuel A. Gilbert and uncle to Samuel's son Cass Gilbert. See also * List of American Civil War generals (Union) NotesReferences * Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher. Civil War High Commands.

It received widespread publicity after paranormalist Lloyd Pye claimed it was of extraterrestrial origin.  Claims of Lloyd Pye  Pye claimed to have obtained the skull from Ray and Melanie Young of El Paso, Texas, in February 1999, stating that the skull was found around 1930 in a mine tunnel about 100 miles (160 km) southwest of Chihuahua, Mexico, buried alongside a normal human skeleton that was exposed and lying supine on the surface of the tunnel. Pye claimed the skull to be a hybrid offspring of an extraterrestrial and a human female.  Assessment of the evidence  A dentist who examined the upper right maxilla found with the skull determined that the skull was that of a child aged 4.5 to 5 years. The volume, however, of the interior of the Starchild skull is 1,600 cubic centimeters, which is 200 cm³ larger than the average adult's brain, and 400 cm³ larger than an adult of the same approximate size. The orbits are oval and shallow, with the optic nerve canal situated closer to the bottom of the orbit than to the back. There are no frontal sinuses. The back of the skull is flattened. The skull consists of calcium hydroxyapatite, the normal material of mammalian bone. Neurologist Steven Novella of Yale University Medical School says that the cranium exhibits all of the characteristics of a child who has died as a result of congenital hydrocephalus, and the cranial deformations were the result of accumulations of cerebrospinal fluid within the skull. DNA testing in 1999 at BOLD (Bureau of Legal Dentistry), a forensic DNA lab in Vancouver, British Columbia, found standard X and Y chromosomes in two samples taken from the skull. Novella considers this \\"conclusive evidence\\" that the child was both male and human, and that both of his parents must have been human in order for each to have contributed one of the human sex chromosomes. Further DNA testing in 2003 at Trace Genetics, which specializes in extracting DNA from ancient samples, isolated mitochondrial DNA from both recovered skulls. The child belongs to haplogroup C. Since mitochondrial DNA is inherited exclusively from the mother, it makes it possible to trace the offspring's maternal lineage. The DNA test therefore confirmed that the child's mother was a Haplogroup C human female. However, the adult female found with the child belonged to haplogroup A. Both haplotypes are characteristic Native American haplogroups, but the different haplogroup for each skull indicates that the adult female was not the child's mother. Paranormal researcher Ben Radford states that often \\"anything not immediately explainable or obvious is interpreted as a baffling mystery, often with paranormal connotations. ... Science fiction speculation is fun but should not eclipse the real science and significance of these stories\\". Hydrocephalus-baby.jpgYoung children with hydrocephalus typically have an abnormally large head, as fluid pressure causes individual skull bones to bulge outward.

The film was made by Gainsborough Pictures at their Islington studios. Downhill was Hitchcock's fourth film as director, but the fifth to be released. Its American alternative title for was When Boys Leave Home.  Plot  At an expensive English boarding school for boys, Roddy Berwick (Ivor Novello) is School Captain and star rugby player. He and his best friend Tim Wakely (Robin Irvine) start seeing a waitress Mabel (Annette Benson). Out of pique, she tells the headmaster that she is pregnant and that Roddy is the father. In fact it was Tim, who cannot afford to be expelled because he needs to win a scholarship to attend Oxford University. Promising Tim that he will never reveal the truth, Roddy accepts expulsion. Returning to his parents’ home, he finds that his father Sir Thomas Berwick (Norman McKinnel) believes him guilty of the false accusation. Leaving home, Roddy finds work as an actor in a theatre. He marries the leading actress Julia Fotheringale (Isabel Jeans) after inheriting £30,000 from a relation. The unfaithful Julia secretly continues an affair with her leading man Archie (Ian Hunter) and discards Roddy after his inheritance is exhausted. He becomes a gigolo in a Paris music hall but soon quits over self-loathing at romancing older women for money. Roddy ends up alone and delirious in a shabby room in Marseilles. Some sailors take pity on him and ship him back home, possibly hoping for reward. Roddy's father has learned the truth about the waitress's false accusation during his son's absence and joyfully welcomes him back. Roddy resumes his previous life. Cast * Ivor Novello as Roddy Berwick * Ben Webster as Dr. Dawson * Norman McKinnel as Sir Thomas Berwick * Robin Irvine as Tim Wakely * Jerrold Robertshaw as Reverend Henry Wakely * Sybil Rhoda as Sybil Wakely * Annette Benson as Mabel * Lilian Braithwaite as Lady Berwick * Isabel Jeans as Julia Fotheringale * Ian Hunter as Archie * Hannah Jones as The Dressmaker * Barbara Gott as Madame Michet * Violet Farebrother as The Poet * Alf Goddard as The Swede * J. Nelson as Hibbert Production The film is based on the play, Down Hill, written by its star Ivor Novello and Constance Collier under the combined alias David L'Estrange. The stage performance had a short run in the West End and longer in the provinces. In the play Novello thrilled his female fans by washing his bare legs after the rugby match. An appreciative James Agate, drama critic for the London Sunday Times, wrote \\"The scent of good honest soap crosses the footlights\\". Hitchcock included a similar scene of Novello for the film in which he is shown naked from the waist up. Hitchcock's emerging style is well demonstrated in this film. He used a variety of screen techniques to tell the story with a minimum of title cards, preferring instead to allow the film's visual narrative tell the story. A good example is the scene after Roddy leaves home. It opens with the title card \\"The world of make-believe\\". This is followed by a closeup of Roddy in a tuxedo. The camera pulls back to reveal Roddy is actually playing a waiter on stage in a theatre. Hitchcock also incorporated shots of a descending escalator at Maida Vale tube station as a visual metaphor for Roddy's downhill descent. He experimented with dream sequences by shooting them in superimpositions and blurred images. He played with shadow and light in much the same way as directors of German expressionist films of the time. Original prints of the film were colour tinted, for instance the scene involving Novello's voyage home on a boat was a \\"sickly\\" green to express mental torment and nausea. Preservation and home video status A fully tinted restoration of Downhill was completed in 2012 as part of the BFI's £2 million \\"Save the Hitchcock 9\\" project to restore all of the director's surviving silent films. Like Hitchcock's other British films, all of which are copyrighted worldwide, Downhill has been heavily bootlegged on home video. Despite this, various licensed, restored releases have appeared on DVD, Blu- ray and video on demand from the Network imprint in the UK as well as Criterion in the U.S. ReferencesExternal links  * Alfred Hitchcock Collectors’ Guide: Downhill at Brenton Film Category:1927 films Category:Films directed by Alfred Hitchcock Category:British black-and-white films Category:British films Category:1927 drama films Category:British silent feature films Category:British drama films Category:Films set in London Category:Films set in England Category:Films set in France Category:Gainsborough Pictures films Category:British films based on plays ","title":"Downhill (1927 film)"},{"id":"1619883","text":"Map of Middle Creek Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. The Battle of Middle Creek was an engagement fought January 10, 1862, in Eastern Kentucky during the American Civil War. Background More than 1 a month after Confederate Colonel John S. Williams left Kentucky, following the fight at Ivy Mountain, Brig. Gen. Humphrey Marshall led another force into Eastern Kentucky to continue recruiting activities. From his headquarters in Paintsville, on the Levisa Fork of the Big Sandy River, northwest of Prestonsburg, Marshall recruited volunteers. He raised a force of more than 2,000 men by early January, but could only partially equip them. Battle Union Brig. Gen. Don Carlos Buell directed Col. James A. Garfield to force Marshall to retreat back into Virginia. Leaving Louisa, Garfield took command of the 18th Brigade and began his march south on Paintsville. He compelled the Confederates to abandon Paintsville and retreat to the vicinity of Prestonsburg. Garfield slowly headed south, but swampy areas and numerous streams slowed his movements, and he arrived in the vicinity of Marshall on the 9th. Heading out at 4:00 a.m. on January 10, Garfield marched a mile west near the Forks of Middle Creek, fought off the Confederate cavalry, and turned west to attack Marshall. Marshall had put his men in line of battle north and east of the creek near its forks. Garfield attacked shortly after noon, and the fighting continued for most of the afternoon until Union reinforcements arrived in time to dissuade the Confederates from assailing the Federal left. Instead, the Confederates retired south and were ordered back to Virginia on January 24. Garfield's force moved to Prestonsburg after the fight and then retired to Paintsville. Union forces had halted the Confederate 1861 offensive in Kentucky, and Middle Creek demonstrated that their strength had not diminished. Aftermath The Battle of Middle Creek, along with the Battle of Mill Springs a little more than a week later, cemented Union control of Eastern Kentucky until Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg launched his offensive in the summer and fall of 1862. Following these two January victories in Kentucky, the Federals carried the war into Tennessee in February. In October 1992, the battlefield was designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service.Middle Creek Battlefield , National Park Service, n.d. Accessed 2014-04-09.

With around fifty players, it is the only one of the five BBC orchestras which is not a full- scale symphony orchestra. The BBC Concert Orchestra is the BBC's most populist ensemble, playing a mixture of classical music, light music and popular numbers. Its primary role is to produce music for radio broadcast, and it is the resident orchestra of the world's longest running live music programme, Friday Night is Music Night on BBC Radio 2. History The parent ensemble of the orchestra was the BBC Theatre Orchestra, which was formed in 1931 and based in Bedford. The orchestra also did opera work and was occasionally billed as the BBC Opera Orchestra. Stanford Robinson was the principal conductor from 1931 until 1946, but others included Walter Goehr, Spike Hughes, Harold Lowe and Mark Lubbock. In August 1949, the ensemble was formally renamed the BBC Opera Orchestra. In January 1952, the BBC Opera Orchestra was disbanded and the BBC Concert Orchestra was formed from its players. Until 1972, the orchestra was based at the Camden Theatre. From 1972 to 2004, the orchestra performed regularly at the Golders Green Hippodrome. It also appears regularly at the Royal Festival Hall and The Proms in London, as well as venues around the United Kingdom. As well as its performances on BBC Radio 2, it also performs on BBC Radio 3 and the BBC Proms and was a core part of the BBC's Electric Proms, now discontinued. As well as light classical music, it also plays pop music, jazz, opera, operetta and much of the popular repertoire previously the mainstay of the disbanded BBC Radio Orchestra. It links, from time to time, with the BBC Big Band for concerts and broadcasts. Gilbert Vinter served as its first principal conductor. Barry Wordsworth, principal conductor from 1989 to 2006, now holds the title of Conductor Laureate. In August 2010, the orchestra announced the simultaneous appointments of Keith Lockhart as its seventh principal conductor, with immediate effect, and of Johannes Wildner as principal guest conductor. Lockhart concluded his principal conductorship of the orchestra at the end of 2017, and now has the title of chief guest conductor, effective January 2018. In November 2017, the orchestra announced the appointment of Bramwell Tovey as its next principal conductor, effective January 2018, with an initial contract of five years. In November 2019, the BBC CO announced the appointment of Anna- Maria Helsing as its next principal guest conductor, the first female conductor ever named to the post, and the third female conductor to be named to a titled post with a BBC orchestra. Composers who have been affiliated with the orchestra have included Anne Dudley and Jonny Greenwood, who was named the orchestra's composer-in-association in 2004. In January 2013, the orchestra announced the appointment of Guy Barker as its new Associate Composer, replacing Greenwood, with an initial contract of two years. In 2017, Dobrinka Tabakova was appointed as the BBC CO's new Composer-in-Residence. The orchestra has recorded commercially for the NMC Recordings label.

Category:September in the Eastern Orthodox calendar ","title":"September 7 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)"},{"id":"1619909","text":"Area code 564 is an area code for the state of Washington covering all of Western Washington, including Seattle. It is an overlay plan for area codes 206, 253, 360, and 425. It was originally proposed and approved in 2000, but it was not implemented until July 29, 2017. Initially, it was implemented as a concentrated overlay for the 360 area, comprising all of western Washington outside of the core of the Seattle/Tacoma metropolitan area. While it will expand to other area codes in the region as they exhaust, its implementation has made ten-digit dialing mandatory in all of western Washington. In 1999, area code 564 was proposed as an overlay of 360. That version of the overlay was slated for implementation on July 29, 2000. Later, the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC) determined that the actual increase in need for new numbers in 360 had fallen short of projections and so it postponed the overlay until at least February 2001. In May 2000, the commission projected that the metropolitan Seattle area codes (206, 253 and 425) would also soon exhaust their number pools, and it expanded the 564 plan to include those areas as well. By the summer, however, that was determined not to be immediately necessary. The overlay was then planned for application on October 20, 2001. On August 22, 2001, the WUTC announced that increased efficiency in the reuse of the existing number pool meant that the immediate need for the new area code had subsided. Part of that was also attributed to a downturn in the telecommunications sector. The commission put off implementation until no earlier than October 20, 2002. Since the development of the initial plan for the area code, the WUTC and the NANPA have rebuffed the telephone companies' request for a new area code and instead directed them to actively share and efficiently use the number blocks that had already been assigned. That refers mainly to the practice of number pooling, which divides telephone exchange prefixes for more efficient allocation as 10 blocks of 1,000 numbers, instead of assigning a prefix's whole numbering space (10,000 numbers) to one carrier in the one rate center. The WUTC took further steps to decrease the need for new number blocks in 360 and 509 and head off the need for new area codes, including aggressive reclamation of unused and underused number blocks and exchanges. The introduction of mandatory local and wireless number portability (a prerequisite for number pooling) has also served to stem the demand for new numbers and thus new area codes. According to the WUTC's estimate , the earliest projection for any Western Washington area code to be exhausted is 2018 for area code 360. The other codes are not expected to exhaust before 2025. On July 29, 2017, ten-digit dialing became mandatory for all local calls in Western Washington, replacing the use of seven-digit dialing. Until then, Seattle had been one of the few major American cities with seven-digit dialing still functioning. Since September 30, 2017, telephone numbers with the area code 564 are issued in the existing number plan area 360. Once other codes in Western Washington are exhausted, 564 numbers will be assigned in those areas also.

As a method of printing on cloth, the earliest surviving examples from China date to before 220 AD. Woodblock printing existed in Tang China during the 7th century AD and remained the most common East Asian method of printing books and other texts, as well as images, until the 19th century. Ukiyo-e is the best-known type of Japanese woodblock art print. Most European uses of the technique for printing images on paper are covered by the art term woodcut, except for the block-books produced mainly in the 15th century in India. Seals and stamps Prior to the invention of woodblock printing, seals and stamps were used for making impressions. The oldest of these seals came from Mesopotamia and Egypt. The use of round \\"cylinder seals\\" for rolling an impress onto clay tablets goes back to early Mesopotamian civilization before 3000 BC, where they are the most common works of art to survive, and feature complex and beautiful images. A few much larger brick (e.g. 13×13 cm) stamps for marking clay bricks survive from Akkad from around 2270 BC. There are also Roman lead pipe inscriptions of some length that were stamped, and amulet MS 5236 may be a unique surviving gold foil sheet stamped with an amulet text in the 6th century BC. Both the Bronze Age Phaistos Disc and the medieval Prüfening dedicatory inscription appear to have been stamped using a similar method with reusable characters, and have been cited as early examples of movable type printing. However none of these used ink, which is necessary for printing (on a proper definition), but stamped marks into relatively soft materials. In both China and Egypt, the use of small stamps for seals preceded the use of larger blocks. In Europe and India, the printing of cloth certainly preceded the printing of paper or papyrus; this was probably also the case in China. The process is essentially the same—in Europe special presentation impressions of prints were often printed on silk until at least the 17th century. Technique Woodcut press, from engraving in Early Typography by William Skeen, Colombo, Ceylon, 1872The wood block is carefully prepared as a relief pattern, which means the areas to show 'white' are cut away with a knife, chisel, or sandpaper leaving the characters or image to show in 'black' at the original surface level. The block was cut along the grain of the wood. It is necessary only to ink the block and bring it into firm and even contact with the paper or cloth to achieve an acceptable print. The content would of course print \\"in reverse\\" or mirror-image, a further complication when text was involved. The art of carving the woodcut is technically known as xylography, though the term is rarely used in English. For colour printing, multiple blocks are used, each for one colour, although overprinting two colours may produce further colours on the print. The paper is normally keyed to a frame around the woodblocks. There are three methods of printing to consider: Woodblock for textile printing, India, about 1900, 22×17×8 cm ; Stamping: Used for many fabrics, and most early European woodcuts (1400–40). These items were printed by putting paper or fabric on a table or a flat surface with the block on top, and pressing, or hammering, the back of the block. ; Rubbing: Apparently the most common for Far Eastern printing. Used for European woodcuts and block-books later in the 15th century, and very widely for cloth. The block is placed face side up on a table, with the paper or fabric on top. The back of the paper or fabric is rubbed with a \\"hard pad, a flat piece of wood, a burnisher, or a leather frotton\\".Hind, Arthur M. An Introduction to a History of Woodcut, p64-94, Houghton Mifflin Co. 1935 (in USA), reprinted Dover Publications, 1963 ; Printing in a press: \\"Presses\\" only seem to have been used in Asia in relatively recent times. Simple weighted presses may have been used in Europe, but firm evidence is lacking. Later, printing-presses were used (from about 1480). A deceased Abbess of Mechelen in Flanders in 1465 had \\"unum instrumentum ad imprintendum scripturas et ymagines ... cum 14 aliis lapideis printis\\" (\\"an instrument for printing texts and pictures ... with 14 stones for printing\\") which is probably too early to be a Gutenberg-type printing press in that location. In addition, jia xie is a method for dyeing textiles (usually silk) using wood blocks invented in the 5th–6th centuries in China. An upper and a lower block are made, with carved out compartments opening to the back, fitted with plugs. The cloth, usually folded a number of times, is inserted and clamped between the two blocks. By unplugging the different compartments and filling them with dyes of different colours, a multi-coloured pattern can be printed over quite a large area of folded cloth. The method is not strictly printing however, as the pattern is not caused by pressure against the block.Shelagh Vainker in Anne Farrer (ed), \\"Caves of the Thousand Buddhas\\", 1990, British Museum publications, =Colour woodblock printing= Mino province: Yoro-taki from the series Views of Famous Places in the Sixty-odd Provinces by Hiroshige, an ukiyo-e artist The earliest woodblock printing known is in colour—Chinese silk from the Han dynasty printed in three colours. On paper, European woodcut prints with coloured blocks were invented in Germany in 1508 and are known as chiaroscuro woodcuts. Colour is very common in Asian woodblock printing on paper; in China the first known example is a Diamond sutra of 1341, printed in black and red at the Zifu Temple in modern-day Hubei province. The earliest dated book printed in more than 2 colours is Chengshi moyuan (), a book on ink-cakes printed in 1606 and the technique reached its height in books on art published in the first half of the 17th century. Notable examples are the Hu Zhengyan's Treatise on the Paintings and Writings of the Ten Bamboo Studio of 1633, and the Mustard Seed Garden Painting Manual published in 1679 and 1701. In Japan, a multi-colour technique called nishiki-e (\\"brocade pictures\\") spread more widely, and was used for prints from the 1760s on. Japanese woodcut became a major artistic form, although at the time it was accorded a much lower status than painting. In both Europe and Japan, book illustrations were normally printed in black ink only, and colour reserved for individual artistic prints. In China, the reverse was true, and colour printing was used mainly in books on art and erotica. History Yuan-dynasty woodblock edition of a Chinese play =Origins in Asia= The earliest woodblock printed fragments to survive are from China and are of silk, printed with flowers in three colours from the Han dynasty (before AD 220). It is clear that woodblock printing developed in Asia several centuries before Europe. The Chinese were the first to use the process to print solid text, and equally that, much later, in Europe the printing of images on cloth developed into the printing of images on paper (woodcuts). It is also now established that the use in Europe of the same process to print substantial amounts of text together with images in block-books only came about four hundred years after the development of movable type by Bi Sheng (990–1051) during the Northern Song Dynasty of China. Coloured woodcut Buddha, 10th century, China In China, an alternative to woodblock printing was a system of reprography since the Han Dynasty using carved stone steles to reproduce pages of text. The three necessary components for woodblock printing are the wood block, which carries the design cut in relief; dye or ink, which had been widely used in the ancient world; and either cloth or paper, which was first developed in China, around the 3rd century BC or 2nd century BC. It seems that woodblock printing on papyrus has never been practised, although it would be possible. A few specimen of wood block printing, possibly called tarsh in Arabic,See , p. 427: \\"The thesis proposed here, that the word tarsh meant \\"printblock\\" in the dialect of the medieval Muslim underworld\\". have been excavated from a 10th-century context in Arabic Egypt. They were mostly used for prayers and amulets. The technique may be spread from China or an independent invention,See , p. 435: \\"Printing in Arabic appears in the Middle East within a century or so of becoming well established in China. Moreover, medieval Arabic chronicles confirm that the craft of paper making came to the Middle East from China by way of Central Asia, and one print was found in the excavation of the medieval Egyptian Red Sea port of al-Qusair al-Qadim where wares imported from China have been discovered. Nevertheless, it seems more likely that Arabic block printing was an independent invention\\". but had very little impact and virtually disappeared at the end of the 14th century.See , p. 427: \\"Judging from palaeography and the eighth-century date of the introduction of paper to the Islamic world, Arabic block printing must have begun in the ninth or tenth century. It persisted into, but possibly not beyond, the fourteenth century\\"... \\"Yet it had so little impact on Islamic society that today only a handful of scholars are aware it ever existed, and no definite textual reference to it has been thought to survive\\". In India the main importance of the technique has always been as a method of printing textiles, which has been a large industry since at least the 10th century. Large quantities of printed Indian silk and cotton were exported to Europe throughout the Modern period. Because Chinese has a character set running into the thousands, woodblock printing suits it better than movable type to the extent that characters only need to be created as they occur in the text. Although the Chinese had invented a form of movable type with baked clay in the 11th century, and metal movable type was invented in Korea in the 13th century, woodblocks continued to be preferred owing to the formidable challenges of typesetting Chinese text with its 40,000 or more characters. Also, the objective of printing in the East may have been more focused on standardization of ritual text (such as the Buddhist canon Tripitaka, requiring 80,000 woodblocks), and the purity of validated woodblocks could be maintained for centuries. When there was a need for the reproduction of a text, the original block could simply be brought out again, while moveable type necessitated error-prone composition of distinct \\"editions\\". In East Asia, the state involved itself in printing at a relatively early stage; initially only the government had the resources to finance the carving of the blocks for long works. The difference between East Asian woodblock printing and the Western printing press had major implications for the development of book culture and book markets in East Asia and Europe. =Early printed books in China and Korea= The intricate frontispiece of the Diamond Sutra from Tang Dynasty China, the world's earliest dated printed book, AD 868 (British Library) Woodblock printing in China is strongly associated with Buddhism, which encouraged the spread of charms and sutras. In the Tang Dynasty, a Chinese writer named Fenzhi first mentioned in his book \\"Yuan Xian San Ji\\" that the woodblock was used to print Buddhist scriptures during the Zhenguan years (AD 627~649). The oldest existing print done with wood-blocks was discovered in 1974 in an excavation in Xi'an (the capital of Tang-Dynasty China, then called Chang'an), Shaanxi, China, whereby individual sheets of paper were pressed into wooden blocks with the text and illustrations carved into them. It is a dharani sutra printed on hemp paper and dated to 650 to 670 AD, during the Tang Dynasty (618–907). Another printed document dating to the early half of the Chinese Tang Dynasty has also been found, the Saddharma pundarika sutra printed from 690 to 699. Dharani sutra replica exhibited at National Museum of Korea An early example of woodblock printing on paper is The Great Dharani Sutra that is dated between AD 704 and 751. It was found at Bulguksa, South Korea in 1966.North Korea — Silla Countrystudies.us accessed 2009-12-03; A History of Writings in Japanese and Current Studies in the Field of Rare Books in Japan – 62nd IFLA General Conference, Ifla.org, accessed 009-12-03; Gutenberg and the Koreans: The Invention of Movable Metal Type Printing in Korea, Rightreading.com, 2006-09-13, accessed 2009-12-03; Cho Woo-suk, JoongAng Daily , November 22, 2004, Eng.buddhapia.com, accessed 2009-12-03; National Treasure No. 126-6, by the Cultural Heritage Administration of South Korea (in Korean), jikimi.cha.go.kr, accessed 2009-12-28; National Treasure No. 126-6, by the Cultural Heritage Administration of South Korea (in Korean) Its Buddhist text was printed on a mulberry paper scroll in the early Korean Kingdom of Unified Silla. Another version of the Dharani sutra, printed in Japan around AD 770, is also frequently cited as an example of early printing. One million copies of the sutra, along with other prayers, were ordered to be produced by Empress Shōtoku. As each copy was then stored in a tiny wooden pagoda, the copies are together known as the Hyakumantō Darani (百万塔陀羅尼, \\"1,000,000 towers/pagodas Darani\\"). The world's earliest dated (AD 868) printed book is a Chinese scroll about sixteen feet long containing the text of the Diamond Sutra. It was found in 1907 by the archaeologist Sir Marc Aurel Stein in the Mogao Caves of Dunhuang, and is currently in the possession of the British Library. The book displays a great maturity of design and layout and speaks of a considerable ancestry for woodblock printing. The colophon, at the inner end, reads: Reverently [caused to be] made for universal free distribution by Wang Jie on behalf of his two parents on the 13th of the 4th moon of the 9th year of Xiantong [i.e. 11 May, AD 868 ]. Finely crafted books — like the medical work of 1249 shown above — were produced in China as early as the ninth century. In late 10th century China the complete Buddhist canon Tripitaka of 130,000 pages was printed with blocks, which took between 1080 and 1102, and many other very long works were printed. Early books were on scrolls, but other book formats were developed. First came the Jingzhe zhuang or \\"sutra binding\\", a scroll folded concertina-wise, which avoided the need to unroll half a scroll to see a passage in the middle. About AD 1000 \\"butterfly binding\\" was developed; two pages were printed on a sheet, which was then folded inwards. The sheets were then pasted together at the fold to make a codex with alternate openings of printed and blank pairs of pages. In the 14th century the folding was reversed outwards to give continuous printed pages, each backed by a blank hidden page. Later the bindings were sewn rather than pasted. Only relatively small volumes (juan 卷) were bound up, and several of these would be enclosed in a cover called a tao, with wooden boards at front and back, and loops and pegs to close up the book when not in use. For example, one complete Tripitaka had over 6,400 juan in 595 tao. =Japanese woodblock prints= Under the Wave off Kanagawa by Hokusai, a ukiyo-e artist The earliest known woodblock printing dates from 764–770, when Empress Shotoku commissioned one million small wooden pagodas containing short printed scrolls—typically —to be distributed to temples. Apart from the production of Buddhist texts, which became widespread from the 11th century in Japan, the process was only adopted in Japan for secular books surprisingly late, and a Chinese-Japanese dictionary of 1590 is the earliest known example. Though the Jesuits operated a movable type printing-press in Nagasaki, printing equipment which Toyotomi Hideyoshi's army seized from Korea in 1593 had far greater influence on the development of the medium. Four years later, Tokugawa Ieyasu, even before becoming shōgun, effected the creation of the first native movable type, using wooden type- pieces rather than metal. He oversaw the creation of 100,000 type-pieces, which were used to print a number of political and historical texts. An edition of the Confucian Analects was printed in 1598, using a Korean moveable type printing press, at the order of Emperor Go-Yōzei. This document is the oldest work of Japanese moveable type printing extant today. Despite the appeal of moveable type, however, it was soon decided that the running script style of Japanese writing would be better reproduced using woodblocks, and so woodblocks were once more adopted; by 1640 they were once again being used for nearly all purposes. The technology quickly gained popularity among publishers, and was used to produce affordable prints as well as books. As a result, Japan began to see something of literary mass production and increasing literacy. The content of these books varied widely, including travel guides, advice manuals, kibyōshi (satirical novels), sharebon (books on urban culture), art books, and play scripts for the jōruri (puppet) theatre. Often, within a certain genre, such as the jōruri theatre scripts, a particular style of writing would come to be the standard for that genre; in other words, one person's personal calligraphic style was adopted as the standard style for printing plays. =Diffusion in Eurasia= The technique is found through South and Central Asia, and in the Byzantine world for cloth, and by AD 1000 examples of woodblock printing on paper appear in Islamic Egypt. Printing onto cloth had spread much earlier, and was common in Europe by 1300. \\"In the 13th century the Chinese technique of blockprinting was transmitted to Europe\\", soon after paper became available in Europe. The print in woodcut, later joined by engraving, quickly became an important cultural tradition for popular religious works, as well as playing cards and other uses. Many early Chinese examples, such as the Diamond Sutra (above) contain images, mostly Buddhist, that are often elaborate. Later, some notable artists designed woodblock images for books, but the separate artistic print did not develop in China as it did in Europe and Japan. Apart from devotional images, mainly Buddhist, few \\"single-leaf\\" Chinese prints were made until the 19th century. =15th-century Europe= Three episodes from a block-book Biblia Pauperum illustrating typological correspondences between the Old and New Testaments: Eve and the serpent, the Annunciation, Gideon's miracle Block- books, where both text and images are cut on a single block for a whole page, appeared in Europe in the mid-15th century. As they were almost always undated and without statement of printer or place of printing, determining their dates of printing has been an extremely difficult task. Allan H. Stevenson, by comparing the watermarks in the paper used in blockbooks with watermarks in dated documents, concluded that the \\"heyday\\" of blockbooks was the 1460s, but that at least one dated from about 1451.Carter p. 46.Allan H. Stevenson, The Quincentennnial of Netherlandish Blockbooks, British Museum Quarterly, Vol. 31, No. 3/4 (Spring 1967), p. 83. Block books printed in the 1470s were often of cheaper quality, as a cheaper alternative to books printed by printing press.Master E.S., Alan Shestack, Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1967 Block books continued to be printed sporadically up through the end of the 15th century. The most famous block-books are the Speculum Humanae Salvationis and the Ars moriendi, though in this the images and text are on different pages, but all block-cut. The Biblia pauperum, a Biblical picture-book, was the next most common title, and the great majority of block-books were popular devotional works. All block-books are fairly short at less than fifty pages. While in Europe movable metal type soon became cheap enough to replace woodblock printing for the reproduction of text, woodcuts remained a major way to reproduce images in illustrated works of early modern European printing. (See also: Old master print.) Most block-books before about 1480 were printed on only one side of the paper — if they were printed by rubbing it would be difficult to print on both sides without damaging the first one to be printed. Many were printed with two pages per sheet, producing a book with opening of two printed pages, followed by openings with two blank pages (as earlier in China). The blank pages were then glued together to produce a book looking like a type-printed one. Where both sides of a sheet have been printed, it is presumed a printing-press was used. The method was also used extensively for printing playing cards.created 2003 – 2005 Early Card painters and Printers in Germany, Austria and Flanders (14th and 15th century).

The distinctive shape of the pages in the Tibetan books (called Pechas) goes back to Palm leaf manuscripts in ancient Buddhist India Woodblocks for printing, Sera monastery in Tibet In East Asia, woodblock printing proved to be more enduring than in Europe, continuing well into the 19th century as the major form of printing texts, especially in China, even after the introduction of the European printing press. In countries using Arabic, Turkish and similar scripts, works, especially the Qur'an were printed from blocks or by lithography in the 19th century, as the links between the characters require compromises when movable type is used which were considered inappropriate for sacred texts.Robertson, Frances, Print Culture: From Steam Press to Ebook, p.75, 2013, Routledge, , 9780415574167, gogle books Nianhua were a form of coloured woodblock prints in China, depicting images for decoration during the Chinese New Year.

Bagh Print Traditional Woodblock printing on textile in Village Bagh Madhya Pradesh, India. Block printing has also been extensively used for decorative purposes such as fabrics, leathers and wallpaper. This is easiest with repetitive patterns composed of one or a small number of motifs that are small to medium in size (due to the difficulty of carving and handling larger blocks). For a multi-colour pattern, each colour element is carved as a separate block and individually inked and applied. Block printing was the standard method of producing wallpaper until the early 20th century and is still used by a few traditionalist firms. It also remains in use for making cloth, mostly in small artisanal settings, for example in India. William Morris was one artist who used woodblock printing to produce patterned wallpaper and textiles during the mid-to-late Victorian era Examples of Morris' work are housed in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The museum also holds a number of Morris' original woodblocks, which are still in limited use.

An accounting period begins whenever a company comes within the corporation tax charge, and whenever an accounting period ends without the company ceasing to be within the charge. There are a number of rules about when an accounting period ends, and we look at each of these below. Often an accounting period coincides with a company's period of account. This is the period for which it draws up accounts,Section 832(1) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 except for a life assurance company, where it is the period for which it draws up its periodical return.Section 431 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 However, periods of account and accounting periods do not necessarily coincide. Basic rules An accounting period begins when:Section 12(2) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 *the company comes within the charge to corporation tax. A company usually first comes within the corporation tax charge when it first acquires a source of income.Section 832(1) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (see the closing words) and HM Revenue and Customs' Company Taxation Manual at CTM01410 However, it will also come within the charge if it commences business but is not already within the charge.Section 12(4) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 Overseas companies usually come within the charge if they become UK resident or start trading in the UK through a UK permanent establishment;Section 11 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988It was also held in Walker v Centaur Clothes Group Ltd 72 TC 379 that a source is not always necessary. In that case, it was held that the company becoming liable to pay advance corporation tax was enough to bring it within the charge to tax. *an accounting period of the company ends, and the company is still within the charge to corporation tax; or *the company does not currently have an accounting period and has a chargeable gain or allowable loss.Section 12(6) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 Chargeable gains and allowable losses are taxable gains and tax relievable losses that arise on the disposal of certain capital assets, for example on the disposal of the company's head office.The full definition of what constitutes a chargeable gain or allowable loss is in the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 An accounting period ends on the earliest of the following:Section 12(3) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 *the expiration of 12 months from the beginning of the accounting period; *an accounting date of the company or, if there is a period for which the company does not draw up accounts, the end of that period; *the company beginning or ceasing to trade or to be, in respect of the trade or (if more than one) of all trades carried on by it, within the charge to corporation tax; *the company beginning or ceasing to be UK resident; *the company ceasing to be within the charge to corporation tax. There are further rules to deal with windings up, life assurance companies and lessor companies. A UK-resident company is treated as coming within the charge to corporation tax (if it has not already come within the charge to corporation tax) when it commences to carry on business. Example Suppose ABC Ltd, a UK resident company is incorporated on 1 August 20X1. It acquires a source of income (an interest- bearing bank account) on 1 September 20X1 and commences trading on 1 October 20X1 and continues trading throughout all other periods under review. It draws up its accounts for the following periods: :1 August 20X1 to 31 December 20X1 :1 January 20X2 to 31 December 20X2 :1 January 20X3 to 30 June 20X3 :1 July 20X3 to 31 December 20X4 Then ABC Ltd would have the following accounting periods: :1 September 20X1 to 30 September 20X1 (from when it came into charge to corporation tax to the commencement of trade) :1 October 20X1 to 31 December 20X1 (to the end of a period of account) :1 January 20X2 to 31 December 20X2 (to the end of a period of account) :1 January 20X3 to 30 June 20X3 (to the end of a period of account) :1 July 20X3 to 30 June 20X4 (to the expiry of 12 months) :1 July 20X4 to 31 December 20X4 (to the end of a period of account) Company with more than one trade If a company carrying on more than one trade draws up accounts of any of them to different dates, and does not make up general accounts for the whole of the company's activities, the company may determine that any one of those dates shall be taken into consideration for the purposes of determining whether an accounting period has ended under the rule in the second bullet point above.Section 12(5) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 If, however, the Board of HMRC is of the opinion, on reasonable grounds, that the date so chosen by the company is inappropriate, they may, if it is reasonable to do so, give notice that the accounting date of another of the company's trades should be used instead.Section 12(5A) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 Mean accounting date Some companies draw up financial statements to the same day of the week, a Sunday, say, each year. They will therefore have 364-day (52-week) or 371-day (53-week) periods of account. As long as the company draws its accounts up to within four days of a mean accounting date each year, it may, for the purposes of determining its accounting periods, deem its accounts to be drawn up for a twelve-month period. For example, when there is a 371-day period of account, instead of having one accounting period of 365 days (in a non-leap year) and another of 6 days, it will prepare its return on the assumption that the period of account was 365 days long.See the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales's Technical Release 500 and HM Revenue and Customs' Company Taxation Manual at CTM01560. This method is related to the 4-4-5 Calendar of accounts, where a quarter is deemed to comprise two months of 4 weeks each and one month of 5 weeks, a total of 13 weeks or 91 days. In the United States the method is referred to as the 52-53 Week Fiscal Year and is approved for use under US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the Internal Revenue Code. See article under 4-4-5 Calendar for discussion of the US method application. Inspector determining the accounting period Where it appears to the tax inspector that the beginning or end of any accounting period is uncertain, he may make an assessment on the company for such period, not exceeding 12 months, as appears to him appropriate. In that event, that period is treated for all purposes as an accounting period unless the inspector sees fit to revise it as a result of receiving further facts, or on an appeal against the assessment in respect of some other matter the company shows the true accounting periods. If on an appeal against an assessment made under this rule the company shows the true accounting periods, the assessment appealed against has effect as an assessment or assessments for the true accounting periods, and assessments may be made for any such periods as might have been made at the time when the assessment appealed against was made.Section 12(8) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 Administration and winding upAdministration= An accounting period ends immediately before the day a company enters into administration. For this purpose a company enters administration when it enters administration under Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986 or is subject to any corresponding procedure otherwise than under that Act (for example, in an overseas jurisdiction).Section 12(7ZA) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 An accounting period ends when a company ceases to be in administration.Section 12(3)(da) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 For these purposes a company ceases to be in administration when it ceases to be in administration under Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986 or any corresponding event occurs otherwise than under that ActSection 12(5B) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (for example, in an overseas jurisdiction). =Winding up= An accounting period ends and a new one begins with the commencement of a winding up. For this purpose a winding up is taken to commence on the passing of a resolution for the winding up of the company, or on the presentation of a winding up petition if no such resolution has previously been passed and a winding up order is made on the petition, or on the doing of any other act for a like purpose in the case of a winding up otherwise than under the Insolvency Act 1986.Section 12(7) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 After this, an accounting period does not end other than by the expiration of 12 months from its beginning or by the completion of the winding up. However, if the company later enters administration, this rule is disapplied from that point (and with an accounting period ending because the company has entered into administration). During the course of a winding up, a company may make an estimate of when it will be wound up so that it can prepare tax returns for its final accounting period before that period ends. If the date assumed for the winding up turns out to be before the actual winding up, then an accounting period ends on the date assumed for the winding up, a new accounting period starts, and the immediately preceding paragraph applies as if the winding up had started with that accounting period.Section 342(6) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 Cooperatives preparing quarterly and half-yearly accounts HMRC will, under certain conditions, allow cooperatives that prepare quarterly and half-yearly accounts to merge a number of periods of account for tax purposes so that they have only accounting date each year.Inland Revenue Extra-statutory concession C12 See page 67 of this pdf from HM Revenue and Customs (772k) Life assurance companies Additionally, there are special rules that apply to life assurance companies from which life assurance business is transferred under an insurance business transfer scheme. Different rules apply depending on whether section 444AA of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 applies. For transfers before 1 January 2007, s444AA applies where the whole of the transferor's long-term insurance business is being transferred and the company. It is proposed that the Finance Bill 2007 will amend this for transfers on or after 1 January, so that section 444AA applies where the whole or substantially the whole of the transferor's long-term insurance business is transferred, in which case the transfer time is taken to be the time some business is first transferred/See draft legislation released by HMRC on 6 December 2006 If section 444AA does not apply, an accounting period of the transferor company ends with the day of the transfer.Section 12(7A) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 If section 444AA applies, an accounting period of the transferor company ends immediately before the transfer, and the transferor also has an accounting period covering the instant of the transfer (except for the purposes of calculating the equalisation provision for tax purposes).Section 12(7C) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 =Example where s444AA applies= Suppose a transferor company, XYZ Life Ltd, has in the past prepared periodical returns for a period encompassing the calendar year. It transfers the whole of its business at 11.59pm on 31 December 20X1, after which it retains some cash on deposit. It agrees with the Financial Services Authority that it does not need to prepare a periodical return for 20X1. XYZ Life Ltd will have the following accounting periods in 20X1: :1 January 20X1 to immediately before the transfer of business :An accounting period covering the instant of the transfer (11.59pm on 31 December 20X1) :An accounting period covering the period beginning immediately after the transfer to midnight on 31 December 20X1 Lessor companies If a company carries on a business of leasing plant or machinery, is within the charge to corporation tax in respect of the business and there is a qualifying change of ownership in relation to the company, then an accounting period of the company ends on the day of that qualifying change in ownership, and a new accounting period begins on the following day. There are exceptions to this in Paragraph 40.Paragraphs 3, 33, 40 Schedule 10 to the Finance Act 2006 Partial deeming provisions Other provisions in the Taxes Acts sometimes deem there to be accounting periods for specific purposes only. This is typically on the introduction of new legislation. For example, when section 75 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 was replaced as a result of the Finance Act 2004, companies, if necessary, deemed themselves to have an accounting period ending on 31 March 2004 for the purposes of calculating management expenses that they were entitled to under the rules applying pre-1 April 2004 and post-31 March 2004.

It is accountable to Parliament directly through the President of the Queen’s Privy Council and the Minister of Intergovernmental and Northern Affairs and Internal Trade. The independent agency investigates accidents and makes safety recommendations in four modes of transportation: aviation, rail, marine and pipelines. Agency history Prior to 1990, Transport Canada's Aircraft Accident Investigation Branch (1960–1984) and its successor the Canadian Aviation Safety Board or CASB (1984–1990) were responsible for investigation of air incidents. Before 1990, investigations and actions were taken by Transport Canada and even after 1984 the findings from CASB were not binding for Transport Canada to respond to. The TSB was created under the Canadian Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety Board Act, which was enacted on March 29, 1990. It was formed in response to a number of high- profile accidents, following which the Government of Canada identified the need for an independent, multi-modal investigation agency. The headquarters are located in Place du Centre in Gatineau, Quebec. The provisions of the Canadian Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety Board Act were written to establish an independent relationship between the agency and the Government of Canada. This agency's first major test came with the crash of Swissair Flight 111 on September 2, 1998, the largest single aviation accident on Canadian territory since the 1985 crash of Arrow Air Flight 1285. The TSB delivered its report on the accident on March 27, 2003, some 4½ years after the accident and at a cost of $57 million, making it the most complex and costly accident investigation in Canadian history to that date. From 2005 to 2010, the TSB concluded a number of investigations into high-profile accidents, including: * the crash of Air France Flight 358; * the Cheakamus River derailment; * the sinking of Queen of the North; * the loss overboard of a crewmember of Picton Castle; * the Burnaby pipeline rupture; * the crash of Cougar Helicopters Flight 91; * the sinking of Concordia. To increase the uptake of its recommendations and address accident patterns, the TSB launched its Watchlist in 2010, which points to nine critical safety issues troubling Canada’s transportation system. On 3 December 2013, in the wake of the Lac- Mégantic rail disaster the previous July, it was reported that the number of runaway trains was triple the number documented by the TSB. In August 2014, the TSB released the report on its investigation into the July 2013 Lac- Mégantic derailment. In a news conference, then TSB chair Wendy Tadros described how eighteen factors played a role in the disaster including a \\"weak safety culture\\" at the now-defunct Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railways with \\"a lack of standards, poor training and easily punctured tanks.\\" The TSB also blamed Transport Canada, the regulator, for not doing thorough safety audits often enough on railways \\"to know how those companies were really managing, or not managing, risk.\\" The TSB report called for \\"physical restraints, such as wheel chocks, for parked trains.\\" Prior to the accident TSB had called for \\"new and more robust wagons for flammable liquids\\" but as of August 2014, little progress had been made in implementing this. On February 4th, 2019, the TSB deployed to the derailment of Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) train 301-349. Ninety-nine cars and two locomotives derailed at Mile 130.6 of the CP Laggan Subdivision, near Field, British Columbia (BC) while proceeding westward to Vancouver, BC. The three train crewmembers – a locomotive engineer, a conductor, and a conductor trainee – died as a result. During the course of its investigation into the derailment, the organization issued two safety advisories on April 11, 2019 to Transport Canada . The first called attention to the need for effective safety procedures to be applied to all trains stopped in emergency on both “heavy grades” and “mountain grades” and the second highlighted the need to review the efficacy of the inspection and maintenance procedures for grain hopper cars used in CP's unit grain train operations (and for other railways as applicable), and ensure that these cars can be operated safely at all times. In January 2020, the Senior Investigator was reassigned in order to protect the integrity and objectivity of the investigation after voicing an opinion implying civil or criminal liability. The TSB labelled the comments made to The Fifth Estate journalists as \\"completely inappropriate\\" as the mandate of the TSB is to make findings as to causes and contributing factors of a transportation occurrence, but not to assign fault or determine civil or criminal liability. The CBC documentary pointed out what seemed to be a problem, where the private police service of CP Rail investigated the accident. A CPPS officer was also resigned over these circumstances. As of June 2020, the investigation is ongoing. Mandate and direction The Transportation Safety Board's mandate is to * conduct independent investigations, including public inquiries when necessary, into selected transportation occurrences in order to make findings as to their causes and contributing factors; * identify safety deficiencies, as evidenced by transportation occurrences; * make recommendations designed to eliminate or reduce any such safety deficiencies; and * report publicly on its investigations and on the related findings The TSB may assist other transportation safety boards in their investigations. This may happen when: * an incident or accident occurs involving a Canadian-registered aircraft in commercial or air transport use; * an incident or accident occurs involving a Canadian-built aircraft (or an aircraft with Canadian-built engines, propellers, or other vital components) in commercial or air transport use; * a country without the technical ability to conduct a full investigation asks for the TSB's assistance (especially in the field of reading and analyzing the content of flight recorders). Provincial and territorial governments may call upon the TSB to investigate occurrences. However, it is up to the TSB whether or not to proceed with an investigation. Public reports are published following class one, class two, class three and class four investigations. Recommendations made by the TSB are not legally binding upon the Government of Canada, nor any of its Ministers of departments. However, when a recommendation is made to a federal department, a formal response must be presented to the TSB within 90 days.

They are descended from several groups, particularly Evenks, one of the indigenous peoples of the Russian North. They adopted a Turkic language sometime after the 18th century. The 2010 Census counted 7,885 Dolgans. This number includes 5,517 in former Taymyr Autonomous Okrug. There are 26 Dolgans in Ukraine, four of whom speak Dolgan (2001 Ukrainian Census). Dolgans speak the Dolgan language, which is closely related to the Yakut language. A Dolgan woman in Dudinka  History  The Dolgans are considered a Turkified Tungusic people. In the 17th century, the Dolgans lived in the basins of the Olenyok River and Lena River. They moved to their current location, Taymyr, in the 18th century. The Dolgan identity began to emerge during the 19th and early 20th centuries, under the influence of three groups who migrated to the Krasnoyarsk area from the Lena River and Olenyok River region: Evenks, Yakuts, Enets, and so-called tundra peasants (зату́ндренные крестья́не zatúndrennye krest’jáne, literally \\"tundranized peasants\\").  Culture and livelihood  Originally, the Dolgans were nomadic hunters and reindeer herders. However, they were prevented from following a nomadic lifestyle during the Soviet era and required to form kolkhozy (rural collectives) that – in addition to their traditional activities – engaged in reindeer breeding, fishing, dairy farming and market gardening. In 1983, the anthropologist Shirin Akiner claimed: \\"Dolgans enjoy full Soviet citizenship. They are found in all occupations, though the majority are peasants and collective farm workers. Their standard of housing is comparable to that of other national groups in the Soviet Union.\\" Religion Most Dolgans practise old shamanistic beliefs; however, most are influenced by Eastern Orthodox Christianity.

Widely regarded as the first epic feminist artwork, it functions as a symbolic history of women in civilization. There are 39 elaborate place settings arranged along a triangular table for 39 mythical and historical famous women. Sacajawea, Sojourner Truth, Eleanor of Aquitaine, Empress Theodora of Byzantium, Virginia Woolf, Susan B. Anthony, and Georgia O'Keeffe are among the symbolic guests. Each unique place-setting includes a hand-painted china plate, ceramic cutlery and chalice, and a napkin with an embroidered gold edge. Each plate, except the ones corresponding to Sojourner Truth and Ethel Smyth, depicts a brightly colored, elaborately styled vulva form. The settings rest upon elaborately embroidered runners, executed in a variety of needlework styles and techniques. The dinner table stands on The Heritage Floor, made up of more than 2,000 white luster-glazed triangular-shaped tiles, each inscribed in gold scripts with the name of one of 998 women and one man who have made a mark on history. (The man, Kresilas, was mistakenly included as he was thought to have been a woman called Cresilla.) It was produced from 1974 to 1979 as a collaboration and was first exhibited in 1979. Subsequently, despite art world resistance, it toured to 16 venues in six countries on three continents to a viewing audience of 15 million. It was retired to storage until 1996, as it was beginning to suffer from constant traveling. Since 2007, it has been on permanent exhibition in the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum, New York. About the work The Dinner Party was created by artist Judy Chicago, with the assistance of numerous volunteers, with the goal to “end the ongoing cycle of omission in which women were written out of the historical record.”leftChicago said she got the idea for the work while attending a real dinner party in 1974. “The men at the table were all professors,” she recalled, “and the women all had doctorates but weren’t professors. The women had all the talent, and they sat there silent while the men held forth. I started thinking that women have never had a Last Supper, but they have had dinner parties.” The table is triangular and measures forty- eight feet (14.63 m) on each side.Chicago, 10. There are 13 place settings on each of the three sides of the table making 39 settings in all. Wing I honors women from Prehistory to the Roman Empire, Wing II honors women from the beginnings of Christianity to the Reformation and Wing III from the American Revolution to feminism. Each place setting features a table runner embroidered with the woman's name and images or symbols relating to her accomplishments, with a napkin, utensils, a glass or goblet, and a plate. Many of the plates feature a butterfly- or flower-like sculpture as a vulva symbol. A cooperative effort of female and male artisans, The Dinner Party celebrates traditional female accomplishments such as textile arts (weaving, embroidery, sewing) and china painting, which have been framed as craft or domestic art, as opposed to the more culturally valued, male-dominated fine arts. While this piece is composed of typical craft work such as needlepoint and china painting and normally considered low art, \\"Chicago made it clear that she wants The Dinner Party to be viewed as high art, that she still subscribes to this structure of value: 'I'm not willing to say a painting and a pot are the same thing,' she has stated. 'It has to do with intent. I want to make art.' The white floor of triangular porcelain tiles, called the Heritage Floor, is inscribed with the names of a further 998 notable women (and one man, Kresilas, mistakenly included as he was thought to have been a woman called Cresilla) each associated with one of the table place settings. The Dinner Party was donated by the Elizabeth A. Sackler Foundation to the Brooklyn Museum, where it is now permanently housed within the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art, which opened in March 2007. Brooklyn Museum Official website. Accessed Jan 2013 In 2018, Chicago created a limited edition set of functional plates based on the Dinner Party designs. The plate designs that were reproduced were Elizabeth I, Primordial Goddess, Amazon, and Sappho. Design details The completed Dinner Party took six years and $250,000 to complete, not including volunteer labor.Lippard, Lucy. \\"Judy Chicago's Dinner Party\\". Art in America 68 (April 1980): 114–126. The work began modestly as Twenty-Five Women Who Were Eaten Alive, a way in which Chicago could use her \\"butterfly-vagina\\" imagery and interest in china painting in a high-art setting. Chicago soon expanded it to include the thirty-nine final women arranged in three groups of thirteen. The triangular shape has significance because it has long been a symbol of the female. It is also an equilateral triangle to represent equality. The number thirteen represents the number of people who were present at the Last Supper, an important comparison for Chicago, as the only people involved there were men. Chicago developed the work on her own for the first three years before bringing in others. Over the next three years, over 400 people contributed to the creation of the work, most of them volunteers. About 125 were called \\"members of the project\\", suggesting long-term efforts, and a small group was closely involved with the project for the final three years, including ceramicists, needle-workers, and researchers. The project was organized according to what has been called \\"benevolent hierarchy\\" and \\"non- hierarchical leadership\\", as Chicago designed most aspects of the work and had the final control over decisions made. The 39 plates themselves start flat and begin to emerge in higher relief towards the very end of the chronology, meant to represent modern woman's gradual independence and equality, though it is still not totally free of societal expectations.Koplos, Janet. \\"The Dinner Party Revisited.\\" Art in America 91.5 (May 2003): 75–77. The work also uses supplementary written information such as banners, timelines, and a three-book exhibition publication to provide background information on each woman included and the process of making the work. Women represented in the place settings The first wing of the triangular table has place settings for female figures from the goddesses of prehistory through to Hypatia at the time of the Roman Empire. This section covers the emergence and decline of the Classical world. The second wing begins with Marcella and covers the rise of Christianity. It concludes with Anna van Schurman in the seventeenth century at the time of the Restoration. The third wing represents the Age of Revolution. It begins with Anne Hutchinson and moves through the twentieth century to the final places paying tribute to Virginia Woolf and Georgia O'Keeffe. The 39 women with places at the table are: Wing I: From Prehistory to the Roman Empire 1\\\\. Primordial Goddess 2\\\\. Fertile Goddess 3\\\\. Ishtar 4\\\\. Kali 5\\\\. Snake Goddess 6\\\\. Sophia 7\\\\. Amazon 8\\\\. Hatshepsut 9\\\\. Judith 10\\\\. Sappho 11\\\\. Aspasia 12\\\\. Boadicea 13\\\\. Hypatia Wing II: From the Beginnings of Christianity to the Reformation 14\\\\.

Georgia O'Keeffe =Women represented in the Heritage Floor= The Heritage Floor, which sits underneath the table, features the names of 998 women (and one man, Kresilas, mistakenly included as he was thought to have been a woman called Cresilla) inscribed on white handmade porcelain floor tilings. The tilings cover the full extent of the triangular table area, from the footings at each place setting, continues under the tables themselves and fills the full enclosed area within the three tables. There are 2304 tiles with names spread across more than one tile. The names are written in the Palmer cursive script, a twentieth-century American form. Chicago states that the criteria for a woman's name being included in the floor were one or more of the following: # She had made a worthwhile contribution to society # She had tried to improve the lot of other women # Her life and work had illuminated significant aspects of women's history # She had provided a role model for a more egalitarian future. Accompanying the installation are a series of wall panels which explain the role of each woman on the floor and associate her with one of the place settings.Chicago, Judy. The Dinner Party: From Creation to Preservation. London: Merrell (2007), Heritage panels, page 289. . ResponseImmediate critical response (1980–1981)= The Dinner Party prompted many varied opinions. Feminist critic Lucy Lippard stated, \\"My own initial experience was strongly emotional... The longer I spent with the piece, the more I became addicted to its intricate detail and hidden meanings\\", and defended the work as an excellent example of the feminist effort. These reactions are echoed by other critics, and the work was glorified by many.Caldwell, Susan H. \\"Experiencing The Dinner Party.\\" Woman's Art Journal 1.2 (Autumn 1980-Winter 1981): 35–37. Just as adamant, however, were the immediate criticisms of the work. Hilton Kramer, for example, argued, \\"The Dinner Party reiterates its theme with an insistence and vulgarity more appropriate, perhaps, to an advertising campaign than to a work of art\\".Kramer, Hilton. \\"Art: Judy Chicago's Dinner Party Comes to Brooklyn Museum.\\" The New York Times. October 17, 1980. He called the work not only a kitsch object but also \\"crass and solemn and singleminded\\", \\"very bad art,... failed art,... art so mired in the pieties of a cause that it quite fails to acquire any independent artistic life of its own\\". Maureen Mullarkey also criticized the work, calling it preachy and untrue to the women it claims to represent. She especially disagreed with the sentiment she labels \\"turn ‘em upside down and they all look alike\\", an essentializing of all women which does not respect the feminist cause. Mullarkey also called the hierarchical aspect of the work into question, claiming that Chicago took advantage of her female volunteers.Mullarkey, Maureen. \\"The Dinner Party is a Church Supper: Judy Chicago at the Brooklyn Museum.\\" Commonweal Foundation, 1981. Mullarkey focused on several particular plates in her critique of the work, specifically Emily Dickinson, Virginia Woolf, and Georgia O'Keeffe, using these women as examples of why Chicago's work was disrespectful to the women it depicts. She states that Dickinson's \\"multi-tiered pink lace crotch\\" was opposite the woman it was meant to symbolize because of Dickinson's extreme privacy. Woolf's inclusion ignores her frustration at the public's curiosity about the sex of writers, and O’Keeffe had similar thoughts, denying that her work had any sexed or sexual meaning. The Dinner Party was satirized by artist Maria Manhattan, whose counter-exhibit The Box Lunch at a SoHo gallery was billed as \\"a major art event honoring 39 women of dubious distinction\\", and ran in November and December 1980. In response to The Dinner Party being a collaborative work, Amelia Jones makes note that \\"Chicago never made exorbitant claims for the 'collaborative' or nonhierarchical nature of the project. She has insisted that it was never conceived or presented as a 'collaborative' project as this notion is generally understood . . . The Dinner Party project, she insisted throughout, was cooperative, not collaborative, in the sense that it involved a clear hierarchy but cooperative effort to ensure its successful completion.\\" New York Times art reviewer Roberta Smith declares that all the details are not equal. She believes that \\"the runners tend to be livelier and more varied than the plates. In addition, the runners grow strong as the work progresses, while the plates become weaker, more monotonous and more overdone, which means the middle two-thirds of the piece is more successful.\\" With the runners becoming more detailed as the work progresses, Smith notes that the backs of the runners are difficult to see and they \\"may be the best and boldest parts of all.\\" Similarly, Roberta Smith stated that \\"its historical import and social significance may be greater than its aesthetic value\\".Smith, Roberta. \\"Art Review: For a Paean to Heroic Women, a Place at History's Table.\\" New York Times. September 20, 2002. Regarding the place settings, Janet Koplos believes that the plates are meant to serve as canvases, and the goblets offer vertical punctuation. She feels, however, that the \\"standardized flatware is historically incorrect early on and culturally skewed. The settings would be stronger as plates and runners alone.\\" = Race and identity = In 1984, Hortense J. Spillers published her critical article, \\"Interstices: A Small Drama of Words\\" wherein she critiques Judy Chicago and The Dinner Party, asserting that, as a White woman, Chicago recreates the erasure of the Black feminine sexual self. Spillers calls to her defense the place setting of Sojourner Truth, the only Black woman. After thorough review, it can be seen that all of the place settings depict uniquely designed vaginas, except for Sojourner Truth. The place setting of Sojourner Truth is depicted by three faces, rather than a vagina. Spillers writes, \\"The excision of the female genitalia here is a symbolic castration. By effacing the genitals, Chicago not only abrogates the disturbing sexuality of her subject, but also hopes to suggest that her sexual being did not exist to be denied in the first place...\\"Routledge Press, Spillers, Hortense j, \\"Interstices: a small drama of words\\", from Pleasure and Danger: Exploiting Female Sexuality, ed. Carole Vance (London: Pandora, 1992), pp. 74–80. Much like Spillers's critique, Alice Walker published her critical essay in Ms. magazine noting \\"Chicago's ignorance of women of color in history (specifically black women painters), focusing in particular on The Dinner Party's representation of black female subjectivity in Sojourner Truth's plate. Walker states, \\"It occurred to me that perhaps white women feminists, no less than white women generally, can not imagine black women have vaginas. Or if they can, where imagination leads them is too far to go.\\" Esther Allen further criticizes Chicago in her article \\"Returning the Gaze, with a Vengeance\\". Allen claims that The Dinner Party excludes women from Spain, Portugal, or any of these empires' former colonies. This means that several very prominent women of western history were excluded, such as Frida Kahlo, Teresa of Ávila, Gabriela Mistral, and more. Chicago herself responded to these criticisms, claiming that all of these women are included on the \\"Heritage Floor\\" and that focusing solely on who is at the table is \\"to over- simplify the art and ignore the criteria my studio team and I established and the limits we were working under\\". Further, Chicago states that, in the mid-1970s, there was little or no knowledge about any of these women. =Larger retrospective response= Critics such as Mullarkey have returned to The Dinner Party in later years and stated that their opinions have not changed. Many later responses to the work, however, have been more moderate or accepting, even if only by giving the work value based on its continued importance. Amelia Jones, for example, places the work in the context of both art history and the evolution of feminist ideas to explain critical responses of the work.Jones, Amelia. \\"The ‘Sexual Politics’ of The Dinner Party: A Critical Context.\\" Reclaiming Female Agency. Eds. Norma Broude and Mary D. Garrard. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005. 409–433. She discusses Hilton Kramer's objection to the piece as an extension of Modernist ideas about art, stating, \\"the piece blatantly subverts modernist value systems, which privilege the ‘pure’ aesthetic object over the debased sentimentality of the domestic and popular arts\\" . Jones also addresses some critics’ argument that The Dinner Party is not high art because of its huge popularity and public appeal. Where Kramer saw the work's popularity as a sign that it was of a lesser quality, Lippard and Chicago herself thought that its capability of speaking to a larger audience should be considered a positive attribute. The \\"butterfly vagina\\" imagery continues to be both highly criticized and esteemed. Many conservatives criticized the work for reasons summed up by Congressman Robert K. Dornan in his statement that it was \\"ceramic 3-D pornography\\", but some feminists also found the imagery problematic because of its essentializing, passive nature. However, the work fits into the feminist movement of the 1970s which glorified and focused on the female body. Other feminists have disagreed with the main idea of this work because it shows a universal female experience, which many argue does not exist. For example, lesbians and women of ethnicities other than white and European are not well represented in the work. Jones presents the argument regarding the collaborative nature of the project. Many critics attacked Chicago for claiming that the work was a collaboration when instead she was in control of the work. Chicago, however, had never claimed that the work would be this kind of ideal collaboration and always took full responsibility for the piece. Artist Cornelia Parker nominated it as a work she would like to see \\"binned\\", saying, \\"Too many vaginas for my liking. I find it all about Judy Chicago's ego rather than the poor women she's supposed to be elevating – we're all reduced to vaginas, which is a bit depressing. It's almost like the biggest piece of victim art you've ever seen. And it takes up so much space! I quite like the idea of trying to fit it in some tiny bin – not a very feminist gesture but I don't think the piece is either.\\"Michael Landy: modern art is rubbish..., Hermione Hoby, The Observer, Sunday 17 January 2010 Controversy at the University of the District of Columbia In 1990, The Dinner Party was considered for permanent housing at the University of the District of Columbia. It was part of a plan to bring in revenue for the school, as it had proved to be very successful. The work was to be donated as a gift to the school, and it was to join an expanding collection of African-American art, including a large group of paintings by Washington abstractionist Sam Gilliam and works by Elizabeth Catlett, Romare Bearden, Alma Thomas, Hale Woodruff, Jacob Lawrence and Lois Mailou Jones, among others. These - along with works by a group of local white Color Field painters and some white UDC faculty members also in the university collections - were to become the core of what was presented in early 1990 as a ground-breaking multicultural art center, a hopeful coalition between artists of color, feminists and other artists depicting the struggle for freedom and human equality. Judy Chicago donated The Dinner Party with the understanding that one of the school's buildings would be repaired to house it. The money for these repairs had already been allocated and did not come from the school's working budget. On June 19, 1990, UDC trustees formally accepted the gift of The Dinner Party by unanimous vote. Soon, however, news reporters from Washington Times began writing stories that claimed that The Dinner Party \\"had been banned from several art galleries around the country because it depicts women's genitalia on plates\\" and that the \\"Board of Trustees will spend nearly $1.6 million to acquire and exhibit a piece of controversial art.\\" Misunderstandings about the monetary situation were emphasized and perpetuated by media sources. Eventually, the plans were cancelled owing to concerns that the collection would negatively affect the school's working budget.

The U.S. Military and NORAD had also planned to conduct several military exercises and a drill was being held by the National Reconnaissance Office, a Department of Defense agency. The operations, exercises and drills were all canceled following the September 11 attacks. Ongoing military operations Operation Northern Vigilance, was a NORAD operation which involved deploying fighter aircraft to locations in Alaska and Northern Canada. In order to simulate a hijacking situation including terrorist pilots. The operation was a response to a Russian exercise, in which long-range bombers were dispatched to Russia's high north. The operation was one part simulation, one part real world. It was immediately called off after NORAD received word from NEADS that the Federal Aviation Administration had evidence of a hijacking. All simulated information (so-called \\"injects\\") were purged from computer screens at NORAD headquarters in Colorado. On receiving news of the attacks, the Russians promptly canceled their exercise as well. Planned military exercises The military exercises (war games) planned for September 11, 2001, included: * Global Guardian, an annual command-level exercise organized by United States Strategic Command in cooperation with Space Command and NORAD. Primary purpose is to test and validate nuclear command and control and execution procedures. Global Guardian is performed in conjunction with NORAD's Vigilant Guardian and Amalgam Warrior, as well as exercises sponsored by Air Combat Command (Crown Vigilance) and Space Command (Apollo Guardian). * Vigilant Guardian, the semiannual NORAD exercise that had been running in conjunction with Global Guardian for several days and which postulated a bomber attack from the former Soviet Union. Vigilant Guardian is a Command Post Exercise (CPX), meaning it is conducted in offices and with computers, but without actual planes in the air. The exercise involves all NORAD command levels. Out of a range of scenarios being run on September 11, 2001, one was a \\"traditional\\" simulated hijacking. According to General Eberhart, after the first attack, \\"it took about 30 seconds\\" to make the adjustment to the real-world situation. Because of an increased number of staff, the exercise would prove to be an enabler of rapid military response for NORAD and its NEADS component, as senior officials who were manning NORAD command centers throughout the U.S. were available to make rapid decisions. * Vigilant Warrior. In his book Against All Enemies, Richard Clarke recounts that there was a NORAD exercise ongoing called Vigilant Warrior. The claim is based on a comment that Richard Myers made to Clarke via a video link on September 11, 2001. However, there is no other record of a NORAD exercise named Vigiliant Warrior. Myers was possibly referring to Vigilant Guardian (the aforementioned yearly NORAD exercise held in conjunction with Global Guardian) or Amalgam Warrior (a large-scale, live-fly, CINCNORAD sponsored exercise which is held twice annually). Vigilant Warrior was also a 1994 operation by the US army in the Persian Gulf region, in response to Iraqi troop movements towards Kuwait. National Reconnaissance Office drill Aside from military exercises, a National Reconnaissance Office drill was being conducted on September 11, 2001. In a simulated event, a small aircraft would crash into one of the towers of the agency's headquarters after experiencing a mechanical failure. The NRO is the branch of the Department of Defense in charge of spy satellites. According to its spokesman Art Haubold: \\"No actual plane was to be involved -- to simulate the damage from the crash, some stairwells and exits were to be closed off, forcing employees to find other ways to evacuate the building.\\" He further explained: \\"It was just an incredible coincidence that this happened to involve an aircraft crashing into our facility, as soon as the real world events began, we canceled the exercise.\\" Most of the agency's personnel were sent home after the attacks.Agency planned exercise on Sept. 11 built around a plane crashing into a building , from Boston.com Operation Tripod bioterrorism exercise On September 12, 2001, there was due to take place the second part of an exercise known as Operation Tripod, set up to \\"test the plan to distribute antibiotics to the entire city population during a bioterrorism attack\\". Richard Sheirer, director of the New York City Mayor's Office of Emergency Management (NYC OEM), had hired \\"over 1,000 Police Academy cadets and Fire Department trainees to play terrified civilians afflicted with various medical conditions, allergies, and panic attacks.\\" Various individuals were invited to watch, including Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the police and fire commissioners, and representatives of the FBI and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Pier 92 was set up as a model distribution station where the \\"victims\\" of the mock attack who needed to receive antibiotics would be treated. The exercise was a follow-up to a previous training exercise in New York, called RED Ex, which took place on May 21, 2001.The New York Sun According to the MTI Report Saving City Lifelines: Lessons Learned in the 9-11 Terrorist Attacks, \\"September 11 was going to be a busy day at the OEM. Staff members arrived early to prepare for Operation Tripod.\\" When the September 11, 2001, attacks began, Operation Tripod was immediately canceled as attentions turned to the real ongoing emergency. Because Pier 92 had been set up ready for the exercise, NYC OEM staff were able to move there and quickly convert it into a large emergency operations center when their original command center (in WTC Building 7) was evacuated and later destroyed. Thus, within 31 hours of the attacks, NYC OEM had a functional facility able to manage the search and rescue effort, just four miles north-northwest of the WTC site.9/11 Commission Report The exercise was later rescheduled and took place on May 22, 2002.Office of Emergency Management - Press Release: May 22, 2002 - Operation TriPOD See also * 9/11 advance-knowledge debate * 9/11 Commission Report * Military exercise * Military simulation * U.S. military response during the September 11 attacks ReferencesExternal links * Amid Crisis Simulation, \`We Were Suddenly No-Kidding Under Attack' at Newshouse News Service - account of 9/11 at the Northeast Air Defense Sector headquarters near Rome, NY * Complete 911 Timeline: Military exercises up to 9/11 * 911 Myths - War Games Cover for 9/11 * Strategic Command on 9/11 at Offutt AFB, from a Major at the Air Force Weather Agency. * NORAD audio tapes from 9/11, 120 hours in 18 WAV files, available from a web page Category:Military exercises involving the United States Category:Non-combat military operations involving the United States Category:September 11 attacks ","title":"United States government operations and exercises on September 11, 2001"},{"id":"1619971","text":"The Air-Walker (Gabriel Lan) (also known as Gabriel the Air-Walker) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

Returning from a mission in space, the Way-Opener was confronted by the vessel of the cosmic entity Galactus, who abducts Lan and offers to transform him into a herald, in a similar fashion to the Silver Surfer. A willing Lan accepts and becomes the Air-Walker. Pyreus Kril, the Way-Opener's first officer and Lan's friend, becomes obsessed with finding Galactus after the abduction. Lan becomes devoted to Galactus, and the closest thing Galactus has had to a true friend. On one journey to seek a planet for sustenance for Galactus, he battles the alien race the Ovoids, who kill Lan, but not before Galactus retrieves and transfers the last spark of Lan's soul to an android body.All seen in flashback in Thor #306 (April 1981) Dissatisfied with the android, which lacked Lan's personality, Galactus sends it to Earth to re-enlist the Silver Surfer as his Herald. The Air-Walker encounters the Fantastic Four, and is then defeated by the Surfer, who guesses at the android's true nature. Mister Fantastic reprograms Galactus' ship to take him to the Negative Zone, where he will apparently have an abundance of worlds to consume.Fantastic Four #120 - 123 (March - June 1972) The remnants of the Air-Walker are found by the villain Machinesmith.Captain America #249 (Sep. 1980) The android eventually repairs itself and reactivates. Believing itself to be the original Gabriel Lan, the Air-Walker attempts to find the Surfer, but encounters the Thunder God, Thor. The Air-Walker's ability to wield Thor's hammer Mjolnir reveals its non-human nature, and Thor destroys the android.Thor #305 (March 1981) Another of Galactus' former Heralds, Firelord, learns of the battle and confronts Thor. Firelord reveals that he was once Pyreus Kril, and eventually located Galactus' vessel and confronted the entity. Galactus agreed to reveal Lan's fate on the condition that Pyreus serve him as his latest Herald. Firelord then returns to space with the remains of the android.Thor #306 (April 1981) Firelord and the Surfer eventually revive the android to aid in a battle against Galactus' most ruthless Herald, Morg,Silver Surfer vol. 3, #73 - 75 (Oct. - Dec. 1992) who completely destroys the Air-Walker.Silver Surfer vol. 3, #79 (April 1993) A version of the Air-Walker and Firelord aid young superhero team the New Warriors against a threat from the planet Xandar.New Warriors #40 - 42 (Oct. - Dec. 1993) Lan's consciousness is then absorbed into the computer of Galactus' Worldship, and in data form directs Galactus to uninhabited worlds.

Endowed with the Power Cosmic, Lan as the Air-Walker possessed superhuman strength, endurance, reflexes and reactions, mastery of the electromagnetic spectrum and total immunity to the rigors of space. Like all Heralds, the Air-Walker was capable of travelling faster than the speed of light. Gabriel Lan graduated from the Xandarian Nova Corps Academy, and in addition to a thorough knowledge of combat, has knowledge of advanced alien technology and space navigation. In the years of service as Herald to Galactus, Lan the Airwalker had been gifted with a powerful cosmic relic through which he maximized his Power Cosmic; the Bow of Gabriel, a powerful weapon which enables its user to terraform whole worlds. This process hyper- enriched their nutritional properties while reducing their populations to docility, making far more fulfilling meals Galactus could feed upon.Black Order #2 (Dec, 12 2018) The android version of Lan appears to possess all the same abilities, in addition to a unique self-repair system and a homing beacon he could use to find Galactus' ship.

Traditional coloring books and coloring pages are printed on paper or card. Some coloring books have perforated edges so their pages can be removed from the books and used as individual sheets. Others may include a story line and so are intended to be left intact. Today many children's coloring books feature popular cartoon characters. They are often used as promotional materials for animated motion pictures. Coloring books may also incorporate other activities such as connect the dots, mazes and other puzzles. Some also incorporate the use of stickers. History The Little Folks Painting Book, 1879 Paint books and coloring books emerged in the United States as part of the \\"democratization of art\\" process, inspired by a series of lectures by British artist Joshua Reynolds, and the works of Swiss educator Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and his student Friedrich Fröbel. Many educators concluded that all, regardless of background, students stood to benefit from art education as a means of enhancing their conceptual understanding of the tangible, developing their cognitive abilities, and improving skills that would be useful in finding a profession, as well as for the children's spiritual edification. The McLoughlin Brothers are credited as the inventors of the coloring book, when, in the 1880s, they produced The Little Folks' Painting Book, in collaboration with Kate Greenaway. They continued to publish coloring books until the 1920s, when the McLoughlin Brothers became part of the Milton Bradley Company. Another pioneer in the genre was Richard F. Outcault. He authored Buster's Paint Book in 1907, featuring the character of Buster Brown, which he had invented in 1902. It was published by the Stokes Company. This launched a trend to use coloring books to advertise a wide variety of products, including coffee and pianos. Until the 1930s, books were designed with the intent for them to be painted instead of colored. Even when crayons came into wide use in the 1930s, books were still designed so that they could be painted or colored. Educational uses \\"California Poppy\\", a page from a wildflower coloring book Display of coloring books in a shop Example of a coloring book for children Coloring books are widely used in schooling for young children for various reasons. For example, children are often more interested in coloring books rather than using other learning methods; pictures may also be more memorable than simply words. Coloring may also increase creativity in painting, according to some research.research As a predominantly non-verbal medium, coloring books have also seen wide applications in education where a target group does not speak and understand the primary language of instruction or communication. Examples of this include the use of coloring books in Guatemala to teach children about hieroglyphs and Mayan artist patterns, and the production of coloring books to educate the children of farm workers about \\"the pathway by which agricultural pesticides are transferred from work to home.\\" Coloring books are also said to help to motivate students' understanding of concepts that they would otherwise be uninterested in. They have been used as teaching aids for developing creativity and knowledge of geometry, such as in Roger Burrows' Altair Designs. Since the 1980s, several publishers have produced educational coloring books intended for studying graduate-level topics such as anatomy and physiology, where color-coding of many detailed diagrams are used as a learning aid. Examples include The Anatomy Coloring Book and subsequent book series, by Wynn Kapit and Lawrence Elson, published by HarperCollins (1990s) and Benjamin Cummings (2000s).The Anatomy Coloring Book, Wynn Kapit and Lawrence M. Elson. HarperCollins, 1993, second revised and expanded edition, There are some examples of educators using coloring books to better explain complicated topics, like programming. Some publishers have specialized in coloring books with an explicit educational purpose, both for children and for adults. The books often have extensive text accompanying each image. These publishers include Dover Books, Really Big Coloring Books, Running Press, and Troubador Press. Health and therapeutic uses Coloring books have seen wide application in the health professions as educational tools. One nurse, trying to limit the trauma of surgery, described in an academic publication how the use of a coloring book \\"might help [the child] to understand what was going to happen to him.\\" They are also used in rehabilitation of accident victims to aid recovery of hand–eye coordination, and they are used with autistic children both for entertainment and for their soothing effect. Coloring books have been used to explain complicated medical conditions to children. One of the appeals of adult coloring books is that they help users relax and de- stress. Political uses In 1962, cartoonist Mort Drucker teamed with humorist Paul Laikin in creating the John F. Kennedy Coloring Book, a satirical introduction to Kennedy, his family and administration, told from the point of view of his daughter Caroline. The book sold 2,500,000 copies. In 1968 the Black Panther Coloring Book began circulating in the United States; the book features black men and children killing pigs dressed as police officers. It was argued to have been made not by the Black Panther Party but by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's COINTELPRO program to discredit the organization, a claim which other sources dispute.Some commentators have alleged that the book was a piece of FBI agitprop. See Others accept the text as genuine. See The term and concept of the \\"coloring book\\" was adopted by the feminist artist Tee Corinne as a tool of female empowerment. Corinne made pencil sketches of female genitalia, which she then inked and printed on card stock. She published a collection of them in 1975 as The Cunt Coloring Book. In August 2011, American publisher Really Big Coloring Books released We Shall Never Forget: The Kids Book of Freedom detailing specific drawings in the accounting of SEAL Team 6 shooting Osama bin Laden in his home. The book was criticized by some for portraying Muslims in a negative manner. The company has also published The Tea Party Coloring Book for Kids, Ted Cruz To The Future (2013) and a book about President Barack Obama's inauguration (2008). Fine art Photographer Jno Cook produced line drawings based on Robert Frank's The Americans, and in 1983 published them in a limited edition as The Robert Frank Coloring Book. In 1994, the National Gallery of Art used the images as party favors for writers working on the catalog for a retrospective of Frank's work. Adult coloring books Adults coloring at a library program Coloring books are a form of adult therapy that have seen a growth in popularity in the 2010s. They reportedly bring people a sense of their childhood, and help with developing fine motor skills and vision, reducing anxiety and creating focus, and relieving stress and anxiety in a manner similar to meditation. Concentrating on coloring may facilitate the replacement of negative thoughts and images with pleasant ones. Coloring books can be used in daily activities. The books are also a way to get away from technology, which some may regard as beneficial to people's health. They can also be used by people who aren't as comfortable with other extremely expressive forms of art. While coloring books for adults were popular in the early 1960s, those were satirical works rather than the therapeutic works that define the adult coloring book form today. The first commercially successful adult coloring books were published in 2012 and 2013, and began increasing in popularity in 2015. In April of that year, Johanna Basford brought out two coloring books called \\"Secret Garden\\" and Enchanted Forest\\", which became the top sellers at Amazon. By November it was reported by Amazon.ca that the books were the most top wished for items with nine of the top ten consisting of such books. Also that month Crayola began offering its own line of adult coloring books. Publishers also began packaging some of their colouring books with pencils and CDs to support the enjoyment of this activity. Sales in the US continued to grow in early 2016, but began to fall by the end of the year, with fewer newcomers trying this pastime. Adult coloring books are offered digitally, via ebooks, digital apps, and coloring pages that can be colored online or downloaded. Users' digital work-products can be saved and shared. Dominic Bulsuto theorized that the trend of digital purchasing helped the spread of the genre, noting that the relative anonymous nature of the act allowed customers to feel more secure perusing books they would be embarrassed to buy in real life. By 2016, Faber-Castell, a worldwide color pencil supplier, was reported to have trouble keeping up with demand for their products due to the craze, while Blue Star Coloring sold over a million titles in one year. =Criticism= Author Susan Jacoby has criticized adult coloring books, along with the popularity among adults of young adult fiction, as \\"an artifact of a broader cultural shift. And that cultural shift is a bad thing\\". She believes the Great Recession has contributed to this shift, as adults unable to find employment have moved home to live with their parents. New York City futurist and blogger Dominic Bulsuto describes adult coloring book fans as \\"stuck in The Shallows, mindfully coloring books to counter the existential angst of living in a digital society\\". He goes on to say that \\"...the endless Internet parade of silly cat photos, infantile comments and adolescent memes has dumbed us down\\". However, Bulsuto ultimately sees the trend as a good thing, noting that adults are increasingly buying books they want to buy, rather than books they are supposed to buy. Coloring book software Coloring books can also be found digitally in the form of coloring book websites and applications. Coloring book software often has features such as color mixing, flood filling, and paintbrush tools that allow for more accurate and detailed drawings than regular coloring books.

He was a native of New York City. Biography Dave Fleischer was the youngest of five brothers and grew up in Brownsville, Brooklyn, a poor Jewish neighbourhood. By the time David was born, his father had lost his means of livelihood due to the mass production of garments. Fleischer worked as an usher at the Palace Theater on Broadway, where he was exposed to vaudeville. This experience contributed to the development of his sense for gags and comic timing, which came into play when he joined forces with his older brother, Max in the production of animated cartoons. At one point, the family lived in Coney Island, and he became interested in being a clown for one of the sideshow amusements. This clown character would be recalled a few years later in connection with Max's early experiments with his first major invention, \\"The Rotoscope\\" and was the source of their first character who evolved into Koko the Clown in the pioneering series, Out of the Inkwell. Around 1913–14, he began working as a film cutter for Pathé Exchange the American branch of Pathé, the French company that was the world's largest film production and distribution company, and the largest manufacturer of film equipment in the first decades of the 20th century. In 1921, he joined forces with Max in starting their first studio, Out of the Inkwell Films, Inc. in a dingy basement apartment in midtown Manhattan. He went on to become director and later supervising producer of the studio's output. Among the cartoon series Fleischer supervised were Out of the Inkwell, Inklings, The Inkwell Imps, Talkartoons, Betty Boop, Popeye the Sailor, Color Classics. He also supervised two animated features Gulliver's Travels and Mr. Bug Goes to Town. Following a relocation to Miami, Florida, and the production of their first feature, Gulliver's Travels, Fleischer Studios became indebted to Paramount Pictures due to the cost overruns on \\"Gulliver\\" and losses in rentals on the new 1940s cartoon series produced under Dave's control. The new series, including Stone Age Cartoons, Gabby and Animated Antics, were poorly received with theaters only valuing the Popeye cartoons. This forced the temporary surrender of Fleischer Studios to Paramount on May 24, 1941, while their final feature was contracted for completion.Shostak, Stu (November 19, 2008) Interview with Ray Pointer [radio broadcast]. Stu's Show. Los Angeles: Shokus Internet Radio. Max Fleischer secured the license for Superman after Republic Pictures allegedly passed on the property as a potential serial. Budgeted at twice the cost of a Popeye cartoon, Superman became the most successful cartoon series of the late Fleischer Studio period, representing its maturing into the 1940s. Relations between the brothers began to deteriorate around 1938, which was aggravated further by Dave's taking control of production starting in 1940, which resulted in the poorer cartoons produced under his control compounded by his continued rejection of Max's input and late completion of films. Dave Fleischer resigned from Fleischer Studios in late November, 1941 following the recording of the score for Mr. Bug Goes to Town. His official resignation was announced on December 31, 1941. He became producer for Screen Gems at Columbia Pictures in April 1942, where he produced Song of Victory and Imagination, which were both nominated for Academy Awards. He also produced The Fox and Crow and Li'l Abner series, as well as the omnibus Phantasies series. In spite of the Oscar nominations, Harry Cohn fired Dave in 1944, replacing him with Harry Binder. He approached Republic Pictures with an elf-like version of Koko the Clown, a character named \\"Snippy\\", who was tried out as a live action–animation combo novelty at the end of the low- budget nightclub musical, Trocadero. A \\"Snippy\\" cartoon series never materialised, however. Fleischer continued at Republic as associate producer of the minute-long animation sequence for another \\"B\\" movie, That's My Baby! (1944). For a short period, he had a comic strip for The Hollywood Citizen News. In the early 1950s, Dave animated a series of Technicolor theatrical snipes for the Filmack Trailer and local merchant snipe company of Chicago (which Filmack is known to be the most popular local merchant snipe maker and trailer maker of all time in the 1950s and 1960s). It was at the Filmack headquarters in Chicago, Illinois that he animated the famous Let's All Go to the Lobby. Following a series of oddball assignments, Dave landed a permanent position as a \\"Technical Specialist\\" at Universal through animation producer, Walter Lantz. At Universal, Dave was a Special Effects Technical and general problem-solver, working on films such as Francis, The Birds, and Thoroughly Modern Millie. He was credited as \\"Technical Advisor\\" on Universal's American release of the Russian animated feature, The Snow Queen (1957), supervising the English language dubbing. Death Following his assignment on Thoroughly Modern Millie, Fleischer retired, and continued to live at the Peyton Hall apartment complex on Hollywood Boulevard until his death. Fleischer died of a stroke on June 25, 1979, three weeks before his 85th birthday.

The association demanded the university establish full independence from the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations within a year. The university complied with the AUCC directives, and was reinstated in April 2008. In November 2008, the Canadian Association of University Teachers voted unanimously to censure FNUniv and asked its members not accept jobs, honours or awards at the university. Changes made relating to academic freedom, governance and political autonomy were reported to be reason for the censure vote. The censure was lifted in April 2010 after the university made very significant governance changes. =Financial support= In October 2008, the government of Saskatchewan gave the university $1.6 million to relieve a chronic budget deficit. The money was given to cover salaries of faculty and operating expenses. Another $400,000 was to be spent on a review of the university's long-term operations. In February 2009, the provincial government withheld $200,000 of funding. Lack of progress in solving the institution's problems was cited as the reason. By March 18, enough progress had been made for the government to release half the frozen funds. In June 2009, the federal government withheld $2.4 million in funding, saying it wanted to see changes at the institution before the money would be handed over. University officials responded by accusing the federal and provincial governments of being uncooperative and unnecessarily negative in their attempts to address alleged governance problems. On February 3, 2010, the provincial government of Saskatchewan officially suspended funding the FNUniv effective April 1, 2010. The next day, the FNUniv's board of governors was dissolved. On February 8, 2010, the Canadian federal government announced it would cease funding the University, effective March 31, 2010. However, on March 23, 2010, the province of Saskatchewan restored funding. In June 2010, the federal government announced the provision of $4 million of support in response to the changes in governance that were underway; however, these funds would be administered on behalf of FNUniv by the University of Regina. =Staff problems= In January 2009, Shauneen Pete was dismissed from her position as Vice-President of Academics for what the university administration said was an internal personnel matter. On January 13, the FNUC Students' Association organized a rally in protest. Two former employees of the institution, Janet Lee Kurtz and Wesley Robert Stevenson, were charged with defrauding the university of the amounts of $21,000 and $15,000 respectively. Both pleaded guilty, were ordered to make full restitution, and agreed to perform community service. In December 2009 the university's chief financial officer, Murray Westerlund, left his position. Westerlund said he was fired, but FNUniv's then-president, Charles Pratt, said that the departure was mutually agreed upon. FNUniv officials also missed another series of deadlines to file various reports, which led the federal government to withhold $1.8 million in funding. In January 2010, documents from November 2009 surfaced which showed that Westerlund had raised concerns about inappropriate spending. Westerlund filed a wrongful dismissal lawsuit against the university on December 17, 2009. The suit claims he was marginalized and then fired for writing the documents which criticized the spending practices of university officials. The provincial Minister of Advanced Education, Rob Norris, called for an emergency meeting with the University of Regina's board of governors to discuss the financial situation at the FNUniv. After the meeting on January 27, Norris hinted that the provincial government may cut off funding to the institution. In March 2010, it was discovered that nearly $400,000 of the FNUniv's scholarship fund had been spent on general operations. The fund had dwindled from $390,000 in spring 2009 to $15,000 in February 2010. On March 19, 2010, Charles Pratt was terminated by the Interim Board of Governors, with cause, as President of FNUniv; he had previously been suspended with pay. Allan Ducharme, the former Vice-president of Administration, was fired on the same day. Dr. Shauneen Pete, who had formerly been dismissed from a leadership post at FNUniv, was appointed as President in April 2010 for a six-month term. In August 2012, Charles Pratt and Allan Ducharme reached an out-of-court settlement and First Nations University issued a statement as a part of that settlement, which stated in part \\"that neither Mr. Pratt nor Mr. Ducharme were found to be in dereliction of their respective duties nor guilty of any financial impropriety\\".

The kings of Bréifne continued to attempt to re-gain the provincial kingship, as attested by Conchobar's defeat of Ualgarc ua Ruarc. The Book of Leinster implies that Conchobar died of colic, and that his successor, Cathal, was killed at the battle of Céis Chorainn, reigning three days. His killer was Murchad Glun re Lar mac Flaithbertaigh of Cenél nÉogain. Mac Shamhráin states: > \\"It seems that the provincial kingship remained weak for the next twenty > years, as dynasty from several different lines extended their sway over > parts of Connacht. However, through his son Cathal, who eventually emerged > as provincial ruler, Conchobar became the ancestor of the royal line of Ua > Conchobair (O'Connor), which provided most of the later kings of Connacht.\\" His great-grandchildren were the first to be known by the surname Ua Conchobair, and his senior male descendant is The Ó Conchubhair Donn. A brother of Conchobar's was Máel Ruanaid Mór mac Tadg, ancestor of the Kings of Moylurg and the families of Ua/Ó Maolruanaid (Mulrooney) and MacDiarmata (MacDermot).

Zalayeta began his club career with Danubio before moving to Peñarol for a season in 1997, where he won the Uruguayan Primera División and the Uruguayan Liguilla Cup. Later that year, he was acquired by Italian club Juventus, where he remained for ten seasons, winning three Serie A titles and reaching the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final, although he was sent on several loan spells with Empoli, Spanish side Sevilla and Perugia during his time at the Turin club, due to heavy competition from other strikers in the team's line-up. He moved to Napoli in 2007, where he remained for three more seasons, aside from a loan spell with Bologna during the 2009–10 season. After his time in Italy, he later spent a season with Turkish side Kayserispor, before returning to his home nation to play for Peñarol once again, winning the Uruguayan Primera División for a second time in 2013, before retiring in 2016. At international level, Zalayeta represented the Uruguay national team on 47 occasions between 1997 and 2005, scoring ten goals. At youth level, he was a member of the team that finished second in the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship, and at senior level, he helped Uruguay reach the 1999 Copa América Final. Club career Zalayeta started his career with Danubio and then moving to Peñarol in Uruguay in 1997, where he made a name for himself, winning the Uruguayan Primera División and the Uruguayan Liguilla Cup. He moved to Juventus later that year, but although he was considered a promising young player at the time, he was not given much of a chance to prove himself due to heavy competition from several other prominent forwards at the club. However, he scored a decisive goal on his Serie A debut on 14 March 1998, in a 2–2 home draw against Napoli; Juventus would finish the season as league champions. He then spent a season on loan with Empoli, and he also starred in Uruguay's surge for the Copa América in 1999, who lost in the final to Brazil. Two more years away from the club followed, and he played for Spanish side Sevilla until 2001. At last, when it seemed Juve lacked forwards, he was brought back to Italy at the start of the 2001–02 season, but he was loaned out to Perugia in 2004 before returning to Juventus in the same year. Although he did not play many matches with Juventus, he performed well when given a chance, winning three Serie A titles (1998, 2002, 2003), two Supercoppa Italiana medals (2002 and 2003), and a Serie B title in 2007, also helping the club to the 2002 Coppa Italia Final. During his time at the club, he was given the nickname \\"Panteron\\". He scored two very important extra time winners against Spanish opposition upon his return to Juventus. One came in 2003 in the quarter-finals of UEFA Champions League against Barcelona, the other against Real Madrid in the 2005 round of 16. In the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final, Zalayeta was one of the three Juventus players to have their penalty saved by Milan keeper Dida in the shootout after a 0–0 draw, as Milan won the title. After a decade with Juventus, he moved to Napoli in the summer of 2007.Channel4.com Napoli paid €1.4 million for half of the rights (co-ownership). He played 49 Serie A matches and scored 12 goals in 2 seasons, but at the start of 2009–10 season he became surplus to the team and was not offered a shirt number. On 21 August 2009, Zalayeta joined Bologna on loan from Napoli for the 2009–10 season. On 1 July 2010, Zalayeta returned to Napoli but failed to enter first team. On 25 August 2010, he left for Turkish side Kayserispor on a two-year contract. On 17 July 2011, Zalayeta joined his former Uruguayan side Peñarol as a free agent; he won the Uruguayan Primera División for a second time in 2013 before retiring in 2016. International career Zalayeta was called up for the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship in Malaysia with the Uruguay national under-20 team, scoring four goals throughout the tournament as his team reached the final, and was defeated by Argentina. With the senior Uruguay national team, he took part at the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup, in which Uruguay managed a fourth-place finish, and the 1999 Copa América, scoring three goals in five appearances in the latter tournament, as they reached the final of the competition, only to be defeated by Brazil. Zalayeta represented Uruguay during his country's campaign to qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, notably scoring a hat-trick in a 3–2 home win over Colombia on 4 September 2005. He was selected in a 23-man squad for Uruguay's World Cup intercontinental playoff against Australia on 16 November. Zalayeta was one of two penalty kick takers whose shots were saved by Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer. Zalayeta's failure to convert culminated in Australia winning the play-off 4–2 on penalties, qualifying for the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals in Germany, and eliminating Uruguay in the process. This was his final appearance for Uruguay. In total, he made 47 appearances for the national team between 1997 and 2005, scoring ten goals. Style of play A tall and physically strong forward, with a slender build, Zalayeta usually played as a centre-forward, and was primarily known for his technical skills and touch on the ball, as well as his eye for goal, heading, and ability in the air, which enabled him both to score and assist goals with his head; however, despite being a quick player in his youth, he was also known for his lack of pace as his career progressed. A team player, he was also known for his work-rate, ability to link-up with teammates, and hold up the ball with his back to goal, and was often involved in the build-up of attacking plays; he also possessed good movement, which enabled him to find spaces and get on the end of his teammates passes. Regarded as a promising but undisciplined player in his youth, he later developed into a more mature and reserved player as his career progressed, and was known for his tendency to score decisive goals for his teams, especially after coming off the bench, in particular during his time with Juventus, despite his lack of playing time with the club. He also had a strong personality, and was known for his exuberant goal celebrations with his arms lowered. He was nicknamed il panterone (\\"the big panther,\\" in Italian) in the media throughout his career, due to his movements and agility.

Search is a rebadged version of the Bing search engine owned by Yahoo!, headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. Originally, \\"Yahoo Search\\" referred to a Yahoo-provided interface that sent queries to a searchable index of pages supplemented with its directory of websites. The results were presented to the user under the Yahoo! brand. Originally, none of the actual web crawling and data housing was done by Yahoo! itself. In 2001, the searchable index was powered by Inktomi and later by Google until 2004, when Yahoo! Search became independent. On July 29, 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! announced a deal in which Bing would henceforth power Yahoo! Search. As of July 2018, Microsoft Sites handled 24.2 percent of all search queries in the United States. During the same period of time, Oath (the then-owner of the Yahoo brand) had a search market share of 11.5 percent. Market leader Google generated 63.2 percent of all core search queries in the United States. Yahoo! Search has been criticized for favoring websites owned by Yahoo!'s parent company, Verizon Media, in its search results.  Search technology acquisition  The roots of Search date back to Yahoo! Directory, which was launched in 1994 by Jerry Yang and David Filo, then students at Stanford University. In 1995, they introduced a search engine function, called Yahoo! Search, that allowed users to search Yahoo! Directory. it was the first popular search engine on the Web, despite not being a true Web crawler search engine. They later licensed Web search engines from other companies. Seeking to provide its own Web search engine results, Yahoo! acquired their own Web search technology. In 2002, they bought Inktomi, a \\"behind the scenes\\" or OEM search engine provider, whose results are shown on other companies' websites and powered Yahoo! in its earlier days. In 2003, they purchased Overture Services, Inc., which included their owned the AlltheWeb and AltaVista search engines. Initially, even though Yahoo! owned multiple search engines, they didn't use them on the main yahoo.com website, but kept using Google's search engine for its results. Yahoo! Search page in 2005 Starting on April 7, 2003, Yahoo! Search became its own web crawler-based search engine. They combined the capabilities of search engine companies they had acquired and their prior research into a reinvented crawler called Yahoo!. The new search engine results were included in all of Yahoo's websites that had a web search function. Yahoo! also started to sell the search engine results to other companies, to show on their own websites. Their relationship with Google was terminated at that time, with the former partners becoming each other's main competitors. In October 2007, Yahoo! Search was updated with a more modern appearance in line with the redesigned Yahoo! home page. In addition, Search Assist was added; which provides real-time query suggestions and related concepts as they are typed. Yahoo! Search page in 2008 In July 2008, Yahoo! Search announced the introduction of a new service called Yahoo! Search BOSS (\\"Build your Own Search Engine\\"). This service opens the doors for developers to use Yahoo!'s system for indexing information and images and create their own custom search engine. In January 2010, Microsoft announced a deal in which it would take over the functional operation of Yahoo! Search, and set up a joint venture to sell advertising on both Yahoo! Search and Bing known as the Microsoft Search Alliance. A complete transition of all Yahoo! sponsored ad clients to Microsoft adCenter (now Bing Ads) occurred in October 2010. Yahoo! Search page in 2011 On March 12, 2014, Yahoo announced a partnership with Yelp to integrate its reviews and user- contributed photos into Yahoo! Search (as Bing had previously done). In November 2014, Mozilla signed a five-year partnership with Yahoo, making Yahoo Search the default search engine for Firefox browsers in the US. In April 2015, the Microsoft partnership was modified, now only requiring Bing results on the \\"majority\\" of desktop traffic, opening the ability for Yahoo to enter into non-exclusive deals for search services on mobile platforms and the remainder of desktop traffic. The amendment also gives either company the ability to terminate the contract with four months' notice. In October 2015, Yahoo subsequently reached an agreement with Google to provide services to Yahoo Search through the end of 2018, including advertising, search, and image search services. As of October 2019, Yahoo! Search is once again “powered by Bing”. Yahoo Search blog and announcements  The team at Yahoo Search frequently blogged about search announcements, features, updates and enhancements. The Yahoo Search Blog, as stated provided A look inside the world of search from the people at Yahoo. This included index updates named Weather Updates and their Yahoo Search Assist feature. International presence  Yahoo Search also provided their search interface in at least 38 international markets and a variety of available languages. Yahoo! has a presence in Europe, Asia and across the Emerging Markets. =Languages= * Arabic * Bulgarian * Catalan * Chinese (Simplified) * Chinese (Traditional) * Croatian * Czech * Danish * Dutch * English * Estonian * Finnish * French * German * Greek * Hebrew * Hungarian * Icelandic * Indonesian * Italian * Japanese * Korean * Latvian * Lithuanian * Malay * Norwegian * Persian * Polish * Portuguese * Romanian * Russian * Serbian * Slovak * Slovenian * Spanish * Swedish * Tagalog * Thai * Turkish * Vietnamese  Search results  Yahoo Search indexed and cached the common HTML page formats, as well as several of the more popular file-types, such as PDF, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint, Word documents, RSS/XML and plain text files. For some of these supported file-types, Yahoo Search provided cached links on their search results allowing for viewing of these file-types in standard HTML. Using the Advanced Search interface or Preferences settings, Yahoo Search allowed the customization of search results and enabling of certain settings such as: SafeSearch, Language Selection, Number of results, Domain restrictions, etc. For a Basic and starter guide to Yahoo Search, they also provided a Search Basics tutorial.Search Basics tutorial In 2005, Yahoo began to provide links to previous versions of pages archived on the Wayback Machine.Yahoo Cache Now Offers Direct Links to Wayback Machine Search Engine Watch, September 18, 2005 In the first week of May 2008, Yahoo launched a new search mash up called Yahoo Glue, which is in beta testing.  Selection-based search  On June 20, 2007, Yahoo introduced a selection-based search feature called Yahoo Shortcuts. When activated this selection-based search feature enabled users to invoke search using only their mouse and receive search suggestions in floating windows while remaining on Yahoo properties such as Yahoo Mail. This feature was only active on Yahoo web pages or pages within the Yahoo Publisher Network. Yahoo Shortcuts required the content-owner to modify the underlying HTML of his or her webpage to call out the specific keywords to be enhanced. The technology for context-aware selection-based search on Yahoo pages was first developed by Reiner Kraft.  SearchScan  SearchScan in action On May 11, 2008, Yahoo introduced SearchScan.

For many decades the lowest radio frequency band allocated for use by amateur radio, before the adoption, at the beginning of the 21st century in most countries, of the 630- and 2200-meter bands. Older amateur operators often refer to 160 meters as the Top Band\\"Top band\\" possibly refers to the position of 2 MHz very nearly at the top of the medium frequency band (MF); it is the highest amateur band within MF. It is also sometimes referred to as the \\"Gentleman's Band\\" in contrast to the often- freewheeling activity in the 80- and 20-meter bands. Frequency allocations The International Telecommunication Union currently allocates all frequencies from 1.81–2 MHz to amateur radio operations in ITU Region 1 (Europe, Greenland, Africa, the Middle East west of the Persian Gulf and including Iraq, the former Soviet Union and Mongolia) and 1.8–2 MHz in the rest of the world. History The 160 meter band is the oldest amateur band and was the staple of reliable communication in the earliest days of amateur radio, when almost all communications were over relatively short distances, and typical operating frequencies were below 20 MHz. In the UK 160 meters was the primary band used for mobile operation for many years. Despite many obstacles and threats from commercial and military radio, the efforts of a small number of determined 160 meter operators enabled the band allocation to survive. =Origin= The band was allocated on a worldwide basis by the International Radiotelegraph Conference in Washington, D.C., on 4 October 1927. The allocation at that time was 1.715–2 MHz. =Cut-backs= The International Radio Conference of Atlantic City reduced the allocation to 1.8–2 MHz under the provision that amateurs must not interfere with LORAN operation. As the high frequency (HF) bands were developed in mid-1920s – along with their smaller, more feasible antennas – 160 meters fell into a period of relative disuse. Although there has always been activity on the band, fewer and fewer hams are willing (or able, due to lack of sufficient real estate) to put up the antennas necessary to take advantage of the band's unique properties. For most amateurs, the HF bands are much easier to use, and HF antennas need a lot less real estate. During World War II all amateur radio licenses were suspended, prohibiting amateur transmission on any radio band. =Gradual restoration= After World War II, it first seemed that the 160-meter band was not coming back, since a large part of the U.S. 160 meter band was allocated on a primary basis to the LORAN radio-navigation system that began operating in and around the 160-meter band in 1942. Amateurs were relegated to secondary, non-interfering status, with severe regional power limitations and restricted day/night operations on just a few narrow segments of the band. Many older hams recall, with no great fondness, the ear-shattering buzz-saw racket of high power LORAN stations that began in 1942 until LORAN-A was phased out in North America on 31 December 1980, and most of the world by 1985. LORAN-A was still operating in China and Japan in 1995. Great ingenuity was used to eliminate the pulse noise of the powerful LORAN-A transmitters through such famous circuitry as the \\"Select-O-Ject\\" of the late 1950s. The technology was adapted to modern noise blanking circuits used in current amateur receivers and transceivers. =Current= The band experienced a resurgence with the demise of LORAN-A in the United States in December 1980, and the removal of power restrictions below 1.9 MHz soon thereafter. Power restrictions above 1.9 MHz were removed in March 1984, and 160 meters was then no longer regarded as the \\"abandoned\\" band, as it had been for more than half a century. Also, with the 21st century allocation of two more bands at lower frequencies, 160 meters is no longer the only mediumwave band, and no longer the lowest-frequency amateur band. Technical characteristics 160 meters is populated by many dedicated experimenters, as it is a proving ground for ingenuity in antenna design and operating technique. It also serves as a \\"training-ground\\" for the 630m and 2200m bands, where logistical and technical demands are even more extreme. =Size, power, and safety= Effective operation on 160 meters can be more challenging than most other amateur bands, because of the overwhelmingly large sizes required for efficient antennas. Full-sized antennas (on the order of a quarter-wavelength or more) are over 130 feet for monopoles, which is also the recommended height for mounting a horizontal dipole antenna, and half-square loops reach nearly 70 feet high. That much real estate may not be feasible for many amateurs, and even with space available, erecting and securing such a large structure is a challenge. The size of the safety zone around an antenna depends on several factors, including the power fed to the antenna, but is roughly 30–40 m (100–130 ft) from the center of the lowest radiating part of the antenna. If high power is used to compensate for an under-sized antenna, even a small antenna will require a full-sized safety zone around it, free of people and animals. Nevertheless, many radio amateurs successfully communicate over very long distances with relatively small antennas. =Propagation= During the day propagation is limited to local contacts, but long distance contacts are possible at night, especially around sunrise and sunset and during periods of sunspot minima. Much about ionospheric and propagation on 160 meters is still not completely understood. Phenomena such as \\"chordal hop\\" propagation are frequently observed, as well as other unexplained long-distance propagation mechanisms. Inexplicable radio blackouts occur on 160 meters – sometimes also on the AM broadcast band. Many of these phenomena have been investigated in the scientific community also.

Set in the haunted Nemeton Monastery in Wales, the plot follows protagonists Koudelka Iasant, Edward Plunkett and Bishop James O'Flaherty as they uncover Nemeton's secrets and confront monsters created from its dark past. Its gameplay blends exploration and puzzle elements with turn-based battles waged on a grid. Koudelka was created by Hiroki Kikuta, a former employee of Square who formed Sacnoth with other Square staff members in 1997 to develop the game. Kikuta was its director, producer, writer and composer. The staff travelled to Wales for research, and all dialogue was spoken in English. The traditional turn-based battle system was created without Kikuta's involvement, due to staff disputes. The game, which received mixed reviews from critics, was the foundation of Sacnoth's Shadow Hearts series.  Gameplay  The main protagonist, Koudelka, in the game's opening battle. Koudelka is a role-playing video game (RPG) set in the fictional Nemeton Mansion. Controlling Koudelka Iasant, the main protagonist, the player explores Nemeton. Gameplay is divided between event scenes, in which story sequences play; exploration, incorporating puzzle-solving; and a battle screen where players fight monsters spawned in Nemeton. Exploration is similar to the early Resident Evil games; Koudelka—rendered as a 3D character model—explores environments created with pre-rendered backgrounds shown through fixed camera angles. Items and weapons are found in the environment or gained after a battle, with the number of items which can be carried limited. Combat is triggered through random encounters, with battles governed by a turn-based system. The three playable characters and the enemy are positioned on a grid, able to move to a new square and perform an action with each turn. Each party has access to physical and magical attacks and other abilities, such as status effects, healing magic and the ability to escape from battle. Each player character can equip any of a variety of weapons, which break after being used a number of times. At the end of each successful battle, the party gains experience points (raising their experience level) and ability points (to increase attributes, such as agility and speed). Depending on usage, weapons and abilities increase in power as their skill level rises with use.  Synopsis  In 1898, near Aberystwyth, Wales, Romani psychic Koudelka Iasant (Vivianna Bateman) is drawn to Nemeton. A former medieval monastery, it was converted into a mansion and is now infested with monsters. Koudelka breaks into Nemeton, losing her magic pendant in the process, and saves wayward adventurer Edward Plunkett (Michael Bradberry) from a monster attack. They are offered hospitality by the mansion's caretakers, Ogden (Gavin Carlton) and Bessy Hartman (Denise White). Their food is poisoned, and Koudelka—having detected the poison and refused to eat—cures Edward. Exploring Nemeton, they meet Catholic bishop James O'Flaherty (Scott Larson); James refuses to believe that the Hartmans are responsible for the deaths, since they did not try to poison him. They also encounter the ghost of Charlotte D'lota (Sara Paxton), a young girl who was executed in Nemeton, and are attacked by an intruder named Alias (Rob Brownstein). From visions, human remains and confiscated artefacts, Koudelka learns that Nemeton was a prison for dissidents that now haunt the mansion. They learn from Alias that he survived the Hartmans' attempt to kill him and the mansion's monsters, and saw the Hartmans kill anyone who trespassed in the mansion. Admitting that he tried to kill them to keep Nemeton's treasures for himself, Edward kills Alias because he is a threat. Koudelka discovers a room full of paintings of the destroyed SS Princess Alice and has a vision of Elaine Heyworth (Kim Weild), wife of current owner Patrick (Keith Barry). The group finds the apparently-dead Roger Bacon (Brian Kojac), who briefly revives and mentions the Émigré Document, in the library. James says that he was sent by the Vatican to recover the Émigré Document, a book of Celtic rituals to gain immortality and revive the dead. James was asked by the Hartmans to save Patrick, who stole the Émigré Document. Koudelka is separated from the group when a monster attacks them, and finds the room where Ogden killed his victims. Ogden captures her and rants about his guilt for the Princess Alice disaster, but Bessy shoots him before he can kill Koudelka. Before shooting herself, Bessy explains that Odgen killed intruders to avenge Elaine, who was killed by a thief. After meeting Bacon and rejoining the others, Koudelka decides that something else was driving the Hartmans and spawning the monsters. James says that he and Patrick courted Elaine, but James' social background prevented a marriage and he joined the church to ease his pain. Confronted by Charlotte, Koudelka finds letters written by Charlotte's mother which Charlotte never received; learning that her mother loved her, Charlotte passes on. The group rejoins Bacon, who achieved imperfect immortality after learning the Émigré Document's secrets while copying it for the Vatican. Koudelka summons Elaine's spirit, and they learn that Patrick used the Émigré Document to resurrect Elaine; they resurrected her body as a monster, which caused the events at the mansion. Elaine—who summoned Koudelka to aid her—asks them to destroy her body so her spirit can be free. Bacon tells the group how to do this, in a section of Nemeton which has been converted into a temple. The three enter the temple and find Patrick's body. James destroys the temple, starting a fire which begins consuming the building. Depending on the player's actions, three different endings are unlocked. If Koudelka does not regain her pendant, they are killed when they confront Elaine and the game is over. If she finds the pendant, Koudelka uses it to block Elaine's attack and they are cornered in the mansion's bell tower. If the party defeats Elaine, they contemplate the situation as the sun rises over the ruined mansion. If Elaine defeats them, James sacrifices himself to destroy Elaine, and Koudelka and Edward escape the collapsing tower. After spending the night together they part, although Koudelka believes that they will meet again.  Development  Hiroki Kikuta (pictured in 2011) was heavily involved in the game's development, acting as producer, director, writer and composer. Koudelka was created by Hiroki Kikuta, who composed Secret of Mana, Seiken Densetsu 3 and Soukaigi at Square. Kikuta wanted to direct his own game, but Square's corporate structure prevented him from moving beyond a composer. Searching for a way to expand his role, Kikuta was introduced to the chairman of SNK; during their talk, he outlined many perceived pitfalls in the role-playing genre. Leaving Square, he formed Sacnoth in 1997 with other Square employees and SNK's funding. As Sacnoth's CEO and the game's main creative lead, Kikuta wanted to create a horror RPG. Koudelka began development after Sacnoth was founded, and Kikuta was its producer, director, writer and composer. Although Koudelka used turn- based combat on a grid and random encounters (similar to traditional RPGs), this was not Kikuta's original intention. He originally planned a real-time battle system with free movement within the environment, combining mechanics from simulation and adventure games. Interactive environments, such as furniture, were also planned to play a part in combat. Kikuta wanted to break away from RPG conventions, but other Sacnoth staff were reluctant to follow his example and retained traditional ideas from Square. Kikuta later regretted his lack of direct influence on the game design. About the battle-system design, art director Matsuzo Machida (credited as Matsuzo Itakura) said that it was designed to be easy so adults who did not normally play games could see the game's ending; in hindsight, the team could have increased the challenge. The game had English voice work for all characters, with Japan using native subtitles rather than a Japanese dub. To create an authentic atmosphere, Kikuta used advanced motion capture technology to give realistic physical mannerisms to the character models during cutscenes. Kikuta's decision to use motion capture, which he called \\"epoch-making\\", was part of his attempt to move away from RPG conventions by adding drama. The story required the capture of up to four people in each scene, impossible with technology available in Japan. Through the original staff of Soukaigi, Kikuta contacted Santa Monica- based special-effects company FutureLight. Intrigued by Kikuta's concept, FutureLight agreed to help record the cutscenes. In a later interview, he said that the techniques used for the motion-capture sessions were on a par with those used by Hollywood studios at the time. The game's cast provided motion capture and character voices. They were chosen from 100 actors who auditioned for the roles, including the twelve-year-old Sara Paxton as Charlotte. Vivianna Bateman, who played Koudelka, was chosen to give her character a cool, \\"unique\\" air. Kikuta called Edward's actor, Michael Bradberry, the \\"mood maker\\" for recording. The motion-capture sessions took place in January 1998 at FutureLight's local studios. The motion capture and animation processes were handled by FutureLight and Sacnoth staff, with Kikuta the sessions' executive producer. Rehearsals, supervised by Kikuta, were held in a nearby hotel. The recording sessions were in a converted sound studio; since the studio was not fully soundproofed, recording was sometimes halted due to exterior noises. Equipment around the soundstage was used as props for the actors, so the in-game immersion would not be broken. =Scenario and art design= According to Kikuta, his research for the narrative and the basic elements of Koudelka took three months; the one-night timescale and singular location were due to the game's limited staff and development time. Aberystwyth was chosen because he wanted a location across the sea from Ireland. Due to a lack of Japanese resources on British architecture, Kikuta and several staff members made a research trip to Pembrokeshire to see local scenery and church architecture. The region's coastal cliffs, ancient ruins and weather conditions influenced Koudelka setting and design. Kikuta's choice of 1898 was influenced by his wish for a story blending realism and fantasy; the end of the 19th century symbolised, to him, the intermingling of superstition and the next century's technological advances. Kikuta wanted to explore the uneasy coexistence of magic and science in the game. He bought over 100 books on British history during his research, from the medieval to the Victorian eras. His inspirations for the story included Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose (and its film adaptation), William Hope Hodgson's Carnacki, the Ghost-Finder, H. P. Lovecraft's The Case of Charles Dexter Ward and novels by Lord Dunsany. Koudelka setting and story were primarily inspired by Carnacki, the Ghost-Finder. Kikuta incorporated a number of historical events and figures, including the sinking of the Princess Alice and fictionalized versions of Lord Dunsany and Roger Bacon. Charlotte's mother was based on Sophia Dorothea of Celle. The story also included references to Celtic, Irish and Welsh mythology and folklore. Its characters were designed by Yūji Iwahara, who created over 100 character sketches for the game. The visuals were inspired by the work of Bob Carlos Clarke, Jan Saudek and Holly Warburton. Koudelka was among the first elements of the game created by Kikuta, with Iwahara's first character drafts created in March 1998. Koudelka's given name was taken from photographer Josef Koudelka; Kikuta liked its mysterious sound and lack of any specific ethnic origin. Kikuta's wish for a lonely character resulted in Koudelka's background as an exiled gypsy. Her design required several redrafts to be carried over into the game, which had severe polygon and memory restrictions. Machida's design of Nemeton was intended to compress the variety of a typical RPG world map into a limited exploration space and permit detailed backgrounds within the console's hardware limitations. Nemeton used a blend of architectural styles, with elements ranging from its origins as a Gothic monastery (inspired by St Davids) to contemporary additions. Koudelka's CGI model was created by Sacnoth and a company founded by artist Nobuji Watanabe, whom Kikuta chose for his passion for good work. The model went through multiple redrafts, with Kikuta making adjustments. In creating Koudelka storyline, Kikuta conceived a potential four-part series following her family through the 20th century with events and themes from the original clash of science and magic. In the first sequel, Koudelka would attend the 1900 Exposition Universelle; the second would move to Chicago in 1973 during the late Vietnam War and follow Koudelka's grandson, Rodmell, through an urban fantasy scenario. In the third, Rodmell would travel to Kyoto in 1984, where magic and modern life were still closely connected. =Music= Kikuta found composing the score the easiest part of development, since he primarily worked on his own. His concept for Koudelka musical elements were created with the setting and narrative. The score was arranged by Kikuta and Nick Ingman. To compose the most of the game's tracks, Kikuta used Atari Notator sound software. While he found lack of compression an issue, the better sequencing software was useful in creating the score for the CGI cutscenes. With less music than the average RPG, the score was completed within six months. Instead of the looping tracks of Kikuta's work with Square, Koudelka used ambient sounds and short tracks related to cutscenes outside battle themes, and featured influences from church music. Its opening theme \\"Requiem\\" was performed by Catherine Bott. The ending theme \\"Ubi Caritas et amor\\"—taken from a larger composition by Maurice Duruflé—was performed by the London Oratory School. A CD soundtrack album was released in December 1999 by Pony Canyon and Scitron Digital Contents, with over an hour of music and 34 tracks. The album, which included all tracks from the game and live versions of three battle themes (arranged by Naoya Akimoto), received generally-positive reviews from music critics. Its music was praised and criticized by reviewers of the game. Release Koudelka and its publisher, SNK, were first announced in September 1999. As part of its marketing campaign, a music CD and promotional poster were offered as pre- order bonuses. The game was released in Japan on December 16, 1999, and was scheduled for a Western release by Electronic Arts. It was later announced that Infogrames would publish the title in North America and Europe. It was released overseas in 2000: on June 29 in North America, and September 27 in Europe. In addition to the PlayStation version, Sacnoth were reportedly developing a version for the Neo Geo Pocket Color. Console Classics announced plans in 2015 to port Koudelka to Microsoft Windows via Steam. =Adaptations= The first of a three-volume manga adaptation, written and illustrated by Iwahara, was published in November 1999 by Kadokawa Shoten; the third volume was published in September 2000. The manga was intended to tie into Kikuta's planned sequel. A novelization, Koudelka - The Mansion's Scream by Nahoko Korekata, was published by ASCII Media Works in February 2000 as part of its Famitsu Bunko imprint. An audio drama based on the game, with Japanese actors and excerpts from its score, was released in November 1999 by Scitron Digital Contents.  Reception  The Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu compared Koudelka atmosphere to Western horror films. A GamePro reviewer could not follow the game's story, an issue magnified by its slow pace. GameSpots Ike Sato called the story \\"quite entertaining\\", and David Zdyrko of IGN enjoyed its cinematic tone. RPGamers Jake Alley praised the game's tone, presentation and localization. According to Ken Chu of RPGFan, the story \\"fails to inspire more than a passing interest\\" despite its strong characters and unconventional use of horror. GamePro found the turn-based battles too slow for enjoyment, a sentiment echoed by the Dutch magazine Power Unlimited. Sato was generally disappointed by difficulty and balance issues. Zdyrko faulted several mechanics, such as saving and equipment limitations. Alley found the mixture of gameplay styles strange, faulted the game's weapons limitations and praised its innovative take on RPG mechanics. Chu criticized the gameplay, finding several aspects unbalanced or poorly designed. The game's slow pace was a recurring complaint by reviewers. Although Famitsu praised Koudelka CGI movies and art design, one of its reviewers found some areas too dark to navigate easily. GamePro lauded the game's environment and character design, and Sato enjoyed its CGI cutscenes and real-time graphics. Zdyrko praised the graphics (despite their dark tone), and Alley called them \\"wonderful\\". Chu disliked the in-game graphics, but enjoyed the CGI segments; Power Unlimited also praised the cutscenes. Eric Bratcher reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"A solid horror title that could have become a great game with more suspense and a few tweaks. Still, its unique feel makes it worth a look.\\"  Legacy  Sacnoth is one of a group of video-game companies—with Monolith Soft, Love-de-Lic and Mistwalker—founded by Square staff who had worked on notable titles produced during the 1990s. After Koudelka release, Kikuta resigned as the company's CEO and founded a music label; his planned sequels, continuing the story of Koudelka's family, were never produced. Sacnoth developed Shadow Hearts, a role-playing game for the PlayStation 2 and the first instalment of the Shadow Hearts series. Shadow Hearts is set in the same reality as Koudelka, taking place after the latter ends. Sacnoth produced two more Shadow Hearts titles (Covenant and From the New World) before it was merged into company owner Aruze in 2007 and ceased video game production.

It is also the administrative headquarters of Saharanpur district. Saharanpur city's name was given after the \\"Shakumbri Devi\\" mata's name. A very famous temple of \\"Shakumbri Devi\\" is situated in Saharanpur. Lakhs of pilgrims visits the temple during navrtaras. Some peoples says that It was founded by Sah Ranbirsingh, a Jain nobleman, who laid the foundations of the present-day city on the site of an army cantonment. Saharanpur is declared as one amongst the 100 Smart Cities by MOUD as a part of Smart Cities Mission. HistoryMaratha rule (1757–1803 AD)= In 1757, the Maratha Army invaded the Saharanpur region, which resulted in Najeeb-ud-Daula losing control of Saharanpur to the Maratha rulers Raghunath Rao and Malharao Holkar. The conflict between Rohillas and Marathas came to an end on 18December 1788 with the arrest of Ghulam Qadir, the grandson of Najeeb-ud-Daula, who was defeated by the Maratha general Mahadaji Scindia. The most significant contribution of Nawab Ghulam Qadir to Saharanpur city is the Nawab Ganj area and the Ahmedabadi fortress therein, which still stands. The death of Ghulam Qadir put an end to the Rohilla administration in Saharanpur and it became the northernmost district of the Maratha Empire. Ghani Bahadur Banda was appointed its first Maratha governor. The Maratha Regime saw the construction of the Bhuteshwar Temple and Bagheshwar Temple in Saharanpur city. In 1803, following the Second Anglo-Maratha War, when British East India Company defeated the Maratha Empire, Saharanpur came under British suzerainty. =British colonial period (1803–1947 AD)= When India rebelled in 1857 against the foreign Company's occupation, now referred to as the First War of Indian Independence, the Saharanpur and the present-day Muzaffarnagar Districts were part of that uprising. The centre of freedom fighters' operations was Shamli, a small town in the Muzaffarnagar region which was liberated for some time. After the uprising failed, British retribution was severe. Death and destruction were particularly directed against Muslims of the region, whom the British considered as the main instigators of the rebellion; Muslim society was devastated beyond recognition. When social reconstruction started, the cultural and political history of Muslims began to revolve around Deoband and Aligarh. Maulana Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi and Maulana Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, both proponents of the reformer Shah Waliullah's ideology for social and political rejuvenation, established a school in Deoband in 1867. It found popularity and global recognition as the Darul Uloom. Its founders' mission was twofold: to raise and spread a team of scholars able to awaken the religious and social consciousness of Muslims through peaceful methods and to make efforts, through them, to educate Muslims in their faith and culture; and to bring about a feeling of nationalism and national unity by promoting the concept of Hindu- Muslim unity and a united India. Muslim scholars in the city of Saharanpur were active supporters of this ideology and went on to establish the Mazahirul Uloom Saharanpur theological seminary six months later. Geography Saharanpur is located at , about south-southeast of Chandigarh, north- northeast of Delhi, north-northeast of Shamli and about south-west of Dehradun. It has an average elevation of . Saharanpur is a part of a geographical doab region. Saharanpur district join four states together Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Haryana. Demographics Provisional 2011 census data indicates that Saharanpur has a population of 7,05,478, out of which males were 3,71,740 and females were 3,33,738. The literacy rate was 76.32%.  Government and politics  Saharanpur city is governed by Saharanpur Municipal Corporation, erstwhile Municipal Council. The city is divided into 4 zones and 70 wards, represented by 70 councillors who were elected by municipal or local elections in 2017 for a five-year term. The head of the administrative wing is the Municipal Commissioner, currently Gyanendra Singh while the head of the elected wing is the Mayor Sanjeev Walia from the BJP. The city is also part of the Saharanpur Lok Sabha constituency, which elected Haji Fazlur Rehman from the Bahujan Samaj Party in 2019 as the Member of Parliament, and part of the Saharanpur Assembly constituency that elected Masood Akhtar from the Indian National Congress in 2017 as the MLA. = Civic utilities = There is only one sewage treatment plant located in Saharanpur, while most of the waste water is discharged into the Hindon river, further polluting it. CulturePlaces of interest= The Saharanpur Botanical Gardens, known as the Company Garden and once the preserve of British East India Company, is one of the oldest existing gardens in India, dating to before 1750. Then named Farahat-Bakhsh, it was originally a pleasure ground set out by a local chief, Intazam ud-ullah. In 1817, it was acquired by the British East India CompanySharad Singh Negi, Biodiversity and its conservation in India 2nd revised ed. New Delhi, Indus Publishing (2008) and placed under the authority of the District Surgeon. Joseph Dalton Hooker says of this Botanical Garden that \\"Amongst its greatest triumphs may be considered the introduction of the tea-plant from China, a fact I allude to, as many of my English readers may not be aware that the establishment of the tea-trade in the Himalaya and Assam is almost entirely the work of the superintendents of the gardens of Calcutta and Seharunpore.\\"\\"Joseph Dalton Hooker, Himalayan Journals, or Notes of a Naturalist ..., Kew (1854), vol. I, p. 5. In 1887, when the Botanical Survey of India was set up to reform the country's botanical sciences, Saharanpur became the centre for the survey of the northern Indian flora. The Garden is seen historically as being second only to the Calcutta Gardens for its contribution to science and economy in India. Under private auspices today, it is full of greenery and has many different kinds of plants and flowers.Saharanpur Botanic Garden Saharanpur falls on the route of the proposed Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor project.Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor ReferencesExternal links Category:Cities and towns in Saharanpur district Category:Cities in Uttar Pradesh ","title":"Saharanpur"},{"id":"1620035","text":"Alhucemas is a Spanish name which may refer to: *The Moroccan Rif city of Al Hoceima *The Spanish Alhucemas Islands, including Peñón de Alhucemas ","title":"Alhucemas"},{"id":"1620036","title":"Videogame Rating Council"},{"id":"1620042","text":"A memorial society may refer to: *A society established in memory of someone or something, e.g.: **Memorial (society), an international historical and civil rights society that operates in a number of post-USSR states **Sardar Amir Azam Memorial Society, founded in 1977 for paying tribute to Pakistani politician Sardar Amir Azam for his achievements **Komsomolets Nuclear Submarine Memorial Society, a charitable nonprofit organization providing assistance to the families of Soviet and Russian submariners lost at sea **Hasrat Mohani Memorial Society, founded in 1951 to commemorate Hasrat Mohani (1875–1951), Indian activist in the Indian Independence Movement and noted poet of the Urdu language **Alexander Galich Memorial Society, founded in 2003 to commemorate Alexander Galich (writer) (1918–1977), Soviet poet, screenwriter, playwright, singer-songwriter, and dissident *A funeral consumer organization, e.g.: **Funeral Consumers Alliance **People's Memorial Association ","title":"Memorial society"},{"id":"1620056","text":"Seidel may refer to: *Seidel (surname) *Seidel (crater), on the Moon *Seidel Band Instrument Company, a short-lived American company *Seidel Creek, a stream in Pennsylvania ","title":"Seidel"},{"id":"1620064","text":"Portrait engraving (Bibliothèque Nationale de France) François Leclerc du Tremblay is the figure in black, depicted descending the staircase in this oil painting (1873) by Jean-Léon Gérôme. François Leclerc du Tremblay (4 November 1577 – 17 December 1638), also known as Père Joseph, was a French Capuchin friar, confidant and agent of Cardinal Richelieu. He was the original éminence grise—the French term (\\"grey eminence\\") for a powerful advisor or decision- maker who operates secretly or unofficially. Biography Leclerc was the eldest son of Jean Leclerc du Tremblay, president of the chamber of requests of the parlement of Paris, and of Marie Motier de Lafayette. As a boy he received a careful classical training, and in 1595 made an extended journey through Italy, returning to take up the career of arms. He served at the Siege of Amiens in 1597 and then accompanied a special embassy to London. In 1599, under the name Baron de Mafflier, by which he was known at court, he renounced the world and entered the Capuchin priory of Orléans. He embraced the religious life with great ardour, and became a notable preacher and reformer. In 1606 he helped Antoinette d'Orléans, a nun of Fontevrault, found the reformed order of the Filles du Calvaire, and he wrote a manual of devotion for the nuns. His proselytizing zeal led him to send missionaries to the centres of the Huguenot movement. He entered politics at the Conferences of Loudun. There, as the confidant of the queen and the papal envoy, he opposed the Gallicanism advanced by the parlement. He succeeded in convincing the princes that the stance harbored schismatic tendencies and they abandoned their initial support. In 1612 he established those personal relations with Richelieu that established his reputation—and the phrase—éminence grise, though historical research has not been able to document his supposed influence on the latter. The description drew on the grey friar's cloak that Père Joseph wore and the title \\"eminence\\" conferred on Richelieu as a cardinal. In 1627 Père Joseph was present at the siege of La Rochelle. A purely religious reason also made him Richelieu's ally against the Habsburgs. He had a dream of arousing Europe to another crusade against the Ottoman Empire and believed that the Habsburgs were an obstacle to making this possible. For Richelieu, he manoeuvered at the Diet of Regensburg (1630) to thwart the aggression of the Habsburg emperor, and then recommended the intervention of Gustavus Adolphus, and the Protestant armies, thereby maintaining a balance of power. He became a war minister, and, though maintaining a personal austerity of life, devoted himself to diplomacy and politics. He died in 1638, just as he was to be made a cardinal. The story that Richelieu visited him when on his deathbed and roused the dying man by the words, \\"Courage, Father Joseph, we have won Breisach\\", is apocryphal.

Early life and career Morton was born and raised in Dewsbury, West Riding of Yorkshire, where his father ran a picture framing business. He attended Leeds Grammar School and Sussex University where he studied history. After university, Morton became a tabloid journalist and worked for three London tabloids, the Daily Star, News of the World, and Daily Mail, until 1987. =Biography of Diana, Princess of Wales= Andrew Morton wrote a biography of Diana, Princess of Wales called Diana: Her True Story. In 1993 it was made into a television film of the same name, with Serena Scott Thomas as Princess Diana. Following Diana's death in August 1997, Morton issued an edition entitled Diana: Her True Story in Her Own Words in October. =Biography of Monica Lewinsky= Morton received public attention after Diana's death, when he revealed the extent of her collaborations with him. He achieved greater prominence in the United States after the publication of Monica's Story. =Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography= Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography was published in January 2008, and reprinted with an update in February 2009. In a review in The New York Times, Janet Maslin writes \\"Mr. Morton has found a number of former Scientologists who are willing to speak freely, and in some cases vengefully, about the group's purported inner workings. Mr. Morton's eagerness to include their voices leads him to push the limits of responsible reporting.\\" Maslin adds that Morton \\"provides a credible portrait extrapolated from the actor's on-the-record remarks and highly visible public behavior.\\" Writing in Entertainment Weekly, Mark Harris gives the book a grade of \\"C-\\", and says \\"Cruise emerges from Morton's takedown moderately scratched but as uncracked as ever.\\" Another review in The New York Times by Ada Calhooun stated: > However shady Scientology may be, Morton's language in Tom Cruise: An > Unauthorized Biography is extreme. He and his sources compare the church and > its leadership to fascists, the Roman Empire, storm troopers, Machiavelli, > Orwell’s Animal Farm, Napoleon, Stalinists and North Korea. He also > repeatedly invokes Nazism, and quotes without censure the German Protestant > Church’s comparison of Cruise to Joseph Goebbels. Teresa Budasi of the Chicago Sun-Times describes the book as \\"fascinating\\", although Budasi also raises a \\"question as to what's true and what isn’t.\\" Budasi sums up her impression of the work, writing \\"Morton's book is as much an indictment on Cruise's chosen faith as it is the life story of one of the world's biggest movie stars. And by the end you realize that 'Scientologist' is what will end up being the role of his lifetime.\\" In a review in The Buffalo News, Jeff Simon writes of the author: \\"To give Morton the credit he’s clearly due: he is one of the best around at constructing a 250-page gossip column.\\" Upon its publication, Cruise's lawyer and the Church of Scientology released statements questioning the truthfulness of assertions made by Morton in the book. In a 15-page statement released to the press, the Church of Scientology calls the book \\"a bigoted, defamatory assault replete with lies\\". The book was not published in the UK, Australia, or New Zealand due to strict libel laws in those countries. =Biography of Prince William and Catherine Middleton= On 16 November 2010, Prince William announced his engagement to Catherine Middleton. Morton was commissioned by Michael O'Mara Books to write a book to coincide with the royal wedding on 29 April 2011. The book, which went on sale on 3 May 2011 in the UK, includes a detailed biography of Prince William, as well as details of his relationship with Catherine Middleton. The book features full-colour photos of Prince William and the couple, as well as a detailed section on the wedding itself. =Other publications= After Monica's Story, Morton investigated a mining disaster, which led to his first non-royal journalistic account, Nine for Nine: The Pennsylvania Mine Rescue Miracle. He also wrote an authorised biography of Kenyan president Daniel arap Moi. The book resulted in a libel case brought against Morton by a Kenyan judge – Morton lost the case and was ordered to pay £45,700 in damages.\\"Morton moves on from legal defeat with life of Cruise\\", The Evening Standard, 20 October 2005 Morton then moved on to the \\"king and queen of pop culture\\", as he termed them, David Beckham and his wife Victoria. Posh and Becks became a #1 best-seller in the UK, but received little attention in the United States. Soon after, Morton announced that he would be taking on the \\"queen of pop\\", Madonna. Despite a seven-figure advance by St. Martin's Press and a 500,000-copy first printing, Madonna failed to make waves in North America, where it spent only two weeks on The New York Times best-seller list (peaking at No. 8). By contrast, J. Randy Taraborrelli's Madonna: An Intimate Biography, released at the same time, became a massive best-seller in the United Kingdom (although it only made The New York Times extended best-seller list). Morton subsequently wrote another Diana book titled In Pursuit of Love, with information that he had left unaddressed, which made The New York Times best-seller list. Morton also wrote an unauthorized biography of Angelina Jolie. Janet Maslin highlighted the lack of sources noted in the book in a review in The New York Times, saying \\"the people most eager to tell him about Ms. Jolie are people who don’t know her, so that the book is shrink-wrapped in glib insights from dubious psychiatric talents\\". Allen Barra described it as \\"the worst book in the 21st century so far\\" in a Salon review which summarized the book as \\"ill-informed, moralistic and just plain mean\\". In April 2018, he published Meghan: A Hollywood Princess about Meghan Markle, who married Prince Harry a month later in May 2018.

He was promoted to department manager in 1975. He moved to Aramco's Power Systems department in 1977, where he began a series of leadership assignments and worked closely with the development of the Saudi Consolidated Electric Company (SCECO) for the Eastern Province - SCECO-East. He was appointed to his first executive position at Aramco in 1981 as vice president of the power systems division and concurrently served as the first Saudi Managing Director of SCECO-East. In 1984, he became Aramco's vice president of government affairs and then promoted to senior vice president of industrial relations in 1988.

In this capacity, he gained considerable experience in marketing, industrial relations, and negotiations on an international level. He led the company's downstream expansion, or international distribution of Saudi Aramco's products; his stated goals were to \\"protect and potentially increase the market share of Arabian crude, maximize the revenues from the sale of Arabian crude, and provide secure outlets through strategic alliances with refining companies in our major markets\\" .

He was born in Eisenach, into a family of musicians. His father, Johann Christian Hertel (1697–1754) was Konzertmeister (from 1733) and director of music at the Eisenach court, while his grandfather, Jakob Christian Hertel (c. 1667-c. 1726), had been Kapellmeister in Oettingen and later Merseburg. At an early age Johann Wilhelm accompanied his father, an accomplished viol player, on tour at the harpsichord. He also learned the violin, which he studied with Franz Benda. In 1742 he came with his father to Mecklenburg-Strelitz where he was active playing both instruments. Among his pupils there was Carl Friedrich Christian Fasch (1736–1800). After further music studies in Zerbst and Berlin, Hertel moved to the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, where he made a successful career, initially as principal and later becoming court composer, and likewise undertaking teaching. During the reign of Duke Christian Ludwig II, Hertel wrote primarily representative instrumental music, while during the reign of his successor, Frederick II (called 'the pious') he focused on sacred music. In 1770 he was appointed court counsellor and served also as private secretary to princess Ulrike. He died in Schwerin. Hertel wrote a great number of symphonies, solo concertos, harpsichord sonatas, songs, hymns, cantatas, and oratorios. He is considered an important representative of the 'emotional style' of the German pre-classic.

Honoured as an officer of the Order of Australia, he was a six-time recipient of the Gold Logie, including the Logie Hall of Fame award, and won the Star of the Year Award in 1959. He is the most awarded star of Australian television. He was often referred to as \\"The King\\" or the \\"King of Australian television\\". He was best known for his collaborations with Australian entertainer Bert Newton and American-born television personality Don Lane. Early lifeChildhood= Kennedy was born in Camden Street, Balaclava to Cyril William Kennedy and Mary Austen Kennedy (née Scott). Kennedy's mother, who was 18 years old at the time of his birth,Blundell (2003), p. 9 was employed at a local picture theatre. His father worked variously as an engineer and handyman, mowed lawns and washed cars. In 1939 he joined the RAAF as an air gunner.Blundell (2003), p. 11 Kennedy's first home was a \\"small, crowded duplex\\" at 32 Nelson Street, Balaclava. A 20 cm diameter plaque was placed on the property by the City of Port Phillip, coincidentally in the week of Kennedy's death. When Kennedy was two years old, his parents moved to Carlisle Street, St Kilda, for two years. His parents divorced shortly before World War II and Kennedy was largely raised by his grandparents, \\"Pop\\" Kennedy (who had been an electrician at Melbourne's Tivoli, Royal and Bijou theatres) and \\"Grandma Scott\\", to whom he remained particularly close until her death. Kennedy later said that he had: > often wished his mother and father had never married. 'I wasn't enamoured of > either of them [...] they betrayed me [...] divorce is not too much fun for > a little nine-year-old [...]Blundell (2003), p. 351 After Kennedy's death, an article in The Bulletin by his friend and colleague John Mangos recorded that: > ... he would sometimes talk about the violent arguments between his parents, > how he gravitated to his grandmother's bosom, his two uncles (\\"one fought > the Germans, the other fought the Japs\\") and how one of them took liberties > with the boy. Graham never resented him, claiming he equated it with > affection. = Education = Kennedy was educated firstly at Euston College (which no longer exists) on the corner of Chapel and Carlisle streets, secondly at Caulfield North Central School (now Caulfield Junior College) and finally at Melbourne High School, South Yarra. In 1977, Kennedy chaired a project to raise funds for improvements at Melbourne High which raised more than $100,000 in its first year. = After school = During a school break in 1949, Kennedy worked at his uncle's hairdressing shop at 475 Collins Street, where he met clients who worked in the same building for the Radio Australia shortwave service of the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC). He accepted a job as a news runner from Collins Street to the ABC studios in Lonsdale Street. Shortly after he joined radio station 3UZ, working in the station's record library.Blundell (2003), p. 28. The MHSOBA obituary records that his report card states \\"he was employed by Radio Australia (Short-wave Division) at 475 Collins Street Melbourne after leaving school. However, during 4th form at Melbourne High School, he worked as a messenger at the ABC on Wednesday nights from 5 pm to 11 pm.\\" Radio career3UZ and \\"Nicky\\"= Melbourne's most popular commercial radio personality was arguably Clifford \\"Nicky\\" Nicholls Whitta. A radio performer since 1932, he presented a popular housewives' program, as well as \\"Chatterbox Corner\\" with his wife Nancy Lee (Kathleen Lindgren). In an era when Australian radio announcers routinely adopted false British accents and a \\"hard sell\\" approach to advertisements, Whitta's authentic Australian voice and irreverent attitude towards his sponsors made him the idol of his audience. By the early 1950s a newspaper survey found that more than 70 per cent of Melbourne housewives tuned into his show. In his foreword to Nancy Lee's book Being a Chum Was Fun (1979) Kennedy wrote: > About 40 years ago, when I was a snow haired six year old, I can remember > being totally captivated by a grown man pretending to be a naughty little > boy on 3AW's children session called \\"Chatterbox Corner\\". His name was > Clifford Whitta, and he was to become the most important man in my life. > Years later I was even more fascinated with this man when he conducted a > breakfast program and let the boy who played his records actually talk on > the air with him. Nicholls moved from 3KZ to 3UZ (where Kennedy was working), bringing with him his teenage panel operators Alf \\"Alfie Boy\\" Thesinger and Russell Archer. However, eighteen-year-olds, Thesinger and Archer were \\"called up\\" (conscripted) for National Service. Nancy Lee's book records: > I asked Nicky, \\"Have you decided on anyone to help you in the session yet?\\" > When I heard the chosen one was to be young Graham, I was surprised. \\"Oh, > no, not Graham! [...] he's a nice boy, but he can't talk.\\" Nick said, \\"Mum, > leave him to me.\\"Lee, Nancy (1979), p. 149. Nicky became father-figure, personal friend and mentor to Kennedy, and the two built an extraordinary on-air rapport. Kennedy wrote: > Being straight man to one of the greatest entertainers of our time was not > all that easy. We were not always chums. He would spend weeks not talking to > me (except on air) for something I had unknowingly said or done. Once he > even suspended me from the programme for some trivial matter. [...] I worked > with him until his sudden death in 1956. I never stopped being a fan. I did > not realise then that I had been prepared for another career on another > electrical medium: the most potent communication device of the century.Lee, > Nancy (1979), foreword by GK. Elided text: \\"'But it was more than worthwhile > putting up with his various moods and it must be remembered that he in turn > was putting up with a very gauche seventeen year old. And of course, he > taught me so much: how to use radio not just be on it. He took me under his > wing and became a surrogate father. I spend many happy times with him and > his family at his house in Ivanhoe. They were very special occasions for me. > I baby sat for him and Kathy a few times.' Nicky died on 8 September 1956. =Other radio= By May 1957, Kennedy was appearing on television, but also presented a 3AK morning radio program with Bert Newton in 1961–1962, which later originated from a studio built at Kennedy's home in Olivers Hill, Frankston. In 1970 he worked at 3XY; from June to December 1975 he appeared on a 3LO drivetime program with Richard Combe; from September to November 1976 was on 3DB with Denis Scanlan; in 1977 he returned to DB to cover the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II live from London. =RS Playhouse= Kennedy recorded eight thirty-minute radio comedies for the ABC under the title Graham Kennedy's RS Playhouse. Written by Gary Reilly and Tony Sattler (who together wrote the television programs Kingswood Country and The Naked Vicar Show), the shows were broadcast between 11 August and 23 September 1979. The episode titles were: *\\"The Birthday Boy\\" *\\"Because He's My Brother\\" *\\"You Only Live Once\\" *\\"Sunday Morning Fever\\" *\\"The Chocolate Milkman\\" *\\"The Prawnbroker\\" *\\"Mad Jack's Dentist\\" *\\"The Good Morning Show\\" Sattler and his wife (actress Noeline Brown) were two of Kennedy's closest friends. =2Day FM= In 1980 Kennedy became a ten percent shareholder in Sydney radio station 2Day FM and from 24 May 1981 presented a computer-edited, three-hour Sunday morning program of music and comedy.Blundell (2003), pp. 350–351 Television career Kennedy's first television appearance was in March 1957, representing 3UZ on a GTV-9 Red Cross telethon. Viewing his performance on the monitors, GTV-9's general manager Colin Bednall and producer Norman Spencer \\"... turned to one another without exchanging a word and shook hands.\\" \\"'When a full face of Kennedy alone came on the monitor, Spencer and I turned to one another without exchanging a word and shook hands. At the time, we were in desperate need of talent. At a glance, you could see that this boy on camera, with his cheap haircut and popping eyes, had gone to endless pains rehearsing his act and also had outstanding ability. When we talked to Kennedy he made no attempt at playing hard to get. He was busting to get into television.'\\" =In Melbourne Tonight= Bednall and Spencer defied both the GTV-9 boardroom and the first sponsor (Philips) by choosing Kennedy, who began on a salary of £30 for five one-hour evening shows per week to be called In Melbourne Tonight (or IMT) which began on 6 May 1957. Thus the 23-year-old Kennedy began a career of which he later said that he was \\"terrified for forty years\\".Stone (2000), p.93 \\"'I was terrified for forty years is what I can tell you about my career', he says now, confirming the stories told of him having to steel his nerves before almost every performance. 'Well, out of the thousands of television shows and radio shows, once or twice I was quite comfortable, but mostly I was frightened.'\\" The show's theme song, \\"Gee, But You're Swell\\", was written by Abel Baer and Thomas Tobias in 1936. Kennedy was not GTV-9's first choice – they had planned to use either 3UZ personality John McMahon or 3DB's Dick Cranbourne. Despite later reports that the program's name had been intended to be The Late Show, and that rival station HSV-7 beat GTV-9 to the title by one week, contemporary press reports from several weeks before the show's debut list the title as \\"In Melbourne Tonight\\".https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GTBVAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=H5UDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5407%2C1560074 The program became extremely popular, although Kennedy had his detractors. Kennedy was quoted as saying: > Many women write to tell me that although their husbands may not like me, > they do. It appears from the mail that the women have the say on what the > household is watching. And we do remember that it is the women who do the > buying of products that we advertise. Bearing that in mind we try and design > our commercials for them.Blundell (2003), p. 216 IMT was devised as a copy of the American 'Tonight Show' format, with the host presiding over sketches, introducing star artists and reading advertisements live. His colleague Bert Newton records in his autobiography: > (Norman) Spencer was the mastermind of IMT; don't let anyone forget that. > Nothing happened on IMT that Norm did not approve personally [...] Norman > Spencer chose Graham Kennedy as compère; Norm kept his eye on the show from > day to day; he pushed the buttons from the control room which put the TV > shots into viewers' homes at night; he added the talent around Graham and he > set up the organisation. Spencer wielded other influence too. According to Hugh Stuckey, a writer on the show, the producer placed Kennedy with a series of attractive young women to displace rumours of Kennedy's homosexuality. > This was an era in which homosexuality was, well, horrifying. So every now > and again Kennedy had to be seen about in case any viewers thought him the > other persuasion. [...] It was cleverly manipulated – the station had the > media at its disposal. It was all to give Graham a good old hetero image > though he always seemed very unsexual.Blundell (2003), p. 161 By July 1959 the program was still popular in Melbourne. Recurring comedy players Joff Ellen and Rosie Sturgess became regulars. Singer Toni Lamond joined the cast. Attempts were made at this time to launch Kennedy as a national personality. Special Friday night editions of IMT were produced under the title of The Graham Kennedy Show and recorded on videotape which had just come into use. After being transmitted live in Melbourne taped copies of the show would be shipped to Adelaide, Brisbane and Sydney for transmission there on subsequent evenings.Blundell (2003), p. 185-6 Producer Spencer observed there was critical and popular resistance to Kennedy in Sydney. Queensland too had shown suspicion to imports from down south trumpeted to Queenslanders as the best in Australia while Queensland itself had apparently been left out of this judgement.Blundell (2003), p. 186-7 The Graham Kennedy Show began in February 1960 but was not popular in Sydney. The program was judged stilted compared to IMT itself; Kennedy seemed much more subdued than usual, was tense, and the comedy was not working. Critics in Sydney and Queensland disliked key components of the show.Blundell (2003), p. 188-90 Judged as a flop, The Graham Kennedy Show in Sydney was dropped by ATN7 after 13 weeks. The program however was immediately picked up by TCN9 – its general manager Ken G. Hall saw potential in the program. After continued bad reviews its popularity increased in Sydney. By July 1960 it had reached its twenty-fifth episode and had the highest ratings in Australia.Blundell (2003), p. 1892-3 Later in 1960 Kennedy faced opposition when Sir Frank Packer bought GTV-9. Unlike the previous owner, Packer interfered directly with the station's activities. GTV-9 executive Colin Bednall reported that Packer hated Kennedy and forcefully articulated his desire to have him removed from the IMT. > Packer had a phobia about homosexuals and he believed Kennedy to be one. He > insisted he could pick one a mile off.Stone (2000), quoting from \\"an > unpublished memoir now lodged with the National Library in Canberra\\" by > Colin Bednall. Also quoted in Blundell (2003), p. 196 Kennedy himself was aware that Packer \\"loathed\\" him: > Sir Frank did suspect that I and others were of that persuasion. I mean if > everyone in the television industry was fired because of that, there would > be few around! [...] I've been accused of everything. I've been accused of > being homosexual, bisexual, heterosexual and worst of all asexual, which > means you don't do anything. That's cruel.Stone (2000), p. 83; quoted in > Blundell (2003), p. 196-7 Packer's arrival prompted the departure of IMT producer Norman Spencer. IMT continued its run. Other regular performers on IMT were Patti Newton and Philip Brady. In 1961 Kennedy described his presentation of the program. > In the whole of the ten years I have been working on radio and television, I > have been working to a majority of women. I think women prefer men to be > well-mannered, so I always try to watch my manners. They like men to be well > dressed, so I do my best to observe this. Others bring to my notice the fact > that I sometimes make grammatical errors in my speech; so, because of this, > I try to watch my grammar – but at the same time I bear in mind that it's > more profitable for me to be entertaining than to be perfect in my use of > English.Blundell (2003), p. 215. By March 1961 the national show had been renamed Graham Kennedy's Channel 9 Show and was finding quiet acceptance nationally. Even at this time Kennedy admitted there were problems in the weekly national show. > We clam up and get tense. But I think the national show will improve in the > next few weeks. We want to include the best segments of IMT in the national > show. IMT is a lot more spontaneous than the national show – we've run up to > an hour overtime. We like to get the audience to participate and if we can > find someone interesting in the studio audience we throw away our scripts > and just adlib.Blundell (2003), p. 218. Kennedy by this stage did not always host IMT. Bert Newton hosted on Monday nights. Then a September 1961 reshuffle had Toni Lamond host Monday nights and Newton hosted only on Thursday nights. Kennedy took occasional nights off to be replaced by Fred Parslow, Jimmy Hannan, and Philip Brady. Despite resistance from network executives to the varied hosting line-up, the ratings remained strong.Blundell (2003), p. 227-8. In January 1962 the national Graham Kennedy's Channel 9 Show was cancelled and replaced by The Channel 9 Show hosted by Bert Newton.Blundell (2003), p. 232. Kennedy continued to fine-tune his IMT performances. Kennedy had a strong understanding of key technical elements of television and perfected his comic timing, and watched the lenses on the TV cameras, adjusting his performance depending on whether he was in a wide shot or a close up.Blundell (2003), p. 223. Compilation highlight programs of IMT segments were screened in Sydney, Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide in May 1963 under the title The Best of Kennedy. The Best of Kennedy continued until December 1963.Blundell (2003), p. 244. On IMT, Noel Ferrier was appointed the new Friday night host. Also in 1963 writer Mike McColl-Jones joined. Kennedy had often disliked having writers on the program, was reluctant for them to be publicly acknowledged, and often ignored all their material. In the case of McColl-Jones, Kennedy seemed to like him and his comedy material, which was apparently the key requirement by which Kennedy would use a writer's material. McColl-Jones continued as a writer on the series for several years. Also in 1963 Ernie Carroll joined the writing team. Kennedy had apparently relaxed his attitude towards writers by this stage and seemed happy to use their material with few complaints.Blundell (2003), p. 239-42. In 1964 Bert Newton abruptly disappeared from the program. It was not publicly acknowledged at the time but he had suffered a nervous breakdown. After a long absence he returned to appear on the Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday evening episodes. On 14 June 1965 IMT reached its 2,000th instalment and more people watched the show per capita than any other television program in the world.Blundell (2003), p. 245-8. By this stage Fred Parslow was well established on the program's writing team and was a confidante of Kennedy's. > When he was really down, depressed about things. A relationship had failed. > He rang me in a terrible state and asked me to go down to his house in > Frankston. Joan, my wife, said you better go. He sounded really desperate. > There wasn't much he could do for such a long time. Of course, when he did > start to get brave, he was too old for going around and picking up what he > might enjoy. He was the first of our mega stars; there seem to be mega stars > everywhere now. In those days, living in such a Sleepy Hollow like > Melbourne, he found his life terribly, terribly difficult. And you can > understand in those days. The times have changed. It's almost compulsory to > be homosexual now.Blundell (2003), p. 250. On 7 July 1965 Kennedy appeared on a then-innovative live split-screen link with Don Lane, the host of Sydney Tonight, via the recently completed co-axial cable linking Melbourne and Sydney. Starting late September 1966, IMT itself was transmitted to Sydney via the coaxial cable. This coincided with a cameo in the film They're a Weird Mob in which Kennedy plays himself. Like the film's protagonist, Kennedy in the film finds Sydney to be a city somewhat unwelcoming towards migrants from anywhere.Blundell (2003), p. 254-5. By early December 1966 ratings for Kennedy's show were strong in Sydney. There was an increase from one IMT episode a week in Sydney, to two, with a Monday night broadcast added that month.Blundell (2003), p. 257. By 1968 there was a regular roster of IMT guest hosts, including Bert Newton, Tim Evans, Bobby Limb, Don Lane, Kevin Sanders, and Michael Preston.Blundell (2003), p. 269. The announcement of Kennedy's intention to leave IMT was made in October 1969 and he left the show on the expiration of his contract 23 December 1969. His final episode features newsreader Sir Eric Pearce placing on his head a crown made by the Channel Nine prop department in the style of that worn by Henry IV, symbolising Kennedy's reign as King of Australian television.Blundell (2003), p. 273. In 2007, the crown (which a private collector had recognised at a junk store in Bowral NSW, and purchased for $5) was auctioned for more than $17,000 to a producer of the Seven Network's Sunrise program.Kennedy's crown fetches $17K news.com.au, 23 April 2007 = Comedic style = Kennedy deliberately pushed the boundaries of acceptability in a socially conservative era. Inspired by stage comedians such as Roy Rene, his style was bawdy, irreverent, iconoclastic, often smutty, sometimes deliberately camp, and laden with innuendo and double-entendre. He regularly overstepped the boundaries of accepted \\"good taste\\", once telling a fan \\"There are no limits, love, there are no limits.\\"Blundell (2003), p. 379 Journalist Megan Gressor described Kennedy's style as having \\"... mongrel roots – a hybrid of vaudeville, slapstick and endless suggestiveness, plus a subliminal subversiveness all his own. It seems almost pantomimic to modern eyes, but Kennedy was a product of simpler times. And more complex. His was an act predicated upon repression; naughtiness loses its point in a world without taboos, where anything goes. It wouldn't work today, when people don't just say \\"fuck\\" on television, they do it.\\"\\"King of comedy, fears of a clown\\": Megan Gressor, Sydney Morning Herald, 26 April 2003 Advertisements Drawing on his radio experience with Nicky (who had routinely \\"sent up\\" advertisers), Kennedy transformed the live commercials from what would have otherwise been dull pro-forma obligations into a unique comedic art form. On one famous occasion, a scheduled 20-second ad spot for an aspirin product was spun out into 33 minutes of improvised comedy. Newton has written: > The blood would drain from the face of Pelaco shirt-wearing executives in > television, advertising and business until they realised that instead of > televisual suicide, this skinny little wiseguy was commercial gold. And then > they liked his brand of humour a lot. > A commercial I shared with Graham, Raoul Merton ('of comfort you're certain > when you wear Raoul Merton') changed the footwear buying habits of > men.Newton, Bert (1977). Op Cit, p. 91 =Sam Chisholm= Gerald Stone recounts in his book Compulsive Viewing that a \\"cocky young salesman\\" visited the IMT set hoping for an extra plug for his employer's product. The young salesman was Sam Chisholm, who later became a senior executive for variously the Packer and Murdoch media empires. A May 2005 interview with Chisholm records: :Sam Chisholm: I was working for Johnson's wax at the time, and I don't think he believed my ... :Graham Davis: Sales pitch. :Sam Chisholm: Assertions about this product. So I said, \\"I'll go and polish your floors and prove it to you.\\" Which I did. :Graham Davis: Over at his home? :Sam Chisholm: Absolutely. :Graham Davis: You got down on your hands and knees at his home? :Sam Chisholm: Yep. I started off as his housekeeper and ended up being his boss. =Rover= Kennedy requested a \\"reject\\" dog from the Jack Davey Memorial Guide Dog Centre and was given a Labrador Retriever which he named \\"Rover\\". Rover was sometimes brought into the studio to assist with advertisements for Pal dog food. One night the dog showed no interest whatsoever in the product, which Kennedy then himself proceeded to eat with apparent relish, straight from the can – or so it seemed. Rover also achieved television immortality by relieving himself – live to air – upon one of the huge cameras. The studio audience collapsed in hysterics, but the duration and urgency of Rover's impressively hydraulic performance might have led some cynics to question just how impromptu the event really was. Biographer Blundell quotes Ernie Carroll: > Pal dog food, with Rover [...] was time consuming [...] once we fed him all > afternoon so that when he came out to do the commercial he didn't want to > touch the Pal dog food. He was already full of it. [...] on another occasion > they had him drink before the show, big drinks. So when he came out, he peed > all over the camera and all around the set [...] Even those seemingly > innocent dog manoeuvres were carefully planned. Kennedy was exasperated for decades by questions about \\"whatever happened to Rover\\". As late as 1989, on Graham Kennedy's News Hour (see below), he answered a viewer's question couched in exactly those words with the withering reply \\"... he was a dog. What do you think happened?\\" In early June 2005, on the 3AW program Nightline with Philip Brady and Bruce Mansfield, Patti (McGrath) Newton stated that her father had often looked after Rover when he appeared at GTV-9. It seems that Kennedy had become increasingly irritated with retrieving Rover from the pound and so, when Patti's father's dog died, Rover went on to a long and happy life at the McGrath (senior) household. =The Graham Kennedy Show= After specials on 15 November 1971 and 2 March 1972, Kennedy returned to regular television with The Graham Kennedy Show on 19 September 1972. This series lasted until late 1973. In 1974, when Kennedy claimed he wanted a rest, Nine allegedly paid him not to sign with another network. It was Frank Packer who paid Kennedy $50,000 to do nothing, as he was fearful he would work for someone else. Kennedy said in 1978: :It wasn't a retainer. It was $50,000 not to work. Sir Frank didn't know it but I had no intention of working.TV Week magazine, 11 March 1978 – \\"Graham Hasn't Conquered Those Jitters\\" by Ben Mitchell pp58-59 The Graham Kennedy Show resumed in March 1975, and was Kennedy's first series in colour. Memorable, and controversial, moments, included the \\"crow call\\" controversy where, on 3 March 1975, Kennedy imitated a crow call (\\"faaaaaark\\") highly reminiscent of the word \\"fuck\\". This led the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to request that Kennedy \\"show cause\\" why he should not be removed from the airwaves. Kennedy replied that he could not show cause, suggesting that the Board take action to limit his appearances, while hinting at legal action should they do so. Rather than removing him, the ABCB banned Kennedy from appearing live, forcing him to pre-record the show on videotape. Another notable moment was from 17 April 1975, when Kennedy attacked Senator Doug McClelland, the then Minister for the Media, over local content issues. His comments were edited, and a voiceover recorded by the general manager was inserted saying that Kennedy had made a \\"cowardly attack on a Labor Minister who was unable to defend himself.\\" Following the McClelland incident, Kennedy parted company with the Nine Network, but later returned. =Power Without Glory= Kennedy appeared as Clive Parker in an episode of the 26-part ABC drama Power Without Glory, which began on 21 June 1976. =Blankety Blanks= He returned to television in 1977 for what is now Network Ten to host a comedy game show, Blankety Blanks. It dominated early evening television over two seasons, between 7 February 1977 and 15 September 1978. The show featured friends from his earlier days including Noeline Brown, Barry Creyton, Noel Ferrier, Ugly Dave Gray, Carol Raye and Stuart Wagstaff. It was only after the show became a ratings success and the network's most profitable program that it revealed Kennedy was paid an unprecedented $1 million per season. In 1979, \\"The King\\" became King of Moomba complete with his famous motorised desk, the second Melbourne-born recipient after Newton.Craig Bellamy, Gordon Chisholm, Hilary Eriksen (17 February 2006). Moomba: A festival for the people : pp. 17–22 =The Blainey View= In 1982 Kennedy provided the voice-over narration for a ten-episode ABC historical documentary The Blainey View.Blundell (2003), p. 356 =Eleven AM= Kennedy appeared as the host of Channel Seven's morning news program Eleven AM in 1983 and again – for eight weeks – in 1984.A life in showbusiness. Retrieved 29 June 2008. =Graham Kennedy's News Show= Nearly 60 by this point, Kennedy accepted an offer from the Nine Network's managing director Sam Chisholm to present Graham Kennedy's News Show from Sydney, to air five nights a week at 10:30 pm against Clive Robertson's Newsworld on the Seven Network.Blundell (2003), pp. 369–372 Five trial programs were recorded but never broadcast.Blundell (2003), p. 373 Kennedy initially \\"pulled the plug\\" and withdrew from the show but returned (see Harry M. Miller, below). Kennedy's contract stipulated that his co-presenter would be sports commentator Ken Sutcliffe.Blundell (2003), p. 371 Kennedy's writers, who worked from a production cottage at the corner of Scott Street and Artarmon Road included Jim Pike, Tim Evans, Larry Burns, and Ken Stirling. Blundell records: > They worked in the back room shooting out gags over typewriters and word > processors, united in their hatred of the 'Little Guy', as they also called > him.\\"Blundell (2003), p. 382 The writers also referred to Kennedy as \\"the little buggle-eyed bastard\\",.Blundell (2003), p. 383 However, they admired his talent. Jim Pike said, \\".. I hate him, but he is the best there is\\". Kennedy defied convention with remarks which were tasteless, and yet hilarious. Pointing out the irony of how a news show gets good ratings he said it would be helpful for his show's ratings if the Pope's aircraft were to fly into a mountain while it was full of orphans. He also remarked that Queen Elizabeth II \\"didn't have bad breasts ... for a woman of her age\\" and mocked 17 October 1989, San Francisco Loma Prieta earthquake with a re-creation on the set. After a slightly heavy woman was caught for streaking at a cricket match, Graham explained on air that they would run the footage but had to cover certain offending parts of her body with black. The clip he played was all black, except for a single spot that revealed her pubic hair. He also reprised the \\"Chum Song\\" from Melbourne radio days, saying that it originated in a 1920s children's newspaper column in Scotland. In Nancy Lee's book Being a Chum Was Fun she writes:Lee, Nancy (1979). Op Cit, p.67 > The Chum Song, I believe, was written and recorded in Glasgow in 1930 by > Jack Hylton's orchestra for a Scottish Newsboys Club. The recording Kennedy > used to close the program was provided by Melbourne music Historian Alex > Hehr The lyrics of the chorus are: > :Being a chum is fun, :That is why I'm one; :Always smiling, always gay, > :Chummy at work, :(and) chummy at play - :Laugh away your worries, :Don't be > sad or glum; :And everyone will know that you're a :Chum, chum, chum! Sutcliffe would \\"corpse\\", with tears in his eyes, unable to continue; this became so frequent that Kennedy managed to coin a catchphrase, \\"I love it when he cries\\". Kennedy called Sutcliffe \\"Two Dogs\\" after delivering a joke ending with the tag \\"Why do you ask, Two Dogs Rooting?\\" Graham Kennedy's News Show was a rarity in that it was a live news show that had a studio audience. Five nights a week for most of the year, audiences lined up at 10:30 at night just to see Kennedy do his magic in the flesh. Often the funniest parts of the show were in the commercial breaks when Kennedy would come down and join the audience for a chat. He always made a point of telling them a particularly crude joke that was timed so they got the punchline just a second before the show was back on air. =Coast to Coast= On 13 February 1989 the show became Coast to Coast, with Nine journalist John Mangos replacing Sutcliffe, and ran until 8 December 1989. =Harry M. Miller= Kennedy engaged Harry M. Miller as his agent. According to biographer Blundell, Kennedy believed that Miller was to donate his commission of $2500 per week to the Wayside Chapel for Kennedy's appearance on Graham Kennedy's News Show.Blundell (2003), p. 374 Miller later sued Kennedy for \\"wrongful termination and for a 20 per cent commission on his 1989 gross earnings.\\"Blundell (2003), p. 387 During the court case Miller \\"painted a picture of his client of twenty years as a late- night drunk in the habit of sending demanding faxes while under the influence.\\"Blundell (2003), p. 388 Justice Brownie found against Miller, and ordered him to pay $75,699 and costs. =Graham Kennedy's Funniest Home Videos= Kennedy's last series was Graham Kennedy's Funniest Home Video Show which was broadcast between 29 March and 15 November 1990 on the Nine Network. =35 Years of Television= Kennedy presented the introduction segment to the Nine Network special 35 Years of Television in 1991. The segment covered the very early days of television variety, including his own In Melbourne Tonight. =Last television appearance= Kennedy's last television appearance was in February 1994 in an interview for Ray Martin Presents Graham Kennedy's Sixtieth. Believing that Martin had ambushed him by departing from a pre- agreed list of questions, Kennedy ensured that much of the interview was unusable for broadcast by peppering his responses with obscenities. In 2005 John Mangos wrote: > He (Kennedy) later explained the experience in a piece for TV Week in an > article called 'In his own words'. \\"Ray Martin and I had worked together > before, and he well knows that if I have the questions in advance, he'll get > a better interview. Everyone knows this – politicians in particular. Ray > duly faxed the questions to me, but on the morning of the recording changed > them. I was bewildered by this (I think a researcher let him down). I > terminated the interview when I didn't know what he was talking about and > went upstairs to lunch.\\" It was a critical turning point in his career. He > vowed never to do television again. Ray Martin denied any ill intent, saying \\"We faxed a series of general topics, but it was clear at the outset that much would depend on the general run of the interview [...] An ambush was not on the agenda [...] He had no complaints. There was never a suggestion that he was unhappy.\\"Blundell (2003), pps. 409, 410 =Logie awards= Kennedy coined the name Logie Award in 1960, after the inventor of television, John Logie Baird. Kennedy received many Logies, including: * 5 Gold Logies for the Most Popular Personality on Australian Television (1960, 1967, 1969, 1974, and 1978). **He also won the \\"TV Week Awards' Star of the Year\\" award at the inaugural presentation in 1959, and this is sometimes counted as his first Gold Logie, which would give him 6 in total * a Special Logie Award – the Star of the Decade in 1967 * a Hall of Fame Logie Award in 1998. He did not attend the ceremony; the award was accepted on his behalf by Bert Newton. Film career Kennedy appeared in a number of films, ranging from brief cameos to leading roles. They include: * On the Beach (1959) as Minor Role (uncredited) * They're a Weird Mob (1966) as Himself (cameo) * The Box (1975, supporting role) as Himself * Don's Party (1976) as Mack / design engineer * The Odd Angry Shot (1979) as Harry * The Club (1980) as Ted Parker * Silent Reach (1983, TV Mini-Series) as Chasser Fitzpatrick * The Return of Captain Invincible (1983) as Prime Minister (cameo) * The Killing Fields (1984) as Dougal * Stanley (1984) as Norm Norris * Les Patterson Saves the World (1987) as Brian Lannigan * Travelling North (1987) as Freddie (final film role) He also had a cameo in On the Beach (1959) which was not used. Personal life > Being a period of that era of the 1950s I think being gay must have been > pretty harsh for Graham. I can imagine...everybody knew, nobody cared, but I > think it was such a time when you didn't talk about issues that were > personal, and I think that made him much more secretive and reclusive, and I > think that was probably quite a tough thing for him... — Susan Gaye Anderson Kennedy himself never publicly acknowledged that he was gay, but his homosexuality was considered an open secret within the Australian entertainment industry. In the 1960s Bob Dyer described him as \\"probably the loneliest young man in Australia.\\"Blundell (2003), p. 164 In 1973 Melbourne newspapers reported that Kennedy was engaged to 28-year-old Australian singer Lana Cantrell, who became a successful New York lawyer. Many years later, Kennedy wrote to a newspaper that a photographer, taking pictures of him and Cantrell leaving a restaurant together asked if he could \\"hint at a romance\\". The following Sunday a poster proclaimed \\"Graham and Lana to wed\\".Blundell (2003), p. 361. His former housekeeper, Devona Fox, in the 2009 television documentary The Real Graham Kennedy, produced by Bob Phillips, one of the producers from Kennedy's breakthrough Channel 9 program In Melbourne Tonight, is quoted as saying: > Graham always told me right early on that he would never get married. He > told me that his life was devastated when his parents split up, and he said > straight out, \\"Mrs Fox, I'll never get married\\", so I never expected > anything more of him than what did happen. Even when Lana Cantrell came into > the scene I was puzzled and I did say to him why all this, and of course we > all know it was good publicity. Lana came to the house and I had to go up, > and have it all cleaned, ready for her and her party to come one Sunday > night. And then on the Monday night, this great big announcement was going > to be made that he was supposed to be engaged to Lana Cantrell. Well, the > ratings went through the roof... In his 2006 book King and I: My Life with Graham Kennedy, published by celebrity agent Anthony Zammit, broadcaster Rob Astbury stated that Kennedy and he had been lovers. Kennedy is portrayed as homosexual in the 2007 biopic The King. He was a Freemason.Famous &/or Notable Australian Freemasons Retirement In 1991 Kennedy retired to a rural property at Canyonleigh, near Bowral in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales, near his friends Tony Sattler and Noeline Brown, where his main companions were two Clydesdale horses named Dave and Sarah, and Henry, a Golden Retriever. Ill-health Kennedy's health declined during the 1990s. He was diabetic, and a heavy smoker and drinker. Throughout his illnesses, his friends Tony Sattler and Noeline Brown rallied to his aid. On 18 December 2001 his housekeeper found him unconscious and dehydrated. Sattler said \\"Between the diabetes and the booze, there's not much left of him\\", adding that the death of Kennedy's dog Henry was \\"the final trigger\\".Blundell (2003), p. 418 On 14 June 2002 Kennedy was found unconscious at the foot of the stairs at his home, suffering a broken leg and skull with suspected brain damage.Blundell (2003), p. 429 His Canyonleigh property was sold, and he moved into a townhouse and later a nursing home. =Benefactor= Despite a career of high earnings, press reports said that his financial situation was, while not disastrous, insufficient to fund his ongoing care. Having made millions for the Packer family interests, he believed that \\"the Packers will always look after me\\". According to Graeme Blundell's biography, Tony Sattler: > [...]spent several days ringing Kerry Packer's office [...] Nursing was > going to cost $3000 a week. 'We could cope for several years but not longer. > [...] After three days Di Stone, Mr Packer's personal assistant, called > Sattler back: 'Mr Packer has considered his plight. Unfortunately, he is > unable to assist. > [...] Sattler received a phone call from [...] an 'unnamed businessman' — > [...] ten minutes later there was a call from Graham's bank to tell Sattler > that $150,000 had been deposited in the ailing comedian's account.Blundell > (2003), pps. 422–423 On 27 May 2005, Noeline Brown confirmed that the benefactor was Sam Chisholm. 'Brown said Mr Chisholm, who maintained a strong friendship with Kennedy from their Channel Nine years, offered to pay his expenses when he needed round- the-clock care. \\"For a long time, it looked as if all of Graham's money . . . would disappear, because it's very expensive to look after someone 24 hours a day\\", Brown said.\\"So Sam Chisholm decided he would help Graham out by supporting him for a year.\\"' However, Kennedy's will reportedly left a seven- figure sum to the Sydney City Mission. Decline On 2 February 2004, The Daily Telegraph said: > The king of Australian TV Graham Kennedy will celebrate his 70th birthday > next weekend with a few close friends. The low-key affair is expected to be > at the Kenilworth Nursing Home at Bowral where Kennedy has lived since > taking a nasty tumble a few years ago. Physically he's not in terrific > shape. He can't walk any more and gets around in a wheelchair as a result of > the diabetes and the years of heavy smoking. Actor Graeme Blundell, who had worked with Kennedy on the movie The Odd Angry Shot, published a biography of Kennedy, King: The Life and Comedy of Graham Kennedy (MacMillan, 2003). A newspaper report stated that Kennedy \\"passed on his best wishes but declined to be involved 'for no particular reason [...] other than he believes he has a limited memory of many of the facts of his life'.\\" The book, which was completed before Kennedy's death, ends with \\"Graham read them [chapters of an early draft] ... asked if he wished to read any more, 'No', Graham Kennedy said. 'I know how it ends.'\\" In 2001 Kennedy's friend and Coast to Coast colleague, John Mangos, was reported as saying: > I can say to his beloved fans that they won't see Graham again. He won't > appear publicly again; he is in his twilight. He has made a personal > decision to disappear quietly into the sunset. Death On 25 May 2005, aged 71, Kennedy died at the Kenilworth Nursing Home, Bowral, from complications from pneumonia. John Mangos wrote in The Bulletin: > A week before his 69th birthday, he was bedridden and infirm. His wasted and > frail, aching body could take no more. I paid a short and emotional visit. > Still, the ashtray was by his bedside next to a radio tuned to ABC Radio > National. I leaned over to kiss him on the forehead and he whispered, 'Don't > get too close, it hurts'. He also wrote: > I was often asked if he had cancer or AIDS. In fact at 67, he had diabetes, > some rheumatism, the odd creaky joint, a healthy capacity to whinge and the > usual symptoms connected with smoking and drinking. But by now the horses > were gone and the dog had died. He was eating less and drinking more. One > night, he fell down the stairs. He was discovered the next morning on the > floor by his housekeeper. He was rushed to the local hospital where > pneumonia in one lung was treated effectively and efficiently, a fracture > near his hip was repaired and he was diagnosed with brain damage. We were to > learn he had Korsakoff's syndrome (an alcohol-related condition) and we > decided to keep it private. Korsakoff's syndrome is a form of amnesia seen in chronic alcoholics; briefly stated, victims eat too little and drink too much. =Derryn Hinch controversy= After his death, controversial Melbourne-based 3AW radio broadcaster Derryn Hinch alleged that Kennedy had died from an AIDS-related disease. This was strenuously denied by his friends and carers Noeline Brown and Tony Sattler, and as a result Kennedy's biographer Graeme Blundell then published Kennedy's medical records, including a recent negative HIV test, to disprove this allegation. Hinch fought back saying he didn't say Kennedy had AIDS, but that he was homosexual, had symptoms similar to those of Kaposi's sarcoma, and died of pneumonia, thus implying Kennedy's death was AIDS- related. =Funeral= Tony Sattler offered the Nine Network the right to televise the funeral but it declined, claiming it could not justify the cost of the outside broadcast. The Seven Network accepted, and gave coverage free of charge to the Nine Network. Hence, the one-hour funeral service was aired simultaneously across both Seven and Nine networks. Stuart Wagstaff presented the funeral, which was attended by many of Kennedy's friends, colleagues and associates on the morning of 31 May 2005 at a small community theatre in the town of Mittagong. At the end of the funeral Kennedy's coffin was carried by players from the St Kilda Football Club, the Australian rules football team he supported. Wagstaff's eulogy alluded to the claims made by Derryn Hinch about the cause of Kennedy's death: > Delivering a eulogy for a close friend and for someone who was so much > admired is never a happy occasion. Though I must confess I would be quite > happy to deliver a eulogy for a certain media personality who's tried the > second Kennedy assassination of our time... and failed. The Age newspaper, on 26 June 2005, reported John Mangos as saying that he \\"knew Kennedy wanted his ashes scattered at sea. And that wish was carried out.\\" This was confirmed in a report in The Sydney Morning Herald which stated that Kennedy's ashes were scattered in the sea at Kiama attended by a group which included \\"Noeline Brown, Tony Sattler, John Mangos, Stuart Wagstaff, Kennedy's former housekeeper Sally Baker-Beall and her husband John, and old friends Christine and Nicholas Deeprose.\\" Legacy Statue of Graham Kennedy at Waterfront City, Melbourne Docklands. Four of Kennedy's television shows were named in the program 50 Years 50 Shows which counted-down the top 50 Australian TV shows of all time, as decided by ratings data and the opinions of 100 television industry professionals, on the Nine Network on 25 September 2005. Kennedy's In Melbourne Tonight topped the poll, Power Without Glory (15th), Blankety Blanks (20th) and Coast to Coast (42nd). In the Australia Day honours of 26 January 2006, Kennedy was posthumously appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO), for \\"service to the entertainment industry as an actor, comedian and presenter significantly influencing the development of the radio, television and film industries in Australia, and to the community\\". The award was made effective from 5 May 2005. =The King telemovie= A telemovie examining Kennedy's life, titled The King, began filming in December 2006. It stars Stephen Curry as Kennedy and Stephen Hall as Bert Newton, with Garry McDonald, Shaun Micallef, Steve Bisley, Jane Allsop as Noeline Brown, Beau Brady, Leo Taylor as Sir Frank Packer and Bernard Curry as John Wesley. The project, which cost $2.1 million, premiered on 20 May 2007 on TV1 (becoming the highest-rating drama to be shown on pay-TV) to heavy criticism by Kennedy's friends. Tony Sattler and his wife, actress Noeline Brown, Kennedy's closest friends, said they were mortified by the movie, saying that \\"The film was obsessed with his homosexuality. I don't think people cared about that ... He was Australia's most famous, successful entertainer but how much do we see of that in the film? We see fuck all of it.\\" The Nine Network screened the film on 27 August 2007 .

The approximate Bronze Age extension of the Persian Gulf is shown. Anshan ( Anzan), modern Tall-e Malyan (), was an ancient city in Persia. It was located in the Zagros Mountains in southwestern Iran, approximately north of Shiraz and west of Persepolis in the Beyza/Ramjerd plain, in the province of Fars. Its location serves as a landmark for Elamite studies. It was one of the earliest urban states of the Mesopotamian area and one of the earliest capitals of Elam from the late 4th millennium BC. It fell under the rule of the Persians in the 7th century BC and then became one of the early capitals of Persia. Most of what is known about Anshan has been discovered through ancient artifacts discovered in archaeological digs at Tall-e Malyan and passages in early Elamite texts.  History  Anshan is considered to be the origin of one of the world's oldest known civilizations. It was occupied consistently from before 4000 BC to 1000 BC and was politically tied to the Elamites at Susa, as well as the Mesopotamians. Its exact location was unknown to scholars until 1973 when artifacts, uncovered through archaeological digs at Tall-i Malyan, confirmed its location. Prior to that scholars only knew of it to be somewhere in the central Zagros mountain range. During the Proto-Elamite period (late fourth millennium BC), this becomes one of the main cities of the Elamite region, thanks to its location on important trade routes. During the 'Banesh period' (3400-2800), at , it was 5 times the size of Susa.D. T. Potts, A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East. Volume 94 of Blackwell Companions to the Ancient World. John Wiley & Sons, 2012 p743 The Marv Dasht area, where the highland city of Anshan is located, is a complex of several interconnected valleys and plains. During the mid-late Banesh Period (3100-2800 BC) Anshan also had a walled area of 200 hectares. It also featured a number of subsidiary villages and campsites.Henry Wright, The Earliest Bronze Age in Southwest Asia (3100-2700 BC) Alden 1982, Sumner 1986 According to G. Wright: The Elamite city makes an appearance in the early Sumerian epic Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta as being en route between Uruk and the legendary Aratta, supposedly around the time writing was developed. At various times, Anshan provided, in its own right, the source for a number of Elamite dynasties that sometimes competed for extent and influence with other prominent Elamite cities. The earliest evidence of Anshan can be found in the Sumerian King list where many references are made to rulers of Awan. Manishtushu claimed to have subjugated Anshan, but as the Akkadian empire weakened under his successors, the native governor of Susa, Kutik-Inshushinak, a scion of the Awan dynasty, proclaimed his independence from Akkad and captured Anshan. Following this, Gudea of Lagash claimed to have subjugated Anshan in 2200 BC and the Neo- Sumerian rulers Shulgi and Shu-Sin of Ur are said to have maintained their own governors over the place. However their successor, Ibbi-Sin, seems to have spent his reign engaged in a losing struggle to maintain control over Anshan, ultimately resulting in the Elamite sack of Ur in 2004 BC, at which time the statue of Nanna, and Ibbi-Sin himself, were captured and removed to Anshan. In the Old Babylonian period, king Gungunum of Larsa dated his 5th regnal year after the destruction of Anshan. During the early Elamite period, the rulers were known as the kings of Awan, but later on, they are referred to as the kings of Anzan, Susa, and Elam. There is also evidence that advocates Awan may have been a political district that was a part of a larger Anshan. Particularly since it has been discovered that Anshan was politically and culturally advanced. From the 15th century BC, Elamite rulers at Susa began using the title \\"King of Anshan and Susa\\" (in Akkadian texts, the toponyms are reversed, as \\"King of Susa and Anshan\\"), and it seems probable that Anshan and Susa were in fact unified for much of the \\"Middle Elamite period\\". The last king to claim this title was Shutruk-Nahhunte II (ca. 717-699 BC). Cradle of Achaemenid Persia Anshan fell under Persis Achaemenid rule in the 7th century BC, having been captured by Teispes (675-640 BC), who was an ancestor of Cyrus the Great and styled himself \\"the great king, king of Anshan\\". For another century during the period of Elamite decline, Anshan was a minor kingdom, until the Achaemenids in the 6th century BC embarked on a series of conquests from Anshan, which became the nucleus of the Persian Empire. The most famous conqueror who rose from Anshan was Cyrus the Great Evidence of the connection to the Achaemenid Empire can be linked through writings on the Cyrus Cylinder which trace the lineage of Cyrus the Great. Cyrus is referred to as the \\"king of the city of Anshan\\" and his ancestors as \\"the great king, king of the city of Anshan\\" Anshan continued to be inhabited through the Achaemenid period, but its importance declined greatly in favor of Pasargadae and Persepolis; it was merely a minor village by Parthian and Sasanian times.Kamyar Abdi, \\"Maliān\\", in Encyclopædia Iranica (2005) Archaeology The site of Anshan covers around 200 hectares. It dates back over 6,000 years and is considered a landmark in both an Elamite studies and Iranian architecture. The main feature is a low flat-topped mound of about 130 hectares running in height. On three sides are the remains of a city wall, in length, which dates from the Late Banesh and Kaftari periods. Finds at Tall-i Malyan included primarily Proto-Elamite and Middle Elamite cuneiform tablets, seals, and a pottery sequence important to dating the chronology of the region. The site was first worked by Fereidoon Tavallali of the Archaeological Service of Iran in 1961. No records or publications of that effort appear to exist, though some artifacts ended up in the Persepolis Museum. Scientific excavation began in 1971 with a team, led by William Sumner, from the University of Pennsylvania and Ohio State University after a survey in 1968.William Sumner, Excavations at Tall-i Malyan 1971-72, Iran, vol. 12, pp. 155-180, 1974William Sumner, Excavations at Tall-i Malyan 1974, Iran, vol. 14, pp. 103-115, 1976John R. Alden and Jack Martin Balcer, Excavations at Tal-i Malyan 1974, Iran, vol. 16, pp. 79-92, 1978William Sumner, The Proto-Elamite City Wall at Tal-i Malyan, Iran, vol. 23, pp. 153-161, 1985 The dig continued for several seasons, until 1978, when the Iranian Revolution intervened. Most recently, Tal-i Malyan was excavated by Kamyar Abdi in 1999.Kamyar Abdi, Malyan 1999, Iran, vol. 39, pp. 73-98, 2001Kamyar Abdi, Back to Malyan, Antiquity, vol. 74, pp. 473-74, 2000 A further six week dig was conducted in 2004 by the Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran and Dartmouth College.John R. Alden et al., Fars Archaeology Project 2004: Excavations at Tal-e Malyan, Iran, vol. 43, pp. 39-47, 2005 The most notable find was that of a building brick found at an unspecified location in Iran in 1971. A photograph was discovered in a French archaeological publication which contained inscriptions from this brick that were key to identifying the lost city. These inscriptions were written in Elamite and believed to be part of a temple built by the Elamite kings to the gods at Anshan. After translating a group of tablets that were found at the Tall-i Maylan site the following fall, Erica Reiner, from the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute, was able to match these writings to those on the brick. They also matched the writings on tablets discovered by the Pennsylvania team which did, specifically, name Anshan. In 1973, it was confirmed that this site was the lost city of Anshan. Three separate groups of tablets were found by the Pennsylvania team at the site. The oldest group contains seven tablets made of unbaked clay that date back to the third millennium BC. That set of tablets has not been translated because the writing is Proto-Elamite or possibly a script version of Elamite. The next set of tablets are inscribed in Sumerian and date back to 1800 BC. These tablets signify a Mesopotamian influence. The third set of tablets are the ones used by Erica Reiner to positively identify Anshan's location. An agreement was made between the researchers and the Iranian government that the Iranian government could choose ten artifacts and the remaining items would be divided between evenly between the two parties. The Iranian government chose to take several of the tablets in their choice of the original ten items.

The team worked for NWA Central States Wrestling, the American Wrestling Association, Continental Wrestling Federation, Continental Wrestling Association and the World Wrestling Federation. In 1992, the team had a violent kayfabe breakup that helped propel Michaels into the singles ranks with \\"The Heartbreak Kid\\" gimmick that he used until his retirement in 2010. After the breakup Michaels and Jannetty had an on again, off again feud due to Jannetty leaving the WWF on more than one occasion. In 1996, Jannetty teamed up with Leif Cassidy (later to be known as Al Snow) to form The New Rockers, but the team never achieved much success in the WWF and ended later that same year. In 2005, The Rockers reunited for one night but nothing more came of it because Jannetty was released by WWE. In 2006, Jannetty was slated to return and work an extended angle, teaming with Michaels against Mr. McMahon and Shane McMahon, but only made two televised appearances before being released from his contract. Instead, WWE reformed Michaels' other team, D-Generation X, to fill the storyline. HistoryMidnight Rockers (1985–1988)=NWA Central States Wrestling (1985) Marty Jannetty and Shawn Michaels first met and struck up a friendship when they both competed for the National Wrestling Alliance's Central States Wrestling territory in Kansas City in 1985. Initially they would only travel together (along with Dave \\"D.J.\\" Peterson) since Jannetty was either teaming with Tommy Rogers (better known as Tommy Lane of the Rock 'n' Roll RPMs) as the Uptown Boys, or he was teaming with Central States booker ”Bulldog” Bob Brown. After the team of Jannetty and Brown broke up Michaels and Jannetty started teaming up, although they were not given a team name. On May 15, 1985 Michaels and Jannetty defeated The Batten Twins (Brad & Bart) to win the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship. Their first title reign was short-lived as the Batten Twins regained the title only a week later on May 22, 1985. Shortly after the team lost the CSW tag team title, Michaels left Kansas City and the NWA, and returned to his home state of Texas to work for Texas All-Star Wrestling. In TASW Shawn began teaming with Paul Diamond as ”American Force” and the team of Jannetty and Michaels seemed like it was never meant to be a permanent thing. American Wrestling Association (1986–1987) In early 1986, both Jannetty and Michaels were signed by the American Wrestling Association (AWA) as they needed young talent to replace the wrestlers that had switched to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as it was expanding towards becoming a national company. The two were paired up by the AWA bookers; Greg Gagne (son of the owner and one of the bookers) suggested the name ”The Country Rockers”, another idea for a name was the \\"U.S. Express\\" (as told by Marty during an interview on AWA television that aired in 1986) not keen on the idea the two of them came up with the name The Midnight Rockers inspired by Judas Priest’s ”Living after Midnight”. AWA owner Verne Gagne did not seem to understand the idea, (in fact he is quoted as wondering if fans might confuse the name with rocking chairs) but let the team go ahead and use the name. The two started wearing identical outfits and develop the ”Fun loving pretty boy” gimmick they would be known for throughout their time together. After wrestling on the lower end of the card to get the fans familiar with the team the Midnight Rockers soon moved onto a feud with the team of Doug Somers and Buddy Rose who at the time were one of the top teams in the promotion. Their initial outing with Somers and Rose at the WrestleRock stadium show on April 20, 1986 did not go well for Jannetty and Michaels who lost in front of 22,000 fans. When Somers and Rose beat Scott Hall and Curt Hennig for the AWA World Tag Team Championship the Midnight Rockers suddenly found themselves chasing the main tag team title of the promotion. The Midnight Rockers teamed up with Curt Hennig to defeat Somer, Rose and Alexis Smirnoff at ”Battle by the Bay” on June 28, 1986 to prove that they were indeed capable of beating the champions. The Midnight Rockers would repeatedly challenge Somers throughout the rest of 1986 but never quite be able to get the win when the title was on the line. Finally near the end of that year, Jannetty and Michaels defeated the champions in a ”non-title” Steel cage match on December 25, 1986 on the AWA's ”Brawl in St. Paul” show. A month later on January 27, 1987 the Midnight Rockers defeated Rose and Somers for the AWA Tag Team title. Jannetty and Michaels realized that the AWA was a promotion in decline, in fact it would shut down completely by 1990, and they decided that their best bet was to work for the WWF. The Midnight Rockers got an offer from Vince McMahon while holding the AWA Tag Title. The Midnight Rockers even signed with the WWF while still holding the gold, necessitating the quick title change to the unproven duo of Boris Zhukov and Soldat Ustinov on May 25, 1987. Various promotions (1987–1988) The team made their first WWF appearance in 1987 only five days after dropping the AWA Tag Team titles at a house show in St. Paul, Minnesota where they challenged the then WWF World Tag Team Champions The Hart Foundation for a title match. Four days later the Midnight Rockers wrestled at their first TV taping for the show WWF Wrestling Challenge defeating the team of Jose Estrada, Sr. and Jimmy Jack Funk. This match was their one and only taped appearance for the WWF as they were fired after only a few short weeks with the federation, the Rockers also had some matches house shows against The Shadows. The team was fired because of excessive partying and not enough focusing on their in ring work. After being fired by the WWF, they went down to Continental Wrestling around Alabama and Pensacola, Florida. According to the Heartbreak and Triumph DVD, Michaels was unhappy there. When Bob Armstrong took over the booking, they gave them two weeks notice that they were no longer needed and he was bringing in another tag team. After the way they had left the AWA Michaels and Jannetty could not just return like nothing had happened, instead the Midnight Rockers started working for the AWA affiliated Championship Wrestling Association (CWA) in Memphis, Tennessee. The team had made a couple of appearances in the CWA in the past as part of their working agreement with the AWA but now they were in Memphis full-time. Shortly after arriving in the territory, Michaels and Janetty turned heel signing with manager Mark Guleen.https://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/memphis/memphis- cwa38-2.htm Their first feud in Memphis was against a recently formed team known as The Nasty Boys (Jerry Sags and Brian Knobs) whom they faced in several brutal matches all over the CWA territory. After The Nasty Boys, The Rockers got involved in a feud with “The Nightmares” (Danny Davis and Ken Wayne). Their villainous personas were that of self-obsessed, glory seeking ”superstars”, the same persona Michaels would later adopt as ”The Hearbreak Kid”. Their feud with the RPMs saw the Midnight Rockers defeat Lane and Davis to win the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship on October 26, 1987. Jannetty and Michaels lost then regained the Southern Tag Team title as the Midnight Rockers / RPMs feud raged on. With their success in Memphis, the AWA started to book them as well, having the Midnight Rockers split their time between Memphis and the AWA territory – in Memphis the Midnight Rockers were heels but in the AWA they were faces (good guys), something which was possible before the advent of national television deals and easy internet access. On December 27, 1987 The Midnight Rockers defeated The Original Midnight Express (Dennis Condrey and Randy Rose) for the AWA World Tag Team title. Since they had won the AWA World Tag Team titles, Jannetty and Michaels were forced to vacate the AWA Southern Tag Team titles in January 1988. While in the CWA, they had a brief feud with The Rock 'n' Roll Express over the AWA World Tag Team titles. After a short while in the AWA Jannetty and Michaels began asking for more money and a guaranteed contract from owner Verne Gagne. When this request was denied the Midnight Rockers quit the AWA without having found another promotion for which to work. Before they left the promotion, they lost the AWA Tag Team Championship on March 19 to Badd Company (Pat Tanaka and Paul Diamond). =The Rockers (1988–1992)=World Wrestling Federation (1988–1992) Shortly after leaving the AWA, Jannetty and Michaels were contacted by WWF owner Vince McMahon informing them that he was willing to bring them back if they were able to be more professional this time around. By the end of May the team was working for the WWF under the shortened name The Rockers. They officially made their television debut on the June 18, 1988 edition of WWF Superstars of Wrestling in a squash match. The Rockers made their pay-per-view (PPV) debut at the 1988 Survivor Series as part of the 10 team tag match. They eliminated The Bolsheviks from the match before being eliminated by a double-disqualification in a brawl with the Brain Busters. The brawl between The Rockers and The Brain Busters led to a match taped for WWF Superstars of Wrestling where both teams were disqualified once again, this time before the match could really start. This led to a series of house show matches between the two teams, a series of matches that drew rave reviews from the fans. One match in particular on January 23, 1989 was rated as one of the 50 greatest matches in the PWI 10th anniversary issue. The Brain Busters narrowly defeated The Rockers, as Anderson held down Marty Jannetty's leg as Blanchard pinned him. The feud continued to rage on as they clashed at Saturday Night's Main Event XX in a match that saw both teams counted out for brawling on the floor. They competed against The Twin Towers, Akeem and Big Boss Man, at WrestleMania V. According to Michaels' autobiography, he was nursing a severe hangover in the hours before this match. In spring 1989, The Rockers started a storyline with The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers that kicked off with an underhanded attack on Michaels during a match. The Rougeaus assaulted Michaels with manager Jimmy Hart’s megaphone and drew blood. This storyline put The Rockers' issues with The Brain Busters on the back burners while The Rockers and the Rougeaus fought. The issue between The Rockers and Rougeaus was the storyline reason for introducing the “Iron Man match” to the WWF. Despite wrestling 5 Iron Man matches against each other none of the matches were ever televised or released on a commercial tape. On August 28, 1989, the Rockers/Rougeau feud made it to PPV as the Rougeaus teamed with Rick Martel to defeat The Rockers and Tito Santana at SummerSlam. In late 1989, The Rockers and The Brain Busters resumed their feud after The Brain Busters lost the WWF Tag Team Championship to Demolition. On November 23, The Rockers faced Arn Anderson as part of the 4-on-4 elimination matches at Survivor Series. Prior to the match, Tully Blanchard had failed a drug test and was fired, forcing manager Bobby Heenan to wrestle in his place. The Rockers and The Brain Busters had one last match at Saturday Night's Main Event XXIV where they defeated The Brain Busters 2 falls to 1. After the match, Bobby Heenan fired the team in a backstage segment to explain why the team disappeared from the WWF. In December 1989, The Rockers feuded with The Powers of Pain until February 1990. At the Royal Rumble in January 1990, both men competed in the Royal Rumble match. However, neither Michaels nor Janetty was victorious in their attempt, being eliminated by the Ultimate Warrior and Ted DiBiase, respectively. In April 1990, The Rockers faced new competition in the form of Pat Tanaka and Akio Sato, the newly signed team known as The Orient Express. The two teams kicked off a prolonged feud that started at WrestleMania VI and continued off and on for well over a year. When Sato decided to leave the American wrestling scene in December 1990, the WWF decided to team Tanaka up with his former partner Paul Diamond under a mask. Tanaka and Diamond had previously teamed as Badd Company and won the AWA Tag Team Championship from The Rockers. The Rockers and The Orient Express had a high profile, high flying match at the Royal Rumble. Tag team title controversy By current WWE records, The Rockers never officially held the WWF Tag Team Championship, but on October 30, 1990, Jannetty and Michaels did actually defeat the reigning champions The Hart Foundation in a two out of three falls match in Fort Wayne, Indiana to seemingly win the title. The WWE (WWF) has never officially recognized The Rockers' champion status. During the match, the top rope broke by accident making the match a disjointed affair that would require serious clean up before it could be shown on TV. The Rockers defended the WWF Tag Team title against Power and Glory (Paul Roma and Hercules) on November 3, 1990. Shortly after November 3, it was decided to not air the title change and that the title would revert to the Hart Foundation. In his book, Michaels claims that the Hart Foundation had politicked to keep the title. Michaels claim is contradicted by other claims that the WWF had actually fired Jim Neidhart forcing the title change, but after the match, the two sides came to an agreement, and Neidhart was brought back. The Rockers were never officially credited with a title win, but footage from the match was shown prior to Jannetty's WWF return in 1995. The match can be seen in its entirety on the DVD The Shawn Michaels Story: Heartbreak & Triumph. Because it never aired, the match was not clipped and thus is shown in full with no commentary; the only edit being after the second fall when a ring crew arrived to reattach the broken rope. Break up and beyond After teaming together since 1985, The Rockers split up in December 1991 after backstage disputes. The exact nature of the dispute has not been confirmed by the WWF other than it was a monetary issue that led to Jannetty quitting the WWF on behalf of both Rockers. According to Michaels's book, Jannetty had claimed that World Championship Wrestling were willing to give them a very high guaranteed contract but when Michaels inquired about it, it turned out to be an exaggeration. Jannetty disputes this saying that Michaels was the driving force suggesting to quit the WWF, but had Jannetty do the phone call to ask for a release from their contract. When Vince McMahon actually agreed to let them go Michaels appeared shocked according to him, and later went to McMahon unbeknownst to him to explain this was Jannetty's idea only and that he had no intention of leaving the WWF himself. After cooler heads prevailed it was decided that The Rockers should split with Michaels turning heel to feud with Jannetty. Jannetty was not happy about the team splitting, while Michaels could not wait to work as a singles wrestler. On screen there was no mention of what went on backstage, instead Michaels and Jannetty started to show signs of dissension. During a singles match between Michaels and Ric Flair, Jannetty rolled Shawn into the ring to get pinned. Michaels took this as Jannetty costing him the match instead of helping out (though this was a storyline). At the 1991 Survivor Series Jannetty caused Michaels to be eliminated by accidentally slamming one of the Nasty Boys into him after which The Rockers argued. After the buildup, The Rockers wrestled one last match on television, a title shot at The Legion of Doom which The Rockers lost after which Jannetty and Michaels argued over who was to blame. A DVD extra on Heartbreak And Triumph, and in Michaels's autobiography of the same name, titled The Rockers \\"Fight\\" reveals that they got into a legit fight in May 1991 that was instigated by Roddy Piper. The incident according to Michaels happened as the boys were intoxicated, Piper, also drunk, started talking about how Michaels would be an even greater competitor in the business, that he would even be the future of the business. Piper stated, that \\"Michaels had had a great future in the business and that Michaels had all this talent\\". Jannetty, believing that to be an insult to him challenged Michaels to a fight to which Michaels declined. Jannetty, however, would not take no for answer and attacked Michaels which started the fight. Piper pulled the two apart, and Michaels passed out right after, and wouldn't come to until the next day. The story, told by Jannetty, reveals that police were called to the scene and arrested Jannetty. As they were arresting him though, Randy Savage stepped in and prevented him from going to jail by telling the police that it was all part of a storyline even though in reality he did not know the cause of the fight in the first place. Michaels almost quit the WWF over the incident, and Jannetty believes that this incident was one of the factors in the WWF's decision to break up The Rockers. The final split came on Brutus Beefcake’s \\"Barbershop\\" (taped on December 2, 1991, and shown on January 12, 1992) where Beefcake interviewed The Rockers about their recent problems. After seemingly working their problems, Michaels suddenly superkicked Jannetty, before sending him through the glass window of the barbershop set. Michaels also proceeded to rip a full page picture of the group in half, signifying the separation. The turn had the desired effect of making Michaels a hated heel especially since the WWF agreed to let Jannetty \\"blade\\" (make himself bleed) after being thrown through the window, something which was not very prevalent in 1991. It also prevented Jannetty from entering the Royal Rumble in 1992. =Michaels vs. Jannetty= Michaels and Jannetty were supposed to feud following the breakup, but Jannetty was suspended by the WWF, due to an incident outside a Tampa night club that occurred on January 25, 1992. He was arrested and put under house arrest for months with charges of resisting arrest with force, cocaine possession and possession of drug paraphernalia, forcing the feud to be abandoned at least temporarily. While Jannetty was away, Michaels began developing his “Heartbreak Kid” heel persona including getting Sherri Martel as his manager. Michaels also won the WWF Intercontinental Championship from The British Bulldog. On the October 31, 1992 (taped October 12, 1992 in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan) edition of WWF Superstars, Michaels was in the ring posing before a match, admiring himself in a mirror that Sherri brought to the ring. To everyone's surprise, Jannetty came down through the crowd and entered the ring. Jannetty attacked Michaels, grabbed the mirror and tried to hit Michaels with it. But Michaels pulled Sherri in front of himself so that she got hit with the mirror instead. This led to Sherri being hospitalized from the glass shards (only in storyline terms) when Sherri returned from her “recovery” she turned on Michaels and actually backed Jannetty in his unsuccessful attempt to take the Intercontinental title away from Michaels at the 1993 Royal Rumble. After the loss, Jannetty was fired by the WWF for supposedly being drunk or hungover during the match however, Mr. Perfect reported that it was actually due to a lack of sleep and Jannetty was brought back. During an episode of Monday Night Raw on May 17, 1993, Jannetty returned to the WWF during an impromptu challenge. Jannetty defeated Michaels to win the title (with the help of Mr. Perfect). Three weeks later Jannetty lost the title back to Michaels in an untelevised house show thanks to the interference of Michaels’ new bodyguard Diesel. After losing the title the Michaels/Jannetty feud petered out with Michaels focusing on other title challengers while Jannetty wrestled on the mid-card until leaving the WWF in the Spring of 1994. =The New Rockers= In September 1995, Jannetty returned to the WWF and initially worked in the singles division. In early 1996, Jannetty was introduced to Al Snow and told that he would be his new partner as the New Rockers. The idea was initially going to be a more or less straight up return to The Rockers' gimmick, but the decision was soon made to turn them more \\"silly\\" and become comedy heels according to Marty Jannetty in the book The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams. They were told that the idea was for them to be like watching the 1960s television show The Monkees, complete with Snow being named \\"Leif Cassidy\\" as a play off 1970s idols David Cassidy and Leif Garrett. Going against his better judgment, Jannetty agreed to it, if nothing else than to help Snow out, who was trying to find a bankable gimmick. Jannetty was later informed that former partner Shawn Michaels had been the one to suggest the change in the gimmick. The team was never seriously pushed in the WWF making only a couple of low card PPV appearances before Jannetty decided to leave the WWF in December 1996. =Reunions= In the years following Jannetty's 1996 departure, Michaels became a born-again Christian in real life. This helped the two to patch up their above mentioned off-screen differences once and for all when Michaels shared his faith and aided Jannetty in becoming a Christian. On the SmackDown! shown on March 10, 2005 (taped two days earlier) Kurt Angle announced that as part of his preparation for his WrestleMania 21 match against Michaels' he would face Michaels old partner Jannetty on the following SmackDown. The following Monday, March 14, 2005, Jannetty made a surprise appearance on WWE Raw and, for one night, The Rockers reunited to take on La Résistance (Sylvain Grenier and Rob Conway). Jannetty got the win with the \\"Rocker Dropper\\" after Michaels hit ”Sweet Chin Music” on Grenier. Three days later on SmackDown Angle had promised to make Jannetty ”tap out”, just like he was going to make Michaels tap out at WrestleMania 21. Angle made good on his promise and forced Jannetty to submit to his ankle lock submission hold, but only after a nearly twenty-minute match and an impressive showing for Jannetty which saw him nearly pin the Olympic champion. After two good showings on Raw and SmackDown to convince WWE that he was still a very talented performer, they signed him to a contract. However, due to a domestic incident, Jannetty was arrested and thus unable to meet the commitments of his WWE contract. This led to his released on July 6, 2005. On the February 20, 2006 edition of Raw, Michaels was pitted against four of the five members of the Spirit Squad in their in- ring debut. After he had connected with \\"Sweet Chin Music\\", Michaels was attacked by all five members until an unknown man came storming in to the ring to defend Michaels. During the melee, it was revealed that it was Jannetty coming to defend his former tag team partner. Later on Raw, Mr. McMahon came out to mention that he would offer Jannetty a full-time contract. However, McMahon added a stipulation: Jannetty had to join McMahon's \\"Kiss My Ass Club\\" the following week on Raw. On Raw Jannetty refused to indulge McMahon. McMahon instead offered Jannetty the possibility of breaking Chris Masters' signature submission hold, the Master Lock. Jannetty appeared to almost break the hold, but McMahon (who was officiating) delivered a low blow, and Jannetty was never able to break it, only being released when Michaels ran in to save him. Shortly after Michaels had saved Jannetty, Shane McMahon ran in the ring with a steel chair and knocked out Michaels. The former Rockers were supposed to continue a program with the McMahons, but Jannetty was absent from the next edition of Raw which meant that they had to rewrite the angle leaving Jannetty out of it. In December 2007, Michaels began feuding with Mr. Kennedy. Kennedy was set to face off against Jannetty at the Raw 15th Anniversary Spectacular. Kennedy won the match, but continued beating down Jannetty. Michaels then came out to save his former partner from a beating. Before Michaels had a chance to get in the first punch, Kennedy quickly recognized Michaels and started an assault on him until Triple H, Shawn's DX partner, came out and Kennedy escaped.

It is the eleventh Tom and Jerry short produced by Fred Quimby, and directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, with musical supervision by Scott Bradley and animation by Irven Spence, Pete Burness, Kenneth Muse and George Gordon. Jack Zander was credited on the original print, but his credit was omitted in the 1950 reissue. It was released to theaters on June 26, 1943 by Metro-Goldwyn Mayer. The short features Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse chasing each other in a pseudo-warfare style, and makes numerous references to World War II technology such as jeeps and dive bombers, represented by clever uses of common household items. The Yankee Doodle Mouse won the 1943 Oscar for Best Animated Short Film, making it the first of seven Tom and Jerry cartoons to receive this distinction. This is the first Tom and Jerry short to be animated by Ray Patterson, who arrived from Walt Disney Productions. Patterson would continue to work for Hanna and Barbera until the 1980s. Plot Tom pursues Jerry through a cellar, but the mouse successfully dives into his mousehole. Tom peers into the hole, and Jerry launches a tomato from a mousetrap into his face. Jerry then climbs up the wall and grabs a handful of eggs from a carton marked \\"Hen-Grenades\\". As Tom wipes the tomato off his face, he is promptly covered in egg, with one hit to the eye leaving the effect of him wearing a monocle. Jerry shoots off the corks from a champagne case, knocking Tom into a tub of water with only a pot to keep him afloat. The mouse promptly launches a brick from a spatula, sinking both the pot and Tom. Leading to the 1st war communiqué message, it reads \\"Sighted cat – sank same. Signed, Lt. Jerry Mouse.\\" Later, Tom approaches Jerry's mousehole with a cheese and a mallet in his hand, while Jerry uses a pipe as a makeshift periscope to observe; spotting this trap, Jerry instead opens the ironing board cupboard, sending the board crashing onto Tom's head. Jerry charges down the board on a jeep made from a cheese grater attached to a roller skate, tearing Tom's fur as he speeds past twice, after which the jeep crashes into a wall, sending a sack of flour tumbling down. Adapting quickly to the situation, Jerry grabs the sack and spreads a makeshift flour smokescreen, which blocks Tom's vision but not Jerry's. He smacks the nearly blind Tom in the rear with a board three times, but eventually Tom falls to the ground facing the mouse; Jerry slaps Tom a fourth time before the cat can do anything and then runs for it. Tom, now wearing a bowl as an improvised helmet, throws a stick of dynamite towards Jerry, who immediately throws it back to Tom; this continues until Jerry performs reverse psychology by taking it from Tom, provoking the cat to steal it back and this new cycle to continue until Jerry leaves Tom to witlessly hold the stick, which explodes. Jerry jumps into a tea kettle to escape the cat's wrath, but Tom sees him and throws another firecracker into the kettle; Jerry panics, but the oxygen has run out and the mouse escapes through the spout with no explosion. The puzzled cat opens the kettle's lid and sticks his entire head in just as the firecracker goes off, making him like a sunflower (the sunflower gag was removed on Cartoon Network in the late 1990s and early 2000s due to the short’s blackface reference). Continuing his attempts to blow up the mouse, Tom launches a Paper plane with a firecracker hidden on top, but Jerry blows it back beneath Tom, who barely spots the firecracker before it goes off and is again black in the face. Jerry then plants an enormous stick of dynamite behind Tom; the cat sees it and screams in terror until the cracker splits into successively smaller sticks, ending with a minuscule replica of the original firecracker. Tom laughs, believing this to be harmless, but the dynamite explodes powerfully. Jerry then goes through a hole in a barrel and jumps into a makeshift plane fashioned from an egg carton (launched from a slingshot made from a rubber band). He drops a succession of light bulbs, one of which hits Tom's head, and a banana bomb, which hits Tom's face. Tom grabs a Roman candle and skillfully shoots down Jerry's now weaponless plane, piece by piece. Jerry uses a brassiere to parachute from the plane, but is again shot down by Tom. Jerry races into his mousehole to escape, but Tom pushes another Roman candle into the hole and fires off six shots. The fireballs pursue Jerry through the mouse hole through the barrel going back and forth until he eventually he leads them into a hose, which he shoots like a machine gun into a barrel where Tom is hiding. The barrel explodes, leaving Tom riding the remaining parts of the barrel like a bicycle, which then crashes into the wall. Recovering, Tom fires a dart gun at Jerry, which hits him on the tail as he again attempts to dive into his mousehole. Tom grabs Jerry and ties him to an ignited rocket; Jerry pretends to help himself be tied up, but tricks Tom into strapping his own hands to the rocket. Jerry emerges from the ropes, and Tom does not realize what has happened until Jerry waves at him. Tom fails to blow out the fuse, and the rocket shoots high into the sky and explodes. The explosion forms the Stars and Stripes. Jerry proudly salutes the flag, and a final war communiqué is displayed, which reads \\"SEND MORE CATS!\\" signed by Jerry.

It is the second largest river in Quebec, surpassed only by the Saint Lawrence River. Originally, the La Grande River drained an area of and had a mean discharge of . Since the 1980s when hydroelectric development diverted the Eastmain and Caniapiscau rivers into the La Grande, its total catchment area has increased to about , and its mean discharge increased to more than . In November 2009, the Rupert River was also partially diverted, adding another to the basin. At one time, this river was known as the \\"Fort George River\\". The Hudson's Bay Company operated a trading post on the river at Big River House from 1803 to 1824. In 1837, a large trading post was established at Fort George on an island at the mouth of the river. In the early 20th century, this trading post became a village as the Crees of the James Bay region abandoned their nomadic way of life and settled nearby. The modern Cree village of Chisasibi, which replaced Fort George in 1980, is situated on the southern shore of the La Grande River, several kilometers to the East. Tributaries Significant tributaries of La Grande River include: *Kanaaupscow River *Sakami River **Eastmain River (diverted) ***Opinaca River ***Rupert River (diverted) *Rivière de Pontois **Rivière de la Corvette *Laforge River **Caniapiscau River (diverted) Hydro-electric development The river has been extensively developed as a source of hydroelectric power by Hydro-Québec, starting in 1974. An area of was flooded and almost all of the flow of the Eastmain River and a large portion of the Rupert River were diverted into the La Grande watershed. The following generating stations are on the La Grande River and its tributaries in upstream order: *La-Grande-1 (LG-1) *Robert-Bourassa *La Grande-2A (LG-2A) *La Grande-3 (LG-3) *La Grande-4 (LG-4) *Laforge-1 (LF-1) *Laforge-2 (LF-2) *Brisay *Eastmain-1 As a result of the development projects, the Cree people of the region lost some parts of their traditional hunting and trapping territories (about 10% of the hunting and trapping territories used by the Cree of Chisasibi). Organic mercury levels increased in the fish, which forms an important part of their diet, as the organic material trapped by the rising waters in the new reservoirs began to filter into the food chain. Careful follow-up by Cree health authorities since the 1980s has been largely successful. The authorities continue to promote the regular consumption of fish, with the notable exception of the predatory species living in the reservoirs, which still show high levels of mercury.

Geography Part of Halifax Harbour, it measures approximately 3.5 km in length and 0.5 km in width and defines the western side of the Halifax Peninsula. The waterway is oriented along a bearing of 135° (southeast) and 315° (northwest). The Northwest Arm contains several small islands including Melville Island, home of the Armdale Yacht Club, and Deadman's Island, at the northwestern end near Armdale. There is a large breakwater, constructed from slate bedrock, located adjacent to South Street called the Fyfe Breakwater after the late local naturalist TLC Ratt- Fyfe. There is a public beach (the only one on the Arm) located at Sir Sanford Fleming Park which has only recently been deemed safe for swimming since the Harbor Solutions Project began operations in 2008. History The Mi'kmaq Nation called this water body \\"Waygwalteech\\" which translates to \\"salt water all the way up.\\" Early English settlers called it the \\"Sandwich River\\" and also the \\"Hawkes River.\\" The Mi'kmaq people attacked the British blockhouse on the Northwest Arm numerous times during Father Le Loutre's War. In 1751, there were two attacks on blockhouses surrounding Halifax. Mi'kmaq attacked the North Blockhouse (located at the north end of Joseph Howe Drive) and killed the men on guard. They also attacked near the South Blockhouse (located at the south end of Joseph Howe Drive), at a sawmill on a stream flowing out of Chocolate Lake into the Northwest Arm. They killed two men.Piers, Harry. The Evolution of the Halifax Fortress (Halifax, PANS, Pub. #7, 1947), p. 6 As cited in Peter Landry's. The Lion and the Lily. Vol. 1.

Plot summary Adam Malone is a supermarket manager in Los Angeles who is obsessed with blonde movie star Sharon Fields. While watching her on a television in a bar one night he meets four other men who are also enamored of her. They get to talking, and soon are planning her abduction. Believing the sex stories put out by her manager, they think that if they kidnap her she will understand their lust and have sex with them. They get a van and disguise it as an exterminator's, scout out her neighborhood and track her daily routine, find an isolated location to take her to, and plan vacations from their individual work. A sudden crisis takes place when they discover that she will be leaving for Europe, forcing them to move their plans ahead of schedule. They confront her while she is taking a daily walk, and ask for direction. When she stops to help, she is grabbed and chloroformed. After being driven unconscious to their hideout, Sharon awakes and finds out what they want. She explains that the publicity is untrue, but one of the men won't take no for an answer and rapes her. Two of the others follow, with Adam not taking part. Deciding that they should not let the situation go to waste, they demand a ransom from the movie studio. Sharon writes a letter as proof they have her, but cleverly uses the first letters in each word to give the police a clue to her whereabouts. The ransom drop ends up with the three rapists killed, and Sharon saved. Because Adam did not take advantage of her, she omits his part in her abduction. Adam is soon back as his job, obsessed with a new younger actress, and planning on forming a new fan club.

It was discovered on 3 September 2000, by American amateur astronomer Loren Ball at his Emerald Lane Observatory in Alabama, United States. The Q-type asteroid was named after the city of Decatur, location of the discovering observatory.  Orbit and classification  Decatur is a member of the Koronis family (), a very large outer asteroid family with nearly co-planar ecliptical orbits. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.7–3.2 AU once every 5 years and 1 month (1,847 days; semi-major axis of 2.95 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.07 and an inclination of 1° with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid's observation arc begins 8 years prior to its official discovery observation, with a precovery taken by the Steward Observatory's Spacewatch survey at Kitt Peak in January 1992.  Naming  This minor planet was named after the city of Decatur in the U.S. state of Alabama, location of the discovering observatory and home of the discoverer. Decatur is located near NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 27 April 2002 ().  Physical characteristics  In the SDSS-based taxonomy, Decatur is a Q-type asteroid, while members of the Koronis family are typically S-type asteroid.

It has diameter 2. Its automorphism group has 120 elements, and is in fact the symmetric group S_5. Algebraic graph theory is a branch of mathematics in which algebraic methods are applied to problems about graphs. This is in contrast to geometric, combinatoric, or algorithmic approaches. There are three main branches of algebraic graph theory, involving the use of linear algebra, the use of group theory, and the study of graph invariants. Branches of algebraic graph theory Using linear algebra = The first branch of algebraic graph theory involves the study of graphs in connection with linear algebra. Especially, it studies the spectrum of the adjacency matrix, or the Laplacian matrix of a graph (this part of algebraic graph theory is also called spectral graph theory). For the Petersen graph, for example, the spectrum of the adjacency matrix is (−2, −2, −2, −2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3). Several theorems relate properties of the spectrum to other graph properties. As a simple example, a connected graph with diameter D will have at least D+1 distinct values in its spectrum. Aspects of graph spectra have been used in analysing the synchronizability of networks. =Using group theory= The second branch of algebraic graph theory involves the study of graphs in connection to group theory, particularly automorphism groups and geometric group theory. The focus is placed on various families of graphs based on symmetry (such as symmetric graphs, vertex-transitive graphs, edge-transitive graphs, distance-transitive graphs, distance-regular graphs, and strongly regular graphs), and on the inclusion relationships between these families. Certain of such categories of graphs are sparse enough that lists of graphs can be drawn up. By Frucht's theorem, all groups can be represented as the automorphism group of a connected graph (indeed, of a cubic graph).R. Frucht. Graphs of Degree 3 with given abstract group, Can. J. Math. 3 1949. Another connection with group theory is that, given any group, symmetrical graphs known as Cayley graphs can be generated, and these have properties related to the structure of the group. A Cayley graph for the alternating group A4, forming a truncated tetrahedron in three dimensions. All Cayley graphs are vertex-transitive, but some vertex- transitive graphs (like the Petersen graph) are not Cayley graphs. A proper vertex coloring of the Petersen graph with 3 colors, the minimum number possible. According to the chromatic polynomial, there are 120 such colorings with 3 colors. This second branch of algebraic graph theory is related to the first, since the symmetry properties of a graph are reflected in its spectrum. In particular, the spectrum of a highly symmetrical graph, such as the Petersen graph, has few distinct values (the Petersen graph has 3, which is the minimum possible, given its diameter). For Cayley graphs, the spectrum can be related directly to the structure of the group, in particular to its irreducible characters.* =Studying graph invariants= Finally, the third branch of algebraic graph theory concerns algebraic properties of invariants of graphs, and especially the chromatic polynomial, the Tutte polynomial and knot invariants. The chromatic polynomial of a graph, for example, counts the number of its proper vertex colorings. For the Petersen graph, this polynomial is t(t-1)(t-2)(t^7-12t^6+67t^5-230t^4+529t^3-814t^2+775t-352). In particular, this means that the Petersen graph cannot be properly colored with one or two colors, but can be colored in 120 different ways with 3 colors. Much work in this area of algebraic graph theory was motivated by attempts to prove the four color theorem. However, there are still many open problems, such as characterizing graphs which have the same chromatic polynomial, and determining which polynomials are chromatic.

It was produced by Max Fleischer for Fleischer Studios, Inc. and directed by Dave Fleischer, with the title song by Sammy Timberg. The voices of Popeye and J. Wellington Wimpy are performed by Jack Mercer, with additional voices by Mae Questel as Olive Oyl, and Gus Wickie as Sindbad the Sailor.  Plot  In this short, Sindbad the Sailor (presumably Bluto playing a \\"role\\") proclaims himself, in song, to be the greatest sailor, adventurer and lover in the world and \\"the most remarkable, extraordinary fellow,\\" a claim that is inadvertently challenged by Popeye as he innocently sings his usual song while sailing by within earshot of Sindbad's island with Olive Oyl and J. Wellington Wimpy on board. Sindbad orders his huge roc to kidnap Popeye's girlfriend, Olive Oyl, and wreck Popeye's ship, forcing him and Wimpy to swim to shore. Sindbad relishes making Olive his trophy wife, which is interrupted by Popeye's arrival. Sindbad then challenges the one-eyed sailor to a series of obstacles to prove his greatness, including fighting the roc, a two-headed giant named Boola (an apparent parody reference to The Three Stooges), and Sindbad himself. Popeye makes short work of the bird and the giant, but Sindbad almost gets the best of him until Popeye produces his can of spinach, which gives him the power to soundly defeat Sindbad and proclaim himself \\"the most remarkable, extraordinary fella.\\" A subtly dark running gag features the hamburger-loving Wimpy chasing after a duck on the island with a meat grinder, with the intention of grinding it up so that he can fry it into his favorite dish, but the duck not only escapes, but also snatches away Wimpy's last burger in retaliation when he gives up. Many of the scenes in this short feature make use of the Fleischer's \\"Steroptical Process\\", or \\"Setback Tabletop\\" process, which used modeled sets to create 3D backgrounds for the cartoon.  Release and reception  This short was the first of the three Popeye Color Specials, which, at over sixteen minutes each, were billed as \\"A Popeye Feature.\\" Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor was nominated for the 1936 Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons, but lost to Walt Disney's Silly Symphony The Country Cousin. Footage from this short was later used in the 1952 Famous Studios Popeye cartoon Big Bad Sindbad, in which Popeye relates the story of his encounter with Sindbad to his 3 nephews. The Popeye Color Specials, Popeye the Sailor Meets Ali Baba's Forty Thieves, and Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp (both of which were also adapted from a story featured in One Thousand and One Nights) are in the public domain, and are widely available on home video and DVD, often transferred from poor quality, old, faded prints. A fully restored version with the original Paramount mountain logo opening and closing titles is available on the Popeye the Sailor: 1933-1938, Volume 1 DVD set from Warner Bros. Producer and special effects artist, Ray Harryhausen stated in his Fantasy Film Scrapbook that Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor was a major influence on his production of The 7th Voyage of Sinbad. Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor has been deemed \\"culturally significant\\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. In 1994, the film was voted #17 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field, making it the highest ranked Fleischer Studios cartoon in the book.

The service and the group associated with it grew to national prominence, but the service was stopped in 1995 following allegations of sexual and emotional abuse. Origins Beginning as a simple alternative format service under the leadership of Chris Brain, the group responsible for it developed a leadership structure that was endorsed by the leadership of St Thomas' Church. The average age of the members was 24 for much of NOS's life. The membership was significantly from non-church backgrounds. Starting with about 10 people who worked on designing and creating the services, the congregation grew to almost 600 members while resident at St Thomas' Church. Main themes included care for the planet and concern about its abuse, simple lifestyle and development of relationships with non-churched people. By 1988, David Lunn, then Bishop of Sheffield, sanctioned a move to a new site at Ponds Forge Rotunda in the centre of Sheffield. Around the same time, Chris Brain underwent training to be ordained as priest in the Church of England.http://members.tripod.com/neil_hopkins/docs/nos.htm The Planetary Mass at Pond's Forge was marked by both bold liturgical experimentation and naive hopefulness. The suspended Roman Catholic priest and American Dominican theologian Matthew Fox was consulted. Demise The number of community members stopped growing and service attendance plateaued at about 300. A significant practical weakness in terms of duty of care was the lack of accountability for NOS and its absence from diocesan accountability. This was allowed because of its perceived international significance, which in the end came to nothing. Plans for communities elsewhere were in talks. In 1995, a number of complaints began to surface of the sexual abuse of women in the group by Chris Brain. After an investigation by the Diocese of Sheffield, the group was shut down in August 1995. The Bishop of Sheffield demanded Brain's resignation after he confessed to having sexual relationships with young women in the congregation. There were also calls from former members of the congregation that he be defrocked. The Archbishop of York banned Brain from acting as an ordained priest. Initially refusing to step down, Brain eventually resigned in November 1995, the week before a documentary on the abuse scandal was aired. He then checked himself into a psychiatric hospital. The Diocese of Sheffield, through a seconded pastoral team led by Rachel Ross, the Reverend Andrew Teal and the Reverend Peter Craig-Wild, attempted to manage the pastoral care both of Brain and members of the community wounded by the scandal. A remnant of the community continued to meet, under different leadership, for some years afterwards in Sheffield.

Skellington recorded and self-released This Town's Gone Dry in 1991, and the Skellington EP was released a year later in 1992.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 29, 1993. The episode revolves around the fictional holiday \\"Whacking Day\\", celebrated annually, in which the citizens of Springfield drive snakes into the town square, then fatally club them. The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Jeffrey Lynch; Barry White, who had expressed a wish to appear in the show, guest stars as himself. It was pitched by George Meyer, who wanted to create an episode against the mistreatment of snakes (the episode ended up winning a Genesis Award). The episode includes the first appearance of Superintendent Chalmers, and it features an Itchy & Scratchy parody of Oliver Stone's film JFK. Plot During an inspection by Superintendent Chalmers, Principal Skinner lures Bart, Jimbo, Kearney, Dolph and Nelson into a utility basement with the promise of free mountain bikes and locks the door. Bart escapes through a ventilation shaft and takes Groundskeeper Willie's tractor for a joyride, accidentally crashing into Superintendent Chalmers who receives medical treatment from the cafeteria lady. Chalmers is so furious, Skinner is passed over for a promotion and Skinner promptly expels Bart from the school for costing him a promotion. After Bart is quickly expelled from a new private Christian school, Marge decides to homeschool Bart. Meanwhile, Kent Brockman announces that Springfield's annual \\"Whacking Day\\" is approaching. Each year on May 10, the people of Springfield drive snakes to the center of town and beat them to death. The tradition appalls Lisa, who finds no support from any of the adults of the town. Barry White arrives to begin the festivities, but is disgusted and quickly leaves when he discovers what the holiday is about. After Marge takes Bart on a field trip to Olde Springfield Towne, Bart discovers that the origins of Whacking Day, which supposedly involved Jebediah Springfield, is a lie because it conflicts with a major Revolutionary War battle in which he took part, and suggests to Lisa that they lure the snakes to safety by playing music with a lot of bass and putting the stereo speakers to the ground. White, who just happens to have been walking by, agrees to help by singing \\"Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Babe\\" (with different lyrics to fit the situation), attracting hundreds of snakes into the house. The pursuing crowd arrives, but they are soon turned around on the subject of Whacking Day by Bart's newfound knowledge. It turns out that the day was actually invented in 1924 as an excuse to beat up the Irish. Lisa also tells the town about the positive influences that the snakes have had on the town folks, such as killing rodents. The town agrees to give up the tradition and Skinner is impressed with Bart's efforts, welcomes him back to the school as a reward for his studying and reunite with the rest of the students and upon beginning to say the names of his former acquaintances (Jimbo, Kearney, Dolph and Nelson), but then realizes in horror that he completely forgot all about the bullies, who are spending the time in the basement talking about their feelings and giving each other hugs. Skinner and Willie race to the school with the mountain bikes to avoid a potential lawsuit. When Willie asks Skinner what they will do if they boys have died after being forgotten for days, Skinner assures him that the two of them will ride the bikes into Mexico. However, Willie mutters to himself that he plans on turning Skinner over at the Mexican border. Production Barry White voiced himself in the episode, singing an original version of \\"Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Babe\\". Writer George Meyer, who was very \\"animal conscious\\", was interested in writing an episode related to an annual ritual held in a Texan town, where the townspeople would beat rattlesnakes with sticks. Meyer did not have time to pen the episode himself, so the idea was given to John Swartzwelder. The subject matter of \\"beating snakes\\" worried the staff who thought that many would deem it cruel, even though the episode's message is against the mistreatment of snakes. The episode's first act was one of the shortest the staff had ever written at that time, roughly ten pages in length, but with no ideas to expand, they left it as it was. Due to this, the main plot does not start until the beginning of the second act, as the writers could not come up with much material for it. In order to speed up animation, director Jeffrey Lynch \\"begged\\" storyboard artists Kevin O'Brien and Steve Markowski to help him with the episode. They three spent months on the episode. Barry White wanted to guest star on the show, so he was written into the plot. He sang \\"Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Babe\\" specially for the episode, rather than using a recorded version. The song Grampa was supposed to sing in his flashback, showing how he posed as a German cabaret singer in World War II, was \\"Lili Marlene\\" by Marlene Dietrich. The staff could not get the rights to it because, according to the people who own the song, \\"everybody makes fun of it\\". Much of the flashback was pitched by Conan O'Brien. The episode marks the first appearance of Superintendent Chalmers. The staff wanted to introduce a boss for Skinner, and Wallace Wolodarsky pitched his name. Much of the dialogue and interactions between Skinner and Chalmers were ad-libbed by Harry Shearer and Hank Azaria. Cultural references The untitled Itchy & Scratchy short, with \\"guest director\\" Oliver Stone, is a parody of the scene where Jack Ruby shoots Lee Harvey Oswald in Stone's film JFK: someone is heard to shout, \\"Oh God! Get his gun!\\" as the screenplay draws to a close. The song \\"O Whacking Day\\" uses the same tune as the Christmas carol \\"O Tannenbaum\\", known in English as \\"O Christmas Tree\\". Additionally, Bob Woodward is shown to be the author of the book The Truth About Whacking Day. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Whacking Day\\" finished tied for 25th in the weekly ratings for the week of April 26 – May 2, 1993 with a Nielsen rating of 12.2. It was the highest rated show from the Fox Network that week. For \\"consciousness-raising on behalf of animal issues\\", the episode was awarded the Genesis Award for \\"Best Television Prime Time Animated Series\\" in 1994. Jeffrey Lee Puckett of The Courier-Journal cited \\"Whacking Day\\" as \\"the series' richest episode\\". He wrote: \\"In 22 remarkable minutes, 'Whacking Day' skewers the quality of America's educational system, self- aggrandizing politicians, greed, the mob mentality, sexuality in the age of political correctness and the whole notion of political correctness, and makes a hero of Barry White.\\" Chris Vognar of The Dallas Morning News noted the episode was one of the fourth season's best episodes in his review of the DVD. The show's creator Matt Groening considers Homer's \\"I am evil Homer\\" fantasy to be one of the greatest moments in the show's history. Andrew Martin of Prefix Mag named Barry White his fifth favorite musical guest on The Simpsons out of a list of ten. A 2003 article in The Journal News reported that records show genuine \\"Whacking Days\\" having taken place in Eastchester, New York from 1665 onwards: \\"That one day every spring be chosen for the destroying of rattle snakes.\\" The article quoted show runner Al Jean as saying: \\"I agree with the premise of the episode: leave the snakes alone. They didn't hurt anybody.\\" Since 2009, citizens in North Queensland, Australia, have held an annual \\"Toad Day Out\\" every March 29 in which thousands of cane toads (an invasive and highly destructive species not native to Australia) are captured and humanely destroyed. The event was inspired by the episode.

It includes, but is not limited to, the legal concept of standing, which is used to determine if the party bringing the suit is a party appropriate to establishing whether an actual adversarial issue exists. Essentially, justiciability seeks to address whether a court possesses the ability to provide adequate resolution of the dispute; where a court believes that it cannot offer such a final determination, the matter is not justiciable. In the United States Federal courts = Justiciability is one of several criteria that the United States Supreme Court uses to make a judgment granting writ of certiorari (\\"cert.\\"). For an issue to be justiciable by a United States federal court, all of the following conditions must be met: # The parties must not be seeking an advisory opinion. # There must be an actual controversy between the parties,Muskrat v. United States, meaning that the parties cannot agree to a lawsuit where all parties seek the same particular judgment from the court (known as a collusive suit or friendly suit); rather, the parties must each be seeking a different outcome. # The question must be neither unripe nor moot.Poe v. Ullman, ; DeFunis v. Odegaard, #*An unripe question is one for which there is not yet at least a threatened injury to the plaintiff, or where the available judicial alternatives have not all been exhausted. #*A moot question is one for which the potential for an injury to occur has ceased to exist, or where the injury has been removed. However, if the issue is likely to reoccur, yet will continually become moot before any challenge can reach a court of competent jurisdiction (\\"capable of repetition, yet evading review\\"), courts may allow a case that is moot to be litigated.Roe v. Wade, # The suit must not be seeking judgment upon a political question.Nixon v. United States, #* Political questions involve matters where there is: #** \\"a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department\\" (meaning that the U.S. Constitution requires another branch of government to resolve questions regarding the issue); #** \\"a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it\\"; #** an \\"impossibility of deciding [a matter] without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion\\"; #** an \\"impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government\\"; #** \\"an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made\\"; or #** a \\"potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.\\"Baker v. Carr, #* Political questions include such issues as whether the nation is \\"at war\\" with another country, or whether the U.S. Senate has properly \\"tried\\" an impeached federal officer. If the case fails to meet any one of these requirements, the court cannot hear it. = State courts = State courts tend to require a similar set of circumstances, although some states permit their courts to give advisory opinions on questions of law, even though there may be no actual dispute between parties to resolve.See RICHARD H. FALLON, JR. ET AL., HART AND WECHSLER'S THE FEDERAL COURTS AND THE FEDERAL SYSTEM 50-51 (7th ed. 2015). Unlike federal courts with limited jurisdiction, state courts are not bound by the “case or controversy” clause of Art. III, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution.5 Okla. Prac., Appellate Practice § 3:9 (2019 ed.) Federal courts' decisions on mootness, advisory opinions, and related matters may be considered and even found persuasive, depending on the state's laws, but are not controlling.§ 22:1.Nonjusticiability—In general, 1 Cal. Affirmative Def. § 22:1 (2d ed.) Under the \\"ministerial exception\\" based on the First Amendment, courts decline to hear defamation, employment and other actions founded on statements or beliefs that necessarily implicate the truth or falsity of religious doctrine. In the United Kingdom The issue of non-justiciability has been recognized in Buttes Gas and Oil Co. v Hammer,Buttes Gas and Oil Co. v Hammer [1982] AC 888. The case involved a commercial dispute between Buttes and Occidental Petroleum over oil exploitation rights near the island of Abu Musa, disputed between Sharjah, one of the United Arab Emirates, and Iran. The UK was involved due to its historic role as protector of the Trucial States, the precursor to the UAE, in which it controlled the foreign affairs of Sharjah, but this relationship had ended in 1971. The commercial dispute was ruled nonjusticiable, since resolving it would require resolving the territorial dispute, a definitively political question. where Lord Wilberforce stated that the principle \\"that the courts will not adjudicate upon the transactions of foreign sovereign states\\" is not a matter of discretion, but is \\"inherent in the nature of the judicial process\\".McGoldrick, Dominic (2010) \\"The Boundaries of Justiciability\\", 59 International and Comparative Law Quarterly 981Martyniszyn, Marek (2011) \\"Avoidance Techniques: State Related Defences in International Antitrust Cases\\", CCP Working Paper No. 11-2 The principle was further developed in Kuwait Airways Corp. v Iraqi Airways Co..Kuwait Airways Corp. v. Iraqi Airways Co. [2002] UKHL 19. Kuwait Airways sought damages for conversion of aircraft seized during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait; Iraqi Airways sought to dismiss the claim as nonjusticiable on the grounds that it was done on the basis of an Iraqi decree transferring ownership to Iraqi Airways, which should be recognized as having been valid foreign law. While quoting Buttes v Hammer and approving the principles laid down in that case, the Lords nonetheless ruled that the decree was invalid both in international law and Iraqi law and the nonjusticiability argument failed.\\"Case note: Kuwait Airways Corporation v Iraqi Airways Company\\", Janeen M.

The word is constructed from Greek petra (), \\"rock\\", or petros (), \\"stone\\", and īchōr (), the fluid that flows in the veins of the gods in Greek mythology. Origins The phenomenon was first scientifically described in a March 1964 paper by Australian researchers Isabel Bear and Dick Thomas, published in the journal Nature. Apparently, the printed text is a copy from CSIRO journal Ecos, issue February 1976, p. 32. Actually print of A.Word.A.Day --petrichor. Thomas coined the term \\"petrichor\\" to refer to what had previously been known as \\"argillaceous odour\\". In the article, the authors describe how the smell derives from an oil exuded by certain plants during dry periods, whereupon it is absorbed by clay-based soils and rocks. During rain, the oil is released into the air along with another compound, geosmin, a metabolic by-product of certain actinobacteria, which is emitted by wet soil, producing the distinctive scent; ozone may also be present if there is lightning. In a follow-up paper, Bear and Thomas (1965) showed that the oil slows seed germination and early plant growth. Long before this phenomenon received its name in 1964, it had been noticed and discussed in scientific circles. In May 1891 a brief note by TL Phipson appeared in The Scientific American refers to the subject. He wrote, \\"This subject, with which I was occupied more than twenty-five years ago, appears from a paragraph in a late number of the Chemical News to have recently attracted the attention of Professor Berthelot and M. Andre.\\" No doubt, Phipson was referring to a short paper read by Berthelot and André at the meeting of the French Académie des Sciences on 23 April 1891, and printed in Volume 112 (1891) of Comptes Rendus, entitled \\"Sur l'Odeur propre de la Terre\\". Phipson continues, \\"I find, on referring to my old notes, which are dated 1865, that it is doubtful whether I ever published the results of these observations; and as the distinguished chemists I have just named have not quite solved the problem, I hasten to give the results I obtained so long ago.\\" He then theorizes that the odour \\"... was due to the presence of organic substances closely related to the essential oils of plants ...\\" and that these substances consist of \\"... the fragrance emitted by thousands of flowers ...\\" absorbed into the pores of the soil, and only released when displaced by rain. After attempts to isolate it, he found that it \\"... appeared to be very similar to, if not identical with, bromo- cedren, derived from essence of cedar.\\" Mechanism In 2015, scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) used high-speed cameras to record how the scent moves into the air. The tests involved approximately 600 experiments on 28 different surfaces, including engineered materials and soil samples. When a raindrop lands on a porous surface, air from the pores forms small bubbles, which float to the surface and release aerosols. Such aerosols carry the scent, as well as bacteria and viruses from the soil. Raindrops that move at a slower rate tend to produce more aerosols; this serves as an explanation for why the petrichor is more common after light rains. Actinomycetes is the bacterium responsible for producing spores in soil. The human nose is extremely sensitive to geosmin and is able to detect it at concentrations as low as 5 parts per trillion. Some scientists believe that humans appreciate the rain scent because ancestors may have relied on rainy weather for survival.

This causes the surface to depress into a sink (which subsidence craters are sometimes called; see sink hole). It is possible for further collapse to occur from the sink into the explosion chamber.

These two corps were the first corps created in the Western Theater. While the XIV Corps constituted all forces under the command of William S. Rosecrans, the XIII Corps likewise constituted all the forces under Ulysses S. Grant. Because of the corps' immense size and the fact that it was virtually synonymous with the Army of the Tennessee, Grant chose to subdivide the corps into the Right, Left and Center wings. In December 1862 it was officially divided into the XIII Corps, XV Corps, XVI Corps and XVII Corps. Grant remained in command of the Army of the Tennessee and John A. McClernand assumed command of the XIII Corps. Before the official order was passed along to all the wing commanders, William T. Sherman, commander of the Right Wing, embarked on an expedition against Vicksburg. Sherman's wing of the XIII Corps fought the Battle of Chickasaw Bayou on December 26–29. Although the official date which the Right Wing was designated the XV Corps was December 22, most of the reports regarding the battle at Chickasaw Bluffs still refer to the Union forces as part of the XIII Corps. No matter the designation, it was the first time many of the troops had been under fire. =Arkansas Post= Adding to the identity crisis the XIII Corps faced in its early years was John A. McClernand's expedition against Fort Hindman at Arkansas Post. McClernand was given his XIII Corps and Sherman's XV Corps (now officially using that designation). McClernand labeled these forces the Army of the Mississippi and renamed the XIII Corps \\"I Corps\\" and the XV Corps \\"II Corps\\". McClernand commanded the Army and placed General George W. Morgan in command of the I Corps (former XIII Corps). The divisions of Andrew J. Smith and Peter J. Osterhaus participated in the battle. Only Stephen Burbridge's brigade of Smith's division bore any heavy fighting. =Vicksburg= With the impending campaign against Vicksburg, Grant took personal command of the operation. McClernand returned to corps command and the Army of the Mississippi was merged back into the Army of the Tennessee and the XIII Corps took on its official title. As the Vicksburg campaign opened the XIII Corps was composed of the 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th Divisions commanded respectively by Osterhaus, Andrew Jackson Smith, Alvin P. Hovey, Leonard F. Ross and Eugene A. Carr. Ross' division was stationed in Arkansas during the entire campaign and did not participate in any engagements with the rest of the corps. In July, this division (now led by Frederick Salomon) fought at the Battle of Helena as part of the District of Eastern Arkansas under Benjamin M. Prentiss. The Battle of Port Gibson was fought by the XIII Corps, with the aid of a portion of the XVII Corps. McClernand did not bring the full force of the corps to bear at the Battle of Champion Hill but Hovey's division led the attack on the Confederate right. Immediately following the victory at Champion's Hill the Battle of Big Black River Bridge was again fought exclusively by the XIII Corps, Carr's division bearing the brunt of the fight. When Grant initiated siege operations the XIII Corps took up a position on the Union left. During the assaults on Vicksburg the XIII Corps lost nearly 1,500 soldiers. McClernand had been a long time thorn in Grant's side and on June 19, Grant found an opportunity to remove him from command. His replacement was Edward O. C. Ord, a friend of Grant's who had just recovered from a wound sustained in 1862. Ord led the corps throughout the rest of the siege. After Vicksburg fell, William T. Sherman led an expedition back to Jackson, Mississippi to clear the city of Confederates which had gathered there. Sherman took with him the XIII Corps and attached to it the division under Jacob G. Lauman from the XVI Corps. General Carr, who temporarily left the army due to sickness, had been replaced in division command by William P. Benton. =Texas and Louisiana= After the fall of Jackson the corps returned to Vicksburg and then transferred to the Department of the Gulf. The District of Eastern Arkansas had been detached from the Corps; AJ Smith had been reassigned to command a post in Tennessee; Osterhaus had been reassigned to command a division in the XV Corps; Hovey took leave of the army due to the death of his wife; two of the divisions in the field were consolidated under the command of Cadwallader C. Washburn; and General Herron's division was attached. General Banks used the XIII Corps to conduct his coastal campaign against Texas during the fall of 1863, capturing Brownsville. By February 1864 corps headquarters were in Texas and General McClernand had returned to command. =Red River= The 1st and 2nd Divisions remained in Texas but Nathaniel P. Banks took with him the 3rd and 4th Divisions during the Red River Campaign. During the first part of the campaign the corps was commanded by Thomas E. G. Ransom, the 3rd Division by General Robert A. Cameron and the 4th Division by Colonel William J. Landram. The corps fought at the Battle of Mansfield. Ransom was wounded at Mansfield and was succeeded in command of the corps by General Cameron. A few weeks later Michael K. Lawler of the 1st Division in Texas became the official corps commander. General McClernand however assumed direct command of the two divisions fighting in Louisiana under Banks. McClernand was relieved of command due to ill health and Lawler himself personally commanded this detachment. Shortly after William P. Benton was assigned to the corps command but Lawler remained in command of the detachment in Louisiana. Lawler led the XIII Corps Detachment at the Battle of Mansura. =Mobile= The corps was discontinued on June 11, 1864. On February 18, 1865 it was reorganized under the command of Gordon Granger with three divisions commanded respectively by James C. Veatch, Christopher C. Andrews and William P. Benton. This new form of the XIII Corps fought in the Battle of Fort Blakely which led to the fall of the city of Mobile, Alabama. The corps was discontinued for the final time July 20, 1865. The men of the XIII Corps were never designated an official corps badge and therefore never wore any form of a corps badge during the war.

First released on March 22, 2005, for the PlayStation 2 (PS2) console, it is the first installment in the series of the same name and the third chronologically. Loosely based on Greek mythology, it is set in ancient Greece with vengeance as its central motif. The player controls the protagonist Kratos, a Spartan warrior who serves the Olympian Gods. The goddess Athena tasks Kratos with killing Ares, the God of War and Kratos' former mentor who tricked Kratos into killing his wife and daughter. As Ares besieges Athens out of hatred for Athena, Kratos embarks on a quest to find the one object capable of stopping the god once and for all: Pandora's Box. The gameplay of God of War focuses on combo-based combat, achieved through the player's main weapon—the Blades of Chaos—and a secondary weapon acquired later in the game. It features quick time events that require the player to complete various game controller actions in a timed sequence to defeat stronger enemies and bosses. The player can use up to four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability as alternative combat options. It also features puzzles and platforming elements. God of War sold more than 4.6 million copies worldwide, making it the fourteenth best-selling PlayStation 2 game of all time. Regarded as one of the best action-adventure games for the platform, it won several \\"Game of the Year\\" awards. In 2009, entertainment website IGN named God of War the seventh-best PlayStation 2 game of all time. It has been highly praised for its graphics, sound, story, and gameplay and has been hailed as one of the greatest video games ever made. Success of the game led to the development of seven more games and expansion into other media. The game and its first sequel, God of War II, were remastered and released in November 2009 as part of the God of War Collection, and in 2012, the remastered version was re-released as part of the God of War Saga, both for the PlayStation 3 (PS3). A novelization of the game was published in May 2010 and a film adaptation has been in development since 2005. Gameplay God of War is a third-person single player action-adventure video game with hack and slash elements, viewed from a fixed camera perspective. The player controls the character Kratos in combo-based combat, platforming, and puzzle game elements, and battles Greek mythological foes that include undead soldiers, harpies, minotaurs, Medusa and the Gorgons, cyclopes, wraiths, Sirens, satyrs, centaurs, cerberuses, and boss opponents—the Hydra and a giant minotaur known as Pandora's Guardian. Platforming elements require the player to climb walls and ladders, jump across chasms, swing on ropes, and balance across beams to proceed through sections of the game. Some puzzles are simple, such as moving a box so that the player can use it as a jumping-off point to access a pathway unreachable with normal jumping, but others are more complex, such as finding several items across different areas of the game to unlock one door. Throughout the game world, the player finds green, red, and blue chests that contain orbs of the corresponding color. Green orbs replenish the player's health, blue orbs replenish magic, and red orbs provide experience for upgrading weapons and magic and replenish the Rage meter, which, if full, allows for the usage of the Rage of the Gods ability. Red orbs are also collected by killing foes and destroying certain inanimate objects. The player can also find Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers that increase the length of the Health and Magic Meters, respectively. =Combat= alt=Character Kratos attacks a sea-monster while falling in the air. Kratos' main weapon is the Blades of Chaos: a pair of blades attached to chains wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung in various maneuvers. Later in the game, Kratos acquires a secondary weapon called the Blade of Artemis: a large sword that offers alternative combat options. Kratos also learns to use four magical abilities (like Zeus' Fury, which allows him to throw lightning bolts at distant targets) which allow him to kill individual and multiple targets. Other magical abilities include Medusa's Gaze, Poseidon's Rage, and Army of Hades. A relic called Poseidon's Trident allows Kratos to breathe underwater and navigate through this environment. Early in the game, Kratos acquires a special ability called Rage of the Gods, which provides temporary invulnerability and increased attack damage. In combat, a quick time event (QTE) is initiated when the player has weakened a strong foe. The player performs a sequence of actions on the game controller shortly after an image of its circle button appears as an on-screen prompt. This allows for limited control of Kratos during a QTE cinematic sequence, which, if successful, ends the battle; failure usually results in damaging Kratos. Similar in function is a quick time sex mini-game that occurs when Kratos encounters female twins; this became a regular feature throughout the series until God of War: Ghost of Sparta (2010). When the game is completed, a challenge mode—ten trials called the Challenge of the Gods—is unlocked; this requires players to complete a series of specific tasks. The player may unlock bonus costumes for Kratos, behind-the-scenes videos, and concept art of the characters and environments, as rewards. Completion of each difficulty level unlocks additional rewards. SynopsisSetting= God of War is set in an alternate version of ancient Greece populated by the Olympian gods, Titans, and other Greek mythological beings. With the exception of flashbacks, the events of the game are set between those of the games Chains of Olympus (2008) and Ghost of Sparta (2010). There are six locations explored, including fictional versions of the real-world Aegean Sea and Athens, and fictional locations of the Desert of Lost Souls, the Temple of Pandora, the Underworld, and a brief scene on Mount Olympus. The Aegean Sea setting includes a mass of shipwrecked vessels. Athens is a war-torn city under assault by Ares, the God of War; beyond the city is the Desert of Lost Souls, a vast and windy desert of ancient ruins. The majority of the game occurs in Pandora's Temple, which is chained to the back of the Titan Cronos, who crawls through the desert. The massive temple, constructed by the architect Pathos Verdes III, is filled with traps and monsters, and has three sections dedicated to the Titan Atlas and gods Poseidon and Hades, respectively. The Underworld is a fiery realm with spiked pillars full of souls and flaming versions of previously encountered enemies. Athens is the scene of the final battle before a denouement on Mount Olympus in the God of War's throne room. =Characters= The protagonist of the game is Kratos (voiced by Terrence C. Carson), a Spartan warrior who serves the Olympian Gods. Other characters include a host of Greek gods, such as Athena (Carole Ruggier), the Goddess of Wisdom and Kratos' ally and mentor; Ares (Steven Blum), the God of War and main antagonist; Poseidon (Fred Tatasciore), the God of the Sea; Aphrodite (Carole Ruggier), the Goddess of Love and Sexuality; Zeus (Paul Eiding), the King of the Gods; Artemis (Claudia Black), the Goddess of the Hunt; and Hades (Nolan North), the God of the Underworld. Several of the gods aid Kratos with magic or weapons. Minor characters include the Oracle of Athens (Susan Blakeslee), the gravedigger (Paul Eiding), the body burner (Christopher Corey Smith), and the boat captain (Keith Ferguson). Other characters appear in flashbacks, including Kratos' wife Lysandra (Gwendoline Yeo), his daughter Calliope, the Barbarian King, and a Village Oracle (Susan Blakeslee). The game is narrated by Linda Hunt. =Plot= Artwork of Ares, the main antagonist. Kratos is a warrior who serves the Greek gods of Olympus. Flashbacks reveal that he was once a successful but bloodthirsty captain in the Spartan army and led his men to several victories before being defeated by a barbarian king. Facing death, Kratos called on the God of War, Ares, whom he promised to serve if the god would spare his men and provide the power to destroy their enemies. Ares agreed and bonded the Blades of Chaos, a pair of chained blades forged in the depths of Tartarus, to his new servant. Kratos, equipped with the blades, then decapitated the barbarian king. Kratos waged war at the behest of Ares, eventually leading an attack on a village occupied by worshipers of Athena. Unknown to Kratos, Ares had secretly transported Kratos' wife and daughter to the village; during his frenzied attack on its temple, Kratos accidentally killed them while he was under a spell cast upon him by Ares. Although Ares believed this act would free Kratos to become the perfect warrior, the horrified and saddened Spartan instead renounced his pledge of servitude to the god, and swore vengeance against him. The oracle of the destroyed village cursed Kratos by bonding the ashes of his dead family to his skin, turning it ash-white and earning him the nickname, \\"Ghost of Sparta\\". Plagued by nightmares of his horrible deed, Kratos vowed to serve the other gods in hope of ridding himself of the visions. When the game starts, Kratos has been serving the gods for ten years. He kills the Hydra on behalf of Poseidon, but he has grown tired of his service and suffering. He summons Athena, who states that if Kratos performs one final act—the murder of Ares—he will be forgiven for killing his family. Ares is waging war on the city of Athens out of hatred and jealousy of his sister Athena, who assigns Kratos to destroy Ares because Zeus has forbidden divine intervention. Athena guides Kratos to the war-torn Athens. After a strange encounter with a gravedigger who encourages him to continue his task, Kratos battles his way to Athens's oracle, finds her, and learns that the only way to defeat Ares is with Pandora's Box, a mythical artifact that grants the power to kill a god. Kratos enters the Desert of Lost Souls, and Athena tells him Pandora's Box is hidden in a temple chained to the back of the Titan Cronos—a punishment by Zeus for Cronos' role in the Great War. Kratos summons Cronos, climbs for three days before reaching the Temple entrance, overcomes an array of deadly traps and an army of monsters, and eventually finds the Box. But Ares, aware of his former servant's success, kills Kratos as he is leaving the Temple by hurling a large pillar into him. While harpies take the Box to Ares, Kratos falls into the Underworld. He battles his way through the fiery realm, and with help from the mysterious gravedigger, who tells him Athena is not the only god watching over him, he escapes and returns to Athens. Kratos recovers Pandora's Box from Ares, opens it, and uses its power to become godlike. Despite Ares' best efforts to destroy Kratos physically and mentally, including stripping him of the Blades of Chaos and all magic, he survives and kills Ares with the Blade of the Gods, a giant sword that was being used as an ornamental bridge to Athens. Athens is saved, and Athena tells Kratos that although his sins are forgiven, the gods cannot erase his nightmares. Forsaken by the gods, he tries to commit suicide by casting himself into the Aegean Sea, but Athena intervenes and transports him to Mount Olympus. As a reward for his services to the gods, she provides Kratos with a new set of blades and the seat as the new God of War. Development Santa Monica began development of God of War in 2002, under the working title Dark Odyssey, and unveiled it two years later at SCEA Santa Monica Gamers' Day 2004. In a meeting with GameSpot at the 2004 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), the developers said there would be 15 to 25 different attacks with the player's main weapon in the final game, with a free-form combo system that would allow players to combine moves in almost any order. GameSpot said the developers described the gameplay \\"as merging the action of Devil May Cry with the puzzle-solving of Ico\\" and noted that players would be able to \\"sunder enemies with a single move, such as by ripping them in half\\". Game Director and creator David Jaffe confirmed the game would be a cinematic presentation. He said that at E3, they got to see where players were having issues with the camera system and said, \\"we are doing extensive focus tests, and using data compiled from E3, to find and fix the problem areas\\" of the cameras. He said he had the confidence that the team would fix the problems before the game's release. However, he said if players \\"hate cinematic camera systems, nothing we can do will help you like the God of War cameras\\". The game uses Santa Monica's Kinetica engine, which they developed for their previous game, Kinetica (2001). Although the game is based on Greek mythology, the development team gave themselves \\"lots of freedom\\" to modify the myths, and Jaffe said they took the \\"coolest aspects of the subject\\" and wrote a story using those elements. In an interview for Eurogamer, he said while the idea for God of War was his own, the concept owed a debt to Capcom because he had played Onimusha and said \\"let's do that with Greek Mythology\\". He was inspired in part by the 1981 feature film, Clash of the Titans, saying, \\"the real high concept for me was ... merging it with Heavy Metal magazine\\". He said he liked both \\"the kids stuff ... with Greek Mythology\\" and the idea of adding more adult themes such as sex and violence. After E3 2004, Jaffe told IGN that the creative team's goal was to \\"make the player feel brutal, letting their inner beast free and just going nuts\\". He said the game's combat system would have an unparalleled degree of freedom. The team designed two systems of combat: a \\"macro\\" system, which gives players the choice between normal combat, magical attacks, or using the QTE feature to kill a foe; and a \\"micro\\" system, where players press a sequence of buttons to perform different attacks. Puzzles were implemented, including self-contained ones that incorporate up to three rooms of the game, and global puzzles that spread across four or five areas. Jaffe compared the game to the popular Prince of Persia series—which also incorporates puzzle and platforming elements—and said that while each puzzle in that series is a slight variation of the last, \\"each puzzle in God of War is its own beast\\". Frank Cifaldi of Gamasutra covered a speech by Jaffe on the development of God of War at the 2006 D.I.C.E. Summit in Las Vegas. Cifaldi said \\"God of War was a rare opportunity for a game designer\\" because Sony gave Jaffe nearly complete creative control to develop a game on his terms with a substantial budget. He stated that Jaffe wanted to make the game \\"out of passion, not fear, and that it would be a game that [Jaffe] himself, as a game player, would want to play\\". Jaffe said the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark also inspired the development of God of War; he wanted to make players feel like he felt as a child watching that film, but did not want to put the player in the role of an adventurer, referencing The Legend of Zelda games. He elaborated that God of War was designed to be simplistic and forward-moving, but the game \\"is not innovative or unique, and that's intentional\\". Jaffe said that their system was shallow and \\"it forced the team to constantly create new content to trapeze the player from one area of interest to the next\\". He said he understood modular game design—the need to have great looking, high-detail levels without having to build and texture every minuscule piece of the environment—but \\"[he] was going to get bored\\" if they did not step outside of those boundaries. Release The demo of God of War, entitled God of War: The Hydra Battle, was released on January 1, 2005. It featured Kratos battling various opponents and ended with a portion of the Hydra battle that opens the main game. The game was released on March 22 in North America, July 8 in the United Kingdom, and November 17 in Japan. By the end of July, it was the sixth-best-selling game of 2005 up to that point. On March 1, 2006, it became available in the PlayStation 2 lineup of Greatest Hits.https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/99302/GT4_God_of_War_Added_To_Sonys_Greatest_Hits.php By July 2006, the game had sold 1 million copies and earned $43 million in the United States alone. Next Generation ranked it as the 50th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. In June 2012, Sony reported that the game sold more than 4.6 million copies worldwide. The game and its sequel, God of War II, were released in North America on November 17, 2009, as part of the God of War Collection, featuring remastered ports of both games for the PlayStation 3 platform, with upscaled graphics and support for PlayStation 3 Trophies. It became available in Japan on March 18, 2010, Australia on April 29, and the UK on April 30. The God of War Collection was released as a digital download on the PlayStation Store on November 2, 2010, and was the first product containing PlayStation 2 software available via download. PlayStation Plus subscribers can download a one-hour trial of each game. By June 2012, God of War Collection had sold more than 2.4 million copies worldwide. A PlayStation Vita version of God of War Collection was released on May 6, 2014. On August 28, 2012, God of War Collection, God of War III, and God of War: Origins Collection were included in the God of War Saga, under Sony's line of PlayStation Collections for the PlayStation 3 in North America. Soundtrack God of War: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game, composed by Gerard K. Marino, Ron Fish, Winifred Phillips, Mike Reagan, Cris Velasco, Winnie Waldron, and Marcello De Francisci, was released on CD by Sony Computer Entertainment as an exclusive product for the Sony Connect Music Store on March 1, 2005. The soundtrack was also made available for free to customers who purchased the game via a voucher code included with the game. Several of the tracks feature voice-over passages from the video game. Dave Valentine of Square Enix Music Online rated it 8 out of 10 and praised the composers for avoiding the production of \\"a neverending dullness of action themes\\". He complimented the soundtrack for having \\"a large number of well-developed orchestral themes, with a noticeable creative use of ancient and ethnic instrumentation\\". Spence D. of IGN gave the soundtrack 6.9 out of 10 and also praised the use of ancient and ethnic instrumentation, but criticized the uneven transitions between tracks. In March 2010, the soundtrack was released as downloadable content as part of the God of War Trilogy Soundtrack in the God of War III Ultimate Edition. Reception God of War received \\"universal acclaim\\" according to review aggregator Metacritic with a score of 94 out of 100, and a score of 94% from GameRankings. Tom Lane of CNN wrote, \\"God of War is the type of game that makes you remember why you play games in the first place.\\" He said it is addictive and the action is balanced with a modest amount of puzzle and platforming elements. He praised how quickly it progresses and said it \\"is one of the most violent [games] on the market\\". Raymond Padilla of GameSpy said the gameplay is \\"excellent\\" and it has \\"some of the goriest, most exaggerated, and over-the-top violence I've ever seen\\". He praised the combo system for being generous, with players easily able to execute attack combinations, but added that it can challenge players who \\"throw themselves into the system\\". Chris Sell of PAL Gaming Network wrote that the most enjoyable aspect of the combat is its simplicity. He said the QTEs are \\"superbly enjoyable\\", \\"highly satisfying\\", and most entertaining during boss fights. In regards to combining combat with platforming, Sell said, \\"God of War pulls it off perfectly.\\" Lane said the story is \\"compelling\\", while Sell stated that it is well laid out and rarely stalls. Padilla wrote, \\"God of War is the best thing to happen to Greek mythology\\" since Harry Hamlin played Perseus in Clash of the Titans. He praised the sound as very strong, but felt that some of the voice acting and music tracks are overstated. Kristan Reed of Eurogamer said the audio is \\"a stunningly evocative example of a well-judged dramatic soundtrack and thunderous effects\\". Sell stated that the graphics are \\"quite possibly the best on the PS2\\" and rival games on the Xbox. He said the character models are \\"excellent\\" and each level has its own distinctive feel. Eric Blattberg of PlayStation Universe praised the graphics for being seamless, realistic, and capable of being able to run at 480p on a widescreen television. He said the textures are \\"great\\", and the environments are \\"stunning and unbelievably detailed.\\" Mikel Reparaz of GamesRadar noted the amount of detail, elaborating that as a consequence of the aging hardware of the PS2, \\"the graphics occasionally stutter or even slow down.\\" He still gave the game a perfect score, concluding, \\"these problems are minor nits next to God of Wars creative design, riveting plot and sheer balls-out fun. One of the best action titles on the PS2, God of War stands out as an ultraviolent masterpiece.\\" Sell said God of War has very few flaws and that the only one worth mentioning is the camera system: he said that although the cameras do a great job of following Kratos, \\"there are a fair few annoying moments when you're attacked by something off-screen, or you fail to make a jump because you couldn't really see the jump properly\\". Other minor complaints from Sell include its lack of replayability, the amount of time it takes to upgrade items, and the final fight with Ares, which he said is \\"a little disappointing\\". Reed wrote that in a few notable occasions, he found some of the platforming balancing acts \\"a little bothersome\\". He said players may be overwhelmed by the number of enemies, but they will eventually get their \\"brain and reactions in gear and move onto the next gripping section and feel hugely satisfied\\". =Awards and accolades= God of War won several \\"Game of the Year\\" awards. At the 2005 Spike Video Game Awards, it was named \\"Best Action Game\\" and David Jaffe won \\"Designer of the Year\\" for the game. It was also a nominee for \\"Game of the Year\\", \\"Best Performance by a Human Male\\" (TC Carson as Kratos), and \\"Best Original Score\\". At the 2006 Interactive Achievement Awards, it won several awards, including \\"Overall Game of the Year\\", \\"Console Game of the Year\\", and \\"Action/Adventure Game of the Year\\". In 2009, IGN named God of War the seventh-best PlayStation 2 game of all time. In November 2012, Complex magazine named God of War the eleventh-best PlayStation 2 game of all time. Other mediaNovel= An official novelization of the game, titled God of War, was announced in July 2009, along with a novelization of God of War II. It was written by Matthew Stover and Robert E. Vardeman, and was published on May 25, 2010, by Del Rey Books. In an interview for Play magazine, Vardeman said a mythology book written in the 1930s got him interested in Greek mythology, and the chance to work on the God of War novel \\"was an opportunity not to be missed\\". He said giving the readers a solid plot foundation was necessary and the novel required extra material so that it did not simply follow the action of the game. Although he has not played the game, he said God of War was based on the traditional Edith Hamilton Greek mythology, essentially \\"the accepted mythology on steroids\\". Vardeman called Kratos a substantial character, continuing, \\"This conflict of motives makes him a great, if troubled, hero.\\" He confirmed his work on the second God of War novel, saying there are many potential story ideas for Kratos and that \\"it would be a shame\\" if there were not additional books to fill in the details of his quests, such as stories of the time while he was a minion of Ares or before he met the Barbarian King. God of War was nominated for the International Association of Tie-in Writers Scribe Award as best adapted novel in 2010. The novel recounts the events of the game and offers deeper insights into its story, explaining that Athena wanted Kratos to kill Ares and explaining how she manipulated the other gods, with the exception of Zeus, into aiding Kratos. After learning of Athena's plans, Zeus decides to aid Kratos (with magic and as the gravedigger) with the intention of Kratos becoming the new God of War after killing Ares. Poseidon is persuaded by Athena when she convinces him that Ares brought the Hydra into his domain. Artemis is persuaded because Ares and his minions are destroying her wilderness and its wildlife, and by aiding Kratos she will prevent future destruction. Athena manipulates Aphrodite into believing that Medusa is plotting against her. Hades, however, is omitted from the book, as Kratos does not meet him or gain his magic. Another omission from the book is Kratos receiving a new set of blades from Athena, and the Blades of Chaos is revealed to have been forged by Hephaestus in Tartarus. The god Hermes is not in the game, but in the novel, he is responsible for informing Athena that Kratos is committing suicide. New characters include Coeus, the First Officer of Kratos' ship, and the two servants of Medusa: Jurr and a blind man. The twins encountered in the sex mini-game are revealed to be the daughters of Aphrodite named Zora and Lora. The book also explains how certain creatures of the mythology that were slain by heroes are, apparently, still alive. For example, Zeus recollects that Hercules slew the Hydra, and Athena confirms this, but informs Zeus that the new Hydra is a newborn spawn of the Titans Typhon and Echidna, and was released by Ares. =Film= A film adaptation was announced in 2005. Jaffe confirmed that a script had been completed by David Self and they were looking for a director. Universal Studios was committed to making the film, but Jaffe, unaware of its status, eventually expressed doubt the film would be released. In September 2008, Brett Ratner told UGO that he would direct the film, but in February 2009, it was revealed that he had left the project to direct 2011's Tower Heist. In March 2010, Santa Monica confirmed that they have no creative control over the film. During the God of War – Game Directors Live documentary, filmed on September 1, 2010, Jaffe said the \\"script went out a year and a half ago to Daniel Craig, who plays [James] Bond, but he turned it down\\". He indicated an actor had since signed on for the role of Kratos, and said, \\"this new person is pretty good, if that ends up true\\". In July 2012, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that two of the writers of Pacific Rim (2013), Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan, had been hired to adapt God of War into a film. Melton and Dunstan told IGN that they were hired to rework Self's screenplay as it was considered to be outdated, being written before recent films in the same genre, such as Clash of the Titans (2010) and its sequel, Wrath of the Titans (2012). They said they wanted to humanize Kratos, who would begin as a mortal and still have his family, with the pivotal change being the barbarian attack. Melton added, \\"We're going to learn about [Kratos] and understand how he operates. So it's potentially 30 minutes ... of building up this character so that, when he ... becomes the Ghost of Sparta, we understand him as a human and ... the journey that he's going to take.\\" According to Dunstan, \\"with a bigger movie like God of War, you have to go quite a bit deeper into the character as opposed to a horror film\\". Melton and Dunstan also said they had \\"big plans\\" for Ares, who they wanted \\"to build up a bit more ... so that he can become a true villain\\" beyond his raid of Athens. In November 2012, the writers told GameSpot that God of War would \\"improve on films like Clash of the Titans and Immortals by taking a step in a bolder direction.\\" Melton said that Sony \\"encouraged\\" them to make it different from other films in the same genre. It was also confirmed that Charles Roven and Alex Gartner, the producers of the Uncharted film, would be producing the God of War film via Atlas Entertainment. In early 2013, God of War: Ascensions Game Director, Todd Papy, said he did not know the status of the film. The main writer behind the God of War video games (2005–2013), Marianne Krawczyk, said her main worry with the movie adaptation was casting Kratos: \\"The player has a personal experience with him, and then he's going to be embodied by a different actor, he's going to have a different voice, he's going to say a lot more words. So I think it will be hard to get that across,\\" but she was hopeful that it could be done. As of , , the film is without a director, no actors have been confirmed, a release date has not been set, but the script has been \\"turned in\\", and the film has a budget of $150 million USD. Since March 26, 2013, there have been no further updates about this adaptation, but following the release of 2018's God of War, rumors about a potential adaptation of that game began circulating. Pacific Rim: Uprisings (2018) director Steven S. DeKnight stated he would like to direct an adaptation of that game and talked with Sony about making it R-rated. As a big fan of the series, DeKnight said he wants to see the franchise adapted and wants Dave Bautista for the role of Kratos.

It served during operations in South Carolina in the Department of the South, and later in Benjamin Butler's Army of the James, during the Bermuda Hundred and Petersburg Campaigns.Union Army 1st Division Badge, X Corps History The corps was officially created on September 13, 1862, to consist of the majority of Union troops operating in South Carolina and eastern Georgia. (Other troops in Florida were officially under its command but were not effectively.) The corps was initially commanded by Ormsby M. Mitchel, who died in October 1862. He was succeeded by John Milton Brannan, David Hunter, Quincy Adams Gillmore, David B. Birney and Alfred H. Terry. The corps took part in most of the operations against Charleston from 1862-63, including attacks on James Island and Morris Island and the Battle of Fort Wagner. Other elements of the corps based in Florida took part in the disastrous Battle of Olustee. In early 1864, the corps, now commanded by Gillmore, was transferred to the Army of the James. It took part in the Bermuda Hundred operations and played a principal role in the disastrous Drewry's Bluff action. It also took part in the attack on Cold Harbor in conjunction with units of the Army of the Potomac, and the corps played a major role in the early stages of the Petersburg Campaign. In December 1864, the corps was disbanded; its white contingent went to the new XXIV Corps, while its black units went to the XXV Corps. A detachment of former X Corps troops took part in the successful attack on Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in early 1865. The X Corps was \\"revived\\", under the command of Alfred Terry, in March 1865. It was attached to the Department of North Carolina under Schofield and was part of Sherman's Army after Bentonville. After Johnston's surrender, it served primarily on garrison duty in South Carolina and Georgia until it was discontinued in August 1865.

It was produced by Max Fleischer for Fleischer Studios, Inc. and directed by Dave Fleischer. Willard Bowsky was head animator, with musical supervision by Sammy Timberg. The voice of Popeye is performed by Jack Mercer, with additional voices by Mae Questel as Olive Oyl, Lou Fleischer as J. Wellington Wimpy and Gus Wickie as Abu Hassan. Popeye is enlisted in the United States Coast Guard and did not enlist in the Navy until 1941 in the Fleischer short The Mighty Navy and other related cartoons due to World War II (Popeye would remain in his Navy uniform until 1978 with the exception of retaining the Navy \\"Dixie Cup\\" cap).Popeye the Sailor Man was originally Popeye the Coast Guardsman Plot While on guard at a Coast Guard post, Popeye, Olive Oyl and J. Wellington Wimpy hear of Abu Hassan's attack on a town in Arabia and fly there in their flying boat to capture him, but they crash as they are flying over a desert in Arabia. After trekking through the desert, the group happens upon the town where the Forty Thieves attack. The Thieves abduct Olive and Wimpy, and Abu Hassan leaves Popeye hanging from a chandelier after failing to win a battle of one-ups-manship with him (during which, demonstrating a magic trick, Popeye relieves Hassan of his long underwear, remarking \\"Abu hasn't got 'em any more!\\"). Popeye manages to break free and takes a camel to Abu's secret cave, where, unable to remember the magic word of \\"open sesame!\\", he breaks in using his pipe as a blowtorch. left Inside the cave, Popeye sneaks past the guards and attempts to free Olive and Wimpy. He confronts Abu Hassan and demands that he gives the Forty Thieves' stolen jewels back to the people. However, he is apprehended and thrown into a shark pit. Just before being eaten by a shark, Popeye tangles the shark's teeth together, and the shark goes back down into the water. Popeye eats his spinach and defeats Abu Hassan, and all forty of the Thieves (counting every single one as he does so). The Thieves and Hassan are chained and made to drag a cart filled with the stolen loot, Popeye, Olive, and Wimpy, back to town, where the townspeople, jubilant at their liberation from Hassan's reign of terror, await them with open arms. As Popeye puts it, \\"I may be a shorty, but I licked the Forty! I'm Popeye the Sailor Man!\\" Release and reception Popeye the Sailor Meets Ali Baba's Forty Thieves was produced while Fleischer competitor Walt Disney was entering the final months of production on his first animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. It made full use of Fleischer Studios's multiplane camera, which they had been experimenting with for some time. Disney had just released his Academy Award winning Silly Symphony, The Old Mill, their first 3-D cartoon, and were advertising their upcoming Snow White as multiplanal as well. As such, advertising for \\"Forty Thieves\\" accented the fact that it was 3-dimensional. It was released just weeks before the seasonal Los Angeles premiere of Snow White and was essentially the only animated competition for the feature. The short was the second of the three Popeye \\"Color Specials,\\" which were over sixteen minutes each, three times as long as a regular Popeye cartoon, and were often billed in theatres alongside or above the main feature. Today, this short and the other two Popeye Color Specials, Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor, and Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp (both of which were also adapted from a story featured in One Thousand and One Nights), are in the public domain. Poor quality transfers of these three cartoons made from old, faded prints have been released on several previous Popeye collections on VHS tape and DVD. The cartoon, fully restored with the original Paramount mountain logo opening and closing titles, is available officially on disc four of the DVD collection Popeye the Sailor: 1933-1938, Volume 1.

It was one of the earliest corps formations in the Western Theater of the American Civil War. Corps historyCreation= On October 24, 1862, the War Department issued General Orders No. 168, creating both the XIII Corps and the XIV Corps. The XIV Corps was to be organized from troops of the Army of the Cumberland, and to be commanded by General William Rosecrans.\\"General Orders No. 168,\\" Ohio Civil War Central, 2014, Ohio Civil War Central. 8 Jun 2014 <> The Army of the Ohio, under the command of Don Carlos Buell was previously divided into three unofficial corps designated I, II and III Corps. When Rosecrans took command the army was reorganized into twelve divisions to be made from 155 regiments of infantry, a regiment of engineers, 35 batteries of artillery, and six regiments of cavalry. =Stones River= The Army of the Cumberland and XIV Corps were virtually synonymous and therefore command of the corps was divided into three \\"wings\\" with the same basic formation as in the former Army of the Ohio. The old I Corps became the Right Wing under Alexander M. McCook. The II Corps became the Left Wing under Thomas L. Crittenden. The III Corps became the Center Wing under George H. Thomas, replacing Charles C. Gilbert. In this formation the corps fought at the Battle of Stones River losing over 25% in killed, wounded or missing. = Battle of Chickamauga = On January 9, 1863, in the immediate aftermath of Stones River, the XIV Corps wings were given their own official corps designations. McCook's Right Wing became the XX Corps. Crittenden's Left Wing became the XXI Corps. Thomas' Center Wing remained as the XIV Corps. Thomas led the corps to distinction for his defense at Horseshoe Ridge (in particular his actions at Snodgrass Hill) protecting the Federal Army from a complete rout following the Battle of Chickamauga. = Battle of Chattanooga = Following Chickamauga, Thomas was given command of the Army of the Cumberland and John M. Palmer led the corps at the Battle of Missionary Ridge and during the most of the Atlanta Campaign. = March towards Atlanta = Battle of Utoy Creek the XIV Army Corps was placed under the command of the Army of the Ohio MG Schofield 1 August 1864 and the two corps were assigned by Sherman to break the Railroad lines at East Point. The ensuing Battle of Utoy Creek initial assault by Johnson's 1st Division on 5 August and supporting attack on 6 August 1864 came close to success. Due to a disagreement of the date of rank between MG Palmer and MG Schofield after the battle which Schofield unsuccessfully commanded. Richard W. Johnson briefly commanded the corps after Palmer's resignation during the siege of Atlanta 1864. Jefferson C. Davis took command of the corps and led it during the Battle of Jonesboro. = Savannah Campaign = Following the fall of Atlanta, the XIV Corps was detached from the Army of the Cumberland and assigned to what became the Army of Georgia. Davis remained in command of the corps and fought at the Battle of Bentonville in 1865. = March through the Carolinas =Corps badge origin This corps's distinctive badge was in the shape of that of an acorn.

It served in the Army of the Tennessee under Maj. Gens. Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman. It was commanded by Sherman in the Siege of Vicksburg and then by Maj. Gen. John A. Logan in Sherman's Atlanta Campaign. Brig. Gen. Peter J. Osterhaus commanded the corps in the March to the Sea, but Logan was back in command during Sherman's Carolina Campaign. When General Howard became head of the Freedman's Bureau, Logan became the commander of the Army of the Tennessee for the final march to Washington. William Hazen became the XV Corps final commander. The XV Corps' badge was a shield with a cartridge box in the middle with the Corps motto \\"40 Rounds.\\" The badge and motto originated from the Western XV Corps' rivalry with the eastern XII Corps. When the Western and Eastern soldiers finally met up near Chattanooga in late 1863, the XI and XII Corps soldiers bragged about their crescent and star-shaped corps badges. When asked what badge the XV Corps had (The XV Corps did not have one yet at the time), an Irish soldier of the XV Corps said, \\"Moon and stars is it? Sure it was the light of both ye needed to find your way home from Chancellorsville!\\" (The XI Corps had been routed at that battle) whereupon he slapped his cartridge box and said, \\"Corps badge? This is the badge of the Fifteenth Corps; 40 rounds!\\" This saying eventually reached the ears of General Logan. He soon sent out the following circular to his men: An alternate retelling of the tale behind the unique corps-badge, as given by Sherman in his Memoirs: The Fifteenth Corps is highlighted near the end of Chapter III of MacKinlay Kantor's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \\"Andersonville\\" (1955).

The corps rarely fought as one unified unit, as its divisions were often scattered across the country. HistoryCreation and Vicksburg= The XVI Corps was organized on December 18, 1862 with Maj. Gen. Stephen A. Hurlbut in command. It had four divisions commanded respectively by William Sooy Smith (1st Division), Grenville Dodge (2nd Division), Nathan Kimball (3rd Division) and Jacob G. Lauman (4th Division). These divisions were assigned to garrison duty in the vicinity of Memphis, Tennessee, LaGrange, Tennessee and Corinth, Mississippi. With the Army of the Tennessee besieging Vicksburg, Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant gathered reinforcements from the surrounding areas. The divisions of Smith, Kimball and Lauman were ordered to Vicksburg on June 12. This detachment was led by Maj. Gen. Cadwallader C. Washburn. Hurlbut and Dodge remained on garrison duty in Tennessee during this time. After the fall of Vicksburg, Smith's division was attached to the IX Corps and Lauman's division was attached to the XIII Corps during Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's expedition to Jackson, Mississippi. In 1864, the corps was divided into two wings of two divisions each. Left Wing The Left Wing was led by Maj. Gen. Grenville Dodge and participated in Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's Atlanta Campaign. The left wing was composed of the divisions of Brig. Gen. Thomas W. Sweeny (2nd Division) and Brig. Gen. James C. Veatch (4th Division). These divisions fought notably at the Battle of Atlanta on July 22, 1864 holding off Confederate General John Bell Hood's flank attack. At this battle Veatch's division was led by Brig. Gen. John W. Fuller. Right Wing The remaining division which did not join Sherman's Atlanta Campaign were left to guard the Mississippi River valley. Kimball's, Lauman's and William Sooy Smith's divisions were permanently removed to other corps while James Tuttle's division of the XV Corps and Andrew Jackson Smith's division of the XIII Corps were both transferred to the XVI Corps. Maj. Gen. Hurlbut assumed direct command over these divisions known as the Right Wing and participated in the Meridian Expedition in February 1864. During the Red River Campaign the Right Wing was attached to Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks' Army of the Gulf with Andrew J. Smith in command. Tuttle's 1st Division was now commanded by Joseph A. Mower and A.J. Smith's division was also attached to Mower's command. One division from the XVII Corps was attached to the Right Wing. This division was dubbed the \\"Red River Division\\" and was commanded by Thomas Kilby Smith. The Red River Division remained in Louisiana while A.J. Smith took the rest of the Right Wing into Mississippi to protect Sherman's supply lines during the Atlanta Campaign, defeating the Confederates at the Battle of Tupelo. Here the two divisions were commanded by Mower (1st Division) and Colonel David Moore (2nd Division) with a division of cavalry temporarily attached under Brig. Gen. Benjamin Grierson. This unit was sometimes called \\"General A.J. Smith's Guerrillas\\". =Dissolution= The corps in its entirety was discontinued on November 7, 1864. Andrew J. Smith remained in command of his two divisions and were sent to Missouri to help defeat Sterling Prices's Missouri Raid. During this time Smith's command, once known as the Right Wing-XVI Corps, was now officially titled \\"Detachment-Army of the Tennessee\\". Smith was then sent to Tennessee to join with Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas for the battle of Nashville. At Nashville Smith had three divisions being commanded respectively by John McArthur, Kenner Garrard and Col. Jonathan B. Moore. McArthur's division took a prominent part in both days of the battle. =Re-activation= On February 18, 1865 Smith's Detachment-Army of the Tennessee became the official XVI Corps. It was composed of three divisions: First (McArthur), Second (Garrard) and Third (Carr). The composition remained virtually the same as it had at Nashville except Brig. Gen. Eugene A. Carr replaced Col. Moore in command of the 3rd Division. It served in the operations of Maj. Gen. Edward Canby against Mobile, Alabama and fought in the battles of Spanish Fort and Fort Blakely. The latter ended on April 9, 1865, the day Lee surrendered at Appomattox. The corps was finally disbanded on July 20, 1865.

Origins and makeup  The XVIII Corps was created on December 24, 1862. It was initially composed of five divisions stationed in North Carolina, making it one of the largest in the Union Army (though two were detached to join the X Corps in early 1863), and placed under the command of General John G. Foster. By August 1863, most of the corps' original units were either disbanded or transferred elsewhere, but Brig. Gen. George W. Getty's division (formerly of IX Corps) and the bulk of the recently discontinued VII Corps from Virginia were redesignated the XVIII Corps.  Operations  During the spring of 1864, the corps--now commanded by General William Farrar Smith, formerly of VI Corps--was transferred to Yorktown, Virginia, to join Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler's Army of the James. The corps played a major part in the unsuccessful operations in the Bermuda Hundred, and was also heavily engaged at Cold Harbor. On June 12, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant sent Smith on a surprise march to seize Petersburg from the Confederate forces before Robert E. Lee could bring up the bulk of the Army of Northern Virginia. In the Second Battle of Petersburg, June 15-18, 1864, Smith made successful initial attacks against the outnumbered defenses of Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard; but after driving Beauregard's men from their outer entrenchments on the 15th, Smith, fearful of a Confederate counterattack, lost his nerve and did not press the attack when it could have resulted in the easy seizure of the city.  Commanders  Smith was relieved of command in July due to ill health, and he was replaced by Edward O.C. Ord and later Godfrey Weitzel. Charles A. Heckman briefly commanded the corps following the wounding of General Ord during the Battle of Chaffin's Farm. John Gibbon was temporary commander of the corps in the month of September 1864. The corps occupied the line of entrenchments closest to the main Confederate line, and suffered heavy casualties in almost daily skirmishing for a month. The corps was relieved of its position by X Corps on August 26, and the corps was sent first to the Bermuda Hundred, and later to the north bank of the James River. Its first division took part in the successful attack on Fort Harrison on August 29 during the Battle of Chaffin's Farm. The corps was also engaged on October 27 in the Second Battle of Fair Oaks, fought over the same ground as the first battle in May 1862. The corps was ultimately discontinued in December 1864; as with X Corps, its white units went to join the new XXIV Corps, while its black units joined XXV Corps.

Nelson became interested in biofuels in 2004 after his wife bought a diesel car, which she fueled only with biodiesel. They were impressed by the efficiency and performance of the biofuels and their potential to end the dependence of the United States on foreign oil sources, as well as to provide the family farmers with work to produce it. The same year, he and his wife became partners with Bob and Kelly King in the building of two Biodiesel plants, one in Salem, Oregon and the other at Carl's Corner, Texas. Due to the high requirements of the brand, the availability of the fuel declined. In 2012, Nelson and Pacific Biodisel reached an agreement for the production of the fuel. Starting during Nelson's birthday, on April 30, the company made available a retail pump containing BioWillie in Maui. History Willie Nelson Biodiesel produces a biodiesel fuel called BioWillie made of soybean and other vegetable oils that can be used in modern diesel engines instead of regular fuel without vehicle modifications. Nelson became interested in the use of biofuels when his wife, Annie, purchased a diesel car in 2004. She only filled the car with biodiesel. Impressed by the performance of the fuels, and by the potential independence from foreign oil that could provide. The same year, he and his wife became partners with Bob and Kelly King in the building of two biodiesel plants, the SeQuential-Pacific facility in Salem, Oregon and the other at Carl's Corner, Texas (the Texas plant was founded by Carl Cornelius, a longtime Nelson friend and the namesake for Carl's Corner). In 2005, Nelson and several other business partners formed Willie Nelson Biodiesel branded as \\"BioWillie\\". (\\"Bio-Willie\\"), a company that is marketing biodiesel biofuel to truck stops. The fuel is made from vegetable oil (mainly soybean oil), and can be burned without modification in diesel engines. Nelson stated: \\"There is really no need going around starting wars over oil. We have it here at home. We have the necessary product, the farmers can grow it.\\"Anne Schroeder. \\"NAMES & FACES.\\" Washington Post 15 Jan 2005. Distribution Earth Biodiesel Inc., a publicly traded company (OTCBB: EBOF), is the exclusive distributor of BioWillie. In 2006, Willie Nelson reported the ownership of 6,537,500 shares of Earth Biodiesel Inc. to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In 2007, Nelson published On the Clean Road Again: Biodiesel and the Future of the Family Farm. The book described the benefits of the use of biofuels, its performance, the possibility of the independence of foreign oil and the opportunity of production by family farmers. The use of the BioWillie later declined due to the restrictions of the brand, that specifies that the fuel must meet or exceed standards established by the American Society of Testing and Materials. Meanwhile, the fuel also has to meet the conditions of the Sustainable Biodiesel Alliance. The BioWillie can only be produced in the United States, with local sources and used in the country.

The corps took part in a skirmish with Bragg's rearguard at Liberty Gap, Tennessee, during the Tullahoma Campaign in June 1863. It fought its only major battle under this designation at Chickamauga, where it suffered horrendous casualties in the two days of fighting. The corps took heavy casualties, and it (along with Thomas L. Crittenden's XXI Corps), became consolidated into the new IV Corps. McCook, blamed in large part for the failure at Chickamauga, was relieved of command. =Command history= *Alexander M. McCook, January 9, 1863 – October 9, 1863 { - valign=top General McCook with the staff at Chickamauga under the Corps banner General McCook's headquarters at Stevenson, Alabama } Hooker's corps After the Battle of Gettysburg, with the armies of the east engaged in stalemate (and a large portion of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, under James Longstreet, was serving with Braxton Bragg in Tennessee), Washington dispatched Joseph Hooker, discredited after his defeat at the Battle of Chancellorsville the previous May, with the XI and XII Corps of the Army of the Potomac to try to relieve Bragg's siege of Chattanooga. The command played a decisive role in the Battle of Wauhatchie, which opened up the \\"Cracker Line\\" to the besieged Union army, and seized Lookout Mountain in the famed \\"Battle Above The Clouds\\" during the early stages of the Battle of Chattanooga. On April 4, 1864, just before the onset of the Atlanta Campaign, William T. Sherman, authorized the consolidation of XI and XII Corps as XX Corps, under Hooker's command, to serve in the Army of the Cumberland. Units from XI and XII Corps were combined in each division. The corps fought valiantly throughout the Atlanta Campaign. After James B. McPherson was killed in the Battle of Atlanta on July 22, Oliver O. Howard was made commander of the Army of the Tennessee. Hooker, partially because Howard was junior to him and partially because he blamed Howard (who had commanded XI Corps at the Battle of Chancellorsville, where it had been routed during Stonewall Jackson's famed flank march) for his part in the defeat of the Army of the Potomac, resigned. He was replaced first by Alpheus S. Williams, and then Henry W. Slocum, both former XII Corps commanders. Its troops were the first to enter Atlanta after its surrender on September 1, and later went with Sherman's Army of Georgia during his March to the Sea. Williams commanded it from then until the Carolinas Campaign (Slocum having been promoted to army command in the meantime). It played a major part in the seizure of Savannah in December and was actively engaged throughout the Carolinas Campaign, particularly at Bentonville, where it absorbed the main blow of Joseph E. Johnston's counterattack. Because fighting at Bentonville had not destroyed Johnston's army, Sherman replaced Williams with the more aggressive Joseph A. Mower. It took part in the Grand Review and was disbanded in June 1865. =Command history= *Joseph Hooker, April 14, 1864 – July 28, 1864 *Alpheus S. Williams, July 28, 1864 – August 27, 1864 *Henry W.

It served as part of William S. Rosecrans's Army of the Cumberland and was in existence from January 9th to October 1863. After the Battle of Stone's River, General Rosecrans reorganized the \\"wings\\" of his army into three corps. The left wing, under Thomas L. Crittenden, became the XXI Corps. Taking part in the Tullahoma Campaign, the XXI Corps was heavily engaged at Chickamauga on September 19-20, 1863, where it was nearly destroyed. It was Rosecrans' mistaken decision to pull Thomas Wood's division of this corps to support George Thomas's XIV Corps that resulted in General James Longstreet's breakthrough against the Union center.

As the seat of the Municipality of Alajuela canton, it is awarded the status of city. In virtue of being the city of the first canton of the province, it is also the capital of the Province of Alajuela. Because of its location in the Costa Rican Central Valley, Alajuela is nowadays part of the conurbation of the Greater Metropolitan Area. The city is the birthplace of Juan Santamaría, the national hero of Costa Rica and the figure who gives the name to the country's main international airport, which is south of Alajuela downtown.  Geography  Alajuela has an area of km² and an elevation of metres. It is located in the Central Valley, 19 kilometres northwest of San José. Climate The climate is tropical, typical of the Central Valley, but slightly warmer than San José. Temperatures are moderate, averaging 23–26 degrees Celsius with a low humidity level of 20% almost all year round. Alajuela and its surroundings are famed for having \\"the best weather in the world\\".Alajuela, Climate and info, in Costa Rica WeatherCentre  Demographics  For the 2011 census, Alajuela had a population of inhabitants. History El Llano old hermitage In pre-Columbian times the land where the canton of Alajuela is today was part of the Western Huetar Kingdom, which was inhabited by native tribes, who at the time of the Spanish conquest were led by Chief Garabito. The first Spanish settlers established settlements in the region in about 1650.Ocampo Barrantes, Marlon. \\"Los Orígenes de la Población de Alajuela, 1601-1782\\". Editorial UNED, Costa Rica, 2009. In a letter of obligation granted in 1864, the place is mentioned as La Lajuela in the Valley of Barva, near the Canoas river. In 1777, the dwellers of La Lajuela and Ciruelas, having been served with notice to move to Villa Vieja (today's Heredia), requested the provisional construction of a public place of prayer in the house of Don Dionysius Oconitrillo, of Spanish origin, 30 metres north of where Alajuela's cathedral is today. After increases of population in the five existing quarters then: Targuaz, Puás, Ciruelas, La Lajuela and Rio Grande, the citizens faced difficulties to maintain their religious obligations, so they requested permission to establish a parish and a public place of prayer from the Bishop of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, Monsignor don Esteban Lorenzo de Tristán. According to a motion issued in the Spanish Parliament of Cádiz on 19 May 1812, the first town hall of Alajuela was founded in 1813. On December 18 of the same year, the La Lajuela quarter obtained the title of town and it was renamed. It was first called \\"Villa Hermosa\\", then it was called \\"San Juan Nepomuceno de Alajuela\\" and finally the title of city was granted on 20 November 1824 and with it the name \\"Alajuela\\" which remains today. Participation in important historical events by citizens of Alajuela has ensured the city's reputation as a storied place in Costa Rican history. The national hero Juan Santamaría, who died during the campaign in 1856 to remove invaders threatening Costa Rica's sovereignty, was born in Alajuela. This historical event is celebrated and remembered every year on 11 April and it is a national holiday. The area often experiences earthquakes. The 2009 magnitude 6.1 earthquake caused several landslides. Economy The main exports of the region are coffee, sugar-cane, maize, beans, tobacco, citrus fruits, strawberries, tubers like cassava, flowers and ornamental plants. Other commercial activities include poultry farming, beekeeping, pig farming and the dairy industry. More recently, Alajuela has seen important investment in free zone parks and heavy industry companies. Transportation Alajuela is an important transport hub for the country, connecting the capital city of San José with northwestern Costa Rica. As a part of the Greater Metropolitan Area, most of the inhabitants of Alajuela work in other cities or regions of the Central Valley, and every day receives residents from other locations to work in local factories. Central America's second busiest airport, Juan Santamaría International Airport, is three kilometers south of the district center. = Road transportation = The district is covered by the following road routes: *25px National Route 3 *25px National Route 123 *25px National Route 124 *25px National Route 125 *25px National Route 130 *25px National Route 153 = Rail transportation = The Interurbano Line operated by Incofer goes through this district.

The Union Army of the James was formed in April 1864 under the command of Major General Benjamin Butler for the purpose of taking Richmond, Virginia and Petersburg, Virginia while the Union Army of the Potomac along with the separate IX Corps under the direction of Union General-in-chief Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant and the tactical command of Major General George Meade engaged Confederate General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia in the Overland Campaign. In April 1864, the Army of the James was composed of the X Corps, the XVIII Corps and a cavalry division under the command of Brigadier General August V. Kautz. Butler failed to achieve his objectives in the Bermuda Hundred Campaign when his forces were stopped by a small Confederate force led by General P.G.T. Beauregard.Heidler, David S. and Jeanne T.

The black troops were sent to the XXV Corps; the white troops became the XXIV Corps, under the command of Edward O. Ord. The bulk of corps remained in the Petersburg trenches, but Adelbert Ames's second division took part in both Major General Butler's initial unsuccessful assault on Fort Fisher during the First Battle of Fort Fisher in December 1864 and the successful attack on the fort during the Second Battle of Fort Fisher the following January. This division was ultimately absorbed into the revived X Corps in March 1865. The remainder of the corps served in the Petersburg Campaign. When Ord assumed command of the Army of the James from Butler on January 1, 1865, John Gibbon took command of the corps and led it ably. The corps took part in the defeat of Lee at Hatcher's Run in February and were involved in the assaults of Fort Gregg and Fort Whitworth during the fall of Petersburg on April 2 The corps was engaged during the skirmish at Appomattox that occurred just prior to Lee's surrender. During the Appomattox campaign, an Independent Division of troops that had served in the Shenandoah Valley was added to the first and third divisions. The corps remained in Virginia until August, when it was disbanded.  Notes  References  * Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands.

Overview These are the season and episode counts for all seasons and series released so far, ordered by the date that they were initially released. Cast The dramas feature both former actors who portrayed the Doctor and his companions, and new continuing characters as well as elements from other spin-off media. The canonicity of the audio dramas, as with other Doctor Who spin-off media, is unclear. To date, productions have featured the Fourth (Tom Baker), Fifth (Peter Davison), Sixth (Colin Baker), Seventh (Sylvester McCoy), Eighth (Paul McGann), War (Sir John Hurt) and Tenth (David Tennant) Doctors portrayed by their original actors. The Return of the Ninth Doctor as portrayed by Christopher Eccleston was announced in 2020. Big Finish's current licence from the BBC allows it to produce audio dramas featuring the first twelve incarnations of the Doctor and associated characters introduced into the series between 1963 and 2017. However, it does not allow the use of the current Thirteenth Doctor (Jodie Whittaker), or any characters which originate from her era. Nearly all of the companions from the original series have appeared, voiced by their original actors. They include Susan (Carole Ann Ford), Ian Chesterton (William Russell), Vicki (Maureen O'Brien), Steven Taylor (Peter Purves), Sara Kingdom (Jean Marsh), Polly (Anneke Wills), Jamie McCrimmon (Frazer Hines), Victoria Waterfield (Deborah Watling), Zoe Heriot (Wendy Padbury), Jo Grant (Katy Manning), Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney), Sergeant Benton (John Levene), Mike Yates (Richard Franklin), Leela (Louise Jameson), K9 (John Leeson), Romana I (Mary Tamm), Romana II (Lalla Ward), Adric (Matthew Waterhouse), Nyssa (Sarah Sutton), Tegan Jovanka (Janet Fielding), Vislor Turlough (Mark Strickson), Peri Brown (Nicola Bryant), Melanie Bush (Bonnie Langford) and Ace (Sophie Aldred). Adventures featuring revival series companions Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) and Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) have also been released. Several actors who played the Doctor and companions of previous Doctors have appeared in other roles, including Russell, O'Brien, Marsh, Wills, Watling, Padbury, Caroline John, Manning, Elisabeth Sladen, Leeson, Daphne Ashbrook, Tennant and Bernard Cribbins. Sladen also reprised Sarah Jane Smith in a spin-off series simply entitled Sarah Jane Smith. Sladen never appeared as Sarah alongside any incarnation of the Doctor for Big Finish; a series with Tom Baker was planned, but was never recorded due to Sladen's untimely death in April 2011. Initially Matthew Waterhouse declined to reprise the role of Adric so the character was recast and played by Andrew Sachs as an older version of the character. Waterhouse later returned to the role on an ongoing basis. Big Finish also started The Companion Chronicles series of plays, featuring a companion or friend of the Doctor and a supporting cast member. Ford, Russell, O'Brien, Purves, Marsh, Wills, Hines, Watling, Padbury, Manning, Jameson, Tamm, Ward, Sutton, Strickson and Aldred have all reprised their roles in this series along with John (Liz). As well as this, Big Finish started the Doctor Who: The Early Adventures series of full-cast plays, featuring the First Doctor (recast by William Russell and Peter Purves, following William Hartnell's death in 1975) and the Second Doctor (recast by Frazer Hines, following Patrick Troughton's death in 1987), and companions Barbara Wright (recast by Maureen O'Brien and Jemma Powell, following Jacqueline Hill's death in 1993) and Ben Jackson (recast by Elliot Chapman, following Michael Craze's death in 1998), and Russell, Ford, O'Brien, Purves, Marsh, Wills, Hines, Watling and Padbury reprising their roles from the original series. They also started The Third Doctor Adventures series of full-cast plays, featuring Tim Treloar recast as the Third Doctor (following Jon Pertwee's death in 1996), Manning as Jo, and Franklin as Yates. Big Finish released The Ninth Doctor Chronicles, a series of plays narrated by Nicholas Briggs and featuring Camille Coduri returning as Jackie Tyler and Bruno Langley returning as the Ninth Doctor's companion Adam Mitchell. New companions created for the audio series include Evelyn Smythe (Maggie Stables), Charley Pollard (India Fisher), Erimem (Caroline Morris), Hex Schofield (Philip Olivier), C'rizz (Conrad Westmaas), Lucie Miller (Sheridan Smith), Thomas Brewster (John Pickard), Abby (Ciara Janson), Tamsin Drew (Niky Wardley), Elizabeth Klein (Tracey Childs), Flip Jackson (Lisa Greenwood), Molly O'Sullivan (Ruth Bradley), Liv Chenka (Nicola Walker), Helen Sinclair (Hattie Morahan) and Constance Clarke (Miranda Raison). Lisa Bowerman has appeared as Bernice Summerfield, a companion from the Virgin New Adventures, in several Doctor Who audio dramas as well as in original productions with her as the central character. Robert Jezek and Jemima Rooper have appeared as Frobisher and Izzy Sinclair, companions from the Doctor Who Magazine comic strip, Travis Oliver and Yasmin Bannerman have portrayed companions Roz Forrester and Chris Cwej from the Virgin New Adventures, and Matt Di Angelo has played Fitz Kreiner, a companion from the BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures. Charley, C'rizz, Lucie, Tamsin and Molly were all referenced by name in the mini-episode \\"The Night of the Doctor\\". Broadcast In 2005, six of the audio dramas featuring Paul McGann as the Eighth Doctor were broadcast on the digital radio station BBC 7: Storm Warning, Sword of Orion, The Stones of Venice, Invaders from Mars, Shada (originally created for webcast on the BBC's online service), and The Chimes of Midnight. These plays were rebroadcast on BBC7 beginning in July 2006. The Chimes of Midnight was repeated again as part of \\"The New Eighth Doctor Adventures\\" Series 1 & 2 in 2009. In January 2007, a new series of Eighth Doctor audio adventures was broadcast on BBC7. These starred McGann alongside Sheridan Smith as the aforementioned new companion Lucie Miller. There were eight 50-minute episodes in total; the first and last stories were two-parters, and the rest were single episodes. These adventures have since been released on CD. In 2008, BBC7 broadcast the second series of The New Eighth Doctor Adventures (which Big Finish had already released on CD) bar the final two-part story. All fourteen episodes were then repeated in 2009, and the final two-part story later that year. Big Finish has gone on to produce two further series of these Adventures, and four selected stories from the third series were aired in 2010, with BBC Radio 4 Extra (as Radio 7 became) skipping ahead to the fourth series in early 2013. In May/June 2011, BBC Radio 4 Extra broadcast the Fifth Doctor stories Cobwebs, The Whispering Forest, and Cradle of the Snake. In May/June 2012, these were followed by the Seventh Doctor stories A Thousand Tiny Wings, Survival of the Fittest, Klein's Story and The Architects of History. For the fiftieth anniversary of the show, BBC Radio 4 Extra repeated several stories and broadcast two new stories; Protect and Survive starring Sylvester McCoy and 1963: Fanfare for the Common Men starring Peter Davison. In May 2015, BBC Radio 4 Extra broadcast the first series of Fourth Doctor Adventures starring Tom Baker and Louise Jameson. In 2016, the station broadcast a run of Sixth Doctor adventures: The Crimes of Thomas Brewster (28 May – 4 June), Industrial Evolution (11 – 18 June) and The Curse of Davros (25 June – 2 July).

It was produced by Max Fleischer, and directed by Dave Fleischer for Fleischer Studios, Inc., with David Tendlar serving as head animator, and music being supervised by Sammy Timberg. The voice of Popeye is performed by Jack Mercer, with additional voices by Margie Hines as Olive Oyl and Carl Meyer as the evil Wazzir. Plot This short features Olive as a screenwriter for Surprise Pictures (\\"if it's a good picture, it's a Surprise\\" – the same joke idea had been used in 1938's Daffy Duck in Hollywood), working on a treatment of the story of Aladdin that will feature herself as the beautiful princess and Popeye as Aladdin, all the while speaking in rhyme. As she types, her adaptation of Aladdin comes to life on the screen, with Popeye having to use his wits against an evil vizier who seeks to control a magic lamp inhabited by a powerful genie. After completing the script, Olive gets a termination of employment notice from the front office, which reads \\"Your story of Aladdin is being thrown out...and so are you! [signed] Surprise.\\" As in many Popeye cartoons, many of the gags are conveyed using dialogue. As Princess Olive awaits Popeye/Aladdin's declaration of his love, he turns to the camera and remarks \\"I don't know what to say...I've never made love in Technicolor before!\\" During the climatic battle between Aladdin and the vizier, Olive screams out \\"Help! Popeye—I mean Aladdin—save me!!\\" Release and reception This short was the last of the three Popeye Color Specials, which were, at over sixteen minutes each, three times as long as a regular Popeye cartoon, and were often billed in theaters alongside or above the main feature. Unlike the first two films, Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp is more Disney-esque in plot and pacing, and does not make use of the Fleischer Tabletop 3D background process. According to the film’s press release, its making involved two hundred colors and twenty-eight thousand individual, full-color drawings; the press release also mentions 3D animation, but such footage was never used in the final version. However, a glimpse can be obtained in a Popular Science short, which documents the film’s making, and reveals a sculpted model of the castle being photographed. Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp takes some liberties with the source material. The 1992 Disney version of Aladdin took many of those same liberties, including simplifying the numbers of genies and removing Aladdin's family from the plot. Running at twenty-one minutes, Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp is the longest entry in the \\"color feature\\" series, and the only one produced at the relocated Fleischer Studios facility in Miami, Florida. Today, this short and the other two Popeye Color Specials, Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor and Popeye the Sailor Meets Ali Baba's Forty Thieves (both of which were also adapted from a story featured in One Thousand and One Nights), are in the public domain, and are widely available on various home video and DVD collections, usually transferred from poor quality, old, faded prints. Warner Bros. has fully restored this cartoon with the original Paramount mountain logo opening and closing titles and is included in Popeye the Sailor: 1938-1940, Volume 2 which was released on June 17, 2008. It also includes a documentary on the making of this cartoon as a bonus feature in this collection.

It is a colorless, hygroscopic, and flammable tertiary amine. It is a gas at room temperature but is usually sold as a 40% solution in water. (It is also sold in pressurized gas cylinders.) TMA is a nitrogenous base and can be readily protonated to give trimethylammonium cation. Trimethylammonium chloride is a hygroscopic colorless solid prepared from hydrochloric acid. Trimethylamine is a good nucleophile, and this reaction is the basis of most of its applications. TMA is widely used in industry: it is used in the synthesis of choline, tetramethylammonium hydroxide, plant growth regulators or herbicides, strongly basic anion exchange resins, dye leveling agents, and a number of basic dyes. At higher concentrations it has an ammonia-like odor, and can cause necrosis of mucous membranes on contact. At lower concentrations, it has a \\"fishy\\" odor, the odor associated with rotting fish. In humans, ingestion of certain plant and animal (e.g., red meat, egg yolk) food containing lecithin, choline and L-carnitine provides certain gut microbiota with the substrate to synthesize TMA, which is then absorbed into the bloodstream. High levels of trimethylamine in the body are associated with the development of trimethylaminuria, or fish odor syndrome, caused by a genetic defect in the enzyme which degrades TMA; or by taking large doses of supplements containing choline or L-carnitine. TMA is metabolized by the liver to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO); TMAO is being investigated as a possible proatherogenic substance which may accelerate atherosclerosis in those eating foods with a high content of TMA precursors. TMA also causes the odor of some human infections, bad breath, and bacterial vaginosis. Trimethylamine is a full agonist of human TAAR5, Table 2: Microbial metabolites: their synthesis, mechanisms of action, and effects on health and disease Figure 1: Molecular mechanisms of action of indole and its metabolites on host physiology and disease a trace amine-associated receptor that is expressed in the olfactory epithelium and functions as an olfactory receptor for tertiary amines. One or more additional odorant receptors appear to be involved in trimethylamine olfaction in humans as well. Production Trimethylamine is prepared by the reaction of ammonia and methanol employing a catalyst: :3 CH3OH + NH3 → (CH3)3N + 3 H2O This reaction coproduces the other methylamines, dimethylamine (CH3)2NH and methylamine CH3NH2. Trimethylamine has also been prepared by a reaction of ammonium chloride and paraformaldehyde: : 9 (CH2=O)n \\\\+ 2n NH4Cl → 2n (CH3)3N•HCl + 3n H2O + 3n CO2↑  Toxicity  Acute and chronic toxic effects of TMA were suggested in medical literature as early as the 19th century. TMA causes eye and skin irritation, and it is suggested to be a uremic toxin. In patients, trimethylamine caused stomach ache, vomiting, diarrhoea, lacrimation, greying of the skin and agitation. Apart from that, reproductive/developmental toxicity has been reported. Guidelines with exposure limit for workers are available e.g. the Recommendation from the Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limits by the European Union Commission. Some experimental studies suggested that TMA may be involved in etiology of cardiovascular diseases. Applications Trimethylamine is used in the synthesis of choline, tetramethylammonium hydroxide, plant growth regulators, herbicides, strongly basic anion exchange resins, dye leveling agents and a number of basic dyes. Gas sensors to test for fish freshness detect trimethylamine. Reactions Trimethylamine is a Lewis base that forms adducts with a variety of Lewis acids. Trimethylaminuria Trimethylaminuria is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder involving a defect in the function or expression of flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) which results in poor trimethylamine metabolism. Individuals with trimethylaminuria develop a characteristic fish odor—the smell of trimethylamine—in their sweat, urine, and breath after the consumption of choline-rich foods. A condition similar to trimethylaminuria has also been observed in a certain breed of Rhode Island Red chicken that produces eggs with a fishy smell, especially after eating food containing a high proportion of rapeseed.

One served with the Army of the Potomac; the other served in the various armies of the western theater of the war. Overview In contrast to the Confederacy, which early on spawned such brilliant cavalry leaders as J.E.B. Stuart, Nathan B. Forrest, and John S. Mosby, the Union high command initially failed to understand the proper way to use cavalry during the early stages of the war. At the time, cavalry units in the Union armies were generally directly attached to infantry corps, divisions, and \\"wings\\" to be used as \\"shock troops,\\" and essentially played minimal roles in early Civil War campaigns. The Union cavalry was disgraced by Stuart's raids during the Peninsular, Northern Virginia, and Maryland Campaigns, where Stuart was able to ride around the Union Army of the Potomac with feeble resistance from the scant Federal cavalry. The Federals rarely even used cavalry as scouts or raiders in the early days of the war. Only a handful of Union cavalry officers, George Bayard, Benjamin Grierson, and John Buford among them, distinguished themselves in a positive way in the first two years of the war. Cavalry Corps, Army of the Potomac After the disastrous Fredericksburg Campaign, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker took command of the Army of the Potomac. One of Hooker's positive contributions was in creating a unified cavalry command in April 1863. Other than at Antietam, where the cavalry had been combined into a single division for a planned (but unengaged) attack on Lee's center, the Union cavalry had not been unified to date. Hooker organized three previously unrelated divisions into a single corps of cavalry, placing it under the unified command of George Stoneman. Hooker also began outfitting them with Sharps and Smith breechloading rifles, and, in a couple cases, with Spencer repeating rifles, giving them an advantage in firepower over the Confederates. =Chancellorsville= Despite Hooker's organizational changes, the new Cavalry Corps gave a poor accounting of itself during the Chancellorsville Campaign. Hooker ordered Stoneman to launch a diversionary raid against Richmond to distract Stuart's cavalry, but the raid was unsuccessful, resulting in the debacle at Kelly's Ford--an indecisive battle that forced the raid's premature abortion. Worse, Hooker kept only a single division--under Alfred Pleasonton--with the main army to use as scouts or screens while traveling through the dense \\"Wilderness,\\" accounting in part for the success of Stonewall Jackson's famous flank march on May 2. =Gettysburg= Stoneman and division commander William W. Averell were sacked after Chancellorsville, and replaced, respectively, by Alfred Pleasonton and David McM. Gregg. During the early stages of the Gettysburg Campaign, the cavalry first gained notice and respect from their Confederate foes at the Battle of Brandy Station, on June 9, 1863--the largest primarily cavalry engagement ever fought on the American continent. Though Pleasonton's men were ultimately defeated, this battle established the Union cavalry as no longer inefficient and overmatched, but a foe to be reckoned with. Numerous other changes were made in brigade command as the campaign progressed, and a number of young officers were promoted to brigade command, including Wesley Merritt, George Armstrong Custer, and Elon J. Farnsworth. Later in the campaign, Judson Kilpatrick's division, sent from the XXII Corps, joined up with the army. The cavalry divisions engaged Stuart in a number of fierce, hotly contested battles at Aldie, Middleburg, Upperville, Hanover, and several smaller engagements. It was John Buford's cavalry division which touched off the Battle of Gettysburg itself, engaging the Confederate division of Henry Heth to prevent him from occupying Gettysburg on July 1. Buford's troopers played a major part in slowing Heth's initial advance, and, after being relieved by infantry, spent the rest of July 1 screening and scouting. His division was sent to guard the army's supply trains for the remainder of the battle, but the divisions of Gregg and Kilpatrick remained on the field. On July 3, concurrent with Pickett's Charge, Gregg's division (with Custer's brigade of Kilpatrick's division) engaged Stuart east of Gettysburg and checked repeated Confederate advances. However, on the same day south of Gettysburg, Kilpatrick ordered a futile charge by the brigade of Elon J. Farnsworth against Confederate positions on Big Round Top, resulting in Farnsworth's death and heavy casualties among his men. The cavalry continued to perform aggressively in George Meade's pursuit of Lee into Virginia. In an irony, the last battle of the campaign, at Falling Waters, occurred between the remnants of Heth's and Buford's divisions. =1864= If any doubts remained as to the Union cavalry's equality with its Southern counterparts, they were dispelled during Ulysses S. Grant's Overland Campaign. The Cavalry Corps, now consisting of four divisions, was placed under command of the fiery Phillip Sheridan. In the early stages of the campaign, they engaged Stuart's cavalry in a series of ferocious, bloody battles, killing General Stuart at Yellow Tavern. Stuart's successor, Wade Hampton, proved to be an equally formidable foe at the battles of Haw's Shop, Old Church, Trevilian Station, and Battle of Saint Mary's Church. The Union cavalry spent most of the Petersburg Campaign trying to cut rail lines from Petersburg and Richmond. The bulk of the cavalry was sent under Sheridan to join the Army of the Shenandoah during Sheridan's campaign against Jubal Early in the summer of 1864 (see Valley Campaigns of 1864). After Sheridan's highly successful campaign concluded, the cavalry corps--along with the rest of his army--returned to join the Army of the Potomac. For the next several months, they resumed their slow but steady snipping off of Confederate supply and communication lines. =End of the war= The most conspicuous part played by the cavalry during the closing days of the war occurred in the week of March 25-April 1, 1865, when Lee, in a series of bold but understrength and futile counterattacks, tried to break through the Union lines at Fort Stedman. The IX Corps repulsed the attack. A week later, at Five Forks, Sheridan's cavalry played a decisive role in repulsing George Pickett's last desperate attack and routing his division. Sheridan and his men continued to play a major part in harassing Lee's army as it withdrew to Appomattox Court House. In the last battles fought in Virginia, it engaged Confederate cavalry in a desultory skirmish at Appomattox Station on April 8, and took part in a small skirmish the following day at the Battle of Appomattox Courthouse, which effectively concluded the war in Virginia. Western Cavalry Corps As in the East, the various Union commanders in the West generally used cavalry poorly during the first two years of the war; cavalry was again parcelled out to be attached to infantry corps as \\"shock troops\\" and scouts. Unlike in the East, where the cavalry proved itself the equal of its foes by the summer of 1863, the Union cavalry in the West struggled to identify an equal to Nathan B. Forrest, and were defeated in most of their major engagements. Grierson's famous raid during the Vicksburg Campaign was an aberration and far from the norm. The first attempt at a unified cavalry command occurred in late 1862/63, when William S. Rosecrans, commanding the Army of the Cumberland, organized all of his cavalry into a single division, acting as a separate command from the infantry, under the command of David S. Stanley. This new division fought respectably, if unremarkably, at Stones River. During the Tullahoma Campaign this cavalry division was expanded to corps size. Stanley commanded the corps with Robert B. Mitchell and John B. Turchin commanding the 1st and 2nd Divisions respectively. Mitchell commanded the corps at Chickamauga while Edward M. McCook and George Crook commanded the divisions. During the Atlanta Campaign, General William T. Sherman reorganized the cavalry of the armies of the Cumberland and Tennessee into four \\"columns\\", with no overall commander (the columns commanded by Stoneman, Kilpatrick, Edward McCook, and Israel Garrard). The cavalry continued to perform in a mediocre-at-best fashion, failing an abortive raid to free Andersonville prison camp and being repeatedly defeated by Joseph Wheeler's Confederate cavalry in a series of fights in central Georgia. During Sherman's March to the Sea, Kilpatrick's division remained with the army, serving again with a lack of real distinction, while the rest of the cavalry went north with George Thomas to repel John B. Hood's invasion of Tennessee, taking part in the actions at Spring Hill and Murfreesboro. In December 1864, just before the Battle of Nashville, a formal cavalry corps was finally organized, under Brevet Maj. Gen. James H. Wilson. It performed decently at Nashville, but, as before, failed to distinguish itself to any real degree. Wilson led the corps in one of the final battles of the war April 16, 1865, at the Battle of Columbus, where, fighting dismounted against Forrest's troopers, they were able to defeat their enemy-the only time Federal cavalry defeated General Forrest. The rest of the Union field armies typically had no unified large-scale cavalry commands as such, other than a corps-sized command, under Pleasonton, that was briefly organized by the Department of Missouri to defend that state against Sterling Price's expedition in 1864.

It emerged under the aegis of the Organisation of African Unity (since replaced by the African Union) which, at its 1979 Assembly of Heads of State and Government, adopted a resolution calling for the creation of a committee of experts to draft a continent-wide human rights instrument, similar to those that already existed in Europe (European Convention on Human Rights) and the Americas (American Convention on Human Rights). This committee was duly set up, and it produced a draft that was unanimously approved at the OAU's 18th Assembly held in June 1981, in Nairobi, Kenya. Pursuant to its Article 63 (whereby it was to \\"come into force three months after the reception by the Secretary General of the instruments of ratification or adherence of a simple majority\\" of the OAU's member states), the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights came into effect on 21 October 1986– in honour of which 21 October was declared \\"African Human Rights Day\\". Oversight and interpretation of the Charter is the task of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, which was set up on November 2, 1987 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and is now headquartered in Banjul, Gambia. A protocol to the Charter was subsequently adopted in 1998 whereby an African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights was to be created. The protocol came into effect on 25 January 2004. In July 2004, the AU Assembly decided that the ACHP would be incorporated into the African Court of Justice. In July 2005, the AU Assembly then decided that the ACHP should be operationalised despite the fact that the protocol establishing the African Court of Justice had not yet come into effect. Accordingly, the Eighth Ordinary Session of the Executive Council of the African Union meeting in Khartoum, Sudan, on 22 January 2006, elected the first judges of the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights. The relationship between the newly created Court and the commission is yet to be determined. As of 2019, 53 states have ratified the Charter.  Content  The African Charter on Human and People's Rights includes preamble, 3 parts, 4 chapters, and 63 articles. The Charter followed the footsteps of the European and Inter-American systems by creating a regional human rights system for Africa. The Charter shares many features with other regional instruments, but also has notable unique characteristics concerning the norms it recognizes and also its supervisory mechanism.Christof Heyns, the essentials of...Human Rights, 2005 The preamble commits to the elimination of Zionism, which it compares with colonialism and apartheid,African Charter on Human and Peoples's Rights, Preamble caused South Africa to qualify its 1996 accession with the reservation that the Charter fall in line with the UN's resolutions \\"regarding the characterization of Zionism.\\"  Norms contained in the Charter Civil and Political Rights= The Charter recognizes most of what are regarded universally accepted civil and political rights. The civil and political rights recognized in the Charter include the right to freedom from discrimination (Article 2 and 18(3)), equality (Article 3), life and personal integrity (Article 4), dignity (Article 5), freedom from slavery (Article 5), freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Article 5), rights to due process concerning arrest and detention (Article 6), the right to a fair trial (Article 7 and 25), freedom of religion (Article 8), freedom of information and expression (Article 9), freedom of association (Article 10), freedom to assembly (Article 11), freedom of movement (Article 12), freedom to political participation (Article 13), and the right to property (Article 14). Some human rights scholars however consider the Charter's coverage of other civil and political rights to be inadequate. For example, the right to privacy or a right against forced or compulsory labour are not explicitly recognised. The provisions concerning fair trial and political participation are considered incomplete by international standards. However, this is subject to argument as for example Article 5 of the Charter states \\"Every individual shall have the right to the respect of the dignity inherent in a human being and to the recognition of this legal status. All forms of exploitation and degradation of man particularly slavery, slave trade, torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment and treatment shall be prohibited\\" also, Article 15 states \\"Every individual shall have the right to work under equitable and satisfactory conditions, and shall receive equal pay for equal work\\" - which may be understood to prohibit forced or compulsory labour, although this is not explicitly mentioned. Similarly, the Charter does not explicitly recognise the right to vote as a means of political participation, but Article 13 states \\"(1) Every citizen shall have the right to participate freely in the government of his country, either directly or through freely chosen representatives in accordance with the provisions of the law. (2) Every citizen shall have the right to equal access to the public service of his country. (3) Every individual shall have the right of access to public property and services in strict equality of all persons before the law.\\" =Economic, Social and Cultural Rights= The Charter also recognises certain economic, social and cultural rights, and overall the Charter is considered to place considerable emphasis on these rights. The Charter recognises right to work (Article 15), the right to health (Article 16), and the right to education (Article 17). Through a decision by the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, SERAC v Nigeria (2001), the Charter is also understood to include a right to housing and a right to food as “implicit” in the Charter, particularly in light of its provisions on the right to life (Art. 4), right to health (Art. 16) and to development (Art. 22).Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2008) \\"The Right to Food and Access to Natural Resources\\". Rome. =Peoples' Rights and Group Rights= In addition to recognising the individual rights mentioned above the Charter also recognises collective or group rights, or peoples' rights and third-generation human rights. As such the Charter recognises group rights to a degree not matched by the European or Inter-American regional human rights instruments. The Charter awards the family protection by the state (Article 18), while \\"peoples\\" have the right to equality (Article 19), the right to self-determination (Article 20), to freely dispose of their wealth and natural resources (Article 21), the right to development (Article 22), the right to peace and security (Article 23) and \\"a generally satisfactory environment\\" (Article 24). =Duties= The Charter not only awards rights to individuals and peoples, but also includes duties incumbent upon them. These duties are contained in Article 29 and are as follows: * The duty to preserve the harmonious development of the family. * To serve the national community by placing both physical and intellectual abilities at its service. * Not to compromise the security of the State. * To preserve and strengthen social and national solidarity. * To preserve and strengthen national independence and the territorial integrity of one's country and to contribute to its defence. * To work to the best of one's abilities and competence and to pay taxes in the interest of society. * To preserve and strengthen positive African cultural values and in general to contribute to the promotion of the moral well-being of society. * To contribute to the best of one's abilities to the promotion and achievement of African unity.

Born in Midland, Texas, he was reared in Perryton in the northern Texas Panhandle. He graduated in 1966 from the University of Texas at Austin and spent two years at Harvard Divinity School. He began publishing short stories in 1967, while still working as a cowboy and ranch manager in Texas and Oklahoma. Hank and Drover are both dogs he'd worked with at the ranch. In 1982, after receiving numerous rejection slips from large publishers, Erickson borrowed $2,000 and began his own publishing company, Maverick Books. Hank the Cowdog debuted in The Cattleman, and two related short stories appeared in the first book published by Maverick Books, The Devil in Texas. Erickson began selling books out of his pickup truck wherever cowboys gathered. Erickson soon found himself receiving letters addressed to Hank, and so, the next year, in 1983, he published the first full-length book in the series, The Original Adventures of Hank the Cowdog. His 2,000-book first printing ran out in six weeks. With the book's success, he shortly afterward recorded the book, word- for-word, on audio tape. Hank the Cowdog has since become the longest-running successful children's series on audio. That book has since spawned over seventy sequels, becoming one of the most popular children's fiction series, selling more than 7.5 million books and winning several awards. The full series of books and tapes are usually available in most school libraries around the United States. His books are endorsed by the Texas Library Association and have, for two years, been serialized in The Dallas Morning News. His \\"Hank the Cowdog\\" series has been translated into Persian, Spanish, Danish, and Chinese, and have sold over 8.5 million copies. Erickson has written over seventy books, and is frequently invited to perform, reading book selections and singing songs, in classrooms and school libraries. He lives in Perryton with his wife. Life and career He was born John Richard Erickson in Midland, Texas on October 20, 1943. His parents were Joseph W. Erickson and Anna Beth Curry Erickson. In 1946 the family moved to Perryton in the Texas Panhandle. John Erickson attended school in Perryton and upon graduation studied at the University of Denver for a year. He then attended the University of Texas, where he met his future wife Kristine. They were married in 1967. Erickson later went to Harvard Divinity School but walked away a few credits short of graduating.http://www.lonestarliterary.com/john-r.-erickson-061415.html After leaving Harvard, Erickson began working as a cowboy and ranch manager on various ranches in Texas and Oklahoma. In 1982 he set up his own publishing company, Maverick Books, and began writing the Hank the Cowdog stories.https://world.wng.org/2016/04/the_cowboy_in_autumn On March 6, 2017, Erickson's ranch home was destroyed in the fires that swept across more than 315,000 acres of the Texas Panhandle. Upon his loss from the blaze, he quoted Scripture: \\"Naked we came into this world and naked we will leave it,\\" and added, \\"but we will sure miss that house.\\" His property is south of Perryton in Roberts County. In the books, Hank is \\"Head of Ranch Security\\" of an unnamed ranch in nearby Ochiltree County.

They were common in Western Australia before they disappeared in the early 20th century and persisted in the central deserts until at least the 1950s. The pelage was soft and silky and an ashen grey colouring overall, highlighted in part with rufous tones. There were light and dark patches of fur across the body, the moon-like crescents inspiring their names, and had attractive stripes on the face. Like the two remaining species of the genus, the northern Onychogalea unguifera and rare O. fraenata (bridled nailtail), it had a horny spur at the tip of its tail. The species was compared to a hare or rabbit, in its habits, appearance and taste, and weighed around 3.5 kilograms. The species was extremely timid and would flee to a hollow log if disturbed at their daytime resting places, a small patch of sand cleared near a large shrub or tree. They ran with their short forelimbs awkwardly held toward the chest.  Taxonomy  The first description and specimens of the animal were presented by John Gould to the Linnean Society of London in 1840 and published in its Proceedings in 1841, assigning the new species to the genus Macropus and the epithet derived from the Latin lunatus, meaning \\"of the moon\\", for its crescent-shaped marks. When Gould completed his second volume of Mammals of Australia (1849) he provided a lithograph depicting a male and female by Henry C. Richter and named the species as Onychogalea lunata, allying it to a genus established by George Waterhouse. The systematic revision of Australian mammals by Oldfield Thomas in 1888 recognised Gould's description as one of three species of the genus, and re-examined specimens from western and southern Australia that were held at the British Museum. Thomas noted the type specimen as one of the three collected by John Gilbert at the Swan River colony, the skin and skull of an immature male. Gould provided a common name for the species, lunated nail- tailed kangaroo, and cites John Gilbert's report for a name from the Nyungar language as \\"the Waurong\\". The term crescent wallaby was noted by Thomas for the species, and it came to distinguished as the crescent nail-tailed wallaby. A local term by settlers, kangaroo rabbit, was recorded by Gilbert, explained as the resemblance of the animal's soft fur and long ears to the exotic species. The names referring to the species include \\"tjawalpa\\" and \\"warlpartu\\", reported by Aboriginal peoples of the central deserts. Names recorded for other regions include ' in the Arunta language and the Pitjanjarra (Anangu people) names are \\"unkalda\\" and \\"towala\\" (\\"towalpo\\"). Variants on the name throughout the southwest of Australia, recorded by Gilbert and most subsequent historical sources from Nyungar informants, was regularised for common usage with the spelling \\"worong\\" or \\"wurrung\\" and syllabic pronunciation \\"wo'rong\\". Description  A species of Onychogalea, presumed to be extinct. They were one of the three known species of the genus, named for their distinctive tails that possessed a nail or claw-like tip. The animal was distinguished by a whitish crescent shaped mark that extends from the shoulder behind the arm, through the flank, and terminated in a point above the leg. A distinctly contrasting striping extends along the length of the hind limb, from the thigh to the hip and in a line to the knee. The weight of the species was around 3.5 kilograms, smaller than others of the genus. The head and body length combined was from 370 to 510 millimetres, greater than the tail length of 150 to 330 mm. The upper-parts of the pelage were an ash- grey colour, broken by the light crescent markings and a short blackish crest of hair along the top of tail. A less distinct blackish mark at either side of the muzzle reached from the nose to the eye. Oldfield Thomas gave a diagnosis of the three species, distinguishing their superficial characters and tabulating a close comparison of their cranial measurements. This species was regarded by Thomas as more closely allied to Onychogalea fraenata, both in size and skull morphology. The undercoat of the fur was relatively long, with hair that was slate-grey at the base and paler towards its tips; the texture of the pelage was woolly and soft. The relatively light skull was flattened at the forehead, dentition was also small and light; teeth such as the canines were tiny and probably purposeless. Their muzzle narrowed to a pointed shape, accentuated by the appealing light and dark markings of the face. The species was hunted for food by the English settlers of southwest Australia, who described the flesh as white, resembling chicken and having a flavour similar to rabbit.  Behaviour  The habits of O. lunata are poorly known, with information being restricted in the few reported observations and records of Aboriginal informants from the central desert regions. Observers often reported that the species was exceptionally timid and would seek refuge at the slightest indication of a human presence. John Gilbert's report to Gould in the early 1840s was quoted in his Mammals of Australia, Further observations of the animal were provided by Bruce Leake, a settler at Kellerberrin, who describes the fleeing animal as seeking refuge in a hollow tree and climbing far up to its interior to escape a pursuer. When pursued by Noongar hunters, they would light a fire at the base of the tree and use smoke to drive the animal out. A recollection by an informant, printed by The West Australian in 1925, stated they held one of the forelimbs as if carrying something and always seemed to be moving with an urgent manner. The behaviour was well known to the Aboriginal peoples of the central deserts, where the species persisted after their disappearance from the semi-arid regions, and were able to provide information some forty years since their last sighting in the mid twentieth century. The track of O. lunatus was distinguishable from the northern nailtail O. unguifera, which had a peculiar gait, and they could be captured by corralling them with brush fences and clubbed as they sought the exit. The habit of resting on their side in the open, noted by Gilbert at near the west coast, is also reported in its arid habitat as resting beneath the shade of a tree or shrub. Their choice of refuge from predators, a thicket or hollow log, varied between the people providing the information.  Distribution and habitat  A species with a wide distribution at the time of colonisation, it then contracted from the coast and is now presumably extinct. The distribution range covered a large area of the continent, from the northwestern coast through the central and southerly regions that extended toward New South Wales. They occupied a wide range of habitat in arid and semi-arid environments dominated by a variety of shrublands and woodlands. The habitat of the species was in a variety of vegetation types, although commonly associated with low scrub or thickets that were very dense. A common tree of the local environment was sheoak, Allocasuarina species, or the stinkwood Jacksonia furcellata. Their abode is comparable to a European hare, a simple clearing or \\"squat\\", and they resided in areas so densely vegetated that they were often unnoticed and unobtainable by hunters. While the species was found in denser habitat than the tammar Macropus eugenii, a similar macropod, they were often found in the same locations. The species was regarded as common, if not abundant, until its rapid decline. At the beginning of the 20th century Guy Shortridge was able to assemble a series of 23 specimens collected in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia. A South African curator and collector employed by the British Museum, Shortridge conducted what was the only major field survey of mammalian fauna in that period, and noted the absence of previously reported mammal species from the southern and western coastal regions. He was able to make collections inland from King George Sound, several specimens captured on the Arthur River near Wagin, and a larger collection made near Pingelly. Shortridge's second field report on 18 specimens from \\"Woyaline, east of Pinjelly\\", published by Oldfield Thomas in 1907, was to be amongst the last descriptions of the declining population: A collection made at Alice Springs on the Horn expedition (1894) extended the known range of the species. H. H. Finlayson reported in 1961 that he believed the species to be rare but still be extant, and gave the last record as one killed in 1956 between the Jervois and Tarlton Ranges of the Northern Territory. A field worker in Central Australian region, Finlayson extensively used interviews with the Aboriginal peoples still hunting in the region, and noted that it was disappearing from the area around the Musgrave, Everard Ranges in South Australia and the Cavenagh Range in Western Australia. Informants from the central deserts reported that it occupied all types of habitat, including stony hills and especially associated with mulga scrubland. References to the animal's distribution throughout the Flinders Ranges was reported by the Adnyamathanha people of the region. Displacement within a local ecology by the European rabbit may have amongst the factors responsible for their extirpation. Loss of habitat by clearing and degradation through the actions of altered land management practices, pastoralism, sheep and wheat farming, and degradation by extensive use of fire are assumed to be most significant factors in their extinction. However, the species is known to have persisted in areas of central desert that were invaded by the rabbit. The local disappearance of O. lunatus, along with all other small mammal species at Kellerberrin, was reported to Alexander Milligan by B. W, Leake as occurring during the 1890s. A specimen was collected at the Everard Ranges by Richard Helms, one of the few mammals returned by an expedition passing through central regions of Australia at a similar time to Leake's report. Localised extinctions appear to have preceded the arrival of cats and foxes to some regions, often regarded as major threatening factors in the collapse of mammalian fauna in Australia. When this catastrophic decline of small to medium-sized mammals, termed as those in the \\"critical weight range\\". is modeled as a hypothesised epizootic event, they are one of a group of species estimated to have weak immunity to the disease and succumbed to it either directly or by increased vulnerability to predators, however, they are not a species mentioned as directly affected in the anecdotal reports of a fatal disease. A news report of this and other small mammal species sudden disappearance at a road connecting Esperance and the Fraser Range, constructed in 1875, is consistent with modeling of the primary factor in the populations demise as disease. The epizootic theory includes secondary and tertiary causes for the extinction of the worong, the clearing for pastoralism that has also been proposed as the primary factor, and the remnants of the population being finally extirpated by hunting. Unrecorded since the last reliable sighting during the 1940s, the species is listed by the IUCN as presumed extinct. The conservation status was first assessed in 1965 as unknown, and in subsequent editions of the IUCN Red List as extinct. The species appears in palaeontological records dated to the Pleistocene and Holocene, found in local fauna of fossil sites from New South Wales to Western Australia. This wallaby remained common, even in agricultural districts in the southwest of Western Australia, until about 1900. It had begun a steep decline by 1908, when the last wallaby was caught in the area. The last specimen of this wallaby to be collected alive was caught in a dingo trap on the Nullarbor Plain in 1927 or 1928. W.A. Mills sent it to Taronga Zoo in Sydney and the animal ended up in the Australian Museum. The species survived in the more arid parts of its distribution until the 1950s, and it is thought that it became extinct at about 1956, probably because of the spread of the red fox.

The album was acclaimed by music critics.  Background and recording  Pleased to Meet Me is the only album recorded by the band as a trio. After their previous album Tim, guitarist Bob Stinson either was kicked out of the band (ostensibly for problems with drugs and alcohol, though most of the other Replacements also had serious substance abuse problems at the time) or quit on his own volition due to creative differences. The band recorded the demos for this album in August 1986, while Bob Stinson was still in the band; however he only showed up for one recording session. The main recording sessions for the album took place at Ardent Studios in Memphis between November 1986 and January 1987, under the supervision of producer Jim Dickinson. Guitarist Bob \\"Slim\\" Dunlap joined the band soon after the recording sessions.  Music and lyrics  While the punk roots of the group were still apparent on Tim, by Pleased to Meet Me they were there more in spirit as the band delved into other genres, such as soul and cocktail jazz, alongside tracks featuring their customary hard rocking sound. Perhaps due to the album's recording in soul music center Memphis, Tennessee, or the influence of producer Jim Dickinson, the band augmented its sound with saxophone on the tracks \\"I Don't Know\\" and \\"Nightclub Jitters\\" and a horn section on \\"Can't Hardly Wait\\", which features Big Star vocalist Alex Chilton on guitar. A music video was made for \\"The Ledge\\", but it was banned from airplay on MTV due to its lyrical content about suicide. The song \\"Can't Hardly Wait\\" was the inspiration for the title of the 1998 film Can't Hardly Wait, while \\"Alex Chilton\\" was made playable in the video game Rock Band 2. In 2009, Justin Townes Earle covered \\"Can't Hardly Wait\\" on his album Midnight at the Movies. In 2011, Chris Carrabba of Dashboard Confessional covered \\"Skyway\\" on his album Covered In The Flood. The Supernaturals covered \\"Skyway\\" on their 1997 single Prepare to Land.  Artwork and release  The album's cover art mocks the band's transition from young punks to successful musicians with a major record deal, depicting a handshake between one person clad in a suit, starched white shirt, glitzy watch and diamond ring and the other wearing a ripped workshirt. Westerberg was the man in the ripped shirt, but his face was not shown in the shot used on the cover. The self-mocking tone continues on the song, \\"I Don't Know\\", with its chorus, \\"One foot in the door/The other one in the gutter.\\" Pleased to Meet Me was released in 1987 by Sire Records and peaked at #131 on the Billboard Music Chart's Top 200. According to Our Band Could Be Your Life author Michael Azerrad, the album sold \\"about 300,000 copies.\\" On September 23, 2008, Pleased to Meet Me was remastered and reissued by Rhino Entertainment with 11 additional tracks consisting of studio demos, B-sides, and alternate takes.  Critical reception  Pleased to Meet Me was acclaimed by music critics.

The term does not refer to a known solid compound; it exists only in aqueous solution containing the calcium (Ca2+), bicarbonate (), and carbonate () ions, together with dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2). The relative concentrations of these carbon-containing species depend on the pH; bicarbonate predominates within the range 6.36–10.25 in fresh water. All waters in contact with the atmosphere absorb carbon dioxide, and as these waters come into contact with rocks and sediments they acquire metal ions, most commonly calcium and magnesium, so most natural waters that come from streams, lakes, and especially wells, can be regarded as dilute solutions of these bicarbonates. These hard waters tend to form carbonate scale in pipes and boilers and they react with soaps to form an undesirable scum. Attempts to prepare compounds such as solid calcium bicarbonate by evaporating its solution to dryness invariably yield instead the solid calcium carbonate:http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/chem99/chem99492.htm :Ca(HCO3)2(aq) → CO2(g) + H2O(l) + CaCO3(s). Very few solid bicarbonates other than those of the alkali metals except lithium and ammonium ion are known to exist. The above reaction is very important to the formation of stalactites, stalagmites, columns, and other speleothems within caves, and for that matter, in the formation of the caves themselves. As water containing carbon dioxide (including extra CO2 acquired from soil organisms) passes through limestone or other calcium carbonate-containing minerals, it dissolves part of the calcium carbonate, hence becomes richer in bicarbonate. As the groundwater enters the cave, the excess carbon dioxide is released from the solution of the bicarbonate, causing the much less soluble calcium carbonate to be deposited. In the reverse process, dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) in rainwater (H2O) reacts with limestone calcium carbonate (CaCO3) to form soluble calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO3)2). This soluble compound is then washed away with the rainwater. This form of weathering is called carbonation. In medicine, calcium bicarbonate is sometimes administered intravenously to immediately correct the cardiac depressor effects of hyperkalemia by increasing calcium concentration in serum, and at the same time, correcting the acid usually present.

It is congeneric with the roan antelope and sable antelope (belonging in the genus Hippotragus), but was smaller than either. It was sometimes considered a subspecies of the roan antelope, but a genetic study has confirmed it as a distinct species. The largest mounted bluebuck specimen is tall at the withers. Its horns measure along the curve. The coat was a uniform bluish-grey, with a pale whitish belly. The forehead was brown, darker than the face. Its mane was not as developed as in the roan and sable antelopes; its ears were shorter and blunter, not tipped with black; and it had a darker tail tuft and smaller teeth. It also lacked the contrasting black and white patterns seen on the heads of its relatives. The bluebuck was a grazer, and may have calved where rainfall, and thus the availability of grasses, would peak. The bluebuck was confined to the southwestern Cape when encountered by Europeans, but fossil evidence and rock paintings show that it originally had a larger distribution. Europeans encountered the bluebuck in the 17th century, but it was already uncommon by then, perhaps due to its preferred grassland habitat having been reduced to a range, mainly along the southern coast of South Africa. Sea level changes during the early Holocene may also have contributed to its decline by disrupting the population. The first published mention of the bluebuck is from 1681, and few descriptions of the animal were written while it existed. The few 18th-century illustrations appear to have been based on stuffed specimens. Hunted by European settlers, the bluebuck became extinct around 1800; it was the first large African mammal to face extinction in historical times, followed by the quagga in 1883. Only four mounted specimens remain, in museums in Leiden, Stockholm, Vienna, and Paris, along with skulls and horns in various museums. Taxonomy and etymology Allamand, based on the type specimen in Leiden In 1776, the German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas formally described the bluebuck as Antilope leucophaeus. In 1853, the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck stated that the type specimen was an adult male skin now in the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden (formerly Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie), collected in Swellendam and present in Haarlem before 1776. It has been questioned whether this was actually the type specimen, but in 1969, the Dutch zoologists Antonius M. Husson and Lipke Holthuis selected it as the lectotype of a syntype series, as Pallas may have based his description on multiple specimens. In 1846, the Swedish zoologist Carl Jakob Sundevall moved the bluebuck and its closest relatives to the genus Hippotragus; he had originally named this genus for the roan antelope (H. equinus) in 1845. This revision was commonly accepted by other writers, such as the British zoologists Philip Sclater and Oldfield Thomas, who restricted the genus Antilope to the blackbuck (A. cervicapra) in 1899. In 1914, the name Hippotragus was submitted for conservation (so older, unused genus names could be suppressed) to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) with the bluebuck as the type species. However, the original 1845 naming of the genus with the roan antelope as a single species was overlooked and later suppressed by the ICZN, leading to some taxonomic confusion. In 2001, the British ecologist Peter J. Grubb proposed that the ICZN should rescind its suppression of the 1845 naming and make the roan antelope the type species of Hippotragus, since too little is known about the bluebuck for it to be a reliable type species. This was accepted by the commission in 2003. According to German zoologist Erna Mohr's 1967 book about the bluebuck, the 1719 account of the Cape of Good Hope published by the traveler Peter Kolbe appears to be the first publication containing a mention of the species. Kolbe also included an illustration, which Mohr believed was based on memory and notes. In 1975, Husson and Holthuis examined the original Dutch version of Kolbe's book and concluded that the illustration did not depict a bluebuck, but rather a greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), and that the error was due to a mistranslation into German. The first published illustration of the bluebuck is therefore instead a depiction of a horn from 1764. It has also been pointed out that the animal had already been mentioned (as \\"blaue Böcke\\") on a list of South African mammals in 1681. Pennant, 1771, the second published illustration of this species The Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant made the next published illustration, and included an account of the antelope, calling it \\"blue goat\\", in his 1771 Synopsis of Quadrupeds, based on a skin from the Cape of Good Hope purchased from Amsterdam. In 1778, a drawing by the Swiss-Dutch natural philosopher Jean-Nicolas-Sébastien Allamand was included in Comte de Buffon's Histoire Naturelle; he called the antelope tzeiran, the Siberian name for the goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa). The illustration is widely believed to be based on the specimen in Leiden. This drawing is the first published illustration that shows the entire animal. Another record of the bluebuck appears in the travel memoirs of French explorer François Levaillant, published in the 1780s, describing his quest to discover the land to the east of the Cape of Good Hope, \\"Hottentots Holland\\". The German zoologist Martin Lichtenstein wrote about the bluebuck in 1812, but the species was mentioned less frequently in subsequent literature. Today, four mounted skins of the bluebuck remain: the adult male in Leiden, a young female at the Zoological Museum of Stockholm, an adult female in the Vienna Museum of Natural History, and an adult male in the Museum of Natural History in Paris. A mounted skin was housed in the Zoological Museum in Uppsala until the 19th century, but now only the horns remain. There are also records of a skin in Haarlem, but its current whereabouts are unknown. Several of these skins have been identified in various 18th-century illustrations. A female skull is part of the collection at both the Hunterian Museum and the Zoological Museum of Amsterdam, though it has been suggested that the Hunterian's belongs to a sable antelope (H.niger). A pair of horns is present at both the Natural History Museum, London, and the South African Museum. Skeletal remains have been found in both archaeological and palaeontological contexts. The common names \\"bluebuck\\" and \\"blue antelope\\" are English for the original Afrikaans name \\"blaubok\\" . The name is a compound of blauw and bok (\\"male antelope\\" or \\"male goat\\").\\"Blauwbok, n.\\" Dictionary of South African English. Dictionary Unit for South African English, 2018. Web. 25 February 2019. Variants of this name include \\"blaawwbok\\" and \\"blawebock\\". The generic name Hippotragus is Greek for \\"horse-goat\\", while the specific name leucophaeus is a fusion of two Greek words: leukos (\\"white\\") and phaios (\\"brilliant\\"). =Evolution= National Museum of Natural History, Paris Based on studies of morphology, the bluebuck has historically been classified as either a distinct species or as a subspecies of the roan antelope. After its extinction, some 19th-century naturalists began to doubt its validity as a species, with some believing the museum specimens to be small or immature roan antelopes, and both species were lumped together under the name A.leucophaeus by the English zoologist George Robert Gray in 1821. The Austrian zoologist Franz Friedrich Kohl pointed out the distinct features of the bluebuck in 1866, followed by Sclater and Thomas, who rejected the synonymy in 1899. In 1974, the American biologist Richard G. Klein showed (based on fossils) that the bluebuck and roan antelope occurred sympatrically on the coastal plain of the southwestern Cape from Oakhurst to Uniondale during the early Holocene, supporting their status as separate species. In 1996, an analysis of mitochondrial DNA extracted from the bluebuck specimen in Vienna showed that it is outside the clade containing the roan and sable antelopes. The study therefore concluded that the bluebuck is a distinct species, and not merely a subspecies of the roan antelope as was supposed. The cladogram below shows the position of the bluebuck among its relatives, following the 1996 analysis: The sable antelope, the closest extant relative of the bluebuck In 2017, a reconstruction of the entire bluebuck mitogenome, based on bone powder extracted from the horns in Uppsala, contradicted the 1996 results. This study instead placed the bluebuck as a sister species to the sable antelope, with the roan antelope as an outgroup. The bluebuck and sable antelope diverged from each other 2.8 million years ago, while the roan antelope diverged from both of them 4.17 million years ago. Africa was going through climactic oscillations between 3.5 and 2 million years ago, and during a colder period, the ancestors of the sable antelope and bluebuck may have been separated, and the population in southern Africa eventually became a new species. The cladogram below shows the placement of the bluebuck according to the 2017 study: Description Head of the Vienna skin The adult male bluebuck in Leiden is tall at the withers, and is possibly the largest known specimen. According to Sclater and Thomas, the tallest specimen is the one in Paris, a male that stands at the shoulder; the specimen in Vienna, on the other hand, is the shortest, a tall female. The bluebuck was notably smaller than the roan and sable antelopes, and therefore the smallest member of its genus. The coat was a uniform bluish-grey, with a pale whitish belly, which was not contrasted on the flanks. The limbs had a faint dark line along their front surface. The forehead was brown, darker than the face, and the upper lip and patch in front of the eyes were lighter than the body. The neck-mane was directed forwards and not as developed as in the roan and sable antelopes, and the throat-mane was almost absent. Other differences between the bluebuck and its extant relatives included its shorter and blunter ears not tipped with black, a darker tail tuft (though little darker than its general colour), and smaller teeth. The bluebuck also lacked the contrasting black and white patterns seen on the heads of its relatives. Smit and Wolf, from before 1899; the image may be based on the Paris skin, and the neck-mane is perhaps depicted as too long. As the old skins are presumably faded, it may be difficult to reconstruct the original colour of the bluebuck from them. Pennant observed that the eyes had white patches below them and the underbelly was white; the coat was a \\"fine blue\\" in living specimens, while it changed to \\"bluish grey, with a mixture of white\\" in dead animals. He also suggested that the length of the bluebuck's hair and the morphology of its horns formed a link between antelopes and goat. He went on to describe the ears as pointed and over long and the tail as long, terminating in a long tuft. The horns of the bluebuck were significantly shorter and thinner than those of the roan antelope, but perhaps proportionally longer. The horns of the Leiden specimen measure along the curve. The horns at Hunterian Museum are spaced apart and are nearly long with a basal circumference of nearly . Pennant gave the horn length as . He added that the horns, sharp and curving backward, consist of twenty rings. Text Archive This description agrees with the horns at the Hunterian Museum. The skull at the Hunterian Museum measures in length. The horns of the bluebuck appear to have hollow pedicles (bony structures from which the horns emerge). Behaviour and ecology Illustration of a bluebuck and a klipspringer, 1851 The bluebuck, as Klein puts it, became extinct before \\"qualified scientists could make observations on live specimens\\". According to historical accounts, the bluebuck formed groups of up to 20 individuals. Similarities to the roan and the sable antelopes in terms of dental morphology make it highly probable that the bluebuck was predominantly a selective grazer, and fed mainly on grasses. The row of premolars was longer than in others of the genus, implying the presence of dicots in the diet. A 2013 study by the Australian palaeontologist J. Tyler Faith and colleagues noted the scarcity of morphological evidence to show that the bluebuck could have survived the summers in the western margin of the Cape Floristic Region (CFR), when the grasses are neither palatable nor nutritious. This might have induced a west-to-east migration, because the eastern margin receives rainfall throughout the year while precipitation in the western margin is limited to winter. An 18th-century account suggests that females might have left their newborn calves in isolation and returned regularly to suckle them until the calves were old enough to join herds, which is similar to the behaviour of roan and sable antelopes. Akin to other grazing antelopes, the bluebuck probably calved mainly where rainfall, and thus the availability of grasses, peaked. Such locations could be the western margin of the CFR during winter and the eastern margin of the CFR during summer. Faith et al. 2013 found that the occurrence of juveniles in bluebuck fossils decreases linearly from the west to the east, indicating that most births took place in the western CFR; due to the preference for rainfall, it may be further assumed that most births occurred during winter, when the western CFR receives most of its rainfall. The annual west-to-east migration would have followed in summer, consistent with the greater number of older juveniles in the east that would have joined herds. Juvenile fossils also occur in other places across the range, but appear to be concentrated in the western CFR. Distribution and habitat Gordon, possibly showing the Paris skin Endemic to South Africa, the bluebuck was confined to the southwestern Cape. A 2003 study estimated the expanse of the historic range of the bluebuck at , mainly along the southern coast of South Africa; fossils, however, have been discovered in a broader area that includes the southern and western CFR and even the highlands of Lesotho. Historical records give a rough estimate of its range. On 20January 1774, Swedish naturalist Carl Peter Thunberg recorded a sighting in Tigerhoek, Mpumalanga. In March or April 1783, Levalliant claimed to have witnessed two specimens in Soetemelksvlei, Western Cape. Based on these notes, a 2009 study by the South African zoologist Graham I. H. Kerley and colleagues estimated the range of the bluebuck to be limited within a triangular area in the Western Cape, bounded by Caledon to the west, Swellendam to the northeast and Bredasdorp to the south. Rock paintings in the Caledon river valley of the Free State province in eastern South Africa have been identified as bluebucks, which also confirms the once wider distribution of the species. Frontlet with horns, Natural History Museum, London In 1974, Klein studied the fossils of Hippotragus species in South Africa. Most of these were found to represent the bluebuck and the roan antelope. The fossil record suggested that the bluebuck occurred in large numbers during the last glacial period (nearly 0.1million years ago), and was more common than sympatric antelopes. The bluebuck could adapt to more open habitats than could the roan antelope, a notable point of difference between these species. Fossils of the bluebuck have been found in the Klaises River and the Nelson Bay Cave (near Plettenberg Bay) and Swartklip (to the west of the Hottentots Holland mountains). Faith et al. 2013 noted that the western and southern CFR were separated by biogeographical barriers, such as the Cape Fold Belt and afromontane forests. A 2011 study suggested that low sea levels facilitated migrations for large mammals; therefore the rise in sea levels with the beginning of the Holocene would have led to fragmented bluebuck populations and distanced many populations from the western coast (fossils dating to this period are scarce in the western coast but have been recorded from the southern coast). Thus, a mass extinction could have taken place, leaving behind mainly the populations that remained in the resource-rich western CFR. The causes of the drastic decline in bluebuck populations just before the 15th and 16th centuries have not been investigated; competition with livestock and habitat deterioration could have been major factors in its depletion. Faith et al. 2013 further suggested that the bluebuck, being a grazer, probably favoured grassland habitats. This hypothesis is supported by fossil evidencebluebuck fossils appear in significant numbers along with those of grassland antelopes. Kerley et al. 2009 suggested that the bluebuck frequented grasslands and shunned wooded areas and thickets. In a 1976 study of fossils in the Southern Cape, Klein observed that the bluebuck's habitat preferences were similar to those of the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and the reedbucks (Redunca). Extinction Drawing of the Leiden specimen, by Levaillant, 1781 Due to the small range of the bluebuck at the time of European settlement of the Cape region in the 17th and 18th centuries compared to the much wider area evidenced by fossil remains, it is thought the species was already in decline before this time. The bluebuck was the sole species of Hippotragus in the region until 70,00035,000 years ago, but the roan antelope appears to have become predominant about 11,000 years ago. This might have coincided with grasslands being replaced by, for example, brush and forest, thereby reducing what is presumed to be the preferred habitat of the bluebuck, the grasslands. The results of the sea level changes in the early Holocene may also have played a role in the decline of the species, and left only the southern population to survive into historical times. The bluebuck was hunted to extinction by European settlers; in 1774 Thunberg noted that it was becoming increasingly rare. The German biologist Hinrich Lichtenstein claimed that the last bluebuck had been shot in 1799 or 1800. The bluebuck is the first historically recorded large African mammal to become extinct, followed by the quagga (Equus quagga quagga), which died out in 1883. Around the time of its extinction, the bluebuck occurred in what would be known as the Overberg region (Western Cape), probably concentrated in Swellendam. In 1990, the South African zoologist Brian D. Colohan argued that an 1853 eyewitness report of a \\"bastard gemsbok\\" seen near Bethlehem, Free State, actually referred to a bluebuck, 50 years after the last individuals in Swellendam were shot. The IUCN Red List accepts Lichtenstein's dates of extinction. Cultural significance The bluebuck rock paintings from the Caledon river valley have been attributed to Bushmen. They show six antelopes facing a man, and were supposedly inspired by shamanic trance; they may depict a Bushman visiting the spirit-world through a tunnel. The Bushmen possibly believed that the bluebuck had a supernatural potency, like other animals in their environment. The animals in the paintings are similar in proportion to the reedbuck, but the large ears, horns, and lack of a mane rule out species other than the bluebuck. A South African fable, The Story of the Hare, mentions a bluebuck (referred to as inputi) that, among other animals, is appointed to guard a kraal. The bluebuck is also mentioned in French novelist Jules Verne's Five Weeks in a Balloon (1863); the animal is described as a \\"superb animal of a pale-bluish color shading upon the gray, but with the belly and the insides of the legs as white as the driven snow\\".

Distribution Knobbed whelks are native to the North Atlantic coast of North America from Cape Cod, Massachusetts to northern Florida. This species is common along the Georgia coast. It is the state shell of New Jersey and Georgia. Shell description Knobbed whelk shells Busycon carica ssp. eliceans The shell of most knobbed whelks is dextral, meaning that it is right-handed. If the shell is held in front of the viewer, with the spiral end up and the opening facing the viewer, the opening will be on the animal's right side. The shell is thick and strong and has six clockwise coils. The surface is sculpted with fine striations and there is a ring of knob-like projections protruding from the widest part of the coil. The color is ivory or pale gray, and the large aperture (the inside of the opening) is orange. The canal inside is wide and the entrance can be closed by a horny oval operculum.Knobbed Whelk: Shell Money Retrieved 2011-11-28.  Life habits  The knobbed whelk lives subtidally and is migratory, alternating between deep and shallow water, depending on the time of year. During the weather extremes of the summer and winter months, these sea snails live in deep water, at depths of up to 48 m. In the milder weather of the spring and fall they live in shallow water, on near-shore or intertidal mud flats and sand flats. On the shallow-water mud flats whelks prey on oysters, clams, and other marine bivalves. They wedge a bivalve open using the edge of their shell, and insert their long proboscis to eat the flesh of their victim. They rasp at the flesh using their radula, a rough tongue-like organ that has thousands of tiny denticles (tooth-like protrusions).  Reproduction  Whelk egg case Mating and egg laying occur during the spring and fall migration. Internally fertilized eggs are surrounded by a transparent mass of albumen, a gel-like material, and are laid in protective flat, rounded egg capsules joined to form a paper-like chain of egg cases, commonly called a \\"Mermaid's Necklace\\". On average each capsule contains 0-99 eggs, with most strings having 40-160 capsules. After laying their egg cases, female knobbed whelk will bury one end of the egg case into the substrate, thus providing an anchor for the developing fertilized eggs and preventing the string of egg cases from washing ashore where it would dehydrate. Fertilized eggs develop in the capsules. Young emerge with a shell approximately 2–4 mm in length. Young are preyed upon by crustaceans, horseshoe crabs, and fish, primarily drum species. Adult whelks are eaten by loggerhead sea turtles.  Human use  As with conchs, the knobbed whelk is used by humans as food in such dishes as salads (raw), burgers, fritters, and chowders. As is also true of conch shells, the shell of the knobbed whelk can be made into a natural bugle by cutting off the tip of the spire in order to form a mouthpiece. Historically, American Indians used the knobbed whelk as a component in wampum, the shell beads exchanged in North America for trade.

A variant of TMAU (secondary trimethylaminuria or TMAU2) exists where there is no genetic cause, yet excessive TMA is secreted, possibly due to intestinal dysbiosis, altered metabolism, or hormonal causes.  Symptoms  Trimethylamine builds up in the bodies of patients with trimethylaminuria. The trimethylamine is released in the person's sweat, urine, reproductive fluids, and breath, giving off a strong fishy or body odor. Some people with trimethylaminuria have a strong odor all the time, but most have a moderate smell that varies in intensity over time. Individuals with this condition do not have any physical symptoms, and they typically appear healthy. The condition seems to be more common in women than men, for unknown reasons. Scientists suspect that such female sex hormones as progesterone and estrogen aggravate the condition. According to several reports, the condition worsens around puberty. In women, symptoms may worsen just before and during menstrual periods, after taking oral contraceptives, and around menopause. The odor seems to vary depending on many known factors, including diet, hormonal changes, stress level, amount of sweat, other odors in the space, and the observer's sense of smell.  Genetics  Trimethylaminuria has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Most cases of trimethylaminuria appear to be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder are both carriers of one copy of the altered gene. Carriers may have mild symptoms of trimethylaminuria or experience temporary episodes of fish-like body odor. Mutations in the FMO3 gene, which is found on the long arm of chromosome 1, cause trimethylaminuria. The FMO3 gene makes an enzyme that breaks down nitrogen-containing compounds from the diet, including trimethylamine. These compounds are produced by bacteria in the intestine as they digest proteins from eggs, meat, soy, and other foods. Normally, the FMO3 enzyme converts fishy-smelling trimethylamine into trimethylamine N-oxide which has no odor. If the enzyme is missing or its activity is reduced because of a mutation in the FMO3 gene, trimethylamine is not broken down and instead builds up in the body. As the compound is released in a person's sweat, urine, and breath, it causes the strong odor characteristic of trimethylaminuria. Researchers believe that stress and diet also play a role in triggering symptoms. There are more than 40 known mutations associated with TMAU. Loss-of-function mutations, nonsense mutations, and missense mutations are three of the most common. Nonsense and missense mutations cause the most severe phenotypes. Although FMO3 mutations account for most known cases of trimethylaminuria, some cases are caused by other factors. A fish-like body odor could result from an excess of certain proteins in the diet or from an increase in bacteria in the digestive system. A few cases of the disorder have been identified in adults with liver damage caused by hepatitis. In 2007 the evolution of the FMO3 gene was studied, including the evolution of some mutations associated with TMAU.  Diagnosis  Measurement of urine for the ratio of trimethylamine to trimethylamine oxide is the standard screening test. A blood test is available to provide genetic analysis. The prominent enzyme responsible for TMA N-oxygenation is coded by the FMO3 gene. False positives can occur in the following conditions, where elevated TMA can be present in the urine without any underlying TMAU: * Urinary tract infection * Bacterial vaginosis * Cervical cancer * Advanced liver or kidney disease A similar foul- smelling odor of the urine has also been associated with colonization of the urinary tract with a bacterium called Aerococcus urinae, especially in children.Lenherr N, Berndt A, Ritz N, Rudin C. Aerococcus urinae: a possible reason for malodorous urine in otherwise healthy children. Eur J Pediatr. 2014;173:1115-7; Gibb AP, Sivaraman B. A second case of foul smelling urine in a boy caused by Aerococcus urinae. Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2013;32:1300-1.  Treatment  There is no known cure or treatment for the disorder. The metabolic and clinical manifestations of TMAU are generally regarded as benign, as there is no associated organ dysfunction. This designation, and the fact that the condition is often unrecognised by doctors, can have important ramifications including missed or delayed diagnosis. Affected individuals experience shame and embarrassment, fail to maintain relationships, avoid contact with people who comment on their condition, and are obsessive about masking the odour with hygiene products and even smoking. The malodorous aspect can have serious and destructive effects on schooling, personal life, career and relationships, resulting in social isolation, low self-esteem, depression, paranoid behaviour, and suicide. Delayed diagnosis, body odour and the lack of cure may lead to psychosocial issues. When the condition is suspected or known to occur in a family, genetic testing can be helpful in identifying the specific individuals who have or carry the disorder. Ways of reducing the fishy odor may include: * Avoiding foods such as egg yolks, legumes, red meats, fish, beans and other foods that contain choline, carnitine, nitrogen, sulfur and lecithin * Taking low doses of antibiotics such as neomycin and metronidazole in order to reduce the amount of bacteria in the gut * Using slightly acidic detergent with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5 Additionally, at least one study has suggested that daily intake of the supplements activated charcoal and copper chlorophyllin may improve the quality of life of individuals afflicted with TMAU by helping their bodies to oxidize and convert TMA to the odorless N-oxide (TMAO) metabolite. Study participants experienced subjective reduction in odor as well as objective reduction in TMA and increase in TMAO concentration measured in their urine. The study found that: * 85% of test participants experienced complete loss of detectable \\"fishy\\" odor * 10% experienced some reduction in detectable odor * 5% did not experience any detectable odor reduction  History  The first clinical case of TMAU was described in 1970.

Those chosen for recognition receive the Carnegie Medal and become eligible for scholarship aid and other benefits. A private operating foundation, the Hero Fund was established in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1904 with a trust fund of $5 million by Andrew Carnegie, the Scottish-American industrialist and philanthropist. History The fund was inspired by Selwyn M. Taylor and Daniel A. Lyle, who gave their lives in rescue attempts following the Harwick Mine disaster in Harwick, Pennsylvania, just outside Pittsburgh, on January 25, 1904. The disaster claimed 181, including Taylor and Lyle, who were killed during rescue attempts. Greatly touched by Taylor's and Lyle's sacrifice, Carnegie had medals privately minted for their families, and within two months he wrote the Hero Fund's governing \\"Deed of Trust\\", which was adopted by the newly created commission on April 15, 1904. Administration The Fund is administered by a 21-member volunteer board and a small staff.Commission Members and Staff, Carnegie Hero Fund Commission. As of December 2018, a total of 10,062 Carnegie Medals have been awarded since the Fund was established, with the Fund paying $40.5 million in grants, scholarships, death benefits, and other aid.18 named Carnegie heroes for acts of extraordinary heroism, Carnegie Hero Fund Commission, December 18, 2018.

It lived on the islands of Réunion and Mauritius in the Mascarene Islands of the Indian Ocean. It was abundant, with up to 400 sometimes crowding together at a single roost in a cave or in an ancient, hollow tree, while most other fruit bats prefer to roost in the branches of large trees. Local people believed there was only one male per roost, which may indicate the sexes roosted separately and the large roosts were maternity colonies. This flying fox was nocturnal and had delicate teeth, so it probably fed on nectar and possibly soft fruit. Engraving from 1763 Drawings of the head and dentition from 1899 As it roosted in old trees and caves, it was vulnerable to forest clearance and hunting. It probably vanished in the 19th century. There are specimens in museums in Paris, London, Berlin, and Sydney. They are adorable. A description by La Nux from 1772 states: \\"When I arrived these animals were as common, even in the settled areas, as they are rare today. They are hunted for their meat, for their fat, for young individuals, throughout all the summer, all the autumn and part of the winter, by whites with a gun, by negros with nets. The species must continue to decline, and in a short time. In abandoning populated areas to retreat to those that are yet to be so, and into the interior of the island, fugitive negros do not spare them when they can get them .... I ought to put in here what little I know about rougettes. One never sees them flying by day. They live communally in the large hollows of rotten trees, in numbers sometimes exceeding four hundred. They only leave in the evening as darkness falls and return before dawn. One is assured, and it is taken in this island for granted, that, however many individuals make up one of these associations, there is but a single male. I have not been able to verify this fact. I should only say that these sedentary animals become fat; that at the beginning of the colony, numerous poorly off and unfastidious people, taught no doubt by the Malacasses, provided themselves plentifully with this fat for preparing their food. I have seen the time when a bat-tree (it is thus that one used to call the retreats of our rougettes) was a real find. It used to be easy, as far as one can judge, to prevent these animals leaving, than to take them out alive one by one, or to suffocate them with smoke, and in one way or another discover the number of males or females of which the association was composed; I do not know any more about this species. \\" References Category:Extinct mammals Category:Mammal extinctions since 1500 Category:Extinct mammals of Africa Category:Species made extinct by human activities Category:Mammals of Mauritius Category:Mammals of Réunion Category:Bats of Africa †Small Mauritian flying fox Category:Mammals described in 1792 Category:Extinct animals of Mauritius Category:Species endangered by invasive species Category:Species endangered by deforestation ","title":"Small Mauritian flying fox"},{"id":"1620555","text":"WHPK (88.5 FM) is an American radio station based in Hyde Park on the South Side of Chicago, established in 1968.

The big-eared hopping mouse was a small, rat-sized animal resembling a tiny kangaroo. It had large eyes and ears with a brush-tipped tail. It moved on its four legs when traveling at a slower pace, or by bounding upon its enlarged, padded, hind feet when traveling quickly. They mainly lived in sand dunes and made nests of leaves and other organic materials. The big-eared hopping-mouse was last collected in July 1843 near the Moore River, Western Australia, close to where New Norcia is now situated, and has not been seen since. The big-eared hopping mouse was among many hopping mice to be extinct, and its absence from extensive sub-fossil collections suggests it was restricted to Western Australia. Of the six taxa with ranges limited to Western Australia, five are considered threatened or vulnerable and one, the big-eared hopping mouse, is extinct. Under the Western Australian Wildlife Conservation Act of 1950, the hopping mouse is listed as “fauna presumed to be extinct” and under Commonwealth legislation, simply “extinct”. We only know about the hopping mouse from two damaged specimen: one from which the location it was found in is unknown and one at Moore River in Western Australia. The last record dates from 19 July 1843 and was collected in Perth around the Moore River and King George’s Sound by John Gilbert, who was employed by John Gould. Land around the Moore originally consisted of coastal heathland, woodland, and forest. Gilbert focused primarily on rodent species, but collected several rodent species, including Notomys macrotis. It is known from two damaged specimens held in the Natural History Museum, London. There is speculation as to whether the species was last collected in July 1843, for in the 19th and early 20th centuries there was an absence of scientific data in the area of which the big-eared hopping mouse inhabited. Drying conditions throughout much of the continent of Australia likely account for the relatively poor Miocene fossil record. Murid rodents likely entered northern Australia from Southeast Asia through relatively dry corridors sometime between 8 and 5 million years ago, during the late Miocene. Perhaps during this period, many modern groups of rodents underwent explosive radiations to produce the high diversity of species lineages that are present today, including the big-eared hopping mouse. The mammal order Rodentia has an extensive non-Australian representation and almost certainly arrived as diversified groups with closer phylogenetic relationships to non-Australian mammals. During the Pliocene period, directly following the Miocene period, mammal communities In Australia began to change as a result of this fairly recent influx of new orders and families, which would have included the big-eared hopping mouse. Alternatively, murids may have entered Australia already differentiated into various groups. This potential is, however, limited by the total absence of rodents in the late Miocene Alcoota and Ongeva Local Faunas of the Northern Territory. Currently there is no evidence or scientific method to test these alternative scenarios. Seven species of native Australian rodent have become extinct and several others have significantly declined in numbers since the settlement of Europeans in Australia. These rodents make up 48% of the total mammals extinct in Western Australia. The hopping mouse was probably the first Australian mammal to succumb to European settlers. Hopping mice are vulnerable to agriculture and pastoralism, as well as introduced cats. During a plague, mice can comprise up to 100% of the diet of a feral cat, lending support to the theory that feral cats were the primary cause of their extinction. By the 1850s, feral cats inhabited the Western Australian wheatbelt; they targeted a number of larger rodents throughout Western Australia. However, extinction occurred before the red fox came to Western Australia. The big-eared hopping mouse had no defenses against Australia's introduced species. Its extinction can possibly be shown as a ramification of environmental alteration by humans, and predation is another likely possibility, but the true reason for the extinction is uncertain. The presumed decade of extinction is unknown, but is possibly the 1860s, which was soon after the date of the last known specimen. Australian rodents, not including the big-eared hopping mouse, currently comprise roughly 25% of the modern species-level diversity of terrestrial mammals of the continent. There are many known reasons for the extinction of the big-eared hopping mouse. These factors include; the predation by feral cats, exotic disease, habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as, habitat degradation and the depletion of resources as a result of livestock and feral herbivores. Each of these causal factors are rated with differing levels of “consequence” in effecting the extinction of the big-eared hopping mouse. Exotic disease held a severe to catastrophic position in contributing to the extinction of the big-eared hopping mouse. An epizootic disease had a heavy impact on a large number of mammal species in Western Australia, Notomys macrotis included. This disease in conjunction with drought conditions and the presence of feral cats helped lead to the extinction of the big-eared hopping mouse. Habitat degradation, loss and fragmentation all had moderate to severe ratings for the extinction of this species. The big-eared hopping mouse lived in sand dune environments, the same of which were used in the 1800s for sheep herding, as well as mass land clearing. Both of these impacted the condition of the soils, grass, nutrients, leaves, and other organic materials in the mouse’s habitat. The destruction of their burrows, resources, and food supply led to the extinction of this species. In addition to the well known causes for the big-eared hopping mice’s extinction there are other factors that may have influenced its extinction as well. Certain characteristics that the big- eared hopping possessed such as its size, location and niche might have influenced its ultimate extinction. Studies have shown that by comparison mammals in Australia have lower resting metabolic rates than those of other continents. Studies have also shown that small animals, such as the big-eared hopping mice need high resting metabolic rate to attain the large metabolic scope needed in order to regulate body temperature. Consequently, an animal with a high resting metabolic rate has “reduced mortality and increased longevity and fecundity”. In short the fact that the big-eared hopping mouse lived in a location where animals have a relatively low resting metabolic rate in addition to its need of a high metabolic rate due to its size might have been factors that influenced its extinction. Moreover, the niche that the big- eared hopping mice occupied may have also led it down the path of extinction. The big-eared hopping mouse exhibited “morphological or physiological adaptations to their particular way of life”. This mouse had a specialized niche, an extinction promoting trait because “species that were both rare and specialized were especially vulnerable to extinction”. Within the genus Notomys there exist two clades. The big eared hopping mouse Notomys macrotis is classified in the same clade as the short-tailed hopping mouse, Notomys amplus, and the great hopping mouse, Notomys sp, both of whom are extinct. They are classified together due to their similar size. It also shares similar morphology with the fawn hopping mouse, Notomys cervinus, and the long-tailed hopping mouse, Notomys longicaudatus, due to the fact that they all lack the derived reproductive tract of the spinifex hopping mouse (Notomys alexis) clade Its closest phylogenetic relative is probably Notomys cervinus.

It then runs through the southern portion of Clinton County, including DeWitt. It flows into the Grand River in Portland in southeast Ionia County. The stream starts as a slow soft-bottom waterway. On the between the Livingston County line and Laingsburg the river averages wide. There is more activity in the lower stretch below DeWitt, where there is good fishing and canoeing.  Settlement history  The earliest known settlers of the Looking Glass Watershed were the Sauk people who were eventually replaced by people of the Chippewa and Ottawa tribes. The area was highly regarded for its abundance of game and fish. White settlers came to the area following trails up the Flint and Shiawassee rivers inland from Detroit and Port Huron.  Conservation  In Clinton County, the river flows through the A Looking Glass Sanctuary, a nature preserve owned by the Michigan Nature Association.A Looking Glass Sanctuary Michigan Nature Association References Category:Rivers of Michigan Category:Rivers of Livingston County, Michigan Category:Rivers of Shiawassee County, Michigan Category:Rivers of Clinton County, Michigan Category:Rivers of Ionia County, Michigan Category:Tributaries of Lake Michigan ","title":"Looking Glass River"},{"id":"1620577","text":"A Whistle in the Dark is a play by Tom Murphy that premiered on September 11, 1961 at the Joan Littlewood's Theatre Royal, Stratford East, London, having been rejected by the Abbey Theatre, Dublin. It then went on to be a West End hit. Murphy was twenty-five years old at the time. The play tells the story in three acts of the climactic confrontation between Michael, the oldest of the Carney sons, and his father and brothers, a brawling, hard-drinking, criminal gang of Irish immigrants living and working in Coventry. A powerful portrayal of tribal violence and the devastation it brings in its wake in spite of attempts to stand against it, it remains Murphy's best known and most performed play. John Lahr of The Village Voice saw its influence in Harold Pinter's The Homecoming. Other plays showing its influence are Gary Mitchell's In a Little World of Our Own and Rod Wooden's Your Home In The West.

The production was helmed by Irish director Jason Byrne and starred Joseph Ziegler, Jonathan Goad, Allan Hawco, Philip Riccio and Sarah Dodd. It was named “Best of 2005” in Canadian newspapers including The Globe and Mail, National Post, Now Magazine, and eye weekly. National Post called it a “masterpiece production of a masterpiece play”. It also received two nominations for Dora Mavor Moore awards, specifically Outstanding Production and Outstanding Lead Performance Male for Joseph Ziegler. In 2007, the Company Theatre remounted A Whistle in the Dark with the same director and most of the same cast. It played at LSPU Hall in St. John's, Newfoundland in March and at the Young Centre for the Performing Arts in Toronto in April of that year.

It is one of only a handful of large amphibious aircraft to have been produced in large numbers during the post-war era, and the first to be developed from the onset as a water bomber. The CL-215 is a twin-engine, high-wing aircraft, that was designed during the 1960s. From an early stage, it was developed to perform aerial firefighting operations as a water bomber; to operate well in such a capacity, it can be flown at relatively low speeds and in high gust-loading environments, as are typically found over forest fires. It can also be used for other missions types, including passenger services, freight transport, and air-sea search and rescue operations. On 23 October 1967, the first prototype performed its maiden flight, and the first production aircraft was handed over during June 1969. While production of the CL-215 was terminated during 1990, this was due to the imminent introduction of an improved variant of the aircraft, which was designated as the CL-415, the manufacture of which commenced during 1993. Furthermore, numerous conversion and improvement programmes have been developed for existing aircraft, such as the CL-215T, a turbine-powered model of the original aircraft which replaces the original Pratt & Whitney R-2800-83AM radial engines with a pair of Pratt & Whitney Canada PW123AF turbine engines instead. Other changes include the addition of new avionics and various structural improvements. DevelopmentOrigins= The origins of the CL-215 can be traced back to two earlier project studies conducted by Canadian aircraft manufacturer Canadair, the CL-43 and CL-204. The CL-43 was conceived as a logistics aircraft and was based on the design of the Canadian Vickers-built 369 Canso (which was itself a variant of the Consolidated PBY Catalina).\\"Canadair C.L.204.\\" Secretprojects.co.uk. Retrieved: 26 April 2012. Arising from an earlier 1960s research study at the company, the original concept was for a twin-engined floatplane transport, that was altered into a \\"firefighter\\" as a result of a request by forestry officials in the Quebec Service Aérien (Quebec Government Air Service) for a more effective way of delivering water to forest fires. The 1962 preliminary design, designated as the CL-204, was a purpose-designed water bomber that evolved into an amphibian flying boat configuration, powered by two shoulder-mounted Pratt & Whitney R-2800 piston engines. Reportedly, in excess of 1,700 hours of wind tunnel and water tank testing was used to help define the aircraft's basic configuration. This design was shaped by a desire for it to be well-suited for performing a range of roles, including air-sea search and rescue, cargo haulage and commercial passenger-carrying, beyond the water bomber mission.Flight International 1968, pp. 269, 271. The definitive design, which was designated as the CL-215, was publicly revealed at the 1965 Paris Air Show.\\"Canadair CL-215.\\" Flight International, 21 November 1968. p. 871. Aviation publication Flight International observed that the CL-215 was \\"one of the very few entirely new large marine aircraft to be put in hand for some 20 years\\", and that it was the first aircraft to be designed to perform water bombing missions as a primary role.Flight International 1968, p. 269. Developing a newer aircraft meant that, unlike its older competitors, the latest techniques to stave off corrosion could be applied, as well as a fail-safe structure, to give the aircraft a lengthy lifespan. Canadair's market research indicated that there were many aging seaplanes for which operators required a modern replacement. On 1 February 1966, the programme was authorised to proceed. On 23 October 1967, the first prototype performed its maiden flight.Taylor 1976, p. 17. By November 1968, Canadair had decided to commit to an initial production batch of 30 aircraft. During June 1969, the first CL-215 was delivered to the French civil protection agency (Sécurité Civile, then known as Protection Civile). The aircraft, which was one of a batch of ten, had been purchased under a £4 million arrangement; by July 1970, the order had been completed, along with a third of a 15 aircraft order from the government of Quebec.\\"French Water Bombers.\\" Flight International, 16 July 1970. p. 78. Quebec had ordered the type as a replacement for their aging fleet of Canso water bombers; in comparison to the Canso, the CL-215 required a shorter landing distance and was capable of travelling twice as fast.\\"A buyer for the CL-215.\\" Flight International, 9 June 1966. p. 956. =Further development= Head-on view of a Hellenic Air Force CL-215, 2007 Prior to the delivery of the first aircraft, plans had already been mooted for the production of multiple models of the type. While the CL-215A served as the standard water bomber configuration, another model, designated as the CL-215C, had been envisioned to dispense with the design compromises as to better perform the water bomber mission, allowing it be furnished with larger doors on the sides of the fuselage and a revised underfloor hull structure.Flight International 1968, p. 272. Production of the CL-215 progressed through five series. Perhaps the most significant development of the type occurred during the 1980s in the form of the CL-215T, an initiative to replace the original Pratt & Whitney R-2800-83AM radial engines with a pair of Pratt & Whitney Canada PW123AF turbine engines.Goold 1988, p. 23. Speaking during the new model's development, company officials recognised that market demand for the CL-215T was marginal, and thus not enough to justify developing an all-new aircraft. Canadian transport conglomerate Bombardier Aerospace (who had acquired Canadair during the 1980s) decided to terminate production of the type during the late 1980s. Although manufacturing did come to an end in 1990, a further improved model, designated as the CL-415, entered production during 1993. Additionally, multiple conversion and refit programmes have been launched over the following decades to renovate and improve existing aircraft, typically focused on improving aspects such as the engines, avionics and structure. In 2018 Bombardier sold their design documents, and intellectual property rights, to the CL-215 and CL-415 to Viking Air. Viking Air had previously purchased the rights to the Twin Otter, and had subsequently opened a production line to manufacture new Twin Otter airframes. Viking announced plans to open a production line to build the CL-515, an improvement over the CL-415, with more recent avionics, instrumentation to allow it to continue fighting fires at night, and the ability to fill other roles, like maritime surveillance, and maritime search and rescue, when it wasn't fire season. Viking also produced an upgrade kit, the CL-415EAF, which would allow the owners of remaining CL-215 planes to upgrade their engines and avionics to the same level as new CL-515 planes. After being upgraded by Viking Air subsidiaries Longview Aviation Services (LAS) and Cascade Aerospace, the CL-415EAF was first flown from Abbotsford, British Columbia on 12 March 2020, to be delivered in April to Bridger Aerospace. Design undercarriage The Canadair CL-215 is a twin-engine, high-wing general-purpose amphibious aircraft. It features an atypically spacious fuselage for an amphibian, which is designed to accommodate for the operational needs of various roles that the aircraft was developed to perform. The CL-215 can be used as an airborne firefighting platform, in which capacity it is used as a water bomber; it has been claimed to be the first aircraft designed to withstand the severe aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loads imposed by such usage. Beyond the water bomber role, the CL-215 was designed for use in other capacities, such as a search and rescue platform, passenger transport, and freighter; for this purpose, the cabin can be configured in various different ways, including a flexible combi configuration. Under typical operations, these applications would harness the aircraft's ability to land and takeoff from the water, the hull having been designed to enable its use upon the open seas. The CL-215 was designed to perform well in the aerial firefighter role. The apparatus is designed around previously-proven concepts and careful design. The aircraft's belly houses a pair of water tanks of which large downward-facing doors forms their bottoms, these open to rapidly discharge water over a target area. These doors are normally hydraulically actuated and electrically-controlled, but a manual release is present for emergency use only; the tanks can be emptied simultaneously, individually, or in sequence at the pilot's selection. Both tanks are positioned directly upon the aircraft's centre of gravity so that filling or emptying the tanks has minimal impact upon the aircraft's flying characteristics. Water can be rapidly drawn into these water tanks while the aircraft is moving across a body of water's surface via purpose-built rotatable aluminium scoops; if a collision occurred these scoops have been designed to break away from the aircraft without damaging the fuselage. To prevent the tanks from becoming overly-filled, overflow ducts are present at the top of the tanks, which discharge excess water via the sides of the fuselage. The cockpit of a Buffalo Airways CL-215, September 2010 The CL-215 is said to handle well in both the skies and upon the water; significant attention was paid in its design to attaining a high level of manoeuvrability while at low speeds. The hull was laid out with considerable forethought, using the full length of the fuselage as a hull to give the aircraft good handling across many sea states. This hull incorporating a high deadrise angle to reduce impact loads exerted during landings, along with a high step to improve breakaway. Sufficient buoyancy is acquired via multiple watertight bulkheads and a sealed floor attaching directly to the hull frames, two of which serve as attachment points for the wings. Spray compresses are present along the hull's chine, directing spray away from the propellers, engines, and tail unit, while a purpose-built plate diverts spray from the pilot's windshield. The CL-215 is relatively conventional in terms of its aerodynamics, all of the flying controls use traditional surfaces and are manually actuated via mechanical linkages. It is furnished with a high-mounted low-aspect ratio wing, which is equipped with single-slotted flaps. To simplify pilot workload, a constant 15-degree flaps position is used for both low speed and low altitude flight, while the need to adjust the aircraft's trim has been minimised during operations such as water uptake and dropping. Internal view of the \\"bomb door\\" from which water is dropped Both the structure and systems on board the aircraft were reportedly designed to ease manufacture and maintenance. The primary structure is compliant with fail-safe design principles, as well as with attention paid to minimising built-in residual stresses and maximising protection against corrosion; as such, conventional alloys are used throughout, while numerous materials, including magnesium, are excluded to reduce reactivity. For this purpose, Canadair paid heed to requirements previously defined by the United States Navy under MIL-F-7179, having judged these criteria to be optimal for their purposes. All aluminium components that made direct contact with water were sulphurically anodised and sealed used sodium dichromate; other aluminium elements received a chromate coating before the exterior paint was applied while steel was plated with a cadmium-titanium alloy. Contact between dissimilar metals was avoided wherever reasonable to do so, or otherwise insulated from another by four coats of primer. The exterior paint layer consists of wash primer, followed by a coat of epoxy-polyamide primer, and then a final top coat; some areas may received a special synthetic rubber-based sealant coating to prevent moisture ingress.Flight International 1968, p. 270. The CL-215 is powered by a pair of 2,200 hp Pratt & Whitney R-2800-83AM radial engines, which was reliably regarded as a proven and reliable power unit. Flight International describes this choice as being unusual as these engines were no longer in production, a decision that was somewhat justified by the large numbers of reconditioned units that were available during the 1960s; it was believed that a piston engine would be more durable in a maritime environment.Flight International 1968, pp. 269–270. In a standard configuration, fuel is housed across 12 tanks within the wing, although additional tanks can be installed within the outer wing. Deicing measures protect the engine's carburettors, which involves drawing heated air from the engine cylinders over them instead of ambient air; the propellers can also be fitted with electrical heating mats, while these are provisioned for, they were not fitted as standard. Each engine drives a pump for the hydraulic system, which is used to actuate the engine cowl and wing flaps, the wheel brakes, water drop doors and pick-up probes, as well as for undercarriage retraction; each engine also drives a 28V DC generator which powers the aircraft's electrical systems.Flight International 1968, p. 271. Operational history A CL-215 making a low pass above a body of water Over a period of 21 years beginning in 1969, 125 of these aircraft were built and sold to customers in 11 countries. In 2018, there were reportedly around 165 CL-215 and CL-415s in service across 11 countries. Variants ;CL-215A: Initial version, with Pratt & Whitney R-2800-83AM 18-cylinder air-cooled radial piston engines. Features an internal structure compatible with provisioning water bombing apparatus, which includes a pair of underfloor tanks, belly-mounted doors, and rotating scoops. It was targeted at the water bomber and utility freight market sectors. ;CL-215B: Near-identical to the CL-215A, this model featured minor adaptations made to suit the needs of the search and rescue and commercial freight industry customers. ;CL-215C: Largely identical to the CL-215A, but lacks any provision for the water bomber mission. As such, it features a revised underfloor structure, larger side-mounted doors and more windows in the main cabin area. A maximum of 36 passenger can be accommodated, without making any provision for baggage. ;CL-215T: In 1987, the CL-215T was announced, with improvements in handling brought about by design changes to the wings and empennage, and more powerful Pratt & Whitney turboprop engines. Originally the follow-up CL-215T was to be a simple turboprop-powered development of the CL-215, and Canadair converted two aircraft in 1989 to act as development aircraft. The first of these flew on 8 June 1989. Retrofit kits for CL-215s to the new standard are offered, but Canadair elected not to build new CL-215Ts and instead developed the CL-415. Cascade Aerospace, Canada, offers CL-215 to CL-215T engine retrofits using the Bombardier kit and Pratt & Whitney Canada PW123AF engines.\\"Aerial Fire Control.\\" Cascade Aerospace.

The first of 11 used aircraft purchased to be modified should be delivered to launch customer, Bridger Aerospace, in the first quarter of 2020. They will be strengthened to raise its maximum takeoff weight and have new flight controls, hydraulic and fuel systems. ;CL-515: A relaunched production version, furnished with the CL-415EAF configuration. Viking Aviation has announced plans to hire up to 150 employees to perform those conversions through its dedicated subsidiary, and in May 2018 applied for government support for restarting production of the type.

It was kitten-sized and was one of Australia's largest native rodents. It was nocturnal and lived among trees. It made nests filled with leaves and possibly grass in the limbs of hollow eucalyptus trees. The mother carried her young attached to her teats. In a letter to John Gould, then Governor of South Australia Sir George Grey said that he removed a baby from a teat of its dead mother. The baby clung tightly to Gould's glove. Sydney natives called it 'gnar-ruck' which translates as 'rabbit-biscuit'. It was a problem in the settlers' stores at about 1788. The last specimen was recorded at about 1845, but some were reported in 1856–57 and perhaps in the 1930s. Rats may have spread diseases or competed for food with the white-footed rabbit rat. Cats may have been predators, while the demise of Aboriginal firestick farming, which maintained woodland, may have made the rabbit rat extinct. Joyce and McCann, in Burke & Wills - The Scientific Legacy of the Victorian Exploring Expedition (CSIRO Publishing, 2012) state (p138 et seq) that the animal was seen by Beckler at camp 53 in April 1861, in the vicinity of the Bulloo River system. Additionally, the authors state that the relief party of 1862, which included Howitt, collected a specimen south of Coopers Creek.

Shell description Live channeled whelks for sale in a California seafood market Shells of the channeled whelk typically reach 5 to 8 inches in length. The shell is smooth and subpyriform (generally pear-shaped), with a large body whorl and a straight siphonal canal. Between the whorls there is a wide, deep channel at the suture, and there are often weak knobs at the shoulders of the whorls. Finely sculpted lines begin at the siphonal canal and revolve around the shell surface. The color of the shell is typically a buff gray to light tan. The shell aperture is located on the right side, i.e. the shell of this species is almost always dextral in coiling. Left-handed or sinistral specimens occur rarely. Channeled whelks prefer sandy, shallow, intertidal or subtidal areas, and can be common in these habitats. They tend to be nocturnal and are known to eat clams. One of their predators is the blue crab Callinectes sapidus.Dietl & Alexander, Shell Repair Frequencies in Whelks and Moon Snails from Delaware and Southern New Jersey, Malacologia v. 39 (1998), p.152 Human uses The species is edible.

Couch Ballpark is a collegiate and former minor-league baseball park in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The full-time home of the Wake Forest Demon Deacons baseball team, starting in 2009, it was also previously home of the Winston-Salem entry in the Carolina League (currently the Winston-Salem Dash), a role it played since the park opened in 1956. History The ballpark is located at 401 Deacon Boulevard, directly east of Truist Field at Wake Forest, home of the Wake Forest Demon Deacons football team. It is bounded by Deacon Boulevard to the south (first base), Shorefair Drive to the east (right field), and Truist Field at Wake Forest to the west (third base). West 32nd Street lies to the north (left field) behind a group of buildings and a parking lot. Formerly known as Ernie Shore Field, the park was named for major league pitcher and North Carolina native Ernie Shore, who was a teammate of fellow pitcher Babe Ruth when they played for the Boston Red Sox during the 1910s. After Shore retired as a ballplayer, he served as Forsyth County Sheriff and baseball guru for many years. He helped spearhead the drive for a new ballpark, after the decades-old South Side Park had burned. The effort was successful, and the Winston-Salem Twins, as they were then called, had a new home. Since then, the team has gone through various nicknames and has been known as the Winston-Salem Dash since 2009. The park was also the home field of the Demon Deacons baseball team until they opened Gene Hooks Stadium on campus in 1981. Due to the lack of lights at Gene Hooks Stadium, some early season and necessary night games continued to be played at Ernie Shore Field. Like their now-demolished on-campus ballpark, the extant ballpark was renamed, as Gene Hooks Field at Wake Forest Baseball Park, to honor former Wake Forest athletic director Gene Hooks. With the resurgence of minor league baseball during the 1980s and 1990s, the stadium underwent many renovations to modernize the facility. =Wake Forest ownership= The transfer of the stadium to Wake Forest University began in December 2006, when tentative agreements were put into place to sell the field to the University after a new stadium was constructed in downtown Winston-Salem for the Dash. The sale was completed prior to the 2009 baseball season. The new ballpark's construction experienced various delays. The Dash had hoped to begin the 2009 season at the downtown park, but pushed the date back to mid-season. Wake Forest University accommodated the Dash for as much of the 2009 season as necessary. On June 2, the club announced the opening of the new ballpark for the 2010 season, allowing Wake Forest complete control of Wake Forest Baseball Park. In February 2016, Wake Forest Baseball Park was named David F. Couch Ballpark in honor of former baseball player David Couch ('84). A longtime supporter of Wake Forest athletics and the baseball program, Couch made the lead gift toward the new $14 million Player Development Center, which opened in February 2017. Along the third-base line, the facility includes a team locker room, lounge, training room, equipment room, a full kitchen, professional players locker space, also including renovation and relocation of the home dugout and bullpen and construction of a pitching laboratory, complete with 18 high-speed cameras designed to analyze the biomechanics of each player. Future additions will include a video conference room, team meeting room, coaches offices, a Wake Forest baseball heritage area and an indoor batting facility. =In popular culture= The ballpark was used for some key scenes in the 1990 movie Mr. Destiny starring James Belushi and Linda Hamilton. In the movie, Belushi's character travels back in time to \\"try again\\" in a life-altering high school baseball game.

The lack of clouds along the coast (and also along the Central Valley of California) is due to an offshore wind blowing drier air from the land offshore. The California Current is a Pacific Ocean current that moves southward along the western coast of North America, beginning off southern British Columbia and ending off southern Baja California Sur. It is considered an Eastern boundary current due to the influence of the North American coastline on its course. It is also one of five major coastal currents affiliated with strong upwelling zones, the others being the Humboldt Current, the Canary Current, the Benguela Current, and the Somali Current. The California Current is part of the North Pacific Gyre, a large swirling current that occupies the northern basin of the Pacific. Physical properties The movement of Alaskan and northern ocean currents southward down the west coast results in much cooler ocean temperatures than at comparable latitudes on the east coast of the United States, where ocean currents come from the Caribbean and tropical Atlantic. The cooler ocean current along the west coast also makes summer temperatures cooler on the west coast compared to the east coast. For example, Half Moon Bay at 37°N has no month with an average high above and San Francisco often stays below in summer, while Virginia Beach, VA, close to the same latitude, has six months when high temperatures are above . Additionally, extensive upwelling of colder sub-surface waters occurs, caused by the prevailing northwesterly winds acting through the Ekman Effect. The winds drive surface water to the right of the wind flow, that is offshore, which draws water up from below to replace it. The upwelling further cools the already cool California Current. This is the mechanism that produces California's characteristic coastal fog and cool ocean waters. As a result, ocean surf temperatures are much colder along the Pacific coast than the Atlantic coast. For example, the average July SST (sea surface temperature) at New York City at 40.7°N is , while at the same latitude in Eureka, CA is . As such, ocean surf temperatures are rarely above during the summer along the California coast south to San Diego, while they are often above on the east coast from North Carolina southward. The cold water is highly productive due to the upwelling, which brings to the surface nutrient- rich sediments, supporting large populations of whales, seabirds and important fisheries. Winds of the appropriate direction and strength to induce upwelling are more prevalent in the presence of Eastern boundary currents, such as the California Current. Phytoplankton production is dramatically increased in these areas because the nutrient-rich water lying below the pycnocline is relatively close to the surface and is thus easily upwelled. Scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography said in 2011 that the average surface temperature of the water at Scripps Pier has increased by almost 3 degrees since 1950. The \\"Bakun upwelling index\\" is based on a 20-year average of the monthly mean Ekman transport for different regions off the California coast. It ranges from 300 meters-cubed/second (in the offshore direction) to −212 meters-cubed/second (toward the coast, or onshore direction). There is year- round upwelling off Southern California's coast, but it is strongest in the summer months. Off the coast of Oregon and Washington, there is forceful downwelling in the winter months, and upwelling in the region is restricted to the months of April through September.  Biological properties  Primary production is a topic of interest among those who study the California Current. In their study, Hayward and Venrick (1982) found great variability in both biomass and the productivity of phytoplankton in the California Current. The differences observed by Hayward and Venrick in carbon-fixation rates (0.2–2.0 grams carbon/(meter-squared × day)) show the heterogeneous nature of the California Current, with its combination of advected (see advection) and upwelled water. Several studies have investigated the carbon flow from primary production to the pelagic fish stocks which depend on the California Current. Lasker (1988) described powerful \\"jets and squirts\\" off northern and central California. These 'jets and squirts' move large quantities of cold, nutrient rich water offshore. This water then gets carried by the southward bound California Current and adds significant primary production to the sardine population.  Related currents  A narrower, weaker counter current, the Davidson Current, occasionally moves somewhat warmer water northwards during the winter months. During El Niño events, the California Current is disrupted, leading to declines in phytoplankton, resulting in cascading effects up the food chain, such as declines in fisheries, seabird breeding failures and marine mammal mortality (Schwing et al., 2003). In 2005, a failure in the otherwise predictable upwelling events, unassociated with El Niño, caused a collapse in krill in the current, leading to similar effects (Schwing et al., 2003). Within the Southern California Bight, a sub-region of the California Current has unique physical properties. Upwelling is fairly weak in the California Bight and Smith and Eppley (1982) stated that the 16-year average for primary production was 0.402 grams carbon/(meter-squared × day), or approximately 150 grams carbon/(meter-squared × year). Further, Smith and Eppley (1982) found that the highest daily rates of temperature decrease were correlated with the maximum amount of upwelling. Digiacomo and Holt (2001) used satellite images to study the mesoscale and sub-mesoscale eddies in the Southern California Bight. Their work showed that all eddies were less than in diameter and 70% of all eddies measured less than . The eddies appeared to be caused mostly by topography (particularly islands), wind, and instabilities in the current. The location of these eddies was mainly between the California Current (flowing toward the equator) and the coastline. The majority of these eddies were cyclonic and had the ability to induce the upwelling of nutrient- rich water. Small scale topographic features such as headlands have been shown to cause substantial effects on the population dynamics of benthic invertebrates, such a change in the settlement patterns of crabs and sea urchin. In popular culture In the 2016 Disney/Pixar animated film Finding Dory, the California Current is portrayed as a superhighway that fish and sea turtles use to travel to California. The characters Marlin (Albert Brooks), Nemo (Hayden Rolence), and Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) join Crush (Andrew Stanton), Squirt (Bennett Dammannn) and a group of baby and adult sea turtles in using the California Current, to help them travel to Morro Bay, California to find her parents Jenny and Charlie.

The couple moved to New York City. She then attended the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and graduated with a master's degree in journalism. Broadcasting career As Donna Hanover she began to work in a series of television journalism positions around the country, starting with a stint at WKTV in Utica, New York in 1973, where she was also an associate faculty member at Utica College. She then went to WTVN-TV in Columbus, Ohio.Elisabeth Bumiller, \\" Clash of Careers For First Lady; Donna Hanover's 2 roles are not always separate\\", The New York Times, December 1, 1995.

They were divorced sometime after October 1980;According to Barrett, \\"The Hanovers have declined in numerous interviews to say where and when they divorced.\\" they had no children. By 1980, Hanover had moved to Miami, Florida; it was when she was working as an anchor at Miami's WSVN that she met Giuliani. The couple moved in together in 1982 while Giuliani was still married to his first wife, but they had been separated since 1976. Giuliani had his first marriage annulled in late 1983. They then later moved to Washington, D.C. and then New York, and were married there on April 15, 1984. Hanover began working for WPIX Channel 11 television in New York in 1983,\\"Donna Hanover: Biography\\" , Food Network. Accessed December 4, 2007. and was the lead anchor for its 10 p.m. newscast for much of the 1980s. She also appeared on the syndicated Wall Street Journal Report. She left her anchor role during Giuliani's unsuccessful 1989 bid for mayor to go on maternity leave. Hanover had two children with Giuliani, Andrew Harold (born 1986) and Caroline Rose (born 1989). She began to use Donna Hanover Giuliani as her name in some contexts, but still used Donna Hanover in others. She left WPIX entirely in 1990, and did some freelance work for New York's WNYW Channel 5 in 1992 and 1993. First Lady of New York City In 1993 she actively campaigned for her husband during his successful campaign for Mayor, appearing in his television ads as a devoted wife and mother. In 1994, she became First Lady of New York City. In this role, she promoted various health and educational causes around the city and was active in the city's civic life. She had a staff of four and an office at Gracie Mansion, but had no involvement in determining the mayor's policies.Beth DeFalco; Yoav Gonen, \\"De Blasio's wife wants office, role at City Hall\\", New York Post, January 18, 2014. In addition to her duties as first lady, she was a features reporter for local station WNYW Channel 5's morning Good Day New York show, rotating anchor of WNYW's Good Day Sunday program, and a co-anchor on the national cable Food Network's Food News and Views program. She balanced these positions with her political and mother roles by eschewing some of the production work she had done in the past. In addition, she worked from time to time as a radio disc jockey for New York's WYNY. The dual, concurrent roles as a journalist and political wife led to discussions of a possible conflict of interest, but even Giuliani political opponents such as Peter Vallone, Sr. respected her professionalism. Hanover branched out into acting, having a prominent role as real-life presidential sister Ruth Carter Stapleton in the 1996 film The People vs. Larry Flynt; noted critic Frank Rich called her performance brilliant. She also appeared in the feature film Ransom that same year as a WNYW reporter. By 1996, she had reverted to only using Donna Hanover as her name and her public appearances with Rudy Giuliani became few.Margaret Carlson, \\"In Rudy's Playground\\", Time, July 11, 1999.

Biography Jackson was born in Salisbury, Maryland, and attended the public schools of Wicomico County, Maryland and the Wilmington Conference Academy of Dover, Delaware. He engaged in the lumber business in 1887. Jackson became a member of the Republican National Committee in 1908, and was appointed to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Senator Isidor Rayner in 1912. While senator, Jackson served as chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of State (Sixty-second Congress). A special election was called in 1913 to choose Rayner's successor, but Jackson chose not to become a candidate. He served from November 29, 1912, until January 28, 1914, when an elected successor, Blair Lee I, officially qualified for the position.

It was slightly smaller than a black rat, and quite social, living in small family groups that sheltered by day in a nest of soft, dry grass in a burrow. It usually dug burrows at a depth of 15 cm under bushes. Gould's mouse was common and widespread before European settlement, but disappeared rapidly after the 1840s, perhaps being exterminated by cats. Alternatively, it may have been out-competed by the introduced rats and mice, succumbed to introduced diseases or been affected by grazing stock and changed fire regimes. Despite extensive survey work in its known range, the last specimens were collected in 1856-57, and it is presumed to be extinct. There is some speculation that this species was in fact an eastern population of the Shark Bay mouse (Pseudomys fieldi).

It was designed by Benno von Arent. Adolf Hitler awarded the first such order posthumously to Reichsminister Fritz Todt during Todt's funeral in February 1942. A second posthumous award of the German Order was given to SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich at his funeral in June that year. Cynics called the award the \\"dead hero order\\" as it was almost always awarded posthumously. The only two recipients who received the German Order and survived the war were Konstantin Hierl and Artur Axmann.  Description  The black enamel cross in the middle section of the award resembled that of the Iron Cross and the medal also had similarities in design to the Order of the German Eagle. It measured 48.5 mm across the arms of the cross. At the centre was a medallion, which measured 20.5 mm. In-between the arms of the cross were national eagles with furled wings. Each one of the four eagles with a wreath clutched in its claws. At the center of the medal is the Golden Party Badge. The concept of the order was based of the ceremonial regalia of the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, the Marian Cross of the Teutonic Order, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and of the cross of the Knight of Justice of the Order of St. John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg). The German Order was originally to be awarded in three grades, but only the neck order (the highest grade) was ever awarded. This award is considered the second rarest award of Nazi Germany after the National Prize for Art and Science. The holders of this award were supposed to form a confraternity. Adolf Hitler regarded this award as his personal decoration to be bestowed only upon those whose services to the state, party, and the people, he deemed worthy. For this reason, plus the fact that the reverse of the medal bears a facsimile of his signature, it was also informally known as the 'Hitler Order'. There were eleven confirmed recipients of this award between 1942 and 1945. * Fritz Todt (posthumous), 11 February 1942 * Reinhard Heydrich (posthumous), 9 June 1942 * Adolf Hühnlein (posthumous), 22 June 1942 * Viktor Lutze (posthumous), 7 May 1943 * Adolf Wagner (posthumous), 17 April 1944 * Josef Bürckel (posthumous), 3 October 1944 * Rudolf Schmundt (posthumous), 7 October 1944 * Konstantin Hierl, 24 February 1945 * Karl Hanke (killed during a POW escape attempt at a transport on 8 June 1945), 12 April 1945 * Karl Holz (killed in action on 20 April 1945), 19 April 1945 * Artur Axmann, 28 April 1945  Notes  References  * * Category:Orders, decorations, and medals of Nazi Germany ","title":"German Order (distinction)"},{"id":"1620654","text":"The North American A-36 Apache (listed in some sources as \\"Invader\\", but also called Mustang) was the ground-attack/dive bomber version of the North American P-51 Mustang, from which it could be distinguished by the presence of rectangular, slatted dive brakes above and below the wings. A total of 500 A-36 dive bombers served in the Mediterranean and Southeast Asia theaters during World War II before being withdrawn from operational use in 1944. Design and development With the introduction of the North American Mustang Mk.I with the Royal Air Force's Army Co-operation Squadrons in February 1942, the new fighter began combat missions as a low-altitude reconnaissance and ground-support aircraft. Supplementing the Curtiss P-40 Tomahawks already in service, Mustang Mk Is were first supplied to No. 26 Squadron RAF, then rapidly deployed to 10 additional squadrons by June 1942. First used in combat over the Dieppe Raid on 19 August 1942, a Mustang of No. 414 (RCAF) Squadron downed one of the formidable Focke-Wulf Fw 190s, the first victory for a Mustang.Hess 1970, p. 5. Despite the limited high-altitude performance of the Allison V-1710 engine, the RAF was enthusiastic about its new mount, which \\"performed magnificently\\".Hess 1970, p. 12. Sole RAF A-36A EW998, showing the slatted dive brakes and carrying American 500lb (226kg) bombs on the racks beneath the wings During the Mustang Mk. I's successful combat initiation, North American's president Howard \\"Dutch\\" Kindelberger pressed the newly redesignated U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) for a fighter contract for the essentially similar P-51, 93 of which had passed into the USAAF when the Lend- Lease contract with Britain ran out of funds. The Mustang Mk IA/P-51 used four 20 mm Hispano wing cannon in place of the original armament, a combination of four wing-mounted .30 caliber (7.62 mm) M1919 Browning machine guns and four .50 caliber (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns, two of which were mounted in the wings, while the second pair was mounted in the \\"chin\\", or lower engine cowling, and synchronized to fire through the propeller. No funds were available for new fighter contracts in fiscal year 1942, but General Oliver P. Echols and Fighter Project Officer Benjamin S. Kelsey\\"P-51 History: Mustang Mk I.\\" The Gathering of Mustangs & Legends, 26 March 2009. Retrieved: 13 June 2010. wanted to ensure that the P-51 remained in production.Mizrahi 1995, pp. 49–50. Since appropriations were available for an attack aircraft, Echols specified modifications to the P-51 to turn it into a dive bomber. The contract for 500 A-36A aircraft fitted with bomb racks, dive brakes, and heavier-duty wing, was signed by Kelsey on 16 April 1942, even before the first flight of the first production P-51 in May 1942.Mizrahi 1995, p. 49. With orders on the books, North American Aviation (NAA) began modifying the P-51 to accept the bomb shackles which had already been tested in a \\"long- range ferry\\" program that the RAF had stipulated.Grunehagen 1969, p. 60. Engineering studies totaling 40,000 hours and wind tunnel testing with a ⅛-scale model were completed in June 1942.

Due to the slightly inboard placement of the bomb racks and unique installation of four cast aluminum dive brakes, a complete redesign of the P-51 wing was required.Gruenhagen 1969, p. 61. A-36A production line at NAA Inglewood, October 1942. The first A-36A (42-83663) was rolled out of the NAA Inglewood plant in September 1942, rapidly going through flight testing with the first flight in October, with deliveries commencing soon after of the first production machines. The A-36A continued the use of nose-mounted .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns along with wing armament of four .50 in (12.7 mm) caliber machine guns. The USAAF envisaged that the dive bomber would operate mainly at altitudes below 12,000 ft (3,658 m) and specified the use of a sea level-rated Allison V-1710-87, driving a 10 ft 9 in (3.28 m)-diameter three bladed Curtiss-Electric propeller and delivering 1,325 hp (988 kW) at 3,000 ft (914 m).Kinzey 1996, p. 22. The main air scoop inlet was redesigned to become a fixed unit with a larger opening, replacing the earlier scoop which could be lowered into the airstream. In addition the A-36 carburetor air intake was later fitted with a tropical air filter to stop sand and grit being ingested into the engine.Gruenhagen 1969, p. 61.Gruenhagan 1969, pp. 42, 62, 66, 178. The USAAF later ordered 310 P-51As, which were essentially A-36s without the dive-brakes and nose-mounted weapons, leaving an armament of four wing-mounted 0.50 in (12.7 mm) Browning machine guns.Kinzey 1996, p. 41. An Allison V-1710-81 1,200 hp (895 kW) was fitted and used the same radiator and air intake as the A-36A. The P-51A was still fitted with bomb racks although it was not intended to be used primarily as a fighter- bomber and the racks were mainly used to carry drop tanks.Taylor 1969, p. 537.

The A-36A-1-NA \\"Apache\\" (although Apache was the A-36A's official name, it was rarely used)Gunston and Dorr 1995, p. 68. joined the 27th Fighter-Bomber Group (27th FBG) composed of four squadrons based at Ras el Ma Airfield in French Morocco in April 1943 during the campaign in North Africa. The 27th had a mixed component of Douglas A-20 Havocs and A-36As while the second operational unit, the 86th Fighter Bomber Group (Dive) arrived in March 1943 with the first pilots trained and qualified on the A-36A.\\"WW II History of 86 FG.\\" 86fighterbombergroup.com. Retrieved: 24 June 2008. On 6 June 1943, both of these A-36A units flew combat missions directed against the island of Pantelleria. The island fell to Allied attack and became the home base for the two A-36A groups during the Allied invasion of Sicily. The A-36A proved to be a potent weapon: it could be put into a vertical dive at 12,000 ft (3,658 m) with deployed dive brakes, thus limiting the dive speed to 390 mph (628 km/h) (\\"A36A-1 Flight Manual requires deployment before starting a dive\\"). Pilots soon recognized that extending the dive brakes after \\"peel-off\\" led to some unequal extension of the brakes due to varying hydraulic pressure, setting up an invariable slight roll, which impeded aiming. Proper technique soon cured this anomaly and, subsequently, pilots achieved extremely consistent results. Depending on the target and defenses, the bomb release took place between 2,000 ft and 4,000 ft (610 and 1,219 m), followed by an immediate sharp \\"pull up.\\" Dive brakes in the wings gave the A-36A greater stability in a dive; however, a myth has arisen that they were useless due to malfunctions or because of the danger of deploying them and that they should be wired closed.Hess 1970, p. 13. Capt. Charles E. Dills, 522d Fighter Squadron, 27th FBG, XIIth Air Force emphatically stated in a postwar interview: \\"I flew the A-36 for 39 of my 94 missions, from 11/43 to 3/44.

Retrieved: 24 June 2008. However, tactical reconnaissance training with P-51 and A-36 aircraft had delivered some disquieting accident rates. At one time, A-36 training had resulted in the type having \\"the highest accident rate per hour's flying time\\"Freeman 1974, pp. 44–45. of any USAAF aircraft. The most serious incident involved an A-36A shedding both wings when its pilot tried to pull out from a 450 mph (724 km/h) dive. Combat units flying the A-36A were ordered to restrict their approach to a 70° \\"glide\\" attack and refrain from using dive brakes.Grinsell 1984, p. 69. This order was generally ignored by experienced pilots, but some units did wire dive brakes shut until modifications made to the hydraulic actuators. Nevertheless, the A-36 was used with great success as a dive-bomber, acquiring a reputation for precision, sturdiness and silence.Hess 1970, p. 14. By late May 1943, 300 A-36As had been deployed to the Mediterranean Theater, with many of the first batch sent to the 27th FBG to re-build the group following losses as well as completing the final transition to an all-A-36A unit. Both groups were actively involved in air support during the Sicilian campaign, becoming especially adept at \\"mopping up\\" enemy gun positions and other strong points as the Allies advanced. During this operation, the 27th FBG circulated a petition to adopt the name \\"Invader\\" for their rugged little bomber, receiving unofficial recognition of the more fitting name. Despite the name change, most combat reports preferred the name \\"Mustang\\" for all of the variants.Gruenhagen 1969, p. 62. Author William Hess claims that the Germans gave it a flattering, if fearsome, accolade, calling the A-36As: \\"screaming helldivers.\\" Besides dive bombing, the A-36A racked up aerial victories, totaling 84 enemy aircraft downed and creating an \\"ace\\", Lieutenant Michael T. Russo from the 27th FBG (ultimately, the only ace using the Allison-engined Mustang). As fighting intensified in all theaters where the A-36A operated, the dive bomber began to suffer an alarming loss rate with 177 falling to enemy action. The main reason for the attrition was the hazardous missions that placed the A-36A \\"on the deck\\" facing murderous ground fire. German defenses in southern Italy included placing cables across hill tops to snare the attacking A-36As.Gruenhagen 1969, p. 63. Despite establishing a reputation for reliability and performance, the one \\"Achilles' heel\\" of the A-36A (and the entire Mustang series) remained its ventral-fuselage location radiator/cooling system, leading to many of the losses.Hess 1970, p. 18. By June 1944, A-36As in Europe were replaced by Curtiss P-40s and Republic P-47 Thunderbolts.Gruenhagen 1969, p. 61. In the Mediterranean the A36A was also used brieffly by the Royal Air Force 1437th Strategic Reconnaissance Flight, in Foggia, Italy. Although the RAF did not procure factory new A36's, the 1437th Flight loaned from the USAAF to replace their previous Baltimore's. These aircraft were not only painted with RAF roundels and individual aircraft letters, but also with RAF serial numbers thus: 42-14807 became HK947/A, 42-83898 became HK4945/B, 42-84018 became HK944/C, 42-83906 became HK955/D, 42-83829 became HK955/D, 42-83829 became HK956/E and 42-84117 became HK946/F. These Royal Air Force had their aircraft chin .50 Browning guns removed. A-36As also served with the 311th Fighter Bomber Group in the China-Burma-India theater. The 311th had arrived in Dinjan, India by late summer 1943 after being shipped across the Pacific via Australia.Spick 1997, p. 225. Two squadrons were equipped with the A-36A while the third flew P-51As. Tasked with reconnaissance, dive bombing, attack and fighter missions, the A-36A was outclassed by its main opposition, the Nakajima Ki-43 \\"Oscar.\\" The light and highly agile Japanese fighter could outmaneuver the A-36A at all altitudes but did have some weak points: it was lightly armed and offered little protection for pilot or fuel tanks. However, the A-36A fought at a significant disadvantage, having to carry out long-range missions often at altitudes above The Hump that meant its Allison engine was below peak performance. In a fighter escort mission over Burma, three A-36As were lost without scoring a single victory. The A-36A CBI missions continued throughout 1943–1944 with indifferent results. The A-36A remained in service in small numbers throughout the remaining year of the war, some being retained in the US as training aircraft. \\"The type's relatively brief service life should not camouflage the fact that it made a major contribution to the Allied war effort\\" especially in the Mediterranean and it amounted to the first USAAF combat use of a Mustang variant. The effectiveness of the A-36 as a ground attack aircraft was demonstrated on 5 June 1944. In a well-planned attack on the large, well defended rail depot and ammunition dump at Orte, Italy, Lieutenant Ross C. Watson led a flight of four A-36s through a heavy overcast on the approach to the target. Watson's A-36s scored several hits under intense anti-aircraft fire although his aircraft was damaged by ground fire. Under continuing heavy ground fire, Watson pressed home his attack and destroyed the ammunition dump before making an emergency landing at an advanced Allied airfield.

The Salesianum swimming team has won ten consecutive state boys' championships between 2005 and 2015 and 11 of the last 12 from 2005-2017 Original location - 8th & West Streets Front entrance History Salesianum (Latin for \\"House of Sales\\", referring to St. Francis de Sales) was founded in 1903 and was located at 8th and West Streets until the move to its current location in 1957. In 1950, Rev. Thomas Lawless, OSFS, a 1908 graduate of Salesianum, admitted five African American students four years prior to the Brown v. Board of Education decision which made it mandatory, thus making Salesianum the first racially integrated school in the state of Delaware. The school was recognized for this with a historical marker. In August 2012 the Wilmington/Philadelphia Province of the Oblates of St. Francis de Sales published a letter stating, \\"Since 2004, the Wilmington/Philadelphia Province of the Oblates of St. Francis de Sales has been named in lawsuits in the Superior Court of Delaware filed by 40 plaintiffs, each of which contained allegations of sexual abuse of a minor.\\" The letter named 12 oblates who had been involved and expressed regrets, stating, \\"The abuse of children by priests and other clergy is shocking, reprehensible, and devastating to all whose trust has been shattered by their selfish deeds.\\" This followed a settlement in August 2011 of 39 lawsuits against the school and the order, with the order and its insurers paying $24.8 million to be shared between the plaintiffs.

Erickson and illustrated by Gerald L. Holmes. The books follow Hank, a dog that views himself as the \\"Head of Ranch Security\\". In each book Hank and other characters must deal with several events, issues and mysteries that occur at their Texas Panhandle home in Ochiltree County. The name of the ranch is never mentioned in any of the stories. The series began in 1982, with a couple of short stories about Hank and his friends; since then, over 70 printed books and seven audio-only books have been published. Hank the Cowdog was previously published via Maverick Books, with Puffin Books holding the current American publishing rights in English. Each book features songs that Erickson performs on the audiobook editions. The series has received awards and critical acclaim, and the books have sold more than eight million copies worldwide. It has been published in several languages including Spanish, Danish, Persian, and Chinese. In the 1980s, the first book was adapted into an animated segment for CBS Storybreak. Teaching programs are available for the series via Maverick Books and a story entitled The Case of the Dancing Cowboy was serialized in 2002, in several American newspapers. Characters Hank: Hank is the main character and narrator of each story in the Hank the Cowdog adventures. Hank is the only character to appear in every single story in the series. Hank claims to be a \\"purebred top-of-the-line blue-ribbon cowdog\\", and that may in fact be true. According to the official Hank The Cowdog Website, Hank is based on a real Australian Shepherd named \\"Hank\\". He styles himself as the \\"Head of Ranch Security\\" and conducts security sweeps and nightly patrols. However his real task is to serve as the assistant to Slim and Loper in herding cattle. Hank has a superiority complex which causes him to have an inflated sense of his own intelligence, strength, courage and attractiveness. As a result of this, Hank frequently finds himself in sticky situations, usually of his own creation. Much of the humor of the series comes from Hank as narrator shamelessly attempting to make himself seem more competent with hindsight than he really was, but the reader is rarely fooled. Despite his flaws Hank is deeply loyal to his family and the ranch community and usually rises to the occasion at the moment of true crisis. The dog is based on an Australian Shepherd named Hank that was owned by a neighbor of Erickson's when he was managing a ranch in Oklahoma. The neighbor wanted to use the dog to help with the cattle but the dog was not trained and proved a hassle. Drover: Drover is a younger dog who lives on the ranch with Hank as his best friend. Hank refers to him as his assistant, or as a \\"little mutt\\" when Hank is angry with him. Unlike Hank, Drover has no delusions of grandeur and enjoys spending most his time staying out of trouble and sleeping (16 hours a day according to Hank), often engaging in useless tasks he invents for himself. In The Case of the Car-Barkaholic Dog, for example, Hank observes that while he is helping the cowboys with the cattle herding, Drover spends the afternoon chewing on an old horn, buries it, and then promptly forgets where it is buried. He is also unashamedly timid, and frequently avoids \\"the call of duty\\" by pretending to have a bad leg. Drover has a great deal of curiosity and often asks Hank obscure questions such as \\"Why does the moon rise in the evening and set in the morning?\\" Hank rarely knows the answer to these questions, but this doesn't stop him from providing ones. Drover often appears to have more common sense than Hank, which allows him to avoid getting into many of the same catastrophes Hank creates for himself. Drover appears in every story in the series, with the exception of A1: The Homeless Pooch. Sally May: Sally May is the wife of High Loper and the mother of Little Alfred and Baby Molly. She is a housewife who enjoys parties and often serves as a civilizing check on her cowboy husband. She is often high-strung, particularly in \\"The Case of the Killer Stud Horse\\" and \\"The Phantom in the Mirror\\", when she has company coming over. Pete the Barn Cat is her favorite pet and she is affectionate towards both him and Drover. She dislikes Hank, however, and frequently gets angry at him for coming into her yard, her house or fighting with Pete. Her most common response when angered is to try to hit him with her broom. Despite this Hank often seems to think that Sally May secretly respects him. In reality, her feelings fluctuate between disgust and temporary respect as Hank usually follows up his shenanigans with an act of heroism. High Loper: Owner of the ranch, High Loper (his last name is never given) is an old-fashioned cowboy who enjoys roping, riding and working his ranch. While Loper never wants to leave the ranch and is loath to go out of town, he is far from a workaholic, settling for shoddy workmanship on many of his projects and pawning the dirty work onto his ranch hand, Slim Chance. His more anti-social cowboy instincts have been tamed by his wife, who he loves. However, in some episodes he expresses nostalgia for the times when he was just a simple cowboy. In \\"Murder in the Middle Pasture\\" when Sally May is giving Slim a lecture on how he will understand the importance of social events when he is married, Loper mouths the words \\"no you won't\\" behind her back. While Loper makes fun of Hank frequently and is often angry at him, he also relies on Hank to help with the cattle herding. In \\"Every Dog Has His Day\\" Hank saves Loper from some quicksand, proving his loyalty to his master. Little Alfred: Loper and Sally May's older child. Little Alfred (middle name Leroy) likes Hank and often participates in adventures with him. Some of these are harmless, though in \\"The Case of the Hooking Bull\\" Alfred deliberately tricks Hank into going into the dryer and then turning the machine on, showing he has a mischievous streak. Most of the story \\"Lost in the Dark Unchanted Forest\\" revolves around Hank's search for Alfred when he goes missing in the woods. In this story and a few others Alfred is shown to have the ability to talk to animals, although in later stories he does not appear to have this ability. It is revealed that the older a child gets, the more their ability to understand animals diminishes. Hank is very protective of Alfred and frequently risks his life to protect him, labeling it every cowdog's duty. Alfred first appears in book #2, The Further Adventures of Hank the Cowdog, though he is referred to at that time only as \\"the baby.\\" Pete the Barn Cat: Hank's primary antagonist on the ranch. Pete is Sally May's favorite pet and he frequently uses this to his advantage in his petty clashes with Hank. Pete is much more clever than Hank and usually manages to outwit him, although Hank usually perceives the events differently. Many of Hank's adventures are initiated by an embarrassing incident where he has been tricked by Pete. In \\"The Further Adventures of Hank the Cowdog\\", Hank's eyes go crossed after staring at a bloody nose he received by attacking a fried egg Pete obtained that was just behind Sally May's garden fence. In \\"The Curse of the Incredible Priceless Corncob\\", the entire story revolves around Hank's over-protectiveness towards a corncob Pete has tricked him into believing is worth a fortune. In \\"The Case of the Missing Cat\\" Hank eventually loses patience with Pete and tries to strand him on the plains, but has a change of heart and rescues him from the coyotes Rip and Snort. The two then lament the fact that by saving Pete's life Hank and Pete must be friends and stop fighting each other. At the end of the adventure, however, the two return to fighting over scraps, suggesting that they both secretly like their antagonistic relationship. Pete is also referred to as \\"Pete The Cow Cat\\" in the book \\"The Case Of The Perfect Dog\\", where Pete wanted to replace Hank as top dog. Slim Chance: A lazy but loyal cowboy and ranch hand that works for High Loper. It is unclear how long Slim has worked at the ranch, but despite several comments made about wanting to move to a bigger operation, he has never quit.In \\"Slim's Good-Bye,\\" Slim does leave the ranch due to perceived financial concerns, but changes his mind after Loper tells him that their financial troubles are not as dire as he originally thought. He does most of the work on the ranch that Loper does not want, and occasionally gets forced into babysitting Little Alfred, for whom he has an affinity. Slim lives in a rundown shack two miles from ranch headquarters, and maintains a filthy house, frequently leaving old dishes, clothes, food, and livestock magazines lying around and fostering a chronic rodent problem. He also hates cooking, which results in him maintaining a horrible diet and eating things that would disgust the average reader, like sardine and ketchup sandwiches and boiled turkey necks. Slim loves pranks including placing a smoke bomb in the town's volunteer fire department truck and tricking Loper into believing there was a fire causing him to start the truck and set it off. Although Slim loves to play pranks on Hank and poke fun at him, it is clear he has an affinity for both him and Drover, frequently asking them to come along with him on odd jobs. The first audio-only book, The Homeless Pooch, establishes that Slim is Hank's owner; however, in other books in the series Hank and Drover are said to be Loper's dogs, or even Alfred's. Wallace and Junior: Two buzzards that Hank sometimes encounters. Wallace, an old buzzard and father to Junior, is very harsh and abrasive, not easily getting along with most of the other characters of the series. He is also relatively single-minded, judging most things mainly on their usefulness as a food source. He doesn't seem to like Hank much, but sometimes acts decently towards him. Junior, Wallace's slow and clumsy son, is more timid than his father. He also has a stutter. He loves his father but often makes Wallace angry by being cowardly, being friendly towards other animals (who Wallace says they should rather think about eating), and generally being bad at being a buzzard. Wallace also loathes Junior's love of singing. Rip and Snort: Two coyote brothers who have a grudge against Hank. At one point in The Original Adventures of Hank the Cowdog however, Hank, Rip, and Snort became friends. However, they are enemies in most of other books. They are vicious and strong, but not very smart, and Hank manages to escape from sticky situations involving them by tricking them. They call Hank \\"Hunk.\\" Scraunch: A vicious coyote near the top of the pack's pecking order, he maintains an intense hatred of Hank. He is the brother of Missy Coyote, to which Hank was once promised in marriage. He is smarter, tougher, and more grumpy than Rip and Snort. Missy Coyote: A coyote who was at one point promised to be Hank's mate, and thus join her family pack if Hank attacked the ranch and killed Drover. Hank ultimately refused to do so, showing that he is loyal to the ranch inhabitants, and loyal to Drover as a good friend. Hank seems to share Missy's feelings and though he doesn't like coyotes it seemed that at one point he seriously considered joining Missy's pack. Missy was originally named, \\"Girl-Who-Drink-Blood\\", but Hank disliked the name, instead calling her Missy Coyote. Unlike most of Hank's crushes, Missy actually considers him cute. Beulah: A collie who resides on a local ranch, and with whom Hank is madly in love. He is constantly trying to impress her, which usually results in his making a fool of himself instead. Beulah lives on her ranch with her boyfriend Plato, a bird dog whom Hank despises. Although she likes Hank as a friend, she does not return his love, and tries to let him down easy for fear of hurting his feelings. Despite this, Hank continues to be convinced Beulah is in love with him, and would express it if it weren't for Plato. Plato: A polite bird dog who likes Hank despite Hank's obvious disdain for him. He is in love with Beulah, much to Hank's consternation, and seems not to notice or care that Hank is constantly trying to court her. He also seems to be oblivious to Hank's malice towards him. He has only very minor roles, except in The Case of the Missing Bird Dog and The Quest for the Great White Quail, in which he got lost and Hank had to find him. Madame Moonshine: A \\"witchy little burrowing owl\\" who assists Hank on occasion. She often refers to Hank as \\"Hank the Rabbit,\\" and she has a bodyguard, a rattlesnake named Timothy. When she does use her magic, it normally is very odd and may not have the desired results. For example, in Lost in the Dark Unchanted Forest, she and Hank were tied upside-down to a tree branch, while Rip and Snort were planning to eat them below. She recited a spell to make them stop, but, because they were upside-down, it just made them sing their song backwards. Dog Pound Ralph: A basset hound who lives in the local dog pound. His owner, Jimmy Joe, works at the pound and just puts him in whichever kennel is currently available. He has a fairly uneventful life, except when his owner lets him out as happens in The Fling. Ralph was introduced in the book \\"The Case of the Night-Stalking Bone Monster\\". Eddy the Rac: A raccoon who occasionally shows up and causes trouble. He was orphaned as a baby and Slim took care of him for a while in Moonlight Madness. He causes Hank to be confused every time he appears, from posing as monsters/aliens to convincingly telling Hank a variety of tall-tales. Everytime Slim puts Eddy in a cage, Eddy convinces Hank to let him out and enter the cage himself, at which point Eddy locks him in. Despite this, Hank continues to be fooled and does not particularly like Eddy.

Although Tymiński was born in Pruszków, he was a completely unknown person in his native Poland until shortly before the 1990 presidential election, he emerged from the first ballot as the second strongest candidate; defeating liberal prime minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and forcing Solidarity leader Lech Wałęsa to stand a second ballot. After Wałęsa defeated him by a wide margin, Tymiński was a leader of Party X in Poland (1990–1995) and then returned to Canada to resume his business activities. Tymiński also contested the 2005 Polish presidential election.  1990 campaign  In 1990/1991, Tymiński led the Libertarian Party of Canada, a minor party which never received more than 0.25% of the vote. At the same time, he started a political career in his native Poland, where democracy had just been reestablished. In the first free presidential elections on November 25, 1990, the two most promising candidates were Solidarity leader Lech Wałęsa and prime minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki. Wałęsa, the electrician, union leader and people's tribune, had the image of an emotional, shirtsleeves populist, while lawyer and former Solidarity legal advisor Mazowiecki appeared as a more respectable and intellectual, but also more formal compromiser. Tymiński ran as a maverick candidate. He overtook Mazowiecki (18.1%) with 23.1% of the vote and placed second behind Wałęsa with 39.96%. As no candidate had achieved the absolute majority, a second ballot was required and held on December 9, 1990. In the second round, Tymiński lost to Wałęsa with just 25.75% of the total vote. The turnout in the ballots was 60.6% and 53.4%, respectively. The reasons for Tymiński's unexpected success remain unclear. Tymiński promised to create wealth for everyone quickly, and had an image as a patriotic Pole who had \\"made it\\" abroad. He was well received at a time when radical political changes were taking place, but the overall economic situation was getting worse: by the end of 1990, unemployment had increased from nearly zero to 6.5 percent, and gross national income had dropped by over 11 percent: the opening up of the economy had had a particularly negative effect on the standard of living for workers in sunset industries, small farmers and pensioners. Many people were increasingly disappointed with the conflict that had broken out within the former anti- communist opposition, making the unknown but seemingly honest and patriotic candidate appealing. Another potential factor was that Tymiński applied methods of political marketing which were unknown in Poland at that time. A key element of his campaign was a black briefcase he was rarely seen without – allegedly containing \\"secret documents\\" that were going to destroy his rivals' careers and that he would present when the time was due. Although the elections went by without the briefcase ever being opened, its presence secured constant attention. Tymiński's adversaries took to a similar strategy; the renowned daily Gazeta Wyborcza, which supported Mazowiecki, reported that Tymiński had had contact with the secret police apparatus himself, a story that was not withdrawn until after the elections. However, Tymiński did admit that several former colonels and lieutenant colonels from the Polish secret police were employed by his campaign, although he characterised this as an act of charity on his behalf. Meanwhile, during a televised debate with Tymiński ahead of the second round vote, Wałęsa responded to Tymiński's claim that the briefcase contained incriminating material regarding Wałęsa's private life by demanding that the documents be published immediately, which Tymiński declined to do. Foreign policy analyst John Feffer, who described Tymiński as \\"...a rich businessman, an outspoken outsider with a love of conspiracy theories\\", has suggested that his 1990 campaign served as a prototype for later campaigns by right-wing populist politicians such as Viktor Orbán, Jaroslaw Kaczynski and Donald Trump, by appealing to those who had lost out from the advance of globalization. Party X Tymiński, who had run as a nonpartisan candidate, founded a party of his own, which he called Party X, with a nationalist political profile. However, Tymiński's charisma did not translate into any long-term success for the party; in the 1991 general elections, his \\"X-Party\\" achieved just three seats in the Sejm. It did not contest any seats in 1997 and was formally disbanded in 1999.  2005 campaign  On March 24, 2005, in an interview for a South American Polish organization, Tymiński announced his readiness to run in the upcoming presidential election; an announcement he had previously made in more vague terms on his own homepage.See reports by Gazeta Wyborcza and Polish WikiNews ) On 3 June, Tymiński returned to Poland and officially declared his candidacy on behalf of a splinter party named the \\"All-Polish Citizens Coalition\\" (Ogólnopolska Koalicja Obywatelska). The party, whose acronym OKO translates as \\"eye\\", was founded by Wojciech Kornowski, a businessman who set up a network of eye surgery clinics in Poland. Kornowski, a former chairman of the Polish Employers Association (Konfederacja Pracodawców Polskich), has been trying to enter Polish politics for more than two decades by establishing contacts with completely different political milieus ranging from the communist Polish United Workers' Party in the 1980s to Andrzej Lepper's Samoobrona party. In 2004, his new outfit OKO received 0.6% of the Polish vote in the European parliament election. Refusing to make palpable political statements, Tymiński and Kornowski converge in their vague \\"pro-business\\" and \\"anti-establishment\\" message. Tymiński's campaign attracted some media attention. In late July of 2005 Tymiński was the first presidential candidate to successfully collect all 100,000 signatures making him an official candidate. During the first round of the 2005 presidential election, held on October 9, Tymiński received 23,545 votes or 0.2% of all valid votes.  Business interests  Tymiński was involved in developing the internet industry in Poland: in 1994, he was the first to offer Internet access \\"for everyone\\", included in Poland's first commercial bulletin board system \\"Maloka\\" (see :pl:Maloka BBS). However, when the national telephone company TPSA offered internet dial-up service, Maloka closed down in 1996. Today Tymiński operates his computer business in Canada and writes columns for various Polish-language periodicals in Canada and the United States. He is also a Trade Representative of Belarus in Canada.

He wrote a collection of poems called Nugae (Latin for 'trifles'), which are known as the Bagatelles in French. He is the great-uncle of Nicholas Bourbon (1574–1644), a member of the Académie française. Bourbon was born in Vendeuvre-sur-Barse, France. He went to England in 1535 to pay homage to Henry VIII of England and his second Queen Consort Anne Boleyn in gratitude for help received from them while under persecution in France. He later wrote a series of poems in which Anne Boleyn is described as one of God's beloved servants. Nugae was the subject of an epigram of John Owen.  Life and works  Bourbon began writing Latin poetry at a young age. In an early poem titled De Ferraria, Bourbon wrote about his origins and his native city of Vandeuvre, which was known in the 15th century for its cannonball forges. He also served as a précepteur for many important families, including that of the Cardinal of Tournon. He taught humanities in Amiens, in Langres, and in Troyes. His first poems were published in 1529 in a collection called Vandoperani, campani, epigrammata, which contained a mixture of epigrams, canticles, dialogues, and epistles. He followed up this initial work in 1533 with the first edition of Nugae (Bagatelles), for which incurred the wrath of religious authorities. In particular, in the epigram In lauduem Dei optimi maximi, Bourbon seemingly showed himself to be favorable to religious reform. It is also claimed that this work contains subtle criticisms of Noël Béda, a noted theologian and ideological opponent of humanist thinkers. As a result of this work, Bourbon was imprisoned for several years. Despite many appeals to his various protectors, a royal commandment to \\"take Borbonius out of prison,\\" and a petition to Cardinal Jean de Lorraine, Bourbon would remain imprisoned until released by Francis I in 1535. Bourbon subsequently left for England, where he benefited from the protection of Anne Boleyn, the former lady-in-waiting to Claude of France and the second wife of Henry VIII. She was herself a proponent of moderate evangelical reform, and helped Bourbon find work as a tutor. One of Bourbon's entourage in England was Hans Holbein the Younger, who was making his second stay at the Court of England. Holbein would draw Bourbon's portrait in 1535. Bourbon, who had a great admiration for Holbein, named him \\"the Apelles of our time.\\" Bourbon returned to France in 1536 and settled in Lyon, where he became a regular in the group of poets and humanists loyal to Étienne Dolet, known as the \\"école lyonnaise,\\" (the Lyonnaise School.\\") Other members of this group included Jean Visagier, Eustorg de Beaulieu, Gilbert Ducher, and Symphorien Champier. There, Bourbon met François Rabelais, who had also been targeted by the religious authorities for Pantagruel. In 1538, Bourbon released a second edition of Nugae, containing many new pieces, but with fewer controversial epistles. Around 1540, he took on the role of précepteur for Jeanne d'Albret, daughter of Marguerite de Navarre. He likely encountered other notable poets in service to the Queen, especially Clément Marot who, in the introductory texts of Adolescence clémentine, included an epigram titled \\"Bourbon, dit Borbonius, poète lyonnais\\" (\\"Bourbon, called Borbonius, Lyonnais poet.\\") Category:1500s births Category:1550s deaths Category:People from Aube Category:French poets Category:People of the Tudor period Category:16th-century French people Category:16th-century French poets Category:French male poets ","title":"Nicholas Bourbon (the elder)"},{"id":"1620692","text":"Centennial High School may refer to:  United States  *Centennial High School (Arizona), Peoria, Arizona *Centennial High School (Compton, California), Compton, California *Centennial High School (Corona, California), Corona, California *Centennial High School (Bakersfield, California), Bakersfield, California *Centennial High School (Fort Collins, Colorado), Poudre School District, Fort Collins, Colorado *Centennial High School (Pueblo, Colorado), Pueblo, Colorado *Centennial High School (Roswell, Georgia), Roswell, Georgia *Centennial High School (Idaho), Boise, Idaho *Centennial High School (Champaign, Illinois), Champaign, Illinois *Centennial High School (Howard County, Maryland), Ellicott City, (Howard County), Maryland *Centennial High School (Minnesota), Blaine, Minnesota *Centennial High School (Las Vegas), Las Vegas, Nevada *Centennial High School (Milford, New Hampshire), Milford, New Hampshire; (on the New Hampshire State Register of Historic Places) *Centennial High School (New Mexico), Las Cruces, New Mexico *Centennial High School (Ohio), Columbus, Ohio *Centennial High School (Oregon), Gresham, Oregon *Centennial High School (Tennessee), Franklin, Tennessee *Centennial High School (Frisco, Texas), Frisco, Texas *Lakeview Centennial High School, Garland, Texas *St. Lucie West Centennial High School, Port St. Lucie, Florida  Canada  *Centennial High School (Calgary), a senior high in Calgary, Alberta *Centennial Regional High School, a multi- campus English language high school in Quebec *Centennial Secondary School (Windsor, Ontario), also called Centennial High School, a former senior high school in Windsor, Ontario See also *Centennial Secondary School (disambiguation) *Centennial Collegiate, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, a high school ","title":"Centennial High School"},{"id":"1620697","title":"Oldmachar Academy"},{"id":"1620699","text":"Harlaw Academy is a six-year comprehensive secondary school situated 200 yards from the junction of Union Street and Holburn Street in the centre of Aberdeen, Scotland. It is directly adjacent to St Margaret's School for Girls. The academy draws most of its pupils from its associated primary schools, namely, Broomhill Primary School, Ferryhill Primary School, Kaimhill Primary School and Hanover Street School. Ross McLaren has been headteacher since February 2020.  History  The school was established in Little Belmont Street as the Aberdeen High School for Girls in 1874. The school moved to 19 Albyn Place, where it amalgamated with Mrs. Elmslie's Institution which occupied a prominent building designed by Archibald Simpson, in 1891. The Former Pupils' Club established a fund for the acquisition of a playing field at Hazlehead, as well as the cost of building and equipping a pavilion there. During the First World War, the building was requisitioned by the War Office to create the 1st Scottish General Hospital, a facility for the Royal Army Medical Corps to treat military casualties. Subsequent changes included the abolition of fees in 1947, the phasing out of the primary department in 1971 and the introduction of the city's area comprehensive system which brought about the changing of the school's name to Harlaw Academy in 1970. Ruthrieston Secondary School was to become part of Harlaw Academy in 1972. In 2010, Harlaw Academy was threatened with closure, as part of the Aberdeen City Council's programme of financial cutbacks. This created serious concerns in the feeder communities which launched a successful campaign to save the school.

Not all Platonic solids have molecular hydrocarbon counterparts. Tetrahedrane Tetrahedrane (C4H4) is a hypothetical compound. It has not yet been synthesized without substituents, but it is predicted to be kinetically stable in spite of its angle strain. Some stable derivatives, including tetra(tert- butyl)tetrahedrane (a hydrocarbon) and tetra(trimethylsilyl)tetrahedrane, have been produced. Cubane Cubane (C8H8) has been synthesized. Although it has high angle strain, cubane is kinetically stable, due to a lack of readily available decomposition paths. Octahedrane Angle strain would make an octahedron highly unstable due to inverted tetrahedral geometry at each vertex. There would also be no hydrogen atoms because four edges meet at each corner; thus, the hypothetical octahedrane molecule would be an allotrope of elemental carbon, C6, and not a hydrocarbon. The existence of octahedrane cannot be ruled out completely, although calculations have shown that it is unlikely. Dodecahedrane Dodecahedrane (C20H20) was first synthesized in 1982, and has almost zero angle strain thanks to its angles of 108°, which are close to the tetrahedral angle of 109.5°. Icosahedrane The tetravalency (4-connectedness) of carbon excludes an icosahedron because 5 edges meet at each vertex. True pentavalent carbon is unlikely; methanium, nominally , usually exists as . The hypothetical icosahedral lacks hydrogen so it is not a hydrocarbon; it is also an ion. Both icosahedral and octahedral structures have been observed in boron compounds such as the dodecaborate ion and some of the carbon-containing carboranes. Other polyhedra Increasing the number of atoms that comprise the carbon skeleton leads to a geometry that increasingly approximates a sphere, and the space enclosed in the carbon \\"cage\\" increases. This trend continues with buckyballs or spherical fullerene (C60). Although not a Platonic hydrocarbon, buckminsterfullerene has the shape of a truncated icosahedron, an Archimedean solid. The concept can also be extended to regular Euclidean tilings, with the hexagonal tiling producing graphane. A square tiling (which would resemble an infinitely large fenestrane) would suffer form the same problem as octahedrane, and the triangular tiling icosahedrane. No generalisations to hyperbolic tilings seem to be known. The regular convex 4-polytopes may also have hydrocarbon analogues; hypercubane has been proposed.

He made 23 appearances representing the Scotland rugby team. Despite being a career soldier on active service, he also captained the Scotland rugby team twice in 1965. Early life Campbell-Lamerton was born on 1 August 1933 at the Royal Naval Hospital in Valletta, Malta, the elder of two sons of Lieutenant-Commander Robert Campbell-Lamerton, and his wife, Margaret. His father was killed in action in 1943 on North Atlantic convoy duty. He was educated at Ottershaw School near Windsor, Berkshire. National Service took him to the Duke of Wellington's Regiment (West Riding) in 1952, the start of 33 years' service in the Army during which he served in Korea and Cyprus. Army career He and his lifelong friend, David Gilbert-Smith, led two platoons of the Duke of Wellington's Regiment (West Riding) during the Battle of the Hook in Korea, recovering positions overrun by the Chinese offensive. Campbell-Lamerton had already escaped a life-threatening injury at school when, aged 15, he was struck on the chest by a javelin; he courted death again on foot patrol in Korea when he trod on a mine. Hearing the faint click, he remained still while the corporal with him, who fortunately had worked in bomb disposal during the Second World War, rendered it safe. Three years later, serving in Cyprus during the EOKA campaign, he fell 60 ft from a helicopter in full combat gear, sustaining severe back, hip and leg injuries. That he recovered to play international sport is a tribute to his perseverance as well as his ability; He played rugby for his regiment (The 'Dukes'), the Army and Combined Services, and club rugby with Halifax, Blackheath Rugby Club and London Scottish RFC. He eventually rose to the rank of Colonel before leaving the army. Rugby His debut for Scotland came against France at Colombes on 7 January 1961. He went on to gain 23 Scotland caps as he appeared in the next five seasons, twice as captain in 1965.Bath, p123-4 He was picked for the 1962 British Lions tour to South Africa, playing all four internationals at number eight. But when the Lions team was selected for the 1966 tour, he was 32, no longer captain of his country and the leadership was expected go to Alun Pask, the outstanding Welsh No. 8. Massie says that \\"You would have had no doubt that he [Mike Campbell-Lamerton] could push in the scrum, and with him and Frans Ten Bos together it achieved a solidity and power that had long been lacking.\\"Massie, p175 Campbell-Lamerton was 6 ft 5 inches and 17 stone. However, he also says that Lamerton was not a good national captain: \\"He was perhaps over-conscientious and a worrier, and hardly spoke the same language as many of the team; it affected his play.\\" In terms of sheer entertainment value, Massie says, \\"I doubt if any other Scottish lock forward has given so much fun, not even Alastair McHarg.\\" Richard Bath writes of him that he was: :\\"A strong scrummager who held his own in the at the line-out and was a considerable presence in the loose, Campbell-Lamerton excelled in the second row for Scotland from his first cap in 1961 until his 23rd in 1966.\\" Allan Massie provides a more colourful description of him: :\\"The sight of captain M.J. Campbell-Lamerton of the Duke of Wellington's Regiment surging round the tail of a line-out like an enraged hippopotamus was one of the most stirring spectacles in Scottish Rugby. A huge man, 6 feet 5 inches and often over 17 stones, he made an abrupt and unheralded entry into top-class Rugby for a Combined Services team against a Scottish Select at Murrayfield in December 1960. The game was played in a thick haar, and almost the only impression spectators retained of it was of this man-mountain surging out of mist as a mastodon from a primeval swamp. It took him into the Scottish team and he stayed there til 1966 to win twenty-three caps.\\"Massie, p174 =Lions in New Zealand (1966)= Though the Lions beat in successive internationals, the New Zealand section of the tour was marred by ill feeling. After the game with Canterbury, the Lions captain for the day, Jim Telfer, said at the after match function: \\"I would not describe today's game as dirty because all our games in New Zealand have been dirty.\\" Understandably this caused a furore but it was the backdrop against which Campbell-Lamerton had to keep his players united. Campbell-Lamerton, would not have been out of place in the modern game: he was a big man, at 6 feet 5 inches, weighing more than 17 stone, yet athletic enough to play No. 8 as well as his accustomed position in the second row. But the qualities which served him best on the difficult tour of New Zealand as captain of the 1966 Lions were his commitment and willingness which did so much to sustain a struggling tour party. At one stage the manager, Des O'Brien left the party for a reconnaissance mission to Fiji (where a final tour game was to be played), and the coach, John Robins, was in hospital with damaged ankle ligaments, leaving Campbell-Lamerton with far greater responsibilities than any modern equivalent would face. Yet in a squad which he had not been expected to captain, his players still speak warmly of the example he set after a tour in which the Lions lost all four internationals against the All Blacks. The recurrence of an ankle injury which caused his withdrawal from the second game against New Zealand, did not help and he also missed the final international. \\"Mike was a decent man and much-maligned\\", Brian Price, his second-row partner in three of the tour internationals, said. \\"We knew how hard he was working and it was because we respected his efforts, we stuck together.\\" After the tour he retired from playing rugby. In 1972 he was appointed to coach the British Combined services team. In his military career, he rose to the rank of colonel, led him to the command of a battalion in Northern Ireland, thence to the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, where he was commander of Old College and Victory College. Post-military He left the Army in 1985 and became bursar at Balliol College, Oxford, later being elected an Emeritus Fellow of the college. He also took a close interest in the fortunes of the university rugby club, whose president he eventually became. He was elected a Knight of Malta, the organisation which raises funds for Catholic charities. In 2001 prostate cancer was diagnosed, an illness he endured with great fortitude until his death on 17 March 2005, aged 71. Family In 1956 Campbell-Lamerton met and married Marie-Christine (née Cottrell) while stationed in Gibraltar. They had three sons: Jeremy, (born 1959) who also played lock for Scotland five times in the 1986-7 season, Michael Patrick (born 1958), Ian Anthony (born 1962) and a daughter Clare Josephine Margaret (born 1961). Awards and honours Campbell-Lamerton received a MBE in 1974, then an OBE in 1979. ReferencesSources * Bath, Richard (ed.)

The Atayal people numbered around 90,000, approximately 15.9% of Taiwan's total indigenous population, making them the third-largest indigenous group.Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Executive Yuan, R.O.C. (DGBAS). National Statistics, Republic of China (Taiwan). Preliminary statistical analysis report of 2000 Population and Housing Census . Excerpted from Table 28:Indigenous population distribution in Taiwan-Fukien Area. Accessed PM 8/30/06 The preferred endonym is \\"Tayal\\", although the Taiwanese government officially recognizes them as \\"Atayal\\". Etymology The Atayal word for Atayal is , meaning \\"human\\" or \\"man\\". Origins 1901 map of Taiwan, with \\"Atayal Group\\" marked. The first record of Atayal inhabitance is found near the upper reaches of the Zhuoshui River. During the late 17th century, they crossed the Central Mountain Ranges into the wilderness of the east. They then settled in the Liwu River valley. Seventy-nine Atayal villages can be found here. =Genetics= Taiwan is home of a number of Austronesian indigenous groups since before 4,000 BC. However, genetic analysis suggests that the different peoples may have different ancestral source populations originating in mainland Asia, and developed in isolation from each other. The Atayal people are believed to have migrated to Taiwan from Southern China or Southeast Asia. Genetic studies have also found similarities between the Atayal and other people in the Philippines and Thailand, and to a lesser extent with south China and Vietnam. The Atayal are genetically distinct from the Amis people who are the largest indigenous group in Taiwan, as well as from the Han people, suggesting little mingling between these people. Studies on Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymorphisms suggest ancient migrations of two lineages of the various peoples into Taiwan approximately 11,000-26,000 years ago. Recent DNA studies show that the Lapita people and modern Polynesians have a common ancestry with the Atayal and the Kankanaey people of the northern Philippines. The Atayal are visibly different from the Han Chinese of Taiwan. Intermarriage with Chinese also produced a significant number of Atayal-Chinese mixed offspring and celebrities such as Vivian Hsu, Vic Zhou, Yuming Lai, Kao Chin Su-mei. =Folklore= According to stories told by their elders, the first Atayal ancestors appeared when a stone, Pinspkan, cracked apart. There were three people, but one decided to go back into the stone. One man and one woman who lived together for a very long time and loved each other very much. But the boy was shy and wouldn't dare approach her. Whereupon, the girl came up with an idea. She left her home and found some coal with which to blacken her face so she could pose as a different girl. After several days, she crept back into their home and the boy mistook her for another girl and they lived happily ever after. Not long after, the couple bore children, fulfilling their mission of procreating the next generation. The Atayal custom of face tattooing may have come from the girl blackening her face in the story. CultureLifestyle= Traditional Atayal houses. The Atayal people have a well-developed culture. They originally lived by fishing, hunting, gathering, and growing crops on burned-off mountain fields. Atayal also practice crafts such as weaving, net knotting, and woodworking. They also have traditional musical instruments and dances. The Atayal are known as skilled warriors. In a practice illegal since the Japanese Colonial Era (1895 –1945), to earn his facial tattoo a man had to bring back at least one human head; these heads, or skulls, were highly honored, given food and drink, and expected to bring good harvests to the fields. (See Headhunting.) The Atayal were known to be fierce fighters as observed in the case of the Wushe Incident, in which the Atayal participated in an uprising against colonial Japanese forces. Lalaw Behuw is a weapon used by the Atayals. Traditional Aboriginal weapons have featured in movies. =Traditional dress= Atayal dress designs. The Atayal are proficient weavers, incorporating symbolic patterns and designs on their traditional dress. The features are mainly of geometric style, and the colors are bright and dazzling. Most of the designs are argyles and horizontal lines. In Atayal culture, the horizontal lines represent the rainbow bridge which leads the dead to where the ancestors' spirits live. Argyles, on the other hand, represent ancestors' eyes protecting the Atayal. The favorite color of this culture is red because it represents blood and power. =Facial tattoos= Two elder Atayal women with facial tattoos as a symbol of maturity, which was a tradition for both males and females. The custom was banned during Japanese rule. The Atayal people are also known for using facial tattooing and teeth filing in coming-of-age initiation rituals. The facial tattoo, in Squliq Tayal, is called ptasan. In the past both men and women had to show that they had performed a major task associated with an adult before their faces could be tattooed. For a man, he had to take the head of an enemy, showing his valor as a hunter to protect and provide for his people, while women had to be able to weave cloth. A girl would learn to weave when she was about ten or twelve, and she had to master the skill in order to earn her tattoo. Only those with tattoos could marry, and, after death, only those with tattoos could cross the hongu utux, or spirit bridge (the rainbow) to the hereafter. Male tattooing is relatively simple, with only two bands down the forehead and chin. Once a male came of age he would have his forehead tattooed; after fathering a child, his bottom chin was tattooed. For the female, tattooing was done on the cheek, typically from the ears across both cheeks to the lips forming a V shape. While tattooing on a man is relatively quick, on a female it may take up to ten hours. Tattooing was performed only by female tattooists. The tattooing was performed using a group of needles lashed to a stick called atok tapped into the skin using a hammer called totsin. Black ash would then be rubbed into the skin to create the tattoo. Healing could take up to a month. The Japanese banned the practice of tattooing in 1930 because of its association with headhunting. With the introduction of Christianity, the practice declined, and tattoos are now only seen on the elderly. However, some young people in recent years have attempted to revive the practice. By 2018 only one tattooed elder survived, Lawa Piheg, who was tattooed when she was 8. Interview with last tattooed person, with historical photographs of instruments, tattooed people, etc. Lawa Piheg died on 14 September 2019. Atayal in modern times Hsuehshan mountains. The Atayal people in Taiwan live in central and northern Taiwan. The northernmost village is in Ulay District (Wulai in Chinese), about 25 kilometers south of Taipei.

Without security of tenure, an office-holder may find his or her ability to carry out their powers, functions and duties restricted by the fear that whoever disapproves of any of their decisions may be able to easily remove them from office in revenge. Security of tenure offers protection, by ensuring that an office-holder cannot be victimised for exercising their powers, functions and duties. It enables the democratic or constitutional methodology through which an office-holder comes to office not to be overturned except in the strictest and most extreme cases. Method of removal The standard form of security of tenure offered to officeholders is usually that they can only be removed from office by either of two methods: *removal from office following impeachment (a formal charge equivalent to a criminal law indictment) by parliament, using weighted majorities (usually a two-thirds majority); *removal by courts for incapacity (mental, physical or psychological problems make them no longer for the foreseeable future be able to function in office). Most presidents of states worldwide and most monarchs have security of tenure. Governors-General do not and can be dismissed by their head of state when formally advised to do so either by the prime minister or by the cabinet. In the United States, while three presidents were impeached in the over two centuries existence of the presidency, (Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump), no president has been removed from office to date. Problems over lack of security of tenureThe Australian Dismissal Crisis in 1975= Lack of security of tenure is regarded by some commentators as having contributed to the controversial decision of Australian governor-general Sir John Kerr to dismiss the prime minister, Gough Whitlam, in 1975. In the immediate aftermath of the dismissal critics, the Labor Party and much of the media criticised Kerr for not giving any advance indication that he intended to dismiss the prime minister. In systems where a head of state or representative of the head of state has security of tenure, both are in a position to exercise the third of Walter Bagehot's three maxims governing the rights of a head of state: the 'right to warn' that prime minister or government's actions or inactions are inadvisable and in breach either of constitutional law or constitutional conventions. The problem for Kerr was that if he had made any threat to dismiss Whitlam, if the latter did not manage to solve the crisis facing Australia over the stalemate in parliament and the loss of supply could have been followed by a request by Whitlam to the Queen of Australia to dismiss Kerr and so pre-empt his own dismissal. In a press conference after the withdrawal of his commission, Whitlam inadvertently highlighted this option when he told reporters: \\"The Governor-General prevented me from getting in touch with the Queen by just withdrawing the Commission immediately. I was unable to communicate with the Queen, as I would have been entitled to do, if I'd had any warning of the course that he, the Governor-General, was to take.\\" As constitutionally, the Queen of Australia has no role in commissioning someone to form a government, or indeed in withdrawing someone's commission, her only active role would be with regard to who was governor-general. Other than that, her only possible role could have been to advise informally the Governor-General that it would be a mistake to dismiss Whitlam. (A then-advisor to Queen Elizabeth II indicated later that the advisor believed that she would have advised Kerr not to dismiss Whitlam had Kerr consulted her.) Whatever about the wisdom of Kerr's decision to withdraw the commission of Whitlam, the lack of security of tenure meant that he had little room for prior consultation with Whitlam without raising the danger that he himself would be dismissed to halt any planned intervention. That fundamental design flaw forced an extreme solution of sorts on the crisis, whereas, protected by security of tenure, other heads of state would have had the option of informal consultation, even to the extent of warning the head of government that if the head of government persisted with a particular course of action, the head of state would have to intervene using the constitutional powers. In contrasts, presidents of France, Italy, Ireland and elsewhere have been able in effect to warn prime ministers that they would have to intervene unless a solution to the crisis was found, with the prime ministers then being able to seek a compromise solution to the crisis to head off a head of state intervention. =The proposed Australian presidency= This design flaw in the Australian system was highlighted by international experts who briefed the Republic Advisory Committee in 1993 on the lessons to be learnt in moving from a constitutional monarchy to a republic. However, later that decade, Australia's constitutional convention produced a proposed model of Australian president that continued to lack security of tenure. During the 1999 referendum on becoming a republic, some critics asserted that the failure to provide security of tenure meant that the proposed presidency was fatally flawed from conception, with the officeholder unable to intervene except through a sudden, unannounced action such as that performed by Kerr in November 1975. For that reason, support of the monarchy and other reasons, Australia voted to retain its constitutional monarchy in the referendum.

Early life and education Wedgwood was born on 25 March 1901 in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Her father was Josiah Wedgwood later the first Baron Wedgwood. Her mother, Ethel Bowen Wedgwood, was the daughter of a Lord Justice of Appeal, Charles Bowen. She was a member of the extensive Wedgwood family. Her parents separated in 1914 and divorced in 1919. Wedgwood was educated at two independent schools: Orme Girls' School in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, and at Bedales School in Steep, Hampshire. She studied at Bedford College, London and at Newnham College, Cambridge. At the University of Cambridge, she studied for both the English and anthropology Tripos. She completed both, leaving with first class honours but no degree (women were not awarded degrees by Cambridge until 1948). She was awarded Master of Arts status by Cambridge in 1927. She studied under Bronisław Malinowski at Bedford College and Alfred Cort Haddon at Cambridge. Career After leaving the University of Cambridge, Wedgwood returned to Bedford College, London as an assistant lecturer in its Department of Social Studies. After Arthur Bernard Deacon death in 1927, she was invited to move to the University of Sydney to replace him as lecturer in anthropology. She was also asked by Alfred Radcliffe-Brown to edit Deacon's remaining field notes in preparation for publication: they were published as \\"Malekula: A Vanishing People in the New Hebrides\\" in 1934. In 1930, she held a temporary lectureship in the Department of African Life and Languages at the University of Cape Town. From 1930 to 1932, having returned to England, she was a lecturer at the London School of Economics and personal assistant to Bronisław Malinowski. In 1932, Wedgwood was awarded a fellowship by the Australian Research Council to conduct fieldwork on Manam Island off the north coast of Papua New Guinea on the border of what are today Madang and East Sepik provinces. Also in 1932, she became a Member of Council of the Royal Anthropological Institute. In June 1935, she was appointed Principal of The Women's College, University of Sydney. During this time, she became an active member of Sydney high society. She left the appointment in 1944 to join the military. During World War II, Wedgwood was involved in formulating policy on education and administration in Papua New Guinea. Having renounced her pacifism, she volunteered for the Australian Army Medical Women's Service and was commissioned as a temporary lieutenant colonel in January 1944. After two years of service, she was demobilised in 1946. After the war Wedgwood took a position at the Australian School of Pacific Administration, which was responsible for training Australian colonial officers and administrators. She continued in this role until her death. She had developed lung cancer after being a life-long heavy smoker, and died on 17 May 1955 at Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney. Wedgwood Close in the Canberra suburb of Chisholm is named in her honour. Personal life Wedgwood was a member of the Religious Society of Friends (the Quakers) and as such was a pacifist. However, she was increasingly attracted to Anglicanism during her time in Australia and particularly to the Anglo-Catholic wing of the church. She was received into the Church of England in Australia in 1944. Selected works * ReferencesFurther reading * Camilla : C.H. Wedgwood 1901–1955, a Life. 1990. By D. Wetherell and C. Carr-Gregg.

He was a New Democratic Party member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1987 to 1995, and was a cabinet minister in the government of Bob Rae. Background Farnan was educated at University College in Dublin, the National University of Dublin, the University of London in England and McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He has a Master's degree in Education, and a bachelor's degree of arts. He has worked as a primary and secondary school teacher in London, Montreal, Cambridge, Ontario and Brampton Ontario for twenty-seven years. A devout Roman Catholic working within Ontario's separate school system, he served as provincial director of the Ontario English Catholic Teacher's Association for a time, as well as participating in a variety of community outreach projects in Cambridge. After he retired from teaching in 2002, he studied to become a real estate agent and broker of his own company Mike Farnan Realty in Cambridge. He also served as associate broker for Crown Realty Royal Le Page and for Peak Realty, both located in Cambridge. Politics Farnan ran for the federal New Democratic Party in Cambridge during the 1980 federal election. He came second, 3,080 votes behind Progressive Conservative Chris Speyer. He also served on the Cambridge city council for the period in the 1980s. Farnan was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1987 provincial election, defeating Liberal candidate Claudette Millar in the provincial riding of Cambridge (incumbent Progressive Conservative Bill Barlow finished third). The NDP were the official opposition in this period, and Farnan served as his party's critic for Correctional Services and Tourism and Recreation. The NDP won a majority government in the 1990 provincial election, and Farnan was re-elected by a landslide in Cambridge. On October 1, 1990, he was appointed as the Rae government's first Solicitor General and Minister of Correctional Services. As Solicitor-General, Farnan introduced employment equity provisions for Ontario's police force. He also established a \\"common pause day\\" which continued the province's previous restrictions on Sunday shopping. In the spring of 1991, he became involved in a minor controversy concerning two letters which had been sent from his staff to Justices of the Peace in Ontario, one of which requested the review of a case. This was seen by some as inappropriate interference from his office, and while Farnan did not write the letters himself, he was nonetheless dropped from cabinet on July 31, 1991. In September 1991 he was appointed as Deputy Chairman of the house and he served in that role for the next two years. On June 17, 1993, Farnan was re-appointed as a Minister without portfolio responsible for Education and Training. In this capacity, he served as an assistant to Minister of Education Dave Cooke. Farnan returned to a full cabinet position on October 21, 1994, having been appointed Minister of Transportation. In 1994, Farnan was one of twelve NDP members to vote against Bill 167, a bill extending financial benefits to same-sex partners. Premier Bob Rae allowed a free vote on the bill which allowed members of his party to vote with their conscience. The NDP were defeated in the 1995 provincial election, and Farnan lost the Cambridge seat to Progressive Conservative Gerry Martiniuk by about 5,500 votes. He ran a second time for the House of Commons of Canada in the 1997 federal election, but finished third against Liberal Janko Peric. =Cabinet positions=After politics In the late 1990s, Farnan became a school teacher at St. Thomas Aquinas Secondary School in Brampton, Ontario. He specialized in social science courses (mainly Religion). He retired in December 1996.

Although the church believes that all Christians are called by their gifts and talents to the ministry, priesthood is seen as a particular expression of universal ministry to which all are called. In Community of Christ, both women and men can be ordained to the priesthood. All offices are deemed equal in importance, but the duties and responsibilities of each differ. For a person to be called to the priesthood for the first time, his or her calling is typically discerned by the pastor of the local congregation. These priesthood calls are approved after review by a Mission Center President and vote of a congregational conference. For certain calls, the discernment will come through other church officials and approval will be voted upon at a Mission Center Conference or World Conference. Once the call has been administratively processed it is presented to the individual called. If that individual accepts the call and is sustained by a conference vote, he or she will be ordained to that office. Overview The priesthood comprises two primary orders, the Aaronic Order and the Melchisedec Order, although these terms are used less frequently than in prior years. The Aaronic priesthood includes the offices of Deacon, Teacher and Priest. The Melchisedec Order includes the offices of Elder, Seventy, High Priest, Bishop, Apostle, President and Prophet. Elders serve in both missionary and administrative roles. Congregational pastors often hold the priesthood office of Elder, however, they may be \\"set apart\\" as a congregational pastor from almost any priesthood office. High Priests are known today as \\"ministers of vision\\" and collectively comprise the \\"High Priesthood\\" of the church. The Evangelist, Bishop, Apostle and Prophet are specialized priesthood offices within the High Priesthood. The names of the priesthood offices in Community of Christ are similar to those of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, of which it shares a common 14-year history. However, numerous differences in belief about the duties, calling, authority and organization of priesthood have developed as the two denominations have taken divergent paths since 1844. Priesthood Offices In Community of Christ the priesthood consists of two priesthoods, the Aaronic Order and the Melchisedec Order. =Aaronic Order= The Aaronic Order consists of three priesthood offices. These offices are deacon, teacher, and priest. They hold the \\"key\\" to angelic ministry. The ministers of the Aaronic Order are seen as ministers of presence. Deacon A deacon models Jesus as comforter. Part of the ministry of deacons is to watch over the church, visit the homes of members, to teach and preach, care for the physical and social well-being of the church, and to teach and advise people regarding the principles of Disciples' Generous Response. A deacon cares for members and friends in the temporal aspects of life. Deacons are to be sensitive to the spiritual, physical, and temporal needs of all individuals and families. Teacher The teacher models Jesus as peacemaker. Teachers are called to strengthen the membership, see that the church meets often, preach and teach, reconcile those who have taken offense either at another person or the church, and lead people into paths of discipleship. A key attribute of a teacher is the ability to create friendship and to have knowledge of the families within a congregation. A teacher is a shepherd, one who recognizes the life problems that the members face each day. A teacher's relationship with others is one of redemptive love and concern. Teachers are regarded as ministers of reconciliation with special responsibilities to share spiritual counsel and encouragement to members who are experiencing personal conflicts, however, they are not typically professional counselors or certified mediation specialists. Priest A priest models Jesus as friend. Priests minister to families, preach and teach. They can also perform the Sacrament of Baptism, Administer the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, and Solemnize and perform the Sacrament of Marriage. They may also perform the sacrament of Ordination for those called to the office of deacon, teacher, or priest. They share with the elders the responsibility to explain all things concerning the church to those who have been baptized but yet to be confirmed. =Melchisedec Order= The Melchisedec Order consists of two main offices and several specialized offices within them. The two main offices are Elder and High Priest. At times the term elder is used to refer to all who are of the Melchisedec Order. In a more specific sense, the office of elder is sometimes viewed as an appendage to the office of high priest. The Melchisedec Order is theologically viewed (and often termed) as being the High Priesthood, but a distinction needs to be made between the High Priesthood and the Quorum of High Priests (see below). Elders (and seventies, see below) are not high priests, and therefore do not belong to the Quorum of High Priests, but are, as members of the Melchisedec priesthood, part of the High Priesthood. The President of the Church is also the President of the High Priesthood, which means that he holds presidency over elders. Other members of the High Priesthood have their own presidents, but are also under the President of the Church by virtue again of his role as President of the entire High Priesthood. Indirectly, the President of the Church also holds presidency over the entire Aaronic priesthood, through the Order of Bishops. Therefore, the President of the Church presides over the entire priesthood of the church, both administratively and spiritually. The Melchisedec Ministers are seen as ministers of mission and vision. Elder Elders are \\"ministers of mission.\\" Their ministry expresses the mission of the church. While their ministry is direct and tangible it also expresses the deep spiritual ministry of the gospel. The ministers are called to bring people to Christ and baptize those who are ready to commit their lives to Christ. They may ordain people to the offices of the Aaronic Order and to the office of Elder. They also can perform/administer the other sacraments of the church, except for the Sacrament of the Evangelist's Blessing. Elders are called to teach and preach and watch over the church and to visit the homes of members. They may be called to serve in an elder's court. =Seventy= The priesthood office of Seventy, which alludes to the New Testament account of Jesus' commission of seventy missionaries, is also considered to be an Elder. Part of the function of the Seventy is a missionary role, and they work closely with the Apostle in charge of the field they are in to develop the strategies and resources to implement the missionary task of the church. They are organized into ten (formerly seven, see below) quorums, each quorum is presided over by a president. These presidents make up the Council of Presidents of Seventy and are collectively led by the \\"Senior President of Seventy,\\" who is one of the principal missionaries and missionary education leaders of the church. The scriptures suggest that the Seventy are in some way equal to the Council of Twelve Apostles, as indicated in Doctrine and Covenants 104:11e. Even more intriguing, the Council of Twelve is sometimes said to be equal of the Presidency. The equality of the seventy to the Twelve, and by virtue of such equality, also the Presidency, is confirmed in 124:4a. The logistics of such equality to the Presidency and the Twelve (as well as the Twelve to the Presidency) is not made plain. On January 17, 2010, the President-Prophet (see below) of Community of Christ, Stephen M. Veazey, presented a revelation to the church in which the number of quorums of seventy, and presidents of seventy (both of which had always been seven) could now be flexible, based on the needs of the church at any particular time. That revelation was approved on April 14, 2010, and shortly afterwards, it was announced that there would now be ten quorums (and thus ten presidents). This eliminates a logistical issue that existed previously, as the seventy are called to work closely with the Council of Twelve Apostles. For ministerial & missional purposes, the church divides the world into 11 apostolic \\"fields\\", each supervised by one apostle (the 12th apostle being the President of the Council and the Director of Field Ministries). The Apostles are regarded as the senior missionary team in the church, but the specific calling of the seventy and the quorums which they belong to, is also missionary work, and so, to some degree, they fall under the direction of the Apostles, however, as there were 11 fields, and seven quorums, there was always some overlap with global coverage which was not efficient. In April 2010, during the World Conference of the Church, it was decided that the church would be reorganized from 11 to 10 fields (with one apostle, in addition to the director of field ministries, having non- geographic based missional responsibilities), and, as a result of that, the quorums of seventy were increased, from seven to ten, to now perfectly align with each apostolic field. High Priest High Priests are regarded as \\"ministers of vision.\\" They can be called to serve in any of the offices of the priesthood and there are several specialized callings within this office. Collectively the High Priests are the Quorum of the High Priests. It is desired that the pastor or presiding officer of a large well established congregation is a High Priest. =Evangelist= An Evangelist is a High Priest ordained for special ministries in evangelism and spiritual direction. The \\"Order of Evangelists\\" is presided over by the Presiding Evangelist and they are referred to as \\"ministers of blessing.\\" These High Priests that have been called to this order are ideally free of administrative responsibilities and are to be responsive to the reconciling and redeeming influence of the Holy Spirit in the lives of all. They give parental counsel and advice to the church and confer spiritual blessings. The Evangelist is available to offer a sacred blessing which can assist persons to recognize and touch the divine nature of God that resides within them. By responding to this divine presence, it nurtures and assures persons of their identity and ultimate and eternal worth before God. This blessing is recorded in writing and stored in the archives of the church at its World Headquarters in Independence, Missouri. The Evangelist's Blessing is founded upon a prior practice known as the \\"patriarchal blessing\\" (see Sacraments). Previous to the 1980s, Evangelists were known both as Patriarchs and Evangelists. The name \\"Patriarch\\" was dropped when women were first ordained to this office. =Bishop= A Bishop is a High Priest ordained for special ministry. All bishops belong to the Order of Bishops which guides the church in teaching the principles of Disciples' Generous Response along with the larger understanding of stewardship. They are led by the Presiding Bishopric in providing support, training, and advocacy in empowering Aaronic ministers to respond to their call of ministry. The Presiding Bishopric also hold Presidency over the Aaronic Order. They also serve as judges in church court proceedings. Historically, the Order of Bishops included other bishoprics, particularly at stake levels. Some bishops continue to have financial responsibility for a particular area. For example, mission centers will have a bishop. Nationally, Canada is one of the few countries to have a bishop for the entire nation. There are other bishops in Canada, but they serve in a supporting role to the Bishop of Canada (and may preside over mission centers within Canada). An interesting fact about the office of bishop is that there is evidence to suggest that it properly belongs to the Aaronic Order. Section 68 of the Doctrine and Covenants states that a literal descendant of Aaron has the right to officiate in this office. However, since it would be difficult to prove such lineage, it is also stated that high priests can be ordained bishops, as they have the right to officiate in all the lesser offices. Individuals ordained as bishops are therefore always high priests, and are therefore considered part of the Melchisedec priesthood. Because of the huge responsibility that is the burden of the Order of Bishops (that of financial administration), it is also, by necessity, generally not viewed as being lesser to the Quorum of High Priests. In 2008 the Church started appointing field bishops. This is not a new priesthood office, simply a new position being filled by some bishops. They serve as assistants to the apostles, who are being called to lay down administrative responsibilities (as much as possible) in order to have more freedom to be missionaries of Jesus Christ. Field bishops, as assistants to the apostles, will be taking over these administrative tasks. =High Councilor= This office is mentioned for the sake of completeness and historical reference. Originally, high councilors were considered an office of priesthood, which is confirmed by Doctrine and Covenants Section 129:7b. High Councilors served on either a stake council, or on the Standing High Council. Stake councils have since been abolished, but the Standing High Council is still an official body of the church, providing advice to the First Presidency and being tasked on occasion with drafting official policy statements. It also has some judicial functions. Members of the High Council are no longer ordained as such, but are set apart (and must be high priests). The term high councilor is itself now rarely, if ever, used, except in a historical sense. Section 129 is the most recent section in the Doctrine and Covenants to make reference to the Standing High Council (the actual word \\"standing\\" being used only in Section 104). Although the office (if not the role) seems to no longer be generally viewed as an actual office, the church could reverse this perception if it so wished, as its existence is provided for in church scripture, and it could be argued that since it is a scriptural office of priesthood (as opposed to simply a position held by a priesthood member, such as a pastor) that those who become members of the Standing High Council still serve in a distinct office. Furthermore, Section 17:17 uses the actual words \\"high councilor\\", and notes that they, like bishops and high priests, are ordained. This clearly indicates that, contrary to current custom, perception, and terminology, the high councilor is most definitely an actual office of priesthood. Section 104:15 suggests that this body, like the Seventy, are equal to the Twelve Apostles. Again, the logistics of such is not clear. =Apostle= The Council of Twelve Apostles is composed of twelve persons who hold the priesthood office of Apostle. Together with the First Presidency and the Presiding Bishopric they comprise the World Church Leadership Council. They are primarily responsible for the church's missionary outreach and field administration. They are called to bear their personal testimonies as a special witness of Jesus Christ and to enable the church to bear its witness as Community of Christ. They administer the work of the church in the field and they oversee the seventies in the area of missionary work. One of the apostles is set apart as president of the council. There are revelations in the Doctrine & Covenants that suggest that the Apostles are, in some sense, equal in authority to the First Presidency itself, but the logistics of such equality are unclear. For purposes of conducting world church business, the church divides the world into geographic based apostolic \\"fields\\". In recent years, there have been eleven such fields (the President of the Council of Twelve concurrently serves as Director of Field Ministries, and does not preside over a field, but often has, in addition to the above roles, responsibility for specific, but non-geographic based forms of missionary work, such as overseeing military chaplains). In April 2010, during the church's World Conference, it was announced that there would be now ten apostolic fields, with a second apostle having non-geographic based missionary responsibilities. =President= Administratively, there are numerous presidents within the Church, including congregational presidents (pastors), presidents of large jurisdictions of the Church (mission centers), presidents of local priesthood quorums (any quorum of deacons, any quorum of elders, etc.), and presidents of World Church level priesthood quorums (Council of Twelve Apostles, Quorum of High Priests, etc.). However, only members of the highest body of the Church, the Quorum of the First Presidency, are actually ordained to the priesthood office of President. All three members of the First Presidency are thus termed “President X, President Y, President Z”. However, only one of these individuals is the actual president of the Church (and of the quorum itself). To put it simply, all three are presidents by priesthood office, but only one is the administrative and spiritual President of the Church. The other two serve as his or her counselors, and are often informally referred to as such. The President of the Church is also always President of the High Priesthood and therefore, indirectly of the entire priesthood (the office of elder being viewed as an appendage of the High Priest, and the entire Aaronic Priesthood having as its presidency the Order of Bishops, itself part of the High Priesthood). Additionally, the President of the Church is also concurrently ordained Prophet of the Church (see below). These three roles are perpetually merged; it is not possible to be one without being the other two. It is not entirely clear which (if any) of these three roles are derived from the other(s) but this is simply a question of theological curiosity, and has (thus far) never had any practical relevance as they are all, as stated, perpetually merged. =Prophet= The President of Community of Christ holds the priesthood office of Prophet. Together with two counselors, they comprise the First Presidency. The prophet- president of Community of Christ is the president of this Quorum, and chooses the other two members of the Presidency to serve as counselors. While all three are charged with presiding over church government, the president has extra responsibilities as prophet, seer, and revelator of the church. This means the prophet-president bears the responsibility of bringing prophetic instruction to the church. The First Presidency are to be the chief interpreters of the Word of God to the church and have ultimate responsibility for church administration. =Executive offices= In addition to the various offices listed above, there are other positions held by Melchisedec priesthood members that are not generally listed in brief overviews of the church's priesthood, but which do require ordination (as opposed to a prayer of “setting apart”). These include the Presiding Evangelist, the Presiding Bishop, the Counselors to the Presiding Bishop, and the presidents of the Seven Quorums of Seventy; and in some cases president and prophet are also omitted from lists of priesthood office. Thus, “Counselor to the Presiding Bishop” should be considered a full priesthood office, but on account of such a term being rather cumbersome, it is generally avoided. While the above named roles are often overlooked as priesthood offices, the positions themselves are most definitely not obsolete, and do in fact, together with the First Presidency and Council of Twelve Apostles, constitute the leadership of the Church, and the status of each (including president and prophet) as an office of priesthood is confirmed in The Priesthood Manual. All of these positions (except Presidents of Seventy) are specialist offices of the office of high priest. Historically, members of the Standing High Council were also ordained, and known as High Councilors (Doctrine and Covenants, Section 17:17); but current custom seems to support a blessing of setting apart for members of the Standing High Council. They are High Priests belonging to the Quorum of High Priests. Curiously, the 2004 edition of the Priesthood manual contains conflicting information regarding the Presidents of Seventy. As noted, they are ordained however the same page notes that the Senior President of Seventy is set apart. So, the distinction between the two roles, and the fact that one is ordained, and the other is set apart is clear. Further, it states, under the section regarding High Priests, that Presidents of Seventy are set apart. This statement is made in an overview of the office of High Priest, citing examples of roles filled by high priests, which are set apart instead of ordained. The mention of Presidents of Seventy in this paragraph is itself curious, as Presidents of Seventy are not high priests (although it also mentions pastors, who need not be of any particular priesthood office, so long as they are in the priesthood). Section 121:5b states: \\"My servants of the Seventy may select from their number seven; of which number those now being of the seven presidents of Seventy shall be a part; who shall form the presidency of seven presidents of Seventy as provided in my law.\\" The fact that this counsel places the selection of the seven presidents into the hands of the seventy suggests that the role of president of seventy is a position, and not an office, which would therefore not warrant ordination.

History  Bunun in 1900. Photograph by 250x250px Until the coming of the Christian missionaries in the beginning of the 20th century, the Bunun were known to be fierce warriors and headhunters. The Bunun were one of the \\"high-mountain peoples\\" (along with the Atayal and the Taroko) who traditionally lived in small family units in Taiwan's Central Mountain Range and were hostile to all outsiders, whether they be Chinese immigrants or surrounding aboriginal peoples. Whereas most other aborigines were quite sedentary and tended to live in lower areas, the Bunun, along with the Atayal and Taroko were constantly on the move in Taiwan's Central Mountain Range, looking for new hunting grounds and practicing slash-and-burn agriculture. Their staple foods were millet, yam, and game. 328x328px During the Japanese rule (1895–1945), the Bunun were among the last peoples to be \\"pacified\\" by the Japanese government in residence. After an initial period of fierce resistance, they were forced to move down from the mountains and concentrated into a number of lowland villages that were spread across the Island. As a result, the family unit became less important and life centred on individual village units. The Japanese government restricted hunting practices (mainly to control the use of firearms) and introduced wet rice cultivation. The Bunun Aboriginals under Chief (lāhè· āléi) engaged in guerilla warfare against the Japanese for twenty years. Raho Ari's revolt was sparked when the Japanese implemented a gun control policy in 1914 against the Aboriginals in which their rifles were impounded in police stations when hunting expeditions were over. The began at Dafen when a police platoon was slaughtered by Raho Ari's clan in 1915. A settlement holding 266 people called Tamaho was created by Raho Ari and his followers near the source of the Laonong River and attracted more Bunun rebels to their cause. Raho Ari and his followers captured bullets and guns and slew Japanese in repeated hit and run raids against Japanese police stations by infiltrating over the Japanese \\"guardline\\" of electrified fences and police stations as they pleased. Many Bunun were recruited as local policemen and during WWII, the Japanese army had Bunun regiments. Throughout the 20th century, several waves of missionaries of various denominations spread across Taiwan. They were particularly successful with the aboriginal inhabitants of the island and after the last missionary wave in the 1940s, that originated in Japan, a majority of aborigines were converted to Christianity. Today, most Bunun either belong to the Catholic Church or to the local Presbyterian Church. After the arrival of the Chinese Nationalist Kuomintang in October 1945, difficult days began for the aboriginal population. The \\"one language, one culture\\" policy of the Nationalist government prohibited to use of any language other than Standard Mandarin, for official use as well as in daily life, and indigenous cultures were systematically discriminated against and encouraged to assimilate into mainstream culture. Bunun culture was eroded by the joint pressure of their new faith as well as the government's sinification policies. The situation improved only recently after two decades of democratic reforms.  Culture  250x250pxAccording to Bunun legend, in times long past, two suns shone down upon the earth and made it unbearably hot. A father and a son endured numerous hardships and finally shot down one of the suns, which then became the moon. In its wrath, the moon demanded that father and son would return to their own people to tell them that they henceforth had to obey three commandments or face annihilation. The first was that they had to constantly observe the waxing and waning of the moon and conduct all rituals and work according to its rhythm. The second commandment stated that all Bunun had to conduct rituals throughout their lives to honor the spirits of heaven and earth. The third commandment told them of forbidden behaviours, and forced them to become an orderly and peaceful people. A variant of the story tells that long, long ago, a mother and father went out working in the field and took their newly born son with them. While working, they put the child in a basket at the side of the field, and for a whole day he lay in the unbearable heat of the two suns. When the parents returned in the late afternoon, they found that their son had completely dried up and turned into a black lizard. Stricken by grief, the father took his bow and shot down one of the suns. This story illustrates the importance of the sky in traditional Bunun animist religion. The Bunun assumed that the world in which they lived were full of supernatural beings (qanitu) that were often associated with particular places (trees, rocks, etc.). An important locus of supernatural power was the sky (dihanin/diqanin). All supernatural forces seem to have had a fairly abstract character and it is therefore not really clear whether the sky was a god or just a place in which all kinds of spirits lived. It is certain, however, that the moon was considered to be one of the major spirits, and almost all activities in daily life had to be aligned with the lunar calendar. This could go very far, for instance, in a certain lunar month it was forbidden for women to wash themselves. The Bunun are the only aboriginal people in Taiwan that developed a primitive form of writing to record lunar cycles and their relationship to important events such as the harvest or the slaughter of pigs. Bunun knives. The prescriptions related to the lunar calendar are part of a larger system of prescriptions and taboos that used to govern all aspects of Bunun life. Many of these had a ritualistic character and all were part of an age-based pecking order where an absolute obedience to one's elders was demanded. For instance, in order to determine whether a man could go hunting, he had to wait till one of the elders had had a prophetic dream (matibahi). If the dream was good, he could go out hunting. A bad dream indicated that great mishap would befall the hunter if he would go in the woods, and the elders would forbid him to go. Most of these rules got into disuse after the coming of Christianity (which branded them as superstition), but present-day Bunun society has still retained a number of social rituals and still imposes a strong obligation on children to behave in a respectful and obedient way towards anyone that is older than themselves. The Pasibutbut is a song of Bunun Sowing Festival, sung polyphonically in four-part harmony (Common 8 heterophonic voice, usually 5-12 heterophonic voices). The Taiwan composer Jin Fong Yang 楊金峯 analyzed the structure of this song. Japanese Musicologist Takatomo Kurosawa (黑澤隆朝) recorded with Bunun musicians in 1943.http://163.22.50.130/longbeauty/page_02.htmlhttp://taiwanpedia.culture.tw/web/content?ID=21359 The origin story of the Bunun people's tendency to live in mountainous areas was related by the wife of the American consul general in Yokohama in the following way:https://archive.org/details/nationalgeograp371920nati/page/290 Ear-shooting festival The ear-shooting festival is a male rite of passage ceremony in Bunun culture. The festival is usually held between March and April, and women are traditionally barred from attending. Before the festival, every adult male would journey to the mountains to hunt. Following a successful hunt, the men would return home and hang the carcasses from wooden frames so that the boys could shoot the dead animals. Those who could shoot a deer's ear were considered especially talented due to its small size. After this ritual, the participating boys were considered adults and could from then on join their brothers and fathers in the hunt. With modern lifestyle changes in Bunun society, the ear-shooting festival has become more of a ritualized performance; though the marksmanship and hunting skills taught through the festival are no longer as relevant, the event is still considered beneficial as it teaches respect for elders and the community at large.

E. Rolvaag House at St. Olaf College Ole Edvart Rølvaag (Rølvåg in modern Norwegian, Rolvaag in English orthography) (April 22, 1876 – November 5, 1931) was a Norwegian-American novelist and professor who became well known for his writings regarding the Norwegian American immigrant experience. Ole Rolvaag is most frequently associated with Giants in the Earth, his award-winning, epic novel of Norwegian immigrant homesteaders in Dakota Territory.Edvart Rølvaag John Heitmann (Norwegian-American Historical Association. Volume XII: Page 144) Biography Rølvåg was born in the family's cottage in a small fishing village on the island of Dønna, in Nordland county, Norway. Dønna, one of the largest islands on the northern coast of Norway, is situated about five miles from the Arctic Circle. He was born with the name Ole Edvart Pedersen, one of seven children of Peder Benjamin Jakobsen and Ellerine Pedersdatter Vaag. The settlement where he was born had no official name, but was referred to as Rølvaag, the name of a narrow bay on the northwestern point of the island where the fishermen kept their boats. At 14 years of age Rølvaag joined his father and brothers in the Lofoten fishing grounds. Rølvaag lived there until he was 20 years of age, and the impressions he received during the days of his childhood and his young manhood endured with him throughout his life.Edvart Rølvaag, 1876–1931 In Memoriam ( Julius E. Olson. Norwegian-American Historical Association. Volume VII: Page 121) An uncle who had emigrated to America sent him a ticket in the summer of 1896, and he traveled to Union County, South Dakota to work as a farmhand. He settled in Elk Point, South Dakota, working as a farmhand until 1898. With the help of his pastor, Rølvaag enrolled in Augustana Academy in Canton, South Dakota where he graduated in 1901. He earned a bachelor's degree from St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota in 1905, and a master's degree from the same institution in 1910. He also had studied for some time at the University of Oslo.E. Rølvaag: Norwegian-American. (Einar I. Haugen. Norwegian-American Historical Association. Volume VII: Page 53) Career In 1906, Rølvaag was recruited as a professor by St. Olaf College president John N. Kildahl. Rølvaag was made head of the Norwegian Department at St. Olaf in 1916. In 1925, Ole E. Rolvaag became the first secretary and archivist of Norwegian-American Historical Association. He held both positions for the rest of his life. Personal life In 1908 he became a United States citizen and married Jennie Marie Berdahl, the daughter of Andrew James Berdahl and Karen Oline Otterness. They had four children: Olaf, Ella, Karl and Paul. Their son, Karl Fritjof Rolvaag, served as the 31st Governor of Minnesota.Jennie Marie Berdahl (My Genealogy) Ole Rolvaag died November 5, 1931 in Northfield, MN. Literary style and themes Ole Rølvaag wrote in the Norwegian language, but his novels have a distinct American flavor and theme. Rolvaag was deeply influenced by earlier American writers who, writing in Norwegian, had faithfully portrayed the experiences of so many Norwegian immigrant pioneers. In this he was strongly influenced by Hans Andersen Foss and Peer Stromme, both of whom had written novels which provided realistic aspects of the homesteader's experience. The Emigrants by Norwegian author Johan Bojer, first published in 1925, follows many of these same themes. Rølvaag in turn provided an equally strong influence on future Scandinavian writers. Rølvaag attracted a number of gifted young Norwegian-Americans to St. Olaf College, among them Einar Haugen. Written decades later, Vilhelm Moberg's novels would depict the experience of Swedish-American immigrants.Rølvaag and Krause, Two Novelists of the Northwest Prairie Frontier by Arthur R. Huseboe, Augustana College The Viking Invasion: An Historiography of Norwegian-American Literature And Its Role In Norwegian Immigration And The Founding of Vesterheimen Within America (W. Scott Nelson. Humboldt State University May, 2005) Giants in the Earth Rølvaag's authorship and scholarship focused on the pioneer experience on the Dakota plains in the 1870s. His most famous book was Giants in the Earth (Norwegian: I de dage), part of a trilogy. It features the story of a Norwegian pioneer family's struggles with the land and the elements of the Dakota Territory, as they try to make a new life in America. It was based partly upon Rolvaag's personal experiences as a settler and as well of the experiences of his wife's family who had been immigrant homesteaders. The novel realistically treats the lives and trials of Norwegian pioneers in the Midwest, emphasizing their battles with the elements. The book also portrays the trials of loneliness, separation from family, longing for the old country, and the difficulty of fitting into a new culture.to the text edition of Giants in the Earth. Copyright 1929 by Harper and Brothers. The book was written in Norwegian and then translated into English. The book reads as an American novel but stems from an Old World literary tradition. It provides dramatic contrast between Per Hansa and his wife, Beret. Per is a natural pioneer who sees promise flooding the windswept plains. Beret hungers for the ways of her homeland, and in her heart, loneliness gathers and penetrates the deeper reality of life lived on the American frontier. Giants in the Earth served as the basis for an opera by Douglas Moore and Arnold Sundgaard that won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1951.Giants in the Earth, Libretto by Arnold Sundgaard after Rolvaag.

La Marche first appeared as a separate fief about the middle of the 10th century, when William III, Duke of Aquitaine, gave it to one of his vassals named Boso, who took the title of count. In the 12th century, the countship passed to the family of Lusignan. They also were sometimes counts of Angoulême and counts of Limousin. With the death of the childless Count Guy in 1308, his possessions in La Marche were seized by Philip IV of France. In 1316 the king made La Marche an appanage for his youngest son the Prince, afterwards Charles IV. Several years later in 1327, La Marche passed into the hands of the House of Bourbon. The family of Armagnac held it from 1435 to 1477, when it reverted to the Bourbons. In 1527 La Marche was seized by Francis I and became part of the domains of the French crown. It was divided into Haute Marche and Basse Marche, the estates of the former continuing until the 17th century. From 1470 until the Revolution, the province was under the jurisdiction of the parlement of Paris.

These indigenous peoples have been more commonly recognized as the Yami people, following Japanese anthropologist Torii Ryuzo's coining of the name. However, as a collective, these Orchid Island inhabitants typically prefer \\"Tao people\\" as their group identifier. They are part of the Austronesian family, and designated members of the Taiwanese indigenous peoples. Despite being linked to both indigenous Taiwanese and Filipino populations, the Tao people remain unique in their customs and cultural practices. Composed of approximately 3,100 individuals, the island populace relies heavily on fishing for survival. The Tao people's emphasis on fishing and ocean culture reflects their intense connection to the sea as being about much more than survival; they use fishing and the building of boats as an extension of themselves, and as a way to honor their spiritual beliefs. Their ways of life have been threatened by the continued emigration to the mainland of Taiwan in search of jobs and education. As a result, the continuation of past traditions has been hindered. Citing threats to their cultures and health concerns, the Tao people have been protesting the nuclear waste plant imposed on their island by the government in 1982 and advocating for its removal.  Origin  The origin of the Tao people is largely unknown. However they are presumed more closely related to individuals of the Philippines than those of Taiwan. A common theory tracing their ancestry posits that their ancestors left the Batan Archipelago in the Philippines, and made home of Orchid Island approximately 800 years ago. This reasoning is based primarily on the language similarities of the Batanese and the Tao people. Also, it appears that these two groups traded goats, pigs, weapons, and gold until about 300 years ago due to continuous warfare. However, there is still no certainty as to how the Tao people began their lives on Orchid Island. In addition to the Tao people of Orchid Island, there is a growing population of Taiwanese and Chinese individuals. These populations add approximately 1,000 people to the number of inhabitants on the island. Name Traditional Tao dwelling built partially underground. The word \\"Tao\\" simply means \\"people\\" in the language of the Tao people. The word Yami originated from Japanese ethnologist Torii Ryūzō. He used the term to refer to the culture and language of the Tao People. In recent years, some Tao people have rejected the name, but opinion remains divided. While this indigenous group identifies collectively by the name Tao or Yami, individual communities on the island affiliate with unique names tied to their locality. Language The language of the Tao people can be referred to simply as Tao or Yami. It is a Malayo-Polynesian language, a subgroup of Austronesian languages. More specifically, it is considered a Western Malayo-Polynesian language, one of two primary branches in the Austronesian subgroup—the other being Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian. As of 1994, there were a total of 3,000 speakers, and 3,255 individuals deemed ethnically Yami.  Geography  Orchid Island, also referred to as Lanyu or Pongso no Tao (Island of the People), is located approximately 40 miles off the southeastern coast of Taiwan, and directly north of the Batanes Islands of the Philippines. It is a small island of about 45 square kilometers with an estimated total population of 4,000 inhabitants. It was originally referred to as Hongtou Island (Red Head Island), however was officially renamed Orchid Island in 1947 for its rich orchid produces. There are very few plains on the island, instead its geography is composed of steep mountains and hilly terrain. Most villages are located at mountain bases, because river run-off is considered an ample source of fresh water.  History  Old photo of the Tao people on the shore of Orchid Island, near Taiwan published in a Japanese colonial government publication, ca. 1931. In 1877, the Qing Dynasty claimed Orchid Island as part of its Chinese empire, but was unable to rule effectively. The island was ceded to Japan along with Taiwan in 1895. Japan's rule of the island lasted from 1895 to 1945. During this time, the government declared the island off limits to outsiders, and deemed it an ethnological research area. The Japanese government heavily monitored any outside influence that might drastically interfere with the Tao people's ways of life. As a result, the Tao people remain the most primitive of Taiwan's aboriginal societies. Following Japan's defeat in World War II, the Republic of China took control of Orchid Island in 1945. Tourism was introduced to the island in 1967, and the Tao people were introduced to a new variety of modernization. CultureRitual and Religion= Due to westernization, their indigenous beliefs have melded with Christian practices. As a result, they have a belief system made of components from ancestral beliefs and Christian ideologies. Ancestral Tao belief systems consisted of several layers, each host to a variety of gods and spirits. The first layer is home to the main god, Simo-Rapao, who oversees all other gods. According to Tao mythology, he created the Earth's first two individuals from a piece of rock, and a piece of bamboo. He doles out punishment, and is responsible for all natural calamities that affect the island. Sio-Mima is native of the second layer of the Tao cosmogony. He is believed to control the rest of the world, deemed dominated by white people. The third level is home to Si-Toriao and Si-Lovolovoin. Si Toriao allegedly controls the rain and lightning, while Si-Lovolovoin serves as a messenger to all of the gods. In the final layer of their ancient religious belief system resides the malevolent gods who may punish the Tao peoples with invasions of caterpillars and locusts. Ancestral Tao people believed that goddesses were responsible for the birth of their children. According to their lore, there were separate goddesses for each gender. These goddesses dictated the births and lifetimes of the Tao populace. The length of an individual's life was determined by cracking a coconut and the measurement of the outpouring juice. While their ancestral religious system was based on the dictation of gods, the Tao people rarely adhere to such a stringent belief system today. Instead, their belief system is intermixed with components of Christianity and remnants of their beliefs past. Today, many Tao people have converted to a Christianity (especially branches of Catholicism and Protestantism). However, much of their traditional Christian ideologies are muddied with adherence to ancient superstitions. The Tao people greatly fear anito, the collection of evil spirits, even more than they worship an omnipotent God. They believe that when an individual passes away, his or her soul travels to Malavang a Pongso, the White Island, while the rest of the minor souls from within become anito. As a result of this belief, they have an uncontrollable fear of the dead. When a Tao individual is near death, relatives and friends stand beside his or her deathbed in full battle regalia in order to fight off evil spirits. Once the funeral has commenced, attendees catch crab and fish to be cooked and eaten on that day in remembrance of the deceased. There is no specific ceremony for the entrance into adulthood. A boy is considered an adult when he reaches the ages of 18 or 19, while a girl is considered an adult when she turns 16 or 17. A Tao man is deemed eligible for marriage when he participates in a fishing team, and can accomplish his fishing duties on his own. For women, they have to be proficient at taro cultivation and fabric weaving. Once the two parties are of marrying capabilities, relatives of both families formally propose to the woman's parents through the giving of presents. If her parents accept these offerings, they equivocally accept the proposal. = Fishing and Ceremony = The tatala, traditional Tao boats. The Tao peoples divide their year into three separate fishing seasons: rayon, teyteyka, and amyan. Rayon is equivalent to spring, and spans from February to May. This is considered to be flying fish season, during which the men catch fish for ceremonial use. Teyteyka lasts from June to October, and signifies the end of the period of time in which flying fish can be caught on the surface. Finally, the amyan season signifies the time of year spent waiting for the flying fish to return. This season lasts from November to January. During the latter two seasons, fish cannot be caught for ceremonial use. During these off seasons, the Tao people are charged with producing goods and recreation. Fishing is the main way in which Tao men can make a living on the island. A crucial component of Tao life centers upon the building of their fishing boats. As a device used for their sole method of securing sustenance and monetary gain, they place great emphasis on the production of these boats. They make their boats using multiple wooden planks shaped with an ax. Due to their boats not being made from a single tree trunk or log, they cannot be considered canoes. They join the wooden planks together with dowels and rattan. Once they have successfully constructed the boat, they carve patterns and paint them using the traditional red, white, and black. They then adorn the bow and stern of the boat with chicken feather decorations. The hull of the boat typically consists of three main patterns: human figure, eye of the boat, and waves. The human figure symbolizes heroism through the representation of the earliest Tao man. The eye of the boat consists of a variety of concentric circles edged with triangles. Their composition represents the sun's rays, and is considered to ward off evil spirits that may cause disasters at sea. They typically make boats to seat 1-3 people, 6 people, 8 people, or 10 people. However, no matter the size of the boat, the shape remains consistent. The bow and the stern of the boat are both steep, upward arcs that allow for stability and sharp turns. They consider a boat an extension of man's body, and thus boat building is deemed a sacred mission. For the Tao, boat building is the ultimate creation of beauty. Once the building of the boat is completed, the boat's owner will host a large launching ceremony. To celebrate, Tao women wear their agate beads necklaces and octagonal wooden hats a few days prior to the actual event. On the actual day of the launching ceremony, the Tao people gather and slaughter pigs as sacrifice, and the boat owner offers meat and taro to all of the families in his community. The men, dressed in traditional garb, circle the launching boat performing ceremonial rituals to ward off evil spirits before sending it into the water. They also throw the boat in the air several times prior to launch. The ceremony is deemed complete once the boat has remained afloat. = Attire and Dress = Helmet made of tin. Traditional Tao garb consists of simple, uni-colored fabrics made of natural plant fibers. Due to the nature of their fishing tasks, men typically only wear a loincloth and collarless vest. This also helps them to better cope with the stifling heat. Women's dress typically consists of a cloth or short vest to cover their upper body, and an apron-like cloth to cover parts of their lower body. For special or ceremonial occasions, men and women wear blue and white vests in addition to vibrant accessories, such as an octagonal wooden hat for women, and silver helmets for men. During funerals and times of mourning, women wear their upper garments inside out, and men wear a piece of cloth, reverse side out, on their heads. It is also considered taboo to wear clothing with an odd number of blue or black stripes. Therefore, clothing patterns typically consist of 8 to 12 stripes. Neither in ritualistic or everyday situations do the Tao people wear shoes.  Diet  The Tao peoples' production methods are divided into two primary categories: agriculture and fishing. Due to taro's ability to grow in a wide array of climates, it is a vital part of the Tao diet. The Tao people plant taro on the narrow coastal plains, and thus their diet consists of wetland taro and taro sweet potatoes. Their food is divided into two groups: kanen and yakan. Kanen is considered an entree similar to rice, while yakan is deemed a side dish. Women are charged the task of collecting and cooking the kanen, while men are supposed to search for the yakan. A crucial aspect of the Tao daily diet is seafood. While men are primarily charged with fishing duties, women are responsible for gathering shells, seaweed, and smaller fish from holes along the shore. The men practice both spear and net fishing as means for sustenance. All fish is categorized as either rahed or oyod. Rahed fish is deemed bad, and thus only eaten by the men. While the oyod fish is considered the real fish and can be eaten by both men and women.  Government Relations  The Tao people are members of the Council of Indigenous Peoples, a Taiwanese cabinet-level government body that serves the needs of the country's indigenous populations. They are one of sixteen aborigine populations represented by the council. The Tao people have no formal hierarchical structure. When disputes arise, the involved families are called upon to resolve the situation. While social affairs are governed by the male heads of families and members of the fishing community. In 1967, the Taiwanese government stepped in to provide the Tao people concrete homes, an act which the aboriginal community deemed an affront to their culture. However, most Tao live in these homes now with the addition of open-air pavilions. Due to the island's relative remoteness, it lacks the equivalent infrastructure in transportation, health care or education in comparison to the main island. However, in 2007 an official of the Council of Indigenous Peoples stated that it would raise its budget to help the aboriginal groups of Taiwan.  Nuclear waste  The Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) completed construction of Orchid Island's nuclear waste storage facility in 1982. The facility houses waste from Taiwan's three operating nuclear power plants. Since its constrution, 98,700 barrels of waste have been deposited on the island. Since its construction, the storage facility has been met with opposition. Due to language barriers, the Tao people were not aware that a nuclear storage facility was being erected on their island. During its construction, workers told the islanders that they were building a food cannery that would help the local economy. In 1987, when the Tao people finally learned of the dangers of nuclear waste, they began protests that lasted for more than twenty years. In the decades since the storage facility was constructed, there have been reports of increased cancer rates. In 2007, Taipower promised to remove all nuclear waste by 2016.

They consist of six communities residing in southern Taiwan (Budai, Labuan, Tanan, Maga, Mantauran, and Tona), each of which has its own dialect of the Rukai language. As of the year 2014, the Rukai numbered 12,699, and is the seventh-largest of the 13 officially recognized indigenous groups in Taiwan. The Rukai were formerly called Tsarisen or Tsalisen, which means \\"people living in the mountain\\". The Rukai people honor the mainland clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) and the hundred pacer (Deinagkistrodon acutus), which they believe to be the spirit of their ancestor.Chinese Wikipedia article on the Rukai People Traditional dress and textile Taiwan in 1901, with the Rukai marked as \\"Tsalisen Group of Savages\\" in the southern part of the island. The traditional dress of Rukai people has many similarities with that of the Paiwan people, probably due to the similarity of their geographical distribution and hereditary aristocratic social structure. The traditional dress and textile of the Rukai people also possesses original and distinctive qualities and characteristics. Rukai people’s dress include both ceremonial attire and casual wear. Men's ceremonial attire includes headwear with insignia, headscarves, tops, skirts, shawls, and leggings, while women wear garlands, headscarves, earrings, necklaces, lazurite necklaces, bead bracelets, arm rings, long gowns, skirts, girdles, leggings, and shoulder ornaments. In terms of casual wear, men wear leather headgear, headscarves, tops, shoulder straps, girdles, leather raincoats, deer hide coats, deer hide leggings, tobacco bags, and gunpowder bags, while women wear headscarves, long robes, skirts, leggings, gloves, mesh belts, leather raincoats, and cloth bags. Rukai social structure, hereditary aristocracy, is reflected in every facet of their lives, including attire. Generally, only the nobility are permitted to dress up and the commoners dress plainly and simply, although commoners can buy jewels from the nobility, usually bartering with pigs, millet, and pots. The nobility used to buy cotton, silk and woollen from the Han people to make clothes. = Cloth making and dyeing= Like the traditional dress of all other indigenous groups in Taiwan, the traditional dress of Rukai people uses cloth made by the squared cloth system. The main tool is the horizontal loom and the traditional material of the Rukai dress is linen, but under the influence of the Han people they have also begun using cotton and wool. Rukai people make linen from flax and use a horizontal loom with a strap to weave the linen into exquisite and beautiful cloth, and then sew pieces of cloth together to make garments. Making cloth is a duty particular to women in Rukai society, and when women are making cloth in a little house, men cannot enter. The cloth is usually dyed red, yellow, brown, dark blue or green with dyes made from herbs or plants. The red colorant is extracted from the root of a specific vine by chopping the roots into pieces and soaking them in water. The yellow colorant usually comes from ginger root juice. The brown colorant comes from the Dioscorea matsudae, and is extracted with the same method used to make the red dye. The dark blue dye comes from the leaf juice of a plant called danadana, and the green colorant comes from the leaf juice of a plant called rasras. =Four manufacturing techniques= Traditionally, the Rukai people’s dresses were made entirely by hand, which required the meticulous and lengthy hand work of fine craftsmen. Even though nowadays it is becoming more and more common to use computer scanning programs to design the cut and style of the clothes, and apply the embroidery and other details mechanically, handmade embroidered garments remain the most valued kind of attire among the Rukai. There are four essential manufacturing techniques: # Inlay. Inlay is a technique that using different colors of linens as weft to knit through the other linens as warp in order to create geometry patterns in the cloth. # Stitch embroidery. Traditionally, Rukai people use needles made of bamboo for stitch embroidery, but since the Han people introduced the metal needles into Taiwan, like the other indigenous people in Taiwan, Rukai people use metal needles instead. In the old days, the stitch lines used by Rukai people came from the colorful cloth brought from the plain and they got the stich lines by tearing the colorful cloth apart, until period of the Japanese colonization could they directly brought the stitch lines. There are five methods of embroidery used by the Rukai people, cross-stitch embroidery, chain stitch embroidery, straight stitch embroidery, circle stitch embroidery, and satin stitch embroidery. Among them, the satin stitch embroidery is the most delicate technique, requiring the most meticulous hand work, and the technique can only be found in Rukai traditional dress. There is no restriction of direction while embroidering, but every stitch line, whether long or short, should be placed side by side tidily. Overlapping and gaps between them are forbidden. If the embroiderer makes one mistake, she has to undo it and embroider it from the beginning. # Pearl embroidery. Traditionally, Rukai people used glass beads with a single color to design a pattern and then embroidered it on the cloth. Nowadays, plastic beads are more commonly used. # Patch embroidery. Rukai people usually cut the black cloth in a particular pattern and then sew it onto the white or blue cloth; or cut the white cloth in a particular pattern and then sew it onto the black cloth. =Patterns= The patterns of the Rukai people's traditional dress include the sun, hundred pacer, snake, human head, human figure, string, pig, rhombus, and deer patterns, but the sun and the hundred pacer pattern are the most popular ones. The rhombus pattern, which Rukai people regard as the symbol of the hundred pacer, is usually made with satin stich embroidery. The anise star pattern, signifying holiness, is usually made with cross-stich embroidery. Two sun patterns, considered a sign of the aristocracy, are normally embroidered on the breast area of the nobles’ dresses. The snake, human head, and human figure patterns are usually made with patch embroidery. =Headhunting= According to a Rukai informant in Wutai, Pingtung, the Rukai themselves did not practise headhunting, meaning they would specifically hunt their enemies' heads. Rather, when an enemy intruded into their living space, they would cut off their enemy's head, and then return to their village, carrying the head with them. This was the law of the land. However, they would not enter the village with the head, but rather take it to a special, nearby place where they would perform a solemn prayer. The head belonged to their enemy, but human life was special and needed to be respected. Though, the act of taking a head in defense of your tribe meant you were brave. The idea the Rukai intentionally attacked their enemies to take their heads, and hence that they were headhunters, is an issue the informant felt needs to be addressed.

His grandfather Henry Onderdonk was the Headmaster of Saint James School in Maryland, from which Julian's father Robert graduated. He was raised in South Texas and was an enthusiastic sketcher and painter. As a teenager Onderdonk was influenced and received some training from the prominent Texas artist Verner Moore White who also lived in San Antonio at the time. He attended the West Texas Military Academy, now the TMI Episcopal, graduating in 1900. Career At 19, with the help of a generous neighbor, Julian left Texas in order to study with the renowned American Impressionist William Merritt Chase. Julian's father, Robert, had also once studied with Chase. Julian spent the summer of 1901 on Long Island at Chase's Shinnecock Hills Summer School of Art. He studied with Chase for a couple of years and then moved to New York City to attempt to make a living as an en plein air artist. While in New York he met and married Gertrude Shipman and they soon had a daughter, Adrienne. Onderdonk returned to San Antonio in 1909, where he produced his best work. His most popular subjects were bluebonnet landscapes. Onderdonk died on October 27, 1922 in San Antonio. President George W. Bush decorated the Oval Office with three of Onderdonk's paintings.George W. Bush, Decision Points, London: Virgin Books, 2010, p. 107 The Dallas Museum of Art has several rooms dedicated exclusively to Onderdonk's work. His art studio currently resides on the grounds of the Witte Museum. Harry A. Halff and Elizabeth Halff spent twenty years gathering his works into a book they published called Julian Onderdonk: A Catalogue Raisonne.

During March 1934, Hitler authorized the Blood Order to commemorate the 9 November 1923 coup attempt of the Nazi Party. The medal is silver, with the obverse bearing a depiction of an eagle grasping an oakleaf wreath. Inside the wreath is the date 9.Nov. and to the right is the inscription München 1923–1933. The reverse shows the entrance of the Feldherrnhalle in relief (where the coup ended in defeat), and directly above is the angled swastika with sun rays in the background. Along the top edge is the inscription: UND IHR HABT DOCH GESIEGT (and you have won after all). History The first issue of the decoration, struck in 99% pure silver, was awarded to 1,500 participants in the putsch who had also been members of the Nazi Party or one of its formations before January 1932 (continuous service), or had been cadets from the Munich Infantry School who marched in support of Ludendorff.Since it was illegal under the Weimar Republic for members of the Armed Forces to belong to political parties, the former cadets, as military officers, would have been unable to join the Nazi Party. Most of the cadet recipients were never in fact Nazis. All medals were numbered (except Hitler's and Göring's) and awarding was done very carefully. Unlike other medals, the ribbon was worn on the right breast of the uniform tunic in the form of a rosette and the medal sometimes was pinned on and suspended below. In May 1938, to the dismay of the putsch participants, the award was extended to persons who had (a) served time in prison for Nazi activities before 1933, (b) received a death sentence which was later commuted to life imprisonment for Nazi activities before 1933, or (c) been severely wounded in the service of the Party before 1933; subsequently it was further extended to members of the Austrian Nazi Party who had participated in the 1934 February Uprising or July Putsch, or who had received significant prison time or injuries for Nazi activities. It could also be bestowed on certain other individuals at the discretion of Adolf Hitler, the last recipient being Reinhard Heydrich (posthumous). These subsequent medals were struck in 80% silver with serial numbers above 1500 and did not carry the maker's name (J. FUESS MÜNCHEN) as the Type I medals did. If a holder of this medal left the party, the medal would have to be relinquished. In total 16 women received the award, two from the 'Altreich' (Eleonore Baur and Emma Schneider) and 14 from Austria. Given the number of original marchers in the putsch, the number of awards given under the 1938 extensions (436), and the awards for outstanding service under those same extensions, the total number of recipients numbered fewer than 6,000. In November 1936, Hitler gave new \\"orders\\" for the \\"Orders and Awards\\" of Nazi Germany. The top NSDAP awards are listed in this order: 1. Coburg Badge; 2. Nürnberg Party Badge of 1929; 3. SA Treffen at Brunswick 1931; 4. Golden Party Badge; 5. Blood Order; followed by the Gau badges and the Golden HJ Badge.Dombrowski, Hanns (1940).

The community is in an arid, sparsely populated part of the state, along Oregon Route 140, about east of Lakeview. The Warner Valley surrounding Adel contains many marshes and shallow lakes, most of them intermittent. Frequented by Native Americans for many thousands of years, the valley became a region of sheep grazing and cattle ranching by the late 19th century. Adel's infrastructure includes a combined store/restaurant/bar, a post office (serving Zip Code 97620), an elementary school, and a church. Hot springs and related geological features have made one of the nearby ranches a potential site for a geothermal power station. History Adel School in 2015 People have lived in the Warner Valley for more than 10,000 years. Evidence of Native American occupation includes petroglyphs, hunting blinds, flakes from obsidian tools, and other material artifacts. By historic times, the Kidütökadö band of Northern Paiute frequented the valley and the uplands of Hart Mountain, the fault block ridge to the east. The Euro-American settler community of Adel developed in the late 19th century around sheep grazing and small cattle ranches. Catholics from Ireland found work here as shepherds; their surnames and their churches are part of the regional heritage. A stagecoach line connected early Adel to Fort Bidwell in northern California and offered transportation three times a week. J. J. Monroe owned the Adel store. The Adel post office was established in 1896 and was either named for a former sweetheart of the owner of the land on which it was established or for a local cow, Leda, but with the spelling reversed. Mail service at that time was limited to three days a week. Crump Lake, immediately north of Adel, is named after Thomas Crump (1854–1939), who settled here in the 1890s.Oregon Geographic Names, p. 257 The lake, toward the southern end of a north–south chain of marshes and mainly intermittent lakes, covers about with a shoreline of about . In 1959, two days after the Nevada Thermal Power Company drilled a well on the Crump family property, a continuous geyser of steam and hot water began shooting into the air. However, during the 1960s the Crump Geyser became plugged with rocks, though it continued to emit steam. In the 21st century, the site's geoelectric potential makes it a candidate for a power station. The state's first geothermal plant began operation at the Oregon Institute of Technology in Klamath Falls in 2010. Another went online near Vale in 2012 and another, near Paisley, in 2014. Geography Adel Store, at the north end of Twentymile Road Adel lies along Oregon Route 140 about east of Lakeview in south-central Oregon. From its intersection with the main highway, Plush–Adel Road runs north along the eastern shore of Crump and Hart lakes in the Warner Valley while Twentymile Road runs south from Adel to northern California just east of that state's border with Nevada. Deep Creek, flowing east from the Warner Mountains, passes through Adel into marshlands and Pelican Lake before entering Crump Lake. Adel is above sea level. To the northeast, the Hart Mountain ridge rises to . The region is moderately geologically active with a retired geyser and several hot springs. Geothermal exploration at the Crump Geyser site in 2010 found hot springs with temperatures as high as , two shallow wells with temperatures to , and a parent source of up to . Climate This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Adel has a steppe climate, abbreviated \\"BSk\\" on climate maps. Total annual precipitation in Adel averages about . The warmest month is July, with an average maximum temperature of . The coldest months are December and January, when the average lows are about . Education Adel School District 21 is one of five school districts comprising the Lake County Education Service District. Adel School, grades 4–8, shares students with Plush School District 18, grades K–3. The two schools combined have about a dozen students. For grades 9–12, the students generally attend Lakeview High School or Paisley School.

The Thao/Ngan people numbered around 800, making them one of the smallest of all of the recognized indigenous peoples in Taiwan (a number of indigenous peoples, both smaller and larger than the Thao in population, remain unrecognized by the Taiwanese government).Ita Thao: Introduction Despite their small group size, the Thao/Ngan have retained their customs, beliefs and traditional culture and language until now, though they have been assimilated into mainstream culture as well. Most of the members of this ethnic group work in the tourism industry at Sun Moon Lake. The Chi-Chi earthquake of 1999 damaged or destroyed 80% of the houses of the Thao/Ngan. Language The Thao/Ngan people have their own language, the Thao language, which is nearly extinct and spoken by only a few, mostly elders, of the (already small) Thao ethnic population. The language has been sinicized. Most people who speak Thao are bilingual or trilingual and can speak Mandarin Chinese and/or Taiwanese as well. The Thao/Ngan language is classified as a Paiwan language, and a Formosan language which is a geographical subgroup of the much larger Austronesian language family. The Thao language has loanwords from the Bunun language, spoken by the Bunun ethnic group of which the Thao/Ngan cooperated with as well as intermarried. Mythology Here is the legend of why the Thao people live in the side of Sun Moon Lake. The ancestors originally lived on an island in the middle of Sun Moon Lake. They then saw a deer and wanted to eat it, so they chased it until they arrived in the side of Sun Moon lake. Then the deer ran into the water, leaving the Thao by themselves. They could only wait. The Thao people then slept at Sun Moon Lake. One of the elders dreamed of a fairy in a white cloak. He said to them \\"I am the deer that led you here. This place is your promised land. Please don't leave, because generations will come.\\" Official recognition On 15 August 2001, the Executive Yuan (Council) of Taiwan officially recognized the Thao/Ngan as the tenth ethnic group among Taiwan's Indigenous peoples. The Thao have been mistakenly regarded as the \\"Tsou\\" (a separate and different ethnic group of Aboriginals) since the time of Japanese occupation. The error was caused by both a misunderstanding of the legend saying that \\"the ancestors of Thao were from the mountain Alishan (Mountain A Li)\\" and the similar pronunciation of ‘Thao/Ngan’ and ‘Tsou’. Thus, the domain of the Thaos/Ngans had been registered as \\"Tsous from the flatlands of the mountains\\" under the nine ethnic groups of Taiwan’s Indigenous peoples.

While a plain jump cut typically involves a temporal discontinuity (an apparent jump in time), an axial cut is a way of maintaining the illusion of continuity. Axial cuts are used rarely in contemporary cinema, but were fairly common in the cinema of the 1910s and 1920s. An axial cut can be made with the use of a zoom lens, or physically moving the camera with a crane or camera dolly. The intervening footage (as the camera moves or zooms) is then removed while editing the film. Since footage is discarded, this technique works better for static shots. If action is involved, several takes will be required to get the necessary footage. Alternatively, a multiple-camera setup can be used, with the cameras showing the subject at different sizes. The footage from both cameras is then edited together to create the effect. As the cameras cannot occupy the same space, there will always be a slight deviation from the axis.

In the , Robina had a population of 23,106 people. Robina is one of the first master- planned residential communities in Australia.  Geography  The Robina Town Centre shopping centre, Bond University, Cbus Super Stadium and Robina Branch Library are located in Robina.  History  In 1980, Singaporean real estate developer Robin Loh a local property developer Arthur Earle purchased of land in the southern Gold Coast, west of Broadbeach. The acquired land, which had previously been used for grazing, would become the suburb of Robina. Engaging international urban designers Moshe Safdie and Robert Lamb Hart, Dr Loh formed the Robina Land Corporation, which spearheaded the development of Robina into a residential and commercial hub now home to more than 30,000 people and with a workforce 20,000 strong. Robina is considered one of Australia's most successful planned communities, and is one of the Gold Coast's fastest growing suburbs. In the decade from 2001 to 2011 Robina experienced population growth of 4.8 per cent per annum. The name Robina was officially gazetted on 11 May 1985. The name is a combination of \\"Robin\\" (Loh's given name) and \\"a\\" (for Arthur Earle). Robina State School opened on 29 January 1990. In the original plan, Kerrydale was to be a separate suburb zoned for a golf course, hotel, accommodation and public space to the south-east of the Robina Town Centre. Kerrydale was officially approved on 20 Ferurary 1989 and can be seen on maps of that period. However, it was legislated in the Local Government (Robina Town Centre Planning Agreement) Bill 1992 that Kerrydale would be amalgamated into Robina. On 19 May 1995 the boundaries of Robina were officially extended to absorb Kerrydale. Robina State High School opened on 29 January 1996.

Born in the Netherlands in the mid-16th century, Cordes began sailing for the Netherlands against Spain during the Eighty Years' War. Baltazar possibly arrived in the Pacific during the 1598 Magellano Company expedition attempting to circumnavigate South America. This expedition, under the command of Admiral Jacques Mahu, consisted of five ships. One of the vessels, the Liefde (\\"Love\\" or \\"Charity\\"), reached Japan in 1600, pilot William Adams among the surviving crew. He succeeded Captain Jurriaan van Bokholt (or Van Boekhout) who died around August 23, 1599 shortly after crossing the Straits of Magellan. In the late 1599, (whether this occurred before or after the capture of Chiloe is unknown), Cordes occupied the Spanish colony of Castro, Chile. In April 1600, with combined Dutch and native forces, Cordes organized the capture of the island of Chiloé off the coast of Patagonia (Chile). However, Cordes' forces suffered heavy losses upon the recapture of the city by the Spanish, executing all but 23 Dutch and over 300 natives (thought to be Huilliches). Cordes' ship, the Trouw (Faith), sailed to the Portuguese colony of Tidore, an East Indies trading post, with the surviving sailors, where they were imprisoned in January 1601.

He participated in the Battle of Guandu in 200 between Cao Cao and Yuan Shao. He also played a significant role in the defence of Hefei during the Battle of Xiaoyao Ford of 214–215 against the forces of Sun Quan. Early life and career Li Dian was from Juye County (), Shanyang Commandery (), which is in present-day Juye County, Shandong. His uncle, Li Qian (), was an influential man in the region and had thousands of retainers working under him in Chengshi County (乘氏縣; east of present-day Heze, Shandong).(李典字曼成，山陽鉅野人也。典從父乾，有雄氣，合賔客數千家在乘氏。) Sanguozhi vol. 18. During the Chuping era (190–193) in the reign of Emperor Xian of the Eastern Han dynasty, Li Qian and Li Dian led their followers to assist the warlord Cao Cao in suppressing the Yellow Turban Rebellion and they defeated the rebels at Shouzhang County (壽張縣; south of present-day Dongping County, Shandong). Li Dian and his uncle later followed Cao Cao in his campaigns against rival warlords such as Yuan Shu and Tao Qian.(初平中，以衆隨太祖，破黃巾於壽張，又從擊袁術，征徐州。) Sanguozhi vol. 18. When conflict broke out between Cao Cao and Lü Bu in 194, Cao sent Li Qian back to Chengshi County to reaffirm the support of the locals towards him. Lü Bu's subordinates Xue Lan () and Li Feng () tried to persuade Li Qian to defect to their side but Li Qian refused so they killed him. Cao Cao then gave command of Li Qian's troops to Li Qian's son, Li Zheng (), and sent some of his men to assist Li Zheng to attack Xue Lan and Li Feng. Li Zheng achieved victory over Xue Lan and Li Feng, and later helped to pacify the various counties in Yan Province. He was appointed as the Inspector () of Qing Province.(呂布之亂，太祖遣乾還乘氏，慰勞諸縣。布別駕薛蘭、治中李封招乾，欲俱叛，乾不聽，遂殺乾。太祖使乾子整將乾兵，與諸將擊蘭、封。蘭、封破，從平兖州諸縣有功，稍遷青州刺史。) Sanguozhi vol. 18. After Li Zheng's death, Li Dian was appointed as the Prefect () of Yingyin County (潁陰縣; in present-day Xuchang, Henan) and General of the Household (), and took over command of his cousin's troops. Li Dian was known to be very studious since he was a youth, and he showed little interest in military affairs. He read classics such as the Spring and Autumn Annals and the Zuo Zhuan. Cao Cao was pleased with Li Dian and wanted to test his abilities.(魏書曰：典少好學，不樂兵事，乃就師讀春秋左氏傳，博觀羣書。太祖善之，故試以治民之政。) Wei Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 18.

Cao Cao's campaigns against Yuan Shao and the Yuan brothers In 200, when the forces of Cao Cao and Yuan Shao clashed at the Battle of Guandu, Li Dian, along with his clansmen and subordinates, took charge of supplying Cao's forces at the frontline with food and equipment. After Yuan Shao was defeated, Cao Cao appointed Li Dian as a Major-General () and ordered him to garrison at Anmin ().(時太祖與袁紹相拒官渡，典率宗族及部曲輸穀帛供軍。紹破，以典為裨將軍，屯安民。) Sanguozhi vol. 18. Yuan Shao died in 202, after which his sons Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang started fighting over their father's territories. During the Battle of Liyang of 202–203 against the Yuan brothers, Cao Cao put Li Dian and Cheng Yu in charge of escorting food supplies to the frontline by crossing the Yellow River. Yuan Shang sent his subordinate Gao Fan () to station near the river bank to block Cao Cao's supply route. Cao Cao had instructed Li Dian and Cheng Yu to send the supplies by land if they could not cross the river. However, Li Dian gathered his men and told them, \\"Gao Fan's troops are lightly armoured and they block the water route. This shows that they are lax, so they can be overcome easily. The military does not act against orders, but they can make their own decisions if they feel they are doing something beneficial to the country. Let's take them out quickly.\\" Cheng Yu agreed with Li Dian, so they led their forces across the river to attack Gao Fan and defeated the enemy, thus securing the supply route across the river.(太祖擊譚、尚於黎陽，使典與程昱等以船運軍糧。會尚遣魏郡太守高蕃將兵屯河上，絕水道，太祖勑典、昱：「若船不得過，下從陸道。」典與諸將議曰：「蕃軍少甲而恃水，有懈怠之心，擊之必克。軍不內禦；苟利國家，專之可也，宜亟擊之。」昱亦以為然。遂北渡河，攻蕃，破之，水道得通。) Sanguozhi vol. 18. In 204, after the Battle of Ye against Yuan Shang's forces, Cao Cao sent Li Dian and Yue Jin to attack Yuan Shang's cousin and ally, Gao Gan, at Hu Pass (壺關; present-day Huguan County, Shanxi). Li Dian defeated Guan Cheng () at Changguang County (長廣縣; east of present-day Laiyang, Shandong), and was promoted to General Who Captures Barbarians () and made a Marquis of a Chief Village () for his achievements.(從圍鄴，鄴定，與樂進圍高幹於壺關，擊管承於長廣，皆破之。遷捕虜將軍，封都亭侯。) Sanguozhi vol. 18. Battle of Bowang In 202, Jing Province's governor, Liu Biao, sent Liu Bei north to attack Cao Cao when Cao was away on his campaigns in northern China. Cao Cao sent Xiahou Dun and Li Dian to lead an army to resist Liu Bei's forces. Liu Bei burnt his supplies and pretended to retreat. When Xiahou Dun wanted to pursue Liu Bei, Li Dian cautioned him, \\"There must be an ambush because the enemy is retreating for no reason. The roads to the south are narrow and the vegetation is very dense. We shouldn't pursue the enemy.\\" Xiahou Dun ignored Li Dian's warning and went off in pursuit of Liu Bei together with Yu Jin, while Li Dian remained behind. As Li Dian expected, Xiahou Dun and his men did fall into Liu Bei's ambush later but Li showed up with the remaining troops and rescued them. Liu Bei retreated when he saw that Li Dian's reinforcements had arrived.(劉表使劉備北侵，至葉，太祖遣典從夏侯惇拒之。備一旦燒屯去，惇率諸軍追擊之，典曰：「賊無故退，疑必有伏。南道窄狹，草木深，不可追也。」惇不聽，與于禁追之，典留守。惇等果入賊伏裏，戰不利，典往救，備望見救至，軍散退。) Sanguozhi vol. 18. Relocation of clansmen and close followers Li Dian had over 3,000 families in his clansmen and close followers, all of whom lived in Chengshi County (乘氏縣; east of present-day Heze, Shandong). He proposed to Cao Cao to have them relocated to Wei Commandery (魏郡; north of present-day Ci County, Hebei), Cao Cao's base of operations during his campaigns in northern China. Cao Cao laughed and asked Li Dian, \\"You admire Geng Chun and wish to emulate him, don't you?\\" Li Dian replied, \\"I'm humble and timid and my contributions are lowly, but the rewards I've received are too high, so I should have my entire clan join me in service so that I'll feel more deserving of the rewards. Besides, the chaos haven't ended yet, so it's better to keep them close to better control the Empire. I'm not emulating Geng Chun.\\" Li Dian's clansmen and close followers were then relocated to Ye (鄴; in present- day Handan, Hebei). Cao Cao was pleased and he promoted Li Dian to General Who Destroys Barbarians ().(典宗族部曲三千餘家，居乘氏，自請願徙詣魏郡。太祖笑曰：「卿欲慕耿純邪？」典謝曰：「典駑怯功微，而爵寵過厚，誠宜舉宗陳力；加以征伐未息，宜實郊遂之內，以制四方，非慕純也。」遂徙部曲宗族萬三千餘口居鄴。太祖嘉之，遷破虜將軍。) Sanguozhi vol. 18. Battle of Xiaoyao Ford After the Battle of Jiangling in 209, Cao Cao left Li Dian, Zhang Liao and Yue Jin to defend Hefei, a strategic location at the border between Cao Cao and Sun Quan's territories. Around 214, when Sun Quan led his forces to attack Hefei, Zhang Liao wanted to lead their troops out of the city to resist the enemy. However, Zhang Liao was aware that the three of them could not get along with each other and he was worried that they would not comply with his orders.(與張遼、樂進屯合肥，孫權率衆圍之，遼欲奉教出戰。進、典、遼皆素不睦，遼恐其不從， ...) Sanguozhi vol. 18. Zhang Liao said, \\"Our lord is away at war. By the time his reinforcements reach here, we're already done for. So he's actually instructing us to take advantage of the situation, when the enemy has just arrived and not fully gathered yet, to attack them and devastate their morale so as to calm our men and strengthen our defences. Victory or defeat, it all depends on this battle. Why are the two of you still hesitating?\\"(公遠征在外，比救至，彼破我必矣。是以教指及其未合逆擊之，折其盛勢，以安眾心，然後可守也。成敗之機，在此一戰，諸君何疑？) Sanguozhi vol. 17. Li Dian was moved and he said, \\"This is a national crisis. We'll see how your strategy works out. How can I allow my personal issues take precedence over my official duties?\\" Zhang Liao, Li Dian and Yue Jin then worked together and succeeded in defeating and driving away Sun Quan's much larger army. Li Dian was rewarded with an additional 100 taxable households in his marquisate, bringing the total number of households to 300.(典慨然曰：「此國家大事，顧君計何如耳，吾不可以私憾而忘公義乎！」乃率衆與遼破走權。增邑百戶，并前三百戶。) Sanguozhi vol. 18. Death Li Dian's biography in the Sanguozhi did not state when and how he died, but it is known that he died at the age of 36 (by East Asian age reckoning).(年三十六薨， ...) Sanguozhi vol. 18. His titles were inherited by his son, Li Zhen (). In 220, after Cao Pi (Cao Cao's son and successor) forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him and became the emperor of the state of Cao Wei, he awarded Li Dian the posthumous title \\"Marquis Min\\" (), which literally means \\"sympathetic marquis\\", in recognition of Li's merits at the Battle of Xiaoyao Ford. Li Zhen was awarded another 100 taxable households in his marquisate, while another of Li Dian's sons received the title of a Secondary Marquis and 100 taxable households.(子禎嗣。文帝踐阼，追念合肥之功，增禎邑百戶，賜典一子爵關內侯，邑百戶；謚典曰愍侯。) Sanguozhi vol. 18. Appraisal Li Dian's biography in the Sanguozhi mentioned that Li was known to be a keen and humble learner who respected the literati. He did not fight with others for merits, and he regarded official duties as more important than his personal affairs.(典好學問，貴儒雅，不與諸將爭功。敬賢士大夫，恂恂若不及，軍中稱其長者。) Sanguozhi vol. 18. Chen Shou, who wrote Li Dian's biography, praised Li for his noble and gentlemanly demeanour, and for his 'duty before self' attitude.(評曰：李典貴尚儒雅，義忘私隙，美矣。) Sanguozhi vol. 18.

After graduating from West Point and a brief service in the United States Army, he became the first Superintendent of the Virginia Military Institute on its establishment in 1839, and held that post until shortly before his death. His superintendency included the four years of the American Civil War, during which he served as a major general in the Virginia militia and a colonel in the Confederate States Army. Early life Inscription on the monument Smith was born in Norfolk, Virginia. He married Miss Sarah Henderson on June 9, 1835 at West Point, New York. They had seven children.Eicher and Eicher, p. 494. Smith graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1833 and served as a second lieutenant in the United States Army until he resigned his commission on May 1, 1836. Thereafter, he was a professor of mathematics at Hampden–Sydney College from 1836 to 1839. When the Virginia Military Institute was established in Lexington, board of trustees member John Thomas Lewis Preston successfully recruited Smith to be the school's first superintendent. By the time classes had begun on November 11, 1839, Preston had been appointed to the faculty, and he worked with Smith at VMI until retiring in 1882. Some time before the Civil War, he was appointed colonel in the Virginia Militia. Smith was the author of An Elementary Treatise on Algebra (1858) and co-author of The American Statistical Arithmetic, Designed for Academies and Schools (1845), Best Methods of Conducting Common Schools (1849) and College Reform (1850) and translator of An Elementary Treatise on Analytical Geometry (1860). Smith is also known as Sigma Nu International Fraternity's spiritual founder. American Civil War At the outbreak of the Civil War, Smith was appointed a Brevet Brigadier General in the Virginia Militia on April 24, 1861, then a colonel in the 9th Virginia Infantry Regiment on July 7, 1861. He was often absent and returned to VMI when it reopened in late 1861. He was dropped as colonel of the 9th Virginia Infantry Regiment in the reorganization of May 8, 1862Allardice, 2008, p. 347. and then was Colonel of the VMI Infantry battalion between April 30, 1862 and May 18, 1862, May 11, 1864 and June 27, 1864 and March 1865 and April 1865. At some date not shown in the references, possibly coincident with his appointment as \\"major general of cadets,\\" he was appointed a major general in the Virginia Militia. He was appointed \\"Major General of Cadets\\" on December 18, 1861 according to the inscription below his statue shown in the accompanying image. Regardless whether the date of that appointment coincided with the date of his appointment as major general in the Virginia Militia, his appointments in the Confederate Army were only to positions with the rank of colonel. Major General John C. Breckinridge was commanding Confederate forces in the Department of Southwest Virginia during a critical time in the 1864 campaign in the Shenandoah Valley.Warner, p. 34. Although he did not want to use the VMI cadets in battle, Breckinridge requested that Smith send them to reinforce his outnumbered army when Union forces began to move into the valley.Davis, pp. 28, 79, 88. On May 12, 1864, Smith sent almost the entire Corps of Cadets of VMI, leaving behind only 27 cadets to guard the Institute, to help hold off the advance of the Union Army under Major General Franz Sigel from the northern end of the valley.Davis, 1975, pp. 47-52. Smith, who was ill, also stayed behind.Davis, 1975, p. 49. The cadets were led by 24-year-old Commandant of Cadets and VMI teacher Scott Ship.Davis, 1975, pp. 49, 52-53. On May 15, 1864, the VMI Cadets earned distinction and fame at the Battle of New Market as the only Corps of Cadets in United States history to fight as a unit in battle.Davis, 1975, pp. 95-97, 121-124. Ten cadets were killed and forty-sevenAnother account states 45 cadets were wounded rather than 47. were wounded in their valiant defense of the center of the Confederate line at a critical point in the battle.Davis, 1975, pp. 121-124, 200. The Union forces were defeated and Sigel withdrew them to Mount Jackson and then to his headquarters at Cedar Creek, Virginia.Davis, 1975, p. 156. On June 11, 1864, Major General David Hunter, who had replaced Sigel after New Market, ordered a retaliatory attack, his troops burning and shelling VMI's campus, forcing the relocation of classes to Richmond, where they remained until the city fell in April 1865. Classes returned to the Lexington campus in October, after the conclusion of the war. Later life Smith oversaw the reconstruction of VMI after its destruction, and remained as superintendent until December 31, 1889. He died in Lexington on March 21, 1890, at the age of 77, and is buried in Stonewall Jackson Memorial Cemetery.

Early life Guerrero was born in Tucson, Arizona, one of 21 siblings (although only nine survived). His father worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad. Guerrero left his hometown to pursue his dream in music. He says that he gives his mother all the credit for his musical talent, and Guerrero said she taught him to \\"embrace the spirit of being Chicano\\". Lalo’s mother, Concepcion Guerrero, taught him some basic musical skills and encouraged him to hone them during adolescence. She was no professional musician but had taught herself to play guitar. His relationship with his mother greatly influenced his music; one of the major themes of his work was the visibility of the Chicana struggle for dignity. His first group, Los Carlistas (the quartet included Greg \\"Goyo\\" Escalante, Chole Salaz and Joe Salaz), represented Arizona at the 1939 New York World's Fair, and performed on the Major Bowes Amateur Hour on radio. He moved to Los Angeles in the 1940s, and had a few uncredited roles in movies, including Boots and Saddles and His Kind of Woman. He recorded for Imperial Records and fronted the Trio Imperial. He also formed his own orchestra and toured throughout the Southwest. He performed at the La Bamba club in Hollywood, a place frequented by the biggest stars in the movie business. In the 1960s, he bought a night club in Los Angeles and renamed it \\"Lalo's\\". In the 1940s he became a friend of the Ronstadt family of Arizona, in particular Gilbert Ronstadt, father of popular vocalist Linda Ronstadt. Linda recalls childhood memories of Guerrero serenading her. At his funeral, Linda sang a traditional Mexican song in tribute. Music Guerrero is known as the father of Chicano music.John Shepherd, David Horn Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Volume 8: 1441160787 2012 \\"The Emergence of Chicano Music It is appropriate that Eduardo 'Lalo' Guerrero be recognized as 'the father of Chicano music' (Guerrero and Meece Mentes 2002). He recorded and wrote many songs in all sorts of genres. He recorded over 700 songs since his first record in 1939 with Los Carlistas on Vocalion Records. As a songwriter Guerrero wrote songs for El Trio los Panchos, Lola Beltran and many other famous artists. His first American hit was \\"Pancho López\\", a parody of the popular 1950s hit \\"The Ballad Of Davy Crockett\\". Guerrero used the Davy Crockett melody and wrote his own lyrics, telling the story of a legendary Mexican character. Due to criticism Guerrero received over this song, he never performed it publicly, not wanting to contribute to an inappropriate stereotype. Guerrero went on to record several more parody songs, including \\"Pancho Claus,\\" \\"Elvis Perez,\\" \\"Tacos For Two\\" (to the tune of \\"Cocktails For Two\\"), and \\"There's No Tortillas\\" (to the tune of \\"O Sole Mio\\"). Guerrero's earliest Pachuco compositions of the 1940s and 1950s were the basis of the Luis Valdez stage musical, Zoot Suit. = Early career = Prior to WWII, he primarily played songs of Mexican origin. Guerrero explained that this was not necessarily because they were his favorite songs to play. \\"They couldn't conceive of a Mexican, especially one who looks as Indian as I do, sitting up there and singing Bing Crosby songs. So naturally the Anglos would get the jobs.... I reverted to singing Mexican music\\". =Labor songs= He also wrote songs about Cesar Chavez, other farm workers and braceros. Chavez said at tribute to Guerrero in 1992 in Palm Desert, California: \\"Lalo has chronicled the events of the Hispanic in this country a lot better than anyone.\\" He worked closely with Chavez for farm workers' rights and lent voice to the movement with the song, \\"No Chicanos On TV.\\" = WWII: Zoot Suit and Pachuca/o Subculture = During WWII, Mexican- American women known as Pachucas began to challenge societal norms in relation to gender, labor, communication and representation. These Pachuca/o citizens were living in a paradox, a reality with three options in regard to their Mexican Vs. American heritage. They could either; completely assimilate and adhere to white America’s definition of “American”, completely rebel and be labeled Mexican delinquents, or they could try to find a balance in which they did not abandon their cultural identities, but also upheld values that would characterize them as American. The last option listed was the choice of those Pachuca/os wearing Zoot Suits. They wished to be their own person, make it in society on their own terms, and embrace being bilingual and multicultural. This movement and ideology played a key role in determining our modern definition of what it means to be an American. “The struggle for dignity by zoot suiters was thus a politics of refusal: a refusal to accept humiliation, a refusal to quietly endure dehumanization, and a refusal to conform.” These women, fighting for dignity, recognition, and equality would form a collective movement marching forward to the anthem of Lalo Guerrero’s music. Guerrero’s music simultaneously evolved into the Zoot Suit/ Pachuca/o music of the 1940s and 1950s. His songs infused with Pachuco slang, a combination of informal Spanish and English, acted as a megaphone contextualizing the efforts of Chicanas. “His compositions about the pachuco era produced a string of hits and generated interest in the Pachuco dialect.” His Musical parodies such as, “Pancho Lopez” and “Mexican Mamas Don’t Let Your Babies Grow Up to be Busboys” invoke a comedic tone while also juxtaposing the American vs. Mexican-American experience. His emphasis on the gap between Anglo-American and Mexican- American goes hand in hand with the assertion of Chicanas that they are stuck in a paradox. Chicanas, during this time, sought to bridge the gap between the Anglo-American experience and the experiences of Mexican-Americans when it came to socioeconomic opportunity and equality. =Children's music= He also wrote children's songs presented via his \\"Las Ardillitas,\\" or \\"Three Little Squirrels\\", a Latin-American version of Ross Bagdasarian's \\"Alvin and the Chipmunks\\". In 1995 he recorded a children's album Papa's Dream with Los Lobos.Chris Morris Los Lobos: Dream in Blue 029274823X 2015 p.124 \\"The Chicano star—who of course had his own experience in the children's market with his Las Ardillitas records — became the narrator and centerpiece of Papa's Dream, which mated the music (curated by Eugene Rodriguez) with a script by Phillip Rodriguez and Al Carlos Hernandez. In keeping with its target audience, the narrative was thin but easy to follow: \\"Papa Lalo\\" (Guerrero) takes his \\"sons\\" (Los Lobos) and \\"grandkids\\" (the Children's Coro of Los Cenzontles Musical Arts Center of San Pablo) on a \\"Chicano blimp\\"... \\" =Collaborations= In 2005, Guerrero was one of several Chicano musicians who collaborated with Ry Cooder on Cooder's Chávez Ravine album, for which he provided vocals on three songs (\\"Corrido de Boxeo\\", \\"Los Chucos Suaves\\", and \\"Barrio Viejo\\") which helped bring him, at the twilight of his life, to the attention of a wider Anglo audience. Guerrero recorded his last full CD on Break Records, a Los Angeles-based record label, this at age 83. This would become his last music CD. The recording is a collection of Guerrero's best \\"Zoot Suit\\" compositions of Latin swing \\"Pachuco\\" music. The music CD was produced by music producer Benjamin Esparza, one of Guerrero's trusted friends during his last years. The Musical CD contained new recordings of his 1940s \\"Pachuco\\" swing music which was used in the Broadway play and Universal Pictures movie \\"Zoot Suit\\". The play was written and directed by Luis Valdez. The album, Vamos A Bailar-Otra Vez, was produced by Esparza and Justo Almario of Break Records.  Contributions to Mexican-American women’s rights  Lalo Guerrero was able to amplify the voices of the Pachuca/o and Chicana/o Movements by playing songs which represented their culture; one of Mexican and American heritage. “In a career that spanned la Crisis of the 1930s, the Zoot Suit Riots of the 1940s, the Chicano Movement of the 1960s, Guerrero embodied the essential humanity of the barrios (Spanish speaking low income areas). He transformed what he saw and heard as a young man on la Calle Meyer (Meyer St.) into songs that touched millions of people.” Guerrero’s music directly aided the ability of Mexican- Americans, especially women, to publicly demonstrate the duality of their heritage and helped to bring their culture into mainstream America.  Legacy  His career is somewhat symbolic of the various Mexican-American women’s rights movements. In the beginning of his career he was relegated to performing only Mexican songs in Spanish for audiences of Mexican descent. He, like the Chicanas and Pachucas, created something new, “…in a sense, Lalo was a greater artist than his predecessors because only he created his own music- music that made people laugh or cry, music that captured the jazzy spirit of a culture and a generation.” Lalo was able to successfully claim a public space for Chicano and Pachuco music and slang, as were the Chicanas and Pachucas. For most of his career, he was playing his music in other people’s clubs, just as the Chicanas were living their lives within other people’s guidelines. “Lalo remained in southern California after the war was over, singing in other people's nightclubs until 1956, when the success of \\"Pancho López,\\" his parody of \\"Davy Crockett,\\" enabled him to open Lalo's Place in East Los Angeles.” The opening of Lalo’s Place symbolizes the success Mexican Americans experienced in creating a space for themselves within American society, and progress in their quest to attain the opportunities of and be recognized as Americans but also respected as Mexican-American. =Tributes= Guerrero was officially declared a national folk treasure by the Smithsonian Institution in 1980 and was presented with the National Medal of Arts in 1996 by then United States President Bill Clinton. In 1991 Guerrero received a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. In late 2005 Guerrero was posthumously inducted into the Arizona Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame. Along with that he was also inducted into the Tejano Hall of Fame and the Mariachi Hall of Fame. Guerrero's contributions have resulted in Las Glorias, a restaurant in central Phoenix, Arizona displaying a poster of him with his signature on it on the wall for everyone to see in loving memory of him. He also has a blown-up, candid photograph of him as a young man on the wall of a major underpass in Tucson. In Cathedral City, California, the main street in front of the Civic Center is named for him: Avenida Lalo Guerrero. All official city documentation contains Lalo's name in the address. In 1994 a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars dedicated to him. Personal life and death Guerrero was married for over 34 years to his wife Lidia Guerrero. They both lived in Cathedral City, California for over 28 years. Guerrero died on March 17, 2005, in Rancho Mirage, California. He was 88 years old.

It is the administrative center of Mykolaiv Raion (district). Its population is approximately . To distinguish Mykolaiv from the much larger southern city, the former is sometimes called Mykolaiv on Dniester (, Mykolaiv nad Dnistrom)http://mykolaiv.info/vi-knizhkova-toloka-2012/vi- knizhkova-toloka-2012.-70-rokiv-upa.html after the major river it situated on (while the latter is located on the Southern Buh, another major river). The closest railway station is officially called Mykolayiv-Dnistrovsky. History The territory of modern Mykolaiv Raion, Lviv Oblast formed part of the Kingdom of Poland since the reign of King Casimir III the Great. For a short period, between 1370 and 1387, it was part of the Kingdom of Hungary, before being reintegrated with Poland. In 1570 near the former Polish royal village Drohowyż, chorąży (ensign) of Przemyśl, Polish nobleman founded the town which was named Mikołajów after him. The Topór coat of arms of the Tarło family is included within the town's coat of arms. By virtue of a privilege issued in February 1570, Polish King Sigismund II Augustus granted it Magdeburg town rights, established two annual fairs and exempted the town from taxes for 20 years.Słownik geograficzny Królestwa Polskiego i innych krajów słowiańskich, Tom VI, Warsaw, 1885, p. 403-404 (in Polish) It was a private town of Poland, its first owner was Mikołaj Tarło. In 1576, King Stephen Báthory confirmed these privileges and allowed the production of vodka. In 1593, after a fire, King Sigismund III Vasa exempted Mikołajów from taxes again. By 1595 it belonged to the Polish diplomat Jerzy Mniszech, who in 1607 founded a Catholic parish here. In 1636 the church of Saint Nicholas was consecrated. In 1772, following the First Partition of Poland, the town was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, where it remained until late 1918. In the interwar period, it returned to Poland, and belonged to the Stanisławów Voivodeship. After the invasion of Poland it was under Soviet occupation from 1939 to 1941. In June 1941 the NKVD murdered an unknown number of Poles and Ukrainians in a local prison. After that, the town was from 1941 to 1944 under German occupation. At that time, the Polish Home Army underground resistance movement operated here. During the second period of Soviet occupation in 1944–1945, the Soviets deported Polish inhabitants deep into the Soviet Union. After the war, in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, it was taken from Poland and annexed by the Soviet Union, where it was included in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.

Early life and career Alvord was born in Rutland, Vermont, where he developed an interest in nature. He attended the United States Military Academy and displayed a talent in mathematics. He graduated in 1833.Marquis Who's Who, Inc. Who Was Who in American History, the Military. Chicago: Marquis Who's Who, 1975. P. 9 He was assigned to the 4th U.S. Infantry and participated in the Seminole Wars. He returned to West Point as an assistant professor of mathematics until 1839, when he was again assigned to the 4th Infantry. He spent 21 years of his military career with that regiment. He was on frontier, garrison, and engineer duty until 1846, when he participated in the military occupation of the new state of Texas. Subsequently, he served during the Mexican–American War, being brevetted successively to captain and major for gallantry in a number of important battles including the Battle of Palo Alto and the Battle of Resaca de la Palma. He served as chief of staff to Major Folliott T. Lally's column on the march from Vera Cruz to Mexico City in 1847. He joined the Aztec Club of 1847 in 1871. After the Mexican–American War, he went from line to staff when he was named paymaster and promoted to major. He was assigned to various posts and was sent with the 4th Infantry to the West Coast. He was the engineer in charge of building the military road in southern Oregon. He was then chief paymaster in Oregon from 1854 until 1862. Civil War service From 1862 to 1865, during the American Civil War, Alvord was at Fort Vancouver as the commander of the District of Oregon with the rank of brigadier general of volunteers. He was named to that post by George Wright, the commanding officer of the Department of the Pacific. Wright wanted an experienced Regular Army officer in that post, rather than a volunteer, since the District was large (encompassing the present-day states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho), underdeveloped, and had a history of friction between the native peoples and settlers. As commander of the District, Alvord built up the defenses around the mouth of the Columbia River, but was unable to do the same for Puget Sound. Because of low enlistments from Oregon and Washington, he supported the military draft, and failing that, supported the payment of bounties. He was removed from command in March 1865.Hubbell and Geary (p. 6) state he was removed because: Army commanding general, Ulysses S. Grant, thought Alvord ill-suited for command; Oregon's Representative, John R. McBride, accused him of being a \\"tool of anti-Union men\\"; and because of Alvord's support of the draft and bounties.Alvord apparently had heard rumors about his service and asked Department commander Irvin McDowell about them. In a letter dated April 12, 1865, McDowell wrote to Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton, addressing Alvord's concerns. McDowell praised Alvord and said that he was unaware of any negative remarks (War of the Rebellion, Series I, Vol. L, Part II, pp. 1193–1194) He was ordered to the East Coast, where he resigned his volunteer commission and became paymaster in New York City. Circles and spheres Alvord was interested in the classical problem of Apollonius, to find a circle tangent to three given circles, and the special cases of Apollonius' problem, as well as the generalization to spheres. In 1855 he published in Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge.B. Alvord (1855) Tangencies of Circles and of Spheres, Smithsonian Contributions, volume 8, from Google Books Posted to the remote Fort Vancouver, he continued his investigations and submitted his findings in 1860 but was frustrated by a fire. In 1882, when he found that there are 96 circles which cut four given circles at a fixed angle and there are 640 spheres which cut five given spheres at a fixed angle, he assembled all his results for an article in American Journal of Mathematics.B. Alvord (1882) The Intersection of Circles and the Intersection of Spheres, American Journal of Mathematics 5(1): 25–44 where he explained the delay: :All of this memoir, except the last two problems, were completed and sent to the Smithsonian Institute in January, 1860, from Fort Vancouver, Washington Territory, but the manuscript was burned in January 1865 when the upper story of the Smithsonian building was on fire.B.

He became Paymaster General of the Army in 1872 and served in that capacity until his retirement from active service in 1880. He was promoted to brigadier general in 1876. He also wrote on natural history, writing the first scientific description of the ability of the compass plant (Silphium laciniatum) to orient itself in a north-south direction, as well as writing about winter grazing in the Rocky Mountains.

It was used for harness racing. It had a capacity of 33,297 people and was built in 1946. The track was a half-mile oval. The track closed in 2015. The track, which had been in unincorporated Cook County, was located in Melrose Park. Demolition began in early 2019; the structures are to be replaced by an industrial and warehouse development.

Per a 1953 United States Tax Court ruling: \\"In 1931 the property was leased to the Cook County Fair Association, which constructed a spectators' grandstand and a one-half mile dirt oval track for harness races. Its attempt to operate a county fair was unsuccessful, however, and in 1934 petitioner ejected it from possession, but the track and the grandstand remained permanent improvements on the property.\\" In 1946, after parimutuel racing was granted in Illinois, Maywood Park opened as a dedicated harness-racing track.

The original grandstand was torn down in the mid-1960s and replaced with a larger, enclosed structure. The track received a number of additional race dates after Washington Park burned down. Two associations that raced at Washington Park (Egyptian Trotting and Associates Racing) moved their dates to Maywood Park following the destructive 1973 fire. In 1979, boxing champion Muhammad Ali won a seven-furlong exhibition race, a fundraising event to benefit Provident Hospital of Chicago. In 1984, Maywood Park became the first Chicago-area track to host a Breeders Crown race. The Two-Year-Old Filly Pace Final carried a $550,000 prize, the largest purse ever offered at a Chicago area standardbred track. Maywood Park has been the scene of numerous world records, including She's A Great Lady's 1:51.2 mile in 1995, a record that still stands for a three-year-old filly pacer on a half-mile track. The Maywood Park Trotting Association was subject to a federal judgment tied to the scandal that brought down former Illinois Rod Blagojevich, which forced the association into bankruptcy. The Galt Family Trust subsequently sold the land, and demolition began in 2019. Physical attributes The track had a half-mile dirt oval, and was capable of seating at least 33,297.

It is situated on the northeast corner of Lindsay Street and Yanceyville Avenue, northeast of the downtown area and near the campus of North Carolina A&T; University. It is currently the home of the NC A&T; baseball team of the NCAA Division I MEAC. It was the home of various local minor league baseball clubs off-and-on from 1930 through 2004. It also continues to be used for other amateur baseball events. It was also the home of A&T; football until Aggie Stadium was opened in 1981. History Game action in 1989 World War Memorial Stadium was dedicated on the 8th anniversary of Armistice Day, on November 11, 1926. At the time, there had of course only been the one World War. The stadium was originally built mostly with American football in mind, resembling a backwards \\"J\\" and with a running track. In 1930 the Greensboro \\"Patriots\\" of the old Piedmont League set up shop there, after a few decades at Cone Athletic Park (near the Cone Mills plant a couple of miles to the northeast), and made various improvements such as the installation of lights and a roof for the box seat area. The field was initially laid out with the diamond centered on the curved part of the \\"J\\", with short foul lines and a deep center field, like a very-scaled-down version of the Polo Grounds. Later the diamond was rotated clockwise and repositioned, and the field assumed a fairly normal shape except for right center, which was abnormally close due to the presence of a creek. The ballpark's age and its cramped quarters began to be a notable problem for the minor league club once the minor league explosion of the late 1980s and early 1990s was under way. Various cosmetic renovations were made, such as building a kind of stadium club (\\"The Grandstand\\") in the left field corner seats, as well as a fairly large concession stand outside the third base stands. The stadium also received many seats from Philadelphia's old Shibe Park after Shibe's demolition. Another issue was the condition of the field. With so many games being played there by the Patriots (later renamed the \\"Hornets\\" and then the \\"Bats\\") along with the college teams, the turf took a serious beating during the long hot North Carolina summer, and required frequent replacement with new turf. In order to put the city in a position to possibly upgrade to AA level ball, in the early 1990s the minor league club owners began lobbying for a new ballpark. Their efforts finally succeeded in the early 2000s, and the new First Horizon Park (now known as First National Bank Field) opened downtown in spring 2005. Archways and plaques WWMS plaque detail One of the stadium's notable features is an ornate, triple- arched entrance, which made a cameo appearance during the \\"road trip\\" segment of the 1988 movie Bull Durham. During the minor league club's tenure, the three arches were decorated with quarter-sphere awnings covered in red, white, and blue cloth respectively. The stadium has a pair of bronze plaques framing the archway and listing the area's war dead during 1917–1919. Close examination of the right-side plaque reveals that there were actually two alphabetical lists. Some sources say that this was a separation of white from \\"colored\\" in the conventional practice of the segregation era. The marker between the two lists was later roughly chiseled away. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.

Allen took a Japanese spy film, International Secret Police: Key of Keys, and overdubbed it with completely original dialogue that had nothing to do with the plot of the original film. By putting in new scenes and rearranging the order of existing scenes, he completely changed the tone of the film from a James Bond clone into a comedy about the search for the world's best egg salad recipe. During post- production, Allen's original one-hour television version was expanded without his permission to include additional scenes from International Secret Police: A Barrel of Gunpowder, the third film in the International Secret Police series, and musical numbers by the band The Lovin' Spoonful. This experience helped convince Allen that he should secure creative control for all his future projects. The band released a soundtrack album. Louise Lasser, who was married to Allen at the time, served as one of the voice actors for the \\"new\\" dialogue soundtrack, as did Mickey Rose, Allen's writing partner on Take the Money and Run (1969) and Bananas (1971). In 2003, Image released the film on DVD, with both the theatrical and television (called \\"alternate\\") soundtracks. Plot The plot provides the setup for a string of sight gags, puns, jokes based on Asian stereotypes, and general farce. The central plot involves the misadventures of secret agent Phil Moskowitz, hired by the Grand Exalted High Macha of Rashpur (\\"a nonexistent but real-sounding country\\") to recover a secret egg salad recipe that was stolen from him. The recipe, in the possession of gangster Shepherd Wong, is also being sought by rival gangster Wing Fat, and Moskowitz, assisted by two female Rashpur agents, temporarily teams up with Wing Fat to steal the recipe from Wong. The movie has an ending credits scene unrelated to the plot, in which China Lee, a Playboy Playmate and then-wife of Allen's comic idol Mort Sahl who does not appear elsewhere in the film, does a striptease while Allen (who is also on-screen) explains that he promised he would put her in the film somewhere. CastSoundtrack album The soundtrack album to What's Up Tiger Lily? was released in 1966. It contains music by The Lovin' Spoonful. The audio engineer at National Recording Studios was Fred Weinberg, who went on to produce and engineer many other films and albums. It was re-released on CD along with You're a Big Boy Now, the Spoonful's soundtrack for the 1966 film by Francis Ford Coppola. It reached No. 126 on the Billboard Pop Albums charts. =Track listing= # \\"Introduction to Flick\\" (2:14) # \\"Pow!\\" (2:26) # \\"Gray Prison Blues\\" (2:04) # \\"Pow Revisited\\" (2:26) # \\"Unconscious Minuet\\" (2:05) # \\"Fishin' Blues\\" (1:59) # \\"Respoken\\" (1:48) # \\"Cool Million\\" (2:02) # \\"Speakin' of Spoken\\" (2:41) # \\"Lookin' to Spy\\" (2:29) # \\"Phil's Love Theme\\" (2:23) # \\"End Title\\" (4:06) Reception The reviews were mixed upon the film's release.

Hein & Co., Inc. (WSH Co), a Buffalo, New York publisher specializing in legal materials. The company began in Buffalo, New York, in 1961 and is currently based in nearby Getzville, NY. In 2013 WSH Co. was the 33rd largest private company in western New York, with revenues of around $33 million and more than seventy employees. HeinOnline is a source for traditional legal materials (reported cases, statutes, government regulations, academic law reviews, commercially produced law journals and magazines, and classic treatises), historical, governmental, and political documents, legislative debates, legislative and executive branch reports, world constitutions, international treaties, and reports and other documents of international organizations. The database includes more than 100 million pages of materials “in an online, fully searchable, image-based format\\". New product award In 2001, HeinOnline received the coveted “New Product Award,” from the American Association of Law Libraries. Since then HOL has received this award two more times in recognition of new content libraries added to its constantly expanding database. In 2002, HOL was named as a “Best Commercial Website” by the International Association of Law Libraries. In 2007, EContent Magazine listed HOL among the hundred “companies that matter most in the digital content industry.” The list “represents the best and the brightest digital content companies.” More recently HOL's World's Constitutions Illustrated was named by Choice Magazine as an “Outstanding Title” for 2010. A little more than a decade after HOL went live, a publication of the American Association of Law Libraries referred to it as a “groundbreaking product” and as “a leader in online legal literature.” 2013 survey In 2013 a survey of domestic and international law librarians ranked HeinOnline as one of the three most popular “subscription databases” among law libraries throughout the world. This survey ranked HOL just behind the much larger and more highly capitalized Westlaw and Lexis. According to this survey, conducted by a London-based law librarian, “These top three easily dominated the subscription database market across all major law libraries, across the world.” They also “dominated University law school libraries.” Significantly, among “Research Institute Libraries” HOL ranked first while the much larger Lexis and Westlaw dropped to third and fourth. HOL and Westlaw were tied for first among the most popular “subscription databases” in Public Libraries. Among North American law libraries HOL, Lexis and Westlaw were tied for the highest number of subscriptions, in Asia (excluding the Middle East) HOL was tied with Lexis for second place behind Westlaw and in Europe HOL ranked third, behind Westlaw and Lexis. This suggests that the smaller HOL has as great a presence at home and nearly so in Europe and Asia as its much larger competitors, but that it has been less successful in penetrating markets in Africa, Latin America, Australia/New Zealand, and the Middle East. 2010 survey In 2010, a survey found that 72% of all law firms subscribed to HeinOnline. The author of this article noted that “Academic law libraries quickly embraced HeinOnline in its early years” but expressed “surprise” by “the popularity of HeinOnline in law firms, at 72%.” The explanation for this unexpected survey result rested on economic considerations interwoven with HOL's content: “as law firms reduced office space dedicated to print collections, the ever-increasing breadth of HeinOnline’s historical, and now more current, publications has made it a pragmatic and sound business investment.” This analysis dovetailed with earlier explanations by law firm librarians. Description All materials on HeinOnline are available as downloadable and searchable PDFs of the original and complete documents. Unlike its major competitors, HOL does not keyboard the content of documents, cases, and statutes, but instead scans them with high-end optical scanning technology. This approach avoids the introduction of typographical errors. In addition, other competitors often edit or delete cases and documents, or change pagination, formatting, and the use of various typefaces such as italics. Because of HOL's use of pdfs of all original documents, the materials appear exactly as they did in the original publication. HeinOnline initially focused on traditional legal materials. Indeed, when first released, HOL provided full online access to only 25 academic law reviews, but by 2006 the database of law reviews had expanded to more than 800 journals. Starting in 2007, HOL provided full-text searchable access to “every ‘flagship’ law review published by an accredited U.S. law school.” At the time of HeinOnline’s inception, Lexis and Westlaw did not offer access to older law reviews, but only to those published since the 1980s. Thus, HOL initially envisioned itself mainly as a historical archive, but this changed due to market demands by professors, scholars, and law librarians, who wanted access to HOL’s scans of the more recent journal issues as well, rather than the keyboarded version in Westlaw and Lexis. Expansion Even before HOL expanded to include all new law review issues, it was adding other material, starting with the Federal Register in 2002 and a Supreme Court library that included PDFs of all volumes of U.S. Reports. Significantly, Hein offered the full and complete version of all reported cases, while its competitors often provided truncated and edited versions, with changes in spelling or punctuation to reflect modern usage. This was especially true for 19th century cases, which contained extensive lawyers’ arguments in the U.S. Reports. These were often deleted in the Lexis and Westlaw versions, but fully available on HOL. Libraries of Treaties and Agreements, legal classics, U.S. Statutes at Large, all Federal Regulations (including those that had been long superseded) were added by 2007, and more material including extensive state material followed. HeinOnline has now expanded to include reports and proceedings of federal, state, and local governments and agencies, modern books, non-academic law reviews and journals, current legal periodicals, foreign law reports and statutes, legislative and executive branch reports from foreign governments and NGOs, annual reports of numerous non-legal organizations (such as nineteenth century antislavery societies, religious organizations, and medical societies), reports from historical international organizations (such as the League of Nations) and modern international organizations (such as the United Nations). HOL has placed online, in word searchable format, virtually all known historical legal periodicals in English. The Chief Law Librarian at a major Canadian law school referred to this project as “the epic work of HeinOnline.” Collections Among its collections, HOL has a full run of the complete reports in PDF form of all U.S. federal statutes, all U.S. Supreme Court reports, lower federal court reports, reports of the U.S. Customs Court, Tax Court Memorandum Decisions, and Board of Bankruptcy Courts. HOL contains all published debates in Congress, starting with the Annals of Congress in 1789 and is beginning to add published committee reports from Congress, executive branch reports, administrative law reports and decisions, all colonial and state statutes and reported cases, congressional hearings, and full runs of reports and documents from numerous federal agencies. Materials come from all English-speaking nations, but the database also includes a great deal of other foreign materials. These include the Israel Law Reports, the Index to Foreign Legal Periodicals (IFLP), materials from the European Centre for Minority Issues, “comprehensive coverage of student-run law reviews relating to Chinese law,” and a Foreign and International Law Library. HeinOnline carries a number of sources which are otherwise unavailable from competing database products. For example, it has PDFs of scans of the entire Federal Register, which is updated on a daily basis. Its library of law journal articles differs from competitors’ star-paginated plain text versions. Because Hein uses PDFs, rather than keyboarded text, every document shows original pagination, punctuation, spelling and typesetting. However, as with any electronic product, there are occasional scanning errors. The use of fully searchable PDFs is significant since many similar databases do not provide full texts of even all U.S. Supreme Court reports, and keyboarded texts of opinions also often do not include italics and other typeface distinctions found in opinions, especially in the 18th and 19th centuries. Furthermore, because nothing in Hein has been keyboarded, no typographical errors have been introduced into the text. New books In addition to publishing new books and other materials, Hein has become the publisher and the repository for a number of third parties. For example, Hein publishes the Index to Foreign Legal Periodicals (IFLP) for the American Association of Law Libraries. Most of the more than 500 periodicals indexed in IFLP are also available in full- text versions through HOL. In addition to traditional periodicals, the IFLP also provides index access to more than 50 collections of essays, conference proceedings, and festschriften. Some of these books are also available on HOL in full text. Chinese legal scholars praise HOL because it is a “robust legal research portal and discovery platform” that “provides multiple starting points for legal researchers to access more specific legal topics because secondary sources, such as journal articles and chapters in monographs, are cross-linked with primary sources. . . .” Slavery reports In 2016, Hein launched “Slavery in America and the World: History, Culture, & Law.\\" Unlike other Hein products, access to this on-line collection is completely free, and available to anyone in the world simply by registering at: http://home.heinonline.org/content/Slavery-in-America-and-the-World-History- Culture--Law/ It contains virtually every reported state and federal case on slavery, every state and federal case on slavery, and more than 1,250 books and pamphlets dating from the eighteenth century to the present. Many of the items have introductions by the General Editor of the library, slavery historian Paul Finkelman. Hein continues to add to the library every month. In March, 2017 an article in the official publication of the Association of Independent Information Professionals praised this new collection, noting “Hein also believes in corporate citizenship: In October 2016, it released its collection, Slavery in America and the World: History, Culture & Law. Freely available to anyone with Internet access.” The emergence of HeinOnline reflects trends in law librarianship as well as economic changes. In an interview setting, librarians at law firms noted that access to the Federal Register and every law review ever published in the United States allowed their firms to discard bound volumes, reduce subscriptions to some materials, and at the same time reduce the need to order materials on inter-library loan. The director of the library at one of the largest firms in Chicago noted, “We cancelled subscriptions, got rid of the bound volumes, and reduced the amount of borrowings we needed to do at the Cook County Law Library and other local law libraries.”Allyson Withers of Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP, quoted in Moss, p 8. As a journalist noted in writing a history of HOL, the online product has allowed all libraries to cope with “the over burgeoning shelf space devoted to law reviews”. Peer review In a 2017 “Peer Review” of HeinOnline, in Connections, the official publication of the Association of Independent Information Professionals, Dan Odenwald, of Capstone Information Services & Consulting, noted that “With material dating to 13th century English Law Reports through contemporary American statutes and commentary, Hein is an indispensable tool in many research arsenals, providing access to current must-haves as well as historical obscurities.” Odenwald described HeinOnline as “a cornucopia of legal research treasures.” In this review he also noted the “oft-repeated drawback to Hein is the lack of editorial enhancements like those on LexisNexis and Westlaw” such as its lack of “annotated codes, case law summaries nor formal legal citation services.” At the same time, he praised Hein because “Search help and history are easily located; document printing and downloading are simple; and customer supports – training guides, webinars, live chat and toll-free hotlines – are ubiquitous.” See also * vLex * Lexis Nexis * Westlaw ReferencesExternal links * *William S Hein & Co., Inc.

Maddy. , it had over 350 faculty and staff, and approximately 550 students, from Freshman to Postgraduates. Admission is by audition only. While more than half the students major in Music Performance, IAA offers majors in Comparative Arts, Creative Writing, Dance, Theatre (Performance; Design and Production), Motion Picture Arts, and Visual Arts. Newer majors include Film and New Media (formerly Motion Picture Arts) beginning in 2005, and Interdisciplinary Arts (formerly Comparative Arts) in 2011. The vast majority of students at Interlochen Arts Academy are boarding students, including many international students; some are day students who live in the vicinity. Upon graduation, most IAA graduates continue to universities or conservatories for further study in the arts or academics. Conservatories that often admit Interlochen students include Juilliard, Eastman, Cleveland Institute of Music (CIM), School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Curtis, New England Conservatory (NEC), Oberlin Conservatory, Manhattan School of Music, Boston Conservatory, Peabody Institute, and CalArts. Interlochen Arts Academy graduates also matriculate at colleges and universities that do not have a primary focus on the arts. Due to its reputation and secluded location, Interlochen Arts Academy has attracted many celebrity offspring, including children of Robin Williams, Hugh Hefner, Bruce Willis, Demi Moore, and Alan Menken. Dorms The campus of Interlochen has seven dorm buildings for use year-round for Academy students and staff: *Hemingway House *Picasso House *Mozart-Beethoven House *McWhorter House *Deroy House *Thor-Johnson House *Frida Kahlo House History Interlochen in the 1940s From the State of Michigan historical marker on Interlochen's Osterlin Mall: > Ottawa Indians once lived in the pine forest between lakes Wahbekaness and > Wahbekanetta. In the late 1800s white men came and cut the pines, leaving > only a small forest between the lakes. This virgin pine was purchased in > 1917 by the state and became part of one of the first state parks. When the > lumber era ended, the Wylie Cooperage mill occupied the Indian village site, > making barrels until the hardwood ran out. Willis Pennington's summer hotel, > opened in 1909, was popular with fishermen until automobiles and better > roads drew them elsewhere. Then in 1918, Camp Interlochen, one of Michigan's > first girls' recreation camps, was opened, followed in 1922 by Camp Penn > Loch for boys. In 1928, by arrangement with Willis Pennington, Joseph E. > Maddy and Thaddeus P. Giddings established the National High School > Orchestra Camp. It grew rapidly in scope, size, and reputation, becoming the > National Music Camp in 1931, and affiliating with the University of Michigan > in 1942. Interlochen Arts Academy was chartered in 1960 to provide year- > round training in the creative arts. From the book Interlochen, The First 25 Years: > In 1926, Joe Maddy was asked to organize and conduct the First National High > School Orchestra for the Music Supervisors' National Conference (now known > as the Music Educators National Conference) in Detroit. Its resounding > success led to an invitation to duplicate the experience at the Dallas, > Texas convention of the National Education Association's Department of > Superintendence in 1927. The exuberant young musicians pled for the chance > to work and play together longer than the few days the convention appearance > afforded. Joe Maddy promised them a music camp! In June, 1928, at > Interlochen, Michigan, in the midst of a magnificent stand of virgin pine > trees between two lovely lakes, The National High School Orchestra Camp > opened its doors. On leased land, with the old Hotel Pennington, several > cottages, 29 new camper cabins, a hospital, water and sewer system, the new > Interlochen Bowl, and $40,000 debt, this brave experiment was launched. Interlochen was the inspiration for the 1941 Paramount motion picture There's Magic in Music (AKA \\"The Hard Boiled Canary\\").There's Magic in Music at the Internet Movie Database Interlochen also provided inspiration, along with Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp, for Alyson Hannigan's character in American Pie. In 2006, Katalyst Media filmed a reality TV pilot for MTV at Interlochen Arts Academy. Afraid that an MTV show would ruin Interlochen's distinguished reputation, a large group of students resorted to protesting and trolling the Katalyst Media film crew in order to prevent Katalyst Media from filming viable footage. Student efforts were successful, and the pilot never aired. Notable alumni The Interlochen Alumni Organization Board serves as the liaison between Interlochen's global alumni community and Interlochen Center for the Arts.

When it was founded in 1963, WIAA (note the similarity between the station call letters and the \\"IAA\\" abbreviation for Interlochen Arts Academy) was envisioned as a logical extension of the long-running \\"Music From Interlochen\\" program that had been heard for many years on the NBC radio network, and which helped to spread word about the activities at the then-named National Music Camp and the then-fledgling Interlochen Arts Academy. The station performed so poorly in its early years that there was talk of shutting down the operation. Today, however, Interlochen Public Radio thrives and includes both a music service and a news service. Despite being one of the smallest NPR members, IPR boasts one of the highest rates of per capita contributions of any public radio station in the United States. The station's classical music service is broadcast from their main tower at WIAA 88.7 FM in Interlochen, along with WIAB 88.5 FM in Mackinaw City, and W234BU 94.7 FM in Traverse City. In 2000, IPR began offering a separate news service on WICA 91.5 FM in Traverse City and later added WLMN 89.7 FM in Manistee and WHBP 90.1 FM in Harbor Springs. Interlochen is currently investigating acquisition of additional licenses so that IPR can reach larger, more geographically-diverse audiences. Interlochen Presents Interlochen Presents has a summer festival running from June through August (schedule announced in April) and a performing arts series from September through May coinciding with the Academy school year (schedule announced in August). It features concerts, plays, art exhibits, readings, film screenings and dance productions presented by students, faculty, and staff, as well as both well-known and obscure guest artists. Interlochen Presents events are held in numerous venues around campus. The list of recent guest artists includes Steely Dan, Sheryl Crow, Willie Nelson, Joshua Bell, Jason Mraz, Bonnie Raitt, Olga Kern, Sara Bareilles, Dierks Bentley, Norah Jones, Martha Graham Dance Company, Ra Ra Riot, Bob Dylan, Jewel, Carol Jantsch, Josh Groban, Paula Poundstone, Nathan Gunn, Chris Thile, and Bela Fleck. Interlochen Presents and Interlochen Public Radio serve as the primary channels by which Interlochen Center for the Arts connects with the northern Michigan region. Interlochen College of Creative Arts Interlochen College of Creative Arts was founded in 2004, and offers non-degree arts programs for adults 18 years and over. Most programs are 3–7 days long, and are housed in the Mallory-Towsley Center for Arts Leadership building on Interlochen's campus. The Mallory-Towsley building was completed in summer 2011. Awards and accolades *National Medal of Arts: In 2006, Interlochen Center for the Arts was named recipient of the National Medal of Arts, one of the highest honors bestowed by the President of the United States and National Endowment for the Arts on individuals or institutions that have contributed substantially to the growth and advancement of the arts. Interlochen president Jeff Kimpton received the award on behalf of Interlochen Center for the Arts from President George W. Bush in an Oval Office ceremony. *Presidential Scholars in the Arts: Interlochen Arts Academy is a perennial front-runner among American high schools in its production of Presidential Scholars in the Arts, having produced more recipients of the award than any other school in the nation. *National youngARTS Foundation: Interlochen Arts Academy is also a perennial front-runner in the youngARTS competition, representing approximately 19% of youngARTS finalists. In connection to the youngARTS competition, three Interlochen students, Adam Blodgett '08, Alix Briggs '08, and Steven Johnson '09, were featured on HBO's Primetime Emmy-winning Masterclass series. Alumni Josh Groban has also appeared on the series as a mentor.

Treman State Park is a state park located in Tompkins County, in the Finger Lakes region of New York in the United States. The park is situated in the towns of Ithaca, Enfield and Newfield. History Robert Henry Treman (1858-1937) first purchased land surrounding Enfield Falls in 1915, and worked to improve the property by planting over 1,000 trees. He and his wife, Laura Treman (Hosie) (1865-1944), donated the land to New York State in 1920 for the establishment of Enfield Glen State Park. The park was renamed in Robert H. Treman's honor following his death in 1937. The Enfield Falls Mill and Miller's House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Park description Robert H. Treman State Park is located along State Route 327, just west of state routes 13, 34, and 96. The park offers an outdoor swimming area at the base of a waterfall, picnic tables, playing fields, hiking and camping. The park has numerous waterfalls along a round-trip hike. The hiking trails follow Enfield Creek, giving many views of the rock formations in the deep, narrow gorge known as Enfield Glen. A natural swimming pool is located at the easternmost waterfall, known as Lower Falls. Lucifer Falls, a , multi-tiered cascading waterfall, is a short hike from the western portion of the park. Views of Lucifer Falls can be found along the gorge trail, in addition to overlooks along the rim trail. The Finger Lakes Trail skirts the southern edge of the park. Because of dangerous conditions created by snow and ice, most of the park's trails are inaccessible in the winter. Visitors can view Lower Falls year-round.

After the band disbanded he started a successful solo career, becoming one of Japan's best-selling artists. In 2003, HMV Japan ranked Himuro at number 76 on their list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts. He currently lives in Los Angeles, California, where he purchased a 12,500 square feet palatial residence in Beverly Hills in 2004 for $6.4 million, which was previously owned by Shaquille O'Neal. Life and career He was born , pronounced the same but written with different characters, before adopting his stage name at the end of 1984. Himuro has frequently played music with Steve Stevens, best known as the backing guitarist for Billy Idol. For example, Stevens participated in Himuro's album as a guitarist and his concert tour after his album I·De·A. On August 22, 2004, he held a concert, entitled \\"21st Century Boøwys VS Himuro\\", at the Tokyo Dome. He sang many Boøwy songs, the first time in sixteen years. \\"Wild Romance\\" was used as the ending theme music for the Japanese dubbed version of Van Helsing. Most recently, Himuro's song \\"Calling\\", from his 1989 album Neo Fascio, was used in the ending credits to the highly anticipated 2005 CG Film Final Fantasy VII Advent Children. The film's director, Tetsuya Nomura, has noted that Himuro's music has been highly influential in his own work, and when asked about his contribution to the film, Himuro said that he was happy his work would be used in \\"the best CG movie ever made in Japan\\". On August 5 and 6, 2006, he held a concert called \\"Kyosuke Himuro + Glay 2006 at Ajonomoto-Stadium \\"Swing Addition\\"\\" with Japanese band Glay in Ajinomoto Stadium. In addition, Himuro released first collaborated single with Glay called \\"Answer\\" on August 2, 2006. The Japanese release of Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete features a new ending song by Himuro, replacing the original use of \\"Calling\\". \\"Safe and Sound\\" is the title and it features My Chemical Romance lead singer Gerard Way. \\"Safe and Sound\\" was released on the iTunes Store on April 29, 2009. However, the North American release does not contain \\"Safe and Sound\\", but instead continues to feature \\"Calling\\". Himuro held two consecutive sold-out charity concerts at the Tokyo Dome on June 20, 2011, attracting over 104,000 people making them the biggest charity live event ever held in Japan. The raised sum of 669,220,940 yen (around US$8.7 million) was donated to Fukushima, Miyagi, and Iwate prefectures, for recovery after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. In 2016, he had a retirement tour in Japan and officially retired from music activities due to his hearing impairment.

He played professionally as a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) and the Canadian Football League (CFL). Early years Born in Torrance, California, Ferragamo was an All-American high school quarterback while at Phineas Banning High School (1969–1972) in nearby Wilmington, he was selected as that year's Los Angeles City Schools Most Valuable Player. Ferragamo was heavily recruited by colleges, and he accepted a football scholarship to the University of California, Berkeley. College football Ferragamo became Cal's starting quarterback for the final three games of his true freshman season in 1972 and remained the starter through the following year. Ferragamo chose to transfer to top-ranked Nebraska in 1974. As a Cornhusker, he lettered in 1975 and 1976. Nebraska was ranked No. 1 to open the 1976 season but managed only to tie LSU, 6–6, in a game at Tiger Stadium on September 11. The two teams were said to have waged \\"unrelenting trench warfare\\".Hilburn, Chet. The Mystique of Tiger Stadium: 25 Greatest Games: The Ascension of LSU Football (Bloomington, Indiana: WestBow Press, 2012), p. 51 Ferragamo capped his college career by leading the Cornhuskers to a victory over Texas Tech in the Astro-Bluebonnet Bowl in the Houston Astrodome. During his senior season, he was All-Big Eight Conference, All-American and also an Academic All-American. Professional football careerNational Football League= Ferragamo played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Los Angeles Rams (1977–1980, 1982–1984), Buffalo Bills (1985) and Green Bay Packers (1985–1986). In 1979, Ferragamo was the backup to Pat Haden, who broke a finger in mid-season. After leading the 9–7 Rams to road victories over the Dallas Cowboys and Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFC playoffs, Ferragamo started in Super Bowl XIV in Pasadena, making him the first quarterback to start a Super Bowl in the same season as his first career start. The underdog Rams led after three quarters of play before falling to the Pittsburgh Steelers 31–19. Ferragamo enjoyed his best statistical season in 1980 in which he threw for 30 touchdowns, tied for second most in the NFL. The Rams again made the playoffs, but were defeated by Dallas 34–13 in the wild card game. =Canadian Football League= Ferragamo played for the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League (CFL) for one season, 1981. He was signed to a large contract by both CFL and NFL standards at the time ($600,000, compared to $250,000 the Rams offered him, and the $47,500 they had paid him for 1980.) However, Ferragamo had a difficult time adjusting to the style of Canadian football. Montreal went on to win only three games against 13 losses (but did reach the playoffs due to weak East Division that season). He was demoted to backup to Gerry Dattilio in the latter half of the season and then third-string quarterback for the final three games after Ken Johnson arrived in a trade. Ferragamo's last game in the CFL was a loss to the Ottawa Rough Riders in the Eastern semi-final, which he watched from the pressbox. His stats during his one season in Montreal were 175 of 342 passes completed (51.2%) for 2175 yards, with seven touchdown passes and 25 interceptions. =Return to NFL= Ferragamo returned to the Rams in 1982, as the backup to Bert Jones, who was sidelined with a neck injury. Late in the strike-shortened season on December 26, Ferragamo threw for 509 yards in a home loss to the Chicago Bears, at the time the second highest mark for passing yards in a game in league history behind former Ram Norm Van Brocklin. It was the third time in league history that a quarterback had passed for over 500 yards in a game, following Van Brocklin in 1951 (554 yards) and Y. A. Tittle in 1962 (505 yards). Ferragamo led the Rams back to the playoffs in 1983, behind the running of rookie Eric Dickerson. After beating the favored Cowboys in Irving in the wild card matchup 24–17, the Rams were drubbed 51–7 by the defending Super Bowl champion Washington Redskins. In 1984, Ferragamo was again the Rams' starting quarterback. But in a 24–14 loss at Pittsburgh on September 16, he broke a finger on his throwing hand in what became his last game for the Rams. Ferragamo played the next two seasons with the Buffalo Bills and Green Bay Packers. In a span of less than eight months, he was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated twice, in December 1980, and July 1981. After football Ferragamo owns Touchdown Real Estate in Orange County, and Ferragamo-Migneco Vineyards in Santa Maria, California. He is the chairman of the Vince Ferragamo Foundation, a non-profit charitable organization begun in 1996 that focuses on raising donations for children's organizations such as the Special Olympics, the Speech and Language Development Center and Ronald McDonald House Charities.

College After graduating from Middletown High School, in Middletown, Ohio, Bell was given a scholarship to play for the Ohio State University. He was a four-year starter at defensive back, playing as a roverback, a hybrid of the strong safety and linebacker positions. His biggest moment at Ohio State was a game-winning touchdown in his junior year against rival Michigan on November 17, 1979. After Ohio State linebacker Jim Laughlin blocked a punt by Michigan's Brian Virgil, Bell scooped up the football and ran it in 18 yards for a final score of 18–15. Winning the game sent Ohio State to the 1980 Rose Bowl and gave them a chance at the national championship. Professional career Bell was selected in the fourth round of the 1981 NFL Draft by the Chicago Bears. He played with the Bears from 1981 to 1984, earning a Pro Bowl nomination in his fourth year. Bell was known on the team for his hits on opposing team players, and for his off-the-field reputation as a prankster. Bell sat out the entire 1985 season due to a contract dispute with the team – and missed being part of one of the most dominating Super Bowl teams of all time. His replacement, Dave Duerson, also went on to be selected for the Pro Bowl that year. Bell returned in 1986, but a hamstring injury and the contract dispute still lingered over his tenure with the Bears, and he signed a free agent contract with the Philadelphia Eagles in the off-season in 1988. The Eagles converted him from strong safety to linebacker, and he played two years with the Eagles before he broke his leg in a 31–13 loss to the Chicago Bears on Monday Night Football on October 2, 1989, which prematurely ended his career. Death On March 16, 2005, Bell suffered a fatal heart attack while driving his car in Reynoldsburg, Ohio. Todd Anthony Bell National Resource Center on the African American Male In 1997 Bell returned to The Ohio State University to accept a position as Coordinator of the Minority Continuing Education Opportunities Program in the Office of Continuing Education, then lodged in University College. There he worked with Dean Mac Stewart to give leadership to outreach with the central Ohio community. He fostered cooperation with local businesses to provide funding for their employees to start or return to college studies at OSU. He also worked with the personnel of local Boys & Girls Clubs to develop joint ventures to improve the environment of the neighborhoods near the central campus. In 2001, he moved to the Office of Minority Affairs where he coordinated a broad range of community-university programs. Notably, on campus he gave initial leadership to the development of the Black Male Initiative to improve the campus environment, academic achievement, and leadership development of African American males at The Ohio State University and he was part of the team that developed the African American Male Resource Center. When Bell died in 2005, the center was renamed to The Todd Anthony Bell National Resource Center on the African American Male to honor his work at the university and with African American male students.

Major manufacturers are Kässbohrer (Germany), Prinoth (Italy) and Tucker (United States). Snow groomers Active snow groomer. A snowcat dedicated to snow maintenance rather than transport is a snow groomer. Other terms are 'piste machines', 'trail groomers' (in North American English) or 'piste bashers' (in British English) because of their use in preparing ski trails (\\"pistes\\") or snowmobile trails. Other functions In addition to grooming snow they are used for polar expeditions, logging in marsh areas, leveling sugar beet piles, and seismic studies in the wild. Construction A Tucker Sno-Cat at the Rothera Research Station, Antarctica Most snowcats, such as the ones produced by Bombardier or Aktiv in the past, have two sets of tracks, fitted with a Christie suspension or a Horstmann suspension. Others, like the Tucker Sno-Cat and Hägglunds Bandvagn 206 vehicles, have a complex arrangement of four or more tracks. The tracks are usually made of rubber, aluminum or steel and driven by a single sprocket on each side, and ride over rubber wheels with a solid foam interior. Their design is optimized for a snow surface, or soft grounds such as that of a peat bog. The cabs are optimized for use in sub-zero weather or cold conditions worsened by wind chill, with strong forced heating and a windshield designed to be kept clear of internal and external ice or condensation through a variety of means such as advanced coatings, external scrapers (windshield wipers of a modified type), and internal ducts blowing hot air on the surface. History The forerunners of the snowcat were the tracked \\"motors\\" designed by Captain Scott and his engineer Reginald Skelton for the Antarctic Terra Nova Expedition of 1910–1913. These tracked motors were built by the Wolseley Tool and Motor Car Company in Birmingham. In the 1955–1958 Fuchs and Hillary Transantarctic Expedition, four modern snowcats were used, produced by the Tucker Sno-Cat Corporation of Medford, Oregon. These vehicles were highly modified for the purposes of the expedition. The name \\"snowcat\\" originates from the 1946 trademark by Tucker Sno-Cat Corporation. This specialized over- snow vehicle dominated the snow transportation market until the 1960s when other manufacturers entered the business. By then \\"snowcat\\" was such a common description that it was used to describe all over-snow vehicles (see generic trademark). Tucker is also well known for its use of four tracks on its vehicles. Tucker Sno-Cat is arguably the best known of the early manufacturers and remains in business today. Tucker Sno-Cats have been used by numerous military, governmental agencies and utilities. Another early model was the Swedish made Aktiv Snow Trac of which 2265 were manufactured in Sweden between 1957 and 1981. NATO forces used the Snow Trac successfully during the Cold War between NATO and the USSR. Numerous accounts from Antarctica related successful use of the Snow Trac by research organizations such as A.N.A.R.E. in Antarctica. Thiokol sold its ski-lift and snowcat operation in 1978 to John DeLorean, and changed its name to DeLorean Motor Company (DMC). DMC was later bought out by its management team and renamed Logan Machine Company (LMC). LMC ceased production in 2000. Thiokol's Imp, Super-Imp and Spryte were popular dual-track snowcats and Thiokol's production continued under DMC and LMC. The Spryte, sold later as 1200 and 1500 series machines, are still popular in commercial and industrial use, nearly 20 years after the end of their production runs. Many of these models are still in use today in the commercial market and are popular as privately owned snowcats. Between 1956 and 1968, KRISTI snowcat had a limited production of two-track snowcats in Colorado; it never became popular and ceased production with fewer than 200 total units produced. In 1982, Aktiv Snow Trac ceased assembly when its engine supplier (Volkswagen) ceased production of its air-cooled engines in Europe. Over 1000 Snow Tracs were imported to Canada and the United States, mostly by Canadian utilities and U.S. governmental agencies; the Snow Trac is still in common use in private ownership and to a lesser degree in commerce having produced over 2200 total machines which saw popular use all over the globe. Current production Bombardier still continues in business but has radically altered its business model and product selection and sold its snow grooming division and no longer makes commercial snowcats. Bombardier sold over 3000 of its popular snow bus models which are still in use today and in popular demand by dedicated collectors; thousands of other Bombardier models were also produced as ski-slope and snowmobile trail groomers with the Bombi and BR100 to 180 series machines as notable units produced in high quantities. Bombardier Recreational Products still produces the Ski-Doo line of open ridge single- tracked personal snowmobiles. Russia as one of the snowiest countries in the world has a wide range of snowcat producers, from the big 30-tonnes load capacity two linked tracked Vityaz vehicles to 0.4-2 tonnes load capacity ZZGT vehicles. The first 100% electric snow groomer was launched by Kässbohrer in June 2019.

He pitched in Major League Baseball for the Texas Rangers and Oakland Athletics. Playing careerEarly career= Duchscherer (nickname: \\"The Duke of Hurl\\") was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the 8th round (241st overall) of the 1996 Major League Baseball draft out of Coronado High School in Lubbock, Texas. His high-80s fastball made him one of the hardest throwers in the area, but his velocity soon ranked as only average as he entered the minor leagues. In , he went 7-12 with a 4.79 ERA in 30 appearances (26 starts) for Single-A Michigan. As Duchscherer continued to struggle in the low levels of the minor leagues, he was beginning to look more like a roster filler than a big-league prospect. But in , he turned his career around. He went 6-3 with a 2.44 ERA in 12 starts for Double-A Trenton before being traded to the Texas Rangers for catcher Doug Mirabelli. He finished the year pitching well with the Texas organization, going 4-0 for Double-A Tulsa and sporting a 2.84 ERA after his call-up to Triple-A Oklahoma. He received his first major league call-up in 2001, a very forgettable one. He went 1-1 with a 12.27 ERA for the Rangers. =Oakland Athletics= In spring training , Duchscherer was traded to the Oakland Athletics for Luis Vizcaíno. After suffering a lower back injury in 2002, Duchscherer bounced back in 2003, going 14-2 with a 3.25 ERA for Triple-A Sacramento. In his last year of Triple-A, he started the All-Star game even though the chosen starting pitcher was Harden. A few hours before the game, Harden got called up to the major leagues, clearing the way for Duchscherer to start the game. On September 9, 2003, he made a start for the A's in place of ace Mark Mulder against the Anaheim Angels in the heat of a tight division race. He pitched 7 scoreless innings to earn his first win. That same day, his wife gave birth to their first son, Evan Duchscherer. In the spring of , the A's chose Duchscherer over Chad Harville, and traded Harville to the Houston Astros for Kirk Saarloos. Duchscherer appeared in 53 games out of the bullpen, sporting an ERA of 3.27. In 2005, he was selected to the American League All-Star team, the A's lone representative, but did not pitch in the game. He finished the year with 7 wins out of the bullpen and a 2.21 ERA as the top setup man for rookie closer Huston Street. During the season, Duchscherer spent most of the season on the disabled list with an injured right hip that required season-ending surgery. For the season, Duchscherer returned to the starting rotation for the A's. Duchscherer spent about three weeks on the disabled list with an inflamed biceps in April. After returning to the rotation, Duchscherer was outstanding and, at one point, led the major leagues in ERA. He was selected to the 2008 MLB All Star Game. Duchscherer missed the 2009 season due to shoulder and back injuries and a bout with clinical depression. He became a free agent following the season, rejecting the A's arbitration offer.Duchscherer rejects arbitration with A's On December 30, 2009, Duchscherer signed a one-year contract with a base salary of $2 million, with another $3.5 million with incentives with the Oakland Athletics Duchscherer made 5 starts for Oakland in the first month of the 2010 season, posting a 2–1 record with a 2.89 ERA, but went on the disabled list in May and missed the remainder of the season. He became a free agent on November 2. =Baltimore Orioles= On January 30, 2011, Duchscherer signed a one-year deal with the Baltimore Orioles. He was released on August 2.

Hazlewood had a distinctive baritone voice that added a resonance to his music. His collaborations with Nancy Sinatra as well as his solo output in the late 1960s and early 1970s have been praised as an essential contribution to a sound often described as \\"cowboy psychedelia\\" or \\"saccharine underground\\". Rolling Stone ranked Lee Hazlewood & Nancy Sinatra No. 9 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time. Early life Barton Lee Hazlewood was born in Mannford, Oklahoma on July 9, 1929. The son of an oil worker father, Hazlewood spent most of his youth living among Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, and Louisiana. His paternal grandmother was Native American. He grew up listening to pop and bluegrass music. Lee spent his teenage years in Port Neches, Texas, where he was exposed to a rich Gulf Coast music tradition. He studied for a medical degree at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. He served with the United States Army during the Korean War. Career Hazlewood was initially known as a producer and songwriter, for artists including Duane Eddy, Dean Martin, and Dino, Desi & Billy.The Making of An Urbane Cowboy Following discharge from the military in 1953,Elemental and enigmatic — the mystery of Some Velvet Morning Hazlewood worked as a disc jockey in Coolidge, Arizona and two years later, moved to KRUX radio in Phoenix. During that time, he was already writing songs and formed his own record label, Viv.Music Lee Hazlewood His first hit single as a producer and songwriter was \\"The Fool\\", recorded by rockabilly artist Sanford Clark in 1956. He partnered with pioneering rock guitarist Duane Eddy, producing and co-writing a string of hit instrumental records. \\"Rebel Rouser\\", released in 1958 was a hit in the US and in the UK; Eddy would eventually have another 14 US hits,Music Lee Hazlewood including \\"Peter Gunn\\", \\"Boss Guitar\\", \\"Forty Miles of Bad Road\\", \\"Shazam!\\" and \\"(Dance With The) Guitar Man\\". Hazlewood is perhaps best known for having written and produced the 1966 Nancy Sinatra U.S./UK No. 1 hit, \\"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\\" and \\"Summer Wine\\", the latter first recorded with Suzi Jane Hokom in 1966. His collaboration with Nancy Sinatra began when Frank Sinatra asked Lee to help boost his daughter's career. When recording These Boots are Made for Walkin', Hazlewood is said to have made this suggestion to Nancy, \\"You can’t sing like Nancy Nice Lady any more. You have to sing for the truckers\\". She later described him as \\"part Henry Higgins and part Sigmund Freud\\".Elemental and enigmatic — the mystery of Some Velvet Morning Hazlewood also wrote \\"How Does That Grab Ya, Darlin'\\", \\"Friday's Child\\", \\"So Long, Babe, \\"Sugar Town\\" and many others for Sinatra. Among his most well-known vocal performances is \\"Some Velvet Morning\\", a 1967 duet with Nancy Sinatra. He performed that song along with \\"Jackson\\" on her 1967 television special Movin' With Nancy. Early in 1967, Lee also produced the number 1 hit song for Frank & Nancy Sinatra \\"Somethin' Stupid\\". The pair became the only father-daughter duo to top the Hot 100 with what DJs dubbed 'the incest song' because it performed as if sung by two lovers. The record earned a Grammy Award nomination for Record of the Year and remains the only father-daughter duet to hit No. 1 in the U.S.Rewinding the Charts: In 1967, Frank & Nancy Sinatra Shared a No. 1 Jimmy Bowen was listed as co-producer on that record but wasn't there at the time. Hazlewood just gave him credit as per a previous agreement with Jimmy. Hazlewood also wrote the theme song \\"The Last of the Secret Agents\\", the theme song of the 1966 spy-spoof film of the same title. Nancy Sinatra, who had a role in the film, recorded the song for the soundtrack. For Frank Sinatra's 1967 detective movie, Tony Rome, Hazlewood also wrote the theme song which was performed by Nancy. He wrote \\"Houston\\", a 1965 US hit recorded by Dean Martin. He also produced several singles for Martin's daughter, Deana Martin, including her country hit, \\"Girl of the Month Club,\\" while Deana was still a teenager. Other tunes on that project were \\"When He Remembers Me,\\" \\"Baby I See You\\" and \\"The Bottom of My Mind,\\" all recorded during the 1960s. Hazlewood also wrote \\"This Town\\", a song that was recorded by Frank Sinatra that appeared on his 1968 album Greatest Hits and is the basis for Paul Shaffer's \\"Small Town News\\" segment theme on the Late Show with David Letterman. In 1967, Hazlewood started his own record label, LHI Records (Lee Hazlewood Industries). Though it did not receive much attention at the time, the International Submarine Band, led by a then-unknown Gram Parsons, signed with LHI in 1967 and released their one and only album, Safe at Home. Shortly after the album was recorded, Parsons left the band to join The Byrds, contributing several songs to their 1968 album Sweetheart of the Rodeo. The contract Parsons had signed with Hazlewood's LHI caused a great deal of trouble for himself and The Byrds, and in the court settlement most of Parsons' material on Sweetheart of the Rodeo had the vocals removed and re- recorded by Roger McGuinn. This situation led to Parsons' departure from the Byrds not long after the album's release. As LHI producer and Hazlewood's ex- girlfriend Suzi Jane Hokom later noted, Hazlewood was a performer and not a businessman, and his lack of business acumen figured greatly in the label's 1971 demise. In the 1970s Hazlewood moved to Stockholm, Sweden, where he wrote and produced the one-hour television show Cowboy in Sweden together with friend and Director Torbjörn Axelman, which also later emerged as an album. During ten years in Sweden he made records and films with Axelman. According to a retrospective of his career, the move to Europe was motivated by his \\"tax problems\\", concern that his son might be drafted for the Vietnam war and the fact that his record label \\"LHI was dying anyway\\", so Sweden looked like the perfect escape route. Decades later, his friend Suzi Jane Hokom made this comment about the years in Europe. \\"I think he knew he'd burned his bridges in LA and here was a brand new world where he had a built-in fanclub ... He really needed a new start\\".Lee Hazlewood: the wayward guru of cowboy psychedelia Lee was semi-retired from the music business from the late 1970s and all through the 1980s. However, his own output also achieved a cult status in the underground rock scene, with songs recorded by artists such as Rowland S. Howard, Kim Salmon and the Surrealists, Miles Kane, Vanilla Fudge, Spell, Lydia Lunch, Primal Scream, Entombed, Einstürzende Neubauten, Nick Cave, the Jesus and Mary Chain, Hooverphonic, KMFDM, Anita Lane, Megadeth, The Ukiah Drag, Beck, Baustelle, the Tubes, Thin White Rope, Yonatan Gat, Zeena Schreck/Radio Werewolf and Slowdive. In 2006, Hazlewood sang on Bela B.'s first solo album, Bingo, on the song \\"Lee Hazlewood und das erste Lied des Tages\\" (\\"Lee Hazlewood and the first song of the day\\"). He said that he loved producing and writing albums. In 2007, Reprise/Rhino Handmade Records posthumously released STRUNG OUT ON SOMETHING NEW: THE REPRISE RECORDINGS, a set of his work at Reprise from 1964-1968 (excluding the Nancy Sinatra recordings). The 2 CD collection, totaling 55 tracks, covers three of his solo albums as well as production work for other artists, such as Duane Eddy, Sanford Clark, Jack Nitzche and Dino, Desi & Billy. Since 2012, the Light in the Attic record label reissued many Hazlewood albums, including 400 Miles From LA: 1955-1956, which became available in September 2019.The Making of An Urbane Cowboy Last recordings and death In 2005, Hazlewood was diagnosed with terminal renal cancer, and he undertook an extensive round of interviews and promotional activities in support of his last album, Cake or Death. His last recording was for the vocals of Icelandic quartet Amiina's single \\"Hilli (At the Top of the World)\\". Hazlewood died of renal cancer in Henderson, Nevada, on August 4, 2007, survived by his wife Jeane, son Mark and daughters Debbie and Samantha. Trouble Is a Lonesome Town cover album 2013 Musician and producer Charles Normal and a group of musician friends, including Black Francis of the Pixies, Isaac Brock of Modest Mouse, Larry Norman, Pete Yorn and members of Art Brut and the Dandy Warhols, released their own version of Trouble Is a Lonesome Town in July 2013. Personal life Hazlewood was born in Mannford, Oklahoma; his father worked as a laborer in the oil industry and had a sideline as a dance promoter. After completing high school, Lee attended Southern Methodist University for a short time but was drafted into the service in Japan during the Korean War. He did not return to his studies after being demobilized.Music Lee Hazlewood He married three times. On December 5, 1949, he married his high-school sweetheart, Naomi Shackleford. The couple had two children, Debbie (b. 1954) and Mark Lee (b. 1955), before divorcing in 1961. Hazlewood used Naomi's maiden name for The Shacklefords, a short-lived vocal group he formed with Marty Cooper in early-1960s Los Angeles; Naomi herself contributed vocals to the group's recordings. In 1983, Hazlewood married Tracy Stewart, whose daughter Samantha (b. 1980) he raised as his own; that marriage also ended in divorce, in 1992. In November 2006, less than a year before his death, he married Jeane Kelly, his girlfriend since 1993, in a Las Vegas drive-through ceremony.The Making of An Urbane Cowboy Decades later, Kelly discussed her memories of Lee during an interview. \\"He was rude and sweet, innocent and depraved, proud and bitter. He absorbed everything he heard, saw, and read — from Port Neches to L.A. to Stockholm—and then made his own music in his own defiant way.\\"The Making of An Urbane Cowboy Hazlewood has a granddaughter named Phaedra, a tribute to the lyrics of \\"Some Velvet Morning.\\" Discography *1963 – Trouble is a Lonesome Town *1964 – The N.S.V.I.P.'s *1965 – Friday's Child *1966 – The Very Special World of Lee Hazlewood *1967 – Lee Hazlewoodism: Its Cause and Cure *1968 – Nancy & Lee – a collaboration with Nancy Sinatra *1968 – Something Special *1968 – Love and Other Crimes *1969 – The Cowboy and the Lady – a collaboration with Ann- Margret. *1969 – Forty *1970 – Cowboy in Sweden – two songs are on Forty, and one on Love and Other Crimes *1971 – Requiem for an Almost Lady *1971 – Nancy & Lee Again/Nancy & Lee - Did You Ever? – a collaboration with Nancy Sinatra *1972 – 13 *1973 – I'll Be Your Baby Tonight *1973 – Poet, Fool or Bum *1974 – The Stockholm Kid Live at Berns *1975 – A House Safe for Tigers *1976 – 20th Century Lee *1977 – Movin' On *1977 – Back on the Street Again *1993 – Gypsies & Indians – a collaboration with Anna Hanski *1999 – Farmisht, Flatulence, Origami, ARF!!! & Me... *2002 – For Every Solution There's a Problem *2004 – Nancy & Lee 3 – a collaboration with Nancy Sinatra *2006 – Cake or Death ReferencesExternal links * *Guardian interview Category:1929 births Category:2007 deaths Category:People from Creek County, Oklahoma Category:American country singer-songwriters Category:American male singer- songwriters Category:Record producers from Oklahoma Category:Mercury Records artists Category:Smash Records artists Category:Country musicians from Oklahoma Category:Jamie Records artists Category:Bell Records artists Category:People from Port Neches, Texas Category:American army personnel of the Korean War Category:Deaths from kidney cancer Category:Deaths from cancer in Nevada Category:20th-century American singers Category:Songwriters from Texas Category:Songwriters from Oklahoma Category:Singers from Oklahoma Category:Record producers from Texas Category:Country musicians from Texas Category:20th-century male singers ","title":"Lee Hazlewood"},{"id":"1621141","text":"Ayala may refer to: Places * Ayala/Aiara, a town in Álava province, Spain * Ayala Alabang, a barangay in Muntinlupa, Philippines * Ayala Avenue, a major thoroughfare crossing the Makati Central Business District, Philippines * Ayala Center, a commercial development at Makati, Philippines * Ayala, Magalang, a barrio in Magalang, Pampanga, Philippines * Ayala, Zamboanga, a barrio in Zamboanga City, Philippines * Ciudad Ayala, Morelos, Mexico * Ein Ayala, a semi-cooperative moshav in northern Israel People * Ayala (given name) * Ayala (surname), a surname of Basque origin, see the article for people carrying that surname * Ayala (musician), musician, singer, songwriter and TV presenter of The Ayala Show * Ayala (Star Trek), a fictional character on Star Trek: Voyager * Ayala Dormer, a fictional character in Anthony Trollope's Ayala's Angel Music * \\"Ayala\\", a song by XXXTentacion from 17 Organizations * Ayala Corporation, a holding company operating in the Philippines ** Ayala Land ** Ayala Malls * Ayala & Co., a champagne producer * Ruben S.

The book is a compendium of his talks explaining Buddhism given while opening the Karma Dzong meditation center in Boulder, Colorado. He expands on the concept in later seminars that became books such as Work, Sex, Money. He uses the term to describe mistakes spiritual seekers commit which turn the pursuit of spirituality into an ego building and confusion creating endeavor, based on the idea that ego development is counter to spiritual progress.Ferrer (2001) p.35 Conventionally, it is used to describe capitalist and spiritual narcissism, commercial efforts such as \\"new age\\" bookstores and wealthy lecturers on spirituality; it might also mean the attempt to build up a list of credentials or accumulate teachings in order to present oneself as a more realized or holy person.Potter and Potter (2006) pp.102-103 Author Jorge Ferrer equates the terms \\"Spiritual materialism\\" and \\"Spiritual Narcissism\\", though others draw a distinction, that spiritual narcissism is believing that one deserves love and respectSPIRITUAL NARCISSISM by V. GUNNAR LARSSON or is better than anotherHart (2004) p.218 because one has accumulated spiritual training instead of the belief that accumulating training will bring an end to suffering. Lords of Materialism In Trungpa's presentation, spiritual materialism can fall into three categories — what he calls the three \\"Lords of Materialism\\" (Tibetan: lalo literally \\"barbarian\\") — in which a form of materialism is misunderstood as bringing long term happiness but instead brings only short term entertainment followed by long term suffering: # Physical materialism is the belief that possessions can bring release from suffering. In Trungpa's view, they may bring temporary happiness but then more suffering in the endless pursuit of creating one's environment to be just right. Or on another level it may cause a misunderstanding like, \\"I am rich because I have this or that\\" or \\"I am a teacher (or whatever) because I have a diploma (or whatever).\\" # Psychological materialism is the belief that a particular philosophy, belief system, or point of view will bring release from suffering. So seeking refuge by strongly identifying with a particular religion,Carson (2003) p.20 philosophy, political party or viewpoint, for example, would be psychological materialism. From this the conventional usage of spiritual materialism arises, by identifying oneself as Buddhist or some other label, or by collecting initiations and spiritual accomplishments, one further constructs a solidified view of ego. Trungpa characterizes the goal of psychological materialism as using external concepts, pretexts, and ideas to prove that the ego-driven self exists, which manifests in a particular competitive attitude.Trungpa (2011), p.14-15 # Spiritual materialism is the belief that a certain temporary state of mind is a refuge from suffering. An example would be using meditation practices to create a peaceful state of mind, or using drugs or alcohol to remain in a numbed out or a euphoric state. According to Trungpa, these states are temporary and merely heighten the suffering when they cease. So attempting to maintain a particular emotional state of mind as a refuge from suffering, or constantly pursuing particular emotional states of mind like being in love, will actually lead to more long term suffering. Ego The underlying source of these three approaches to finding happiness is based, according to Trungpa, on the mistaken notion that one's ego is inherently existent and a valid point of view. He claims that is incorrect, and therefore the materialistic approaches have an invalid basis to begin with. The message in summary is, \\"Don't try to reinforce your ego through material things, belief systems like religion, or certain emotional states of mind.\\" In his view, the point of religion is to show you that your ego doesn't really exist inherently. Ego is something you build up to make you think you exist, but it is not necessary and in the long run causes more suffering.

After the 1994 elections, the Communist Party and the four other parties that comprised the FMLN dissolved themselves as separate organizations, merging into a singular FMLN with no competing internal organizations. At that point the Communist Party of El Salvador ceased to exist as an independent entity, though many of its leaders and members are still visible in the FMLN.

The ship was the first U.S. Navy vessel named for Samuel Tucker. Tucker was laid down by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company of Quincy, Massachusetts, in November 1914 and launched in May 1915. The ship was a little more than in length, nearly abeam, and had a standard displacement of . She was armed with four /50 caliber guns and had eight 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. Tucker was powered by a pair of steam turbines that propelled her at up to . After her April 1916 commissioning, Tucker sailed in the Atlantic and the Caribbean. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Tucker was part of the second U.S. destroyer squadron sent overseas. Patrolling the Irish Sea out of Queenstown, Ireland, Tucker made several rescues of passengers and crew from ships sunk by U-boats. For her part in rescuing crewmen from the Dupetit-Thouars in August 1918, Tucker received a commendation from the Préfet Maritime. In June, Tucker was transferred to Brest, France, and spent the remainder of the war there. Upon returning to the United State near the end of 1918, Tucker underwent repairs at the Boston Navy Yard. After a New England recruiting tour through October 1919, she was placed in reduced commission and then decommissioned in May 1921. In March 1926, Tucker was transferred to the United States Coast Guard to help enforce Prohibition as a part of the \\"Rum Patrol\\". She operated under the name USCGC Tucker (CG-23) until 1933; during her Coast Guard service, she was the first American ship to arrive at the crash site of Navy airship . After her transfer back to the Navy later in 1933, the ship was renamed DD-57 to free the name Tucker for another destroyer. She was sold for scrap and hulked in December 1936.  Design and construction  Tucker was authorized in 1913 as the lead ship of her class which, like the related , was an improved version of the s authorized in 1911. Construction of the vessel was awarded to Fore River Shipbuilding Company of Quincy, Massachusetts, which laid down her keel on 9 November 1914. Six months later, on 4 May 1915, Tucker was launched by sponsor Mrs. William Garty, the great-great-granddaughter of the ship's namesake, Samuel Tucker (1747–1833), a Continental Navy officer. As built, Tucker was in length and abeam and drew . The ship had a standard displacement of and displaced when fully loaded. Tucker had two Curtis steam turbines that drove her two screw propellers, and an additional steam turbine geared to one of the propeller shafts for cruising purposes. The power plant could generate and move the ship at speeds of up to , though Tucker reached a top speed of during her trials. Tuckers main battery consisted of four /50 Mark 9 guns,The 50 denotes the length of the gun barrels; in this case, the gun is 50 calibers, meaning that the gun is 50 times as long as it is in diameter, in this case. The Mark number is the version of the gun; in this case, the ninth U.S. Navy design of the 4-inch/50 gun. with each gun weighing in excess of . The guns fired armor-piercing projectiles at . At an elevation of 20°, the guns had a range of . Tucker was also equipped with eight torpedo tubes. The General Board of the United States Navy had called for two anti- aircraft guns for the Tucker-class ships, as well as provisions for laying up to 36 floating mines. From sources, it is unclear if these recommendations were followed for Tucker or any of the other ships of the class.  Early career  USS Tucker was commissioned into the United States Navy on 11 April 1916 under the temporary command of Lieutenant, junior grade, Frank Slingluff, Jr.; Lieutenant Commander Benyaurd B. Wygant assumed permanent command 13 days later. Following her commissioning, Tucker commenced trials off the east coast before reporting to Division 8, Destroyer Force, United States Atlantic Fleet. With World War I ongoing in Europe, Tucker and units of the Fleet conducted exercises and maneuvers in southern and Cuban waters into the spring of 1917. Steaming independently in the West Indies, she received word of the United States' declaration of war on 6 April 1917. Tucker joined the fleet at its anchorage in the York River before being ordered to proceed to the Boston Navy Yard, for fitting-out for war.  World War I  The immediate and pressing need for escort ships led to the deployment of American destroyers to Queenstown, Ireland; Tucker, , , , , and set out from Boston on 7 May 1917 as the second contingent of United States ships designated to operate in conjunction with British surface forces patrolling off the Irish coast. Arriving ten days later, Tucker and her sister ships soon commenced wartime operations. On 12 June, she rescued 47 survivors from the stricken merchantman ; on 1 August, she saved 39 men from , which had been torpedoed by German submarine . For the remainder of 1917 and into the late spring of 1918, Tucker operated out of Queenstown, hunting German submarines, escorting and convoying ships through the submarine-infested war zones, and providing assistance to ships in distress. In June 1918, Tucker joined the escorts working out of Brest, France. On 1 August, while steaming out to meet an inbound convoy, she received word that the group's escort, the French cruiser French cruiser Dupetit-Thouars, had been torpedoed and sunk by the German submarine SM U-62. The American destroyer soon arrived on the scene and helped to save the survivors of the stricken French warship from the waters of the Bay of Biscay. Tuckers efforts, and those of the five other American destroyers who were also present, were rewarded by a commendation from the Préfet Maritime, on behalf of the French Ministry of Marine. Tucker obtained her share of the submarine hunting the day after assisting in the rescue of Dupetit-Thuoars crew, on 8 August. Sighting a U-boat, Tucker sped to the attack, dropping depth bombs on the vessel. The British Admiralty gave credit to Tucker for a \\"possibly sunk\\" as a result of the attack. And the Commander of US Naval Forces in France authorized its commanding officer to paint a white star on the forward smokestack « to denote the fact that the USS Tucker has successfully engaged and put out of action an enemy submarine on 9 August 1918. » As antisubmarine warfare was in its infancy, however, attempts to verify the \\"kill\\" proved to be inconclusive. On 11 November 1918, the armistice was signed, and hostilities ceased along the war-torn Western Front.  Post-war  While American forces withdrew from Europe and headed home to the United States, Tucker carried passengers and mail between French and British ports. Departing from Brest for the last time on 16 December 1918, she headed for Boston, where she entered the navy yard for extended repairs. In July 1919, she departed Boston and cruised along the coastlines of Massachusetts and Maine, engaged in recruiting duty. In October 1919, she was placed in reserve in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she remained until placed out of commission on 16 May 1921. On 17 July 1920, Tucker was designated DD-57 under the Navy's new hull classification system.  United States Coast Guard career  Tucker on the \\"Rum Patrol\\" in the service of the United States Coast Guard On 17 January 1920, Prohibition was instituted by law in the United States. Soon, the smuggling of alcoholic beverages along the coastlines of the United States became widespread and blatant. The Treasury Department eventually determined that the United States Coast Guard simply did not have the ships to constitute a successful patrol. To cope with the problem, President Calvin Coolidge in 1924 authorized the transfer from the Navy to the Coast Guard of twenty old destroyers that were in reserve and out of commission. Tucker was activated and acquired by the Coast Guard on 25 March 1926, as part of a second group of five to augment the original twenty. Designated CG-23, Tucker was commissioned on 29 September, and joined the \\"Rum Patrol\\" to aid in the attempt to enforce prohibition laws. She served as the flagship of Division 4 of the Destroyer Force through October 1927, when she was transferred to Division 1. On 4 April 1933, the greatest disaster which aeronautics had experienced up to that time occurred off the New Jersey coast. The Navy airship crashed in a storm killing 73 men, including Rear Admiral William A. Moffett, Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics. Tucker received word of the crash and sped to the scene. Upon arrival, she found that the German motorship had rescued four men from the sea—one of whom died shortly after being rescued. The survivors were transferred to Tucker and were disembarked at the New York Navy Yard. After the United States Congress proposed the Twenty-first Amendment to end prohibition in February 1933, plans were made for Tucker to be returned to the Navy. On 26 May, Tucker arrived at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, and was decommissioned ten days later, on 5 June. Tucker was transferred back to the Navy on 30 June. On 1 November, Tucker was renamed DD-57 in order to free the name Tucker for a new destroyer of the same name. For a time, DD-57 served as a Sea Scout training ship at Sandy Hook, New Jersey. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 24 October 1936. DD-57 was sold on 10 December and reduced to a hulk on 23 December.

History  According to the opinion of historians and geographers such as Ptolemy, Diodorus Siculus and Strabo, Castellammare del Golfo was born as Emporium Segestanorum, port of Segesta, a nearby city which shared the same ordeals until its fall. The Arabs occupied Castellammare del Golfo from 827 AD, and called it \\"Al Madarig\\", which means \\"The Steps\\", probably due to an uphill steep street leading from the harbour to the area of the fortified bastion.

The Tucker class was the fourth of five classes of destroyers that were known as the \\"thousand tonners\\", because they were the first U.S. destroyers over displacement. The design of what became the Tucker class was the result of compromises between the General Board of the United States Navy and the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair. The General Board, tasked with creating an integrated battle fleet, wanted a larger ship that could serve in a scouting role and proposed a ship larger than the unique British destroyer of 1907, and more than twice the displacement of any previous U.S. destroyer. Input from Construction and Repair resulted in a design that was an incremental development of the , which itself was similar to the first of the thousand tonners, the (which displaced about a third more than the preceding ). The ships were built by four private American shipyards—Bath Iron Works, Fore River Shipbuilding Company, New York Shipbuilding Corporation, and William Cramp & Sons—and were laid down between February and November 1914; launched between April and July 1915; and commissioned into the U.S. Navy between July 1915 and May 1916. The ships had a median displacement of , were just over in length, and had a beam of about . Most of the ships had two direct-drive steam turbines and a single geared cruising turbine; was equipped with two geared steam turbines only and, as the first U.S. destroyer so equipped, greatly influenced later U.S. Navy destroyer designs. All of the ships were designed for a maximum speed of and a range of at more economical speeds. As built, they were armed with four guns and had four twin 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes with a load of eight torpedoes, but all were later equipped with depth charges. All six ships operated in the Atlantic or Caribbean until the U.S. entrance into World War I in April 1917, when all six were sent overseas to Queenstown, Ireland, for convoy escort duties. Several of the ships rescued passengers and crew from ships sunk by U-boats, and several had encounters with U-boats themselves; was torpedoed and sunk by in December 1917. All five surviving members of the class had returned to the United States by early 1919 and been decommissioned by June 1922. Between 1924 and 1926, four of the five (all but Wadsworth) were commissioned into the United States Coast Guard to help enforce Prohibition as a part of the \\"Rum Patrol\\". They were returned to U.S. Navy custody between 1934 and 1936, and had all been sold for scrapping by 1936.  Background  In September 1912, the General Board of the United States Navy asked the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair (C&R;) to develop plans for the next class of destroyers. The General Board asked for a design with four guns, six twin torpedo tubes, and twenty floating mines, that could travel at up to with steaming radius of .Friedman, pp. 29, 31. C&R; came back with a design for a long, displacement, triple-screw \\"super-destroyer\\" requiring to make the design speed of .Friedman, p. 31. The C&R; design was similar to, but larger than the unique British destroyer of 1907, and more than twice the displacement of the largest U.S. destroyers.Gardiner, p. 122.The s then under construction had a displacement of . The General Board, whose main concern was the integrated operation of the United States battle fleet,Friedman, p. 28. pushed for the design to provide more scouting capabilities for fleet operations.Friedman, p. 29. But the high cost of the design—$1,900,000 for hull and machinery vs. $790,000 for the ships—and the lack of operating experience with the —the first of the \\"thousand tonners\\" (destroyers exceeding displacement) which were just beginning to be launched—caused C&R; to resist the much larger design. The Chief Constructor of the Navy, the head of C&R;, pointed out that the British had not repeated the Swift design in the five years since her introduction, and noted that \\"a destroyer that gets too large loses many of the desirable features of the type\\". In November 1912, the General Board offered several alternatives to reduce the size of the destroyer, and was convinced by C&R; that the most practical solution was a design that shared much with the O'Brien class: matching that class' main battery and torpedo load but with a design speed of and the desired steaming radius. The General Board also specified that the ships be equipped with \\"two aeroplane guns, if they can be developed and installed\\", have provisions for laying thirty-six mines, and a strengthened bow for ramming. The C&R; design for the Tucker class, DD-57 through DD-62,Although the United States Navy's hull classification system in which destroyers were assigned the hull code of DD was not adopted until July 1920, most sources retroactively apply the numbering system. So, for example, the lead ship of the class is referred to in sources as rather than as Tucker (Destroyer No. 57), even though the latter name is the one she was known by throughout most of her U.S. Navy career. Similarly, because was sunk in 1917, she was never known by DD-61 while afloat, but is referred to by that hull code in sources. was approved by the Secretary of the Navy in December 1912, and authorized by Congress in 1913.  Design  As built, the Tucker-class ships were in length (overall), were between and abeam, and had a median draft of . The hull shape featured the distinctive high forecastle typical of U.S. destroyer classes since the 1908–09 , the first destroyers designed to be truly ocean-going vessels.Gardiner, p. 121. The ships displaced between with a median of . The ships were equipped with two propeller shafts and two Curtis steam turbines fed by four Yarrow boilers, providing a minimum of to achieve the design speed of .Gardiner, p. 123. For all of the ships except , the pair of main turbines was supplemented with a cruising turbine geared to one of the shafts. Wadsworth had no cruising turbines, but instead had her twin turbines geared directly to the propeller shafts—the first American destroyer so outfitted. She served as a testbed, and had a considerable effect on U.S. destroyer design after her trials in July 1915. The main battery of the Tucker class consisted of four /50 Mark 9 guns,The 50 denotes the length of the gun barrels; in this case, the gun is 50 calibers, meaning that the gun is 50 times as long as it is in diameter, in this case.

At an elevation of 20°, the guns had a range of . The Tucker class was also equipped with four twin torpedo tubes, for a total load of eight Mark 8 torpedoes. Although the General Board had called for two anti- aircraft guns for the Tucker class, they were not originally outfitted with the weapons; the was the first American destroyer class so armed. Likewise, there is no record of any of the Tucker ships being outfitted with mine-laying apparatus. During World War I, most American destroyers were used in anti- submarine warfare roles, and were equipped with depth charges and delivery systems, such as Y-guns and depth charge racks.Gardiner, p. 121. Tucker-class ships were equipped with depth charges during the war, but no specific mentions of the types of depth charges used or delivery system are recorded in available sources.

See, for example, The Cassin class, the first of the thousand tonners, displaced about a third more than the preceding . The introduction of the thousand tonners led to the Pauldings and other older, smaller displacement destroyers of previous classes to be dismissively called \\"flivvers\\", a nickname also commonly applied to the Ford Model T.Cashman, p. 278.According to Cashman (p. 278), a flivver—a portmanteau of \\"for the liver\\"—was any small, inexpensive automobile that shook the liver while in motion. The Tucker class was the fourth of the five classes of \\"thousand tonners\\". The earlier Cassin- (DD-43 to DD-46), Aylwin- (DD-47 to DD-50) and O'Brien-class (DD-51 to DD-56) ships were about shorter than the Tucker ships and had a lower displacement, between less than the median displacement of the Tuckers; the later Sampson-class (DD-63 to DD-68) ships were the same length and displaced more. All five classes were armed with four guns, but the torpedo size and complement varied. All were equipped with four twin torpedo tubes loaded with eight torpedoes except for the Sampsons (which had four triple tubes carrying twelve torpedoes), but the Cassin and Aylwin classes were armed with torpedoes; the rest with torpedoes. The Sampsons were the only group originally equipped with anti-aircraft guns, a pair of guns with a caliber of .  Construction  under construction at the Fore River Shipbuilding Company on 1 January 1915. The construction of the six Tucker-class ships was allocated to four U.S. shipbuilders. The Fore River Shipbuilding Company and Bath Iron Works built one ship each, while William Cramp and New York Shipbuilding each constructed a pair of Tucker destroyers.Gardiner, p. 123. The keels for all six ships were laid down between February and November 1914, with Wadsworth being the first and the last.Bauer and Roberts, p. 171. All were launched between April and July 1915, with Wadsworth again being the first and being the last. Wadsworth was commissioned in July 1915, three months after her launch; the rest were commissioned between January and May 1916, with the final ship to enter service.

After her transfer back to the Navy later in 1933, the ship was renamed DD-57 to free the name Tucker for another destroyer. She was sold for scrap and hulked in December 1936. = USS Conyngham (DD-58) = in dazzle camouflage, c. 1918 USS Conyngham (DD-58) was laid down by the William Cramp & Sons of Philadelphia in July 1914 and launched in July of the following year. She was the first U.S. Navy vessel named for Gustavus Conyngham. After her January 1916 commissioning, Conyngham sailed off the east coast and in the Caribbean. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Conyngham was part of the first U.S. destroyer squadron sent overseas. Patrolling the Irish Sea out of Queenstown, Ireland, Conyngham made several rescues of passengers and crew from ships sunk by U-boats. Conynghams commander was commended for actions related to what was thought at the time to be a \\"probable\\" kill of a German submarine. Upon returning to the United State in December 1918, Conyngham underwent repairs at the Boston Navy Yard. She remained there in reduced commission through 1921, with only brief episodes of activity. After returning to active service for about a year, she was decommissioned in June 1922. In June 1924, Conyngham was transferred to the United States Coast Guard to help enforce Prohibition as a part of the \\"Rum Patrol\\". She operated under the name USCGC Conyngham (CG-2) until 1933, when she was returned to the Navy. Later that year, the ship was renamed DD-58 to free the name Conyngham for another destroyer. She was sold for scrap in August 1934. = USS Porter (DD-59) = during trials, 1916 USS Porter (DD-59) was laid down by the William Cramp & Sons of Philadelphia in August 1914 and launched in August of the following year. She was the second U.S. Navy vessel named in honor of both David Porter and his son David Dixon Porter. After her April 1916 commissioning, Porter conducted her shakedown cruise in the Caribbean. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Porter was part of the first U.S. destroyer squadron sent overseas. Patrolling the Irish Sea out of Queenstown, Ireland, Porter severely damaged the German submarine in April 1918. Upon returning to the United States after the war, Porter operated off the east coast until she was decommissioned in June 1922. In June 1924, Porter was transferred to the United States Coast Guard to help enforce Prohibition as a part of the \\"Rum Patrol\\". She operated under the name USCGC Porter (CG-7) until 1933, when she was returned to the Navy. Later that year, the ship was renamed DD-59 to free the name Porter for another destroyer. She was sold for scrap in August 1934. = USS Wadsworth (DD-60) = , c. 1917–1918 USS Wadsworth (DD-60) was laid down by the Bath Iron Works of Bath, Maine, in February 1914 and launched in April 1915. She was the first U.S. Navy vessel named for Alexander Scammel Wadsworth. Wadsworths geared steam turbine power plant was a successful prototype that greatly influenced U.S. destroyer designs after 1915. After her July 1915 commissioning, Wadsworth served on the neutrality patrol off the east coast and in the Caribbean. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Wadsworth was the flagship of the first U.S. destroyer squadron sent overseas. Patrolling the Irish Sea out of Queenstown, Ireland, Wadsworth reported several encounters with U-boats in the first months overseas. She was transferred to Brest, France, in March 1918, and spent the remainder of the war there. Upon returning to the United State at the end of 1918, Wadsworth underwent a five-month overhaul. She served as a plane guard for the Navy's transatlantic flight attempt by four Navy-Curtiss flying boats in May. After two years in reduced commission in August, Wadsworth was reactivated in May 1921. She was decommissioned in June 1922, and spent nearly 14 years in reserve at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in January 1936, sold in June, and scrapped in August. = USS Jacob Jones (DD-61) = underway, 1916 USS Jacob Jones (DD-61) was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding of Camden, New Jersey, in August 1914 and launched in May of the following year. She was the first U.S. Navy vessel named in honor of Jacob Jones. After her February 1916 commissioning, Jacob Jones conducted patrols off the New England coast. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Jacob Jones was sent overseas. Patrolling the Irish Sea out of Queenstown, Ireland, Jacob Jones rescued the survivors of several ships, notably picking up over 300 from the sunken armed merchant cruiser . On 6 December, Jacob Jones was steaming independently from Brest, France, for Queenstown, when she was torpedoed and sunk by German submarine with the loss of 66 officers and men, becoming the first United States destroyer to ever be sunk by enemy action, and the only destroyer lost to the enemy by the US Navy in World War I. Jacob Jones sank in eight minutes without issuing a distress call; the German submarine commander, Kapitänleutnant Hans Rose, after rescuing two badly injured Jacob Jones crewmen, radioed the American base at Queenstown with the coordinates for the survivors before leaving the area. = USS Wainwright (DD-62) = , c. 1916–1922 USS Wainwright (DD-62) was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding of Camden, New Jersey, in September 1914 and launched in June of the following year. She was the first U.S. Navy vessel named in honor of U.S. Navy officers Jonathan Wainwright and Jonathan Wainwright, Jr. (father and son), and Commander Richard Wainwright (cousin of the elder Jonathan). After her May 1916 commissioning, Wainwright sailed off the east coast and in the Caribbean. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Wainwright was part of the first U.S. destroyer squadron sent overseas. Patrolling the Irish Sea out of Queenstown, Ireland, Wainwright made several unsuccessful attacks on U-boats, and rescued survivors of several ships sunk by the German craft. Upon returning to the United State after the war, Wainwright resumed operations with the destroyers of the Atlantic Fleet until May 1922, when she was decommissioned. In April 1926, Wainwright was transferred to the United States Coast Guard to help enforce Prohibition as a part of the \\"Rum Patrol\\". She operated under the name USCGC Wainwright (CG-24) until April 1934, when she was returned to the Navy. She was sold for scrap in August 1934.

Een traditionele Goudse lekkernij Gouda-Online.nl. Retrieved on 2 January 2008. Stroopwafel. Van Dale Taalweb. Retrieved on 2 January 2008. First made in the Dutch city of Gouda, stroopwafels are popular throughout the Netherlands and the former Dutch Empire and are well-known Dutch dishes.  Description  A stroopwafel's wafer layers are made from a stiff dough of flour, butter, brown sugar, yeast, milk, and eggs that has been pressed in a hot waffle iron until crisped. While still warm, the waffles have their edges removed with a cookie cutter, which allows the remaining disc to be easily separated into top and bottom wafers. A caramel filling made from syrup, brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon—also warm—is spread between the wafers before the waffle is reassembled. The caramel sets as it cools, thereby binding the waffle halves together. History According to Dutch culinary folklore, stroopwafels were first made in Gouda either during the late 18th centuryHistory & recipe . Stroopwafelshop.com. Retrieved on 3 January 2007. or the early 19th century by bakers repurposing scraps and crumbs by sweetening them with syrup. One story ascribes the invention of the stroopwafel to the baker Gerard Kamphuisen, which would date the first stroopwafels from somewhere between 1810, the year he opened his bakery, and 1840, the year of the oldest known recipe for syrup waffles. Stroopwafels were not found outside Gouda until 1870, by which point the city was home to around 100 syrup-waffle bakers. (As, however, the Netherlands lacked a culinary tradition of waffle making, it is possible that the stroopwafel originated in Belgium or Flanders.) After 1870 stroopwafels began to appear in other cites, and in the 20th century, factory-made stroopwafels were introduced. By 1960, there were 17 factories in Gouda alone, of which four are still open. Today, stroopwafels are sold at markets, by street vendors, and in supermarkets, and since 2016 United Airlines has been serving stroopwafels as a breakfast snack on its domestic flights. As a former Dutch colony, Indonesia also inherited the dish. It is locally known as wafel setrop or wafel sirop and is often eaten with sweet dressings such as honey and sirop.  Variants  Cookies similar to the stroopwafel may be found in parts of the Netherlands. Wafers with honey instead of syrup are sold as honingwafels, and cookies with a caramel syrup are sold as stroopkoeken. Crumbs of stroopwafels (trimmings from manufacturing) are also sold in candy cones. A thin wafer with a sugar filling is widely known in northern France, particularly in Lille. This local waffle is known as the \\"gaufre fourrée lilloise\\", which consists of two thin wafer waffles filled with cassonade sugar and vanilla. A recipe for such a waffle with vanilla filling first appeared in 1849, in the workshop of the renowned patisserie, Maison Méert, from Lille. Waffles with a filling date back to the Middle Ages, as the famous guidebook for married women, Le Ménagier de Paris, compiled in 1393, already includes recipes of waffles with a cheese filling.

In French cuisine, lardons are also used for larding, by threading them with a needle into meats that are to be braised or roasted. Lardons are not normally smoked, and they are made from pork that has been cured with salt. In French cuisine, lardons are served hot in salads and salad dressings, as well as on some tartes flambées, stews such as beef bourguignon, quiches such as quiche Lorraine, in omelettes, with potatoes, and for other dishes such as coq au vin. The Oxford English Dictionary defines \\"lardon\\" as \\"one of the pieces of bacon or pork which are inserted in meat in the process of larding\\", giving primacy to that process. According to the Middle English Dictionary, the earliest occurrence of the word is in 1381, in the work Pegge Cook; it advises to insert lardons in cranes and herons. Preparation Lardons may be prepared from different cuts of pork, including pork belly and fatback, or from cured cuts such as bacon or salt pork. According to food writer Regina Schrambling, when the lardon is salt-cured but not smoked in the style of American bacon, \\"the flavor comes through cleanly, more like ham but richer because the meat is from the belly of the pig, not the leg\\". The meat (fat) is usually cut into small strips or cubes about one centimeter ( inch) wide, then blanched or fried. Some chefs recommend using pancetta as a substitute; ham is also suggested. Usage Tartiflette with lardons Fougasse de Foix, a provincial French bread filled with melted gruyère cheese (reblochon cheese can also be used), bacon lardons, and crème fraîche It is common for the lardons to be used for two distinct purposes in the same dish. The fat rendered from the cubed pork is good for sautéing vegetables or meat during the early stages of a recipe, and the crisp browned pork cubes can be added as a garnish or ingredient just before serving: \\"the crispy bits are used to add a smoky, salty flavor and a pleasant crunch to all kinds of dishes\\". The rich flavor pairs well with cheeses and sturdy leaf vegetables like spinach and frisée, for which the hot rendered fat can be used as part of the salad dressing. Lardons are frequently used in French cuisine to flavor salads, stews (such as beef bourguignon and Julia Child's coq au vin), quiches (quiche Lorraine), potatoes, omelettes and other dishes. A particular Parisian use of lardons is in the salade aux lardons, a wilted salad (often made with frisée (endive) lettuce) in which the lettuce leaves are wilted slightly by the addition of still-hot lardons and hot vinaigrette. A nineteenth-century recipe for a pie à la chasse calls for beef to be larded with lardons made of ham and bacon. A traditional dish from the Alsace region is the tarte flambée, a thin pizza- like bread covered with crème fraiche, onion, and lardons. A regional specialty from the Savoie is tartiflette, which is made with potatoes, reblochon cheese, cream, and lardons. Larding Larding of a piece of beef, using a larding needle. A traditional use for lardons is in a technique called \\"larding\\", in which long strips of chilled pork fat are threaded (with the use of a needle) into meats that are to be braised or roasted, such as beef filets or veal (especially lean cuts), poultry,Dolby 474. and lean fish such as salmon.Willan 60. These lardons are to be cut in strips about 3 mm thick and 3 mm wide, and it is essential that the fat be chilled before cutting and threading. The technique is explained at length in the classic book of French cuisine La bonne cuisine de Madame E. Saint-Ange, which details two techniques: surface larding, or \\"studding\\", in which the lardons are threaded onto the surface, and interior larding, in which the lardons are left in a channel (made with a larger-sized needle than is used for studding) inside the meat. Madame St. Ange recommends larding for braised calf's sweetbreadsÉbrard 303. (as does the French Laundry cookbook) and for a specific style of cooking hare.Ébrard 416. American food writer James Peterson specifically recommends using fatback for larding; salt pork, he says, \\"has a funny taste and won't work\\".Peterson 523. Julia Child recommends using lard or porkbellies (pancetta); she too thinks that neither salt pork nor bacon work, and suggests blanching these first, to get rid of the overwhelming cured or smoked flavors. The origin of larding is in the Middle Ages, when edible meat was sourced from hunting game and was often too lean and tough because of the animal's natural physical activity; larding provided the equivalent of today's marbling. The needle used is a larding needle (also \\"barding needle\\" or lardoir). There are two basic kinds of larding needle, hollow and U-shaped. Hollow larding needles are about 5 mm in diameter with some sort of teeth or hook to keep the lard strip attached; they are passed completely through the meat. U-shaped larding needles, often called by the French name lardoir, are long needles with a \\"U\\" cross-section. Four larding needles, accompanied by two crossed turning spits, are found in the coat of arms of the Confrérie de la Chaîne des Rôtisseurs, a French gastronomic society. In other cuisines In many cuisines around the world, pork fat is used as a flavoring, and lardons are found in various other cultures. In Puerto Rico, they are called tocino and are added to dishes such as arroz con gandules. Lardon is simular to the eastern european salo.

It is also known as the Calton Hill Observatory. The site is enclosed by a boundary wall with a monument to John Playfair, president of the Edinburgh Astronomical Institution, in the southeast corner. The oldest part is the Gothic Tower in the southwest corner, facing Princes Street and Edinburgh Castle. It is also known as Observatory House, the Old Observatory, or after its designer James Craig House. The central building with the appearance of a Greek temple is the Playfair Building, named after the building's designer William Henry Playfair. This houses the 6-inch (15 cm) refractor in its dome and the 6.4-inch (16 cm) transit telescope in its eastern wing. The largest dome of the site is the City Dome in the northeast corner. During the early 20th century this contained a 22-inch (56 cm) refractor.  History  Thomas Short's observatory = In 1776 Thomas Short returned to Edinburgh, bringing with him a 12-foot (3.7 m, focal length) reflecting telescope made by his late brother James Short. He intended to open a public observatory on Calton Hill as a commercial enterprise. However, in 1736 Colin Maclaurin, professor of mathematics at the University of Edinburgh, had collected funds for a university observatory. Due to the Porteous Riots and the Jacobite rising of 1745 the funds were left unused. These were made available to build Short's observatory; and the City of Edinburgh provided a plot of land on Calton Hill. The observatory was to be open to university students. James Craig designed the observatory, which, under Robert Adam's influence, was to look like a fortification with a wall and Gothic towers at its corners. The city controlled the building project, but the money ran out after only the first of the towers was built. Short moved into this as residence and ran the observatory until his death in 1788. An actual observatory, smaller than originally planned, was also built where the Playfair Building is now. After Short's death the observatory was kept going by his family for a while, then leased to opticians and finally abandoned around 1807. The site reverted to the city. Short's daughter Maria Theresa Short was to return to Edinburgh in 1827. She ran a second – a popular and commercial rather than scientific – observatory elsewhere on Calton Hill. In 1850 this was removed and she moved to Castle Hill, where her enterprise eventually became today's Camera Obscura on the Royal Mile. = The Royal Observatory = Gothic Tower in 1792 Gothic Tower in 2013 In 1812 the observatory was handed over to the Edinburgh Astronomical Institution, which opened its popular observatory in the Gothic Tower. In 1818 work began on the Playfair Building. Designed by William Henry Playfair this was to become the scientific observatory of the Institution. Following a loyal address to George IV in 1822 this became the Royal Observatory. Again the funds proved insufficient, so that the purchase of instruments and the employment of an observer depended on funding from the Government. After much delay the instrumentation was completed in 1831 with delivery of the transit telescope. Fraunhofer had made the lens, but after his death it fell to Repsold – and after his death to Repsold's son – to complete and install the instrument. In 1834 Thomas Henderson took up the position of observer. This was now the post of Astronomer Royal for Scotland and Regius Professor of Astronomy in the University of Edinburgh. Until his death in 1844 he worked on Calton Hill. In 1839 he published his results regarding the distance of alpha Centauri based on observations he had made 1832/33 at the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope. In 1846 Charles Piazzi Smyth became second Astronomer Royal for Scotland and set about reducing and publishing the backlog of Henderson's observations. In 1847 the Astronomical Institution – having run out of money – handed the Royal Observatory over to the Government. Playfair Building and Playfair Monument in 1824 According to the English journalist William Jerdan, naturalist and oceanographer Edward Forbes, F.R.S. and his \\"The Red Lions\\", a dining club for younger members of the British Association, (named after the tavern where the first meeting was held), had occasion to run up to the observatory of Calton Hill for astronomical studies. The main purpose of the observatory was a time service. The transits of stars through the meridian were observed and used to keep the observatory clock, a sidereal clock manufactured by Robert Bryson, accurate. Accurate time was important for navigation, and mariners would bring ships' chronometers from the port of Leith up to Calton Hill for adjustment. In 1854 the time ball was installed on Nelson's Monument next to the observatory and visible from the port. This was controlled by electrical pulses from the observatory clock. A few years later the One O'Clock Gun on Edinburgh Castle was added. This was also controlled through an electrical wire, spanning the city from Calton Hill to the Castle. Today the time ball and One O' Clock Gun are tourist attractions. They are no longer controlled from a state of the art clock, but are triggered \\"by hand\\". By 1888, when Smyth resigned, through underfunding the observatory's equipment had become largely obsolete. Also, the site had originally not been chosen through scientific investigation and its proximity to the city was causing problems. In 1896 the Royal Observatory moved to a new site on Blackford Hill. The Calton Hill Observatory, once again, reverted to the City of Edinburgh. = The City Observatory = Door to the City Observatory. In the wake of the Royal Observatory moving to Blackford Hill, a new City Observatory was created on Calton Hill toward the end of the 19th century. The 6-inch (15 cm) Cooke refractor was donated by William McEwan and installed in the dome on the Playfair Building. Additional domes were built for a 13-inch (33 cm) reflector donated by Robert Cox and for a 13-inch (33 cm) refractor transferred from the Dunecht observatory near Aberdeen. Only remnants of these two domes remain today. The City Dome was built to house a 22-inch (56 cm) refractor. This did not perform very well and was dismantled in 1926. The dome remained and was used as a lecture theatre. The observatory opened in 1898 with William Peck as City Astronomer. After his death in 1925 his assistant John McDougal Field continued to run the City Observatory. In 1924 the Astronomical Society of Edinburgh was formed with Field as first president. Peck and Ralph Sampson, the then Astronomer Royal for Scotland, were honorary presidents. Field died in 1937; and in 1938 the observatory was leased to the Society, which ran the City Observatory until vandalism and theft of roofing material rendered the site unusable in 2009.Astronomical Society of Edinburgh (2009). \\"Closure of the City Observatory\\".

It was founded in 1953 as R. A. Moog Co. by Robert Moog and his father and was renamed Moog Music in 1972. Its early instruments included various Moog modular synthesizer systems, including the world's first commercial synthesizer, followed by the launch of the Minimoog in 1970, which became one of the most coveted and influential electronic instruments of all time. In 1971, following a recession, Robert Moog sold Moog Music to Norlin Musical Instruments, where he remained employed as a designer until 1977. In 1978, he founded a new company, Big Briar. Moog Music declared bankruptcy in 1987 and the Moog Music trademark was returned to Robert Moog in 2002 when Big Briar resumed operations under the name Moog Music. Moog Music also manages Moogfest, a pioneering electronic music and music technology festival in Durham, NC.  History  1953–1967: R. A. Moog Co. = Robert Moog with a variety of his own synthesizers Herbert Deutsch, collaborator and friend of Robert Moog Mike Adams, current CEO of Moog Music, Inc. pictured on the right Robert Moog founded R. A. Moog Co. with his father in 1953 at the age of 19 in Trumansburg, New York, selling theremin kits to finance his college and graduate school education. In 1963, experimental composer Herbert Deutsch introduced himself to Moog at a music education conference in Rochester, New York after Deutsch had built a theremin following Moog's design. The two of them worked together to build the first modular voltage-controlled synthesizer. = 1967–1971: R. A. Moog, Inc. = By 1967, R. A. Moog, Co. had become a larger enterprise, continuing to sell its theremin kits but with sales mainly focused on the commercial Moog synthesizer. Though the Moog synthesizer's sound had rapidly become iconic with the success of Wendy Carlos's Switched-On Bach, the instrument nonetheless did not sell well due to its size and impracticality. The company gradually ran deep into debt, turning a profit only one year of its existence – 1969, following the 'Switched-On' sensation ignited by Carlos. = 1971–1977: Moog Musonics, Moog Music, Inc., changes of management, and financial duress = In November 1971, rival company muSonics bought R. A. Moog, Inc. and relocated the company to Williamsville, New York. An old factory at the north end of Academy Street was purchased. The company was renamed Moog Musonics, then Moog Music, Inc. In 1972, former televangelist and successful salesman David VanKouvering joined the company as VP of Marketing, creating a network of retail stores throughout the United States and then the entire world. Despite the increased commercial success the company saw with the introduction of the Minimoog than with previous products, competition with contemporary manufacturers such as ARP Instruments, Oberheim Electronics, and Electronic Music Studios drove the company steadily deeper into debt. Moog Music, Inc. was ultimately sold to Norlin Industries in 1973. At this point, rival companies such as the aforementioned ARP Instruments were producing both monophonic and polyphonic synthesizers that rapidly outpaced the Moog in popularity. By 1975, ARP owned 40% of the synthesizer market share, effectively boxing out Moog Music, Inc. In 1976, Norlin moved the company to a facility on Walden Avenue in Cheektowaga. In 1977, once his contract with Norlin expired, Robert Moog officially left the company to pursue his own ventures, founding the firm Big Briar. = 1978–1987: Contract manufacturing, digital synthesis, and bankruptcy = By 1978, Moog Music, Inc. had released a number of followup products after the success of the Minimoog, including the Vocoder, the Multimoog, the Polymoog, and a series of Taurus bass pedals. Despite numerous artists taking up these products, none of these synthesizers ever achieved the same level of success that the Minimoog did. As such, the company began contract manufacturing in 1981 in various other industries, including subway system repairs and air conditioning systems. Around the same time, digital synthesis was swiftly becoming a viable alternative to analog synthesizers. The Fairlight CMI, released 1979, was an expensive though fully formed digital synthesizer and sampler; in 1983, the introduction of the MIDI interface allowed rival Yamaha to release the world's first commercially successful digital synthesizer, the DX7. Though Moog Music, Inc. would attempt to pivot its business model to produce digital synthesizers, the company officially declared bankruptcy in 1987. = 2000–present: Legal battle, Moog Music Inc.'s return to Robert Moog, analog revival, and transition to employee owned model = As digital synthesizers rapidly became ubiquitous, the 1990s saw a rise in nostalgia for the iconic analog sound of Moog and Minimoog synthesizers, with musicians like David Foster continuing to use them. Minimoogs began fetching high prices as collector's items. In 1994, the Moog Music trademark expired and was purchased by Don Martin; a legal battle ensued in 2000 over ownership of the name, and it was ultimately returned to Robert Moog in 2002. The company moved to Asheville, North Carolina, and continued its development of products created under Robert Moog's former company Big Briar, such as the Moogerfooger pedals and theremins, as well as introducing numerous new products such as the Minimoog Voyager, Little Phatty, Sub 37, and Mother 32 some of which continue to be produced and sold today. The company has seen fiscal growth and increased interest due in part to the analog revival, evidenced by the introduction of so many new analog synthesizers being released by companies such as Moog, Korg, Arturia, and Dave Smith Instruments, that has continued climbing to reach a high point in the 2010s. After Robert Moog died in 2005 due to complications arising from brain cancer, his collaborator Michael Adams took over the company as president. The company has since shifted to being largely employee owned, with its 62 employees owning 49% of the company's shares in 2015. The company has in recent years seen the results of a strong incentive to introduce new products to meet the demands generated by today's market and have also produced limited edition reissues of historic Moog synthesizers as well as reaching out into the emerging Eurorack synthesizer market with instruments such as the semi-modular synthesizers, the Mother 32, DFAM, Grandmother, Matriarch, and Subharmonicon.  Major products  1964 – Moog synthesizer = First commercial Moog synthesizer, constructed 1964 At the prompting of composer Herbert Deutsch, Moog invented his now iconic Moog modular synthesizer in 1964. Defined by its use of modules, or independent circuits that performed distinctive tasks – oscillators, filters, amplifiers, envelope generators – the Moog synthesizer allowed users to connect different modules in arbitrary configurations to create remarkably complex sounds. Famously, it also employed a keyboard interface, as opposed to contemporary synthesizer manufacturer Buchla Electronic Musical Instruments who chose to explore alternative control methods instead of using the immediately familiar piano-like interface. Moog went on to present the synthesizer at the 1964 Audio Engineering Society conference, where it rapidly gained notoriety. The Moog saw some measure of success as experimental artists as Paul Beaver, Suzanne Ciani, and David Borden began to employ it in their work, and the rise of psychedelic rock in the 1960s saw numerous commercial artists employ the Moog in their music, including The Byrds, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and The Doors. Perhaps the greatest commercial success for the Moog synthesizer arrived in 1968 with Wendy Carlos's seminal album Switched-On Bach selling over a million copies and winning three Grammy Awards. The success of that album prompted a brief fad of 'Switched-On' music that faded away by 1970. = 1970 – Minimoog = The Minimoog, introduced 1970 Despite the success of the Moog, its relatively large size made it impractical for general use. Together with engineers Jim Scott and Bill Hemsath, Moog built the Minimoog. The Minimoog employed the minimal number of modules possible and did away with patch cords, instead hardwiring the various modules together. Furthermore, the Minimoog introduced the pitch wheel, enabling vibrato and pitch-bending an interval of a perfect fifth above or below the note played on the keyboard. Its compact size and range of available sounds allowed the Minimoog to be a comparative success, selling over 13,000 units over the next decade. Pink Floyd, Stevie Wonder, Herbie Hancock, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, and Tangerine Dream were among the numerous musicians who used the Minimoog. Other variations on the Minimoog continued to be produced, until the company simply decided to re-release the Minimoog in 2016. = 1975 – Taurus = The Moog Taurus, with its organ-style pedals The first true Moog bass instrument was the Moog Taurus, a pedal- operated analog synthesizer. Like the Moog, it remained a monophonic analog subtractive synthesizer, initially with 13 pedals in its first model. The Taurus II was expanded to include 18 pedals, and the Taurus III returned to 13. The Taurus was picked up by various progressive rock bands, including Led Zeppelin, Rush (band), Yes, Genesis, and Dream Theater. = 1978 – Vocoder = Though Moog had developed his own vocoder in 1968, Moog Music's commercial product was not released until 1978 and was based almost entirely on Harald Bode's design. Many other companies already were releasing their own vocoders, including Korg, Roland, Electronic Music Studios, and more. Its lack of support for MIDI has made it less enduringly popular than its counterparts. Musicians who used the Moog Vocoder include Saga (band), Wendy Carlos, The Moog Cookbook, and filmmaker/composer John Carpenter. = 1998 – Moogerfooger = A Moogerfooger with low-pass filter functionality The Moogerfooger, introduced under Big Briar, is an analog effects pedal that essentially allowed users to apply the modules that constituted the original Moog design to arbitrary sound inputs. Some of the effects included ring modulation, low- pass filtration, ladder filtration, and flanging. The Moogerfooger was successful, and saw a variety of models produced. It was discontinued in 2018, after 20 years of production. = 2002 – Minimoog Voyager = In 2002, on reacquiring the Moog Music trademark, the company began to produce the Minimoog Voyager, effectively an updated version of the iconic Minimoog. The Voyager famously featured a true analog signal path from oscillators to output, but integrated digital controls that made storing presets, along with many other features, available to the Minimoog family. = 2006 – Little Phatty = The Minimoog Voyager, an update on the classic Minimoog The Little Phatty, introduced in 2006, was Moog Music's answer to demand for a portable, affordable analog signal path synthesizer. It was the last instrument that Robert Moog participated in the design of and was released by the company shortly after Robert's death in 2005. = 2013 – Sub Phatty = The Moog Sub Phatty, featuring an update on the Phatty series circuitry With the release of the Sub Phatty in 2013, Moog Music introduced the first synthesizer with an entirely new circuitry schematic since Robert Moog's death in 2005. This new synthesizer featured a new oscillator design with an updated analog sound an increased panel dive edit-ability. This popularity of this instrument inspired multiple subsequent versions from the company with the release of the Sub 37 and Subsequent 37. These synthesizers introduced additional features such as a sequencer and brought edit-ability up from the dive format to the immediate accessibility of the front panel. = 2015 – Mother-32 = Embracing renewed interest in modular synthesis and the ever growing Eurorack synthesizer standard's popularity, Moog Music introduced the Mother-32 as a Eurorack compatible synthesizer featuring Moog circuitry and sound. They have since released a number of modules as well as modular and semi-modular synthesizers. = 2018 – Grandmother = Following in the footsteps of the early modular synthesizer reissues the company introduced in the 2010s and the Mother-32 and other Eurorack friendly options of the same decade, Moog Music introduced the semi-modular Moog Grandmother synthesizer, offering buyers of Moog instruments the freedom of modular patchability combined with the immediate accessibility of a fixed path synthesizer. The synthesizer again yielded an expanded version released by the company named the Moog Matriarch in 2019.  Moogfest  An excited participant headed towards a Moogfest stage in 2014. Moogfest is the name of a festival started in 2004 in New York City that was founded to honor the work of Robert Moog, better known to the electronic music community as Bob Moog, as well as electronic music and, eventually, technology and development. It eventually moved to Asheville, NC in 2010 and ended its affiliation with AC Entertainment in 2012. The festival, which, after its first relocation, brought a boom to Moog Music Inc.'s corporate home in downtown Asheville in part thanks to the festival's sizable attendance, eventually relocated to Durham, NC due to an increased desire to bolster the tech and development arms of the festival, taking into consideration Durham's status as an up and coming tech center. The festival has attracted high profile acts such as Keith Emerson, Laurie Anderson, Brian Eno, and Jónsi of Sigur Rós as well as numerous emerging and experimental groups and artists. Additionally, the festival features workshops and presentations that focus on instrument development and building (for instance the Moog Werkstatt-Ø1 was initially offered as a festival-build activity), music tech, and research.

It was originally known as the Instrument Society of America. The society is more commonly known by its acronym, ISA, and the society's scope now includes many technical and engineering disciplines. ISA is one of the foremost professional organizations in the world for setting standards and educating industry professionals in automation. Instrumentation and automation are some of the key technologies involved in nearly all industrialized manufacturing. Modern industrial manufacturing is a complex interaction of numerous systems. Instrumentation provides regulation for these complex systems using many different measurement and control devices. Automation provides the programmable devices that permit greater flexibility in the operation of these complex manufacturing systems. ISA provides leadership and education in the professions that it serves, assisting engineers, technicians, and research scientists, as well as many others, in keeping pace with the rapidly changing industry. ISA professionals work in numerous fields and may provide expertise in diverse areas ranging from environmental quality to automobile manufacturing, to nearly any technological field in use today. In recent years as the organization has modernized and broadened its scope, this has branched out to even more fields such as network security personnel, programmers, chemical engineers and more. In 2019, ISA announced the formation of the ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance to promote the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards, which are the world’s only consensus- based cybersecurity standard for automation and control system applications. Structure The International Society of Automation is a non-profit member- driven organization, which is built on a backbone of volunteers. Volunteers, working together with the ISA's full-time staff of over 75, are key to the ongoing mission and success of the organization. The ISA has a strong leadership development program that develops volunteer leaders as they get involved with the organization's many different facets. ISA has several different ways that volunteers get involved from the section, division, and standards roots of the organization. ISA members are typically assigned an ISA Section (local chapter) which is related to their geographic location. Members can then join ISA Divisions which correspond to their individual technical interests. ISA Standards Committees are open to both ISA members and non- members to become involved with. In addition to the member-driven aspects of the ISA, the organization itself is divided into departments headed by a director. These departments are: * Education, Training & Publications * Marketing & Graphics * Membership * IT * Sales * Standards * Finance * Customer/Member Service History ISA was officially established as the Instrument Society of America on 28 April 1945, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The society grew out of the desire of 18 local instrument societies to form a national organization. It was the brainchild of Richard Rimbach of the Instruments Publishing Company. Rimbach is recognized as the founder of ISA. Industrial instruments, which became widely used during World War II, continued to play an ever-greater role in the expansion of technology after the war. Individuals like Rimbach and others involved in industry saw a need for the sharing of information about instruments on a national basis, as well as for standards and uniformity. The Instrument Society of America addressed that need. Albert F. Sperry, chairman of Panelit Corporation, became ISA's first president in 1946. In that same year, the Society held its first conference and exhibit in Pittsburgh. The first standard, RP 5.1 Instrument Flow Plan Symbols, followed in 1949, and the first journal, which eventually became today's InTech Magazine, was published in 1954. In the years following, ISA continued to expand its products and services, increasing the size and scope of the ISA conference and exhibition, developing symposia, offering professional development and training, adding technical Divisions, and even producing films about measurement and control. Membership grew from 900 in 1946 to 6,900 in 1953, and as of 2019, ISA members number approximately 32,000 from over 100 countries. In 1980, ISA moved its headquarters to Research Triangle Park (RTP), North Carolina, and a training center was established in nearby Raleigh. In 1997, the headquarters and training center were consolidated in a new building in RTP, where the society's day-to-day activities are managed by a professional staff of approximately 75. Recognizing the fact that ISA's technical scope had grown beyond instruments and that its reach went beyond \\"America\\", in the fall of 2000 the ISA Council of Society Delegates approved a legal name change to ISA—The Instrumentation, Systems, and Automation Society. Today, ISA's corporate branding strategy focuses exclusively on the highly recognizable letters, though ISA's official, legal name remains the same. In 2006, ISA became the founding sponsor of the Automation Federation (AF), an umbrella organization under which associations and societies engaged in manufacturing and process automation activities can work more effectively to fulfill their missions. It will coordinate the work of member organizations engaged in the advancement of the science and engineering of automation technologies and applications. Along with ISA, the charter member organizations of the AF are OMAC (Organization for Machine Automation and Control), WBF (the organization for production technology), and WINA (Wireless Industrial Networking Alliance). In recent years, ISA has assumed a more global orientation, hiring multilingual staff and a director of global operations, chartering new sections in several countries outside the United States and Canada, issuing publications in Spanish, and in 2002 ISA elected its first president from outside North America. On October 2, 2007, the Council of Society Delegates deliberated a proposal to change the society's legal name to \\"International Society of Automation\\". A majority vote favored the action. However, since the 2/3 majority required for a bylaws change was not achieved, the proposal was not adopted. On October 13, 2008, the Council of Society Delegates deliberated a proposal to change the society's legal name to \\"International Society of Automation\\". The majority vote favored the action and the proposal was adopted. Membership ISA membership is organized into particular grades: Honorary, Fellow, Senior Member, Member, and Student Member. Honorary membership is conferred only upon those individuals who have made noteworthy contributions to the profession, and does not require payment of dues. Professional members pay dues of $100 per year, and student dues are $10 annually. Members in certain countries with lower per capita GDP (relative to US & Europe) may pay dues at a reduced rate, and a grade of \\"virtual member\\", with very limited benefits is available for annual dues of $5 to students in certain circumstances. After 25 years of membership and satisfaction of an age requirement, members are eligible to become Life Members and exempt from dues payment. The benefits of ISA membership include, among other things, affiliation with an ISA section (see below), a subscription to the ISA's bimonthly flagship magazine InTech, discounts on ISA's products, events and services, and the privilege of viewing ISA standards, recommended practices, and technical papers at no extra charge. In 2012, ISA introduced a free membership program called an Automation Community Member. Sections and districts Local ISA chapters are known as ISA Sections. A \\"regular\\" section consists of at least 30 members (not including student members). Sections are commonly organized around a specific geographic area, e.g. Seattle Section, Connecticut Valley Section, Greater Oklahoma Section, France Section etc. There are nearly 170 chartered sections in around 30 countries in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Sections are separately incorporated, according to the laws of the state, province or other political subdivision in which they are located. They are not units of ISA, although their bylaws may not conflict with ISA's. As of 2012, there are 146 sections. Many sections sponsor training courses, conduct periodic trade shows, and act as a resource to the local industrial community. Reflecting their primacy in ISA's early days, sections retain pre- eminent governance authority, as ISA's legislative body, the Council of Society Delegates, is composed of section representatives (delegates) who hold voting power equal to the size of their membership. ISA also has nearly 200 student sections, in locations all over the world, principally where the economy has a substantial manufacturing component, and instrumentation and industrial automation are vital academic programs. Some student sections have found it difficult to remain active, as it is necessary to continually replace graduates with newer students, and membership is consequently very fluid. Sections are located within districts, of which there are 14, and which comprise large geographic areas of the world. Each one is headed by a vice president. Districts 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9, and 11 are in the US (although District 7 also includes Mexico and Central America, and District 3 includes Puerto Rico). Districts 10 and 13 are in Canada. District 4 is South America (including the Trinidad Section). District 12 is Europe and the Middle East, and District 14 is the Asia-Pacific sphere. ISA formerly had geographic subdivisions known as \\"regions\\", which were part of the short lived \\"ISA International\\" (1988–1996). At varying intervals following the disestablishment of ISA International, the European Region became District 12, the India Region became District 14, and the South America Region became District 4 . Technical divisions ISA's 17 technical divisions, established for the purpose of increased information exchange within tightly focused segments of the fields of instrumentation, systems, and automation are organized under the Automation & Technology or Industries & Sciences Departments, depending upon the nature of the division. The divisions in the Automation & Technology Department are : * Analysis * Automatic Control Systems * Computer Technology * Management * Process Measurement & Control * Robotics & Expert Systems * Safety * Telemetry & Communications * Test Measurement Industries & Sciences Divisions are: * Aerospace Industries * Chemical & Petroleum Industries * Construction & Design * Food & Pharmaceuticals Industries * Mining & Metals Industries * Power Industry * Pulp & Paper Industries * Water & Wastewater Industries Standards ISA standards play a major role in the work of instrumentation and automation professionals. Many ISA standards have been recognized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Many ISA standards have also been adopted as international standards by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). ISA standards cover a wide range of concepts of importance to instrumentation and automation professionals. ISA has standards committees for symbols and nomenclature used within the industry, safety standards for equipment in non-hazardous and hazardous environments, communications standards to permit interoperable equipment availability from several manufacturers, and additional committees for standards on many more technical issues of importance to the industry. An example of one significant ISA standard is the ANSI/ISA-50.02 Fieldbus Standard for Use in Industrial Control Systems, which is a product of the ISA-50 Signal Compatibility of Electrical Instruments committee. Another significant ISA standard family is the batch processing standards of ANSI/ISA-88.00.01 Models and Terminology, ANSI/ISA-88.00.02 Data Structures and Guidelines for Languages, and ANSI/ISA-88.00.03 General and Site Recipe Models and Representation, which are products of the ISA-88 Batch Control committee. Other standards developed by ISA include: ISA100.11a is for testing and certification of wireless products and systems. This standard was approved by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) as a publicly available specification, or PAS in September 2011. ISA95 is an international standard for developing an automated interface between enterprise and control systems. As of 2012, the Society has over 162 published standards, recommended practices, and technical reports. =Cyber Security Standards for Industrial Control Systems= The International Society of Automation also produces the ISA99 standard which is one of the important Cyber security standards. The Cyber security standards page is within the scope of Wikipedia:WikiProject Computing, the article has been rated as High- importance on the project's importance scale. The ISA99 page has a link to the International Society of Automation page. The cyber security of private industries and governmental installations dependent on the reliable functioning of an Industrial control system is a highly debated subject, that has considerable importance for the security of the critical infrastructure of any country. For example: International Society of Automation cyber security standards are mentioned on the United States Computer Emergency Response Team website . The ISA has formed the ISA Security Compliance Institute to promote and designate cyber-secure products and practices for industrial automation suppliers and operational sites. =Standards committees= ISA standards are developed using a consensus-based model employing volunteer standards committees of automation professionals from across industries. The ANSI standards development model is used with standards committees having the characteristics of Openness, Lack of Dominance, Balance, Consensus and a Right of Appeal. All ISA standards processes are overseen by the ISA Standards & Practices Board. As of 2012, there are more than 3500 participating individuals on ISA standards committees, from over 40 countries, and representing more than 2000 companies and organizations. Conferences, symposia and showsDivision symposia= ISA also holds both industry and technology-specific symposia on a wide variety of topics. Annual ISA Division Symposia include: * Analysis Division Symposium (AD) * Process Industry Conference (PIC) * ISA Energy & Water Automation Conference (EWAC) * Cybersecurity Standards and Implementation Conference (CSIC) * Digital Transformation in Deepwater Production Conference * IIoT & Smart Manufacturing Conference (IIoT) =Local section events= ISA Sections will often host their own local trade shows called Section Expos, member events, and/or sponsored training in their individual geographic areas. PublishingPeriodicals= ISA's technical magazine, the bimonthly InTech magazine is one of the most valuable benefits of ISA membership. InTech provides thought- provoking and authoritative coverage of automation technologies, applications, and strategies which will hopefully enhance automation professionals' on-the- job success. InTech addresses industry challenges, new technologies, and fundamentals in a practical approach written for engineers, managers, and other automation professionals. InTech circulation includes all 31,000 ISA members, as well as several thousand other recipients, who are classified as \\"qualified\\" subscribers. Total circulation is about 60,000 in print and a further 40,000 through the web-based digital edition. This has the desirable effect of substantially increasing the magazine's advertising reach. The quarterly publication ISA Transactions, published by Elsevier, is a referred journal of scholarly material, for which the intended audience is research and development personnel from academy and industry in the field of process instrumentation, systems, and automation. ISA formerly published Industrial Computing, of the now-inactive Industrial Computing Society as well as Motion Control, a magazine devoted to professionals in this discipline. Although the print version was discontinued in 2001, it continued online for a period of time. =Books= ISA publishes and distributes books which offer thorough coverage of the world of automation. ISA books are organized by the technical categories which are generally considered as defining automation: * Basic continuous control * Basic discrete, sequencing and manufacturing control * Advanced control * Reliability, safety, and electrical * Integration and software * Deployment and maintenance * Work structure =Standards= The ISA publishes its standards, recommended practices and technical reports in a variety of formats. These include printed hardcopy, downloadable PDF, web- based viewable, CDROM/DVD and network licenses. A complete list can be found at the society website. Training, certification and educationTraining= ISA Training is a recognized leader in training in the field of industrial automation. ISA training is structured so as to be \\"vendor-neutral\\" and is conducted at the ISA regional training centers located throughout the United States, at major ISA events, at company sites worldwide, or via distance education. The available training paths are (1) Fundamental Skills, for introductory courses, (2) Professional Skills, for training in engineering and project management, and (3) Technical Skills. Dozens of courses are available within the professional and technical paths, including courses designed to prepare candidates for licensure, as well as technical and professional certifications. ISA training products include classroom-based training, mobile training courses, in-plant training, online courses, and printed course materials. The ISA also provides in-house training for a number of large corporations in the oil/gas and chemical industries. =Technical papers archive= The ISA has an online, searchable collection of technical papers which are available to ISA members and to digital library subscribers. As of 2012, the library has over 3000 technical papers. =Certification programs= ISA manages two certification programs, Certified Automation Professional (CAP), and Certified Control Systems Technician (CCST). Each of these is designed to be an objective, third-party assessment and confirmation of an individual's professional abilities and technical skills. Each certification is granted based on a combination of formal education/training, professional experience, and performance on a written examination. The CCST program was established in the early 1990s and because of an obvious industry need, rapidly gained credibility. There are now approximately 4,000 ISA certified technicians worldwide. The CAP program, launched in 2004, is still in the process of becoming established within the industrial community and gaining recognition. As of 2012, there are over 500 certified CAPs worldwide. The ISA used to have a third certification program called Certified Industrial Maintenance Mechanic (CIMM) which was established in 2004. In 2010, the CIMM program was transferred to the Society for Maintenance and Reliability Professionals. The SMRP renamed the CIMM certification to the Certified Maintenance and Reliability Technician (CMRT).

Namba worked as a businesswoman for Federal Express in Japan, but her hobby of mountaineering took her all over the world. She first summitted Kilimanjaro on New Year's Day in 1982, and summitted Aconcagua exactly two years later. She reached the summit of Denali on July 1, 1985, and the summit of Mount Elbrus on August 1, 1992. After summitting the Vinson Massif on December 29, 1993 and the Carstensz Pyramid on November 12, 1994, Namba's final summit to reach was Mount Everest. She signed on with Rob Hall's guiding company, Adventure Consultants, and reached the summit in May 1996, but died during her descent in the 1996 Mount Everest disaster. Personal and professional life Prior to her involvement in the Everest disaster, Yasuko Namba had been employed by Federal Express as a personnel manager in Tokyo, Japan.Baker, Tom and Jonathan Simon, editors. Embracing Risk: The Changing Culture of Insurance and Responsibility. Chicago, Illinois: University of Chicago Press, 2010, p. 185. She was survived by her husband, Kenichi Namba,Yasuko Namba, in \\"Two mountain climbers, an American and a Taiwanese, concluded....\\" United Press International, Inc.: Accessed May 18, 2018. and her brother, both of whom later traveled to Nepal with the hope of retrieving her body from Everest.Krakauer, Into Thin Air, p. 268. Death On May 10, 1996, the 47-year-old Namba reached the summit of Everest, becoming the oldest woman to do so (her record was later broken by Anna Czerwińska of Poland who summitted Everest at age 50). She was still high on the mountain rather late into the afternoon, and was descending when a blizzard struck. Namba, fellow client Beck Weathers, and their guide Mike Groom from Adventure Consultants and clients from Scott Fischer's Mountain Madness were stuck on the South Col, while a whiteout prevented them from knowing where their camp was located. Groom later said that Namba insisted on putting her oxygen mask on despite the fact that she had run out of oxygen. Both Namba and Weathers were so weak that the two guides (Groom and Neal Beidleman from Mountain Madness) had to support them. Although the group tried to head to the camp, the guides soon realized it was pointless and dangerous, and waited for a break in the storm. One of Fischer's guides, Anatoli Boukreev, set out from Camp IV into the night to find the cluster of trapped climbers. After assisting several other people, he came back one last time for Sandy Pittman and Tim Madsen. Madsen, who assumed that Namba was dead and Weathers was a \\"lost cause\\", left the two alone. The following day, Stuart Hutchinson, one of the clients on Adventure Consultants, organized a search party to find both Namba and Weathers. Hutchinson found both in such bad shape that they were unlikely to live long enough to be carried down to Base Camp, and he decided to leave the two alone to save limited resources for the other climbers. While Weathers survived against all expectations, and walked back to camp, Namba died from exhaustion and exposure. Jon Krakauer's book, Into Thin Air, describes the anguish of Neal Beidleman, who felt guilty that he was unable to do anything more to save Namba. Boukreev's book The Climb expressed profound regret at her lonely death, saying that she was just a little 90-pound woman, and that someone should have dragged her back to camp so she could at least die among her companions. On a later expedition to Everest with the Indonesian National Team, Boukreev found Namba's body on April 28, 1997. He constructed a cairn around her to protect her from scavenging birds, and a few days later apologized to her widower for failing to save Namba's life. Later in 1997, her husband funded an operation that brought her body down the mountain. In 2008 materials created by the PBS program \\"Frontline\\" for David Breashears' film Storm Over Everest, John Taske described Namba, and presented his thoughts on factors which may have contributed to her death, saying \\"She was a little lady; I've never met a girl more determined. About 100 pounds in weight, no more, but as far as determination goes, she was twice that weight in determination. However, nature being what it is, hypothermia, body mass – she had a small body mass; she would have gotten desperately cold much more quickly than an average person twice her weight.\\"\\"Yasuko Namba,\\" in \\"Remembering Those Who Died,\\" in \\"Storm Over Everest.\\" PBS: Frontline, retrieved online May 17, 2018. When asked for her thoughts regarding Namba's Seven Summits achievement and subsequent death, Junko Tabei, the first woman from Japan to summit Everest, told a reporter from United Press International, Inc. in mid-May 1996: \\"I jumped for joy when I heard she did it, but I feel like I have lost my sister and I am very sorry.\\"Yasuko Namba, in Two mountain climbers. UPI, Inc. Legacy After the 1996 disaster, two memorial chortens were built nearby Gorak Shep by the Sherpas: one for Rob Hall and the other for Rob Hall's teammates Doug Hansen, Andy Harris, and Yasuko Namba. The two chortens are connected by prayer flags. Film portrayals * Akemi Otani portrayed Namba in the 1997 TV movie Into Thin Air: Death on Everest. *Naoko Mori played Namba in the 2015 movie Everest.

The Battle of Allatoona, also known as the Battle of Allatoona Pass, was fought October 5, 1864, in Bartow County, Georgia, and was the first major engagement of the Franklin-Nashville Campaign of the American Civil War. A Confederate division under Maj. Gen. Samuel G. French attacked a Union garrison under Brig. Gen. John M. Corse, but was unable to dislodge it from its fortified position protecting the railroad through Allatoona Pass. Background Allatoona Pass, circa 1860-65. Photo by Mathew Brady. Allatoona Pass, circa 1862-65. After the fall of Atlanta, Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood moved the Confederate Army of Tennessee northward to threaten the Western and Atlantic Railroad, Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's supply line. Hood's corps under Lt. Gen. Alexander P. Stewart attacked a number of minor garrisons and damaged track from October 2 to October 4. Hood ordered Stewart to send a division to attack the Federal supply base where the railroad ran through a deep gap in the Allatoona Mountain range and then move north to burn the bridge over the Etowah River. At Hood's suggestion, Stewart selected the division of Maj. Gen. Samuel G. French, three brigades commanded by Brig. Gens. Claudius Sears, Francis M. Cockrell, and William Hugh Young.Kennedy, p. 390. The small Federal garrison, commanded by Col. John Eaton Tourtellotte, was a partial brigade (1st Brigade, 3rd Division, XV Corps), consisting of the 93rd Illinois Infantry, 18th Wisconsin Infantry, and Tourtellotte's own 4th Minnesota Infantry. Before the Southern division arrived, Sherman ordered reinforcements be sent from Rome (3rd Brigade, 4th Division, XV Corps) to Allatoona, under the division commander, Brig. Gen. John M. Corse, who took command of both brigades. The Federal troops occupied strong defensive positions in two earthen redoubts on each side of a , deep railroad cut and many of the men, including most of the 7th Illinois, were armed with Henry repeating rifles.Welcher, p. 584; Kennedy, p. 390. Battle French's division arrived near Allatoona Gap during the early morning hours of October 5. The battle began at 7:00 A.M. when eleven Confederate manufactured 12 pounder bronze Napoleon guns began firing upon the Union fortifications. Confederate artillery involved were two batteries of Myrick's Artillery BattalionMajor John D. Myrick manned by men of Capt. Alcide Bouanchaud's Battery of Louisiana,The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies. Washington, D.C., Ser. 1, Vol. XXXIX, Part I, p. 821. Capt. James J. Cowan's Battery of Warren County, Mississippi and a battery from Storr's Artillery Battalion, French's Division, Capt. R. F. Kolb's Battery of Alabama. French had ordered a one gun detachment to force the surrender of the blockhouse a few miles away on Allatoona Creek. Six guns of the 12th Wisconsin Battery answered the Confederate artillery. After a two-hour artillery bombardment, French sent a demand for surrender, which Corse refused. French then launched his brigades in an attack—Sears from the north (against the rear of the fortifications) and Cockrell, supported by Young, from the west. Corse's men survived the sustained two-hour attack against the main fortification, the Star Fort on the western side of the railroad cut, but were pinned down and Tourtellotte sent reinforcements from the eastern fort. Under heavy pressure, it seemed inevitable that the Federals would be forced to surrender, but by noon French received a report from his cavalry that a strong Union force was approaching from Acworth, so he withdrew at 2 p.m.Welcher, p. 584; Kennedy, p. 391; Sword, p. 56. More reinforcements from Rome reached Allatoona the next morning.Official Records, Ser. 1, Vol. XXXIX, Part III, p. 97-98. French's Surrender Demand, Corse's Reply On October 5, 1864, Confederate General S. G. French sent this message across the lines to the Union Army commander, General John Corse: General Corse answered immediately: -From William T. Sherman's memoirs, Volume II Chapter XX Aftermath Allatoona was a relatively small, but bloody battle with high percentages of casualties: 706 Union (including about 200 prisoners) and 897 Confederate. Nonetheless, in his autobiography, General and President U.S. Grant praised the stand made by Corse and his men. Corse was wounded during the battle and on the following day sent a message to Sherman: \\"I am short a cheek bone and one ear, but am able to whip all hell yet.\\" French was unsuccessful in seizing the railroad cut and Federal garrison, regretting in particular that he was unable to seize the one million rations stored there, or to burn them before he retreated.Kennedy, p. 391; Jacobson, p. 38; Sword, pp. 55–56, 59. There is a persistent myth that when Gen. Sherman signaled the garrison to \\"hold the fort\\" and \\"I am coming\\" he was only bluffing and never really sent re-enforcements to aid Gen. Corse in the defense of Allatoona. This myth goes further saying Gen. French relied upon false intelligence that Union re-enforcements were marching toward Allatoona to cut his Confederate force off from Gen. Hood's Army of Tennessee and thus mistakenly abandoned the attack on Allatoona. Even the most cursory review of available historical documents reveals that Gen. Sherman recalled in his memoirs that he ordered the Twenty-Third Corp commanded by Maj. Gen. Jacob D. Cox to the west toward Allatoona with instructions to burn houses and brush piles along the way to make a show of re-enforcements approaching. Sherman added, \\"The rest of the army was directed toward Allatoona...\\" Cox's force was assigned the task of cutting off Gen. French from the Confederate Army of Tennessee and although it arrived too late to assist in the defense of Allatoona or cut Gen. French off from the main Confederate army, Sherman recalled, \\"... still several ambulances and stragglers were picked up by this (Maj. Gen. J. D. Cox's) command on that road.\\"Sherman, William T. 1990. Memoirs of General W. T. Sherman: Vol. 2, p. 622.Sherman's Memoirs, Vol. 2, pgs 624, 625. However, a closer look at the orders actually issued that day reveals that by 2 p.m., the time French was beginning his withdrawal and therefore too late to influence events, Sherman had only ordered Cox and the Twenty-Third Corps to take position to the north and east of Kennesaw Mountain. They had spent the day marching north from Atlanta. Sherman even supplied a staff officer to guide him into position to protect the right flank of the Fourteenth Corps. By 3 p.m a signal officer reported that Cox had only just then passed through Marietta.Official Records, Ser. 1, Vol. XXXIX, Part III, p. 99-100. Only on October 6, the day after the battle, did Sherman order Cox to “Have a brigade ready to go there to-morrow early.”Official Records, Ser. 1, Vol. XXXIX, Part III, p. 136. The brigade did not leave Big Shanty until dawn on the 7th, and did not arrive at Allatoona until approximately 11 a.m., two days after the battle.Official Records, Ser. 1, Vol. XXXIX, Part III, p. 133. Indeed, Sherman's memory was faulty. He did order Cox to reconnoiter the Dallas- Acworth Road on the 7th, but the purpose of lighting the fires along the way was so that Sherman, atop Kennesaw Mountain, could track his progress.Official Records, Ser. 1, Vol. XXXIX, Part III, p. 136-137. The closest Sherman came to ordering reinforcement to the pass on the 5th were several un-timed dispatches sent to his cavalry. Sherman ordered Brigadier General Kenner Garrard's cavalry division to Allatoona, but clearly after the battle had ended. The order was later modified, reducing the force to a single squadron after it became clear that the garrison had held.Official Records, Ser. 1, Vol. XXXIX, Part III, p. 92. Gen. Sherman's message to Allatoona via signal flag to \\"hold the fort\\" inspired the later popular religious hymn entitled Hold the Fort by Chicago evangelist Philip P. Bliss, which featured the chorus, \\"'Hold the fort, for I am coming'\\"Smith, pp. 282-84 See also *Sherman quotations NotesReferences * Evans, Clement A., ed.

During World War II, he was a soldier in the Batalion Zośka of the Polish Home Army, and was awarded multiple times with a Cross of Valour. He took part in Operation Kutschera (intelligence) and the Warsaw Uprising, where he was heavily wounded. Later, he became a developer of one of the first machine learning algorithms, techniques for character and image recognition. After receiving a UNESCO award in 1960, he travelled for several years around the academic centres in the United States, including MIT, Harvard, Caltech, and many others. In 1971, he designed one of the first minicomputers, the K-202. Because of the policy on computer development in the People's Republic of Poland, belonging to the Comecon that time, the K-202 was never mass- produced. Karpiński later became a pig farmer, and in 1981, after receiving a passport, emigrated to Switzerland. He also founded the Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence of the Polish Academy of Sciences in the early 1960s. Family and childhood Jacek Karpiński was born on 9 April 1927 in Turin, Italy into a family of Polish intellectuals and alpinists. His father, Adam 'Akar' Karpiński, was a prominent aeronautic engineer (who co-constructed the SL-1 Akar, the first glider constructed entirely by the Poles) and inventor, credited with projects of innovative climbing equipment (crampons, 'Akar- Ramada' tent). His mother, Wanda Czarnocka-Karpińska, was a respected physician who went on to become Dean of the University of Physical Education in Warsaw. Both were pioneers of winter mountaineering in the Tatra Mountains (first successful winter attacks on Banówka, Nowy Wierch, Lodowy Szczyt and others).Lipiński 2014, p. 48 Adam Karpiński was also a member of a Polish expedition into the Andes, which was the first to climb the peak Mercedario (6720 m.). Karpiński himself was due to be born in the Vallot winter hutLipiński 2014, p. 18 near Mont Blanc, but due to the extreme weather conditions, his parents had to retreat to Turin, where their first child was born. Karpiński had one younger brother, Marek, who also became an electrical engineer. The family moved from Biała Podlaska to Warsaw in 1934, where Wanda took a job at Physical University of Warsaw and Adam worked in PZL (Polish Aviation Works). Karpiński's father died in September 1939 during an expedition to Nanda Devi in the Himalayas. After an unsuccessful attack on the summit, along with Stefan Bernadzikiewicz, he decided to climb the nearby Tirsuli (7039m), where both were killed by an avalanche. Wartime Karpiński's life was changed not only by his father's death but by the outbreak of World War II. Despite his young age (fourteen at the time), by pretending to be seventeen, he managed to join the Gray Ranks, a Polish underground paramilitary boy scouts organization, where he served in Grupy Szturmowe (Assault Groups). In early 1943, he was severely injured while working on homemade bombs for an underground sabotage operation when one of them accidentally exploded in the basement of his house. He lost sight in both eyes and faced the serious threat of hand-amputation.Lipiński 2014, p. 81 After his mother's intervention and the help of her fellow physicians, his eyes recovered fully and the hand was saved, but he never regained total control over it. After the recovery, Karpiński resumed his activities in the Home Army. With the help of his mother, Wanda, and brother, Marek, who both also actively participated in the resistance effort, the family established a secret resistance outpost in their family home on Obserwatorów Street. The place was an outpost for Juliusz \\"Laudański\\" Deczkowski's unit and contained a clandestine shooting range. It was also a hideout for Stanisław Miedza- Tomaszewski, a Home Army officer working for its Informational Department. Karpiński participated in numerous field operations, including Sieczychy Operation (Akcja pod Sieczychami), as a soldier, and Operation Kutschera, as a part of recon under Wiesław \\"Sem\\" Krajewski. After the formation of the Home Army's Zośka battalion, Karpiński enrolled, where he befriended poet Krzysztof Kamil Baczyński, both being commanders of smaller sub-units.Lipiński 2014, p.87 Karpiński also participated in the Warsaw Uprising. On the first day of fighting, he was trapped weaponless with around 30 other soldiers in a hospital building on Koszykowa street after the weaponry supply had been mistakenly directed somewhere else. While evacuating the unit, Karpiński's group was caught under heavy fire, which resulted in most of the evacuees dead. Karpiński himself was shot with a 9mm caliber gun a bullet was stuck in his backbone but he survived. Found next day by the hospital's nurses, he received treatment but remained paralyzed. Released from hospital after the Uprising's collapse, he rejoined his family in Pruszków but remained unable to stand or walk. The family moved through Cracow and Zakopane to a small village of Murzasichle in the Tatras, where they remained through the rest of the war. During the course of the war, Karpiński was awarded the Cross of Valour three times. Post-war After World War II, Karpiński's family moved to Radomsko, and he started to attend local high school. He was forced to learn how to walk again, which he did during hiking trips in the mountains with his brother and Józef Lityński. He completed the entire high school curriculum in one year and passed the baccalaureate with flying colours. Afterwards, Karpiński moved to Łódź to begin university education at the Faculty of Electro-Mechanical Sciences within the local polytechnic. After two years, he moved to Warsaw University of Technology from which he graduated in 1951. . Karpiński, just as many other former Zośka battalion veterans, influenced by former Home Army high officer Jan \\"Radosław\\" Mazurkiewicz's call, revealed himself to the Communists, but unlike many, he was spared imprisonment. Nevertheless, he was forced to change workplace several times, eventually receiving a work warrant for T-12 factory of electrical components in Żerań. During the time Karpiński was planning to flee Poland, he even worked on designing a mini-submarine in which he would be able cross the Baltic Sea and reach the Danish island of Bornholm.Lipiński 2014, p. 132 However, after the first sights of the Polish thaw, he decided to stay. In 1955 he was offered a job at the Polish Academy of Sciences' Institute of Basic Problems, which he accepted. There he worked under Leszek Filipkowski on the design of the prototype ultrasonography device. AAH His first independent project was the AAH — Analytical Analyzer of Harmonics. Karpiński was asked by a long-time friend, Józef Lityński, an employee of the State Institute of Hydrology and Meteorology, whom he had known from his time in Radomsko, to build a device to help calculate Fourier integrals. The Institute hoped the device could help improve the effectiveness of long-term weather forecasts. Karpiński gathered a team of five people and constructed a computer based on vacuum tubes in 1957. The machine had been used for two years when it was accidentally destroyed. Karpiński himself claimed AAH raised the precision of forecasts by 10%,Lipiński 2014, p. 133 an estimate which has not been contested. A part of the engineering team was Karpiński's brother Marek, who worked with him successfully until his tragic death in 1957 during a climbing expedition in the Tatras. AKAT-1 The breakthrough achievement of Karpiński's career was the construction of AKAT-1 in 1959 in co-operation with engineer Janusz Tomaszewski. AKAT-1 was a pioneering work the world's first differential equations analyzer based on transistors. Karpiński built the device during his spell at the Polish Academy of Science's Institute of Automatics, where he found employment after the success of AAH. The aim of AKAT-1 was to simulate various complex dynamic processes like heat transfer or a shock absorber's mechanics. The innovativeness of the device was acknowledged by historians of computer science e.g. Maciej Sysło claims it has to be conceded that Karpiński's effort preceded any other similar device.Lipiński 2014, p. 136 The construction was also lauded for its aesthetical merits the panel designed by leading Polish artists Emil Cieślar, Olgierd Rutkowski, Stanisław Siemek and Andrzej Wróblewski had been considered to 'innovatively merge all functions in a congruent and attractive form that anticipated the future trends'.Lipiński 2014, p. 136 The machine has been domestically welcomed warmly, having been covered by a host of country-wide media, including national television TVP1 and Polish Film Chronicle.Lipiński 2014, p.137 Currently, the machine can be seen in the Museum of Technology in Warsaw. UNESCO scholarship in the United States The success of AKAT-1 enabled Karpiński to be put forward by Poland as its candidate for UNESCO worldwide award for young engineers in 1960. Karpiński's work was evaluated with around 200 other contestants by an UNESCO international committee, and he turned out to be among the six laureates. As a reward, he was allowed to go on a half-year scholarship in the United States to visit major technological centres in the country. During the scholarship, which has been eventually extended to a full year, Karpiński managed to visit around twenty universities and laboratories, among them Computation Laboratory at Harvard, Caltech, UCLA and Los Alamos National Laboratory. During his stay he met with a number of leading computer scientists of the time including John Eckert, Claude Shannon and Edward F. Moore. Despite the numerous offers to stay in the United States and move his work there, Karpiński decided to come back to Poland. Later, it emerged that before and during his stay in the United States, Karpiński cooperatated with Polish intelligence to collect data, which sparked controversies around his person. Karpiński himself, interviewed on the matter after the fall of communism, was reluctant to comment the matter, but insisted the agreement with intelligence officer cpt. Zygmunt Goć was limited to reporting on the state of technical progress of American facilities.Lipiński 2014, p. 151 Perceptron Shortly after his return from the US, Karpiński, inspired by his American experience, decided to implement some of his newest ideas at home. He convinced the director of the Institute of Automatics Stefan Węgrzyn to build a perceptron a device built according to Frank Rosenblatt's ideas, able to learn how to discern and recognize objects and shapes. The idea was successfully realized, and the Polish perceptron was completed in 1964, being one of the first of such in the world and the first known in the Communist bloc.Lipiński 2014, p. 149 KAR-65 Soon after the completion of the perceptron, Karpiński fell out with Węgrzyn, which forced him to leave the Institute of Automatics. He moved to the Polish Academy of Sciences' Institute of Physics led by Jerzy Pniewski. Pniewski's team worked on the analysis of data from CERN pictures from Glaser bubble chambers, traces of colliding electrons and neutrons. The Institute struggled with the amount of data and was looking for a mechanism to speed up the processing of data. In 1965, on Pniewski's request Karpiński firstly designed a scanner, then after its success began work on the mathematical machine that could compute the scanned data. With the help of newly formed team of seven people including later long-time cooperators Tadeusz Kupniewski and Teresa Pajkowska, Karpiński finished the machine in 1968, dubbed KAR-65, after three years of work. Due to financial constraints, KAR-65 was built using Polish germane transistors TG-40 and DOG-61 diodes, considerably slower than their western counterparts. KAR-65 was asynchronic and used a dedicated operation system, designed by Karpiński. The computer could perform 100 thousand operations per second, which made it the fastest Polish computer at the time. The computer consisted of two parts, both measuring 1,7m x 1,4m x 0,4m, but was still considerably smaller that the leading Polish computers of the time, Odra mainframes. The computer's interface was designed by the artist Stanisław Tomaszewski, who had also worked on the AKAT-1. The total cost of construction was estimated to be 6 million złotys. Only one machine was built and it continued to work in the Institute of Physics for 20 years. It currently resides in the Museum of Technology in Warsaw. Even though the computer was a technological success, most likely due to the pressure of competing computer manufacturers (chiefly Elwro, producer of Odra mainframes), many reports on KAR-65s were halted by the censorship. Karpiński had his 1969 paper from Polish Informatical Conference in Zakopane blocked from printing. His article on KAR-65 in Maszyny Matematyczne from the same year was blocked, as well. A similar fate befell the articles on the subject by popular journalists Stefan Bratkowski and Aleksander Bocheński. Before his interview with the TV programme Tele-Echo Karpiński received an official ban on talking about the computer. He complained about the matter to the President of the Committee of Science and Technology Jacek Kaczmarek (28.04.1970), but received no backing.Lipiński 2014, p. 177 K-202 In 1970, Karpiński decided to establish his own institution to work on his new idea, a minicomputer of original architecture, for which he sought backing from state officials. Karpiński was given permission to found Microcomputers' Construction Plant (Zakład Budowy Mikrokomputerów) in Warszawa-Włochy in 1970. The basis for the computer's construction was the fruit of the joint-venture agreement between the Polish state (represented by Metronex, a foreign trade office) and British private partners companies Data-Loop and MB Metals. Karpiński, who orchestrated the agreement, was appointed technical director, fully responsible for the engineering aspect of the venture. The parts and finances were to be supplied by the British, but the entire construction and production process was to be done in Poland, something that Karpiński strongly insisted on. MB Metals and Data-Loop were given rights to sell the computer in all countries, except Poland. The companies were also solely responsible for the products promotion and distribution.B. Kluska, 2013, p. 71 Karpiński collected a team of 113 employees, including programmers and hardware engineers such as Zbigniew Szwaj, Teresa Pajkowska, Andrzej Ziemkiewicz and Elżbieta Jezierska. The main objective of the project was to build a computer, which would be small, affordable (around 6.5 thousand dollars apiece), easy to produce and failproof.Lipiński 2014, p. 102 Great emphasis was also put on its modularity Karpiński was determined to build an entire system, with flexible complexity and arrangement in line with user's needs. Production of 1300 units was planned in two initial series. The primary objective was commercial, but Karpiński intended for K-202 to be used in a vast variety of applications in industry, administration, science and military (land and navy). The team worked for three years and in 1973 first prototypes were completed. The result was a minicomputer highly innovative in many aspects. K-202 was constructed entirely with microchips, using breakthrough 1971 Intel 4004 chips. It was also asynchronic and used floating point representation, as KAR-65. Moreover, K-202 used memory segmentation with paging, the first minicomputer to do so. Additionally, it performed close to a million operations per second. These two things made K-202 faster than its potentially most dangerous competitors DEC's PDP-11 and CTL's Modular One. The computer was small, could fit on the desk and weighed 35 kilograms. It was also highly shock-, water- and temperature- resistant. K-202 used authorial operation system SOK and dedicated ASSK programming language, but also supported ALGOL 60, FORTRAN IV, BASIC and others. The important feature was also a possibility of accessing up to 64 devices in the same time, hence the high level of freedom of architectural composition of a system. Despite the technical excellence of the computer, it never reached mass production. Only 30 machines were ever produced and the conditions of work in Karpiński's team remained laboratorious rather than industrial. The reasons of this outcome remain unclear and are still a matter of historical debate. Karpiński himself pointed at the intentional efforts of some high-level officials, mostly Jerzy Huk, director at , a local computer engineering giant and monopolist, manufacturer of Odra mainframes. Another possible enemy of Karpiński was col. Ryszard Kulesza, director of the Institute of Mathematical Machines within the Polish Academy of Sciences. Others, among them Stefan Bratkowski and Maciej Sysło, point out the general distrust toward foreign companies and unwillingness to take risks within the ruling class, especially if the project involved consumption of high amount of foreign currency, crucial to the failing communist economy.Lipiński 2014, p. 162 Another possible explanation for the lack of political will for Karpiński's case is the rise of new, all-Comecon project of building a new family of computers within the communist bloc dubbed Riad. The project gained absolute priority, especially after its director Lavryonov's visit in Warsaw in autumn of 1972. Stefan Bratkowski point out that K-202 had the chance to succeed only as a part subjugated to the entire system, which Karpiński declined outright, considering the Riad project to be much inferior to K-202.Lipiński 2014, p. 161 A lack of proper industrial and institutional background, as well as Karpiński's personal traits stubbornness, individualism and lack of social skills are also mentioned as possible reasons. Karpiński found himself unable to find sufficient political backing, despite moderate support from the influential Franciszek Szlachcic and Józef Tejchma. He also rejected signing up for the communist party, which could have raised his chances significantly, according to the then Minister of Culture Józef Tejchma. Critics started to expose the high costs of the project (K-202 cost was $6500 per unit for foreign clients), and the lack of commercial success, accusing Karpiński of mismanagement, fraud and embezzlement. As a result, he lost his position within a project, which was swiftly rebranded as after very minor alterations (around 1% of functional content) and was not developed further, effectively ending the K-202's chances of commercial success. Most of the 30 prototypes worked extensively for several years in 43 different institutions throughout Poland. For example, in 1972, a K-202 machine was used to computerize the calculations of results of the European wrestling championships. Currently, only a few remain; one can be seen in the Museum of Technology in Warsaw. The only working copy is in private hands. Later life Disappointed with the outcome of K-202 production, Karpiński in 1978 decided to move to the countryside near Olsztyn (village Dąbrówka Wielka) and started a small animal husbandry ranch. In 1981, on the invitation of Stefan Kudelski, Karpiński moved to Switzerland to work on Nagra tape recorders. In 1990, after a series of unsuccessful business ventures, Karpiński decided to return to Poland. In the 1990s he served as an advisor on computer science to Andrzej Olechowski and Leszek Balcerowicz. He also tried to kickstart his own business ventures hand-held text-scanner 'Pen-Reader' invented during his stay in Switzerland and cash registers 'Libella', which both failed. In 2009, he was awarded the Officer's Cross of Polonia Restituta for remarkable achievements in computer engineering. Jacek Karpiński died on 21 February 2010 in Wrocław, where he had lived since 1996. In 2010, he was posthumously awarded an even more prestigious Commander's Cross of Polonia Restituta, third-highest level of this order. Controversies It has been revealed that Jacek Karpiński worked as a secret informant for the Służba Bezpieczeństwa since 1961. He received considerable financial rewards for his work, including foreign holidays with his wife sponsored by the state.Lipiński 2014, p. 153 Karpiński's work was mostly dedicated to collecting technological data. This was also stated by him to be the condition under which he is inclined to provide information. Karpiński was a valuable asset, having travelled extensively since the 1950s and possessing a wide range of international contacts. He provided the intelligence with a lot of useful information beginning with the international Expo in Leipzig in 1961.Lipiński 2014, p. 151; Kochajkiewicz 2012 But the peak of his activity was reached during his trip to the United States, during which he amassed and passed an extensive amount of information on both the technological centres, but also personalities of American science and industry. Historian Adam Kochajkiewicz claims his cooperation was heavily influenced by naivete on the situation in the scientific world and on the goals and methods of the intelligence.Lipiński 2014, p. 152; Kochajkiewicz 2012 The intensity of Karpiński's cooperation decreased significantly in the 1970s, when Karpiński became not a cooperator, but a target for the intelligence. Karpiński had his passport withdrawn, informants were planted in his closest environment to gather information on him, his phone calls and private correspondence was also monitored.Lipiński 2014, pp. 155, 163 Also, the scale of Karpiński's engineering achievement is hotly debated. It is claimed that his construction, most notably K-202, were innovative enough (or even superior) to successfully compete with the worldwide competition (most notably PDP-11 and Modular One) and as such K-202's failure marks one of the biggest opportunity of People's Republic of Poland's for fast modernization Adrian Markowski compared Karpiński to Bill Gates.Lipiński 2014, p. 1 It is also stated that Karpiński's defeat was primarily caused by administrative incompetence and intentional sabotage by his enemies. Critics point out the exaggerations in Karpiński's evaluation of his workLipiński 2014, p. 183 and claim that the project's fate within state structures was, at least partly, justified.http://bajtyzbroda.gadzetomania.pl/873,legenda-o-jacku-karpinskim- recenzja-ksiazki-geniusz-i-swinie They, among them Maciej Sysło, underline the massive scale of funds and organization needed for the success of a new device and point out the uncertainty about the machine's real capabilities.Lipiński 2014, p. 162 References in culture Jacek Karpiński is portrayed in Roman Bratny's novel Lot ku ziemi as Marek Zych. = Books = * P.

Retrieved January 20, 2015 Mighty Joe Young tells the story of a young woman, Jill Young, living on her father's ranch in Africa, who has raised the title character, a large gorilla, from an infant and years later brings him to Hollywood seeking her fortune in order to save the family homestead. Plot In 1937 Tanganyika territory, Africa, eight-year-old Jill Young is living with her father on his ranch. While in her yard, two Africans come by with an orphaned baby gorilla; Jill so wants a pet that she trades her toys and money for him, vowing to always care for the gorilla. Twelve years later, Max O'Hara and sidekick Gregg are on a trip to Africa looking for animals to headline in O'Hara's new Hollywood nightclub. The two men have captured several lions and are about to leave when gorilla Joe Young appears, now tall and weighing . When a caged lion bites Joe's fingers, he goes on a rampage. Visualizing Joe as their big nightclub attraction, Max and Gregg try to rope him, but he throws both men from their horses and breaks free of their ropes. A grown Jill Young arrives, calming Joe down. She is furious with both men and storms off with Joe. Both later meet with Jill, and Gregg becomes hopelessly smitten with her. Having now calmed down, Jill hears out Max's nightclub proposal, as Gregg also tries to dissuade her. Max tells her that she and Joe will be a huge Hollywood hit and will be rich within weeks. Needing the proffered income, she agrees to take Joe to Hollywood. On the crowded opening night, on stage Joe lifts a large platform above his head, holding Jill playing Beautiful Dreamer on a grand piano. Following that, Joe has a tug of war with \\"the 10 strongest men in the world\\", which he easily wins. Famous Italian heavyweight boxer Primo Carnera tries to box with him, but Joe playfully tosses him into the audience; laughter follows. Joe's popularity grows, and by the 10th week he is Hollywood's biggest nightclub attraction. Joe and Jill, however, are beginning to miss Africa; Jill tells Max and Gregg that she is having second thoughts. Gregg tries to convince Max to let them go, but thinking only about more profit, he is able to talk her into staying. By the 17th week, Joe is miserable; he has grown tired of performing and is homesick. To make matters worse, his next act is a humiliating performance playing an organ grinder with Jill, acting as a little girl, turning the handle. When a thrown bottle strikes Joe, his rage surfaces, roaring at the crowd, while Jill shouts for the audience to stop. Later, during dinner, Gregg and Jill express their feelings for one another, with Gregg agreeing to return with her to Africa. In his cage, an unhappy Joe tries to ignore three drunks who have sneaked backstage; they offer Joe an open whiskey bottle, and he becomes intoxicated after two more open bottles are consumed. Taunting him, the drunks burn Joe's fingers with a cigarette lighter. Roaring with pain and rage, he breaks out, smashing through a nearby wall and wrecking the nightclub's interior. He also smashes the glass of the lion habitat, allowing the lions to escape into the crowded nightclub, where Joe beats down several of them. Jill and Gregg return and find the nightclub in chaos. Jill manages to get Joe back to his cage, while arriving police shoot the remaining lions. A court decree orders Joe be shot, and Jill's pleas to save his life are denied. Gregg, O'Hara, and Jill devise a plan to get Joe out of California using a moving van, then a cargo ship. When Joe's executioners arrive, they find his cage empty and themselves locked inside the nightclub. As the van is leaving, Joe is spotted by an itinerant worker, who is later questioned by police. On the way to the ship, police spot the moving van and give chase, but Joe has been cleverly transferred to a covered truck; the moving van, driven by Max, is just a decoy. The police eventually stop the van and arrest Max. Driven by Gregg and carrying Joe and Jill, the truck gets stuck in heavy mud. With Jill's encouragement, Joe pushes the truck free, and the police then get stuck in the same mud as the truck drives away. Before reaching port, they witness a tall orphanage engulfed in flames. Jill and Gregg help the caretakers save the children. They escort most of the children, but the flames spread quickly, and a last group, along with Jill and Gregg, are trapped on the top story. At Jill's urging, Joe braves the raging fire by climbing an adjacent tall tree, carrying Jill to safety, while Gregg lowers each child by rope to the ground. One child is left behind, so Joe climbs up again, grabbing the little girl, then he and Gregg climb down. A wall of the burning orphanage collapses as they near the ground, nearly killing Joe and the little girl. Max assures Jill that, because of Joe's heroism, his life will now be spared. Much later, Max receives home movies from his friends. Jill and Gregg, now married and living on their ranch with Joe, who has made it safely back to Africa.

Ray Harryhausen was hired in 1947 on his first film assignment as an assistant animator to O'Brien. O'Brien, however, ended up concentrating on solving the various technical problems of the production, delegating most of the actual animation to Harryhausen; Pete Peterson and Marcel Delgado also animated a few sequences in the film.Cady, Brian. \\"Articles: Mighty Joe Young.\\" Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved January 20, 2015 The models (constructed by Kong's builder Marcel Delgado) and animation are more sophisticated than in King Kong, containing more subtle gestures and even some comedic elements, such as a chase scene where Joe is riding in the back of a speeding truck and spits at his pursuers. Despite this increased technical sophistication, this film, like King Kong, features some serious scale issues, with Joe noticeably changing size between many shots (the title character is not supposed to be as large as Kong, perhaps 10–12 feet tall). Harryhausen attributed these lapses to producer Cooper, who insisted Joe appear larger in some scenes for dramatic effect.Harryhausen 1974, p. 22 Buoyed by the enormous success of King Kong in 1933 and its profitable theatrical reissues in 1938, 1942, and 1946, RKO had great hopes for Mighty Joe Young. Upon its release in 1949, the film was honored with an Academy Award for Special Effects (a category that did not exist in 1933 for King Kong). The film was unsuccessful at the box office and recorded a loss of $675,000.Richard B. Jewell, Slow Fade to Black: The Decline of RKO Radio Pictures, Uni of California, 2016 As a result, plans to produce a sequel (tentatively titled Joe Meets Tarzan) were quickly dropped. The film has become a stop-motion animation classic. Special effects artists consider it highly influential, with the elaborate orphanage rescue sequence lauded as one of the great stop-motion sequences in film history. It was remade in 1998 with Charlize Theron playing Jill, Bill Paxton as Greg, and creature suit performer John Alexander as the title character. Joe was created through a mixture of gorilla suits and full-sized animatronics created by Rick Baker and digital effects by DreamQuest Images and Industrial Light & Magic.

The NYSBA was born out of the necessity to build a bridge over the Hudson River to link the city of Hudson and the village of Catskill. It owns, operates, and maintains five Hudson River bridge crossings in the Mid-Hudson River Valley of New York State. It also owns and maintains the Walkway over the Hudson, but that structure is operated by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. Organization NYSBA is guided by an unpaid 7-member board of directors (two seats of which are currently vacant) who are appointed by the New York State Governor. NYSBA's management team is headed by Acting Executive Director Tara Sullivan. In 2017, NYSBA had operating expenses of $51.08 million, an outstanding debt of $89.72 million, and a staffing level of 282 people. NYSBA has been self-sufficient throughout its more than eighty-five year history, operating without Federal or State tax monies and reinvesting toll revenues to continue to maintain and improve these vital Hudson River Crossings. History The origin of the NYSBA was embodied in the Great Depression during the 1930s and 1940s. State finances were in short supply and an originally proposed plan for the state to build the Rip Van Winkle Bridge was vetoed by then Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt. A possible precursor to the New Deal, Roosevelt supported the creation of an Authority, separate from state finances. On March 31, 1932, Roosevelt signed into law a bill sponsored by Greene County Assemblyman Ellis Bentley that created the Bridge Authority as an entity that would issue toll revenue bonds to pay for what would become the Rip Van Winkle Bridge. In 1933, during the construction of the Rip Van Winkle Bridge, the Authority acquired the Mid-Hudson Bridge, originally built by the State Department of Public Works in 1930. Of note, the toll for a round trip across the Mid-Hudson Bridge for a car with 3 passengers in 1933 was $2.20, more than the $1.75 charged today. The 1933 $1 toll for a one horse wagon is no longer charged. The Rip Van Winkle Bridge was dedicated in 1935. The Bear Mountain Bridge, originally built by a private venture in 1924, was sold to the Authority in 1940. The Authority dedicated the Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge in 1957, the first span of the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge in 1963 and the second span in 1980. The Bridge Authority charges an auto cash toll of $1.75 for eastbound traffic on all five bridges. E-ZPass customers pay $1.35. The last rate increase was May 01, 2020, a 25 cent increase from the prior rate of $1.50.http://www.nysba.state.ny.us/Index%20Page/NYSWeb_tolls_NoLogo.htm Commercial tolls are based on axle count. NYSBA is a member of the E-ZPass electronic toll collection system. In 2020 Governor Andrew Cuomo proposed to merge NYSBA with the New York State Thruway Authority but withdrew the plan after opposition from the Hudson Valley delegation to the state legislature, who feared it would be detrimental to the bridges and lead to higher tolls They believed Cuomo's real goal was to use NYSBA's budget surpluses to offset the Thruway Authority's deficits and subsidize its construction projects. The year's state budget did give Cuomo the authority to replace the Bridge Authority's entire board even if they had not finished their terms, and he did. Legislators accused Cuomo of trying to install a board that would be more amenable to the governor's merger plans; state senator Sue Serino of Hyde Park voted against confirming all of the replacements, and some of her colleagues from the region opposed some. One, Jen Metzger of Rosendale, said the Hudson Valley legislators would be watching the new appointees closely to make sure they were \\"independent thinkers\\". =Statutory authority= The law creating the New York State Bridge Authority is found in the Bridge Authority Act, currently Sections 525 to 542 of the New York Public Authorities Law and defines the Bridge Authority's mission as “to maintain and operate the safe vehicle crossings over the Hudson River entrusted to its jurisdiction for the economic and social benefit of the people of the State of New York.” The crossings listed in the statute are: the Rip Van Winkle Bridge between Hudson and Catskill; the Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge; the Mid-Hudson Bridge between Poughkeepsie and Highland; the parallel Newburgh-Beacon spans; and the Bear Mountain Bridge. The Authority believes its mandate imposes a responsibility to provide reliable, safe and convenient access across the river to all lawful traffic and to achieve that goal within the framework of a sound long-term financial policy. The elements of that policy are: An unqualified commitment to meet all obligations to the bondholders in the full letter and spirit of the Authority's General Revenue Bond Resolution and the covenants made therein; A vigorous, integrated program of inspection, maintenance, repair and rehabilitation to insure the structural integrity of its facilities and the safety of its patrons; Control of expenditures to the extent consistent with prudent stewardship and responsible administration; and The lowest possible toll rates which at the same time enable the Authority to meet its obligations and responsibilities as well as provide for adequate financial reserves. Police A New York State Bridge Authority Police patch. The New York State Bridge Authority has 1 sworn police officer who is assigned to the Bridge Authority's Command Center in Highland as well as numerous facilities under control of the Bridge Authority.

History  In 1999, Couples for Christ (CFC) built the first GK house for the Adduru family from Bagong Silang, a barangay in which the organization had previously held poverty programs. The name \\"Gawad Kalinga\\", which translates in the Filipino language either as \\"to give care\\" or \\"to award care,\\" was coined in 2000. The first GK Expo was launched on October 4, 2003, in Fort Bonifacio, Taguig City. During this gathering, GK launched a campaign called the GK777 campaign to build 700,000 homes in 7,000 communities for 7 years. = Isang Milyong Bayani = On February 25, 2006, GK launched the Isang Milyong Bayani (\\"One Million Heroes\\", also known as GK1MB) program, where volunteers from various nations would donate 4 hours of work per month to assist in GK communities. The program includes an annual event called the GK1MB Bayani Challenge, a one-week national immersion/build activity, where volunteers within the program come together to build homes in a GK community for a week. The Bayani Challenge has been held in Aurora Province and Quezon Province (2006); Albay, Camarines Sur, Sorsogon, Marinduque, and Samar (2007); Bukidnon and Lanao del Sur (2008); and Sulu and Zamboanga City (2009). = Separation from CFC = GK began as a ministry of CFC, but as it grew into a national and now worldwide presence, disagreement within the organization grew regarding its alleged secularization. On February 20, 2007, Antonio Meloto and Francisco Padilla resigned from their posts in GK. Two months later, on Easter Day, Padilla released a statement alleging that Gawad Kalinga was responsible for alleged failures of CFC in its mission of evangelization. In this statement, he enumerated 18 points to support his conclusion, including involvement with Mormons, acceptance of donations from pharmaceutical companies that produce contraceptives, gradual secularization and erosion of CFC's presence, and excessive acknowledgment of Meloto as \\"founder and father\\" of GK. However, what started as a conflict over GK led to division within CFC itself. The following months saw GK being criticized by Padilla and other CFC leaders (known as the \\"Easter Group\\" in homage of Padilla's article) for its failures, until some bishops from the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines proposed that GK be separated from CFC. CFC stood by GK, and the Easter Group decided to convince some CFC leaders and members to separate from CFC, leading to the formation of the Couples for Christ Foundation for Family and Life (CFC FFL). A resolution between CFC and GK was finally reached in 2009, when CFC Executive Director Joe Tale announced the major decision of the CFC International Council \\"to let go of the governance and corporate structure of GK\\" so the latter can focus on its expanding work within and outside the country as a non-religious organization. As a result of the departure of the CFC International Council from the GK Board, Archbishop Oscar Cruz of the Lingayen-Dagupan archdiocese instructed the clergy and lay people in his area to withdraw from GK activities, because through this development, GK has disconnected itself with the Catholic Church and opened itself up to ties with organizations whose policies contradict Church teachings. This call was similarly made by Father Gammy Tulabing, a priest writing for The Negros Chronicle. In response, Jose Tale appealed to Archbishop Cruz to reconsider the latter's instruction, particularly because of CFC's continued support of the now-autonomous GK and because of the remaining overlap in membership between the two organizations despite the change in leadership. Meanwhile, Meloto supported Tale's explanation; that there was no CFC-GK split as \\"no one has the right to remove Gawad Kalinga from CFC whose members have made heroic sacrifices to create this noble work that has transformed lives and deepened faith.\\"  Development Model  Gawad Kalinga's plan, called GK 777, is split into three \\"phases,\\" each 7 years in length towards a goal to ultimately \\"un-squat” the poorest of the poor, heal their woundedness, regain their trust, build their confidence, make them think and act as a community and to share the joy of a country rising from poverty. The first phase's stated goal was to achieve Social Justice by raising 700,000 homes and start–up 7,000 communities by the end of 2010. The current phase extends from 2011 to 2018, and focuses on what the organization calls Social Artistry: strengthening governance; developing community-based programs for health, education, environment, and productivity; building a village culture that honors Filipino values and heritage. The goal is to empower the powerless for self-governance, self-reliance, and self-sufficiency. One of these Social Artistry sites is called The GK Enchanted Farm, a community meant to encourage the growth of social entrepreneurship. The final phase spans from 2018 to 2024, and is envisioned as a time of Social Progress. This phase seeks to achieve scale and sustainability by developing the grassroots economy and expanding the reach and influence of GK to 5 million families with support from key sectors of society in the Philippines and partners abroad. GK seeks to relieve poverty by providing an environment in which Filipinos may work and be productive. After developing a model road map in the Philippines, GK seeks to create successful development templates that can be replicated in other developing countries in order to reduce poverty internationally.  Development Programs  Maynilad (Bahay Toro Water Reclamation-Wet Well Station, Bahay Toro, Project 8, Pugad Lawin, Districts 1, Quezon City) Community Infrastructure: The GK Community Infrastructure Program (CIP) builds homes and facilities (such as clinics and school buildings) for impoverished people using labour paid for by charity and the future residents of the houses themselves. Child and Youth Development: The GK CYD program aims to develop the skills and talents of the children and youth in the GK communities by inculcating values that bring out their full potential. SIBOL, which means “to grow,” provides value-based education to pre-school children, aged 3 to 6 years old. SAGIP, which means “to save a life”, is a support program for children aged 7 to 13 years old, which consists of free academic tutorials, sports and creative workshops and values formation classes. SIGA, which means “to light”, empowers teens to become productive citizens through sports, creative activities and mentoring sessions. Community Building: The GK Community Building program provides GK villages with mentors who try to instill a sense of community within the villagers. Environment: The GK Environment program aims to create \\"green\\" model communities. The program operates under a tagline of \\"Save the poor, save the environment\\", and partners with environment advocacy groups and government agencies to provide seminars and environment-friendly programs for community members. Bayan- Anihan: The GK Food Sufficiency program (or Bayan-Anihan, lit. \\"community harvest\\") is a program which aims to provide sustainable farming for its beneficiaries. In this program, families are provided a 10 sq. meter garden, and basic agricultural education by Agricultural State Universities. GK Kalusugan: Kalusugan (\\"Health\\" in Tagalog) is a community health program with the goal of improving health among impoverished people by educating them about first aid and nutrition, as well as connecting hospitals and medical professionals to needy communities. Center for Social Innovation: CSI (Center for Social Innovation) tries to encourage entrepreneurship and connect would- be entrepreneurs with experts and volunteers from fields necessary to build successful enterprises.  Awards and recognitions  2006 Ramon Magsaysay Award = On August 31, 2006, Gawad Kalinga and Antonio Meloto, GK Chairman, both received the 2006 Ramon Magsaysay Award for Community Leadership in relation to their work in poverty relief in the Philippines. Francisco Padilla, former CFC Executive Director and GK Chairman, received the award for GK.  Paraiso: Tatlong Kwento ng Pag-asa  In 2006, GK began collaborating with some Filipino actors to produce a film about the program. The production, which translates to English as \\"Paradise: Three Stories of Hope\\", is a compilation of three films, each with a different cast. \\"Paraiso\\" is produced by Butch Jimenez, Tony Gloria, Tony Tuviera, and executive produced by Bobby Barreiro. Umiyak Man Ang Langit (Even If Heaven Cries, directed by Jun Lana) is based on the life experiences of Jocelyn Llorente (played by Maricel Soriano). Llorente, along with her husband and six children, were victims of the mudslides in St. Bernard, Southern Leyte on February 2006, in which one of her children died. The movie follows her and her family through their recovery from this incident. Ang Kapatid Kong Si Elvis (My Brother Elvis, directed by Joel Ruiz) is a story based on events in Southern Leyte. The story centers on a boy named Michael (played by Paulken Bustillo) who suffers from rectal prolapse and compulsively eats stones. On April 7, 2002, Dr. Jerome Paler (played by Michael V.), a GK worker in the CFC Medical Mission Foundation, visited the area where Michael lived. Upon learning of the boy's condition, Paler brought Michael to the hospital for treatment. He convinces his wife (played by Carmi Martin) and son, Pepe (Gian Bernabe), to adopt Michael as their own, where they raise and treat him. Marie (directed by Ricky Davao) tells the story of Ruby Abad, (played by Cesar Montano), after the death of his wife, Marie Rose Abad (played by Lexi Schultz) in the September 11, 2001 attacks. Disraught, Rudy sets out to fulfill Marie's vow of helping impoverished street children in the Philippines on her behalf. Abad, a graduate of the Ateneo de Manila University, meets his former classmate Mike Goco, a GK volunteer, and Abad begins to realize that Marie Rose's dream can be fulfilled by dedicating an entire GK site for her. This site is now the Marie Rose GK Village in Baseco, Tondo, Manila. The movie premiered on June 12, 2007, at the SM Mall of Asia, and was made available for local showing on July 4 of the same year.

NV), also called the Neo-Vulgate, the New Latin Vulgate or the New Vulgate, is the official Classical Latin translation of the original-language texts of the Bible from modern critical editions published by the Holy See for use in the contemporary Roman rite. It was completed in 1979, and was promulgated the same year by John Paul II in Scripturarum thesaurus. A second, revised, edition was promulgated in 1986, again by John Paul II. It is the official Latin text of the Catholic Church. Before the Nova Vulgata, the Clementine Vulgate was the standard Bible of the Catholic Church. The Nova Vulgata is not a critical edition of the historical Vulgate. Rather, it is a revision of the text intended to accord with modern critical Hebrew and Greek texts, and to produce a style closer to Classical Latin. HistoryElaboration of the text= In 1907, Pope Pius X commissioned the Benedictine Order to produce as pure a version as possible of Jerome's original text after conducting an extensive search for as-yet-unstudied manuscripts, particularly in Spain. Pope Pius XI established the Pontifical Abbey of St Jerome-in-the-City in 1933 to complete the work. By the 1970s, the Benedictine edition was no longer required for official purposes because of liturgical changes that had spurred the Vatican to produce a new translation of the Latin Bible, the Nova Vulgata. In consequence, the abbey was suppressed in 1984. Five monks were nonetheless allowed to complete the final two volumes of the Old Testament, which were published under the abbey's name in 1987 and 1995. The Oxford editors had already published a full critical text of the Vulgate New Testament, and no attempt was made to duplicate their work. The Second Vatican Council in Sacrosanctum Concilium mandated a revision of the Latin Psalter, to bring it in line with modern textual and linguistic studies while preserving or refining its Christian Latin style. In 1965, Pope Paul VI appointed a commission to revise the rest of the Vulgate following the same principles. The Commission published its work in eight annotated sections, and invited criticism from Catholic scholars as the sections were published. The Latin Psalter was published in 1969, the New Testament was completed by 1971, and the entire Nova Vulgata was published as a single-volume edition for the first time in 1979. The foundational text of most of the Old Testament is the critical edition commissioned by Pope Pius X and produced by the monks of the Benedictine Abbey of St. Jerome. The foundational text of the Books of Tobit and Judith is from manuscripts of the Vetus Latina, rather than the Vulgate. The New Testament was based on the 1969 edition of the Stuttgart Vulgate, and hence on the Oxford Vulgate. All of these base texts were revised to accord with the modern critical editions in Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic. A number of changes were also made where modern scholars felt that Jerome had failed to grasp the meaning of the original languages, or had rendered it obscurely. The Nova Vulgata does not contain some books that were included in the earlier editions but omitted by the canon promulgated by the Council of Trent. Those omitted books are the Prayer of Manasses, the 3rd and 4th Book of Esdras (sometimes known by different names: see naming conventions of Esdras), Psalm 151, and the Epistle to the Laodiceans. =Promulgation= In 1979, after decades of preparation, the Nova Vulgata was published, and was made the official Latin version of the Bible of the Catholic Church in the apostolic constitution Scripturarum thesaurus, promulgated by Pope John Paul II on April 25, 1979. A second edition, published in 1986, added a Preface to the reader, an Introduction to the principles used in producing the Nova Vulgata, and an appendix containing three historical documents from the Council of Trent and the Clementine Vulgate. This second edition included the footnotes to the Latin text found in the eight annotated sections published before 1979. It also replaced the few occurrences of the form Iahveh, used when translating the Tetragrammaton, with Dominus, in keeping with an ancient tradition. =Liturgiam authenticam= In 2001, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments released the instruction Liturgiam Authenticam. This text established the Nova Vulgata as \\"the point of reference as regards the delineation of the canonical text\\". Concerning the translation of liturgical texts, the instruction states: This recommendation is qualified, however: the instruction specifies (n. 24) that translations should not be made from the Nova Vulgata, but rather \\"must be made directly from the original texts, namely the Latin, as regards the texts of ecclesiastical composition, or the Hebrew, Aramaic, or Greek, as the case may be, as regards the texts of Sacred Scripture\\". The instruction does not recommend translation of the Bible, or of the liturgy, based solely upon the Latin Nova Vulgata; the NV must instead simply be used as an \\"auxiliary tool\\".  Textual characteristics  Most of the approximately 2,000 changes made by the Nova Vulgata to the Stuttgart Vulgate text of Jerome's version of the Gospels are minor and stylistic in nature. In addition, in the New Testament the Nova Vulgata introduced corrections to align the Latin with the Greek text in order to represent Jerome's text, as well as its Greek base, accurately. This alignment had not been achieved earlier, either in the edition of 1590, or in the 1592 edition. Use of the Nova Vulgata William Griffin used the Nova Vulgata for his Latin-to-English translation of the Books of Tobit, Judith, 1 and 2 Maccabees, Baruch, Wisdom, Sirach, and the additions to Esther and to Daniel for the Catholic/Ecumenical Edition of The Message Bible. The Nova Vulgata provides the Latin text of Kurt and Barbara Aland's bilingual Novum Testamentum Graece et Latine; the latter was first released in 1984. Since the Alands' 1984 revision of the Novum Testamentum Latine, that version has also used the Nova Vulgata as its reference text. Critiques The Nova Vulgata has been criticized as deviating frequently from the Vulgate manuscript tradition; the NV New Testament was criticized for being a Latin translation of the Nestle-Aland rather than a collation of Vulgate manuscripts. According to Protestant university professor Benno Zuiddan, many of the NVs New Testament readings are not found in any Latin manuscripts, meaning that the NV diverges from Jerome's translation. Zuiddan has called the NV \\"an imaginary text of Scripture on the authority of scholarship, based on a handful of manuscripts that run contrary to the textual traditions of both the Eastern and the Western Church\\". Traditional Catholics object to the Nova Vulgata because, in their view, it lacks Latin manuscript support and breaks with the historical tradition of worship in the Church.

She is a member of the Teen Titans and of the Doom Patrol. First appearing in Teen Titans #45 (December 1976), Karen adopted the Bumblebee identity three issues later. Historically, Bumblebee is sometimes considered DC Comics' first black woman superhero character, though this distinction is also accorded to Nubia,https://blackamericaweb.com/2017/06/09/little-known-black-history-fact- nubia-the-black-wonder-woman/ Wonder Woman's twin sister (and a less traditional costumed crimefighter than Bumblebee) who debuted in 1973. Publication history Karen Beecher first appeared in Teen Titans #45 and was created by writer Bob Rozakis and artist Irv Novick. Her Bumblebee alias first appeared in Teen Titans #48. Character biographyTeen Titans= Scientist Karen Beecher is the girlfriend of Teen Titans member the Herald (a.k.a. Mal Duncan). In order to help make Herald look good in front of the team, Karen secretly made herself a bumblebee-themed supersuit and attacked the Teen Titans. She escaped without her true identity being revealed. When she later explained to Mal and the Titans what she had done, they were impressed enough to offer her membership, which she accepted. She and Mal subsequently moved to the new Titans West team, having relocated to San Francisco. When the Titans team dissolved for a time, Karen and Mal married and 'retired' from superheroics. Karen took a job with S.T.A.R. Labs, where she designs non-lethal weaponry. They have returned to crime-fighting from time to time to assist the team, most notably during a short-lived revival of Titans West and the JLA/Titans event, which reunited everyone involved with the team. A fight broke out over the fate of Victor Stone, Cyborg. Bumblebee personally fought Zauriel, a member of the Justice League. Despite the assistance of the current Supergirl, Bumblebee was swiftly defeated. Following this, Mal and Karen briefly joined the latest incarnation of Titans West (now called Titans L.A.), but this incarnation of the team never really got off the ground, and the heroes returned to their lives of semi-retirement. Several years later, Mal and Karen briefly returned to action as part of a team of over two dozen past and present Titans who were called in to stop a rampaging Doctor Light. =Infinite Crisis and One Year Later= Bumblebee and her husband are among the heroes recruited by Donna Troy to help avert a coming crisis that threatened the existence of the universe. After a battle in space, most of the heroes were trapped by a Zeta Beam Ray that Adam Strange was hoping to use for teleporting away the heroes from the rift in space. Due to the ray interactions with the rift itself, the Zeta Ray altered Bumblebee's physiology, apparently transferring her body mass to Hawkgirl. This left Bumblebee approximately six inches in height and temporarily left Hawkgirl some 25 feet tall. Matthew Clark. In Teen Titans vol. 3, #34, Bumblebee is shown to have joined the Doom Patrol sometime in the past year along with her husband (now known as Vox) and Beast Boy. She must now take medicine developed by Doom Patrol leader Niles Caulder to prevent her heart from going into cardiac arrest, due to her tiny form. Much like Beast Boy, she now strongly resembles her animated counterpart in costume and hair style. Per Birds of Prey #100, Karen—along with numerous other DCU heroines—was contacted by Barbara Gordon and asked to join the expanded roster of the latter's team, the Birds of Prey. However, the team disbanded before she participated in any missions. Karen is a member of the Doom Patrol. Due to medicinal efforts from Dr. Caulder, she has grown to a height of seven inches, and she can live in a dollhouse. As of Doom Patrol (vol. 5) #1, Karen is now a divorcée. In issue #18, Karen rejoined the team after months of inactivity due to her divorce from Malcolm. Now sporting a new costume and a Beehive hairdo, Karen returned to active duty just in time for a confrontation with the Secret Six, who had come to the team's home of Oolong Island in order to claim it in the name of a teenaged crime lord.Secret Six (vol. 3) #30 In the ensuing battle, Bumblebee inexplicably vanishes after a brief tussle with Bane, while her teammates ultimately fight the Six to a draw. As the members of the Secret Six are being forcibly deported from Oolong, Elasti-Girl stops Rag Doll and forces him to empty out his pockets, where Karen is found tied up with her mouth duct-taped shut. Ragdoll reluctantly returns Bumblebee to her teammates, telling them that he had wanted to keep her as a \\"souvenir\\".Doom Patrol (vol. 5) #19 Following the disbandment of the Doom Patrol, Bumblebee appears as one of the former Titans who arrives at Titans Tower to repel Superboy-Prime and the Legion of Doom.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #99 =DC Rebirth= In the DC Rebirth continuity, Karen is the pregnant wife of Mal Duncan.Titans Hunt (vol. 1) #2 She later reveals that she has the power to fire energy blasts from her hands, which comes in handy during the former Teen Titans' battle with Mister Twister. At the end of the fight, she goes into labor and eventually gives birth to a daughter.Titans Hunt #7-8 Eventually, Karen is taken by Mal to Meta Solutions to evaluate her powers, as it was the same company that took his powers away. Unlike her husband, Karen likes her super powers and wants to find a way to control them. Unbeknownst to them, Meta Solutions is run by Psimon and the Fearsome Five, which Mal realizes after spotting Mammoth in the lobby. Though the Fearsome Five claims to have changed, the Titans investigate their headquarters and come under attack. Karen suits up using a special suit designed for her by Meta Solutions and discovers she has the ability to fly and shrink. She manages to rescue the Titans, but Psimon manages to take away her memories of Mal and her child.Titans Vol 3. #8-10 She decides to stay with the Titans as Bumblebee until she got her memories back much to Mal's displeasure. She eventually regains them when the Titans battle H.I.V.E. and Donna Troy's evil alternate future counterpart, Troia. She quits being a super hero after the Justice League disbands the Titans to be with her family.Titans Vol 3. #12-19 Powers and abilities Bumblebee originally had no true superpowers and her unique abilities were derived from her scientific superpowered high-tech battle suit. The suit greatly increased her strength, speed, stamina, endurance, agility, reflexes and acted as body armor. It also allowed her to fly, create painful electric blasts that stung like actual bee stings and emit a stream of \\"honey,\\" actually a powerful adhesive capable of disabling her opponents by miring them in the sticky, yellow goo. She later got stuck at a shrunken size and now possesses superpowers. She can fly and produce exceptionally strong hypersonic blasts. Other versions * A toddler version of Bumblebee appears as one of the protagonists of the all-ages Tiny Titans series. Here, she is portrayed as the girlfriend of Plasmus, who is depicted as being more of a gentle giant than an outright villain. * Bumblebee appears as part of Cyborg's Titans East roster in the Titans Tomorrow storyline. Unlike her canon incarnation, this version of Bumblebee still retained her supersuit and normal height. In other mediaTelevision= Teen Titans animated series, similar to her appearance in One Year Later * Bumblebee (voiced by T'Keyah Crystal Keymáh) appears in the Teen Titans animated series as an assertive, highly skilled, and cocky former H.I.V.E. student who was really an undercover agent, enrolling to infiltrate the facility and learn their motives and secrets for Aqualad, having kept track of H.I.V.E. long before Cyborg posed as Stone. Bumblebee was able to resist Brother Blood's mind control powers eventually the first time; \\"There's not a man alive who can tell me what to do!\\" she explained to Cyborg. Her abilities as a H.I.V.E. student caused her to be trusted by Brother Blood, but Blood was shocked to find that she was also a spy when she assisted Cyborg in stopping Brother Blood's latest plan. Unlike her comic incarnation, Bumblebee does not wear a mask or goggles. She also uses two separately carried, B-shaped electric stingers as weapons, and her flight and shrinking abilities appear to be a natural feature, not bestowed by a supersuit. While reduced in size, the stingers lose potency, inflicting only painful shocks, but her strength remains unchanged. Blood escaped to Steel City where he was followed by Bumblebee and Aqualad. While in Steel City, Bumblebee and Aqualad formed Titans East with Speedy and Más y Menos. Cyborg soon followed and helped the team build their tower, but Blood entered with his new Cyborg copies and beat the Titans East whom he then placed under mind-control to attack and capture Cyborg, whom Blood wanted to examine. Cyborg then battled Blood and won, freeing the Titans East. He then decided to return to his fellow Titans and appointed Bumblebee as the new leader of Titans East. Also, along with her fellow Titans East members, she watched over Titans Tower in Jump City, defeating Andre Le Blanc without trouble. While fighting Control Freak, she was forced to stop a subway car while remaining in her small stature. Bumblebee was overpowered by Punk Rocket and Angel in \\"Calling All Titans\\". She somehow got rescued by Starfire and joined the Titans' assault on the Brotherhood of Evil's lair. Bumblebee has made a few appearances in the Teen Titans Go! comic book series (#20, 25, & 29). She also appears in issue #39 and, similar to the mainstream comics, falls in love with Herald - though this is conditioned by an overzealous Larry's actions in playing Cupid for the Titans. * Bumblebee has made a few non-speaking cameos in Teen Titans Go!, appearing in a flashback in the episode \\"Starliar\\" at the Titans East dance party, on a balloon in \\"Two Bumblebees and a Wasp\\", and with the rest of the Titans East in a restaurant during \\"Yearbook Madness\\" where Robin asks her to sign his yearbook. In the episode, \\"Forest Pirates\\", she became a sixth titan and is voiced by Ozioma Akagha. * Karen Beecher appears in the Young Justice episode \\"Targets\\", voiced by Masasa Moyo. She appears as a normal high school student. She is the head of the cheerleading team named \\"The Bumblebees\\" in reference to her comic book incarnation's superhero persona. In episode 18, \\"Secrets\\", there is a Halloween party featuring many costumed cameos, one of which is Karen dressed up as Bumblebee. She also seems to be in a relationship with Mal Duncan. In \\"Happy New Year\\", Karen has officially become Bumblebee and joined the team at some point within the five-year gap between seasons one and two. She is now the protégé and lab assistant of Ray Palmer, the Atom. In the third season, she has since left the team and starts out as being pregnant in \\"Home Fires\\". Karen and her husband Mal later visit Conner and M'gann for Thanksgiving in \\"Illusion of Control\\". She eventually gives birth to a baby girl named Rhea who is born with a heart defect in \\"Unknown Factors\\". To fix this, Karen patches a hole in her daughter's heart and activates her metagene. * Bumblebee is a main character in the 2019 incarnation of the DC Super Hero Girls TV series, voiced by Kimberly Brooks. She is depicted as being very shy and nervous in this version, but also as being able to rise to the occasion.

Against Method. 4th ed., New York, NY: Verso Books, 2010, p. 1. In the context of this work, the term anarchy refers to epistemological anarchy.  Content  Feyerabend divides his argument into an abstract critique followed by a number of historical case studies.Feyerabend, Against Method, 4th ed., p. 7. The abstract critique is a reductio ad absurdum of methodological monism (the belief that only a single methodology can produce scientific progress).Lloyd, Elisabeth. \\"Feyerabend, Mill, and Pluralism\\", Philosophy of Science 64, p. S397. Feyerabend goes on to identify four features of methodological monism: the principle of falsification,Feyerabend, Against Method, 4th ed., p. 45. a demand for increased empirical content,Feyerabend, Against Method, 4th ed., p. 27. the forbidding of ad hoc hypothesesFeyerabend, Against Method, 4th ed., p. 8. and the consistency condition.Feyerabend, Against Method, 4th ed., p. 17. He then demonstrates that these features imply that science could not progress, hence an absurdity for proponents of the scientific method. The historical case studies also act as a reductio.Lloyd, \\"Feyerabend, Mill, and Pluralism\\", p. S397. Feyerabend takes the premise that Galileo's advancing of a heliocentric cosmology was an example of scientific progress. He then demonstrates that Galileo did not adhere to the conditions of methodological monism. Feyerabend also argues that, if Galileo had adhered to the conditions of methodological monism, then he could not have advanced a heliocentric cosmology. This implies that scientific progress would have been impaired by methodological monism. Again, an absurdity for proponents of the scientific method.Feyerabend, Against Method, 4th ed., p. 116. Feyerabend summarises his reductios with the phrase \\"anything goes\\". This is his sarcastic imitation of \\"the terrified reaction of a rationalist who takes a closer look at history\\".Feyerabend, Against Method, 3rd ed., p. vii  Scholarly reception  Some have seen the publication of Against Method as leading to Feyerabend's isolation from the community of philosophers of science, who objected to his view that there is no such thing as the scientific method.Preston, John, Feyerabend: Philosophy, Science and Society, p. 7  Editions and translations  The first edition of Against Method went through several reprintings until the revised (second) edition came out in 1988. A further revision produced a third edition in 1993. The most recent edition, the fourth, was published by Verso Books, in 2010, with a new introduction by Ian Hacking. A French translation by Baudouin Jurdant and Agnes Schlumberger was published by Éditions du Seuil in 1979, as Contre la méthode : esquisse d'une théorie anarchiste de la connaissance. The German translation by Hermann Vetter was abridged and reworked by Feyerabend, whose native language was German. It was published by Suhrkamp Verlag in 1983 as Wider den Methodenzwang. Skizzen einer anarchistischen Erkenntnistheorie. This translation went into a paperback edition in 1986, as part of the suhrkamp taschenbuch wissenschaft series, and has been reprinted several times. A Dutch translation by Hein Kray was published by Boom in 1977, with the title In strijd met de methode. In 2008 a new translation by Marjolijn Stoltenkamp was published, as Tegen de methode.

Victory there allowed the Confederates to temporarily strengthen their hold on the region and impair Union supply lines. Battle On August 26, 1862, Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg's army left Chattanooga, Tennessee and marched north through Sparta, TN and then to Glasgow, KY. Pursued by Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell's Union Army, Bragg approached Munfordville, a station on the Louisville & Nashville Railroad and the location of an 1,800 foot long railroad bridge crossing Green River, in mid-September. Col. John T. Wilder commanded the Union garrison at Munfordville, which consisted of three regiments behind extensive fortifications. Wilder's force was first approached by Brig. Gen. James R. Chalmers who marched on Munfordville from Cave City, KY without orders. Chalmers had received an erroneous report from cavalry under Kirby Smith that the federal force in Munfordville had \\"not more than 1,800 men, entirely raw troops, and that they were fortifying their position, but that the railroad and telegraph had been destroyed in their rear, cutting them off completely from all communication and re-enforcements.\\" Upon arriving on September 14, Chalmers demanded a surrender, which was rejected, and then proceeded to launch frontal assaults that were repulsed by the federal defenders. Chalmers' brigade suffered 288 casualties in the attacks before retreating back to Cave City. Braxton Bragg was angry at Chalmers for his \\"unauthorized and injudicious\\" assault, but determined to force Munfordville's surrender nonetheless. Bragg believed that leaving Munfordville intact would \\"throw a gloom upon the whole army…[but forcing its surrender would] turn defeat into victory.\\" Thus Bragg's army made a forced march of 25–35 miles the night of September 15–16 to Munfordville. Late on September 16, realizing that Buell's forces were near and not wishing to kill or injure innocent civilians, the Confederates sent another demand for surrender. Wilder entered enemy lines under a flag of truce, and Confederate Maj. Gen. Simon B. Buckner escorted him to view the Confederate strength to convince him resistance was futile. Realizing the odds he faced (45 cannon and 25,000+ infantry), Wilder agreed to surrender. The formal ceremony took place the next day as the paroled federals marched out of Munfordville with new uniforms. W.L. Trask, a Confederate soldier, said the federals \\"were well clothed, looked fat and sleek and clean and neat and were in strange contrast to our own hungry, ragged and dirty looking rebels.\\" Despite the capture of over 4,000 federals and stores of supplies at Munfordville, the victory did little for the Confederates other than slow them down. Author Kenneth W. Noe said \\"Unless he [Bragg] intended to fight it out along the Green River, an idea that flickered only briefly under duress, Munfordville was a three-day distraction the Confederate cause could ill afford.\\" The incident is a good example of how Bragg had little overall vision for the campaign and instead simply reacted from event to event.

Biography Ast was born in Gotha. Educated there and at the University of Jena, he became a privatdozent at Jena in 1802. In 1805 he became professor of classical literature in the University of Landshut, where he remained until 1826, when it was transferred to Munich. He lived there until his death in 1841. In recognition of his work, the Bavarian Academy of Sciences made him a member and aulic councillor. He is known principally for his work during the last twenty-five years of his life on the dialogues of Plato. His Plato's Leben and Schriften (1816)—which originated in the Introductions of Friedrich Schleiermacher and the historical scepticism of Niebuhr and Wolf—was the first of those critical inquiries into the life and works of Plato. Distrusting tradition, he took a few of the finest dialogues as his standard, and from internal evidence denounced as spurious not only those generally admitted to be so (Epinomis, Minos, Theages, Rivales, Clitophon, Hipparchus, Eryxias, Letters and Definitions), but also the Meno, Euthydemus, Charmides, Lysis, Laches, First and Second Alcibiades, Hippias Major and Minor, Ion, Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, and even (against Aristotle's explicit assertion) The Laws. The genuine dialogues he divides into three series: # the earliest, marked chiefly by the poetical and dramatic element, i.e. Protagoras, Phaedrus, Gorgias, Phaedo; # the second, marked by dialectic subtlety, i.e. Theaetetus, Sophist, Statesman, Parmenides, Cratylus; and # the third group, combining both qualities harmoniously, i.e., the Philebus, Symposium, Republic, Timaeus, Critias. The work was followed by a complete edition of Plato's works (2 vols., 1819–1832) with a Latin translation and commentary. His last work was the Lexicon Platonicum (3 vols., 1834–1839), which is both valuable and comprehensive. In his works on aesthetics he combined the views of Schelling with those of Winckelmann, Lessing, Kant, Herder, Schiller and others. His histories of philosophy are marked more by critical scholarship than by originality of thought, though they are interesting as asserting the now familiar principle that the history of philosophy is not the history of opinions, but of reason as a whole; he was among the first to attempt to formulate a principle of the development of thought. Beside his works on Plato, he wrote, on aesthetics, System der Kunstlehre (1805) and Grundriß der Aesthetik (1807); on the history of philosophy, Grundlinien der Philosophie (1807, republished 1809, but soon forgotten), Grundriß einer Geschichte der Philosophie (1807 and 1825), and Hauptmomente der Geschichte der Philosophie (1829); in philology, Grundlinien der Philologie (1808), and Grundlinien der Grammatik, Hermeneutik und Kritik (1808). He died in Munich.

It does for a verb what the more widely known pronoun does for a noun. It, along with pronouns and some other word classes, form the general group of word classes pro-forms. It is a type of anaphora. This term is always hyphenated, to distinguish it from the unrelated term proverb. In English English does not have dedicated pro-verbs; however, a bare infinitive can generally be implied rather than expressed, such that the verbs that take bare infinitives (including most of the auxiliary verbs) can be said to double as pro-verbs. Additionally, have and be can double as pro-verbs for perfect, progressive, and passive constructions (by eliding the participle). Finally, the dummy auxiliary verb do can be used when there is no other auxiliary verb, except if the main verb is be. The following are some examples of these kinds of pro- verb: *Who can tell? --No-one can . *Why can't he do it? --He can , he just won't . *I like pie, as does he . *Why did you break the jar? --He made me . *Can you go to the park? No, I cannot [go to the park]. Note that, when there are multiple auxiliary verbs, some of these may be elided as well. For example, in reply to \\"Who's been leaving the milk out of the refrigerator?\\", any of \\"You've been doing it\\", \\"You have been\\", or \\"You have\\" would have the same meaning. Since a to-infinitive is just the particle to plus a bare infinitive, and a bare infinitive can be elided, the particle to doubles as a pro-verb for a to-infinitive: *Clean your room! --I don't want to . *He refused to clean his room when I told him to . Finally, even in dialects where bare infinitives and participles can be elided, there does exist the pro-verb do so: \\"He asked me to leave, so I did so\\". This pro-verb, unlike the above- described pro-verbs, can be used in any grammatical context; however, in contexts where another pro-verb could be used, it can be overly formal. For example, in \\"I want to get an 'A', but to do so, I need to get a perfect score on the next test,\\" there is no other pro-verb that could be used; whereas in \\"I want to get an 'A', but I can't do so,\\" the do so could simply be elided, and doing so would make the sentence sound less formal.

Court House, also known as Courthouse, is a transit-oriented neighborhood in Arlington County, Virginia. It is centered around the Court House stop on the Orange Line and the Silver Line of the Washington Metro. Although Arlington is so geographically small that it does not have component towns or cities, the Courthouse neighborhood is sometimes referred to as county seat, as it is home to the primary county government administrative complex as well as a justice center consisting of a jail, courthouse and police HQ. Indeed, the neighborhood gets its name from the governmental uses that call it home. The neighborhood consists of high-rise residential and business buildings including offices of PAE and an 8-screen AMC movie theater. It is home to more than 25 bars and restaurants, ranging from informal lunch take-out spots, to a venue for local bands, to upscale Latin and Thai evening establishments. Courthouse also features one of the first garden-style apartments complexes built in the United States. Built in the 1930s, Colonial Village consists of private condos, co-op housing, and apartments for rent and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Fort Woodbury once stood near the site of the current Arlington County Courthouse (14th St. N. at N. Courthouse Rd.), atop one of the highest hills in Arlington. It was part of the \\"Arlington Line\\" of fortifications built after the Union seized the area in May 1861, at the beginning of the Civil War. The fort was named for Major D.P. Woodbury, the engineer who designed and constructed the Arlington Line. Woodbury Heights, a high-rise condominium that sits on the Fort Woodbury site, was constructed in the 1980s and is named in honor of the fort. As with many neighborhoods in central Arlington, the exact boundaries of the Courthouse neighborhood are unclear. Arlington County's Court House Sector Plan includes the area bounded by Wilson Boulevard, Cleveland Street, Fairfax Drive, Arlington Boulevard and Courthouse Road. The Clarendon-Courthouse Civic Association has similar boundaries. However, an argument can be made to extend the Courthouse neighborhood to lie between the midpoint of the locations of the Court House and Clarendon Metro stations and the midpoint of the Court House and Rosslyn Stations -- which would be Danville and Rhodes Streets, respectively.

Life He was the son of the 2nd Baronet (created 1821) Sir Francis Dugdale Astley and wife Emma Dorothea Lethbridge, and a descendant of Lord Astley. From 1848 to 1859, he was in the Scots Fusilier Guards, serving in the Crimean War and retiring as a Lieutenant-Colonel. On 22 May 1858, he married an heiress, Eleanor Blanche Mary Corbett, of Elsham Hall, North Lincolnshire. Eleanor (died 7 June 1897) was the daughter of Thomas George Corbett (died 5 July 1868) and wife (married 15 December 1837) Lady Mary Noel Beauclerk (28 December 1810 – 29 November 1850), daughter of the 8th Duke of St Albans. He thereafter devoted himself to sports including horse racing, boxing and pedestrianism. He was a popular figure at horse race meetings, known familiarly as \\"the Mate\\", and for winning and losing large sums of money. Two famous jockeys that rode regularly for him were George Fordham and Charlie Wood. He succeeded to the baronetcy in 1873.

Created by Marv Wolfman and Chuck Patton, she first appeared in Tales of the Teen Titans #56 (August 1985). This character bears no relation to the male character of the same name who first appeared in Adventure Comics #488 as an adversary of Chris King and Vicki Grant. Publication history She joined the supervillain group, the Fearsome Five, a frequent enemy of the Teen Titans, Superman, and the Outsiders. She has also been a member of Villainy Inc. To date, her real name has not been revealed. Fictional character biography Jinx is an Indian elemental sorceress whose powers include the ability to command elements such as air, the manipulation of magical energy that she can manifest as offensive force bolts and green flame, the ability to dissolve matter, and creation of ground tremors. Jinx is bald and slender because of her cancer. She traditionally wears only a white two- piece loincloth bikini with golden jewelry, and she is always barefoot due to the fact that she must be in contact with the ground to use her nature element abilities. She first encountered the Fearsome Five when that group attacked Tri-State prison where she was incarcerated at the request of Indian authorities. The Five are defeated by the Teen Titans, but Jinx and Neutron decided to join the Fearsome Five. Jinx remained with the group even after Neutron subsequently left it, but after their next appearance in Adventures of Superman #430 (July 1987), in which they fought Superman alongside new members Deuce and Charger, the group disbanded, and Jinx was incarcerated in the metahuman prison on Alcatraz, along with her teammates Mammoth and Gizmo. Jinx was part of Circe's army of female supervillains that was defeated by Wonder Woman and Earth's other superheroines.Wonder Woman #174-175, Vol. 2. DC Comics. Shortly thereafter, Jinx was recruited by Queen Clea into the re- formed all-female crime organization Villainy Inc. Together with Cyborgirl, Doctor Poison, Giganta, and Trinity, Jinx assists Clea in conquering the other-dimensional land of Skartaris. The plan, however, is commandeered by Trinity. The team has not appeared since.Wonder Woman #179-183, Vol. 2. DC Comics. Later, in a storyline in Outsiders #12–15 (July–October 2004), frequent Captain Marvel archenemy Dr. Sivana freed Jinx, Mammoth and Gizmo from Alcatraz. Having summoned teammate Psimon and having brought her teammate Shimmer back to life after she had been turned into glass and shattered, Sivana put the team to work for him in a scheme to short sell Lexcorp stock by having them steal its accounts from its corporate building in Metropolis, and then driving down the stock by killing all the people in the building. Sivana also had them destroy two other Lexcorp properties. At the latter of the two, a microchip processor factory of Lexcorp's subsidiary, Kellacor, the Five were confronted by the Outsiders. After escaping, the criminally unsophisticated Five urged Sivana to take Lexcorp's nuclear missile facility near Joshua Tree, California. When Sivana refused, Psimon asserted that they would take it anyway, and in response, Sivana killed Gizmo with a laser blast to the head, and severed relations with the remaining four, warning them that he would kill them if they ever crossed his path again. The Five decided to enact their plan to take the facility and fire a nuclear missile at Canada, but were defeated by the Outsiders. Mammoth was returned to Alcatraz Island, but Jinx and the other members of the Five remain at large. She was later seen among the new Injustice League, and is one of the villains featured in Salvation Run. She is one of the villains sent to retrieve the Get Out of Hell free card from the Secret Six. In The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Jinx first appeared as part of the Fearsome Five. The group appears as part of the Secret Society who are allied with The Crime Syndicate.Justice League Vol. 2 #29. DC Comics. She is sent with the other members of the Fearsome Five, Mammoth, Gizmo, Shimmer and Psimon, along with Dr Psycho and Hector Hammond to fight against Cyborg and the Metal Men. She ends up defeated by Lead. In DC's 2016 relaunch of its titles, DC Rebirth, Jinx appears as part of the Fearsome Five.Abnett, Dan (w), Booth, Brett (p), Rapmund, Norm (i). \\"Made in Manhattan Part Two: Buzz Kill\\", Titans (Vol 2) #9 (May 2017). DC Comics. Powers and abilities Jinx is a formidable elemental sorceress who draws her magic from the solid, natural ground. This is why she must have contact between the ground and her bare feet at all times, or else her magical effects become weakened or lost altogether. Her elemental abilities include, but are not limited to: generating powerful force blasts, conjuring wind bursts, summoning emerald flames, creating earth tremors, creating illusions, and even dissolving solid matter. Jinx also has precognitive abilities that allow her to sense dangerous events moments before they occur. Jinx has an ability to converse with the Earth itself, in order to gently manipulate even greater magic stored there. She may have other mystical abilities as well, although none are certain. Other versions The animated version of Jinx makes numerous appearances in the comics spinoff of the Teen Titans animated television series, starting in issue #1. In #26–27, hints are given of Jinx later \\"turning over a new leaf\\" (like the hints in the episode Lightspeed). She also appears in issue #34 as Kid Flash's girlfriend. She gets captured with the other heroines by Blackfire and is rescued by the Titans in issue #36. In issue #39, she is still with Kid Flash; when Larry, who is playing Cupid, strikes other women with his love arrows when Flash wouldn't allow himself to be hit, she has her hands full with keeping them from flirting with her boyfriend. Jinx also appears in issue #40, still as part of the Hive Five at that time, and issue #43, helping the Titans stop the Fearsome Five. In #53, it is revealed that Jinx' nickname is \\"Lucky\\" and that she had entered a disappointing relationship with Kid Kold (aka Leo), before joining the H.I.V.E. In that issue she also shares her first kiss with Kid Flash.

She is a H.I.V.E. student and often associates with Gizmo and Mammoth. She has pale skin, pink hair, pink eyes with cat-like pupils and a witch-like attire. The animated Jinx's power is probability manipulation, very similar to early portrayals of Marvel's Scarlet Witch. In one episode she meets Kid Flash and is smitten by him, and is forced to choose between helping Madame Rouge and the Brotherhood of Evil or Kid Flash.

Life He began to be known on the London stage in the early years of the 18th century. He had tried the law and other professions, which he finally abandoned for the theatre. He had some success as a dramatic author, writing Love in a Hurry (performed in Dublin about 1709) and Pastora, or the Coy Shepherdess, an opera in 1712. For many years he toured the English provinces with his wife and son, producing pieces which he himself wrote, or medleys from various plays fitted together with songs and dialogues of his own. Aston wrote a A Brief Supplement to Colley Cibbey, Esq, somewhat in the manner of Colley Cibber's famous work. The 24-page pamphlet contains interesting comments on Betterton, Mrs. Bracegirdle, Underhill, Doggett, and a few others.

Herne (born James Ahearn, February 1, 1839 – June 2, 1901) was an American playwright and actor. He is considered by some critics to be the \\"American Ibsen\\", and his controversial play Margaret Fleming is often credited with having begun modern drama in America. Herne was a Georgist and wrote Shore Acres to promote the political economy of Henry George. BiographyStage actor= James A. Herne was born February 1, 1839, in Cohoes, New York. His parents were poor Irish immigrants who removed him from school at age thirteen to work in a brush factory. Herne decided to become an actor the next year but was twenty before he could join a traveling troupe. He made his debut in 1859 as George in a production of Uncle Tom's Cabin in Troy, New York. He enjoyed modest success as a young actor, appearing in Baltimore and Washington, D.C. with the John Thompson Ford company in the early 1860s. He was the leading man for the Lucille Western Touring Company from 1865 to 1867. He was briefly married, in the early 1860s, to Lucille's sister Helen Western, an actress who later became romantically involved with John Wilkes Booth. Herne managed the Grand Opera House at 23rd and 8th Avenue in New York City for a season. Herne and his wife Katherine Corcoran He then moved to San Francisco in 1870 to manage several other theaters. In San Francisco, he met David Belasco, with whom he collaborated on at least three of his plays. He also met and married his second wife, actress Katherine Corcoran. The couple had five children, one son, John, and four daughters, Alma, Dorothy, Julie and Katherine Chrystal who usually went by the name Chrystal Herne. Dorothy and Julie were also actresses. =Playwright= Herne was the first American playwright to incorporate dramatic realism. He ventured away from nineteenth century dramatic romance and melodrama. Much of Herne's work faded into obscurity in the twentieth century. However, he exerted a profound influence, directing American dramatic literature toward the depiction of complex socially realities. This was illustrated in his controversial play Margaret Fleming (1890). The work singled him out as an influential figure in 19th- century drama. Herne's first successful play, Hearts of Oak, was written and produced with Belasco in 1879. After this, Herne focused mostly on writing. Of his later plays, only a handful saw financial success in his lifetime. He continued to act, often in his own works, but also in the plays of others. In 1897 Herne played Nathaniel Berry in Shore Acres at the Harlem Opera House. It was the sixth consecutive season that he portrayed this character. Death  James A. Herne died at his home, 79 Convent Avenue, in Manhattan, New York City on June 2, 1901, at 5:00 pm of pneumonia. He was first sickened two months earlier in Chicago, where he was appearing in his production Sag Harbor.

A metropolis is identified as the centre of political and economic power. It possesses a more advanced labor market, more skilled and educated workers, an abundance of value-added production, higher standard of living, etc. A hinterland does not have the resources to withstand the political and economic interference of the metropolis. It features an abundance of resource extraction industries, fewer skilled and educated workers and a lower standard of living, and in many ways, it emulates the culture of the metropolis. The metropolis-hinterland paradigm has generally been applied to the relationship between Great Britain and its New World colonies. But it has also been applied to the relationship between industrial and rural regions within Canada.

Biography He was born on 20 March 1680Hans Volkmann, Emanuele d'Astorga, Leipzig 1911, p. 44 in Augusta, Sicily. No authentic account of Astorga's life can be successfully constructed from the obscure and confusing evidence that has been until now handed down, although historians have not failed to indulge many pleasant conjectures. According to Volkmann his father, a baron of Sicily, took an active part in the attempt to throw off the Spanish yoke, but was betrayed by his own soldiers and publicly executed. His wife and son were compelled to be spectators of his fate; and such was the effect upon them that his mother died on the spot, and Emanuele fell into a state of gloomy despondency, which threatened to deprive him of reason. By the kindness of the Princess of Ursini, the unfortunate young man was placed in a convent at Astorga, in León, where he completed a musical education which is said to have been begun in Palermo under Francesco Scarlatti. Here he recovered his health, and his admirable musical talents were cultivated under the best masters. On the details of this account no reliance can safely be placed, nor is there any certainty that in 1703, he entered the service of the Duke of Parma. Equally untrustworthy is the story that the duke, suspecting an attachment between his niece Elizabeth Farnese and Astorga, dismissed the musician. The established facts concerning Astorga are indeed few enough. They are: that the opera Dafne was written and conducted by the composer in Barcelona in 1709; that he visited London, where he wrote his Stabat Mater, possibly for the society of \\"Antient Musick\\"; that it was performed in Oxford in 1713; that in 1712, he was in Vienna. Around 1723 he was in Lisbon, where in 1726 he published Cantate da camera, his only published piece, and that he retired at an uncertain date to Bohemia. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition, he died on 21 August 1736, in a castle which had been given to him in the domains of Prince Lobkowicz, in Roudnice. However, according to a manuscript in the Santini collection in Münster he died in 1757 in Madrid. Astorga deserves remembrance for his dignified and poignant Stabat Mater, and for his numerous chamber-cantatas for one or two voices. He was probably the last composer to carry on the traditions of this form of chamber music as perfected by Alessandro Scarlatti.

Remains of one of four medieval stone boundary markers for the sanctuary of Saint John of Beverley in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Notre-Dame de Paris (France). St. Georgenberg, Tyrol. Plaque at St. Mary Magdalene Chapel, Dingli, Malta, indicating that the chapel did not enjoy ecclesiastical immunity The right of asylum (sometimes called right of political asylum; from the Ancient Greek word ἄσυλον) is an ancient juridical concept, under which a person persecuted by one's own country may be protected by another sovereign authority, such as another country or church official, who in medieval times could offer sanctuary. This right was recognized by the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the Hebrews, from whom it was adopted into Western tradition. René Descartes fled to the Netherlands, Voltaire to England, and Thomas Hobbes to France, because each state offered protection to persecuted foreigners. The Egyptians, Greeks, and Hebrews recognized a religious \\"right of asylum\\", protecting criminals (or those accused of crime) from legal action to some extent. This principle was later adopted by the established Christian church, and various rules were developed that detailed how to qualify for protection and what degree of protection one would receive. The Council of Orleans decided in 511, in the presence of Clovis I, that asylum could be granted to anyone who took refuge in a church or on church property, or at the home of a bishop. This protection was extended to murderers, thieves and adulterers alike. That \\"Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution\\" is enshrined in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and supported by the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. Under these agreements, a refugee is a person who is outside that person's own country's territory owing to fear of persecution on protected grounds, including race, caste, nationality, religion, political opinions and participation in any particular social group or social activities. Medieval England  In England, King Æthelberht of Kent proclaimed the first Anglo-Saxon laws on sanctuary in about 600 AD. However Geoffrey of Monmouth in his Historia Regum Britanniae (c. 1136) says that the legendary pre-Saxon king Dunvallo Molmutius (4th/5th century BC) enacted sanctuary laws among the Molmutine Laws as recorded by Gildas (c. 500–570).Geoffrey of Monmouth, Historia Regum Britanniae 2, 17 The term grith was used by the laws of king Ethelred. By the Norman era that followed 1066, two kinds of sanctuary had evolved: all churches had the lower- level powers and could grant sanctuary within the church proper, but the broader powers of churches licensed by royal charter extended sanctuary to a zone around the church. At least twenty-two churches had charters for this broader sanctuary, including * Battle Abbey * Beverley (see image, right) * Colchester * Durham, England * Hexham * Norwich * Ripon * Wells Cathedral * Winchester Cathedral * Westminster Abbey * York Minster Sometimes the criminal had to get to the chapel itself to be protected, or ring a certain bell, hold a certain ring or door-knocker, or sit on a certain chair (\\"frith-stool\\"). Some of these items survive at various churches. Elsewhere, sanctuary held in an area around the church or abbey, sometimes extending in radius to as much as a mile and a half. Stone \\"sanctuary crosses\\" marked the boundaries of the area; some crosses still exist as well. Thus it could become a race between the felon and the medieval law officers to the nearest sanctuary boundary. Serving of justice upon the fleet of foot could prove a difficult proposition. Church sanctuaries were regulated by common law. An asylum seeker had to confess his sins, surrender his weapons, and permit supervision by a church or abbey organization with jurisdiction. Seekers then had forty days to decide whether to surrender to secular authorities and stand trial for their alleged crimes, or to confess their guilt, abjure the realm, and go into exile by the shortest route and never return without the king's permission. Those who did return faced execution under the law or excommunication from the Church. If the suspects chose to confess their guilt and abjure, they did so in a public ceremony, usually at the church gates. They would surrender their possessions to the church, and any landed property to the crown. The coroner, a medieval official, would then choose a port city from which the fugitive should leave England (though the fugitive sometimes had this privilege). The fugitive would set out barefooted and bareheaded, carrying a wooden cross-staff as a symbol of protection under the church. Theoretically they would stay to the main highway, reach the port and take the first ship out of England. In practice, however, the fugitive could get a safe distance away, abandon the cross-staff and take off and start a new life. However, one can safely assume the friends and relatives of the victim knew of this ploy and would do everything in their power to make sure this did not happen; or indeed that the fugitives never reached their intended port of call, becoming victims of vigilante justice under the pretense of a fugitive who wandered too far off the main highway while trying to \\"escape.\\" Knowing the grim options, some fugitives rejected both choices and opted for an escape from the asylum before the forty days were up. Others simply made no choice and did nothing. Since it was illegal for the victim's friends to break into an asylum, the church would deprive the fugitive of food and water until a decision was made. During the Wars of the Roses, when the Yorkists or Lancastrians would suddenly get the upper hand by winning a battle, some adherents of the losing side might find themselves surrounded by adherents of the other side and not able to get back to their own side. Upon realizing this situation they would rush to sanctuary at the nearest church until it was safe to come out. A prime example is Queen Elizabeth Woodville, consort of Edward IV of England. In 1470, when the Lancastrians briefly restored Henry VI to the throne, Queen Elizabeth was living in London with several young daughters. She moved with them into Westminster for sanctuary, living there in royal comfort until Edward IV was restored to the throne in 1471 and giving birth to their first son Edward V during that time. When King Edward IV died in 1483, Elizabeth (who was highly unpopular with even the Yorkists and probably did need protection) took her five daughters and youngest son (Richard, Duke of York) and again moved into sanctuary at Westminster. To be sure she had all the comforts of home, she brought so much furniture and so many chests that the workmen had to knock holes in some of the walls to get everything in fast enough to suit her.Historical Memorials of Westminster Abbey by Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, pp. 35–36 Henry VIII changed the rules of asylum, reducing to a short list the types of crimes for which people were allowed to claim asylum. The medieval system of asylum was finally abolished entirely by James I in 1623. Modern political asylum Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that \\"Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.\\" The United Nations 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees guides national legislation concerning political asylum. Under these agreements, a refugee (or for cases where repressing base means has been applied directly or environmentally to the refugee) is a person who is outside that person's own country's territory (or place of habitual residence if stateless) owing to fear of persecution on protected grounds. Protected grounds include race, caste, nationality, religion, political opinions and membership or participation in any particular social group or social activities. Rendering true victims of persecution to their persecutor is a violation of a principle called non-refoulement, part of the customary and trucial Law of Nations. These are the accepted terms and criteria as principles and a fundamental part in the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees non-refoulement order.Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, Article 33 (1) Since the 1990s, victims of sexual persecution (which may include domestic violence, or systematic oppression of a gender or sexual minority) have come to be accepted in some countries as a legitimate category for asylum claims, when claimants can prove that the state is unable or unwilling to provide protection. =Right of asylum by country of refuge= The Dutch government grants asylum to a couple of hundred elderly from Yugoslavia, Poland, Hungary and the Baltic states. Since the end of World War II the people stayed in camps in Austria and West Germany. (Newsreel ) European Union Asylum in European Union member states formed over a half-century by application of the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 on the Status of Refugees. Common policies appeared in the 1990s in connection with the Schengen Agreement (which suppressed internal borders) so that asylum seekers unsuccessful in one Member State would not reapply in another. The common policy began with the Dublin Convention in 1990. It continued with the implementation of Eurodac and the Dublin Regulation in 2003, and the October 2009 adoption of two proposals by the European Commission.A single asylum procedure and equitable to establish a uniform status valid throughout the European Union: the final building blocks of international protection are asked, Brussels, October 21, 2009 (press release Europa.eu) =France= France was the first country to establish a constitutional right to asylum, this being enshrined in article 120 of the Constitution of 1793. This constitution, however, never entered into force. The modern French right of asylum is laid down by the 1958 Constitution, vis-à-vis the paragraph 4 of the preamble to the Constitution of 1946, to which the Preamble of the 1958 Constitution directly refers. The Constitution of 1946 incorporated of parts of the 1793 constitution which had guaranteed the right of asylum to \\"anyone persecuted because of his action for freedom\\" who are unable to seek protection in their home countries. In addition to the constitutional right to asylum, the modern French right to asylum (droit d'asile) is enshrined on a legal and regulatory basis in the Code de l'Entree et du Sejour des Etrangers et du Droit d'Asile (CESEDA). France also adheres to international agreements which provide for application modalities for the right of asylum, such as the 1951 United Nations (UN) Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (ratified in 1952), the additional 1967 protocol; articles K1 and K2 of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty as well as the 1985 Schengen Agreement, which defined EU immigration policy. Finally, the right of asylum is defined by article 18 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Some of the criteria for which an asylum application can be rejected include: i) Passage via “safe\\" third country, ii) Safe Country of Origin (An asylum seeker can be a prior refused asylum if they are a national of a country considered to be \\"safe\\" by the French asylum authority OFPRA), iii) Safety Threat (serious threat to the public order), or iv) Fraudulent Application (abuse of the asylum procedure for other reasons). The December 10, 2003, law limited political asylum through two main restrictions: *The notion of \\"internal asylum\\": the request may be rejected if the foreigner may benefit from political asylum on a portion of the territory of their home country. *The OFPRA (Office français de protection des réfugiés et apatrides – French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons) now makes a list of allegedly \\"safe countries\\" which respect political rights and principles of liberty. If the demander of asylum comes from such a country, the request is processed in 15 days, and receives no social assistance protection. They may contest the decision, but this does not suspend any deportation order. The first list, enacted in July 2005, included as \\"safe countries\\" Benin, Cape Verde, Ghana, Mali, Mauritius Island, India, Senegal, Mongolia, Georgia, Ukraine, Bosnia and Croatia. It had the effect of reducing in six months by about 80% the number of applicants from these countries.

Some people claim that, apart from the purely judicial path, the bureaucratic process is used to slow down and ultimately reject what might be considered as valid requests. According to Le Figaro, France granted 7,000 people the status of political refugee in 2006, out of a total of 35,000 requests; in 2005, the OFPRA in charge of examining the legitimacy of such requests granted less than 10,000 from a total of 50,000 requests.\\"La porte étroite de l'asile politique\\", Le Figaro, February 13, 2007, p.20 Numerous exiles from South American dictatorships, particularly from Augusto Pinochet's Chile and the Dirty War in Argentina, were received in the 1970s-80s. Since the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, tens of homeless Afghan asylum seekers have been sleeping in a park in Paris near the Gare de l'Est train station. Although their demands haven't been yet accepted, their presence has been tolerated. However, since the end of 2005, NGOs have been noting that the police separate Afghans from other migrants during raids, and expel via charters those who have just arrived at Gare de l'Est by train and haven't had time to demand asylum (a May 30, 2005, decree requires them to pay for a translator to help with official formalities). =United Kingdom= In the 19th century, the United Kingdom accorded political asylum to various persecuted people, among whom were many members of the socialist movement (including Karl Marx). With the 1845 attempted bombing of the Greenwich Royal Observatory and the 1911 Siege of Sidney Street in the context of the propaganda of the deed (anarchist) actions, political asylum was restricted. United States The United States recognizes the right of asylum of individuals as specified by international and federal law. A specified number of legally defined refugees who apply for refugee status overseas, as well as those applying for asylum after arriving in the U.S., are admitted annually. Since World War II, more refugees have found homes in the U.S. than any other nation and more than two million refugees have arrived in the U.S. since 1980. During much of the 1990s, the United States accepted over 100,000 refugees per year, though this figure has recently decreased to around 50,000 per year in the first decade of the 21st century, due to greater security concerns. As for asylum seekers, the latest statistics show that 86,400 persons sought sanctuary in the United States in 2001. Before the September 11 attacks individual asylum applicants were evaluated in private proceedings at the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS). Despite this, concerns have been raised with the U.S. asylum and refugee determination processes. A recent empirical analysis by three legal scholars described the U.S. asylum process as a game of refugee roulette; that is to say that the outcome of asylum determinations depends in large part on the personality of the particular adjudicator to whom an application is randomly assigned, rather than on the merits of the case. The very low numbers of Iraqi refugees accepted between 2003 and 2007 exemplifies concerns about the United States' refugee processes.

Since completing shakedown in the spring of 1970, Roark a unit of DesRon 21, conducted training operations out of her homeport of San Diego, California, until the end of the year. With 1971 she began preparations for her first deployment with the 7th Fleet in the Western Pacific and departed from San Diego 7 January. After stopping at Pearl Harbor and refueling at Midway Island, Roark suffered a fire in her engine room. The damage was sufficient to require her return to Pearl Harbor for repairs. Almost two months later, in March, she was underway again for WestPac. She remained in the western Pacific until July, when she started for home, arriving in San Diego, California, on 10 August. For the remainder of 1971, Roark operated out of San Diego. The new year, 1972, brought with it another deployment to the Far East. She departed San Diego on 8 February and arrived in Subic Bay, Philippines, on 29 February. She operated in the Western Pacific, primarily in the Vietnam area until 15 August, when she pointed her bow homeward. Roark entered San Diego 30 August and remained in the vicinity for the duration of 1972 and the first eight months of 1973. She departed San Diego in August and arrived in Subic Bay on 31 August. After almost four months of deployment with the 7th Fleet, Roark sailed into San Diego on 21 December 1973. :[1973-1987] Roark transferred to the Naval Reserve in 1987 and was decommissioned 14 December 1991.

In the process of swarming, a single colony splits into two or more distinct colonies. Swarming is mainly a spring phenomenon, usually within a two- or three-week period depending on the locale, but occasional swarms can happen throughout the producing season. Secondary afterswarms, or cast swarms may happen. Cast swarms are usually smaller and are accompanied by a virgin queen. Sometimes a beehive will swarm in succession until it is almost totally depleted of workers. Hi-resolution picture of a swarm of bees located in Melbourne, Australia One species of honey bee that participates in such swarming behavior is Apis cerana. The reproduction swarms of this species settle 20–30 m away from the natal nest for a few days and will then depart for a new nest site after getting information from scout bees. Scout bees search for suitable cavities in which to construct the swarm's home. Successful scouts will then come back and report the location of suitable nesting sites to the other bees.Seeley, Thomas D. The wisdom of the hive: the social physiology of honey bee colonies. Harvard University Press, 2009. Apis mellifera participates in a similar swarming process. Preparation Honey bee queen cup Worker bees create queen cups throughout the year. When the hive is getting ready to swarm, the queen lays eggs into the queen cups. New queens are raised and the hive may swarm as soon as the queen cells are capped and before the new virgin queens emerge from their queen cells. A laying queen is too heavy to fly long distances. Therefore, the workers will stop feeding her before the anticipated swarm date and the queen will stop laying eggs. Swarming creates an interruption in the brood cycle of the original colony. During the swarm preparation, scout bees will simply find a nearby location for the swarm to cluster. When a honey bee swarm emerges from a hive they do not fly far at first. They may gather in a tree or on a branch only a few metres from the hive. There, they cluster about the queen and send 20 - 50 scout bees out to find suitable new nest locations. This intermediate stop is not for permanent habitation and they will normally leave within a few hours to a suitable location. It is from this temporary location that the cluster will determine the final nest site based on the level of excitement of the dances of the scout bees. It is unusual if a swarm clusters for more than three days at an intermediate stop. Swarming creates a vulnerable time in the life of honey bees. Swarms are provisioned only with the nectar or honey they carry in their stomachs. A swarm will starve if it does not quickly find a home and more nectar stores. This happens most often with early swarms that leave on a warm day that is followed by cold or rainy weather in spring. The remnant colony, after having produced one or more swarms, is usually well provisioned with food. But, the new queen can be lost or eaten by predators during her mating flight, or poor weather can prevent her mating flight. In this case the hive has no further young brood to raise additional queens, and it will not survive. A cast swarm will usually contain a young virgin queen. The propensity to swarm differs among the honey bee species. Africanized bees are notable for their propensity to swarm or abscond. Absconding is a process where the whole hive leaves rather than splits like in swarming. Being tropical bees, they tend to swarm or abscond any time food is scarce, thus making themselves vulnerable in colder locales. Mainly for lack of sufficient winter stores, the Africanized bee colonies tend to perish in the winter in higher latitudes. Generally, a weak bee colony will not swarm until the colony has produced a larger population of bees. Weak bee colonies can be the result of low food supply, disease such as Foulbrood Disease, or from a queen that produces low quantities of eggs. Nest site selection A good nesting site for honey bees must be large enough to accommodate their swarm (minimum 15 liters in volume, preferably ≈40 liters). It should be well protected from the elements, and have a small entrance (approximately 12.5 cm squared) located at the bottom of the cavity. It must receive a certain amount of warmth from the sun, and should not be infested with ants. In addition to these criteria, nest sites with abandoned honeycombs, if the scout bees can find one, are preferred, because this allows the bees to better conserve their resources. The scout bees are the most experienced foragers in the resting swarm cluster. An individual scout returning to the cluster promotes a location she has found. She uses the waggle dance to indicate its direction, distance, and quality to others in the cluster. The more excited she is about her findings, the more excitedly she dances. If she can convince other scouts to check out the location she found, they take off, check out the proposed site, and choose to promote the site further upon their return. Several sites may be promoted by different scouts at first. After several hours and sometimes days, a favorite location gradually emerges from this decision-making process. In order for a decision to be made in a relatively short amount of time (the swarm can only survive for about three days on the honey on which they gorged themselves before leaving the hive), a decision will often be made when somewhere around 80% of the scouts have agreed upon a single location and/or when there is a quorum of 20-30 scouts present at a potential nest site. (If the swarm waited for less than 80% of the scouts to agree, the bees would lack confidence in the suitability of the site. If they waited for more than 80% of the scouts to agree, the swarm would be wasting its stored honey.) When the scout bees agree where to nest, the whole clustered swarm takes off and flies to it. A swarm may fly a kilometer or more to the scouted location, with the scouts guiding the rest of the bees by quickly flying overhead in the proper direction.Bee Swarms Follow High-speed 'Streaker' Bees To Find A New Nest; ScienceDaily (Nov. 24, 2008) This collective decision-making process is remarkably successful in identifying the most suitable new nest site and keeping the swarm intact. BeekeepingSwarm control methods= Beekeepers who do not wish to increase their number of active hives may use one or more of many methods for swarm control. Most methods simulate swarming to extinguish the swarming drive. * Clipping one wing of the queen. When one wing of the queen is clipped, a swarm may issue but due to the queen's inability to fly, the swarm will gather right outside the original hive, where the swarm can be easily collected. Even though this is not a swarm prevention method it is a method of swarm retrieval. * In the Demaree method a frame of capped brood is removed with the old queen. This frame is put in a hive box with empty drawn frames and foundation at the same location of the old hive. A honey super is added to the top of this hive topped by a crown board (known as an \\"inner cover\\" in America). The remaining hive box sans queen is inspected for queen cells. All queen cells are destroyed. This hive box, which has most of the bees, is put on top of the crown board. Foraging bees will return to the lower box depleting the population of the upper box. After a week to ten days both parts are inspected again and any subsequent queen cells destroyed. After another period of separation the swarming drive is extinguished and the hives can be re-combined. * Simply keep the brood nest open. In preparation for swarming, bees fill the brood nest with honey. The queen stops laying to be trim enough to fly, and her newly unemployed nurse bees go with her. The concept of this method is to open the brood nest to employ those nurse bees and get the queen laying again and redirect this sequence of events. This is done by any number of slight variations from empty frames in the brood nest, frames of bare foundation in the brood nest or drawn combs in the brood nest, or moving brood combs to the box above to cause more expansion of the brood nest. * Checkerboarding. In the late winter, frames are rearranged above the growing brood nest. The frames above the brood nest are alternated between full honey frames and empty drawn out frames or even foundationless frames. It is believed that only colonies that perceive to have enough reserves will attempt to swarm. Checkerboarding frames above the brood nest apparently destroys this sense of having reserves.Cushman, David Swarm Control of Honey Bee Colonies Alternatively, there are also swarm traps with Nasonov pheromone lures that can be used to attract swarms. Beekeepers who are aware that a colony has swarmed may add brood with eggs that is free of mites. Given young brood the bees have a second chance to raise a new queen if the first one fails. =Swarm capture= Bee swarm on tree branch in eastern Arkansas. Beekeepers are sometimes called to capture swarms that are cast by feral honey bees or from the hives of domestic beekeepers. Most beekeepers will remove a honeybee swarm for a small fee or maybe even free if they are nearby. Bee swarms can almost always be collected alive and relocated by a competent beekeeper or bee removal company. Extermination of a bee swarm is rarely necessary and discouraged if bee removal is possible. There are various methods to capture a swarm. When the swarm first settles down and forms a cluster it is relatively easy to capture the swarm in a suitable box or nuc. One method that can be employed on a sunny day when the swarm is located on a lower branch or small tree is to put a white sheet under the swarm location. A nuc box is put on the sheet. The swarm is sprayed from the outside with a sugar solution (soaks the bees so they become too heavy to fly away) and then vigorously shaken off the branch. The main cluster, hopefully including the queen, will fall onto the white sheet and the bees will quickly go for the first dark entrance space in sight, which is the opening of the nuc. An organized march toward the opening will ensue and after 15 minutes the majority of bees will be inside the nuc. This capture method does not work at night. If the swarm is too embroiled in its perch so it cannot be dropped into a box or sheet, a skep can be suspended over it and gentle smoke used to \\"herd\\" the swarm into the skep. Smoke is not recommended to calm a clustered swarm. Smoke will have the opposite effect on a clustered swarm as many bees will become agitated and fly about instead of settling down. =Human behavior= A beekeeper collecting a bee swarm. A swarm of bees sometimes frightens people, though the bees are usually not aggressive at this stage of their life cycle. This is principally due to the swarming bees' lack of brood (developing bees) to defend and their interest in finding a new nesting location for their queen. This does not mean that bees from a swarm will not attack if they perceive a threat; however, most bees only attack in response to intrusions against their colony. Additionally, bees seldom swarm except when the position of the sun is direct and impressive. Swarm clusters, hanging from a tree branch, will move on and find a suitable nesting location in a day or two. Encountering a bee swarm for the first time can be alarming. Bees tend to swarm near their hives or honeycombs, so if a swarm is visible then a nest is nearby. Swarms are usually not aggressive unless provoked, so it is important to keep a good distance from swarms in order to avoid provoking them. ReferencesExternal links * Swarm Prevention — MAAREC.

They are among the few heroes on the series not to have originated in the comic book. Taken out of context, their names translate from Spanish to \\"More\\" and \\"Less\\", but in their particular context (i.e. the symbols on their chests and their rallying cry), their names mean \\"Plus and Minus\\" as both \\"más\\" and \\"menos\\" can be used as mathematics terms. Más y Menos are both voiced by Freddy Rodriguez. Fictional character biographyTeen Titans (TV series and tie in Comics)= They are a pair of Spanish-speaking twins from Guatemala who can move at super speed, but only when they are in contact with each other. In \\"Titans East\\", Aqualad states that their other power is to talk only in Spanish. Their battle cry is \\"¡Más o Menos, sí podemos!\\" which translates as, \\"Plus or Minus, yes we can!\\". It seems that they are partially based on the Maya Hero Twins Hunahpu and Xbalanque depicted in the Popol Vuh chronicles; however, since their incorporation into the mainstream DC Universe, their origins and history have not been dealt with. The twins make their first appearance in \\"Titans East\\" as Titans East members, a Teen Titans team set up in Steel City for the purpose of hunting down Brother Blood. Cyborg arrives to help the team build their tower, but Brother Blood attacks with his Cyborg-drones and defeats the Titans. Unknowingly to Cyborg, Blood places all the members of the Titans East team under mind control and later forces them to attack Cyborg. The original Titans arrive following Cyborg's S.O.S., and Cyborg battles Blood while Titans West battles Titans East. With Brother Blood's defeat, Titans East is freed. Más y Menos also develop a crush on Starfire when they meet her, and both twins fight for her affection (the only time where they do not cooperate). In the episode \\"For Real\\", Control Freak uses the \\"Spanish to English\\" option on his remote control to make Más and Menos \\"talk in English\\", which they do throughout the episode. This effect is not permanent, as they speak Spanish when they reappear in \\"Calling All Titans\\" in which they battle Johnny Rancid and Cinderblock and are separated when Menos is captured but Más escapes. He seeks Beast Boy for help and demonstrates he can sense where Menos is located and can realize Menos is in pain. However, when Menos is frozen, Más can no longer sense his brother. In the fight in the Brotherhood of Evil's lair during the episode \\"Titans Together\\", Más unfreezes Menos and they thaw the remaining captured Titans and freeze the villains. In Teen Titans Go! (a comic book based on the animated series), the twins raced Kid Flash, a young superhero also gifted with super speed. The race became a re-enactment of the fable of The Tortoise and the Hare. Kid Flash was probably faster, but he wasted time out of over- confidence. =Mainstream DC comics= At the DC Nation panel, current Teen Titans writer Geoff Johns announced that Más y Menos are to appear in the mainstream DC Comics. This is the first time a character from the Teen Titans show will make the transfer to comics. In Teen Titans #38, Más y Menos joined—and left—the Teen Titans during the missing year after the Infinite Crisis. They are also portrayed as being older than their animated counterparts. In Final Crisis #1, they team up with Sparx and Empress to battle the Mirror Master and Doctor Light. After a short battle in which the villains win, the two are laid out, impaled with shards of glass.Final Crisis #1 (2008) The Director's Cut states that they survived, albeit in bad condition; they can be seen limping in the foreground to the Hall of Justice in a later panel. Más y Menos appear in a pin-up drawn by Brett Booth in Teen Titans #100, the final issue of the series. They are shown in a high-speed water balloon fight with Kid Flash. Powers and abilities Más y Menos have metahuman powers that allow them to move at superspeed whenever they are touching each other. A comment by Kid Flash in Teen Titans Go! #34, however, indicates that their powers are based in the Speed Force in this continuity. Their maximum velocity is stated to be seven times the speed of sound. Más has shown the ability to sense where his brother is when he is conscious. He is also able to vibrate Menos at an extreme rate to cause heat. The twins seem to understand English, even though they do not speak it. This is shown when in the TV series Control Freak asks them how they can travel so fast, and they answer the question in Spanish.

He became a fan of R&B; music and after he met Doc Pomus the two teamed up to compose for Aldon Music at offices in New York City's Brill Building. Their songwriting collaboration saw Pomus write the lyrics and Shuman the melody, although occasionally each worked on both. Their compositions would be recorded by artists such as Dion, The Flamingos,Writing credit, Zirkon 45 RPM 7\\" No. 45-1023 Andy Williams, Bobby Darin, Fabian, Ajda Pekkan, The Drifters, and Elvis Presley, among others.

Pomus often drew on life events which inspired his creativity. It was after a break-up with his girlfriend that Pomus, who had been driving in his car, was struck in awe by the sounds of the car horns blaring amidst his thoughts. Arriving at the studio, Pomus attempted to assimilate the sound of the horns and penned an introduction to a piece he initially titled \\"A Crowded Avenue\\". Later, the work progressed with Shuman, who helped finalize the draft. A chorus was added and the name of the song was changed to \\"Can't Get Used to Losing You\\", which became one of the biggest hits for Andy Williams in 1963. With the advent of the British invasion, they moved to London where they penned songs for a number of British musicians. After the partnership with Doc Pomus ended in 1965, Shuman moved to Paris, France, where he wrote songs for Johnny Hallyday and embarked on his own recording career. One of his hits in the early 1970s was \\"(Il Neige Sur) Le Lac Majeur\\". He also wrote a couple of hits in the UK (including The Small Faces, \\"Sha-La-La-La-Lee\\" and Cilla Black, \\"Love's Just A Broken Heart\\", both co-written with Kenny Lynch), as well as a musical, Budgie (lyrics by Don Black). With the Welsh songwriter Clive Westlake, he wrote \\"Here I Go Again\\", which was recorded by The Hollies. Billy J. Kramer enjoyed success with another Shuman song, \\"Little Children\\". In 1968, Shuman teamed with Eric Blau and adapted the French lyrics of songs by the Belgian composer Jacques Brel used as the basis of the successful off-Broadway production Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris. Some of the songs from the show were subsequently recorded by Scott Walker, including \\"Jackie\\" and \\"Mathilde\\". Shuman appeared in both the stage revue and the 1975 film adaptation. This was followed the next year with work on the soundtrack of the film Sex O'Clock U.S.A., which is notable for featuring one of the earliest known gay songs, \\"You're My Man,\\"London Records 12\\" -L.9, 1976 while another one of his compositions from the soundtrack, \\"Baby Come On\\" (billed under the Sex O'Clock U.S.A. name during its chart run) become a modest hit on Billboard's Disco chart, peaking at number 37 in July 1977. He also did many collaborations with the Israeli singer Mike Brant, and composed film scores, often French movies, including A Day at the Beach (1970), Romance of a Horsethief (1971), Black Thursday (1974), À nous les petites Anglaises (1976), Monsieur Papa (1977) and The More It Goes, the Less It Goes (1977). Shuman was elected to the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992. He also worked occasionally as an actor, notably appearing with Jodie Foster in The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane (for which he was also musical supervisor). He died of cancer on 2 November 1991, leaving his wife, Maria-Pia and their four daughters, Maria-Cella, Barbara, Maria-Pia and Eva-Maria. Doc Pomus had died in March of the same year. Awards and honors Shuman was named one of the 2010 recipients of the Ahmet Ertegun Award from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He joined his early collaborator Doc Pomus, who was inducted in 1992.

Other authorities, notably the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition, give the date as 11 April 1842date of birth according to naturals record (see below)17 August 1901) was a French composer best known for several internationally successful comic operas, including Les noces d'Olivette (1879), La mascotte (1880), Gillette de Narbonne (1882), La cigale et la fourmi (1886), Miss Helyett (1890), and La poupée (1896). After Audran's initial success in Paris, his works also became a regular feature in the West End of London, in adaptations that Audran supervised. Most of his works are now neglected, but La mascotte has been revived occasionally and has been recorded for the gramophone. Early life and career Audran was born in Lyon, the son of Marius-Pierre Audran (1816–87), who had a career as a tenor at the Opéra-Comique.Lamb, Andrew. \\"Audran, Edmond\\".

Poster for the 1884 production of Le grand mogol in Paris. Audran became organist of the church of St Joseph there, for which he wrote religious music including, in 1873, a mass that was also performed in Paris at St Eustache. He made his first appearance as a dramatic composer at Marseilles with L'Ours et le Pacha (1862), a musical version of one of Eugène Scribe's vaudevilles. This was followed by La Chercheuse d'Esprit (1864), a comic opera, also produced at Marseille. Audran's compositions included a funeral march on the death of Giacomo Meyerbeer, which was performed with some success; some songs in the Provençal dialect, including La cour d'amour (Marseilles, 1881), and various sacred pieces. He produced a Mass (Marseille, 1873), an oratorio, La sulamite (Marseille, 1876), Adoro te, a motet (Paris, 1882) and numerous minor works, but he is known almost entirely as a composer of light opera. Operetta successes While still in Marseilles, Audran wrote a half dozen operettas, the most successful of which was Le grand mogol (1877), with a libretto by Henri Chivot. Together with the playwright Alfred Duru, Audran and Chivot revised the piece for a Paris production in 1884. He moved to Paris in 1879, \\"where at first he occupied a humble lodging in a garret\\", but he was soon prosperous, with the success of Les noces d'Olivette (1879), which had \\"an enormous vogue\\". The work speedily found its way to London (as Olivette), in an English translation by H. B. Farnie, and ran for more than a year at the Strand Theatre (1880–81). The critic of The Pall Mall Gazette, predicting \\"a brilliant and enduring success\\", wrote, \\"Bizet in his Carmen has scarcely been more successful in catching the atmosphere of Andalusia than has M. Audran in assigning to Les Noces d'Olivette that of Provence.\\"\\"Olivette at the Strand Theatre\\", The Pall Mall Gazette, 27 September1880, p. 11 After Audran moved to Paris, most of his stage works were premiered there before being presented abroad, but four of his works were premiered elsewhere: La paradis de Mahomet (Brussels, 1887), Photis (Geneva, 1896), Indiana (Manchester, 1886) and La reine des reines ( Strasbourg, 1896).Both Grove and Baker give the place and date of the premiere of Indiana as London, 11 October 1886, but in fact it premiered in Manchester on 4 October before opening in London the following week. See \\"Indiana at Manchester\\", The Daily News, 5 October 1886, p. 5; and \\"The London Theatres\\",The Era, 16 October 1886, p. 14 In Paris, the success of La mascotte (1880) was so great that the intendant of the Bouffes-Parisiens and Audran entered into a five-year contract under which Audran would compose for no other Paris theatre.\\"The Drama in Paris\\", The Era, 29 January 1881, p. 5 He worked with a large number of librettists, but his most frequent collaborators were Maxime Boucheron, Chivot, Duru and Maurice Ordonneau. Of one of his collaborations, a critic wrote, \\"I might dispose of the new three- act comic opera brought out at the Bouffes-Parisiens by simply stating that its title is Pervenche, that its libretto is by MM. Chivot and Duru, its score by M.

He died in Tierceville on the north coast of France at the age of 61.Some sources indicated that his age was 59: see note 1, above. The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica article and the Musical Times obituary give the place and date of death as Paris, 16 August 1901. Critical assessment According to the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition, Audran was one of the best of the successors of Jacques Offenbach: In 1957, the critic Philip Hope-Wallace wrote, \\"Those who attend on seaside bandstands will know the name of Edmond Audran … for his overtures to La Mascotte, La Poupie and Miss Helyett still set the old squares' feet a-tapping. If he never quite shook out of his sleeve any little inspiration which could rival Offenbach he made a very good second best talent go a long way. He himself did not greatly care for La Mascotte ... thinking his other works more subtle.\\"Hope-Wallace, Philip. \\"La Mascotte, The Gramophone, April 1957, p. 63 Few of Audran's works have been recorded, but a French set of La mascotte was issued in 1957.Brief excerpts from the set can be heard here La mascotte is credited with bringing the word \\"mascot\\" into the English language. The Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins states, \\"The French operetta La Mascotte by Edmond Audran had its première on 29 December 1880. The next year the word made its first appearance in English. French mascotte derives from masco 'witch' in the dialect of southern France. At first mascot meant simply 'a person or thing supposed to bring good luck' and did not have to be carried or displayed, as now.\\"Cresswell, Julia. \\"mascot\\".

Herne. The play is remarkable because many critics consider it to be the first \\"modern\\" drama, a play that focused more on the psychological complexities of its characters and on the role of social determinism the characters' lives than on dramatic or melodramatic retellings. It first ran in Lynn, Massachusetts in July 1890, but was rejected as too controversial by theater managers in New York and Boston. Two friends and financiers of Herne's rented a theater in Boston for its opening, and the play had two three-week runs, one in May and one in October 1891. Herne's wife, Katherine Corcoran, played the title role; Herne played Philip Fleming during the trial runs but later switched to the role of street peddler Joe Fletcher. Although some critics liked the attempt towards realism, many others felt the play dwelt too much on unseemly characters and events, and audiences were shocked when Margaret nurses the baby (not her own) onstage. Story In Act I, the audience meets Philip Fleming, manager of an inherited mill that's facing some financial troubles. He speaks with Joe Fletcher, a street peddler, and talks about his new wife, Margaret, and their new baby, Lucy. Fletcher leaves and Doctor Larkin enters and informs Fleming that he has just delivered a baby to a young immigrant woman named Lena Schmidt, and he has discovered that Fleming is the father. He advises Fleming to go to Lena. Meanwhile, Margaret is at home with baby Lucy, talking to the nursemaid, Maria Bindley. Maria reveals that her sister, Lena, has been despondent since the birth of her child, though Maria does not know who the father is. In Act II, Doctor Larkin lectures Margaret and Philip separately about how additional stress will worsen Margaret's glaucoma. Margaret talks to Maria and agrees to go and visit her sister, hoping it will cheer her. In Act III, Margaret visits the Bindley/Schmidt household, only to find that Lena has just died after writing a letter. Margaret compels Maria to read her the letter, which reveals that Philip was the father of Lena's baby. After sending everyone away, including sending a child to bring her husband to the house, she is left alone with the howling child and begins to nurse. Act IV opens with a now-blind Margaret at home. Philip has been missing for seven days, but returns home to find that Margaret has taken in his illegitimate son. She tells him \\"the wife-heart has gone out of me,\\" but also says she will stand by him as he tries to rebuild himself in business and reputation around the town.

Pork chops are unprocessed and leaner than other cuts. Chops are commonly served as an individual portion.  Popularity  Pork is one of the most commonly consumed meats in the world. In the United States, pork chops are the most commonly consumed meat cut from the pork loin and account for 10% of total pork consumption. Variations The center cut or pork loin chop includes a large T-shaped bone, and is structurally similar to the beef T-bone steak. Rib chops come from the rib portion of the loin, and are similar to rib eye steaks. Blade or shoulder chops come from the spine, and tend to contain much connective tissue. The sirloin chop is taken from the (rear) leg end and also contains much connective tissue. The shoulder end produces chops that are considerably fattier than the chops taken from the loin end. The so-called \\"Iowa Chop\\" is a thick center cut; the term was coined in 1976 by the Iowa Pork Producers Association. A \\"Bacon Chop\\" is cut from the shoulder end and leaves the pork belly meat attached.Food and Wine Magazine August 2008 Pork chops are sometimes sold marinated or can be marinated at home to add flavor; marinades such as a chili sauce or a barbecue sauce are common. As pork is often cooked more thoroughly than beef, thus running the risk of drying out, pork chops can be brined to maintain moistness. One could also wrap pork chops in bacon to add further moistness during the cooking process. Preparation Pork chops are suitable for roasting, grilling, or frying, but there are also stuffed recipes. They can be used boneless or bone- in. Pork chops are usually cut between thick.

The Hongan-ji was the primary fortress of the Ikkō-ikki, mobs of warrior monks, priests, and farmers who opposed Oda's rule. He ordered one of his admirals, Kuki Yoshitaka, to organize a blockade against the fleets of the Ikki's allies, who sought to supply the fortress and break the siege. Many of the ruling families of the neighboring provinces opposed Oda, chief among them the Mōri clan. The first battle In the first battle, in 1576, the Mōri defeated Kuki Yoshitaka's fleet, breaking the blockade and supplying the fortress. Both sides fought with firearms, a rather new development in Japanese warfare; but Mōri's experience and knowledge of naval tactics was ultimately the deciding factor. The second battle Two years later, the Ishiyama Hongan-ji was still under siege, and Oda's fleet, commanded once again by Kuki Yoshitaka, made another attempt to break the Mōri supply lines. Going against convention, Yoshitaka fought with six very large ō-adakebune ships, rather than a combination of small (kobaya), medium (sekibune), and large (adakebune) craft. Normally, adakebune were essentially wooden floating fortresses, covered in gun and bow emplacements. According to some accounts, it may be believed that these six were the first ironclads, and were built such that guns could not penetrate them. However, rather than true ironclads, made primarily or entirely of metal, these craft probably simply had limited iron plating in key locations. Several Mōri vessels were burned and sunk, and Oda's fleet ultimately achieved victory. The supply lines were broken, and the Hongan-ji fell soon afterwards. However, during this battle an interesting flaw was discovered in the ō-adakebune design. As Mōri samurai rushed to board the large ship, all the defending warriors ran to that side of the deck, to defend themselves, and the ship capsized as its center of gravity shifted. Yoshitaka went on to defeat the Mōri once more the following year.

Several smaller craters can be seen in and around Webb. Moltke taken from Apollo 10. Lunar craters are impact craters on Earth's Moon. The Moon's surface has many craters, all of which were formed by impacts. History The word crater was adopted from the Greek word for \\"vessel\\" (Κρατήρ a Greek vessel used to mix wine and water). Galileo built his first telescope in late 1609, and turned it to the Moon for the first time on November 30, 1609. He discovered that, contrary to general opinion at that time, the Moon was not a perfect sphere, but had both mountains and cup-like depressions. These were named craters by Schroeter (1791), extending its previous use with volcanoes. Robert Hooke in \\"Micrographia\\" (1665) proposed two hypotheses for lunar crater formation: one that the craters caused by projectile bombardment from space, the other that they were the products of subterranean lunar vulcanismRobert Hooke. «Micrographia: or, Some physiological descriptions of minute bodies made by magnifying glasses». London: J. Martyn and J. Allestry, 1665. http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15491. Scientific opinion as to the origin of craters swung back and forth over the ensuing centuries. The competing theories were (a) volcanic eruptions blasting holes in the Moon, (b) meteoric impact, (c) a theory known as the Welteislehre developed in Germany between the two World Wars which suggested glacial action creating the craters. Grove Karl Gilbert suggested in 1893 that the Moon's craters were formed by large asteroid impacts. Ralph Baldwin in 1949 wrote that the Moon's craters were mostly of impact origin. Around 1960, Gene Shoemaker revived the idea. According to David H. Levy, Gene \\"saw the craters on the Moon as logical impact sites that were formed not gradually, in eons, but explosively, in seconds.\\" Lunar craters as captured through the backyard telescope of an amateur astronomer, partially illuminated by the sun on a waning crescent moon. Evidence collected during the Apollo Project and from unmanned spacecraft of the same period proved conclusively that meteoric impact, or impact by asteroids for larger craters, was the origin of almost all lunar craters, and by implication, most craters on other bodies as well. The formation of new craters is studied in the lunar impact monitoring program at NASA. The biggest recorded creation was caused by an impact recorded on March 17, 2013. Visible to the naked eye, the impact is believed to be from an approximately meteoroid striking the surface at a speed of . In March 2018, the discovery of around 7,000 formerly unidentified lunar craters via convolutional neural network developed at the University of Toronto Scarborough was announced. Characteristics Because of the Moon's lack of water, atmosphere, and tectonic plates, there is little erosion, and craters are found that exceed two billion years in age. The age of large craters is determined by the number of smaller craters contained within it, older craters generally accumulating more small, contained craters. Eratosthenes (center left) as imaged from Earth by amateur astronomer Joel Frohlich using an 8-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope. The smallest craters found have been microscopic in size, found in rocks returned to Earth from the Moon. The largest crater called such is about 290 kilometres (181 mi) across in diameter, located near the lunar South Pole. However, it is believed that many of the lunar maria were formed by giant impacts, with the resulting depression filled by upwelling lava. Craters typically will have some or all of the following features: *a surrounding area with materials splashed out of the ground when the crater was formed; this is typically lighter in shade than older materials due to exposure to solar radiation for a lesser time *raised rim, consisting of materials ejected but landing very close by *crater wall, the downward-sloping portion of the crater *crater floor, a more or less smooth, flat area, which as it ages accumulates small craters of its own *central peak, found only in some craters with a diameter exceeding 26 kilometres (16 mi); this is generally a splash effect caused by the kinetic energy of the impacting object being turned to heat and melting some lunar material. Lunar crater categorization In 1978, Chuck Wood and Leif Andersson of the Lunar & Planetary Lab devised a system of categorization of lunar impact craters. They used a sampling of craters that were relatively unmodified by subsequent impacts, then grouped the results into five broad categories. These successfully accounted for about 99% of all lunar impact craters. The LPC Crater Types were as follows: * ALC -- small, cup-shaped craters with a diameter of about 10 km or less, and no central floor. The archetype for this category is Albategnius C. * BIO -- similar to an ALC, but with small, flat floors. Typical diameter is about 15 km. The lunar crater archetype is Biot. * SOS -- the interior floor is wide and flat, with no central peak. The inner walls are not terraced. The diameter is normally in the range of 15–25 km. The archetype is Sosigenes. * TRI -- these complex craters are large enough so that their inner walls have slumped to the floor. They can range in size from 15–50 km in diameter. The archetype crater is Triesnecker. * TYC -- these are larger than 50 km, with terraced inner walls and relatively flat floors. They frequently have large central peak formations. Tycho is the archetype for this class. Beyond a couple of hundred kilometers diameter, the central peak of the TYC class disappear and they are classed as basins. Large craters, similar in size to maria, but without (or with small amount of) dark lava filling, are sometimes called thalassoids. Beginning in 2009 Dr. Nadine G. Barlow of Northern Arizona University began to convert the Wood and Andersson lunar impact-crater database into digital format. Dr. Barlow is also creating a new lunar impact crater database similar to Wood and Andersson's, except hers will include all impact craters greater than or equal to five kilometers in diameter and is based on the Clementine spacecraft's images of the lunar surface. The moon zoo project within the Zooniverse program aimed to use citizen scientists to map the size and shape of as many craters as possible using data from the NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. However, it has since been retired. Names Craters constitute 95% of all named lunar features. Usually they are named after deceased scientists and other explorers. This tradition comes from Giovanni Battista Riccioli, who started it in 1651.Riccioli's map of the Moon (1651) Since 1919, assignment of these names is regulated by the International Astronomical Union. Small craters of special interest (for example, visited by lunar missions) receive human first names (Robert, José, Louise etc.). One of the biggest lunar craters, Apollo, is named after Apollo missions. Many smaller craters inside and near it bear the names of deceased American astronauts, and many craters inside and near Mare Moscoviense bear the names of deceased Soviet cosmonauts. Besides this, in 1970 twelve craters were named after twelve living astronauts (6 Soviet and 6 American). The majority of named lunar craters are satellite craters: their names consist of the name of a nearby named crater and a capital letter (for example, , , and so on). Lunar crater chains are usually named after a nearby crater. Their Latin names contain the word Catena (\\"chain\\"). For example, Catena Davy is situated near the crater Davy.

He was educated at Bedford School, and started a degree at Christ's College, Cambridge in 1851, but left after a year due to ill health. Migrating to Australia for a warmer climate, he was briefly a prospector in the Victorian gold rush in 1852. In 1854, Daintree accepted an appointment as assistant geologist to Alfred Selwyn in the Victorian Geological Survey. Daintree returned to London to study assaying and metallurgy at the Royal School of Mines. During his studies in 1857, Daintree became interested in photography. Daintree rejoined the Geological Survey Office in January 1859 and pioneered the use of photography in geological field work. His photographs of the Victorian goldfields were exhibited at the 1862 International Exhibition in London. He may have also collaborated with Antoine Fauchery in a volume of photographic works called Australia published in 1857. Richard Daintree married Lettice Agnes Foot, the daughter of surveyor Henry Foot on 1 December 1857. They would go on to have a family of two sons and six daughters. Queensland work Rockhampton. Photo taken by Richard Daintree. Daintree left the Geological Survey Office to become a resident partner with William Hann in pastoral properties on the Burdekin River in 1864. This enabled him to pursue his interests in prospecting and photography. He made a number of discoveries over the next few years including several goldfields at Cape River in 1867, Gilbert in 1869 and Etheridge in 1869–70. Daintree was the first person to systematically examine the coal seams near the Bowen River at Collinsville in Queensland and discovered a copper deposit on the Einasleigh River. During his time in Queensland, Daintree advocated a government geological survey office and his lobbying bore fruit when it was established in 1868. He was named as the geologist in charge of north Queensland between 1868 and 1870. During that time, he carried out a geological survey of North Queensland and his photographs of the Cape River goldfields are a valuable record of life on the Queensland goldfields. He was succeeded as government geologist by Robert Logan Jack. Richard Daintree was also collecting botanical specimens in his travels. Queensland herbarium records show that he collected botanical specimens from Rockhampton, Queensland and the ranges of Central Queensland. These included Acacia excelsa Benth. which was once named Acacia daintreeana by Ferdinand von Mueller. The goldfields discovered by Daintree played an important part in tiding North Queensland over the collapse of the pastoral boom in the late 1860s although only the Etheridge deposit proved viable in the longer term. However, his work proved crucial to attracting prospectors to North Queensland which led to other discoveries and the early development of the area's gold resources. Return to England Richard Daintree was appointed as commissioner in charge of Queensland's display at the 1871 Exhibition of Art and Industry in London. His collections of photographs and geological specimens formed the basis of Queensland's stand at the Exhibition despite the fact that much of his work was lost when the ship carrying Daintree, his family and the display was wrecked in South Africa. Despite this significant setback, the display made a favourable impression due to his photographs. The Australian colonies were all keen to make a good impression as the Exhibitions were well attended by both potential investors and prospective migrants. Daintree soon established himself as an effective representative of Queensland at the Exhibition. The success of the display led to Richard Daintree being appointed as Queensland's Agent-General in early 1872 replacing Archibald Archer in that position. In this position, Daintree was asked to organise participation in another six exhibitions. As Agent-General, Daintree worked with great energy stimulating assisted immigration to Queensland, travelling widely to give speeches on the colony and producing attractive handbooks featuring his photography. However, Queensland premier Arthur Macalister was disturbed about the quality of some of the new immigrants and evidence of inefficiency and possibly worse in the office. Eventually, Macalister's concerns prompted him to travel to London personally in 1875–76 to investigate the office. Daintree was found to be personally honest and hardworking, and he was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in May 1876.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/Edinburgh/issue/8684/page/318/data.pdf However, the clerks responsible for routine administration were found to have conducted various malpractices, leading to their dismissal. Daintree's health had deteriorated as well contributing to his resignation from the position. He spent two winters in the south of France trying to recover from his illnesses. However, he died of tuberculosis in Beckenham then in Kent on 20 June 1878. Daintree's photographs are one of few surviving records of early settler life in north Queensland. Ten glass plates are now in the collection of the National Museum of Australia in Canberra. It is likely that the ten glass plates in the National Museum's collection were part of Daintree's efforts to promote Queensland. Their subject matter, mainly that of miners and their living and working conditions, suggest that they may have been used to illustrate the lectures that Daintree gave across Britain to attract immigrants. The bulk of Daintree's glass plates remained in the collection of the Daintree family in England until the 1940s when most of the negatives were donated to the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, though the ten plates remained in the Daintree family collection until they were auctioned in 1982. The successful bidders at that auction then sold the plates to the National Museum in 2007.Richard Daintree's glass plates, National Museum of Australia List of Works *Daintree, R. (1863).

The song is moored to a repetitive bassline, and develops in a direction influenced by jazz. Background and recording Radiohead singer Thom Yorke wrote the \\"National Anthem\\" bassline when he was 16, and played bass on the studio recording. In 1997, Radiohead recorded drums and bass for the song, intending to develop it as a B-side for their third album, OK Computer; however, they decided to save it for their next album, Kid A (2000). Jonny Greenwood added Ondes Martenot and sampled sounds from radio stations, and Yorke's vocals were processed with a ring modulator. In November 1999, Radiohead recorded a brass section inspired by the \\"organised chaos\\" of Town Hall Concert by the jazz musician Charles Mingus. Yorke and Greenwood directed the musicians to sound like a \\"traffic jam\\"; according to Yorke, he jumped up and down so much during his conducting that he broke his foot. Yorke said: \\"the running joke when we were in the studios was, 'Just blow. Just blow, just blow, just blow.'\\" An early demo of \\"The National Anthem\\" was included in the special edition of the 2017 OK Computer reissue OKNOTOK 1997 2017. Composition The bass riff of \\"The National Anthem\\" was written and performed by Thom Yorke (pictured in 2010) The free jazz section was described as \\"a brass band marching into a brick wall\\" by one reviewer. Simon Reynolds of Spin said: \\"the song is a strange, thrilling blast of kosmik highway music — combining Hawkwind's \\"Silver Machine\\" with Can's \\"Mother Sky\\" and throwing in free-jazz bedlam for good measure\\". Cam Lindsey of Exclaim! wrote that the song is a \\"radical jazz-rock fusion\\". Critical reception The song received polarised reviews from music critics. In his review of the album for the New Yorker, Nick Hornby mentioned the song as \\"an unpleasant free-jazz workout, with a discordant horn section squalling over a studiedly crude bass line\\". Mark Beaumont, who disparaged Kid A in Melody Maker on its release, wrote ten years later that the \\"free-form jazz horns\\" of \\"The National Anthem\\" produced a \\"mingus-in-a-tumble-dryer racket\\". Lorraine Ali, writing for Newsweek, described the song as \\"annoying pileup of squawking instruments\\". Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone said the horn section \\"was a cornier-than-usual art-rock cliché, trying way too hard for a way-too-obvious gimmick\\". However, Adam Downer of Sputnikmusic said that \\"by the end of the song, you're in awe of such a jam session\\" and named it a \\"recommended track\\". In a review for a live performance of Radiohead, Siobhan Kane of The Irish Times praised the song: \\"it distills Radiohead's worldview, with those guitars and Yorke's evocative voice, all intelligence and deep emotion.\\" Cam Lindsey of Exclaim! cited it as the album's standout track. Reviewing the demo version released on OKNOTOK 1997 2017, Record Collector wrote that the song \\"could very easily have resembled the sort of latterday U2 track chosen to soundtrack Goal of the Month reels ... That Radiohead had the self-awareness to sit on it rather than go for the drive-time jugular says so much about their intuitive good taste, and the prolonged success it would bring them.\\" Live performances Radiohead has performed \\"The National Anthem\\" with a wind section in their 2000 performances in New York City (one of which was at Radiohead's taping for Saturday Night Live), a 2001 performance in London for the BBC's Later with Jools Holland, during a 2001 concert in Paris, and on The Colbert Report in 2011. Cover versions \\"The National Anthem\\" has been covered by numerous artists, including: Japanese shamisen duo Yoshida Brothers, on their album Prism; Meshell Ndegeocello, for the tribute album Exit Music: Songs with Radio Heads; Mr Russia, for the tribute album Every Machine Makes a Mistake: A Tribute to Radiohead; and Vernon Reid, for the album Other True Self. Ayurveda and Umphrey's McGee covered the song on live performances. The Jazz Passengers did an instrumental version on their album Reunited. A \\"marvellously squalling version\\" by the University of Arizona marching band was praised in the Guardian. Lupe Fiasco used a sample of the song on the mixtape Enemy of the State: A Love Story in the song \\"The National Anthem\\".

Personal history Hustvedt was born in Aberdeen, South Dakota and grew up in Radcliff, Kentucky, home of Fort Knox. He attended the University of California, Berkeley studying computer science and was later employed by the Army Security Agency. Following the ASA, Dick worked for the Xerox Corporation on the development of operating systems for their Data Systems division (Xerox DSD Development Programming in El Segundo, California), and was a principal kernel developer of the Xerox Data Systems (XDS) RAD-75, RBM-1 and CP-V operating systems. He was recruited by Ken Olsen to join Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1974. He moved from Los Angeles, California to Concord, Massachusetts where he worked at the company headquarters at \\"The Mill\\" in Maynard, Massachusetts. Married to Audrey R. Reith in 1976. Father of sons Eric Hustvedt (1978) and Marc Hustvedt (1979). On January 13, 1984, he suffered a severe head injury in an automobile accident in Acton, Massachusetts. He resided in New Hampshire at the time of his death on April 15, 2008. The OpenVMS development team, now part of Hewlett-Packard, named a conference room in his honor in Nashua, New Hampshire facility. DEC Dick Hustvedt was one of the three principal designers of VMS, along with Dave Cutler and Peter Lipman. VMS was first conceived in 1976 as the operating system for the 32-bit, virtual memory line of computers eventually named VAX. Version V1.0 shipped in 1978 and the VAX and VMS became flagship products for DEC. Hustvedt was also the driving force behind the development of DEC's VAXcluster, which was the first clustering system to achieve commercial success, and was a major selling point for VAX systems. His sense of humor is behind the fact that the TIMEPROMPTWAIT variable in VMS is famously defined in \\"microfortnights\\".

The idea of perpetual peace was first suggested in the 18th century, when Charles-Irénée Castel de Saint-Pierre published his essay \\"Project for Perpetual Peace\\" anonymously while working as the negotiator for the Treaty of Utrecht. However, the idea did not become well known until the late 18th century. The term perpetual peace became acknowledged when German philosopher Immanuel Kant published his 1795 essay Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch.Pietrzyk, Mark E.,Ph.D. \\"The Idea of a Democratic Zone of Peace: Origins in the Enlightenment\\" <>. The Kantian view and its descendants The other modern plans for a perpetual peace descend from Kant's 1795 essay, \\"Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch\\" (\\"Zum ewigen Frieden. Ein philosophischer Entwurf\\"). In this essay, Kant described his proposed peace program. Perpetual peace is arguably seen as the starting point of contemporary liberal thought. \\"Perpetual Peace\\" is structured in two parts. The Preliminary Articles described the steps that should be taken immediately, or with all deliberate speed: #\\"No secret treaty of peace shall be held valid in which there is tacitly reserved matter for a future war\\" #\\"No independent states, large or small, shall come under the dominion of another state by inheritance, exchange, purchase, or donation\\" #\\"Standing armies shall in time be totally abolished\\" #\\"National debts shall not be contracted with a view to the external friction of states\\" #\\"No state shall by force interfere with the constitution or government of another state\\" #\\"No state shall, during war, permit such acts of hostility which would make mutual confidence in the subsequent peace impossible: such are the employment of assassins (percussores), poisoners (venefici), breach of capitulation, and incitement to treason (perduellio) in the opposing state\\" Three Definitive Articles would provide not merely a cessation of hostilities, but a foundation on which to build a peace: #\\"The civil constitution of every state should be republican\\" #\\"The law of nations shall be founded on a federation of free states\\" #\\"The law of world citizenship shall be limited to conditions of universal hospitality\\" Kant's essay in some ways resembles modern democratic peace theory, though it also differs significantly from it. He speaks of republican (Republikanisch) states (rather than of democratic ones), which he defines to have representative governments, in which the legislature is separated from the executive. He does not discuss universal suffrage, which is vital to modern democracy and quite important to some modern theorists; his commentators dispute whether it is implied by his language. Most importantly, he does not regard republican governments as sufficient by themselves to produce peace: freedom of travel, though not necessarily migration, (hospitality); and a league of nations are necessary to consciously enact his six-point program. Unlike some modern theorists, Kant claims not that republics will be at peace only with each other, but are more pacific than other forms of government in general. The general idea that popular and responsible governments would be more inclined to promote peace and commerce became one current in the stream of European thought and political practice. It was one element of the American policy of George Canning and the foreign policy of Lord Palmerston. It was also represented in the liberal internationalism of Woodrow Wilson, George Creel, and H.G. Wells, although other planks in Kant's platform had even more influence. In the next generation, Kant's program was represented by the Four Freedoms and the United Nations. Kant's essay is a three-legged stool (besides the preliminary disarmament). Various projects for perpetual peace have relied on one leg – either claiming that it is sufficient to produce peace, or that it will create the other two. In 1909, Norman Angell relied only upon the second leg, arguing that modern commerce made war necessarily unprofitable, even for the technically victorious country, and therefore the possibility of successful war was The Great Illusion. James Mill had described the British Empire as outdoor relief for the upper classes; Joseph Schumpeter argued that capitalism made modern states inherently peaceful and opposed to conquest and imperialism, which economically favored the old aristocratic elites. This theory has been well developed in recent years. Mansfield and Pollins, writing in the Journal of Conflict Resolution, summarize a large body of empirical work which, for the most part, supports the thesis. There are various exceptions and qualifications which seem to limit the circumstances under which economic interdependence results in conflict reduction. On the other hand, moving beyond economic interdependence to the issue of economic freedom within states, Erik Gartzke has found empirical evidence that economic freedom (as measured by the Fraser Institute Economic Freedom Index) is about fifty times more effective than democracy in reducing violent conflict. The third leg is the old idea that a confederation of peaceable princes could produce a perpetual peace. Kant had distinguished his league from a universal state; Clarence Streit proposed, in Union Now (1938), a union of the democratic states modelled after the Constitution of the United States. He argued that trade and the peaceable ways of democracy would keep this Union perpetual, and counted on the combined power of the Union to deter the Axis from war. In \\"A Plan for an Universal and Perpetual Peace\\", part IV of Principles of International Law (1786–89), Jeremy Bentham proposed that disarmament, arbitration, and the renunciation of colonies would produce perpetual peace, thus relying merely on Kant's preliminary articles and on none of the three main points; contrary to the modern theorists, he relied on public opinion, even against the absolute monarchy in Sweden. Since 2008, the Perpetual Peace Project—a partnership between the European Union National Institutes for Culture (EUNIC), the International Peace Institute (IPI), the United Nations University, Slought Foundation, and Syracuse University—is engaging Kant's essay in an ongoing philosophical and curatorial initiative that is conceptualized around ultimately \\"re-writing\\" Kant's 1795 treatise,\\"Gregg Lambert presents the Perpetual Peace Project\\" <>. as well as a republication of the essay.Utrecht University 'Perpetual Peace Project' .

Various presenters anticipated that these new materials would soon result in revolutionary technological applications, but in the three subsequent decades, this proved to be overly optimistic. The name is a reference to the 1969 Woodstock Music and Art Festival. Before a series of breakthroughs in the mid-1980s, most scientists believed that the extremely low temperature requirements of superconductors rendered them impractical for everyday use. However, by March 1987, a flurry of recent research on ceramic superconductors had succeeded in creating ever-higher superconducting temperatures, including the discovery by the University of Houston's Paul Chu of a superconductor that operated at a temperature that could be achieved by cooling with liquid nitrogen. The scientific community was abuzz with excitement. The discoveries were so recent that no papers on them had been submitted by the deadline. However, the Society added a last-minute session to their annual meeting to discuss the new research. The session was chaired by physicist M. Brian Maple, a superconductor researcher himself, who was one of the meeting's organizers. It was scheduled to start at 7:30 pm in the Sutton ballroom of the New York Hilton, but excited scientists started lining up at 5:30. Key researchers such as Chu and Karl Alexander Müller (who would win the 1987 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work in superconductors with Georg Bednorz) were given 10 minutes to describe their research; other physicists were given five minutes. Nearly 2,000 scientists tried to squeeze into the ballroom. Those who could not find a seat filled the aisles or watched outside the room on television monitors. The session ended at 3:15 am, but many lingered until dawn to discuss the presentations. The meeting caused a surge in mainstream media interest in superconductors, and laboratories around the world raced to pursue breakthroughs in the field. By the following year (1988) two new families of copper-oxide superconductorsthe bismuth based or so-called BSCCO and the thallium based or TBCCO materialshad been discovered. Both of these have superconducting transitions above . So in the next March APS meeting at New Orleans a special evening session \\"Woodstock of Physics-II\\" was hastily organized to highlight the synthesis and properties of these new, first-ever 'triple digit superconductors'. The format of the session was same as in New York. Some of the panelists were repeats from the original \\"Woodstock\\" session. Additional researchers including Allen M. Hermann (at that time University of Arkansas), the co-discoverer of the thallium system, and Laura H. Greene (then with AT&T;) were panelists. The 1988 session was chaired by Timir Datta from the University of South Carolina. On March 5, 2007, many of the original participants reconvened in Denver to recognize and review the session on its 20-year anniversary; the \\"reunion\\" was again chaired by Maple.

He soon wished \\"to open a small bookshop and freely read the new books\\". Actively acting in the field of culture and art, Vũ Quốc Uy was suddenly arrested and put under house arrest by the French in 1944. In April 1945, he escaped from house arrest and intended to go to the liberation area in Viet Bac but was reassigned to Haiphong. After participation in an uprising in Hanoi, Vũ Quốc Uy was once again assigned to Haiphong and gathered the forced and raised in army to seize power on August 23, 1945. As a title of a chairman of Interim Revolutionary people's committee of Haiphong, Vũ Quốc Uy declared that the old authority was overthrown and then established the Interim revolutionary people's committee of Haiphong. Then he held concurrently chairman of City defending committee. In precarious situation, Vũ Quốc Uy and other member of Haiphong Party committees made the best of great solidarity though of Ho Chi Minh in daily directing and constantly determined \\"our top task is to build a whole people's solidarity block to advance revolutionary cause successful\\". Vũ Quốc Uy was interested in building Haiphong Democratic Party committee as a member of it. After Haiphong-Kien An entered the resistance against the French forces, Vu Quoc Uy participated in inter- province Hai-Kien as a Standing member, head of disseminating and training department, and director of To Hieu Political School.

After the end of the Vietnam War, Vũ Quốc Uy was appointed vice chairman and chairman of Foreign Cultural Affairs Committee until his retirement. Concurrently he was appointed chairman of Vietnam Stamp Association. To the Party and people of Haiphong city, Vũ Quốc Uy prided on living and working 'in new hometown with heroic features'. With a confidentiality of an artist official, Vũ Quốc Uy wrote his reminiscences such as 'I came back to Haiphong in the general uprising', 'Acting under the light of cultural platform' and 'Hard days in Deo Voi', ... On the occasion of 30th anniversary of liberation of Haiphong (May 13, 1955 May 13, 1985), Vũ Quốc Uy wrote a volume of book named 'Sunrise on Cam River' to recall 500 days of Haiphong from uprising to struggling against the French colonialists (August 1945 – July 1954) and with a task of writing on sea port land such as 'nop lan Dang liem cuoi cung cho Dang bo Haiphong'. On November 19, 1994, Vũ Quốc Uy died in regret of his comrades and people of Haiphong city where he considered as his hometown with heroic features.

He and Tsui were working at Bell Labs at the time of the experiment cited by the Nobel committee. Biography Störmer was born in Frankfurt am Main, and grew up in the nearby town of Sprendlingen. After graduating from the Goetheschule in Neu-Isenburg in 1967, he enrolled in architectural engineering at the TH Darmstadt, but later moved to the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt to study physics, but since he had missed the registration period for physics, he began with a mathematics and later changed to physics, qualifying for his Diploma in the laboratory of Prof. Werner Martienssen. Here he was supervised by Prof. Eckhardt Hoenig, and worked alongside another future Nobel laureate, Gerd Binnig. Störmer moved to France to carry out his PhD research in Grenoble, working in a high-magnetic field laboratory which was run jointly between the French CNRS and the German Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research. Störmer's academic advisor was Prof. Hans-Joachim Queisser, and he was awarded a PhD by the University of Stuttgart in 1977 for his thesis on investigations of electron hole droplets subject to high magnetic fields. He also met his wife, Dominique Parchet, while working in Grenoble.

This enabled the later observation of the fractional quantum Hall effect, which was discovered by Störmer and Tsui in October 1981 in an experiment carried out in the Francis Bitter High Magnetic Field Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Within a year of the experimental discovery, Robert Laughlin was able to explain its results. Störmer, Tsui and Laughlin were jointly awarded the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work.Nobel Prize press release ReferencesExternal links * Horst L.

The allies (French, Sardinia, Ottoman, and British) landed at Eupatoria on 14 September 1854, intending to make a triumphal march to Sevastopol, the capital of the Crimea, with 50,000 men. The traverse took a year of fighting against the Russians. Major battles along the way were Alma (September 1854), Balaklava (October 1854), Inkerman (November 1854), Tchernaya (August 1855), Redan (September 1855), and, finally, Malakoff (September 1855). During the siege, the allied navy undertook six bombardments of the capital, on 17 October 1854; and on 9 April, 6 June, 17 June, 17 August, and 5 September 1855. Sevastopol is one of the classic sieges of all time. The city of Sevastopol was the home of the Tsar's Black Sea Fleet, which threatened the Mediterranean. The Russian field army withdrew before the allies could encircle it. The siege was the culminating struggle for the strategic Russian port in 1854–55 and was the final episode in the Crimean War. During the Victorian Era, these battles were repeatedly memorialized. The siege of Sevastopol was the subject of Crimean soldier Leo Tolstoy's Sebastopol Sketches and the subject of the first Russian feature film, Defence of Sevastopol. The Battle of Balaklava was made famous by Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade\\" and Robert Gibb's painting The Thin Red Line. A panorama of the siege itself was painted by Franz Roubaud. The nurses who treated the allied wounded during these battles were much celebrated, most famously Florence Nightingale and Mary Seacole. DescriptionSeptember 1854= The allies (French, Ottoman, and British) landed at Eupatoria on 14 September 1854.Orlando Figes, The Crimean War: A History (Picador Publishing: New York, 2010) p. 230. The Battle of the Alma (20 September 1854), which is usually considered the first battle of the Crimean War (1853–1856), took place just south of the River Alma in the Crimea.Orlando Figes, The Crimean War: A History, pp. 208-220. An Anglo-French force under Jacques Leroy de Saint Arnaud and FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan defeated General Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov's Russian army, which lost around 6,000 troops.Orlando Figes, The Crimean War: A History, p. 218. Moving from their base at Balaklava at the start of October, French and British engineers began to direct the building of siege lines along the Chersonese uplands to the south of Sevastopol.Orlando Figes, The Crimean War: A History, p. 236. The troops prepared redoubts, gun batteries, and trenches.Orlando Figes, The Crimean War: A History, p. 237. With the Russian army and its commander Prince Menshikov gone, the defence of Sevastopol was led by Vice Admirals Vladimir Alexeyevich Kornilov and Pavel Nakhimov, assisted by Menshikov's chief engineer, Lieutenant Colonel Eduard Totleben.Orlando Figes, The Crimean War: A History, p. 233. The military forces available to defend the city were 4,500 militia, 2,700 gunners, 4,400 marines, 18,500 naval seamen, and 5,000 workmen, totalling just over 35,000 men. The Russians began by scuttling their ships to protect the harbour, then used their naval cannon as additional artillery and the ships' crews as marines.Orlando Figes, The Crimean War: A History, p. 224. Those ships deliberately sunk by the end of 1855 included Grand Duke Constantine, City of Paris (both with 120 guns), , , , , and Yagondeid (all 84 guns), Kavarna (60 guns), Konlephy (54 guns), steam frigate Vladimir, steamboats Thunderer, Bessarabia, Danube, Odessa, Elbrose, and Krein. =October 1854= By mid-October, the Allies had some 120 guns ready to fire on Sevastopol; the Russians had about three times as many.Orlando Figes, The Crimean War: A History, p. 238. On 5 October (old style date, 17 October new style) the artillery battle began.Orlando, Figes, The Crimean War: A History, p. 238. The Russian artillery first destroyed a French magazine, silencing their guns. British fire then set off the magazine in the Malakoff redoubt, killing Admiral Kornilov, silencing most of the Russian guns there, and leaving a gap in the city's defences. However, the British and French withheld their planned infantry attack, and a possible opportunity for an early end to the siege was missed. At the same time, to support the Allied land forces, the Allied fleet pounded the Russian defences and shore batteries. Six screw- driven ships of the line and 21 wooden sail were involved in the sea bombardment (11 British, 14 French, and two Ottoman Turkish). After a bombardment that lasted over six hours, the Allied fleet inflicted little damage on the Russian defences and coastal artillery batteries while suffering 340 casualties among the fleet. Two of the British warships were so badly damaged that they were towed to the arsenal in Constantinople for repairs and remained out of action for the remainder of the siege, while most of the other warships also suffered serious damage due to many direct hits from the Russian coastal artillery. The bombardment resumed the following day, but the Russians had worked through the night and repaired the damage. This pattern would be repeated throughout the siege. =November 1854= In late October and early November, the battles of Balaclava and Inkerman took place beyond the siege lines. Balaclava gave the Russians a morale boost and convinced them that the Allied lines were thinly spread out and undermanned.Orlaando Figes, The Crimean War: A History, p. 254. But after their defeat at Inkerman,Frederick Engels, \\" The Battle of Inkerman\\" published on 27 November 1854 in the New York Herald and carried in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13, pp. 528-535 the Russians saw that the siege of Sevastopol would not be lifted by a battle in the field, so instead they moved troops into the city to aid the defenders. Toward the end of November, a winter storm ruined the Allies' camps and supply lines. Men and horses sickened and starved in the poor conditions. While Totleben extended the fortifications around the Redan bastion and the Malakoff redoubt, British chief engineer John Fox Burgoyne sought to take the Malakoff, which he saw as the key to Sevastopol. Siege works were begun to bring the Allied troops nearer to the Malakoff; in response, Totleben dug rifle pits from which Russian troops could snipe at the besiegers. In a foretaste of the trench warfare that became the hallmark of the First World War, the trenches became the focus of Allied assaults. =1855= Siege of Sevastopol The Allies were able to restore many supply routes when winter ended. The new Grand Crimean Central Railway, built by the contractors Thomas Brassey and Samuel Morton Peto, which had been completed at the end of March 1855Orlando Figes, The Crimean War: A History, p. 356. was now in use bringing supplies from Balaclava to the siege lines. The 24 mile long railroad delivered more than five hundred guns and plentiful ammunition. The Allies resumed their bombardment on 8 April (Easter Sunday). On 28 June (10 July), Admiral Nakhimov died from a head wound inflicted by an Allied sniper.Orlando Figes, The Crimean War: A History, p. 378. On 24 August (5 September) the Allies started their sixth and the most severe bombardment of the fortress. Three hundred and seven cannon fired 150,000 rounds, with the Russians suffering 2,000 to 3,000 casualties daily. On 27 August (8 September), thirteen Allied divisions and one Allied brigade (total strength 60,000) began the last assault. The British assault on the Great Redan failed, but the French, under General Mac-Mahon, managed to seize the Malakoff redoubt and the Little Redan, making the Russian defensive position untenable. By the morning of 28 August (9 September), the Russian forces had abandoned the southern side of Sevastopol. Although defended heroically and at the cost of heavy Allied casualties, the fall of Sevastopol would lead to the Russian defeat in the Crimean War. Most of the Russian casualties were buried in Brotherhood cemetery in over 400 collective graves. The three main commanders (Nakhimov, Kornilov, and Istomin) were interred in the purpose-built Admirals' Burial Vault.

These were taken from Sevastopol as trophies at the end of the siege of Sevastopol The British sent cannons seized at Sevastopol to many towns in Britain, and several important cities across the Empire.However, there has been controversy about the fate of two cannons that were sent to Halifax, West Yorkshire. As they were removed from a local park and sold for scrap. \\"Two 1799 Russian 24 Pdrs. Watch The St. Lawrence River In Quebec\\"\\"The Russian SBML 18-pr at Waiouru\\" , Royal New Zealand Artillery Association Additionally, several were sent to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. These cannon are now all kept at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst (renamed after the closing of RMA Woolwich shortly after the Second World War) and are displayed in front of Old College, next to cannon from Waterloo and other battles. Many of the cannon sent to towns in Britain were melted down during the Second World War to help the war effort, though several of these have subsequently been replaced by replicas. The cascabel (the large ball at the rear of old muzzle-loaded guns) of several cannon captured during the siege was said to have been used to make the British Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the British Armed Forces. However, Hancocks, the manufacturer, confirms that the metal is Chinese, not Russian, bronze. The cannons used are in the Firepower Museum in Woolwich and are clearly Chinese. There would be no reason why Chinese cannon would be in Sevastopol in the 1850s and it is likely that the VC guns were, in fact, British trophies from the China war in the 1840s held in the Woolwich repository. Though it had been suggested that the VCs should be made from Sevastopol cannons, it seems that in practice, they were not. Testing of medals which proved not to be of Russian bronze has given rise to stories that some Victoria Crosses were made of low grade material at certain times but this is not so – all Victoria Crosses have been made from the same metal from the start. Components of the 1861 Guards Crimean War Memorial by John Bell, in Waterloo Place, St James's, London, were made from melted down Sevastopol cannons.

The classic lineup of vocalist Kyosuke Himuro, guitarist Tomoyasu Hotei, bassist Tsunematsu Matsui, and drummer Makoto Takahashi reached legendary status in Japan during the 1980s. In 1988, the year they broke up, they became the first male artists to have three number-one albums within a single year on the Oricon chart. They were named Artist of the Year at the 3rd annual Japan Gold Disc Awards in 1989. The 1990s Band Boom in Japan was credited to Boøwy as they popularized the formation of musical groups. In 2003, HMV Japan ranked Boøwy at number 22 on their list of the \\"100 Most Important Japanese Pop Acts\\". History1980–1982: Early years and debut= In 1979, Kyosuke Himuro was in a band called Death Penalty which won a music contest held in his hometown of Takasaki in Gunma Prefecture. In that same contest was Tomoyasu Hotei's band Blue Film, which came in second place. After the contest, Death Penalty signed with the record company Being Inc. and went to Tokyo. Things did not go as well as expected and they broke up. Himuro then joined Spinach Power, but he had problems with them as well and decided to form another band after seeing an RC Succession concert in 1980. Around the same time, Hotei was in Tokyo after being expelled from high school for saying \\"Jesus had long hair\\" when his teacher warned him about his hair being too long. He received a phone call from Himuro and, even though they did not really know each other, they decided to start a band called . In September, they recruited Tsunematsu Matsui on bass, Atsushi Moroboshi from Death Penalty on guitar, and Kazuaki Fukazawa from Blue Film on saxophone. Mamoru Kimura from Spinach Power agreed to drum for them in 1981. They landed a gig once a month at the Shinjuku Loft, but it did not pay the bills. To earn a living they started working part-time jobs and sent demo tapes to various record companies. They finally signed with the record company Victor and began recording their first album. In May 1981, Kimura left Bōi, as he originally joined the band on a temporary basis. He would later collaborate with the group again when he co-produced their second album, 1983's Instant Love. Makoto Takahashi was brought to the Loft by a friend to watch Bōi perform on May 11. He was impressed and tried out for the band when he heard they needed a new drummer. During the summer of that year he replaced Kimura on drums and Bōi went on to become the most popular bands at the Loft. The band's logotype, used since 1985. In January 1982, they changed their name to Boøwy and on March 21 released their first album, Moral. At this time they were a punk rock type band. For their concert in Shibuya on September 9, Hotei wanted to take a different approach to their music and become more pop sounding, but the fans did not like the change. Fukazawa and Moroboshi mirrored the opinions of the fans and on October 9, after their performance at the Loft, they left the band and Boøwy became a quartet. =1983–1988: Success and breakup= In 1983, they cut ties with their production company and formed their own company φ-connection with Mamoru Tsuchiya, former member of Blue Film, as their manager. At the time, this was unheard of and frowned upon in the music industry, so the record company stopped promoting them and people started to forget Boøwy existed. Tsuchiya faced an uphill battle in promoting them; with no funds, he gathered hand-made flyers, posters, character goods, the musical instruments and the band in an old Toyota HiAce with no AC and went on a trip around Japan looking for places to perform. In September, they released their second album Instant Love on Tokuma Japan. Boøwy in 1985. (l-r) Takahashi, Matsui, Himuro, Hotei In 1984, they continued touring live houses for more exposure. Eventually it paid off and they started getting offers from different record companies. Not wanting to go through the same hardship they faced in 1983 they decided to sign with the production company Yui, and signed to Toshiba EMI. In July they began the Beat Emotion tour, which lasted until December. The band then took a six-month break from touring. Boøwy performed in London, England, at the Marquee Club on March 12, 1985. Their self-titled third album was released in June 1985. They started the Boøwy's Be Ambitious Tour in September, and it ran until December 1985. 1986 saw the band release two studio albums, Just a Hero in March and Beat Emotion in November. The Just a Hero Tour began in March and finished on July 2. While the Rock'n Roll Circus Tour started in November 1986 and ran until February 1987. The single \\"Marionette\\" was released on July 22, 1987, took the number one position and sold 230,000 copies, making it the 20th best-selling single of the year. The band held a concert called Case of Boøwy in the Yokohama Cultural Gymnasium, in Kanagawa and in Kobe, Hyogo on July 31 and August 7, 1987, where they played most of their songs from their debut to the present for four hours straight. They released what would be their final studio album, Psychopath, on September 5. At a concert at Shibuya Public Hall on December 24, 1987, the end of their Dr. Feelman's Psychopathic Hearts Club Band Tour which began in September, Boøwy announced that they would be breaking up. There are many rumors concerning the breakup, but the most popular is the rift between Hotei and Himuro. An indication of the band's stature at the time, is that at their farewell concerts, appropriately titled Last Gigs; two nights at the newly opened Tokyo Dome on April 4 and 5, 1988; they sold out all 95,000 tickets in ten minutes. =1989–present: Post-breakup= In 1989, Boøwy were named Artist of the Year at the 3rd annual Japan Gold Disc Awards. The band has had several number ones since disbanding, including; their Singles collection (1988), 1998's This Boøwy which sold over 1.4 million copies to be certified Million by the RIAJ, and the 2001 DVD of their final concerts. On February 1, 2012, Hotei performed a concert at the Saitama Super Arena to celebrate his 50th birthday. Takahashi appeared as a special guest and together they played Boøwy's \\"Justy\\" and \\"No. New York\\". This was the first time the two performed together in 24 years. To celebrate Boøwy's 30th anniversary, the compilation album Boøwy The Best \\"Story\\" was released on March 21, 2013. It contains 32 tracks, including the song \\"Cloudy Heart\\", which received the most votes in a poll. The documentary and concert film 1224 Film the Movie 2013 opened in theaters nationwide two days later. Hotei, Takahashi and Matsui recorded the song \\"Thanks a Lot\\" for Hotei's 2019 album Guitarhythm VI. This was the first time the three had played together in 31 years. Legacy In 1988, the year they broke up, Boøwy became the first male artists to have three number-one albums within a single year on the Oricon chart. They were named Artist of the Year at the 3rd annual Japan Gold Disc Awards in 1989. The 1990s \\"Band Boom\\" in Japan was credited to Boøwy as they popularized the formation of musical groups, which caused musical instrument sales to hit an all-time high during the 1990s, leading record companies to sign and debut 80 bands during the 1990s in hopes of finding a new Boøwy. In 2003, HMV Japan ranked Boøwy at number 22 on their list of the \\"100 Most Important Japanese Pop Acts\\". In September 2007, Rolling Stone Japan rated their album Just a Hero at number 75 on its list of the \\"100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time\\". Their album Beat Emotion was named number 5 on Bounces 2009 list of \\"54 Standard Japanese Rock Albums\\". In a 2012 poll by Recochoku, Boøwy were ranked the number one band that people wanted to see reunite. With the release of Boøwy The Best \\"Story\\" in 2013, Boøwy became the second band ever, and first Japanese, to reach number one over 20 years after they broke up. The Beatles being the first. In 2017, Hotei suggested that with their spiky hair and heavy make-up Boøwy might have been the first visual kei band. Having always been conscious of visuals and influenced by David Bowie, he explained that \\"I too wanted to create something extraordinary and by wearing make-up, I felt like I had another identity. I thought by adding some fantasy to rock music, it would create more depth in the music.\\" Members * – lead vocals * – guitar, keyboards, backing vocals * – bass guitar * – drums Former members * – drums (1981) * – saxophone, backing vocals (1981–1982) * – guitar (1981–1982) =Members timeline= ImageSize = width:900 height:250 PlotArea = left:100 bottom:60 top:0 right:50 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy Period = from:05/01/1981 till:04/05/1988 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Colors = id:Vocals value:Red legend:Vocals id:Lead_Guitar value:Green legend:Lead_Guitar id:Rhythm_Guitar value:BrightGreen legend:Rhythm_Guitar id:Bass value:Blue legend:Bass id:Sax value:Purple legend:Saxophone id:Drums value:Orange legend:Drums id:Lines value:black legend:Studio_albums id:grid1 value:gray(0.3) id:Tours value:gray(0.5) Legend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom ScaleMajor = unit:year increment:1 start:1982 LineData = at:03/21/1982 color:black layer:back at:09/25/1983 color:black layer:back at:06/21/1985 color:black layer:back at:03/01/1986 color:black layer:back at:11/08/1986 color:black layer:back at:09/05/1987 color:black layer:back PlotData= width:10 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) bar:Kyosuke Himuro from:05/01/1981 till:04/05/1988 color:Vocals bar:Tomoyasu Hotei from:05/01/1981 till:04/05/1988 color:Lead_Guitar bar:Atsushi Moroboshi from:05/01/1981 till:10/09/1982 color:Rhythm_Guitar bar:Tsunematsu Matsui from:05/01/1981 till:04/05/1988 color:Bass bar:Kazuaki Fukazawa from:05/01/1981 till:10/09/1982 color:Sax bar:Mamoru Kimura from:05/01/1981 till:06/01/1981 color:Drums bar:Makoto Takahashi from:06/01/1981 till:04/05/1988 color:Drums DiscographyStudio albums= *Moral (March 21, 1982), Oricon Albums Chart Peak Position: No. 2 (1989 re-release)ＢＯΦＷＹのアルバム売り上げランキング Oricon.

Life He was born at Le Malzieu-Ville, Lozère, educated at the Prytanée National Militaire and St Cyr, and entered the army as sub-lieutenant of foot in 1824. He served with distinction in Algeria between 1841 and 1848, becoming lieutenant-colonel and an officer of the Legion of Honour; took part in the Roman campaigns of 1848 and 1849, and was made colonel. He served as general of brigade throughout the Crimean War of 1854-56, being promoted general of division and commander of the Legion of Honour. During the campaign in Lombardy in 1859 he commanded at Marseilles, and superintended the despatch of men and stores to the seat of war, and for his services he was made a grand officer of the Legion of Honour. Placed on the reserve list in 1869, he was recalled to the Marseilles command on the outbreak of the Franco-German War of 1870-71. After the first capture of Orléans by the Germans, he was appointed by the Government of National Defense, in November 1870, to the command of the Army of the Loire (notwithstanding his monarchist and catholic beliefs). He was at first very successful against von der Tann-Rathsamhausen, winning the battle of Coulmiers and compelling the Germans to evacuate Orléans, but the capitulation of Metz had set free additional German troops to oppose him, and, after his defeat at Beaune la Rolande and subsequent unsuccessful fighting near Orléans, resulting in its recapture by the Germans in December, Aurelle retreated into the Sologne and was superseded. After the government surrendered to Prussia in January 1871, General Paladines was appointed as head of the National Guard, whose members deeply resented having him as their commander. After the armistice he was elected to the National Assembly by the departments both of Allier and Gironde. He sat for Allier as a member of the Centre gauche parliamentary group and was one of the fifteen officers chosen to assist in the peace negotiations. He was decorated with the grand cross of the Legion of Honour, and was given the command at Bordeaux, but retired in 1872. Elected a life senator in 1875, he supported the monarchical majority of 1876. He died at Versailles in 1877. He was the author of La Première Armée de la Loire, published in 1872.

He was born in Lutsk, Volhynia, then lived in Lithuania, and finally settled in Çufut Qale, Crimea. Gabriel Firkovich of Troki was his son-in-law.  Biography  Abraham Firkovich was born in 1787 into a Crimean Karaite farming family in the Lutsk district of Volhynia, then part of the Russian Empire, now Ukraine. In 1818 he was serving the local Crimean Karaite communities as a junior hazzan, or religious leader, and from there he went on to the city of Eupatoria in Crimea. In 1822, he moved to the Karaite community in Gozleve, and he was appointed as hazan, or community leader, in 1825.https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Firkovich_Avraam_Samuilovich Together with the Karaite noble Simha Babovich, he sent memoranda to the Czar, with proposals to relieve Karaites from the heavy taxes imposed on the Jewish community.https://ibid In 1828 he moved to Berdichev, where he met many Hasidism and learned more about their interpretations of Jewish Scriptures based on the Talmud and rabbinic tradition. The encounter with Rabbinical Jews brought Firkovich into conflict with them. He published a book, \\"Massah and Meribah\\" (Yevpatoria, 1838) which argued against the predominant Jewish halakha of the Rabbinites.http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6134-firkovich-abraham- b-samuel-aben-reshef In 1830 he visited Jerusalem, where he collected many Jewish manuscripts.https://ibid On his return he remained for two years in Constantinople, as a teacher in the Karaite community there. He then went to Crimea and organized a society to publish old Karaite works, of which several appeared in Yevpatoria (Koslov) with comments by him.https://ibid In 1838 he was the teacher of the children of Sima Babovich, the head of the Russian Crimean Karaites, who one year later recommended him to Count Vorontzov and to the Historical Society of Odessa as a suitable man to send to collect material for the history of the Crimean Karaites. In 1839, Firkovich began excavations in the ancient cemetery of Çufut Qale, and unearthed many old tombstones, claiming that some of them dated from the first centuries of the common era. The following two years were spent in travels through the Caucasus, where he ransacked the genizot of the old Jewish communities and collected many valuable manuscripts. He went as far as Derbent, and returned in 1842. In later years he made other journeys of the same nature, visiting Egypt and other countries. In Odessa he became the friend of Bezalel Stern and of Simchah Pinsker, and while residing in Wilna he made the acquaintance of Samuel Joseph Fuenn and other Hebrew scholars. In 1871 he visited the small Karaite community in Halych, Galicia, where he introduced several reforms. From there he went to Vienna, where he was introduced to Count Beust and also made the acquaintance of Adolph Jellinek. He returned to pass his last days in Çufut Qale, of which there now remain only a few buildings and many ruins. However, Firkovich's house is still preserved in the site. Firkovich collected a vast number of Hebrew, Arabic and Samaritan manuscripts during his many travels in his search for evidence concerning the traditions of his people.https://ibid These included thousands of Jewish documents from throughout the Russian Empire in what became known as the First Firkovich Collection. His Second Collection contains material collected from the Near East. His visit took place about thirty years before Solomon Schechter's more famous trip to Egypt. This \\"Second Firkovich Collection\\" contains 13,700 items and is of incredible value. As a result of his research he became focused on the origin of the ancestors of the Crimean Karaites who he claimed had arrived in Crimea before the common era.https://ibid The Karaites, therefore, could not be seen as culpable for the crucifixion of Jesus because they had settled in Crimea at such an early date. His theories persuaded the Russian imperial court that Crimean Karaites cannot be accused in Jesus' Crucifixion and they were excluded from the restrictive measures against Jews. Many of his findings were disputed immediately after his death, and despite their important value there is still controversy over many of the documents he collected. The Russian National Library purchased the Second Firkovich Collection in 1876, a little more than a year after Firkovich's death.http://ibid Among the treasures in the Firkovich collection is a manuscript of the Garden of Metaphors, an aesthetic appreciation of Biblical literature written in Judeo- Arabic by one of the greatest of the Sephardi poets, Moses ibn Ezra.ibid Firkovich's life and works are of great importance to Karaite history and literature. His collections at the Russian National Library are important to biblical scholars and to historians, especially those of the Karaite and Samaritan communities. Controversy continues regarding his alleged discoveries and the reliability of his works.  Works  Firkovich's chief work is his \\"Abne Zikkaron,\\" containing the texts of inscriptions discovered by him (Wilna, 1872). It is preceded by a lengthy account of his travels to Daghestan, characterized by Strack as a mixture of truth and fiction. His other works are \\"Ḥotam Toknit,\\" antirabbinical polemics, appended to his edition of the \\"Mibḥar Yesharim\\" by Aaron the elder (Koslov, 1835); \\"Ebel Kabod,\\" on the death of his wife and of his son Jacob (Odessa, 1866); and \\"Bene Reshef\\", essays and poems, published by Peretz Smolenskin (Vienna, 1871). Collections Abraham Firkovich collected several distinct collections of documents. In sum the Firkovich collection contains approximately 15,000 items; of which many are fragmentary. =The Odessa Collection= This collection contains material from the Crimea and the Caucasus. It was largely collected between 1839 and 1840, but with additions from Firkovich as late as 1852. It was originally owned by the Odessa Society of History and Antiquities and was stored in the Odessa museum. Some of these documents deteriorated due to chemical treatment performed by Firkovich. Other documents which were suspected forgeries disappeared; Firkovich claimed they had been stolen. The collection was moved to the Imperial Public Library in 1863. In 1844 the Russian historian Arist Kunik, a leading anti-Normanist, and Bezalel Stern, an influential Russian Maskil, would study and partly describe the discovery. Briefly stated, the discoveries include the major part of the manuscripts described in Pinner's \\"Prospectus der Odessaer Gesellschaft für Geschichte und Alterthum Gehörenden Aeltesten Hebräischen und Rabbinischen Manuscripte\\" (Odessa, 1845), a rather rare work which is briefly described in \\"Literaturblatt des Orients\\" for 1847, No. 2. These manuscripts consist of: *Fifteen scrolls of the Law, with postscripts which give, in Karaite fashion, the date and place of writing, the name of the writer or corrector or other interesting data. *Twenty copies of books of the Bible other than the Pentateuch, some complete, others fragmentary, of one of which, the Book of Habakkuk, dated 916, a facsimile is given. *Nine numbers of Talmudical and rabbinical manuscripts. =The First Collection= Contains material from the Crimea and the Caucasus largely collected between 1839 and 1841. It was purchased by the Imperial Public Library in 1862. =The Samaritan Collection= Another collection of 317 Samaritan manuscripts, acquired in Nablus, arrived in the St. Petersburg Imperial Academy in 1867 (see Fürst, \\"Geschichte des Karäerthums\\", iii. pp. 176, Leipsic, 1869) In 1864 Firkovich acquired a large collection of Samaritan documents in Nablus. He sold the documents to the Imperial Public Library in 1870. In sum the collection contains 1,350 items. =The Second Collection= Contains material collected from the Near East. The material was collected between 1863 and 1865. Firkovich collected in Jerusalem, Aleppo and also in Cairo. Firkovich concealed where he obtained the documents. He possibly collected from the Cairo Geniza thirty years before Solomon Schechter discovered it. Firkovich sold this collection to the Imperial Public Library in 1873. Forgery Accusations Firkovich has come to be regarded as a forger, acting in support of Karaite causes. He wished to eliminate any connection between Rabbinic Judaism and the Karaites by declaring that the Karaites were descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes. Firkovich successfully petitioned the Russian government to exempt the Karaites from anti-Jewish laws on the grounds that Karaites had immigrated to Europe before the crucifixion of Jesus and thus could not be held responsible for his death. S. L. Rapoport has pointed out some impossibilities in the inscriptions (Ha-Meliẓ, 1861, Nos. 13-15, 37); A. Geiger in his Jüdische Zeitschrift (1865, p. 166), Schorr in He-Ḥaluẓ, and A. Neubauer in the Journal Asiatique (1862–63) and in his Aus der Petersburger Bibliothek (Leipzig, 1866) have challenged the correctness of the facts and the theories based upon them which Jost, Julius Fürst, and Heinrich Grätz, in their writings on the Karaites, took from Pinsker's Liḳḳuṭe Ḳadmoniyyot, in which the data furnished by Firkovich were unhesitatingly accepted. Further exposures were made by Strack and Harkavy (St. Petersburg, 1875) in the Catalog der Hebr. Bibelhandschriften der Kaiserlichen Oeffentlichen Bibliothek in St. Petersburg; in Harkavy's Altjüdische Denkmäler aus der Krim (ib. 1876); in Strack's A. Firkowitsch und Seine Entdeckungen (Leipsic, 1876); in Fränkel's Aḥare Reshet le-Baḳḳer (Ha-Shaḥar, vii.646 et seq.); in Deinard's Massa' Ḳrim (Warsaw, 1878); and in other places. In contradiction, Firkovich's most sympathetic critic, Chwolson, gives as a résumé of his belief, after considering all controversies, that Firkovich succeeded in demonstrating that some of the Jewish tombstones from Chufut-Kale date back to the seventh century, and that seemingly modern forms of eulogy and the method of counting after the era of creation were in vogue among Jews much earlier than had been hitherto suspected. Chwolson alone defended him, but he also was forced to admit that in some cases Firkovich had resorted to forgery. In his Corpus Inscriptionum Hebraicarum (St. Petersburg, 1882; Russian ed., ib. 1884) Chwolson attempts to prove that the Firkovich collection, especially the epitaphs from tombstones, contains much which is genuine. In 1980, V. V. Lebedev investigated the Firkovich collection and came to the conclusion that forgery cannot be attributed to Firkovich, but rather it was done by the previous owners, in an attempt to increase the price of the manuscripts.Лебедев В. В. К источниковедческой оценке некоторых рукописей собрания А. С. Фирковича.// Палестинский сборник. — Л., 1987. Вып. 29 (история и филология). — С. 61.) For many years the manuscripts were not available to Western scholars. The extent of Firkovich’s forgeries is still being determined. Firkovich’s materials require careful examination on a case by case basis. His collection remains of great value to scholars of Jewish studies.

Woltjer, the son of a baker, started his career as an assistant teacher at a high school in his hometown of Groningen in 1867. He taught himself Latin and managed to enter the University of Groningen in 1871. While teaching classical languages at a local gymnasium, he wrote his dissertation on Lucretius and was promoted in 1877. On 28 September that year he married Marchien Janssonius. In 1881 he moved to Amsterdam to become professor at the Free University, which position he would keep until his death in 1917. In 1902 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was involved in many educational organizations and was a member of the Senate for the Anti Revolutionaire Partij from 1902 to 1917. His oldest son, Robert H. Woltjer, would follow him teaching classical studies at the Free University. His son Jan Woltjer Jr would become a well-known astronomer. Along his many other students, including Herman Dooyeweerd, Woltjer had a formidable influence on future professor of philosophy, D. H. Th. Vollenhoven, who used his training in Greek and Latin to make first of all a minutely detailed study of the Fragments of the Presocratics. Woltjers subscribed to the idea that Greek learning was an integral part of what the New Testament refers to when it speaks of \\"the fulness of times.\\" The Greek learned constituted a preparatory education (paideia, cf Werner Jaeger) for the coming of Christ. To some extent, Woltjer's student Vollenhoven seems to have resisted this latter conception, as V came to view the major problem of developing a Christian philosophy to be the heavy tendency of all subsequent Christian thought in Western culture to fall back on a synthesis with Greek- originated presuppositions.

Goolagong was originally 22,400 acres on which Sheahan ran cattle. The Robertson Land Act of 1861 ended pastoral leases and opened the land to freeholders. With the advent of new settlers a town soon became established. Devastated after a severe flood the town was re-established a little further, and higher to the east.

There were sizeable stocks of \\"Red Cedar\\" near the Daintree River. Loggers moved stock down the river to the coast for transport using lashed rafts. Dairy farms were later established allowing a butter factory to be opened in 1924. Beef farming later became a significant local employer. As elsewhere in Queensland, tourism has become an important employer. Daintree Village became famous for early morning tours on the Daintree River and became very popular with visiting birdwatchers. These dawn river trips became a catalyst for the many B&B;'s that sprung up starting in 1993 and became an important employer of local families. Red Mill House, Daintree Village was the first B&B; in the Douglas Shire in 1993 and paved the way for many others to follow. Queensland's Wet Tropics became world heritage listed in 1986. Daintree is part of the wet tropics and the most famous national park close to the tourism hub of Port Douglas.http://www.wettropics.gov.au/wet-tropics- world-heritage-values  Education  Daintree State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at Osborne Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 15 students with 2 teachers (1 full-time equivalent) and 5 non-teaching staff (2 full-time equivalent).

Gygax developed the core medieval system of the game by expanding on rules authored by his fellow Lake Geneva Tactical Studies Association (LGTSA) member Perren, a hobby-shop owner with whom he had become friendly. Guidon Games released the first edition of Chainmail in 1971 as its first miniature wargame and one of its three debut products. Early history Origins = In 1967, Henry Bodenstedt created the medieval wargame Siege of Bodenburg, which was designed for use with 40mm miniatures. Gary Gygax first encountered Siege of Bodenburg at Gen Con I (1968), and played the game during that convention. The rules for Siege of Bodenburg had been published in Strategy & Tactics magazine, and Jeff Perren developed his own medieval rules based on those, and shared them with Gary Gygax. The original set of medieval miniatures rules by Jeff Perren were just four pages in length. Gygax edited and expanded these rules, which were published as \\"Geneva Medieval Miniatures\\", in Panzerfaust magazine (April 1970), using 1:20 figure scale. The rules were again revised, and then self-published in the newsletter of the Castle & Crusade Society, The Domesday Book, as the \\"LGTSA Miniatures Rules\\", in issue #5 (July 1970), using 1:10 figure scale. Later issues of The Domesday Book would introduce a rule system for man-to-man combat at 1:1 figure scale, and a rule system for jousting. = 1st edition = Gary Gygax met Don Lowry at Gen Con III (1970), and Gygax later signed with Lowry when he founded Guidon Games to produce a series of rules called \\"Wargaming with Miniatures\\". The first game published was a further expansion of the medieval rules, published as Chainmail. Along with the previous medieval rules, Chainmail included a 14-page \\"fantasy supplement\\" including figures such as heroes, superheroes, and wizards. The fantasy supplement also included mythical creatures such as elves, orcs, and dragons. The fantasy supplement also referenced the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, Robert E. Howard, Poul Anderson, and Michael Moorcock. First edition Chainmail saw print in March 1971. It quickly became Guidon Games' biggest hit, selling one hundred copies per month. The Chainmail cover art of a fighting crusader was inspired by a Jack Coggins illustration from his book The Fighting Man: An Illustrated History of the World's Greatest Fighting Forces. Both Perrin and Gygax \\"swiped\\" Coggin's artwork to illustrate their preliminary articles about Chainmail that appeared in Panzerfaust and The Domesday Book. When Don Lowry of Guidon Games agreed to publish Chainmail, Lowry swiped the same Coggins illustration for the cover. For the fantasy supplement, the illustration of a mounted knight charging towards a dragon, was drawn by Don Lowry, based heavily on an illustration by Pauline Baynes for J. R. R. Tolkien's Farmer Giles of Ham (1949). = 2nd edition = Guidon Games published Chainmail second edition in 1972. = 3rd edition = TSR eventually purchased the rights to some of the back catalog of Guidon Games, and published Chainmail as their own product. Rule systems Chainmail session at Gary Con II Chainmail session at Gary Con IV Moathouse detail and miniatures = Mass combat = A set of mass-combat rules, heavily indebted to the medieval systems of Tony Bath and intended for a 1:20 figure scale. These developed from the Lake Geneva medieval system originally published in Panzerfaust and in Domesday Book #5. In these rules, each figure represents twenty men. Troops are divided into six basic types: light foot, heavy foot, armored foot, light horse, medium horse, and heavy horse. Melee is resolved by rolling six-sided dice: for example, when heavy horse is attacking light foot, the attacker is allowed to roll four dice per figure, with each five or six denoting a kill. On the other hand, when light foot is attacking heavy horse, the attacker is allowed only one die per four figures, with a six denoting a kill. Additional rules govern missile and artillery fire, movement and terrain, charging, fatigue, morale, and the taking of prisoners. = Man- to-man combat = A set of man-to-man combat rules (for 1:1 figure scale), ultimately deriving from a contribution to Domesday Book #7. Gygax lost the name of the contributor, and thus the rules were published anonymously. The core of these rules became the Appendix B chart mapping various weapon types to armor levels, and providing the needed to-hit rolls for a melee round. The man-to-man melee uses two six-sided dice (2d6) to determine whether a kill is made. = Jousting = A set of jousting rules, which derive from the Castle & Crusade Society jousting rules published in Domesday Book #6, and reprinted in Domesday Book #13. These rules were originally designed for postal play; members of the C&CS; could participate in jousting tourneys in order to raise their standing in the Society. Dungeons & Dragons refers to jousting matches utilizing the Chainmail rules. = Fantasy supplement = The core of these rules is the Appendix E chart showing the die rolls needed for various fantastic types to defeat one another in battle. Gygax wanted to capture the sort of swashbuckling action of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian books in a wargame. Shortly before the publication of Chainmail, Gygax wrote to Wargamer's Newsletter describing his intention to add \\"rules for Tolkien fantasy games\\" to his medieval miniatures rules, including rules for balrogs, hobbits, trolls, giants and dragons. The first edition Chainmail fantasy supplement added such concepts as elementals, magic swords, and archetypal spells such as \\"Fireball\\", \\"Lightning Bolt\\" and six other spells. Borrowing a concept from Tony Bath, some figure types may make saving throws to resist spell effects; a stronger wizard can cancel the spell of a weaker wizard by rolling a seven or higher with two six-sided dice. Creatures were divided between Law and Chaos, drawing on the alignment philosophies of Poul Anderson, as popularized by Michael Moorcock's Elric series. When fighting mundane units, each of the fantasy creatures is treated as one of the six basic troop types. For example, hobbits are treated as light foot and elves are treated as heavy foot. Heroes are treated as four heavy footmen, and require four simultaneous hits to kill; Super-Heroes are twice as powerful. Use with Dungeons & Dragons In the July 1978 issue of The Dragon, Gary Gygax wrote that for the first two years of Dungeons & Dragons, players played primarily without the use of any miniature figures. If visual aids were needed, then the players would draw pictures, or use dice or tokens as placeholders. By 1976, there was a movement among players to add the use of miniatures to represent individual player characters. In 1976, Swords & Spells was added as a rules supplement for Dungeons & Dragons, to provide fantasy mass combat rules for the game at 1:10 and 1:1 scale. In the foreword, Tim Kask describes Swords & Spells as the \\"grandson\\" of Chainmail. In the introduction to the game, Gygax writes that the Chainmail fantasy supplement assumed man-to-man combat, and rules for \\"large-scale\\" fantasy battles were missing, so Swords & Spells was developed to cover 1:10 and 1:1 ratio fantasy battles.

Biography Buss earned his PhD in psychology at University of California, Berkeley in 1981. Before becoming a professor at the University of Texas, he was assistant professor for four years at Harvard University and a professor at the University of Michigan for eleven years. The primary topics of his research include male mating strategies, conflict between the sexes, social status, social reputation, prestige, the emotion of jealousy, homicide, anti-homicide defenses, and—most recently—stalking. All of these are approached from an evolutionary perspective. Buss is the author of more than 200 scientific articles and has won many awards, including an APA Distinguished Scientific Award for Early Career Contribution to Psychology in 1988 and an APA G. Stanley Hall Lectureship in 1990. Buss is the author of a number of publications and books, including The Evolution of Desire, The Dangerous Passion, and The Murderer Next Door, which introduces a new theory of homicide from an evolutionary perspective. He is also the author of Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the Mind, whose fourth edition was released in 2011. In 2005, Buss edited a reference volume, The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology.Buss, David M. (2005). The handbook of evolutionary psychology. Hoboken: Wiley. His latest book is Why Women Have Sex, which he coauthored with Cindy Meston. Buss is involved with extensive cross-cultural research collaborations and lectures within the U.S. Act frequency approach Attempts to state the conditions that constitute a certain personality trait and attempts to exhaustively list all the acts that identify a bearer of a trait have not been very successful in providing exact definitions for trait-related terms (such as \\"creative\\", \\"humorous\\", and \\"ambitious\\"). The question of what exactly defines an individual as being—for example—courageous is an open one. Another difficulty is measuring how strongly a trait is pronounced in an individual. As a solution to these problems of defining and measuring traits, Buss and K. H. Craik (1980) proposed to introduce prototype theory into personality psychology.Buss, D. M., & Craik, K. H. (1980). The frequency concept of disposition: Dominance and prototypically dominant acts. Journal of Personality, 43, 379-392Buss, D. M., & Craik, K. H. (1983). The act frequency approach to personality. Psychological Review, 90, 105-126critique by Prof. Block and critique by Prof. Moser First, a group of people is asked to list acts that a person bearing the trait in question would show. Next, a different group of people is asked to name from that list those acts that are most typical for the trait. Then the measurement is conducted by counting the number of times (within a given period of time) a proband performs the typical acts. Short and long-term mating strategies One element of David Buss' research involves studying the differences in mate selection between short- term and long-term mating strategies. Individuals differ in their preferences for either a short or long-term mating strategy (i.e. whether they are looking for a \\"hook-up\\" or for a serious relationship). The Gangestad and Simpson Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (SOI) determines whether a person favors a short-term or long-term strategy (also termed as unrestricted and restricted).S.W. Gangestad, J.A. Simpson Toward an evolutionary history of female sociosexual variation Journal of Personality, 58 (1990), pp. 69–96 Higher SOI scores indicate a less restricted orientation, and thus a preference for a short-term mating strategy.L. Penke, J.B. Asendorpf Beyond global sociosexual orientations: A more differentiated look at sociosexuality and its effects on courtship and romantic relationships Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 95 (2008), pp. 1113–1135 David Buss and colleagues conducted a study that attempted to uncover where priorities lie—concerning determinants of attractiveness—in short- and long-term mating strategies. In order to do this, participants' mating strategies were determined using the SOI, labeling each participant as favoring either a short- or a long-term mating strategy. Each individual was then given the choice to reveal either the face or body from a portrait of a person of the opposite gender. David Buss and his colleagues found that sociosexual orientation or favored mating strategy influenced which part of the portrait was revealed. Men who favored a short-term mating strategy chose to reveal the woman's body, whereas men who favored a long-term mating strategy chose to reveal the woman's face.Confer, J. C., Perilloux, C., & Buss, D. M. (2010). More than just a pretty face: Men's priority shifts toward bodily attractiveness in short-term versus long- term mating contexts. Evolution And Human Behavior, 31(5), 348-353. doi:10.1016/j. David Buss and his colleagues found that favored mating strategies in women had no correlation with which part of the portrait was revealed but had to do with utilitarian aspects that make sense in terms of supportive and dependable resources, health and stamina. Attractiveness, from a male's perspective, seems to be based on facial cues when seeking a long- term relationship, and bodily cues when seeking a short-term relationship because they cue healthiness and reproductive capacity. They also found men showed more retardation in long term mating strategy than women and in short term strategy for women, their individuality, perceptions of benefit and demand of mate switching influenced. These findings add to David Buss' field of research by demonstrating differences in mating strategies across preferred relationship type. Sex differences Buss posits that men and women have faced different adaptive challenges throughout human history, which shape behavioral difference in males and females today. Women have faced the challenges of surviving through pregnancy and lactation and then rearing children. Men, by contrast, have faced the challenges of paternity uncertainty, with its related risk of misallocating parental resources, and of maximizing the offspring onto which they pass their genes. Because insemination can occur by any mating choice of the female; males cannot be certain that the child in which they are investing is genetically their offspring.Buss, D. & Schmitt, D. (2011). Evolutionary psychology and feminism. Sex Roles, 64(9-10), 768-787. doi: 10.1007/s11199-011-9987-3 To solve the female adaptation dilemma, females select mates who are loyal and are willing and able to invest in her and her offspring by providing resources and protection. Historically, women who were less selective of mates suffered lower reproductive success and survival.Buss, D. (2007). The evolution of human mating. Acta Psychologica Sinica, 39(3), 502-512 Males solve the adaptation challenge of paternity uncertainty and resources misallocation by selecting sexually faithful mates.Schmitt, D. & Buss, D. (1996). Strategic self-promotion and competitor derogation: Sex and context effects on the perceived effectiveness of mate attraction tactics. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 70(6), 1185-1204. doi: 10.1037/0022-3514.70.6.1185 To maximize their offspring, men have adopted a short-term mating strategy of attracting and impregnating many fertile mates rather than one long-term mate.Buss, D. & Schmitt, D. (1993). Sexual strategies theory: An evolutionary perspective on human mating. Psychological Review, 100(2), 204-232. doi: 10.1037/0033-295X.100.2.204 David Buss supported this evolutionary reasoning with research focused on sex differences in mating strategies. In a large cross-cultural study that included 10,047 individuals across 37 cultures, Buss sought first to determine the different characteristics each sex looks for in a mate.Buss, D. (1989). Sex differences in human mate preferences: Evolutionary hypotheses tested in 37 cultures. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 12, 1-49. doi: 10.1017/S0140525X00023992 From these findings, Buss was able to hypothesize the evolutionary causes for these preference differences. Buss found that men place very high importance on youth. Because youthful appearances signal fertilitySingh, D., & Singh, D. (2011). Shape and significance of feminine beauty: An evolutionary perspective. Sex Roles, 64(9-10), 723-731. doi: 10.1007/s11199-011-9938-zBuss, D. (2007). The evolution of human mating. Acta Psychologica Sinica, 39, 502-512. Retrieved from: evolution of_human_mating_2007.pd and men seek to maximize their number of mates capable of passing on their genes, men place high value on fertility cues. Buss also found that women desire older mates. He later hypothesized that this is because older males tend to have a greater chance of higher social status;Buss, D., & Schmitt, D. (2011). Evolutionary psychology and feminism. Sex Roles, 64, 768-787. doi: 10.1007/s1199-011-9987- this social status could lead to more resources for a woman and her offspring, and could therefore increase a woman's likelihood of sexual success and reproduction. Another area in which the two sexes seem to differ greatly is in their reactions to sexual and emotional infidelity. Buss found that women were more jealous of emotional infidelity while men were more jealous of sexual infidelity.Shackelford, T., Voracek, M., Schmitt, D., Buss, D., Weekes- Schackelford, V., & Michalski, R.(2004). Romantic jealousy in early adulthood and in later life. Human Nature, 15, 283-300. doi: 10.1007/s12110-004-1010-z This has been supported as universal norm by Buss' cross-cultural study. Buss hypothesized that women find emotional infidelity more threatening because it could lead to the woman losing the resources she had gained from that mate and having to raise children on her own. He then hypothesized that men found sexual infidelity more threatening because they could risk spending resources on a child that may not be their own.Larsen, R. J., & Buss, D. M. (2009). Personality psychology: Domains of knowledge about human nature. (4th ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages Mate preferences Buss has conducted numerous studies comparing the mate preferences of individuals by factors such as gender, time, parents vs. offspring, and type of relationship. He has also conducted a large study investigating universal mate preferences. He and Chang, Shackelford, and Wang examined a sample from China and discovered that men more than women tend to prefer traits related to fertility, such as youth and physical attractiveness.Chang, L., Wang, Y., Shackelford, T. K., & Buss, D. M. (2011). Chinese mate preferences: Cultural evolution and continuity across a quarter of a century. Personality and Individual Differences, 50(5), 678-683. doi: 10.1016/j.paid.2010.12.016 Men also desired traits that could be seen as feminine stereotypes, including skill as a housekeeper. A similar study conducted in the US by Perilloux, Fleischman, and BussPerilloux, C., Fleischman, D. S., & Buss, D. M. (2011). Meet the parents: Parent-offspring convergence and divergence in mate preferences. Personality and Individual Differences, 50(2), 253-258. doi: 10.1016/j.paid.2010.09.039 revealed the same, with the addition of the desire for the traits healthy, easygoing, and creative/artistic. Women, however, favor traits related to resources, such as good earning capacity, social status, education and intelligence, and ambition and industriousness. Women also favor, more than men, the traits kindness and understanding, sociability, dependability, emotional stability, and an exciting personality. Parents of sons similarly ranked physical attractiveness at higher importance than parents of daughters, and parents of daughters ranked good earning capacity and education at higher importance. Overall, these sex differences in mate preferences appear to reflect gender stereotypes as well as theories of evolutionary psychology, which state that men will prefer fertility to pass on their genes, while women will prefer resources to provide for a family. Even though both are motivated by the need to pass on their genes, parents often have different preferences in mates for their kids than the kids have for their own mates. Offspring tended to rank physically attractive and exciting personality higher than their parents, while parents found religious, kind and understanding, and good earning capacity to be more important factors. Parents and daughters in particular differed in that parents also ranked good housekeeper, healthy, and good heredity higher than their daughters. The authors speculated that health was more important to parents because concerns about health problems tend to increase later in life. Parents also consistently ranked religion at a higher priority than their children, reflecting the idea that parents want in-laws with similar values to them. Offspring, meanwhile, ranked religious very low, reflecting the lack of religiosity in younger generations. Emotional distress towards intersexual deception David Buss' research also explores the differing ways in which men and women cope with intersexual deception. His Strategic Interference Theory (SIT) states that conflict occurs when the strategies enacted by one individual interfere with the strategies, goals, and desires of another.Buss, D. M. (1989). Conflict between the sexes: Strategic interference and the evocation of anger and upset. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 56(5), 735-747. doi: 10.1037/0022-3514.56.5.735 Buss found that anger and distress are the two primary emotions that have evolved as solutions to strategic interference between men and women. When a person's goals, desires, and strategies are compromised, his or her aroused anger and subjective distress serve four functions: (1) to draw attention to the interfering events, (2) to mark those events for storage in long-term memory, (3) to motivate actions that reduce or eliminate the source of strategic interference, and (4) to motivate memorial retrieval and, hence, subsequent avoidance of situations producing further interference. In this manner, SIT implies that anger and distress will be activated when a person is confronted with an event that interferes with his or her favored sexual strategy. The source of interference will differ between the sexes, as men and women display different sexual strategies. Buss and colleagues have found that SIT helps in predicting emotional arousal with respect to mating deception. These predictions can be made in regards to various scenarios that often occur between men and women.Haselton, M. G., Buss, D. M., Oubaid, V., & Angleitner, A. (2005). Sex, lies, and strategic interference: the psychology of deception between the sexes. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 31(1), 3-23. doi: 10.1177/0146167204271303 The research facilitated by Buss and colleagues shows that women, in comparison to men, will display more emotional distress when they have been deceived about their partner's socioeconomic status, when their partners deploy expressions of love as a short-term mating strategy, when their partners display postcopulatory signals of disinterest in pursuing a long-term relationship, and when their partners conceal their existing emotional investment in another person. Men, more than women, will become emotionally distressed when their partners present false invitations for sex as a long-term mating strategy, when their partner displays sexual infidelity in the context of a long-term relationship, and when their partners lie about the content of their sexual fantasies. Mate poaching and guarding Schmitt & Buss in 2001 defined mate poaching as a behavior designed to lure someone who is already in a romantic relationship, either temporarily for a brief sexual liaison or more permanently for a long-term mating. In empirical studies men showed higher propensity in mate poaching than women. Tactics involved befriending, waiting for an opportunity, driving a wedge in existing relationship, etc.Schmitt, D.P., & Buss, D.M. (2001). Human mate poaching: Tactics and temptations for infiltrating existing relationships. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 80, 894-917. Mate guarding is a co- evolution strategy designed to defend against poaching. Jealousy and guesstimation are identified indicators of this guarding strategy. Among men, expressed sexual infidelity of their mate was the most damaging, while women expressed emotional infidelity as the most damaging. Men perceived borderline paternity issues. In contrast, women were always 100% certain that their offspring are their own. Mate retention tactics among men mainly involved vigilance and violence; among women, it mainly consisted of enhancing their physical appearance and intentionally provoking their mate's jealousy with suggestibility an object/stimulus is a threat to their valued relationship and challenge status hierarchy with changes in attachment.Buss, D.M. (2000). The dangerous passion: Why jealousy is as necessary as love and sex. New York: Free Press.

Produced by Tsuburaya Productions, the series aired on Fuji TV from December 5, 1971 to November 26, 1972, with a total of 51 episodes. This was Tsuburaya Productions' first non-Ultra superhero (even though there were concepts that were similar to Ultraman, which became Tsuburaya trademarks). Like Ultra Seven, Mirrorman was more of a dark and brooding science fiction drama than most other shows of its ilk, but by Episode 26, after major changes were forced upon the series by the network (making the action lighter and the hero more like Ultraman), it became a typical action- oriented superhero adventure of its era. There was a spin-off, a short series titled Mirror Fight, broadcast on TV Tokyo from April 1, 1974 to September 27, 1974, with a total of 65 short episodes. It was similar in concept to the earlier Ultra Fight. Over the years, there were several sequel series rumors. In 2005, this somewhat came true in Mirrorman REFLEX, a straight-to-DVD series that would be later compiled into a film. Featuring no characters or connection to the old series, REFLEX has a darker tone on par with the first half of the original television series. In July 2018, the series finally had its premiere in the United States, after 47 years, on the television channel Toku. A month later, the series was added to its streaming platform.  Plot  In 1980, an evil alien race known simply as the Invaders are about to take over the Earth, using assorted daikaiju (giant monsters) and other fiendish plots. Assigned to investigate this threat is an organization called the Science Guard Members (SGM). But another hope comes from someone, unbeknownst even to himself, possessing otherworldly power. Professor Mitarai, the leader of SGM, finally shares a secret with his foster son, a young photojournalist named Kyôtarô Kagami (\\"kagami\\" = Japanese for \\"mirror\\"), a secret only he himself knows: Kyôtarô is a half-caste of an alien father and a human mother (both of whom are missing — captives of the Invaders). Kyôtarô discovers that he is actually the son of Mirrorman, a superhero from the 2nd Dimension. However, the original Mirrorman was defeated by the Invaders' toughest monster King Zyger (explained in Episode 14), but his son Kyôtarô survived, and shares the same powers as his namesake. Naturally, the young man had difficulty accepting his destiny, but he soon realizes that he is the only one who can save the Earth from the Invaders, when they try to assassinate him. In order to transform into Mirrorman, Kyôtarô must stand in front of any reflective surface (mirrors, water, etc.), and flash his Mirror-Pendant, and utter the words \\"Mirror Spark\\".

Starting off an assistant for Kazuhiro Fujita on his manga Ushio & Tora, he started creating several one-shots for the shōnen manga anthology such as Bird Man (about a young pilot), Hero Ba-Ban (about a cheerful, but weak superhero) and Genmai Blade (about a teenage medicinal exorcist, of which he created both a one-shot and a two-part story). By 1999, he had created the series Newtown Heroes, which was published in Shōnen Sunday Super, a seasonal publication featuring upcoming manga artists and one-shots from the main Sunday book. Makoto Raiku's signature in 2006 BiographyDebut= In 2001, Raiku started the manga series Konjiki no Gash!!, which began publication in Shogakukan's Weekly Shōnen Sunday, and in 2003, inspired an anime version (Konjiki no Gash Bell!!) produced by Toei Animation. In the U.S., both the manga and anime are known as Zatch Bell!. In one chapter of the Konjiki no Gash Bell!! manga, Raiku makes an appearance with his own story, and also plays the role of Umagon's partner in the game, Konjiki no Gash Bell!!: Electric Arena (prior to the introduction of Kafka Sunbeam). In 2003, Konjiki no Gash!! received the 48th Shogakukan Manga Award in the Shōnen category. =Civil trial= In June 2008, Raiku brought a case against Shogakukan to Tokyo District Court because they lost 5 of his coloured works. He demanded 3,300,000 yen as compensation. According to the beginning of his statement, he decided to do it because he doesn't want publishers and their editors to look down on manga artists. In addition, Raiku was treated extremely badly for a long time. Moreover, the price of compensation represented by Shogakukan was only 500,000 yen. Raiku claimed that they had underestimated him too much. On July 28, 2008, they had their first public session. Shogakukan agreed they were responsible for the loss with a reservation on financial value of the lost works as it was not clear. Recommended by the judge, both parties agreed to settle the claim. After the case was settled, Makoto Raiku announced he would no longer do business with Shogakukan, and switched to Kodansha. His first work for Kodansha was Animal Land, which was serialized in Bessatsu Shonen Magazine.

He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. In a 10-season career, House posted a .248 batting average with 47 home runs and 235 RBI in 653 games. As a catcher, in 580 games he compiled a .988 fielding percentage with 2934 putouts, 258 assists, and 34 errors in 2934 total chances. A native of Bessemer, Alabama, House signed out of Hueytown High School with the Tigers in 1948 for one of the biggest bonuses of the time - $75,000 and two automobiles, according to news reports. House made his debut in 1950 at 20 years of age. He earned his nickname as a baby, when his family used to say he was \\"big as a house\\" and he twisted \\"big\\" into \\"pig\\". As a player, he stood tall and weighed . His mother-in-law said the nickname came about when he came in very dirty from playing outside and his mother told him \\"you're dirty as a little pig, Frank.\\" House was known as a solid defensive catcher with a fast release and a strong arm. He also called a good game and was great at blocking the plate. His most productive season came in 1955 when he hit .259 with 15 home runs and 53 RBI in 102 games. On April 21, 1958, House scored two runs as a pinch- hitter in an eight-run eighth inning, in a 9-4 Athletics victory over the Cleveland Indians. House's feat was only the sixth such occurrence in major league history. House later served in the Alabama Legislature, where he was instrumental in the creation of the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 1967. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1975 and was honored in 2004 when the Hall instituted the Frank \\"Pig\\" House Award to recognize contributors to state sports.

Lunsford was abducted from her home in the early morning of February 24, 2005, by John Couey, a 46-year-old convicted sex offender who lived nearby. Couey held her captive over the weekend, during which she was raped and later murdered by being buried alive. The media extensively covered the investigation and trial of Couey. Jessica Lunsford's murder became a cause célèbre that influenced the introduction of legislation in Florida known as Jessica's Law, designed to protect potential victims and reduce a sexual offender's ability to re-offend, which has since influenced similar legislation in 42 other states. On August 24, 2007, a judge in Inverness convicted Couey for the kidnapping, sexual battery, and first degree murder of Lunsford, and sentenced him to death. However, Couey died of natural causes in 2009, before his sentence could be carried out. Investigation Nine year old Jessica Lunsford disappeared in the night on February 24, 2005, from her home in Homosassa, Florida. After approximately three weeks of intense searching for her around the area of her home, John Evander Couey was arrested in Savannah, Georgia, for an outstanding warrant of cannabis possession, but was released after questioning because it was only a local warrant.Perez, Mabel. \\"Judge throws out Couey confession\\", The Ocala Star Banner, July 1, 2006 Couey was a 46-year-old long-time resident of Homosassa with an extensive criminal record, listing dozens of arrests for burglary and was a convicted child sex offender. Due to the laws at the time, Couey received only short sentences and was not monitored after release, despite his record of being an experienced trespasser and his repeated sexual offenses against children. On March 12, Couey was arrested in Augusta, Georgia, at the request of the Citrus County Sheriff's Office, for questioning about Jessica Lunsford's disappearance due to his residence on West Snowbird Court in Homosassa, only 65 yards from the Lunsford's home, and his criminal record. Couey stated he did not have anything to do with the nine-year-old's disappearance and had moved to Georgia to find a job, only knowing about it from the television news. He was released from police custody after being interviewed. On March 14, Couey's half-sister Dorothy Dixon gave permission to police to search her trailer at West Snowbird Court in Homosassa. Couey had lived at the West Snowbird Court residence with Dixon, her boyfriend Matt Dittrich, her daughter and son–in-law, Madie and Gene Secord, and her two-year-old grandson, Joshua. During the search a blood-stained mattress and pillows were found in Couey's closet in his room, and forensic analysis discovered both Couey's and Lunsford's DNA on the mattress. On March 17, Couey was arrested and charged with the murder of Jessica Lunsford, and transported to the Citrus County jail in Florida. =Couey's confession= John Couey On March 18, 2005, Couey made an audio-recorded and videotaped confession to having kidnapped, raped and murdered Lunsford.Partial transcript of Video Confession of Couey, CNN.com In his confession, Couey said that he had previously seen Lunsford playing in her yard and thought she was \\"about six years old.\\" On the night of the abduction, Couey had intended to just burglarize the Lunsford's home, but saw Jessica and \\"acted on impulse and he took her.\\" He entered Lunsford's house at about three o'clock in the morning through an unlocked door, awakened Lunsford, told her \\"Don't yell or nothing\\", and told her to follow him out of the house.Bruno, Anthony. Jessica Lunsford: Death of a 9 year old\\" , CourtTV CrimeLibrary He occupied a trailer along with two women, some away, at the time of Lunsford's abduction.\\"Drifter says he held girl three days\\", CNN.com, June 24, 2005 Couey admitted to raping Lunsford in his bedroom, keeping her in his bed that evening, where he raped her again in the morning. Couey put her in his closet and ordered her to remain there, which she did as he reported for work at \\"Billy's Truck Lot\\". Three days after he abducted her, Couey tricked Jessica into getting into two garbage bags by saying he was going to \\"take her home\\". He instead buried her alive as he decided he could do nothing else with the girl. He said he \\"Didn't want people seeing him and Lunsford across the street.\\" =Discovery of Lunsford's body= On March 19, police found nine year old Jessica Lunsford's body at the residence on West Snowbird Court in Homosassa, buried in a plastic bag in a hole approximately 2½' deep and 2' circular, covered with leaves. Lunsford's body was removed from the ground and transported to the coroner's office, where it was recorded to have undergone \\"moderate\\" to \\"severe\\" decomposition. According to the publicly released autopsy reports, Lunsford had poked two fingers through the bags before suffocating to death, and the fingers had skeletonized. The coroner ruled that death would have happened even in best circumstances within 2–3 minutes from lack of oxygen. After the discovery of Lunsford's body at the residence, Dixon stated that a week earlier she had given Couey money for a bus ticket, and that he had telephoned her to say he had moved to Savannah, Georgia. Additionally, Dixon and the other residents of the trailer claimed to have never seen Lunsford at the home or noticed anything strange from Couey's room, which had not been used since he was last there. On June 30, 2006, a judge ruled that Couey's confession was inadmissible in court because when it was recorded police had not granted Couey's requests for a lawyer, thereby rendering the confession invalid and unreliable under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the United States Constitution. Over Couey's objection, the trial court ruled that all evidence collected after the confession, including the recovery of Lunsford's body, would be admitted, as would incriminating statements allegedly made by Couey to investigators and a jail guard.Ross, Jim. \\"Judge: Couey confession out\\" St. Petersburg Times, June 30, 2006 ConvictionCriminal proceedings= The trial was moved to Miami after officials were unable to seat an impartial jury in Citrus County where the trial was first scheduled to be held.Nesmith, Susannah A. \\"Wanted: Fair Jury...\\", pages 1A, 19A, The Miami Herald, February 11, 2007. On March 7, 2007, Couey was found guilty of all charges in relation to Lunsford's death, including first degree murder, kidnapping, burglary with assault or battery upon any person, and capital sexual battery. The jury deliberated for four hours, tasked with recommending either life in prison without the possibility of parole or the death penalty, the only two possible sentences available under Florida law. A week later, after about one hour and 15 minutes of deliberation, a jury recommended Couey be put to death. The case was appealed to the Florida Supreme Court. On August 11, 2007, a jury overseeing the nine year old Jessica Lunsford case voted 10-2 that Couey be eligible for the death sentence. Defense for Couey argued that he had suffered from a lifetime of emotional abuse and had a below normal IQ, which would enable him to avoid a death sentence under a 2002 Supreme Court ruling prohibiting the execution of mentally handicapped people. However, the most credible intelligence test rated Couey's IQ at 78, above the standard accepted level of mental retardation, which is 70. On August 24, 2007, Couey was sentenced to death, in addition to three consecutive life sentences. However, on September 30, 2009, before the sentences could be carried out, Couey died of natural causes. AftermathJessica Lunsford Act= Following her death, her father, Mark Lunsford, pursued new legislation to provide more stringent tracking of released sex offenders. The Jessica Lunsford Act was named after her. It requires tighter restrictions on sex offenders (such as wearing electronic tracking devices) and increased prison sentences for some convicted sex offenders.Ramirez, Jessica. \\"The Abductions That Changed America\\", Newsweek, January 29, 2007, pp. 54–55. \\"Jessica's Law\\" refers to similar reform acts initiated by other states. =Wrongful death and negligence lawsuit= On February 19, 2008, almost three years to the day after her kidnapping and murder, Jessica's father was represented by Jacksonville, Florida lawyers in a pre-trial brief filed against the Citrus County Sheriff's Office and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. After receiving notice of the pending suit, Citrus County Sheriff Jeff Dawsy stated that he believed the case to be \\"baseless... There is only one person in the world that should be held responsible for Jessica Lunsford's death and that's John Couey.\\" Following complaints and suggestions from Citrus County residents that the pending litigation was being pursued out of greed and that had he been a better father his child may still be alive, Mark Lunsford and Jacksonville-based attorneys Eric Block and Mark Gelman held a news conference in Jacksonville, where it was stated that the pending litigation was \\"not for the money... but for change.\\" Lunsford stated that changes were needed in procedures and policies. It is alleged that Couey had Jessica Lunsford alive in the trailer while Citrus County officials visited the trailer, that police dogs indicated Jessica was being held in the direction of the trailer and were ignored, that Citrus County officials actively pursued Mark Lunsford's father as their prime suspect while evidence pointed elsewhere, and that had Citrus County officials followed up on an outstanding warrant issued by Georgia, that Citrus County officials could have entered Couey's residence and possibly saved the child. Other media Mark Lunsford becoming an activist for children's rights after the murder of his daughter Jessica is the subject of the 2011 documentary film, Jessie's Dad. The abduction of Jessica Lunsford was covered in 2013 on the TV series FBI: Criminal Pursuit in the episode \\"Lurking Menace\\".

The AK-101 is designed for the world export market, using the NATO standard 5.56x45mm cartridge. The AK-101 is marketed at those looking for a weapon that combines the logistical compatibility and familiarity of the 5.56×45mm NATO round with the reliability of a Kalashnikov. The design of this rifle is almost similar to AK-74. It is designed with modern and composite materials, including plastics that reduce weight and improve accuracy. Many of the improvements found in the AK-101 are also present in the AK-103 and the rest of the AK-100 series of rifles. Design The AK-101 is a selective fire weapon that can be fired in either semi-automatic or fully automatic mode. The disassembly procedure for the AK-101 is identical to that of the AK-74. The AK-101 has an attachment rail installed on the side of the receiver for mounting scopes and other optical sights, which will accept most types of Russian and European AK optics. The rifle accepts most synthetic and metal AK-74-style magazines with 30-round capacity. The AK-101 has a barrel with an AK-74 style muzzle brake attached to the barrel to control muzzle climb. The AK-102, AK-104 and AK-105 are the designations given to the more compact carbine variants of the AK-10x rifle series, firing the 5.56×45mm NATO, 7.62×39mm M43 and 5.45×39mm M74 rifle rounds respectively. These carbines differ from the normal rifles of the series in that they have much shorter barrels, only in length. These AK-100 series carbines, much like their rifle counterparts, were made primarily for export. The AK-101 is chambered in 5.56mm NATO and features a black glass- filled polyamide side folding stock. The side folding stock looks similar to a normal fixed stock, but folds and locks securely to the left side of the receiver. It has a cutout to compensate for the side rail. = Chinese copy = An AK-2000P of the Indonesian Mobile Brigade Corps Norinco produced a copy of the AK-101 as the AK-2000, with the stock of the Type 56-2.

Accessed March 14, 2011. \\"The 54-year old Brennan is a native of Phillipsburg, NJ who graduated as the all- time leading scorer at Phillipsburg Catholic High School.\\" Brennan graduated from the University of Georgia in 1971, where, as a senior, he received the men's basketball team leadership award. He began his coaching after graduating in the fall of 1971 as a graduate assistant at Georgia under Ken Rosemond. Sandwiched around a year as head basketball and baseball coach at Division III Fairleigh Dickinson University in Madison, New Jersey, Brennan was an assistant under college basketball coaches Rollie Massimino at Villanova, Bill Raftery at Seton Hall and Bruce Parkhill at William & Mary. In 1982, he was named head coach at Yale where he crafted a four-year record of 46–58, including back-to-back seasons of 14–12 and 13–13. At Yale, he coached players such as Earl \\"Butch\\" Graves and NBA veteran Chris Dudley. In 19 years at Vermont, Brennan led the Catamounts to four 20+ win seasons, three America East championships and UVM's first three NCAA Tournament appearances, including the school's first NCAA Tournament win over BIG EAST champion Syracuse in 2005. Brennan is one of two coaches in America East history to lead his team to three consecutive conference titles. Brennan's last four Vermont teams brought unprecedented positive national publicity to the men's basketball program and to the school. During his last season, Vermont became the first and only America East team to sell out every one of its home games at Patrick Gymnasium. During the second half of the 2004–05 season the Catamounts were the subject of five parts of ESPN's critically acclaimed nationally televised series, 'The Season.' UVM's upset also was nominated for an ESPY award in 2005. Standouts that Brennan coached at Vermont include Eddie Benton, the 1996 winner of the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award given to the nation's top senior less than 6-feet tall, Matt Johnson, Kevin Roberson, Trevor Gaines, T.J. Sorrentine and Taylor Coppenrath, a finalist in 2005 for both the John Wooden and James Naismith National Player of the Year Awards, the first and only America East player to be on a final ballot for National Player of the Year.  Broadcast career  During his coaching career, Brennan co-hosted a morning radio show in Burlington, Vermont called \\"Corm and the Coach,\\" with radio personality Steve Cormier, which began on WIZN-FM 106.7 FM in 1992. In 1998, the pair moved to WCVP-FM 101.3 and WCVR-FM 102.1 until July 2008, when Brennan decided to retire from his position as morning radio personality. In November 2009, Brennan and Cormier teamed up again to bring \\"Corm and the Coach\\" briefly back on the air on 107.1 WNMR before moving to television on WCAXtra TV and on the internet on NSN.net until 2011. Brennan delivers Saturday Night Live-style sports reports and his thoughts on basketball, politics, entertainment, local news and psychology. The Coach's repertoire also included live, pre-dawn wake-up calls to his players and coaching colleagues. In the 2003 and 2004 off-seasons, he also was a co-host on several ESPN national radio shows. After his retirement from coaching in 2005, Brennan joined ESPN working as a college basketball studio analyst as well as doing color commentary across the ESPN family of networks. He worked at ESPN until 2009. In December 2010, Brennan joined Sirius XM Radio as a co- host of College Basketball Today that airs during the college hoops season. Brennan also does radio commentary for college basketball on Westwood One, now known as Dial Global Sports, as well as television work for NBC Sports Network, appearing as a college basketball analyst on NBC SportsTalk.

A game of body painted human chess at the World Bodypainting Festival in Pörtschach am Wörthersee, Carinthia, Austria. Human chess, living chess or live chess is a form of chess in which people take the place of pieces. Human chess is typically played outdoors, either on a large chessboard or on the ground, and is often played at Renaissance fairs.  Forms  Many human chess games are choreographed stage shows performed by actors trained in stage combat. When this is the case, piece captures are represented by choreographed fights that determine whether the piece is actually taken or not. Alternatively, the pieces may spar, following rules similar to those used by the Society for Creative Anachronism.  Instances  A costumed human chess game has been staged every two years on the second week in September in the Italian city of Marostica, near Venice, since 1923. The game commemorates a legendary chess game played in 1454 by two young knights in order to settle which of them would court the lady that both had fallen in love with. The event lasts 3 days. The participants of the game dress historic clothes. The human chess game has strict rules which have been set by a specific committee. The performance lasts 30 minutes. Human shogi In terms of the Japanese game of shogi, an annual festival in Tendō, Yamagata held every late April has an event called , where people involved alongside large shogi pieces with stands are dressed in Sengoku period costumes. Tendō and Marostica have been sister cities since 1993. = Fictional Representation = Human chess is a theme in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass (1871). The Chessmen of Mars depicts a version of a Martian chess variant called Jetan where the pieces are human captives and captures in the game are replaced by fights to the death between them. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone features a game of Wizard's chess with magically animated human-sized pieces. The characters Harry, Ron, and Hermione take the place of three of the pieces. Hunters featured a game of human chess played at a concentration camp during WWII. This was criticized by the Auschwitz Museum since such a game never actually took place.

Surviving copies of both the Kangnido and the Da Ming Hun Yi Tu all bear later revisions, and the original, unrevised forms of both maps are uncertain. Nevertheless, the surviving copies of the Kangnido constitute one of the most important materials for reconstructing the original form of the 14th-century Chinese map. As a world map, it reflects the geographic knowledge of China during the Mongol Empire when geographical information about Western countries became available via Islamic geographers.(Miya 2006; Miya 2007) It depicts the general form of the Old World, from Africa and Europe in the west to Japan in the east.Angelo Cattaneo Europe on late Medieval and early Renaissance world maps, International BIMCC Conference (Nov 2007) Although, overall, it is less geographically accurate than its Chinese cousin, most obviously in the depiction of rivers and small islands, it does feature some improvements (particularly the depictions of Korea and Japan, and a less cramped version of Africa). Manuscripts Only two copies of the map are known today. Both have been preserved in Japan and show later modifications. The map currently in Ryūkoku University (hereafter, Ryūkoku copy) has gathered scholarly attention since the early 20th century. It is 158 cm by 163 cm, painted on silk. It is presumed that the Ryūkoku copy was created in Korea but it is not clear when the copy was brought to Japan. One claims that it was purchased by Ōtani Kōzui and others assume that it was obtained during the invasion of Korea (1592-1598) and given to the West Honganji temple by Toyotomi Hideyoshi.(Miya 2006:598-599,650) It contains some place names of Korea that are newer than 1402, suggesting that the Ryūkoku copy was partially modified from the 1402 original around the 1470s and 1480s.(Aoyama 1938:111-112; Aoyama 1939:149-152; Robinson 2007) The later Honkōji version of the map. Another copy (Honkōji copyThe title of the Honkōji copy is written in seal script and difficult to read. Some earlier studies read \\"混一疆理歷代國都地圖.\\" See (Miya 2006:601).) was discovered in the Honkōji temple of Shimabara, Nagasaki in 1988. It is 220 cm by 280 cm, much larger than the Ryūkoku copy, and painted on paper. It seems that the Honkōji copy was created in Japan during the Edo period.(Miya 2006:599) The place names of Korea suggest that it was revised around the 1560s.(Miya 2007:14) There are two copies of maps in Japan that are related to the map. One (Honmyōji copy) housed in the Honmyōji temple of Kumamoto is known as the \\"Map of the Great Ming\\" (大明國地圖). The other (Tenri copy) at Tenri University has no title and is tentatively called by a similar name (大明國圖).Unno Kazutaka 海野一隆: Tenri toshokan shozō Daimin koku zu ni tsuite 天理図書館所蔵大明国図について, Memoirs of the Osaka University of the Liberal Arts and Education. A, Humanistic Science, No. 6, pp. 60-67, 1957. They are considered to be later adaptations of the original. The most important change is that place names of China are updated to those of the Ming Dynasty while the original showed administrative divisions of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty. Based on a legend of the temple, it has been assumed naively that the Honmyōji copy was given to Katō Kiyomasa, the ruler of Kumamoto, by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in preparation for the Korean campaigns. However, the Seonjo Sillok of Korea reports that in 1593 the son of a Korean official who had surrendered to Katō copied and offered map(s) of China and Korea to him. This may refer to the extant Honmyōji map.(Miya 2006:600-601) Sources and contents The Ryūkoku and Honkōji copies contain Gwon Geun (權近)'s preface at the bottom. The preface is also recorded in his anthology named Yangchon Seonsaeng Munjip (陽村先生文集). According to Gwon, the map was based on the following four maps: * the world map named Shengjiao Guangbei Tu (聲教廣被圖) by Li Zemin (李澤民) * the historical map of China named Hunyi Jiangli Tu (混一疆理圖) by Qingjun (清浚) * an unnamed map of Korea * an unnamed map of Japan In the fourth year of the Jianwen era (1402), Korean officials named Kim Sa-hyeong (金士衡) and Yi Mu (李茂), and later Yi Hoe (李薈), analyzed the two Chinese maps and combined these two maps into a single map. They though that Li Zemin's map did not properly depict the region east to the Liao River (Liaodong) and Korea, they added the enlarged Korea, and also appended a map of Japan, premised about a similar map that was introduced to Korea from Japan in 1402. =Li Zemin's world map= Li Zemin's world map is lost, and little is known about the creator Li Zemin. The Kangnido is a key map for reconstructing Li's world map. Other extant maps considered to be based on Li's map are: * a pair of maps named Dongnan Haiyi Tu (東南海夷圖) and Xinan Haiyi Tu (西南海夷圖),(Takahashi 1963:92-93; Miya 2006:509-511) which is recorded in the Guang Yu Tu (廣與圖)(1555) by Luo Hongxian (羅洪先), and * the Da Ming Hun Yi Tu (circa 1389).(Miya 2006:511-512) There are possible literary references to Li's world map. An important clue is provided by Wu Sidao (烏斯道)'s anthology titled Chuncaozhai Ji (春草齋集), where Wu states that he had merged a map named Guanglun Tu (廣輪圖) and Li Rulin (李汝霖)'s Shengjiao Beihua Tu (聲教被化圖). Although his own map is not known today, Wu seems to have referred to Li's map concerned because the Shengjiao Beihua Tu would be an alias for Shengjiao Guangbei Tu (聲教廣被圖) and Rulin would have been Li Zemin's courtesy name. Wu states that Li's map was newer than the Guanglun Tu (circa 1360). Based on place names on the map, earlier studies presumed that the source map had been created around 1319 and revised sometime between 1329 and 1338. However, Wu suggests that Li's map was created sometime after 1360. Most importantly, Korea's attempt to merge Chinese maps had at least one precedent in the Mongol era.(Miya 2006:514-517) As a world map, the Kangnido depicts the general form of the Old World, from Africa and Europe in the west to Japan in the east although the western portion is much smaller than its actual size. It contains the cartographic knowledge of Afro-Eurasia that cannot be found in China in the pre-Mongol period. Place names presented on the map suggest that the western portion of the map reflects roughly the situation of the early 14th century.(Sugiyama 2007:80) In the East, geographic information about the West was not updated in the post-Mongol period until Europeans such as Matteo Ricci brought Western knowledge. Place names based on traditional Chinese knowledge and Islamic knowledge coexist separately. Their boundary line can be drawn from Besh Baliq to Delhi. Names based on Chinese geography were placed to the north and east of Besh Baliq even if they are actually located to the west. For example, the Talas River, a historic site for the Tang Dynasty, was placed to the northeast of Besh Baliq although its actual direction is northwest. Similarly, India and Tibet are based on traditional Chinese knowledge, mainly gained by Buddhist pilgrimage up to the Tang Dynasty. To the west of the \\"old\\" India, contemporary place names of India such as Delhi, Badaun and Duwayjir∼Duwayqir (Persianized form of Devagiri) are shown. This suggests that information was acquired via the Ilkhanate.(Sugiyama 2007:57-61,66-67) Details of Africa, Europe and the Middle East. Western Turkestan, Persia, Arabia, Egypt and Anatolia are quite clearly delineated. These areas are depicted in great detail while place names are sparsely distributed in northwestern Eurasia. They correspond to the territories of Ilkhanate and the rival Golden Horde respectively, reinforcing Ilkhanate as the main source of information.(Sugiyama 2007:61-66,67-68) There are about 35 African place names. The knowledge of the contour of Africa predates the European explorations of Vasco da Gama. In particular, the southern tip of Africa is quite clearly depicted, as well as a river which may correspond to the Orange River in Southern Africa. To the north of the African continent, beyond the unexplored \\"black\\" central mass, a pagoda is represented for the lighthouse of Alexandria, and the Arab word \\"Misr\\" for Cairo (al-Qāhira) and Mogadishu (Maqdashaw) are shown among others.(Sugiyama 2007:62-63) The Mediterranean forms a clear shape but is not blackened unlike other sea areas. The Maghreb and the Iberian peninsula are depicted in detail while Genoa and Venice are omitted. There are over 100 names for the European countries alone,Peter Jackson, \\"The Mongols and the West\\", Pearson Education Limited (2005) , p.330 including \\"Alumangia\\" for the Latin word Alemania (Germany). =Historical map of China= The Hunyi Jiangli Tu by Zen monk Qingjun (1328–1392) was one of historical maps that were popular among Chinese literati. It showed historical capitals of Chinese dynasties in addition to contemporary place names. For example, it shows the capital of Yao, the legendary sage-emperor. It followed Chinese tradition in that it was a map of China, not the world. But contrary to Song period maps which reflected limited Chinese knowledge on geography, it incorporated information on Mongolia and Southeast Asia. It also provided information of sea routes, for example, the sea route from Zayton to Hormuz via Java and Ma'bar (There remain traces on the Honmyōji and Tenri copies).(Miya 2006:498-503) Although Qingjun's map is lost, a modified edition of the map is contained in the Shuidong Riji (水東日記) by the Ming period book collector Ye Sheng (葉盛) (1420–1474) under the name of Guanglun Jiangli Tu (廣輪疆理圖). Ye Sheng also recorded Yan Jie (嚴節)'s colophon to the map (1452). According to Yan Jie, the Guanglun Jiangli Tu was created in 1360. The extant map was modified, probably by Yan Jie, to catch up with contemporary Ming place names. The original map covered place names of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty.(Miya 2006:489-498) Also, Yan Jie's map suggests that the western end of Qingjun's map was around Hotan.(Miya 2007:30) One may notice that the name of Qingjun's map Hunyi Jiangli Tu (混一疆理圖) bears a striking resemblance to that of the Kangnido, Hunyi Jiangli Lidai Guodu Zhi Tu (混一疆理歷代國都之圖) in Chinese. Actually, it is a combination of phrases common during the Mongol era. There were many preceding Chinese maps with similar titles, including the \\"Yu Gong Jiuzhou Lidai Diwang Guodu Dili Tu\\" (禹貢九州歷代帝王國都地理圖; Map of Capitals of Historical Emperors and Kings in the Nine Provinces of the Yu Gong).(Miya 2007:151-160) =Map of Korea= Although Gwon Geun did not clarify which map was utilized for Korea, it is usually identified as Yi Hoe's Paldodo (八道圖). But the original condition of the Korean portion is unclear because even the oldest Ryūkoku copy reflects the administrative situation as late as around 1470. Gwon Geun wrote that Li Zemin's map had many gaps and omissions concerning Korea. It is not clear how Korea was depicted on Li's map since Korea is out of the range of the extant derivative (southern half of the original).(Miya 2007:69-70) The modified version of Qingjun's map provides a relatively proper shape of Korea though place names presented there are those of the preceding Goryeo Dynasty.(Miya 2007:49-50) Note that, according to Gwon Geun, Korea was intentionally oversized (for practical reasons). =Map of Japan= The two original Chinese maps portray Japan as a set of three islands that lie from east to west. They would be influenced by the legend of Xu Fu. According to the Records of the Grand Historian, Xu Fu claimed that there were three divine mountains in the sea and went to one of the mountain-islands, which were later believed to be Japan.(Miya 2007:49-50,69-70) Japan is shown in better shape on the Ryūkoku copy than on traditional Chinese maps, but is rotated by 90 degrees. This drew attention from scholars and some even associated it with the controversy over the location of Yamataikoku. But the other three copies suggest that it is merely exceptional.(Miya 2006:591-592; Miya 2007:237-240) Since information on Japan differs considerably among the four copies, the original condition is unreconstructible. The Honkōji copy resembles maps in the Haedong Jegukgi (1471), suggesting that information was regularly updated.(Miya 2007:241-242) The original source map which Gwon Geun did not cite either is usually identified as the one obtained in Japan supposedly in 1401 by Bak Donji (朴敦之), based on an article of the Sejong Sillok (the 10th month of 1438). However, this article is obviously wrong because Bak stayed in Japan from 1397 to 1399 as an envoy to the Ōuchi family of western Japan but could never be there in 1401. Japanese scholar Miya Noriko considers that the date was intentionally altered for political reasons (see below).(Miya 2006:588-590) Importance in Korea This map originated from a historical setting of the Mongol Empire, which connected the western Islamic world with the Chinese sphere. The Mongol Empire demonstrated the conquest of the world by publishing treatise on geography and world maps. Their attempt enabled the integration of Islamic science and traditional Chinese knowledge. Note that the Chinese source maps were of \\"consumer use.\\" In other words, they were not created by the empire for itself. It is presumed that the Mongol government gathered much more detailed information that was not disclosed to the public.(Miya 2006) The Chinese source maps were created by and circulated among literati of southern China, especially those in Qingyuan-lu (Ningbo). Qingjun, who was from neighboring Taizhou, created the historical map of Hunyi Jiangli Tu when he stayed in Qingyuan. Wu Sidao, who left an important bibliographic clue, was also from Qingyuan. In addition, Qingyuan-lu was one of the most important seaports from which the sea routes were extended to Fuzhou and Guangzhou, and Southeast Asia, Japan and Korea. It is possible that these maps were available in Korea during the Mongol era. Korea, at the time under the Goryeo Dynasty (918-1392), was closely integrated into the Mongol Empire as a quda (son-in- law) state.Morihira Masahiko 森平雅彦: Kōrai ō ika no kisoteki kōsatsu: Daigen urusu no ichi bunken seiryoku to shite no Kōrai ōke 高麗王位下の基礎的考察-- 大元ウルスの一分権勢力としての高麗王家 (A Fundamental Study of Gao-li Wang Wei-xia: The Koryŏ Royal House as One Part of Dai-ön Yeke Mongɣol Ulus), Chōsen shi kenkyūkai ronbunshū 朝鮮史研究会論文集, No. 36, pp. 55-87, 1998. One supporting fact is recorded in the Goryeo-sa: Na Heung-yu (羅興儒) created a historical map based on maps of China and Korea, and dedicated it to King Gongmin (r. 1352-1374).(Miya 2006:583-584) Note that Gwon Geun served to the king as bichigechi (secretary). Earlier studies presumed that the two Chinese source maps had been obtained during Kim Sa-hyeong's diplomatic trip to Ming China in 1399 although there is no literary evidence for his acquisition. It is more plausible that these maps came to Korea in different times since Gwon Geun's preface implies that Korean officials picked out the two maps for their excellency from among various sources, maybe including Wu Sidao's combined map.(Miya 2006:516-517,580-583) Japanese scholar Miya Noriko presumes that the year 1402 was a landmark for the reigning King Taejong of the newly founded Joseon Dynasty. After a bloody succession struggle, Taejong ascended to the throne in 1400. In 1401, he was officially recognized as King of Joseon by the Chinese Emperor for the first time in the dynasty's history. In the 6th month of 1402, Yi Hoe's map of Korea was offered in a ceremony to celebrate his birthday. Then the project to combine it with Chinese and Japanese maps reportedly started in the summer (4th-6th months). This would be of symbolic significance in demonstrating royal power. This hypothesis also explains the factual error about the map of Japan. It was during the reigns of Taejo (1st king) and Jeongjong (2nd) that the map was obtained in Japan, but the date was altered to Taejong's reign. Oddly enough, the Annals of Joseon Dynasty never mentions the map although it was obviously a national project. Another interesting fact is that this map uses the Ming Chinese era name Jianwen. After the Jianwen Emperor lost to Zhu Di in a civil war, the new emperor banned the use of the era name Jianwen in the 10th month of 1402. Thus the map should have used the era name Hongwu, not Jianwen. However, the era name Jianwen can be found even on the later Ryūkoku and Honkōji copies. This suggests that the Kangnido was never disclosed to the Chinese.(Miya 2006:586,596) This map demonstrates the cartographic stagnation in the post- Mongol era. The maps of common use were transformed into a symbol of national prestige and overshadowed by secrecy. As the extant copies show, Korean officials regularly updated the map by conducting land surveys and collecting maps from surrounding countries. Geographic information about the West was, however, not updated until the introduction of European knowledge in the 16-17th centuries.

It is controlled by Vornado Realty Trust. Before it filed for bankruptcy in 1992, Alexander's also operated a department store chain that included 16 stores at its peak. All but one of the stores (at the time of the 1992 bankruptcy) were located in buildings owned by the company. Locations included a store that occupied the entire block between East 58th and 59th streets and Lexington and Third Avenues in Manhattan (now the location of 731 Lexington Avenue), a store in The Mall at the World Trade Center, and a store in Paramus, New Jersey that featured one of the largest murals in the world. History In 1928, George Farkas, a Brooklyn native, opened a store on Third Avenue in the Bronx with $7,500 and named it for his deceased father, Alexander. Catering to the well-to-do middle class, the store offered discounted designer clothing and high-quality private label goods. Its advertising slogan at one time was \\"You'll find Alexander's has what you're looking for; how lucky can you get?!\\" The chain thrived even during the Great Depression, and opened a location on Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse in The Bronx in 1933. At its heyday in the 1930s, this store was known for its discount bargains and had more sales per square foot than any other store in the United States. Farkas was known for being a master at selecting locations for his stores, buying instead of leasing the real estate they were established on. In February 1959, the company opened a store in Rego Park, Queens. In 1963, the company opened its flagship store on 59th street in Manhattan after it bought the land from a company controlled by Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. for what seemed like a high price of $125 per square foot. In December 1968, Alexander's became a public company via an initial public offering, raising $41.17 million, in part to prevent a takeover from competitor E. J. Korvette. Founder George Farkas retired that year due to failing health and one of his sons, Alexander S. Farkas, became CEO. In the 1970s, customers defected to larger competitors such as Macy's and Bloomingdale's, and discount stores such as Kmart. Upon completion of The Mall at the World Trade Center in 1974, Alexander's became its anchor store. The location occupied roughly 1/6 of the WTC's 500,000 square foot mall, the largest in New York City, and was located underneath 4 World Trade Center, immediately to the east of the south tower. In 1980, after a proxy fight, Interstate Properties, controlled by Steven Roth, took control of the company, seeking to maximize the value of its real estate. In 1981, management attempted to expand offerings beyond leisure apparel. In 1984 at the request of Interstate Properties, then holding a 13% stake, Alexander Farkas resigned as CEO and was succeeded by his brother, Robin (1933-2018). In 1986, Donald Trump bought approximately 20% of the company. = Closure and real estate business = 1987 was the last year in which the company made a profit from its retail operations. In 1988, Interstate and Trump each raised their stakes to 27% of the company, but Trump pledged his interest as collateral for a personal loan from Citibank, and in 1991 was forced to turn over his holdings to the guarantor. In 1992, Roth and creditors forced the company into bankruptcy and the company shut all 11 stores on May 15, 1992, laying off 5,000 people. The bankruptcy was also triggered by a put option Gruss family held to sell its 18% interest in the partnership that owned the 59th street store to Alexander's for $35 million and the company did not have the money. In 1993, the company emerged from bankruptcy. The combination of an increase in value in its real estate holdings and shedding of its liabilities caused its stock to skyrocket from $8.50 per share before it declared bankruptcy to $57 per share a year later. In 1995, Vornado Realty Trust bought the interest from Citicorp (formerly owned by Donald Trump) for $54.8 million. In November 2012, the company sold the Kings Plaza mall in Brooklyn to Macerich for $751 million and used the proceeds to pay a $122 per share dividend to stockholders. Mural at the Paramus store After George Farkas saw a mural painted by Polish artist Stefan Knapp at Heathrow Airport, he commissioned Knapp to paint one for the store in Paramus, New Jersey. However, Spanish artist Salvador Dalí had also been contracted to paint a mural for the store. Dali demanded that he do the piece, which would include giraffes with drawers suspended from their necks hanging out over the street, and Knapp could enamel the giraffes. Farkas realized Dali's idea was impractical and awarded Knapp the entire job, although Dali still was paid. When it was completed in 1963, the 280-panel mural was the largest in the world, measuring 200 feet by 50 feet and weighing over 250 tons. Farkas was enamored with the work and hired Knapp to paint murals at Valley Stream and White Plains stores. http://www.haninafinearts.com/artists/stefan_knapp/biography The store was closed in 1992 and the building sat unused. In 1996, Steven Roth, the chairman of Vornado Realty Trust, announced that the store would be redeveloped into a shopping center anchored by Ikea. Will Roseman, mayor of nearby Carlstadt, New Jersey and a director of the Bergen Museum of Art & Science contacted Roth in an attempt to save the mural. After it was appraised by Sotheby's the mural was donated to the Bergen Museum of Art & Science, which stored it in a garage in Carlstadt. In June 2015, pieces of the mural were displayed at the Art Factory in Paterson, New Jersey. However, Roseman held back 20 sections because he was worried that the Art Factory would sell the work. The sections were laid out in rows, with some having specific themes.

KING-FM broadcasts in the HD Radio format, using two subchannels for alternate classical programming. HD Radio Guide for Seattle- Tacoma HistoryEarly Years= The station that today is KING-FM first signed on the air in December 1947, originally at FM 94.9.Broadcasting Yearbook 1949 page 315 It was owned by King Broadcasting, whose co-owner and president was a woman, Dorothy Bullitt. The year before, Bullitt had purchased AM 1090 KEVR and changed it to KING (now KFNQ). (Seattle is located in King County, for which its call letters were chosen.) In 1949, King Broadcasting bought 98.1 KRSC-FM, which had gone on the air in February 1947 under different ownership. KING-FM moved from 94.9 to 98.1 MHz in 1958, replacing KRSC-FM. The 94.9 transmitter was donated to Edison Vocational School, which used it to broadcast educational programming on that frequency. 94.9 eventually became KUOW-FM, owned by the University of Washington, and now a public news-talk station affiliated with NPR. Also in 1949, King Broadcasting bought Channel 5 KRSC-TV, which had signed on the previous year. The call letters were changed to KING-TV.Broadcasting Yearbook 1950 page 314 The three stations, KING-AM-FM-TV, had their studios and offices at 320 Aurora Avenue North in Seattle. =Classical KING-FM= At first, KING-FM simulcast its AM counterpart. But over time, it began airing classical programs separate from the AM station, and by the late 1960s, it was exclusively a classical outlet, a format that has continued to be broadcast on the station since. During the late 1970s, KING-FM carried syndicated concert broadcasts by the Philadelphia Orchestra, usually under direction of Eugene Ormandy, the New York Philharmonic, and the Boston Symphony. Many of the syndicated concert programs featured well-known instrumentalists and conductors performing works which they never recorded commercially - e.g. Leonard Bernstein conducting the New York Philharmonic in a highly memorable 1976 reading of Bruckner's Sixth Symphony in A major. In the mid-1970s, KING-FM's schedule also included specialized programs showcasing Quadraphonic LP recordings and historical recordings. In 1983, KING-FM was the first station in the Seattle area to utilize compact disc (CD) technology for its recordings. =Sale to Non-Profit Group= In 1992, King Broadcasting was acquired by the parent company of The Providence Journal, a Rhode Island publishing and broadcasting company. While the new owner wanted the TV station, the radio stations were sold to Classic Radio for $9.75 million.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1994 page B-399 The AM station was, in turn, sold to EZ Communications. KING-FM was run by a non- profit partnership, consisting of the Seattle Opera, Seattle Symphony, and the Arts Fund. Although KING-FM was owned by a non-profit entity, the station continued to operate for a time on a commercial basis, selling advertising as before. Even after the sale, the radio station was co-located with KING-TV Channel 5 for several more years. KING-FM moved to an office building several blocks away in 1999. In 1993, KING-FM relocated its transmitter from Seattle's Queen Anne Hill to Tiger Mountain in Issaquah. This higher-elevation transmitter location provided a significant improvement in KING-FM's reception quality throughout the Seattle-Tacoma radio market, and sections of Puget Sound and the Cascade Mountains. KING-FM also began broadcasting its programming online, becoming one of the first internet radio stations. =Switch to Public Radio= On March 23, 2010, KING-FM announced that it would transition to a non-commercial, listener-supported public radio station in July 2011, citing reduced advertising revenue. Several other commercial classical radio stations have made similar transitions to public radio status, including WQXR-FM New York City, WCRB Boston and KDFC San Francisco. Successful fundraising efforts led KING-FM to announce on April 7, 2011, that the transition would instead take place on May 2, two months ahead of schedule. In 2011, Classical KING FM 98.1 made the successful transition from a commercial to a non-commercial public radio station. As a listener-supported station, Classical KING FM 98.1 has added new programming and added two additional channels of classical music using HD Radio technology. KING-FM is one a handful of non-commercial FM radio stations to broadcast outside the standard band for FM stations of its type (88-92 MHz).

It features several re-arranged versions of songs from their earlier self-released album Unicorns Are People Too. The album was first issued on CD and on vinyl in North America by Alien8 Recordings on October 21, 2003, and on CD in Europe by Rough Trade Records in 2004. It has since been repressed in limited quantities on pink and brown vinyl by Alien8 and was re-released on August 26, 2014 on the band's own label, Caterpillar Records. The album received positive reviews both upon its release and in retrospective analyses, and it has been considered to be one of the best Canadian indie rock albums of all time. Critical reception The album received positive reviews. Shortly after its release, Eric Carr of Pitchfork wrote that \\"even at their goofiest, The Unicorns' level of comfort with their material-- and the obvious confidence that engenders-- makes it all seem totally natural and new\\". After its 2014 re-issue, Pitchfork's Stuart Berman called it \\"messy and often brilliant\\", writing that the album is \\"too complex to be classified as garage-rock, too unsettled to be psychedelic, too hooky to be described as art-damaged, and too fiercely funky to lapse into twee solipsism\\". Adam Kivel of Consequence of Sound wrote that, throughout the album, \\"death and darkness haunt everything, even the cheeky synth tones and joyous guitars, but that shouldn't stop you from dancing\\". Justin Cober-Lake of PopMatters called the album \\"one of the year's most enjoyable\\", and Adam Lalama of Noisey wrote that it is \\"incontestably one of the coolest Canadian indie-rock albums of all time\\".

It was ported to the Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC 464 by Trevor Inns. Plot In Brian Bloodaxe, our Viking hero wakes from an ice block in which he has been trapped for hundreds of years. Upon discovering that the year is now 1983 he decides to do what he originally set out to achieve - the conquering of Britain. Working his way through more than 100 screens of platform mayhem, Brian's ultimate goal is to steal the Crown Jewels and seat himself upon the British throne. Gameplay Brian Bloodaxe plays as a platform game with some very simple \\"collect and drop objects\\" aspects. Although Brian has to dodge most of the game's varied and often surreal enemies, some of them can be killed either by headbutting them thereby stabbing them with the horns of his helmet, or using weapon objects found in the game - axe, bomb and pistol. The game is notable for its esoteric humour which was strongly influenced by the humour of sketch comedy series Monty Python's Flying Circus, its in-game music (The \\"Liberty Bell March\\" by John Philip Sousa, better known to most as the Flying Circus theme tune), and colourful graphics. Reception The game polarised critics on different platforms. It impressed many, scoring 86% in CRASH, 3 out of 3 \\"hits\\" in Your Spectrum, and 8/10 in Sinclair User, but Zzap!64 were unimpressed by the Commodore 64 conversion which they felt had not been altered sufficiently from the original version to take advantage of the machine's technical abilities.

Written by executive producer Russell T Davies and directed by Euros Lyn, the episode was first broadcast on BBC One on 2 April 2005 and was seen by approximately 7.97 million viewers in the United Kingdom. In the episode, the alien time traveller the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) takes his new companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) five billion years into the future where many rich alien delegates have gathered on a space station called Platform One to watch the Sun expand into a red giant and destroy the Earth, but the human guest Lady Cassandra (Zoë Wanamaker) is plotting to profit from the event by fabricating a hostage situation. \\"The End Of The World\\" is the first episode of the revival to be set in the future. Due in part to the numerous SFX shots the episode ate most of the series' SFX budget. The episode also features numerous intricate costumes. Location filming principally took place in Cardiff in October 2004, with some additional scenes shot in Cardiff and Penarth in November 2004 and February 2005. Studio work was recorded in the Unit Q2 warehouse in Newport from September to November 2004. The episode marked the first appearance of Cassandra and the Face of Boe, both of which would appear in the sequel episode New Earth. Plot The Ninth Doctor takes Rose five billion years into her future. They land on Platform One, a space station in orbit around Earth. They have arrived in time for a party celebrating the final destruction of the long-abandoned Earth by the expansion of the Sun. The Doctor uses his psychic paper to pass as their invitation to the party, and he and Rose find many elite alien beings there. The guests include Lady Cassandra, billed as \\"the last human\\", though she remains only a face on a large piece of skin that must be continually moisturised, with her brain in a vat below. Also present is the Face of Boe. Meanwhile, the gifts brought by the Adherents of the Repeated Meme contain robotic spiders that immediately work at disabling functions on Platform One. The Steward of Platform One recognises something is wrong, but is killed when the spiders lower the solar filter of his room and expose him to the powerful solar radiation. After Rose insults Cassandra, the Adherents follow her and knock her unconscious. She regains consciousness in an observation room where the solar filter drops. The Doctor gets the filter back up but cannot get her out. The Doctor determines that the Adherents are responsible for the sabotage. However, they are robots commanded by Lady Cassandra. Cassandra admits to being the saboteur: her original plan was to create a hostage situation (with herself as one of the \\"victims\\") and profit from the compensation she would have gotten, but now intends to profit from the other guests' deaths, expecting her stock holdings in their competitors' companies to increase in value after they die. Cassandra teleports off the station as the spiders bring down the shielding on the entire station. The Doctor and the sentient tree Jabe travel to the bowels of Platform One to restore the automated shields, but it requires one of them to travel through several spinning fans. Jabe sacrifices herself to hold down a switch to slow down the fan blades. This allows the Doctor to reactivate the system just before the expanding Sun hits the station and destroys Earth. The Doctor reverses Cassandra's teleport and brings her back onto the station. In the elevated temperature and without moisture, Cassandra's body rapidly desiccates and ruptures. Rose, now free of the observation room, looks at the debris of the Earth and laments that she is effectively the last human being. The Doctor explains that he is the last of the Time Lords, and that his planet was destroyed in the wake of a great war. ProductionConception= \\"The End of the World\\" was conceived as a deliberately expensive spectacle to show off how much the new Doctor Who could do. Platform One was designed to be like a \\"hotel for the most poshest, richest, and influential aliens in the universe\\", and is partly based on Douglas Adams' The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. One function of the episode is to reveal that the Doctor is the last of his people. Davies had also initially intended to have the last humans escaping the doomed Earth aboard massive space arks (similar arks appeared in the serial The Ark). This was dropped when the complexity of the character of Cassandra was fully realised during development. The episode features the first appearance of concepts such as the psychic paper, the Time War and the words 'Bad Wolf', which would go on to form a story arc throughout the series. It also mentions the TARDIS' universal translation capabilities, which had been referenced in the 1976 serial The Masque of Mandragora. An unaired scene would have shown the Doctor to have nine strands of DNA instead of one, an allusion to his eight previous incarnations. This episode begins with a cold open, the first time Doctor Who did this, which would soon become a standard feature. The show had previously used pre-credits teaser sequences, but only for some special episodes in the 1980s, such as the post-regeneration Castrovalva (1982); the 20th-anniversary special, The Five Doctors (1983); and the 25th-anniversary story, Remembrance of the Daleks (1988). The villain Lady Cassandra, a CGI creation voiced by actress Zoë Wanamaker, was developed for the episode. Executive producer Russell T Davies stated that Cassandra was inspired by drastic beauty treatments that had been taken by female celebrities, particularly inspired by the appearance of various female celebrities at the Oscars. He said, \\"It was horrific seeing those beautiful women reduced to sticks. Nicole Kidman struck me in particular. Nicole is one of the most beautiful women in the world. But she looks horrifying because she’s so thin. It’s like we’re killing these women in public. We watch while you die.\\" Originally, Cassandra was intended to have collected pieces of human history, such as the Magna Carta and Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. The book still appears as a set piece, being contained in a glass cabinet decorating the Platform One hotel. Wanamaker reprised the role of Cassandra in the 2006 series' first episode, \\"New Earth\\". =Filming= Cassandra was one of the main characters developed, but filming her and animating her speech was difficult \\"The End of the World\\" was scheduled as part of the second production block along with \\"The Unquiet Dead\\".Ainsworth, ed. (2016). Doctor Who: The Complete History. Volume 48, p. 92. Camille Coduri's scene as Jackie Tyler was shot in advance during the first production block because of commitments for film The Business that would make her unavailable. The scene was shot at the Unit Q2 warehouse in Newport on 7 September 2004.Ainsworth, ed. (2016). Doctor Who: The Complete History. Volume 48, p. 93. The main recording for the episode began in the studio at Unit Q2 from 22 September.Ainsworth, ed. (2016). Doctor Who: The Complete History. Volume 48, p. 95. Many of the Platform One interiors were filmed at the Temple of Peace in Cardiff from 6 to 14 October. During the recording of \\"The Unquiet Dead\\" on 20 October, several pick-up shots were recorded at Headlands School in Penarth.Ainsworth, ed. (2016). Doctor Who: The Complete History. Volume 48, p. 98. The main recording on the block concluded in Q2 on 22 October. To help with the convenience of locations, the scenes with the Doctor and Rose on present-day Earth were shot during the third production block on 9 November. Filming took place at Helmont House on Churchill Way, and on Queen Street.Ainsworth, ed. (2016). Doctor Who: The Complete History. Volume 48, p. 99. Some additional shots involving the air ducts were shot at Q2 on 26 November. The filming of screens with Cassandra proved to be difficult, with one crew member comparing it to pushing around a faulty shopping trolley. Zoë Wanamaker was unable to be present on the set during the filming of her scenes so a stand-in had to be used. Due to complexities in animating Cassandra, some of her lines were dropped and the episode underran. To compensate, Davies came up with the character of maintenance worker Raffalo, and scenes between Raffalo and Rose were filmed at the Temple of Peace on 19 February 2005. =Effects and costumes= The episode contains 203 visual effects shots that were completed over eight weeks, compared to \\"about 100\\" in the film Gladiator; Russell T Davies joked that there never would be an episode of the same scale due to the expense in producing it. As of \\"The Wedding of River Song\\" (2011), no Doctor Who episode contains as many special effects shots. Producer Phil Collinson also said the episode had more monsters than ever before. Both Cassandra and the robotic spiders — other than an inactive one — are completely CGI creatures. According to Russell T Davies, Cassandra was worked on for \\"many many months\\" and costed a \\"fortune\\". The Moxx of Balhoon was originally going to be animated, but this changed to a \\"glove puppet\\" and then a full rubber suit when it was desired he be \\"chunkier\\". Actor Jimmy Vee had done similar parts before, although the actor said it was hard filming in the costume, which took three hours to put on. Jabe was originally more tree bark-like in the face, but it was decided that she be a Silver Birch instead. Other effects include the creation of a fake 7\\" single for Britney Spears' \\"Toxic\\". In the episode, Cassandra unveils an \\"iPod\\" (actually a Wurlitzer jukebox), that plays \\"Tainted Love\\" by Soft Cell and later \\"Toxic\\".Burk and Smith, 2012, p. 9 Since \\"Toxic\\" was not actually released as a 7\\" 45 rpm vinyl single, the production team mocked up a 7\\" single for use in the episode.Burk and Smith, 2012, p. 11 Broadcast and reception Billie Piper received praise for her performance, with critic Arnold T. Blumberg writing that she \\"has shown herself to be quite capable of conveying amazingly subtle shifts in emotion\\" and noting \\"how valuable a part of this new series Piper really is.\\" According to a March 2006 interview with Russell T Davies, he requested for this episode to be broadcast back-to-back with \\"Rose\\", but the request was given to the BBC too close to transmission to do so. In the United States the Sci-Fi Channel did run the two episodes consecutively on 17 March 2006. The broadcast of \\"The End of the World\\" in the US was watched by 1.61 million viewers. In Canada, the episode had 899,000 viewers, making it the evening's 4th-most viewed primetime show. Overnight figures showed that \\"The End of the World\\" was watched by 7.3 million viewers in the UK, down 2.6 million viewers from the premiere. When final ratings were calculated, figures rose to 7.97 million. The episode received an Audience Appreciation Index score of 76, which was the lowest in the show's history until 2015's \\"Sleep No More\\". Arnold T Blumburg of the magazine Now Playing gave \\"The End of the World\\" a grade of \\"A-\\", praising the spectacle as well as the performances of Eccleston and Piper and their developing characters. However, he felt that the climax suffered from pacing issues. SFX called it a \\"brave episode to air so early, but it works\\", praising the way the alien concepts were reminiscent to the classic series. However, the reviewer wrote that \\"the full drama of the event is never quite captured\\" and \\"the murder plot...never quite takes flight, but it provides the framework for some brilliant scenes\\". In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Graeme Burk described \\"The End of the World\\" as \\"sheer, unadulterated fun\\", particularly praising the emotional connection that was built between the Doctor and Rose. Burk felt that there could have been more of a build-up to the Cassandra revelation, but commented that \\"a lot of the success of the story\\" was due to her.Burk and Smith, 2012, p. 11-12 Burk's co-author Robert Smith added that the episode allowed Eccleston to shine by offering the Doctor a wide range of emotions.Burk and Smith, 2012, p. 12-13 Despite their positive reviews, Burk and Smith noted that the switch at the end of the hallway with giant fans was \\"contrived\\" and \\"silly\\".Burk and Smith, 2012, p. 10 In 2013, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times felt that the episode had everything to be expected from Davies' Doctor Who: boldness, camp, and emotional and character drama. The A.V. Club reviewer Alasdair Wilkins gave the episode a grade of B+, noting that the episode was not concerned with plot, but it succeeded in character moments and reintroducing Doctor Who.

In 1970 he received his PhD in Philosophy with a thesis entitled \\"Between Historicism and Relativism\\", under supervision of Vollenhoven's colleague S. U. Zuidema. After his graduation early 1960s Klapwijk became lector in Logic at the Vrije Universiteit. In 1974 he was appointed Professor of History of Modern Philosophy, and later was Professor of Systematic Philosophy. Among his students were John Kok and René Woudenberg. He retired in 1994.See Jacob Klapwijk Curriculum Vitae at jacobklapwijk.nl.  Work  Klapwijk's research interest concerns the \\"relationship between reason and religion, and the delicate concept of Christian philosophy\\" He focuses on \\"the great variety of models of Christian thinking and in particular on the fundamental contrast between the medieval- scholastic and Augustinian-reformed tradition.\\"Jacob Klapwijk Professional interests at jacobklapwijk.nl. = Ernst Troeltsch, historicism and the intimations of radical historicity = Initially Klapwijk’s writings chiefly dealt with various theories of history and society. His doctoral dissertation was written on Ernst Troeltsch (1865-1923),the German theologian and later philosopher of history in Hegel’s Chair in Berlin, who was widely celebrated for his defense of radical historicism and who gave us the sociological distinction between Church, Sect and Mysticism. The Dutch title for Klapwijk’s thesis was Tussen historisme en relativisme: Een studie over de dynamiek van het historisme en de wijsgerige ontwikkelingsgang van Ernst Troeltsch (1970, English 2013). The dissertation analyzes Troeltsch’s philosophy of \\"radical historicity\\" by distinguishing six phases in its development, a development that started with a broad Hegelian perspective of universal history and ended in an extreme \\"monadological individualism\\" rooted in mysticism. In later years Klapwijk confronts this radicalized historicism with its relativistic and self-contradictory consequences even in the fields of ethics and theology. He now pretends that we have to accept the radical historicity of human beings including pluralism of norms and values without ignoring the undeniable intimations of ultimate, universal core principles that rule our daily life. This universality can only be based on the fundamental difference between anamnetic and academic history.The English translation, Between Historicism and Relativism, is available online: . In 1994 Klapwijk presented a systematic critique of historicism in Pluralism of Norms and Values, reclaiming arguments in favor of universal norms in terms of core principles for practical life anywhere. In 2009 he formulated his views of history more fully in Commemoration by initiating the basic distinction between the First and the Second History, the first one in terms of personal involvement and practical life commemoration, the second one in terms of theoretical objectification and scientific reconstruction. In 1974 Klapwijk received a Chair at VU University in the History of Modern Philosophy, while in the eighties a Chair in Systematic Philosophy was added. His inaugural lecture was published as Dialektiek der verlichting: Een verkenning in het neomarxisme van de Frankfurter Schule (1976, English 2010). In this book Klapwijk gives credit to the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory by discussing the critical views that Marcuse, Horkheimer, Adorno and the early Habermas developed with respect to contemporary history and the modern welfare of society. He concludes that, indeed, we need a critical reconstructing of the legacy of the Enlightenment in terms of freedom, rationality and human dignity, but that the Critical Theory is not critical enough. At bottom it can be interpreted as an insufficiently clarified expression of faith.Dialektiek der verlichting (1976). See in particular the Foreword by Lambert Zuidervaart from the Institute for Christian Studies in Toronto, included in the English translation, Dialectic of Enlightenment (2010), pp. vii-x = Reformational philosophy clarifies its own inner history, and its relation to modern society = A key task that Klapwijk took upon himself right from the start was that of analyzing the distinctive position of so-called Reformational philosophy. He focusses on Vollenhoven's early vision of an integral Scriptural philosophy that is not accommodated to ancient Greek paganism or modern secular humanism, undiluted by what Vollenhoven and his colleague at the VU, Herman Dooyeweerd, had called \\"synthesis philosophy\\", i.e. a mix of biblical motifs with sophisticated conceptions of a non-Christian origin. For Vollenhoven, this synthesis quality compromised the Middle Ages and even the entirety of Patristic philosophical theology, contrary to Alfred North Whitehead's appraisal of the same era. But Klapwijk emphasizes how in later years Vollenhoven acknowledged that an antithetical attitude, so characteristic for Reformational thinkers, does not exclude affinities and structural similarities between secular theories and Christian philosophy. Here already, Klapwijk raises the crucial question whether religious antithesis should not go hand in hand with philosophical openness, \\"an openness to bring all human thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ.\\"See Calvin and Neo- Calvinism on Non-Christian Philosophy (1973), p. 61. Klapwijk also analyzed and evaluated differences between the university's two leading lights, Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck, both now long deceased but both with partisan followers who could live less with the leaders' differences than could those leaders themselves. One of Klapwijk's first attempts to articulate this critical stance for his philosophical community occurred in a widely-read volume edited by Hendrik Hart, Johan van der Hoeven, and Nicholas Wolterstorff, reviewed in Theology Today by Eugene Osterhaven: \\"An excellent chapter on 'Rationality in the Dutch Neo-Calvinist Tradition' by Jacob Klapwijk ... treats Abraham Kuyper's doctrines of common grace, and the antithesis, and his failure to harmonize the two, especially when he dealt with human reason. Kuyper's attempts to give the antithesis organizational form is shown to \\"lead to a dangerous identification of the Christian (or, if you will, Reformed) cause with God's cause.\\" Although Kuyper intended Christian organizations to be a means for Christianizing society, 'the danger was that they were considered not as deficient instruments but as ends in the struggle for the Kingdom of God'.\\"See Rationality in the Dutch Neo-Calvinist Tradition (1983), pp. 97-98, and for Osterhaven here As mentioned by Osterhaven, one major difference in ideas between Bavinck and Kuyper is formulated in terms inherent to the Reformed tradition. It's the contrast between the doctrine of \\"religious antithesis\\" (not only the human soul but all of life in culture and society is to be redeemed) and its counterpart, the doctrine of \\"common grace\\" (cultural goods are tokens of God’s grace equally for Christians and non-Christians). How to integrate both perspectives? Bavinck emphasized common grace, while Kuyper, in many of his works, emphasized (sometimes severely) the antithetical attitude, also in terms of separate Christian organizations in public life. A comparison of the two positions, which came to designate two interwoven and contentious traditions in the Christian Reformed Churches in the Netherlands and the Christian movements that flowed from its membership, is presented in one of the three chapters that Jacob Klapwijk contributed to a very important self-critical work of Reformational philosophy, entitled Bringing into Captivity Every Thought (1991).See Antithesis and Common Grace (1991) and Epilogue: The Idea of Transformational Philosophy (1991). In Abraham Kuyper on Science, Theology and University (2013) Klapwijk highlights the innovative insights in Kuyper’s theories of science and society. He was one of the three editors of the volume and among nearly a dozen contributors. = Clarifying his philosophical movement's task as transformational in the wider world = The dispute about synthesis and antithesis has incisive consequences for the Christian’s position in culture and society but touches in particular the Christian calling in philosophy. Klapwijk wanted to think of Reformational philosophy not only, not even primarily as \\"Calvinist\\" in Vollenhoven's term, not only as \\"reformational-ecumenical\\" (in Herman Dooyeweerd's terms), but as a transformational philosophy. He took as an example the Church fathers’ notion of spoliatio Aegyptiorum, the robbery of the Egyptians (see Ex. 12:36). God ordered the Israelites in the great exodus to rob their antagonists from their silver and golden treasures. Yet, it was not for the sake of synthesis and syncretism (‘the golden calf’): the metals were purified and re-used for the service of God in the sanctuary of the desert. This is for Klapwijk a paradigm of the transforming power of a religious belief, also in philosophical discussions. Christian philosophy should overcome the synthesis/antithesis dilemma. It is athletic enough to keep pace with the broader philosophical world, putting the theories of the day to a critical test and using what is valuable in such a way that it can become subservient to a Christian perspective on reality in the realms of theoretical thought.See Antithesis, Synthesis, and the Idea of Transformational Philosophy (1986), p. 145. A broader survey of the previous issues as discussed by Vollenhoven, Dooyeweerd and their reformational followers is to be found in Klapwijk’s Reformational Philosophy on the Boundary between the Past and the Future (1987). Here and in The Struggle for a Christian Philosophy (1980) Klapwijk pays special attention to Dooyeweerd’s position. =Transformational philosophy and living nature= In recent years Klapwijk has applied his view of Christian philosophy in terms of transformation to the field of living nature and evolutionary theory. He is unhappy with the strictly antithetical attitude of Creationism towards the current naturalistic theories of evolution. But he likewise rejects the uncritical acceptance of these views in so-called Theistic evolution, as if God created the world in all its diversity through evolution. It's just the other way around; if the world is involved in an evolutionary process, it is so on the basis of God's creation word in the beginning. Even the theory of Intelligent Design is in his opinion too much based on a compromise, a synthesis of mechanistic naturalism and supernatural interventions. How do we overcome the present-day divide between religious and so-called secular views of the origin of life? In his book Purpose in the Living World? Creation and Emergent Evolution (2008) Klapwijk offers a philosophical analysis of the relation of evolutionary biology to religion, and addresses the question of whether the evolution of life is exclusively a matter of chance and blind fortune or is better understood as including the notion of purpose. He proposes to bridge the gap via the idea of \\"emergent evolution.\\"Purpose in the Living World? Creation and Emergent Evolution (2008). For the corresponding Dutch text see Heeft de evolutie een doel? (2009). See the first issue of Philosophia Reformata 76 dedicated to Purpose; also the book review by Henk Hogeboom van Buggenum , Klapwijk's theory of emergent evolution (TEE) indicates how at crucial moments in earthly history, when basic conditions of solidity and complexity were suitable, physical things reorganized themselves in such a way that new forms of existence were disclosed. This happened in particular when in the physical world micro-organisms, plants, animals and humans came into being. In these new entities biotic, vegetative, sensitive and mental or moral modes of being emerged, step by step. These higher levels of being and behavior still have a physical or molecular basis; all living organisms obey physical laws, that is the partial truth of scientific naturalism. But at critical turning points in the evolutionary process things on earth came in the grip of above-physical principles. Without losing their material birth certificate they succeeded in functioning in new ways, as living, growing, feeling and sometimes even as intelligent beings. The modal levels that successively emerged in these new domains of organisms represent regulation systems all of their own. In short, it is the modal hierarchy of physical laws, biotic rules, vegetative patterns, sensitive standards, mental and moral principles that in due time has given rise to phenomena of emergent or \\"transcendental novelty\\" (G. Ledyard Stebbins). Klapwijk’s TEE can be described as a non-reductive evolutionary theory attuned to the different modal spheres that characterize our earthly existence. It recognizes the curious discontinuities that have arisen in nature in the course of time not as the origin of completely new types of organisms, as creationists suggest, but as the genesis of new modal fields that come to the fore where things or organisms are equipped with higher level characteristics and observe rules of their own without ignoring their bond with their material substratum. To put it differently, the emergent levels of being and behavior that can be distinguished in living beings are conditioned by but not simply identifiable as parts of the complexification process that characterizes the physical world. This \\"levelism\\" (John Searle) has important implications for scientific research. With respect to epigenetic phenomena, master genes, so-called jumping genes (transposable elements in the cell) and other issues in the contemporary evolution debate, it encourages interdisciplinary research. It can offer a more promising framework for theoretical analysis than a one-sided naturalistic or materialistic approach.See Creation Belief and the Paradigm of Emergent Evolution (2011). See also Harry Cook, “Emergence: A Biologist’s Look at Complexity in Nature” (2013). The hierarchical ordering of the living world suggests an underlying plan and purpose. Here the language of science and even of philosophy finds its limits. In Klapwijk’s opinion we need a different, more comprehensive language. In the language of religion one could say that the creation word of God in the beginning, spelled out in the Genesis story of the seven creation days, is the driving force behind the dynamic progress, the modal hierarchy, and the various levels of evolutionary development. The Big Bang, the early inceptions of cosmic time and space, the primeval expressions of unicellular life, the rise of the multicellular systems of plants and animals and, last but not least, the intimacies of human consciousness are difficult to unite in a great chain of being, for scientists to comprehend in an ontology, an overall view of reality. But in the eyes of faith all temporal phenomena and all emergent innovations can be considered to be temporary disclosures of divine creation. According to Klapwijk it is the basic motive of divine creation that propels the world from its very beginning towards its final completion in the Kingdom of God.See \\"Nothing in Evolutionary Theory Makes Sense Except in the Light of Creation\\" (2012).

Early life Crittenden was born in Russellville, Kentucky, the son of U.S. Senator John J. Crittenden, who later became 17th governor of Kentucky. He was also brother of Confederate general George B. Crittenden, and author Ann Mary Butler Crittenden Coleman, as well as a cousin of Union general Thomas Turpin Crittenden. He married Catherine Todd, the daughter of his father's second wife. Their son, John Jordan Crittenden III, served in the United States Army and died with Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876. Crittenden was admitted to the bar and served in the United States Army during Mexican–American War as a volunteer aide to General Zachary Taylor and as lieutenant colonel of the 3rd Kentucky Volunteer Infantry from 1847 to 1848. After the war's end he served as U.S. consul in Liverpool. Civil War When the Civil War began in 1861, Kentucky was a state that declared its neutrality and was at risk of supporting the Confederacy. Crittenden and his father remained loyal to the Union, but his brother joined the Confederate Army, a common occurrence in the border states. Crittenden had been a major general in the Kentucky militia since 1860. He was appointed brigadier general of volunteers in September and placed in command of the 5th Division in the Army of the Ohio. He led the division at the Battle of Shiloh in 1862. After Shiloh he was appointed major general of volunteers and commanded the II Corps in the Army of the Ohio during the Perryville Campaign although his corps was only lightly engaged in the fighting. When Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans assumed command of the army, Crittenden's forces were redesignated the Left Wing of the Army of the Cumberland and were heavily engaged at the Battle of Stones River. (He received a brevet promotion to brigadier general in the regular army in 1867 for his service at Stones River.) The Army of the Cumberland was reorganized and Crittenden's corps was once again renamed, this time the XXI Corps. He led the corps through the Tullahoma Campaign and at the Battle of Chickamauga. Crittenden and fellow corps commander Alexander McDowell McCook were blamed for the defeat and relieved of command, but both were later exonerated and acquitted of any charges. During the Battle of Spotsylvania in 1864, Brig. Gen. Thomas G. Stevenson was killed leading the 1st Division, IX Corps. Stevenson's successor was Col. Daniel Leasure. The decision was made to replace the colonel with a more experienced commander and General Crittenden was chosen to take command of the division.Rhea, p. 218. He assumed command on May 12 and led it during the final days of Spotsylvania and through the Battle of Cold Harbor, before resigning on December 13, 1864.Eicher, p. 191. Postbellum career After the war Crittenden served as the state treasurer of Kentucky and was appointed as a colonel and then brevetted to brigadier general in the regular army before retiring in 1881. He was elected a member of the Maryland Society of the Cincinnati in 1883. He was also a veteran companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. He died in Annadale, Staten Island, New York, and is buried in Frankfort, Kentucky. A street in Chickamauga, Georgia is named after him. A United States Army post was named after him, Fort Crittenden which had been originally called Camp Crittenden, was in operation during the Apache Wars. Fort Crittenden was located three miles from Sonoita, Arizona, along Sonoita Creek. See also * List of American Civil War generals (Union) NotesReferences * Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher.

Interior of the station, showing the booking hall's mosaic floor The clocktower at the south end of the station building Dunedin railway station in Dunedin on New Zealand's South Island, designed by George Troup, is the city's fourth station. It earned its architect the nickname of \\"Gingerbread George\\". Early rail in Dunedin Dunedin was linked to Christchurch by rail in 1878, with a link south to Invercargill completed the following year, and the first railway workshops were opened at Hillside in South Dunedin in 1875. Early plans were for a grand main station on Cumberland Street, but these did not get further than the laying of a foundation, and a simple temporary weatherboard station was built next to the site in 1884. It took close to 20 years for government funding to be allocated, and planning only really commenced as the 19th century was drawing to a close. The logistics of constructing what was at the time New Zealand's busiest railway station took three years before construction began in 1903.Knight and Wales, p. 234. Dunedin required a station for a wide range of activities: it was a commercial and industrial centre, close to gold and coalfields, with a hinterland that was dependent on livestock and forestry for its economy. Construction In an eclectic, revived Flemish renaissance style, (Renaissance Revival architecture), the station is constructed of dark basalt from Kokonga in the Strath-Taieri with lighter Oamaru stone facings, giving it the distinctive light and dark pattern common to many of the grander buildings of Dunedin and Christchurch. Pink graniteNote that, while most sources (e.g., Johnson, p.34, Knight and Wales, p.235) claim the granite was from Bluff in Southland, New Zealand, stone deliberately chosen to imitate that for which Aberdeen in Scotland is famous, some, such as McGill and Sheehan (p.224), claim the stone was imported from Aberdeen. There is no pink granite in Bluff. The pillars are Peterhead granite from Aberdeen. was used for a series of supporting pillars which line a colonnade at the front. The roof was tiled in terracotta shingles from MarseillesMcGill and Sheehan, p.224 surmounted by copper-domed cupolas.Knight and Wales, p.236 The southern end is dominated by the 37-metre clocktower visible from much of central Dunedin. The booking hall features a mosaic floor of almost 750,000 Minton tiles. A frieze of Royal Doulton porcelain runs around the balcony above it from which the floor's design, featuring a locomotive and related symbols, can be clearly seen.McGill and Sheehan, p.226 The main platform is the country's longest, extending for about 500 metres. The foundation stone was laid by the Minister of Railways Joseph Ward on 3 June 1904.Johnson, p.26 The Prime Minister Richard Seddon was also present. The station was opened by Ward, by then Prime Minister, in 1906. Construction was kept within budget, and cost £40,000.McLean and Sheehan, p.144 History In its early days the station was the country's busiest, handling up to 100 trains a day, including suburban services to Mosgiel and Port Chalmers, railcars to Palmerston and the Otago Central Railway and other trains to Christchurch and Invercargill. The city's economic decline and the reduction in the prominence of rail transport means that only a handful of trains use the station today. The station used to have dock platforms at both the north and south ends and a crossover midway along the main platform. Large shunting yards, most of which have now gone, occupied land to the south. Much of this land has now been subdivided into wholesale and light industrial properties. With the decrease in passenger rail traffic, the station now serves more functions than the one for which it was designed. Bought by the Dunedin City Council in 1994, its uses have greatly diversified, though it still caters for the Dunedin Railways tourist trains. Much of the ground floor is used as a restaurant, and the upper floor is home to both the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame and the Otago Art Society. A produce market is held in the grounds to the north every Saturday morning. Every year in March, the station takes centre stage in the South Island's main fashion show, with the main platform becoming reputedly the world's longest catwalk. A thorough refurbishment of the exterior took place in the late 1990s, accompanied by the landscaping of the gardens outside the entrance in Anzac Square. In October 2006 its centenary was celebrated with a festival of railway events, including the operation of eight steam railway locomotives from all over New Zealand. In 2006 it was recognised by DK Eyewitness Travel as one of \\"The World's 200 Must-See Places\\".Dunedin railway station up there with the Taj Mahal as a 'must see' On 12 February 2008, a container wagon struck and partially destroyed the historic footbridge at the southern end of the station, joining Anzac Square with the industrial zone close to the wharves. Four people were on the bridge, with one suffering minor injuries when she fell 4.5 metres. Reconstruction of a footbridge of similar design on the same site was carried out in September–October 2008. Anzac Square and Anzac Avenue Anzac \\"Square\\" is the triangular green area marked (6). The black line is the railway. Immediately outside the station is Anzac Square, which, despite its name, is roughly triangular in shape, and was extensively remodelled and extended in the 1990s to create a formal knot garden. Directly across the square is Lower Stuart Street, which leads to the city's centre, The Octagon, from where the station is clearly visible as a major landmark. The station thus forms a terminating vista for Lower Stuart Street. The square is at the southern end of Anzac Avenue, a kilometre-long tree-lined street running roughly parallel to the railway, which leads to Logan Park. The central part of Anzac Avenue is part of State Highway 88, which links the central city with its port facilities at Port Chalmers, and was the northern end until 2011 when construction of the Forsyth Barr Stadium at University Plaza required re- routing of part of the highway. Logan Park was the site of the 1925 New Zealand and South Seas Exhibition, and the avenue and square were named to commemorate the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, the \\"ANZACs\\", who were New Zealand's main military force during the First World War. After the refurbishment of the square, a large plaque dedicated to New Zealand's Victoria Cross recipients was relocated to its northern end, close to the start of Anzac Avenue. This has since been relocated again, and now stands close to the city's main war memorial, the Dunedin Cenotaph in Queen's Gardens, 400 metres to the south. Transport services A nakedbus.com service, also carrying passengers for Southern Link, operated by Passenger Transport about to depart for Christchurch from Dunedin railway station The station was served by daily sightseeing trains to Middlemarch or Pukerangi via the Taieri Gorge, and to Palmerston. Although lacking any facilities specific to bus travel, it is Dunedin's terminal for shuttle vans to Dunedin International Airport and for most long-distance buses other than Intercity, which has its own terminal nearby.

It is formed in the Earth's atmosphere mainly by cosmic ray spallation of nitrogen and oxygen. Beryllium-10 has a half-life of 1.39 × 106 years, and decays by beta decay to stable boron-10 with a maximum energy of 556.2 keV. It decays through the reaction 10Be→10B + e−. Light elements in the atmosphere react with high energy galactic cosmic ray particles. The spallation of the reaction products is the source of 10Be (t, u particles like n or p): :14N(t,5u)10Be; Example: 14N(n,p α)10Be :16O(t,7u)10Be Plot showing variations in solar activity, including variation in 10Be concentration which varies inversely with solar activity. (Note that the beryllium scale is inverted, so increases on this scale indicate lower beryllium-10 levels). Because beryllium tends to exist in solutions below about pH 5.5 (and rainwater above many industrialized areas can have a pH less than 5), it will dissolve and be transported to the Earth's surface via rainwater. As the precipitation quickly becomes more alkaline, beryllium drops out of solution. Cosmogenic 10Be thereby accumulates at the soil surface, where its relatively long half-life (1.387 million years) permits a long residence time before decaying to 10B. 10Be and its daughter product have been used to examine soil erosion, soil formation from regolith, the development of lateritic soils and the age of ice cores. It is also formed in nuclear explosions by a reaction of fast neutrons with 13C in the carbon dioxide in air, and is one of the historical indicators of past activity at nuclear test sites.

The series takes place in a new setting separate from the preceding series, Digimon Adventure and Digimon Adventure 02, where the characters utilize cards from the collectible card games. The series aired in Japan from April 1, 2001 to March 31, 2002. The series was originally licensed in North America by Saban Entertainment, aired in the US from September 1, 2001 to June 8, 2002 as the third season of Digimon: Digital Monsters. A manga adaptation of the series, by Yuen Wong Yu, was serialized from April to October 2004. Plot Takato Matsuki, a fan of the Digimon card game, finds a Blue Card, which transforms his card reader into a D-Power. His original Digimon creation, Guilmon, materializes into real life when his D-Power scans his drawings. Takato meets Henry Wong and Rika Nonaka, two other children who are partnered with Terriermon and Renamon, as well as Calumon and Impmon. As wild Digimon began roaming Shinjuku, the Tamers defeat them and defend the city. Using their D-Powers, the Tamers can Digi-modify through scanning cards or help them Digivolve. After each Digimon is defeated, their Digimon obtains their data. Meanwhile, Hypnos, an intelligence agency led by Mitsuo Yamaki, has been capturing the Digimon and sending them back to the Digital World. The Tamers eventually began working with Hypnos when the Devas invade the Real World. Calumon is captured by the Devas, and the Tamers follow him to the Digital World to save him. When Impmon betrays the Tamers and kills Leomon, Jeri Kato falls into depression. After resolving conflicts with the Digimon Sovereigns, the Tamers learn that the Digimon are protecting themselves from humans and the Real World after the Digital World is invaded by the D-Reaper, a rogue clean-up program. As the Tamers return to the Real World, the D-Reaper kidnaps Jeri, manipulating and trapping her inside the body. When the D-Reaper begins to materialize in the Real World, the Tamers defeat it, using the program and saving Jeri. With both worlds restored, the children are forced to say goodbye to their Digimon partners, when they end up returning to the Digital World by the effects of the program. The series ends with Takato discovering the portal in the tunnel under his hiding place. Production After the success of Digimon Adventure 02, Hiroyuki Kakudo and staff did not know what to do now that the series was finished. The team was satisfied with the release of Digimon Tamers, as Kakudo believed the setting could have also been applied in the previous anime. Chiaki J. Konaka was concerned that the portrayal of the Digimon as \\"kind-hearted creatures\\" in Digimon Adventure and Digimon Adventure 02 might affect the \\"monster-like spirit\\" of Digimon.\\" As a result, Konaka wanted to explore the primitive nature of Digimon, where they instinctively harm other creatures to become stronger and would learn morals from their partners. This aspect would be primarily explored through Guilmon. Konaka was also worried about Digivolutions losing impact due to their repetitiveness. In order to solve this, the D-Power was designed as the new Digivice so that it could be used alongside cards and give the characters another \\"ace up sleeve.\\" The writers wanted to limit the use of cards to one at a time. The main characters being more responsible of the evolutions and their adventures was another of Konaka's priorities as a message to children from modern society. For the last episodes of the series, Konaka believed the final enemy is the D-Reaper. While making the series, Konaka had conceptualized the idea of the Tamers combining with their Digimon to reach the highest level of evolution, Mega. Shinji Aramaki joined the design team in the CGI animation, which including the Bio-merge scenes. Unlike the previous series, Konaka did not introduce the idea of Digimon being reborn after death, as he believed death should be portrayed realistically in a show for kids, especially since the main characters were risking their lives. As a result, the staff decided to portray death as a shocking event by using Leomon like in Digimon Adventure, even though Konaka had doubts about it. While the series was presented as dark, Terriermon and Calumon balanced out the tone of the series. =Character design= The characters were designed by Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru and was based on the concept of \\"a normal elementary school student has a great adventure over the span of a year.\\" Producer Hiromi Seki had wanted the three main characters to be of mixed genders and consist of an immigrant or someone not raised in Japan. Rika was designed with a \\"strong\\" image and character in an attempt to boost sales for products based on female characters, which traditionally did not perform well in the market. Henry became the basis of the proposed non-Japanese or emigrant character, and Konaka decided to make him half-Chinese and half-Japanese based on the statistics of non-Japanese students in elementary schools. Originally, the main cast from Digimon Adventure and Digimon Adventure 02 was set to appear as mentors. The idea was scrapped and only Ryo Akiyama from the WonderSwan games was used.  Media  Anime series = The series aired 51 episodes on Fuji TV in Japan from April 1, 2001 to March 31, 2002. The opening theme is \\"The Biggest Dreamer\\" by Kōji Wada, which peaked at #59 on the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart. The ending themes are performed by AiM, the first half of the show being \\"My Tomorrow\\" and the second half being . \\"My Tomorrow\\" peaked at #70 on the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart, while \\"Days (Aijō to Nichijō)\\" charted at #68. Insert songs featured in the show include \\"Slash\\" by Michihiko Ohta as the Digi-modify theme, \\"EVO\\" by Wild Child Bound as the Digivolution and Matrix Digivolution themes, and \\"One Vision\\" by Takayoshi Tanimoto as the Biomerge Digivolution theme. The English-language version produced by distributor, Saban Entertainment aired on Fox Kids in the United States from September 1, 2001 to June 8, 2002 as the third season to Digimon: Digital Monsters, receiving various changes to character names, music and sound effects, as well as edits pertaining to violence and cultural references. The show also began airing on ABC Family in fall of 2001, shortly after Disney had acquired the rights from Saban Entertainment, which later also included a package deal with Digimon Frontier. The show was released on Hulu with English subtitles in January 2011. New Video Group release the dubbed version as a DVD boxset in North America on June 11, 2013. Manga Entertainment released the series in the United Kingdom in 2018. The series was added to the Netflix Instant Streaming service on August 3, 2013 in separate English dubbed and Japanese subtitled versions. The series was removed on August 1, 2015, after nearly two years on Netflix when Crunchyroll acquired streaming rights to the English dubbed versions and Funimation acquired rights to the English subtitled versions, the English dubbed version of Tamers returned to Netflix while the English subtitled version of Tamers are now exclusive to Funimation. =Films= was released on July 14, 2001 as part of Toei Animation Summer 2001 Animation Fair.

The story follows Takato being transported by Yamaki into the year 2018, in order for him and the other Tamers to reunite with their Digimon Partners to stop a new threat more dangerous than the D-Reaper from destroying the world. = Short story = Digimon Tamers 1984, written by Chiaki J. Konaka and illustrated by Kenji Watanabe, was published on July 5, 2002 in Volume 5 of SF Japan, a Japanese science fiction magazine. The story focuses on the creation of the original Digimon program by the Monster Makers at Palo Alto University and dealt largely with the philosophical and technological issues surrounding the creation of artificial intelligence. In 2018, Konaka uploaded an updated version of the story onto his website. Reception Due to its differences from the first two Digimon series, Tamers received mixed reviews when it first aired in the United States (September 1, 2001). Tim Jones of THEM Anime writes, \\"Although Digimon Tamers has its faults (slow character development, a sudden change in new characters from the last series, and a less-than-exciting first half), the more you watch it, and the further you get into it, the more you'll enjoy it.\\" In comparison to the first two series, Tamers also displayed darker undertones in its plot. According to English-language dub voice actor Dave Wittenberg, the new series possessed \\"an element of seriousness\\" that was not present in the first two series. Additionally, some parts would be better understood by older viewers due to the introduction of more difficult concepts. Jacob Chapman of Anime News Network notes that Tamers is by far the most terrifying, and at certain points disturbing season of Digimon ever produced, due to Konaka's Lovecraft-fueled influence. Regarding this, Konaka believes that Calumon and Terriermon were able to tone down the grim and serious atmosphere of the occasionally tough scenes throughout the series. The airing of the series coincided with the September 11 attacks, and in at least one case, the events have been analyzed within the context of the series. Margaret Schwartz of PopMatters writes, \\"As NPR and other […] media began to debate the September 11 images, I began to see just how important it was to consider how we as a culture define and experience 'reality' […] Some argue that the shocking video footage […] is a necessary experience of the catastrophe—even a condition of it.\\" She points out the metafictional story of Tamers where \\"bits of forgotten computer data have fused to become a separate world inhabited by live creatures\\". In acknowledging the line drawn between good and evil in the series, Schwartz writes, \\"The evil here consists in refusing to see that Digimon are 'real', real creatures, and that destroying any one of them is in fact murder.\\" Through the existence of intangible communication networks as a \\"product of human ingenuity\\", she concludes that \\"those of us in the 'real' world have become so good at playing creator, at making 'things' appear much like 'real' creatures, that we tend to confuse the two.\\" NotesReferencesExternal links * Toei Animation official site (Japanese) * Digimon Tamers Resources * Category:2001 anime television series Category:2001 anime films Category:2002 anime films Category:Japanese children's animated action television series Category:Japanese children's animated adventure television series Category:Japanese children's animated science fantasy television series Category:Adventure anime and manga Category:Card games in anime and manga Tamers Category:Fantasy anime and manga Category:Fox Kids original programming Category:Fuji TV original programming Category:Japanese films Category:Jetix original programming Category:Metafictional television series Category:Animated television series about children Category:Television series about parallel universes Category:Television series by Saban Entertainment Category:Toei Animation television Category:YTV (TV channel) original programming ","title":"Digimon Tamers"},{"id":"1621854","text":"Outflow boundary on radar with radial velocity and frontal boundary drawn in. An outflow boundary, also known as a gust front, is a storm-scale or mesoscale boundary separating thunderstorm-cooled air (outflow) from the surrounding air; similar in effect to a cold front, with passage marked by a wind shift and usually a drop in temperature and a related pressure jump. Outflow boundaries can persist for 24 hours or more after the thunderstorms that generated them dissipate, and can travel hundreds of kilometers from their area of origin. New thunderstorms often develop along outflow boundaries, especially near the point of intersection with another boundary (cold front, dry line, another outflow boundary, etc.). Outflow boundaries can be seen either as fine lines on weather radar imagery or else as arcs of low clouds on weather satellite imagery. From the ground, outflow boundaries can be co- located with the appearance of roll clouds and shelf clouds. Outflow boundaries create low-level wind shear which can be hazardous during aircraft takeoffs and landings. If a thunderstorm runs into an outflow boundary, the low-level wind shear from the boundary can cause thunderstorms to exhibit rotation at the base of the storm, at times causing tornadic activity. Strong versions of these features known as downbursts can be generated in environments of vertical wind shear and mid-level dry air. Microbursts have a diameter of influence less than , while macrobursts occur over a diameter greater than . Wet microbursts occur in atmospheres where the low levels are saturated, while dry microbursts occur in drier atmospheres from high-based thunderstorms. When an outflow boundary moves into a more stable low level environment, such as into a region of cooler air or over regions of cooler water temperatures out at sea, it can lead to the development of an undular bore. Definition shelf cloud. An outflow boundary, also known as a gust front or arc cloud, is the leading edge of gusty, cooler surface winds from thunderstorm downdrafts; sometimes associated with a shelf cloud or roll cloud. A pressure jump is associated with its passage. Outflow boundaries can persist for over 24 hours and travel hundreds of kilometers (miles) from their area of origin. A wrapping gust front is a front that wraps around the mesocyclone, cutting off the inflow of warm moist air and resulting in occlusion. This is sometimes the case during the event of a collapsing storm, in which the wind literally \\"rips it apart\\". Origin Illustration of a microburst. The wind regime in a microburst is opposite to that of a tornado. A microburst is a very localized column of sinking air known as a downburst, producing damaging divergent and straight-line winds at the surface that are similar to but distinguishable from tornadoes which generally have convergent damage. The term was defined as affecting an area in diameter or less, distinguishing them as a type of downburst and apart from common wind shear which can encompass greater areas. They are normally associated with individual thunderstorms. Microburst soundings show the presence of mid-level dry air, which enhances evaporative cooling. Organized areas of thunderstorm activity reinforce pre-existing frontal zones, and can outrun cold fronts. This outrunning occurs within the westerlies in a pattern where the upper level jet splits into two streams. The resultant mesoscale convective system (MCS) forms at the point of the upper level split in the wind pattern in the area of best low level inflow. The convection then moves east and toward the equator into the warm sector, parallel to low-level thickness lines. When the convection is strong and linear or curved, the MCS is called a squall line, with the feature placed at the leading edge of the significant wind shift and pressure rise which is normally just ahead of its radar signature. This feature is commonly depicted in the warm season across the United States on surface analyses, as they lie within sharp surface troughs. A macroburst, normally associated with squall lines, is a strong downburst larger than . A wet microburst consists of precipitation and an atmosphere saturated in the low-levels. A dry microburst emanates from high-based thunderstorms with virga falling from their base. All types are formed by precipitation-cooled air rushing to the surface. Downbursts can occur over large areas. In the extreme case, a derecho can cover a huge area more than wide and over long, lasting up to 12 hours or more, and is associated with some of the most intense straight- line winds, but the generative process is somewhat different from that of most downbursts. Appearance This shelf cloud preceded a derecho in Minnesota At ground level, shelf clouds and roll clouds can be seen at the leading edge of outflow boundaries. Through satellite imagery, an arc cloud is visible as an arc of low clouds spreading out from a thunderstorm. If the skies are cloudy behind the arc, or if the arc is moving quickly, high wind gusts are likely behind the gust front. Sometimes a gust front can be seen on weather radar, showing as a thin arc or line of weak radar echos pushing out from a collapsing storm. The thin line of weak radar echoes is known as a fine line. Occasionally, winds caused by the gust front are so high in velocity that they also show up on radar. This cool outdraft can then energize other storms which it hits by assisting in updrafts. Gust fronts colliding from two storms can even create new storms. Usually, however, no rain accompanies the shifting winds. An expansion of the rain shaft near ground level, in the general shape of a human foot, is a telltale sign of a downburst. Gustnadoes, short-lived vertical circulations near ground level, can be spawned by outflow boundaries. Effects Satellite image of an undular bore Gust fronts create low-level wind shear which can be hazardous to planes when they takeoff or land. Flying insects are swept along by the prevailing winds. As such, fine line patterns within weather radar imagery, associated with converging winds, are dominated by insect returns. At the surface, clouds of dust can be raised by outflow boundaries. If squall lines form over arid regions, a duststorm known as a haboob can result from the high winds picking up dust in their wake from the desert floor. If outflow boundaries move into areas of the atmosphere which are stable in the low levels, such through the cold sector of extratropical cyclones or a nocturnal boundary layer, they can create a phenomenon known as an undular bore, which shows up on satellite and radar imagery as a series of transverse waves in the cloud field oriented perpendicular to the low-level winds.

He was awarded the Croix de Guerre, and was a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. He had been a member of La Cagoule, a violent French fascist-leaning and anti-communist group, before and into the Second World War; he then joined the anti-German Resistance late in the war. His earlier affiliation was not known when he later served as a cabinet minister under presidents Pierre Mendès France and Charles de Gaulle, and was awarded for his bravery in the Resistance against the Nazis. Biography He was born in Saint- Maurice-d'Ételan (Seine-Maritime) in an old Catholic Norman noble family. He is a collateral descendant of navigator Jean de Béthencourt through his father Victor Béthencourt. Béthencourt served in several posts in the government of France, most notably as interim minister of foreign affairs for two weeks in the spring of 1973. He also served as president of the regional council of Haute-Normandie from 1974 to 1981. In addition, he was the mayor of Saint- Maurice-d'Etelan from 1965 to 1989. Controversy In his youth, Bettencourt was a member of La Cagoule (The Hood), a violent French fascist-leaning and anti-communist group. Eugène Schueller, founder of L'Oréal, provided financial support and held meetings for La Cagoule at the company's headquarters. In the 1990s, Jean Frydman, a shareholder and board member of L'Oréal's film and television subsidiary Paravision, alleged that he had been sacked in 1989 as the senior management at L'Oréal sought to avoid an Arab boycott of firms with Jewish links. Frydman held joint French and Israeli citizenship. Frydman also turned up the fact that Bettencourt had written several articles for a Nazi propaganda organ during World War II. From 1940 to 1942, Bettencourt wrote more than 60 articles for La Terre Française,:fr:La Terre Française La Terre Française, in French Wikipédia. a newspaper that flourished with Nazi German financing during the occupation of France. In a special Easter issue in 1941, he described Jews as 'hypocritical Pharisees' whose 'race has been forever sullied by the blood of the righteous. They will be cursed'. Bettencourt attempted to dismiss the journalism as \\"errors of youth\\", claiming that his judgement was clouded by the propaganda of Vichy France. \\"I have repeatedly expressed my regrets concerning them in public and will always beg the Jewish community to forgive me for them\\".André Bettencourt (obit.) The Telegraph. 22 November 2007. Honors He was elected a member of the Académie des beaux- arts, one of the five academies of the Institut de France, as an unattached member on 23 March 1988.

A predominantly wartime fiscal instrument, the tax was designed primarily to capture wartime profits that exceeded normal peacetime profits to prevent perverse incentives for manufacturers to engage in war profiteering and warmongering. In 1863 the Confederate congress and the state of Georgia experimented with excess profits taxes, perhaps, the first time it has happened in American history. 20th centuryUnited Kingdom= In Great Britain in World War I, the Treasury rejected proposals for a stiff capital levy, which the Labour Party wanted to use to weaken the capitalists. Instead, there was an excess profits tax, of 50 percent of profits above the normal prewar level; the rate was raised to 80 percent in 1917.Anthony J. Arnold, \\"‘A paradise for profiteers’? The importance and treatment of profits during the First World War.\\" Accounting History Review 24#2-3 (2014): 61-81.Mark Billings and Lynne Oats, \\"Innovation and pragmatism in tax design: Excess Profits Duty in the UK during the First World War.\\" Accounting History Review 24#2-3 (2014): 83-101. Excise taxes were added on luxury imports such as automobiles, clocks and watches. There was no sales tax or value added tax at this time in Britain. =United States= The first effective American excess profits tax was enacted in 1917, with rates graduated from 20 to 60 percent on the profits of all businesses in excess of prewar earnings but not less than 7 percent or more than 9 percent of invested capital. In 1918 a national law limited the tax to corporations and increased the rates. Concurrent with this 1918 tax, the federal government imposed, for the year 1918 only, an alternative tax, ranging up to 80 percent, with the taxpayer paying whichever was higher. In 1921 the excess profits tax was repealed despite powerful attempts to make it permanent. In 1933 and 1935 Congress enacted two mild excess profits taxes as supplements to a capital stock tax. The crisis of World War II led Congress to pass four excess profits statutes between 1940 and 1943. The 1940 rates ranged from 25 to 50 percent and the 1941 ones from 35 to 60 percent. In 1942 a flat rate of 90 percent was adopted, with a postwar refund of 10 percent; in 1943 the rate was increased to 95 percent, with a 10 percent refund. Congress gave corporations two alternative excess profits tax credit choices: either 95 percent of average earnings for 1936–1939 or an invested capital credit, initially 8 percent of capital but later graduated from 5 to 8 percent. In 1945 Congress repealed the tax, effective 1 January 1946. The Korean War induced Congress to reimpose an excess profits tax, effective from 1 July 1950 to 31 December 1953. The tax rate was 30 percent of excess profits with the top corporate tax rate rising from 45% to 47%, a 70 percent ceiling for the combined corporation and excess profits taxes. In 1991 some members of Congress sought unsuccessfully to pass an excess profits tax of 40 percent upon the larger oil companies as part of energy policy. Some social reformers have championed a peacetime use of the excess profits tax, but such proposals face strong opposition from businesses and some economists, who argue that it would create a disincentive to capital investment.

The pamphlet contained poems, essays, cartoons, and writings, several of which were deemed objectionable by the school administration. Included were a drawing of a dart through the head of the school's principal, Timothy Dawson. The pamphlet also contained the statement, \\"I often have wondered what would happen if I shot Dawson in the head and other teachers who have pissed me off.\\" Dawson claimed that he feared for his life in response to the pamphlet. Once school authorities discovered the identities of the Killian Nine, the students were pulled from their classes one by one and threatened with arrest. After the students each gave a written statement, the school security handcuffed them and had them arrested. On November 19, 2002, 16 year old Killian student Karen Urbina was brutally murdered when she was beaten to death with a baseball bat along with her 18 year old boyfriend Justin Morejon by his 17 year old cousin Jonathon Nodal who was later charged with 2 counts of 1st degree murder and sentenced to life in prison in 2012. On March 31, 2015 Sophomore defensive end DeAndre Johnson, 15, was stabbed by a 17-year-old female senior with a kitchen knife. She was later charged with felony attempted murder and possession of a weapon on school grounds, according to a district spokeswoman. The school was placed on lockdown following the incident. On March 8, 2018, 5 female students were arrested for assaulting a female freshman in the cafeteria that was recorded and shared on social media. The five students involved were charged with battery and disruption of a school environment. On April 13, 2018, 17 year old Angel Lopez was killed while riding his bicycle from the school after being struck by a Florida Highway Patrol trooper while he was attempting to cross Killian Parkway near 107th Avenue on his bicycle. On February 5, 2018, two former Miami Killian students Adrian Abanto and Abraham Pedilla were accused and charged with burglarizing the school.

The BRN is a dimensionless ratio in meteorology related to the consumption of turbulence divided by the shear production (the generation of turbulence kinetic energy caused by wind shear) of turbulence. It is used to show dynamic stability and the formation of turbulence. The BRN is used frequently in meteorology due to widely available rawinsonde (frequently called radiosonde) data and numerical weather forecasts that supply wind and temperature measurements at discrete points in space. Formula Below is the formula for the BRN. Where g is gravitational acceleration, Tv is absolute virtual temperature, Δθv is the virtual potential temperature difference across a layer of thickness Δz (vertical depth), and ΔU and ΔV are the changes in horizontal wind components across that same layer. :: R_{B} = \\\\frac{(g/T_{v})\\\\Delta\\\\theta_{v}\\\\Delta z}{(\\\\Delta U)^2 + (\\\\Delta V)^{2}}  Critical values and interpretation  High values indicate unstable and/or weakly-sheared environments; low values indicate weak instability and/or strong vertical shear. Generally, values in the range of around 10 to 50 suggest environmental conditions favorable for supercell development. In the limit of layer thickness becoming small, the Bulk Richardson number approaches the Gradient Richardson number, for which a critical Richardson number is roughly Ric= 0.25. Numbers less than this critical value are dynamically unstable and likely to become or remain turbulent. The critical value of 0.25 applies only for local gradients, not for finite differences across thick layers. The thicker the layer is the more likely we are to average out large gradients that occur within small sub-regions of the layer of interest. This results in uncertainty of our prediction of the occurrence of turbulence, and now one must use an artificially large value of the critical Richardson number to give reasonable results using our smoothed gradients. This means that the thinner the layer, the closer the value to the theory.

In the fourth century Eusebius of Caesarea published two letters which were allegedly discovered in the archives of Edessa. They claim to be an exchange of correspondence between Jesus Christ and King Abgar V which were written during the last years of Jesus' life. Abgar V was king of Osroene with his capital city at Edessa, a Syrian city in upper Mesopotamia. According to the legend, King Abgar V was stricken with leprosy and had heard of Jesus’ miracles. Acknowledging Jesus' divine mission, Abgar wrote a letter of correspondence to Jesus Christ asking to be cured of his ailment. He then invited Jesus to seek refuge in Edessa as a safe haven from persecution. In his alleged reply, Jesus applauded the king for his faith but turned down the request. He expressed regret that his mission in life precluded him from visiting the city. Jesus blessed Abgar and promised that after he ascended into heaven, one of his disciples would heal all of the illnesses of the king and his subjects in Edessa. Development of the Abgar Legend The story of how King Abgar and Jesus had corresponded was first recounted in the 4th century by the church historian Eusebius of Caesarea in his Ecclesiastical History (i.13 and iii.1) and it was retold in elaborated form by Ephrem the Syrian in the fifth-century Syriac Doctrine of Addai. An early version of the Abgar legend exists in the Syriac Doctrine of Addai, an early Christian document from Edessa. The Epistula Abgari is a Greek recension of the letter of correspondence exchanged between Jesus Christ and Abgar V of Edessa, known as the Acts of Thaddaeus. The letters were likely composed in the early 4th century. The legend became relatively popular in the Middle Ages that the letters were translated from Syriac into the Greek, Armenian, Latin, Coptic and Arabic languages. Historical Context Eusebius contains the earliest known account of the Abgar Legend in his first book Ecclesiastical History (ca. 325 C.E.), as part of his discussion of Thaddeus of Edessa. Eusebius claims that Thaddeus went to Abgar at the request of Thomas the Apostle, following Jesus’ resurrection. He also claims to provide the correspondence between Abgar and Jesus, which he translates from Syriac.Eusebius: Kirchengeschichte (Historia Ecclesiastica), Erstes Buch, 13. Kap. Ein Bericht über den Herrscher der Edessener., Unifr.ch/bkv, last edit: April 4, 2008. = Letter of Abgar to Jesus = The church historian Eusebius records that the Edessan archives contained a copy of a correspondence exchanged between Abgar of Edessa and Jesus.In his Church History, I, xiii, ca AD 325. The correspondence consisted of Abgar's letter and the answer dictated by Jesus. On August 15, 944, the Church of St. Mary of Blachernae in Constantinople received the letter and the Mandylion. Both relics were then moved to the Church of the Virgin of the Pharos. Fresco from Varaga St. Gevorg church chapel showing king Abgar with image of Christ A curious growth has arisen from this event, with scholars disputing whether Abgar suffered from gout or from leprosy, whether the correspondence was on parchment or papyrus, and so forth. The text of the letter was:Jesus gave the messenger the reply to return to Abgar:Egeria wrote of the letter in her account of her pilgrimage in Edessa. She read the letter during her stay, and remarked that the copy in Edessa was fuller than the copies in her home (which was likely France). In addition to the importance it attained in the apocryphal cycle, the correspondence of King Abgar also gained a place in liturgy for some time. The Syriac liturgies commemorate the correspondence of Abgar during Lent. The Celtic liturgy appears to have attached importance to it; the Liber Hymnorum, a manuscript preserved at Trinity College, Dublin (E. 4, 2), gives two collects on the lines of the letter to Abgar. It is even possible that this letter, followed by various prayers, may have formed a minor liturgical office in some Catholic churches. This event has played an important part in the self-definition of several Eastern churches. Abgar is counted as saint, with feasts on May 11 and October 28 in the Eastern Orthodox Church, August 1 in the Syrian Church, and daily in the Mass of the Armenian Apostolic Church. The Armenian Apostolic Church in Scottsdale, Arizona, is named after Saint Abgar (also spelled as Apkar). = Critical scholarship = The scholar Bart D. Ehrman cites evidence from Han Drijvers and others for regarding the whole correspondence as forged in the third century by orthodox Christians \\"as an anti-Manichaean polemic\\", and entirely spurious.Forgery and Counterforgery, pp455-458 A number of contemporary scholars have suggested origins of the tradition of Abgar's conversion apart from historical record. S. K. Ross suggests the story of Abgar is in the genre of a genealogical myth which traces the origin of a community back to a mythical or divine ancestor.S.K. Ross, Roman Edessa. Politics and Culture in the Eastern Fringe of the Roman Empire, Routledge, London 2001, p. 135 F. C. Burkitt argues that the conversion of Edessa at the time of Abgar VIII was retrojected upon the Apostolic age.Burkitt, F. C., Early Eastern Christianity, John Murray, London 1904, chap. I William Adler suggests the origin of the story of the conversion of Abgar V was an invention of an antiquarian researcher employed by Abgar VIII, who had recently converted to Christianity, in an effort to securely root Christianity in the history of the city. Walter Bauer, on the other hand, argued the legend was written without sources to reinforce group cohesiveness, orthodoxy, and apostolic succession against heretical schismatics. However, several distinct sources, known to have not been in contact with one another, claimed to have seen the letters in the archives, so his claim is suspect.http://newadvent.org/fathers/0859.htm Significant advances in scholarship on the topic have been made by Desreumaux's translation with commentary,Histoire du roi Abgar et de Jésus, Présentation et traduction du texte syriaque intégral de la Doctrine d’Addaï par. A. Desreumaux, Brepols, Paris 1993. M. Illert's collection of textual witnesses to the legend,M. Illert (ed.), Doctrina Addai. De imagine Edessena / Die Abgarlegende. Das Christusbild von Edessa (Fontes Christiani, 45), Brepols, Turhout 2007 and detailed studies of the ideology of the sources by Brock,S.P. Brock, Eusebius and Syriac Christianity, in H.W.

Interactions between Syriac and Greek in Late Antiquity (Variorum Collected Studies Series, CS644), Ashgate/Variorum, Aldershot-Brookfield-Singapore- Sydney 1999, n. II. Griffith, and Mirkovic. The majority of scholars now claim the goal of the authors and editors of texts regarding the conversion of Abgar were not so much concerned with historical reconstruction of the Christianisation of Edessa as the relationships between church and state power, based on the political and ecclesiastical ideas of Ephraem the Syrian. However, the origins of the story are far still from certain, although the stories as recorded seem to have been shaped by the controversies of the third century CE, especially as a response to Bardaisan.

N.p., n.d. Web. 06 Dec. 2012. There have been a number of wild fires in the foothills of the San Gabriel Valley, that is part of the area's natural environment. Global warming has occurred rapidly over the course of the past half-century. In California, less precipitation will occur as snow, meaning that less water is able to be stored in the snow-pack, and that dry summers could see even less water availability. Summertime peak temperatures will increase in many places. Fire \\"seasons\\" may become even longer. The declaration of fire season in California is actually a change in preparedness levels for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. When weather patterns in an area of the state become warm and dry, and vegetation (fuels) are at a low moisture content point, Emergency response dispatch levels are typically increased, facilities are staffed 24 hours a day and additional firefighters are hired. When cooling weather, rain and snow are sufficient to reduce the fire threat, CAL FIRE then reduces its preparedness levels by releasing additional firefighters, closing some of the stations, and repositioning aircraft.Frequently Asked Questions.\\" http://www.fire.ca.gov.

History  Anglican High School was founded in 1956 by the Chinese-speaking congregations of the Anglican Diocese of Singapore. It was the only Anglican school in Singapore with Chinese as its medium of instruction. All others were English-medium schools. History page , Anglican High School. The school was officially opened on 9 January 1956, and led by Rev. Huang Yang Yin. Three Chinese teachers, three English teachers were employed, and 123 male students started lessons at St Andrew's Secondary School. Later on, female students were admitted. =Settling at Upper Changi= Main gate of Anglican High School viewed from Upper Changi Road The \\"8-and-a-half mile\\" site of the present Upper Changi Road campus was acquired in the late 1950s, and on 15 March 1959, the new school's foundation stone was officially laid by the Archdeacon of Singapore, Ven. Dr. D. D. Chelliah. It was to be built with a new school facility with 16 classrooms, three science laboratories, an administration-cum-staff room, an assembly hall and a clock-tower. And finally on 25 January 1960, the new Anglican High school officially opened and blessed by the Bishop of Singapore, the Rt. Rev. H. W. Balnes. =Obtaining SAP and Autonomous Status= Pre-university education (Pre-U 1 and 2) was initially introduced along with the commencement of lessons at the new campus, and was phased out in 1978 when Junior Colleges were introduced in Singapore. In 1979 AHS became a bilingual Special Assistance Plan school, and in 1995 the government awarded it Autonomous status, giving the school greater control over its affairs. =Present= In 2005 a new school building and the AHS Heritage Centre were officially opened by the Rt. Rev. John Chew, Bishop of Singapore. An indoor sports hall was completed in 2008 and was the hosting venue for the inaugural 2009 Asian Youth Games FIBA 33 (3-on-3 basketball) event. The school celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2016, and conducted its first of the kind musical on 18 and 19 March as a commemorative event. Named Chrysalis, more than 300 students and teachers come together to put up the musical. Songs in the musical are composed by past and present teachers of Anglican High. School Identity & CultureAttire and Appearance= Anglican High School's full white uniform is closely linked to its Chinese cultural roots, much like other schools with Chinese vernacular background. Boys wear white studded shirts with five metal buttons (two on the two chest pockets and three on the shirt front), paired with either white shorts for lower secondary or white long pants for upper secondary level. Girls wear white blouses with three metal buttons on the front, along with a white pleated miniskirt. The buttons used to be detachable but the metal buttons are now sewn onto the uniforms for convenience. The school badge is worn on the left chest level. Student Councillors wear a white shirt with a red tie (regardless of gender) and the respective white bottoms. When representing the school at formal occasions, AHS students will wear a red school tie and dark green blazers, along with long pants for boys and unpleated skirts for girls. = Discipline = Anglican High School has a demerit point system installed along with the discipline guidelines set by the Ministry of Education. One demerit point is given for minor offences (e.g. late-coming or improper attire), three demerit points for serious offences (e.g. truancy or defiance), and five demerit points for very serious offences (e.g. smoking, cheating, bullying, fighting or vandalism). Disciplinary actions are taken according to the severity of the offence, whether in or out of school inasmuch as the school is concerned. The demerit points are also in close relation with the students' conduct grade. Co-curricular activities (CCAs) Anglican High School offers a spectrum of Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) by the Ministry of Education, consisting of sports groups, uniformed groups, performing arts, clubs and societies, totalling to about 24 CCAs. The performing arts CCAs participate in school-based activities and concerts, and hold annual or bi- annual public concerts.

It consists of selected students from Secondary 1 to 4. Students must possess good conduct, academic results and leadership skills to be a part of the Student Council. Student Councillors have to wear a special uniform as compared to other students (see the section on Attire and Appearance).

A motherboard manufacturer can choose to provide audio, networking, or modem functionality in any combination on a CNR card. CNR slots were once commonly found on Pentium 4-class motherboards, but have since been phased out in favor of on-board or embedded components.  Technology  Physically, a CNR slot has two rows of 30 pins, with two possible pin configurations: Type A and Type B, each with different pin assignments. CNR Type A uses 8-pin PHY interface, while Type B uses 17-pin media-independent interface (MII) bus LAN interface. Both types carry USB and AC'97 signals. As with AMR, CNR had the cost savings potential for manufacturers by removing analog I/O components from the motherboard. This allowed the manufacturer to only certify with the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for the CNR card, and not the entire motherboard. This resulted in a quicker production-to-market time for new motherboards, and allowed mass-production of CNR cards to be used on multiple motherboards. The ACR slot was a competing specification developed by a group of third-party vendors. Its principal advantage over CNR was the backwards-compatible slot layout which allowed it to use both AMR and ACR cards. The same group also developed a physically smaller version, the MDC.

Intel developed the CNR slot to replace its own audio/modem riser (AMR) technology, drawing on two distinct advantages over the AMR slot it replaced; CNR was both capable of being either software based (CPU-controlled) or hardware accelerated (dedicated ASIC), and was plug-and- play compatible. On some motherboards, a CNR slot replaced the last PCI slot, but most motherboard manufacturers engineered boards which allow the CNR and last PCI slot to share the same space. With the integration of components such as ethernet and audio into the motherboard, the CNR is obsolete, and is not found on PC motherboards anymore.

While best known for its high quality performances of the classical repertoire, OD sings music of all genres in many different languages and has since the start in 1853 been widely acknowledged for its ambition to continuously push the envelope of what a male-voice choir can and should do. Since 2008, the choir has been conducted by Cecilia Rydinger Alin, in close cooperation with deputy conductor Folke Alin.  History  Orphei Drängar was founded on October 30th 1853 while the city of Uppsala was isolated in an attempt to stop the spread of the cholera epidemic that was then tormenting Sweden. The blockade was successful in that the city more or less came to be spared from the disease, but also had the effect that the students instead felt that they were about to die of boredom. In an attempt to remedy this, first tenor Jonas Widén gathered twelve students (ten singers, a pianist and a spectator) and the conductor Oscar Arpi in a local Banquet Hall, where they passed the time singing together. One of the songs that was performed was Fredman's Epistle No. 14, \\"Hör, I Orphei Drängar\\" (\\"Hear, ye sons of Orpheus\\") by Carl Michael Bellman, and before the evening was over the singing friends (including the spectator) had formed the Orphei Drängar singing society. The ambitions rose, as composer Jacob Axel Josephson, since 1849 director musices at the Uppsala university, was recruited as the director of the choir in 1854. The first public performance under the choir's own name took place in 1864, and a yearly tradition with spring concerts started in 1870. OD was by that time an established elite choir, that also performed in Stockholm and in Gothenburg. During the latter half of the 19th century, the choir went on tours abroad to Paris (1867, 1878, 1900), Berlin (1898) and has over the years been performing to audiences in many different parts of the world. Orphei Drängar made its first recording during a tour to London in 1907 and performed at the Olympic Games in Paris 1924.  Choir  In the 21st century, Orphei Drängar consists of approximately 80 singers. Admission tests are usually carried out in the beginning of September each year. Yearly recurring concerts are the spring concert in April, the traditional spring song on April 30th, with the Caprice concerts in December.

The book discusses issues within journalism (e.g. biased news, declining quality of content, etc.), as well as weaknesses in the media sector, and new ways to regulate such.  Analysis  In further analysis of identifying the problem with media as it relates to politics is to understand that political science in academia is very much a sideline subject matter that doesn't bare the potential weight should on American politics and elections. The higher education discipline that does deal more with the impact of media bias on politics is communications. Research by Graber and Smith (2005) shows the importance and small change to begin to better understand the impact of the media and politics.Graber, Doris A., and James M. Smith, J. [2005] 2006. \\"Political communication faces the 21st century.\\" Journal of Communication 55(3):479–507. . McChesney references multiple future directions and 10 targets to give political communication scholars better insight into the neglected aspect of the impact and issues facing politics and media in the 21st century. These targets include: * communications policy formulation; * preserving an open marketplace of ideas; * global cultural differences; * media as agents of political socialization; * public information campaigns; * the rhetoric of political leaders; * the rhetoric of negotiations; * learning limitations; and * network analyses. Another powerful impact to U.S. politics has grown from the types of technology used to communicate political information to the masses. We need look no further than our own Facebook or Twitter pages to see positions, news or fake news and quotes from our political leaders taken in and out of context and manipulated to position the posters agenda. The seeds are planted and those seeds are powerful. Shirky (2011) first describes the 2001 impeachment trial of Philippine President Joseph Estrada.Shirky, Clay. 2011. \\"The Political Power of Social Media: Technology, the Public Sphere, and Political Change.\\" Foreign Affairs 90(1):28–41. . . Retrieved 11 May 2020. How mass text messages created crowds of protesters coordinated by text messages that shut down the city of Manila and the response changing the course of the hearing. Shirky continues: > Disciplined and coordinated groups, whether businesses or governments, have > always had an advantage over undisciplined ones: they have an easier time > engaging in collective action because they have way of directing the action > of their members. Social media can compensate for the disadvantages of > undisciplined groups by reducing the costs of coordination. This has effectively changed the ability of smaller group impact on any politically charged environment. Shirky goes on to analyze several attempts by U.S. officials to control, censor or entertain controlling these private environments. In addition, Shirky believes that: > Washington's ability to shape or target these changes is limited. Instead, > Washington should adopt a more general approach, promoting freedom of > speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly every where.

Media bias, rating importance and monetary gain for sensationalizing political controversy verses fact reporting on politics is rampant in our society, the tools by which now normal people can piece together a political view and share it with thousands of people instantly is problematic where it is combined with the extreme mainstream media antics needs to be researched more thoroughly and is at a critical point that begs for reform and understanding not necessarily censorship.

A specialist in the emerging field of spectroscopy, he detected the presence of the rare earth element europium in 1896, and isolated it as the oxide europia in 1901. He helped Marie Curie to confirm the existence of another new element, radium, in 1898. Education Eugène-Anatole Demarçay was born 1 January 1852 at 152 Haussman, Paris. Demarçay studied at the Lycée Condorcet, spent time in England, and in 1870 entered the École Polytechnique in Palaiseau near Paris. There Demarçay studied under Jean-Baptiste Dumas. He traveled in Algeria, Egypt, and India. Following his return, Demarçay served for several years as an assistant to Auguste André Thomas Cahours at the École Polytechnique. In 1876, he studied acetylacetonates in the laboratory of Cahours. In 1880 he completed his dissertation, Sur !es acides tetrique et oxytetrique et leurs homologues (\\"On tetric and oxytetric acids and their counterparts\\" Gauthier-Villars, 1880). Some of his early organic chemistry researches into terpenes and ether were important for the perfume industry. Career Demarçay's interests moved from organic chemistry to organometallics and then to inorganic chemistry. He applied for a professorial position at the Academie des sciences in 1878, but was not accepted. He became particularly interested in studying nitrogen sulfides, publishing three papers in 1880-1881. These compounds appear stable at room temperature, but are sensitive to heat, friction, and shock, and are likely to explode when heated. During an experiment with nitrogen and sulfur, a cast-iron vessel exploded and destroyed the sight in one of his eyes. He established his own private laboratory at 2 Boulevard Berthier, Paris. In 1881-1882, he developed a vacuum system to control temperature during experiments. 1.5 metres high, it consisted of 3 concentric vessels and a compressor driven by a six horsepower gas engine. Temperature in the center vessel could be reduced to -85°C. Demarçay used this to study the volatility of substances such as zinc, cadmium, and gold at low temperatures. Demarçay became a specialist in reading the line patterns of spectroscopy. He developed new techniques for the identification of spectra from rare earth metals. He developed an instrument for obtaining spectra, using an induction coil with pure platinum electrodes to produce a high spark temperature that eliminated impurities that could cause foreign spectral lines. By eliminating sources of error, he made it possible to separate out purer samples of various rare earths than had previously been available. In 1896, he suspected that samples of the recently discovered element samarium were contaminated with another unknown element, predicting that it would be located between samarium and gadolinium. To obtain pure enough samples, he developed a new separation technique involving crystallization of double magnesium nitrate salts. By 1901, he had isolated samples of sufficient purity to confirm the isolation of europium. In 1898 he used his skills of spectroscopy to help Marie and Pierre Curie confirm the isolation of a new element, radium. After extracting polonium from pitchblende they observed that the remaining sample was still radioacte. They consulted Demarçay, who reported a line in the spectrograph indicative of a new element. Awards * 1881, Jecker Prix, Section de Chimie de L' Academie des Sciences for contributions to organic chemistry Family On 14 November 1889 Demarçay married Jeanne Berard (1865-1933) at the Temple du St. Esprit, Paris, in a Protestant wedding. His granddaughter, Mme. Joseph de Carayon Talpayrac, still lived in Paris in 2003. Eugène-Anatole Demarçay died 5 March 1903, at his home at 80 Boulevard Malesherbes, Paris. His brother Jean became executor of his estate, and offered the state of the art equipment from his laboratory to Pierre Curie. Curie eventually arranged for it to be given to rare earths researcher Georges Urbain. Publications *Spectres électriques.

It was formerly known as the Lebor na Nuachongbála \\"Book of Nuachongbáil\\", a monastic site known today as Oughaval. Some fragments of the book, such as the Martyrology of Tallaght, are now in the collection of University College, Dublin.Ms A3 at www.ucd.ie Date and provenance The manuscript is a composite work and more than one hand appears to have been responsible for its production. The principal compiler and scribe was probably Áed Ua Crimthainn,Best, The Book of Leinster, vol 1, p. xv.Hellmuth, \\"Lebor Laignech\\", pp. 1125-6. who was abbot of the monastery of Tír-Dá-Glas on the Shannon, now Terryglass (County Tipperary), and the last abbot of that house for whom we have any record. Internal evidence from the manuscript itself bears witness to Áed's involvement. His signature can be read on f. 32r (p. 313): Aed mac meic Crimthaind ro scrib in leborso 7 ra thinoil a llebraib imdaib (\\"Áed Húa Crimthaind wrote this book and collected it from many books\\"). In a letter copied by a later hand into a bottom margin (p. 288), the bishop of Kildare, Finn mac Gormáin (d. 1160), addresses him as a man of learning (fer léiginn) of the high-king of Leth Moga, the coarb (comarbu lit. 'successor') of Colum mac Crimthainn, and the chief scholar (prímsenchaid) of Leinster. An alternative theory was that by Eugene O'Curry, who suggested that Finn mac Gormáin transcribed or compiled the Book of Leinster for Áed. The manuscript was produced by Aéd and some of his pupils over a long period between 1151 and 1224. From annals recorded in the manuscript we can say it was written between 1151 and 1201, with the bulk of the work probably complete in the 1160s. As Terryglass was burnt down in 1164, the manuscript must have been finalised in another scriptorium. Suggested locations include Stradbally (Co. Loais) and Clonenagh (Co. Laois), the home of Uí Chrimthainn (see below). Eugene O'Curry suggested that the manuscript may have been commissioned by Diarmait Mac Murchada (d. 1171), king of Leinster, who had a stronghold (dún) in Dún Másc, near Oughaval (An Nuachongbáil). Dún Másc passed from Diarmait Mac Murchada to Strongbow, from Strongbow to his daughter Isabel, from Isabel to the Marshal Earls of Pembroke and from there, down several generations through their line. When Meiler fitz Henry established an Augustinian priory in Co. Laois, Oughaval was included in the lands granted to the priory. History A page from The Book of Leinster Nothing certain is known of the manuscript's whereabouts in the next century or so after its completion, but in the 14th century, it came to light at Oughaval. It may have been kept in the vicarage in the intervening years. The Book of Leinster owes its present name to John O'Donovan (d. 1861), who coined it on account of the strong associations of its textual contents with the province of Leinster, and to Robert Atkinson, who adopted it when he published the lithographic facsimile edition. However, it is now commonly accepted that the manuscript was originally known as the Lebor na Nuachongbála, that is the \\"Book of Noghoval\\", now Oughaval (Co. Laois), near Stradbally. This was established by R.I. Best, who observed that several short passages from the Book of Leinster are cited in an early 17th-century manuscript written by Sir James Ware (d. 1666), found today under the shelfmark London, British Library, Add. MS 4821. These extracts are attributed to the \\"Book of Noghoval\\" and were written at a time when Ware stayed at Ballina (Ballyna, Co. Kildare), enjoying the hospitality of Rory O'Moore. His family, the O'Moores (Ó Mhorda), had been lords of Noghoval since the early 15th century if not earlier, and it was probably with their help that he obtained access to the manuscript. The case for identification with the manuscript now known as the Book of Leinster is suggested by the connection of Rory's family to the Uí Chrimthainn, coarbs of Terryglass: his grandfather had a mortgage on Clonenagh, the home of Uí Chrimthainn.Best, The Book of Leinster, vol 1, pp. xi–xvii. Best's suggestion is corroborated by evidence from Dublin, Royal Irish Academy MS B. iv. 2, also of the early 17th century. As Rudolf Thurneysen noted, the scribe copied several texts from the Book of Leinster, identifying his source as the \\"Leabhar na h-Uachongbála\\", presumably for Leabhar na Nuachongbála (\\"Book of Noughaval\\").Thurneysen, Die irische Helden- und Königsage bis zum 17. Jahrhundert, p. 34. Third, in the 14th century, the Book of Leinster was located at Stradbally (Co.

Kennedy, passed by the 88th United States Congress, and signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson. The act became law on February 26, 1964. Kennedy proposed the bill on the advice of Keynesian economist Walter Heller, who believed that temporary deficit spending would boost economic growth. The act was initially blocked by conservatives like Senator Harry F. Byrd, but Lyndon Johnson was able to guide it through Congress after the assassination of Kennedy in November 1963. The act cut federal income taxes by approximately twenty percent across the board, and the top federal income tax rate fell from 91 percent to 70 percent. The act also reduced the corporate tax from 52 percent to 48 percent and created a minimum standard deduction. Summary of provisions The Office of Tax Analysis of the United States Department of the Treasury summarized the tax changes as follows: > * reduced top marginal rate (on income over $100,000, roughly $770,000 in > 2015 dollars, for individuals; and over $180,000; roughly $1,380,000 in 2015 > dollars, for heads of households) from 91% to 70% * reduced corporate tax > rate from 52% to 48% * phased-in acceleration of corporate estimated tax > payments (through 1970) * created minimum standard deduction of $300 + > $100/exemption (total $1,000 max) Passage On the advice of Walter Heller, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, President John F. Kennedy proposed a tax cut designed to help spur economic growth. Kennedy believed that the tax cut would stimulate consumer demand, which in turn would lead to higher economic growth, lower unemployment, and increased federal revenues. Kennedy's support for a tax cut reflected his conversion to Keynesian economics, which favored temporary deficit spending in order to boost economic growth. In January 1963, Kennedy presented Congress with a tax proposal that would reduce the top marginal tax rate from 91 percent to 65 percent, and lower the corporate tax rate from 52 percent to 47 percent; in total, the cut was projected to decrease income taxes by about $10 billion and corporate taxes by about $3.5 billion. The plan also included reforms designed to reduce the impact of itemized deductions, as well as provisions to help the elderly and handicapped. Conservatives revolted at giving Kennedy a key legislative victory before the election of 1964 and blocked the bill in Congress. Lyndon B. Johnson succeeded Kennedy as president after the latter was assassinated in November 1963. After Johnson agreed to decrease the total federal budget to under $100 billion, powerful conservative Senator Harry F. Byrd dropped his opposition to a tax cut, clearing the way for its passage as the Revenue Act of 1964. Johnson signed the bill into law on February 26, 1964. Passage of the long-stalled tax cut facilitated efforts to move ahead on the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Impact The stated goals of the tax cuts were to raise personal incomes, increase consumption, and increase capital investments. Evidence shows that these goals were exceeded by large degree with the combination of tax cuts and domestic spending programs President Johnson advocated, such as Medicare. Unemployment fell from 5.2% in 1964 to 4.5% in 1965, and fell to 3.8% in 1966. Initial estimates predicted a loss of revenue as a result of the tax cuts, however, tax revenue increased in 1964 and 1965.

His son, also named Val Lewton, was a painter and exhibition designer. Early life Lewton was born Vladimir Ivanovich Hofschneider (, , both with surname Leventon) in Yalta, Imperial Russia (now in Ukraine), in 1904. He was of Jewish descent, the son of moneylender Max Hofschneider and Anna \\"Nina\\" Leventon, a pharmacist's daughter. The family converted to Christianity.Val Lewton: The Man in the Shadows, 2007 documentary by Martin Scorsese He was nephew of actress Alla Nazimova. His mother left his father and moved to Berlin, taking their two children with her. In 1909, they emigrated to the United States as second cabin class passengers on board the S/S Amerika, which sailed from Hamburg, 29 April, and arrived in New York, 8 May; they were listed as Anna, Olga and Vladimir Hofschneider. In America, he eventually changed his name to Wladimir Ivan Lewton, which came to be abbreviated as Val Lewton. Upon arrival in New York, Anna Hofschnedier and her children joined the household of her famous sister, Alla Nazimova, in Rye, New York; she then reverted to her maiden name Lewton and earned her living by writing for the films. She and her children later moved to suburban Port Chester, New York. He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in a federal court in Los Angeles as Wladimir Ivan Lewton in June 1941. In 1920, when Lewton was 16, he lost his job as a society reporter for the Darien-Stamford Review after it was discovered that a story he wrote about a truckload of kosher chickens dying in a New York heat wave was a total fabrication. He went on to study journalism at Columbia University and authored 18 works of nonfiction, fiction, and poetry. Career In 1932, he wrote the best-selling pulp novel No Bed of Her Own, which was later used for the film No Man of Her Own, with Clark Gable and Carole Lombard.In 1933, Lewton clandestinely published Grushenka: Three Times a Woman, an erotic novel whose publication would have subjected Lewton to criminal penalties given the mores of the time. Grushenka purported to be a translation from the Russian and brought from the Soviet Union, but this was a ruse to protect the book's real author. https://parisolympiapress.com/page/2/ Lewton worked as a writer at MGM's Alice Roberts publicity office in New York City, providing novelizations of popular movies for serialization in magazines, which were sometimes later collected into book form. He also wrote promotional copy. He quit this position after the success of No Bed of Her Own, but when three later novels that same year failed to succeed, he journeyed to Hollywood for a job writing a screen treatment of Gogol's Taras Bulba for David O. Selznick. The connection for this job came through Lewton's mother, Nina. Though a film of Taras Bulba did not follow, Lewton was hired by MGM to work as a publicist and assistant to Selznick. His first screen credit was \\"revolutionary sequences arranged by\\" in David O. Selznick's 1935 version of A Tale of Two Cities. Lewton also worked as an uncredited writer for Selznick's Gone with the Wind, including writing the scene where the camera pulls back to reveal hundreds of wounded soldiers at the Atlanta depot. Lewton also worked for Selznick as a story editor, a scout for discovering literary properties for Selznick's studio, and a go-between with the Hollywood censorship system. On the documentary The Making of Gone With the Wind, Lewton is described by another Selznick employee as warning that Gone With the Wind was unfilmable and that Selznick would be making \\"the mistake of his life\\" trying to make a successful movie of it. In 1942, Lewton was named head of the horror unit at RKO studios at a salary of US$250 per week. He would have to follow three rules: each film had to come in under a US$150,000 budget, each was to run under 75 minutes, and Lewton's supervisors would supply the film titles. Lewton's first production was Cat People, released in 1942. The film was directed by Jacques Tourneur, who subsequently also directed I Walked With a Zombie and The Leopard Man for Lewton. Made for US$134,000, the film went on to earn nearly US$4 million and was the top moneymaker for RKO that year. This success enabled Lewton to make his next films with relatively little studio interference, allowing him to fulfill his vision despite the sensationalistic film titles he was given, focusing on ominous suggestion and themes of existential ambivalence. Lewton always wrote the final draft of the screenplays for his films, but avoided on-screen co-writing credits except in two cases, The Body Snatcher and Bedlam, for which he used the pseudonym \\"Carlos Keith,\\" which he had previously used for the novels 4 Wives, A Laughing Woman, This Fool, Passion, and Where the Cobra Sings. After RKO promoted Tourneur to A-films, Lewton gave first directing opportunities to Robert Wise and Mark Robson. Between 1945 and 1946, Boris Karloff appeared in three films for RKO produced by Lewton: Isle of the Dead, The Body Snatcher, and Bedlam. In a 1946 interview with Louis Berg of the Los Angeles Times, Karloff credited Lewton with saving him from what Karloff saw as the overextended Frankenstein franchise at Universal Pictures. Berg wrote, \\"Mr. Karloff has great love and respect for Mr. Lewton as the man who rescued him from the living dead and restored, so to speak, his soul.\\" When RKO head and Lewton supporter Charles Koerner died in 1946, the studio went through personnel and management upheavals, ultimately leaving Lewton unemployed and in ill health after suffering a minor heart attack. Through connections, he rewrote an unused screenplay based upon the life of Lucrezia Borgia. Actress Paulette Goddard at Paramount Studios particularly liked Lewton's treatment, and in exchange for the script Lewton was given employment through July 1948. (The Goddard film Bride of Vengeance, heavily rewritten, was released in 1949.) While at Paramount, Lewton also produced the film My Own True Love, released in 1949. Following his association with Paramount, Lewton worked again for MGM, where he produced the Deborah Kerr film Please Believe Me, released in 1950. During this time, Lewton attempted to start an independent production company with former protégés Wise and Robson, but when a disagreement over which property to produce first arose, Lewton was kicked out. Lewton spent time at home working on a screenplay about the famous American Revolutionary War battles at Fort Ticonderoga. Universal Studios made an offer on the work, and though the screenplay was not used, Lewton was given producer duties on the film Apache Drums, released in 1951. This film is usually considered the film most like Lewton's earlier RKO horror films. Death and legacy Hollywood producer Stanley Kramer tendered an offer to Lewton to work as an assistant producing a series of films at Columbia Studios. Lewton resigned at Universal and began preparation to work on the film My Six Convicts, but after suffering gallstone problems, he had the first of two heart attacks which weakened him so much that he died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in 1951 at the age of 46. The following year, Kirk Douglas appeared in The Bad and the Beautiful; his character was partly based on Lewton. A number of books and two documentaries on Lewton have been produced. A documentary film, Martin Scorsese Presents: Val Lewton – The Man in the Shadows, was released in 2007. In May 2017, \\"The Secret History Of Hollywood\\", a podcast biopic series, began an eleven-part season on his life and work featuring Mark Gatiss.

The Walker circulation is seen at the surface as easterly trade winds which move water and air warmed by the sun towards the west. The western side of the equatorial Pacific is characterized by warm, wet low pressure weather as the collected moisture is dumped in the form of typhoons and thunderstorms. The ocean is some 60 cm higher in the western Pacific as the result of this motion. The water and air are returned to the east. Both are now much cooler, and the air is much drier. An El Niño episode is characterised by a breakdown of this water and air cycle, resulting in relatively warm water and moist air in the eastern Pacific. The Walker circulation, also known as the Walker cell, is a conceptual model of the air flow in the tropics in the lower atmosphere (troposphere). According to this model, parcels of air follow a closed circulation in the zonal and vertical directions. This circulation, which is roughly consistent with observations, is caused by differences in heat distribution between ocean and land. It was discovered by Gilbert Walker. In addition to motions in the zonal and vertical direction the tropical atmosphere also has considerable motion in the meridional direction as part of, for example, the Hadley Circulation. The term \\"Walker circulation\\" was coined in 1969 by the Norwegian-American meteorologist Jacob Bjerknes.Bjerknes, J. (March 1969) \\"Atmospheric teleconnections from the equatorial Pacific,\\" Monthly Weather Review, 97 (3) : 163–172. From pp. 167–168: \\"It seems reasonalble to assume that it is the gradient of sea temperature along the Equator which is the cause of the thermal circulation entered in figure 8. Hereafter, in the present article that circulation will be referred to as the \\"Walker Circulation\\" since it can be shown to be an important part of the mechanism of Walker's \\"Southern Oscillation.\\" \\" Available at: N.O.A.A. Walker's methodology Gilbert Walker was an established applied mathematician at the University of Cambridge when he became director-general of observatories in India in 1904. While there, he studied the characteristics of the Indian Ocean monsoon, the failure of whose rains had brought severe famine to the country in 1899. Analyzing vast amounts of weather data from India and the rest of the world, over the next fifteen years he published the first descriptions of the great seesaw oscillation of atmospheric pressure between the Indian and Pacific Ocean, and its correlation to temperature and rainfall patterns across much of the Earth's tropical regions, including India. He also worked with the Indian Meteorological Department especially in linking the monsoon with Southern Oscillation phenomenon. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Star of India in 1911. Walker determined that the time scale of a year (used by many studying the atmosphere) was unsuitable because geospatial relationships could be entirely different depending on the season. Thus, Walker broke his temporal analysis into December–February, March–May, June–August, and September–November. Walker then selected a number of \\"centers of action\\", which included areas such as the Indian Peninsula. The centers were in the hearts of regions with either permanent or seasonal high and low pressures. He also added points for regions where rainfall, wind or temperature was an important control. He examined the relationships of the summer and winter values of pressure and rainfall, first focusing on summer and winter values, and later extending his work to the spring and autumn. He concludes that variations in temperature are generally governed by variations in pressure and rainfall. It had previously been suggested that sunspots could be the cause of the temperature variations, but Walker argued against this conclusion by showing monthly correlations of sunspots with temperature, winds, cloud cover, and rain that were inconsistent. Walker made it a point to publish all of his correlation findings, both of relationships found to be important as well as relationships that were found to be unimportant. He did this for the purpose of dissuading researchers from focusing on correlations that did not exist. Oceanic effects Average equatorial Pacific temperatures Graph showing a tropical ocean thermocline (depth vs. temperature). Note the rapid change between 100 and 1000 meters. The temperature is nearly constant after 1500 meters depth. The Walker Circulations of the tropical Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic basins result in westerly surface winds in Northern Summer in the first basin and easterly winds in the second and third basins. As a result, the temperature structure of the three oceans display dramatic asymmetries. The equatorial Pacific and Atlantic both have cool surface temperatures in Northern Summer in the east, while cooler surface temperatures prevail only in the western Indian Ocean. These changes in surface temperature reflect changes in the depth of the thermocline. Changes in the Walker Circulation with time occur in conjunction with changes in surface temperature. Some of these changes are forced externally, such as the seasonal shift of the Sun into the Northern Hemisphere in summer. Other changes appear to be the result of coupled ocean- atmosphere feedback in which, for example, easterly winds cause the sea surface temperature to fall in the east, enhancing the zonal heat contrast and hence intensifying easterly winds across the basin. These enhanced easterlies induce more equatorial upwelling and raise the thermocline in the east, amplifying the initial cooling by the southerlies. This coupled ocean- atmosphere feedback was originally proposed by Bjerknes. From an oceanographic point of view, the equatorial cold tongue is caused by easterly winds. Were the earth climate symmetric about the equator, cross-equatorial wind would vanish, and the cold tongue would be much weaker and have a very different zonal structure than is observed today.Ocean-atmosphere interaction in the making of the Walker circulation and equatorial cold tongue The Walker cell is indirectly related to upwelling off the coasts of Peru and Ecuador. This brings nutrient-rich cold water to the surface, increasing fishing stocks.Jennings, S., Kaiser, M.J., Reynolds, J.D. (2001) \\"Marine Fisheries Ecology.\\" Oxford: Blackwell Science Ltd. El Niño The Walker circulation is caused by the pressure gradient force that results from a high pressure system over the eastern Pacific Ocean and a low pressure system over Indonesia. The Walker circulation causes an upwelling of cold deep sea water, thus cooling the sea surface. El Niño results when this circulation decreases or stops, as the impaired or inhibited circulation causes the ocean surface to warm to above average temperatures. A markedly increased Walker circulation causes a La Niña by intensifying the upwelling of cold deep sea water; which cools the sea surface to below average temperatures. A scientific study published in May 2006 in the journal Nature indicates that the Walker circulation has been slowing since the mid-19th century. The authors argue that global warming is a likely causative factor in the weakening of the wind pattern.A tropical atmospheric circulation slow-down However, a 2011 study from The Twentieth Century Reanalysis Project shows that, aside from El Niño Southern Oscillation cycles, the overall speed and direction of the Walker circulation remained steady between 1871 and 2008.The Twentieth Century Reanalysis Project.

He was the founder of the National Hispanic Council of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, He was also Former Superintendent of the Idaho School for the Deaf and the Blind, Sequoia School for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (AZ) and Marie Katzenbach School for the Deaf (NJ). He is the second Deaf Hispanic/Latino to receive a doctorate degree (Dr. Robert Davila was the first) and the first to receive a doctorate from Gallaudet University. Early years Ramos' mother, Maria Monserrate, was born in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico. His father, Miguel Angel Ramos, was born in Vieques, Puerto Rico. After his parents were married they moved to New York City. When Ramos mother got pregnant with Angel, her husband demanded that she have an abortion or he would divorce her. Ramos' mother went ahead and gave birth to Angel and shortly afterwards his parents got divorced. As result, he and his sister were raised solely by his mother, who worked as a seamstress. They grew up in the housing projects of NYC, in Manhattan, along with a number of relatives. Ramos attended public school, leading a normal child's life until 1959 when, while nine years old, he woke up one morning and could not hear. As a Catholic and altar boy, he thought God had punished him and hid his hearing loss from his mother for two years. He succeeded in school since he could already read and write in English and Spanish, and was able to follow directions on the classroom blackboard and by reading his textbooks carefully. By 1961, he had learned to lip-read and this helped him to get by elementary school all the way to high school. Academic education Despite being poor and being raised by a single parent, Ramos was able to pursue a college education thanks to financial support from the NY Division of Vocational Rehabilitation. He attended and graduated from Manhattan College in 1971 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics. Unable to find employment due to being Deaf, he drove a taxi in NYC and until he was hired as a gym supervisor at Lexington School for the Deaf in NY-- with his only pay being room and board. Eventually, he became a Teacher Assistant at St. Joseph's School for the Deaf. Dissatisfied with being a Teacher Assistant and wanting a better future, Ramos applied for, and received, financial assistance from the NY Division of Vocational Rehabilitation to pursue a master's degree. He attended the State University of New York at Genesio where he earned a Master of Science degree in Education of the Deaf. After working at the New York School for the Deaf as a math teacher for three years, he received a full scholarship to the National Leadership Program at the California State University at Northridge where he earned a second master's degree in Educational Administration. After working at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf and the Southwest Collegiate Institute for the Deaf for several years, he received another scholarship to pursue a doctorate degree in Educational Administration and Supervision from Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C.. He became the first, and only, Deaf Hispanic/Latino to receive a doctorate degree from Gallaudet in 1997. Ramos held a teaching position at Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas and was Director of the Gallaudet University Regional Center in Texas. During that time he received a Fulbright Scholar Award and was assigned to Colombia to improve the delivery of educational services to students who are Deaf and hard of hearing. He is the founder the National Hispanic Council of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing in Washington, D.C.. Superintendent of the Idaho School for the Deaf and the Blind On August 1, 2001, Ramos was hired as Superintendent of the Idaho School for the Deaf and the Blind, located in Gooding, Idaho. The Executive Director of the Idaho State Board of Education, Dr. Gregory Fitch, instructed Dr. Ramos to change the \\"custodial\\" school to an \\"educational\\" school. After Dr. Fitch resigned as Executive Director, the old timers at the school - who were dissatisfied with the changes Ramos was making at the school and preferred the old custodial model - convinced the Idaho State Board of Education (BOE) to take steps to remove Dr. Ramos as superintendent, On July 30, 2003, the State BOE put Dr. Ramos on administrative leave due to charges that he illegally sold state surplus property, that he had a conflict of interest in preferential hiring, and the appearances of retaliation against detractors. Supporters of Dr. Ramos stated that he raised the bar of education in the school and in September 2003, a group of students demonstrated on the school lawn in support of Dr. Ramos. After a year long administrative leave and court hearing, Dr. Ramos was exonerated of all charges. The State Board of Education was ordered to reinstate Dr. Ramos as superintendent and to support Dr. Ramos in his efforts to change the school from a custodial school to an educational school. Laden with a legal bill of $80,000, Dr. Ramos agreed not to sue the State Board of Education for false allegations in exchange for a $180,000 settlement and resigning his position as superintendent. He resigned, paid his lawyers, and moved to Arizona. Later years After moving to Arizona In 2004, Dr. Ramos was appointed Superintendent of Sequoia School for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, a charter school in Arizona with two campuses -- in Mesa and Phoenix. Dr. Ramos transformed the school from an underperforming school to one of the few \\"Performing\\" schools for students who are Deaf and hard of hearing in the country. For his efforts in transforming SSDHH into a \\"Performing\\" school, he was recognized as Administrator of the Year and Principal of the Year. While Superintendent, the then Governor of Arizona, Janet Napolitano, appointed Dr. Ramos as a commissioner on the Arizona Commission for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing. The Assistant Secretary of Education later appointed Dr. Ramos to the National Technical Institute for the Deaf National Advisory Group. After 7 successful years at SSDHH and looking for another challenge, on July 30, 2011, the NJ Commissioner of Education, Dr. Christopher Cerf, appointed Dr. Ramos as Superintendent of the Marie Katzenbach School for the Deaf (MKSD) in NJ, with instructions to transformed to school into an educational school. For three years he worked closely with Commissioner Cerf to transform the school until Cerf's resignation in 2015. With Cerf's departure, the vision for MKSD changed and the focus was on bureaucracy instead of educating the students. Unwilling to work in this new climate, Dr. Ramos retired on June 30, 2015. Shortly after his retirement, Dr. Ramos created the first and only virtual school for students who are Deaf and hard of hearing - The Princeton School - with the goal of providing supplemental assistance to schools and VR in their effort to help these students be successful adults. Ramos currently is the principal of the Hawaii School for the Deaf and the Blind. Written Work In 2003, Dr. Ramos published the book \\"Triumph of the Spirit: The DPN Chronicle\\", about the historic situation of deaf students at Gallaudet University.

The Chief left Chicago at 10am with connecting sleepers from the 2Oth Limited and Broadway for LA and also Kansas City and Denver. Reaching LA before midnight the following day, the Chief was the only US train offering one night transit Chicago- LA westbound and indeed two night, transcontinental travel from NY to LA. The Chief was inaugurated as an all-Pullman limited train to supplement the road's California Limited, with a surcharge of USD $10.00 for an end-to-end trip. The heavyweight began its first run from both ends of the line, simultaneously, on November 14, 1926, scheduled 63 hours each way between Chicago and Los Angeles, five hours faster than the California Limited. (The Overland Limited, Los Angeles Limited and Golden State Limited began their extra-fare 63-hour schedules between Chicago and California the same day.) The Chief was a success, dubbed \\"Extra Fast-Extra Fine-Extra Fare\\" though it failed to relieve traffic on the California Limited. The Chief became famous as a \\"rolling boudoir\\" for film stars and Hollywood executives. In 1954 the Chief reduced its schedule to, around 37hrs equal to its cousins, the Super Chief and El Capitan, and would ultimately drop the extra fare requirement as well. The Chief leaving Chicago in the morning ran to LA thru, 2 days and 1 night Condensed Schedule Passenger Services, Santa Fe Railway, Feb 16 1968, p1-4 while the Super Chief was essentially a night train, leaving Chicago in the evening and running thu two nights and 1 day, to arrive in LA in the morning. The last 60 miles run thru Los Angeles suburbs, was slow and on both the Chief arriving at night and the Super Chief in the morning, many passengers detrained,faster, earlier and more privately at San Bernardino, or Pasadena. The Chief would have been the \\"crown jewel\\" of most railroads' passenger fleets. But it did not survive the national decline in passenger demand,due to the safer faster transport provided by the jet 707 and DC8 which overcome airlines previous inferior 8hr LA-Chicago flights on propellor DC6 and Constellations at 300mph, only 3 mile high with rough and dangerous crossing of the Grand Canyon. Ironically fear of the Grand Canyon, kept many stars on the Chief in the 1950s and early 1960s and combined with the loss of most US Rail companies contract with US Post in 1967, Santa Fe, recommended all but it's Super Chief, SF Chief, Texas Chief and San Diegans he discontinued. In particular Santa Fe informed the ICC it could not afford to run 4 daily Chicago- California services. To Santa Fe shock the ICC ruled the all stops, common carrier Grand Canyon be continued rather than the Chief, which made its last run was on May 15, 1968. The San Francisco Chief was however rescheduled into the Chief's 10am departure slot out of Chicago and with a LA connection from the Grand Canyon at Barstow, offered 44hr transit to LA, or 41.5hrs to a shuttle transfer from San Bernardino or Bakersfield l.

That November four extra-fare ($10) all-Pullman trains started running on 63-hour schedules: the Chief, the Los Angeles Limited via Salt Lake, the Golden State Limited via El Paso, and the Overland Limited to San Francisco. In 1928 the four eastward trains dropped to 61 hours 15 minutes to improve connections at Chicago. In June 1929 the Chief and Overland Limited schedules dropped to 58 hours each way, leaving Chicago at 11:15 AM/11:50 AM and Los Angeles/San Francisco at 9:45 PM/9:40 PM. The standard-fare schedule then became 63 hours westward and 61-1/4 eastward on seven routes from Chicago to the Coast (trains to Seattle now matching the standard-fare California trains). The Los Angeles Limited and Golden State Limited retained their 1928 schedules and so dropped their extra fares. In 1931 the Overland Limited dropped its extra fare and combined with the 63-hour train on its route; the Chief was the only extra fare transcon train thereafter, until the streamliners. In February 1936 it was scheduled 53 hours 45 minutes to Los Angeles, compared to 61 hours for the Los Angeles Limited, Golden State Ltd, and California Ltd. In May 1936 Union Pacific opened high speed Chicago - Los Angeles service with its City of Los Angeles Diesel streamliner. In December 1937 the original City of Los Angeles train was replaced by a full-sized 14 car train. The schedule was doubled to 10 times monthly in July 1938.

Quirin has been cited as a precedent for the trial by military commission of any unlawful combatant against the United States. It was argued July 29 and July 30, 1942, and decided July 31, 1942, with an extended opinion filed October 29, 1942. This decision states in part that: CaseBackground= Richard Quirin The eight men involved in the case were Ernest Peter Burger, George John Dasch, Herbert Hans Haupt, Heinrich Heinck, Edward Kerling, Herman Neubauer, Richard Quirin and Werner Thiel. Burger and Haupt were U.S. citizens. (317 U.S. 1) All were born in Germany and all had lived in the United States. All returned to Germany between 1933 and 1941. After the declaration of war between the United States and Nazi Germany in December 1941 following the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, they received training at a sabotage school near Berlin, where they were instructed in the use of explosives and in methods of secret writing. Burger, Dasch, Heinck and Quirin traveled from occupied France by German submarine U-202 to Amagansett Beach, Long Island, New York, landing in the hours of darkness, on June 13, 1942. The remaining four boarded the German submarine U-584 which carried them from France to Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. On June 16, 1942, they came ashore during the hours of darkness. All eight wore full or partial German military uniforms so that if they were captured upon landing, they would be entitled to prisoner-of-war status rather than being treated as spies. The Long Island group was noticed by Coast Guard beach patrolman John C. Cullen, whom the saboteurs attempted to bribe with $260. Cullen returned to his station and sounded the alarm. The two groups promptly disposed of uniforms and proceeded in civilian dress to New York City and Jacksonville, Florida, respectively, and from there to other points in the United States. All had received instructions in Germany from an officer of the German High Command to destroy war industries and other key targets in the United States, for which they or their relatives in Germany were to receive salary payments from the German government. Upon landing, Dasch and Burger turned themselves in to the Federal Bureau of Investigation with some difficulty, since the FBI did not believe them immediately. They convinced the FBI that they were telling the truth and the remaining six were taken into custody in New York and Chicago, Illinois by FBI agents. The FBI had no leads until Dasch gave his exaggerated and romanticized version in Washington, D.C. =Military tribunal= On July 2, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Proclamation 2561 establishing a military tribunal to prosecute the Germans.Proclamation 2561 – Denying Certain Enemies Access to the Courts Placed before a seven-member military commission, the Germans were charged with: # violating the law of war; # violating Article 81 of the Articles of War, defining the offense of corresponding with or giving intelligence to the enemy; # violating Article 82 of the Articles of War, defining the offense of spying; # conspiracy to commit the offenses alleged in the first three charges. From July 8 to August 1, 1942, the trial took place in Assembly Hall #1 on the fifth floor of the Department of Justice building in Washington D.C. On August 3, 1942, two days after the trial ended, all eight were found guilty and sentenced to death. Roosevelt later commuted the death sentence of Dasch to 30 years in prison and the sentence of Burger to life in prison, as they had both confessed and assisted in capturing the others. Indeed, it was Dasch who approached the FBI, offering to turn the men in, which he then did. Burger was part of the plot to turn on the others and cooperated with the FBI extensively. The remaining six were executed in the electric chair on the third floor of the District of Columbia jail on August 8 and buried in a potter's field called Blue Plains in the Anacostia area of Washington. In 1948, Dasch and Burger were released by President Harry S. Truman and deported to the American Zone of occupied Germany. Dasch spent the remaining years of his life trying to return to the U.S. One time, a visa application was sent to J. Edgar Hoover by the State Department on Dasch's behalf. Hoover stated that the idea of giving Dasch a visa was \\"outrageous\\" and promptly denied it. Dasch died – still in Germany – in 1992. =Constitutionality of military tribunals= Throughout the trial, Roosevelt's decision of creating a military tribunal to prosecute the Germans was challenged by Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Royall, who was appointed to defend the Germans. Royall said that Roosevelt had no right to create a military tribunal to try his clients, citing Ex parte Milligan (1866), a case in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the federal government could not establish military tribunals to try civilians in areas where civilian courts were functioning, even during wartime. Since civilian courts were functioning in Washington D.C., he argued that the case involving the Germans should be heard there. Attorney General Francis Biddle, who was appointed as a prosecutor of the case, responded that the clients who, acting on behalf of the German government, secretly entered into U.S. territory without proper uniforms in time of war for the purpose of committing hostile acts, were not entitled to have access to civilian courts. Biddle stated that, \\"This is not a trial of offenses of law of the civil courts, but is a trial of the offenses of the law of war, which is not recognizable by the civil courts. It is the trial, as alleged in the charges, of certain enemies who crossed our borders ... and who crossed in disguise and landed here ... They are exactly and precisely in the same position as armed forces invading this country.\\" Royall asserted that there was no evidence to prove that the Germans would have followed through with their plans. They had not been trained for espionage and sabotage, had only vague contacts through which to communicate with Germany, and had no plans to return home until after the war. Biddle rebutted this argument, citing the case of British Major John André, who was executed as a spy by the Continental Army for passing through American lines to meet with American officer Benedict Arnold during the American Revolutionary War.The Atlantic February 2002: The Keystone Kommandos Royall, along with his clients, then petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus demanding that the Germans were entitled to trial by jury guaranteed by the U.S. Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Though the U.S. Supreme Court had been adjourned for the summer, it convened in a special session on July 29, 1942, to consider the matter. Justice Frank Murphy, an Army officer at the time, recused himself. Royall argued that the German landings at New York and Florida could not be characterized as \\"zones of military operation\\" and contended that there was no combat there or plausible threat of invasion by approaching enemy forces. He argued that civilian courts were functioning, and under the circumstances, they were the appropriate venue for the case to be heard. Biddle responded that the U.S. and Germany were at war and cited the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 which stated: On July 31, the Supreme Court unanimously denied Royall's appeal, writing, \\"The military commission was lawfully constituted ... petitioners are held in lawful custody for trial before the military commission and have not shown cause for being discharged by writ of habeas corpus.\\"Military Tribunals =Supreme Court decision= The Supreme Court had issued its decision on July 31, 1942, but did not release a full opinion until October 29, 1942. In this decision, the Court held that (1) That the charges preferred against petitioners on which they are being tried by military commission appointed by the order of the President of July 2, 1942, allege an offense or offenses which the President is authorized to order tried before a military commission. (2) That the military commission was lawfully constituted. (3) That petitioners are held in lawful custody, for trial before the military commission, and have not shown cause for being discharged by writ of habeas corpus. The motions for leave to file petitions for writs of habeas corpus are denied. The Court ruled that the German saboteurs had no right to be given access to civilian courts because they were \\"plainly within the ultimate boundaries of the jurisdiction of military tribunals, and were held in good faith for trial by military commission, charged with being enemies who, with the purpose of destroying war materials and utilities, entered or after entry remained in our territory without uniform — an offense against the law of war. Those particular acts constitute an offense against the law of war which the Constitution authorizes to be tried by military commission.\\" It held that while lawful combatants may be captured and held as prisoners of war, unlawful combatants face harsher circumstances such as being sentenced to prison terms or put to death. The Court also drew a distinction between the cases of Milligan and Quirin. In the Milligan case, Lambdin P. Milligan, although conspiring to commit sabotage in aid of the Confederate cause, was a civilian resident of Indiana, one of the many Union states engaged in a Civil War against the Confederacy, had not had a residence in a Confederate state, was not a part of or associated with the Confederate armed forces, and thus couldn't be tried by a military tribunal in areas where civilian courts were operating. On the other hand, in the Quirin case, the Germans were part of or associated with the German armed forces, entered into U.S. territory without proper uniforms in time of war for the purpose of gathering intelligence or waging war by destruction of life or property, and thus were liable to be tried by a military tribunal.Judicial Review for Enemy Fighters: The Court's Fateful Turn in Ex parte Quirin, the Nazi Saboteur Case Haupt and Burger argued that as U.S. citizens, they should not have their writs of habeas corpus suspended but the Court ruled that \\"[c]itizenship in the United States of an enemy belligerent does not relieve him from the consequences of a belligerency which is unlawful because in violation of the law of war.\\"317 U.S. 1, 37. It also stated that \\"citizens who associate themselves with the military arm of an enemy government, and with its aid, guidance, and direction enter this country bent on hostile acts are enemy belligerents within the meaning of the Hague Convention and the law of war.\\"317 U.S. 1, 38. Furthermore, the Court ruled that the president's proclamation was a lawful order because it was in fact recognized by Congress in Articles 15, 38, and 46 of the Articles of War. In explaining the role of Congress, Chief Justice Harlan Stone held that: =Decision controversy= Although the court issued a unanimous opinion in Quirin, the road to the final decision was marked by disagreement. Justice Douglas wrote that it was unfortunate that the court agreed to take the case. He stated that \\"while it was easy to agree on the original per curiam, we almost fell apart when it came to write the views.\\"William O. Douglas, The Court Years, 1939–1975, at 138–39 (New York: Vintage Books,1981) Chief Justice Stone, for his part, was very concerned with the court's reputation, specifically because he did not want the court to be perceived as just standing by while six men were executed. He pushed for a unanimous opinion. Despite Stone's views, Justice Robert H. Jackson wrote a concurring draft opinion, expressing his disagreement with portions of the Court's opinion. Over time, his concurring draft got longer and longer and evolved into a typewritten memorandum.Military Tribunal: Quirin Precedent by Louis Fisher in the March 22, 2002 \\"Congressional Research Report\\" for Congress. This memorandum was written two years before his dissent in Korematsu v. United States and a decade before his famous concurrence in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer. (Jackson, J., concurring). It provides insight into Jackson's views on the scope of the President's constitutional war powers. The controversy has been revived, and has had legal implications during the War on Terror of the first decade of the 21st century.Brief of Legal Scholars and Historians as Amici Curiae in Support of Petitioner, Salim Ahmed Hamdan, v Donald H. Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense, et al., No. 05-184 =Justice Jackson's draft opinion= In his draft opinion, Jackson attributed sweeping powers to the President. He concluded that (1) the President has the inherent authority to create military tribunals, (2) this authority could not be regulated by Congress, and (3) this power was by virtue of his power as Commander-in-Chief. Jackson stated, \\"I think the Court's decision of the question whether it complied with the Articles of War is uncalled for. The history and the language of the Articles are to me a plain demonstration that they are clearly inapplicable to this case and it is abundantly clear to me that it is well within the war powers of the President to create a non- statutory military tribunal of the sort here in question.\\" He further wrote \\"The right to convene such an advisory committee of his staff as a 'military commission' for the discharge of his duties toward prisoners of war is one that follows from his position as commander in chief.\\" Nonetheless, Jackson maintained that the President's power should be \\"discharged, of course, in the light of any obligation undertaken by our country under treaties or conventions or under customs and usages so generally accepted as to constitute the laws of warfare.\\" More importantly, Jackson also questioned the Court's ability to review the President's actions. He concluded that dealing with enemy prisoners of war was a foreign policy issue that touched upon issues of national security and political questions that were wholly out of the province of the judiciary. Jackson also stated that granting enemy combatants individual rights against military authorities would not be reciprocated in other countries. Jackson analyzed both the history and purposes of the Articles of War to conclude that the Articles are not applicable to enemy combatants – rather, they were meant to protect U.S. civilians in times of military government. Although it would seem that his draft opinion is at odds with his later views of the President's war powers, specifically in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer in which he interpreted Congress's ability to restrict the President's powers rather generously, there are substantive differences between the two cases. Youngstown concerned an exercise of presidential power in a domestic matter against civilians in an undeclared war. It was very different from the scenario present in Quirin, in which the President seized enemy combatants and did not address the internal functioning of the government. In Quirin, Jackson ultimately believed it was a mistake for the Court to review military judgments in times of war and he solidified this position in his dissent in Korematsu v. United States. In that case, he stated \\"in the very nature of things military decisions are not susceptible of intelligent judicial appraisal.\\". His dissent in Korematsu expresses his belief that bringing those affected by military orders under the protection of the constitution would be a dangerous precedent and that the court should neither execute nor review such orders. He was afraid that the \\"emergency that justified the classification (in Korematsu) would eventually be forgotten, leaving the constitutionality of the classification as the lesson of the case.\\"Dennis J. Hutchinson, \\"The Achilles Heel\\" of the Constitution: Justice Jackson and the Japanese Exclusion Cases, 2002 Sup. Ct. Rev. 455, 488. Jackson believed the court would never be able to perform its duty if it joined the executive in making constitutional shortcuts. In the end, Justice Jackson withdrew his concurring opinion, perhaps in response to Justice Stone, or perhaps in response to Justice Felix Frankfurter's Soliloquy. The Soliloquy was an unusual memo addressed to the saboteurs in which Frankfurter urged the court to issue a single opinion. Regardless of why he chose to withdraw the opinion, his memorandum offers insight into an issue which divided the Court and remains divisive today.  Quirin and the Guantanamo Bay military commissions Guantanamo Bay cases= In the days after the military order on November 13, 2001, to try suspected terrorists, and particularly those detained at Guantanamo Bay, before military commissions, Ex parte Quirin was frequently cited as the legal basis for the order. Upon the capture of the Quirin saboteurs, President Roosevelt had issued an executive order, upon which the order issued by President Bush was putatively modeled; this authorized military commissions to try the captives for, among other offenses, violations of the laws of war, providing the enemy with intelligence, and spying. Quirin had held that extant legislation authorized the use of military commissions for the types of offenses in question. While in Quirin there had been a public law passed with the title \\"declaration of war\\" and three Articles (15, 81 and 82) of the Articles of War, President Bush's claim relied on a congressional Joint Resolution used as a formal declaration of war (which has no precise legal definition in the United States) under the War Powers Resolution, and two provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the successor to the Articles of War. The validity of Quirin as a basis for the use of military tribunals in the \\"War on Terrorism\\" as permitted by the Geneva Conventions has been disputed.War and the Constitution by George P. Fletcher in The American Prospect, January 1, 2002 (alternate URL ) and the response, The Military Tribunal DebateRevised ACLU Interested Person's Memo Urging Congress to Reject Power to Detain Suspected Terrorists Indefinitely Without Charge, Trial or a Right to Counsel by ACLUTerrorism and the Rule of Law by Nicholas Cowdery AM QC, President, International Association of Prosecutors Director of Public Prosecutions, NSW, Australia, at International Association of Prosecutors 8th Annual Conference, Washington, D.C. – 10–14 August 2003. A report by the American Bar Association commenting on this case, states: :The Quirin case, however, does not stand for the proposition that detainees may be held incommunicado and denied access to counsel; the defendants in Quirin were able to seek review and they were represented by counsel. In Quirin, \\"The question for decision is whether the detention of petitioners for trial by Military Commission ... is in conformity with the laws and Constitution of the United States.\\" Quirin, 317 U.S. at 18. Since the Supreme Court has decided that even enemy aliens not lawfully within the United States are entitled to review under the circumstances of Quirin, that right could hardly be denied to U.S. citizens and other persons lawfully present in the United States, especially when held without any charges at all.Report by the American Bar Association in PDF (footnote omitted). Since the 1942 Quirin case, the U.S. signed and ratified the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which were thus considered to be a part of U.S. municipal law, in accordance with Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Constitution of the United States (the Supremacy Clause).Wikisource:Ryuichi Shimoda et al. v. The State#II. Evaluation of the act of bombing according to municipal law Paragraph 2 In addition the Supreme Court of the United States invalidated this premise, in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, by ruling that Common Article Three of the Geneva Conventions applies to detainees in the \\"War on Terror\\", and that the Guantanamo military commission process used to try these suspects was in violation of U.S. and international law.The Gitmo Fallout: The fight over the Hamdan ruling heats up – as fears about its reach escalate. By Michael Isikoff and Stuart Taylor Jr., Newsweek, July 17, 2006 In response to Hamdan, Congress passed the Military Commissions Act 2006, which President Bush signed into law on October 17, 2006.

The highway begins as a continuation of the Creek Turnpike in Tulsa, continuing northward from the I-44/US-412 interchange there to the Missouri state line west of Joplin, Missouri. The turnpike carries the I-44 designation for its entire length. The turnpike is long and costs $4.75 (for a two-axle vehicle) to drive one way. The Will Rogers Turnpike opened to traffic on June 28, 1957. It was designated as I-44 in 1958. It is named for Will Rogers, \\"Oklahoma's Favorite Son\\". Route description Eastern terminus of the Will Rogers Turnpike at the Oklahoma–Missouri state line The Will Rogers Turnpike begins at an interchange between I-44, US-412, and the Creek Turnpike on the northeast side of Tulsa, straddling the line between Wagoner County and Rogers County. The Creek Turnpike ends at this interchange, with northbound Creek Turnpike traffic continuing onto the Will Rogers Turnpike. I-44 eastbound traffic also merges into the turnpike here. The turnpike heads north to its first interchange, which provides an exit to East Pine Street for westbound traffic and an entrance to the eastbound turnpike. North of the Pine Street interchange, the highway curves to a more northeast course, crossing the Verdigris River. In Verdigris, the turnpike has an interchange at the eastern terminus of SH-266. The turnpike continues northeast to Claremore, county seat of Rogers County, where it junctions SH-20; it also passes under SH-88 in Claremore, with no access provided between the two highways. The turnpike then continues northeast out of Rogers County. After leaving Rogers County, the Will Rogers Turnpike enters Mayes County. The only interchange in Mayes County is a partial interchange with SH-28 west of Adair. Eastbound motorists can exit the turnpike at SH-28 and motorists on SH-28 can join the turnpike heading westbound. From this interchange, SH-28 continues northeast, entering Craig County. North of Big Cabin, the Will Rogers Turnpike comes to a junction with US-69. Just northeast of this interchange is the only mainline barrier toll plaza on the turnpike. After the toll plaza, the highway passes under the McDonald's restaurant at the Vinita service plaza (see below). On the east side of Vinita, the road comes to an interchange with US-60 and US-69. From Vinita, the turnpike continues northeast out of Craig County. The final county that the Will Rogers Turnpike serves is Ottawa County. The first interchange in Ottawa County lies northeast of Afton; here, motorists can access US-59, US-60, and US-69. The turnpike continues to its final interchange, near the county seat, Miami. This interchange serves SH-10. Just north of this interchange is a welcome center for westbound traffic. The highway continues northeast to the state line. I-44 continues east into Newton County, Missouri toward Joplin and Springfield. History Because the Will Rogers Turnpike was built prior to authorization of the Interstate Highway System (in 1956), it uses a different set of design standards than today's. As the road has been rebuilt, this is being brought in line with current design practice. The original route of the Turnpike continued straight into and through Tulsa, becoming Skelly Drive in town (where tolls are not charged). The westernmost portion of the Will Rogers Turnpike was modified so that the Creek and Will Rogers Turnpikes form one road, with motorists required to exit at an interchange to stay on I-44. The original interchange was changed due to numerous difficulties for semis trying to merge into the single lane going to I-44 and Route 66. The new interchange was incorporated into an upgrade of US 412, with provisions for future expansion of the turnpike over a decade later, creating the Creek Turnpike bypass around the Metropolitan area, connecting back to the Turner Turnpike. The remaining pavement of the old alignment is now used as a training ground for the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, among others. Tolls A two-axle vehicle currently pays $4.75 ($4.40 with Pikepass) to drive the full length of the Turnpike. The Will Rogers Turnpike (as well as the Turner Turnpike on the other side of Tulsa) uses a somewhat unusual tolling system. The Turnpike has only one barrier toll plaza, located southwest of Vinita, at which drivers pay the full toll and are issued a receipt. If one exits before reaching this plaza, the toll for the portion traveled is collected at the exit. If one's desired exit is located after the plaza, the motorist presents their receipt to the attendant, and the fare for the untraveled portion of the turnpike is refunded to the driver. Travelers exiting the turnpike westbound at Port of Catoosa or Pine Street, as well as at the two termini do not receive any refund. A similar situation exists for motorists entering the turnpike at an interchange. If one is entering in the direction away from the main toll plaza, the toll for the portion between the interchange and the terminus is collected at the ramp plaza; a refund receipt is still issued should the motorist exit at another interchange. Motorists entering in the direction toward the toll plaza are issued a ticket at the interchange which shows proof of entry. This ticket is then presented to the toll collector at the main toll plaza (or the desired exit, if before the main plaza), and the fare for the untraveled portion of the turnpike is deducted from their toll. This system was implemented in 1992.http://newsok.com/article/2375460 Services Law enforcement along the Will Rogers Turnpike is provided by Oklahoma Highway Patrol Troop XA, a special troop assigned to the turnpike. =Vinita service plaza= A view of the Vinita McDonald's from the westbound parking lot The Will Rogers Turnpike's most prominent service plaza lies between the toll plaza and the Vinita exit. The main feature of this toll plaza is a McDonald's bridge restaurant spanning the turnpike. Customers can view the traffic passing beneath the restaurant from the dining area through windows overlooking the highway. At the front of the west anchor stands a statue of Will Rogers. A separate Phillips 66 gas station is also available for both directions of travel at the plaza. The architecture of the McDonald's building is dominated by golden arches on both sides of the building that appear from a distance to be not only the corporate symbol of the chain, but the primary supports for a steel arch bridge structure over the turnpike. Visitors to the eatery exit from either side of the interstate, and then enter through one of the sides and then proceed to the restaurant level via stairs or an elevator. The building hosting the McDonald's restaurant was originally built when the turnpike opened in 1957 as one of the Glass House restaurants, owned by the now-defunct Interstate Hosts company. Because of this heritage, it is also known as the \\"Glass House McDonald's\\" and the \\"McDonald's Glass House Restaurant\\". the building originally operated as a Howard Johnson's restaurant. The McDonald's is purported to be the \\"world's largest.\\" However, the biggest temporary McDonald's in the world was opened during the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, which had but it was demolished after the 2012 Summer Olympics. The building and service plaza closed on June 4, 2013, for a complete renovation. It reopened on December 22, 2014 with a McDonald's, Subway, and Kum & Go gas stations. It reopened as the Will Rogers Archway. Exit list Exit numbers follow I-44 unless otherwise noted.

Early life Born in Toronto, Ontario, as the youngest of five children from an Armenian father and English mother, Oundjian also claims Scottish ancestry through his maternal grandfather, a Sanderson, and the MacDonell of Glengarry clan. Oundjian was educated in England, where he began studying the violin at age seven with Manoug Parikian. He attended Charterhouse School in Godalming and continued his studies later with Bela Katona. He then attended the Royal College of Music. Oundjian subsequently studied at the Juilliard School with Ivan Galamian, Itzhak Perlman, and Dorothy DeLay. While at Juilliard, he minored in conducting, and later received encouragement in his endeavors when he attended a master class from the eminent Austrian conductor Herbert von Karajan. Career In 1980, Oundjian won First Prize at the International Violin Competition in Viña del Mar, Chile. Oundjian became the first violinist of the Tokyo String Quartet and held the post for 14 years. A repetitive stress injury forced Oundjian to curtail his instrumental career.Colin Eatock, \\"Oundjian on Board\\". Opus, fall 2004. He then shifted his full-time musical focus to conducting. Oundjian was the Artistic Director of the Nieuw Sinfonietta Amsterdam (now the Amsterdam Sinfonietta) from 1998 to 2003. He is also the Artistic Advisor and Principal Guest Conductor of the Caramoor International Music Festival. He was also the Principal Guest Conductor of the Colorado Symphony Orchestra for three years. For four summers, he led The Philadelphia Orchestra's \\"Absolutely Mozart\\" Festival.

Oundjian was named music director of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra (TSO) in January 2003, and assumed the post in 2004. The orchestra had financial problems before the time of Oundjian's appointment, and he contributed to an improvement in the orchestra's situation since the start of his tenure. The 2005 documentary film Five Days in September: The Rebirth of an Orchestra records the first days of Oundjian's first season as the TSO's music director. In February 2007, Oundjian extended his contract with the TSO to 2012. Following a subsequent contract extension through the 2013-2014 season, in April 2013, the TSO further extended his contract through the 2016-2017 season. Following a further TSO contract extension through the 2017-2018 season, Oundjian concluded his music directorship of the TSO at the close of the 2017-2018 season and was named the TSO's conductor emeritus. He also received the Key to the City from Toronto mayor John Tory. Since 1981, Oundjian has taught as an adjunct professor of violin at the Yale School of Music.Yale Bulletin and Calendar, Vol. 26 (No. 19), 2-9 February 1998.

It stars Sterling Hayden and Eve Miller. The film offers a fictionalized account of the struggle to build the Kansas Pacific Railway in the early 1860s just prior to the American Civil War. In the film the building of the railroad in Kansas is opposed by sympathizers of the South before it forms the Confederacy. General-in-Chief of the United States Army Winfield Scott sends a Corps of Engineers captain (Hayden) incognito to complete the railroad in order to supply western Union outposts when the anticipated war starts. Opposing the railway is Confederate William Quantrill (Reed Hadley), whose mission is to stop or delay the railway from being completed. The rights to the film are currently in the public domain. Production The movie was filmed at the Iverson Movie Ranch and the Sierra Railroad in what is now Railtown 1897 State Historic Park, Jamestown, California. Walter Mirisch of Allied Artists had Walter Wanger's name put on the picture as a producer, although he was in prison for shooting agent Jennings Lang, whom he believed to be having an affair with his wife, Joan Bennett. Thanks to Mirisch, Wanger received a producer's billing, salary and profit participation.p.49 Mirisch, Walter I Thought We Were Making Movies, Not History 2008 University of Wisconsin Press Plot Set prior to the Civil War but after the South has seceded from the U.S., the film centres on the efforts to build a railroad across Kansas toward the West Coast. Southern sympathizers attempt to sabotage the railroad construction efforts so U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Captain John Nelson, played by Sterling Hayden, is brought in to keep the project going. Captain Nelson must not only contend with the efforts of the saboteurs but also try to romance the railroad foreman's daughter, Barbara Bruce, who is played by Eve Miller. Miller plays the only female character within the entire movie. This film also features Clayton Moore, best known for his role in films and on television as The Lone Ranger. Andrew V.

It is part of CityLink's ExchangeNET group of peering exchanges. The Wellington Internet Exchange (WIX) was established to allow entities connected to the CityLink metropolitan network in Wellington to send traffic directly to and from each other rather than via their ISP. This activity is known as peering. This provides improvements in speed as traffic travels directly between the parties and reduces load on the network by reducing the need for traffic to be duplicated through one or more intermediate ISP routers. In some cases this also avoids traffic being routed \\"out of town\\", or incurring ISP's traffic charges. Each connected entity could add specific details of networks they want to talk to directly to their routers (static routes and bilateral BGP sessions) but this quickly becomes an administrative headache as adds, changes and deletions become time consuming and error prone if more than a few peering sessions are configured. The Wellington Internet Exchange provides two route servers which contain routing details for each of the participants. This simplifies peering enormously for most exchange users.

His 1444 panel The Miraculous Draft of Fishes (a portion of a lost altarpiece) has been credited as the earliest extant faithful portrayal of a landscape in European art history, being based on observation of real topographical features.Borchert, Till-Holger. Van Eych to Durer: The Influence of Early Netherlandish painting on European Art, 1430-1530. London: Thames & Hudson, 2011. 58. Witz is most famous for painting three altarpieces, all of which survive only partially. The earliest is the ' of about 1435 (today mostly in the Kunstmuseum, Basel, with isolated panels in other collections). The next is the Altarpiece of the Virgin (c. 1440), which has been associated with panels now in Basel, Nuremberg, and Strasbourg (Saint Madeleine and Saint Catherine, Musée de l'Œuvre Notre-Dame). Witz's final altarpiece is the St. Peter Altarpiece of 1444, painted for St. Peter's Cathedral, Geneva, and now in the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire, Geneva, which contains his most famous composition, the Miraculous Draft of Fishes. The painting of St. Christopher (Kunstmuseum, Basel; illustrated) does not seem to be related to these major altarpieces.

It sits on the River Aire and on the A65 south of Yeadon. The northern parts of the village are part of the Guiseley and Rawdon ward of Leeds City Council and the southern part in the Horsforth ward. The whole village is included in the Pudsey parliamentary constituency. History The name comes from Old Norse rauðr meaning red, and Old English dūn meaning hill. While no documentary reference has been made to Rawdon before the Domesday Book was composed in 1086, the area had seen human activity at least as early as in the Bronze Age, as evidenced by archeological finds of bronze axe heads and a gold torque.Willcock, Ch. 1 In the Domesday Book Rawdon (also spelt Roudun, Rowdun and Rowdon) is mentioned as terra regis (belonging to the King) with five taxable landholders, one of them Norman and the others Saxon, and approximately between 500 and 700 acres of pasture and 80 to 200 acres of arable land.Willcock, Ch. 2 Paul (or Paulyn) de Rawdon, a commander of archers under William the Conqueror was awarded lands in Rawdon for his faithful and courageous service to the Normans, a portion of which was the manor on Rawden Hill, in 1069. He took his surname after his new possessions, meaning he became known as Paulyn of Rawden Hill Manor.Granting manors to military leaders was more than a matter of largesse on William’s part. It was the medieval method of controlling newly conquered countries. For Paulyn, as for scores of other new lords of new manors, it meant a continuing obligation to the new ruler, but it also meant a near guarantee of prosperity by means of a new family seat and the control over fiefdom. At the time of invasion, Paulyn, in common with his peers, had no true surname, or family name. Surnames were not yet necessary to distinguish one man from another. In fact, it seems that the first real use of the surname came about because of the Norman invaders’ need to know how much land they controlled and what the value of the land was. To determine this, a census, called the Domesday Survey, was taken of the 5,500-or-so land-holding knights and each was identified with a surname. For the following four centuries his descendants lived at or near to the house now known as Layton Hall, opposite the present churchyard, and on several occasions presented land to Bolton Priory, Kirkstall Abbey, and (once) to Esholt Nunnery. After the dissolution of the monasteries the greater part of Rawdon passed to the Crown and shortly thereafter to Henry Clifford, second Earl of Cumberland, who died without issue in 1570. Afterwards, the lands changed owners several times until two thirds of the Manor of Rawdon, all the Manor of Yeadon and two fifths of the Manor of Horsforth had been acquired by Francis Layton, a great nephew of Richard Layton, Dean of York, and later Yeoman of the Jewel House to Charles I. For his support of the king in the English Civil War he was imprisoned in 1645 and heavily fined. He lived in the old family home of the Rawdons, which has since been called Leyton Hall.Willcock, Ch. 3 The Leyton estate remained in the hands of the family until 1718 when it was split up, and after various quarrels it was reunited in the hands of the Emmott family (later known as the Green-Emmott or the Green-Emmott-Rawdon family) who let out leyton Hall whole or in part for a long time during their ownership. Col. Charles Payne Barras, agent of the family in the 1860s, founded brick and tile works to use the abundant local clay.Willcock, Ch. 4 George Rawdon, a descendant of the Rawdon family and brother of Ann Paslew, had a new hall built in Cliffe Lane, known as Rawdon Low Hall in the past and now as Rawdon Hall. According to a date stone it appears to have been completed in 1625. George Rawdon became secretary and agent of Edward, 1st Viscount Conway, and served in Ireland following the Catholic rebellion in Ulster in 1641. He left the management of his estates in the hands of his son-in-law, John Stanhope II of Horsforth. Rawdon was civil parish from 1866 to 1 April 1937, when it was merged into Horsforth parish. Rawdon became a civil parish again on 15 October 2012. Areas of interest Rawdon Billing is a hill and well known local landmark that can be seen from a considerable distance. =Little London= The village of Little London with its extensive conservation area lies in the westernmost part of Rawdon, about south of the centre of Guiseley. It is unique in that the historic area covered by the designation straddles the boundary of the Cities of Leeds and of Bradford. Until the local government reorganisation in 1974 this area was part of a district called Aireborough which was subsequently divided between Leeds and Bradford. The portion of the conservation area lying in the City of Leeds was designated in 1975 and was extended in 1988. The portion of the conservation area lying in the City of Bradford was designated in 1977. The Bradford designation centres on Lane Head House, built for the steward of Esholt Hall Estate , with its associated cottages, and outbuildings and other mainly late 18th century development. =Cragg Wood= Rawdon Cragg Wood conservation area, is an exclusive rural suburb of Victorian villas with special architectural interest set in spacious wooded grounds developed in the second half of the 19th century, for the wealthy wool and cloth merchants of Leeds and Bradford. “The ‘old nobility’ may have gone, perhaps for ever, but in their stead has arisen a race of self made nobles, born of trade and commerce, whose pretty villas or castellated towers stud the hillside or nestle in the wood, to the undoubted advantage of the landscape\\". https://www.leeds.gov.uk/docs/Rawdon%20Cragg%20Wood%20Appraisal%20optimised.pdf Schools Nether Yeadon School near the junction of Apperley Lane and Warm Lane was a joint Quaker/Baptist effort on land provided by the Laytons for a peppercorn rent in 1703. It was rebuilt in 1821 and sold in 1905 as a private residence, now known as Layton Cottage.Willcock, Ch. 9 Thomas Layton had St. Peter’s Church School built in 1710 as a school for boys at the junction of Layton Avenue and Town Street. A church school for girls and infants was built in Town Street in 1861 and extended in 1876 with two classrooms for boys, together with a master’s house.Pevsner, Buildings of England, The West Riding (1959) p. 399 The school, but not the house, was burnt down in 1951. It was rebuilt and reopened in 1965 and extended with an infants department in 1976, and the master’s house is now occupied by the caretaker. The old building erected under Thomas Layton (‘The Institute’) was used for parochial purposes from 1876 to 1979 and then turned into a private house. The school is still active as Rawdon St Peters C of E Primary School. Woodhouse Grove School was established on an estate purchased by the Wesleyans in 1811 who had the existing house and folly of Robert Elam, a prominent Leeds Quaker, converted and furnished. It opened in 1812 as a school for the sons of Wesleyan ministers, and from 1882 it also admitted the sons of laymen. New buildings of Littlemoor Primary School Further schools in the area include the Friends School at Low Green which operated from 1832 until 1921 and whose buildings now serve as a light industrial estate, The Rev. Anthony Ibbotson’s Seminary, run 1823-1858 by the local minister, the Baptist Ministerial Training College in a Victorian Gothic building on Woodlands Drive which opened in 1859 and closed in the 1970s, and Little London School in Micklefield Lane, built in 1846 in a vernacular Tudor style, which was also used by the Baptists as a Sunday School until their own was built in 1884 and also as a Mechanics Institute until a building in Leeds Road was acquired. From 1920 on it served as an infants school and closed in 1960. Being used for some years for storage purposes, it was converted into flats (1980). Littlemoor Primary School in quasi-ecclesiastical style with a bell turret opened in 1879 at the junction of Harrogate Road and Batter Lane. It closed in 2005 and is converted into housing. Rawdon Littlemoor Primary School now uses a new building. Brontë House School was opened as a preparatory department for Woodhouse Grove in May 1934 by the Methodists who had acquired the Ashdown estate. Its pre- preparatory department Ashdown Lodge was opened in 1993 in the grounds and preserves the old name. Benton Park School, the local secondary school on Harrogate Road, was established on grounds acquired by Joseph Riley, who with his son John ran a school for boys there from 1838. Between 1951 and 1957 it was used as a senior school for Littlemoor in the tripartite system according to the Education Act of 1944. The old building was demolished and the new one opened in 1960. It is used as a fictional location in the soap opera Emmerdale. Religion Trinity Church Rawdon is home to St Peter's Church which was built by Francis Layton as a chapel of ease for the parish of Guiseley in 1645. Due to the troubled times (English Civil War 1642–1651, then Cromwell's Commonwealth until the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660) it took many years to erect the church. Francis Layton died in 1661, leaving his son Henry to continue with the building. It was finally consecrated in 1684. A tower was added in 1707. The church was largely rebuilt in 1864 by architect Alexander Crawford at a cost of £1,200. Friends Meeting House of 1697 Rawdon is also home to a Quaker meeting house built in 1697,D. C. Willcock (2000) A History of Rawdon and the Trinity Church (Baptist, Methodist, United Reform). This is housed in the former Benton Congregational Church (1846), being renamed in 1972 by the three groups who now share it. It was home to Rawdon College, a Baptist missionary training institution that opened in 1859 and closed in 1961.

Schwanberg Schwanberg is a mountain, or hill of higher elevation (474 m), in the rural district of Kitzingen, Regierungsbezirk Lower Franconia, Bavaria, Germany. It is part of the Steigerwald. In ancient times the mountain was used by the Celts as a refuge. It is probably safe to assume that the mountain has been considered sacred ground since. Later, the counts of Castell build a castle that still exists today. The southern slopes are used for viniculture; the top of the mountain is covered by forest. There are two burial sites on the Schwanberg, the vault of the princes of Castell, as well as the cemetery of the Protestant order Communität Casteller Ring. The latter emerged shortly after the 2nd World War from the Bavarian Girl Scout Movement \\"Bund Christlicher Pfadfinderinnen\\" (BCP - there is a German Wiki article about it). Members are still living on the mountain, where they maintain a retreat, the \\"Geistliches Zentrum Schwanberg\\" (Spiritual Center Schwanberg). According to legend, Hadeloga, a daughter of Franconian king Pippin, set her veil flying from the top. An abbey should be built wherever it landed. A shepherd named Kitz found the veil near the river Main, which allegedly was the origin of the abbey and the town of Kitzingen. A play written for children retells the story; it is occasionally performed by school children of the region. Parts of the region belonged to the county of Castell. One road leads from the Rödelsee to the top of the mountain. Towns and villages around the mountain are Castell, Rödelsee, Wiesenbronn, Iphofen, Birklingen and Greuth.

Michael Idomir Allen, (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993), 29-30. His territory included Vasconia in the south-west of Gaul and the Duchy of Aquitaine (at that point located north-east of the river Garonne), a realm extending from the Loire to the Pyrenees, with the capital in Toulouse. He fought the Carolingian Franks and made alliances with the Moors to combat them. He retained this domain until his abdication in 735. He is remembered for defeating the Umayyads in 721 in the Battle of Toulouse. He was the first to defeat them decisively in Western Europe. The feat earned him the epithet \\"The Great\\". Early life His earlier life is obscure, as are his ancestry and ethnicity. One theory suggests that he was of Roman origin as contemporary Frankish chroniclers refer to his father as an enemy Roman. Several Dukes of Aquitaine have been suggested as Odo's father: Boggis or Bertrand, or Duke Lupus I. According to the spurious Charte d'Alaon, Hubertus was one of Odo's brothers. Odo succeeded to the ducal throne maybe as early as 679, probably the date of the death of Lupus, or 688. Other dates are possible, including 692, but he was certainly in power by 700. Early leadership The historian Jean de Jaurgain cites him as fighting in 711 against the Visigoth Roderic in Pamplona. In 715 he declared himself independent during the civil war raging in Gaul. It is not likely that he ever took the title of king. In 718, he appears raising an army of Basques (\\"hoste Vasconum commota\\") as an ally of Chilperic II of NeustriaPierre Riche, The Carolingians:A Family who forged Europe, 35. and the Mayor of the Palace Ragenfrid, who may have offered recognition of his kingship over Aquitaine. They were fighting against the Austrasian mayor of the palace, Charles Martel, but after the defeat of Chilperic at Soissons that year, he made peace with Charles by surrendering to him the Neustrian king and his treasures.Pierre Riche, The Carolingians:A Family who forged Europe, 35-36. Between Umayyads and Franks Odo was also obliged to fight both the Umayyads and the Franks who invaded his kingdom. On 9 June 721 he inflicted a major defeat upon Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani at the Battle of Toulouse, the first major battle lost by the Muslim Umayyad forces in their military campaign northwards, claiming the lives of thousands of Umayyad soldiers. The heroic victory was celebrated with gifts from the Pope, who declared the Aquitanian duke a Champion of (Roman) Christianity and solidified his independence. In order to help secure his borders against the Umayyads, he married his daughter, probably named Lampegia, to the Muslim Berber rebel lord Uthman ibn Naissa, called \\"Munuza\\" by the Franks, the deputy governor of what would later become Catalonia. Battles of Garonne, Tours and death In 731, the Frankish Charles Martel, after defeating the Saxons, turned his attention to the rival southern realm of Aquitaine, denounced Odo's alliance with Uthman ibn Naissa, and crossed the Loire, so breaking the peace treaty held with Odo. The Frankish leader ransacked Aquitaine twice, seizing Bourges too, and Odo engaged the Frankish troops but was defeated. Charles went back to Francia. Meanwhile, the Umayyads were gathering forces to attack Odo's ally in the Pyrenean region of Cerdanya (maybe Catalonia) Uthman ibn Naissa. In 731, the Berber lord was subject to the attack of an expedition led by Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi, overcoming and killing the rebel leader, and capturing Odo's daughter, who was sent as prisoner to a harem in Damascus. Busy as Odo was trying to fend off Charles's thrust, he didn't make it to help his ally. In 732, Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi's troops raided Vasconia, advanced towards Bordeaux and ransacked the city.David Levering Lewis, God's Crucible: Islam and the Making of Europe, 570-1215, (W.W. and Norton Company, 2008), 166. Odo engaged them but was defeated by the Umayyads near Bordeaux. Following the defeat, Odo re-organised his scattered forces, and ran north to warn Charles Martel, Mayor of the palaces of Neustria and Austrasia, of the impending threat and to appeal for assistance in fighting the Arab-Berber advance, which he received in exchange for accepting formal Frankish overlordship. The duke, aged almost 80, joined Charles Martel's troops and was to form the Frankish army's left flank, while the Umayyads and the multinational army commanded by Charles built up their forces somewhere between Vienne and Clain to the north of Poitiers in preparation for the so- called Battle of Tours (732, or possibly 733). Odo led his forces to play a major role in defeating the Umayyad army when they broke into the main Cordovan camp and set fire to it, sparking confusion and wreaking havoc with the enemy's rearguard. The alliance defeated the Umayyads at the Battle of Tours in 732, and expelled them from Aquitaine. After the battle, Charles headed back north to his domains in Francia--Neustria and Austrasia-- and duke Odo was left as ruler in Aquitaine and Vasconia. In 735 the Duke Odo abdicated or died, and was succeeded by his son Hunald. He may have died in a monastery where he retreated, perhaps as late as 740. Odo the Great's popularity in Aquitaine is attested by the Vita Pardulfi. The name of the character of king Yon de Gascogne in the 12th-century tale The Four Sons of Aymon is probably a corruption of Odo.Julien Bellarbre, \\"La « nation » aquitaine dans l’historiographie monastique du sud de la Loire (VIIIe–XIIe siècles)\\", Revue de l'IFHA, 6 (2014), retrieved 21 May 2018.

The Alextel terminal was a contemporary NAPLPS thin client system manufactured by Northern Telecom that was leased to customers for $7.95/month and consisted of a CRT display, attached keyboard, and a 1200 bit/s modem for use on regular phone lines. In 1991 proprietary software was released for IBM PCs that allowed computer users to access the network. Communications on the Alex network was via DATAPAC X.25 protocol. The system operated in the same fashion as Minitel, whereby users connected to various content providers. The most popular (and most expensive) sites were chat rooms. Using the service could cost as much as per minute. Also offered was an electronic white pages and yellow pages directory. Many users terminated their subscription upon receiving their first invoice. One subscriber racked up a monthly fee of over C$2,0000 spending most of his online time in chat.  History  The motivation to develop the Alex terminal and online service came from competitive pressure from France's Minitel, which had expanded into the Quebec market. Bell Canada received approval from the CRTC to offer the online service as of November 1988. The advent of the World Wide Web contributed to making this service obsolete. On April 29, 1994, Bell Canada sent a letter to its customers announcing that the service would be terminated on June 3, 1994. In that letter, Mr. T.E.

The seizure of the island by the British was to deny Madagascar's ports to the Imperial Japanese Navy and to prevent the loss or impairment of the Allied shipping routes to India, Australia and Southeast Asia. It began with Operation Ironclad, the seizure of the port of Diego-Suarez (now Antsiranana) near the northern tip of the island, on 5 May 1942.Grehan (2013), p. 18 A subsequent campaign to secure the entire island, Operation Stream Line Jane, was opened on 10 September. The Allies broke into the interior linking up with forces on the coast and secured the island by the end of October. Fighting ceased and an armistice was granted on 6 November. This was the first large-scale operation by the Allies of World War II combining sea, land and air forces.Rigge p. 100Grehan (2013), Ch. 9 Historian John Grehan has claimed that the British seizure of Madagascar before it could fall into Japanese hands was so crucial in the context of the war that it led to Japan's eventual downfall and defeat. BackgroundGeopolitical= Diego-Suarez is a large bay with a fine harbour near the northern tip of the island of Madagascar and has an opening to the east through a narrow channel called Oronjia Pass. The naval base of Diego-Suarez lies on a peninsula between two of the four small bays enclosed within Diego- Suarez Bay. Diego-Suarez Bay cuts deeply into the northern tip of Madagascar (Cape Amber), almost severing it from the rest of the island. In the 1880s, the bay was coveted by France, which claimed it as a coaling station for steamships travelling to French possessions farther east. The colonization was formalized after the first Franco-Hova War when Queen Ranavalona III signed a treaty on 17 December 1885 giving France a protectorate over the bay and surrounding territory, as well as the islands of Nosy Be and St. Marie de Madagascar. The colony's administration was subsumed into that of French Madagascar in 1897. In 1941, Diego-Suarez town, the bay and the channel were well protected by naval shore batteries. =Axis= Following the Japanese conquest of Southeast Asia east of Burma by the end of February 1942, submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy were moving freely throughout the north and eastern expanses of the Indian Ocean. In March, Japanese aircraft carriers conducted the Indian Ocean raid upon shipping in the Bay of Bengal and bases in Colombo and Trincomalee in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). This raid drove the British Eastern Fleet out of the area and they were forced to relocate to a new base at Kilindini, near Mombasa, Kenya. The move made the British fleet more vulnerable to attack. The possibility of Japanese naval forces using forward bases in Madagascar had to be addressed. The potential use of these facilities particularly threatened Allied merchant shipping, the supply route to the British Eighth Army and also the Eastern Fleet. Japanese submarines had the longest range of any Axis submarines at the time – more than in some cases, but being challenged by the United States Navy's then- relatively new fleet submarines' top range figures. If the Imperial Japanese Navy's submarines were able to utilise bases on Madagascar, Allied lines of communication would be affected across a region stretching from the Pacific and Australia, to the Middle East and as far as the South Atlantic. On 17 December 1941, Vice Admiral Fricke, Chief of Staff of Germany's Maritime Warfare Command (Seekriegsleitung), met Vice Admiral Naokuni Nomura, the Japanese naval attaché, in Berlin to discuss the delimitation of respective operational areas between the German Kriegsmarine and Imperial Japanese Navy forces. At another meeting on 27 March 1942, Fricke stressed the importance of the Indian Ocean to the Axis powers and expressed the desire that the Japanese begin operations against the northern Indian Ocean sea routes. Fricke further emphasized that Ceylon, the Seychelles, and Madagascar should have a higher priority for the Axis navies than operations against Australia. By 8 April, the Japanese announced to Fricke that they intended to commit four or five submarines and two auxiliary cruisers for operations in the western Indian Ocean between Aden and the Cape of Good Hope, but they refused to disclose their plans for operations against Madagascar and Ceylon, only reiterating their commitment to operations in the area. =Allies= The Allies had heard the rumours of Japanese plans for the Indian Ocean and on 27 November 1941, the British Chiefs of Staff discussed the possibility that the Vichy government might cede the whole of Madagascar to Japan, or alternatively permit the Japanese Navy to establish bases on the island. British naval advisors urged the occupation of the island as a precautionary measure. On 16 December, General Charles de Gaulle, leader of the Free French in London, sent a letter to the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, in which he also urged a Free French operation against Madagascar. Churchill recognised the risk of a Japanese-controlled Madagascar to Indian Ocean shipping, particularly to the important sea route to India and Ceylon, and considered the port of Diego-Suarez as the strategic key to Japanese influence in the Indian Ocean. However, he also made it clear to planners that he did not feel Britain had the resources to mount such an operation and, following experience in the Battle of Dakar in September 1940, did not want a joint operation launched by British and Free French forces to secure the island. By 12 March 1942, Churchill had been convinced of the importance of such an operation and the decision was reached that the planning of the invasion of Madagascar would begin in earnest. It was agreed that the Free French would be explicitly excluded from the operation. As a preliminary battle outline, Churchill gave the following guidelines to the planners and the operation was designated Operation Bonus: * Force H, the ships guarding the Western Mediterranean, should move south from Gibraltar and should be replaced by an American Task Force * The 4,000 men and ships proposed by Lord Mountbatten for the operation, should be retained as the nucleus around which the plan should be built * The operation should commence around 30 April 1942 * In the event of success, the commandos recommended by Mountbatten should be replaced by garrison troops as soon as possible On 14 March, Force 121 was constituted under the command of Major-General Robert Sturges of the Royal Marines with Rear-Admiral Edward Syfret being placed in command of naval Force H and the supporting sea force. Allied preparations Map of the assault Force 121 left the Clyde in Scotland on 23 March and joined with South African-born Syfret's ships at Freetown in Sierra Leone, proceeding from there in two convoys to their assembly point at Durban on the South African east coast. Here they were joined by the 13th Brigade Group of the 5th Division – General Sturges' force consisting of three infantry brigades, while Syfret's squadron consisted of the flag battleship , the aircraft carriers and , the cruisers and , eleven destroyers, six minesweepers, six corvettes and auxiliaries. It was a formidable force to bring against the 8,000 men (mostly Malagasy) at Diego-Suarez, but the chiefs of staff were adamant that the operation was to succeed, preferably without any fighting. This was to be the first British amphibious assault since the disastrous landings in the Dardanelles twenty- seven years before. During the assembly in Durban, Field-Marshal Jan Smuts pointed out that the mere seizure of Diego-Suarez would be no guarantee against continuing Japanese aggression and urged that the ports of Majunga and Tamatave be occupied as well. This was evaluated by the chiefs of staff, but it was decided to retain Diego-Suarez as the only objective due to the lack of manpower. Churchill remarked that the only way to permanently secure Madagascar was by means of a strong fleet and adequate air support operating from Ceylon and sent General Archibald Wavell (India Command) a note stating that as soon as the initial objectives had been met, all responsibility for safeguarding Madagascar would be passed on to Wavell. He added that when the commandos were withdrawn, garrison duties would be performed by two African brigades and one brigade from the Belgian Congo or west coast of Africa. In March and April, the South African Air Force (SAAF) had conducted reconnaissance flights over Diego-Suarez and No. 32, 36 and 37 Coastal Flights were withdrawn from maritime patrol operations and sent to Lindi on the Indian Ocean coast of Tanganyika, with an additional eleven Bristol Beauforts and six Martin Marylands to provide close air support during the planned operations. Campaign Allied commanders decided to launch an amphibious assault on Madagascar. The task was Operation Ironclad and executed by Force 121. It would include Allied naval, land and air forces and be commanded by Major- General Robert Sturges of the Royal Marines. The British Army landing force included the 29th Independent Infantry Brigade Group, No 5 (Army) Commando, and two brigades of the 5th Infantry Division, the latter en route to India with the remainder of their division. The Allied naval contingent consisted of over 50 vessels, drawn from Force H, the British Home Fleet and the British Eastern Fleet, commanded by Syfret. The fleet included the aircraft carrier Illustrious, her sister ship Indomitable and the ageing battleship Ramillies to cover the landings. LCAs at Tamatave in May 1942 =Landings (Operation Ironclad)= Following many reconnaissance missions by the SAAF, the first wave of the British 29th Infantry Brigade and No. 5 Commando landed in assault craft on 5 May. Follow-up waves were by two brigades of the 5th Infantry Division and Royal Marines. All were carried ashore by landing craft to Courrier Bay and Ambararata Bay, just west of the major port of Diego-Suarez, at the northern tip of Madagascar. A diversionary attack was staged to the east. Air cover was provided mainly by Fairey Albacore and Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers which attacked Vichy shipping. They were supported by Grumman Martlets fighters from the Fleet Air Arm. A small number of SAAF planes assisted. The defending Vichy forces, led by Governor General Armand Léon Annet, included about 8,000 troops, of whom about 6,000 were Malagasy tirailleurs (colonial infantry). A large proportion of the rest were Senegalese. Between 1,500 and 3,000 Vichy troops were concentrated around Diego-Suarez. However, naval and air defences were relatively light and/or obsolete: eight coastal batteries, two armed merchant cruisers, two sloops, five submarines, 17 Morane-Saulnier 406 fighters and 10 Potez 63 bombers. Captured French troops marching away from their HQ after the British had captured Diego-Suarez on 7 May Negotiations for the surrender of Diego-Suarez at the British headquarters in the town The beach landings met with virtually no resistance and these troops seized Vichy coastal batteries and barracks. The Courier Bay force, the 17th Infantry Brigade, after toiling through mangrove swamp and thick bush took the town of Diego-Suarez taking a hundred prisoners. The Ambararata Bay force, the 29th Independent Brigade, headed towards the French naval base of Antisarane. With assistance from six Valentines and six Tetrarch light tanks of B Special Service Squadron they advanced 21 miles overcoming light resistance with bayonet charges.Flint, pp. 68-69 Antisarane itself was heavily defended with trenches, two redoubts, pillboxes, and flanked on both sides by impenetrable swamps.Rigge pp.105-06 Arrachart airfield was attacked, with five of the Morane fighters being destroyed and another two damaged, while two Potez-63s were also damaged. This attack effectively resulted in the Vichy air strength on the island being reduced by 25 per cent. Two Morane fighters did briefly appear and strafe beaches at Courier Bay, but two more Vichy aircraft would be lost on the first day. On the morning of 6 May a frontal assault on the defences failed with the loss of three Valentines and two Tetrarchs. Three Vichy Potez 63s attempted to attack the beach landing points but were intercepted by British Martlets and two were shot down. By the end of the day fierce resistance had caused 10 out of the 12 tanks the British had brought to Madagascar to be destroyed. The British attacking forces had been unaware of the strength of the French defences known as the 'Joffre line', and were hugely surprised at the level of resistance they had come across. Another assault by the South Lancashires worked their way around the Vichy defences but the swamps and bad terrain meant they were broken up into groups. Nevertheless, they swung behind the Vichy line and caused chaos. Fire was poured on the Vichy defences from behind and the radio station and a barracks were seized. In all 200 prisoners were taken, but the South Lancs had to withdraw as communication with the main force was nonexistent after the radio set failed. At this time, the Vichy government in France began to learn of the landings, and Admiral Darlan sent a message to Governor Annet stating \\"Firmly defend the honour of our flag. Fight to the limit of your possibilities and make the British pay dearly for their act of highway robbery.\\" The Vichy forces then even went as far as to ask for assistance from the Axis Japanese. With the French defence highly effective, the deadlock was broken when the old destroyer dashed straight past the harbour defences of Antisarane and landed fifty Royal Marines from Ramillies amidst the Vichy rear area. The marines created \\"disturbance in the town out of all proportion to their numbers\\" taking the French artillery command post along with its barracks and the naval depot. At the same time the troops of the 17th Infantry Brigade had broken through the defences and were soon marching in the town. The Vichy defence was broken and Antisarane surrendered that evening, although substantial Vichy forces withdrew to the south. On 7 May British Martlets encountered three Morane French fighters, with one Martlet being shot down. All three of the French fighters were then shot down, meaning that by the third day of the attack on Madagascar, twelve Moranes and five Potez 63s had been destroyed out of a total of 35 Vichy aircraft on the entire island. A further three Potez bombers were destroyed on the ground during a raid on Majunga on 15 May. Fighting continued into 7 May but by the end of the day Operation Ironclad had effectively concluded. In just three days of fighting the British had seen 109 men killed and 283 wounded, with the French suffering 700 casualties. The Japanese submarines , , and arrived three weeks later on 29 May. I-10s reconnaissance plane spotted HMS Ramillies at anchor in Diego-Suarez harbour, but the plane was spotted and Ramillies changed her berth. I-20 and I-16 launched two midget submarines, one of which managed to enter the harbour and fired two torpedoes while under depth charge attack from two corvettes. One torpedo seriously damaged Ramillies, while the second sank the 6,993-ton oil tanker British Loyalty (later refloated).Rigge pp. 107–108 Ramillies was later repaired in Durban and Plymouth. The crew of one of the midget submarines, Lieutenant Saburo Akieda and Petty Officer Masami Takemoto, beached their craft (M-20b) at Nosy Antalikely and moved inland towards their pick-up point near Cape Amber. They were betrayed when they bought food at the village of Anijabe and both were killed in a firefight with Royal Marines three days later. One marine was killed in the action as well. The second midget submarine was lost at sea and the body of a crewman was found washed ashore a day later. =Ground campaign (Operation Stream Line Jane)= LCA in Tamatave harbour. Hostilities continued at a low level for several months. After 19 May two brigades of the 5th Infantry Division were transferred to India. On 8 June, the 22nd (East Africa) Brigade Group arrived on Madagascar. The 7th South African Motorized Brigade arrived on 24 June. On 2 July, an invasion force was sent to the Vichy-held island of Mayotte in order to take control of its valuable radio station and to utilise it as a useful base for British operations in the area. The island's defenders were caught by surprise and the key radio station and most of the sleeping defenders were captured. The Chief of Police and a few others attempted to escape by car but were stopped by roadblocks that had been assembled. The island's capture was carried out with no loss of life or major damage. The 27th (North Rhodesia) Infantry Brigade (including forces from East Africa) landed in Madagascar on 8 August. The Vichy governor of Madagascar Annet attempted to obtain reinforcements from the central Vichy government, particularly in terms of aircraft, but was unable to do so. By August, Vichy air strength on the island primarily consisted of only four Morane fighters and three Potez-63s. The operation code-named \\"Stream Line Jane\\" (sometimes given as \\"Streamline Jane\\") consisted of three separate sub-operations code- named Stream, Line and Jane. Stream and Jane were, respectively, the amphibious landings at Majunga on 10 September and Tamatave on 18 September, while Line was the advance from Majunga to the French capital, Tannanarive, which fell on 23 September. On 10 September the 29th Brigade and 22nd Brigade Group made an amphibious landing at Majunga, another port on the west coast of the island. No. 5 Commando spearheaded the landing and faced machine gun fire but despite this they stormed the quayside, took control of the local post office, stormed the governor's residence and raised the Union Jack. Having severed communications with Tannanarive, the Allies intended to re-launch the offensive ahead of the rainy season. Progress was slow for the Allied forces. In addition to occasional small-scale clashes with Vichy forces, they also encountered scores of obstacles erected on the main roads by Vichy soldiers. The Allies eventually captured the capital, Tananarive, without much opposition, and then the town of Ambalavao, but the devoutly Vichy Governor Annet escaped.Rigge pp 110-11 Eight days later a British force set out to seize Tamatave. Heavy surf interfered with the operation. As HMS Birminghams launch was heading to shore it was fired at by French shore batteries and promptly turned around. Birmingham then opened her guns up on the shores batteries and within three minutes the French hauled up the white flag. Tamatave fell into British hands. From there the South Lancashires and the Royal Welch Fusiliers set out to the south to link up with forces there. After they reached Tananarive they pressed on towards Moramanga and on 25 September they linked up with the King's African Rifles having secured the British lines of communication around the island. At the same time the East African infantry and South African armoured cars set out to find the elusive Governor Annet. The same day, a bombing raid was launched by South African Marylands on a Vichy-held fort in Fianarantsoa, the only major centre of population that was still in French hands and where the remainder of the Vichy aircraft were now based. On 29 September, two companies of the South African Pretoria Highlanders performed the only amphibious landing by South African forces of the entire war at the west coast harbor town of Tulear some 900 miles south of Diego Suarez. HMS Birmingham, 2 destroyers and 200 Royal Marines supported the unopposed landing. On 6 October, a Morane fighter strafed British positions near Antinchi, and on 8 October a British bombing raid on Ihosy airfield destroyed 4 Vichy aircraft. The last major action took place on 18 October, at Andramanalina, a U-shaped valley with the meandering Mangarahara River where an ambush was planned for British forces by Vichy troops. The King's African Rifles split into two columns and marched around the 'U' of the valley and met Vichy troops in the rear and then ambushed them. The Vichy troops suffered heavy losses which resulted in 800 of them surrendering. A single Morane fighter was operational until 21 September, and even strafed South African troops, but by 21 September the only serviceable aircraft the Vichy forces had was a Salmson Phrygane transport aircraft. On 25 October the King's African Rifles entered Fianarantsoa but found Annet gone, this time near Ihosy 100 miles south. The Africans swiftly moved after him, but they received an envoy from Annet asking for terms of surrender. He had had enough and couldn't escape further. An armistice was signed in Ambalavao on 6 November, and Annet surrendered two days later. The Allies suffered about 500 casualties in the landing at Diego-Suarez, and 30 more killed and 90 wounded in the operations which followed on 10 September 1942. Julian Jackson, in his biography of de Gaulle, observed that the French had held out longer against the Allies in Madagascar in 1942 than they had against the Germans in France in 1940. Aftermath December 1942. Four RAF Westland Lysander aircraft flying over Madagascar following the end of the campaign. With Madagascar in Allied hands, they established military and naval installations across the island. The island was crucial for the rest of the war. Its deep water ports were vital to control the passageway to India and the Persian corridor, and this was now beyond the grasp of the Axis. This was the first large-scale operation of World War II by the Allies combining sea, land, and air forces. In the makeshift Allied planning of the war's early years, the invasion of Madagascar held a prominent strategic place. Free French General Paul Legentilhomme was appointed High Commissioner for Madagascar. Like many colonies, Madagascar sought its independence following the war. In 1947, the island experienced the Malagasy Uprising, a costly revolution that was crushed in 1948. It was not until 26 June 1960, about twelve years later, that the Malagasy Republic successfully proclaimed its independence from France. Campaign service in Madagascar did not qualify for the British and Commonwealth Africa Star. It was instead covered by the 1939–1945 Star..

The story was written by Mark Gatiss and stars Peter Davison and Mark Strickson. It was recorded between 26–27 June 1999. Phantasmagoria was considered a more \\"assured and confident\\" production than director, Nicholas Briggs', previous works. Gatiss' acting, who plays Jasper Jeake, was considered especially good in the audio play. Synopsis The Fifth Doctor and Turlough investigate mysterious goings-on at the Diabola Club in London, 1702, where patrons are disappearing after losing at cards to the mysterious Sir Nikolas Valentine. Cast *The Doctor — Peter Davison *Turlough — Mark Strickson *Henry Gaunt — Nicholas Briggs *Quincy Flowers — David Walliams *Edmund Carteret — Jonathan Rigby *Jasper Jeake — Mark Gatiss *Poltrot/Librarian/Major Billy Lovemore — Jez Fielder *Sir Nicholas Valentine — David Ryall *Dr Samuel Holywell — Steven Wickham *Hannah Fry — Julia Dalkin Plot In the opening scene, Jasper Jeake, Quincy Flowers, Edmund Carteret and a fourth person are playing whist and discussing the coming succession of Queen Anne, at the Diabola Club (apparently a similar institution to the Hellfire Club). They argue and Carteret storms off, claiming a desire for adventure and excitement. Carteret is then approached by the sinister Sir Nicholas Valentine (introduced as a scholar, landowner and astrologer), and they agree to play cards. Carteret is later heard leaving alone furtively and acting \\"very queer\\". The following morning Valentine is heard to remark that he had good luck at cards the previous evening and inviting a down-at-heel school teacher to play with him the following evening. Meanwhile, in the Tardis, the Doctor tries to teach Turlough the rules of cricket with the aid of a 1928 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, and attempts to work out their time location from clues from the house they find themselves in. They are confronted by the home's owner, Dr Samuel Holywell, whom they deduce to be an antiquarian; they explain their presence on the pretext that they were delivering him the Tardis to form part of his collection. While the Doctor distracts Holywell, Turlough notices that some of his books are connected with necromancy. It then becomes apparent that the protagonists are being observed by an advanced intelligence, not from their current era. That evening, while the Doctor and Turlough are being entertained by Holywell, Jeake and Flower are robbed by Major Billy Lovemore (a highwayman) and lose their winnings from the previous night. Later Ned Cotton (a drunken watchman) encounters Holywell's maid, Hannah Fry, outside Holywell's house and assaults her. Hearing her cries, Turlough comes to her rescue. Inside the house, Holywell informs the doctor that he has practical proof of the existence of ghosts and is in regular contact with them. Before Turlough can fight save Hannah from Cotton, they are distracted by a man running towards them as if chased invisible pursuers; he drops dead with a playing card in his hand. The Doctor puts the card into his Almanack. Holywell blames himself, believing the death to be a result of his contact with the ghosts. In an aside, to the background of screams of torment, Valentine is heard to comment that only a little time remains until his work is complete. Following the altercation between Turlough and Cotton, Turlough has gone missing and the Doctor attempts to locate him. He notes that the dead man has numerous coins and promissory notes in his pockets and Holywell informs him that there have been a number of disappearances like Turlough's recently. Holywell claims that he has been able to contact the spirits of these missing persons through his experiments. Turlough, it becomes apparent, has fallen and injured his head but has been rescued by Flowers and Jeake. Holywell tells the doctor that twenty-four people have gone missing within a mile of the Diabola Club. Meanwhile, Lovemore murders Cotton, citing vengeance as the reason. In the Diabola Club, Poltrot is playing cards with Valentine and notes that Valentine never removes his gloves. This is dismissed by Valentine as a gambler's superstition. Flowers confronts Valentine about Carteret's disappearance. Valentine claims that Carteret left after a few hands, and invites Flowers to play with him and Poltrot. Later Jeake and Turlough see Flowers leaving the club, looking pale and avoiding them. Holywell, the Doctor and Hannah hold a seance in an attempt to locate the missing persons. They hear sounds that remind them of the death outside Holywell's house, and represent a series of numbers. Meanwhile, Turlough and Jeake decide to follow Flowers. They catch up with him and he asks for help, claiming that he is pursued by devils and a thousand voices. The voices are calling out numbers which the Doctor recognises as radio signals; he believes the Tardis can locate the source. Meanwhile, Valentine is heard telling Carteret that he will be used for \\"restoration\\". In the Tardis the Doctor discovers that the source of the radio signal has been blocked. The Doctor instructs Holywell and Fry to look into the disappearances to find a pattern. Holywell discovers that a spate of young men in their prime disappearing in the area has happened every thirty years and finally connects this with the Diabola Club. It becomes apparent that outside observers are looking for someone and have noticed the presence of the Doctor in addition to their quarry. The Doctor and Holywell arrive at the club (leaving Fry behind) to find Valentine playing cards with Pultrot, who is quickly dismissed; the Doctor takes over playing with Valentine. The Doctor wins with an Ace of Hearts and Valentine tells him to keep the card. The Doctor decides to retire, leaving Turlough and Jeake in the Diabola. They follow Valentine after he leaves the club. Meanwhile, Lovemore is heard talking to the alien presence, stating that he believes Valentine is the person they are looking for and he will now cast off his fake identities and confront Valentine. It is revealed that both Lovemore and Fry are his fake identities. The Doctor discovers that the playing card he was given by Valentine is a tracking device, calling the 'spirits' to him, and realises that he must destroy it; this causes the 'spirits' to depart. Valentine is heard to comment that if he could have the Doctor's mind it would complete his work. The Doctor realises that Valentine is stealing his victims' consciousnesses; each card is tailored to its victim's touch, which is why Valentine wears gloves when playing cards. These trapped consciousnesses are the spirits or ghosts which are summoned to the card once it has been activated. The Doctor discovers a way to reprogram the card he took from the dead man to claim a new victim when he or she touches it, and conceals it in his Almanack. Hannah returns and reveals herself to be the same person as Lovemore and an alien, but justifies her criminal life as a response to the gender stereotypes of the era. She goes on to disclose that Valentine is in fact Carthok of Deodalis, a deranged tyrant who escaped execution; she has been hunting him in revenge for the death of her family at his hands. Meanwhile, Jeake and Turlough arrive at Valentines laboratory and are detained and disarmed by Valentine; in their cell they find Carteret, who appears to be bordering on insanity. The Doctor and Holywell confront Valentine, who admits his true identity the murder of Fry/Lovemore's parents, and explains that he needs the consciousness of his victims to power his bio-mechanical ship to escape from the earth where he has been trapped. He has been healing his ship every thirty years by feeding it people's minds. Fry/Lovemore tries to force Valentine to return to Deodalis to face his execution but she is disabled by Valentine's defence systems. Valentine then decides to use her brain (rather than the Doctor's) to complete his repairs, and she is placed in a machine. The Doctor pleads for her life in exchange for what he claims is an item of great power but is in fact his Almanack (which he refers to as \\"the Wisdens\\"). He pretends to try to escape with the Almanack, and when Valentine/Carthok opens the book he touches the concealed card-trap and the consciousness/spirits he uses to capture his victims turn on him and kill him, led by Fry/Lovemore who also dies in the struggle.

The city of Antwerp was the focal point of the Protestant-dominated Dutch Revolt, but was forced to surrender to the Spanish forces. Under the terms agreed all Protestants were given four years to settle their affairs and leave the city. Many migrated north, especially to Amsterdam, which became the capital of the Dutch Republic. Apart from losing a high proportion of its mercantile population, Antwerp's trade suffered for two centuries as Dutch forts blockaded the River Scheldt up to 1795. Background At the time Antwerp, in modern Belgium, was not only the largest Dutch city, but was also the cultural, economic, and financial centre of the Seventeen Provinces and of north-western Europe. On 4 November 1576, unpaid Spanish soldiery mutinied: they plundered and burnt the city during what was called the Spanish Fury. Thousands of citizens were massacred and hundreds of houses were burnt down. As a result, Antwerp became even more engaged in the rebellion against the rule of Habsburg Spain. The city joined the Union of Utrecht (1579) and became the capital of the Dutch Revolt, which no longer was merely a Protestant rebellion but had become a revolt of all Dutch provinces. Relieved from the great battles with the Ottomans in the Mediterranean, Philip II of Spain turned his attention back to the uprising in the Low Countries and in 1579 sent Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma, to head his army in Flanders to regain control over Flanders, Brabant, and the United Provinces. When the siege of Antwerp began (1584) most of the County of Flanders and the Duchy of Brabant, including Brussels, had been recaptured in the preceding year. The army of Flanders had been reinforced in the previous years, both in quantity and quality, and in 1585 it had 61,000 men under arms. The siege begins Parma nearly died during the attack on his pontoon bridge in 1585. Famiano Strada: Histoire de la guerre des Païs-Bas, 1727. Defeat of the rebels on the Kouwensteinsedijk near the pontoon bridge, 26 May 1585. Lamberecht Causé in Famiano Strada Histoire de la guerre des Païs Bas, 1727. During the recapture of Flanders and Brabant, Parma improved the logistics of the Spanish army in Flanders by further investing in what is dubbed the \\"Spanish Route.\\" It was a main road leading north from Habsburg holdings in Northern Italy into the Low Countries, protected by forts built at strategic intervals, to provide the army with a reliable flow of supplies. When the siege of Antwerp began Parma's army was well supplied. The first stage of the siege saw encirclement lines constructed around Antwerp and forts built along the Scheldt estuary. The second stage consisted of commencing a long siege of Antwerp and constructing a bridge across the Scheldt, effectively closing off the city's waterways. The bridge, a unique feat of siege engineering at the time, consisted of a strong fort (reinforced with cannons) on each side of the Scheldt with a bridge of connected pontoons (paintings show sizable rowing boats) running between them. (This bridge is believed to have been 730m long.) In response to the closure of the Scheldt by this bridge, the Dutch flooded the lowlands adjacent to the Scheldt, effectively submerging most roads in scattered areas and leaving Spanish forts either flooded or isolated on small islands. Despite the Dutch using these floodplains to try to regain control over the Scheldt (using low draft oar and sail boats with small cannon emplacements on them), the Spanish position largely held firm, as many of the Spanish forts had been equipped with cannon and high quality troops. Several attempts were made by the Dutch to steer \\"fire ships\\" into the Spanish pontoon bridge, but the troops stationed in the adjacent forts managed to push them off course with pikes – though with heavy loss of life when the fire ships exploded. 800 Spaniards are said to have been killed, Caspar de Robles being one of the casualties. At one time, the rebels sent the Finis Belli (\\"End of War\\"), a huge floating platform into which they put great hope, against the bridge, but the mission failed. In the end the Dutch abandoned their efforts, considering Antwerp a lost cause. Surrender On 17 August 1585, Antwerp surrendered. After the siege, the Dutch fleet on the river Scheldt was kept in position, blocking the city's access to the sea and cutting it off from international trade. Parma stationed experienced Castilian troops within Antwerp to make sure the city would not fall into enemy hands. The moderateness of Parma's demands and the behaviour of his troops were a complete surprise given the bloodiness of the siege and the rampage of 1576. Parma issued strict orders not to sack the city. The Spanish troops behaved impeccably, and Antwerp's Protestant population was given four years to settle their affairs before leaving.Alfons K. L. Thijs, Van Geuzenstad tot katholiek bolwerk: Maatschappelijke betekenis van de kerk in contrareformatorisch Antwerpen (Antwerp, 1990), p. 102. Some returned to Roman Catholicism but many moved north and ended what had been a golden century for the city. Of the pre-siege population of 100,000 people, only 40,000 remained. Many of Antwerp's skilled tradesmen were included in the Protestant migration to the north, laying the commercial foundation for the subsequent \\"Dutch Golden Age\\" of the northern United Provinces. Although the city returned to prosperity, the Dutch blockade of commercial shipping in the Scheldt remained in place and prevented the city recovering its former glory. The blockade was maintained for the next two centuries and was an important and traumatic element in the history of relations between the Netherlands and what was to become Belgium.

The University Match is the only one in which a true OUCC team takes part: i.e., composed entirely of current Oxford students. The earliest reference to cricket at Oxford is in 1673. OUCC made its known debut in the 1827 University Match. In terms of extant clubs being involved, this is the oldest major fixture in the world: i.e., although some inter-county fixtures are much older, none of the current county clubs were founded before 1839 (the oldest known current fixture is Kent versus Surrey). The Oxford University Centre of Cricketing Excellence (OUCCE) team played 26 first-class matches (not including one abandoned) from 2001 to 2009. As Oxford Marylebone Cricket Club University, the team has played sixteen first-class matches from 2010 to 2016.

It is known for the eclectic decor of its stores and pink boxes featuring the company logo and an illustration of a voodoo priest. It garnered attention for their employees' unconventional unionization approach in March 2020.  History  The former exterior of the flagship location in Portland Voodoo Doughnut was founded in May 2003 by Kenneth “Cat Daddy” Pogson and Richard \\"Tres\\" Shannon III. The company's logo features a version of Baron Samedi, Voodoo Loa of the dead. During the business's first few years, it was only open at night. The original location closed between April to June 2011 for remodeling after the company acquired space next door that was formerly occupied by a nightclub called Berbati's Pan. Much of the expansion involved creating additional room for the kitchen.Voodoo Doughnut to Close Downtown Store for Renovation, Expansion The Oregonian. In August 2011, Voodoo Doughnut's staff constructed an enlarged version of its box for the Portland Bridge Festival that contained 3,880 doughnuts. The box was filled with smaller boxes and topped off with individual doughnuts until it reached 666 lbs, a number which, as Shannon explained, was chosen to go along with their voodoo theme. According to NBC News, it was the biggest box of doughnuts in the world. Also in 2011, Voodoo Doughnut began partnering with Rogue Ales to convert several of its doughnut flavors into bottled beer. These have included: Bacon Maple Ale and Chocolate, Peanut Butter, and Banana Ale. The latter was taken from its Memphis Mafia doughnut, which serves a tribute to Elvis Presley. That same year, the Los Angeles Times declared Voodoo Doughnut an international tourist attraction. In April 2017, a man choked to death while attempting to consume a half-pound doughnut within 80 seconds at the Colfax Avenue location in Denver. The eating contest, which was also a long- running tradition at other locations, has been suspended since this incident. According to the contest's rules, anyone capable of eating the entire cake- sized treat would receive a commemorative pin and not have to pay for the doughnut.  Unionization  In 2020, also during the pandemic, workers at the downtown location unionized, forming The Doughnut Workers United (DWU), which is affiliated with the Portland chapter of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). Doughnuts Bacon-Maple bar Voodoo doughnut pink box In addition to the Portland Cream doughnut, a variation of the Boston Cream doughnut), Voodoo Doughnut also makes a Cock and Balls doughnut that has cream filled \\"balls\\" Along with the examples included below, vegan doughnuts are also featured along with a rotating and frequently changing menu of specialty doughnuts and unusual variations of traditional varieties.Menu that are currently listed on the company's website Voodoo Doughnut offers over 100 varieties in total. Unconventional ingredients include Cap'n Crunch, grape flavored Tang, M&M;'s, Oreo cookies, and marshmallows. Two of their doughnuts, the NyQuil Glazed doughnut and the Vanilla Pepto Crushed Tums doughnut, are no longer available due to an order from local health officials. According to one of the company's co-owners, \\"The NyQuil one was kind of a lark, but that's the one that got the most famous. With the Pepto doughnut, I honestly thought if you had that shot of tequila you shouldn't have at 2:00 a.m., and then you got sugar, bread, Pepto, and Tums, you'd either feel better or puke your ass off and then feel better because you got it out of your system. So it was a win-win either way.\\"Voodoo Doughnut from the August 2006 issue of The Believer On December 24, 2008, Voodoo Doughnut's Portland Creme doughnut was designated Portland's \\"Official City Doughnut\\" by a resolution introduced by Portland Mayor Tom Potter and passed by city commissioners the same night. The resolution also expressed Portlanders' \\"deepest gratitude to Voodoo Doughnut management for its dedication in the face of these stringent economic times in providing employment opportunities... and above all, creating and naming a doughnut after our beloved city that leaves a lasting taste and fond memories on its customers near and far away.\\" Later, Mayor Potter and mayoral candidate Sam Adams attended a midnight doughnut-eating contest. On October 2, 2019, Voodoo Doughnut introduced a new Cannolo Doughnut, which is twisted before it's fried. The Cannolo is available in three different rotating seasonal flavors. Operations As of September 2020, the company has ten retail locations. The first opened in 2003 at 22 Southwest 3rd Avenue in the Old Town Chinatown neighborhood of Portland. To celebrate their fifth anniversary, Voodoo Doughnut opened a second branch at 1501 Northeast Davis Street named Voodoo Doughnut Too in the Kerns neighborhood. The operation began with a \\"soft opening\\" on May 30, 2008 with limited hours. The official opening was in June 2008 and featured a parade that traveled from the original location to the new one. Wedding services Voodoo Doughnut offers legal wedding services followed by doughnuts and coffee. from the company's website In an effort to \\"ritualize\\" the name “Voodoo,” both Pogson and Shannon became ordained ministers of the Universal Life Church, and subsequently performed both real and fake wedding ceremonies in their shops. Television The \\"Captain My Captain\\" doughnut, featuring vanilla frosting and Cap'n Crunch cereal Voodoo Doughnut has been featured on television series including: No Reservations,Anthony Bourdain Visits the Pacific Northwest from the Travel Channel website Man v. Food, Doughnut Paradise,Donut Paradise: The Ultimate Deep-Fried Treat from the Travel Channel website, and Attack of the Show. It was also used as a destination in the season finale of the 13th season of The Amazing Race. Jay Leno included a joke about Voodoo Doughnut during a 2004 Tonight Show opening monologue and said \\"Did you hear about the doughnut shop in Portland, Oregon, that has caffeinated doughnuts? Yeah, I guess you can stay awake during your bypass surgery.\\" Voodoo Doughnut Recordings In 2013, Voodoo Doughnut founders, Cat Daddy and Tres, started a record label named Voodoo Doughnut Recordings with the intent of establishing a catalog of doughnut-related music to help promote the company's brand. Early novelty acts included The Deep Fried Boogie Band and The Doughnut Boys. The label expanded to other artists such as Poison Idea, The Dandy Warhols, Dead Moon, Smegma, Jerry Joseph, Devin Millar, and Hazel. The label also releases recordings of comedians such as Ian Karmel.

In the 10th century, the Rec Comtal was built to use the river for irrigation. As it passes through a highly industrialized area (Barcelona metropolitan region), it had the dubious honor of being the most contaminated river in Europe during the 1970s and 1980s.

A Spanish force under Archduke Albrecht besieged the fortress being held initially by a Dutch force which was reinforced by English troops under Francis Vere who became the town's governor.Knight, Charles Raleigh: Historical records of The Buffs, East Kent Regiment (3rd Foot) formerly designated the Holland Regiment and Prince George of Denmark's Regiment. Vol I. London, Gale & Polden, 1905, p 50 It was said \\"the Spanish assailed the unassailable; the Dutch defended the indefensible.\\"Simoni p.10Belleroche p 14 The commitment of both sides in the dispute over the only Dutch ruled area in the province of Flanders, made the campaign continue for more than any other during the war. This resulted in one of the longest and bloodiest sieges in world history: more than 100,000 people were killed, wounded or succumbed to disease during the siege. Ostend was resupplied via the sea and as a result held out for three years.van Nimwegen pp 171–73 A garrison did a tour of duty before being replaced by fresh troops, normally 3,000 at a time keeping casualties and disease to a minimum.Duffy p 85 The siege consisted of a number of assaults by the Spanish, including a massive unsuccessful assault by 10,000 Spanish infantry in January 1602 when governed by Vere.Fissel p 188 After suffering heavy losses the Spanish had replaced the Archduke with Ambrosio Spinola and the siege settled down to one of attrition with the strong points gradually being taken one at a time. Ostend was eventually captured by the Spanish on 20 September 1604, but the city was completely destroyed and the overall strategy had changed since the siege had started.Markham pp 308–10 The loss of Ostend was a severe blow to the Republic but the Spanish propaganda and strategic objectives were frustrated by the Dutch and English conquest of Sluis a few weeks before the surrender of the city.Edmundson pp 102–03Israel (1998), p.260 In addition, the economic cost of such a long campaign and the enormous number of casualties sustained turned the result into a Spanish pyrrhic victoryMalland p 31 It was in many respects a Pyrrhic victory and effectively the siege contributed largely to Spanish bankruptcy three years later which was followed by the Twelve Years' Truce.Ghelderode p 5Motley p. 754 Background In 1568, during the reign of Philip II of Spain, the Netherlands, until then under the rule of the Spanish Empire, took up arms against the Spanish crown.Tracy, pp 75–78 The first phase of the war began with two unsuccessful invasions of the provinces by mercenary armies under Prince William I of Orange (1568 and 1572) and foreign-based raids by the Geuzen or Sea Beggars, (irregular Dutch land and sea forces).Israel (1997), pp 180–81 By the end of 1573 the Beggars had captured the bulk of the provinces of Holland and Zeeland as well as converted the populace to Calvinism, and secured against Spanish attack. The other provinces joined in the revolt in 1576, and a general union was formed.Israel (1997) p 191 Map of Flanders in the 17th century In 1579 the union was fatally weakened by the defection of the Roman Catholic Walloon provinces.Belleroche pp 23–26 By 1588 the Spanish, under Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma had reconquered the southern Low Countries leaving only Ostend as a major rebel enclave along the coast and stood poised for a death blow against the nascent Dutch Republic in the north.Israel, p 213 Spain's concurrent enterprises against England and France at this time, however, allowed the Republic to begin a highly successful counter offensive under Maurice of Orange which lasted from 1590–1600 known as the Ten Glory Years.Glete pp 155–56Naphy p 107 In 1599 the Archduke Albert of Austria and Isabel Clara Eugenia, brother and sister of Philip III ruled as joint sovereigns of the Netherlands through the will of the dying Philip II.Wedgwood p 55 By 1600 Maurice of Nassau was stadtholder and Johan van Oldenbarnevelt was Grand pensionary of the States General of the Netherlands. In 1601 Spain now under King Philip III with his favourite the Duke of Lerma despite maintaining its hegemony in the world, was economically weakened with war and bankruptcy.Munck p 51 Starting with the bankruptcy of the Royal Treasury in 1575; operations against the Ottomans in the Mediterranean, thirty years of war in Flanders against the rebel forces of the United Provinces and a war with England which had waged from 1585. Spain had also only just finished a costly and unsuccessful war with France. The wars were a great burden for the Spanish Empire and meant that financially Spain depended entirely on the treasure fleet brought from the colonies. Nevertheless, Philip pursued a highly aggressive set of policies, aiming to deliver a 'great victory' against both Holland and England.Williams p 125 The situation of the United Provinces was similar; more than thirty years of war, and foreign trade blocked by Spain had caused a financial drain. The Dutch tried to relieve their precarious finances by commercially expanding into the East Indies with the birth of the Dutch East India Company (VOC).Parthesius p 11 England were in the same position and were fighting now in Ireland. Like the Dutch they too had just set up their own East India Company. In 1600 the Dutch and English Army under the command of Maurice of Nassau and Francis Vere respectively used Ostend as a base to invade Flanders, in an attempt to conquer the city of Dunkirk after their victory in the Battle of Nieuwpoort.Borman pp 224–25 This never happened however as disputes in the Dutch command meant that taking Spanish occupied cities in the rest of the Netherlands took over priority as the opportunity arose.Knight p 49 Maurice concurred and had his forces evacuated by sea leaving Ostend to be preoccupied by the Spanish. =Ostend= Founded five hundred years ago, the city of Ostend (translated into English meaning East – End) in the mid-16th century was a fishing village of about 3,000 inhabitants. Ostend's strategic position in the province of West Flanders, along the North Sea and accessible to Dutch sea power, was fortified by the Dutch and English between 1583 and 1590, and turned into a major military port.Duffy p 59 In the view of the State of Flanders; Ostend in the hands of the Protestant Dutch and English was a huge thorn in their side.Motley pp 57–59 Ostend unlike other places in the Netherlands had never been taken by the Spanish and the garrison had even repelled an attack by Parma in 1583. In 1587, during preparations for the invasion of England by the Spanish Armada, Parma had rejected the idea of a conquest of Ostend by considering it a reckless enterprise after the capture of Sluis.Parker/Martin pp 126–127 The garrison had also made frequent incursions into the adjacent country. Ostend was the only possession of the Dutch Republic in Flanders and its capture was of strategic importance for the Spanish. =Defenses= A very detailed map from 1641 on the positions of Ostend during the siege by Joan Blaeu The reason why Parma was so cautious to attack was not just for its defences, but also its place right near the sea.Fissel pp 184–85 The old church and town faced the seas, but in 1583 the new town, further inland, was fortified with ramparts, counterscarps, and two broad ditches. The dunes were cut away, and the sea was allowed to fill the ditches and surround the town. A canal called the Geule had begun to form a new harbour on the east side; it was wide, deep and navigable and served the maritime traffic to the city. To the south a framework of streams and wetlands, often flooded would have made the area difficult to place heavy siege guns. Where the land rose slightly towards the dunes, on either side of the town; the besiegers would be able to approach with their parallels and batteries and as such were vulnerable points. On the West side of Ostend another canal – the Old Haven was more of a defensive moat which was barely navigable but could not be easily waded except for four hours at low tide. A ditch passed between the old and new towns, which were connected by bridges, and round the new town, parallel to the Geule on one side, and to the old harbour and Yperlet stream on the other. The Guele itself had ramparts and bulwarks on one side, and a counter scarp with ravelins on the other, while the water level for both canals could be adjusted from the lock located in the city. In the old town, closer to the mouth of the old harbour, a fort called the Sandhill had been constructed. The old town was protected by strong palisades forming bastions with connecting curtains, and a succession of three small forts; the Schottenburgh (next to the Sand-hill), the Moses Table, and the Flamenburg all defending a cut from the town ditch into the Geule, at the eastern corner. On the eastern side of the town facing the Geule, the defences consisted of a range of bulwarks (or bastions) North Bulwark, East Bulwark or Pekell, Spanish Bulwark at the southeast angle, with an outwork called the Spanish Half-moon. To the South and West an extensive outwork, the Polder, which had formerly been a field from which the water had been pumped by means of windmills near the point where the Yperlet stream flowed into the old harbour. Flanking the Polder at both points were the South bulwark and the West bulwark, in front of each were two further outworks; the inner stronger Polder, South and West Bulwark's which then linked the Polder, South and West Ravelins. This then linked to the Polder, South and West square's; Ostend's most outer defensive works. At the northwest angle, near the mouth of the fordable old harbour, the walls consisted of a strong ravelin in the counter scarp called the Porcepic, and a bastion in its rear known by the name of the Helmund.Belleroche pp 29–33 This was considered the most important area to defend as an attempt on the walls could be made on firm ground. The north area was open to the sea, where Ostend could receive reinforcements and supplies during the high tide. =Forces= Archduke of Austria Armies during this period of warfare utilized pikes, arquebuses, swords, daggers, rudimentary (and unpredictable) explosives; early forms of hand grenades as well as artillery. As there were more wounded than deaths in battle, amputations were the common solution for treating wounds. At this time poor sanitation spread infections and fever, causing more deaths than combat itself. The Tercios (Spanish Third) of the Spanish Empire were regarded at the time as the elite of the military corps, which kept their military hegemony in the 16th century and early part of the seventeenth and is seen by historians as a major development of Early Modern combined arms warfare. The quality of their organization and strict discipline made them efficient but certain circumstances such as delays in pay sometimes escalated into violent mutinies.Allen p 123 The tercios consisted of recruited soldiers of all domains of the Spanish Habsburg empire; Spaniards, Portuguese, Italians, Germans, Walloons, Swiss, Burgundians loyal to Spain and dissident Catholic Irish, along with mercenaries from other countries.Belleroche p 15 They were led by the Archduke Albrecht who was military commander of the Spanish forces in the Low Countries. The defending forces of Ostend were the army of the United Provinces, reorganized by Maurice of Nassau who also played a part in the development of early modern warfare. The Dutch had large support from their Protestant ally England whose pike men and arquebusiers were clad in red cassocks (amongst the earliest English redcoats).Dalton pp 75–76 The English having distinguished themselves highly in battles such as Turnhout and Nieupoort where they had faced and beaten the Spanish tercios were considered the veterans and the elite of the army as a whole.Fissel p 170 They did have a reputation however as being thieves; pillaging friend and foe alike during and after battle. Other Protestant troops from Scotland, France and Germany took their side amongst Maurice's army. Siege 1601 On 5 July 1601, the Archduke Albert opened the siege of Ostend with 12,000 men and 50 siege-guns in position; while the small garrison of under 2,000 was commanded by Governor Charles van der Noot. The States General held that the defence of this outlying post was a matter of vital importance.Belleroche pp 40–42 With this in mind they looked round for the ablest commander in their service.Motley pp 60 – 61 Sir Francis Vere the hero of Nieuwpoort, was chosen not as governor, but as general of the army along with ample powers. The Spanish besiegers soon rose to 20,000 a number which was one of the Archduke's preliminary objectives. As the Spanish cannonaded the city, some soldiers tried to wade the moat but this failed and a number drowned. The Count of Bucquoy, commanding forces east of Ostend, had been unable to do the same due over Geule, and began the construction of a dike from the sea up to the city; artillery was placed with which to fire at the boats coming and going from the North. These works were constantly interrupted by the rising sea, evolving under fire from the city and in addition the superiority of the Dutch and English at sea. In addition, the failure of the Spanish closing the north side of Ostend enabled it to receive reinforcements and supplies. Vere first proceeded to England to obtain the approval of Queen Elizabeth, and to raise a body of recruits – these were subsequently raised in East Anglia while some were pressed into service in London.Dunthorne p 223 Vere's brother Horace was detached from Maurice's army with eight English companies to reinforce the Ostend garrison. =Arrival of Vere= On 9 July Sir Francis landed, with these troops, on the sands opposite Ostend. Van der Noot met him at the water's edge, and delivered up the keys of Ostend. The garrison then consisted of thirty companies of Netherlanders in two regiments of 2,600 men to which Vere's added his eight companies of 100 men each, which brought up the total to 3,500 men. Another 1,500 English troops under Edward Cecil arrived on 23 July to build up the garrison. On 27 July English troops led by Edward Cecil made a sortie and gained a large segment of trenches from the Spanish whom they put to flight; pursuing them to the sand hills with support from the town's artillery. Casualties inflicted were heavy; around 600 including many prisoners. Amongst the killed was Don Diego Idiaquez son of a former secretary of state to Philip II. On 4 August the Spaniards kept up a tremendous fire on the town from all their batteries, and Sir Francis Vere was severely wounded in the head. Vere went to Middelburg to be cured of his wound, and in a few weeks he was convalescent. In September he returned to Ostend along with more recruits from Holland, England and Scotland.Dunthorne p 62 Meanwhile, the fire from the besiegers continued and the soldiers of the garrison dug underground quarters in the marketplace near the \\"Pekel\\" bastion, for protection against the hail of shot.van Nimwegen pp 174–76 Siege of Ostend Sebastian Vrancx The States General at this time demanded that Maurice should march to relieve the city; to take on the besiegers. Vere was himself frustrated at both the lack of Dutch response from the States General and from Maurice; particularly when a few veteran companies including Edward Cecil's, were taken out of Ostend to join Maurice's forces back in the field.Borman pp 230- 32 Maurice however knowing the futility in making a direct attack, chose to campaign the surrounding areas, in an attempt to block the Spanish supplies and divert the attention of the besiegers.Belleroche p 43 He laid siege and retook Rheinberg and then continued to Spanish held Meurs in August which was also captured. Maurice hoped to take 's-Hertogenbosch but plans for the siege were cancelled and so withdrew to winter quarters. =The Spy= Albert had taken on a traitor; a Catholic Englishman by the name of Conisby, who went to England and then procured letters to Vere before he crossed over to Ostend.Belleroche pp 49–50 He began to convey intelligence to the besiegers under an agreement with Albert.Edelman p 338 A boat was sunk in the mud, on the banks of the Old haven, near the South square; Conisby was to deposit letters there from which a Spanish soldier then took them during the night. Conisby however grew bolder, and tried to bribe a sergeant to blow up the powder magazine.Markham pp 317–18 The sergeant revealed the plot and Conisby confessed to everything, and was sentenced to be publicly executed but in an act of clemency was whipped out of the town. =Assault on the Sandhill & South Bulwark= In December 1601 the number of defenders of the garrison was down to less than 3,000 but the besiegers suffered terribly and had only 8,000 men fit for duty out of 25,000.Belleroche pp 51–53 For the first six months and generally throughout the siege there were fired on an average a thousand shots a day.Motley pp 69–70 It was not until the end of November the Spaniards had been at work advancing their batteries, forming foundations in the haven by sinking huge baskets of wicker-work filled with sand, and building floating platforms, on which guns were mounted in the \\"Geule\\".Markham pp 318–23 On 4 December a breach was made in between the Porcespic and the Helmund and the Archduke was prepared to storm. Vere made sure it was heavily guarded and placed Sir John Ogle's company there but was awoken by the alarm and rushed to the ramparts to discover the Spanish were assaulting the breach. A force of 3 – 4,000 Spanish attempted to storm the position; the phalanx of Spanish pikemen managed to gain the breach but were forced out by a counterattack. The Spanish then launched further attacks but were repelled again. A fierce struggle ensued, and the besiegers were driven back while Vere ordered wisps of straw to be set alight and fixed on the ends of the pikes, so that the retreating Spaniards might be fired upon with effect as they fell back.Knight pp 51–52 The assault never made it past the breach as the Spanish found the rubble almost impossible to fight on and suffered heavy casualties. In the end the attack was a disaster and after half an hour, the Spanish had lost over 500 men, nearly a quarter of the attacking force. = Parley stratagem = The position in Ostend by the turn of winter was perilous; after nearly five and a half months siege and after two months without reinforcements. Furthermore, the outer works such as the Polder had to be temporarily abandoned because of storms and exposed icy conditions.Motley pp 72 – 74 Spanish troops at Ostend On 23 December, Vere learned from a deserter that the Spanish were in preparation for a large impending assault on the city; he realized he had no hope except to hold for time. Vere's frustration with the Dutch continued writing many letters and complaining about the lack of support, in addition he demanded reinforcements. He therefore proposed a parley to the Spaniards for negotiations; but this was a ploy hoping to gain time to await the arrival of the reinforcements. The Spanish accepted and Vere sent two of his captains, John Ogle and Charles Fairfax, as hostages to the Spanish camp, while the Spanish sent in return Mateo Antonio, quartermaster general of the Spanish army, and Matteo Serrano, Governor of Sluis, to negotiate terms of possible surrender.van Nimwegen pp 178–80 Vere then construed as much time as possible frustrating Spanish 'negotiations'; he ordered his men to beat to quarters even though there was no attack. Vere then expressed anger at Serrano and Antonio as to why the Spanish had intended to attack and then refused to speak with them.Motley pp 75- 81 Vere then ordered them to stay put because of the dark and high tide, and flagons of English ale were given as compensation. The next day they arrived back at Albert's headquarters; but he immediately sent them back. While all this was going on vital repair work was carried out on the defences. Negotiations had been held off for twenty-four hours and Vere stated that the incident was a total misunderstanding and apologized. Vere told Serrano and Antonio that the archduke must withdraw from Ostend or surrender his forces; the reply was the Archduke was to see the surrender of the town. Vere then broke off the discussions again and both were invited to a banquet as it was Christmas Eve which they accepted with more time wasted. Rumours began to circulate outside that Ostend had fallen and the Archduke and Isabella had dressed in their best to await the surrender. In the town however both Serano and Antonio were about to resume talks but during the night three ships arrived with 600 Zealanders as reinforcements. Vere's plan had worked, after which, he immediately broke off all negotiations. The Spanish, in particular the archduke were outraged; reluctantly they released Ogle and Fairfax once Serrano and Antonio had returned. Albert refused to see any of his generals for several days blaming them for recommending to call off the assault and allowing the negotiations to go ahead. 1602 Sir Francis Vere In early January two of the besieging batteries, consisting of eighteen cannon, sent balls of forty to forty-six pounds weight, which kept up a crushing fire on the Porcespic, Helmund and Sandhill.Markham pp 323–5 The Spaniards had by that time sent 163,200 shot into the town, and scarcely a whole house was left standing.Simoni pp 97–8 Several houses, which had been ruined by the cannon fire, were pulled down for the sake of the beams and spars, to be used as palisades.Fissel pp 186 =Great Spanish Assault= Vere soon after received intelligence from deserters and scouts that the Spanish were preparing for the general assault; and began to prepare for it.Motley pp 82 – 83 Preparations At high tide Vere shut the west sluice, which let the water into the town ditch from the Old haven in the rear of \\"Helmund\\", in order to retain as much water as possible.Belleroche pp 54-56- Horace Vere and Charles Fairfax, with 12 companies armed with pikes and muskets, were stationed in the \\"Sand-hill\\". Vere took his stand with six of his veteran English and Scots companies close by. Two more companies; one English and one Dutch occupied the Schottenburgh redoubt and from there to the destroyed church were 300 Zeelanders who had arrived on the 26th. Ten Dutch companies occupied positions from the church, \\"Moses Table\\", North ravelin, and \\"Flamenburgh\\", while four large guns protected the harbour and the old town. The two most important works, flanking the breach, the \\"Porcespic\\" and the \\"Helmund\\" held ten Dutch and English companies along with nine guns loaded with grape shot. In the \\"West Bulwark\\" two demi-culverins were placed to sweep the old haven. Along the curtain of the old town, and on the breach which had been made under the \\"Sandhill\\", stones and bricks from the ruins of the old church, hoops bound with squibs, fireworks, ropes of pitch and hand-grenades were ready to be poured on the attackers. By the evening the Spanish army had marshalled for a huge assault and were seen bringing down scaling ladders and ammunition. Count Farnese, with 2,000 Spanish and Italian troops, were ordered to attack the \\"Sandhill\\" and the curtain of the old town wall. The governor of Dixmunde, with 2,000 Spaniards, was to assault \\"Helmund\\" and the Porcespic; a force of 500 men was to scale the west ravelin, while a similar number attacked the \\"South Square\\". On the east side Count Bucquoy was to deliver an assault, specially attacking the east ravelin and the defences of the new haven; in all the assault totalled some 10,000 men. Assault Vere ordered his engineers to get on the breach to rapidly throw up a small breast work, driving in palisades. The Archduke fired a gun as a signal to Bucquoy, and the besiegers rushed to the assault from all points just as the darkness of night set in. Vere's engineers immediately discovered Count Farnese wading across with his 2,000 Italians, and drawing them up in battalions on the Ostend side.Motley pp 84 – 86 Vere then went to the top of the \\"Sandhill\\" and issued orders to have everything in readiness, but not to fire until he gave the signal, and then to open with both ordnance and small shot. Depiction showing the huge Spanish assault of 7 January 1602 As the Spanish approached ever closer Vere at once ordered a heavy fire on to the Spanish battalions heading towards the foot of the \\"Sandhill\\".Markham pp 326–29 Along the curtain of the old town, the Spaniards rushed into the breach but as they climbed up they were met by ordnance fire from the bulwarks. Burning ash, stones, and rubble were hurled at them, before the flaming hoops were cast.Belleroche pp 58–60 The Spanish no sooner climbed to the crest of the \\"Sandhill\\" and the \\"Schottenburgh\\" but were repelled three times with heavy losses after rallying to the charge, while the struggle on the breach continued during the space of an hour. Similar assaults were made on the Western ravelin, and on the \\"South Square\\", while on the east side three strong battalions of the Spanish were formed on the margin of the \\"Geule\\". They then attacked the \\"Spanish Half- moon\\" outwork which was taken after heavy fighting. Vere ordered its recovery and heavy fire was opened from the bulwarks and then an English company drove them out with a loss of 300 men, mostly captured. By midnight the Spanish were repulsed at all points having suffered heavily in the assault and were milling about in the ford in confusion. Vere saw an opportunity he could not miss, and ordered the west sluice to be opened, through which the waters that had been stored in the town ditch and had been closed at high tide now rushed down the haven in a huge torrent while the Spanish were wading across. The damage inflicted by this torrent was tremendous and carried many of the assailants away into the sea. Once the waters had subsided the defenders then launched a counterattack, poured over the walls and secured an immense amount of plunder. The Spanish retreated in complete disorder throwing away everything they had. The English were for first into the fray; Spanish pistols, priests cassocks, swords, gold chains, pendants and enamelled shields were all taken from the dead and dying. There were heaps of Spanish and Italian dead under the \\"Sandhill\\" and along the wall of the old town, amidst broken siege equipment. Among the dead and wounded was the discovery of a young Spanish girl in male attire, who had fallen in the assault and under her dress was a chain of gold set with precious stones, along with other jewels and silver. Aftermath Casualties from the assault were enormous; between 1,500 and 2,000 soldiers were killed, wounded, drowned or captured which at the time represented at least a quarter of the whole besieging army in total. Many noblemen, chiefs and commanders were killed or missing; the Count d'Imbero an extremely wealthy Italian was slain by an English private soldier of Fairfax's company; so too was Don Durango Maistro del Campo, also known as Colonel Don Alvarez Suarez (Knight of the Order of Santiago), the hostage during the parley Colonel Simon Antonio and the Lieutenant Governor of Antwerp.Duffy p 86 The loss of the garrison was forty killed and 100 wounded; Horace Vere was wounded in the leg with a splinter while two captains and four other officers were killed. After the failure of this assault, many of the Spanish soldiers mutinied to protest the high number of casualties and no gains, blaming their commanders for having led them to certain death. Albert however took no sympathy and ordered the ringleaders of which there were several, executed. =Departure of Vere= The besiegers had had enough supplies and food to last them for some time and Vere remained for a few months longer, when he was called away by the States General to assume an important command in the field. Vere's parley in December was met with muted criticism however but the repulse of the assault had overshadowed this.Belleroche pp 61–62 Vere left Ostend on 7 March, accompanied by his brother Horace and John Ogle as well as the majority of his English companies,Fissel pp 186–87 but the remaining English troops continued to fight for the Dutch until the end. Colonel Zelandés Frederic van Dorp the new governor arrived with a fresh rotation of eight Dutch and Frisian companies and by June more reinforcements put the garrison at 5,000 men in total.van Nimwegen pp 180–82 In July 1602 Maurice launched an offensive who after being joined by Francis Vere besieged Grave. A slow siege was conducted and after forcing away a Spanish relief attempt took the surrender of the town on 18 September, and continued their advance through Brabant.Motley pp 104–05 There were no more assaults on Ostend throughout the rest of 1602 but there was an outbreak of pestilence during the summer for both armies causing loss of life and disease.Markham pp 330–32 Another thirty six Dutch infantry companies arrived in November 1602 on a rotation replacing those who had stayed the longest. Spanish attempts to prevent the passage of the ships entering Ostend by bombardment failed. The Spanish had built a large platform near the Western dunes and contented themselves with bombarding the town from there. On the last day of the year in 1602 a huge fleet arrived with provisions to last many more months and again the Spanish failed to stop the ships entering. The relief included cows, sheep, wine, bread and other foodstuffs enough to supply one of the largest cities in Europe.Belleroche pp 65–66 As a result, the market provisions were cheaper in Ostend than any other place in Europe at the time.Motley p 109 1603 Siege of Ostend by an anonymous artist The siege continued on in 1603 with both sides exchanging artillery; in the first few months the Spanish had unsuccessfully tried again to stop Ostend from being provisioned by Dutch and English ships. =Diplomacy= Queen Elizabeth I died in March 1603, and the subsequent succession of James I led to diplomatic talks.Rowse p 413 Both the ambassadors of Spain, Juan de Acuña Tassis, and Juan Fernández de Velasco congratulated the new monarch but also hoped to seek truces and mutual good faith.van Nimwegen p 187 James at the same time discouraged the levy of English soldiers to help defend Ostend and declared a ceasefire at sea, in an effort to start peace talks with Spain. The ascension of James I to power effectively ended the Anglo-Spanish war, but this didn't deter English soldiers fighting for the United Provinces. John Ogle, who had been knighted at Woodstock in 1603, continued to recruit English troops to send to Flanders. He would later become the commander of the English forces at Ostend the same year. Meanwhile, Johan van Oldenbarnevelt heading the delegation of the States tried to attract the complicity of the new English monarch in the conflict in Flanders, of which the focus was Ostend. England's answer would not be effective until the signing of the Treaty of London of 1604, in which England and Spain made peace, agreeing not to assist the Dutch rebels. However, as a way to implement honor, the clause of the treaty would only take place once the siege of Ostend ended, with English and Scottish troops still both active in the field fighting with Maurice and in the garrison itself. =Assault on the Porcespic & the Squares= On the night of 13 April 1603 a storm raged and tides were dangerously high causing more damage in the town and on the defences.Motley pp 111–13 As soon as the stormed had passed away the Spanish launched another attack this time on the \\"Porcespic\\" by a force of nearly 8,000 Spanish and Italians. The position though was well defended by a mixture of Dutch, English and Scots and the attackers were repelled despite managing to gain a foothold on the ramparts. The attack on the redoubt had been a feint however; the Spaniards were at that very moment swarming all over the three external forts, the South Square, the West Square and the Polder Square.van Nimwegen pp 183–84 The Spanish had planted rope-ladders, swung themselves over the walls while the fight had been going on at the Porcespic. The three positions were in the hands of the Spaniards by the time the fight at the Porcespic was over. Dorp did his best to rally the fugitives, and to encourage those who had remained. The next day the Spaniards consolidated their new positions and they turned the newly captured guns upon the main counterscarp of the town. The cost of had been heavy on both sides around fifteen hundred were casualties – besiegers and besieged- during the assault. Despite the loss, the besieged strengthened their inner works making sure the Spanish did not exploit the success. The conclusion that another assault had failed despite the capture of the squares had been costly. By taking them at heavy cost and over a long period of time and with more positions to take, some in the Spanish camp began to doubt the military effectiveness of the Archduke and it was decided to replace him as commander in the field. =The Spinolas= Ambrogio Spinola who replaced the archduke Federico and Ambrosio Spinola, Genoese brothers both offered their services to the King of Spain: Federico Spinola had arrived at the Spanish court in Valladolid, where Philip III made available to him six galleys, with which he was to go to Sluis in a potential for galley borne invasion of England as well as a blockade of Ostend.Belleroche p 67 His fleet of galleys though was attacked by the English at Sesimbra Bay losing two galleys, and with the remaining six sailed towards Sluis but was defeated by an Anglo Dutch squadron in the English channel losing another three.Motley pp 106–09 Frederico would be defeated again and killed in a final battle off Sluis with the Dutch a year later ending any dream of Ostend being blockaded let alone England invaded.Wernham pp 400–01 Meanwhile, Ambrosio Spinola, together with the Count of Fuentes, governor of Milan, recruited 8,000 men in Italy.van Nimwegen p 185 These were at the expense of their own assets and lending by Genoese bankers, who proceeded to Ostend to reinforce the troops of the Archduke.Duffy pp 88–9 After two years of campaigning, the Archduke's progress in the siege were scarce: attempts to attack the Old Haven in the west had not had the desired result, and the dike held by Bucquoy in the east had failed stop the boats from entering the city harbour. The only positions captured were the three external squares but the siege by this time had been enormously costly in terms of money and troops.Motley pp 118 In October 1603, Ambrosio Spinola succeeded Albert of Austria in the command of the Spanish forces. This replacement was a doubt amongst the Spanish commanders since he had been a noble from Genoa, having had very little military experience and that being the study of appropriate books.Belleroche p 70 In the field however his relations with both the soldier and general were appreciated; his personal involvement in the conflict and charismatic personality, serving as an incentive to the troops. He accelerated morale and hoped to introduce innovative and inventive ways to take Ostend.Motley pp 171–72 One of these was an inventor; Pompeo Targone an Italian engineer in the service of the Pope who devised and constructed a number of devices. The Dutch command also changed; Charles van der Noot was replaced due to ill health by Peter van Gieselles in late 1603. 1604Attrition= Spinola hoped to avoid a full-scale assault and provided instead that his troops through the system of field fortifications work slowly towards to the northwestern part of Ostend.Belleroche pp 72–73 Although this procedure was costly, it proved to be successful for the Spaniards. He ordered troops to throw up causeways of earth and fascines across the Yperlet stream which was shielded by constructed gabions. The inventions were not helping the Spanish however as Targone's mobile drawbridge mounted on four ten foot wheels was damaged and immobilized by a single cannon shot; it was then destroyed by more fire from the besieged after which it was abandoned. Between February and March 1604 the city was badly damaged by severe storms and the Spanish continued to dig trenches ever closer and began constructing a mine under Porcepisc and the West Bulwark. On 12 March the Spanish launched a determined effort to carry the lesser Polder bulwark. The little fort was soon overwhelmed and the defenders were at last driven out of it and forced to take refuge in the next work; the first attrition success had been registered for Spinola.Motley pp 175–77 Gieselles was killed soon after observing the captured position, and was succeeded by Colonel John van Loon, who died just four days later by the impact of a cannonball, his provisional substitute Jacques de Bievry was wounded and evacuated to Zealand. Jacob van der Meer, was next to be appointed as commander of Ostend 1 April, but the next day the Polder ravelin was assaulted by the Spanish. In a bloody action lasting many hours the position was taken but again the cost had been heavy, the defenders were all killed and very few escaped. On 18 April Spinola ordered another assault this time on the Western ravelin. After a hand to hand action in which great numbers of officers and soldiers were lost on both sides the fort was eventually carried. This was an important success for the Spanish who had now worked their way with galleries and ditches along the whole length of the counterscarp till they were nearly up with the Porcepsic. Soon after the Spanish assaulted the main Porcepsic itself but were repelled with further losses, but despite this Spinola then undertook a formal siege of the enceinte. =Siege of Sluis= Maurice received the news of the capture of the West and Polder ravelins with astonishment and harboured first fears about the fate of Ostend. He decided to launch an attack at either Ostend or Sluis; the latter was chosen hoping to draw out the Spanish or to capture Sluis, an inland port similar to Ostend as a back up plan.Motley (1869) pp 189–98 Maurice and his cousin William Louis of Nassau, at the head of a Dutch and English army of 11,000 rising to 18,000 men entered Flanders in April 1604, and laid siege to Sluis on 25 April.Knight p 53 Luis de Velasco, General of the Spanish horse, and later Spinola himself attempted to come to the aid of the city but Maurice's forces stood firm and defeated both Velasco and Spinola. As a result, they could not prevent its loss on 19 August, when the governor of the city Mateo Serrano surrendered to the Dutch and English. =New Troy= Jacob Van der Meer who created the New Troy As a result of a threat that the old counterscarp could be taken or demolished, van der Meer ordered a new one built. A plan for this work had already been sent into the place and a distinguished English engineer Ralph Dexter arrived with his assistants to carry out the heavy task who estimated that the labour would take three weeks.Simoni pp 189–90 The new defensive positions would cut the town in two and whole foundations of houses reduced to rubble by the bombardment were removed. Meer was told there was a lack of earth so he ordered dead bodies from both sides to be used to shore up the ramparts of this final refuge; heads and bones were used like fascines but they could not offer adequate resistance to cannon fire. Nova Troia: meaning New Troy or Little Troy was bestowed on the last entrenchment of the besieged since they announced that they would hold out there for as long as the ancient Trojans had defended Ilium.van Nimwegen pp 185–87 The new defences were named after old ones including New Helmund, New Polder and New West Bulwark. By 11 May the Spanish had effected a lodgement in a corner of the Porcepsic and from that point would threaten the new counterscarp before it could be completed. Van der Meer warned the Hague that the garrison was close to exhaustion and was not sure how long he could sustain the defence of the main rampart. He died shortly after however by a musket wound; his position would be taken by Colonel Uytenhoove. On 29 May the long prepared mine was sprung effectively sprung beneath the Porepsic.Motley (1869) pp 180–81 The Spanish then launched a two pronged assault, one on the breach and the other on the Polder bulwark.Belleroche pp 75–76 The Spanish soon crowded into the breach and ferocious fighting ensued. After a long and desperate struggle with heavy losses on both sides the Porepsic was at last carried and held by the Spanish. However, the assault on the Polder bulwark was repelled and further attempts to take the position were called off. On 2 June the mine which he had been constructed beneath the Polder bulwark was sprung. A breach forty feet wide was made and the Spanish launched another assault and leaped into the crater. Emerging from the crater and carrying the Polder at last to their surprise were new defences. The besiegers had worked out where the mine was being dug withdrew from the Polder and built a new set of defences (known as the New Polder) directly behind with flanking batteries for the impending assault. The musketeers and pikemen protected by their new works were ready and after giving heavy fire then counterattacked towards the shocked and confused assailants. After they reeled back after a brief but severe struggle, the Spanish retreated suffering yet more heavy losses. Spinola called off further assaults for two weeks while the work on another mine under the Western bulwark continued but he knew that he had to take Ostend before Maurice could take Sluis. On 7 June, further reinforcements arrived at the stronghold – five companies in all: two English, two Scottish and one from Friesland, all of them under the command of Charles Fairfax. On 17 June the Spanish sprang the mine under the Western bulwark. The assailants attacked the breach and were met again by heavy fire from the besieged with Governor Uytenhoove clad in armour leading his troops. The besieged then launched a counterattack and after an hour of desperate fighting the Spanish were repulsed with heavy loss; Uytenhoove however was severely wounded in the melee. With the repulse in the West Bulwark the Spanish had launched another attack on the Polder. Here too was savage hand-to-hand combat with pikes and clubs pulled from the fascines but the besiegers finally overwhelmed the Polder bulwark, whilst the besieged withdrew to their inner entrenchments. Losses to both sides were high with 1,200 men in total lost in the struggle. Uytenhoove would be replaced by Daniel d'Hertaing; the 5th replacement within the year and the last. On 25 July a convoy managed to get into Ostend with reinforcements of 800 Zealanders which was some compensation but it was to be the last major reinforcement the garrison would get. Soon after unseasonable storms played havoc on the defences of Ostend and with it Dutch supply ships were finding it difficult to make their way into Ostend. Daniel d´Hertaing On 22 August two days after the surrender of Sluis, a combination of high tide and another storm swept away a significant proportion of the New Troy shrinking the defenders position further; the Northern defences were abandoned leaving only the Helmund and Sandhill lightly guarded. Eventually this was abandoned as the position could barely be defended and on 13 September the Spanish took possession that had defied them for nearly three years and began to bombard the walls in front of the Old Haven. The position was now untenable, the besieged were now holding out in the rubble strewn old town. The bloody war of attrition had last succeeded and the garrison sent messengers to Maurice to try and assist. =Surrender= Maurice's capture of Sluis however had made it less essential for the Republic to hold on to Ostend; he and the States General had assessed the situation with William Lodewijk pointing out that any such relief would be difficult.Belleroche pp 77–78 So the decision was made by granting the Ostend garrison the permission to surrender. Daniel d'Hertaing thus decided to send away all the Spanish deserters, heretical preachers and other potential troublemakers that might have caused problems during the surrender. Fighting, however, continued during the days preceding the capitulation; Charles Fairfax, the commander of the English companies still fighting at Ostend, was killed in battle on 17 September. Finally, the accord was signed on 20 September; d'Hertaing surrendered the city to the forces of Ambrosio Spinola. The articles of capitulation granted the defenders full military honours. Aftermath The garrison of no more than 3,000 to 3,500Knight p 54 marched out with flags flying and drums beating and were allowed to go to Flushing without harm while Spinola entertained the officers at a banquet.Motley pp 201–02 At this point the Spaniards and their empire troops had lost between 60,000 and 70,000 men in the fighting. The Dutch and their allies had lost in the region of 30,000 to 40,000; records state that nearly 1,000 healthy soldiers were needed every month to replace the injured, dead and sick. Between July 1601 and June 1604 a total of 151 Dutch and English companies served in Ostend alongside to the figure of 2,800.van Nimwegen p 143 Albert and Isabella After the surrender, the Spanish army entered a completely devastated city that shocked many; Isabella wept at the desolation. Three years, two months and two weeks of siege under almost constant fire of artillery as well as defence efforts to rebuild the walls at the expense of the buildings had left Ostend but a wasteland of rubble.Belleroche pp. 78 Of the 3,000 civilians in Ostend the majority had left en masse during the early part of the siege but by the end only two civilians remained; the wife of a freebooter and her paramour a journeyman blacksmith. After the eventual capture Ambrosio Spinola was appointed field marshal general & supreme commander of the army in Flanders while Juan de Ribas, was made the new Governor of Ostend. The garrison meanwhile arrived at the newly captured Sluis and Maurice received them with the pomp and ceremony and both officers and private men were promoted or otherwise rewarded. Isabella entering the rubble of Ostend; she wept at the desolation The Habsburg authorities considered the capture of Ostend as a propaganda incentive, but the time, money and heavy casualties invested in the siege turned this into a propaganda failure. The economic and military fatigue from the long siege would force both sides to maintain a small truce during the winter of 1604–1605. By the end of that year however, Spinola seized the initiative, bringing the war north of the great rivers for the first time since 1594.Allen p 233 Under Spinola, the Spanish made major advances into Dutch territory, capturing Oldenzaal, Lingen, Rijnberk and Groenlo despite the efforts of Maurice.Belleroche pp 82–83 The Spanish did not repeat the success that Maurice had achieved from 1590–1600, but Spinola had made significant gains in a short time and had caused panic in the Republic when he invaded the Zutphen quarter of Gelderland, showing that the interior of the Republic was still vulnerable to Spanish attack.Malland p 31Markham p 331-32 However, Spinola was satisfied with the psychological effect of his incursion and did not press the attack. Maurice decided on a rare autumn campaign in an attempt to close the apparent gap in the Republic's eastern defences. He retook Lochem, but his siege of Oldenzaal failed in November 1606. This was the last major campaign on both sides before the truce that was concluded in 1609. The strategic result of the Spanish gains of 1605–06 was that the Twenthe and Zutphen quarters were to remain a kind of No man's land right down to 1633, during which they were forced to pay tribute to the Spanish forces that often roamed there at will.Israel (1995), pp. 261–2 The Spanish strategic intent to wrest from the Dutch their only military port in the western part of the North Sea, was offset by the conquest of Sluis by Maurice, which thereafter came to replace Ostend as a base of operations for the Dutch military.Parker p 232Edmundson p 102-03 In 1605 the Dutch East India Company (VoC) made serious inroads into the Portuguese spice trade, by setting up bases in the Moluccas.Israel (1982) pp 5–9 These advances signalled a potential threat that the conflict might spread further in the Spanish overseas empire. That threat became more apparent when the Dutch scored a major naval victory over the Spanish fleet intended to find the merchant ships of the VoC at Gibraltar in 1607. In addition, the scale of the Ostend siege and Spinola's subsequent campaign had exhausted the Spanish treasury so much that in November 1607 Philip III announced a suspension of payments after the Spanish Royal Treasury had declared bankruptcy.Alcalá-Zamora p 30 The balance of power had led to a balance of exhaustion and after decades of war, both sides were finally prepared to open negotiations and so the Twelve Years' Truce bore fruit. As a result, the draining Ostend siege is often seen as a pyrrhic victory for Spain.Edmundson p 102-03 Albert and Isabella entered Ostend in triumph, but it was a Pyrrhic victory =Analysis= Ostend's military machines by Pompeo Giustiniani 1 & 3, the construction of wicker filled with stones and earth were buried in the trenches by the besiegers; they were used in the western part of the town to allow the fording of the Old Haven. 2 & 4, to the east, the deeper flowing channel Geule of the Old Haven, a dam was constructed by Count Bucquoy's troops on which rode artillery pieces to prevent the entry of ships into the harbour during low tide; 6 Cannons mounted on parapets on top of boats that ventured close to bomb the city; this design would be a failure as it sank on its maiden voyage without even firing a shot. 8 Mobile drawbridge or Targone bridge: this too was a failure after it took a direct hit. The siege of Ostend was the longest military campaign of the Eighty Years' War, and one of the longest and bloodiest sieges in world history: during which more than 100,000 people were killed, died, wounded or succumbed to disease; on both sides, the exact amount is impossible to pin down. Four hundred years after the siege, in the refurbishment of the city, human remains were still being discovered. The siege consisted of people from different lands, races and religion. Pope Clement VIII had supported the catholic cause, sending money and military advisers to the siege. Emanuel van Meteren, one of the chroniclers of the siege, defined Ostend as \\"a potpourri of nationalities\\". =Military engineering= With Ostend being supplied from the sea, regular siege warfare techniques were infeasible. The royal army's military engineers were forced to devise new methods to facilitate the capture of the town. The Italian architect Pompeo Targone had many devices designed for this purpose but in the end they were largely ineffective.Simoni p 154 =School of war= According to American historian John Lothrop Motley and others, the siege of Ostend became progressively known as a 'great academy' in which the science and the art of war taught by the most skilful practitioners to all of Europe.Motley pp 63 – 64 Many names were given to the siege by pamphlets such as Military school of Europe, War College and the New Troy. Distinguished families in Europe flocked to the inside and outside of Ostend. Many from Scotland and France as well as England and Holland went to learn of the art of war under Francis Vere whom they considered a distinguished veteran, despite the act that he was considerably annoyed by all the attention.Dunthorne p 75 Legacy and anecdotes * The Ostend campaign was widely covered in the media of the time. The newspaper \\"Belägerung der Statt Ostende\\" (siege of Ostend by Anonymous), circulated throughout Europe and was translated into several languages.Hoenselaars pp 27–8 * Sebastian Vrancx, Cornelis de Wael, Peter Snayers created paintings and prints of the siege. * Cartographers Floris Balthasar and Joan Blaeu, drew maps of the siege. * Don Giovanni de' Medici reported extensively about Pompeo Targoni's military devices and accompanied his letters with sketches and models of the siege of Ostend. Medici ordered his draughtsman to make a huge scale model of the town and defences.Cools, Keblusek & Noldus p 92 * Guido Bentivoglio, Emanuel van Meteren, Hugo Grotius notable historians of the time, were among the witnesses who recorded their experiences. The Leiden printer and publisher, Hendrick van Haestens provided accounts of the fighting in three publications.Simoni p 8 * Cyril Tourneur who was at Ostend from 1601–02 – references the parley stratagem employed by Francis Vere in The Atheist's Tragedy * The Dutch dead included Hendrick van Rensselaer the father of Kiliaen van Rensselaer, ancestor of the prominent American political family – the van Rensselaer family of New York.Spooner (1907), p. 6 * According to legend, the Archduchess Isabella Clara Eugenia promised not to change her underwear until the city of Ostend had been conquered. The long duration of the siege led to the colour of her clothes white to dark.Maerz p 49disraeli p 94–95 * In 1603 the Dutch minted a commemorative medal to the siege of Ostend with a satirical theme, on the obverse of the coin, a fox, representing Spain, looking up at a Rooster in a tree, symbolizing Ostend. On the reverse, a map of the city. The obverse of this jeton refers to Aesop's fable of the Fox and the Crow/rooster. This fable warns against listening to flattery.Jeton1603 (Dordrecht) * The artillery fire against the city became so numerous and intense that the cannonballs fired by the Spanish guns were piled on the outside of the city walls by the defenders. The new cannon shots made them bounce like marbles.

This local cycle of Lorraine, which is completed by Hervis de Metz, Girbers de Metz, Ansis, fils de Girbert, and Von, appears to have a historical basis. Although the actions as recorded cannot be identified with specific historical events, the poems are valuable depictions of the savage feudal wars in the 11th and 12th centuries. An early 20th-century criticF. Settegast, Quellenstudien zur gallo- romanischen Epik, 1904. suggested that these poems resume historical traditions going back to the Vandal irruption of 408 and the Battle of Chalons fought by the Romans and the West Goths against the Huns in 451. The cycle relates three wars against hosts of heathen invaders. In the first of these Charles Martel and his faithful vassal Hervis de Metz fight by an extraordinary anachronism against the Vandals, who have destroyed Reims and besieged other cities. They are defeated in a great battle near Troyes. In the second Hervis is besieged in Metz by the Hongres. He sends first for help to Pippin, who defers his assistance by the advice of the traitor Hardré. Hervis then transfers his allegiance to Ansis of Cologne, by whose help the invaders are repulsed, though Hervis himself is slain. In the third Thierry, king of Morianel sends to Pippin for help against four Saracen kings. He is delivered by a Frankish host, but falls in the battle. Hervis of Metz was the son of a citizen to whom the duke of Lorraine had married his daughter Aelis, and his sons Garin and Begue are the heroes of the chanson which gives its name to the cycle. The dying king Thierry had desired that his daughter Blanchefleur should marry Garin, but when Garin prefers his suit at the court of Pippin, Fromont of Bordeaux puts himself forward as his rival and Hardré, Fromont's father, is slain by Garin. The rest of the poem is taken up with the war that ensues between the Lorrainers and the men of Bordeaux. They finally submit their differences to the king, only to begin their disputes once more. Blanchefleur becomes the wife of Pippin, while Garin remains her faithful servant. One of the most famous passages of the poem is the assassination of Begue by a nephew of Fromont, and Garin, after laying waste his enemy's territory, is himself slain. The remaining songs continue the feud between the two families. According to Paulin Paris, the family of Bordeaux represents the early dukes of Aquitaine, the last of whom, Waifar (745-768) was dispossessed and slain by Pippin the Short, king of the Franks; but the trouvères had in mind no doubt the wars which marked the end of the Carolingian dynasty.

One of the 17 films made by the Martin and Lewis team, it was released on April 27, 1953 by Paramount Pictures. It is the fourth screen adaptation of the 1909 play The Ghost Breaker by Paul Dickey and Charles W. Goddard, previously filmed under that title in 1914 and 1922 and as The Ghost Breakers in 1940. Scared Stiff was Carmen Miranda's final film appearance, as she died two years later in August 1955. Plot Mary Carroll (Lizabeth Scott) inherits her family's ancestral home, located on a small island off Cuba, and, despite warnings and death threats, decides to sail to Havana and take possession of the reputedly haunted castle. She is joined by nightclub entertainer Larry Todd (Martin) who, believing he has killed a mobster, flees New York with a friend, Myron (Lewis). Once on the island the three enter the eerie castle and, after viewing the ghost of one of Mary's ancestors and fighting off a menacing zombie, find the key to the castle's treasure.

McFarland & Company, Inc, 1995. The property has proven successful for Paramount in decades past and they've also filmed two versions in the silent era The Ghost Breaker (1914) directed by Cecil B. DeMille and The Ghost Breaker (1922) starring Wallace Reid. Martin and Lewis had a cameo in Hope and Bing Crosby's Road to Bali the previous year as part of a \\"comedy trade\\" between the two teams. In turn, Hope and Crosby appear for a cameo in Scared Stiff. Both shared a common producer, Cy Howard, who produced Martin and Lewis' first two My Friend Irma pictures and That's My Boy. A few years later, Martin and Frank Sinatra appeared in the final scene of the final Hope and Crosby road picture, Road to Hong Kong. According to Lewis, both he and Martin were against making the picture, as they found the original to be satisfactory. However, because the film was a Paramount property that producer Hal B. Wallis felt was one that could be successful in the comedy team's hands, he held the two to their contract for the film. Scared Stiff was filmed from June 2 through July 17, 1952. It was the first film of the team's available in 3-track, stereophonic sound. Some reviews at the time commented on the soundtrack's use of stereo enhancing gag sequences.\\"Paramount Offers Zany Comedy Team\\", Oakland Tribune, Oakland, CA. June 12, 1953, p. 39. The stereo tracks for this film are now considered lost. As with most films of team's work, it garnered a re-release in 1958 on a double bill with another Martin and Lewis picture, Jumping Jacks. Norman Lear was credited with \\"additional dialogue.\\" It was his first writing credit on a Hollywood film. Scared Stiff turned out to be the last film for Carmen Miranda who died two years later, shortly after completing an episode of The Jimmy Durante Show on TV. In the film, Jerry Lewis impersonates Miranda and lip syncs one of her signature numbers, \\"Mamãe Eu Quero\\". The Ghostbusters series of films, though not a product of Dickey or Goddard, continue on in the same spirit as their Ghost Breaker predecessors. Home media Paramount released Scared Stiff on home video in November 1992. The film was included on an eight-film DVD set, the Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis Collection: Volume One, released on October 31, 2006. Reception Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote, \\"The nonsense herein contrived is not an inspired presentation of the comic qualities of the two boys.\\" Variety wrote that Martin and Lewis \\"provide a free-wheeling round of slapstick hilarity\\". Writing in The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, academic Peter Dendle called the film an annoying remake that \\"mostly sticks to the original except for the addition of several bad song and dance numbers and even worse comedy routines\\". On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds a rating of 71% based on 7 reviews, with an average rating of 5.83/10.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1047550_scared_stiff ReferencesExternal links  Category:1953 films Category:1950s comedy horror films Category:1950s comedy mystery films Category:1953 musical comedy films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American comedy horror films Category:American comedy mystery films Category:American film remakes Category:American films based on plays Category:American haunted house films Category:American musical comedy films Category:American zombie comedy films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by George Marshall Category:Films produced by Hal B.

Royal Navy In the Royal Navy of the eighteenth century, peacetime guard ships were usually third-rate or fourth-rate ships of the line. The larger ships in the fleet would be laid up \\"in ordinary\\" with skeleton crews, the spars, sails and rigging removed and the decks covered by canvas – the historic equivalent of a reserve fleet. By contrast the guard ships would carry sails and rigging aboard, be defouled below the waterline to increase their speed under sail, and be manned by at least one quarter of their normal crew. A port or major waterway may be assigned a single guardship which would also serve as the naval headquarters for the area. Multiple guardships were required at larger ports and Royal Dockyards, with the largest single vessel routinely serving as the Port Admiral's flagship. If war was declared, or an enemy fleet was sighted, the guard ships could become fully manned and ready for sea in a matter of hours or days, as opposed to the months it could take to recommission a ship \\"in ordinary\\". This was of greatest utility to the British prior to the outbreak of the War of Jenkins' Ear against Spain. On 10 July, 1739 King George II authorised preparations for a maritime assault on Spanish colonies. For this purpose, Admiral Edward Vernon was able to assemble a fleet of eight fully armed and provisioned guardships within ten days of the Royal Command. The fleet was so quickly assembled that it reached the Spanish West Indies on 22 October, one day before war was formally declared.

Gyekye was an emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the University of Ghana, and a Visiting Professor of Philosophy and African-American studies at Temple University. Career He was educated at Mfantsipim School. Gyekye studied first at the University of Ghana, then at Harvard University, where he obtained his Ph.D. with a thesis on Græco–Arabic philosophy. He was a Fellow of the Smithsonian Institution's Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, and is a life-time Fellow of the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences. Philosophical viewsPerson and community= Gyekye challenges the view that in African thought, community confers personhood on the individual and thus the individual's identity is merely derivative of the community. He attributes this view to African philosopher Ifeanyi Menkiti, as well as socialist political figures like Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah, Senegal's Léopold Senghor, and Tanzania's Julius Nyerere. Instead, Gyekye argues that African thought ascribes definite value to the individual. He cites an Akan proverb, \\"All persons are children of God; no one is a child of the earth\\" in support of his argument that a person is conceived as a theomorphic being, having in their nature an aspect of God. This soul (known as okra to the Akan) is described as divine and originating with God. Thus, he argues, a person is viewed as more than just a material or physical object, but children of God, and therefore intrinsically valuable. This intrinsic value, it is argued, makes nonsense of the view that the individual's value stems solely from the community. Similarly, he argues that the person is conceived as a unique individual (as in the proverb \\"antelope's soul is one, duiker's another\\"), so that each individual is self-complete, and the reality of the person cannot be derivative and posterior to that of the community. While Gyekye argues that the individual is ontologically complete, he also acknowledges that people live in community, as in the proverb, \\"When a person descends from heaven, he/she descends into a human society.\\" In his view, a person's abilities are not sufficient for survival, so that community is necessary for the survival of the individual, as articulated in the proverb, \\"A person is not a palm tree that he/she should be self-sufficient.\\" Thus, he argues, it is error to holds that African philosophy denies the individual, but instead, the individual is an intrinsically valuable child of God, intricately linked into a web of human relationships. He cites a Ghanaian artist who wrote, \\"we are linked together like a chain; we are linked in life, we are linked in death; persons who share a common blood relation never break away from one another.\\" Bibliography *1975: \\"Philosophical relevance of Akan proverbs\\" (Second Order: An African Journal of Philosophy 4:2, pp. 45–53) *1977: \\"Akan language and the materialism thesis: a short essay on the relations between philosophy and language\\" (Studies in Language 1:1, pp 237 44) *1978: \\"Akan concept of a person\\" (International Philosophical Quarterly 18:3, pp. 277–87) *1987: An Essay on African Philosophical Thought: The Akan Conceptual Scheme **(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) **1995: revised edition (Philadelphia: Temple University Press) *1988: The Unexamined Life: Philosophy and the African Experience (Ghana Universities Press) *1991: \\"Man as a moral subject: the perspective of an African philosophical anthropology\\" in The Quest for Man: The Topicality of Philosophical Anthropology, ed.

He was a fast bowler who played Test cricket for the West Indies, twice taking seven wickets in a Test innings. Arriving in England in 1972, he played first-class cricket for Hampshire County Cricket Club and then later for Leicestershire County Cricket Club. Roberts was the first Antiguan to play Test cricket for the West Indies, thus leading the way for many of his famous countrymen including Viv Richards, Richie Richardson and Curtly Ambrose. In October 2005, Roberts was inducted into the United States Cricket Hall of Fame, becoming the second Antiguan to be recognised. In 2009, Roberts was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. International career Roberts formed part of the \\"quartet\\" of West Indian fast bowlers from the mid-Seventies to the early Eighties (the others being Michael Holding, Joel Garner and Colin Croft) that had such a devastating effect on opposition batsmen at both Test and One Day International level. He was also part of the West Indies team that won the first two Prudential World Cups in England in 1975 and 1979. By his own reckoning, the best spell Roberts ever delivered was during the Headingley Test of the West Indies' 1976 tour of England: \\"I only got three wickets, but in my mind there was a decision given against me. It was a leg-before decision against Peter Willey, where he played right back onto his stumps to a fuller delivery. I would've bowled England out that afternoon if the umpire had given me the decision.\\" Despite an excellent record in Tests his international career was relatively short and ended in 1983. Imran Khan (former captain Pakistan national cricket team) once described a ball bowled to him by Andy Roberts as the fastest and most terrifying he had ever faced. One of his trademarks was the use of two different bouncers. One was delivered at a slower pace and was often dealt with quite easily by the batsman. However, this was a ploy by Roberts to lull the batsman into a false sense of security. Roberts would then deliver the second bouncer, pitching in a similar spot to the first, but delivered at far greater pace. The batsman would attempt to play this delivery in the same fashion as the first slower bouncer only to be surprised by the extra pace and bounce of the ball. Many batsmen were dismissed, and many more struck painful blows, by Roberts using this ploy. Roberts was also the part of the West Indies team which ended up as runnersup in the 1983 ICC Cricket World Cup. John Snow believes that Roberts saw reduced effectiveness after being overbowled during 1974 by Hampshire and West Indies.p41, John Snow, 'Cricket Rebel' After cricket Andy Roberts' contribution to West Indies cricket has continued since his retirement as a player. As an administrator overseeing the preparation of pitches, he helped prepare the pitches in Antigua on which Brian Lara twice broke the world record for highest Test scores. Roberts worked with Bangladesh's fast bowlers in 2001 and again in 2005, and also helped coach India's seam bowling all- rounder Irfan Pathan in 2006. Roberts joined the West Indies Cricket Board selection panel in July 2006. In 2008 Roberts was one of 12 former West Indies cricketers who made up the 'Stanford Legends' who promoted the Stanford 20/20. Roberts was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Nation (KCN) by the Antiguan Barbudan government on 28 February 2014.

He is the eldest son of late Lebanese president Camille Chamoun and brother of Dany Chamoun. Political careerThe Lebanese Civil War years= Dory Chamoun is the elder son of the late Camille Chamoun (1900–1987), who was President of Lebanon from 1952 to 1958. An industrialist by profession, he initially showed much less interest in politics than his younger brother, Dany Chamoun. During the Lebanese Civil War, Dory briefly replaced his brother Dany as commander of the NLP's military wing, the Tigers Militia, between July–August 1980, prior to its disbandment by order of their father following the Safra massacre perpetrated by the Lebanese Forces (LF) led by Bachir Gemayel, which eliminated the backbone of the NLP militia and incorporated the rest into the LF structure.Katz, Russel, and Volstad, Armies in Lebanon (1985), p. 8.Gordon, The Gemayels (1988), p. 58.McGowan, Roberts, Abu Khalil, and Scott Mason, Lebanon: a country study (1989), p. 240.Hoy and Ostrovsky, By Way of Deception (1990), p. 302.O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), p. 100.Menargues, Les Secrets de la guerre du Liban (2004), pp. 53-55. =The post-war years= After Dany was assassinated in October 1990, in what is qualified as an \\"unfair trial\\" by several organizations such as Amnesty International, Samir Geagea, the Christian leader of the Lebanese Forces, was subsequently tried for the murder. The fairness of the trial was challenged by Dory who declared publicly on 25 April 2005 that he believed Geagea to be innocent and demanded a new investigation to uncover the real assassins, whom he suspected of being Syrian agents. Nevertheless, he agreed to take over the leadership of the National Liberal Party, which his father had founded in 1958 and which Dany was leading at the time of his death. He has since travelled extensively, visiting Lebanese communities in France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States, encouraging them to oppose the Syrian military occupation of Lebanon. He is known to be wary of foreign support; he has stated publicly that he does not trust Israel, which he accuses of \\"abandoning\\" Lebanese Christians at a time when they depended on Israeli aid, and has frequently expressed doubts about the sincerity of American and French demands for a withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanon. He has expressed deep disappointment that countries to which the Lebanese opposition has looked for support have not, in his opinion, lived up to their expectations. Chamoun led the National Liberal Party in its boycott of the last three parliamentary elections (1992, 1996, and 2000), which he claimed were gerrymandered and rigged to produce a pro-Syrian majority. Since the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on 14 February 2005, he has been a prominent participant in the Cedar Revolution protests that have swept Beirut, calling for the total withdrawal of all Syrian troops from Lebanese territory, the resignation of the pro- Syrian government, and the holding of free and fair parliamentary and presidential elections. Chamoun's political boycott did not extend to municipal politics. He himself served as Mayor of the Deir el-Qamar municipality from 2004 until his election on the parliament seat for the Chouf in 2009. His eldest son, Camille, is also politically active and was an unsuccessful parliamentary candidate in the general election held in May and June 2005. On 27 January 2006, Dory Chamoun announced his candidacy for the vacated Maronite seat in Lebanon's Baabda-Aley by-election alongside reporter May Chidiac who was also running for the same post. However, the seat went to Pierre Daccache, whom most of Lebanon's Christian parties accepted as a consensus candidate. On 8 June 2009, Dory Chamoun was elected member of parliament for the Maronite seat in the Shouf area. Personal life On 2 November 2012, Dory Chamoun suffered a heart attack. He was transferred to St.Charles Hospital at Fiyadieh whereby he underwent an angioplasty surgery. On 5 March 2013, Dory Chamoun's wife Nayla Gabriel Tabet died. She was 78.

Biography Hamerling was born into a poor family at Kirchberg am Walde in Lower Austria. He displayed an early genius for poetry; his youthful attempts at drama excited the interest and admiration of some influential persons. Owing to their assistance young Hamerling was able to attend the gymnasium in Vienna and afterwards the University of Vienna. In 1848 he joined the students' legion, which played a large part in the revolutions of the capital, and in 1849 shared in the defence of Vienna against the imperialist troops of Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz. After the collapse of the revolutionary movement he was obliged to hide for a couple of weeks to escape arrest. For the next few years he pursued his studies in natural science and philosophy, and in 1855 became master at the Gymnasium at Trieste. For many years he was ill, and in 1866 retired on a pension, which in acknowledgment of his literary works was increased by the government to a sum sufficient to enable him to live carefree until he died at his villa in Stiftingstal near Graz, Austria. A popular edition of Hamerlings works in four volumes was published by M. M. Rabenlechner (Hamburg, 1900). Evaluations1911 Encyclopædia Britannica= The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica characterizes Hamerling as one of the most remarkable poets of the modern Austrian school, describing his imagination as rich and his poems as full of life and colour. What it terms his most popular poem, Ahasver in Rom (1866), of which the emperor Nero is the central figure, is said to show at its best what is alleged to be the author's brilliant talent for description. Among his other works, 1911 Britannica mentions Venus im Exil (1858); Der König von Sion (1869), characterized as a generally recognized masterpiece; Die sieben Todsünden (1872) Blätter im Winde (1887); Homunculus (1888); Amor und Psyche (1882). The 1911 Britannica goes on to describe his novel, Aspasia (1876), as giving a finely-drawn description of the Periclean age, but like his tragedy Danton und Robespierre (1870), somewhat stilted, showing that Hamerling's genius, though rich in imagination, was ill-suited for the realistic presentation of character.

ORR regulates Network Rail by setting its activities and funding requirements for each Control Period, ensuring train operators have fair access to the railway network, and enforcing compliance with its network licence. ORR also regulates High Speed 1, the Channel Tunnel, and also acts as the appeal body, controls the network statement and monitors the competitive situation of rail services in Northern Ireland. It is the competition authority for the railways and enforces consumer protection law in relation to the railways. From April 2015 ORR assumed responsibility for monitoring Highways England's management of the strategic road network – the motorways and main 'A' roads in England – and advising the Secretary of State for Transport on the levels of funding and performance requirements for each Road Period.  History ORR was established as the Office of Rail Regulation on 5 July 2004 by the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003, replacing the Rail Regulator. It became the Office of Rail and Road on 1 April 2015 following ORR's appointment as Monitor for Highways England under the Infrastructure Act 2015.  FunctionsNetwork Rail= Network Rail – the owner and operator of most of the railway network in England, Scotland and Wales – operates under a network licence. ORR holds Network Rail to account through the network licence which includes conditions relating to its management of the railway network, information provision and safety obligations. ORR is also responsible for setting Network Rail's outputs and funding requirement for each Control Period, including the access charges paid by train and freight operating companies to Network Rail for the use of its infrastructure. ORR then holds Network Rail to account against the delivery, performance and service levels set out in its final determination. ORR is concerned with the regulation of Network Rail as the monopoly owner of much of Britain's railway infrastructure. It does not play a direct role in regulating fares (responsibility for this lies with the Department for Transport). =High Speed 1= ORR regulates the High Speed 1 line between St Pancras and the Channel Tunnel. This line is operated by HS1 Ltd, and is separate to the rest of the national railway network operated by Network Rail, but ORR regulates it in much the same way. This includes holding HS1 to account for its performance, service and value for money for passengers and the freight industry. =Rail safety= ORR regulates health and safety for the entire mainline rail network in Britain, as well as London Underground, light rail, trams and the heritage sector. ORR has a team of more than 100 rail health and safety inspectors and professionals who have powers of enforcement. Their remit is to ensure that the railway is safe, and is kept safe, at a reasonably practicable cost. =Fair access and fair treatment= A primary role for ORR is to enforce consumer law and compliance with the conditions contained in Network Rail’s and train operators’ licences, to help ensure that all rail users get the service to which they are entitled. =Highways England= Highways England operates, maintains and improves England's strategic road network, operating under a licence (managed by the Department for Transport). ORR monitors and enforces the performance and efficiency of Highways England against the outputs set out in the government's Road Investment Strategy and licence, and advises the Secretary of State for Transport on the funding levels and performance requirements for each Road Period. Statutory duties In carrying out its railway functions, ORR must discharge its statutory duties, which are its formal objectives. These are laid down in section 4 of the Railways Act 1993, and include the protection of the interests of users and the promotion of competition, efficiency and economy in the provision of railway services. ORR’s duties as the Monitor for Highways England are set out in section 12 of the Infrastructure Act 2015. These require that ORR must exercise its functions in the way it considers most likely to promote the performance and efficiency of Highways England. ORR also has a role within The Railways (Access, Management and Licensing of Railway Undertakings) Regulations 2016. Public law obligations Like other public authorities, ORR must comply with the rules of administrative law, and is amenable to judicial review, so it must act lawfully, rationally, proportionately and in accordance with the relevant rules of procedure. Although operationally independent of central government as a non-ministerial government department, it is still covered by legislation such as the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Management All members of the ORR board are appointed by the Secretary of State for Transport for a fixed term of up to five years. The current ORR Chair is Declan Collier, appointed in January 2019. John Larkinson is acting as interim Chief Executive Officer. ORR employs approximately 300 people, with offices in London, Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Manchester and York. Statistics ORR is the main provider of railway industry statistics in Britain. ORR publishes a range of statistics about railway performance, rail usage and safety – to support performance evaluation, analysis and decision-making for the railway industry. It produces usage statistics for each station.

It has also been unofficially referred to as the Deficit Reduction Act of 1993. Part XIII of the law is also called the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993. The bill stemmed from a budget proposal made by Clinton in February 1993; he sought a mix of tax increases and spending reductions that would cut the deficit in half by 1997. Though every congressional Republican voted against the bill, it passed by narrow margins in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The act increased the top federal income tax rate from 31% to 39.6% , increased the corporate income tax rate, raised fuel taxes, and raised various other taxes. The bill also included $255 billion in spending cuts over a five-year period. The effects of the bill helped the US federal government to experience in 1998 its first budget surplus since the 1960s. Provisions * Previously, the top individual tax rate of 31% applied to all income over $51,900. The Act created a new bracket of 36% for income above $115,000 and 39.6% for income above $250,000. * Previously, corporate income above $335,000 was taxed at 34%. The Act created new brackets of 35% for income from $10 million to $15 million, 38% for income from $15 million to $18.33 million, and 35% for income above $18.33 million. * The 2.9% Medicare tax had previously been capped to apply to the first $135,000 of income. The cap was removed. * Transportation fuels taxes were raised by 4.3 cents per gallon. * The portion of Social Security benefits subject to income taxes was raised from 50% to 85%. * The phaseout of the personal exemption and the limit on itemized deductions were permanently extended. * The AMT tax rate was increased from 24% to tiered rates of 26% and 28%. * Part IV Section 14131: Expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit and added inflation adjustments. * $255 billion in spending cuts over a five-year period; much of the cuts affected Medicare or the military. Legislative history Clinton inherited major budget deficits left over from the Reagan and Bush administrations; fiscal year 1992 had seen a $290 billion deficit. In order to cut the deficit, Bentsen, Panetta, and Rubin urged Clinton to pursue both tax increases and spending cuts. They argued that by taming the deficit, Clinton would encourage Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to lower interest rates, which, along with increased confidence among investors, would lead to an economic boom. Some of Clinton's advisers also believed that a focus on cutting the deficit would be politically beneficial since it would potentially help Democrats shed their supposed \\"tax and spend\\" reputation. Though Secretary of Labor Robert Reich argued that stagnant earnings represented a bigger economic issue than the deficits, Clinton decided to pursue deficit reduction as the major economic priority of his first year in office. In doing so, he reluctantly abandoned a middle class tax cut that he had championed during the campaign. Clinton presented his budget plan to Congress in February 1993, proposing a mix of tax increases and spending reductions that would cut the deficit in half by 1997. Republican leaders strongly opposed any tax increase and pressured congressional Republicans to unite in opposition to Clinton's budget, and not a single Republican would vote in favor of Clinton's proposed bill. Senate Democrats eliminated the implementation of a new energy tax in favor of an increase in the gasoline tax, but Clinton successfully resisted efforts to defeat his proposed expansion of the earned income tax credit. Ultimately every Republican in Congress voted against the bill, as did a number of Democrats. Vice President Al Gore broke a tie in the Senate on both the Senate bill and the conference report. The House bill passed 219-213 on Thursday, May 27, 1993. The House passed the conference report on Thursday, August 5, 1993, by a vote of 218 to 216 (217 Democrats and 1 independent (Bernie Sanders (I-VT)) voting in favor; 41 Democrats and 175 Republicans voting against). The Senate passed the conference report on the last day before their month's vacation, on Friday, August 6, 1993, by a vote of 51 to 50 (50 Democrats plus Vice President Gore voting in favor, 6 Democrats (Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), Richard Bryan (D-NV), Sam Nunn (D-GA), Bennett Johnston Jr. (D-LA), David L. Boren (D-OK), and Richard Shelby (D-AL) now (R-AL)) and 44 Republicans voting against). President Clinton signed the bill on August 10, 1993. The government was able to raise additional revenue, which helped to balance the budget and, by the end of the 1990s, began to reduce privately-held public debt. Alternatives Some alternatives to the bill included a proposal by Senator David Boren (D-OK), which things would have kept much of the tax increase on upper-income payers but eliminated all energy tax increases and scaled back the Earned Income Tax Credit. It was endorsed by Bill Cohen (R-ME), Bennett Johnston (D-LA), and John Danforth (R-MO). Boren's proposal never passed committee. Clinton himself claimed he had an alternative tax proposal that favored taxes on energy. In 1995, he expressed belief that taxes had been raised too much (in 1997, Congress cut the capital gains tax from 28% to 20%). Another proposal was offered in the House of Representatives by John Kasich (R-OH). He sponsored an amendment that would have reduced the deficit by cutting $355 billion in spending with $129 billion of the cuts coming from entitlement programs (the actual bill cut entitlement spending by only $42 billion). The amendment would have eliminated any tax increases. The amendment failed by a 138-295 vote, with many Republicans voting against the amendment and only six Democrats voting in favor. Aftermath Combined with a strong economy, the 1993 deficit reduction plan produced smaller budget deficits each year. In 1998, the federal government experienced the first budget surplus since the 1960s. Reflecting the perceived importance of the budget surplus, the New York Times described the end of budget deficits as \\"the fiscal equivalent of the fall of the Berlin Wall.\\" ReferencesWorks cited=  External links * Full text of the Act * Senate roll call vote * House roll call vote * Summary of OBRA-93 * nysscpa.org * A Summary Report Category:1993 in American law Category:United States federal taxation legislation 1993 Category:1993 in economics ","title":"Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993"},{"id":"1622355","text":"Tom Constanten (born March 19, 1944, Long Branch, New Jersey, United States) is an American keyboardist, best known for playing with Grateful Dead from 1968 to 1970. BiographyEarly career= Known among friends and colleagues as T.C., Tom Constanten wrote orchestral pieces as a teenager while growing up in Las Vegas, Nevada and briefly studied astronomy and music at University of California, Berkeley, where he met future Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh in the summer of 1961. The two became roommates and dropped out; shortly thereafter, they enrolled in a graduate-level course taught by Italian modernist composer Luciano Berio at Mills College. Constanten also studied piano with Mario Feninger. In 1962, he lived in Brussels and Paris, met Umberto Eco, and studied on a scholarship with members of the Darmstadt School, including Berio, Henri Pousseur, Karlheinz Stockhausen and Pierre Boulez.Prendrergast, p. 242Digital Interviews After briefly rooming with Lesh in Las Vegas and returning to the San Francisco Bay Area, Constanten performed with an improvisational quintet formed by Steve Reich. The group's unusual style was influenced by both jazz and Stockhausen. In a 1964 performance, the ensemble played serialism-influenced compositions by both Constanten and Lesh. Although he walked out from the performance, minimalist composer Terry Riley later allowed the ensemble to premiere In C. However, only Reich and one other member of the group, saxophonist-composer Jon Gibson, appeared in the seminal performance.Strickland, Minimalism: Origins, p. 185–186. =US Air Force service= Faced with the possibility of conscription amid the escalation of the Vietnam War, Constanten enlisted in the United States Air Force in 1965 as a computer programmer. Although the Air Force was deployed in southeast Asia, he was not given a security clearance after divulging his past communist sympathies and remained stationed domestically at Nellis Air Force Base near Las Vegas; while on leave, he used LSD and composed music on military mainframe computers, including the IBM 1401. By 1967, he had been promoted to sergeant. During this period, he first collaborated with the Grateful Dead as a session musician on Anthem of the Sun (1968); Constanten used several compensatory three-day passes to travel to Los Angeles to record with the band. (T.C. listed himself as a Buddhist on his military records, so when the Grateful Dead scheduled a recording session, he declared a spurious Buddhist holiday and went to L.A.I was there.) =Tenure in the Grateful Dead= After sitting in with the band during live performances as his schedule permitted, the day after an honorable discharge, Constanten made his stage debut with the Dead as their permanent keyboardist on November 23, 1968, at the Memorial Auditorium in Athens, Ohio. He later remarked that \\"it was a case of being an Air Force sergeant one day and a rock & roll star the next.\\" He remained with the group for three albums and left by mutual agreement after the band's infamous New Orleans drug bust following a January 30, 1970 show at the Warehouse. \\"It was like a magic carpet ride that was there for me to step on,\\" he says. \\"I would have been a fool not to.\\" Although Constanten nominally replaced founding keyboardist Ron \\"Pigpen\\" McKernan, the latter musician stayed on with the band as a frontman-percussionist; in light of their mutual abstinence from psychedelics, they became \\"as close as two heterosexual males could be,\\" shared a house in Novato, California, and bunked together while touring. While he had successfully contributed to their complex experimental music, his instrumental style was then grounded in classical technique and bore little consanguinity with the folk, blues, and country and western stylings that would largely anchor the band's oeuvre throughout the early 1970s. Although he performed with a full panoply of keyboard instruments (including piano and harpsichord) on 1969's Aoxomoxoa, Constanten initially played a double-manual Vox Continental II combo organ on stage before switching to McKernan's Hammond B-3 in the spring of 1969; nevertheless, he was dissatisfied with the comparatively dulcet timbres of both instruments vis-à-vis guitarists Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir in a live performance context: \\"[T]heir sounds ranged from barely acceptable to cringeworthy. For another, I couldn't find a place for the sustained sound of an organ in a guitar band context—ahhh, for a piano! Furthermore, the action of an organ keyboard, electronic or not, was sufficiently different from that of a piano, which was all I'd known until then, to be an obstacle to my getting a feel for the music. Basically, I wasn't an organist. A Merl Saunders or a Melvin Seals could've stepped in... but they weren't there. As if that weren't enough, the amplification technology of the times was much kinder to guitars, with their direct pickups, than it was to pianos. All the electric keyboards available then, you might recall, represented some sort of cheesy compromise with the real thing...\\" Several band members and employees felt that he did not fit in with the Dead ethos despite his longstanding friendships with Lesh and Garcia; for example, he was a member of the Church of Scientology throughout his tenure with the band and thus declined to become re-involved with LSD and other drugs.McNally, p. 352Jackson, p. 179 According to band manager Rock Scully, \\"He was so different. You know, he was like a crew cut. He was like a Marine in a prison camp full of Japanese. He was like our boss in a way. Nobody could go for the hard-wire technology of his brainpower. I was told I was too hard on him, too. But I had no beef.\\" Echoing Scully's sentiments, drummer Bill Kreutzmann noted in his 2015 memoir that he \\"got along really well\\" with Constanten and thought he was \\"a cool enough guy\\"; however, he felt that \\"[Constanten] had this thing where, for whatever reason, he would perform at rehearsals pretty darn well, but then, when we'd be in front of an audience, it was like he froze or something. He couldn't let go... [H]e couldn't trust the music to lead... [I]f you can't do that, you can't be in the band.\\" Although Kreutzmann \\"felt no animosity\\" toward Constanten upon his departure, he did not consider him to be a \\"card-carrying member\\" of the Grateful Dead. =Life after the Dead= After leaving the Grateful Dead, Constanten collaborated with Joe McCord, a mime who performed as \\"Rubber Duck.\\" This culminated in Constanten writing the music for McCord's Tarot, a mime play based on the tarot deck that was performed at the Chelsea Theater Center in Brooklyn, New York in 1970. Although a proposed Off-Broadway run in Manhattan failed to manifest, the musicians associated with the project (including Constanten, former Country Joe and the Fish drummer Gary \\"Chicken\\" Hirsh and composer Paul Dresher) performed several shows at the Village Gate before relocating to Los Angeles, where they continued to perform as Touchstone, an instrumental rock band. During this period, Constanten worked on a proposed musical version of Frankenstein for Michael Butler, who considered mounting a production of Tarot. Touchstone's debut album (Tarot) was released by United Artists Records in 1972 and contained much of the music intended for the play; however, according to Constanten, \\"United Artists Records was cool to instrumental bands, though, so they didn’t promote the album a whole lot. The fact that the show didn’t catch fire during the New York run didn’t help. So the second album our contract mentioned (and we had material for) evaporated into the fog on the Hollywood hills.\\"http://www.pooterland.com/index2/looking_glass/tom_constanten/tom_constanten.htmlhttp://www.deaddisc.com/disc/Tarot.htm Shortly thereafter, Constanten held a Creative Associate fellowship in composition at SUNY Buffalo's new music-oriented Center of the Creative and Performing Arts during the 1974–1975 academic year. In 1986, he was artist in residence at Harvard University.http://digital.lib.buffalo.edu/cdm/search/searchterm/Constanten,%20Tom/mode/exacthttp://www.tomconstanten.com/base/1981-87%20TC%20Base%208.pdf He has also taught at the San Francisco Art Institute. From 1986 to 1993, he was the house pianist for the radio program West Coast Weekend, playing solo piano and interstitial music. In 1994, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the Grateful Dead. Constanten continues to tour as a solo pianist. He has also played with the reconstituted lineup of Jefferson Starship as a touring member, most notably during the Heroes of Woodstock tour; several of his performances with the group are showcased in the Mick's Picks series of live albums.http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tom-constanten- mn0000932098/credits He has also sat in with a variety of Grateful Dead tribute bands, including Dark Star Orchestra and Terrapin Flyer. As of 2015, Constanten is a member of Alphonso Johnson's Jazz Is Dead, an instrumental Grateful Dead cover band that interprets classic Dead songs with jazz influences.http://www.relix.com/news/detail/jazz_is_dead_to_reform_with_tom_constanten After meeting Grateful Dead sound engineer Bob Bralove at Jerry Garcia's memorial service, the duo formed Dose Hermanos, a showcase for their improvisational keyboard work; since 1998, they have toured irregularly and released five albums.http://www.jambands.com/features/2014/05/19/bob-bralove- and-tom-constanten-dose-hermanos-acoustic-batique Philosophy In 2002, Tom Constanten stated in an interview: Personal life Constanten currently resides in Charlotte, North Carolina. He has two children, Clarissa and Jeffrey. In 2012, he recovered from a heart attack.http://www.kentucky.com/entertainment/music-news- reviews/article44384946.html On August 16, 2016, Constanten reported on Facebook that he was in the hospital with a broken neck, after slipping and falling on wet cement on August 10, while walking to the post office from his car in a heavy rain.//http://www.antimusic.com/news/16/August/17Grateful_Dead_Star_Breaks_His_Neck.shtml Discography *Anthem of the Sun (1968) – Grateful Dead *Aoxomoxoa (1969) – Grateful Dead *Live/Dead (1969) – Grateful Dead *U (1970) – The Incredible String Band *Zabriskie Point (1970) – various artists *Tarot (1972) – Touchstone *Duino Elegies (1988) – Robert Hunter *Fresh Tracks in Real Time (1989) – Tom Constanten *Alternate Versions (1989) – Henry Kaiser *OutSides (1990) – Tom Constanten *Heart's Desire (1990) – Henry Kaiser *Sonatas by Beethoven, Schubert and Hadyn (1991) – Tom Constanten *Hope You Like Our New Direction (1991) – Henry Kaiser *A Victorian Christmas (1991) – Robin Petrie *Nightfall of Diamonds (1992) – Tom Constanten *Morning Dew (1993) – Tom Constanten *A Victorian Noel (1993) – Robin Petrie *Eternity Blue (1994) – Henry Kaiser *Dead Ringers (1994) – Dead Ringers *Embryonic Journey (1994) – Jorma Kaukonen and Tom Constanten *Grayfolded (1994) – Grateful Dead *The Siamese Stepbrothers (1995) – The Siamese Stepbrothers *Live in Concert at the Piano (1996) – Tom Constanten *Blues For Allah Project (1996) – Joe Gallant and Illuminati *Sonic Roar Shock (1997) – Dose Hermanos *Live at the Fillmore East 2-11-69 (1997) – Grateful Dead *Fallout from the Phil Zone (1997) – Grateful Dead *Live from California (1998) – Dose Hermanos *Shadow of the Invisible Man (DVD, 1999) – Dose Hermanos *Grateful Dreams (2000) – Tom Constanten *Search for Intelligent Life (2000) – Dose Hermanos *Dick's Picks Volume 16 (2000) – Grateful Dead *88 Keys to Tomorrow (2002) – Tom Constanten *Dick's Picks Volume 26 (2002) – Grateful Dead *Bright Shadows (2004) – Dose Hermanos *Jan 29, 2004, Charlotte, NC (2004) – Dark Star Orchestra *The Complete Fillmore West 1969 (2005) – Grateful Dead *Fillmore West 1969 (2005) – Grateful Dead *Shimmy Shack (2005) – Shimmy Shack *For Rex: The Black Tie Dye Ball (2006) – The Zen Tricksters w/ Donna Godchaux, Mickey Hart, Tom Constanten, David Nelson, Michael Falzarano, Rob Barraco *Moved to Stanleyville (2006) – Tom Constanten and Ken Foust *Deep Expressions, Longtime Known (2006) – Tom Constanten *Gram Parsons Archives Vol.1: Live at the Avalon Ballroom 1969 (2007) – The Flying Burrito Brothers *Dave's Picks Volume 10 (2014) – Grateful Dead *30 Trips Around the Sun (2015) – Grateful Dead *30 Trips Around the Sun: The Definitive Live Story 1965–1995 (2015) – Grateful Dead *Fillmore West 1969: February 27th (2018) – Grateful Dead *Dave's Picks Volume 30 (2019) – Grateful Dead  Notes  References    * Tom Constanten collection at the Internet Archive * Tom Constanten at deaddisc.com *  External links  * * Official Grateful Dead Website Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:People from Long Branch, New Jersey Category:American rock keyboardists Category:Grateful Dead members Category:Jefferson Starship members Category:American people of Norwegian descent Category:American Scientologists Category:Pupils of Karlheinz Stockhausen Category:American rock pianists Category:American male pianists Category:American classical pianists Category:Male classical pianists Category:American expatriates in France Category:American expatriates in Belgium Category:People from Novato, California Category:20th-century American pianists Category:Jazz Is Dead members Category:20th-century American keyboardists Category:Relix Records artists ","title":"Tom Constanten"},{"id":"1622366","text":"Andrew Watson (born 3 September 1959) is a Scottish former professional footballer and coach. During his playing career, Aberdeen-born Watson had spells at Aberdeen, Leeds United, Heart of Midlothian and Hibernian. As a coach, he has worked with clubs in Scotland and England, and has been part of the Scottish national team management setup in two separate spells. CareerPlayer= Beginning his professional career with his hometown club Aberdeen under manager Alex Ferguson, Watson was a winner of the 1979–80 Scottish Premier Division title and the 1982–83 Scottish Cup, and was also an unused substitute in the 1983 European Cup Winners' Cup Final victory. However he was never a regular starter in that strong Dons team and left the club at the end of that season. Watson joined Leeds United for a fee of £60,000, brought to the club by Scottish manager Eddie Gray, and was a starting player at Elland Road in his one full season in England's second tier. As the following campaign unfolded he again found himself on the bench and decided to move on. After his spell in Yorkshire, he returned to Scotland and signed for Hearts in a £70,000 transfer; at the Tynecastle club he was part of the squad which came within minutes of winning the 1985–86 Scottish Premier Division. He took no part in that season's Scottish Cup Final defeat. He switched across Edinburgh to city rivals Hibernian for £30,000, where he featured regularly for one season at Easter Road before he was forced to retire through injury aged just 29. =Coach= He joined the coaching staff at Hibs under Alex Miller and was persuaded by Alex McLeish, his former teammate at Aberdeen, to be his assistant at Motherwell in 1994. He later re-joined McLeish in moving to Hibernian and Rangers, where he was assistant manager until the end of the 2005–06 season. From January 2007 he was one of McLeish's assistants with the Scotland national side, and in November 2007 followed McLeish when the latter was appointed manager of Birmingham City. On 21 May 2013 Watson was appointed first team coach at Notts County,Watson appointed first team coach at Notts County but he was sacked on 27 October 2013, along with manager Chris Kiwomya. Watson joined Northern Premier Division side Ilkeston FC during the 2015 close season as an assistant head coach and technical director, working with head coach Gavin Strachan. After Strachan left the club in October 2015, Watson was appointed head coach. In October 2016, he was appointed as assistant coach to Gordon Strachan (father of Gavin and another former Aberdeen teammate in the 1980s) at the Scottish national team alongside fellow coaches Mark McGhee and Gary McAllister, after the departure of Stuart McCall.

A former world Flyweight champion, Gamez became the first Flyweight boxer in history to win world titles in four different divisions. Gamez is considered by some boxing critics to be among Venezuela's best fighters since the Betulio González era. Debut/The 1980s He made his professional boxing debut on February 14, 1985 in Maracay, when he decisioned Francisco García over four rounds. On April 17 of that same year, he got his second victory, another four round points win, this time over Alcides Hernandez, also in Maracay. After those two wins, Gamez had six consecutive knockout wins, including two over Rafael Lara, and one in his first fight outside Maracay, held on August 14 at El Guayabo, where he beat Jose Escorcia in the fourth round. On November 28 of 1986, he would beat Escorcia's brother, Alberto, also by knockout in four rounds, at Maracaibo. On February 2, 1987, he suffered his first \\"blemish\\", when he was held to a two round technical draw by Rafael Bolivar, at Maracay. By then, Gámez was becoming a well known boxer among Hispanic boxing fans, Guantes magazine mentioning him sporadically on their articles. On April 30, Gámez received his first shot at a title, when he was faced with Pedro Nieves in the Venezuelan town of Turnero, for the national Jr. Flyweight title. Gamez won the championship with a second round knockout. He defended the title one time and won a handful of non-title bouts before reducing weight in order to get his first world championship opportunity. On January 10, 1988, Gámez fought for the WBA's vacant world Minimumweight championship against Bong-Jun Kim. In what also was his first fight abroad, Gamez became world champion for the first time when he outpointed Kim over 12 rounds in South Korea. After that victory, he became a celebrity both in Venezuela and internationally, as he went from being mentioned in articles, as aforementioned, to having articles written about him on magazines that specialized in boxing. He had several managerial problems after winning his first world championship, however, and he was able to defend that title only one time, knocking out Kenji Yokozawa in three rounds at Japan. When he suffered a broken arm not too long after, he decided to vacate the title, and took an extended lay-off from boxing. On October 29, 1989, Gámez was finally able to make a comeback, and he knocked out Victoriano Hernandez in five rounds that night. After one more win, he attempted, for the first time, to win the WBA's world Jr. Flyweight championship. On April 29, 1990, he was faced with long reigning world champion Myung-Woo Yuh, once again, in South Korea. Gámez lost a controversial twelve round decision; many fans and observers thought he deserved the win, and the WBA ordered an immediate rematch. On November 10 of that year, he would again fight Woo Yuh in South Korea, and, once again, Woo Yuh won by a twelve round decision to retain the world title. The 1990s Disillusioned, Gámez took off almost one more year off boxing. But he returned, inspired with the idea of winning the WBA's world Flyweight championship. Having been promised a title try by the WBA, he began training and, after his training was complete, he returned to South Korea, where he challenged WBA world Flyweight champion Yong-Kang Kim on November 5, 1991. Gamez once again lost by a twelve round decision, but he decided to stay active in boxing after that loss. Gámez won four fights in a row before once again dropping weight in order to challenge for a world title. His third try at the WBA's world Jr. Flyweight title, which was vacant after Woo Yuh's retirement, came on November 21, 1993, against Shiro Yashiro, in Tokyo. Gámez finally won the world Jr. Flyweight title, his second world championship, by knocking Yashiro out in nine rounds. He defended the title successfully three times, with fights in Panama and Thailand (twice), before losing it to Hi-Yong Choi on February 4 of 1995, once again in Korea. On May 20 of that year, he won the regional WBA Fedelatin Flyweight title by defeating Aquiles Guzman by a twelve round decision in Paraguay. Gámez's first opportunity at joining the elite group of fighters who have won world championships in three different divisions, and his second attempt at becoming world Flyweight champion, came on March 24, 1996, against world champion Saen Sor Ploenchit in Thailand. Gamez failed that time, however, dropping a twelve round split decision to the champion. Then, he lost the Fedelatin title in a rematch with Guzman, held on October 7 at Maracay. Guzman outpointed him over twelve rounds as well. Gámez became, once again, disillusioned with boxing. In 1998, however, he returned to the sport, knocking out Gilberto Gonzalez on November 3 in eight rounds in Venezuela, to regain the Fedelatin title. Gámez joined the exclusive group of champions to win titles in three or more divisions, at the same time becoming the first one among those to be world Flyweight champion, when he knocked out defending WBA world Flyweight champion Hugo Rafael Soto in the third round on March 13, 1999. The fight, held at New York's Madison Square Garden, also marked Gamez's debut as a professional fighter in the United States. After this win, Gamez received a hero's welcome at Caracas' Simón Bolívar International Airport. The 2000s On May 29, he won the WBA's \\"interim\\" world Super Flyweight championship by knocking out former WBO world Jr. Flyweight champion Josue Camacho in the fifth round at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He was not generally considered to be a four division world champion, however, because the WBA had conditioned their recognition of him as world Super Flyweight champion on either one of two things happening: the real champion, Hideki Todaka, would have to decide to leave his place as champion or Gamez would have to beat him in a fight in order for Gámez to be recognized as champion. After losing the Flyweight crown on September 3 to Sornpichai Kratingdaengym by knockout in eight rounds at a Thai hotel, Gámez received an opportunity to solidify his status as WBA world Super Flyweight champion, when the official champion, Todaka, gave him a shot on October 9, 2000. Gámez made history once again, joining the small group of boxers who have won world titles in four different divisions, and becoming both the first one among those to have held the world Flyweight title and the first Venezuelan in that group, when he knocked Todaka out in seven rounds at Nagoya. On his first defense, held on March 11, 2001 in Yokohama, Japan, he lost the crown by a twelfth round knockout to Celes Kobayashi. After one more win, Gámez attempted to join the very exclusive group of fighters to win world titles in five different divisions, when he lost to WBA world Bantamweight champion Johnny Bredahl by a twelve round decision, on November 8, 2002, in Copenhagen, Denmark. Gámez, as of 2014, is currently training young boxers in San Juan de los Morros in the Guarico state, and many other cities in Venezuela. Retirement After two more decision losses, including one in a rematch with Todaka, Gámez decided to retire for good from boxing, leaving with a record of 35 wins, 12 losses and one draw (tie), 26 of his wins coming by knockout. His last fight was held in Germany.

The Washington Post. July 30, 1939. p. A4. C. Y. Stephens, an owner of High's Dairy Stores, purchased property and remodeled to become better suited for theater in 1940. In 1946, Olney Theater was under the joint management of Glenn Taylor, Redge Allen, and Evelyn Freyman. It presented summer theater where shows featured well-known stars such as Jessica Tandy, Hume Cronyn, Tallulah Bankhead, and Helen Hayes. The theater was a five-show summer stock theater on the straw-hat circuit, along with 238 other theaters around the country. Players, Inc. (now known as National Players, Olney Theatre Center's touring company, was created by Father Gilbert V. Hartke in 1949. It brought live theater and educational programming to students and public audiences across the United States and overseas. In 1952, C.Y. Stephens invited Father Hartke to come to Olney for a meeting where he was asked to take over the theater. The two negotiated, and Father Hartke took over management of the property under his nonprofit touring company's umbrella. Stephens agreed not to charge Players, Inc. rent, and to reimburse them up to a $10,000 loss. Father Hartke then moved Players, Inc. to Olney to establish a summer theater. After losses in 1953 and 1954, which Stephens underwrote, the decision was made to produce only five plays in 1955. Despite much critical success, Olney still sustained a loss of $3,495.61 in 1955. Consequently, Father Hartke asked William H. Graham, Sr. to serve as Olney Theatre's general manager. His work, combined with the directorial talents of Robert Moore, Leo Brady, and Jim Waring drew large audiences, favorable reviews, and resulted in a profit of nearly $7,000 in 1956. In 1960, after the production of Rashomon, directed by Robert Moore, Stephens told Father Hartke that he had decided to give him the theater. Stephens gradually transferred all of the property's stock to Players, a branch of which is now known as Olney Theatre Corporation. Father became the corporation's president, a position he held for 33 years. Governor Blair Lee recognized Olney Theatre as the official State Summer Theater of Maryland in July 1978.Coe, Richard L.

The Washington Post. p. 121. The theater was producing five three-week productions per season, primarily from May to September. In 1991, Olney Theatre began a capital campaign to match a $625,000 state grant. The money was to be used for much needed improvements to the facilities and to realize Father Hartke's goal of operating year-round. Olney Theatre added two shows to its 1993 season, and it began production in April and ending around late October. A scene shop and a costume shop were added to the mainstage building. Prior sets were built outside, and costumes were built on the Crawford House porch. Jim Petosa was appointed artistic director of the newly renamed Olney Theatre Center in 1994. Petosa renewed emphasis on 20th-century American classics, musical theater, new works, and area premieres. From 1998 to 1999, Olney Theatre Center celebrated the 50th consecutive touring year of National Players. During these 50 years, National Players had reached 2,400,000 audience members, traveled , including ten tours outside the United States and five receptions at the White House, and gave over 6,000 performances. Olney Theatre Center began year-round performances with a seven-show mainstage season. The Mulitz-Gudelsky Theatre Lab was built in 1999 as the first step towards a new master campus plan. A year later, Olney Theatre Center began a capital campaign for a $10.5 million expansion. In 2003, The Kresge Foundation awarded Olney Theatre Center a Special Opportunities Initiative grant of $1 million. The next year, Olney Theatre Center acquired an additional for its cultural campus. In 2005, Olney Theatre Center opened its new amphitheater, the Root Family Stage at Will's Place, which gave a permanent home to its Summer Shakespeare Festival. Olney Theatre Center held the grand opening of its New Mainstage theater, a 429-seat facility with stadium seating and advanced technical capabilities. Olney Theatre Center expanded its mainstage season to eight plays and introduced its New Play Initiative with the world premiere of In the Mood in 2006. Olney Theatre Center also held its first Gala Celebration in over twenty years.

It was released on VHS and DVD in the United Kingdom on 18 November 2002. The video includes Eddie performing a French version of his show with English subtitles. The performance features many of Izzard's traditional themes, particularly religion (or \\"philosophies with some good ideas, and some very weird ones\\"). A discussion about Jesus' role in the three main Abrahamic faiths sees him \\"waiting offstage\\" in Judaism and playing on the same sporting team as Muhammad in Islam. This is counterpointed with a dialogue between a Crusader and his enemy in which both men are trying to kill the other \\"in the name of Jesus\\". He also mentions his impression that in Buddhism, Jesus is \\"Buddha's baby brother Benny\\". The rigidity of religion is also lampooned, particularly as it relates to the Renaissance. Galileo's persecution by the Catholic Church is mentioned, although the man is eventually asked (in prison) \\"Galileo, Galileo, will you do the fandango?\\" Several concepts featured in \\"Circle\\" have become well known among Izzard fans. Among these is a discussion of the Pope, specifically the names chosen by new popes, with the idea being that Popes John and John Paul will eventually be followed by Pope John Paul George and Ringo. A subsequent sequence talks about the renaming of a wartime pope as \\"Pope Gutless Bastard I\\" due to his refusal to condemn Adolf Hitler. Another famous rant involves another appearance of \\"God and Jesus\\" (where God is represented by a James Mason impression). Among other issues, this dialogue involves God questioning the wisdom of Jesus being born on Christmas Day and dying at Easter, as well as involving \\"cannibalism\\" and \\"vampirism\\" in the new religion. The sequence culminates in suggestions of what else could have been used at the Last Supper, most notably \\"take these oysters, for they are my kneecaps\\". Perhaps the most quoted part of the routine, however, is Izzard's \\"Death Star Canteen\\", derived from Izzard's observation that there had to be some sort of source of food (such as a cafeteria) on the Death Star in the Star Wars movies. This observation results in an extended dialogue in which Darth Vader is attempting to order \\"Penne all'arrabbiata\\" for lunch, only to be forced to get a tray (which is wet) and later be forced to admit that he is \\"Jeff Vader\\" in order to get respect.

They were also known as Society Men, Sanquharians, and Hillmen. The Societies of Cameronians for the Maintenance of the Presbyterian Form of Worship were formed about 1681. There is no evidence that organised bands came from any parish or district to either Drumclog or Bothwell Bridge in June 1679. The United Societies were not in existence at that period. After 1688 it was different. The Covenanters were by then organised in their Societies which were again united in larger groups called\\" Correspondences.” Their testimony, \\"The Informatory Vindication\\", was published in 1687. They quickly became the most pronounced and active adherents of the covenanting faith. The Cameronians were part of the Covenanting party but it has to be remembered that they formed only a section of the party. Alexander Peden, to take one example, never belonged to the Societies, and there is some reason to believe that John Brown of Priesthill was actually expelled from their membership. They wished to restore the ecclesiastical order which had existed between 1638 and 1649, and were dissatisfied with the moderate character of the religious settlement of 1690. After the religious settlement of 1690, those who could not accept its terms did not join the reconstituted church. Refusing to take oaths of allegiance to an uncovenanted ruler, or to exercise any civil function, they passed through a period of trial and found some difficulty in maintaining a regular ministry, but in 1706 they were reinforced by some converts from the established church. They objected strongly to the proposal for the union of England and Scotland, and were suspected of abetting a rising which took place in the west of Scotland in 1706; but there appears to be no foundation for the statement that they intrigued with the Jacobites, and they gave no trouble to the government either in 1715 or in 1745. They found themselves with no ministers when Alexander Shields and his colleagues joined the Church of Scotland as it was reconstituted following the Revolution, earlier ministers being killed in the field or on the scaffold. Eventually they were joined by John M'Millan and later Thomas Nairn who provided the quorum to constitute a Presbytery. They took the official title of the Reformed Presbytery in 1743 before which they liked to be called the Suffering Remnant of the true Presbyterian Church of Christ in Scotland. In 1712 they publicly renewed their covenants at Auchensaugh Hill in Lanarkshire, and in 1713 their first presbytery was founded at Braehead; a presbytery was formed in North America in 1774. Following an 1863 division, the majority of the body of the Reformed Presbyterians united with the Free Church of Scotland, leaving the tiny minority as the last representatives of the Cameronians; it retains the name of Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland. In the British army the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) was a regiment directly descended from the Cameronian guard, which was first raised in 1689 by James Douglas, Earl of Angus, fought at the battle of Dunkeld and was afterwards employed to restore order in the Highlands. One of the regimental traditions was to issue a bible to every new recruit; another was that the troops went under arms to church services, and the service only started after sentries had been posted on four sides of the church building.

When in Rome Velázquez ordered a bronze cast of the work for Madrid.According to Clark, the Rokeby Venus \\"ultimately derives from the Borghese Hermaphrodite\\". Clark, p. 373, note to page 3. The Rokeby Venus (; also known as The Toilet of Venus, Venus at her Mirror, Venus and Cupid, or La Venus del espejo) is a painting by Diego Velázquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age. Completed between 1647 and 1651,\\"The Rokeby Venus\\". National Gallery, London. Retrieved on 25 December 2007. and probably painted during the artist's visit to Italy, the work depicts the goddess Venus in a sensual pose, lying on a bed and looking into a mirror held by the Roman god of physical love, her son Cupid. The painting is in the National Gallery, London. Numerous works, from the ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of inspiration for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She is often described as looking at herself in the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect.This discrepancy has been termed the \\"Venus effect\\" by researchers of the University of Liverpool, who argue that \\"since the viewer sees her face in the mirror, Venus is actually looking at the reflection of the viewer.\\" Nonetheless, despite that her face is indeed turned as if looking at the viewer's reflection, weak but noticeable corneal reflections painted on her eyes indicate a direction of gaze not towards the viewers but rather away from them. It is as if Venus were gazing in the direction of what would have been her own reflection on the mirror were the discrepancy not to exist (her corneal reflections can be seen with the magnification tool on the right of the painting's image here). With her eyes to the right, the scene's illumination, which comes exclusively from the top left, could not produce such reflections on her corneas; it seems parsimonious that Velázquez —a master painter most unlikely to have erred on where to place reflections— created on purpose a scene that could not exist. Given this conflicting duality, it is noteworthy the main webpage of the National Gallery about the Rokeby Venus describes her as looking \\"both at herself and at the viewer\\" (even though she is described as \\"returning our gaze\\" in another Gallery webpage, Focus painting for February 2010 , retrieved on 27 September 2010). In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.Carr, p. 214. The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving female nude by Velázquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art,MacLaren, p. 126. and Carr, p. 214. which was policed actively by members of the Spanish Inquisition. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England to hang in Rokeby Park, Yorkshire. In 1906, the painting was purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery, London. Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson, it soon was fully restored and returned to display. PaintingDescription= Peter Paul Rubens' Venus at the Mirror, c. 1614–15, shows the goddess with her traditionally blond hair.Prater, p. 40. As with Velázquez's Venus, the goddess's reflected image does not match that portion of her face visible on the canvas. In contrast to Rubens' luscious and 'rounded' ideal form, Velázquez painted a more slender female figure.Prater, p. 51. The Rokeby Venus depicts the Roman goddess of love, beauty and fertility reclining languidly on her bed, her back to the viewer—in Antiquity, portrayal of Venus from a back view was a common visual and literary erotic motif—and her knees tucked. She is shown without the mythological paraphernalia normally included in depictions of the scene; jewellery, roses, and myrtle are all absent. Unlike most earlier portrayals of the goddess, which show her with blond hair, Velázquez's Venus is a brunette. The female figure can be identified as Venus because of the presence of her son, Cupid. Venus gazes into a mirror held by Cupid, who is without his usual bow and arrows. When the work was first inventoried, it was described as \\"a nude woman\\", probably owing to its controversial nature. Venus looks outward at the viewer of the paintingCarr, p. 214. It does not, however, seem clear to Wallace, quoted below. through her reflected image in the mirror. However, the image is blurred and reveals only a vague reflection of her facial characteristics; the reflected image of the head is much larger than it would be in reality.Gregory, R. L., Mirrors in mind (London: Penguin, 1997, ). He notes that \\"the image is with legitimate artistic licence at least twice the size it should be\\" (p. 21). The enlarged size presumably was the correction for the small image yielded by a mirror behind the subject. The critic Natasha Wallace has speculated that Venus's indistinct face may be the key to the underlying meaning of the painting, in that \\"it is not intended as a specific female nude, nor even as a portrayal of Venus, but as an image of self- absorbed beauty.\\"Wallace, Natasha. \\"Venus at her Mirror\\". JSS Virtual Gallery, 17 November 2000. Retrieved on 4 January 2008. According to Wallace, \\"There is nothing spiritual about face or picture. The classical setting is an excuse for a very material aesthetic sexuality—not sex, as such, but an appreciation of the beauty that accompanies attraction.\\" Intertwining pink silk ribbons are draped over the mirror and curl over its frame. The ribbon's function has been the subject of much debate by art historians; suggestions include an allusion to the fetters used by Cupid to bind lovers, that it was used to hang the mirror, and that it was used to blindfold Venus moments before. The critic Julián Gallego found Cupid's facial expression to be so melancholy that he interprets the ribbons as fetters binding the god to the image of Beauty, and gave the painting the title \\"Amor conquered by Beauty\\".Gallego, Julián. \\"Vision et symboles dans la peinture espagnole du siecle d'or\\". Paris: Klincksieck, 1968. p. 59f. The folds of the bed sheets echo the goddess's physical form, and are rendered to emphasise the sweeping curves of her body. The composition mainly uses shades of red, white, and grey, which are used even in Venus's skin; although the effect of this simple colour scheme has been much praised, recent technical analysis has shown that the grey sheet was originally a \\"deep mauve\\", that has now faded. The luminescent colours used in Venus's skin, applied with \\"smooth, creamy, blended handling\\",Keith, Larry; in Carr, p. 83. contrast with the dark greys and black of the silk she is lying on, and with the brown of the wall behind her face. Coronation of the Virgin, c. 1641–42. It has been suggested that the model used here was the same as the one used in the Venus.Noting the resemblance of the model in these paintings, López-Rey offered: \\"Obviously, Velázquez worked in both cases, and, for that matter, in the Fable of Arachne and Arachne, from the same model, the same sketch, or just the same idea of a beautiful young woman. Yet, he put on canvas two different images, one of divine and the other of earthly beauty\\". López-Rey, vol. I, p. 156. However, MacLaren (p. 127) does not endorse these suggestions; they would probably argue that the painting was not produced in Italy. The Prado \\"Coronation\\" is dated to 1641–42; the present image is \\"stretched\\" vertically compared with the original. The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving nude by Velázquez, but three others by the artist are recorded in 17th-century Spanish inventories. Two were mentioned in the Royal collection, but may have been lost in the 1734 fire that destroyed the main Royal Palace of Madrid. A further one was recorded in the collection of Domingo Guerra Coronel.MacLaren, p. 125. These records mention \\"a reclining Venus\\", Venus and Adonis, and a Psyche and Cupid.Portús, p. 56. Although the work is widely thought to have been painted from life, the identity of the model is subject to much speculation. In contemporary Spain it was acceptable for artists to employ male nude models for studies; however, the use of female nude models was frowned upon.Prater, pp. 56–57. The painting is believed to have been executed during one of Velázquez's visits to Rome, and Prater has observed that in Rome the artist \\"did indeed lead a life of considerable personal liberty that would have been consistent with the notion of using a live nude female model\\". It has been claimed that the painting depicts a mistress Velázquez is known to have had while in Italy, who is supposed to have borne his child. Others have claimed that the model is the same as in Coronation of the Virgin and Las Hilanderas, both in the Museo del Prado, and other works. The figures of both Venus and Cupid were significantly altered during the painting process, the result of the artist's corrections to the contours as initially painted.López-Rey believed that an overzealous cleaning in 1965 unevenly exposed some of Velázquez's \\"tentative contours\\", resulting in a loss of subtlety and contravening the artist's intent. López-Rey, vol II, p. 260. However, the National Gallery catalogue retaliates by describing López-Rey's description of the painting's condition as \\"largely misleading\\". MacLaren, p. 127. Pentimenti can be seen in Venus's upraised arm, in the position of her left shoulder, and on her head. Infra-red reveals that she was originally shown more upright with her head turned to the left. An area on the left of the painting, extending from Venus's left foot to the left leg and foot of Cupid, is apparently unfinished, but this feature is seen in many other works by Velázquez and was probably deliberate.Carr, p. 217, see also MacLaren, p. 125 for the opposite view. The painting was given a major cleaning and restoration in 1965–66, which showed it to be in good condition, and with very little paint added later by other artists, contrary to what some earlier writers had asserted.MacLaren, p. 125. In particular, it had been claimed that the face in the mirror had been overpainted. See note above for López-Rey's criticism of the cleaning. =Sources= Giorgione, Sleeping Venus, c. 1510. Giorgione shows Venus sleeping on fine textiles in an outdoor setting against a sumptuous landscape.Prater, p. 20. As with Velázquez's Venus, Giorgione painted, against tradition, the goddess as a brunette. Paintings of nudes and of Venus by Italian, and especially Venetian, artists were influences on Velázquez. However, Velázquez's version is, according to the art historian Andreas Prater, \\"a highly independent visual concept that has many precursors, but no direct model; scholars have sought them in vain\\". Forerunners include Titian's various depictions of Venus, such as Venus and Cupid with a Partridge, Venus and Cupid with an Organist and notably the Venus of Urbino; Palma il Vecchio's Reclining Nude; and Giorgione's Sleeping Venus,The landscape probably done or finished by Titian, after Giorgione's death all of which show the deity reclining on luxurious textiles, although in landscape settings in the latter two works. The use of a centrally placed mirror was inspired by the painters of the Italian High Renaissance, including Titian, Girolamo Savoldo and Lorenzo Lotto, who used mirrors as an active protagonist, as opposed to more than merely a prop or accessory in the pictorial space. Both Titian and Peter Paul Rubens had already painted Venus looking into a mirror, and as both had had close ties to the Spanish court, their examples would have been familiar to Velázquez. However, \\"this girl with her small waist and jutting hip, does not resemble the fuller more rounded Italian nudes inspired by ancient sculpture\\".Langmuir, p. 253 Reclining Nude in a Landscape. This 16th-century painting of the Venetian school was paired with the Rokeby Venus when in Haro's collection and perhaps before. One innovation of the Rokeby Venus, when compared to other large single nude paintings, lies in the fact that Velázquez depicts a back view of its subject who is turned away from the viewer. There were precedents for this in prints by Giulio Campagnola,Campagnola, Giulio: Liegende Frau in einer Landschaft. Zeno.org. Retrieved on 14 March 2008. Agostino Veneziano, Hans Sebald Beham and Theodor de Bry,Portús, p. 67, note: 42; citing Sánchez Cantón. as well as classical sculptures known to Velázquez, of which casts were made for Madrid. These were the Sleeping Ariadne now in the Pitti Palace, but then in Rome, of which Velázquez ordered a cast for the Royal collection in 1650–51, and the Borghese Hermaphroditus, a sleeping hermaphrodite (picture to the right above), now in the Louvre, of which a cast was sent to Madrid,MacLaren, p. 126 and which also emphasises the curve from hip to waist. However, the combination of elements in Velázquez's composition was original. The Rokeby Venus may have been intended as a pendant to a sixteenth-century Venetian painting of a recumbent Venus (which seems to have begun life as a Danaë) in a landscape, in the same pose, but seen from the front. The two were certainly hung together for many years in Spain when in the collection of Gaspar Méndez de Haro, 7th Marquis of Carpio (1629–87); at what point they were initially paired is uncertain.Portús, p. 66, illus. fig. 48. According to Portús, what is almost certainly the other painting was lost trace of after a sale in 1925, but \\"recently rediscovered in a private collection in Europe\\" according to Langmuir, p. 253, who says the two are recorded in the same room in one of Haro's palaces by 1677. The rediscovery was made, and the painting identified, by Alex Wengraf in 1994 according to Harris and Bull in Harris Estudios completos sobre Velázquez: Complete Studies On Velázquez pp. 287–89. An attribution to Tintoretto has been suggested. Nudes in 17th-century Spain Titian's Venus with a Mirror, c. 1555, is an early example of Venus depicted at her toilet with Cupid. In this painting, Venus sits upright. The portrayal of nudes was officially discouraged in 17th-century Spain. Works could be seized or repainting demanded by the Inquisition, and artists who painted licentious or immoral works were often excommunicated, fined, or banished from Spain for a year.Hagen II, p. 405. However, within intellectual and aristocratic circles, the aims of art were believed to supersede questions of morality, and there were many, generally mythological, nudes in private collections. Velázquez's patron, the art-loving King Philip IV, held a number of nudes by Titian and Rubens, and Velázquez, as the king's painter, need not have feared painting such a picture. Leading collectors, including the King, tended to keep nudes, many mythological, in relatively private rooms;See Cabinet (room); such paintings were known as \\"cabinet pictures\\". in Phillip's case \\"the room where His Majesty retires after eating\\", which contained the Titian poesies he had inherited from Phillip II, and the Rubens he had commissioned himself.Portús, pp. 62–63. The Venus would be in such a room while in the collections of both Haro and Godoy. The court of Philip IV greatly \\"appreciated painting in general, and the nude in particular, but ... at the same time, exerted unparalleled pressure on artists to avoid the depiction of the naked human body.\\" The contemporary Spanish attitude toward paintings of nudes was unique in Europe. Although such works were appreciated by some connoisseurs and intellectuals within Spain, they were generally treated with suspicion. Low necklines were commonly worn by women during the period, but according to the art historian Zahira Veliz, \\"the codes of pictorial decorum would not easily permit a known lady to be painted in this way\\".Veliz, Zahira. \\"Signs of Identity in Lady with a Fan by Diego Velazquez: Costume and Likeness Reconsidered\\". Art Bulletin, Volume: 86. Issue: 1. 2004 For Spaniards of the 17th century, the issue of the nude in art was tied up with concepts of morality, power, and aesthetics. This attitude is reflected in the literature of the Spanish Golden Age, in works such as Lope de Vega's play La quinta de Florencia, which features an aristocrat who commits rape after viewing a scantily clad figure in a mythological painting by Michelangelo. El Greco's 1609 portrait of Fray Hortensio Félix Paravicino, who argued for the destruction of all nude paintingsJavier Portús, p. 63, in: Carr, Dawson W. Velázquez. Ed. Dawson W. Carr; also Xavier Bray, Javier Portús and others. National Gallery London, 2006. In 1632,Portús p. 63 claims the year 1673, but this appears to be an error. The chapter \\"Nudes\\" in Spanish Painting From El Greco to Picasso (PDF), Sociedad Estatal para la Acción Cultural Exterior (SEACEX), Retrieved on 16 March 2008, which refers to his research and also covers this topic, says 1632, and mentions references to the work by various other writers before 1673, including Francisco Pacheco, died 1644, in his Arte de Pintura. an anonymous pamphlet—attributed to the Portuguese Francisco de Braganza—was published with the title \\"A copy of the opinions and censorship by the most revered fathers, masters and senior professors of the distinguished universities of Salamanca and Alcalá, and other scholars on the abuse of lascivious and indecent figures and paintings, which are mortal sin to be painted, carved and displayed where they can be seen\\".Serraller, pp. 237–60. The court was able to exert counter-pressure, and a piece by the famous poet and preacher Fray Hortensio Félix Paravicino, which proposed the destruction of all paintings of the nude, and was written to be included in the pamphlet, was never published. Paravicino was a connoisseur of painting, and therefore believed in its power: \\"the finest paintings are the greatest threat: burn the best of them\\". As his title shows, Braganza merely argued that such works should be kept from the view of a wider public, as was in fact mostly the practice in Spain.Portús, pp. 63. Correggio's Danaё, 1531, is an early example of Cupid depicted attending to a female recumbent on a chamber bed. In this painting however, the female is a mortal, although Correggio still favoured the portrayal of a figure from mythologyPrater, p. 41. In contrast, French art of the period often depicted women with low necklines and slender corsets;The engravings of such artists as Wenceslaus Hollar and Jacques Callot show, according to Veliz, \\"an almost documentary interest in the form and detail of European costume in the second quarter of the seventeenth century\\". however, the mutilation by the French royal family of the Correggio depiction of Leda and the Swan and their apparent destruction of the famous Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo paintings of the same subject, show that nudity could be controversial in France also.Bull, Malcolm. \\"The Mirror of the Gods, How Renaissance Artists Rediscovered the Pagan Gods\\". Oxford UP, 2005. p. 169. In northern Europe it was seen as acceptable to portray artfully draped nudes. Examples include Rubens's Minerva Victrix, of 1622–25, which shows Marie de' Medici with an uncovered breast, and Anthony van Dyck's 1620 painting, The Duke and Duchess of Buckingham as Venus and Adonis. In 17th-century Spanish art, even in the depiction of sibyls, nymphs, and goddesses, the female form was always chastely covered. No painting from the 1630s or 1640s, whether in the genre, portrait, or history format, shows a Spanish female with her breasts exposed; even uncovered arms were only rarely shown. In 1997, the art historian Peter Cherry suggested that Velázquez sought to overcome the contemporary requirement for modesty by portraying Venus from the back.Cherry, Peter. \\"Seventeenth-Century Spanish Taste2. Collections of Paintings in Madrid 1601–1755, vol. 2. CA: Paul Getty Information Inst. 1997. p. 73f. Even in the mid-18th century, an English artist who made a drawing of the Venus when it was in the collection of the Dukes of Alba noted it was \\"not hung up, owing to the subject\\".MacLaren, pp. 128–9. Another attitude to the issue was shown by Morritt, who wrote to Sir Walter Scott of his \\"fine painting of Venus' backside\\", which he hung above his main fireplace, so that \\"the ladies may avert their downcast eyes without difficulty and connoisseurs steal a glance without drawing the said posterior into the company\\".Bray; in Carr, p. 99. Provenance The Rokeby Venus was long held to be one of Velázquez's final works.López-Rey noted that based on stylistic qualities, Beruete (Aureliano de Beruete, Velázquez, Paris, 1898) assigned the painting to the late 1650s. López-Rey, vol. I, p. 155. In 1951, it was found recorded in an inventory of 1 June 1651 from the collection of Gaspar Méndez de Haro, 7th Marquis of Carpio,From 1648; before that Marquis of Heliche, by which title he is sometimes referred to. Portús, p. 57. a close associate of Philip IV of Spain. Haro was the great-nephew of Velázquez's first patron, the Count- Duke of Olivares, and a notorious libertine. According to the art historian Dawson Carr, Haro \\"loved paintings almost as much as he loved women\\",Carr, p. 217 and \\"even his panegyrists lamented his excessive taste for lower-class women during his youth\\". For these reasons it seemed likely that he would have commissioned the painting.Fernandez, Angel Aterido. \\"The First Owner of the Rokeby Venus\\". The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 143, No. 1175, February, 2001. pp. 91–94. However, in 2001 the art historian Ángel Aterido discovered that the painting had first belonged to the Madrid art dealer and painter Domingo Guerra Coronel, and was sold to Haro in 1652 following Coronel's death the previous year.Aterido, pp. 91–92. Coronel's ownership of the painting raises a number of questions: how and when it came into Coronel's possession, and why Velázquez's name was omitted from Coronel's inventory. The art critic Javier Portús has suggested that the omission may have been due to the painting's portrayal of a female nude, \\"a type of work which was carefully supervised and whose dissemination was considered problematic\\".Portús, p. 57. Francisco de Goya, La maja desnuda, c. 1797–1800. In 1815, Goya was charged by the Spanish Inquisition over the work, but retained his title as court painter. These revelations make the painting difficult to date. Velázquez's painting technique offers no assistance, although its strong emphasis on colour and tone suggest that the work dates from his mature period. The best estimates of its origin put its completion in the late 1640s or early 1650s, either in Spain or during Velázquez's last visit to Italy. If this is the case, then the breadth of handling and the dissolution of form can be seen to mark the beginning of the artist's final period. The conscientious modelling and strong tonal contrasts of his earlier work are here replaced by a restraint and subtlety which would culminate in his late masterpiece, Las Meninas.Gudiol, p. 261. Portrait of John Bacon Sawrey Morritt The painting passed from Haro into the collection of his daughter Catalina de Haro y Guzmán, the eighth Marchioness of Carpio, and her husband, Francisco Álvarez de Toledo, the tenth Duke of Alba.López-Rey, vol. II, p. 262. In 1802, Charles IV of Spain ordered the family to sell the painting (with other works) to Manuel de Godoy, his favourite and chief minister.MacLaren, p. 126. He hung it alongside two masterpieces by Francisco Goya that he may have commissioned himself, The Nude Maja and The Clothed Maja. These bear obvious compositional similarities with Velázquez's Venus, although unlike Velázquez, Goya clearly painted his nude in a calculated attempt to provoke shame and disgust in the relatively unenlightened climate of 18th-century Spain.Schwarz, Michael. \\"The Age of the Rococo\\". London: Pall Mall Press, 1971. p. 94. Venus was brought to England in 1813, where it was purchased by John MorrittBrought to England by William Buchanan, a Scottish art dealer who kept an agent in Spain, George Augustus Wallis. Bray, in Carr, p. 99; MacLaren, p. 127. for £500 (£ in ), and on the advice of his friend Sir Thomas Lawrence. Morritt hung it in his house at Rokeby Park, Yorkshire—thus the painting's popular name. In 1906, the painting was acquired for the National Gallery by the newly created National Art Collections Fund, its first campaigning triumph.The painting was not universally accepted as Velázquez's work on its reintroduction to the public. The artist William Blake Richmond, in a lecture at the Royal Academy in 1910 claimed that \\"two pigments used in the picture did not exist in the time of Velasquez.\\" The critic, James Grieg hypothesised that it was by Anton Raphael Mengs—although he found little support for his idea—and there was more serious discussion about the possibility of Velázquez's son-in-law and pupil, Juan del Mazo as the artist. MacLaren p. 76 dismisses both claims: \\"The supposed signatures of Juan Bautista Mazo and Anton Raphael Mengs in the bottom left corner are purely accidental marks.\\" King Edward VII greatly admired the painting, and anonymously provided £8,000 (£ in ) towards its purchase,Bray; in Carr, p. 107 and became Patron of the Fund thereafter.Smith, Charles Saumarez. \\"The Battle for Venus: In 1906, the King Intervened to Save a Velazquez Masterpiece for the Nation. If Only Buckingham Palace, or Indeed Downing Street, Would Now Do the Same for Raphael's Madonna of the Pinks\\". New Statesman, Volume 132, Issue 4663, 10 November 2003. p. 38. Legacy Édouard Manet's Olympia, 1863. Manet was enormously influenced by the paintings of Velázquez, and in Olympia a kind of paraphrasing of the eroticism and the boldness of the subject clearly shows the legacy of the Rokeby Venus. In part because he was overlooked until the mid-19th century, Velázquez found no followers and was not widely imitated. In particular, his visual and structural innovations in this portrayal of Venus were not developed by other artists until recently, largely owing to the censorship of the work.Prater, p. 114. The painting remained in a series of private rooms in private collections until it was exhibited in 1857 at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition, along with 25 other paintings at least claimed to be by Velázquez; it was here that it became known as the Rokeby Venus. It does not appear to have been copied by other artists, engraved or otherwise reproduced, until this period. In 1890 it was exhibited in the Royal Academy in London, and in 1905 at Messrs. Agnews, the dealers who had bought it from Morritt. From 1906 it was highly visible in the National Gallery and became well-known globally through reproductions. The general influence of the painting was therefore long delayed, although individual artists would have been able to see it on occasion throughout its history.Carr, p. 103, and MacLaren, p. 127, the latter of whom would mention copies and early prints if there were any. Paul-Jacques- Aimé Baudry's The Wave and the Pearl, 1862. Velázquez's portrait is a staging of a private moment of intimacy and a dramatic departure from the classical depictions of sleep and intimacy found in works from antiquity and Venetian art that portray Venus. However, the simplicity with which Velázquez displays the female nude—without jewellery or any of the goddess's usual accessories—was echoed in later nude studies by Ingres, Manet, and Baudry, among others. In addition, Velázquez's depiction of Venus as a reclining nude viewed from the rear was a rarity before that time, although the pose has been painted by many later artists.\\"The more frequent appearance of the motif in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries is probably owing to the prestige of the antique figure of Hermaphrodite....In Renaissance art the earliest example of a nude woman lying with her back to the spectator is the Giulio Campagnola engraving, which probably represents a design by Giorgione\\"....Clark, 391, note to page 150. Manet, in his stark female portrayal Olympia, paraphrased the Rokeby Venus in pose and by suggesting the persona of a real woman rather than an ethereal goddess. Olympia shocked the Parisian art world when it was first exhibited in 1863.\\"And when Manet painted his Olympia in 1863, and changed the course of modern art by provoking the mother of all art scandals with her, to whom was he paying homage? Manet’s Olympia is the Rokeby Venus brought up to date — a whore descended from a goddess.\\" Waldemar Januszczak, Times Online (8 October 2006). Still sexy after all these years. Retrieved on 14 March 2008. Olympia gazes directly out at the viewer, as does Velázquez's Venus, only through the reflection of the mirror. =In film= The 1961 film The Happy Thieves features a plan to steal the picture from a Spanish mansion. In the 2006 British comedy-drama film Venus, the protagonist Maurice Russell portrayed by Peter O'Toole takes Jessie to the National Gallery in London to view the painting. Vandalism, 1914 Damage sustained in the attack by Mary Richardson in 1914. The canvas was later restored and the incisions repaired. The breaks visible in this photograph, above her shoulder and horizontally across the upper left of the image, were to the glass only.Potterton, Homan. The National Gallery. London: Thames and Hudson, 1977. 15 On 10 March 1914, the suffragette Mary Richardson walked into the National Gallery and attacked Velázquez's canvas with a meat cleaver. Her action was ostensibly provoked by the arrest of fellow suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst the previous day,Davies, Christie. \\"Velazquez in London\\". New Criterion. Volume: 25. Issue: 5, January 2007. p. 53. although there had been earlier warnings of a planned suffragette attack on the collection. Richardson left seven slashes on the painting, particularly causing damage to the area between the figure's shoulders.Prater, p. 7. However, all were successfully repaired by the National Gallery's chief restorer Helmut Ruhemann.Davies, Christie. \\"Velazquez in London\\". New Criterion, Volume: 25, Issue: 5, January 2007.

Journalists tended to assess the attack in terms of a murder (Richardson was nicknamed \\"Slasher Mary\\"), and used words that conjured wounds inflicted on an actual female body, rather than on a pictorial representation of a female body.

Metalwork Collection Part of the Metalwork Collection Sheffield's metalwork collection comprises more than 13,000 objects and has been awarded Designated Collection status by DCMS, signifying a 'pre- eminent collection of national and international importance held in England's non-national museums'. The collection includes what is probably the most extensive grouping of Sheffield-made cutlery, flatware (forks and spoons) and holloware (e.g. bowls, teapots, containers) in existence and was amassed as a reference collection; showcasing examples of excellent design and high quality craftsmanship from around the world to inspire the city’s manufacturers, designers and makers. Craft & Design  The Craft & Design gallery is a temporary exhibition space intended to build on the tradition of the Ruskin and Metalwork collections in providing creative inspiration through examples of excellence. Following the theme of historic and contemporary craft and design, recent exhibitions have included Kill Your Darlings by Kid Acne and Graphic Nature in 2011, Under the Sea in 2012, and Designed to Shine in 2013, marking the 100th anniversary of the discovery of stainless steel in Sheffield. Special Exhibitions The special exhibition space is the largest in Sheffield and was designed to accommodate major touring exhibitions from national partners such as the V&A; and Tate. Major exhibitions in recent years include Vivienne Westwood: the Exhibition in 2008, Watercolour in Britain and Restless Times in 2010, John Martin: Painting the Apocalypse in 2011, The Family in British Art and Paul Morrison: Auctorum in 2012 and Force of Nature: Picturing Ruskin's Landscape in 2013.

The book formed part of a larger campaign against sociobiology. Its authors were praised for their criticism of IQ testing and were complimented by some for their critique of sociobiology. However, they have been criticized for misrepresenting the views of scientists such as the biologist E. O. Wilson and the ethologist Richard Dawkins, for using “determinism” and “reductionism” simply as terms of abuse, and for the influence of Marxism on their views. Critics have seen its authors’ conclusions as political rather than scientific. Summary Lewontin, Rose and Kamin identify themselves as \\"respectively an evolutionary geneticist, a neurobiologist, and a psychologist.\\" They criticize biological determinism and reductionism, and state that they share a commitment to the creation of a socialist society and a recognition that \\"a critical science is an integral part of the struggle to create that society\\". Their understanding of science draws on ideas suggested by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels and developed by Marxist scholars in the 1930s. They also draw on the ideas of the Marxist philosopher György Lukács, as put forward in History and Class Consciousness (1923), as well as the ideas of the Marxist philosopher Ágnes Heller and the communist revolutionary Mao Zedong. They discuss and criticize the views of authors such as E. O. Wilson, Richard Dawkins, and Donald Symons. They criticize Wilson's Sociobiology: The New Synthesis (1975). They maintain that, like some other sociobiologists, Symons maintains that \\"the manifest trait is not itself coded by genes, but that a potential is coded and the trait only arises when the appropriate environmental cue is given.\\" In their view, \\"Despite its superficial appearance of dependence on environment, this model is completely genetically determined, independent of the environment.\\" They write that Symons' arguments in The Evolution of Human Sexuality (1979) provide examples \\"of how sociobiological theory can explain anything, no matter how contradictory, by a little mental gymnastics\\". Publication history Not in Our Genes was first published by Pantheon Books in 1984. Later that year it was published by Pelican Books. In 1990, it was published by Penguin Books. ReceptionMainstream media= Not in Our Genes received positive reviews from the columnist Gene Lyons in Newsweek and the paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould in The New York Review of Books, a mixed review from the philosopher Philip Kitcher in The New York Times Book Review, and negative reviews from the anthropologist Melvin Konner in Natural History and the biologist Patrick Bateson and the ethologist Richard Dawkins in New Scientist. The editors of New Scientist noted that the book would \\"inevitably attract either extreme criticism or glowing praise\\" depending on the reviewer's stance on sociobiology, and that they published two reviews to help encourage debate, having approached Dawkins \\"for the opposition\\" and Bateson, \\"who feels that the attack on genetic determinism is justified.\\" The book was also reviewed by the psychologist Sandra Scarr in American Scientist, Nathaniel S. Lehrman in The Humanist, and by The Wilson Quarterly and Science News. Lyons described the book as a \\"spirited, if often repetitive, demolition of sociobiology's pretensions\\", adding that its authors' arguments were \\"made doubly impressive\\" by their \\"analysis of how the economic determinism of what they call '“vulgar” Marxism' and the spinelessness of 'sociological relativism' have contributed to a climate in which the speculations of sociobiology have found a hearing.\\" Gould described the book as \\"important and timely\\". He credited Lewontin et al. with exposing the fallacies of biological determinism (though he noted that theirs was only one critique among many), and presenting a view of human behavior that went beyond the controversy over nature and nurture. However, he believed that while they exposed problems with research on schizophrenia, they did not reveal \\"fatal and debilitating flaws\\". He agreed with Lewontin et al. that \\"interactionism is also based on deep fallacies and cultural biases that play into the hands of biological determinism\\", showing that it is guilty of the fallacy of \\"reductionism\\". Kitcher described the book as \\"informative, entertaining, lucid, forceful, frequently witty, occasionally unfair, sometimes intemperate, never dull\\". He praised Lewontin et al.′s discussion of intelligence, and complimented their discussions of sex differences and the use of drugs and surgery to modify behavior. He was less convinced by their discussion of schizophrenia, writing that in it their \\"policy of treating their opponents as patsies begins to seem unjustified\\". Konner believed that the book's authors provided an \\"acceptable review of the dismal historical record of abuse of ideas in behavioral genetics\\" but that this history had received better discussions. He criticized Lewontin et al. for giving little attention to \\"similar abuses that have occurred under political systems that espouse a cultural-determinist ideology.\\" He accused them of falsely attributing a belief in \\"heredity privilege\\" to advocates of IQ testing, employing tactics such as guilt through association, providing misleading discussions of issues in psychiatry and neurology, such as attention deficit disorder, psychosurgery, and antipsychotic drugs, and criticizing sociobiology on the basis of the weakest studies in the field and popular writings by journalists. He considered Wilson's discussion of the development of behavior in Sociobiology more sophisticated than that of Lewontin et al. He called the book \\"unfortunate\\", writing that its authors \\"offer little, except for pious hand-wringing and 'dialectical' rhetoric, that might help us to grapple with the great unanswered questions of our behavior and experience, normal and abnormal.\\" Bateson accused the book's authors of making it easy for themselves to criticize the genetic analysis of behavior by focusing on its weakest advocates, though he granted that their \\"counter-rhetoric\\" was \\"brilliant\\" and sometimes \\"illuminating.\\" He also praised their discussion of measuring intelligence, writing that it was clear and \\"merciless\\" in its \\"exposure of poor method.\\" He credited them with making a strong case against genetic explanations of both differences in IQ and schizophrenia, but did not consider their conclusions about either issue definitive, noting that both remained subject to dispute. He also found their criticism of ethology and sociobiology distorted by their personal biases, writing that despite errors by some proponents of sociobiology, Lewontin et al. were incorrect to dismiss it altogether. He noted that they ignored developments in the field that corrected some of the initial mistakes made by Wilson in Sociobiology. He also wrote that their claim that the belief that animals have a tendency not to mate with individuals familiar from early life is based on little evidence is incorrect. According to Bateson, even though he was predisposed to be sympathetic to Lewontin et al.′s approach, the value of their work was undermined by their poor scholarship and bad arguments, and the errors they made in discussing his field forced him to wonder about the value of their work even when it seemed strong, such as the portions concerning IQ and schizophrenia. Though agreeing with their views about the interaction between the social and physical environment, he accused them of wrongly suggesting that they were novel, when they were held by many others and it was doubtful whether anyone actually believed in the form of interactionism they criticized. He predicted that most scientists would simply disregard their book, and questioned whether discrediting genetic determinism would help create a more just society. Dawkins accused the book's authors of promoting a \\"bizarre conspiracy theory of science\\" that suggested that sociobiology was a response to 1960s student activism, and of wrongly using quotations from non- sociobiologists such as the Conservative politician Patrick Jenkin and representatives of the British National Front and the French Nouvelle Droite as though they represented sociobiology. He described their claim that sociobiologists believe in genetic determinism as a \\"simple lie\\", and wrote that they employed the term \\"biological determinism\\" without having a clear idea of what they meant by it, and used the words \\"determinist\\" and \\"reductionist\\" simply as terms of abuse. He argued that biologists practice an appropriate form of \\"reductionism\\" that involves explaining complex wholes in terms of their parts, and never practice the form of \\"reductionism\\" criticized by Lewontin et al., which involves the idea that \\"the properties of a complex whole are simply the sum of those same properties in the parts\\". He maintained that the anthropologists Marshall Sahlins and Sherwood Washburn, praised by Lewontin et al. for their criticism of sociobiology, were both guilty of elementary misunderstandings of kin selection theory and that Lewontin knew enough about genetics that he should have realized this, and that the \\"dialectical biology\\" advocated by Lewontin et al. actually involved ideas similar to those suggested by Bateson and Dawkins himself. He attributed the positive reviews of the book from liberals to its authors' opposition to racism. Though he believed that its chapters on \\"IQ testing and similar topics\\" had some value, he nevertheless concluded that Lewontin et al.′s book was both poorly written and \\"silly, pretentious, obscurantist and mendacious\\". =Scientific and academic journals= Not in Our Genes received positive reviews from the biologist Peter Medawar in Nature, the geneticist Alan Emery in Trends in Neurosciences, and T. Benton in The Sociological Review, the biologist Franz M. Wuketits in the Journal of Social and Biological Structures, and a mixed review from the anthropologist Vernon Reynolds in Ethnic and Racial Studies. The book was also reviewed by Howard L. Kaye in Society. Medawar described the book as a well-written and \\"in the main convincing rebuttal of a variety of determinist ideologies that have come to acquire the status of a public nuisance in biology and sociology.\\" He endorsed its authors' criticism of IQ testing and their argument that determinism is an expression of conservative ideology. However, he was less satisfied by their criticism of reductionism, writing that despite its shortcomings reductive analysis was \\"the most successful research stratagem ever devised in science.\\" He argued that it was also the way of understanding the world that made it easiest to see how it could be changed, something left-wing writers such as the authors of Not in Our Genes should appreciate. Emery welcomed the book as a refreshing attempt to create a more balanced view of the relevance of genetics to human behavior. Benton described the book as an \\"immense achievement\\" and a well-written work accessible to a large audience. He complimented its authors for their historical survey of biological determinism and reductionism and their philosophical discussion of their dialectical alternative, and praised their discussions of IQ testing, biological determinist defences of patriarchy, psychiatry, schizophrenia, and sociobiology. He believed that they exposed the logical and conceptual problems of defining and measuring intelligence and identifying schizophrenia as a unitary disorder, as well as problems in the methodologies of heritability studies in both cases, including their assumption that \\"the determinants of any characteristic can be analysed as of two, separable kinds, heredity and environment, and that it makes sense to ask what proportion of each went into the making of the particular characteristic.\\" He wrote that they dealt \\"selectively (and probably appropriately) with the work of Wilson and Dawkins\\". However, he believed that they did not have a fully developed alternative to biological and cultural determinism, questioned whether they were able to present a view different from cultural determinism, and noted that while they treated sociobiology as a form of genetic determinism, the main sociobiological writers had become \\"more sophisticated and qualified in their assumptions.\\" He criticized them for using quotations in a selective fashion to argue that sociobiology is still an unqualified form of genetic determinism, and for equating \\"biological determinism and political reaction\\", noting that religious fundamentalists wanted to outlaw the teaching of evolutionary theory, and some progressive thinkers accept that biological processes shape personality. Wuketits described the book as \\"concise and well written\\", and \\"more provocative than anything else written in opposition to genetic determinism and its ideological interpretation\\" because of its identification of sociobiology with the New Right. Although he agreed with many of Lewontin et al.′s views, he nevertheless considered them mistaken to view sociobiology as only an \\"ideological program\\", writing that it was primarily a scientific discipline and should not be dismissed simply for ideological reasons. He expressed regret that the book would give readers not familiar with the scientific background to sociobiology the impression that it is \\"nothing but a dangerous pseudoscientific ideology.\\" Reynolds argued that because Lewontin et al. dismissed biological approaches to understanding human nature, they invalidated their own claims about human nature, reducing them from scientific to political statements. He maintained, in opposition to Lewontin et al., that a single \\"committed political position\\" cannot be used to evaluate or criticize science, and that determining to what extent scientific claims are actually political in nature requires consideration of all political positions. He wrote that Lewontin et al. provided a dubious description of science that made it sound like a \\"right wing political movement\\", noting that their own credentials as scientists suggested that their politicized view of science was incorrect. However, he considered them correct to claim that the arguments of sociobiology were only \\"speculative suggestions\\" and that it was unfortunate if \\"the fascist right\\" adopted them as \\"scientific validation of its ideology\\", and that some scientific work, such as \\"IQ testing\\", is politicized science, and credited them with showing that \\"a good many branches of the science of human nature all revolve around the problem of inequality\\" and \\"mostly validate it.\\" He also found their book enjoyable reading. =Other evaluations= The psychologist David P. Barash described Not in Our Genes as an example of the controversy surrounding sociobiology. He criticized Lewontin et al. for unfairly connecting sociobiology with \\"racist eugenics and misguided Social Darwinism.\\" Dawkins accused Lewontin et al. of misquoting him, writing that they misrepresented his comment of genes, \\"they created us, body and mind\\", by altering the word \\"created\\" to \\"control\\". He maintained that genes do not control people in the way that \\"genetic determinism\\" suggests and accused Lewontin et al. of failing to understand that \\"it is perfectly possible to hold that genes exert a statistical influence on human behavior while at the same time believing that this influence can be modified, overridden or reversed by other influences.\\" The biologist Dean Hamer described Not in Our Genes as \\"a political rather than a scientific book\\". He expressed his disagreement with its politics. Nevertheless, Hamer commented that it taught him that the genetics of behavior is an emotionally and politically charged topic, especially where it concerns sexuality, and helped motivate him to change fields from metallothionein research to the genetics of homosexuality. The philosopher Daniel Dennett criticized Lewontin et al.′s account of reductionism, calling it \\"idiosyncratic\\". He also criticized their claim that memes involve a Cartesian view of the mind, arguing that memes are \\"a key (central but optional) ingredient in the best alternatives to Cartesian models\\", and accused them of being willing to use unscrupulous tactics to criticize people they considered determinists. The author Richard Webster considered Not in Our Genes, \\"more subtle and valuable than the Marxism which frequently informs it\\". Rose commented that he and his co-authors in the book presented a critique of reductionism that was \\"systematic and based upon a coherent philosophical and political analysis which sees modern science as the inheritor of nineteenth- century mechanical materialism, itself tightly linked ideologically to a particular phase of the development of industrial capitalism.\\" Writing with the sociologist Hilary Rose, he noted that Not in Our Genes was one of a number of books that criticized sociobiology. Hilary Rose suggested that Not in Our Genes had been misread by critics, and credited its authors with offering \\"an alternative theory to biological determinism more robust than the rather weak concept of interaction between nature and nurture\\". The historian of science Roger Smith described Not in Our Genes as an accessible critique of sociobiology. The psychologist Steven Pinker criticized Lewontin et al. for engaging in \\"innuendos about Donald Symons's sex life\\" and misquoting Dawkins. The sociologist Ullica Segerstråle suggested that Not in Our Genes, along with Gould's anti-sociobiological essays in Natural History, represented the height of the \\"critical attack\\" on sociobiology from its opponents. She noted that the book constituted a late admission from critics of sociobiology that some of them wanted a socialist society. According to Segerstråle, Rose threatened to sue Dawkins for libel for his review of the book, and although he did not make good on the threat, the evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton and other scientists made efforts to protect Dawkins, including seeking help from Segerstråle herself. She suggested that Rose's reaction to Dawkins's review may been influenced by the fact that while New Scientist, which commissioned reviews from Dawkins and Bateson, had expected the former to write a negative and the latter a positive review, both reviews were in fact negative, which may have disappointed Rose, a friend of Bateson. She also noted that the book's attack on sociobiology led Dawkins to identify himself as a sociobiologist for the first time. The behavioral ecologist John Alcock argued that while Lewontin et al. were correct to maintain that no genes for social behavior had been identified as of 1984, it was nevertheless clear that thousands of genes are expressed in human brain cells and must be relevant to the structure of the brain and to human behavior. Pinker accused Lewontin et al. of using words such as \\"determinism\\" and \\"reductionism\\" as \\"vague terms of abuse\\". He also accused them of misrepresenting the views of scientists such as Wilson and Dawkins, falsely ascribing ridiculous beliefs to them. He saw them and other critics of \\"determinism\\" as misusing the term by using it to refer to the idea that people simply have a tendency to behave in a certain fashion. Pinker endorsed Dawkins's review of Not in Our Genes. He noted that Lewontin and Rose were themselves both \\"reductionist biologists\\", and attributed their rejection of the idea of human nature to their acceptance of Marxism.

It is also a highly recognized think tank, ranked among the top ten in the world. Named in honor of President Woodrow Wilson, the only President of the United States to hold a PhD, its mission is \\"to commemorate the ideals and concerns of Woodrow Wilson by: providing a link between the world of ideas and the world of policy; and fostering research, study, discussion, and collaboration among a full spectrum of individuals concerned with policy and scholarship in national and world affairs.\\" In 2019, the Wilson Center was ranked by the University of Pennsylvania's Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program as the 11th best think tank in the world, the number five think tank in the U.S., and the world's top think tank for regional studies and institutional collaboration. Organization The Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, where the Wilson Center is located. The Center was established within the Smithsonian Institution, but it has its own board of trustees, composed both of government officials and of individuals from private life appointed by the President of the United States. The Center's director and staff include scholars, publishers, librarians, administrators, and support staff, responsible to the trustees for carrying out the mission of the Center. The trustees and staff are advised by a group of private citizens called the Wilson Council. Interns, usually undergraduate or graduate students, support the activities of visiting scholars and staff while learning the business of top-level research. Most of the Center's staff form specialized programs and projects covering broad areas of study. These programs and projects organize and host conferences and seminars, and support many kinds of research, communication, and publication on topics relevant to their areas. The Center also publishes a digital magazine, the Wilson Quarterly. Funding The Center is a public–private partnership. Approximately one-third of the Center's operating funds come annually from an appropriation from the U.S. government, and the Center itself is housed in a wing of the Ronald Reagan Building, a federal office building where the Center enjoys a 30-year rent-free lease. The remainder of the Center's funding comes from foundations, grants and contracts, corporations, individuals, endowment income, and subscriptions. Because of its historic reliance on congressional appropriations, the Center posts on its website a Plan for Federal Funding Hiatus. Administration Relief and inscription in the Memorial Hallway of the Woodrow Wilson Center The Board of Trustees, currently led by Governor Scott Walker, are appointed to six-year terms by the President of the United States.

Awardees are selected by the Board, and distributed at dinners benefitting the Center in different locations each year. Programs Most of the Center's staff form specialized programs and projects covering broad areas of study. There are approximately 14 programs, some of which are described below. =Africa Program= Established in 1999, the Wilson Center's Africa Program focuses on international affairs issues as affect Africa, conducts programmatic work to train and mentor rising leaders in Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and facilitates meetings between the policymaking communities of Washington, D.C., and Africa. Its current director is Monde Muyangawa. =Asia Program= The Wilson Center's Asia Program analyzes the politics, policy, culture, and issues of the broader Asia-Pacific region, encompassing a region stretching from Afghanistan to Japan. =Brazil Institute= Since its founding in 2006, the Brazil Institute has focused on analyzing and convening panels to discuss Brazilian politics, economics, and the country's global profile. =Canada Institute= Founded in 2001, the Canada Institute analyzes Canada-U.S. relations, trade, and Canada's international role as polar ice melts. =Cold War International History Project= The Cold War International History Project (CWIHP) supports the full and prompt release of historical materials by governments on all sides of the Cold War, seeking to integrate new sources, materials and perspectives from the former Eastern Bloc with the historiography of the Cold War. In particular, it disseminates new information and perspectives from previously inaccessible sources from the former Communist world on the history of the Cold War. In 2011, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars partnered with East China Normal University (ECNU), Shanghai, to launch the ECNU-Wilson Center Cold War Studies Initiative, it is supported by the Wilson Center's flagship Cold War International History Project (CWIHP) and ECNU's Cold War International Studies Center, the first Cold War Studies center in China. =Environmental Change and Security Program= The Environmental Change and Security Program (ECSP) was founded in 1994 to explore the connections among environmental, health, and population dynamics and their links to conflict, human insecurity, and foreign policy. =History and Public Policy Program= The History and Public Policy Program (HAPP) at the Woodrow Wilson Center focuses on the relationship between history and policy-making and seeks to foster open, informed and non-partisan dialogue on historically relevant issues. =Kennan Institute= The Kennan Institute (KI), founded in 1974 as a division of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, is committed to improving American understanding of Russia and the successor states to the Soviet Union. =Kissinger Institute on China and the United States= The Kissinger Institute analyzes the political, economic, historical, and cultural relationships between the United States and China. Named after Henry A. Kissinger, who as secretary of state was instrumental in opening diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China. Its current director is Robert Daly. =Mexico Institute= The Wilson Center's Mexico Institute conducts original research and analysis on Mexico's economy, convenes meetings, and proposes public policies. The institute focuses on five key areas: Mexico's security and rule of law, economic competitiveness (both of Mexico and the transnational economies along the border), migration, the U.S.-Mexico border, and energy issues. =Middle East Program= The Middle East Program, launched in 1998, analyzes geopolitical, cultural, and social trends in the Middle East and North Africa region. From May 8 until August 21, 2007, Dr. Haleh Esfandiari, then-director of the Middle East Program, was imprisoned in Tehran, Iran, in the Evin Prison. She was released on bail and had her passport returned to her on September 2, 2007. Esfandiari was then permitted to leave Iran. The former director of the Middle East Program is Dr. Henri Barkey. The History and Public Policy Program (HAPP) sponsored this 2009–2010 exhibit in the Memorial Hallway, Polish People's Republic—So Far Away and So Close By, which depicted key events in Polish history from 1944 to 1989. =North Korea International Documentation Project= The North Korea International Documentation Project translates and disseminates newly declassified documents about North Korea, largely drawing from its former communist allies. The documents are then distributed on the Wilson Center's Digital Archive site and curated in the project's dossier series. = Science and Technology Innovation Program = The Science and Technology Innovation Program (STIP) focuses on understanding bottom-up, public innovation; top- down, policy innovation; and, on supporting responsible and equitable practices at the point where new technology and existing political, social, and cultural processes converge. Many projects focus on the international nature of science and technology, such as the Global Mosquito Alert Consortium and upcoming Earth Challenge 2020 project.

","title":"Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars"},{"id":"1622570","text":"Dr. Reddy's Laboratories is an Indian multinational pharmaceutical company located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The company was founded by Anji Reddy, who previously worked in the mentor institute Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited. Dr. Reddy's manufactures and markets a wide range of pharmaceuticals in India and overseas. The company has over 190 medications, 60 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for drug manufacture, diagnostic kits, critical care, and biotechnology products. Dr. Reddy's began as a supplier to Indian drug manufacturers, but it soon started exporting to other less- regulated markets that had the advantage of not having to spend time and money on a manufacturing plant that would gain approval from a drug licensing body such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). By the early 1990s, the expanded scale and profitability from these unregulated markets enabled the company to begin focusing on getting approval from drug regulators for their formulations and bulk drug manufacturing plants - in more-developed economies. This allowed their movement into regulated markets such as the US and Europe. In 2014, Dr. Reddy Laboratories was listed among 1200 of India's most trusted brands according to the Brand Trust Report 2014, a study conducted by Trust Research Advisory, a brand analytics company. By 2007, Dr. Reddy's had seven FDA plants producing active pharmaceutical ingredients in India and seven FDA- inspected and ISO 9001 (quality) and ISO 14001 (environmental management) certified plants making patient-ready medications - five of them in India and two in the UK.

Company history Dr. Reddy's originally launched in 1984 producing active pharmaceutical ingredients. In 1986, Reddy's started operations on branded formulations. Within a year Reddy's had launched Norilet, the company's first recognized brand in India. Soon, Dr. Reddy's obtained another success with Omez, its branded omeprazole - ulcer and reflux oesophagitis medication - launched at half the price of other brands on the Indian market at that time. This is now branched in Hyderabad Within a year, Reddy's became the first Indian company to export the active ingredients for pharmaceuticals to Europe. In 1987, Reddy's started to transform itself from a supplier of pharmaceutical ingredients to other manufacturers into a manufacturer of pharmaceutical products. =International expansion= The company's first international move took it to Russia in 1992. There, Dr. Reddy's formed a joint venture with the country's biggest pharmaceuticals producer, Biomed. They pulled out in 1995 amid accusations of scandal, involving \\"a significant material loss due to the activities of Moscow's branch of Reddy's Labs with the help of Biomed's chief executive\\".Dr. Reddy's Laboratories will no longer produce its medicines in Russia - Pravda.ru 8 February 2005.Accessed: 2011-11-28. Reddy's sold the joint venture to the Kremlin-friendly Sistema group. In 1993, Reddy's entered into a joint venture in the Middle East and created two formulation units there and in Russia. Reddy's exported bulk drugs to these formulation units, which then converted them into finished products. In 1994, Reddy's started targeting the US generic market by building state of art manufacturing facility. =New drug discovery= Biopharma Finished Dosage Unit III in Hyderabad Biopharma Finished Dosage Unit I in Hyderabad Reddy's path into new drug discovery involved targeting speciality generics products in western markets to create a foundation for drug discovery. Development of speciality generics was an important step for the company's growing interest in the development of new chemical entities. The elements involved in creating a speciality generic, such as innovation in the laboratory, developing the compound, and sending the sales team to the market, are also stages in the development of a new specialty drug. Starting with speciality generics allowed the company to gain experience with those steps before moving on to creating brand-new drugs. Reddy's invested heavily in establishing R&D; labs and is the only Indian company to have significant R&D; being undertaken overseas. Dr. Reddy's Research Foundation was established in 1992 and in order to do research in the area of new drug discovery. At first, the foundation's drug research strategy revolved around searching for analogues. Focus has since changed to innovative R&D;, hiring new scientists, especially Indian students studying abroad on doctoral and post-doctoral courses. In 2000, the Foundation set up an American laboratory in Atlanta, dedicated to discovery and design of novel therapeutics. The laboratory is called Reddy US Therapeutics Inc (RUSTI) and its main aim is the discovery of next-generation drugs using genomics and proteomics. Reddy's research thrust focused on large niche areas in western markets - anti-cancer, anti-diabetes, cardiovascular and anti-infection drugs. Reddy's international marketing successes were built on a strong manufacturing base which itself was a result of inorganic growth through acquisition of international and national facilities. Reddy's merged Cheminor Drug Limited (CDL) with the primary aim of supplying active pharmaceutical ingredients to the technically demanding markets of North America and Europe. This merger also gave Reddy's an entry into the value-added generics business in the regulated markets of APIs. =Expansion and acquisition= By 1997, Reddy's made the transition from being an API and bulk drug supplier to regulated markets like the US and the UK, and a branded formulations supplier in unregulated markets like India and Russia, into producing generics, by filing an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) in the USA. The same year, Reddy's out-licensed a molecule for clinical trials to Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical company. It strengthened its Indian manufacturing operations by acquiring American Remedies Ltd. in 1999. This acquisition made Reddy's the third largest pharmaceutical company in India, after Ranbaxy and Glaxo (I) Ltd., with a full spectrum of pharmaceutical products, which included bulk drugs, intermediates, finished dosages, chemical synthesis, diagnostics and biotechnology. Reddy's also started exploiting Para 4 filing as a strategy in bringing new drugs to the market at a faster pace. In 1999 it submitted a Para 4 application for omeprazole, the drug that had been the cornerstone of its success in India. In December 2000, Reddy's had undertaken its first commercial launch of a generic product in the US, and its first product with market exclusivity was launched there in August 2001. The same year, it also became the first non-Japanese pharmaceutical company from the Asia-Pacific region to obtain a New York Stock Exchange listing, ground-breaking achievements for the Indian pharmaceutical industry. In 2001 Reddy's became the first Indian company to launch the generic drug, fluoxetine (a generic version of Eli Lilly and Company’s Prozac) with 180-day market exclusivity in the USA. Prozac had sales in excess of $1 billion per year in the late 1990s. Barr Laboratories of the U.S. obtained exclusivity for all of the approved dosage forms (10 mg, 20 mg) except one (40 mg), which was obtained by Reddy's. Lilly had numerous other patents surrounding the drug compound and had already enjoyed a long period of patent protection. The case to allow generic sales was heard twice by the Federal Circuit Court, and Reddy's won both hearings. Reddy's generated nearly $70 million in revenue during the initial six-month exclusivity period. With such high returns at stake, Reddy's was gambling on the success of the litigation; failure to win the case could have cost them millions of dollars, depending on the length of the trial. The fluoxetine marketing success was followed by the American launch of Reddy's house-branded ibuprofen tablets in 400, 600 and 800 mg strengths, in January 2003. Direct marketing under the Reddy's brand name represented a significant step in the company's efforts to build a strong and sustainable US generic business. It was the first step in building Reddy's fully-fledged distribution network in the US market. In 2015, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories bought the established brands of Belgian drugmaker UCB SA in South Asia for 8 billion rupees ($128.38 million). Dr. Reddy's Laboratories also signed a licensing pact with XenoPort for their experimental treatment to treat plaque psoriasis. As per the agreement, Dr. Reddy's will be granted exclusive US rights to develop and commercialize XP23829 for all indications for an upfront payment of $47.5 million. =American IPO and expansion into Europe= In 2001 Reddy's completed its US initial public offering of $132.8 million, secured by American Depositary Receipts. At that time the company also became listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Funds raised from the initial public offering helped Reddy's move into international production and take over technology- based companies. In 2002, Reddy's started its European operations by acquiring two pharmaceutical firms in the United Kingdom. The acquisition of BMS Laboratories and its wholly owned subsidiary, Meridian UK, allowed Reddy's to expand geographically into the European market. In 2003 Reddy's also invested $5.25 million (USD) in equity capital into Bio Sciences Ltd. Auriegene Discovery Technologies, a contract research company, was established as a fully owned subsidiary of Reddy's in 2002. Auriegene's objective was to gain experience in drug discovery through contract research for other pharmaceutical companies. Reddy's entered into a venture investment agreement with ICICI Bank, an established Indian banking company. Under the terms of the agreement, ICICI Venture agreed to fund the development, registration and legal costs related to the commercialization of ANDAs on a pre-determined basis. Upon commercialization of these products, Dr. Reddy's pays ICICI Venture royalty on net sales for a period of 5 years. =Global expansion= The company elected to expand globally, and acquired other entities. In March 2002, Dr. Reddy's acquired BMS Laboratories, Beverley, and its wholly owned subsidiary Meridian Healthcare, for 14.81 million Euros. These companies deal in oral solids, liquids and packaging, with manufacturing facilities in London and Beverley in the UK. Recently, Dr. Reddy's entered into an R&D; and commercialization agreement with Argenta Discovery Ltd., a private drug development company based in the UK, for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Dr. Reddy's entered into a 10-year agreement with Rheoscience A/S of Denmark for the joint development and commercialization of Balaglitazone (DRF-2593), a molecule for the treatment of type-2 diabetes. Rheoscience holds this product's marketing rights for the European Union and China, while the rights for the US and the rest of the world will be held by Dr. Reddy's. Dr. Reddy's conducted clinical trials of its cardiovascular drug RUS 3108 in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 2005. The trials were conducted to study the safety and the pharmacokinetic profiles of the drug, which is intended for the treatment of atherosclerosis, a major cause of cardiovascular disorders. Dr. Reddy's entered into a marketing agreement with Eurodrug Laboratories, a pharmaceutical company based in Netherlands, for improving its product portfolio for respiratory diseases. It introduced a second-generation xanthine bronchodilator, Doxofylline, which is used for the treatment of asthma and COPD patients. In 2004, Reddy's acquired Trigenesis Therapeutics Inc; a US-based private dermatology company. This acquisition gave Reddy's access to proprietary products and technologies in the dermatology sector. Dr. Reddy's Para 4 application strategy for generic business received a severe setback when Reddy's lost the patent challenge in the case of Pfizer’s drug Norvasc (amlodipine maleate), a drug indicated for the treatment of hypertension and angina. The cost involved in patent litigation as well as the unexpected loss of the patent challenge affected Reddy’s plans to start speciality business in the US generic markets. In March 2006, Dr. Reddy’s acquired Betapharm Arzneimittel GmbH from 3i for 480 million Euros. This is one of the largest-ever foreign acquisitions by an Indian pharmaceutical company. Betapharm is Germany’s fourth-largest generics pharmaceutical company, with a 3.5% market share, including 150 active pharmaceutical ingredients. Reddy’s has promoted India’s first integrated drug development company Perlecan Pharma Pvt Ltd together with ICICI ventures capital fund management company Ltd and Citigroup Venture Capital International growth partnership Mauritius Ltd. The combined entity will undertake clinical development and out-licensing of new chemical entity assets. Dr. Reddy's is presently licensed by Merck & Co. to sell an authorized generic version of the popular drug simvastatin (Zocor) in the USA. Since Dr. Reddy's has a license from Merck, it was not subject to the exclusivity period on generic simvastatin.Dr. Reddy’s receives exclusive rights for Zocor As of 2006, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories exceeded $500 million USD in revenues, flowing from their APIs, branded formulations and generics segments; the former two segments account for almost 75% of revenues. Dr. Reddy's deals in and manages all the processes, from the development of the API to the submission of finished dosage dossiers to the regulatory agencies. Patient-centric initiatives In September 2016, Dr. Reddy’s launched “Purple Health” in India, a patient centric platform to deliver solutions that address unmet needs of patients. Purple Health will address unmet needs of patients involving four segments: awareness, access (access to medication), adherence (adherence to therapy) and experience (simplified medication experience). The first step in this program will be the launch of new patient friendly packaging for its top 25 best- selling brands, which will be rolled-out in a phased manner over the next six months. The packaging has been designed such that blister packs would have extra space for brand name which ensures easy identification at the pharmacy, a tab at the bottom with expiry date clearly mentioned, and a pictorial representation of the time the medicine needs to be taken. In case of bottles, the measuring cup is now easy to read, and neck of the bottle has been modified to ensure minimal spillage. Purple Health also includes patient support services. For example, someone taking medicines for an advanced kidney condition would be supported by messages and counselling on diet, medicine and so on. Issues and recallsDrug discovery problems= In September 2005, Dr. Reddy's spun off its drug discovery and research wing into a separate company called Perlecan Pharma Private Limited. At the time, this was hailed as an innovative move, but in 2008, the company had to be wound down due to funding constraints.Perlecan highlights R&D; travails of Indian pharma , 17 October 2008.Accessed: 2009-10-18. Dr. Reddy's was the first Indian pharma company to attempt such an effort to de-couple risk of drug discovery from the parent company by creating a separate company with external source of funding. Perlecan Pharma was partially funded by ICICI Venture Capital and Citigroup Venture International, both of which held a 43% stake in Perlecan for an estimated $22.5 million. However, the company was forced to buy back the Perlecan shares from ICICI and Citigroup due to doubts regarding the commercial viability of the drug candidates that were in Perlecan's pipeline. At that point, Perlecan became a wholly owned subsidiary. In the board meeting of 23 October 2008, the company chose to amalgamate/absorb Perlecan, thereby making it an in-house research facility, as it was before 2005. In 2009, the company did a U-turn and has handed over discovery research and related intellectual property to its Bangalore-based subsidiary, with the possibility of spinning it off as a different entity altogether. \\"The company may be hoping to find a strategic partner in the future to share the risks and research funding.\\" DRL moving research arm to Bangalore unit 22 May 2009.

Biography Born in the village of Chłopy, near Lwów (now Lviv, Ukraine), on 19 February 1884, he attended a gymnasium in Lwów and studied classical linguistics at the University of Lwów. Upon the completion of his studies he became a gymnasium teacher first in Lwów, and later in Zamość. He became involved in politics after the Second Polish Republic gained independence following the First World War. He was a member of the Polish People's Party \\"Piast\\" political party, and, from 1931, a member of the People's Party. He became president of the Stronnictwo and the chief editor of the party's official paper, the 'Zielony Sztandar' in 1935. From 1919-30, and from 1934–35, he was a member of parliament for the Sejm (Polish Parliament), and from 1922-28 he was the Marshal of the Sejm. Between 1920–1921 he was the Minister of Religion and Public Education, and took part in work on the March Constitution. He was President of Poland twice: first in December 1922, as Acting President of the Republic of Poland for one week, after the assassination of president Gabriel Narutowicz, and again in May 1926, following Józef Piłsudski's May Coup and the resignation of president Stanisław Wojciechowski. His second term lasted half of a month. On both occasions, he oversaw special election and appointed new governments. In December 1939 he was arrested by Nazi Germany and executed in Palmiry during the German AB-Aktion operation in Poland.

Otto Witte's grave in Ohlsdorf Cemetery, Hamburg In 1913, when Albania broke away from the Ottoman Empire, some Albanian Muslims invited Halim Eddine, a nephew of the Sultan, to come and be crowned king. Noticing his own resemblance to Halim Eddine, Witte said, he traveled to Durrës with a friend, the sword- swallower Max Schlepsig. He claimed that he had succeeded in being crowned king by the local troops on 13 August 1913. He also claimed that, over the next five days, he enjoyed a harem and declared war on Montenegro before his ruse was discovered. His claims also include that he took a substantial portion of the kingdom's treasury,Jean-Pierre Bellemare (dir.), Les Génies de l'arnaque, Albin Michel, 1994. and along with Schlepsig he managed to escape the palace with the aid of the harem, and eventually made their way out of the country. Most parts of his story were found to be impossible. There was no Halim Eddine and the Sultan Abdul Hamid II's son Burhan Eddine, who was offered the throne in 1914, never came; he may be the model for this story. Originally he claimed this escapade happened in February 1913, when Albania was still under Serbian occupation, so he changed the date to August 1913. There is no local evidence to support his claims. Nevertheless, he became famous in Germany for his public appearance. The Berlin police later allowed his official identity card to bear the artistic pseudonym ehemaliger König von Albanien (\\"former King of Albania\\"). For the rest of his life he insisted on being greeted with that title, and it was put on his tombstone at Ohlsdorf Cemetery, Hamburg (Parzelle Q 9, 430–433). He may have suffered from pseudologia fantastica; for example, he claimed to have founded a political party. He said he was a candidate for the German presidency in 1925, gaining 25,000 to 230,000 votes in the first round but resigning in favour of Paul von Hindenburg. The voting records do not support this either. Interest in Albania was high in the German-speaking world because the Great Powers had chosen a German prince to sit on the throne. William of Wied offered the throne in 1913 and reigned for six months in 1914. The similarity in name between Wied and Witte may have inspired Witte to make up the story. Adaptions Otto Witte's story was adapted by Harry Turtledove for his fantasy novel Every Inch a King. Witte's story bears a strong resemblance to the best-selling adventure novel The Prisoner of Zenda (1894), of which the first film adaptation was released in 1913. The central concept of Zenda is a commoner being mistaken for a king, and assuming his place. Another adaption of Otto Witte's story is in the 2012 novel \\"If you're reading this I'm already dead\\" by Andrew Nicoll. Various newspapers and magazines took Otto's story as fact and repeated it, including Time magazine, which published an article about his tale in 1958.

Siemens Schuckert was founded in 1903 when Siemens & Halske acquired Schuckertwerke. Subsequently, Siemens & Halske specialized in communications engineering and Siemens-Schuckert in power engineering and pneumatic instrumentation. During World War I Siemens-Schuckert also produced aircraft. It took over manufacturing of the renowned Protos vehicles in 1908. In World War II, the company had a factory producing aircraft and other parts at Monowitz near Auschwitz. There was a workers camp near the factory known as Bobrek concentration camp. The Siemens Schuckert logo consisted of an S with a smaller S superimposed on the middle with the smaller S rotated left by 45 degrees.Siemens used this as a theme for their logos with absorbed companies: Siemens & Halske's logo was a large S with a small superimposed and rotated H. Others were Siemens-Apparate- und Maschinenbau (A), Siemens-Bauunion (B), Siemens-Planiawerke (P) and Siemens-Reiniger (R) The logo was used into the late 1960s, when both companies merged with the Siemens-Reiniger-Werke AG to form the present-day Siemens AG. Aircraft Siemens-Schuckert built a number of designs in World War I and inter-war era. They also produced aircraft engines under the Siemens-Halske brand, which evolved into their major product line after the end of World War I. The company reorganized as Brandenburgische Motorenwerke, or simply Bramo, in 1936, and were later purchased in 1939 by BMW to become BMW Flugmotorenbau. Siemens-Schuckert designed a number of heavy bombers early in World War I, building a run of seven Riesenflugzeug. Intended to be used in the strategic role in long duration flights, the SSW R-series had three 150 h.p Benz Bz.III engines in the cabin driving two propellers connected to a common gear-box through a combination leather-cone and centrifugal-key clutch in SSW R.I to the SSW R.VII models (the SSW R.VIII utilized four engines). In the case of engine failure, which was extremely common at the time, the bomber could continue flying on two engines while the third was repaired by the in-flight mechanic. Two transmission shafts transferred the power from the gear-box to propeller gear-boxes mounted on the wing struts. Although there were some problems with the clutch system, the gear-box proved to be reliable when properly maintained. The SSW R.1 through the SSW R.VII designs were noted for their distinctive forked fuselage. Several of these aircraft (SSW R.V through the SSW R.VII) fought on the Eastern Front. Although interesting in concept, the cost of these and the R-types from other companies was so great that the air force eventually abandoned the concept until more practical designs arrived later in the war. The first fighter designed at the works was the Siemens-Schuckert E.I which appeared in mid 1915, and was the first aircraft to be powered by the Siemens- Halske Sh.I, a new rotary, developed by Siemens-Schuckert, in which the cylinders and the propeller rotated in opposite directions. A small number of production machines were supplied to various Feldflieger Abteilung to supplement supplies of the Fokker and Pfalz monoplane fighters used at the time mainly for escort work. The prototype SSW E.II, powered by the inline Argus AsII, crashed in June 1916, killing Franz Steffen, one of the designers of the SSW R types. By early 1916 the first generation of German monoplane fighters were outclassed by the Nieuport 11 and the Nieuport 17 which very quickly followed it; and Siemens-Schuckert were supplied with a captured Nieuport 17 to \\"study\\". The resulting SSW D.I was powered by the Siemens- Halske Sh.I, but was otherwise a fairly literal copy of the Nieuport 17. This aircraft was the first Siemens-Schuckert fighter to be ordered in quantity, but by the time it became available in numbers (well into 1917) it was outclassed by contemporary Albatros fighters. Development of the Sh.I engine resulted in the eleven-cylinder, 160 hp Sh.III, perhaps one of the most advanced rotary engine designs of the war. The D.I fighter also formed the basis for a series of original designs, which by the end of 1917 had reached a peak in the Siemens-Schuckert D.III, which went into limited production in early 1918, and found use in home defense units as an interceptor, due to its outstanding rate of climb. Further modifications improved its handling and performance to produce the Siemens-Schuckert D.IV. Several offshoots of the design included triplanes and a parasol monoplane, but none saw production. With the end of the war production of the D.IV continued, mainly for sales to Switzerland who flew them into the late 1920s. With the signing of the Treaty of Versailles the next year all aircraft production in Germany was shut down. Siemens-Schuckert immediately disappeared, but Siemens-Halske continued sales of the Sh.III and started development of smaller engines for the civilian market. By the mid-1920s their rotary engines were no longer in vogue, but \\"non-turning\\" versions of the same basic mechanicals led to a series of 7-cylinder radial engines, the Sh.10 through Sh.14A, delivering up to 150 hp in the 14A. The Sh.14A became a best-seller in the trainer market, and over 15,000 of all the versions were eventually built. Siemens-Halske no longer had any competitive engines for the larger end of the market, and to address this they negotiated a license in 1929 to produce the 9-cylinder Bristol Jupiter IV. Minor changes for the German market led to the Sh.20 and Sh.21. Following the evolution of their smaller Sh.14's, the engine was then bored out to produce the 900 hp design, the Sh.22. In 1933 new engine naming was introduced by the RLM, and this design became the Sh.322, when Siemens was given the 300-block of numbers. The Sh.322 design had reliability problems and never became popular. The company reorganized as Bramo in 1936, and continued development of what was now their own large engine. Modifying the Sh.322 with the addition of fuel injection and a new supercharger led to the Bramo 323 Fafnir, which entered production in 1937. Although rather outdated in terms of design, by this time the engine had matured into a highly reliable powerplant despite its comparatively poor fuel economy, and 5,500 were produced until the lines shut down in 1944. In design terms the 323 was basically a dead-end with little growth potential. By the start of the war its 1,000 hp was already at the low end of the performance scale, and use was limited to transports and bombers. In order to build a 1,500 hp-class engine Bramo started development of a two-row version of the engine as the Bramo 329, mirroring similar developments at BMW who were trying to scale up their Pratt & Whitney Hornet into the two-row BMW 139. Design of both engines was well advanced in 1939 when BMW bought Bramo, and cancelled work on the 329 to concentrate on what would become the excellent BMW 801. World War II Prisoners producing aircraft parts in the Siemens-Schuckert factory at Bobrek. Realizing the two- row radial development was a risky proposition; Bramo engineers had also started developing axial-flow jet engines in 1938. They were awarded a development contract to continue work on two designs, which would later become the 109-002 and 109-003 when the RLM officially started supporting jet development. The -002 used an advanced contra-rotating compressor for added efficiency, while the -003 used a simpler compressor/stator system that remains in use in modern designs today. The -002 proved to be too complex and work on it soon ended, but the -003 showed definite promise and eventually became the BMW 003. Monowitz The company had a work camp near Monowitz producing parts for the aircraft, and known as Bobrek concentration camp. It employed ostarbeiter as well as Auschwitz prisoners in its factory. The main factory to which Brobrek was attached was a site designed to make synthetic rubber and gasoline, and it was owned by IG Farben, one of the largest chemical combines in Germany during the war. It was one of numerous Auschwitz sub-camps established by large German companies to supply armaments to the armed forces, and other companies included Krupp, Rheinmetal and AEG. They were all making not just small side arms such as pistols and machine guns but also large weapons like artillery as well as U-boat and aircraft parts.

The reservoir covers 200 acres (800,000 m2) and holds 1.3 billion imperial gallons (5.9 billion litres) of water. The valley was flooded in 1958 and completely submerged farmland, roads and part of the Ashover Light Railway. The reservoir also destroyed most of the village of Woolley, including the Woolley House Hydro, the village store, the blacksmiths, the joiners, the laundry, the sheep-dip and 'Napoleons Home', the local public house. The villagers were relocated into council houses built in another local hamlet, Badger Lane, which eventually became known as the village of Woolley on the Moor, which subsequently became the present village of Woolley Moor. left The reservoir provides many leisure activities including sailing, windsurfing and trout-fishing.

The command flag for an Admiral of the Blue is a plain blue flag. History The Navy Royal inaugurated squadron colours during the reign of Elizabeth I (1558-1603) to subdivide the English fleet into three squadrons. There were three classes of admirals and differentiated by using coloured flags. In 1620 the official Flag ranks of Admiral, Vice Admiral, and Rear Admiral were legally established that arose directly out of the organisation of the fleet into three parts. In 1688 the formal flag rank of Admiral of the Fleet was created.

The brand was previously owned by U.S.-based personal and cleaning products manufacturer and marketer Procter & Gamble. First introduced to the U.S. in 1949, Joy was an early example of a product being reformulated to include the fragrance of lemons and helped begin the overall trend toward citrus-scented cleaning products. Joy is designed for use in the hand washing of dishes, not automatic dishwashers, and as such also contains emollients designed to protect the user's hands from drying out. The product was an early and long-term sponsor of several \\"soap operas\\", including the long-running pioneering soap Search for Tomorrow. There are several kinescopes existing of 1950s' \\"soap operas\\" containing these commercials, usually with the famous slogan, \\"From grease to shine in half the time\\". The Joy brand was introduced into Japan during the 1990s, where it became market leader for a period of time. Available in both \\"non-ultra\\" and \\"ultra\\" (concentrated) strengths, Joy remains one of the most recognizable dish brands in North America, with a loyal customer following across the US and Latin American retail markets. Although Joy’s stapled lemon fragrance remains its most widely distributed line, Orange Joy has grown in popularity in recent years.

There are several alternatives for the upper secondary education later on, the most common being the four (three until 2017) years of a liceum or five (four until 2017) years in a technikum. Both end with a maturity exam (matura, similar to French baccalauréat), and may be followed by several forms of upper education, leading to Bachelor: licencjat or inżynier (the Polish Bologna Process first cycle qualification), Master: magister (the Polish Bologna Process second cycle qualification) and eventually PhD: doktor (the Polish Bologna Process third cycle qualification). The system of education in Poland allows for 22 years of continuous, uninterrupted schooling. Compulsory educationPrimary school= Primary school usually starts at seven years old. Following changes introduced by 2016 act \\"Law on School Education\\" primary school was extended to 8 years. The first three year cycle is \\"integrated\\", with one teacher handling alone all or most of the subjects, while the following five years are taught by subject-specific teachers. At the end of primary school, pupils write a compulsory national competence test. If successfully completed, the examination grants a primary-school leaving certificate. The Polish Education system for primary school aged children is centred around a pedagogical style that focuses on the learning of facts and does not involve the concept of exploration or investigation, individuality and opinions are inconsequential. =Junior high school= Until 2019, the junior high school (gimnazjum) covered lower secondary education and ended general basic education and lasted three years. The subjects taught were: Polish language, history, civic education, two foreign languages, mathematics, physics and astronomy, chemistry, biology, geography, fine arts/music, technology, information technology, physical education and religion or ethics. At the end of the curriculum, pupils were evaluated based on their continuing results and on an examination in humanities, science and foreign languages. Following 2016 reform by PiS ruling party changes to Polish education system were gradually introduced. Starting with the school year of 2017/18, middle schools were scheduled to be disbanded, primary schools to be extended to eight years and upper secondary schools to be given one year more, as it was before 1999. Institutions were either set to close or to be changed into primary schools or high schools by 1 September 2019. Upper secondary education Upper secondary education begins at the end of full-time compulsory education, preparing students for entry directly into the and/or tertiary (i.e. higher) education. Upper secondary education takes many forms. General education can be pursued in general secondary schools (liceum): after three years, students can pass the \\"Matura\\", which grants access to higher education. Vocational and technical education is mainly provided by technical schools (technikum) and/or basic vocational schools (zasadnicza szkoła zawodowa). Technical schools last four years and lead to the Matura. Their primary goal is to teach occupations and trades, the most popular being: accountant, mechanic, electronics specialist, and salesperson. Basic vocational schools provide a vocational education lasting two years and grant a certificate of competence in various fields, the most popular being: shop- assistant, cook, gardener, automobile mechanic, hairdresser and baker. Graduates from basic vocational schools can pass the Matura after an extra- curriculum of two years in a general secondary school, or, since 2004, of three years in a technical school. Profiled general secondary schools (liceum profilowane) provide a vocational education in three years, but only in fields described by the Polish Classification of Activities (PKD). In addition, mentally and/or physically handicapped students can join special schools (szkoła specjalna) which prepare them for the Matura in three years.  Tertiary education  University of Łódź, Faculty of Management Poland follows the Bologna scheme and most of its tertiary level programmes are made of two cycles: a three-year bachelor's degree followed by a two-year master's degree. Some master's degrees are however granted after a unique long-cycle programme, lasting between four and six years (Ex: five years for pharmacy, six year for medicine). Doctoral programmes are achieved in about three years. The diploma of primary school teachers requires three years of study within a teacher training college. Vocational education is handled by post-secondary school (szkoła policealna) with programmes lasting two and a half years. =Grading system at university level= University-level education uses a numeric system of grades from two to five, with most grades including 0.5 point increments: 2.0 is the failing grade, 3.0 is the lowest passing grade, followed by 3.5, 4.0 and 4.5, with 5.0 being the highest grade. There is no grade 2.5. A 5.5 or 6.0 is sometimes given as an \\"exceeds expectations\\" grade, but this differs among various universities and may be equivalent to 5.0 for some purposes. Similarly \\"3-\\" is occasionally (but very rarely) given as a \\"barely passing\\" grade, but for all official purposes it is equivalent to 3.0. The grading is done every semester (twice a year), not just once in a school year. Depending on the subject, the final grade may be based on the result of a single exam, or on the student's performance during the whole semester. In the latter case, a point system is generally used rather than the 2–5 scale. The points accumulated during the semester are added and converted to a final grade according to some scale. As a failing grade means merely having to repeat the failed subject, and can usually be corrected on a retake exam (and in some cases also on a special \\"committee exam\\"), it is used much more liberally, and it is quite common for a significant number of students to fail a class on the first attempt.  Foreign languages  Students in Polish schools typically learn one or two foreign languages. In 2005/06, the fractions of students studying foreign languages in Polish schools included: English – 67.9%, German – 33.3%, French – 13.3%, Spanish – 10.2%, Russian – 6.1%, Italian – 4.3%, Latin – 0.6%. In 2005/06, there were 49,200 students in schools for national minorities, most of them in German, Kashubian, Ukrainian and Belarusian language schools. Under the education reform introduced by Polish education minister Katarzyna Hall, students of Polish lower secondary schools had to learn two different foreign languages. The first foreign language (usually English) was taught three times a week. The second foreign language was taught twice a week. The reform introduced two different levels of the exam – a higher level (if a student learnt the same language in primary school) and a standard level (if a student learnt the first language in lower secondary school). The results of lower secondary school language examinations contributed to the criteria of applying to enter upper secondary level school.  History  The education of Polish society was a goal of rulers as early as the 12th century, and Poland soon became one of the most educated countries in Europe. The library catalog of the Cathedral Chapter of Kraków dating back to 1110 shows that in the early 12th-century Polish intellectuals had access to European literature. The Jagiellonian University, founded in 1364 by King Casimir III in Kraków, is one of Europe's oldest universities. In 1773 King Stanisław August Poniatowski established the Commission of National Education (Komisja Edukacji Narodowej), the world's first state ministry of education. The first university in Poland, Kraków's Jagiellonian University, was established in 1364 by Casimir III the Great in Kraków. It is the oldest university in Poland. It is the second oldest university in Central Europe (after Prague University) and one of the oldest universities in the world. Casimir III realized that the nation needed a class of educated people, especially lawyers, who could codify the country's laws and administer the courts and offices. His efforts to found an institution of higher learning in Poland were finally rewarded when Pope Urban V granted him permission to open the University of Kraków. In the 16th century, 90% of all parishes in Lesser Poland and Greater Poland had schools where grammar and Latin were taught at the basic level, while secondary education was available in cities and larger towns. At the Jagiellonian University, 65% of students came from urban backgrounds, 25% from the nobility and 10% from peasant families. The idea of compulsory education was put forward by Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski in 1555. After the partitions of Poland, compulsory education was introduced by Prussian authorities in Polish provinces which belonged to Prussia (1825), and Austrian authorities in Galicia (1873). In the Russian Empire compulsory education did not exist. As a result, in 1921, after Poland regained independence, one-third of the population of the Second Polish Republic was illiterate. Illiteracy was very high in the east, but almost non-existent in western provinces. Compulsory education in Poland was introduced by a decree in February 1919. This covered all children aged 7 to 14. At the beginning, however, the newly created Polish state faced several problems of implementation – a lack of qualified teachers, buildings and funds. After World War II, compulsory education remained as one of the priorities of the state. By 1978, only 1.2 percent of the Polish population was illiterate. In Poland, compulsory education ends at the age of 18. It usually starts when children are 6 years old and ends after 12 years of learning (usually in a high school). Contemporary Polish law distinguishes between compulsory school (obowiązek szkolny) and compulsory education (obowiązek nauki). A major reform of the education system took place in 1999, changing the overall organisational structure from 8 (primary school) + 4 (high school/liceum) years of education to 6 (primary) + 3 (junior high school, gimnazjum) + 3 (senior high school, liceum) years. The reform increased time spent on core subjects and delayed vocational study (lyceum) by one year. Poland's OECD educational rankings for reading and science shifted from being below average to being in the top 10, and to the top 15 for mathematics. = PiS reforms of 2016 = The PiS government of Poland introduced a major educational reform in 2016, for successive implementation over the three school years starting with 2017/2018. The reform reverts the overall organisational structure from 6 (primary) + 3 (junior high school) + 3 (high school) years of education to 8 (primary school) + 4/5 (high school) years. According to history teacher Anna Dzierzgowska, the reform inherits the Polish-centred and Eurocentric focuses of the previous history syllabus, removes the Non-Aligned Movement from the syllabus, and focuses on political and military leaders and the nobility, neglecting the historical role of lower social classes. The term communism was removed from teaching about the nineteenth century, during which it is called socialism, and only appears later in association with the Polish People's Republic. Dzierzgowska argues that the notion of nationalism historically dates only back to the nineteenth century, but is used much too frequently in the new curriculum, giving pupils insufficient geographical context. Violence In 2006, in response to the suicide of a girl after she was sexually molested in school, the Polish Minister of Education, Roman Giertych, launched a \\"zero tolerance\\" school reform.Easton, A. (2006, November 3). Polish drug use and suicide sparks school plan. BBC News Online, London. Under this plan, teachers would have the legal status of civil servants, making violent crimes against them punishable by higher penalties. Head teachers (equivalent to principals in the US) will be, in theory, able to send aggressive pupils to perform community service and these students' parents may also be fined. Teachers who fail to report violent acts in school could face a prison sentence. The shadow in our schools (2006, December 20). Warsaw Voice.

Life and writings  Persecution of witches Praetorius was born in Lippstadt as the son of Matthes Schulze.Hartmut Hegeler: Anton Praetorius, Kämpfer gegen Hexenprozesse und Folter, (fighter against the persecution of witches and against torture) Unna, 2002:de:Anton Praetorius. He later changed his name to the Latin Praetorius. He studied theology and became principal of the humanistic Latin school in Kamen, Westphalia. There, he married, but his wife Maria died of the plague. They had one child, Johannes. Heidelberg Castle Wine Barrel As the first Calvinist pastor in the parish of Dittelsheim, he undertook a trip to Heidelberg, the centre of Calvinist theology in Germany. Praetorius was so impressed by the Great Wine Barrel in Heidelberg Castle that he published a poem with the title \\"Vas Heidelbergense\\" in October 1595, praising its size as an apparent proof of the superiority of the Calvinist religion. In his poem on Wolfgang Ernst, Count of Ysenburg, Büdingen and Birstein (\\"De pii magistratus officio\\"), he asked the Christian governments for a reformation of nation and church along the principles of the Bible and the Calvinist faith. Subsequently, the count called him as a princely preacher to his castle in Birstein near Frankfurt. In the town of Birstein, Praetorius published church songs, a catechism, and a book for families about Christian education in 1597. In 1602, he made a contribution to the discussion about the interpretation of the Last Supper and the Sacraments in his book De Sacrosanctis novi foederis Jesu Christi. Fight against the persecution of witches Praetorius Bericht Zauberey 1602 In 1597 Praetorius was appointed as pastor to the Count of Büdingen/ Ysenburg in Birstein and had to witness the torture of 4 women accused of witchcraft. File Birstein Witchcraft Trial 1597 According to the court records, Reverend Praetorius was so upset about the torture of the accused women that he pressed for a stop in the trial against the last surviving woman. His protest against the torture can be found in the record of the witch-trial of Birstein 1597: \\"As the pastor has violently protested against the torture of the women, it has therefore been stopped this time.\\" As a consequence Anton Praetorius was dismissed by the count. In his new parochy in Laudenbach near Heidelberg he wrote the book Gründlicher Bericht über Zauberey und Zauberer (Thorough Report about Witchcraft and Witches) to protest against torture and the prosecution of witches. At first he published the book in 1598 under the name of his son Johannes Schulze (\\"Johannes Scultetus\\"). In 1602 he dared to publish the book under his own name. The book was published again in 1613 and posthumously in 1629. Praetorius was one of the first to describe the terrible situation of the prisoners and to protest against torture, and with his \\"Bericht\\" Praetorius publicly objected to the prevailing attitude in the church (a view held by Roman Catholics as well as Protestants such as Martin Luther and John Calvin) on the torture and burning of witches.

During his reign he managed to expand the Kara Koyunlu’s territory to its largest extent, including Eastern Anatolia, most of present-day Iraq, central Iran, and even eventually Kerman. He also subjugated neighbouring states. He was one of the greatest rulers of the Kara Koyunlu. He was also allegedly fond of drinking and entertainment. During his reign Jahan Shah had the Gökmedrese and Muzafferiye theological schools constructed in his capital city Tabriz.  During reign of Qara Yusuf  He was sent to retake Soltaniyeh and Qazvin just before his father's death. During reign of Qara Iskander Around 1420 Jahan Shah married the daughter of Alexios IV of Trebizond and Theodora Kantakouzene, part of the agreement being that Alexius would continue paying to the Kara Koyunlu the tribute that Trebizond had formerly paid to Timur. During the reign of his brother Qara Iskander (1420–36), as a potential rival to the throne, Jahan Shah’s life was not safe and he took refuge with his other brother Ispend who was ruling Baghdad. In 1436 he obtained the help of the Timurid ruler Shah Rukh to defeat Qara Iskander and seize the throne for himself. Having been helped to power by Shah Rukh he ruled at first as a vassal of the Timurids. He was also adopted by Goharshad Begum and crowned on 19 April 1438, along taking epithet \\"Muzaffar al-Din\\". Campaigns against Georgia In 1440, King Alexander I of Georgia refused to pay tribute to Jahan Shah. In March Jahan Shah responded by invading Georgia with 20,000 troops, destroyed the city of Samshvilde and sacked Tbilisi before returning to Tabriz. He was accompanied by Shaykh Ibrahim, father of future Shaykh Junayd. He also mounted a second military expedition against Georgia in 1444. His forces met those of Alexander’s successor, King Vakhtang IV at Akhaltsikhe, but the fighting was inconclusive and Jahan Shah returned to Tabriz once more. Conquest of Baghdad Jahan Shah’s brother Ispend, who had ruled over Baghdad and its environs for twelve years, died in 1445 and he bequeathed the government of the state to his nephew Alvand Mirza since his son Fulad Mirza was too young at the time. However most of the emirs preferred Fulad. He decided to organise a military expedition against Baghdad with the backing of some of the emirs, who had sought refuge with him. After a siege of seven months, Baghdad was captured on 9 June 1446. He also appointed his nephews Alvand Mirza, Rustam, Tarkhan and Mahmud to jointly govern Mosul. He appointed his son Mirza Muhammad to govern Baghdad in his name. Reign Upon the death of the Timurid ruler Shah Rukh in 1447, Jahan Shah became an independent ruler of the Kara Koyunlu, and started to use the titles of sultan and khan. At the same time, the Timurid Empire took advantage of the struggles among the Turkoman princes and captured the cities of Sultaniya and Qazvin. Peace was made when Sultan Muhammad bin Baysonqor was married to a daughter of Jahan Shah. However, he retook lands he lost from Mirza Babur. He appointed his son Pirbudag to govern Isfahan in 1452. He was successful enough to seize Herat on 28 June 1458. However a revolt in Azerbaijan forced him to abandon Eastern campaign. Jahan Shah's son Hasan Ali was kept in Maku prison for a while for his rebellious nature. He was defeated in winter 1458. But this time, his son Pirbudag rebelled, who was soon joined by Hasan Ali in Fars. However, he was spared at the request of his mother and replaced by Mirza Yusuf, another son of Jahan Shah. Pirbudag was sent to govern Baghdad, his other sons Qasim beg was assigned to Kerman with Hasan Ali being imprisoned again. However, Pirbudag again rebelled, now controlling Baghdad. He was defeated in 1464 and was executed by Mirza Muhammad. Conflict with the Ak Koyunlu Conflict with Jahangir = From around 1447 Jahan Shah was involved in a struggle against the Ak Koyunlu who had always been sworn enemies of the Kara Koyunlu. First of these battles happened when Alvand Mirza rebelled and fled to Jahangir beg, chief of Ak Koyunlu. Jahan Shah demanded his rebellious nephew, but Jahangir refused to hand him over. Jahan Shah invaded Erzincan and sent his commander - Rustem beg to subdue Jahangir. Hopeless Jahangir sent his mother Sara Khatun to Mamluk Egypt while Jahan Shah started to support his half-brother Sheikh Hasan. While Sheikh Hasan was killed by Uzun Hasan, brother of Jahangir; Jahan Shah hasted to offer peace to Ak Koyunlu, in return to accept their submission. Jahangir accepted and also wed his daughter to Mirza Muhammad. = Conflict with Uzun Hasan = Uzun Hasan did not acknowledge his elder brother's submission and rebelled against him, capturing Amid in 1457. Jahangir fled to Jahan Shah. Uzun Hasan was also supported by Safavids, their leader Shaykh Junayd being brother-in-law to Uzun Hasan. He was replaced by Shaykh Jafar - his uncle. Jahan Shah set out from Tabriz with a great army on 16 May 1466, and came to the basin of Lake Van. While there, he was furious to learn that Uzun Hasan was raiding his lands with 12,000 cavalry. Meanwhile, Uzun Hasan, suspecting that Jahan Shah was planning to attack him, had carefully guarded the mountain passes. Envoys went back and forth between them, but because of Jahan Shah’s heavy demands, an agreement could not be reached. Having advanced as far as Muş, Jahan Shah had to postpone his attack because of the onset of winter. As his troops began to complain, he decided to withdraw to a winter residence. Uzun Hasan caught his army by surprise and totally defeated them in a sudden attack. Mirza Yusuf and Mirza Muhammad was captured on 30 October or 11 November 1467 at the Battle of Chapakchur. Jahan Shah was killed in battle while fleeing. and with his death the great era of Kara Koyunlu history came to an end. He was succeeded by his son Hasan Ali. Jahan Shah had been buried in southern part of Blue Mosque, Tabriz. Legacy Goy Macid.296x296px In the year 1462, Abd al-Razzaq described Jahan-shah's rule in the following terms: \\"Owing to the benevolent administration (husn-i 'inayat va lutf-i atifat) of Mirza Jahan-shah, Azarbaijan was a highly thriving state. That well-meaning sovereign was anxious to practice justice, to secure prosperity of the country, and to treat his subjects honourably. The capital, Tabriz, by its numerous population and the prevalence of tranquility, emulated Egypt (misr-i jami). The rumours of the good behaviour of that felicitous king spread throughout the world. The inhabitants of his God-protected kingdom, indifferent to the arrows of events, enjoyed peace\\". Jahan Shah, along with being a poet, promoted culture, learning and architecture. Using the pseudonym \\"Haqiqi\\", Jahan Shah wrote poetry in Azeribajani Turkic and Persian. In 1447 he married his daughter to a descendant of the famous mystic Shah Nimatullah Vali whom the Shia revered as a saint and a worker of miracles.  Family  He was married several times.

The entrance to Parliament House is in the corner to the left of the library. Parliament House in Edinburgh, Scotland is a complex of several buildings housing the Supreme Courts of Scotland. The original building was home to the pre-Union Parliament of Scotland from 1639 to 1707. It is located in the Old Town, just off the High Street section of the Royal Mile, beside St Giles Cathedral. Parliament Hall The oldest part of Parliament House is Parliament Hall, which the Town Council of Edinburgh, at its expense, had built as a permanent home for the Parliament of Scotland, and as such is the oldest extant purpose-built parliamentary building in the British Isles.Records of the Scottish Parliament, St Andrews University. Under Locations of Parliament-accessed 26 August 2013 It was completed in 1641 to the design of James Murray. The main interior feature is the elaborate oak trussed flat roof supported on carved stone corbels. Often described as a hammerbeam roof, it is a false hammerbeam, necessitated by the flat roof design. The internal ornamentation is provided by downward thrusting radial struts. The roof of the former Tron Kirk further down the High Street is similar in style but, because of the pitch of the roof, is a true hammerbeam. After the Act of Union 1707, the Parliament of Scotland was adjourned, and the building ceased to be used for its original function. The Hall was used for the sitting of courts, but in recent times has been subject to restoration work and now remains open as a meeting place for lawyers. Beneath Parliament Hall lies the Laigh Hall, of similar plan form but considerably less height. =Artwork in Parliament Hall= Figures of \\"Justice\\" and \\"Mercy\\". The right- hand example of the two smaller fireplaces has carved scenes from The Merchant of Venice. Statues on the north wall include: The 1st Viscount Melville by Sir Francis Chantrey (1818); The 2nd Viscount Melville by Sir Francis Chantrey (1824); Lord Cockburn by William Brodie (1863). On the east wall: Duncan Forbes by Roubiliac (1752); Lord Jeffrey by Sir John Steell (1855); Lord President Boyle by Sir John Steell (1860); Lord President Blair by Sir Francis Chantrey (1815). On the west wall: Sir Walter Scott by John Greenshields (1835); Henry Erskine by Peter Turnerelli (1811); and various busts by William Brodie and Sir John Steell. There are multiple paintings by Sir Henry Raeburn: George Joseph Bell; Sir William Nairne, Lord Dunsinane; William Craig, Lord Craig; Matthew Ross; and Lord Abercromby of Tullibody. Paintings by John Watson Gordon include Lord Robertson, Alexander Wood, General Boyle and Erskine Douglas Sandford. Other works include Sir Thomas Hope by George Jameson, Lord Mansfield by David Martin, George Deas, Lord Deas by John Graham Gilbert, Sir Ilay Campbell by John Partridge, John Inglis, Lord Glencorse by George Reid. and Duncan McNeill by John Phillip. In a corridor beyond the south door of the hall stand figures of \\"Justice\\" and \\"Mercy\\" by Alexander Mylne (1637) which formerly stood over the main entrance on Parliament Square. Courts 1877 plan of the complex, including Parliament Hall, the Signet Library and the Advocates' Library Even while the old Parliament was still in existence, parts of the buildings were used for legal cases, and afterwards this became the main function of the building. The building is now used to house the College of Justice and other connected functions. In modern times, the building is chiefly used by the Court of Session, which hears civil cases, whilst most of the work of the High Court of Justiciary, which hears criminal cases, takes place in a dedicated building on the other side of the Royal Mile which formerly housed Edinburgh's Sheriff Court. Libraries The Advocates' Library was founded in 1682, and is currently located in a William Henry Playfair-designed building to the west of the south end of Parliament Hall. It remains a heavily used legal resource. As well as collecting legal works, it was also a deposit library, and in 1925 the non-legal books in their collection were given to the new National Library of Scotland, which is located next to the library, on George IV Bridge. To the west of the north end of Parliament Hall is The Signet Library. It is a private library, funded by members of The Society of Writers to Her Majesty's Signet, who are generally practising solicitors. Construction began in 1810 to a design by Robert Reid, and it presents a classical front to Parliament Square. This façade wraps around Parliament House as well, and replaced the existing Scottish baronial façade.

It is used in building construction, refrigeration units, and insulated shipping containers to provide better insulation performance than conventional insulation materials. Construction VIPs consist of: * Membrane walls, used to prevent air from entering the panel. * A panel of a rigid, highly-porous material, such as fumed silica, aerogel, perlite, or glass fiber, to support the membrane walls against atmospheric pressure once the air is evacuated. * Chemicals (known as getters) to collect gases leaked through the membrane or offgassed from the membrane materials. These are added to VIPs with glass-fiber or foam cores, because cores with bigger pore size require a higher vacuum (less than about 1 mbar) during the planned service life. Thermal performance Heat transfer occurs by three modes: convection, conduction and radiation. Creating a vacuum practically eliminates convection, since this relies on the presence of gas molecules able to transfer heat energy by bulk movement. A small decrease in pressure has no effect on the thermal conductivity of a gas, because the reduction in energy-carrying molecules is offset by a reduction in collisions between molecules. However, at sufficiently low pressure, the distance between collisions exceeds the size of the vessel, and then the conductivity does reduce with pressure. Since the core material of a VIP is similar in thermal characteristics to materials used in conventional insulation, VIPs therefore achieve a much lower thermal conductivity (k-value) than conventional insulation, or in other words a higher thermal resistance per unit of thickness. Typically, commercially available VIPs achieve a thermal conductivity of 0.004 W/(m·K) across the centre of the panel, or an overall value of 0.006-0.008 W/(m·K) after allowing for thermal bridging (heat conduction across the panel edges) and the inevitable gradual loss of vacuum over time. Comparison to conventional insulation The thermal resistance of VIPs per unit thickness compares very favourably to conventional insulation. For instance, standard mineral wool has a thermal conductivity of 0.044 W/(m·K), and rigid polyurethane foam panels about 0.024 W/(m·K). This means that VIPs have about one-fifth the thermal conductivity of conventional insulation, and therefore about five times the thermal resistance (R-value) per unit thickness. Based on a typical k-value of 0.007 W/(m·K), the R-value of a typical VIP would be 3.5 m2·K/W (20 h·ft2·°F/BTU). To provide the same R-value, of rockwool or of rigid polyurethane foam panel would be required. However, thermal resistance per unit price is much less than conventional materials. VIPs are more difficult to manufacture than polyurethane foams or mineral wools, and strict quality control of manufacture of the membranes and sealing joins is important if a panel is to maintain its vacuum over a long period of time. Air will gradually enter the panel, and as the pressure of the panel normalizes with its surrounding air its R-value deteriorates. Conventional insulation does not depend on the evacuation of air for its thermal performance, and is therefore not susceptible to this form of deterioration. However, materials like polyurethane foam are susceptible to water absorption and performance degradation as well. In addition, VIP products cannot be cut to fit as with conventional insulation, as this would destroy the vacuum, and VIPs in non- standard sizes must be made to order, which also increases the cost. So far this high cost has generally kept VIPs out of traditional housing situations, However, their very low thermal conductivity makes them useful in situations where either strict insulation requirements or space constraints make traditional insulation impractical. VIP performance is also temperature dependent—with increasing temperature, conductive and radiative transfer increase. Furthermore, typical panels cannot operate much above due to the adhesive used to seal the thin envelope.

Map of Sheetz locations as of July 2020 (non-fuel locations in red) Sheetz, Inc. is an American chain of convenience stores and coffee shops owned by the Sheetz family. The stores sell a mix of custom food, beverages and convenience store items. Nearly all of them sell gasoline. Its headquarters are in Altoona, Pennsylvania.\\"Contact Us.\\" Sheetz. Retrieved on October 26, 2012. \\"5700 Sixth Avenue Altoona, PA 16602\\" Stores are located in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, Ohio, Virginia, and North Carolina. A few locations are full-scale truck stops, including showers and a laundromat.  History 1950s–1980s= Sheetz, Inc was founded by G. Robert \\"Bob\\" Sheetz in 1952 when he purchased one of his father's five dairy stores located in Altoona. In 1961, Bob hired his brother Steve to work part-time. In 1963 the second store was opened under the name \\"Sheetz Kwik Shopper.\\" A third store followed in 1968. In 1969, Steve became general manager. The brothers planned to expand at the rate of one store per year with a target of seven stores by 1972. In 1972, the company expanded from seven to fourteen stores. One year later, Sheetz began selling gasoline, and opened the first self-serve gas pumps in central Pennsylvania. By 1983, Bob and Steve had opened 100 stores. In 1981 Bob retired and Steve became president. =1990s= In 1995, Stanton R. \\"Stan\\" Sheetz, Bob's son, became president and Steve assumed the position of Chairman of the Board. To this day, Sheetz maintains a family business with four family members serving on the Executive Committee. During the mid-1990s, Sheetz sold It! Cola, the chain's private-label brand of soft drinks available in cans, bottles, and as fountain drinks. The drink was discontinued and the fountains were replaced with Pepsi products. The chain now has both Pepsi and Coca-Cola products in the fountains. =2000s= In September 2001, Sheetz opened a distribution center in Claysburg, Pennsylvania. In December 2004 they began offering the new Sheetz MasterCard PayPass with RFID technology, and was one of the first retailers to accept such technology, ahead of McDonald's, Arby's, CVS, and rival 7-Eleven, all of which introduced it nationally in 2006. On July 10, 2006 Sheetz became Pennsylvania's second retail chain to offer E85 ethanol-based fuel alternative at select stations. In 2008, Sheetz opened its first commissary, Sheetz Bros. Kitchen, to produce fresh sandwiches and bakery products that are sold at Sheetz locations. =2010s= Sheetz now has more than 600 locations across Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio and North Carolina, and more than 21,000 employees. All Sheetz stores are company-owned-and-operated. The company has no plans to sell franchises. Sheetz is the dominant convenience store chain in much of Pennsylvania, holding a virtual monopoly in Altoona and a commanding share in Pittsburgh (where it competes with 7-Eleven, Speedway, GetGo, and to a much lesser extent Circle K) and Harrisburg (where it primarily competes with Rutter's, as well as 7-Eleven and Speedway), but is noticeably absent from the Delaware Valley (including Philadelphia) due to the presence of Wawa, leading to a fierce \\"rivalry\\" between the two chains among Pennsylvanians, though the two companies themselves have a friendly relationship. In October 2013, Stan Sheetz became Chairman of the Board of Sheetz, with his cousin Joseph S. \\"Joe\\" Sheetz becoming president and CEO. Published in November 2013, Kenneth Womack's Made to Order: The Sheetz Story traces the company's history from its dairy-store origins through the present day. In 2014, Sheetz opened its second distribution center and kitchen facility in Burlington, North Carolina. Sales for fiscal year 2018-2019 totaled $7.5 billion. On November 29, 2019, Sheetz announced an expansion into Columbus, Ohio starting in 2021.https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10162515251000501&id;=21120170500 Currently, the major competitors in that area include Speedway, Circle K, GetGo, United Dairy Farmers, and the locally based Duchess Shoppe. On December 19, 2019, Sheetz celebrated the opening of its 600th store in Shaler Township, PA. In 2020, Sheetz discontinued selling Faygo soft drinks and replaced them with their new private-label brand, Sheetz Pop!.  Food service  In 1986, to boost lagging sales, Earl Springer, the manager of a Sheetz in Williamsport, MD, pursued a food concept that would become Sheetz's signature Made To Order (MTO) line. Beginning with only submarine sandwiches, customers would fill out a small slip of paper, designating the ingredients they wanted on their sandwich, and in what quantity. The order slip would be placed in a basket, and the kitchen staff would prepare the sub to the customer's order. Since that time, the menu expanded, and by the 1990s MTO was a sales leader for Sheetz. Beginning in 1996, the paper ordering system was phased out in favor of a picture-based touchscreen computer system.Now common at many restaurants and gas stations worldwide, Sheetz was the first company to implement this technology. By 1999, Sheetz was selling 10,000 MTO units a day. Sheetz now trains employees to function as baristas for their newest brand of \\"Sheetz Bros. Coffeez\\", which are designed to be higher-grade coffee than typically found in convenience stores. With the introduction of the \\"Convenience Restaurant\\" concept, they have expanded their menu. Customers can purchase an extremely wide variety of food items. The Espresso Bar, offering specialty coffees, is found at all locations. During 2008–2009, Sheetz rolled out \\"MTGo!\\", a grab and go assortment of sandwiches, wraps and other small items for the hurried customer. Along with \\"MTGo!\\", Sheetz unveiled \\"Shweetz Bakery\\" items including donuts, fritters and muffins made and delivered daily from the \\"Sheetz Bros. Kitchen\\" in Claysburg, Pennsylvania. Sheetz regularly offers customers free coffee on Christmas Day and New Year's Day. =Food-only stores= In 2003, Sheetz opened a concept store in the food court of Hanes Mall in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. This location offered Sheetz's made-to- order foods and fountain beverages in a more traditional fast food layout. It did not function as a convenience store. The store has since closed. In 2012, Sheetz, again, began contemplating \\"new concept\\", \\"fuel-free\\" locations. In 2014, a plan was announced to open such a location on the campus of West Virginia University, in Morgantown, WV. The intent was to call it \\"Sheetz MTO Market\\", however, when opened, in February 2015, the store was named \\"Sheetz Café\\" (although outdoor signage is the same as all other stores). In September 2015, another no-fuel café opened in State College, PA, near the campus of Penn State University. In Indiana, PA, on the border of the Indiana University of Pennsylvania campus, a Sheetz that previously carried gasoline was torn down, and replaced with a no-fuel café that opened in August 2016. A fourth such location opened in September 2017, in Charlottesville, VA, directly across the street from the campus of the University of Virginia. In September 2019, Sheetz announced they would not renew their lease with WVU for that Morgantown location. The company offered no explanation for the closure. = Alcohol sales in Pennsylvania = Until June 8, 2016 Pennsylvania state law proscribed alcohol sales in convenience stores. Beer had to be sold at a beer distributor while liquor had to be sold at state-operated stores titled \\"Wines & Spirits\\". In 2007, Sheetz tried to find a loophole around this by classifying part of one of their prototype stores in Altoona as a restaurant, which would permit alcohol sales. The Malt Beverage Distributors Association of Pennsylvania protested and Sheetz was temporarily barred from selling beer. On appeal, Sheetz was awarded the license to sell beer and continues to do so today. On June 15, 2009, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court gave Sheetz permission to sell beer for takeout under the condition that it is also available to drink on site. Sheetz successfully led the effort to change alcohol sales laws in Pennsylvania to allow sales in convenience and grocery stores, which became law when Governor Tom Wolf signed Act 39 into law on June 8, 2016. Fuel A Sheetz tanker truck ready to refill the fuel tanks The Sheetz stores that sell gasoline offer three grades of gasoline (87, 89, and 93 Octane) and diesel. An increasing number of stores also offer E85 and E15. Some stores offer kerosene at separate pumps.

History The formation of the West African Commission of the Asquith Commission on Higher Education in the Colonies\\"Establishment of The University\\" , University of Ghana. under the chairmanship of Rt. Hon. Walter Elliot was the birth of this notable institution in 1948. The commission recommended the setting up of university colleges in association with the University of London, thus the University College of the Gold Coast was founded by Ordinance on 11 August 1948 for the purpose of providing for and promoting university education, learning and research. This was made possible by the rejection of the first recommendation which stated that only one university college was feasible for the whole of British West Africa, which would be located in Nigeria by the people of Gold Coast led principally by Dr. J. B. Danquah. The University College of Gold Coast as the time became the University College of Ghana after the country attained its independence from the British colony.

In fact, it turned out to be slower than the commonly used simplex method. An interior point method, was discovered by Soviet mathematician I. I. Dikin in 1967 and reinvented in the U.S. in the mid-1980s. In 1984, Narendra Karmarkar developed a method for linear programming called Karmarkar's algorithm, which runs in provably polynomial time and is also very efficient in practice. It enabled solutions of linear programming problems that were beyond the capabilities of the simplex method. Contrary to the simplex method, it reaches a best solution by traversing the interior of the feasible region. The method can be generalized to convex programming based on a self-concordant barrier function used to encode the convex set. Any convex optimization problem can be transformed into minimizing (or maximizing) a linear function over a convex set by converting to the epigraph form. The idea of encoding the feasible set using a barrier and designing barrier methods was studied by Anthony V. Yurii Nesterov and Arkadi Nemirovski came up with a special class of such barriers that can be used to encode any convex set. They guarantee that the number of iterations of the algorithm is bounded by a polynomial in the dimension and accuracy of the solution. Karmarkar's breakthrough revitalized the study of interior-point methods and barrier problems, showing that it was possible to create an algorithm for linear programming characterized by polynomial complexity and, moreover, that was competitive with the simplex method. Already Khachiyan's ellipsoid method was a polynomial-time algorithm; however, it was too slow to be of practical interest. The class of primal-dual path-following interior- point methods is considered the most successful. Mehrotra's predictor–corrector algorithm provides the basis for most implementations of this class of methods. Primal-dual interior-point method for nonlinear optimization The primal-dual method's idea is easy to demonstrate for constrained nonlinear optimization. For simplicity, consider the all- inequality version of a nonlinear optimization problem: :minimize f(x) subject to c_i(x) \\\\ge 0 ~\\\\text{for}~ i = 1, \\\\ldots, m, ~ x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n, where f : \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}, c_i : \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\quad (1). The logarithmic barrier function associated with (1) is :B(x,\\\\mu) = f(x) - \\\\mu \\\\sum_{i=1}^m \\\\log(c_i(x)). \\\\quad (2) Here \\\\mu is a small positive scalar, sometimes called the \\"barrier parameter\\". As \\\\mu converges to zero the minimum of B(x,\\\\mu) should converge to a solution of (1). The barrier function gradient is :g_b = g - \\\\mu \\\\sum_{i=1}^m \\\\frac{1}{c_i(x)} abla c_i(x), \\\\quad (3) where g is the gradient of the original function f(x), and abla c_i is the gradient of c_i. In addition to the original (\\"primal\\") variable x we introduce a Lagrange multiplier inspired dual variable \\\\lambda \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} ^m :c_i(x) \\\\lambda_i = \\\\mu, \\\\forall i = 1, \\\\ldots, m. \\\\quad (4) (4) is sometimes called the \\"perturbed complementarity\\" condition, for its resemblance to \\"complementary slackness\\" in KKT conditions. We try to find those (x_\\\\mu, \\\\lambda_\\\\mu) for which the gradient of the barrier function is zero. Applying (4) to (3), we get an equation for the gradient: :g - A^T \\\\lambda = 0, \\\\quad (5) where the matrix A is the Jacobian of the constraints c(x). The intuition behind (5) is that the gradient of f(x) should lie in the subspace spanned by the constraints' gradients. The \\"perturbed complementarity\\" with small \\\\mu (4) can be understood as the condition that the solution should either lie near the boundary c_i(x) = 0, or that the projection of the gradient g on the constraint component c_i(x) normal should be almost zero. Applying Newton's method to (4) and (5), we get an equation for (x, \\\\lambda) update (p_x, p_\\\\lambda): :\\\\begin{pmatrix} W & -A^T  \\\\Lambda A & C \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\begin{pmatrix} p_x  p_\\\\lambda \\\\end{pmatrix}=\\\\begin{pmatrix} -g + A^T \\\\lambda  \\\\mu 1 - C \\\\lambda \\\\end{pmatrix}, where W is the Hessian matrix of B(x, \\\\mu), \\\\Lambda is a diagonal matrix of \\\\lambda, and C is a diagonal matrix with C_{ii} = c_i(x). Because of (1), (4) the condition :\\\\lambda \\\\ge 0 should be enforced at each step. This can be done by choosing appropriate \\\\alpha: :(x,\\\\lambda) \\\\to (x + \\\\alpha p_x, \\\\lambda + \\\\alpha p_\\\\lambda).Trajectory of the iterates of x by using the interior point method.

Players must successfully design golf courses and play them with their default professional golfer Gary Golf. Played in a near-isometric dimetric view, the game runs on fairly low system specs, and only at an 800x600 resolution. Overview The game features a complete system that allows the player to build their own golf empire. Players begin with some money and choose a country to begin building the players' course. Once there, players begin by placing a teeing ground and a putting green for Hole One and are then allowed to go on adding or modifying what lies between: fairways, trees, rough, bunkers (or sandtraps), landmarks, benches, paths, flowerbeds, terrain and just about anything players would normally see in a golf course. Players are advised not to waste money because if the coffers stay in the red long enough, the game is over. If players design the course well, they can manage to build an entire 18-hole course while obtaining profits. Players can also populate their course with a variety of staff, such as groundskeepers who will pull out any unsightly weeds, greeters that will talk to customers, marshalls to maintain pace of play, and drinks vendors to help golfers quench their thirst. Everything players add (or fail to) will modify the overall mood of the golfers; the main goal of the player is to make the course \\"look hard and play easy\\". Keeping them happy will allow them to invest in the players' course or donate a valuable landmark. Reward buildings, such as marinas, airstrips, and hotels, will be provided and may be used to beautify the landscape. Other facilities made available as players progress through the game include a snack bar, a putting green, a tennis court and homes to parodies of Hollywood stars or other international celebrities, such as William Robins, Bruce Springstone, Pamela Panderson, or Rosie O'Donnell. These landmarks have different properties that help the environment in some way, improving unpopular spots and otherwise calming down angry golfers (Every part of the course is rated in this way, so that players have to raise its value with fun, skill and intelligence to have customers like it). There is an \\"aura\\" overlay that displays areas that tend to generate favorable, neutral or unfavorable responses from golfers. The game also enables the player to save their professional golfer and then play championships with him to earn some extra money to further embellish or expand the course. Maxis has also set up a website where players can visit the exchange part and enter a huge archive of player-designed Championship courses for players to download and play. Further adding to its depth, golfers play in pairs and usually talk about their own interests. If players put the proper landmarks in the proper places, these stories may progress and have a happy ending, which also adds to players' course. There is also a 'sandbox' mode, which allows players to play the game with an infinite amount of money, so they can hone their designing skills. SimGolf calculates the skill rating of your course. There are three skills all golfers either have or don't have: length, accuracy, and imagination. Length is the ability to hit the ball a long way, accuracy the ability to hit the ball straight, and imagination is the ability to \\"shape\\" shots the way you want to and put spin on the ball. The skill rating of a hole is determined by the average score of people with each skill compared to the average score of people without each skill. For example, if the average score of people with length is 4, and without length is 4.5, you have a length rating of 4.25. The skill rating of your hole is the rating in all three categories added together, and the skill rating of your course is the ratings of all your holes added together. Reception The game received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. SimGolf was nominated for Computer Gaming Worlds 2002 \\"Strategy Game of the Year\\" award, which ultimately went to Freedom Force.

Originally from Chicago, United States, he moved to Japan in 1983 after visiting as a producer with the American television program Ripley's Believe It or Not!. He appears regularly as a commentator on several different Japanese television programs, including a Wednesday spot on Fuji TV's daily morning news program Tokudane!, and TBS's weekly Sunday Japon. Early life As a child, Dave Spector appeared in American TV commercials, including one for cereal manufacturer Kellogg Company. He says that he first became interested in things Japanese in the fifth grade at elementary school when he made friends with an immigrant classmate from Japan, Michael Sugano. As a gesture of friendship, he tried to speak Japanese to him by saying \\"Where is the post office?\\" in Japanese. His friend was impressed and moved by that gesture and particularly praised Dave's Japanese pronunciation. He soon became interested in Japanese manga which his friend owned. As he desired to understand Japanese manga, he began taking Japanese lessons once a week at the Japanese school his friend attended every Sunday. He stated in his autobiography that he learned 50 new Japanese words every day, eventually becoming capable of comprehending serialized Japanese manga such as Obake no Q-tarō and Ashita no Joe. He later joined Japanese weekend classes with other Japanese children, eventually becoming the class president of the graduating class. He astonished the Japanese-American community by winning the Chicago Japanese speech contest hosted by the Chicago Japanese community, the first person of non-Japanese descent to do so. The title of his speech was \\"The life and suicide of Yukio Mishima\\". Spector studied at Sophia University in Tokyo, before returning to America a year later. After returning to Chicago, he enrolled at the Institute of Broadcast Arts. Career He moved to Japan in 1983 to research exotic film clips from Japanese television to be used on the American TV show Ripley's Believe It or Not!. While this work continued until Ripley's Believe It or Not! ended in 1986, Spector became well known in Japan after becoming a regular guest on Fuji TV's lunchtime TV variety show Waratte Iitomo! in 1984, alongside other foreign personalities such as Canadian Kent Derricott, American Kent Gilbert, and Guinean . He described his work as \\"[d]oing things like the lowest Bozo, circus kind of stuff. But it doesn't bother me at all. A lot of times the foreigners on TV, models and what-not, are compared to pandas. They use that term here — pandas — because they're cuddly, you can go and have fun with them, and throw a marshmallow and that's about it. And you don't get involved any more deeper than that. But...since I'm making half a million dollars a year, I'm very happy to be a panda.\\" However, due to his fluency in Japanese, he also developed career as a serious commentator of Anglo American culture and events. He is a regular and sought after commentator on foreign news. He also established the Tokyo-based company Spector Communications in 1988, which he used to obtain clippings or video grabs from foreign media, which he used for his commentary role. He is ranked as one of the most, and in some year the most, well regarded commentator in Japan for all age group according to Oricon survey. In reference to his success in Japan, he stated that \\"I set a goal early on to be different from other gaijin tarento [foreign TV personalities] by trying to compete with Japanese rather than with other foreigners.\\" Private life Spector is married to , a native of Chiba Prefecture, whom he met in the US.

Weber is one of the sport's most active players and is known for his maverick, rebellious personality. He is also known for his high backswing and the side rotation he puts on the bowling ball. Weber is featured in the ten-pin bowling sports documentary A League of Ordinary Gentlemen. He has won 37 titles on the PBA Tour, including ten major championships, and another eleven titles (four majors) on the PBA50 Tour. He is one of only two bowlers in history (with Walter Ray Williams Jr.) to have amassed 100 total PBA titles (37 PBA Tour, 11 PBA50 Tour, 48 PBA Regional Tour, four PBA50 Regional Tour). Weber has won bowling's U.S. Open a record five times, and has also won the PBA Senior U.S. Open twice. He is a two-time PBA50 Player of the Year. Early life Weber grew up in Florissant, Missouri, and, as the son of bowling superstar Dick Weber, was introduced to the sport at the age of two. At the age of 15, Weber was already winning local bowling tournaments against adult players, and, with the help of his father, was able to join the PBA tour at the age of 17 (the former policy required a minimum age of 18). In 1979, Weber bowled in his first event on the professional circuit, and participated in 20 tour events during the 1980 season, making one televised finals appearance. Weber won Rookie of the Year honors in 1980. By 1982, he had won his first PBA title, winning two that season. By the time he was 24 years old, he had already reached the 10-title plateau (becoming the youngest player in PBA history to reach that mark).Storm Staff Bowler bios at www.stormbowling.com At age 26, he narrowly won the PBA National Championship over future Hall-of-Famer Dave Ferraro, giving him all three jewels of the PBA's \\"triple crown\\" (achieved by winning the U.S. Open, Tournament of Champions and PBA National Championship).  Achievements  PBA Tour = Weber and his father, Dick, were the first father-and-son combination to ever both earn a title on the PBA Tour.1982 Greater Hartford Open at www.pba.com The feat has since been matched three times, by Don/Jimmy Johnson (1990), Don/Eugene McCune (2002) and Guppy/Kyle Troup (2015). Weber was the youngest player to reach 10 PBA titles, accomplishing the feat in 1987 at age 24 years, 247 days. He reached the 20-title plateau in 1993, before going on the longest winless streak in his professional career between 1994 and 1996. In the 2003–04 season, Weber won two titles, including his 30th title and his third U.S. Open, and earned a career-high $206,217. On December 4, 2005, Weber overcame a year of trying times both personally and professionally by clinching what was, perhaps, the most emotional title of his career at the 2005 Bowlersparadise.com Classic at Stardust Bowl in Hammond, Indiana. This marked the first television appearance for Weber in 666 days, and it was his first title after the death of his father on February 13, 2005. Weber honored his father after the victory by looking into the ESPN cameras and pointing at the \\"DW\\" patch on his sleeve. Overall, Weber has won 37 PBA Tour events, including ten major titles (tied with Earl Anthony for the second most majors all-time). His 37th tour win on March 31, 2013 came at age 50 in the Tournament of Champions. His 37 wins places him fourth on the all-time PBA tour titles list, behind only Walter Ray Williams, Jr. (47), Earl Anthony (43) and Norm Duke (40). Weber's 35th Tour win at the end of the 2009-10 season against Mike Scroggins at the 2010 Marathon Open in the title match ensured Walter Ray Williams Jr. his record 7th Player of the Year award, as well as making Williams (then age 50) the oldest ever to win that award.

Upon winning the 2013 Tournament of Champions title, he became the first bowler to win all three jewels of the Triple Crown at least twice in a career (five U.S. Open titles, two PBA World Championship titles, and two wins in the Tournament of Champions).Vint, Bill. \\"Pete Weber Wins Barbasol PBA Tournament of Champions, Ties Anthony with 10th Major, Completes PBA Triple Crown for a Second Time\\". pba.com on March 31, 2013. He is also the oldest winner of the U.S. Open (49) and Tournament of Champions (50). The Tournament of Champions win at age 50 years, 222 days made him the oldest player to win a PBA Tour major title of any kind. His other major win was in the Touring Players Championship, which has only recently become a PBA major again. The only major that has eluded him to this point is the USBC Masters. Along with Mike Aulby, Norm Duke, and Walter Ray Williams Jr., Pete is one of only four bowlers to have won at least one standard PBA Tour title in four different decades (1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s). However, a feat that sets him apart from his contemporaries is that he's won a U.S. Open title in the same four consecutive decades, specifically in 1988, 1991, 2004, 2007, and 2012. Weber joined his father in the PBA Hall of Fame in 1998, and he became a member of the United States Bowling Congress Hall of Fame in 2002. His career PBA Tour earnings of over $4 million (through the 2019 season) place him second all-time, behind only all-time titles leader Walter Ray Williams, Jr. Weber and Williams are the only two PBA bowlers to have topped the $4 million mark in career earnings. Weber owns 48 PBA Regional titles, the most all-time, in addition to four PBA50 Regional titles.Vint, Bill. \\"Weber Continues Mastery in Illinois Valley Classic, Wins Record 46th PBA Regional Title.\\" Article at www.pba.com on July 27, 2011. Weber was ranked 4th on the PBA's 2008 list of \\"50 Greatest Players of the Last 50 Years,\\" one place behind his father. = PBA50 Tour = Weber joined the PBA50 Tour (formerly PBA Senior Tour) in 2013. His first title on that tour was a major: the 2013 USBC Senior Masters, which he won on June 14. He also won the last PBA50 Tour tournament of the season on his 51st birthday and earned Rookie of the Year honors.2013 United States Bowling Congress Senior Masters results at pba.com, retrieved June 19, 2013. Weber won a second PBA50 major title, his fourth PBA50 title overall, at the Suncoast PBA Senior U.S. Open on June 5, 2015. The win made Pete the second player in history, after Norm Duke, to win the U.S. Open on both the standard PBA Tour and the PBA50 Tour. Weber was named the PBA50 Player of the Year for the 2015 season, after dominating in the earnings, average and competition points categories. It was his first PBA Player of the Year win of any kind. On May 10, 2016, Weber won the BVL Johnny Petraglia Open on the PBA50 Tour for his third consecutive title in the 2016 season, and seventh PBA50 title overall. He joined fellow PBA Hall of Famer Tom Baker as the only players to ever win three consecutive PBA50 Tour events. In the next PBA50 Tour stop, Weber successfully defended his 2015 PBA Senior U.S. Open crown, and became the only bowler to win four consecutive PBA50 Tour events. Although the winning streak was stopped in the next tournament, Weber made history again later in the season. His victory at the 2016 USBC Senior Masters on June 26 made him the first bowler ever to win five titles in a single PBA50 Tour season. Weber's unprecedented PBA50 season continued on July 28, when he won his sixth title of 2016 in the PBA50 South Shore Open. Despite missing the last three events of the 2016 season due to a hip injury, Weber easily won his second consecutive PBA50 Player of the Year award with 457,200 points more than 200,000 above the next closest player (Amleto Monacelli with 241,680 points). Weber also averaged a PBA50 record 237.03 for the season, almost nine pins ahead of second-place Norm Duke (228.31). In the 2017 PBA50 season finale on August 8, Weber won his 11th PBA50 title, capturing the DeHayes Insurance Group Classic held in Fort Wayne, Indiana. This victory gave Weber 100 total PBA titles (37 PBA Tour, 11 PBA50 Tour, 48 PBA Regional Tour and four PBA50 Regional Tour). Walter Ray Williams Jr. is the only other bowler to reach this total. Weber is one of only three bowlers in history (with Walter Ray Williams Jr. and Tom Baker) to have won at least 10 titles on both the standard PBA Tour and the PBA50 Tour. = Other achievements = Weber claimed his first career European Bowling Tour title in 2008, in the 30th Trofeu Internacional, July 22–27, 2008, Ciutat de Barcelona at Bowling Pedralbes in Barcelona, Spain. When Pete won his first PBA title in 1982, it was the first time a father (Dick Weber) and son had each captured PBA titles. This has since happened three more times (Don and Jimmy Johnson, Don and Eugene McCune, Guppy and Kyle Troup). Weber is one of only 13 players in PBA history to start in the 24th and final spot of the match play round and go on to win a tournament. He and Mike Aulby are the only two players to accomplish this feat twice. Weber did so in 1984, and again in 1991. On ESPN's Cold Pizza he mentioned that he has made the 7-10 split four times in his career. He also noted that he is a near-scratch golfer and has six career holes-in-one. Weber won the 2013 ESPY Award for Best Bowler, defeating fellow nominees Jason Belmonte and Scott Norton.ESPY Awards 2013 Winners: Results, Recap and Top Moments Tim Keeney at bleacherreport.com on July 18, 2013. Controversy By the early 1980s, Weber had established himself as one of the best bowlers in the world, but his lifestyle saw numerous long binges of alcohol and cocaine use. In a 1985 Sports Illustrated article, Weber admitted to spending a four- week stretch on tour in a \\"complete blackout\\"—staying up for days on end with cocaine, and drinking a fifth of Jack Daniel's every night. Pete estimated he blew through about $150,000 between 1982 and 1984 on cocaine, alcohol and gambling. He entered rehab in March 1984, ending what his famous father called \\"eight years of hell\\". Though Weber says he never used cocaine again, he would fall off the wagon multiple times with drinking. Despite Weber's talent, he was not popular with his bowling peers and was even denied Player of the Year honors in 1987 despite winning the Tournament of Champions and leading the tour in earnings; the award was instead given to Marshall Holman.Marshall Holman Hall of Fame bio at www.pba.com, official website of the Professional Bowlers Association and Lumber Liquidators PBA Tour By 1989, Weber had won 13 PBA Tour titles and had reached over $1 million (USD) in earnings, but his personal life was plagued with problems. By the mid-1990s, Weber had been through two divorces. He went through a three-season stretch (1994–96) without winning a title, and he failed to make a championship round appearance during the entire 1995 season.1997 Tucson Open at www.pba.com At the same time, the PBA Tour itself was in decline and was nearing insolvency. Weber began a slow turnaround in 1997, for which he gave much of the credit to third wife Tracy. \\"Tracy is the best thing that ever happened to me,\\" he said. \\"She keeps me focused and keeps me loose.\\" Weber won two titles in the 1997 season, and established a then-career high in earnings with over $181,000. In 2000, the PBA Tour was sold to three former Microsoft executives; Weber was not on the tour during this transitional phase, as he was still serving a six-month suspension given by the former PBA leadership in 1999 due to an incident at a Michigan pro-am related to his drinking problem. The new tour ownership saw Weber's flashiness as a potential tool for marketing the PBA to a new audience. By the 2001–02 season, Weber had his career back on track, winning three titles in all. In one of the three victories, at the Great Lakes Classic in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Weber rolled a nationally televised 299 game, leaving a 4-pin standing on his final shot. In an interview during the season, Weber remarked: Weber's attitude on television has given him a reputation as a brash \\"action bowler,\\" which some critics view as unsportsmanlike. After icing the title in a televised match against Michael Haugen Jr. in the 2001 Greater Louisville Open to win 289–279, Weber walked back on the approach toward Haugen and shouted, \\"He ain't getting his first one [title] against me, no way!\\" During the 2010 Dick Weber Open he became frustrated over the sound a photographer's camera made while he was bowling, and had verbally told them to refrain from flashing the camera during his approach. In the championship match of the 2012 U.S. Open, he repeatedly confronted an audience member who he believed was intentionally distracting him on his shots. He eventually won the 2012 event, his unprecedented fifth U.S. Open title, getting a strike on the fill shot of the tenth frame to defeat Mike Fagan by one pin, 215–214. Weber exploded in a burst of rage and excitement: > Gary Thorne, (ESPN announcer): Strike to claim it, a strike to claim it, > and... HE GOT IT! Weber: YES, GOD DAMMIT, YES!!! THAT IS RIGHT, I DID IT! > [THAT'S] NUMBER FIVE, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! THAT'S RIGHT! WHO DO YOU THINK > YOU ARE, I AM! DAMMIT, RIGHT!! The video footage of Weber's reaction to his win went viral on the Internet and made the Top 10 on ESPN's \\"SportsNation 101 Celebration Fails\\" list. Weber later explained he intended to say, \\"Who do you think you are rooting against me? I am the man in this tournament!\\". Weber clarified his comments were directed towards a heckler who was jeering him throughout the tournament. After taking time to cool down, Weber was humble in his post-tournament interview, stating that although he had just surpassed his father and Don Carter in career U.S. Open titles, \\"I'll never say I'm better than them. They paved the way for us to be here. It was an honor and a privilege to join them when I won my fourth U.S. Open, and it's even more of an honor to be the first one to win five.\\"\\"St. Louis bowler Pete Weber wins record 5th U.S. Open.\\" Article at STLtoday.com on February 27, 2012.

The history of New Orleans, Louisiana, traces the city's development from its founding by the French, through its period under Spanish control, then briefly back to French rule before being acquired by the United States in the Louisiana Purchase. In the 19th century, New Orleans was the largest port in the South, exporting most of the nation's cotton output and other products to Western Europe and New England. It was the largest and most important city in the South; thus it was an early target for capture by the Union during the Civil War. With its rich and unique cultural and architectural heritage, it remains a major destination for tourism, conventions, and major sports events, even after the major destruction and loss of life resulting from Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Colonial era 1726 view of the young city of New Orleans from across the Mississippi River. The land mass that was to become the city of New Orleans was formed around 2200 BC when the Mississippi River deposited silt creating the delta region. Before Europeans founded the settlement, the area was inhabited by Native Americans for about 1300 years. The Mississippian culture peoples built mounds and earthworks in the area. Later Native Americans created a portage between the headwaters of Bayou St. John (known to the natives as Bayouk Choupique) and the Mississippi River. The bayou flowed into Lake Pontchartrain. This became an important trade route. Archaeological evidence has shown settlement here dated back to at least 400 A.D. French explorers, fur trappers and traders arrived in the area by the 1690s, some making settlements amid the Native American village of thatched huts along the Bayou. By the end of the decade, the French made an encampment called \\"Port Bayou St. Jean\\" near the head of the bayou; this would later be known as the Faubourg St. John neighborhood. The French also built a small fort, \\"St. Jean\\" (known to later generations of New Orleanians as \\"Old Spanish Fort\\") at the mouth of the bayou in 1701, using as a base a large Native American shell midden dating back to the Marksville culture. In 1708, land grants along the Bayou were given to French settlers from Mobile, but the majority left within the next two years due to the failure of attempts to grow wheat there. These early European settlements are now within the limits of the city of New Orleans, though predating the city's official founding. New Orleans was founded in early 1718 by the French as La Nouvelle-Orléans, under the direction of Louisiana governor Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville. After considering several alternatives, Bienville selected the site for several strategic reasons and practical considerations, including: it was relatively high ground, along a sharp bend of the flood-prone Mississippi River, which thus created a natural levee (previously chosen as the site of an abandoned Quinipissa village); it was adjacent to the trading route and portage between the Mississippi and Lake Pontchartrain via Bayou St. John, offering access to the Gulf of Mexico port of Biloxi without going downriver 100 miles; and it offered control of the entire Mississippi River Valley, at a safe distance from Spanish and English colonial settlements. From its founding, the French intended New Orleans to be an important colonial city. The city was named in honor of the then Regent of France, Philip II, Duke of Orléans. The regent allowed Scottish economist John Law to create a private bank and a financing scheme that succeeded in increasing the colonial population of New Orleans and other areas of Louisiana. The scheme, however, created an investment bubble that burst at the end of 1720. Law's Mississippi Company collapsed, stopping the flow of investment money to New Orleans. Nonetheless, in 1722, New Orleans was made the capital of French Louisiana, replacing Biloxi in that role. The priest-chronicler Pierre François Xavier de Charlevoix described New Orleans in 1721 as a place of a hundred wretched hovels in a malarious wet thicket of willows and dwarf palmettos, infested by serpents and alligators; he seems to have been the first, however, to predict for it an imperial future. In September 1722, a hurricane struck the city, blowing most of the structures down. After this, the administrators enforced the grid pattern dictated by Bienville but hitherto previously mostly ignored by the colonists. This grid plan is still seen today in the streets of the city's \\"French Quarter\\" (see map). Plan de La Nouvelle-Orléans Capitale de la Louisiane, 1728. Jackson Square) along the Fleuve St. Louis (Mississippi River). Much of the colonial population in early days was of the wildest and, in part, of the most undesirable character: deported galley slaves, trappers, gold-hunters; the colonial governors' letters were full of complaints regarding the riffraff sent as soldiers as late as Kerlerec's administration (1753–1763). Two large lakes (in reality estuaries) in the vicinity, Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas, commemorate respectively Louis Phelypeaux, Count Pontchartrain, minister and chancellor of France, and Jean Frederic Phelypeaux, Count Maurepas, minister and secretary of state. A third body of water, Lake Borgne, was originally a land-locked inlet of the sea; its name has reference to its incomplete or defective character. =Spanish interregnum= In 1763 following Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War, the French colony west of the Mississippi River—plus New Orleans—was ceded to the Spanish Empire as a secret provision of the 1762 Treaty of Fontainebleau, confirmed the following year in the Treaty of Paris. This was to compensate Spain for the loss of Florida to the British, who also took the remainder of the formerly French territory east of the River. No Spanish governor came to take control until 1766. French and German settlers, hoping to restore New Orleans to French control, forced the Spanish governor to flee to Spain in the bloodless Rebellion of 1768. A year later, the Spanish reasserted control, executing five ringleaders and sending five plotters to a prison in Cuba, and formally instituting Spanish law. Other members of the rebellion were forgiven as long as they pledged loyalty to Spain. Although a Spanish governor was in New Orleans, it was under the jurisdiction of the Spanish garrison in Cuba. In the final third of the Spanish period, two massive fires burned the great majority of the city's buildings. The Great New Orleans Fire of 1788 destroyed 856 buildings in the city on Good Friday, March 21 of that year.Cindy Ermus, \\"Reduced to Ashes: The Good Friday Fire of 1788 in Spanish Colonial New Orleans,\\" Louisiana History 54 (Summer 2013), 292–331. In December 1794 another fire destroyed 212 buildings. After the fires, the city was rebuilt with bricks, replacing the simpler wooden buildings constructed in the early colonial period. Much of the 18th-century architecture still present in the French Quarter was built during this time, including three of the most impressive structures in New Orleans-- St. Louis Cathedral, the Cabildo and the Presbytere. The architectural character of the French Quarter, including multi-storied buildings centered around inner courtyards, large arched doorways, and the use of decorative wrought iron, were ubiquitous in parts of Spain and the Spanish colonies, although precedents in French colonial and even Anglo-colonial America exist. Spanish influence on the urban landscape in New Orleans may be attributed to the fact that the period of Spanish rule saw a great deal of immigration from all over the Atlantic, including Spain and the Canary Islands, and the Spanish colonies. In 1795 and 1796, the sugar processing industry was first put upon a firm basis. The last twenty years of the 18th century were especially characterized by the growth of commerce on the Mississippi, and the development of those international interests, commercial and political, of which New Orleans was the center. Within the city, the Carondelet Canal, connecting the back of the city along the river levee with Lake Pontchartrain via Bayou St. John, opened in 1794, which was a boost to commerce. Through Pinckney's Treaty signed on October 27, 1795, Spain granted the United States \\"Right of Deposit\\" in New Orleans, allowing Americans to use the city's port facilities. =Retrocession to France and Louisiana Purchase= In 1800 Spain and France signed the secret Treaty of San Ildefonso stipulating that Spain give Louisiana back to France, although it had to remain under Spanish control as long as France wished to postpone the transfer of power. There was another relevant treaty in 1801, the Treaty of Aranjuez, and later a royal bill issued by King Charles IV of Spain in 1802; these confirmed and finalized the retrocession of Spanish Louisiana to France. In April 1803, Napoleon sold Louisiana (New France) (which then included portions of more than a dozen present-day states) to the U.S. in the Louisiana Purchase. A French prefect, Pierre Clément de Laussat, who had only arrived in New Orleans on March 23, 1803, formally took control of Louisiana for France on November 30, only to hand it over to the U.S. on December 20, 1803. In the meantime he created New Orleans' first city council, abolishing the Spanish cabildo. 19th century Marigny Plantation House, by J. L. Bouquet de Woiseri In 1805, a census showed a heterogeneous population of 8,500, comprising 3,551 whites, 1,556 free blacks, and 3,105 slaves. Observers at the time and historians since believe there was an undercount and the true population was about 10,000. =Early 19th century: a rapidly growing commercial center= Historic house along Bayou St. John, home of the second mayor of the American city of New Orleans The next dozen years were marked by the beginnings of self- government in city and state; by the excitement attending the Aaron Burr conspiracy (in the course of which, in 1806–1807, General James Wilkinson practically put New Orleans under martial law); and by the War of 1812. From early days the city was noted for its cosmopolitan polyglot population and mixture of cultures. It grew rapidly, with influxes of Americans, African, French and Creole French (people of French descent born in the Americas) and Creoles of color (people of mixed European and African ancestry), many of the latter two groups fleeing from the violent revolution in Haiti. The Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) in the former French colony of Saint-Domingue established the second republic in the Western Hemisphere and the first led by blacks. Refugees, both white and free people of color (affranchis or gens de couleur libres), arrived in New Orleans, often bringing slaves with them.Rebecca J. Scott, \\"Paper Thin: Freedom and Re-enslavement in the Diaspora of the Haitian Revolution,\\" Law & History Review (2011) 29#4 pp 1061-1087 While Governor Claiborne and other officials wanted to keep out additional free black men, French Creoles wanted to increase the French-speaking population. As more refugees were allowed into the Territory of Orleans, Haitian émigrés who had gone to Cuba also arrived. Nearly 90 percent of the new immigrants settled in New Orleans. The 1809 migration brought 2,731 whites; 3,102 free persons of African descent; and 3,226 additional enslaved individuals to the city, doubling its French-speaking population.In Motion: African American Migration Experience - Haitian Immigration: 18th & 19th Centuries, NY Public Library], accessed 7 May 2008 An 1809-1810 migration brought thousands of white francophone refugees (deported by officials in Cuba in response to Bonapartist schemes in Spain).Jay Gitlin, The Bourgeois Frontier: French towns, French traders, and American expansion (Yale UP, 2009) p. 54 Plantation slaves' rebellion The Haitian Revolution also increased ideas of resistance among the slave population in the vicinity of New Orleans. Early in 1811, hundreds of slaves revolted in what became known as the German Coast Uprising. The revolt occurred on the east bank of the Mississippi River in St. John the Baptist and St. Charles Parishes, Territory of Orleans.Adam Rothman, Slave Country: American Expansion and the Origins of the Deep South, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2005, p. 106 While the slave insurgency was the largest in U.S. history, the rebels killed only two white men. Confrontations with militia and executions after locally-held tribunals killed ninety-five black people. Between 64 and 125 enslaved men marched from sugar plantations near present-day LaPlace on the German Coast toward the city of New Orleans. They collected more men along the way. Some accounts claimed a total of 200 to 500 slaves participated. During their two- day, twenty-mile march, the men burned five plantation houses (three completely), several sugar houses (small sugar cane mills), and crops. They were armed mostly with hand tools.\\"'American Rising': When Slaves Attacked New Orleans\\". NPR. 2011-01-16. Retrieved 2011-01-16. White men led by officials of the territory formed militia companies to hunt down and kill the insurgents, backed up by the United States Army under the command of Brigadier General Wade Hampton I, a slave owner himself, and by the United States Navy under Commodore John Shaw. Over the next two weeks, white planters and officials interrogated, sentenced, and carried out summary executions of an additional 44 insurgents who had been captured. The tribunals were held in three locations, in the two parishes involved and in Orleans Parish (New Orleans). Executions were by hanging, decapitation, or firing squad (St. Charles Parish). Whites displayed the bodies as a warning to intimidate the enslaved. The heads of some were put on pikes and displayed along the River Road and at the Place d'Armes in New Orleans. Since 1995 the African American History Alliance of Louisiana has led an annual commemoration in January of the uprising, in which they have been joined by some descendants of participants in the revolt.James W. Lowen, Lies Across America: What Our History Sites Get Wrong, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2007, p. 192 War of 1812 During the War of 1812, the British sent a large force to conquer the city, but they were defeated early in 1815 by Andrew Jackson's combined forces some miles downriver from the city at Chalmette's plantation, during the Battle of New Orleans. The American government managed to obtain early information of the enterprise and prepared to meet it with forces (regular, militia, and naval) under the command of Maj. Gen. Andrew Jackson. Privateers led by Jean Lafitte were also recruited for the battle. The British advance was made by way of Lake Borgne, and the troops landed at a fisherman's village on December 23, 1814, Major-General Sir Edward Pakenham taking command there two days later (Christmas). An immediate advance on the still insufficiently-prepared defenses of the Americans might have led to the capture of the city; but this was not attempted, and both sides limited themselves to relatively small skirmishes and a naval battle while awaiting reinforcements. At last in the early morning of January 8, 1815 (after the Treaty of Ghent had been signed but before the news had reached across the Atlantic), a direct attack was made on the now strongly-entrenched line of defenders at Chalmette, near the Mississippi River. It failed disastrously with a loss of 2,000 out of 9,000 British troops engaged, among the dead being Pakenham and Major-General Gibbs. The expedition was soon afterwards abandoned and the troops embarked, under the command of John Lambert. Another engagement followed: a ten-day artillery battle at Fort St. Philip on the lower Mississippi River. The British fleet set sail on January 18 and went on to capture Fort Bowyer at the entrance to Mobile Bay. General Jackson had arrived in New Orleans in early December 1814, having marched overland from Mobile in the Mississippi Territory. His final departure was not until mid-March 1815. Martial law was maintained in the city throughout the period of three and a half months.Remini, Robert V. (1999), The Battle of New Orleans. Antebellum New Orleans The population of the city doubled in the 1830s with an influx of settlers. A few newcomers to the city were friends of the Marquis de Lafayette who had settled in the newly founded city of Tallahassee, Florida, but due to legalities had lost their deeds. One new settler who was not displaced but chose to move to New Orleans to practice law was Prince Achille Murat, nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte. According to historian Paul Lachance, \\"the addition of white immigrants to the white creole population enabled French-speakers to remain a majority of the white population until almost 1830. If a substantial proportion of free persons of color and slaves had not also spoken French, however, the Gallic community would have become a minority of the total population as early as 1820.\\"Quoted in The Bourgeois Frontier : French towns, French traders, and American expansion by Jay Gitlin. Yale University Press. pg 159 Large numbers of German and Irish immigrants began arriving at this time. The population of the city doubled in the 1830s and by 1840 New Orleans had become the wealthiest and third-most populous city in the nation.Lewis, Peirce F., New Orleans: The Making of an Urban Landscape, Santa Fe, 2003, p.175 By 1840, the city's population was approximately 102,000 and it was now the third-largest in the U.S, the largest city away from the Atlantic seaboard as well as the largest in the South. New Orleans lithograph from 1852 The introduction of natural gas (about 1830); the building of the Pontchartrain Rail-Road (1830-31), one of the earliest in the United States; the introduction of the first steam-powered cotton press (1832), and the beginning of the public school system (1840) marked these years; foreign exports more than doubled in the period 1831–1833. In 1838 the commercially-important New Basin Canal opened a shipping route from the Lake to uptown New Orleans. Travelers in this decade have left pictures of the animation of the river trade more congested in those days of river boats, steamers, and ocean-sailing craft than today; of the institution of slavery, the quadroon balls, the medley of Latin tongues, the disorder and carousing of the river-men and adventurers that filled the city. Altogether there was much of the wildness of a frontier town, and a seemingly boundless promise of prosperity. The crisis of 1837, indeed, was severely felt, but did not greatly retard the city's advancement, which continued unchecked until the Civil War. In 1849 Baton Rouge replaced New Orleans as the capital of the state. In 1850 telegraphic communication was established with St. Louis and New York City; in 1851 the New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern railway, the first railway outlet northward, later part of the Illinois Central, and in 1854 the western outlet, now the Southern Pacific, were begun. In 1836 the city was divided into three municipalities: the first being the French Quarter and Faubourg Tremé, the second being Uptown (then meaning all settled areas upriver from Canal Street), and the third being Downtown (the rest of the city from Esplanade Avenue on, downriver). For two decades the three Municipalities were essentially governed as separate cities, with the office of Mayor of New Orleans having only a minor role in facilitating discussions between municipal governments. Pilfering Molasses, 1853 painting by George Henry Hall The importance of New Orleans as a commercial center was reinforced when the United States Federal Government established a branch of the United States Mint there in 1838, along with two other Southern branch mints at Charlotte, North Carolina, and Dahlonega, Georgia. Although there was an existing coin shortage, the situation became much worse because in 1836 President Andrew Jackson had issued an executive order, called a specie circular, which demanded that all land transactions in the United States be conducted in cash, thus increasing the need for minted money. In contrast to the other two Southern branch mints, which only minted gold coins, the New Orleans Mint produced both gold and silver coinage, which perhaps marked it as the most important branch mint in the country. The mint produced coins from 1838 until 1861, when Confederate forces occupied the building and used it briefly as their own coinage facility until it was recaptured by Union forces the following year. On May 3, 1849, a Mississippi River levee breach upriver from the city (around modern River Ridge, Louisiana) created the worst flooding the city had ever seen. The flood, known as at Sauvé's Crevasse, left 12,000 people homeless. While New Orleans has experienced numerous floods large and small in its history, the flood of 1849 was of a more disastrous scale than any save the flooding after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. New Orleans has not experienced flooding from the Mississippi River since Sauvé's Crevasse, although it came dangerously close during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. =The Civil War= View in Canal Street, New Orleans, 1857 Panoramic View of New Orleans-Federal Fleet at Anchor in the River, c. 1862. Early in the American Civil War New Orleans was captured by the Union without a battle in the city itself, and hence was spared the destruction suffered by many other cities of the American South. It retains a historical flavor with a wealth of 19th century structures far beyond the early colonial city boundaries of the French Quarter. The political and commercial importance of New Orleans, as well as its strategic position, marked it out as the objective of a Union expedition soon after the opening of the Civil War. Elements of the Union Blockade fleet arrived at the mouth of the Mississippi on 27 May 1861. An effort to drive them off lead to the Battle of the Head of Passes on 12 October 1861. Captain D.G. Farragut and the Western Gulf squadron sailed for New Orleans in January 1862. The main defenses of the Mississippi consisted of the two permanent forts, Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip. On April 16, after elaborate reconnaissances, the Union fleet steamed up into position below the forts and opened fire two days later. Within days, the fleet had bypassed the forts in what was known as the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip. At noon on the 25th, Farragut anchored in front of New Orleans. Forts Jackson and St. Philip, isolated and continuously bombarded by Farragut's mortar boats, surrendered on the 28th, and soon afterwards the military portion of the expedition occupied the city resulting in the Capture of New Orleans.Hearn, Capture of New Orleans, 1862, pp. 32-237. The commander, General Benjamin Butler, subjected New Orleans to a rigorous martial law so tactlessly administered as greatly to intensify the hostility of South and North. Butler's administration did have benefits to the city, which was kept both orderly and due to his massive cleanup efforts unusually healthy by 19th century standards. Towards the end of the war General Nathaniel Banks held the command at New Orleans.Hearn, Capture of New Orleans, 1862, pp. 245,266-7. =Late 19th century: Reconstruction and conflict= Victor Pierson, Paul Poincy. Volunteer Firemen's Parade, March 4, 1872, representing the gathering of the New Orleans fire brigades around the statue of Henry Clay. The city again served as capital of Louisiana from 1865 to 1880. Throughout the years of the Civil War and the Reconstruction period the history of the city is inseparable from that of the state. All the constitutional conventions were held here, the seat of government again was here (in 1864–1882) and New Orleans was the center of dispute and organization in the struggle between political and ethnic blocks for the control of government. Louisiana State Lottery drawing from 1887, showing schoolchildren who would presumably benefit from the purchase of lottery tickets. There was a major street riot of July 30, 1866, at the time of the meeting of the radical constitutional convention. Businessman Charles T. Howard began the Louisiana State Lottery Company in an arrangement which involved bribing state legislators and governors for permission to operate the highly lucrative outfit, as well as legal manipulations that at one point interfered with the passing of one version of the state constitution.Berthold Alwes, The History of the Louisiana State Lottery Company (1944). New Orleans Mardi Gras in the early 1890s. During Reconstruction, New Orleans was within the Fifth Military District of the United States. Louisiana was readmitted to the Union in 1868, and its Constitution of 1868 granted universal manhood suffrage. Both blacks and whites were elected to local and state offices. In 1872, then-lieutenant governor P.B.S. Pinchback succeeded Henry Clay Warmouth as governor of Louisiana, becoming the first non-white governor of a U.S. state, and the last African American to lead a U.S. state until Douglas Wilder's election in Virginia, 117 years later. In New Orleans, Reconstruction was marked by the Mechanics Institute race riot (1866). The city operated successfully a racially integrated public school system. Damage to levees and cities along the Mississippi River adversely affected southern crops and trade for the port city for some time, as the government tried to restore infrastructure. The nationwide Panic of 1873 also slowed economic recovery. In the 1850s white Francophones had remained an intact and vibrant community, maintaining instruction in French in two of the city's four school districts.The Bourgeois Frontier: French towns, French traders, and American expansion by Jay Gitlin. Yale University Press. pg 166 As the Creole elite feared, during the war, their world changed. In 1862, the Union general Ben Butler abolished French instruction in schools, and statewide measures in 1864 and 1868 further cemented the policy.Gitlin, The Bourgeois Frontier, p. 166 By the end of the 19th century, French usage in the city had faded significantly.Gitlin, The Bourgeois Frontier, p. 180 New Orleans annexed the city of Algiers, Louisiana, across the Mississippi River, in 1870. The city also continued to expand upriver, annexing the town of Carrollton, Louisiana in 1874. On September 14, 1874 armed forces led by the White League defeated the integrated Republican metropolitan police and their allies in pitched battle in the French Quarter and along Canal Street. The White League forced the temporary flight of the William P. Kellogg government, installing John McEnery as Governor of Louisiana. Kellogg and the Republican administration were reinstated in power 3 days later by United States troops. Early 20th century segregationists would celebrate the short-lived triumph of the White League as a victory for \\"white supremacy\\" and dubbed the conflict \\"The Battle of Liberty Place\\". A monument commemorating the event was built near the foot of Canal Street, to the side of the Aquarium near the trolley tracks. This monument was removed on April 24, 2017. The removal fell on the same day that three states—Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia—observed what's known as Confederate Memorial Day. U.S. troops also blocked the White League Democrats in January 1875, after they had wrested from the Republicans the organization of the state legislature. Nevertheless, the revolution of 1874 is generally regarded as the independence day of Reconstruction, although not until President Hayes withdrew the troops in 1877 and the Packard government fell did the Democrats actually hold control of the state and city. The financial condition of the city when the whites gained control was very bad. The tax-rate had risen in 1873 to 3%. The city defaulted in 1874. On the interest of its bonded debt, it later refunded this ($22,000,000 in 1875) at a lower rate, to decrease the annual charge from $1,416,000 to $307,500. The New Orleans Mint was reopened in 1879, minting mainly silver coinage, including the famed Morgan silver dollar from 1879 to 1904. Gretna. The city suffered flooding in 1882. The city hosted the 1884 World's Fair, called the World Cotton Centennial. A financial failure, the event is notable as the beginnings of the city's tourist economy. An electric lighting system was introduced to the city in 1886; limited use of electric lights in a few areas of town had preceded this by a few years. =1890s= On October 15, 1890, Chief-of-Police David C. Hennessy was shot, and reportedly his dying words informed a colleague that he was shot by \\"Dagos\\", an insulting term for Italians. On March 13, 1891, a group of Italian Americans on trial for the shooting were acquitted. However, a mob stormed the jail and lynched eleven Italian-Americans. Local historians still debate whether some of those lynched were connected to the Mafia, but most agree that a number of innocent people were lynched during the Chief Hennessy Riot. The government of Italy protested, as some of those lynched were still Italian citizens, and the government of the U.S. eventually paid reparations to Italy.John V. Baiamonte, \\"'Who Killa de Chief' Revisited: The Hennessey Assassination and Its Aftermath, 1890-1991.\\" Louisiana History (1992): 117-146. in JSTOR In the 1890s much of the city's public transportation system, hitherto relying on mule-drawn streetcars on most routes supplemented by a few steam locomotives on longer routes, was electrified. With a relatively large educated black (including a self- described \\"Creole\\" or mixed-race) population that had long interacted with the white population, racial attitudes were comparatively liberal for the Deep South. For example there was the 1892 New Orleans general strike that began on November 8, 1892. But, like other southern cities and towns, African Americans were barred from a range of employment possibilities, including police officers, and firefighters. No black child was allowed an education at a public high school in the city. From hotels, parks, museums and restaurants, black citizens were denied access through a rigid system of Jim Crow, but some in the city objected to the State of Louisiana's attempt to enforce strict racial segregation, and hoped to overturn the law with a test case in 1892. The case found its way to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1896 as Plessy v. Ferguson. This resulted in upholding segregation, which would be enforced with ever-growing strictness for more than half a century. In 1892, the New Orleans political machine, \\"the Ring,\\" won a sweeping victory over the incumbent reformers. John Fitzpatrick, leader of the working class Irish, became mayor.Brian Gary Ettinger, \\"John Fitzpatrick and the Limits of Working-Class Politics in New Orleans, 1892-1896.\\" Louisiana History (1985): 341-367. in JSTOR In 1896 Mayor Fitzpatrick proposed combining existing library resources to create the city's first free public library, the Fisk Free and Public Library. This entity later became known as the New Orleans Public Library. In the spring of 1896 Mayor Fitzpatrick, leader of the city's Bourbon Democratic organization, left office after a scandal-ridden administration, his chosen successor badly defeated by reform candidate Walter C. Flower. But Fitzpatrick and his associates quickly regrouped, organizing themselves on 29 December into the Choctaw Club, which soon received considerable patronage from Louisiana governor and Fitzpatrick ally Murphy Foster. Fitzpatrick, a power at the 1898 Louisiana Constitutional Convention, was instrumental in exempting immigrants from the new educational and property requirements designed to disenfranchise blacks. In 1899 he managed the successful mayoral campaign of Bourbon candidate Paul Capdevielle.Edward F. Haas, \\"John Fitzpatrick and Political Continuity in New Orleans, 1896-1899,\\" Louisiana History 1981 22(1): 7-29 In 1897 the quasi-legal red light district called Storyville opened and soon became a famous attraction of the city. The Robert Charles Riots occurred in July 1900. Well-armed African-American Robert Charles held off a group of policemen who came to arrest him for days, killing several of them. A White mob started a race riot, terrorizing and killing a number of African Americans unconnected with Charles. The riots were stopped when a group of White businessmen quickly printed and nailed up flyers saying that if the rioting continued they would start passing out firearms to the black population for their self-defense. Epidemics The population of New Orleans and other settlements in south Louisiana suffered from epidemics of yellow fever, malaria, cholera, and smallpox, beginning in the late 18th century and periodically throughout the 19th century. Doctors did not understand how the diseases were transmitted; primitive sanitation and lack of a public water system contributed to public health problems, as did the highly transient population of sailors and immigrants. The city successfully suppressed a final outbreak of yellow fever in 1905. (See below, 20th century.) Progressive era drainage Until the early 20th century, construction was largely limited to the slightly higher ground along old natural river levees and bayous; the largest section of this being near the Mississippi River front. This gave the 19th-century city the shape of a crescent along a bend of the Mississippi, the origin of the nickname The Crescent City. Between the developed higher ground near the Mississippi and the shores of Lake Pontchartrain, most of the area was wetlands only slightly above the level of Lake Pontchartrain and sea level. This area was commonly referred to as the \\"back swamp,\\" or areas of cypress groves as \\"the back woods.\\" While there had been some use of this land for cow pasture and agriculture, the land was subject to frequent flooding, making what would otherwise be valuable land on the edge of a growing city unsuitable for development. The levees protecting the city from high water events on the Mississippi and Lake compounded this problem, as they also kept rainwater in, which tended to concentrate in the lower areas. 19th century steam pumps were set up on canals to push the water out, but these early efforts proved inadequate to the task. Following studies begun by the Drainage Advisory Board and the Sewerage and Water Board of New Orleans in the 1890s, in the 1900s and 1910s engineer and inventor A. Baldwin Wood enacted his ambitious plan to drain the city, including large pumps of his own design that are still used when heavy rains hit the city. Wood's pumps and drainage allowed the city to expand greatly in area. It only became clear decades later that the problem of subsidence had been underestimated. Much of the land in what had been the old back swamp has continued to slowly sink, and many of the neighborhoods developed after 1900 are now below sea level. 20th century Child labor at Lane Cotton Mill, 1913. Photo by Lewis Hine. New Orleans panorama from 1919 In the early part of the 20th century the Francophone character of the city was still much in evidence, with one 1902 report describing \\"one-fourth of the population of the city speaks French in ordinary daily intercourse, while another two-fourths is able to understand the language perfectly.\\"Madame Vieux Carré: the French Quarter in the Twentieth Century by Scott S. Ellis. University of Mississippi: 2010. pg 8 As late as 1945, one still encountered elderly Creole women who spoke no English.Gumbo Ya-Ya: Folk Tales of Louisiana by Robert Tallant & Lyle Saxon. Louisiana Library Commission: 1945, p. 178 The last major French language newspaper in New Orleans, L'Abeille de la Nouvelle-Orléans, ceased publication on December 27, 1923, after ninety-six years;French, Cajun, Creole, Houma: A Primer on Francophone Louisiana by Carl A. Brasseaux Louisiana State University Press, 2005. pg 32 according to some sources Le Courrier de la Nouvelle Orleans continued until 1955.New Orleans City Guide. The Federal Writers' Project of the Works Progress Administration: 1938 pg 90 In 1905, yellow fever was reported in the city, which had suffered under repeated epidemics of the disease in the previous century. As the role of mosquitoes in spreading the disease was newly understood, the city embarked on a massive campaign to drain, screen, or oil all cisterns and standing water (breeding ground for mosquitoes) in the city and educate the public on their vital role in preventing mosquitoes. The effort was a success and the disease was stopped before reaching epidemic proportions. President Theodore Roosevelt visited the city to demonstrate the safety of New Orleans. It has had no cases of Yellow Fever since. In 1909, the New Orleans Mint ceased coinage, with active coining equipment shipped to Philadelphia. New Orleans was hit by major storms in the 1909 Atlantic hurricane season and again in the 1915 Atlantic hurricane season. In 1917 the Department of the Navy ordered the Storyville District closed, over the opposition of Mayor Martin Behrman. Financial district, 1920s In 1923 the Industrial Canal opened, providing a direct shipping link between Lake Pontchartrain and the Mississippi River. In the 1920s an effort to \\"modernize\\" the look of the city removed the old cast-iron balconies from Canal Street, the city's commercial hub. In the 1960s another \\"modernization\\" effort replaced the Canal Streetcar Line with buses. Both of these moves came to be regarded as mistakes long after the fact, and the streetcars returned to a portion of Canal Street at the end of the 1990s, and construction to restore the entire line was completed in April 2004. The city's river levees narrowly escaped being topped in the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. In 1927 a project was begun to fill in the shoreline of Lake Pontchartrain and create levees along the lake side of the city. Previously areas along the lakefront like Milneburg were built up on stilts, often over water of the constantly shifting shallow shores of the Lake. There have often been tensions between the city, with its desire to run its own affairs, and the government of the State of Louisiana wishing to control the city. Perhaps the situation was never worse than in the early 1930s between Louisiana Gov. Huey P. Long and New Orleans Mayor T. Semmes Walmsley, when armed city police and state troopers faced off at the Orleans Parish line and armed conflict was only narrowly avoided. During World War II, New Orleans was the site of the development and construction of Higgins boats under the direction of Andrew Higgins. General Dwight D. Eisenhower proclaimed these landing craft vital to the Allied victory in the war. The suburbs saw great growth in the second half of the 20th century, and it was only in the post-World War II period that a truly metropolitan New Orleans comprising the New Orleans center city and surrounding suburbs developed. The largest suburb today is Metairie, an unincorporated subdivision of Jefferson Parish that borders New Orleans to the west. In a somewhat different postwar developmental pattern than that experienced by other older American cities, New Orleans' center city population grew for the first two decades after the war. This was due to the city's ability to accommodate large amounts of new, suburban-style development within the existing city limits, in such neighborhoods as Lakeview, Gentilly, Algiers and New Orleans East. Unlike some other municipalities, notably many in Texas, New Orleans is unable to annex adjacent suburban development. Mayor DeLesseps \\"Chep\\" Morrison was elected as a reform candidate in 1946. He served as mayor of New Orleans until 1961, shaping the city's post-World War II trajectory. His energetic administration accomplished much and received considerable national acclaim. By the end of his mayoralty, however, his political fortunes were dwindling, and he failed to effectively respond to the growing Civil Rights Movement. The 1947 Fort Lauderdale Hurricane hit the city in September 1947. The levees & pumping system succeeded in protecting the city proper from major flooding, but many areas of the new suburbs in Jefferson Parish were deluged, and Moisant Airport was shut down under of water. View of flooding after Hurricane Betsy as viewed from President Lyndon Johnson's Air Force One airplane, September 10, 1965 In January 1961 a meeting of the city's white business leaders publicly endorsed desegregation of the city's public schools. That same year Victor H. Schiro became the city's first mayor of Italian-American ancestry. In 1965 the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal (\\"MR GO\\", pronounced mister go) was completed, connecting the Intracoastal Waterway with the Gulf of Mexico. The Canal was expected to be an economic boom that would eventually lead to the replacement of the Mississippi Riverfront as the metro area's main commercial harbor. \\"MR GO\\" failed to live up to commercial expectations, and from its early days it was blamed for freshwater marsh-killing saltwater intrusion and coastal erosion, increasing the area's risk of hurricane storm surge. In September 1965 the city was hit by Hurricane Betsy. Windows blew out of television station WWL while it was broadcasting. In an effort to prevent panic, mayor Vic Schiro memorably told TV and radio audiences \\"Don't believe any false rumors, unless you hear them from me.\\" A breach in the Industrial Canal produced catastrophic flooding of the city's Lower 9th Ward as well as the neighboring towns of Arabi and Chalmette in St. Bernard parish. President Lyndon Johnson quickly flew to the city to promise federal aid. In 1978, City Councilman Ernest N. Morial became the first person of African-American ancestry to be elected mayor of New Orleans. While long one of the United States' most visited cities, tourism boomed in the last quarter of the 20th century, becoming a major force in the local economy. Areas of the French Quarter and Central Business District, which were long oriented towards local residential and business uses, increasingly catered to the tourist industry. A century after the Cotton Centennial Exhibition, New Orleans hosted another World's Fair, the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition. In 1986, Sidney Barthelemy was elected mayor of the Crescent City; he was re-elected in spring of 1990, serving two terms. In 1994 and 1998, Marc Morial, the son of \\"Dutch\\" Morial, was elected to two consecutive terms as mayor. A view across Uptown New Orleans, with the Central Business District in the background, August 1991 The city experienced severe flooding in the May 8, 1995, Louisiana Flood when heavy rains suddenly dumped over a foot of water on parts of town faster than the pumps could remove the water. Water filled up the streets, especially in lower-lying parts of the city. Insurance companies declared more automobiles totaled than in any other U.S. incident up to that time. (See May 8th 1995 Louisiana Flood.) On the afternoon of Saturday, December 14, 1996, the M/V Bright Field freightliner/bulk cargo vessel slammed into the Riverwalk mall and hotel complex on the Poydras Street Wharf along the Mississippi River. Amazingly, nobody died in the accident, although about 66 were injured. Fifteen shops and 456 hotel rooms were demolished. The freightliner was unable to be removed from the crash site until January 6, 1997, by which time the site had become something of a \\"must-see\\" tourist attraction. 21st century In May 2002, businessman Ray Nagin was elected mayor. A former cable television executive, Nagin was unaligned with any of the city's traditional political blocks, and many voters were attracted to his pledges to fight corruption and run the city on a more business-like basis. In 2014 Nagin was convicted on charges that he had taken more than $500,000 in payouts from businessmen in exchange for millions of dollars' worth of city contracts. He received a 10-year sentence.See Washington Post July 9, 2014 On April 14, 2003, the 2003 John McDonogh High School shooting occurred at John McDonogh High School. =Hurricane Katrina= On August 29, 2005, an estimated 600,000 people were temporarily evacuated from Greater New Orleans when projected tracks of Hurricane Katrina included a possible major hit of the city. It missed, although Katrina wreaked considerable havoc on the Gulf Coast east of Louisiana. An aerial view of flooded areas of Central City and Central Business District, with the New Orleans Arena and the damaged Louisiana Superdome at center. The city suffered from the effects of a major hurricane on and after August 29, 2005, as Hurricane Katrina made landfall in the gulf coast near the city. In the aftermath of the storm, what has been called \\"the largest civil engineering disaster in the history of the United States\\" flooded the majority of the city when the levee and floodwall system protecting New Orleans failed.Marshall, Bob. \\"17th Street Canal levee was doomed .\\" Times-Picayune. November 30, 2005. On August 26, tracks which had previously indicated the hurricane was heading towards the Florida Panhandle shifted westward, initially centering on Gulfport/Biloxi, Mississippi and later shifted further westward to the Mississippi/Louisiana state line. The city became aware that a major hurricane hit was possible and issued voluntary evacuations on Saturday, August 27. Interstate 10 in New Orleans East and Jefferson and St. Charles parishes was converted to all-outbound lanes heading out of the city as well as Interstates 55 and 59 in the surrounding area, a maneuver known as \\"contraflow.\\" In the Gulf of Mexico, Katrina continued to gain strength as it turned northwest, then north towards southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi. On the morning of Sunday, August 28, Katrina was upgraded to a top-notched Category 5 hurricane. Around 10 am, Mayor Nagin issued a mandatory evacuation of the entire city, the first such order ever issued in the city's history. An estimated 1 million people evacuated from Greater New Orleans and nearby areas before the storm. However, some 20% of New Orleans residents were still in the city when the storm hit. This included people who refused to leave home, those who felt their homes were adequate shelter from the storm, and people without cars or without financial means to leave. Some took refuge in the Superdome, which was designated as a \\"shelter of last resort\\" for those who could not leave. The eye of the storm missed the heart of the city by only 20–30 miles, and strong winds ravaged the city, shattering windows, spreading debris in many areas, and bringing heavy rains and flooding to many areas of the city. The situation worsened when levees on four of the city's canals were breached. Storm surge was funneled in via the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, which breached in multiple places. This surge also filled the Industrial Canal which breached either from the surge or the effects of being hit by a loose barge (the ING 4727). The London Avenue Canal and the 17th Street Canal were breached by the elevated waters of Lake Pontchartrain. Some areas that initially seemed to suffer little from the storm found themselves flooded by rapidly rising water on August 30. As much as 80% of the city—parts of which are below sea level and much of which is only a few feet above—was flooded, with water reaching a depth of 25 feet (7.6 m) in some areas. Water levels were similar to those of the 1909 hurricane; but since many areas that were swamp or farmland in 1909 had become heavily settled, the effects were massively worse. The most recent estimates of the damage from the storm, by several insurance companies, are $10 to 25 billion,Westbrook, Jesse. \\"Katrina Claims May Rival $16 Bln Northridge Quake (Update11) .\\" Bloomberg L.P. August 29, 2005. while the total economic loss from the disaster has been estimated at $100 billion. Hurricane Katrina surpassed Hurricane Andrew as the costliest hurricane in United States history. The final death toll of Hurricane Katrina was 1,836 lives lost, primarily from Louisiana (1,577). Half of these were senior citizens. On September 22, already devastated by Hurricane Katrina, the Industrial Canal in New Orleans was again flooded by Hurricane Rita as the recently-and-hurriedly- repaired levees were breached once more. Residents of Cameron Parish, Calcasieu Parish, and parts of Jefferson Davis Parish, Acadia Parish, Iberia Parish, Beauregard Parish, and Vermillion Parish were told to evacuate ahead of the storm. Cameron Parish was hit the hardest with the towns of Creole, Cameron, Grand Chenier, Johnson Bayou, and Holly Beach being totally demolished. Records around the Hackberry area show that wind gusts reached over 180 mph at a boat tied up to a dock. The people were told to be evacuated by Thursday, September 22, 2005 by 6:00 pm. Two days later, parish officials returned to the Gibbstown Bridge that crosses the Intracoastal Canal into Lower Cameron Parish. No one was known to be left in the parish as of that time on Thursday, September 22, 2005. It only became clear with investigations in the months after Katrina that flooding in the majority of the city was not directly due to the storm being more powerful than the city's defenses. Rather, it was caused by what investigators termed \\"the costliest engineering mistake in American history\\". The United States Army Corps of Engineers designed the levee and floodwall system incorrectly, and contractors failed to build the system in places to the requirements of the Corps of Engineers' contracts. The Orleans Levee Board made only minimal perfunctory efforts in their assigned task of inspecting the city's vital defenses. Legal investigations of criminal negligence are pending. = Since 2005 = While many residents and businesses returned to the task of rebuilding the city, the effects of the hurricane on the economy and demographics of the city are expected to be dramatic and long term. As of March 2006, more than half of New Orleanians had yet to return to the city, and there were doubts as to how many more would. By 2008, estimated repopulation had topped 330,000. The New Orleans Saints won Super Bowl XLIV in the 2009 NFL season, bringing hope and joy to the city still recovering from Hurricane Katrina. In 2010 Louisiana Lieutenant Governor Mitch Landrieu won the mayor's race over ten other candidates with some 66% of the vote on the first round, with widespread support across racial, demographic, and neighborhood boundaries. The 2017 New Orleans tornado touched down in New Orleans East and left approximately 10,000 homes without electric power. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency. In 2018 LaToya Cantrell took office as Mayor of New Orleans, the first woman to do so. On the morning of October 12, 2019, a portion of the Hard Rock Hotel building at 1031 Canal Street collapsed during construction.

Its product range includes life assurance and pensions. The company has been providing financial services to the UK market since 1815. The company sells products through independent financial advisers, direct to customers and through Lloyds Banking Group bank branches. The well-known investment and asset management arm (Scottish Widows Investment Partnership) was sold in 2013 to Aberdeen Asset Management. History Scottish Widows Headquarters, Morrison Street, Edinburgh In March 1812, a number of prominent Scotsmen gathered in the Royal Exchange Coffee Rooms in Edinburgh. They were there to discuss setting up 'a general fund for securing provisions to widows, sisters and other female relatives' of fundholders so that they would not be plunged into poverty on the death of the fundholder during and after the Napoleonic Wars. Scottish Widows' Fund and Life Assurance Society opened in 1815 as Scotland's first mutual life office. Its most noteworthy leader was Very Rev James Grant who served as its Director for 50 years (1840-1890). In 1999, Lloyds TSB agreed to buy the society for £7 billion. The society demutualised on 3 March 2000 as part of the acquisition. At the time of its takeover, Scottish Widows set up an \\"additional account\\" to hold £1.7 billion of the proceeds from the sale. This fund was to be used to enhance terminal bonuses across the company, but was eventually used to compensate guaranteed annuity rate options (GARs) holders. In April 2009, Lloyds Banking Group announced that the sales team of Clerical Medical would be merged into that of Scottish Widows, and the Clerical Medical brand would eventually be phased out. In November 2013, Lloyds Banking Group sold its asset management division, Scottish Widows Investment Partnership (SWIP) to Aberdeen Asset Management in a £660m deal. In 2015, Scottish Widows sold Clerical Medical's Isle of Man operations to international life assurance company RL360°. Advertising Scottish widows advert from 1878 The Scottish Widow first appeared in a television advert directed by David Bailey in 1986.

Known as \\"Thommo\\", he is considered by many in the sport to be the fastest bowler of his generation. He was the opening partner of fellow fast bowler Dennis Lillee; their combination was one of the most fearsome in Test cricket history. Commenting on their bowling during the 1974–75 season, Wisden wrote: \\"... it was easy to believe they were the fastest pair ever to have coincided in a cricket team\\". He was inducted into the Australian Hall of Fame by the CA in 2016.  Speed and technique  Thomson had an unusual but highly effective slinging delivery action that he learned from his father. In December 1975, after the second test match against the West Indies at the WACA, he was timed with a release speed of 160.45 km/h using highly accurate, high-speed Photo- Sonics cameras. The study was carried out by Tom Penrose and Brian Blanksby of the University of Western Australia, and Daryl Foster of the Secondary Teachers' College in Perth. Measurements were also made of three other fast bowlers, Dennis Lillee, Andy Roberts and Michael Holding, and the study is described in Dennis Lillee's book, The Art of Fast Bowling. Thomson's fastest delivery was significantly quicker than the next fastest bowler, Andy Roberts, whose fastest delivery was measured at 150.67 km/h. Another interesting finding from the study was the run-up speed of the bowlers. Thomson approached at 18.02 km/h, significantly slower than Holding (28.10 km/h), Roberts (28.78 km/h) and Lillee (33.57 km/h). When Thomson bowled one of his 160 km/h deliveries it is calculated that the ball took a mere 0.438 seconds from leaving the bowler's hand to reaching the bat. Studies have shown that it takes about 0.30 seconds for a batsman to see the ball, predict its path and decide on a stroke, and a further 0.30 seconds to perform the stroke. This suggests that a batsman would need to start his reaction time 0.162 seconds before Thomson released the ball, or start to play the stroke before knowing where the ball would pitch. In 1979, Thomson won a fastest bowling competition held by the Australian television station Channel 9, in a year in which he was banned from playing professional cricket. His maximum speed was measured at 147.9 km/h using the same method as employed during the 1975 study at the WACA. He also came top for accuracy in the competition. Many cricketers, experts and viewers who have watched cricket from at least the 1970s rate Thomson as the fastest they have ever seen. Richie Benaud rated Thomson as the fastest he had seen since Frank Tyson. Australian wicket-keeper Rod Marsh kept wicket to Thomson for most of his Test career and has claimed that Thomson bowled upwards of 180 km/h. Ian Chappell and Ashley Mallett have also opined the same. Many of the players of the 1970s and 1980s generation also rate Thomson as the fastest they ever faced or even saw. West Indian batting legend Viv Richards rate Thomson as the fastest he has ever faced. Richards' opinion counts for a lot, as he faced almost all the fastest bowlers of all time through the 1970s and 1980s in John Snow, Dennis Lillee, Andy Roberts, Imran Khan, Michael Holding, Sylvester Clarke, Wayne Daniel, Malcolm Marshall, Patrick Patterson, Alan Ward, Len Pascoe, Garth Le Roux, Graham Dilley etc., and Devon Malcolm and Waqar Younis in the early 1990s, at various levels, in International matches, the WSC, and the Caribbean, Australian and England County leagues. Indian batting great Sunil Gavaskar also reckons Thomson was the fastest he faced over a career spanning over 20 years. Former West Indies captain Clive Lloyd regards Thomson as the fastest bowler he has ever seen. Michael Holding, himself often considered an extremely fast bowler in his prime, believes Thomson to be the fastest he ever saw. Geoffrey Boycott rates Thomson joint fastest with Michael Holding among all the bowlers that he has seen. Martin Crowe, who was one of the leading international batsmen from 1982 to 1995, rated Thomson and Michael Holding as the hardest bowlers to pick \\"Thomson was just a freak – a very unique action. You never really saw it.\\" Incidents were reported of Thomson delivering byes which hit the sight-screen behind the facing batsman on the full, after just one bounce on the pitch. These reports were mostly from the time when he was at his very fastest – the period between 1972 and 1976, long before boundary ropes began to be pulled in (which happened around 1990) – though several instances are cited when this happened even after his injury, till the early 1980s. Jeff has stated some of his fastest spells include, a spell against the West Indies in Barbados during World Series Cricket, which he has stated he was unhappy during the series because the West Indies had their full team and strike bowlers and the Australia team was depleted because of the World Series Cricket series. And after several West Indian players had hit Australian batsman, he has been quoted saying he Wanted to return the favour. He also mentions a spell against Victoria playing for Queensland at the Gabba in Brisbane, in which he took 7 wickets for the match.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UWb4wsH9v0 In the 1990s Thomson was the bowling coach for Queensland. In 1992, after a practice session bowling in the nets to several of the Queensland batsmen, including Allan Border, Thomson was encouraged to play for the team as, even at the age of 42, he was still faster than any of the Queensland bowlers. Only the youth policy of the team prevented him from rejoining the side to play competitively. Thomson came to the fore in 1974–75 with 33 wickets in the Ashes series. Helmets and the other modern protective items for batsmen were not available at the time, and there were no restrictions on the use of the bouncer. The success of the Australian cricket team with fast bowling prompted an era when pace bowling dominated the game, at the expense of slow bowling. According to Ian Healy: While he was known for his speed, his side-on and javelin-like approach also aids in keeping the ball hidden from the batsman for as long as possible, even as bowling speed decreases with age. Career1972–73: Test Debut= Thomson enjoyed a rapid rise in the 1972–73 season. He made his first-class debut for New South Wales (NSW) in October 1972 against WA, replacing David Colley who was injured. He also took 5–97 for NSW Colts against Qld Colts. Test Debut After playing five first class games and taking 17 wickets, Thomson was a surprise selection in for the second test against Pakistan. He replaced Bob Massie, who was picked in the first test side. It was felt Thomson's selection was an experimental one with a view to the West Indies tour at the end of the summer. \\"I will try my guts out,\\" said Thomson. \\"I was just hoping that I might pick up some more wickets in the forthcoming matches against Victoria so that they might think of me for the West Indies.\\" Against Pakistan at the MCG, Thomson returned match figures of 0/110. Later, he was diagnosed as having played with a broken bone in his foot, the pain from which he kept concealed from selectors and teammates. He bowled waywardly and was not picked to tour the West Indies. =1973–74= Following this, he disappeared from first-class cricket until the final match of the 1973–74 season against Queensland. (Although he did bowl for NSW Colts over the summer.) Thomson took nine wickets in the game, helping to prevent Queensland from winning the Shield. Queensland captain Greg Chappell convinced Thomson to move to Queensland for the following season, which he did, playing for Toombul District Cricket Club in the local Brisbane competition. =1974–75: Test stardom= A graph showing Thomson's test career bowling statistics and how they varied over time When Thomson was selected for the first Test of the 1974–75 Ashes series, the English players had seen him in action only once, during a tour match against Queensland when Thomson bowled well within himself on the instruction of his captain Greg Chappell. He created controversy during a television interview before the Test when he said, \\"I enjoy hitting a batsman more than getting him out. I like to see blood on the pitch\\". In the second innings of the match, he bowled Australia to victory with a spell of 6/46. At Perth, he injured several batsmen and finished off the game with 5/93 in the second innings as Australia recorded another victory. During the 1974–75 Ashes series, Sydney newspaper The Sunday Telegraph ran a photo of Lillee and Thomson with a cartoon caption underneath that read: Taking a relatively short run up to the crease, Thomson generated his pace with a slinging-style bowling action, clearly influenced by his former competitive javelin throwing, that began to accelerate the ball from a lower position than is typical. He did not put a lot of work on the ball with his fingers, so he did not seam or swing the ball much and he adopted an uncomplicated approach to his work. He once described his bowling as, \\"I just roll up and go whang\\". Although he regularly bowled the bouncer, it was his ability to make the ball rise sharply from a length that earned him many wickets. The hard Australian pitches suited his style as he relied on bounce rather than movement to take wickets. John Benaud describes facing Thomson in a Sydney grade match: > So Thommo begins – the high stepping gait of a thoroughbred, bowling hand > bobbing at waist level and the ball visible. It is conventional and > comforting because facing a strange bowler for the first time invariably > generates edginess. Then, in the split second before delivery, at gather, > Thommo drags one leg behind the other in a sort of Swan Lake crossover, > sways back and hides the ball behind his right knee – unconventional and > very unsettling. Forming an intimidating bowling partnership with Dennis Lillee, Thomson captured 33 wickets in the series and looked to set to beat Arthur Mailey's record of 36 Test wickets in an Australian test season. However, he injured his shoulder playing a social tennis match during the rest day of the fifth Test at Adelaide and missed the rest of the summer. Australia's eventual winning margin was 4–1. =1975 Tour of England= He was less at home on the slower wickets of England on the tour that followed and took only four wickets in five matches during the inaugural World Cup. In the subsequent four-Test series, he snared 16 wickets at 28.56. In the first Test at Edgbaston, he hit 49 from 67 balls and bagged 5/38 in England's second innings as Australia claimed the only decisive result of the series, which enabled them to retain the Ashes. At this time, Thomson hired a manager, David Lord, who negotiated a contract with the Brisbane radio station 4IP, reputedly worth A$63,000 per year for ten years. =1975–76 vs West Indies= In the 1975–76 series against the West Indies, he took 29 wickets in the six Tests. He conceded a lot of runs but often induced the West Indies batsmen to play injudicious shots. Wisden thought his bowling had improved from the previous Australian season. =1976–77: Collision= A severe injury resulted from an on-field collision with teammate Alan Turner as they both attempted a catch in the first Test match against Pakistan at Adelaide on Christmas Eve, 1976. A dislocation of his right collarbone forced him to miss the remainder of the season. =1977 Ashes= Although he returned to Test cricket during the 1977 Ashes series in England, he was never as consistently fast again. Lillee missed the tour because of back problems, and Thomson responded as the spearhead of the attack by taking 23 wickets at 25.34 average. Australia's performance was said to suffer by the revelation that most of the team had signed to play World Series Cricket (WSC) in opposition to official cricket, although skipper Greg Chappell concedes his side would have been beaten anyway. =1977–78 vs India= Thomson's relationship with WSC was complex. He did not hesitate to sign on, but his manager pointed out that his contract with 4IP required him to be available for Queensland. Lord extricated him from the WSC contract (along with the West Indian Alvin Kallicharan), prompting Kerry Packer to obtain an injunction preventing Lord (or any other third party) from inducing players to break their WSC agreements. In the rebuilt Australian Test team of 1977–78, Thomson was the senior player after the recalled veteran, captain Bob Simpson. In the first Test against India at Brisbane, Thomson contributed seven wickets and 41 not out towards an Australian victory. During the second Test at Perth, he claimed six wickets and finished the series with 22 wickets at an average of 23.45. Australia had a narrow 3–2 win that helped the ACB maintain its optimism that it could win the war with WSC. Thomson, meanwhile, had success at domestic level, taking 6/18 in his only Gillette Cup appearance, against South Australia in Brisbane, which was enough to be voted man-of-the-series, winning him a prize of two return tickets to Fiji.Australian Cricket, \\"People\\", March 1979, p. 5. =1978 Tour of the West Indies= Simpson lobbied for Thomson's appointment as vice-captain of the team to tour the West Indies. Thomson produced his fastest spell since his comeback in the second Test at Bridgetown, Barbados, when he knocked off Viv Richards' cap and finished with 6/77. However, his bowling fell away in the later Tests. =1978–79 \\"Retirement\\"= During the winter, Thomson expressed a desire to join his teammates playing WSC, which paid for a court challenge to his contract. The ACB had a rare victory over WSC when the judge ruled against the proposed move, and criticised Thomson's business acumen. Thomson played a single limited-overs match for Queensland, taking 6/18, and then in September \\"retired\\" from Test cricket from 30 September onwards. He said he would remain available for Sheffield Shield. =1979 Tour of the West Indies= As part of the negotiations for the peace treaty between the two organisations, the ACB agreed to let Thomson play in WSC's tour of the Caribbean in the spring of 1979. Reunited with Lillee, he returned 16 wickets in five \\"Supertests\\", including 5/78 at Trinidad. =1979–80= The reunion of the partnership for Test cricket was less successful. A number of fast bowlers had enjoyed success for Australia during Thomson's absence from the team, yet the selectors were keen to see Lillee and Thomson attempt to reprise their success of the mid-1970s. However, Thomson managed only two Tests in 1979–80 when he was dropped. He played four ODIs in the first World Series Cup, but bowled erratically in two-day/night matches against England at the SCG that confirmed his unsuitability to limited-overs cricket. Thereafter, injuries contributed to his absence from the team. =1981= Overlooked for the 1981 Ashes tour of England, he decided to spend the season with Middlesex in the hope that he might be needed as a late replacement in the Australian team, but he got injured.\\"Coming down to London at the end of June [1981], I was resigned to a spell in Middlesex Seconds... Instead, the day after getting back I was summoned to the first team at Trent Bridge because Thomson had suffered a hernia. As it turned out, he wasn't to play again that summer.\\" Simon Hughes, A Lot of Hard Yakka, 1997 =1981–82= Thomson reclaimed his place in 1981–82 when he played eight of the nine Tests against Pakistan and the West Indies (in Australia) and in New Zealand. His figures were pedestrian: 20 wickets at 36.4, with a best of 4/51. However, he found a regular place in the ODI team and took 19 wickets (at 27.42 average) in 13 matches during the World Series Cup. =1982 Tour of Pakistan= On the tour of Pakistan later in the year, he took just three wickets in three Tests. =1982–83: More success against England= Dropped for the first Test at home against England, Thomson owed his recall to a knee injury suffered by Lillee. In the remaining four Tests, he enjoyed success in taking 22 wickets at 18.68. At times, he reached top pace, claiming 5/73 at Brisbane, and 5/50 at Sydney in the fifth Test, his last in Australia. His performance in the World Series Cup, 19 wickets in 13 matches with an RPO of 4.01, was his best in an ODI tournament. =1985 Ashes= Continuing with Queensland as captain, Thomson was chosen for the 1985 tour of England. The rebel tours to South Africa had stripped the Australian team of pace bowlers. In the first Test, his match figures were 2/174 and he was omitted until the fifth Test, when he scored 28 not out in the first innings, his highest Test score since 1977. His only wicket was Graham Gooch, giving him 200 Test wickets.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/122523183 =1985–86= Thomson never represented Australia again, he did however help Queensland reach the Sheffield Shield final in his last season of first-class cricket in 1985–86https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/118106959 but they missed out to NSW. =1992= Thomson while coaching Queensland 6 years after retiring almost made a comeback at the age of 42, however the selectors opted to continue with their youth policy. On 27 January 2016 Thomson was inducted in the Australian hall of fame ReferencesExternal links * Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Australia One Day International cricketers Category:Australia Test cricketers Category:Australian cricket commentators Category:Cricketers at the 1975 Cricket World Cup Category:Cricketers at the 1983 Cricket World Cup Category:World Series Cricket players Category:Middlesex cricketers Category:New South Wales cricketers Category:Queensland cricketers Category:Wisden Leading Cricketers in the World Category:Australian cricketers Category:Australian Cricket Hall of Fame inductees Category:Queensland cricket captains ","title":"Jeff Thomson"},{"id":"1622950","text":"Brikama is one of the largest cities in the Gambia, also called as 'SATEY BA' by the locals meaning big Settlement, lying south of the country's capital, Banjul.

It is known for its botanical gardens, its crocodile pool Bakau Kachikally and for the beaches at Cape Point. Bakau is the first major suburb outside Banjul and the most developed town in the Gambia. Close to Bakau and Banjul is Gambia's largest city, Serekunda.  History  Legend has it that Bakau grew up around the holy crocodile pool in Kachikally, the central district of Bakau. Bakau itself was a small village at the turn of the 19th century and grew in importance as it became a favourite place for private residences of colonial administrators, especially along the beautiful palm fringed beaches. Despite being a major town, the old village still exists and is run like any other in the Gambia, with an 'Alkali' (similar to 'Mayor') and divided into Kabilos. There exists a much smaller village within the old village called Bakau Wasulung Kunda, indicating the migrant origins of its inhabitants. As people began to move out of Banjul, government allocated residential areas quickly sprang around the old village, acquiring new names in the process. What were farms of the local population became well planned suburbs filled with bungalows, such as Fajara, New Town, Cape Point, Mile7 and Farrowkono (formerly used as gardens by the locals)  Economy  Bakau fish market Tourism is the most important business activity in Bakau providing a lot of employment, as well as income for the municipal authority.

Comprises numerous ethnic groups: the Punjabis, Saraikis, Pothwaris, Kashmiris, Sindhis, Muhajirs, Makrani in the south; Baloch, Hazaras and Pashtuns in the west; and the Dards, Wakhi, Baltis, Shinaki and Burusho communities in the north. The culture of these Pakistani ethnic groups have been greatly influenced by many of its neighbours, such as the other South Asian, Iranic, Turkic as well as the peoples of Central Asia and West Asia. The region has formed a distinct unit within the main geographical complex of Indian subcontinent, the Middle East and Central Asia from the earliest times, and is analogous to the intermediary position of Afghanistan.Basham, A.L. (1968), Pacific Affairs, University of British Columbia, 641-643 There are differences among the ethnic groups in cultural aspects such as dress, food, and religion, especially where pre-Islamic customs differ from Islamic practices. Their cultural origins also reveal influences from far afield and indigenous, including ancient India and Central Asia. Pakistan was the first region of the Indian subcontinent to be fully impacted by Islam and has thus developed a distinct Islamic identity, historically different from areas further east. Literature Muhammad Iqbal was the ideological father of Pakistan Pakistani literature originates from when Pakistan gained its independence as a sovereign state in 1947. The common and shared tradition of Urdu literature and English literature of Greater India was inherited by the new state. Over a period of time, a body of literature unique to Pakistan emerged, written in the major languages, including Urdu, English, Punjabi, Pashto, Seraiki, Balochi, and Sindhi. Poetry Poetry is a highly respected art and profession in Pakistan. The pre-eminent form of poetry in Pakistan almost always originates in Persian, due in part to the long-standing affiliation and heavy admiration the region's rulers once had for certain aspects of foreign Persian culture. The enthusiasm for poetry exists at a regional level as well, with nearly all of Pakistan's provincial languages continuing the legacy. Since the independence of the country in 1947 and establishment of Urdu as the national language, poetry is written in that language as well. The Urdu language has a rich tradition of poetry and includes the famous poets Muhammad Iqbal (national poet), Mir Taqi Mir, Ghalib, Faiz Ahmad Faiz, Ahmad Faraz, Habib Jalib, Jazib Qureshi, and Ahmad Nadeem Qasmi. Apart from Urdu poetry, Pakistani poetry also has blends of other regional languages. Balochi, Sindhi, Punjabi, Seraiki, and Pashto poetry have all incorporated and influenced Pakistani poetry. Performing artsMusic= A sitar workshop in Islamabad, Pakistan. The variety of Pakistani music ranges from diverse provincial folk music and traditional styles such as Qawwali which is played by men clapping, singing and playing drums and Ghazal Gayaki to modern forms fusing traditional and Western music. Pakistan is home to many famous folk singers such as the late Alam Lohar, who is also well known in Indian Punjab. The arrival of Afghan refugees in the western provinces has rekindled Dari music and established Peshawar as a hub for Afghan musicians and a distribution center for Afghani music abroad. =Dances= Kathak The origin of Kathak is traditionally attributed to the traveling bards of ancient northern India known as Kathakars or storytellers.[2] The term Kathak is derived from the Vedic Sanskrit word Katha which means \\"story\\", and Kathakar which means \\"the one who tells a story\\", or \\"to do with stories\\". Other dances of Pakistan includes: Punjab * Bhangra - Punjab * Luddi - Punjab * Sammi - Punjab * Jhumar - Saraiki, and Balochi folk dance Balochistan * Lewa - Baluch folk dance from Makran region * Chap - Baluch folk dance performed at weddings * Jhumar - Saraiki, and Balochi folk dance * Attan - Pashtun traditional dance from northern regions of Balochistan. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa * Attan - Folk dance of Pashtuns tribes of Pakistan including the unique styles of Quetta and Waziristan * Khattak Dance - sword dance of Khattak tribe in Khyber- Pakhtunkhwa * Jhumar and Gatka - Popular dance of hazara division Khyber- Pakhtunkhwa * Chitrali Dance - Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa * Kumbar - folk dance of Hazara Sindh * Dhammal - Performed at Sufi shrines/ dargahs in Punjab and Sindh * Ho Jamalo - Sindhi dance * Jhumro =Drama and theatre= These are very similar to stage plays in theatres. They are performed by well-known actors and actresses in the Lollywood industry. The dramas and plays often deal with themes from everyday life, often with a humorous touch. Visual artsPainting= Anarkali, by Abdur Rahman Chughtai During the 16th to 18th centuries, Mughal painting developed, heavily influenced by Persian miniatures. Abdul Rehman Chughtai, Sughra Rababi, Ustad Allah Baksh, Aboo B. Rana, Ajaz Anwar, Ismail Gulgee, Jamil Naqsh, Ahmed Pervez, and Sadequain are prominent and outstanding creative painters of Pakistan. Pakistani vehicle art is a popular folk art. =Architecture= The Lahore Fort, a landmark built during the Mughal era, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site The architecture of the areas now constituting Pakistan can be traced to four distinct periods: pre- Islamic, Islamic, colonial, and post-colonial. With the beginning of the Indus civilization around the middle of the 3rd millenniumDehejia, Vidja South Asian Art and Culture. The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved on 10 February 2008 B.C., an advanced urban culture developed for the first time in the region, with large structural facilities, some of which survive to this day.The Indus Valley And The Genesis Of South Asian Civilization Retrieved on 6 February 2008 Mohenjo Daro, Harappa and Kot Diji belong to the pre-Islamic era settlements. The rise of Buddhism, Guptas, Mouryas, and the Persian and Greek influence led to the development of the Greco-Buddhist style, starting from the 1st century CE. The high point of this era was reached with the culmination of the Gandhara style. An example of Buddhist architecture is the ruins of the Buddhist monastery Takht-i-Bahi in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. The arrival of Islam in today's Pakistan introduced the classical Islamic construction techniques into Pakistan's architectural landscape.Architecture in Pakistan: A Historical Overview . _All Things Pakistan_. Retrieved on 10 February 2008 However, a smooth transition to predominantly picture-less Islamic architecture occurred. The town of Uch Sharif contains the tombs of Bibi Jawindi, Baha'is-Halim, and Jalaluddin Bukhari, which are considered some of the earliest examples of Islamic architecture in Pakistan and are on the UNESCO Tentative World Heritage Site list since 2004.UNESCO World Heritage State Parties Pakistan Retrieved 9 July 2010. One of the most important of the few examples of the Persian style of architecture is the tomb of the Shah Rukn-i-Alam in Multan. During the Mughal era, design elements of Islamic- Persian architecture were fused with, and often produced playful forms of, local art, resulting in the establishment of Mughal Architecture. Lahore, occasional residence of Mughal rulers, exhibits a multiplicity of important buildings from the empire, among them the Badshahi mosque, the fortress of Lahore with the famous Alamgiri Gate, the colourful, still strongly Mughal- influenced Wazir Khan Mosque as well as numerous other mosques and mausoleums. The Shahjahan Mosque of Thatta in Sindh also originates from the epoch of the Mughals, as does the Mohabbat Khan Mosque in Peshawar. In the British colonial age, the buildings developed were predominantly of European styles such as gothic, baroque and neoclassical. The Indo-Saracenic style, with a mixture of European and Indian-Islamic components, also developed during this period. Post-colonial national identity is expressed in modern structures like the Faisal Mosque, Pakistan Monument, the Minar-e-Pakistan and the Mazar-e-Quaid. Recreation and sports The official national sport of Pakistan is field hockey, but cricket and football are the most popular sports. The Pakistan national field hockey team has won the Hockey World Cup a record four times, 1971, 1978, 1982 and 1994. The Pakistan national cricket team won the Cricket World Cup in 1992, were runners-up in 1999, and co-hosted the games in 1987 and 1996. They also won the ICC World Twenty20 in 2009 and were runners-up in 2007. The team also won the Austral-Asia Cup in 1986, 1990, and 1994. In 2017, Pakistan won the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy against their rival India. The women's team is yet to win a world cup. At the international level, Pakistan has competed many times at the Summer Olympics in field hockey, boxing, athletics, swimming, and shooting. Hockey is the sport in which Pakistan has been most successful at the Olympics, winning three gold medals (1960, 1968, and 1984). World Hockey , International Hockey Federation Pakistan has hosted several international competitions, including the South Asian Federation Games in 1989 and 2004. A1 Grand Prix racing is also becoming popular with the entry of a Pakistani team in the 2005 season. The Tour de Pakistan, modeled on the Tour de France, is an annual cycling competition that covers the length and breadth of Pakistan. Recently, football has grown in popularity across the country, where traditionally it had been played almost exclusively in the western province of Balochistan. FIFA has recently teamed up with the government to bring football closer to the northern areas. Cuisine Seekh kebab - one of the famous Pakistani food specialities Culinary art in Pakistan is mainly a mix of Indian cuisines with Middle Eastern, Central Asian and Afghan influence. There are variations of cooking practices across the country, mostly from spicy in Punjab and Sindh to steamed and boiled in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. Urban centers of the country offer an amalgamation of recipes from all parts of the country, while food with specific local ingredients and tastes is available in rural areas and villages. Different specialties exist throughout the country mostly different type of rice like Biryani, Pulao or Boiled rice with vegetables and meat are used with Korma and desserts. There are also local forms of grilled meat or kebabs, Kheer desserts, and a variety of hot and cold drinks. =Tea culture= A traditional cup of black tea An example of Pakistani masala chai. The consumption of tea in Pakistan, where it is called chai (), its name in Urdu, is of central significance to Pakistani culture. It is one of the most consumed beverages in Pakistani cuisine. Pakistan does produce its own limited tea in Chinkiari (KP) farms, however it ranks as the third largest importer of tea in the world. In 2003, as much as 109,000 tonnes of tea were consumed in Pakistan, ranking it at seven on the list of tea-consuming countries in the world. While green tea has been an ancient tradition in Pakistan for thousands of years, black tea was originally introduced and popularized during the colonial British era in South Asia. Cities such as Lahore had one of the most vibrant tea cultures, as the drink quickly absorbed into local culture. The shield on the State emblem of Pakistan notably features a tea crop in one of its quarters. Tea is usually consumed at breakfast, during lunch breaks at the workplace, and in the evening at home. Evening tea may be consumed with typically something sweet such as biscuits or cake but can also be served with a savory snack such as samosas, depending on the amount of time one has. Guests are typically offered a choice between tea and soft drinks. It is common practice for homeowners to offer tea breaks to hired labour, and sometimes even provide them with tea during the breaks. Tea offered to labour is typically strong and has more sugar in it. High teas are common at hotels and restaurants, and are usually buffet-style meals with light snacks. Tea making techniques vary from home to home, and person to person, but tea is typically made from loose tea leaves and steeped for a couple of minutes before serving. A teapot and tea cosy may be used, if time permits, or tea may be steeped directly in the kettle off the heat. After steeping, the tea is poured into cups through a strainer. Milk may be added before or after the tea, but sugar is typically offered separately so that each individual may add sugar according to his or her own taste. Teabags are usually reserved for when time constraints do not enable one to prepare tea from loose tea leaves. Tea served is typically black, with milk, although green tea is becoming increasingly popular. While black tea is very rarely consumed without milk, green tea is never served with milk. Most of the tea consumed in Pakistan is imported from Kenya. After 1995, the Pakistani government began to implement a tea plantation project, which established green tea estates in Pakistan and achieved good performance. Varieties Different regions throughout the country have their own different flavors and varieties, giving Pakistani tea culture a diverse blend. In Karachi, the Black tea and Masala chai (Spiced tea) are popular while the thick and milky Doodh Pati Chai is more preferred in Punjab. Biscuits and paan are common delicacies and staples enjoyed with tea. In the northern and western parts of the country, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and much of Kashmir, the popular green tea called \\"kahwah\\" is predominant. In Kashmir, Kashmiri chai or \\"Noon Chai\\", a pink, milky tea with pistachios and cardamom, is consumed primarily at special occasions, weddings, and during the winter months when it is sold in many kiosks. In the further north Chitral and Gilgit-Baltistan regions, Central Asian variants such as salty buttered Tibetan style tea are consumed. In popular culture * Pakistani tea was praised by Abhinandan Varthaman, an Indian Airforce Pilot who was shot down by Pakistan Air Force and captured by Pakistan Army for violating Line of Control during 2019 India–Pakistan border skirmishes. In a video released by ISPR, Wing Commander Abhinandan is seen conversing with Pakistan military officials in a congenial environment and acknowledging that he has been treated well while enjoying Pakistani Tea. Upon being asked about the tea, Abhinandan replied \\"The tea is fantastic\\". This became a catchphrase in Pakistan as customers began using it to order tea (and by way of mocking Indian aggression against Pakistan). * The name for Three Cups of Tea, a bestselling book by American mountaineer and educator Greg Mortenson, is taken from the Balti proverb in northern Pakistan: \\"The first time you share tea with a Balti, you are a stranger. The second time you take tea, you are an honored guest. The third time you share a cup of tea, you become family...\\"Three Cups of Tea: One Man's Mission to Promote Peace One School at a Time, by Greg Mortenson and David Oliver Relin, Penguin Books, NY, 2006, p. 150. * The British documentary film Tracing Tea briefly covers tea culture in Pakistan. * Pak Tea House – a tea cafe in Lahore famously known for being visited by prominent academic intellectuals and literary personalities from all walks of life. Festivals and observancesRamadan= Ramadan, the holiest month of the Islamic calendar, is a month of fasting from dawn to sunset. It is widely observed by Pakistan's Muslim majority. Muslims during this month will fast, attend mosques with increased frequency, and offer \\"Namaz-traveeh\\" every day with Isha prayer and recite Qur'an. Special foods are cooked in greater quantities, parties are held, and special accommodation is made by workplaces and educational institutes. =Chand Raat= Chand Raat is the Moon night when crescent moon is sighted on last day of Islamic month of Ramadan and next day is Eid ul-Fitr. In the night known as Chand Raat, people celebrate by various means, such as girls putting henna on their hands. People buy gifts and sweets that will be given to friends and families who come over to celebrate the end of Ramadan. The streets, major buildings, and landmarks, even outside of malls and plazas, put on displays of elaborate decorations and colorful light shows. There are large crowds in the city center to celebrate the beginning of Eid, and it is usually a boom time for business. =Eid celebrations= The 17th-century Badshahi Mosque built by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in Lahore The two Eids, Eid ul-Fitr and Eid ul-Adha, commemorate the passing of the month of fasting, Ramadan, and the willingness of Ibrahim to sacrifice his son Ismael for Allah. On these days, there are national holidays and many festival events that take place to celebrate Eid. As Pakistan is a Muslim state, there are three days off for all businesses and government offices. On the night before Eid, people search for the new moon to mark the end of Ramadan and arrival of Eid ul-Fitr. The day starts with morning prayers, then returning home for a large breakfast with family members. The day is spent visiting relatives and friends and sharing gifts and sweets with everyone. During the evening, Pakistanis often party, visit restaurants or relax in city parks. On Eid ul-Fitr, money is given for charity and as gifts to young children. On Eid ul-Adha, people may also distribute meat to relatives and neighbors and donate food to charity. =Milaad un Nabi= Milaad un Nabi is a known religious festival which is celebrated in all over Pakistan. The Milaad is the celebration of the birthday of the Islamic last prophet Muhammad. =Muharram (Ashura)= Muharram is a month of remembrance and modern Shia meditation that is often considered synonymous with Ashura. Ashura, which literally means the \\"Tenth\\" in Arabic, refers to the tenth day of Muharram. It is well-known because of historical significance and mourning for the martyrdom of Hussein Ibn Ali, the grandson of Muhammad Shias begin mourning from the first night of Muharram and continue for ten nights, climaxing on the 10th of Muharram, known as the Day of Ashura. The last few days up until and including the Day of Ashura are the most important because these were the days in which Imam Hussein and his family and followers (including women, children, and elderly people) were deprived of water from the 7th onward and on the 10th, Imam Hussain and 72 of his followers were martyred by the army of Yazid I at the Battle of Karbala on Yazid's orders. The surviving members of Imam Hussein's family and those of his followers were taken captive, marched to Damascus, and imprisoned there. With the sighting of the new moon, the Islamic New Year is ushered in. The first month, Muharram is one of the four sacred months that [Allah] has mentioned in the Quran. =Jashn-e-Baharan= Jashn-e-Baharan sometimes referred to as Basant, is a pre-Islamic Punjabi festival that marks the coming of spring. Celebrations in Pakistan are centered in Lahore, and people from all over the country and abroad come to the city for the annual festivities. Kite flying competitions took place all over the city's rooftops during Basant but are now prohibited. The fertile province of Punjab was intimately tied via its agriculture to the different seasons of the year. The arrival of spring was an important event for all farmers and was welcomed with a celebration, hence the name Jashn (celebration) Baharan (spring).{Citation neededdate=September 2013} =Independence Day= On 14 August, the people of Pakistan celebrate the day when Pakistan gained its independence from British India and became an independent state for Muslims of South Asia. The day begins with gatherings and prayers in mosques all across Pakistan in which people pray for the betterment and success of their country. Early in the morning, a 21 cannon salute is given to all those who contributed and lost their lives for attaining Independence. Flag hoisting ceremonies are held in the capital Islamabad and all capital cities of other provinces. Mega-events are organized all across the country, in which the people of Pakistan sing their national anthem and famous classical and pop singers sing various patriotic songs. Famous governmental and private buildings are decorated with lights and the day is concluded by a spectacular firework in Major cities of Pakistan. =Defense Day Parade= September 6 is another patriotic day when the Army of Pakistan displays Pakistani weaponry to the general public. All government officials attend the ceremony and recognitions are awarded to special people for their work. In March 2007, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) displayed the new jointly manufactured Chinese-Pakistani aircraft called the JF-17 Thunder. Popular mediaTelevision= Traditionally, the government-owned Pakistan Television Corporation (PTV) has been the dominant media player in Pakistan. The PTV channels are controlled by the government and opposition views are not given much time. The past decade has seen the emergence of several private TV channels showing news and entertainment, such as GEO TV, AAJ TV, ARY Digital, HUM, MTV Pakistan, and others. Traditionally the bulk of TV shows have been plays or soap operas, some of them critically acclaimed. Various American, European, Asian TV channels, and movies are available to a majority of the population via Cable TV. Television accounted for almost half of the advertising expenditure in Pakistan in 2002.http://www.warc.com/LandingPages/Data/NewspaperTrends/PDF/Pakistan.pdf =Radio= The Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) was formed on 14 August 1947, the day of Pakistani independence. It was a direct descendant of the Indian Broadcasting Company, which later became All India Radio. At independence, Pakistan had radio stations in Dhaka, Lahore, and Peshawar. A major programme of expansion saw new stations open at Karachi and Rawalpindi in 1948, and a new broadcasting house at Karachi in 1950. This was followed by new radio stations at Hyderabad (1951), Quetta (1956), the second station at Rawalpindi (1960), and a receiving center at Peshawar (1960). During the 1980s and 1990s, the corporation expanded its network to many cities and towns of Pakistan to provide greater service to the local people. Today, there are over a hundred radio stations due to more liberal media regulations. =Cinema= Pakistan's movie industry is known as Lollywood, named after the city of Lahore. Film production centers also exist in Karachi and Peshawar. The Pakistani film industry produces over forty feature-length films a year. Bollywood films are also popular in Pakistan but with recent bad relations with India, they tend to be on the cinema screen much lesser than they used to do.

Amina converted to Islam and concerted her efforts on relation of gender and Islam. She has been part of several civil society organizations and movements for promoting principles of equality for women under principles of Islam. Early life Wadud was born Mary Teasley to an African-American family in Bethesda, Maryland. Her father was a Methodist minister. In 1972, she converted to Islam, while a student at the University of Pennsylvania, which she attended from 1970 to 1975. She officially changed her name to Amina Wadud two years later. Education In 1975, Wadud graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a bachelor of science. She received her M.A. in Near Eastern Studies and her Ph.D. in Arabic and Islamic Studies from the University of Michigan in 1988. During graduate school, she studied in Egypt, including advanced Arabic at the American University in Cairo, Qur'anic studies and tafsir (exegesis or religious interpretation) at Cairo University, and philosophy at Al-Azhar University. Work Wadud's research specialities include gender and Qur'anic studies. From 1989 to 1992, she worked as an assistant professor in Quranic Studies at IIUM. While there, she published her dissertation Qur'an and Woman: Rereading the Sacred Text from a Woman's Perspective and co-founded the non-governmental organization Sisters in Islam.New Straits Times - The day I met Amina Wadud By Siti Nurbaiyah Nadzmi The book is still used by the NGO as a basic text for activists and academics, but it is banned in the United Arab Emirates. In 1992, Wadud accepted a position as Professor of Religion and Philosophy at Virginia Commonwealth University. She retired in 2008, and took up a position as a visiting professor at the Center for Religious and Cross Cultural Studies at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Wadud has spoken at universities, as well as grassroots, government and non-government forums throughout the United States, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Africa and Europe. Her speaking engagements include the keynote address \\"Islam, Justice, and Gender\\" at the 2008 international conference Understanding Conflicts: Cross-Cultural Perspectives, held at Aarhus University, Denmark; a paper titled “Islam Beyond Patriarchy Through Gender Inclusive Qur’anic Analysis” at the 2009 Musawah - Equality and Justice in the Family conference;Islam Beyond Patriarchy Through Gender Inclusive Qur’anic Analysis the Regional Conference on Advancing Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment in Muslim Societies, hosted by United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and the International Centre for Islam and Pluralism (ICIP) in Jakarta, Indonesia, in March 2009; a workshop on \\"Sharia and Human Rights\\" at the University of Bergen, Norway in late November 2009; a public lecture titled \\"Muslim Women and Gender Justice: Methods, Motivation and Means\\" to the Faculty of Arts, Asia Institute, at the University of Melbourne, Australia in February 2010; a lecture on “Tawhid and Spiritual Development for Social Action” at Muslims for Progressive Values at the Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley, California in July 2011. Wadud has also openly advocated \\"pluralism\\" and \\"equality\\" as an endorsement of LGBTQ+ rights.Canadian LGBT Mosque Reference Controversy 1994 sermon= In August 1994, Wadud delivered a Friday pre-khutbah (sermon) on \\"Islam as Engaged Surrender\\" at the Claremont Main Road Mosque in Cape Town, South Africa. Women delivering even a pre-khutbah talk was unheard of in the Muslim world. It was widely mis-reported that Wadud had actually delivered the khutbah (the formal Arabic sermon delivered from the pulpit), which she did not (she delivered the main talk - in English and not from the pulpit - however a pre-khutbah talk is not part of the formal Friday ceremony). As a result, there were attempts in Virginia by some Muslims to have her dismissed from her position at Virginia Commonwealth University. =2005 prayer leadership= More than a decade later, Wadud decided to lead Friday prayers (salat) for a congregation in the United States, breaking with Islamic laws, which allows only male imams (prayer leaders) in mixed-gender congregations. (See Women as imams for a discussion of the issue.) On Friday 18 March 2005, Wadud acted as imam for a congregation of about 60 women and 40 men seated together, without any gender separation. The call to prayer was given by another woman, Suheyla El-Attar. It was sponsored by the Muslim Women's Freedom Tour, under the leadership of Asra Nomani, by the website Muslim WakeUp!, and by members of the Progressive Muslim Union. A small number of protestors gathered outside against the prayer. The gathering was held in the Synod House, owned by and adjoining the Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Divine, in Manhattan's Morningside Heights, after three mosques had refused to host the service and the Sundaram Tagore Gallery withdrew its offer after a bomb threat. Wadud said while she initially wanted to host the prayer in a neutral place, but after the bomb threats, she decided on the church, not to make a statement, but because she wanted to conduct the prayers in a sacred place. She said, \\"I don't want to change Muslim mosques. I want to encourage the hearts of Muslims, both in their public, private and ritual affairs, to believe they are one and equal.\\" Response The prayer service drew controversy, with mixed reactions from the Muslim community. Over 100 men and women attended the prayers, and about 15 people protested outside the church. Sheikh Yusuf Al-Qaradawi of Qatar said that, while a woman could lead other women and even possibly her young children in salat, she could not lead a mixed group including non-mahram males. Sheikh Sayyid Tantawi of Cairo's Al- Azhar mosque criticized the prayer in the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram: \\"When she leads men in prayer, in this case, it is not proper for them to look at the woman whose body is in front of them.\\" Some Muslim academics supported Wadud. Egyptian academic Gamal al-Banna argued that her actions were supported by Islamic sources. Writer and Harvard Divinity School professor Leila Ahmed said it brought attention to the issue of women in Islam. Islamic scholar Ebrahim E.I. Moosa called the prayer a \\"wonderful move.\\" Khaled Abou El-Fadl, professor of Islamic Studies at UCLA, California said: \\"What the fundamentalists are worried about is that there's going to be a ripple effect not just in the U.S. but all over the Muslim world. The women who are learned and frustrated that they cannot be the imam are going to see that someone got the guts to break ranks and do it.\\"Woman leads Muslims in prayers Because Wadud said she had become the target of death threats, the police and her employer, fearing for her security and reacting to concerns from parents about their children's safety, asked her to conduct her classes from home through a video link.Singing A Song Many Women Have Been Humming By Richmond Times In her first interview after the prayer, Wadud denied receiving any death threats and described them as media hype. Wadud has continued with her speaking engagements and to lead mixed-gender Friday prayer services. On October 28, 2005, following her talk at the International Congress on Islamic Feminism in Barcelona, Spain, she was invited to lead a congregation of about thirty people. Following an invitation by the Muslim Educational Centre of Oxford, she led a mixed-gender prayer in the United Kingdom, even though Muslims planning to attend were threatened with being disowned by conservative imams through personal visits from mosques. =2013 Madras University controversy= Wadud was to deliver a lecture on 29 July 2013 on 'Gender and Reform in Islam' at the University of Madras in Chennai, India. The scheduled lecture was cancelled because police cited possible law and order problems in view of opposition by Muslim groups. S.M. Syed Iqbal, state secretary of India Towheed Jamad, said that she comes with the backing of the US government and offers so-called progressive views that are against the basic tenets of Islam, and that his outfit would protest in front of the venues if she were allowed to talk. Awards In 2007, Wadud received the Danish Democracy Prize.

Gameplay The game is known for featuring the 1998 Formula One season (with all drivers except Jacques Villeneuve, who is instead replaced by a fictional character, John Newhouse). In August 2001 an expansion pack, Grand Prix 3 2000 Season, was released, updating the game to feature the 2000 season's cars and drivers (including Villeneuve), as well as the 2 new circuits on the calendar, the Sepang International Circuit in Malaysia and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. ReceptionCritical reviews= The game received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. It was not quite as well received as its predecessors, but at the time was widely considered to be the best racing simulation available. The editors of Computer Gaming World nominated Grand Prix 3 as the best racing game of 2000, although it lost to Motocross Madness 2. They described Grand Prix 3 as a \\"precisely tuned\\" title. =Sales= In Europe, Grand Prix 3 sold 300,000 units in one month. Italy made up above 30,000 sales of this number, while Spain accounted for 6,500. Multiplayer.it attributed the relatively low sales in Spain to that country's rampant software piracy problem.https://web.archive.org/web/20031013084543/http://www.multiplayer.it/b2b/articoli.php3?id=3443 In the German market, Grand Prix 3 sold 40,000 units in its first three days of availability. Debuting at #2 on Media Control's computer game sales chart for July 2000, it rose to first place the following month, before claiming fourth in September. The Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD) presented Grand Prix 3 with a \\"Gold\\" award at the end of that month, indicating sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The game proceeded to place seventh, ninth and 18th on Media Control's charts through the end of 2000. Although Grand Prix 3 passed the 100,000-sale mark in German-speaking countries, Udo Hoffman of PC Player reported that it had fallen below Hasbro Interactive's projections by late 2000, and that the publisher was \\"more than a little disappointed\\" in its performance. The company's product manager, Thomas Sewing, blamed this outcome in part on high competition from other titles with the Formula One license. Grand Prix 3 continued to chart on Media Control's top 30 in 2001, placing 19th in January, 23rd in February and 17th in March. In the United Kingdom, Grand Prix 3 received a \\"Silver\\" certificate from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), for at least 100,000 sales in the region.

It was the third game released in the Chuck Rock series (even though the Chuck Rock connection is not as prominent in this game). The game was designed by Toby Gard, who later created Lara Croft. BC Racers tries to create a racing simulation by mixing the usual elements of games of this genre with the \\"prehistoric\\" theme. Particularly, the game takes place in the world of one of Core's iconic characters, Chuck Rock. Its working title was \\"Chuck Rally\\". Plot The millionaire playboy caveman Millstone Rockafella has organized a BC bike race, the winner of which will receive the Ultimate Boulderdash Bike. Six groups of riders -one driving, one deploying weapons from the sidecar- from all around the prehistoric world will use their rock-powered sidecars to compete for this prize. Gameplay BC Racers has four difficulty settings: Easy, Medium, Hard and Rockhard. Each of the settings has eight different circuits, making a total of 32 circuits in the game. There are also eight themes, from desert wastes to active volcanoes and massive jungles. The tracks need four laps to complete, and feature many special elements specific to the circuit's setting. Unusually for a game of this type, there are no power-ups, except for a \\"turbo\\" that the bikes can trigger every few seconds. Both of the bikes' riders can use physical attacks to injure other drivers. If the bike gets beaten enough, it crashes out, giving the player extra points. The same thing can happen to the player's bike. Some ports of the game include a split-screen two player mode. The Sega CD version instead has a two-player cooperative mode (one of the players controls the driver, while the other controls the fighting, steering and turbo). Some of the riders in BC Racers come from other famous Core Design games, such as Chuck Rock and Chuck Rock Junior. Others are obvious references to several real-world characters, such as Brick Jagger, Sid Viscous and Jimi Handtrix (referencing Mick Jagger, Sid Vicious and Jimi Hendrix). Reception Reviewing the Sega CD version, GamePro criticized the pixelated landscapes, minimal sound effects, and difficult controls when using a three-button controller, but praised the comical graphics and \\"lightweight\\" tone, and recommended it as a decent title for younger gamers. Digital Press gave the Sega CD version 7 out of 10, praising the controls and music, but they criticized the graphics. In their review of the 32X version, GamePro commented that the graphics are sharper than in the Sega CD version, but look much worse during actual gameplay due to the choppy frame rate and prominent slowdown, especially during two-player mode. They nonetheless concluded that \\"BC Racers' numerous tracks, humorous attacks, and simultaneous two-player action will appeal to those looking for a lighthearted challenge.\\" Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"there's nothing here you haven't seen before. Super Karts, with its larger graphics and wide variety of power-ups, is still the reigning champion of cart-racers.\\" Reviewing the 3DO version, a Next Generation critic rated it as the worst racing game on the 3DO to date, citing the lack of depth to the car handling, the ugly-looking courses, and overall outdated feel of the game. He gave it one out of five stars.

He is known as a solo artist, a film score composer, and as the lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist and keyboardist (and bassist between 1999 and 2001) of the Seattle-based bands Sunny Day Real Estate and The Fire Theft. BiographyPoor Old Lu, Sunny Day Real Estate, and first solo projects (1993–2000)= Enigk was born in Seattle, Washington, to Gary E. Enigk and Sherry Hammond Enigk. In the late 1980s, Enigk was part of what would eventually become Poor Old Lu, sharing vocalist duties with Scott Hunter. He joined the group Sunny Day Real Estate, where he served as lead singer, co-songwriter, rhythm guitarist and keyboardist. The group released two albums in 1994–1995 and then broke up; during the band's first break-up (spanning 1995–97), Enigk released the 1996 solo album, Return of the Frog Queen, and rejoined Poor Old Lu for a single track in 1996, singing alongside Scott on the band's Straight Six EP, on the track, \\"Digging Deep.\\". Enigk converted to Christianity in the mid-1990s. There was an aborted attempt to record a second Sub Pop album, a follow-up to Return of the Frog Queen as Enigk explains, \\"We started a 2nd solo record and actually recorded one song with Anita Perkins and some of the other string players. That was the first attempt that I ever had at completely writing all the music myself, without Mark Nichols who did 'Return of the Frog Queen' with me. But that was the only song. And then, shortly after that Sunny Day got back together, and all my songs that were meant to be for a solo record were moved to Sunny Day Real Estate. Some of the songs on How It Feels actually.\\" In 1997, Sunny Day Real Estate returned, with the first line-up, when bassist Nate Mendel left the band, Enigk moved to the bass (he also played guitar and keyboards in studio), the band released two more studio albums, the last one (The Rising Tide, 2000) without a contribution of Nate Mendel. =The Fire Theft and solo work (2001–present)= After Sunny Day Real Estate's second breakup in 2001, Enigk formed The Fire Theft, with former Sunny Day Real Estate members Goldsmith and Mendel. They released a self-titled album in 2003 and an EP in 2004 before breaking up. He appeared on the soundtrack for the 2003 film The United States of Leland. In 2006, he followed Frog Queen with another solo album, World Waits on his own label, Lewis Hollow Records. A song from the album, \\"Been Here Before,\\" was included as an MP3 with Winamp. In June 2009, Sunny Day Real Estate reunited once again with the original line-up and toured the United States. But after some fruitless recording sessions, the band has been inactive for the time being. On February 9, 2015, he announced a US tour focusing mainly on East and West coast venues. It was later revealed in March 2015 that the tour was the first step towards raising the necessary funds for an upcoming new album. On March 28, 2015 he announced a crowdfunding campaign via the Pledgemusic website that was expected to also support the release of the upcoming new album.

It is one out of nine colleges of the university, being the nearest to the library on the Heslington West part of the campus. History Alcuin College is one of the University of York's first colleges, established in 1967 alongside Vanbrugh College. It was officially opened in 1969 by Kenneth Clark, the chancellor of the university. It is located on Siward's Howe, making it the highest elevated college in the university. It is also believed to be the burial site of Eric Bloodaxe, who was King of Northumbria and of Norway. =Separatist movement= From the early days of the college an uproar for secession of the college from the remainder of the university has been present.Alcuin Separatist article Buildings and services For many years Alcuin College was very much the outcast on the university campus, the only college physically separate from the others except for a bridge from the library, a narrow bridge from Langwith (demolished over Easter 2008) and a walkway to the chemistry department. Overlooking University Road was Alcuin's bar. In 1995 this was transformed from a traditional British pub-style bar to a 1950s American theme bar - the only themed college bar on campus. The bar was decorated in American 1950s paraphanelia such as busts of Marilyn Monroe and a full-size pink cadillac that appeared to be crashing through the wall. The bar's terrace overlooked University Road and was immensely popular with students in the summer. The bar incorporated a burger bar and the staff all wore uniforms of stars and stripes. Alcuin College (2010) In the new century, the bar was renamed \\"B Henry's\\", after Brian Henry, a college porter of many years who had recently retired. On its opening it was very popular despite its relatively distant location compared to the rest of campus. In 2007 the bar once again went under transformation, being revamped as a \\"B Henry's. The Cocktail Bar\\". In 2008, a move by commercial services to close B Henry's triggered a large campaign to save the bar.http://www.nouse.co.uk/2008/11/08/yusu-pledges-full-support- to-%e2%80%98save-b-henry%e2%80%99s%e2%80%99-campaign/ The campaign had the backing of the whole college and the students union as a whole, but it was unsuccessful. In 2013, the student union took over the running of the outlet and named it \\"The Kitchen at Alcuin\\". The Kitchen at Alcuin has taken to being open longer hours, now closing at 8:00 pm and having a pizza \\"dinner\\" style menu. Events such as YUSU's Keep Cool at exam time campaign, the Alcuin 50th anniversary and Envirocuin have seen the Kitchen at Alcuin being used as a more general venue for activities outside of normal opening hours. Sometimes referred to as the \\"Ensuite-Elite\\", Alcuin is perhaps best known for the ensuite bathrooms that come as standard with every room and the general quality of the rooms, most of which were recently built. It currently does not possess a bar, but has two food venues, the Alcuin Bistro and the Kitchen at Alcuin café. The college accommodation is divided into blocks; E, F1, F2, G, H, J1, J2, K, L, M, N, P and Q. There are also several teaching blocks (East Wing and the Seebohm Rowntree building) and is home of several departments including economics and chemistry, as well as the university library. Following Vanbrugh B and C block's conversion to offices, the uprooted residents moved to the newly made P and Q blocks (which were built on time) and referred to themselves as Valcuin members. In addition to P and Q blocks, a new JCR building was built, and an extra launderette near the JCR (to try to add to the four washing machines for the whole of Alcuin). The JCR was opened in May 2006, six months later than planned. The Seebohm Rowntree Building was added in 2002, and contains teaching facilities.University of York Press Release 6 June 2002 Student association Coat of arms for the Alcuin CSAC Like the other York colleges, Alcuin has its own student association. Known as the College Student Association Committee (CSAC), the association takes on the responsibility of the day-to-day running of the college activities and is responsible for supporting students, providing social, sporting and cultural activities and developing the college community. The 2019 the CSAC committee executive was: * Olivia Furness, president * Claudia Clark, secretary * Dorothy-Jane Gough, treasurer * Bethan Topping, vice-president for events * Emily Fradley, vice-president for wellbeing * Mae James, vice-president for sport  Student events  Alcuin College is notable for hosting many popular student events. The CSAC hosts its regular pub quizzes at The Courtyard, the local campus bar. Over the past years the Alcuin CSAC have branded their events by incorporating \\"AL\\" into the title, examples include \\"TropicAL\\", \\"AnimAL\\" and \\"TerritoriAL\\". In more recent time, however, this tradition has been discarded with the coming in of newer CSACs. Popular past events include \\"Das Sexy Sexy German Teckno Disko Party\\" and its subsequent follow ups, \\"Das Sexy Sexy German Teckno Disko Party\\" parts zwei, drei, vier and fünf. Continuing with a music theme, Alcuin has introduced Alcuin Live Lounge where current and ex-students of the college attend the Kitchen at Alcuin for a chilled night of live music given by students and members of the community. Alcuin hosts a yearly winter ball, which is the most heavily attended college event of the year. Traditionally a spring ball was held with the last being a masquerade ball in 2017. In 2018, there was an introduction of a new Alcuin led event, \\"Event X\\". The event is to change theme each year but held on campus as an alternative to a formal in the spring term. The first Event X, \\"Prom\\", brought together not only students from Alcuin, but other colleges in Hendrix Hall with free Pic'N'Mix and a live student band. Event X titles * 2018: Prom * 2019: TBA Furthermore, Alcuin is also notable among the rest of the university for its wellbeing events, being able to cater for those students who do not enjoy club nights is seen to be very important and has led to recurring events such as \\"Exam Refuge\\" in which the CSAC provide free food and a relaxed environment to Alcuinites during the exam period. Alcuin is also known for hosting the \\"Nuzzlets\\" where a variety of animals are brought in for students to pet, this event has been particularly popular over the years.

It serves as an interchange between the Armadale, Fremantle, Joondalup, Mandurah and Midland lines as well as Transwa's Australind service. History View of old Platform 2, now Platform 5 Perth Underground Murray Street entrance =Establishment= The foundation stone for the George Temple-Poole designed Perth station was laid on 10 May 1880, with the station opening on 1 March 1881 part of the Eastern Railway from Fremantle to Guildford.History of Perth Only Perth It had one through platform with terminating bay platforms at either end. The Neoclassical style building had a second storey added in 1894 that became the headquarters of the Western Australian Government Railways until 1976. A planned third storey and clocktower were never built.Perth Railway Precinct Stage Heritage Office The building has been renovated and expanded numerous times since being built, as well as the forecourt entrance area. The station was the centre of the Western Australian Government Railways system with most regional trains originating from the station. A collection of freight and administrative offices and tearooms were part of the railway station complex. The railway building has at times housed various commercial operations as well as police offices. The WA Craft Council was a tenant in the 1980s. For a considerable length of time the forecourt area was used for car parking. This is now very limited except for official vehicles. The building had the Barrack Street and William Street bridges as limiting factors to its development; patrons were able to gain direct access to the station by escalators and walkways, though with the introduction of SmartRider gates the William Street entrance was fenced off and its walkway and exit eventually removed. =Changes= As early as the 1950s, there were moves and suggestions for the redevelopment of the station area. See specifically the section 'Biography'. Following the cessation of most regional services, the completion of standard gauge tracks to East Perth station, and the relocation of most administrative offices to the Westrail Centre alongside, by the late 1970s Perth station remained as a terminus for The Australind service to Bunbury, as well as Transperth suburban services.

He received a $1,500 grant from Robert Charles Winthrop, a Boston philanthropist and chair of the Peabody Education Board in Massachusetts. The school was originally established in Columbia to educate young women to teach in the public schools. Winthrop has developed into a university offering undergraduate and graduate degrees through five colleges and schools. It has enrollment of about 6,000 students. The majority of Winthrop's students are from South Carolina, with out-of-state and foreign students accounting for 13% of undergraduate enrollment. The main academic and residential campus is located in Rock Hill, southwest of Charlotte, North Carolina and north of Columbia, South Carolina. Fielding athletic teams known as Winthrop Eagles, the university participates in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division I level as a member of Big South Conference. The athletic program is known for its success in volleyball, basketball, soccer, and tennis. History Winthrop University was founded In 1886, when the Peabody Education Board of Massachusetts, headed by Robert C. Winthrop, provided $1,500 to form the \\"Winthrop Training School\\" for white women teachers. That year the school opened its doors to twenty-one students in Columbia, South Carolina. Nine years later in 1895 it moved to Rock Hill. The school's name had changed in 1893 to \\"Winthrop Normal and Industrial College of South Carolina\\", reflecting its mission to prepare some students for industrial jobs. The college was segregated until 1964. It became fully coeducational in 1974. Evolving from a training school to a college with a four-year full curriculum, it also developed a graduate division. By 1992 it reflected this development, changing its name to Winthrop University. Campus 265x265pxThe university's campus is in the city of Rock Hill, South Carolina. The Winthrop College Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), as are Tillman Hall and Withers Building. The Winthrop University campus has its own zip code of 29733. Rock Hill has a total of five historic districts listed on the NRHP. Winthrop's campus is divided into two distinct areas: The main campus which houses the academic buildings, residence halls, library and campus center, and the more recently constructed Recreational and Research Complex, located about one mile northeast of the main campus. Winthrop's main campus has had extensive development since the late 20th century. A $12 million Dalton Hall opened in 1999. The Courtyard at Winthrop, which features apartment-style residences for students, opened in 2003. The Lois Rhame West Health, Physical Education and Wellness Center opened in 2007; it is the new home of the University's physical education department and intramural sports. The most recent addition, in 2010, is the DiGiorgio Campus Center, which added a multi-purpose campus center. This features a 225-seat movie theater, food court, campus bookstore, post office, and casual dining. The DiGiorgio Center is connected to the West Center via an open-air plaza.258x258pxNinety-one (91%) percent of freshman and forty-five (45%) percent of all undergraduate students live on-campus. The Research Complex hosts the Piedmont Wetlands Research Project, a golf course (open to faculty, students and alumni), and a world-class disc golf course.

Sororities include Alpha Delta Pi, Alpha Kappa Alpha, Chi Omega, Delta Sigma Theta, Delta Zeta, Sigma Gamma Rho, Sigma Sigma Sigma, Zeta Phi Beta, Zeta Sigma Chi, and Zeta Tau Alpha. = Student media = The Johnsonian, Winthrop's independent weekly student newspaper, has been published since 1923. It's available in print on campus and digitally on MyTJNow.com. In 2016, it was voted as the top student newspaper in the state of South Carolina by the S.C. Press Association. Athletics The university is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and competes on the Division I level. Winthrop is a charter member of the Big South Conference. Winthrop's teams are known as the Eagles and their colors are garnet and gold. The university sponsors 18 intercollegiate teams (eight men's and 10 women's) in baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis and track on the men's side, and basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, track and volleyball on the women's side. The university has labeled itself \\"The Campus of Champions\\" as its intercollegiate athletic teams have experienced success in recent years. Specifically, the university has won numerous Big South Conference championships in the following sports: baseball (three since 1995), men's basketball (eleven since 1988), men's cross country (two since 2000), men's soccer (six since 2002), men's tennis (four since 1997), women's tennis (20 since 1994), softball (three since 1989), women's lacrosse (two since 2015), and women's volleyball (four since 2002). =Facilities= Winthrop Coliseum At the heart of the university's athletic facilities is the Winthrop Coliseum. In addition to serving as the home venue of the men's and women's basketball and volleyball teams, the university's athletic department offices are located in the Coliseum. The arena features 6,100 permanent seats and hosts numerous non-university shows and events in addition to Winthrop athletic contests. The Coliseum also served as the temporary practice site of the NFL's Carolina Panthers until completion of the team's facilities in Charlotte. The Winthrop baseball team plays at Winthrop Ballpark, a multimillion-dollar 1,989-seat baseball stadium which opened in 2003. Opened in 2005, the university's track and field teams compete on the $2.8 million Irwin Belk Track Complex. The facility hosts numerous Division 1 meets. The university's soccer teams compete at the recently completed Eagle Field. The facility features 1,800 permanent seats, a press box, field house, and a Daktronics LCD scoreboard. In addition, the playing field is a Tifway 419 hybrid Bermuda grass with Eagle Blend and Sun Star. The softball team competes at the Winthrop Softball Complex, which opened in 2001. The facility includes four fields, locker rooms, and an indoor batting cage. The tennis teams compete at the Winthrop Tennis Complex, which opened in 2003. The complex includes 12 lighted courts, seating for 300, and a clubhouse with public restroom facilities, locker rooms, and offices. =Men's basketball= Perhaps the university's most well- known athletic team is the men's basketball team, which has earned a berth in eleven NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournaments since 1999. Additionally, it has won the Big South Conference Championship twelve times (1988, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2017, and 2020). Winthrop has won more Big South Conference Championships than any other school in the conference. On March 5, 2007, the Winthrop Eagles men's basketball team was ranked in the Top 25 of both major college basketball polls for the first time in school history. The Eagles were ranked #22 in the USA TODAY/ESPN Top 25 poll and #24 on the Associated Press (AP) Top 25 poll. Later that spring on March 16, 2007 the Winthrop Eagles defeated Notre Dame for the first NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament win in school history. Seven men's basketball championships came during Gregg Marshall's tenure as head coach. He left Winthrop to become the head coach at Wichita State University. Marshall's assistant at Winthrop, Randy Peele, was named as his successor and led the Eagles to win Big South Championships in 2008 and 2010. In March 2012, Winthrop named Pat Kelsey as the new head coach of the Eagles. Under Kelsey, the program has a record of 139–83. In 2017, the Eagles earned a #13 seed in the NCAA tournament but lost to #4 Butler in the opening round. The Eagles earned an automatic bid into the 2020 NCAA tournament, which was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. = Women's tennis = Since the mid 1990s, the Winthrop's women's tennis team has become the dominant force in the Big South conference, winning 20 out of 25 conference tournament championships since 1994. In the 2018 NCAA Division I Women's Tennis Championship, Winthrop beat Auburn to make it past the first round for the first time in school history. Lauren Proctor rose to no. 14 in national rankings during that same season.

The ship was the first U.S. Navy vessel named for Gustavus Conyngham. Conyngham was laid down by the William Cramp & Sons of Philadelphia, in July 1914 and launched in July of the following year. The ship was a little more than in length, just over abeam, and had a standard displacement of . She was armed with four guns and had eight 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. Conyngham was powered by a pair of steam turbines that propelled her at up to . After her January 1916 commissioning, Conyngham sailed in the Atlantic and the Caribbean. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Conyngham was part of the first U.S. destroyer squadron sent overseas. Patrolling the Irish Sea out of Queenstown, Ireland, Conyngham made several rescues of passengers and crew from ships sunk by U-boats. Conynghams commander was commended for actions related to what was thought at the time to be a \\"probable\\" kill of a German submarine. Upon returning to the United State in December 1918, Conyngham underwent repairs at the Boston Navy Yard. She remained there in reduced commission through 1921, with only brief episodes of activity. After returning to active service for about a year, she was decommissioned in June 1922. In June 1924, Conyngham was transferred to the United States Coast Guard to help enforce Prohibition as a part of the \\"Rum Patrol\\". She operated under the name USCGC Conyngham (CG-2) until 1933, when she was returned to the Navy. Later that year, the ship was renamed DD-58 to free the name Conyngham for another destroyer. She was sold for scrap in August 1934.  Design and construction  Conyngham was authorized in 1913 as the second ship of the which, like the related , was an improved version of the s authorized in 1911. Construction of the vessel was awarded to William Cramp & Sons of Philadelphia, which laid down her keel on 27 July 1914. Twelve months later, on 8 July 1915, Conyngham was launched by sponsor Miss A. C. Stevens, a great-great-granddaughter of the ship's namesake, Gustavus Conyngham (1744–1819), a Continental Navy officer. As built, Conyngham was in length and abeam and drew . The ship had a standard displacement of and displaced when fully loaded. Conyngham had two Curtis steam turbines that drove her two screw propellers, and an additional steam turbine geared to one of the propeller shafts for cruising purposes. The power plant could generate and move the ship at speeds up to . Conynghams main battery consisted of four /50 Mark 9 guns,The 50 denotes the length of the gun barrels; in this case, the gun is 50 calibers, meaning that the gun is 50 times as long as it is in diameter, in this case. The Mark number is the version of the gun; in this case, the ninth U.S. Navy design of the 4-inch/50 gun. with each gun weighing in excess of . The guns fired armor-piercing projectiles at . At an elevation of 20°, the guns had a range of . Conyngham was also equipped with eight torpedo tubes. The General Board of the United States Navy had called for two anti-aircraft guns for the Tucker-class ships, as well as provisions for laying up to 36 floating mines. From sources, it is unclear if these recommendations were followed for Conyngham or any of the other ships of the class.  Early career  USS Conyngham was commissioned into the United States Navy on 21 January 1916 under the command of Lieutenant Commander A. W. Johnson. Following her commissioning, Conyngham joined in tactics and war maneuvers off the east coast in 1916 and in the beginning of 1917 sailed to the Caribbean for war games and fleet maneuvers. Returning to Norfolk, Virginia on 23 March, she joined 5th Naval District Patrol Force and with and patrolled the approaches to Chesapeake Bay.  World War I  On 24 April 1917 Conyngham sailed from Boston, Massachusetts with her division for Queenstown, Ireland, the first destroyers to join English forces for duty after the entry of the United States into World War I earlier that month. This force patrolled off the Irish coast and escorted convoys through the danger zone where German submarine operated. The destroyers also providing rescue services for stricken ships. When the British ship was torpedoed and sunk by German submarine on 17 August 1917, Conyngham sped to her assistance and rescued 39 survivors. A similar distress call from the British ship on 22 November—torpedoed by German submarine —resulted in the rescue of her 30-man crew by Conyngham. The British Armed merchant cruiser and ten destroyers, including Conyngham, were escorting an eastbound convoy of twenty steamers on 19 October, when German submarine surfaced in the midst of the group. The submarine launched its only remaining torpedo at Orama, sinking that vessel. Lookouts on Conyngham saw U-62s periscope and quickly launched a depth charge attack on the spot where the U-boat had submerged, bringing oil and debris to the surface.Gibson and Prendergast, p. 221. Conynghams commanding officer was commended for his prompt and effective action, and the British Admiralty awarded Conyngham a \\"probable\\" kill on the submarine. Unfortunately for Conynghams record, though, U-62 had survived the encounter.  Post-war  After the hostilities had ended on 11 November 1918 with Germany signing the Armistice, Conyngham sailed from Queenstown on 14 December 1918 for Boston to have an overhaul. From February to April 1919, the destroyer participated in fleet exercises and division maneuvers in the Caribbean. Returning to Boston, she was placed in reduced commission until 1921. In June 1921, Conyngham accompanied a Cuban warship that was repatriating the remains of former Cuban President José Miguel Gómez to Havana. She returned to Newport, Rhode Island, for summer exercises with her squadron and, after wintering at Charleston, South Carolina, reported to Philadelphia Navy Yard in March 1922 for inactivation. She was decommissioned there on 23 June 1922.  United States Coast Guard career  On 17 January 1920, Prohibition was instituted by law in the United States. Soon, the smuggling of alcoholic beverages along the coastlines of the United States became widespread and blatant. The Treasury Department eventually determined that the United States Coast Guard simply did not have the ships to constitute a successful patrol. To cope with the problem, President Calvin Coolidge in 1924 authorized the transfer from the Navy to the Coast Guard of twenty old destroyers that were in reserve and out of commission. Conyngham was reactivated and transferred to the Treasury Department on 7 June 1924 for use by the Coast Guard. Designated CG-2, Conyngham was commissioned on 8 March 1925, and joined the \\"Rum Patrol\\" to aid in the attempt to enforce prohibition laws. After the United States Congress proposed the Twenty-first Amendment to end prohibition in February 1933, plans were made for Conyngham to be returned to the Navy. On 27 May 1933, Conyngham arrived at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, and was decommissioned nine days later, on 5 June. Conyngham was transferred back to the Navy on 30 June. Later in 1933, the ship was renamed DD-58 in order to free the name Conyngham for a new destroyer of the same name. DD-58 remained in noncommissioned status until struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 5 July 1934. She was sold for scrap on 22 August in accordance with the London Naval Treaty.

Until 2013, it was the only species in the genus Linnaea. It is a boreal to subarctic woodland subshrub, commonly known as twinflower (sometimes written twin flower). This plant was a favorite of Carl Linnaeus, founder of the modern system of binomial nomenclature, for whom the genus was named. Description The leaves are under 1cm long, with a few shallow teeth on the upper half. The perennial stems of Linnaea borealis are slender, pubescent, and prostrate, growing to long, with opposite evergreen rounded oval leaves long and broad. The flowering stems curve erect, to tall, and are leafless except at the base. The flowers are paired, pendulous, long, with a five-lobed, pale pink corolla. Taxonomy Linnaea borealis was first formally described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 in Species Plantarum. It was then the sole species in the genus Linnaea. The genus name had been used earlier by the Dutch botanist Jan Frederik Gronovius, and was given in honour of Linnaeus. Linnaeus adopted the name because Linnaea borealis was his favourite plant. Linnaea borealis is considered to be a single circumboreal species, with three generally recognized subspecies: *Linnaea borealis subsp. borealis - Europe *Linnaea borealis subsp. americana - North America (formerly classified as the species Linnaea americana) *Linnaea borealis subsp. longiflora - Asia, and western North America (from Alaska to California) The English name \\"twinflower\\" for Linnaea borealis refers to the plant's paired flowers. Ecology and distribution Linnaea borealis ssp. longiflora in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, Washington, U.S. clonal colonies Linnaea borealis has a circumpolar distribution in moist subarctic, boreal, or cool temperate forests, extending further south at higher elevations in various mountains, in Europe south to the Alps, in Asia south to northern Japan, and in North America south to northern California and to Arizona and New Mexico in the west, and to West Virginia (and formerly Tennessee) in the Appalachian Mountains in the east. Linnaea borealis is self-incompatible, requiring cross-pollination to produce viable seeds; since pollen dispersal is usually not far, individuals and clonal colonies can become reproductively isolated. Regardless of seed production, Linnaea plants in a particular area often spread by stolons to form clonal patches of the same genotype. Such clonal stands of Linnaea can be long-persisting, in some places remaining extant even if seed is not produced or if seedling germination or establishment does not occur. The species was presumably common in areas south of its present range during times of Pleistocene (\\"Ice Age\\") glaciations, and its clone-forming perennial growth habit has allowed it to survive the subsequent millennia locally within this former range in various high- elevation or otherwise cool and moist habitats, including algific talus slopes with persisting underground periglacial ice. Conservation While the three subspecies of Linnaea borealis are all considered widespread, abundant, and secure in their main, northern ranges, all three subspecies are of conservation concern near the subspecies's range edges or at more southerly, disjunct sites. In Great Britain, Linnaea borealis ssp. borealis is listed as \\"nationally scarce\\", growing mainly in open pine woodlands in Scotland and northernmost England. Foresters consider this plant to be an indicator species of ancient woodlands, often found in association with creeping lady's tresses. It is found in about 50 sites around the country, with most situated in the woods around the Cairngorms; the southernmost locations are four sites in Northumberland and one in County Durham. The sparseness of the sites is responsible for the continued decline of the plant in the country. In Scotland, 37% of L. borealis patches studied consisted of a single genotype, reproducing clonally vegetatively but not producing viable seed. This is a conservation concern because without viable seed, the species may not be able to re-populate restored habitat, and may not be able to adapt to climate change by establishing new populations. In the United States, Linnaea borealis ssp. americana is of conservation concern in several states along or near the southern edge of the species' range, including Arizona, Iowa, Massachusetts, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, and was known historically but now considered extirpated or possibly so in Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Tennessee. In Canada, Linnaea borealis ssp. longiflora is considered of conservation significance in the Yukon Territory, along the eastern edge of its range, where ssp. americana is widespread and abundant. Since many of the outlying southern sites for Linnaea borealis are in habitats that are at high elevations or otherwise in cooler microclimates than the surrounding general landscapes, ongoing and prospective climate change has become a significant concern for the conservation of this species in such places, such as Ice Mountain in West Virginia, a low-elevation algific talus slope with persisting buried ice. Cultural references Rue Linnea Borealis, Cogne (Aosta Valley) Linnaeus took Linnaea borealis as his own personal symbol when he was raised to the Swedish nobility in 1757. In his ' (1737), Linnaeus had used Gronovius's name Linnaea as an example to advocate the use of commemorative personal names as botanical names: The flower of Linnaea borealis is the provincial flower of Småland,Visit Småland Retrieved 25 February 2012. the home province of Linnaeus.

When the radar transmits a burst of energy some of that energy is reflected off a target and is received back at the radar and processed to determine range and angle.

Basic radars present the target information on a display and displayed targets are referred to as blips. Based on the relative size of the blips on the display, a radar operator could determine large targets from small targets. When a blip enhancing technique is used, small targets returns are augmented to look like large targets. One early maritime application of this technique was used with an aircraft carrier and its escort ships. Because the aircraft carrier physically dwarfed the other vessels its radar return was much larger making it relatively easy for a radar operator to pick it out as a target. Escort ships were fitted with blip enhance transmitters that received and amplified the radar signal so that all of the escort ships looked like they were aircraft carrier-sized targets. When all the escort ships activated their blip enhance transmitters, all the ships blips grew on the radar display masking the true aircraft carrier blip, and confusing any attempt to target the aircraft carrier for a missile attack.

PyMusique PyMusique was written by Travis Watkins, Cody Brocious, and Jon Lech Johansen for the purpose of allowing downloading songs from the iTunes Music Store before DRM was applied to them from a Mac, Linux, or Windows computer. It was first released via Johansen's website on March 18, 2005. Although the iTunes Music Store's method of applying FairPlay DRM to the songs was widely known, PyMusique was the first program to exploit a loophole in the system, allowing users to download songs without the DRM restriction. On March 22, 2005, Apple released an update that rendered PyMusique non-functional. The same day, a new version of PyMusique was released that worked again, only without Windows compatibility. On March 31, 2005, Johansen released SharpMusique, the Windows-compatible port of PyMusique. PyMusique also allowed songs to be re-downloaded for free, in case a user accidentally deleted their purchase. Within a number of days, Apple broke the client by forcing all users to upgrade to iTunes 4.9. In response to Apple's actions, Johansen released PyMusique version 0.4 on March 22, 2005 , which allows users once again to use PyMusique with Apple's store. With the launch of 0.4, developer Cody Brocious stated on his blog that no future versions of PyMusique would be released with Microsoft Windows support. SharpMusique In September 2005, Jon Lech Johansen released SharpMusique, written in C#, which took over where PyMusique left off. The program was kept updated until version 1.0, at which point it was no longer updated. The iTunes protocol changed, and users of SharpMusique were able to release primitive patches to account for the changes until mid-2006, when the protocol changed drastically. Around this time, without public announcement, the download links for SharpMusique and its source were removed from Johansen's website. As a result, it is no longer easily available.

It was written by Brian King and directed by Vincenzo Natali. Jeremy Northam plays an accountant whose hope for a career in corporate espionage takes an unexpected turn. The film was shown in limited release in theaters in the US and Australia, and released on DVD on August 2, 2005. The film received mixed reviews, and Northam received the Best Actor award at the Sitges Film Festival. Plot Morgan Sullivan (Northam), a recently unemployed accountant, is bored with his suburban life. Pressured by his wife to take a job with her father's company, he instead pursues a position in corporate espionage. Digicorp's Head of Security, Finster (Bennett), inducts Morgan and assigns him a new identity. As Jack Thursby, he is sent to conventions to secretly record presentations and transmit them to headquarters. Sullivan is soon haunted by recurring nightmares and neck pain. When he meets Rita Foster (Liu) from a competing corporation, his life starts to become complicated. Rita gives him pills to cure his pain and nightmares and tells him not to transmit at the next convention. After the convention, Digicorp confirms the receipt of his transmission, though Morgan had sent nothing. Sure that something strange is going on, Morgan takes the pills Rita gave him and finds that they work. Confused by what is going on, and intrigued by Rita, he arranges to meet with her again. At the meeting, she tells him about Digicorp's deception and offers him an antidote – a green liquid in a large syringe. Morgan hesitantly accepts. She warns him that no matter what happens at the next convention he must not react. Morgan discovers that all the convention attendees are spies as he is, all thinking themselves individual spies working for Digicorp. While they are drugged from the served drinks, plastic-clad scientists probe, inject and brainwash them. Individual headsets reinforce their new identities, preparing them to be used and then disposed of. Morgan manages to convince Digicorp that he believes his new identity. He is then recruited by Sunway Systems, a rival of Digicorp. Sunway's Head of Security, Callaway (Webber), encourages Morgan to act as a double agent, feeding corrupted data to Digicorp. Morgan calls Rita, who warns him that Sunway is equally ruthless, and that he is in fact being used by Rita's boss, Sebastian Rooks. Morgan manages to steal the required information from Sunway Systems' vault, escaping with Rita's help. Rita ultimately takes him to meet Rooks. When she temporarily leaves the room, a nervous Morgan calls Finster, and becomes even more distressed. He accidentally shoots Rita, who encourages him to ignore her and meet Rooks in the room next door. Morgan finds the room filled with objects which appear to be personal to him, including a photograph of him and Rita together. Realising that he is apparently Rooks, he turns to Rita in disbelief. Before Rita can convince him, the apartment is invaded by armed men. Rita and Morgan escape to the roof of the skyscraper as the security teams of Digicorp and Sunway meet, led by Finster and Callaway. After a short Mexican standoff both sides realise they are after the same person, Sebastian Rooks, and rush to the roof, where they find Morgan and Rita in a helicopter. Rita cannot fly it, but, having designed it himself, Sebastian can after Rita encourages him to remember his past self, connecting through his love for her. He lifts off amid gunfire from the security teams. Finster and Callaway comment as the couple seem to have escaped: :Callaway: \\"Did you get a look at him? Did you see Rooks' face?\\" :Finster: \\"Just Morgan Sullivan, our pawn.\\" Looking up, they see the helicopter hovering and realise, too late, the true identity of Morgan Sullivan. Sebastian triggers a bomb, causing the whole roof to explode. On a boat in the South Pacific Ocean, Sebastian reveals the content of the stolen disc to Rita. Marked \\"terminate with extreme prejudice\\", it is the last copy of Rita's identity (after the one in the vault was destroyed). Sebastian throws the disc into the sea and says, \\"Now there's no copy at all.\\" CastReception The film received mixed reviews. According to film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 58% critic rating average from 19 reviews. Derek Elley of Variety called the film \\"consistently intriguing\\" and \\"100% plot driven\\" with excellent performances from the cast, while BBC's Neil Smith compared Cypher to The Manchurian Candidate, and noticed feelings of tension and claustrophobia, as in Natali's directorial début Cube, finally concluding that \\"Natali his yarn in an Orwellian atmosphere of paranoia.\\" Scott Weinberg, reviewing for DVD Talk, recommended the film, calling it \\"one of the best direct-to-video titles [he has] seen all year\\", noting similarities to The Matrix, Dark City and the works of Philip K. Dick. English horror fiction writer and journalist Kim Newman, writing for the Empire magazine, awarded the film 4 out of 5 stars, praising Northam's and Liu's performances and calling the film a \\"semi- science-fictional exercise in puzzle-setting and solving\\". Some critics found problems with the film's complex narrative. Paul Byrnes of The Sydney Morning Herald found that the plot overwhelmed the characters so much that he \\"stopped caring\\".Byrnes, Paul (August 14, 2003). Cypher review Sydney Morning Herald (Australia). Retrieved 2010-07-25. John J. Puccio, writing for Movie Metropolis, thought that \\"[Cyphers] corporate espionage plot doesn't prove simply too complicated, it ends up downright muddled\\", but concluded that the film was nevertheless \\"still kind of fun\\". For his performance in Cypher, Jeremy Northam received the Best Actor award on the 2002 Sitges Film Festival in Catalonia.

As a commissioned captain fighting the British in the American Revolutionary War, he captured 24 ships in the eastern Atlantic between May 1777 and May 1778, bringing the expenses associated with British shipping to a then all-time high. He has been called \\"the most successful of all Continental Navy captains\\".Tim McGrath. Give Me a Fast Ship. NAL Caliber, 2014. Picture caption between pp. 274 & 275\\\\. Early life Conyngham's story begins in a typical fashion for the era. Born in County Donegal, Ireland, in 1747,Mark L. Hayes. \\"Gustavus Conyngham\\" in E. Gordon Bowen- Hassell et al. Sea Raiders of the American Revolution: the Continental Navy in European Waters. Government Printing Office. p. 16. John C. Fredriksen. Revolutionary War Almanac. Infobase Publishing, 2006. p. 332. he came to British America in 1763 seeking a better life. Conyngham immigrated to Philadelphia in order to work for his cousin Redmond Conyngham in the shipping industry. He abandoned school at a young age, sensing that his destiny lay not in the academic world, but on the oceans. Here he learned and perfected his seamanship skills, becoming an apprentice to Captain Henderson, who became a surrogate father to the young Gustavus. Eventually Conyngham progressed enough to be given charge over his own craft, the Charming Peggy. When the Revolutionary War began in 1775, he immediately sailed to Europe to try to procure supplies needed for the war effort. Escape from the British Because Great Britain was patrolling for any arms deals, he had arranged a transaction with Dutch traders in order to safely transfer the goods. However, he was caught in becalmed winds for too long – the British were able to find him based on a tip from a mutinous sailor. Andrew Frazer, the English official in charge of Conyngham's arrest, placed a guard on board the Charming Peggy and ordered her to set sail for England as soon as the winds prevailed. However, once the weather turned, Conyngham and his crew overpowered the guard and made a daring escape. Despite their best efforts though, the wind died shortly after, leaving them stranded once again. This time, instead of waiting to be captured, Conyngham sold the Charming Peggy to the Dutch government in order to be able to purchase a new ship when under less suspicion. However, due to corruption and embezzlement within the government itself, he was never given any profits from the sale of his ship, and was forced to find another way to accomplish his mission. Obtaining the Surprise After the loss of his ship, Conyngham headed to France, hoping to connect with an ally to the United States. It was there he met Benjamin Franklin, a man who would help him in his adventures many times in the future. They formed a lasting relationship, and Conyngham eventually awarded Franklin the nickname \\"the Philosopher\\" for his intellectual fortitude and resourcefulness. Franklin had been entrusted with several commissions of the Continental Navy, and on March 1, 1777, Conyngham was appointed as captain of the lugger Surprise. He quickly went to work, heading towards the narrow English Channel and capturing the Prince of Orange and the Joseph within a week. The Prince of Orange was holding mostly mail, so he sent it to Dunkirk to be unloaded, but the Joseph was holding more valuable cargo such as wine and oranges, and was sent to France as a prize. Unfortunately for Conyngham, France had a treaty with England that forbade the selling of commandeered good in French ports, and when Lord Stormont, an English official, heard of Conyngham's actions he demanded that France return the Joseph and arrest him. Not ready to commit to a war with England, French officials bowed to Lord Stormont's demands, turning over the Joseph and calling for Conyngham's arrest. He was sent to a French prison under charges of piracy. Success aboard the Revenge Again, it was Conyngham's friend \\"The Philosopher\\" that came to his rescue. Recognizing that Conyngham was a talented sailor from his clever avoidance of the British within their own channel, Franklin set about obtaining a new ship for him. However, this was no easy task in Europe at the time – England was watching the construction of new ships and was prepared to burn any vessel they felt was being built to aid the American cause. Therefore, the ship was built as the Greyhound, and Franklin had installed false buyers in order to further confound the English. One of the buyers, Richard Hodge, then sailed the ship into the ocean, where Conyngham boarded it and took command, renaming the vessel Revenge. Having more tonnage, maneuverability, and firepower than the Surprise, Conyngham immediately set to work terrorizing British shipping with twice the ferocity of before. It was here that he earned his nickname \\"the Dunkirk Pirate\\", ignoring his written orders to proceed directly to the American coastline for logistical support and resupply and instead heading directly to Dunkirk to begin his cruise against the British. In his first cruise, he averaged one ship every three days, sinking or capturing over twenty ships during his two-month stay in the Baltic and North Sea. He then sailed to Cap Ferrol in order to resupply and replace his crew. He then headed to the West Indies, continuing to use Spain as his primary base of operations. Over the next eighteen months he captured or sunk sixty ships, causing a 10% rise in British shipping insurance rates between Dover and Calais. This brought the expenses associated with shipping to their all-time highest level, outpacing their rates even during England's wars with France and Spain. Dozens of merchants resorted to paying French and Dutch ships to carry their goods for fear of the Dunkirk Pirate's vengeance. It was reported that the King of England himself said that it would give him great pleasure to be present at the hanging of Conyngham, if he could only catch him. Even the weather could not contain him. When his ship was badly damaged by a storm in English waters, he disguised the Revenge and sailed into an English port to be repaired, reverting to his native Irish tongue to maintain anonymity. When Conyngham was offered a seventy-four gun Spanish vessel for protection against two small British ships that planned to ambush him, he \\"thanked him for his offer, but told him he was not afraid of fifty of their boats, all he wished is that they might make the attempt, and if they did, they would never live to make another.\\" Conyngham's reign of destruction off of the English coastline only ended when he captured a ship carrying valuable wartime supplies, which he deemed worthy of an escort to American shores. He arrived in Philadelphia on 21 February 1779 with his goods in tow. It was then that his luck began to turn sour. First return to America and imprisonment It is ironic that the first friendly port Conyngham had seen in years would treat him so poorly. Though the local newspapers hailed him as a returning war hero, the Continental Congress was less than pleased with his disobedience to orders and his loss of his original commission, which had been confiscated by the French during his brief stay in their prison. Adding to this, as Conyngham was not the owner of the Revenge, it was sold at a private auction. Nevertheless, because Conyngham had been so successful as her captain, he was again given command with orders to raid British shipping for a private profit. However, during one of his first cruises he was unable to outrun the British warship , and was taken aboard as a prisoner. As his notoriety had grown since his last capture, the British treated him very poorly. By his own report he was kept in irons until he reached prison, and was given no more than a \\"cold plank as my bed, a stone for a pillow\\". Additionally, he was not fed properly, causing him to lose fifty pounds while imprisoned on the ship en route to his English prison. Since he did not have a commission at the time, and he was arrested on charges of piracy and sent to the English prison at Pendennis Castle from which he escaped, only to be caught again and transferred to Mill Prison, Plymouth. He was kept in irons continuously at both Pendennis Castle and Mill Prison. In fact, it was only by the watchful hand of Benjamin Franklin that Conyngham was kept from the gallows. Franklin wrote to General George Washington about Conyngham's missing commission, and Washington wrote to the British saying that if Conyngham met with the noose, he would hang six of the British officers he had captured . However, despite these conditions, he refused to accept the invitation to leave prison by joining the British Navy. In fact, while in prison he aided in the creation of a document stating that each member who signed would not leave the American cause regardless of how terrible the conditions became. Conyngham was placed on trial for high treason, but before his sentence was determined and carried out he escaped. Conyngham and eleven other prisoners had broken into the prison vault allowing them to use tools to dig a tunnel extending \\"a considerable distance\\" underneath the outer wall of the prison. Had a boy's arm not been broken during the scramble for the exit, alerting the sentries, hundreds more prisoners may have escaped with him. Escape and return to America After his escape, Conyngham fled to Texel Island in the Netherlands to try to find a way back to America where he could potentially receive a new ship. His spirits were high – he reported later that he was amused by the portrayals of himself as a monster that he saw displayed all over London while in disguise. He planned on making his way back to France where he could again enlist the help of his friend Benjamin Franklin, but instead met with a stroke of luck. While he was resting in Texel, John Paul Jones arrived in port after his battle with the . Jones took him aboard, and they cruised together for several months until Conyngham left the Alliance at a Spanish port in order to board a ship headed for American shores. However, it was here that Conyngham's luck ran out once again. While aboard the Experiment en route to America, he was recaptured by the British on 17 March 1780, and sent back to Mill Prison in Plymouth. He remained there until his release due to a political prisoner exchange. This time, he headed for Ostend, where he obtained the armed vessel Layona, which he prepared to go cruising in once again. However, he received news of a treaty, and instead boarded the , which was on its way back to his hometown of Philadelphia. Later service and death In many ways, his second return to the United States earned him a colder welcome than the last. The Continental Congress refused to pay him properly for his work because of his inability to produce his commission, which had been confiscated from him by the French almost three years ago. Because Benjamin Franklin had given him an official commission, he was not merely a privateer, but an actual Captain in the United States Navy. As such, he was entitled to two-twentieths of the value of the ships he took as prizes. As he could not produce his commission, and Benjamin Franklin died before he could give proper testimony of Conyngham's commissioning, the Continental Congress refused to pay him what he was due, and instead treated him as a common privateer during his earliest and most successful raids. However, despite his quarrels with the government, he still continued to serve his country. During the Quasi-War with the French, he captained the Maria, an armed merchant vessel, bringing much needed supplies to the front lines. Towards the end of his life, he was elected to the Common Council of Philadelphia, and managed to raise thirty thousand dollars in loans from the population in order to defend the city during the War of 1812. He never allowed his quarrels with politicians to come between his commitment to his country. He died quietly in his home on 27 November 1819. Nearly a century later, John Barnes, a retired navy captain and naval historian, acquired a cache of autographs and documents from a sale by Charavay of Paris.James Barnes.

It is the oldest registered society of, and funded by, the University of York Students' Union. Nouse was founded in 1964 by student Nigel Fountain, some twenty years before its rival York Vision. The newspaper is printed three times in each of the Autumn and Spring terms, and twice in the Summer term, with frequent website updates in between print runs. As of January 2020, Nouse has printed 491 editions. Unlike many other university newspapers, which have sabbatical editors, Nouse′s staff is made up entirely of current students. It has changed dramatically in outlook and presentation over the years, being known at one point as the Nouse Co- operative or NouseCoop, and presenting itself as a samizdat publication throughout the 1980s. The last edition of the 2006–07 academic year was printed in full-size broadsheet format, but it is now printed in a tabloid size. It nonetheless remains distinguished from its campus rival York Vision in layout and tone. In the last few years Nouse has become the University's largest media society, picking up multiple nominations and wins in the National Student Journalism Awards and Guardian Student Media Awards. In April 2019, Nouse hosted the Student Publication Association National Conference in York, which featured the organisation's national awards night, and was attended by student journalists from across the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. Prominent members of the journalism industry delivered talks over the weekend including Jim Waterson and Owen Jones.

History In 1860 the Russian Tsar Alexander II granted permission for Norwegian settlements on the Kola. Around 1870, scores of families from Finnmark in northern Norway departed for the Kola coast, attracted by the prospects of fishing and trade. The Russian authorities granted them privileges to trade with Norway. Most of them settled in Tsyp- Navolok on the easternmost tip of the Rybachiy Peninsula (; – both terms meaning \\"Fishermen's Peninsula\\"). Others settled in Vaydaguba () at the northwestern tip – Cape Nemetskiy (, \\"Cape German\\") – of the same peninsula. A vibrant society developed while retaining contact with Norway, especially with the town of Vardø. Some settlers returned to Norway shortly after the Russian Revolution of 1917, but most of them remained at Tsyp-Navolok. In 1917 perhaps about 1000 lived on the Kola. On 23 June 1940, Lavrenty Beria of the NKVD ordered the Murmansk Oblast, encompassing the entire Kola Peninsula, to be cleaned of \\"foreign nationals\\". As a result, the entire Norwegian population was deported for resettlement in the Karelo-Finnish SSR. Soon they had to move from there too, because of pressures caused by the Finnish invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. In spring 1942, a large proportion died of starvation and malnutrition. Despite many having served in the Red Army, they were not allowed to return home to the Kola after the end of the Second World War. Many children were raised without learning to speak Norwegian. Recent history After 1992, some descendants of the original settlers began to emphasize their family backgrounds, although only a few had been able to maintain a rusty knowledge of the Vardø dialect of the Norwegian language. Some have now migrated to Norway. There are special provisions in Norwegian immigration law which ease this process, albeit generally being less permissive than those which pertain in other countries which operate a \\"right of return\\". In order to obtain a permit to move to Norway and work there, a foreign citizen must show an adequate connection to the country, such as having two or more grandparents who were born there. As for citizenship, it is awarded on the same basis as to anyone else -- which basis includes the formal renunciation of the original citizenship. By 2004, approximately 200 Kola Norwegians had settled in Norway. In 2007, the small village of Port-Vladimir (ru), the last stronghold of the Kola Norwegians lost its official recognition due to depopulation. Only 98 individuals identified themselves as Norwegians in the 2010 census of Russia, including 20 in St. Petersburg, 11 in Murmansk, and 4 in Karelia.

Bad Aussee serves as the economic and cultural center of the Styrian part of the Salzkammergut lakes region. With a population of 4,862, the town is said to be the geographical midpoint of Austria, symbolized by a stone monument in the centre of town. Together with other Alpine towns Bad Aussee engages in the Alpine Town of the Year Association for the implementation of the Alpine Convention to achieve sustainable development in the Alpine Arc. Bad Aussee was awarded Alpine Town of the Year 2010. History Prehistoric artifacts were discovered in the nearby Salzofenhöhle cave. The town began to flourish in the Middle Ages, when salt works started operating in the late thirteenth century. Bad Aussee was designated a market town in 1295. The Romanesque and late Gothic Stadtpfarrkirche St. Paul (parish church) dates from the thirteenth century and contains a Gothic Madonna from 1420. The sacrament house dates from 1523. The Spitalkirche (hospital church) on Meranplatz square was erected before 1395 and contains two Gothic altarpieces with movable wings from the fifteenth century and frescoes. Other important historical buildings include the Kammerhof, which was built before 1200. Until 1926, it housed the salt administration for the region. Charming houses that date from the fifteenth century surround the Kurpark and the harmonious center of town. Bad Aussee was the birthplace of Anna Plochl, a postman's daughter who became the wife of Archduke Johann of Austria, whose economic, cultural, and educational impact on Styria and the Salzkammergut is still remembered by the people. A statue of the beloved archduke stands in the centre of the Kurpark in Bad Aussee. The town was built up and around the salt industry. Bad Aussee in 1892 Tourism Today, the town's primary focus is on culture and tourism. Bad Aussee has a fine regional museum, the Kammerhofmuseum , which has exhibits regarding local traditions and customs, the salt trade and a collection of fossils found in the region. There is also a spa in the city centre, Vital Bad Aussee , that offers medicinal brine baths and the Kneipp Cure therapy, which was invented by the German priest Sebastian Kneipp. This therapy combines cold-water treatment, diets, and outdoor exercise. The town also sponsors a music festival that runs for several weeks in the spring of each year, called the Ausseer Jazzfrühling. There are two ski regions accessible from Bad Aussee: Loser and Tauplitz . The Loser Ski Region boasts an amazing view of the Dachstein Glacier and has been recently modernized. At the Tauplitz Ski Region, you can also go cross-country skiing or sledding in the evening. Lakes There are five lakes nearby Bad Aussee. The Lake Altaussee The Lake Grundlsee Lake Altaussee () is a picturesque body of water perched at the foot of the Loser mountain. There is a well-groomed footpath encircling the lake and the village of Altaussee rests on its shores. Sommersbergersee is a smaller lake, which is not as deep as the other bodies of water in the region and is, as such, suitable for swimming at a much earlier date every year. Lake Grundlsee, sometimes called das Steirische Meer (the Styrian Sea), is the largest lake in the state of Styria. At Grundlsee, you can rent an electric boat by the hour and there are public beaches distributed around it. Grundlsee is fed by two smaller lakes, Lake Toplitz (German: Toplitzsee) and Kammersee. Toplitzsee, where the Nazis both tested weapons and allegedly dumped counterfeited currency, is the source of much local lore in the region. It is unique in that it has two layers of water, an upper one composed of fresh water and one beneath it made of salt water. Kammersee is designated as the origin of the River Traun and can actually only be reached by boat from Toplitzsee. A small business offers guided tours to Kammersee in so-called Plätten, a flat-bottomed boats unique to the region, that were once used in the salt trade. During the reign of Maria Theresa, convicts chiseled an opening in the stone separating Kammersee from Toplitzsee in order to aid in the transportation of lumber. Culture and traditions Fasching= The biggest yearly event in Bad Aussee occurs on Faschingsdienstag (Shrove Tuesday), when the Flinserln dress up in sequined costumes and parade through town to announce the coming of spring. Children recite old rhymes to the Flinserln and are rewarded with nuts or sweets. The Flinserln are accompanied by the Zacharin, who keep spectators in line by waving pig bladders on the ends of sticks and occasionally rapping people on the head with them. The celebration is rounded off by the Trommelweiber (Drum Women). The Trommelweiber are a group of men dressed in women's nightgowns, who go from inn to inn banging on drums, pots and pans, and enjoy the free food and beer. According to the tale, the tradition of the Trommelweiber was initiated in the last century as a way for men who frequented pubs to poke fun at their wives: at the time, women were not allowed in such establishments and often resorted to banging on pots and pans outside of the premises in order to get their husbands to come out, come home and dry up. Inns, pubs and restaurants are heavily frequented during the Heilige Drei Faschingstage (the three 'holy' days of Fasching) by costumed revelers known as Maschgera. =Narzissenfest= Bad Aussee's other major yearly event is the Narzissenfest (Narcissus Festival). Every spring, on the last weekend in May, participants construct massive floral sculptures made from daffodil blossoms, and parade them through town on large floats, accompanied by regional folk music. Some of these floral sculptures are later displayed along the shores of Grundlsee or Altausseersee, alternating from one year to the next. =Glöckler und Berigeln= Another local custom takes place on 5 January. During the day, children, called Glöckler, go door to door with little bells and sacks and receive Faschingskrapfen (donuts), oranges, chocolate or nuts. In the evening, it's the adults' turn! They take to the streets dressed as Berigeln, in raggedy traditional dress clothes, their faces covered with a black clothe mask. They carry with them large cow bells, with which they announce their arrival in front of those who open their homes to the Berigeln. Once the Berigeln enter a home, they refrain from speaking in order to conceal their identity. Usually the host tries to guess their identity, as they proceed to fill them up with home-made schnapps, beer, Faschingskrapfen, and other foods. Tracht Bad Aussee is unique within Austria as its inhabitants wear Tracht, or traditional dress, on a daily basis. For women, this consists of a Dirndl, a type of dress with a fitted bodice and full skirt. Many women choose to wear an Ausseerdirndl, which has a green bodice, a rose-colored skirt and a purple apron.

It is located on the Armadale/Thornlie line and the Midland line, 1.3 kilometres from Perth station serving the suburb of East Perth. History Opened in 1883 under the name East Perth, Claisebrook station is a busy junction along the Midland and Armadale/Thornlie lines due to both lines running through the station and the Claisebrook railway depot being next door. The original railway station was built in timber with hardwood weatherboarding and external and timber lining. Rendered brick fireplaces were built in two of the rooms - possibly the waiting rooms and railway staff room and had very elegant rendered chimney caps providing a balance to the roof. The Battye library carries the original plans and shows exposed heavy timber trussing of the roof which was very typical of the architecture of railway buildings of the era. The roofing was corrugated iron curved to provide a concave upper surface with the roof overhanging the tracks and providing cover to passengers leaving and arriving at the station. As railway rolling stock grew taller the wide eaves and the timber trussing of the roof were trimmed back giving the roof a truncated appearance. The station was located centrally between the east and west bound tracks and provided access to both. In 1984 the station was relocated to Whiteman Park to be the Central Station on the light railway system under construction in the majority by the Western Australian Light Railway Preservation Association and the Metropolitan Region Planning Authority funded under Wage Pause and Community Employment Programmes. In 1969, a new railway terminal was built 600 m away on the Midland line called East Perth, and caused this station to be renamed Claisebrook after a watercourse that is near the station. Between 2002 and 2003 the station was mostly rebuilt with new station structures, signage, platform finishes and a footbridge. Platforms The current platforms are currently in use at Claisebrook: Bus connections Claisebrook Station at night Connections are available by Yellow CAT, which serves throughout East Perth, West Perth, and the City's centre corridor.

In 2002, Sigel and much of the Roc-A-Fella roster starred in State Property.State Property (2002) . IMDB.com Its release coincided with the creation and promotion of State Property, a group of Philadelphia artists signed to Roc-A-Fella, who were organized by Sigel and Freeway. Its members included Peedi Crakk, the Young Gunz (Neef Buck & Young Chris), Oschino and Omillio Sparks. Their first collaboration was for the movie's soundtrack, an eponymous release that featured the original \\"Roc the Mic\\" by Sigel and Freeway. 2003's The Chain Gang Vol. 2 followed, featuring the single \\"Can't Stop, Won't Stop\\" by the Young Gunz. The record was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group.\\"Jay-Z, Beyonce, Outkast, Pharrell Nab Most Grammy Nominations\\" , Jon Wiederhorn, VH-1, December 4, 2003. In 2005, before serving a one-year prison sentence stemming from an earlier arrest, Sigel shot multiple videos, directed by Joe Briscella, and finished his third album The B. Coming. During this time, Sigel's label head at Roc-A-Fella, Jay-Z, became president of its parent label, Def Jam, which caused former business partners Damon Dash and Kareem \\"Biggs\\" Burke to leave and form the Dame Dash Music Group. Dame Dash Music Group and Def Jam released Sigel's The B. Coming rather than Roc-A-Fella, but it still contained production from a slew of Roc/Jay Z-affiliated producers including Chad West, The Neptunes, Just Blaze, Boola, and Buckwild. Sigel recruited cross–label MC talent for his album as well, including Cam'ron and Jay-Z. Sigel's record produced a hit track, \\"Feel it in the Air\\", and sold 131,000 copies in its first week. Advertising his friendship with the incarcerated Sigel, Dash publicly claimed that he was leaving the Roc-A-Fella roster to join him. Sigel's group, State Property was thrown into turmoil, but eventually chose to remain at Roc-A-Fella—apparently against Sigel's wishes. On his release, Sigel questioned the loyalty of his group and said that he was signing with Dame and Biggs due to a stronger relationship with the pair than with Jay-Z: > I've never been around Jay on an off day. It ain't like I made a choice of > running with Dame and Biggs or 'Dame and Biggs held me down through my whole > trial.' It's not that. I would be a sucker if I said I [signed with the > Damon Dash Music Group] because they did that for me. It's love. You see how > we chillin' now, this ain't about no business. Soon after, he clarified his comments, saying he simply did not want to be involved in the conflict, and elected to re-open talks with Roc-A-Fella instead of moving to Dame Dash Music Group.

In 2004, Sigel was convicted of federal weapons charges and sentenced to one year and one day in federal prison. Sigel was shot multiple times during a robbery in Philadelphia on May 25, 2006. He was able to flee the scene and drive himself to a local hospital. This was one month after being released from prison after serving a brief stint for child support charges. On August 15, 2009, Sigel was arrested on a drug possession charge while traveling to a concert in New Jersey. He was found in possession of nearly of marijuana in his vehicle. Sigel was charged in 2010 with three counts of failing to file tax returns on income of over $1 million between 2003–2005. He pled guilty to the charges and was sentenced to 25 months in prison. On August 29, 2012, two weeks before reporting to prison, Sigel was arrested again in Philadelphia on drug, weapons, and conspiracy charges after being pulled over by police. Officers found a fully loaded .38-caliber Smith & Wesson handgun inside the vehicle, as well as $4,500 in cash, an unlabeled bottle of codeine cough syrup, and various pills. Sigel began his 24-month sentence for failing to file tax returns at the Federal Detention Center, Philadelphia on September 12, 2012.. Additionally, he was sentenced six to 23 months in county jail for illegal possession of prescription drugs, to be served concurrently with his federal sentence. On August 14, 2014, Sigel was released from Federal Correctional Institution, Schuylkill and was reported to be serving out the rest of his sentence in a halfway house in Philadelphia. Sigel was wounded in a drive-by shooting outside his Pleasantville, New Jersey home on December 5, 2014. He was rushed to the hospital where he had a lung removed due to complications during surgery. According to police, Sigel was not the intended victim. Discography ;Studio albums * The Truth (2000) * The Reason (2001) * The B.

Vita  Education = In the mid-1970s Liedtke studied for a diploma degree in mathematics at the Bielefeld University. His thesis project was to build a compiler for the ELAN programming language, which had been launched for teaching programming in German schools; the compiler was written in ELAN itself. = Post grad = After his graduation in 1977, he remained at Bielefeld and worked on an Elan environment for the Zilog Z80 microprocessor. This required a run-time environment, which he called Eumel (\\"Extendable Multiuser Microprocessor ELAN-System\\", but also a colloquial north-German term for a likeable fool). Eumel grew into a complete multi-tasking, multi-user operating system supporting orthogonal persistence, which started shipping (by whoom? to whoom?) in 1980 and was later ported to Zilog Z8000, Motorola 68000 and Intel 8086 processors. As these processors lacked memory protection, Eumel implemented a virtual machine which added the features missing from the hardware. More than 2000 Eumel systems shipped, mostly to schools but also to legal practices as a text-processing platform. In 1984, he joined the GMD (', the German National Research Center for Computer Science, which is now a part of the Fraunhofer Society), where he continued his work on Eumel. In 1987, when microprocessors supporting virtual memory became widely available in the form of the Intel 80386, Liedtke started to design a new operating system to succeed Eumel, which he called L3 (\\"Liedtke's 3rd system\\", after Eumel and the Algol 60 interpreter he had written in High School). L3 was designed to achieve better performance by using the latest hardware features, and was implemented from scratch. It was mostly backward-compatible with Eumel, thus benefiting from the existing Eumel ecosystem. L3 started to ship in 1989, with total deployment of at least 500. Both Eumel and L3 were microkernel systems, a popular design in the 1980s. However, by the early 1990s, microkernels had received a bad reputation, as systems built on top were performing poorly, culminating in the billion-dollar failure of the IBM Workplace OS. The reason was claimed to be inherent in the operating-system structure imposed by microkernels. Liedtke, however, observed that the message-passing operation (IPC), which is fundamentally important for microkernel performance, was slow in all existing microkernels, including his own L3 system. His conclusion was that radical re-design was required. He did this by re-implementing L3 from scratch, dramatically simplifying the kernel, resulting in an order-of-magnitude decrease in IPC cost. The resulting kernel was later renamed \\"L4\\". Conceptually, the main novelty of L4 was its complete reliance on external pagers (page fault handlers), and the recursive construction of address spaces. This led to a complete family of microkernels, with many independent implementations of the same principles. Liedtke also worked on computer architecture, inventing guarded page tables as a means of implementing a sparsely-mapped 64-bit address space.Jochen Liedtke. \\"Page Table Structures for Fine-Grain Virtual Memory\\", Technical Report 872, German National Research Center for Computer Science (GMD), October 1994. In 1996, Liedtke completed a PhD on guarded page tables at the Technical University of Berlin. In the same year he joined the Thomas J. Watson Research Center, where he continued to work on L4 (for political reason called the \\"Lava Nucleus\\" or short \\"LN\\", microkernels were not fashionable at IBM after the Workplace OS disaster). The main project during his IBM time was the Saw Mill project, which attempted to turn Linux into an L4-based multi-server OS. In April 1999 he took up the System Architecture Chair at the University of Karlsruhe. In Karlsruhe he continued to collaborate with IBM on Saw Mill, but at the same time worked on a new generation of L4 (\\"Version 4\\"). Several experimental kernels were developed during that time, including Hazelnut, the first L4 kernel that was ported (as opposed to re-implemented) to a different architecture (from x86 to ARM). Work on the new version was completed after his death by Liedtke's students Volkmar Uhlig, Uwe Dannowski and Espen Skoglund. It was released under the name \\"Pistachio\\" in 2002.

RTÉ News. 2 May 2014; accessed 17 May 2014. was a woman from Belfast, Northern Ireland, who was kidnapped and murdered by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and secretly buried in County Louth in the Republic of Ireland in 1972 after being accused by the IRA of passing information to British forces.McKittrick, David (2001), Lost Lives: The Stories of the Men, Women and Children who Died as a Result of the Northern Ireland Troubles. Random House. p. 301\\"Jean McConville: Ivor Bell to be prosecuted for aiding murder\\", BBC News, 4 June 2015 In 1999, the IRA acknowledged that it had killed McConville and eight others of the \\"Disappeared\\".\\"Jean McConville: The Disappeared mother-of-ten\\", BBC News, 1 May 2014. It claimed she had been passing information about republicans to the British Army in exchange for money and that a transmitter had been found in her apartment. A report by the Police Ombudsman found no evidence for this or other rumours. Before the Troubles, the IRA had a policy of killing informers within its own ranks; however, from the start of the conflict the term informer was also used for civilians who were suspected of providing information on paramilitary organisations to the security forces. Other Irish republican and loyalist paramilitaries also carried out such killings.Melaugh, Martin. Killings of Alleged Informers, cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 5 May 2014. As she was a widowed mother of ten, the McConville killing was particularly controversial. Her body was not found until 2003, and the crime has not been solved. The Police Ombudsman found that the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) did not begin to investigate the disappearance properly until 1995. Biography Jean Murray was born on 7 May 1934 to a Protestant family in East Belfast but converted after marrying Arthur McConville, a Catholic former British Army soldier,Police Ombudsman: Report (2006) into complaint by James and Michael McConville regarding the police investigation into the abduction and murder of their mother, Mrs Jean McConville (Page 3), cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 7 May 2014. with whom she had ten children. After being intimidated out of a Protestant district by loyalists in 1969, the McConville family moved to West Belfast's Divis Flats in the Lower Falls Road.David McKittrick. The London Independent. 25 September 2003 Arthur died from cancer in January 1972. At the time of her death, Jean McConville lived at 1A St Jude's Walk, which was part of the Divis Flats complex.Police Ombudsman's report (2006), p.2 This was an IRA stronghold, from which attacks were regularly launched against the British Army and RUC. Since the death of her husband, she had been raising their ten children, who were aged between six and twenty. Their son Robbie was a member of the Official IRA and was interned in Long Kesh at the time of her death; he would defect to the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) in 1974. =Killing= In the months leading up to her death, tension and suspicion grew between McConville and her neighbours. One night shortly before her disappearance, she was allegedly attacked after leaving a bingo hall and warned to stop giving information to the British Army.Police Ombudsman's report (2006), p.4 According to police records, on 29 November 1972 a British Army unit found a distressed woman wandering in the street. She told them her name was McConville and that she had been attacked and warned to stop informing. One of McConville's children claimed she was kidnapped the night after this incident, but others gave the date of the kidnapping as 7 December. On the night of her disappearance, four young women took McConville from her home at gunpoint, and she was driven to an unknown location. Dolours Price claimed that she was one of those involved in driving her across the border. McConville was killed by a gunshot to the back of the head; there was no evidence of any other injuries to her body. Her body was secretly buried across the border on Shelling Hill Beach (also known as Templetown Beach) at the south-eastern tip of the Cooley Peninsula in the north of County Louth, about 50 miles from her home. The place of her death is uncertain. Although no group admitted responsibility for her disappearance, there were rumours that the IRA had killed her for being an informer. Another rumour is that she was killed because neighbours claimed they saw her helping a badly wounded British soldier outside her home; McConville's children say they recall her helping a wounded British soldier some time before their father died in January 1972.Police Ombudsman's report (2006), p.7 In a 2014 interview published in the Sunday Life, former Irish republican Evelyn Gilroy claimed the person who had tended to the soldier was her [Gilroy's] sister.\\"My sister lived five doors from Jean McConville in Farset Walk in the flats. Weeks before Jean was killed, a soldier was hit on the head by a brick thrown by a local lad. My sister heard him crying. She was a very soft, warm woman and she brought him into the hallway and gave him a glass of water. \\"Her act of compassion didn't go down well with some. 'Touts Out' and 'Soldier Lover' was painted on her door. The incident was reported to the media. My sister gave an interview to Downtown Radio about her act of mercy and the intimidation that followed.\\" 'Arrest Gerry Adams now' - former republican prisoner breaks her silence on IRA murder of Jean McConville, Evelyn Gilroy interview, Sunday Life, 24 April 2014; accessed 5 May 2014. The IRA did not admit involvement until after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. It claimed she was killed because she was passing information about republicans to the British Army. Former IRA member Brendan Hughes claimed the IRA had searched her flat some time before her death and found a radio transmitter, which they confiscated.Moloney, Ed. Voices from the Grave: Two Men's War in Ireland. Faber and Faber, 2010. pp. 128-129 He and other former republicans interrogated her and claimed she admitted the British Army was paying her for information about republicans. Hughes claims that, because of her circumstances, they let her go with a warning. However, he claims when the IRA found she had resumed working for the British Army, it decided to \\"execute\\" her. Usually the bodies of informers were left in public as a warning, but the IRA secretly buried McConville, apparently because she was a widowed mother of ten. The IRA had first done this two months earlier, when it killed and buried two IRA members who were alleged to be working undercover for the British Military Reaction Force (MRF).McKittrick, Lost Lives, p. 275Dillon, Martin (2012). The Dirty War. Random House. pp. 49-51 =Aftermath= After her disappearance, McConville's seven youngest children, including six-year-old twins, survived on their own in the flat, cared for by their 15-year-old sister Helen. According to them, the hungry family was visited three weeks later by a stranger, who gave them McConville's purse, with 52 pence and her three rings in it. On 16 January 1973, the story of the abduction appeared on the front page of the Belfast Telegraph, under the headline \\"Snatched mother missing a month\\".Police Ombudsman's report (2006), pp. 5-6 The following day, the children were interviewed on the BBC television programme Scene Around Six. The children reported to the social services, and were immediately brought into local council care. The family was split up by social services. Among the consequences of the killing, McConville's orphaned son Billy was sent to De La Salle Brothers Boys' Home, Rubane House, Kircubbin, County Down, notorious for child abuse; he testified in 2014 to the Northern Ireland Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry, describing repeated sexual and physical abuse, and starvation, saying \\"Christians looking after young boys – maybe they were Christians, but to me they were devils disguised in that uniform.\\"UTV:Jean McConville's child 'abused at Rubane', 6 November 2014 Within two days of her kidnapping, one of her sons reported the incident to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the British Army. However, the Police Ombudsman did not find any trace of an investigation into the kidnapping during the 1970s or 1980s. An officer told the Ombudsman that CID investigations in that area of Belfast at that time were \\"restricted to the most serious cases\\". On 2 January 1973, the RUC received two pieces of information stating: \\"it is rumoured that Jean McConville had been abducted by the [IRA] because she is an informer\\".Police Ombudsman's report (2006), p. 10 In March 1973, information was received from the British Army, saying the kidnapping was an elaborate hoax and that McConville had left of her own free will. As a result, the RUC refused to accept that McConville was missing, preferring to believe an anonymous tip that she had absconded with a British soldier. The first investigation into her kidnapping appears to have taken place in 1995, when a team of RUC detectives was established to review the cases of all those who were thought to have been kidnapped during the conflict. In 1999, the IRA gave information on the whereabouts of her body.No evidence for McConville agent claim: O'Loan; accessed 7 May 2014. This prompted a prolonged search, co- ordinated by An Garda Síochána, the Republic of Ireland's police force, but no body was found. On the night of 26 August 2003, a storm washed away part of the embankment supporting the west side of Shelling Hill Beach car park, near the site of previous searches.\\"Body found was McConville: Gardaí\\"; accessed 7 May 2014. This exposed the body. On 27 August, it was found by passersby while they were walking on Shelling Hill Beach (also known as Templetown Beach) in County Louth, at the south-eastern tip of the Cooley Peninsula. McConville was subsequently reburied beside her husband Arthur in Holy Trinity Graveyard in Lisburn.\\"Jean McConville laid to rest after 31 years.\\" \\"Adams 'at heart' of IRA's most shameful killing campaign\\", guardian.co.uk; accessed 7 May 2014. InvestigationPolice Ombudsman's report= In April 2004 the inquest into McConville's death returned a verdict of unlawful killing. In 2006 the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Nuala O'Loan, published a report about the police's investigation of the murder. It concluded that the RUC did not investigate the murder until 1995, when it carried out a minor investigation. It found no evidence that she had been an informer, but recommended the British Government go against its long-standing policy regarding informers and reveal whether she was one.Police Ombudsman's report (2006), p.12 Journalist Ed Moloney called for the British Government to release war diaries relating to the Divis Flats area at the time. War diaries are usually released under the thirty-year rule, but those relating to Divis at the time of McConville's death are embargoed for almost ninety years.\\"Could British war diaries help solve the Jean McConville murder?\\". TheJournal.ie. 14 July 2013. The police have since apologised for its failure to investigate her abduction. In January 2005, Sinn Féin party chairman Mitchel McLaughlin claimed that the killing of McConville was not a crime, saying that she had been executed as a spy in a war situation.\\"Resignation call rejected\\". BBC News. This prompted Irish journalist Fintan O'Toole to write a rebuttal, arguing that the abduction and extrajudicial killing of McConville was clearly a \\"war crime by all accepted national and international standards\\". The IRA has since issued a general apology, saying it \\"regrets the suffering of all the families whose loved ones were killed and buried by the IRA\\". =PSNI investigation and Boston College tapes= In August 2006, the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), Sir Hugh Orde, stated that he was not hopeful anyone would be brought to justice over the murder, saying \\"[in] any case of that age, it is highly unlikely that a successful prosecution could be mounted.\\"IRA murder prosecution 'unlikely', BBC website, 14 August 2006. Boston College had launched an oral history project on the Troubles in 2001. It recorded interviews with republicans and loyalists about their involvement in the conflict, on the understanding that the tapes would not be released until after their deaths.\\"What are the Boston tapes?\\". BBC News, 1 May 2014. Two of the republican interviewees, Brendan Hughes and Dolours Price, both now deceased, admitted they were involved in McConville's kidnapping. Both became diehard opponents of the Good Friday Agreement and Sinn Féin's support of it. They saw Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams as a traitor for negotiating the agreement and persuading the IRA to end its campaign. In 2010, after Hughes's death, some of his statements were published in the book Voices from the Grave. He claimed McConville had admitted being an informer, and that Adams ordered her disappearance.\\"Gerry Adams ordered Jean McConville killing, says ex-IRA commander on tape\\", The Guardian, 3 November 2013; accessed 5 May 2014. In a 2010 newspaper article, Price also claimed McConville was an informer and that Adams ordered her disappearance,Documents at Boston College by Irish republicans; accessed 7 May 2014. which has been strenuously denied by Ed Moloney., thebrokenelbow.com; 14 November 2011. Price, who died in 2013, said she gave the interviews as revenge against Adams. Former republican prisoner Evelyn Gilroy, who lived near McConville, claimed Adams was an IRA commander and the only person who could have ordered the killing.\\"'Arrest Gerry Adams now' - former republican prisoner breaks her silence on IRA murder of Jean McConville\\", The Belfast Telegraph, 24 April 2014; accessed 5 May 2014. Adams has denied any role in the death of McConville. He said \\"the killing of Jean McConville and the secret burial of her body was wrong and a grievous injustice to her and her family\\". In 2011, the PSNI began a legal bid to gain access to the tapes. Acting on a request from the PSNI, the United States Justice Department tried to force Boston College to hand them over. Boston College had promised those interviewed that the tapes would not be released until after their deaths, and other interviewees said they feared retribution if the tapes were released. Following a lengthy court battle, the PSNI was given transcripts of interviews by Hughes and Price. =2014 arrests= In March and April 2014, the PSNI arrested a number of people over the kidnapping and killing of Jean McConville. Ivor Bell, former IRA Chief of Staff, was arrested in March 2014.\\"Man arrested in Northern Ireland over 1972 case of 'disappeared' mother\\", The Guardian, 18 March 2014; accessed 5 May 2014.

UTV News. 22 March 2014; accessed 5 May 2014.\\"Pensioner bailed over McConville murder\\" . UTV News. 26 March 2014; accessed 5 May 2014. In April, the PSNI arrested three people who were teenagers at the time of the kidnapping: a 56-year-old man and two women, aged 57 and 60. All were released without charge.\\"Man, 56, released in McConville case\\" . UTV News. 2 April 2014.\\"Further arrests over McConville murder\\" , UTV News, 17 April 2014; accessed 5 May 2014. Following Bell's arrest in March, there was media speculation that police would want to question Gerry Adams due to the claims made by Hughes and Price. Adams maintained he was not involved, but had his solicitor contact the PSNI to find whether they wanted to question him.\\"Adams contacts police over McConville\\" . UTV News, 24 March 2014; accessed 5 May 2014. On 30 April, after being contacted by the PSNI, Adams voluntarily arranged to be interviewed at Antrim PSNI Station. He was arrested and questioned for four days before being released without charge. A file was sent to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) to decide whether further action should be taken,\\"Gerry Adams freed in Jean McConville murder inquiry\\". BBC News. 4 May 2014. but there was \\"insufficient evidence\\" to charge him.\\"Reports: ‘Insufficient evidence’ on Adams\\" . Evening Echo. 6 May 2014. The arrest took place during an election campaign. Sinn Féin claimed that the timing of the arrest was politically motivated; an attempt to harm the party's chances in the upcoming elections. Alex Maskey said it was evidence of a \\"political agenda [...] a negative agenda\\" by elements of the PSNI. Jean McConville's family had campaigned for the arrest of Adams over the murder.Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams arrested over murder of widowed mother abducted in 1972 Her son Michael said: \\"Me and the rest of my brothers and sisters are just glad to see the PSNI doing their job. We didn't think it would ever take place [Mr Adams' arrest], but we are quite glad that it is taking place.\\"\\"Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams held over Jean McConville murder\\", bbc.co.uk; accessed 5 May 2014. In a later interview on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4, he stated that he knew the names of those who had abducted and killed his mother, but that: \\"I wouldn't tell the police [PSNI]. If I told the police now a thing, me or one of my family members or one of my children would get shot by those [IRA] people. It's terrible that we know those people and we can't bring them to justice.\\" =2019= On 21 February 2019, author Patrick Radden Keefe claims to have identified the IRA volunteer who pulled the trigger in the killing of McConville, while writing Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland about the event.
