Researchers create technology forecasts based on past experience and current technological developments. Like other forecasts, technology forecasting can be helpful for both public and private organizations to make smart decisions. By analyzing future opportunities and threats, the forecaster can improve decisions in order to achieve maximum benefits. Today, most countries are experiencing huge social and economic changes, which heavily rely on technology development. By analyzing these changes, government and economic institutions could make plans for future developments. However, not all of historical data can be used for technology forecasting, forecasters also need to adopt advanced technology and quantitative modeling from experts‚Äô researches and conclusions. History Technology forecasting has existed more than a century, but it developed to an established subject until World War II, because American government started to detect the technology development trend related to military area after the war. In 1945, the U.S. Army Air Forces created a report called Toward New Horizons, which surveyed the technology development and discussed the importance for future studies. The report is an indication for the beginning of modern technology forecasting. In the 1950s and 1960s, RAND Corporation developed the Delphi Technique and were widely accepted and used to make smart evaluation for the future. The applications of Delphi Technique are a turning point in the history of technology forecasting, because it became an efficient tool for knowledge building and decision-making, especially for social policy and public health issues. In the 1970s, private sector and government agencies out of military area widely adopted technology forecasting and helped to diversify the users and applications. As the developments of computing technology, advanced computer hardware and software facilitates the process of data sorting and data analysis.The development of Internet and networking is also beneficial for the data access and data transfer. Technology opportunities analysis started since 1990. Improved software can help analysts search and retrieve data information from large complicated database and then graphically represents interrelations. From 2000, more and more new requirements and challenges lead to the modern development of technology forecasting, such as prediction markets, alternate reality games, online forecasting communities and obsolescence forecasting. Important aspects Primarily, a technological forecast deals with the characteristics of technology, such as levels of technical performance, like speed of a military aircraft, the power in watts of a particular future engine, the accuracy or precision of a measuring instrument, the number of transistors in a chip in the year 2015, etc. The forecast does not have to state how these characteristics will be achieved. Secondly, technological forecasting usually deals with only useful machines, procedures or techniques. This is to exclude from the domain of technological forecasting those commodities, services or techniques intended for luxury or amusement. Thirdly, feasibility is a key element in technology forecasting. Forecasters should consider the cost and the level of difficulty of materialization of desires. For example, a computer-based approach ‚ÄúPattern‚Äù is an expensive forecasting method which is not recommended to been used in cases of restricted funds. Methods Commonly adopted methods of technology forecasting include the Delphi method, forecast by analogy, growth curves and extrapolation. Normative methods of technology forecasting‚Äîlike the relevance trees, morphological models, and mission flow diagrams‚Äîare also commonly used. Delphi method is widely used in technology forecasts because of its flexibility and convenience. However, requirement on reaching consensus is a possible disadvantage of Delphi method. Extrapolation can work well with enough effective historical data. By analyzing the past data, forecaster extend the past development tendency in order to extrapolate meaningful outcomes in the future. =Combining forecasts= Studies of past forecasts have shown that one of the most frequent reasons why a forecast goes wrong is that the forecaster ignores related fields. A given technical approach may fail to achieve the level of capability forecast for it, because it is superseded by another technical approach which the forecaster ignored. Another problem is that of inconsistency between forecasts. The inconsistency between forecasts reflects on the different locations and time used on controlled experiment. It usually produces inaccurate and unreliable data which leads to incorrect insight and faulty predictions. Because of these problems, it is often necessary to combine forecasts of different technologies. In addition, the use of more than one forecasting method often gives the forecaster more insight into the processes at work which are responsible for the growth of the technology being forecast. Combining forecasts can reduce errors compare with a singular forecast. In the case when researches face troubles to pick a typical forecast method, combining forecasts are always the best solution.

IoT System provides a strong platform to make predictive analysis in the post-Industry 4.0. The advanced technologies will increase forecasting accuracy as well as reliability. As the rapid development of IoT technology, more and more industries will be equipped with sensors and monitors. The emergence of modern manufacturing changes the appearances of factories. IoT system helps managers to monitor and control the production process by collecting, tracking and transferring data. Data is powerful. Managers also can do business analysis based on marketing data. Information such as customer buying preference and market demanding could be collected and used for production estimation. Trend analysis based on current growth assumption could be used in manufacturing. The analysis strongly helps the cycle time reduction of manufacturing process and energy consumption. In this case, modern technology increases production efficiency as well as economic efficiency. =Technology forecasting with technology radar= Companies often use technology forecasting to prioritize R&D; activities, plan new product development and make strategic decisions on technology licensing, and formation of joint ventures. One of the instruments enabling technology forecasting in a company is a technology radar. Technology radar serves to identify technologies, trends and shocks early on and to raise attention to the threats and opportunities of technological development as well as to stimulate innovation. Technology radars have successfully been implemented for the purpose of identifying, selecting, assessing and disseminating a company-wide technology intelligence. These Technology Radars follow a certain radar process which itself brings significant value for a company: * Identification: employees acting as technology scouts from all over the world submit novel technologies to the platform. * Selection: based on the technology, its potential impact and novelty, a radar team revises submitted technologies and selects the most valid ones. * Assessment: selected technologies are then assessed on the basis of market opportunity and implementation risk. * Dissemination: radar displays assessed technologies according to maturity, position in the value chain, and relevance.

Background Commission members and staff traveled to the American South, where they interviewed former slaves and Union field commanders to get a better grasp of the situation and of the \\"condition and capacity\\" of freed slaves. Howe and his secretary also traveled to Canada West, where thousands of former slaves had settled after gaining freedom in Canada. He visited their communities, interviewed freedmen and government officials, and noted their progress in a free country where they were enfranchised and their rights protected by the government.Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe, Refugees from Slavery in Canada West: Report to the Freedmen's Inquiry Commission, (Boston: Wright and Potter, Printers, 1864/reprint Arno Press, 1969), available as e-text online, accessed 4 March 2014 Through its report, the Commission recommended that the government help support freedmen through their transition to a free life. Their report was submitted to Congress and its findings debated. Its recommendations contributed to the passage by Congress of a bill authorizing formation of the Freedmen's Bureau, to help manage the transition of freedmen to freedom. The Commission used Federal money to establish schools and churches in the South in an attempt to employ and educate former slaves. The commission's mission was successful, and the bill's life was extended in Congress in January 1866. Included in its reporting of the dire conditions faced by many freedmen in the South, the Commission reported that there had been instances of Union Army soldiers stealing from already poverty stricken African-American \\"contrabands\\" in Virginia.

Air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment capacity in the U.S. is often specified in \\"tons\\" (of refrigeration). Many manufacturers also specify capacity in BTU/h, especially when specifying the performance of smaller equipment. History The ton of refrigeration is equivalent to the consumption of one ton of ice per day and originated during the transition from stored natural ice to mechanical refrigeration. Just as horsepower and candlepower were intuitive units of measure for people living through the transition from horse to motorized transport and from flame-based to electric lighting, so was the ton of refrigeration an intuitive unit of measure during a technological change, as the ice trade gradually adopted over more artificial ice (ice from ice-making plant) in addition to its natural ice supplies. The TR unit was developed during the 1880s. Its definition was set at the level of an industry standard in 1903, when Thomas Shipley of the York Manufacturing Company led the formation of an industry association (the Ice Machine Builders Association of the United States) along with standardization of several equipment specifications. In 1904 these efforts led to the founding of the American Society of Refrigerating Engineers (ASRE), which was one of the predecessors of ASHRAE.

The forest is located near Carrabelle off US 98 along the Gulf coast and on St. James Island. At one time, Tate's Hell supported at least 12 major habitats including: wet flatwoods, wet prairie, seepage slope, baygall, floodplain forest, floodplain swamp, basin swamp, upland hardwood forest, sandhill, pine ridges, dense titi swamp thickets and scrub. Tate's Hell State Forest is an important hydrologic area and includes a section of the New River (Florida Panhandle). The park's watershed provides fresh water into the Apalachicola Bay, the Carrabelle River and the Ochlockonee River. Carrabelle, Florida During a 40-year period of private ownership prior to the state's acquisition in 1994, over of forest roads and ditches were constructed on the property to accommodate intensive commercial forest management operations. Most of the area was planted with pine monoculture and the drainage canals dried what had been previously wetlands. There was extensive loss of habitat and wildlife. Apalachicola Bay suffered from the loss of the previously continuous fresh water flow into the bay provided by the wetlands, adding to the effect of loss of water flow into the bay from the Apalachicola River. Causes include surface water use upstream of the Apalachicola River basin, such as supplying drinking water to the city of Atlanta, and agriculture use in Georgia. Debate over the use of water in this basin is the subject of a long-standing feud among the three southern states over which use or which user takes precedence over the others. A recent court rulingCouncilforqualitygrowth.org sets forth the history of water use in the upper reaches of the basin. Name Local legend attributes the forest's unusual name to Cebe Tate, a local homesteader who became lost in the woods in the mid 1870s. He had ventured into the woods with his hunting dog in order to shoot a panther that had attacked his livestock. The legend is often recounted with Tate becoming separated from his dogs and lost for seven days and seven nights before coming to a clearing near Carrabelle, where he lived only long enough to say to a passerby \\"My name is Cebe Tate, and I just came from Hell\\" before collapsing.  Restoration Since its acquisition by the State of Florida Department of Forestry in 1994, 12 restoration projects have been undertaken to restore some of the natural drainage and natural communities. These projects include removal or planting of some road beds, restoring natural water flow, and alteration of planted species. As of 2007, eight of the 12 projects had been completed at a cost of $1.446 million and affecting of the State Forest. It will however, take a much longer time for the forest to return to a more natural state. The Florida Department of Forestry and North West Florida Water Management District continue to study and plan for future restoration of the Forest.  Animals and plant life  White Birds-in- a-nest (Macbridea alba) Many endangered or threatened animals live in Tate's Hell State Forest, including the gopher tortoise and red-cockaded woodpecker. Some rare plant species living in the forest include thick-leaved water-willow (Justicia crassifolia), white birds-in-a-nest (Macbridea alba), Florida bear grass (Nolina atopocarpa), Chapman's butterwort (Pinguicula planifolia), and small-flowered meadow beauty (Rhexia parviflora).

Her remains were found three years later in neighboring Hampden County after what became the largest search in the state's history. Disappearance In the summer of 2000, 16-year-old Molly Bish began working as a lifeguard at Comins Pond in Warren, Massachusetts. On June 26, the day before Molly's disappearance, her mother, Magi, saw a mustached man in a white car parked in the lot of the beach where Molly's lifeguard post was located. Although he seemed suspicious at the time, she thought no further about him until after Molly's disappearance. On June 27, Magi drove Molly to Comins Pond and dropped her off near the lifeguard station. Magi reportedly saw no sign of the stranger from the previous day or his white sedan. However, another witness reported that he saw a man matching the stranger's description in the pond's parking lot just minutes before Molly arrived. A local worker also reported that he saw a similar car parked at a cemetery connected to the pond by a path. Magi Bish was the last known person to see Molly before her disappearance. Several hours later, police contacted Molly's parents, informing them that no lifeguard had been on duty all day and that Molly's belongings had been left unattended at her station. Body discovery An extensive search was immediately launched. It was to become the largest and most expensive search for a missing person ever undertaken in Massachusetts. Her case was profiled on the numerous American television shows Disappeared, America's Most Wanted, Unsolved Mysteries, and 48 Hours. A hunter had seen a blue bathing suit in the woods on Whiskey Hill in Palmer, in late fall 2002. In May 2003, he mentioned this to Tim McGuigan, who contacted police. An intense search of the area soon located Molly's body. On June 9, 2003, Molly's body was found five miles from her family home. Further developments In 2004 Magi and John Bish founded The Molly Bish Center and Foundation in collaboration with Anna Maria College. In 2005, a Connecticut resident charged with attempted kidnapping in Connecticut was briefly under investigation in connection with the case. In 2009, a new suspect was investigated. Rodney Stanger, a Florida resident convicted of murdering his girlfriend, had lived in Southbridge, Massachusetts ‚Äì a few miles from the town of Warren ‚Äì for more than 20 years. Rodney moved to Florida a year after the Bish murder. Following the murder of Crystal Morrison, Stanger's girlfriend of 20 years, Crystal's sister alerted the Massachusetts authorities. Stanger was known to have access to a white car similar to the one seen the day before Bish's disappearance. He was also known to fish in Comins Pond and hunt in the woods where Bish's body was found. In addition, Stanger closely matched the description provided by Magi Bish of the man seen in the white sedan the day before Molly's disappearance. Stanger has not been charged in her case. In 2009, when Stanger was being investigated for the Bish murder, police also questioned him in connection with the 1993 murder of Holly Piirainen who went missing in Sturbridge. Bish and Piirainen were the same age in 1993, and Bish had written a letter of hope to Piirainen's parents in 1993. Stanger was not charged in this case. In 2012, forensic evidence led authorities to name David Pouliot ‚Äî who died in 2003 ‚Äî as a person of interest in the Piirainen case. In November 2011, Gerald Battistoni, a.k.a. Confidential Informant #62 for the Eastern Hampden County Narcotic Task Force, was named as a suspect in Bish's death by private detective Dan Malley of Massachusetts. Battistoni served time in prison for repeatedly raping a teenage girl in the early 1990s. He attempted suicide in prison after newspaper articles identified him as a potential suspect in Bish and Piirainen's deaths. Battistoni, who had a criminal record dating back to 1980, had been in the area where Molly's body was found and resembles a composite sketch of the man Magi saw in the parking lot on the day before Molly disappeared. After Gerald Battistoni was named as a suspect, Private Detective Dan Malley and the Bish family asked for DNA testing to be done. Massachusetts state police sent the DNA evidence to Texas. Gerald Battistoni died at Lemuel Shattuck Hospital in Jamaica Plain in November 2014. There have been no arrests in the case .  Connection to Holly Piirainen case  Fellow Massachusetts resident Holly Piirainen was murdered seven years earlier. Her body was also found in a wooded area in Hampden County. Police considered the possibility that the two cases could be related. Pouliot is considered a person of interest in both cases. It was discovered that Molly Bish had written a letter to Holly Piirainen's family following Holly's disappearance.

Trayvon Martin remarks and ethics investigation  On the March 31, 2012 edition of Richard Land Live!, Land accused the Obama administration and civil rights leaders of using the Trayvon Martin case to deliberately stir up racial tension and \\"gin up the black vote\\" for Obama in the 2012 presidential election. His comments were criticized by several black Southern Baptist pastors, who felt they reversed a long effort by the SBC to distance itself from a past history of racism. One of those pastors, Dwight McKissic, even announced he would introduce a resolution repudiating Land's remarks.Loller, Travis. Southern Baptist Convention's leader criticizes Trayvon Martin support. Associated Press, 2012-04-14. Land refused to back down, saying that he would not \\"bow to the false god of political correctness\\".Roach, Erin; Chandler, Dana. \\"Land expresses concern about political element in Martin case\\", Baptist Press, 2012-04-10. Soon thereafter he wrote an open letter of apology for \\"any hurt or misunderstanding\\" that his words might have caused.Toalston, Art, \\"Richard Land issues open letter of apology for controversial Trayvon Martin comments\\", Baptist Press, 2012-04-16. On April 14, 2012, Baptist blogger Aaron Weaver discovered that Land's commentary on the Martin case had been lifted almost verbatim and without attribution from a column by Jeffrey Kuhner of The Washington Times. According to Weaver, while Land included a link to the article in show notes that were posted online, he did not disclose that his commentary was based almost entirely on that column.Weaver, Aaron, \\"Richard Land The Plagiarist: Top SBC Ethicist Stirs Up Controversy With Someone Else‚Äôs Rant\\", The Big Daddy Weave, 14 April 2012. Weaver also discovered that Land had also lifted material in previous broadcasts from other sources as well and passed them off as his own words.Smetana, Bob, \\"Religious leader accused of plagiarizing Trayvon comments\\", The Tennessean, 17 April 2012. In response, the ERLC's executive committee removed the entire archive of past broadcasts of Richard Land Live! and launched an internal investigation. It also expressed concern that Land's comments about the Martin shooting \\"opened wounds from the past\\".Toalston, Art, \\"Land's comments on Trayvon Martin shooting meet with commission's regret, investigation\\", Baptist Press, 19 April 2012 The committee released the findings of its investigation on June 1. It reprimanded Land for using \\"hurtful, irresponsible, insensitive, and racially charged words\\" about the Martin case, and apologized to Martin's family. It also found that Land had used \\"carelessness and poor judgment\\" in lifting material from other sources without attribution, calling it a case of clear plagiarism. It found no evidence that Land had plagiarized any of his written work. The committee also announced that Richard Land Live! would be canceled as soon as its contract with distributor Salem Radio Network allowed it to do so, saying that the show was \\"not congruent with the mission of the ERLC\\".Toalston, Art. \\"Trustees reprimand Land, halt radio program over comments\\", Baptist Press, 2012-06-01.

The population as of 2011 was estimated to be about 10,000, making the community one of the largest in the Cambodian diaspora.Cambodge , Chambre de Commerce Franco-Cambogiene (in French) The Cambodian population in France is the most established outside Southeast Asia, with a presence dating to well before the Vietnam War and subsequent Indochina refugee crisis. History Cambodian immigration to France began in the latter half of the 19th century, when Cambodia became a French protectorate. The first wave of migrants largely consisted of students and workers belonging to the country's elite class, including members of the royal family.Pierre Montagnon, La France coloniale, tome 1, Pygmalion-G√©rard Watelet, 1988 During World War I, soldiers and civilians in the French colonial empire were recruited to help with the war effort in Metropolitan France. About 2,000 Cambodians arrived in France during the conflict period.La Diaspora Vietnamienne en France un cas particulier (in French) However, most Cambodians arrived in France as refugees as a result of their country's heavy turmoil during the latter half of the 20th century. Following the Khmer Rouge takeover in 1976, a small number of Cambodians were able to flee their country and arrive in France with the French government's assistance. A much larger influx of refugees arrived in France during the Cambodian‚ÄìVietnamese War that resulted in the collapse of the Khmer Rouge and end of the Cambodian genocide in the 1980s. Roughly 50,000 Cambodian refugees arrived in France by 1989. France was an ideal destination for Cambodians who were educated or already had family present in the country, while poorer and uneducated refugees tended to immigrate to the United States and Australia. The final wave of refugees arrived in the late 1990s, when the last refugee camps closed.Le r√¥le de la diaspora dans la justice transitionnelle : L'exemple du Cambodge Mey, Elyda, International Center for Transparent Justice, July 2007 (in French) In contrast to the Vietnamese, Laotian and ethnic Chinese populations in France, Cambodian refugees from conflicts in Indochina arrived relatively later compared to their peers, and had a harder time finding government assistance. Culture and demographics The Cambodian French population is concentrated in Paris and the surrounding √éle-de-France region, as well as in Lyon and the Rh√¥ne-Alpes region. In contrast to Cambodian communities in the United States, Canada and Australia, the Cambodian population in France is on average, more educated, older and has a much higher average income. While the community is still attached to its country of origin in some cultural spheres, Cambodians in France have largely integrated into French society. Although Cambodia lost over 3.8 million educated citizens in its civil war, the remaining Cambodians managed to achieve a model minority image; and despite having income and education levels higher than other Cambodian diaspora communities, the average for the community is lower than the national average.Quand les Khmers de France ne font plus r√™ver le Cambodge (in French) Buddhism plays an important role in the community and is seen as a marker of ethnic identity; in contrast, the ability to speak the Khmer language is less emphasized. Though immigrant parents set up language schools for their children soon after migration, many children discontinued their language studies due to the difficulty of learning Khmer grammar and the Sanskrit-based Khmer alphabet. Numerically, the Khmer are the dominant group among Cambodians in France, but Cambodians of Chinese descent can also be found among the population; though interethnic marriages between Chinese and Khmers were common in Cambodia and remain so in France, the Chinese they have tended to organise themselves around the varieties they speak and remain somewhat separate from other Cambodians in France. A small number of Cambodians in France consist of the wives and mixed-race children of French colonisers who repatriated to France between 1955 and 1965; regardless of their ethnicity, many of those used Khmer rather than French as their home language.

Both commissioned in 1928, they were the largest ferries on Sydney Harbour until the 1938 introduction of the South Steyne. Curl Curl was the fastest ferry on the harbour, able to do the Manly run in 22 minutes. Dee Why was only marginally slower. The two ferries were built in Scotland and steamed to Sydney under their own power. The cost to build them in Australia was too high, so the company looked to Scotland for their new ships. Curl Curl served until 1960 while Dee Why was in service until 1968. The ferries were named after the Sydney suburbs of Dee Why and Curl Curl that lie north of Manly. Background In the 1920s, the Port Jackson & Manly Steamship Company ran a seven-ship fleet comprising the Kuring-gai and six similar Sydney-built double-ended screw steamers: Binngarra (1905), Burra Bra (1908), Bellubera (1910), Balgowlah (1912), Barrenjoey (1913) and Baragoola (1922). Patronage was growing on the Manly service with fifty million passengers carried to and from Manly in the decade prior. By 1925, both Kuring-gai and Binngarra were aging and not meeting requirements of the service. With construction commenced on a Sydney Harbour bridge crossing, and expectations that a rail link to Manly would be built in 10 years (but never eventuated), the company was seeking faster and larger vessels to compete. Quotations from Australian builders were considered too high, and proposals were sought from Britain for the design and construction of the vessels. The company considered diesel propulsion; however, marine diesel technology was still in a relative infancy. The contract for the vessels was awarded to Napier and Miller at Old Kilpatrick, Glasgow, Scotland. They would be the first Manly ferries since the 1883 paddlewheeler PS Brighton to be built in Britain rather than Australia. They were designed by naval architect E.H. Mitchell to a basic specification by W.L. Dendy, then the general manager of the PJ & MS Co.SS Dee Why Ferries of SydneySS Curl Curl Ferries of Sydney They were designed to provide a 17-knot service to compete with a proposed Manly and district train line that never eventuated. Design and construction =Hulls and superstructure= Dee Why and Curl Curl had double-ended steel hulls with a bar keel, 6 watertight bulkheads and timber decks. Their superstructures were steel up to promenade deck level and timber above this level. Each ferry displaced 799.5 tons of water, were 220 feet long, 35 feet 11 inches broad, and drawing 12 feet six inches of water when fully laden, considerably larger than their Bingarra-class predecessors (Barrenjoey, for example, was 500 tons). As built, the built up sections of the bow were not extended far back and did not keep the boats dry. Initially, canvas dodgers were lashed behind the promenade deck railing. Circa 1930, the bulwarks were lengthened by extending the bow plating further back. They were extended again circa 1935 by replacing the promenade deck guardrails with further bulwark plating. Visually, this resolved the rather stumpy looking bows by extending the bow line. The bow modifications also provided an opportunity to visually distinguish the two identical vessels. The canvas dodgers lashed behind the promenade deck railings were cut differently for each vessel. When the bulwarks were fully extended, Dee Why were finished with a white stripe which came to a point at each end, while on Curl Curl the point went the other way to form a 'swallow tail'. This painted distinction was removed in 1958 when both vessels were painted identically. The two ferries introduced a new Bristol Green colour scheme to the Manly ferry service. The colour scheme replaced the old black, white-striped hull which the Manly fleet had carried since Phantom. The new scheme lasted until the sale of the service to the NSW Government in 1974 (after both Curl Curl and Dee Why were scuttled). =Accommodation= The vessels had three decks and a cabin flat. Navigation bridges and wheelhouses were located at the fore and aft ends of the sun deck. Originally there was one cabin attached to each wheelhouse on the sun deck, and later two. Three lifeboats on sun deck (later supplemented by one workboat). Crew's cabin was on forward cabin deck. Other equipment included a wireless (provided 1928) and radio-telephone (provided in 1955). In 1947, two additional cabins were provided on the sun deck attached to wheelhouses. The same year, Brown Bros. electro-hydraulic steering controlled by telemotor was added. Passenger accommodation included a Ladies' Saloon with padded benches and the promenade deck house with reversible padded benches. Passenger housing was also on the main, promenade and cabin decks. Outside seating on the main deck and lower cabins was wood benches. Both ferries were the first in the Manly fleet to be built with enclosed upper decks, a marked improvement for passengers on all preceding ferries' windswept open decks. Four of the six existing Binngarra-class vessels had their open upper decks glazed-in during the 1930s. Padded reversible seats were also introduced in contrast to the older ferries' fixed wooden benches. A smoking saloon was provided on the lower deck and cafeteria was originally provided on both vessels. Passengers could order breakfast, lunch, dinner or supper which was served with silver cutlery embossed with the company's insignia. There were eight gangway exits on each on the promenade and main decks. Three double stairways (fore, aft and amidships) connected the main and promenade decks, and two single stairways to the fore and aft cabins. Each ship required thirteen crew and could carry up to 1,587 passengers, a capacity that was reduced to 1,199 in rough weather. =Machinery= They were the second-last steam powered ferries built for the PJ & MS Co, possessing inverted direct- acting four-cylinder triple-expansion fully reversible steam engines manufactured by David and William Henderson and Co, of Glasgow, producing 3,200 horsepower. The cylinders were 24\\", 37\\", 46\\", 46\\" √ó 33\\". They drove a single screw at each end through a \\"push-pull\\" principle. The propellers were of solid bronze with four blades, being nine feet three inches in diameter. Steam for the engines was provided by four single-ended cylindrical Scotch boilers, placed in pairs back to back in two stokeholds, and fitted for burning either oil or coal. This arrangement necessitated the use of two funnels, which, because of the arrangement of the boilers, had to be placed slightly forward of amidships, resulting in a strangely asymmetrical appearance. Each boiler was 11 feet six inches long and 12 feet wide. Four boilers, uneconomically, required two stokers, although only two boilers and one stoker were needed for normal service speed. The boilers were heated with two \\"Deighton\\" 3' 8\\" internal diameter furnaces per boiler with forced draught burning. The vessels had steam assisted steering, electric lighting, chemical fire extinguishing and Mechams engine room telegraphs. The Dee Why was launched by Mrs J L Goodwin on 28 December 1927 and her fitting out was completed in March 1928. Curl Curl was launched on 27 February 1928 by Mrs H.A.M. Napier. Curl Curl undertook trials on the Firth of Clyde on 24 May 1928.

Dee Why left Glasgow on 25 May 1928 under the command of Captain G Brown and Curl Curl left on 1‚Äì2 June 1928 under Captain Abrahm and a crew of eighteen. To save costs, each vessel used only one of four available boilers. A storm in the Bay of Biscay ripped off part of Dee Why sponson and water was taken with pumps blocked from builder's debris. At one point, Dee Why broke a main steampipe and she drifted for 10 hours until taken under tow by a tramp steamer. She was laid up in Algiers for eight days for repairs. The crew become apprehensive about continuing, and the Captain lost the support of some of the officers. After travelling through the Suez Canal, Curl Curl was held up by the Aden harbour master to see out the tropical monsoon but Dee Why was told to proceed. Ultimately, both boats stayed in Aden for two months during which time most of the crew had to be forced on board. A stowaway on Dee Why was contracted in place of a fireman who refused to work. Rough weather was experience between Aden and Colombo and the ships continued past Java stopping at Surabaya on its north-east coast. Once in Australian waters, Dee Why anchored each night inside the Great Barrier Reef and without a steam winch, her anchor was handled manually with the assistance of a hand winch. Seventy miles from Sydney, Dee Why ran into a southerly gale and sheltered for 37 hours at Cape Hawke. Curl Curl, with a crew of eighteen under the command of Captain Abrahams, arrived in Sydney 8:15 a.m. on 1 October 1928. Dee Why arrived in Sydney at 2:00 a.m. on 1 November 1928, a journey time of 5 months and 10 days. Service history Curl Curl on Sydney Harbour in 1930 Curl Curl was registered in Sydney on 26 October 1928 and Dee Why on 2 November 1928. Curl Curl was fitted with a bow propellor and rudder for her double-ended service configuration, and her official trials were on 30 November 1928 and Dee Why on 24 December 1928. Both ships exceeded 17.5 knots on their trials. Curl Curl is thought to have been the fastest conventional single displacement hulled ferry on Sydney Harbour, with the current Freshwater-class ferries considerably slower. Only the later hydrofoils (introduced 1960s) and catamarans (introduced 1990s) have been faster. Dee Why was marginally slower. Soon after her arrival in Sydney, Curl Curl ran a trial trip to Manly in twenty-five minutes with three knots to spare. The next day, with officials on board, Bellubera was given a 12-minute head start from Circular Quay, and was passed by Curl Curl at Middle Head, equivalent to three quarters of the distance to Manly. Returning to Circular Quay, she reached 17.75 knots. When the two sisters were run free (ie, continuously and not to a time-table) to move Anniversary Day crowds in 1936, they completed trips in 22 minutes, which required an average 18 knots (the vessels' theoretical maximum). The South Steyne of 1938, could only manage a 23-minute trip. Curl Curl steaming across the Sydney Heads Curl Curl and Dee Why entered service on 6 December 1928 and 25 December 1928, respectively. They proved most popular with the traveling public and attracted significant extra patronage for the company. They were not only bigger and faster than preceding ferries including‚ÄîBinngarra, Burra Bra, Baragoola and Barrenjoey‚Äîbut also better sea boats and better appointed. They were the first Manly ferries with glassed in upper decks and had reversible upholstered seating replacing the hard wooden benches of the older Manly ferries. Company chairman, Hunter McPherson, described them as \\"splendid carriers, fast, excellent sea boats, economical to run, wonderfully easy to handle under conditions\\". The company enjoyed a patronage boom in the 1930s, aided by the two new vessels, the early-1930s upgrade and upper deck enclosure of the four newer Bingarra-class vessels, and opening of Manly pool. Once Dee Why and Curl Curl were introduced, the company's older two vessels, the Kuringai (1901) and Binngarra (1905) were sold and Burra Bra (1908) was used as a reserve boat. The vessels' cafeterias were closed by the mid-1930s. Curl Curl and Dee Why spent 20 years carrying massive crowds, particularly during the war when all passenger records were broken. In 1951, Curl Curl and Dee Why made 13,468 trips compared to 14,907 by the other four ships in service. By the mid-1950s, however, patronage fell impacting the company's fortunes and the two ships were beginning to age. Both vessels were mortgaged to the Commercial Bank, Sydney from 4 August 1950 with the mortgages being discharged on each of the vessels sales. The two steamers were faster than their running mates, but they were costly to run. After Balgowlah was withdawn from service and Barrenjoey (as North Head), Baragoola & Bellubera had been converted to diesel, the twins were shown to be very expensive to run with their bunker oil costing far more than diesel.

Tugs St Aristel and Lindfield pulled her off. The two ferries lead largely safe and quiet careers on the harbour; however, they had their fair share of incidents: =Dee Why= * On 25 November 1931, had her first accident when she rammed the wooden Sydney Ferries Limited ferry, Kirrule. The Dee Why captain was found to be at fault and his certificate was suspended. * 1 October 1943, collided with a liberty ship. * On Christmas Day night, 1946, ran aground in fog at Obelisk Bay, and remained stuck for several hours while the wharfingers at Manly were wondering where she had got to‚Äîin those days there was no radio on board‚Äîand was nearly eight hours late when she was towed off by three tugs after the fog had lifted and people realised what happened. She had lost her rudder, damaged her propeller, and bent hull frames. Repairs to the ferry cost ¬£6,500, and most of the travellers had to wait through the small hours of the morning before being lifted off. * 29 March 1957, collided with tug Himma, and ran aground at Kirribilli. =Curl Curl= * On 29 April 1929, Curl Curl, ran down a passenger launch named Nimrod which heeled over throwing a number of her passengers into the water. No-one was seriously injured and the boats were not significantly damaged. Chronicle (Adelaide, SA : 1895 - 1954) * On 30 April 1930, Curl Curl collided with Sydney Ferries Limited ferry, Kiandra. The Curl Curl, being constructed of steel, caused serious damage to the wooden Kiandra, and it was only by prompt action by emergency crews that she avoided sinking. Several people were injured. * In February 1932, Curl Curl failed to stop at Manly wharf and rammed the footpath and Manly pool. Divers were needed to clear a rope that had wrapped round the propeller. * 31 March 1936, on a 7:10 am service from Circular Quay, Curl Curl ran aground at Bradleys Head in fog with 50 people aboard. All passengers were safely transferred to launch Nevade. Tugs St Aristel and Lindfield pulled her off later that afternoon. After damage to her rudder and propeller blades was repaired, she was returned to service on 9 April 1936. * On 16 November 1936, suffered blistered paint but avoided major damage when she was towed away by police launch from the burning Bellubera at the company's Kurraba Point depot. The fire destroyed Bellubera superstructure, killed two crew members and injured two others, one critically. Bellubera hull and engine survived and she was later rebuilt. * 10 November 1938, collided with Manly Wharf * 23 September 1943, collided with launch * 12 February 1953, collision with Manly Wharf causing significant damage to herself, to the wharf and destroying the local tourism offices. * 9 February 1954, collided with Lady Scott Demise In 1960, PJ & MS Co financial circumstances had declined, and the Curl Curl was decommissioned on 25 October 1960 following Baragoola recommissioning after being converted to diesel. Curl Curl was laid up at the Balmain depot where in 1962 she began popping rivets and leaking. She was sold in 1963 to Strides & Co shipbreakers. The stripped hulk was towed out of the harbour where she was scuttled on 12 August 1969. The Dee Why continued alone and her last three years were as a relief vessel. Her final run was on 7 July 1968 under Captain K Ross. She too was decommissioned and sold to Strides where she was laid up next to the hulk of Curl Curl. One of her wheelhouses was taken to Warringah Mall and used as a children's playhouse for a few years. Dee Why was towed out of the harbour on 25 August 1976, by the tugs Rozelle and Fern Bay, to a point two-and-a-half nautical miles offshore and scuttled off Long Reef. Her remains lie in water 51 metres deep at , and forming an artificial fishing reef. Divers regularly dive the wreck.

The series was written by Kevin Smith, creator of View Askew Productions. It was originally published by Oni Press in four issues as Jay & Silent Bob in 1998 and 1999, and later collected in a trade paperback by Image Comics. Plot Jay and Silent Bob get the idea that if they go to the town of Shermer, Illinois, where most of John Hughes' movies take place, they could get chicks and be the \\"blunt connection\\". Along the way they encounter Holden McNeil, wildlife marshals, and monkeys. =Issue one= In the first issue, Jay and Silent Bob have been evicted from Tricia Jones's (\\"Trish the Dish,\\" as seen in Mallrats) apartment, where they had lived for the previous six months. Jay causes this to happen after he tries to join Tricia in the shower. Unfortunately, this is all seen by a USA Today reporter, hoping to talk to her about her book, Boregasm. After getting ejected, Jay and Bob go to and are soon told to leave the Eden Prairie Mall (also from Mallrats), Quick Stop/RST Video (from Clerks), and Comic Toast (as seen in Mallrats and a cut scene from Chasing Amy). The two, remembering various John Hughes movies, decide to go to Shermer, Illinois, where many of Hughes' movies are set. They get tickets, meet with Holden McNeil (an interaction depicted in the diner scene from Chasing Amy), and travel to Chicago via bus. The issue also features various references to the View Askew films: *It is revealed that Willam Black (depicted in the form of Ethan Suplee from Mallrats) has yet to see the sailboat in the Magic Eye painting at the Eden Prairie Mall. *Roddy (Svenning's assistant from Mallrats) seems to be working for Channel Surfers at the Eden Prairie Mall. *While on the bus after they meet with Holden McNeil, Silent Bob is seen reading an issue of Bluntman and Chronic, suggesting he enjoys the comic unlike Jay. =Issue two= The pair are forced to flee the bus to Chicago after smoking a bowl in its bathroom. Having gotten off in Pittsburgh, the two decide to get a ride to a nearby town. After a near-fatal encounter with Mr. Rogers, Bob decides to get a new hat at a Mooby store. While Jay is waiting, he meets a pornographic actress. He convinces her that Jay and Bob should be in her current project, Doogie Nights. The two arrive at the set, a local hospital, to find that the director is former Doogie Howser television star Neil Patrick Harris. Wishing to make a \\"quasi- indie film\\", Neil gives Jay the job of fluffer. Jay, being too good at his job, leaves the actor unable to do a scene. Jay and Bob then leave the hospital, unhappy with the gift the porn star gave to him. Meanwhile, wildlife marshal Sam \\"Big Dog\\" Gavert starts a full search for the escaped zoo monkey Suzanne (shown in the closing shot of Mallrats). The monkey actually belongs to Provasic Pharmaceuticals, who are hoping to get their test subject back. *While waiting for Bob to get a new hat, Jay reads Bluntman and Chronic #2. =Issue three= Because a slightly modified adaptation of this issue was written into the movie Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back this issue should be considered apocryphal. Chasing Dogma remains in canon, minus Issue 3. The two wake up in Indiana to find Suzanne cupping Jay's penis. While Jay rants about how monkeys may eventually destroy humanity and rule the world, Bob ends up bonding with Suzanne. The three of them become hungry, and Jay decides to grab something to eat. Meanwhile, Big Dog and his team of wildlife marshals get a tip that the monkey is at an Indiana diner. At said diner, Jay, Bob, and Suzanne eat some grub. The wildlife marshals surround the diner and demand the release of Suzanne. Jay, Bob, and Suzanne (disguised as a kid) decide to come out. Big Dog falls for their disguise, until he smells bananas. Jay and Bob escape with Suzanne into the sewer, where they are followed by Big Dog. The four end up at a huge dam pipe, where Suzanne tricks Big Dog into jumping over into the water. Hearing of Big Dog's fate, the team of marshals leave the trio alone when they emerge from the pipe. Jay and Bob hear that a Dr. Ogee at Provasic is offering a reward for Suzanne's capture. The two turn Suzanne in, get two bus tickets to Chicago as compensation and are on the road once again. =Issue four= The duo finally arrive in Chicago and enlist a cab to drive them to Shermer, Illinois. They end up at McHenry High School, where the two crash the Home Economics classroom and sell some weed to the students. At the school, Jay meets a lesbian student named Crystal, who sews Jay's catchphrase \\"Snoogans\\" onto his hat and explains the fictional status of Shermer. The two rival with the school dealers and end up in a sticky situation. After getting some new clothes, the two talk about going back to Tricia's place, but are distracted by the sounds of the local rock band, Fork'd Tongue. The two praise their playing and Jay buys a shirt from them. After hanging out with the band all night, Jay and Bob eat breakfast at a Mooby's restaurant and decide to stay in Chicago and get laid. They stop by the Planned Parenthood clinic to \\"meet loose women.\\" After waiting all night, Bob hears something near the parking lot. The two investigate the problem, thus leading into Dogma.

History 1CCS was formed on 20 September 1965 as the Air Transportable Telecommunications Unit (ATTU). ATTU's role was to provide simple Communication Centres (COMCENs) in the field in support of air operations. Over the years, the role has evolved to also include Air Traffic Control systems and navigational aids and CIS required to establish a fully functioning military air base. On 1 July 1999, after providing communications support for 34 years, ATTU was retitled No 1 Combat Communications Squadron, however the role of the squadron remained the same. 1CCS has a long and distinguished record of providing tactical Communications and Information Systems in support of Australian Defence Force operations and exercises. 1CCS has grown significantly over the years, from humble beginnings with 12 people in 1965 to the present day where some 380 men and women provide tactical and temporary CIS support to operations, exercises and other activities in support of Air Force, the Australian Defence Force and the community. Capabilities that 1CCS can provide are many and varied. These include the deployable provision of radio systems, ICT systems and air traffic control support systems. This can be provided from established Air Force bases, remote locations or anywhere in the world. 1CCS is often required to provide tactical and temporary communications during disaster relief operations local to Australia or overseas. 1CCS‚Äôs personnel are primarily compromised of Electrical Engineers (ELECTR), Communications Electronic Technicians (CETECH) and Network Technicians (NETECH). The Squadron also has a cadre of administration, logistics and ground support personnel. The Squadron Headquarters and the Amberley Flight are located at RAAF Base Amberley on the outskirts of Brisbane in Queensland. Flights of personnel and equipment are also located at RAAF Base Williamtown in New South Wales and RAAF Base Edinburgh in South Australia. On 20 September 2015, 1CCS celebrated its 50th anniversary.  Active service  Personnel and equipment from 1CCS and ATTU have deployed on nearly every major operation, humanitarian assistance mission and exercise that the Air Force has been involved in since 1965. Major operational deployments include: * Afghanistan (Warlike) * Timor Leste 2006 (Non-Warlike) * Solomon Islands 2003 (Non-Warlike) * Iraq 2003 (Warlike) * Kyrgyzstan 2002 (Warlike) * East Timor 1999‚Äì2000 (Warlike) * Cambodia 1991 (Warlike) * Sumatra Assist 2004-2005 (Humanitarian) * Pakistan Assist II (Humanitarian) Honours and awards * 2019 Markowski Cup * 2009 Markowski Cup * 2003 Meritorious Unit Citation * 1995 Duke of Gloucester Cup (ATTU)  Meritorious Unit Citation  For sustained outstanding service in warlike operations in providing expeditionary communication and information systems support during Operations BASTILLE and FALCONER. Number 1 Combat Communications Squadron is based at Royal Australian Air Force Base Richmond, and was given the mission of providing communications and information systems support to deployed elements of the Royal Australian Air Force, on deployment on combat operations in the Middle East Area of Operations. During Operations BASTILLE and FALCONER, the Squadron provided meritorious service to the Royal Australian Air Force mission through the provision of expeditionary combat communications to elements which were deployed to four separate locations in the Middle East Area of Operations. The successful provision of this vital communications support was only achieved after the Squadron completed detailed tactical planning and identified and completed some extensive modifications to existing and new communications equipment in a very short timeframe to meet the planned mission. The requirement for the communications packages and personnel to be able to integrate with the Coalition Theatre communications plan meant the Squadron was required to mobilise all of its Australian-based communications assets and trained personnel. In addition, the Squadron had to undertake specialised force and battle preparation activities of personnel and equipment. Under considerable time pressure, the Squadron worked very long hours and showed outstanding ingenuity and resourcefulness to provide the right communications packages capable of supporting air combat operations. The Unit demonstrated the highest levels of professional excellence, technical expertise and dedication throughout the hectic preparation period. Once deployed to the Area of Operations, the Squadron elements provided manning and specialist expertise in the delivery of the full range of communications and data requirements for the Australian aviation elements. The Squadron successfully provided air-ground-air voice nets, satellite communications bearers, classified and restricted information systems and conduits for the delivery of joint command and control and logistics systems. The communications provided by Number 1 Combat Communications Squadron ensured that the functions of command, air combat, air transport and logistics could be carried out with speed and confidence by all levels of the Australian command team and the operational elements. In addition, that these critical communications and network links were sustained under heavy usage and in a harsh and demanding environment is a credit to the hard work, professional skills and ingenuity of the Squadron personnel. Their efforts played a major part in the success of the Australian contribution to the Coalition to disarm Iraq. Through the combined efforts of the Squadron's command, planning, maintenance, logistics and technical sections, Number 1 Combat Communications Squadron provided meritorious service to the Royal Australian Air Force in the provision of expeditionary communications support during Operations BASTILLE and FALCONER. Members that were posted to the Squadron and deployed on Operation FALCONER in 2003 are entitled to wear the Meritorious Unit Citation Badge with Federation Star for life. Personnel who joined the Squadron after Operation FALCONER are entitled to wear the Meritorious Unit Citation Badge without Federation Star for the duration of their posting to 1CCS.  Squadron badge  Original Unit Badge: February 1973 (Air Transportable Telecommunications Unit) Background and Description: In front of a flash of lightning fessways a boomerang. Motto: Adroit (Dextrous, Skillful) Close Copy: 26 April 2000 (No 1 Combat Communications Squadron) Status: Active Unit, Richmond NSW Crown Bound by: St Edwards Monarch: Elizabeth R The Design: The flash of lightning is intended to refer to radio communications by the use of electrical energy signifying the basic function of the unit which is to provide tactical communications and navigation aids in support of air operations in forward areas. The boomerang, in flight, refers to the use of air transportation as the normal means of deployment of unit personnel and equipment to the tactical areas and, consequently the need for all unit equipment to be air transportable.  Governor-General's Banner  The Governor-General's Banner is awarded by the Governor-General, to non- operational Squadrons for 25 years service to the Royal Australian Air Force. The 1CCS Governor-General's Banner was consecrated in 2003. On the 90th anniversary of the formation of the Royal Australian Air Force, 31 March 2011, 1CCS was awarded an operational streamer to attach to the Governor-General's Banner in recognition of the Meritorious Unit Citation it was awarded in 2003 for warlike operations on Operation FALCONER.

Other renovations include a new ceiling, new lighting, and a new scoreboard. The facility currently seats 5,000 people. Autry Court is also home of the notorious Autry Army, a group of students who attend every basketball game and heckle opponents. They have recently been referred to as the \\"Blue Army of Death\\" by former University of Memphis men's head basketball coach John Calipari. The blue curtain on one side of the court is called a \\"distraction\\" by many colleges. At the end of the game, young fans are invited onto the court to shoot a free throw. If they make it, they win a basketball. On February 7, 2007, a $23 million renovation of Autry Court was announced by Rice University. The renovations are to be completed in time for the 2008-09 basketball season. In the interim, Rice played its home games at Merrell Center in Katy (5 games), Reliant Arena (8 games) and Toyota Center (1 game) in Houston.

A siren disk is used in pneumatic sirens and has holes which are variously spaced apart. When the disk is spun in front of a jet of air, the holes modulate the air-jet which produces a sound. The pitch of a siren is produced by \\"the frequency of the impulses of compressed air passing through the openings in a rotating disk.\\"(Nov 1922). \\"Siren Played by Sliding Drive Belt\\", Popular Science, Vol. 101, No. 5, p.35. ISSN 0161-7370. The pitch is therefore determined by the speed at which the disk rotates, the number of holes which air passes through, the size of the holes and their spacing apart. Typical usages of siren disks Siren disks were once used as the active element of sirens, but the majority of siren disks currently manufactured are used as instructional aids in teaching the mechanics of sound and music. For example, the Ontario Science Centre has a metal siren disk set up as an interactive teaching exhibit for children. Siren disk hole spacing =The harmonic portion of the siren disk= Most siren disks include multiple concentric circles of spaced holes, so that an air-jet can be directed at different radii to get different effects. For example, the outermost eight circles of holes include uniformly spaced holes, in which the number of holes increases along a harmonic series, so that the eight notes of a musical scale can be played by directing an air jet sequentially at each circle. =The non-harmonic portion of the siren disk= Typically there are further holes nearer the disk's centre with various non-uniform patterns, such as random spacing or arpeggios, etc. Typical numbers of holes in siren disks Unlike the hypothetical disk discussed above having just 5 concentric rings of equally space holes, a more typical disk might have 16 concentric rings instead. For the example shown below then the hole configurations need to be 8, 10, 12 and 16 then a space followed by 24, 27, 30, 32, 36, 40, 45, 48, which will give the four-note F-major arpeggio followed by the higher C-major scale: The 12 pitches of the most common kind of siren disk. The last eight circles of holes give the following temperament of a major (Ionian mode) musical scale (divide each of the above number of holes by 24): 1, 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 15/8, 2 (Ptolemy's intense diatonic scale). A similarly generated minor scale can be made by making a siren disk with the following ratios of hole numbers: 1, 9/8, 6/5, 4/3, 3/2, 8/5, 9/5, 2. (just minor scale). Typical siren disk setup The typical siren disk setup consists of a motor, pulleys, belt, and air jet. The setup at the Ontario Science Centre, for example, includes organ-style keys so that children can play music on the siren disk by pressing the keys to open and close a series of eight valves that direct the air selectively at the eight harmonic circles of uniformly spaced holes of the siren disk. Dutch inventor Dr. A. R. Naber created \\"the magic flute\\", a siren whose pitch is varied not by the number of holes in a circle on the disk, but by the speed at which the disk rotates. During operation the cord connecting the spindle and the flexible drive belt is held between the fingers and moved up and down a tapered shaft of the spindle to vary the rotation and thus pitch.

He was the third of nine children born to Cresencio and Vicenta Castillo Vel√°squez.Barger and Mendoza Reza, 1993, p. 54.Hintz, 1982, p. viii. Baldemar's father was born into a Mexican American family in Driscoll, Texas. His grandfather died when Cresencio was just 11 years old, forcing the young Cresencio to seek employment as a migrant worker. Baldemar's maternal grandparents fled to Pharr in 1910 after the Mexican Revolution, and his mother, Vicenta, was born there in 1920. His parents worked as migrant farm produce pickers in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Texas. Baldemar Vel√°squez later said that his parents instilled in him a strong work ethic and a passion for social justice linked to the Christian faith.

The family's poverty worsened one year when an employer paid his father only half the wages he was owed. In 1954, his parents settled permanently in Gilboa, Ohio, where they worked in the fields in the summer and in a cannery during the winter. Baldemar knew almost no English when he entered the first grade, and struggled academically. He was a good athlete, playing several sports, but was often ridiculed for his Mexican American heritage.Barger and Mendoza Reza, 1993, p. 54-55.

He attended Pandora-Gilboa High School, where he participated in baseball, basketball, football, and track and field, and took college preparatory courses. His high school career guidance counselor advised him to only focus on industrial arts courses, but Vel√°squez refused. A high school English teacher convinced him to go to college. He enrolled at Pan American University in Edinburg, Texas, in 1965, intending to major in engineering. Living in south Texas made him curious about his roots there, and he enrolled in a Texas history which, he said, opened his eyes to the exploitation of Mexican Americans and farmworkers. A local Roman Catholic priest assisted him in obtaining financial aid, and he transferred to Ohio Northern College (a private, United Methodist Church-affiliated school) in 1966. He transferred to Bluffton College (a private, Mennonite-affiliated school) a year later. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology in 1969. While at Bluffton College, he was mentored by Dr. Lawrence Templin, a noted pacifist who had been imprisoned for his beliefs and was now a professor of English literature. Templin had grown up in India as the son of Christian missionaries and who knew Mohandas Gandhi personally.See, generally: Templin, 1999. Templin's teachings deeply influence Vel√°squez's approach to securing social justice for farmworkers. Templin knew Bayard Rustin while in prison,D'Emilio, 2003, p. 118. and Templin encouraged him to volunteer with the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE)‚Äîa civil rights organization in which Rustin played a major role. Baldemar Vel√°squez spent several weeks in the summer of 1968 working with CORE and living with an African American family in Cleveland, Ohio.\\"Vel√°squez, Baldemar,\\" in The Mexican American Experience: An Encyclopedia, 2003, p. 412. After graduation, he spent time picking cherries in Michigan to pay off his student loans, and went to Wisconsin to meet with the founder of Obreros Unidos, Jesus Salas (also known as \\"Jesse Salas\\"). His association with Templin changed his life in another way as well: Baldemar Vel√°squez married Templin's daughter, Sara Templin, on June 11, 1969. The couple had four children together. Career with FLOC FLOC was founded in September 1967 by Baldemar Vel√°squez and his father.Vald√©s, 1991, p. 193; Rosenbaum, 1991, p. 8; Garc√≠a, C√≥rdova, and Garc√≠a, 1984, p. 46. Vel√°squez had been deeply influenced by the ideas of C√©sar Ch√°vez, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Initially, his goal was merely to organize the farmworkers so that they could cooperate with the growers to improve pay, housing, and education for the pickers. Sensing that the farmworkers would not take a 20-year-old student seriously, Vel√°squez relied on his father to gather the employees and get them to listen to him. He even sent volunteer organizers to Texas during the winter to talk to and organize the workers during their months away from work.\\"Farm Labor Organizing Committee,\\" 2007, p. 442. But the effort largely failed, and in September 1968 Vel√°squez called a strike against 10 tomato growers in Ohio.Barger and Mendoza Reza, 1993, p. 57-58. Five growers signed contracts recognizing the union, agreeing to a minimum wage and limited health insurance, and promising not to discriminate against union members or union organizers. Within a few weeks, 21 other growers had agreed to contracts with FLOC as well.Barger and Mendoza Reza, 1993, p. 58. But in the following year, sustained anti-union opposition from the growers (backed by the American Farm Bureau Federation), the withdrawal of some growers from the tomato market, the refusal of some growers to honor their contracts, and the efforts of some growers to raise wages and improve working conditions (which led employees to abandon the union) caused Vel√°squez to rethink his organizing strategy. In the 1970s, Vel√°squez began focusing on national and international companies in addition to local growers. \\"It was a big mistake to go after individual farmers,\\" he said, \\"instead of focusing on the large corporations. We spent a lot of years doing that, and it was a mistake.\\"Barger and Mendoza Reza, 1993, p. 59. From 1970 to 1983, Velasquez implemented a long-term strategy to build public support for the farmworkers, publicizing the discrimination, low wages, and often appalling working conditions they faced.Barger and Mendoza Reza, 1993, p. 59-60. In 1976, workers at a tomato cannery in Warren, Indiana, struck over the employer's tactic of overrecruiting workers in order to force down wages.Garc√≠a, C√≥rdova, and Garc√≠a, 1984, p. 50-51. The workers spontaneously barricaded themselves inside the cannery, refusing to allow the perishable crop inside until their grievances had been addressed. The workers asked FLOC to intervene. A federal district court issued an injunction requiring that the workers vacate the premises, but they refused. Although nearly all the workers were arrested, there was extensive publicity about the strike, the employer's overrcruitment tactic, the low wages and unsanitary conditions the workers suffered, and the use of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to intimidate workers and avoid paying them (through deportation proceedings). Vel√°squez later said the tomato cannery strike helped improve FLOC's negotiating and worker mobilization skills and provided a trial run for the union's dealings with large corporations.Barger and Mendoza Reza, 1993, p. 60. Vel√°squez decided that the union's first target should be the Campbell Soup Company. The goal was three-way bargaining: The produce buyer (Campbell's) would pay slightly more for produce, which would allow growers to pay farmworkers much higher wages.Barger and Mendoza Reza, 1993, p. 60-61. Vel√°squez asked migrant workers in 1978 to strike growers with contracts with Campbell's, and 2,000 farm workers walked off the job.Serrin, \\"Migrant Workers Organize a Boycott of Campbell,\\" New York Times, July 2, 1984. Vel√°squez required that all strikers be trained in nonviolent protest techniques, and he worked closely with local churches and religious groups so that large numbers of clergy and nuns were present (which inhibited violence).Barger and Mendoza Reza, 1993, p. 61. Campbell's denied any involvement in the strike (claiming the union's dispute was with the growers and not the soup company), and Vel√°squez announced a boycott in 1979. In August 1983, Velasquez led migrant workers on a protest march from the union headquarters in Toledo, Ohio, to Campbell's headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. Four months later, he took out advertisements in newspapers denouncing the conditions in the fields, and Campbell's responded with ads promoting its labor practices. Campbell's said the strike and boycott was having no effect on the company, and the United Food and Commercial Workers and AFL-CIO opposed FLOC's boycott out of concern that it would harm union members working for Campbell's.Ragosta, \\"Boycott Aims at Campbell,\\" New York Times, September 9, 1984.\\"Farm Group Boycotting Campbell Puts Focus on Financial Concerns,\\" Associated Press, November 27, 1984. At the 1984 Democratic National Convention, Vel√°squez strategically positioned farmworkers in the audience with signs reading \\"Boycott Campbell's.\\" Cameras focused on the signs during a prime time speech by Democratic presidential candidate Rev. Jesse Jackson, which raised the profile of the boycott (but otherwise seemed to have little effect). Vel√°squez also encouraged stockholders to sell their company shares, and for schools and parents to not participate in the company's program which donated money to local schools in exchange for product purchases. On the advice of Ray Rogers, a comprehensive campaign expert, Vel√°squez agreed to raise the financial pressure on Campbell. A shareholder resolution to recognize FLOC was introduced at the 1984 company stockholder meeting, but it was easily defeated (27.3 million shares to 263,906 shares). Vel√°squez and about 200 FLOC members picketed the shareholder meeting, which was held under heavy security. Vel√°squez also put pressure on directors of Prudential Insurance Company, Equitable Life Assurance Society, and Philadelphia National Bank, many of whom also were directors of Campbell's, to resign from the Cambell's board or face a stockholder campaign as well. After two years of the widened financial campaign, Campbell agreed to the nation's first three-way collective bargaining agreement on February 23, 1986.Schneider, \\"Campbell Soup Accord Ends a Decade of Strife,\\" New York Times, February 24, 1986. Although it only covered 600 workers at 16 tomato growers in Ohio and 12 cucumber growers in Michigan, an additional 71 growers agreed to hold union organizing elections in the summer of 1986. Vel√°squez soon signed agreements with Aunt Jane Foods, Dean Foods, Green Bay Foods, H. J. Heinz Company, and Vlasic Pickles. A few years later, the growers began complaining that they could not compete with inexpensive Mexican produce. Vel√°squez personally traveled to Mexico, successfully lobbied the Mexican unions to raise their wages and benefits, and closed the price differential. FLOC also began organizing cucumber pickers and pickle processing workers in North Carolina in the early 1990s. Vel√°squez decided to target the Mount Olive Pickle Company, the major pickle processor in the state.Sengupta, \\"Farm Union Takes Aim At a Big Pickle Maker,\\" New York Times, October 26, 2000. Once more, Vel√°squez decided on a boycott when initial attempts to secure a three-way collective bargaining contract failed.Howell, \\"Boycotting Pickles ‚Äì Protesting Treatment of Migrant Workers,\\" Christian Century, January 3, 2001. Vel√°squez personally led a four- day, march from Mount Olive, North Carolina, to Raleigh.O'Neill, \\"Where Union Has Gone Before,\\" Sojourners, September‚ÄìOctober 1998. On September 16, 2004, FLOC signed a collective bargaining agreement with Mount Olive and the growers which covered more than 8,500 of the state's 10,000 guest workers.Greenhouse, \\"North Carolina Growers' Group Signs Union Contract for Mexican Workers,\\" New York Times, September 17, 2004. It was the first union contract for farmworkers in the state, and the first to establish a union hiring hall in Mexico to supply the state with guest workers. In 2010, Vel√°squez led FLOC in joining with the United Auto Workers in announcing a boycott of JPMorgan Chase to protest the banking concern's efforts to begin extensive foreclosure proceedings against homeowners nationwide.Abrams, \\"Baldemar Vel√°squez Represents U.S.-American Farmworkers in Historic Global Labor Code Negotiations in Geneva This Week,\\" La Prensa, October 29, 2010.\\"UAW Launches Protest of Chase Over Foreclosures,\\" Detroit News, September 25, 2010. The same year, he was one of only 15 individuals appointed to a committee of the International Labour Organization to create global working condition standards for farmworkers. Other service In 1990, Vel√°squez obtained a degree in practical theology from Florida International Seminary.\\"3 From Northwest Ohio Are Lame-Duck Appointees,\\" Toledo Blade, November 24, 2010.O'Neill, \\"Union Leader Brings Organizing Campaign to Cucumber Pickers,\\" National Catholic Reporter, July 4, 1997. He was later ordained a chaplain by Florida-based Rapha Ministries. Vel√°squez has served on the board of directors of a number of different organizations. He helped organize the National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit in 1991, and in 2006 served on the board of directors of Agricultural Missions, a nonprofit corporate arm of the National Council of Churches.Agricultural Missions, 2007 Annual Report, 2007. As of 2010 serves on the board of Policy Matters Ohio, the University of Toledo,\\"Board Votes to Work With Union,\\" University of Toledo Independent Collegian, August 30, 2010. and the Toledo Zoo.Condit, \\"Toledo Zoo Welcomed Three New Members to Its Board,\\" Zoo and Aquarium Visitor News, June 23, 2010. In November 2010, Ohio Governor Ted Strickland appointed him to the Commission on Hispanic/Latino Affairs, a state panel which analyzes the problems of and provides information about programs affecting Spanish-speaking people in that state. Honors Vel√°squez has received numerous honors. He received an inaugural Bannerman Fellowships in 1988 for helping organize people for racial, social, economic, and environmental justice.Barger and Mendoza Reza, 1993, p. 134. He was named a MacArthur Fellow (the so-called \\"Genius Grant\\") the following year by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.Smith- Nonini, 2009, p. 119 In 1994, the National Council of La Raza bestowed on him the Hispanic Heritage Leadership Award. That same year he also received Mexico's Aguila Azteca Award‚Äîthe highest award Mexico can give a non- citizen.McDonnell, \\"Mexican Official Denounces Ballot Measure,\\" Los Angeles Times, August 15, 1994. Vel√°squez has also received honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degrees from Bowling Green State University in 1996, Bluffton College in 1998, and the University of Toledo in 1998.

It is located approximately 72 km away from Tiruchirappalli (district headquarters) by road. The nearest town (about 30 km) is Thuraiyur B Mettur.and Thammampatti. Puliancholai can be also reached from Erode or Namakkal. Tourism The area is rich in cultural heritage, being the centre of Chola architecture. Numerous temples, monuments, and other examples of architecture unique to that area dot the region. Lack of a proper shelter or basic facilities is the only limitation for long stays. Apart from tourists, devotees come to trek up to a Shiva temple about 12 km into the forest in June and July. Apart from tourism, their main livelihood is in marginal agriculture and gathering the fruits that grow wild in the forest to sell to local markets. A few hours travel by road would take one to Pachaimalai Hills, another hill range with a 150-ft waterfall. In the neighbouring Perambalur district there are areas like Vettakudi and Karavatti bird sanctuaries. Nature Kolli Hills are known for their medicinal herbs. A few kilometres into the forest, in the higher hills called Agaya Gangai (Heavenly Ganges), there are water falls, part of a river system that feeds the stream at Puliancholai. The stream is known locally as Iyyaar or Kallaar; it grows into a wild river during rains, and is believed to have medicinal properties.

Bare. The crime thriller features Virginia Mayo, Zachary Scott, Elisha Cook Jr., Dorothy Malone, and Douglas Kennedy. The picture was based on a story written by David Lang.. The film tells of mob lawyer Walter Colby (Zachary Scott), whose involvement with a crime syndicate and a femme fatale (Mayo) get him in trouble. Plot The drama begins with a murder and a screaming witness. The witness to the crime tells the police that she can identify the murderer and will never forget his face. Mob attorney Walter Colby (Scott) is called by crime boss Hap Richie (Douglas Kennedy) in the middle of the night to arrange the release of Caesar (Jack Overman), one of his mobsters arrested for the murder. After Colby does so he tells his girlfriend, the unscrupulous mob- connected showgirl Flaxy Martin (Mayo), that he wants to quit the organization and become respectable. Meanwhile, the syndicate arranges for Peggy Farrar (Helen Westcott) to falsely testify on behalf of Caesar. After Caesar is cleared of the charges, however, she changes her mind. Flaxy and Caesar go visit Peggy at her apartment to force her into silence, and Caesar ends up killing her. Due to circumstantial evidence, Flaxy is suspected of murdering Peggy. Not realizing her involvement in the killing, Colby tells the police that he did it, his plan being to defend himself so well that he gets both himself and Flaxy off. Unfortunately, Flaxy and Hap Richie set him up during the trial and Colby is sentenced for Peggy's murder. As Colby awaits transportation to prison, Sam Malko (Tom D'Andrea), a friend of Colby and a former client, tells him that Caesar had been getting drunk and bragging that Colby was sentenced for a killing (the murder of Peggy) that he (Caesar) committed. Sam wonders why Flaxy was not helping Colby since she must know the same information. On his way to prison to serve 20 years, Colby escapes and when he gets to the highway he passes out in front of motorist Nora Carson (Malone). Nora helps Colby get to the city to find out how he was framed. Colby realizes that Flaxy was not the woman she pretended to be. In the city Colby finds Caesar dead. He later ends up in Flaxy's apartment as mobster Hap Richie arrives. She pulls the gun on both men and, as she shoots wildly in the dark, Flaxy kills Hap. Colby calls the police and they arrest Flaxy for the murder of Hap.

He is a Professor for Polymer engineering and Polymer physics at the Technical University of Berlin. Manfred was born in Stuttgart, Germany in 1948. He obtained his PhD in Chemical engineering at the Institute for Polymer Processing of Stuttgart University. He worked as a post-doc in Polymer Physics under Joachim Meissner at the Eidgen√∂ssische Technische Hochschule in Zurich, and in the Plastic industry, then he returned to Stuttgart University in 1988 as Professor for Fluid Dynamics and Rheology. In 1998-1999, he was Dean of the Faculty of Chemical Engineering and Engineering Cybernetics of Stuttgart University. In 1999, he moved to Technical University of Berlin. His works include the constitutive equations for polymer melts, the application of rheology to the processing of polymers, and structure-property relationships for polymers. The focus of his work on rheology is the field of non-linear shear and elongational behavior of polymer melts and effects of polydispersity, branching and blending on melt behavior. The outstanding point associated with Wagner's work is the relative simplicity of the structural picture of the polymer chain and its respective mathematical formulation. His latest contribution to the constitutive modeling, the MSF (Molecular Stress Function) theory, assumes a microstructure-based damping function (developed by himself in the late 1970s) that modifies the tube model of Doi and Edwards by considering the tube diameter to change with deformation. This assumption overcomes the most important disadvantage of the DE theory and produces excellent predictions consistent with the picture of the polymer chain. He has published to date over 100 scientific papers. In 1981, he received the annual award of the British Society of Rheology . The Institute of Materials, London, awarded him the Swinburne Award 2002. Wagner was the President of the German Society of Rheology 1991-2003, and he is Secretary of the European Society of Rheology since 1996. Until 2008 Wagner and Rolon-Garrido are studying the constitutive equations model to improve the rheology model at Polymertechnik/Polymerphysik at the TU-Berlin. Other rheological projects as polymer/additive interactions are being studied by Wagner and Marco M√ºller.

History Gates of Ishtar was formed in late 1992 by Mikael Sandorf (vocals), Andreas Johansson (drums), Stefan Nilsson (guitar) and Harald √Öberg (bass guitar). Eventually, the band recruited guitarist Tomas Jutenf√§ldt. During the band's rehearsal for their demo, Seasons of Frost, Harald coined the band's name, and Andreas designed the logo. In May 1995, Seasons of Frost was recorded at Lucichrist studio. This demo led to the group's contract for its first full-length album on the Finnish label Spinefarm Records. In 1996, their debut album, A Bloodred Path was recorded in the Finnish studio Tico-Tico and released by Spinefarm in June. Due to the popular response to this album, and the band's dissatisfaction with Spinefarm Records, Gates of Ishtar switched to the German label Invasion Records. A contract for two full-length albums was signed, and the band started to work on their second album, The Dawn of Flames. Before work on their second album began, Oskar and Niklas left the band due to personal disagreements with other band members. Henrik √Öberg who was their live guitarist was recruited to play the drums. Still missing a bass guitarist, Tomas asked an old friend, Danjel R√∂hr, to perform as a session musician for The Dawn of Flames. In early 1997, the band travelled to √ñrebro to record at Unisound studio. On March 25, 1997, the album was released worldwide. The band reunited in 2015. On March 3, 2016, drummer Oskar Karlsson died from heart failure. The band is on hold as of 2019.

The art of painting - act of creating paintings.  What type of thing is painting?  Painting can be described as all of the following: * Art - aesthetic expression for presentation or performance, and the work produced from this activity. The word \\"art\\" is therefore both a verb and a noun, as is the word \\"painting\\".  Work of art - aesthetic physical item or artistic creation. A painting is a work of art expressed in paint.  One of the arts - as an art form, painting is an outlet of human expression, that is usually influenced by culture and which in turn helps to change culture. Painting is a physical manifestation of the internal human creative impulse. * Fine art - in Western European academic traditions, fine art is art developed primarily for aesthetics, distinguishing it from applied art that also has to serve some practical function. The word \\"fine\\" here does not so much denote the quality of the artwork in question, but the purity of the discipline according to traditional Western European canons. * One of the visual arts - visual arts is a class of art forms, including painting, sculpture, photography, printmaking and others, that focus on the creation of works which are primarily visual in nature.  Essence of painting  * Emotions  Love * Knowledge * Perception * Creativity * Imagination * Artistic inspiration  Muse  Afflatus  Styles of painting  = Styles of painting by movement = * Abstract expressionism - movement in painting, originating in New York City in the 1940s. It emphasized spontaneous personal expression, freedom from accepted artistic values, surface qualities of paint, and the act of painting itself. Pollock, de Kooning, Motherwell, and Kline, are important abstract expressionists. * Academic art - a style of painting and sculpture produced under the influence of European academies or universities. Specifically, academic art is the art and artists influenced by the standards of the French Acad√©mie des beaux-arts, which practiced under the movements of Neoclassicism and Romanticism, and the art that followed these two movements in the attempt to synthesize both of their styles. * Action painting - connected to the Abstract Expressionist movement, but more precise in its meaning, Action Painting believes in the expressive power held in the actual act of painting as much as in the finished product. Rosenberg defined the notion of the canvas as seen by the artists in this movement as being 'not a picture but an event'. * Art Deco - design style prevalent during the 1920s and 1930s, characterized by a sleek use of straight lines and slender form. * Art Nouveau - decorative art movement that emerged in the late nineteenth century. Characterized by dense asymmetrical ornamentation in sinuous forms, it is often symbolic and of an erotic nature. Klimt worked in an art nouveau style. * Baroque - movement in European painting in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, characterized by violent movement, strong emotion, and dramatic lighting and coloring. Bernini, Caravaggio and Rubens were among important baroque artists. * Bauhaus - school of art, design and architecture founded in Germany in 1919. Bauhaus style is characterized by its severely economic, geometric design and by its respect for materials. The Bauhaus school was created by Walter Gropius. * Byzantine - style of the Byzantine Empire and its provinces, c. 330‚Äì1450. Appearing mostly in religious mosaics, manuscript illuminations, and panel paintings, it is characterized by rigid, monumental, stylized forms with gold backgrounds. * Classicism - based on Greek and Roman art of antiquity with emphasis on harmony, proportion, balance, and simplicity. * Color field painting - technique in abstract painting developed in the 1950s. It focuses on the lyrical effects of large areas of color, often poured or stained onto the canvas. Newman, Rothko, and Frankenthaler painted in this manner. * Conceptual art - movement of the 1960s and 1970s that emphasized the artistic idea over the art object. It attempted to free art from the confines of the gallery and the pedestal. * Constructivism - Russian abstract movement founded by Tatlin, Gabo, and Antoine Pevsner, c. 1915. It focused on art for the industrial age. Tatlin believed in art with a utilitarian purpose. * Cubism - revolutionary movement begun by Picasso and Braque in the early twentieth century. It employs an analytic vision based on fragmentation and multiple viewpoints. * Empire style - sometimes considered the second phase of Neoclassicism, is an early 19th century design movement in architecture, furniture, other decorative arts, and the visual arts. * Dadaism - movement, c. 1915‚Äì23, that rejected accepted aesthetic standards. It aimed to create antiart and nonart, often employing a sense of the absurd. * Der Blaue Reiter - name derived from a drawing by Wassily Kandinsky that appeared on the cover of the Almanac featuring a blue horseman. Established in December 1911 by Kandinsky, Marc and Gabriele M√ºnter their first show was entitled 'First Exhibition by the Editorial Board of the Blue Rider' and was launched to coincide with the last show by the NKV in the same gallery in Munich. * Die Neue Sachlichkeit (The New Objectivity) - Expressionist movement founded in Germany in the aftermath of World War I by George Grosz and Otto Dix. Its artwork is characterized by a realistic style combined with a cynical and socially critical philosophical stance. Other artists associated with the movement included Christian Schad and Max Beckmann. * The Eight - group of American painters who united out of opposition to academic standards in the early twentieth century. Members of the group were Robert Henri, Arthur Davies, Maurice Prendergast, William James Glackens, Ernest Lawson, Everett Shinn, John Sloan, and George Luks. * Expressionism - art that uses emphasis and distortion to communicate emotion. More specifically, it refers to early twentieth century northern European art, especially in Germany c. 1905‚Äì25. Artists such as Rouault, Kokoschka, and Schiele painted in this manner. * Fauvism - style adopted by artists associated with Matisse, c. 1905‚Äì08. They painted in a spontaneous manner, using bold colors. From the French word fauve, meaning \\"wild beast\\". * Flemish School - characterised by idealism and experimentation with perspective, Flemish art thrived in the 15th century with artists such as Jan van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, Hans Memling and Dirk Bouts. They specialised in portrait painting with religious themes and complicated iconography. * Fluxus - movement that encompassed a new aesthetic, a reductive gesturality, part Dada, part Bauhaus and part Zen, and presumes that all media and all artistic disciplines are fair game for combination and fusion. Fluxus presaged avant- garde developments over the last 40 years. Fluxus objects and performances are characterized by minimalist but often expansive gestures based in scientific, philosophical, sociological, or other extra-artistic ideas and leavened with burlesque. * Folk art - works of a culturally homogeneous people without formal training, generally according to regional traditions and involving crafts. * Futurism - Italian movement c. 1909‚Äì19. It attempted to integrate the dynamism of the machine age into art. Boccioni was a futurist artist. * Gothic - European movement beginning in France. Gothic sculpture emerged c. 1200, Gothic painting later in the thirteenth century. Gothic art has a linear, graceful, elegant style more naturalistic than that which had existed previously in Europe. * Graffiti Art - movement which was very successful in New York in the 1980s. It was named after the spray-can vandalism common in most cities and most associated with the New York City Subway system. The two most successful figures of this movement were Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring. The New York art scene embraced Graffiti Art, with several galleries specialising in the genre and a Museum of American Graffiti opening in 1989. * Group of Seven - began in the early 1900s when several Canadian Artists began noticing a similarity in style. Canadian Painters Tom Thomson, J.E.H. MacDonald, Arthur Lismer, Frederick Varley, Frank Johnston and Franklin Carmichael were often believed to have socialised together through common interests and mutual employment. * Harlem Renaissance - from 1920 until about 1930 African-American cultural movement became known as \\"The New Negro Movement\\" and later as the Harlem Renaissance. More than a literary movement and more than a social revolt against racism, the Harlem Renaissance exalted the unique culture of African-Americans and redefined African-American expression. * Impressionism - late-nineteenth-century French school of painting. It focused on transitory visual impressions, often painted directly from nature, with an emphasis on the changing effects of light and color. Monet, Renoir, and Pissarro were important impressionists. * Kitsch - German and Yiddish word denoting art that is considered an inferior, tasteless copy of an extant style of art. * Lyrical Abstraction - Post-War style of abstract painting emanating out of Europe in the late 1940s and a style of American painting emanating out of New York City and Los Angeles in the mid-1960s. Related to Abstract Expressionism and Color Field painting. Practitioners include Pierre Soulages, Nicolas de Sta√´l, Georges Mathieu and many others. * Mannerism - style, c. 1520‚Äì1600, that arose in reaction to the harmony and proportion of the High Renaissance. It featured elongated, contorted poses, crowded canvases, and harsh lighting and coloring. * Massurrealism - fusion of the dream like visions of surrealism, pop art and New Media Technology - as well as for an expression of the Hyper-real. * Minimalism - movement in American painting and sculpture that originated in the late 1950s. It emphasized pure, reduced forms and strict, systematic compositions. * Les Nabis - group of French painters active in the 1890s who worked in a subjective, sometimes mystical style, stressing flat areas of color and pattern. Bonnard and Vuillard were members. From the Hebrew word for \\"prophet.\\" * Naive Art - artwork, usually paintings, characterized by a simplified style, nonscientific perspective, and bold colors. The artists are generally not professionally trained. Henri Rousseau and Grandma Moses worked in this style. * Neoclassicism or Neo-Classicism - European style of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries that drew inspiration from the \\"classical\\" art and culture of Ancient Greece or Ancient Rome. Its elegant, balanced works revived the order and harmony of ancient Greek and Roman art. David and Canova are examples of neoclassicists. * Op Art - abstract movement in Europe and the United States, begun in the mid-1950s, based on the effects of optical patterns. Albers worked in this style. * Photorealism - figurative movement that emerged in the United States and Britain in the late 1960s and 1970s. The subject matter, usually everyday scenes, is portrayed in an extremely detailed, exacting style. It is also called superrealism, especially when referring to sculpture. * Pointilism - method of painting developed by Seurat and Paul Signac in the 1880s. It used dabs of pure color that were intended to mix in the eyes of viewers rather than on the canvas. It is also called divisionism or neoimpressionism. * Pop Art - movement that began in Britain and the United States in the 1950s. It used the images and techniques of mass media, advertising, and popular culture, often in an ironic way. Works of Warhol, Lichtenstein, and Oldenburg exemplify this style. * Postimpressionism - term coined by British art critic Roger Fry to refer to a group of nineteenth-century painters, including C√©zanne, Van Gogh, and Gauguin, who were dissatisfied with the limitations of expressionism. It has since been used to refer to various reactions against impressionism, such as fauvism and expressionism. * Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood - group of English painters formed in 1848. These artists attempted to recapture the style of painting preceding Raphael. They rejected industrialized England and focused on painting from nature, producing detailed, colorful works. Rossetti was a founding member. * Realist movement - nineteenth century movement, especially in France, that rejected idealized academic styles in favor of everyday subjects. Daumier, Millet, and Courbet were realists. In a general sense, refers to objective representation. * Renaissance - Refers to Europe c. 1400‚Äì1600. Renaissance art which began in Italy, stressed the forms of classical antiquity, a realistic representation of space based on scientific perspective, and secular subjects. The works of Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Raphael exemplify the balance and harmony of the High Renaissance (c. 1495-1520). Means \\"rebirth\\" in French. * Rococo - eighteenth-century European style, originating in France. In reaction to the grandeur and massiveness of the baroque, rococo employed refined, elegant, highly decorative forms. Fragonard worked in this style. * Romanesque - European style developed in France in the late eleventh century. Its sculpture is ornamental, stylized and complex. Some Romanesque frescoes survive, painted in a monumental, active manner. * Romanticism - European movement of the late eighteenth to mid nineteenth century. In reaction to neoclassicism, it focused on emotion over reason, and on spontaneous expression. The subject matter was invested with drama and usually painted energetically in brilliant colors. Delacroix, G√©ricault, Turner, and Blake were Romantic artists. * Situationism - influenced by Dada, Surrealism and Lettrism. The post-war Lettrist International, which sought to fuse poetry and music and transform the urban landscape, was a direct forerunner of the group who founded the magazine 'Situationiste Internationale' in 1957. At first, they were principally concerned with the \\"suppression of art\\", that is to say, they wished like the Dadaists and the Surrealists before them to supersede the categorization of art and culture as separate activities and to transform them into part of everyday life. * De Stijl - art movement advocating pure abstraction and simplicity‚Äîform reduced to the rectangle and other geometric shapes, and colour to the primary colours, along with black and white. Piet Mondrian was the group's leading figure. He published a manifesto titled Neo-Plasticism in 1920. Another member, painter Theo van Doesburg had started a journal named De Stijl, spreading the theories of the group. Their work exerted tremendous influence on the Bauhaus and the International Style. * Suprematism - Russian abstract movement originated by Malevich c. 1913. It was characterized by flat geometric shapes on plain backgrounds and emphasized the spiritual qualities of pure form. * Surrealism - movement of the 1920s and 1930s that began in France. It explored the unconscious, often using images from dreams. It used spontaneous techniques and featured unexpected juxtapositions of objects. Magritte, Dal√≠, Mir√≥, and Ernst painted surrealist works. * Symbolism - painting movement that flourished in France in the 1880s and 1890s in which subject matter was suggested rather than directly presented. It featured decorative, stylized, and evocative images. * Abstract art - * Abstract grid art - * Art Brut - * Abstract Illusionism - * Academic Gride art - * Aestheticism - * Altermodern - * American Barbizon school -

He was born a German serf on the royal demesne of Charlemagne. He was educated at his court and became the librarian and councillor of Louis the Pious, king of Aquitaine, son of Charlemagne. When Louis became emperor, he appointed Ebbo to the see of Rheims, then vacant after the death of Wulfaire. Saint Mark from the Ebbo Gospels. Line figurine in colour drawn for Ebbo in Hautvillers by artists assembled and patronised by Ebbo. He was an important figure in the spread of Christianity in the north of Europe. At the insistence of Louis, in 822, he went to Rome and asked Pope Pascal I to become the papal legate to the North. He was licensed to preach to the Danes and he and Halitgar, bishop of Cambrai, and Willerich, bishop of Bremen, went there in 823. He made short subsequent trips, but all with little success. Ansgar was more successful a few years later. When Louis's sons by his first marriage to Ermengarde of Hesbaye (Lothair, Louis, and Pepin) rebelled in 830, Ebbo remained loyal. But in 833 he joined the insurrection and on 13 November presided over the synod in the church of Saint Mary in Soissons which deposed Louis and forced him to publicly confess many crimes, none of which he had, in fact, committed. As a reward, Lothair gave Ebbo the Abbey of Saint Vaast. He then became a loyal follower of Lothair. He remained with him even after Louis's reinstatement in March 834. When Lothair had to flee to Italy, however, Ebbo was too ill with gout to follow and took shelter with a Parisian hermit. He was found by Louis' men and imprisoned in the Abbey of Fulda. Events of the previous year were soon reversed. He was brought to the Synod of Thionville (2 February 835) and made to admit, in front of 43 bishops, that Louis had never committed the crimes of which he had accused him. Ebbo publicly recanted from the pulpit in Mainz on 28 February. The Synod then promptly deposed him. He was again imprisoned in Fulda and later given to Fr√©culf, bishop of Lisieux, and later to Boso, abbot of Fleury. Ebbo was restored when Louis died and Lothair succeeded him in December 840. A year later, however, Charles the Bald was in control of France and Ebbo was deposed a second time. Hincmar was appointed to succeed him in 845 and refused to recognise his acts during his reinstatement. They were declared invalid by the Council of Soissons in 853. Ebbo went to the court of Lothair, but Pope Sergius II ignored his pleas to be reinstated (again). When Lothair had no use for Ebbo, however, he was forced to leave that court and go to that of Louis the German. Louis made him Bishop of Hildesheim (between April 845 and October 847) and it was in this position that he died on 20 March 851, in the seat of his diocese. He wrote the Apologeticum Ebbonis in defence of his reinstatement. It was probably one of his ordinations from the period of his reinstatement who penned the Pseudo-Isidorean Decretals. He also assembled artists at Hautvillers who transformed Carolingian art into a new thing and founded the so-called Reims School. The beautiful Gospel Book of Ebbo is their most well known product. His influence in the Carolingian Renaissance is enormous in the realm of art and illumination.

It is found among all pigeons and doves where it is referred to as pigeon milk. An analog to crop milk is also secreted from the esophagus of flamingos and the male emperor penguin.  Comparison to mammalian milk  Crop milk bears little physical resemblance to mammalian milk, the former being a semi-solid substance somewhat like pale yellow cottage cheese. It is extremely high in protein and fat, containing higher levels than cow or human milk.Ehrlich, Paul R.; Dobkin, David S. and Wheye, Darryl (1988) Bird Milk. stanford.edu It has also been shown to contain anti-oxidants and immune- enhancing factors.\\"Mysteries of pigeon milk explained\\" Retrieved September 22, 2011 Like mammalian milk, crop milk contains IgA antibodies. It also contains some bacteria. Unlike mammalian milk, which is an emulsion, pigeon crop milk consists of a suspension of protein-rich and fat-rich cells that proliferate and detach from the lining of the crop. Lactation in birds is also controlled by prolactin, which is the same hormone that causes lactation in mammals.  Feeding nestlings  Pigeon's milk begins to be produced a couple of days before the eggs are due to hatch. The parents may cease to eat at this point in order to be able to provide the squabs (baby pigeons and doves) with milk uncontaminated by seeds, which the very young squabs would be unable to digest. The baby squabs are fed on pure crop milk for the first week or so of life. After this the parents begin to introduce a proportion of adult food, softened by spending time in the moist conditions of the adult crop, into the mix fed to the squabs, until by the end of the second week they are being fed entirely on softened adult food. Pigeons normally lay two eggs. If one egg fails to hatch, the surviving squab gets the advantage of a supply of crop milk sufficient for two squabs and grows at a significantly faster rate. Research suggests that a pair of breeding pigeons cannot produce enough crop milk to feed three squabs adequately, which explains why clutches are limited to two.

It was originally released for the Sega Saturn on July 25, 1997, and its PlayStation port by Japan Art Media was released on April 23, 1998.PSM issue 8 (April 1998), page 22. Slayers Royal was the third video game adaptation on the Slayers franchise and the first that featured the full motion video cut scenes and voice actors from the anime versions. This well-received game was followed by a non-sequel Slayers Royal 2 in 1998. Gameplay Battle Mode on the Sega Saturn Contrary to its two purely role-playing predecessors in the comedy fantasy franchise Slayers video game entries, Royal is a tactical RPG. The game is split between Adventure Mode and Battle Mode: *Adventure Mode itself has two components, conversation and travel (including visiting in-town locations such as stores and inns as well as dungeons). There is also no free movement while exploring the dungeons and the progress instead depends on the player's story choices. *Battle Mode features an isometric-view perspective similar to this used in Final Fantasy Tactics and is round-based for selecting orders (including a variety of spells and character-specific special moves), followed by their execution ending with a next turn. Each character in the player's party can be controlled either manually or automatically by AI. The fights can take place outdoors and indoors, and the most powerful offensive spells (such as the ultimate \\"Dragon Slave\\", capable of destroying large parts of scenery) can not be used in the latter. Compared to the previous Slayers games, the use of CD-ROM as media enabled addition of FMV cutscenes and a large amount of digitized voice sampling, featuring the voices of Megumi Hayashibara, Maria Kawamura, Yasunori Matsumoto, Masami Suzuki, Hikaru Midorikawa and other main actors from Slayers anime productions. The PlayStation has some new features such as an improved FMV quality, five minigames (such as \\"Slayers Quiz\\"), and the DualShock controller vibration feedback compatibility. Plot Slayers Royal is notable for bringing together Naga the Serpent (Lina Inverse's companion in the prequel stories) with Gourry Gabriev, Amelia Wil Tesla Seyruun and Zelgadis Greywords (Lina's companions in the main storyline) at once for the first time. In the game's storyline, Lina, Gourry and Naga encounter an elf boy named Lark („É©„Éº„ÇØ„ÅÆ) being attacked by the mazoku demons. After rescuing him, they find that the mazoku have kidnapped Lark's sister in order to gain an ancient amulet that is now in hands of Lark. Eventually, they discover the real power of this legendary relic: with it, the mazoku can resurrect the demon king Ruby-Eye Shabranigdu and destroy the world. Reception Slayers Royal was a commercial success in Japan, where the original Sega Saturn release became #2 best-selling game on any platform during August 1997.Computer and Video Games issue 191 (October 1997), page 101 (Freeplay 2). French magazine Consoles + gave a review score of 90% for the Saturn version, comparing it to Riglord Saga and Sakura Wars,Consoles + issue 69, page 117. and later also 87% for the PlayStation port.Consoles + issue 79, pages 94-95.

It is not to be mistaken for another Slayers game that was published by Banpresto for the NEC PC-9801 that same year. An English fan translation for the SNES game was completed in 2010. Gameplay Combat mode gameplay in fan-translated English version The game system is similar to the early Final Fantasy games and other classic Japanese role- playing games of that era. In the main part of the game, the protagonist and her party navigates different areas from a top-down perspective, much like in many other SNES games. When in an area, the player can call up a start menu to access items, perform healing spells, search the immediate area for hidden items, and such. The player can travel between different areas (towns, cities, forests and so on) via a world map. During the battle, seen from a first- person view, the player can tell each character in their party to do one of six things: attack with a weapon, cast of one of the character's magic spells (for magic users), use a special technique that varies from character to character, give up the character's turn for higher defense, attempt to flee from a random encounter battles, or use one of the items from the inventory. The player can have up to four characters (including the protagonist Lina Inverse) in their party. They include almost all hero characters from both the main novel series (Gourry Gabriev, Amelia, Zelgadiss, Sylphiel, etc.) and from the Slayers Special series (Naga the Serpent, Lemmy, etc.) as released at that time. For most of the game, the player has no control over who is or is not in their party, as characters will join and leave as the game's plot determines. After finishing the main game, the player can also select three characters (with the fourth still automatically assigned) to play in a bonus scenario. Plot The game, released about a year before the first season of the first anime series, follows the light novels' continuity. Many characters from the Slayers Special novels are present. When introducing the manga Slayers: Knight of Aqualord, Slayers creator and the game's co-writer Hajime Kanzaka described several of the alternative continuities across mediums, mentioning this game as one of them taking place after the first arc of the novel series, namely after the eighth novel. The game begins with a man finding an unconscious Lina Inverse and taking her back to his village. It quickly becomes clear that Lina has lost all her memories: she does not know who she is, or how to cast any but the most basic spells. Most of the game follows her adventures across different locations in the Slayers world. Gradually, Lina regains her spellcasting abilities and reunites with old friends and acquaintances from the novels. Eventually, Lina and her companions learn that the Greater Beast Zelas Metallium has been creating copies of her. When Lina, Gourry, Amelia and Zelgadiss confront Zelas, they learn that the reason Lina has lost her memories is that she is, in fact, one of the copies Zelas created; the real Lina is being held prisoner by Zelas. After defeating her, the original Lina is freed. At this point, the main story is over, but the game can be continued. The player picks a new name for Copy Lina, and can go on a quest to find and defeat Lei Magnus-Shabranigdu. All characters who have been in the player's party will congregate at an inn in Tells City, enabling to freely pick three characters to re-join the party. Once Lei Magnus-Shabranigdu is slain, the game is officially over. Reception Slayers was Japan's #3 best- selling SNES game during July 1994.SuperPlay 23 (Sep. 1994) p. 25.

Phenol extraction also is a laboratory process to purify DNA samples. Phenol (C6H5OH) is a water-soluble compound consisting of a phenyl group (-C6H5) bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH). In this method, a mixture of TE (or Tris-Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and phenol is combined with an equal volume of an aqueous DNA sample. After agitation and centrifugal separation, the aqueous layer is extracted, and further processed with ether. Then the DNA is concentrated by ethanol precipitation. The phenol extraction technique is often used to purify samples of nucleic acids taken from cells. To obtain nucleic acid samples, the cell must be lysed and the nucleic acids separated from all other cell materials. Phenol is a useful compound for breaking down superfluous cell materials that would otherwise contaminate the nucleic acid sample. There are two reasons why phenol makes such an effective purifier for nucleic acid samples. The first is that it is a non-polar compound. Because nucleic acids are highly polar, they do not dissolve in the presence of phenol. The second is that phenol has a density of 1.07 g/cm3, which is higher than the density of water (1.00 g/cm3). Thus, when phenol is added to a cell sample solution the water and phenol remain separate. Two ‚Äúphases‚Äù form when phenol is added to the solution and centrifuged. There is an aqueous, polar phase at the top of the solution containing nucleic acids and water, and an organic phase containing denatured proteins and other cell components at the bottom of the solution. The aqueous phase is always on top of the organic because, as mentioned above, phenol is denser than water. Nucleic acids are polar, and therefore stay in the aqueous phase, whereas non- polar cellular components move into the organic phase. After phenol has been added to the sample it is centrifuged and the aqueous and organic (‚ÄúPhenol‚Äù) phases form. Phenol is often used in combination with chloroform. The purpose of adding chloroform along with phenol is to ensure a clear separation between the aqueous and organic phases. Chloroform and phenol mix well together, unlike phenol and water. The density of chloroform is 1.47 g/cm3, higher than that of water and phenol. Mixing chloroform and phenol creates a denser solution than phenol alone, and therefore the separation of the organic from the aqueous phase is even clearer than if only phenol was added to a cell sample. There is less cross-contamination from the organic phase in the aqueous phase. This is useful for when the aqueous phase is removed from the solution in order to obtain a pure nucleic acid sample. pH is an important factor to consider in the phenol extraction technique. For phenol to be effective the pH of the solution must vary according to what is being extracted. In the case of DNA purification a pH of 7.0‚Äì8.0 is used. If the aim of an experiment is to obtain samples of purified RNA, a pH of around 4.5 is used. Because of the negative charge on the backbone of DNA from phosphates, decreasing the pH of a solution will lead to neutralization. A pH of 4.5 has a higher concentration of H+ ions that would neutralize the negative phosphate charges and cause DNA to dissolve in the organic phase, while RNA has additional hydroxyl group in pentose sugar which allows the RNA to remain in water phase.

He joined the Labour Party in 1945 and was later a Labour MP.Chambers Biographical Dictionary, , page 6 He was one of the founders of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). Career Acland was the eldest son of Sir Francis Dyke Acland, 14th Baronet, a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) and Eleanor Margaret Cropper.Stenton and Lees Who's Who of British Members of Parliament vol. iv p. 1 Born on 26 November 1906 at Broadclyst, Devon, he was educated at Rugby School and Balliol College, Oxford, before qualifying as a barrister (admitted at the Inner Temple in 1930). He briefly served in peacetime as a lieutenant in the 96th (Royal Devon Yeomanry) Field Brigade, RA. He married Anne Stella Alford, an architect, and together they had four sons, including John Dyke Acland and Robert D. Acland. He succeeded his father as baronet in 1939. Acland stood unsuccessfully for Parliament as potential MP for Torquay at the 1929 general election. He was elected Liberal MP for Barnstaple at the 1935 election, having first contested the seat in the 1931 general election. He was a junior whip for the Liberals. He helped launch the Popular Front in December 1936.The Liberal Party and the Popular Front, English Historical Review (2006) His politics changed course subsequently, as seen in the various political pamphlets he wrote. Common Wealth Party In 1942, Acland broke from the Liberals to found the socialist Common Wealth Party with J. B. Priestley and Tom Wintringham, opposing the coalition between the major parties. During the Second World War, the new party showed signs of a breakthrough, especially in London and Merseyside, winning three by-elections. However, the 1945 general election was a severe disappointment. Only one Member of Parliament, Ernest Millington, was elected, and other figures left, some joining the Labour Party. Acland himself lost his seat in Putney, where he came third.http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge45/i16.htm Labour MP He then joined Labour and was selected to fight the Gravesend seat following the expulsion of the Labour member of parliament Garry Allighan from the party for making allegations of corruption. He won the Gravesend by-election of November 1947 with a majority of 1,675.1947 By Elections Back in Parliament, Acland served as Second Church Estates Commissioner 1950‚Äì51. In 1955, he resigned from Labour in protest against the party's support for the Conservative government's nuclear defence policy, and lost Gravesend standing as an independent the same year, allowing the Conservatives to take the seat, denying it to the new Labour candidate, Victor Mishcon. Later career As an advocate of public land ownership, Acland felt it impossible to reconcile his possession of the Acland estates with his politics; in 1944 he sold his West Country estates at Killerton in Devon and Holnicote in Somerset to the National Trust for ¬£134,000 (2011 equivalent ¬£13.5 million),Gentry, Adam Nicolson, Harper Press, 2011, Part VI The After-Life 1910-2010, 1890s-1950s The Aclands, Killerton, Devon and Holnicote, Somerset, p. 373 partly out of principle and also to ensure their preservation intact. This decision to relinquish the Acland property led to disagreements with his wife and the possibility of separation, but they eventually reconciled; Anne Acland, before depositing her letters, destroyed all those relating to this period of disagreement, between mid-summer 1942 and January 1943.Gentry, Adam Nicolson, Harper Press, 2011, Part VI The After-Life 1910-2010, 1890s-1950s The Aclands, Killerton, Devon and Holnicote, Somerset, p. 370 Corresponding with the National Trust, Acland said: \\"I am not giving you all my property. I am keeping some of it to live on, some of it to buy a house, and some of it I am giving to Common Wealth. With what is left I pay off as much of the debts as possible [these being ¬£21,000 death duties on his father's estate, and ¬£11,000 accumulated debt, equivalent to circa ¬£3 million in 2011], and then hand over the rest to you, leaving you, I regret to say, to look after what is left of the debts.\\" The terms of this deal were kept secret; \\"in widespread publicity from which the National Trust and the Aclands emerged glowing with virtue, the entire transaction was portrayed as a gift\\" and \\"the Aclands held on to... eighteenth-century family plates and dishes, portraits and landscapes, a group of family miniatures, an early nineteenth-century piano... they were able to buy a nice house in Hampstead at 66 Frognal Street; there was to be an education fund for the boys; and Common Wealth received about ¬£65,000, allowing it to win two more by-elections.\\" Additionally, Acland retained some feudal rights, including the gift of the living at the parish church, and entitlement to shooting (\\"to be arranged as to suit the convenience of the shooting tenants\\") and fishing (with one rod on the Nutscale Reservoir).Gentry, Adam Nicolson, Harper Press, 2011, Part VI The After-Life 1910-2010, 1890s-1950s The Aclands, Killerton, Devon and Holnicote, Somerset, pp. 372-5 Acland's sons were in later years displeased with the sale of the estates; the heir, John, left a 1994 document at Devon Record Office outlining \\"how he had made many requests that his mother 'should explain to me why the Killerton and Holnicote estates had been given (sic) to the National Trust in the 1940s'...

A growing number of trailers and preview episodes of new anime have been released as ONA. For example, the anime movie of Megumi can be considered an ONA.

There are many examples of an original net animation (ONA), such as Hetalia: Axis Powers, which only last a few minutes per episode. But while that was true for the beginning of the 2010s, this began to change in the second half of the decade as full series began to be licensed exclusively for streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.

The Qing Empire was represented by Keying, the Viceroy of Liangguang, who held responsibility for the provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi. The treaty was modeled after the Treaties of Nanking and the Bogue between the UK and China, but differed in being more detailed.

It also involves removing features specific to particular linguistic and cultural contexts, to the extent that such a project is possible. The elements of idiom and figurative speech, being cultural, are often also converted into relatively invariant meanings in semantic analysis. Semantics, although related to pragmatics, is distinct in that the former deals with word or sentence choice in any given context, while pragmatics considers the unique or particular meaning derived from context or tone. To reiterate in different terms, semantics is about universally coded meaning, and pragmatics, the meaning encoded in words that is then interpreted by an audience. Semantic analysis can begin with the relationship between individual words. This requires an understanding of lexical hierarchy, including hyponymy and hypernymy, meronomy, polysemy, synonyms, antonyms, and homonyms. It also relates to concepts like connotation (semiotics) and collocation, which is the particular combination of words that can be or frequently are surrounding a single word. This can include idioms, metaphor, and simile, like, \\"white as a ghost.\\" With the availability of enough material to analyze, semantic analysis can be used to catalog and trace the style of writing of specific authors.

Geography As befits its name to many people, Hell has a climate stereotypical of a hot desert (K√∂ppen classification BWh). In the absence of a weather station at the site of the defunct town, nearby Desert Center will suffice. Average Weather for Desert Center, CA History Hell was founded by Charles Carr in 1954. As of 1958 Carr, his wife, and their ten-year-old son Terry were the only inhabitants. Charles Carr served as the lone member of Hell's Chamber of Commerce. Hell was abandoned in the late 1950s or early 1960s when it was isolated by the construction of U.S. Route 60 and U.S. 70. Its remains were demolished and burned by the California State Division of Highways in late 1964 to make way for what would eventually become Interstate 10. Before its demise, Hell had a service station, a beer tavern, and a good supply of drinking water. Popular culture Occasionally Hell was referenced in the press, typically in relation to the weather: *Columnist Art Ryon mentioned in his September 7, 1955, column in The Los Angeles Times that on September 1 it was 110 degrees in Los Angeles, yet only 105 degrees in Hell. *On October 17, 1958, The Los Angeles Times published an article, LA's Hotter Than Hell--Only 97 There, when Los Angeles reached 104 degrees the same day. *According to a UPI news report, it snowed in Hell at least once, causing many to remark, \\"it was a cold day in Hell\\". *On 2015, an Interstate 10 bridge 9 miles from Hell collapsed, leading The Los Angeles Times to report that \\"It's not the pit of Hell, but it's close\\".Hole in California freeway: It's not the pit of Hell, but it's close There were several roadside signs referencing Hell, including one near Indio, California, which read, \\"100 miles of desert ahead--right through Hell\\".

This was a landmark case which is influential in Canadian legal decisions involving proxy-consented, non-therapeutic medical procedures performed on people of diminished mental capacity. Background =Case= Eve was a 24-year-old woman suffering from \\"extreme expressive aphasia\\" and was at least \\"mildly to moderately retarded\\" with learning skills at a limited level.[E. (Mrs.) v. Eve, Eve v. Mrs. E. [1987], 3D.L.R. (4th) S.C.C. 388 (S.C.C.) She spent the week at a school for adults with mental disabilities, and went back to her mother's home on the weekends. Administrators at Eve's care facility noticed that she was developing a close relationship with a male resident, also disabled, and became concerned. Mrs. E, also, was concerned that Eve might innocently become pregnant. Her disability prevented her from understanding the concept of marriage or the \\"consequential relationship between intercourse, pregnancy and birth,\\" and she would be unable to carry out the necessary duties of motherhood. In order to ensure she had the right, as Eve's substitute decision-maker, to consent to the sterilization procedure, Mrs. E requested that: *Eve be declared a mentally incompetent pursuant to the provisions of the Mental Health Act *She (Mrs. E.) be appointed the committee of the person of Eve *Mrs. E. be authorized to consent to a tubal ligation operation being performed on Eve. A major concern of the court was the fact that tubal ligation, in this instance, was non-therapeutic (i.e. not necessary for medical reasons) and that a hysterectomy, which was \\"authorized by the Appeal Division\\", was major surgery. One of the arguments made against Mrs. E. was that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was that a court-ordered sterilization of this person of diminished capacity was depriving that person of her right to procreate, infringing on Eve's right to liberty and security. =Previous rulings= In the Family Division of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island, Mrs. E.'s requests were denied. Although the judge had no issue with the first two petitions (i.e. the appointment of Mrs. E. as Eve's formal guardian), he rejected the third, on the basis that substitute decision makers cannot consent to non-therapeutic surgical procedures. On appeal, the original ruling was overturned. The majority of the three judge panel stated that there was sufficient evidence to warrant the sterilization of Eve, and that the parens patriae powers of the court allowed it to consent, on behalf of the incompetent individual, to therapeutic surgical procedures. That court stated that the parens patriae powers of the court were to be used for the benefit of the incompetent individual, and that sufficient evidence had been presented to convince them that sterilization was in Eve's best interest.Kluge EHW. After 'Eve': Whither proxy decision making? Can Med Assoc J 1987; 137(8):715b-720. Ruling The Supreme Court of Canada, however, ruled in favour of Eve, and unanimously rejected Mrs. E.'s request for authorization to perform a sterilization procedure. The opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada was that \\"barring emergency situations, a surgical procedure without consent ordinarily constitutes battery, [and] it will be obvious that the onus of proving the need for the procedure is on those who seek to have it performed...In conducting these procedures, it is obvious that a court must proceed with extreme caution; otherwise...it would open the way for abuse of the mentally incompetent, ...[they] would allow the appeal and restore the decision\\" of the original court, which had rejected the petition.

Aerial Photo of the N-Reactor. Taken January 2013. The N-Reactor was a water/graphite- moderated nuclear reactor constructed during the Cold War and operated by the U.S. government at the Hanford Site in Washington; it began production in 1963. It was a one-of-a-kind design in the U.S., being both a plutonium production reactor for nuclear weapons and, from 1966, producing steam to allow production of electricity to feed the civilian power grid via the Washington Public Power Supply System or WPPSS.HANFORD SITE: PROCESSES AND FACILITIES HISTORY, Section 2.2 N Reactor Operations Michele Gerber PhD, June 1996 The power rating of the N-Reactor was 4000 MWt, with a power output of 800 MWe at the power generating plant.ANS Nuclear Cafe: Hanford One In an improvement on the earlier Hanford reactors, N-Reactor was built with a confinement building (although not a containment building).

Its membership is the largest pyrotechnic community in the world. The Guild has a yearly convention. People from all over the world come to this event that lasts for about a week.http://www.pgi.org/convention/  Educational and scientific purposes  The PGI strives to promote the safe and responsible display and use of pyrotechnics and fireworks. Fireworks display operator training is offered, as well as classes on specific safety and legality issues. The PGI was founded by Max P. Vanderhorck a former meteorologist from San Diego California fueled by his love for fireworks and the preservation of what seemed (at the time) like a dying American Tradition. The PGI encourages the display of public and private fireworks in conjunction with local and national holidays as well as patriotic and other events. Fireworks are a part of our heritage, and only through their responsible use will they continue to be available. The PGI promotes the production and sale of high quality fireworks. Vendors who are found to be exceptional are invited to display fireworks during the PGI annual convention, as well as to advertise in the quarterly bulletins. The PGI helps channel the creative energies of talented people into the design, production and display of high quality fireworks by example of the membership and through the sharing of knowledge. Many of these talented people would not know each other if they had not been united by the PGI. Information sharing occurs through the quarterly bulletins, during the week of the convention, and through an online mailing list.  Major Activities  1\\\\. The PGI Annual Convention: a week-long event held in early August, in a variety of locations. The convention includes many hands-on activities, such as classes and seminars, and construction of the \\"Superstring\\". There are nightly fireworks displays, each one bigger than the last, as well as fireworks sales and competitions. 2\\\\. The PGI Bulletin: a quality periodical published five times per year, containing guild news, pyrotechnic articles, historical articles, and advertising. 3\\\\. The PGI Website: providing access and information both to members and the general public. 4\\\\. The PGI Display Operators' Certification Course: offering comprehensive classroom instruction, field demonstrations, and written testing for potential display operators.  Friends of the PGI  The Fireworks Foundation, a non-profit group which works to ensure, in perpetuity, the existence of hobbyist fireworks and clubs. The American Pyrotechnics Association, the premier trade association of the fireworks industry, founded in 1948. Local or regional fireworks clubs which allow their members to safely and legally engage in fireworks related activities such as learning what is involved in designing and setting up a display, how various fireworks are made or simply enjoying the show.  History  The Pyrotechnics Guild International was founded in 1969 by Max P. Vander Horck, then publisher of a monthly fireworks newsletter titled \\"American Pyrotechnist.\\" Max envisioned the establishment of an organization for fireworks enthusiasts, whose goal would be not only to educate themselves regarding pyrotechnics, but the media, politicians and public as well. In March 1969 he announced to his subscribers that membership was available in a newly founded organization called the Pyrotechnics Guild International, and the PGI was born. The membership expanded for a few years and in 1974 a formal charter and bylaws were drawn up, officers elected, and formal incorporation accomplished (in Illinois), and the PGI became the PGI, Inc.http://www.fireworkstown.com/NewsDtls.asp?Id=1742 Current membership stands at over 3,500. Members are from all walks of life, and range from people with just a passing interest all the way up to hard-core fireworks enthusiasts. Many regional clubs have sprung up over the last few years and have their own agenda of fireworks related activities.

About half of his pitches thrown were four-seam fastballs in the range of 92-96 mph. He also featured a two- seam fastball at , slider at , and changeup at . He could touch and break with the two-seamer. Bard's changeup was used almost exclusively against left- handed hitters. He used the slider against lefties as well, but much more so against right-handers. Bard's velocity on all of his pitch types dipped several miles per hour in 2012, presumably as a result of his conversion from a relief pitcher to a starter. Bard said he was mildly surprised, but not alarmed by the drop: \\"I knew there‚Äôd be somewhat of a drop-off, velocity-wise, when I went to starting. I didn‚Äôt think it would be quite this big ... When I‚Äôm 93, 94, they‚Äôre just as late as they were on that 97. I think it‚Äôs the way I‚Äôve been able to set it up. If I can just establish strike one a little more consistently, the velocity can be whatever it wants to be.\\" Personal life His brother, Luke, played college baseball at Georgia Tech and was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the first round of the 2012 Major League Baseball Draft.Athlete of the week: Bard siblings are all taking their turn at the plateGeorgia Tech's Bard selected 42nd overall Luke Bard made his major league debut for the Los Angeles Angels on March 31, 2018.

Fatwas are based on the question and answer process found in the Quran, which seeks to enlighten on theological and philosophical issues, hadith, legal theory, duties, and the Sharia law. Sunni fatwas have been used to justify the persecution of Shia throughout their history.Al Qaeda‚Äôs Global Crisis: The Islamic State, Takfir and the Genocide of Muslims, by V. G. Julie Rajan, p.159Doctrine of Terror: Saudi Salafi Religion, by Mahboob Illahi, p.191International Religious Freedom (2010): Annual Report to Congress, pp.124-5 Points of difference While all sects of Islam recognise the Qur'an, they differ in which other authorities they acknowledge; in particular the question of the Succession to Muhammad separates the Sunni, who acknowledge the elected Rashidun Caliphs and their descendants, from the Shia, who acknowledge the Imams or descendants of Prophet Muhammad; these two branches are then subdivided by their views on the further course of the succession. Shia fiqh differs with Sunni fiqh on not only political issues, but also important theological issues. Various attitudes towards Shias can be found among the worldwide majority Sunni community. Opinions The Sunni fatwas on Shias often involved legal opinions issued by an expert in the Sharia law. However, modern fatwas were also given by other Muslim authorities and these were recognized as long as they cite the legal sources used. Some of the notable fatwas are listed below: =Ibn Abidin= However, major Sunni scholars have declared the unbelief of Shias who hold certain beliefs. For example, Imam ibn Abidin, a source of authoritative fatwas for Hanafis writes:Are Shi'as considered Muslims?: http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=7&ID;=1898&CATE;=164 =Ahmad Raza= According to Imam Ahmad Raza, the founder of the Barelwi-movement, most Shiites of his day were apostates because they repudiated necessities of religion. This includes, according to him, the following:Fatwa on Sunni marriage with shia: http://www.islamic.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Fiqh/Sunni%20marriage%20with%20Shia.htm Other Sunni and Salafi scholars who have declared Shiites as deviants or apostates: #Imam Malik - One of his most prominent students, al-Buwayti, asked if it was permissible to pray behind a Rafidi to which Malik responded in the negative. Malik defined a Rafidi as ‚Äúwhoever says ‚ÄòAbu Bakr and \`Umar are not Imams‚Äù.THE BIOGRAPHIES OF THE ELITE LIVES OF THE SCHOLARS, IMAMS & HADITH MASTERS: Biographies of The Imams & Scholars, by Zulfiqar Ayub, p.25. #Ibn Hazm -- \\"Shia are not even Muslims\\", when Christians debating him brought a Shia book as reference.See al-Millal wa al-Nahl ÿßŸÑŸÅÿµŸÑ ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÑŸÑ ŸàÿßŸÑŸÜÿ≠ŸÑ 2/213 #Ibn Taymiya ‚Äî He considered Shiites more heretical than Jews, Christians and many polytheists. Noting contemporary circumstances, he considered Shiites more harmful to the Muslim community than groups such as the Crusaders and Mongols. #Ibn Khaldoun -- \\"astray people\\", \\"Shia are the source of all deviant groups in Islam history\\".http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/Muqaddimah/Chapter3/Ch_3_25.htm Shi'ah tenets concerning the question of the imamate. #Nizam al-Mulk ‚Äî where he fully attacks the Rafida.See his book Siyasatnama, chap 41. However, there are reports that says that he and Malik Shah I after a debate between Sunni and Shi'a scholars which was prepared by him by the orders of Malik Shah I resulted in converting both him and the king to the Shi'a Islam.Mughatil ibn Bakri, In search of Truth in Baghdad (ÿØÿ± ÿ¨ÿ≥ÿ™ÿ¨Ÿà€å ÿ≠ŸÇ ÿØÿ± ÿ®ÿ∫ÿØÿßÿØ), also appearing under the title \\"ÿ±ÿßŸáŸä ÿ®Ÿá ÿ≥ŸàŸä ÿ≠ŸÇŸäŸÇÿ™\\", , p.134-136. Link to item in publisher's catalog: The story is reported by the son-in-law of Nizam al-Mulk, Mughatil ibn Bakri who attended the debate. #Manzur Nu'mani ‚Äî issued a fatwa in December 1987 declaring Shia kuffar (non-believers), which was endorsed by hundreds of prominent Deobandi scholars in India and Pakistan. #Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz ‚Äî Several of his fatwas denounced Shiites as atheists and apostates, and, among other rulings, forbade Sunni marriage to Shiites. #Yusuf al- Qaradawi ‚Äî After saying he had previously been misguided to pursue Sunni-Shia rapprochement, Qaradawi went on to condemn Shiites as heretics in several fatwas and praised virulently anti-Shia Saudi Wahhabi clerics for being ‚Äúmore mature and far-sighted‚Äù than himself in generally judging Shias. #Ehsan Elahi Zaheer ‚Äî Denounced the Shia as infidels and Zionist agents. #Abdul-Rahman al- Barrak ‚Äî In a \\"vicious\\" fatwa against the Shia he concluded with: \\"the Sunni and Shia mathhabs (beliefs) are completely contradictory and cannot be reconciled; the talk of Sunni-Shia rapprochement is utterly false.\\" #Abu Basir al-Tartusi ‚Äî In his fatwa against Shia, he warned Muslims to \\"Interact with the Shii Rejectionists as you would with a person whose very existence is full of betrayal, treachery, fury and hatred against Islam and Muslims!\\" #Ali al- Khudair ‚Äî In his Fatwa fi l-Shi'a, he says: \\"What we have today are the Rafidis [i.e., Twelvers], the Batini Isma'ilis, the Batini Nusayris, and the Batini Duruz. These four groups are the ones who deify the Al al-Bayt [i.e., the family and descendants of the Prophet Muhammed], they seek their intercession and are the worshippers of graves (quburiyyun). So these [people] are infidel polytheists (mushrikun kuffar) and are not Muslims. There is no difference [in status] between their scholars and followers (muqallidihim) or the ignorant among them (juhhalihim). They are all polytheists and are not Muslims and cannot be excused for their claim to be ignorant that they are worshipping other than God (la yu'dharan bi-l-jahl fi 'ibadati-him li-ghayr allah).\\" #Imam Ash-Sha'bi ‚Äî \\"The Rafida are the Jews of this nation. They hate Islam as the Jews hate Christianity. They embraced Islam, not because they longed for it or because they feared Allah, but because they detested the Muslims and intended to overpower them.\\" #Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab ‚Äî In one of his fatwas, he accused Shiites of shirk (polytheism) because of their cult of the saints, which included the adoration of figures such as Ali and Husayn and the veneration of tombs and shrines. #Shah Waliullah Dehlawi ‚Äî He believed that the Shia interpretation and practices of Islam should be discarded, since they greatly misguide people. There are Sunni fatwas that were considered Sunni obligation to the \\"insult offered to the Sunni faith by the Shia religious literature.\\" This is demonstrated in the case of some Sunni fatwas issued in Pakistan, which were considered as defensive materials created for the purpose of defending the faith from the Shia. The latter's mere existence in the country within the context of these specific fatwas was considered as an insult. =Other opinions= In 1959, the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Mahmood Shaltoot issued fatwa that Shia theology is a part of Islam. In 2016, the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Ahmed el-Tayeb reissued Shaltoot's fatwa on Shia Muslims, calling Shia the fifth school of Islam and seeing no problem with conversions from Sunni to Shia Islam.http://ijtihadnet.com/fatwa-al-azhars- grand-imam-shia/ In 2004, both Sunni and Shia scholars released the so-called 2004 Amman Message, which established some form of standards to prevent or at least discredit and counter renegade interpretations such as those made by Osama bin Laden and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. This initiative outlined who are qualified to issue fatwas or legal opinions, promoting a more conservative framework over progressive interpretations. The Amman Message also asserted the common beliefs of the two Islamic sects. Shaykh Faraz Rabbani has noted that it is not the way of Sunnis to make blanket takfir of Shias.

Plot introduction The opening scene of Skinny Legs finds newlywed, Ellen Cherry Charles and Randolph \\"Boomer\\" Petway III driving cross-country in an Airstream that has been welded into the shape of a giant turkey by Cherry's fianc√©, Boomer. During her journey to seek freedom as an artist, Cherry loses precious objects and observes Boomer attain greater artistic recognition. Through a metaphorical belly dancer, Skinny Legs and All confronts the veils of society, and the pain, pleasure and freedom derived as they are lifted. Irony, opposites and parallels, in relationships, art, artists, sex, politics and religion expose the danger of deeper issues in humanity; regarding outmoded gender and cultural roles and rituals, insecurity, guilt, indulgence, gluttony, occultism, war, violence, hypocrisy, greed, and psychosis. The reader is introduced to an array of off-beat and exciting characters, including the estranged couple of artist/waitress Ellen Cherry and welder/accidental artist Randolph \\"Boomer\\" Petway; Spike Cohen and Roland Abu Hadee (a Jew and an Arab who co-own a Middle-Eastern restaurant across from the UN building in New York); fundamentalist preacher Buddy Winkler; a doe-eyed belly dancer named Salome; Detective Jackie Shaftoe; Raoul Ritz, the libidinous doorman turned rock star; pretentious art gallery owner Ultima Sommerville; a mysterious performance artist known as Turn Around Norman; and Verlin and Patsy Charles, Ellen Cherry's parents.

It was the first movie shot in Hollywood, California. It was directed by D. W. Griffith of the Biograph Company (then based in New York City). The film is a melodrama about the Mexican era of California. Background Director D.W. Griffith discovered the little village of Hollywood on his trips to California and decided to shoot there because of the beautiful scenery and friendly people. On May 6, 2004, a monument was erected at 1713 Vine Street, just north of Hollywood Boulevard. The monument was made by Hollywood Forever Cemetery, and the film which was once thought lost was screened at the Beverly Hills Film Festival. This was the first time the movie had been seen by the public in 94 years. The film was scheduled for restoration, with the restored version to be premiered at a later date. For years the first film thought shot in Hollywood was Cecil B. DeMille's feature film The Squaw Man (1914), which does hold the record of first feature film made in Hollywood. The discovery of Griffith's film made it the first movie of any length filmed in Hollywood. Synopsis This story starts some time before Mexican independence was proclaimed in California, which occurred in 1822. Perdita Lergnello, the pretty Spanish senorita, is beloved by Jr. Manuella, a wealthy young Spaniard, who has migrated to the new world in search of adventure. A man of fine qualities, he surrenders his claim upon the girl when he finds out that her heart has been given to Pedro Cortes, a handsome troubadour from the village. Of a poetic temperament, she yields to his plea and marries him. Twenty years later, we see the result of her mistaken marriage to Cortes. Cortes has proven to be a worthless dipsomaniac and reprobate, spending his time and the money she earns at the tavern. The most unfortunate feature is that they have a son, now nearly nineteen years old. Perdita realizes that his father's example is not favorable to the boy's well-being, resolving to save him. At this time, California is in conflict, and Manuella, Perdita's former lover, is now the new Governor, so she appeals to him to provide a future for her son. The Governor takes the boy into his own company. Perdita's son displays characteristics similar to his father, including drunkenness and theft, accumulating in the of robbing his sleeping comrades-in-arms. Perdita has despatched a letter of thanks to the Governor, which he is reading as the drunken boy is brought before him. The tone of the letter induces Manuella to be more lenient with the boy in the hope that she might live in ignorance of his real nature. However, later she writes that she is dying, and believing her son has made a name for himself, she asks to be allowed to see him before she dies. At this moment, the boy is brought before him again having been caught thieving. Manuella is thoroughly disgusted with the boy, but in order to have his mother die happy, he decorates him, making him appear before her as a hero. When she breathes her last breath the medals are torn from his breast and he is sent to prison where the punishment for the pain that he has inflicted.

The second episode attracted over six million viewers.https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/aug/22/overnights Background It was the second major storyline to focus on corrupt Detective Sergeant Don Beech. The storyline follows Beech upon his arrival in Australia, on the run to escape a prison sentence for the murder of DS John Boulton back in the United Kingdom. However, unbeknown to him, Boulton's girlfriend, and ex-DI Claire Stanton is hot on his tail ‚Äì and is ready to bring him down at any cost. The storyline played out over seven consecutive episodes, broadcast during August and September 2001. The first episode, a ninety-minute special, was entitled Beech on the Run. Six sixty-minutes episodes were subsequently broadcast, entitled Beech is Back, parts 1‚Äì6. Synopsis Upon his arrival in Australia, Beech poses as Chief Inspector Derek Conway in order to fool two police officers into giving him a tour of the city. As he begins to discover the hotspots, he begins to set up a life of leisure and luxury funded by crime and various illegal scams, including robbery, drug and arms dealing, and even some dodgy fish importation. Stanton, meanwhile, has enlisted the help of the New South Wales Police Force in an attempt to extradite Beech back to the UK to stand trial for Boulton's murder. However, before she can do so, she discovers that the drugs intelligence squad (Australian Federal Police) are also after Beech, and if she wishes for him to stand trial, she must get to him before they do. However, attempting to stop him from escaping, Stanton shoots the boat that Beech is fleeing on, causing it to explode. Believing him to be dead, Claire returns to England believing justice has been served. However, it is revealed he had survived the explosion, and had used it to fake his death and also return to Britain. He attempts to organise a six-million- pound diamond robbery, only to find himself once again pitted against Stanton. His attempt fails, and he receives life imprisonment for murder, all the various crimes he had committed whilst a police officer, and his activities whilst on the run in Australia.

The game is follow-up to Nintendo's previous title featuring Griffey, Ken Griffey Jr.'s Winning Run. It was released in 1998, and allows players to choose any contemporary Major League Baseball franchise and play through an exhibition, a complete season, or a World Series. Players can also select up to four individuals from any team to compete in a Home Run Derby. The game also features all 30 MLB teams' stadiums. The game was seen as a faster, more arcade-like baseball game compared to its rivaling product, the more realistic baseball simulation All-Star Baseball '99. Nintendo released a sequel the following year, called Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest. Gameplay Batters and fielders abilities are measured with five different statistics: Batting, Power, Speed, Defense, and Arm. Pitchers abilities are measured with three different statistics: Speed, Stamina, and Control. Statistics are measured by a number 1-10, with 1 being the weakest and 10 being the best. Every pitcher in the game has four pitches. The first pitch, which is used by pressing the A button, is always a fastball. The second pitch, a breaking ball, is thrown by pressing the B button. Pitches thrown with the B button include curveballs, sliders, and screwballs. The third pitch is the changeup, and is used by pressing the Z button and the A button simultaneously. The fourth and final pitch is the \\"special.\\" Special pitches include the super fastball, super changeup, splitter, cut fastball, and knuckleball. The special pitch is used by pressing the Z and B buttons at the same time. Batters use the analog stick to move a batting circle to where the pitch is shown to go before it reaches the plate. The batter then presses A to swing. If the batting circle is placed where the ball is thrown, and the swing is on time to when the pitch goes over the plate, the ball will be hit. This feature can be turned off by changing the batting style to classic in the Options menu. Baserunning on offense and throwing to bases on defense is controlled by the C buttons. The button pressed corresponds to the base (Ex. The right C button is pressed to go to 1st base, up to go to 2nd base, etc.). The game accounts for injuries and real time fatigue, seen most clearly through pitchers. This is especially true if the pitcher uses their \\"special\\" pitch too often. Development The game was originally due for release in the third quarter of 1997, but was pushed back to 1998. The music was composed by Steve Adorno of the groups GQ, Devoshun, Seguida ny Latin Rock. On it he played drums, keys, guitar, and funk bass. Reception The game received favorable reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings.

He was born in the frazione of Colle in Borgo Sansepolcro, province of Arezzo, Tuscany, Italy. Biography He is also called Raffaellino della Colle or Raffaello dal Colle. Raffaellino was a pupil of Raphael, whom he is held to have assisted in the decoration of the Farnesina and of the stanze in the Vatican Palace. After Raphael's death, Raffaellino continued working in the Vatican, helping complete the Sala di Constantino though now under the direction of Giulio Romano. After the 1527 Sack of Rome, like most of Romano's studio and most of the foreign art community, Raffaellino and other artists dispersed through Italy, most returning to their home cities. Rafaellino went to Citt√† di Castello, near his birthplace, where he painted altar-pieces for the principal churches, which are now mostly to be found in that town's Municipal Art Gallery.Istruzione storico-pittorica per visitore le chiese e palazzi di Castello, Volume 2; by Giacomo Mancini; Tipografia Baduel, Perugia (1832); page 76-77. He also worked in Borgo San Sepolcro. He worked for the service Duke Della Rovere in Urbino from 1539 to 1543. He also worked with Girolamo Genga, decorating the Camera dei Semibusti, Sala della Calunni, and Cabinet of Hercules of the Villa Imperiale of Pesaro for Francesco Maria I della Rovere, Duke of Urbino. In Perugia, he worked at the Rocca Paolina (1540). In 1536, Vasari commissioned from Raffaellino some ephemeral street decorations to celebrate the entry of Charles V into Florence.

The French, advancing out of Salamanca, were met and defeated in battle by a Spanish army on 18 October 1809. Course of battle The Spanish drew their forces in a defensive line on a low ridge above the village of Tamames. Despite being on excellent defensive ground, the battle opened badly for the Spaniards under General del Parque, who resorted to severe measures to restore discipline. The Spanish cavalry was routed early on, but scathing fire from del Parque's own infantry quickly brought their retreat to grief and directed them back into the fight. Spanish artillery positions similarly fell to the French but were retaken at bayonet point by del Parque's gallant infantry. The French attacked in masses columns but never in enough strength to dislodge the Spanish. Whilst the French had excellent cavalry (a strange occurrence for the Peninsular Wars) the difficult ground meant that they could not be deployed effectively. Immediate French losses amounted to about 1,200 killed or wounded on the battlefield. A vigorous pursuit by the Spanish cavalry increased these losses twofold; the Spaniards captured the French colours and a 12-pounder. Participants of the battle were later issued a badge reading Venci√≥ en Tamames, \\"[We] conquered at Tamames.\\" Forces The VI Corps under Marchand consisted of his own 1st Division (3 battalions each of 6th Light, 39th, 69th and 76th Line), Maj-Gen Maurice Mathieu's 2nd Division (3 bns. each of 25th Light, 27th and 59th Line, and 1 bn. 50th Line), Brig-Gen Jean Lorcet's corps cavalry brigade (3rd Hussars, 15th Chasseurs, 15th and 25th Dragoons). There were about 9,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry and 30 cannon. Del Parque's army included Maj-Gen Martin de la Carrera's Vanguard, Maj-Gen Francisco Xavier Losada's 1st Division, Maj-Gen Conde de Belvedere's 2nd Division, Maj-Gen Francisco Ballasteros's 3rd Division, Maj-Gen Marques de Castrofuerte's 5th Division and the Prince of Anglona's Cavalry Division. Altogether there were about 20,000 infantry, 1,400 cavalry and 30 artillery pieces. The French lost 1,300 killed, wounded and captured. There were 23 officers killed and 55 wounded, including Lorcet. Del Parque's army suffered 713 killed and wounded and 1 gun captured. Strategic picture Del Parque begged the Duke of Wellington to join him in an attempt to overrun Leon and Old Castile. However, the British general refused. Wellington had found the Spanish completely uncooperative during the campaign which culminated in the Battle of Talavera and his subsequent retreat to Portugal. A chastened Marchand would avenge his defeat at the Battle of Alba de Tormes in November. References * Smith, Digby. The Napoleonic Wars Data Book. Greenhill, 1998.

The classes of nef line bundles are described by a convex cone, and the possible contractions of the variety correspond to certain faces of the nef cone. In view of the correspondence between line bundles and divisors (built from codimension-1 subvarieties), there is an equivalent notion of a nef divisor. Definition More generally, a line bundle L on a proper scheme X over a field k is said to be nef if it has nonnegative degree on every (closed irreducible) curve in X.Lazarsfeld (2004), Definition 1.4.1. (The degree of a line bundle L on a proper curve C over k is the degree of the divisor (s) of any nonzero rational section s of L.) A line bundle may also be called an invertible sheaf. The term \\"nef\\" was introduced by Miles Reid as a replacement for the older terms \\"arithmetically effective\\" and \\"numerically effective\\", as well as for the phrase \\"numerically eventually free\\".Reid (1983), section 0.12f. The older terms were misleading, in view of the examples below. Every line bundle L on a proper curve C over k which has a global section that is not identically zero has nonnegative degree. As a result, a basepoint-free line bundle on a proper scheme X over k has nonnegative degree on every curve in X; that is, it is nef.Lazarsfeld (2004), Example 1.4.5. More generally, a line bundle L is called semi-ample if some positive tensor power L^{\\\\otimes a} is basepoint- free. It follows that a semi-ample line bundle is nef. Semi-ample line bundles can be considered the main geometric source of nef line bundles, although the two concepts are not equivalent; see the examples below. A Cartier divisor D on a proper scheme X over a field is said to be nef if the associated line bundle O(D) is nef on X. Equivalently, D is nef if the intersection number D\\\\cdot C is nonnegative for every curve C in X. To go back from line bundles to divisors, the first Chern class is the isomorphism from the Picard group of line bundles on a variety X to the group of Cartier divisors modulo linear equivalence. Explicitly, the first Chern class c_1(L) is the divisor (s) of any nonzero rational section s of L.Lazarsfeld (2004), Example 1.1.5. The nef cone To work with inequalities, it is convenient to consider R-divisors, meaning finite linear combinations of Cartier divisors with real coefficients. The R-divisors modulo numerical equivalence form a real vector space N^1(X) of finite dimension, the N√©ron‚ÄìSeveri group tensored with the real numbers.Lazarsfeld (2004), Example 1.3.10. (Explicitly: two R-divisors are said to be numerically equivalent if they have the same intersection number with all curves in X.) An R-divisor is called nef if it has nonnegative degree on every curve. The nef R-divisors form a closed convex cone in N^1(X), the nef cone Nef(X). The cone of curves is defined to be the convex cone of linear combinations of curves with nonnegative real coefficients in the real vector space N_1(X) of 1-cycles modulo numerical equivalence. The vector spaces N^1(X) and N_1(X) are dual to each other by the intersection pairing, and the nef cone is (by definition) the dual cone of the cone of curves.Lazarsfeld (2004), Definition 1.4.25. A significant problem in algebraic geometry is to analyze which line bundles are ample, since that amounts to describing the different ways a variety can be embedded into projective space. One answer is Kleiman's criterion (1966): for a projective scheme X over a field, a line bundle (or R-divisor) is ample if and only if its class in N^1(X) lies in the interior of the nef cone.Lazarsfeld (2004), Theorem 1.4.23. (An R-divisor is called ample if it can be written as a positive linear combination of ample Cartier divisors.) It follows from Kleiman's criterion that, for X projective, every nef R-divisor on X is a limit of ample R-divisors in N^1(X). Indeed, for D nef and A ample, D + cA is ample for all real numbers c > 0. Metric definition of nef line bundles Let X be a compact complex manifold with a fixed Hermitian metric, viewed as a positive (1,1)-form \\\\omega. Following Jean-Pierre Demailly, Thomas Peternell and Michael Schneider, a holomorphic line bundle L on X is said to be nef if for every \\\\epsilon > 0 there is a smooth Hermitian metric h_\\\\epsilon on L whose curvature satisfies \\\\Theta_{h_\\\\epsilon}(L)\\\\geq -\\\\epsilon\\\\omega. When X is projective over C, this is equivalent to the previous definition (that L has nonnegative degree on all curves in X).Demailly et al. (1994), section 1. Even for X projective over C, a nef line bundle L need not have a Hermitian metric h with curvature \\\\Theta_h(L)\\\\geq 0, which explains the more complicated definition just given.Demailly et al. (1994), Example 1.7. Examples *If X is a smooth projective surface and C is an (irreducible) curve in X with self-intersection number C^2\\\\geq 0, then C is nef on X, because any two distinct curves on a surface have nonnegative intersection number. If C^2<0, then C is effective but not nef on X. For example, if X is the blow-up of a smooth projective surface Y at a point, then the exceptional curve E of the blow-up \\\\pi\\\\colon X\\\\to Y has E^2=-1. *Every effective divisor on a flag manifold or abelian variety is nef, using that these varieties have a transitive action of a connected algebraic group.Lazarsfeld (2004), Example 1.4.7. *Every line bundle L of degree 0 on a smooth complex projective curve X is nef, but L is semi- ample if and only if L is torsion in the Picard group of X. For X of genus g at least 1, most line bundles of degree 0 are not torsion, using that the Jacobian of X is an abelian variety of dimension g. *Every semi-ample line bundle is nef, but not every nef line bundle is even numerically equivalent to a semi-ample line bundle. For example, David Mumford constructed a line bundle L on a suitable ruled surface X such that L has positive degree on all curves, but the intersection number c_1(L)^2 is zero.Lazarsfeld (2004), Example 1.5.2. It follows that L is nef, but no positive multiple of c_1(L) is numerically equivalent to an effective divisor. In particular, the space of global sections H^0(X,L^{\\\\otimes a}) is zero for all positive integers a. Contractions and the nef cone A contraction of a normal projective variety X over a field k is a surjective morphism f\\\\colon X\\\\to Y with Y a normal projective variety over k such that f_*O_X=O_Y. (The latter condition implies that f has connected fibers, and it is equivalent to f having connected fibers if k has characteristic zero.Lazarsfeld (2004), Definition 2.1.11.) A contraction is called a fibration if dim(Y) < dim(X). A contraction with dim(Y) = dim(X) is automatically a birational morphism.Lazarsfeld (2004), Example 2.1.12. (For example, X could be the blow-up of a smooth projective surface Y at a point.) A face F of a convex cone N means a convex subcone such that any two points of N whose sum is in F must themselves be in F. A contraction of X determines a face F of the nef cone of X, namely the intersection of Nef(X) with the pullback f^*(N^1(Y))\\\\subset N^1(X). Conversely, given the variety X, the face F of the nef cone determines the contraction f\\\\colon X\\\\to Y up to isomorphism. Indeed, there is a semi-ample line bundle L on X whose class in N^1(X) is in the interior of F (for example, take L to be the pullback to X of any ample line bundle on Y). Any such line bundle determines Y by the Proj construction:Lazarsfeld (2004), Theorem 2.1.27. :Y=\\\\text{Proj }\\\\bigoplus_{a\\\\geq 0}H^0(X,L^{\\\\otimes a}). To describe Y in geometric terms: a curve C in X maps to a point in Y if and only if L has degree zero on C. As a result, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the contractions of X and some of the faces of the nef cone of X.Koll√°r & Mori (1998), Remark 1.26. (This correspondence can also be formulated dually, in terms of faces of the cone of curves.) Knowing which nef line bundles are semi-ample would determine which faces correspond to contractions. The cone theorem describes a significant class of faces that do correspond to contractions, and the abundance conjecture would give more. Example: Let X be the blow-up of the complex projective plane \\\\mathbb{P}^2 at a point p. Let H be the pullback to X of a line on \\\\mathbb{P}^2, and let E be the exceptional curve of the blow-up \\\\pi\\\\colon X\\\\to\\\\mathbb{P}^2. Then X has Picard number 2, meaning that the real vector space N^1(X) has dimension 2. By the geometry of convex cones of dimension 2, the nef cone must be spanned by two rays; explicitly, these are the rays spanned by H and H ‚àí E.Koll√°r & Mori (1998), Lemma 1.22 and Example 1.23(1). In this example, both rays correspond to contractions of X: H gives the birational morphism X\\\\to\\\\mathbb{P}^2, and H ‚àí E gives a fibration X\\\\to\\\\mathbb{P}^1 with fibers isomorphic to \\\\mathbb{P}^1 (corresponding to the lines in \\\\mathbb{P}^2 through the point p). Since the nef cone of X has no other nontrivial faces, these are the only nontrivial contractions of X; that would be harder to see without the relation to convex cones.

Tafsir al-Qurtubi is also known as Al-Jami'li-Ahkam or Al-Jami' li Ahkam al-Qur'an or Tafsir al-Jami' . The basic objective of this tafsir was to deduce juristic injunctions and rulings from the Quran yet, while doing so, al-Qurtubi has also provided the explanation of verses, research into difficult words, discussion of diacritical marks and elegance of style and composition. The book has been published repeatedly. Features Mufti Muhammad Taqi Usmani (DB) has written in his 'Uloomu-l-Qur'an (An Approach to the Qur'anic Sciences): Al-Qurtubi was a follower of Imam Malik ibn Anas's school of thought in Islamic Jurisprudence. The basic purpose of this book was to deduce juristic injunctions and rulings from the Qur'anic Ayat but in this connection he has very aptly commented on the meanings of Ayat, scrutiny of difficult words, composition and rhetoric and relevant narrations in the exegesis. Particularly the instructions obtainable from the Qur'an for everyday life have been clearly explained. The preface of this book is also detailed and comprises important discussions on the sciences of the Qur'an. Translations This tafsir has been translated into many languages. It can be read in English, Urdu, Arabic and Spanish languages at Australian Islamic Library.Tafsir Al Qurtubi Among the newer translations is an Urdu translation of the first volume by Dr. Ikram-ul-Haq Yaseen.

Effects units that raise or lower pitch by a pre-designated musical interval (transposition) are called pitch shifters. Pitch/time shifting The simplest methods are used to increase pitch and reduce durations or, conversely, reduce pitch and increase duration. This can be done by replaying a sound waveform at a different speed than it was recorded. It could be accomplished on an early reel-to-reel tape recorder by changing the diameter of the capstan or using a different motor. As for vinyl records, placing a finger on the turntable to give friction will retard it, while giving it a \\"spin\\" can advance it. As technologies improved, motor speed and pitch control could be achieved electronically by servo drive system circuits. Pitch shifter and harmonizer A pitch shifter is a sound effects unit that raises or lowers the pitch of an audio signal by a preset interval. For example, a pitch shifter set to increase the pitch by a fourth will raise each note three diatonic intervals above the notes actually played. Simple pitch shifters raise or lower the pitch by one or two octaves, while more sophisticated devices offer a range of interval alterations. Pitch shifters are included in most audio processors today. A harmonizer is a type of pitch shifter that combines the pitch-shifted signal with the original to create a two or more note harmony. In digital recording, pitch shifting is accomplished through digital signal processing. Older digital processors could often shift pitch only in post-production, whereas many modern devices using computer processing technology can change pitch values virtually in real time. Pitch correction is a form of pitch shifting and is found in software such as Auto-Tune and Melodyne to correct intonation inaccuracies in a recording or performance. Pitch shifting may raise or lower all sounds in a recording by the same amount, whereas in practice, pitch correction may make different changes from note to note. Notable uses Numerous cartoons have used pitch shifters to produce distinctive animal voices. Alvin and the Chipmunks recordings with David Seville (aka Ross Bagdasarian) were created by recording vocal tracks at slow speeds, then playing them back at normal speeds. Voice artist Mel Blanc used pitch shifting techniques to create the voices of Tweety and Daffy Duck. South Park Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone throughout the show's entire run have also used pitch shifting for most of their characters One notable early practitioner of pitch shifting in music is Chuck Berry, who used the technique to make his voice sound younger. Many of the Beatles' records from 1966 and 1967 were made by recording instrumental tracks a half- step higher and the vocals correspondingly low. Examples include \\"Rain\\", \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\", and \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\". Electronic musician Burial is known for including pitch-shifted samples of vocal melodies in his songs. Goregrind and occasionally death metal use vocals that are often pitch-shifted to sound unnaturally low and guttural. The famous bass intro to the song \\"Seven Nation Army\\" by The White Stripes, is the result of guitarist Jack White playing an electric guitar through a pitch shifting effects pedal set to an octave below. The band was a duo, who lacked a bassist and had never previously used one in any of their music, choosing instead to mimic the sound of a bass guitar. In the single \\"Diane Young\\" by Vampire Weekend, the lead singer Ezra Koenig makes use of a pitch shifter in the chorus.

In its various forms, the Polara name was used by Dodge until 1973, when its position in Dodge's line-up was replaced by the Dodge Monaco. The name Polara is a reference to the Polaris star, in a marketing attempt to appeal to the excitement surrounding the Space Race during the early 1960s. The Polara was a competitor to the Ford Galaxie 500 and the Chevrolet Impala. The 1960 model year marked the first year that all Chrysler models, except for the Imperial, used unibody construction. 1960‚Äì1961 The 1960 Polara and other full-sized Dodges featured styling cues carried over from 1959 models, itself an evolution of Virgil Exner's \\"Forward Look\\" cars introduced in 1957. The top-of-the line Polara and Dodge Matador continued to ride on the wheelbase of their predecessors, while a new line-up of still full-sized Dodge Darts rode on a shorter wheelbase. The Polara was available as a 2-door convertible, 2-door hardtop, 4-door hardtop sedan, 4-door hardtop station wagon, and conventional (pillared) 4-door sedan. Like these cars, both 1960 full-sized Dodges continued with the make's styling hallmarks of stacked \\"jet pod\\" tail lights, however, the size of the lights was greatly increased compared to the previous year's lamps, with the lower lights set into the rear bumper. The design also incorporated Dodge's trademark shortened tail fins, which, on the Polara, included small vertical tail light lenses placed on the vertical surface at the back of the fin; again, the purpose of the shortened fin was meant to exaggerate the length of the \\"jet pods\\" holding the tail lights. The fins on Darts were shorter both in length and height because unlike the full sized Dodge's, the Polara and Matador, the Darts were based on the Plymouth and used much Plymouth sheet metal forms and the Plymouth rear door. The Plymouth rear door did not have any part of the fin whereas on the full sized Dodges the fin actually started on the rear door (on the 4-doors) and continued back from there. This allowed the fin to start sooner, on the door, and end sooner, relative to the tip of the round tail light and still appear as long or longer than on the Dart. The net effect was that the fins on the Dart look stunted whereas on the Polara and Matador the fins appear in proper proportion to the rest of the car. Up front, the car featured a small grille consisting of eight stacks of anodized aluminum rectangles nested in a massive (and complex) chrome front bumper assembly. As the top model in the line-up, the Polara featured better interior fabrics and trim treatments. Polaras also received more trim on the outside of the car, most notably a chrome stone guard aft of the rear wheel housings, a full-length chrome spear, and a wide chrome base to the chrome spear atop the headlight housings. 1961 Dodge Polara sedan For 1961, Dodge dropped the Matador, leaving the Polara as the sole \\"senior\\" Dodge model. Darts on the shorter wheelbase continued. For 1961, Exner's styling department reversed the car's fins, making them taller as they flowed toward the rear window. As the fins sloped towards the rear of the car, they cut slightly towards the center (to allow the single tail light housing on each side) of the rear of the vehicle, wrapping downward and then back along the side fender to form a C-shaped line accentuated in chrome. The overall effect made the rear of the car seem to \\"pucker\\" from the angles the design created. Up front, the massive bumper treatments that had been a Dodge hallmark since 1957 were replaced with a simple bar design, above which was a massive concave grille shared with the Dodge Dart. The 1961 styling overhaul of the Dodge line-up was different from anything else on the US market at that time (save the 1961 Plymouth, which was equally unique in its styling) and consumers voted on the 1961 restyle with their car-shopping dollars. Sales of fullsize Dodges plunged to their lowest levels since the firms founding in 1914, with only 14,032 units produced in the United States. For the second straight year, the make was carried by the Dart which saw sales of 142,000 units for the year. Total Dodge sales for 1961 were down 53% compared to 1960, dropping the make from sixth in the American market to ninth place. 1962‚Äì1964 All Dodge models were redesigned with a smaller, lighter, sculpted body on a wheelbase for 1962. This was the first Chrysler B-Body. This move came after Chrysler's president overheard and misunderstood Chevrolet chief Ed Cole to have said Chevrolet's largest cars would be downsized for 1962. Chrysler designers were forced to take the planned 1962 Dodge full-size line and shorten the design to fit a more compact wheelbase in a last-minute effort to compete with what was supposed to be a smaller new Chevrolet. However, Chevrolet in fact offered a range of truly full-size cars for 1962, and Dodge and Plymouth alike were stuck with smaller cars the public and motoring press found stylistically awkward. The new Dodge models were sized closer to Ford's new intermediate Fairlane than to Ford's or GM's full-size models. Quickly realizing the critical mistake they had made, Dodge hurriedly put together a new full-size car using the front end from the 1961 Dodge Polara and the body from the 1962 Chrysler. This new full-size model was known as the Custom 880, and became Dodge's top-of-the-line model when it was introduced on January 21, 1962. In 1963 a lower specification version was offered, known simply the Dodge 880. A/C was $455. Among the B-Bodied 1962 Dodges was a bucket-seated sporty model called the Polara 500. It was available as a two-door hardtop and a convertible, and a 4-door hardtop was added in December. Standard equipment included a 305-horsepower 361 cubic inch V8 with four-barrel carburetion and dual exhaust. Positioned beneath the Polara 500 in descending order were the Dart 440 and the Dart 330. For 1962 there was no model named simply \\"Polara.\\" These models were marketed in Canada as the Dodge 440 and Dodge 330, and a Canada-only basic-spec Dodge 220 model was offered as well. The Dodges were available with optional V8 engines of up to . These mid-sized Dodges (and similar models from Plymouth) competed successfully as stock cars in NASCAR races, and in stock-automatic classes in drag racing, where their smaller size and lighter weight gave them an advantage over the larger cars from Ford and General Motors. The basic body of the 1962 model continued until 1964, revised and lengthened by the new Chrysler Vice President of styling Elwood Engel. The Polara range eventually grew to include a 4-door sedan. For 1963 and 1964, the Polara 500 was available only as a convertible or hardtop coup√©. For the 1963 model year, the wheelbase was increased to and the car received new sheet metal. The Dart name was reassigned to Dodge's line of compact cars that had previously been known as the Dodge Lancer. Positioned below the Polara were the plain 440 and 330. The 1964 models received a revised front end and new tail lamps to distinguish them from the 1963 cars. Rear end treatment took its inspiration from the Chevrolet Impala, the Polara models now featuring six small, square-shaped taillights (three on each side) surrounded by an attractive bright trim panel. Lesser mid-size Dodges featured only four taillights (two on each side) and lacked the bright trim panel. A new \\"C\\" pillar for the hardtop coupes, combined with the more attractive front and rear end styling, made the '64s look totally new (and longer/ lower/wider as well), resulting in a significant increase of sales over 1963. The Polara 500 continued as Dodge's sporty mid-size model, competing with the full-size Ford Galaxie 500/XL and Chevrolet's Impala Super Sport, featuring an engine-turned anodized aluminum trim strip along the car's flanks, bucket seats and deluxe vinyl upholstery.

Once again offered in a full range of bodies (sedans, hardtops, station wagons, etc.), the Polara, in effect, replaced the 880 and remained a step below the Custom 880, and the new Monaco hardtop coupe was now Dodge's top model. The previous mid-sized Dodges that were sold under the names Polara 500, Polara, 440, and 330 continued in production under the name Dodge Coronet, their wheelbase shrinking to . These Polaras were criticized for low fuel economy, with some configurations going only 12 miles on a gallon of gasoline. In the 1966 model year, the Monaco would replace the Custom 880 as the mid-level model while a new Monaco 500 would replace the previous 1965 Monaco. 1967 models received a facelift and the hardtop coupe adopted a semi-fastback roof style with a reverse-slant rear quarter window. The 1967 models included new U.S. Government-required safety package that featured an energy-absorbing steering column and safety steering wheel, blunt dashboard controls, more interior padding, and a dual-circuit brake master cylinder. The 1968 model years added outboard front shoulder belts and side marker lights in addition to the 1967 safety equipment. One constant of the 1965 to 1968 models was taut, square-edged styling, which was updated each year. From 1965 to 1970, the Polara would be the only full-sized Dodge available in the U.S. as a convertible.

New safety requirements included front seat head restraints. For 1969, the Polara 500 was reintroduced as a mid-level series between the standard Polara and top-of-the-line Monaco. The Polara 500 was available as either a convertible or hardtop coupe. Available powerplants included 318, 383, and 440 cubic-inch V8 engines, along with a 225 cubic-inch slant-6 engine. The 1969 Dodge Polara models offered the Super-Lite option, which placed a quartz auxiliary \\"turnpike beam\\" headlamp in the driver side grille. The 1969 CHP Polara held the record on the Chrysler test track in Chelsea, MI, until 1994 for the highest top speed achieved by a factory-built 4 door sedan (149.6 mph) until the record was broken by a 1994 Chevrolet Caprice with an LT1 engine.https://www.allpar.com/squads/history.html In 1970, the Polara received new front and rear styling that included a bumper that wrapped around the grill and headlights. The Polara 500 was replaced by the Polara Custom in hardtop coupe, 4-door hardtop sedan, and conventional 4-door sedan body styles. There was also a stripped-down Polara Special available as either a 4-door sedan or station wagon. 1970 was the last year that the Polara would be available in a convertible body style (with a scant 842 produced, making it extremely rare today), and Dodge would never again offer a full-sized convertible. The early 1970 production featured a \\"medallion\\" rear bumper. This bumper was pictured in all of the sales literature, but was discontinued after late August or early September 1969 production and replaced with a plain bumper lacking the center Fratzog medallion. Dodge also discontinued the \\"Super-Lite\\" option at the end of the 1970 model year because of lack of consumer interest and challenges to its legality in some states. The 1970s also received a new locking steering column which locked the steering wheel and column shift lever when the key was removed. The Polara Special was discontinued for 1971 with a new sub-series was the Polara Brougham positioned above the Polara Custom, but below the Monaco. The Polara Brougham was available only as a hardtop coupe or 4-door hardtop sedan. The 360 V8 was also introduced for 1971. The 1972 model year featured a facelift with new sheet metal and the discontinuation of the Polara Brougham model. The 1973 models received new front-end styling (which resembled the big 1970 Chevrolet), without the previous wrap-around front bumper. Sales of the Polara were declining. Having been eclipsed by the Monaco, Dodge discontinued the Polara after 1973. The energy crisis in the fall of 1973, spurred on by the Arab/OPEC oil embargo, resulted in a drop in sales of all full-size American automobiles, which did not provide good fuel economy. The redesigned 1974 Monaco replaced the Polara. 1969 Dodge Polara 500 Convertible, front left (Hershey 2019).jpg1969 Dodge Polara 500 convertible File:1970 Dodge Polara Convertible (29003638944).jpg1970 Dodge Polara convertible '71 Dodge Polara Coupe (Auto classique Bellepros Vaudreuil-Dorion '11).JPG1971 Dodge Polara 2-Door Hardtop 1971 Dodge Polara Station Wagon 1ff.jpg1971 Dodge Polara Custom Station Wagon Dodge Polara Special (Orange Julep '10).jpg1972 Dodge Polara 4-Door Sedan In Argentina Argentinian Dodge Polara In Argentina, the name Polara was used to refer to a series of vehicles developed on the basis of the North American 1967-1969 Dodge Dart. These cars were manufactured between 1968 and 1980 by the subsidiary Chrysler-Fevre Argentina S.A. in sedan and coupe versions. While the Argentinian Polara was badged as a Dodge, it was marketed alongside the Argentinian variant of the Plymouth Valiant (derived from the US Plymouth Valiant, the first and second generation Australian Chrysler Valiant, and third and fourth generation US Dodge Dart). The sedan variant of this line was mainly composed of two models based on the same body, with the basic model sold as the Polara and the deluxe version as the Coronado. The coupe variant's models were also based on the same body, with the basic model known as the Dodge Polara Coupe, the sports version as the Dodge Polara R/T, all these models featured the 225 cu in (3.7 L) Straight Slant-6 engine, and the deluxe high-performance version as the Dodge GTX. This last model came equipped with a 318 cubic inch V8, considered the most powerful engine ever produced in Argentina. Other models in the production line were the Dodge Valiant, Polara GT, and Polara Diesel, all 4-door sedans.Chrysler Argentina S.A., Dodge Coronado and Polara specifications (in Spanish) ‚Äì accessed January 3, 2012 The Dodge Polara line of cars were designed exclusively for the Argentinian market. The interior, especially the dashboard, is similar to that of the early 1970s Dodge Dart‚ÄìPlymouth Valiant cars. The coupes were not available in large numbers, but are collected by enthusiasts. They were hard to sell as gas consumption is high compared to the 4- and 6-cylinder cars the Argentinian consumer is used to. Several restyling jobs of the whole line with new front and rear ends were carried out within its lifetime.

They were sold until 1981. There was also a version of this model in sedan and station wagon built in the 1970s in Argentina of the same car known as the Dodge 1500 until Volkswagen took over Chrysler Fevre Argentina SAIC, including the tooling for the car, in 1980. From then until 1988 the car was sold in Argentina as the Volkswagen 1500 (not to be confused with the Type 3, also sold as the Volkswagen 1500 in most markets, including a similar version with 1600 engine in Brazil). In Canada Chrysler of Canada marketed the Polara as its full- size model starting with the 1964 model year, and all Canadian Polaras were based on the U.S. full size Dodge platforms. For 1964 the Polara was the top- of-the-line big Dodge. 1965 and 1966 saw the Polara 880 and Polara 440 and for 1966 Dodge added a new base series called simply, Polara.

It featured brothers Michael Giles on drums and vocals and Peter Giles on bass guitar and vocals, and Robert Fripp on guitar. The band's music showed an eclectic mix of pop, psychedelic rock, folk, jazz, and classical influences. The group eventually evolved into pioneering progressive rock band King Crimson. Career When the group formed in their native Bournemouth area the Giles brothers sought a singing keyboard player through a newspaper advertisement. Robert Fripp, a guitarist, responded and was hired even though he was not skilled on keyboards and couldn't sing. Between late 1967 and late 1968 the group lived in Brondesbury Road, London. Throughout their time at the house they made many demo recordings. The early demos soon led to a recording contract with UK Decca's newly formed Deram Records division. In April 1968 the group recorded an album The Cheerful Insanity of Giles, Giles and Fripp and two singles, all of which sold poorly. In autumn 1968 the group added Ian McDonald on saxophone, flute and clarinet, and former Fairport Convention vocalist Judy Dyble. Ian McDonald's clarinet overdubs were added to the single version of \\"Thursday Morning\\". Deram then rejected their next studio sessions including \\"She Is Loaded\\" and \\"Under the Sky\\". These later recordings have since been released as bonus tracks on a CD reissue of the album. Dyble did not appear on any of the Deram recordings. On 9 September 1968 BBC radio aired an episode of \\"My Kind of Folk\\" (produced by Frances Line) where Giles, Giles and Fripp backed singer songwriter Al Stewart. Having recently joined the band Ian McDonald played organ on this session. The songs played were: \\"You Should Have Listened to Al\\", \\"Manuscript\\", \\"Old Compton Street Blues\\", \\"Room of Roots\\", and \\"In Brooklyn\\". A recording of this session (21 minutes total) exists. The group continued to record at home; Dyble was only with the group for a short time but did perform with the group on a few songs including \\"Make It Today\\" and demo versions of \\"Under The Sky\\" and \\"I Talk to the Wind\\". One of the melodies from \\"Passages of Time\\" was later re- used for \\"Peace - An End\\" on the second King Crimson album, In the Wake of Poseidon. A collection of the home recordings was released in 2001 as The Brondesbury Tapes. The demos were made on a high quality two track Revox recorder which was modified to allow for overdubs. Though the finished recordings are mono some have excellent sound which is close to studio quality for the period. In late 1968 Peter Giles left the group. Michael Giles, Robert Fripp and Ian McDonald went on to form the first line-up of King Crimson, rounded out by bassist/vocalist Greg Lake and lyricist Peter Sinfield. Peter Giles would go on to appear on the second Crimson album, In the Wake of Poseidon in 1970, and more recently joined with 21st Century Schizoid Band. Dyble would go on to form the duo Trader Horne. In 1971, Michael Giles and Ian McDonald released an album together as McDonald and Giles, on which Peter Giles also played bass.

It is one of fifteen community/junior colleges serving the state of Mississippi. History The college was founded in 1948 as Northeast Mississippi Junior College, and became known primarily as an agricultural school and junior college. The land that the college sits on was sold to the state by Dr. W. H. Sutherland, with the express desire that a college be built in Booneville. The agricultural high school status was dropped a year later. The name of the school changed again to its current form in 1987. It has extension centers located in New Albany and Corinth. Northeast Mississippi Community College's service area is made up of five counties: Alcorn, Prentiss, Tippah, Tishomingo, and Union. Governance Northeast Mississippi Community is governed locally by a Board of Trustees which is made up of fifteen members‚Äìsix members from Prentiss County and two each from Alcorn, Tippah, Tishomingo, and Union counties with one member elected at- large by the Board itself. The member-at-large position is rotated among those four counties. One representative from each county is the County Superintendent of Education unless, he/she chooses not to serve. All members of the Board except the Superintendents and the member-at-large are appointed for five-year terms by their respective county‚Äôs board of supervisors. Terms are staggered to prevent the retirement of more than one member per county in any one year. Academics Northeast is a comprehensive community college with transfer, career, and technical courses in day, evening, weekend, and on- line formats. The college supports students with a full array of financial aid, counseling, placement, and housing services. Mississippi State University and the University of Mississippi offer upper-division classes on the Booneville campus. Classes may also be taken at both the Corinth and New Albany sites. Northeast is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools-Commission on Colleges to award the Associate of Arts and Associate of Applied Science degrees along with professional career certificates. Many of the programs offered by the College are individually accredited by agencies with specific program expertise. Dormitories Students staying in residence are housed in one of five dorms located around campus. With the exception of Mississippi Hall, these buildings are named in honor of former prominent leaders of the college. * Mississippi Hall - This three-story facility was completed in 1990. Expansion and renovation in 2003 brings total capacity to 222 female students. * Murphy Hall - This three-story facility provides accommodations for 168 female students.

She is a successful independent pop music artist, a composer, and occasional collaborator with rock musician Pete Townshend. Early life Born in Ipswich, England, Fuller later moved with her family to Southend-on-Sea. She started playing piano at the age of six and composing music at the age of ten, and her original ambition was to be a concert performer. She attended St. Michaels, a private school in Leigh, where her mother was the school deputy. Rachel Fuller's teenage years were filled with numerous music competitions, songwriting with her best friend Mikey Cuthbert and a lengthy stint as an organist in a funeral home, where she performed up to eleven times a day. Music career As an in- demand orchestrator, with her works recorded by the London Chamber Orchestra, Fuller met The Who's Pete Townshend in 1996, becoming the arranger for his The Lifehouse Chronicles album and subsequent concerts at London's Sadler's Wells Theatre. With Townshend she co-wrote a song titled \\"It's Not Enough\\" featured on The Who's studio album Endless Wire, released in 2006. This song also appeared in Pete Townshend's musical The Boy Who Heard Music, along with the song \\"I Can Fly,\\" written solely by Fuller. Townshend later contributed material to Fuller's musical Ash. Cigarettes and Housework, her first album, was released in 2004 after she was signed to Universal Records by Doug Morris. The album includes musical contributions from Townshend, Pino Palladino and Mark Brzezicki. The track \\"Around This Table\\" featured a spoken vocal from her friend Jerry Hall, who invited Fuller in turn to appear as her sidekick on VH1's reality program Kept. Fuller appeared as herself in the episode \\"Gamesmanship\\". Fuller has collaborated with Delerium, performing her own track \\"Touched\\" on their 2003 Nettwerk release Chimera, and her song \\"Wonderland\\" was picked for the soundtrack of the movie Shall We Dance? released in 2004 on the Casablanca label, starring Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez. In 2006 she released an EP of five songs, called Shine. The songs were partially or wholly reworked versions of ones she had previously released on her first blog, or added to her profile on the Independent Artists Company website. Fuller's song \\"Wonderland\\" appeared on the soundtrack of the American movie \\"Shall We Dance?\\" in 2004. Fuller scored a classical adaptation of The Who's Quadrophenia. The adaptation was issued on CD as Classic Quadrophenia featuring the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and London Oriana Choir, along with tenor Alfie Boe. Pete Townshend and Billy Idol also recorded vocals. The two joined also appeared for the work's live concert premiere, on 5 July 2015 at London's Royal Albert Hall. In the Attic Beginning in 2005, Fuller hosted the show In the Attic, a live webcast of music and guests, including The Flaming Lips, E, The Raconteurs, Foy Vance, Adele and Martha Wainwright from Townshend's Oceanic studios in London and also from the road at UK summer music festivals. Though casual in presentation, the broadcasts use state-of- the-art satellite broadcast technology and they are an attempt to change the way live performances of musical artists can be accessed. In 2006 and 2007, Fuller went on tour with The Who, producing live webcasts of In the Attic and performing her own music live at various venues, including South by Southwest in Austin, Texas. Kew In July 2008, feeling she had been neglecting her singer-songwriter side, Fuller embarked on an ambitious week-long journey to record a full album while staying in her flat in Kew, west London. The project involved Fuller limiting her contact with the outside world, remaining solely in Kew from 20‚Äì28 July (arriving the evening of the 20th), and limiting her excursions to its few local shops. Fuller shared the flat with no one aside from Townshend's dog, Wistle (named after John Entwistle), and online fans following each step of the process via a dedicated 'Week In Kew' website. She crafted one song each day, writing lyrics on the walls of the flat and documenting the experience in the website blog. Fuller also involved her fans by providing interactive services including a live chat room and forum where users could leave feedback and listen to song samples as they were produced. At the close of her week in Kew, Fuller made the entire album available for free on the website. The songs are a reflection of the artistic process Fuller experienced, joining personal stories with observations and reflections on her time spent in Kew, as well as an homage to her chat room fans. Ash On Monday 11 August 2008, a workshop performance of Fuller's musical Ash was performed at the Arcola Theatre in Dalston Kingsland, North-East London, as part of the Grimeborn Festival. With a book by Jack Shepherd, Ash revolves around the lives of and relationship between a teenager, Sarah, who works as an organist in a crematorium and feels caged, and her mother, Louise, who by contrast lives a life with even more abandon than that her daughter herself desires. The show examines themes of life and death and contemporary attitudes to both. Fuller and Jack Shepherd had been introduced by a mutual friend who worked at the Globe Theatre. Ash contains autobiographical elements of Fuller's life, and as part of research, she and Jack Shepherd visited Southend Crematorium in early 2008.

The name derives from the famous song \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" from the first King Crimson album, In the Court of the Crimson King. The initial band featured Mel Collins on saxophones, flute and keyboards, Michael Giles on drums, Peter Giles on bass, Ian McDonald on alto saxophone, flute and keyboards, and Jakko Jakszyk on guitar and vocals. All but Jakszyk had previously been members of King Crimson in its early years. Ian Wallace, another former Crimson member from that same period, replaced Mike Giles in early 2003 after the band's Japanese tour. Further international touring followed in 2003/04. The band played live with sets concentrating on compositions from King Crimson's first four albums and other works from the band members' back catalogues, including McDonald and Giles. They have released four albums, mostly of live work but including newer and/or recent compositions, such as Ian McDonald's \\"Let There Be Light\\" (from his solo album Driver's Eyes) and \\"Catley's Ashes,\\" a Jakszyk instrumental which later appeared on his solo album The Bruised Romantic Glee Club (2006). The band has been inactive since 2004; with members based in different countries, touring proved to be logistically and financially difficult. The possibility of performing again in 2005 was considered following offers from festivals, possibly with Guy Evans (of Van der Graaf Generator) on drums to replace Wallace who had other commitments, but the idea was abandoned. Wallace's death in February 2007 would seem to have closed the lid on the band for good. Jakszyk and Collins went on to record as a trio with founding Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp (and with rhythmic support from fellow members Tony Levin and Gavin Harrison) on the Scarcity of Miracles album in 2011. This was followed in 2013 by the announcement of a new King Crimson formation including all five, plus two additional members.

The species ranges from coastal Washington, through Oregon, and into north-central California.  Description  Thomomys mazama claws Mazama pocket gophers are light brown to black in color, with adults ranging in size from 5 to 6 inches in length. The species has poor vision, but excels as digging burrows with their long claws and strong limbs. The gophers transport food and nesting material by fur pouches on their bodies. The gopher's diet consists of plant material, mostly vegetation, roots and tubers. The gophers exhibit asocial behaviors except during the mating season. Mating is believed to be polygamous. Gestation lasts around 18 days, with each litter averaging 3 or 4 young. Females will usually have one litter per year between March and June.  Ecology  The Mazama pocket gopher is important to the prairie ecosystem in which it inhabits. Each gopher is capable of turning over 3-7 tons of soil per acre per year. Their presence is beneficial for plant diversity, with one study showing 5-48% higher as a result. The gopher burrows are utilized by many frogs, toads, small mammals and lizards.  Distribution  The total population is unknown, but believed to exceed 100,000, a majority of population resides in the state of Oregon. There are 27 known populations in the state of Washington, with an estimated 2000-5000 individuals total. The state of Washington has listed the Mazama pocket gopher and its subspecies found in the Puget Sound area as threatened. = Washington = Mazama pocket gopher habitat The Mazama pocket gopher in Washington has suffered habitat loss, with the remaining habitats being located in unexpected places. The largest populations have been found to reside around Fort Lewis and several regional airports. The Olympic National Park cited as another possible location for a sizable population. A 2005 study reported 6000 gophers living around Olympia airport, but this study has been criticized for its conclusions. The study made count of burrows and did not engage in trapping and marking to estimate the actual number of gophers present. The population is also known to vary erratically, increasing dramatically after the mating season and declining as the year progresses due to predation. This contradicts the estimated population listed on the IUCN database which lists between 2000-5000 gophers in the state of Washington with the isolated populations being representative of all 27 populations. The population of the subspecies indigenous to the area is unknown, with two of the sub-species presumed extinct and Thomomys mazama douglasiis status being uncertain and possibly extinct.  Conservation status  Thomomys mazama mouth agape The species is currently listed as threatened by the state of Washington. In December 2012, a proposal was made by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to list the gopher as threatened. It would apply to the four local subspecies of the Mazama pocket gopher and their prairie habitat. Their prairie habitat in which the gophers live has been reduced by 90-95% in the last 150 years. A translocation project has been undertaken, but a mortality of 90% has been reported. The gopher is also listed as a pest in the state of Washington because it is known to cause damage to infrastructure. The gophers can destroy waterlines, endanger livestock, destroy crops and weaken levees and dams. The conservation of the species has been met with some press coverage. In July 2013, Fox News ran a story about Fort Lewis's $3.5 million grant from the state of Washington to purchase 2600 acres of land during a time when workers were on furlough. Prior to this story, the grant was described by Interior Secretary Sally Jewell as \\"...taking an important step in addressing one of the greatest threats to wildlife in America today, loss of habitat, while helping to ensure the preservation of working landscapes and our military readiness.\\"  Control  Mazama pocket gopher trapping array The gophers are known cause damage to farms and infrastructure through burrowing or consuming vegetation. Mitigating damage can be done by installing a gopher fence, which has to be at least 6 inches above ground and go down to a depth of over 2 feet or until bedrock or hardpan is struck. This fence is considered a temporary and not permanent defense against the gophers. Gophers are unlikely to be deterred by frightening devices like vibrating stakes, pinwheels and other sound devices. While other methods of control exist, the state of Washington's listing of the species as threatened limits the control to non-lethal actions. Taxonomy The Mazama pocket gopher takes its name from Mount Mazama, the ancient volcano that exploded to form Crater Lake in Oregon, where the species was first found. Despite its name, it does not appear in Mazama, Washington. =Subspecies= Subspecies of the Mazama pocket gopher include: *‚Ä†Thomomys mazama tacomensis - the extinct Tacoma pocket gopher *‚Ä†Thomomys mazama louiei - presumed extinct *Thomomys mazama couchi - a vulnerable form in the Puget Sound area. *Thomomys mazama pugetensis - a vulnerable form in the Puget Sound area. *Thomomys mazama tumuli - a vulnerable form in the Puget Sound area. *Thomomys mazama yelmensis - a vulnerable form in the Puget Sound area.

Unlike some other prairie dogs, these animals do not truly hibernate. The black-tailed prairie dog can be seen above ground in midwinter. A black-tailed prairie dog town in Texas was reported to cover and included 400,000,000 individuals. Prior to habitat destruction, this species may have been the most abundant prairie dog in central North America. This species was one of two described by the Lewis and Clark Expedition in the journals and diaries of their expedition. Description Black-tailed prairie dogs are generally tan in color, with lighter-colored bellies. They may have color variation in their pelt, such as dark fur on their back in black and brown tones. Their tails have black tips, from which their name is derived. Adults can weigh from , males are typically heavier than females. Body length is normally from , with a tail. The black- tailed have black long claws used for digging. The body of the black-tailed prairie dog is compact, and the ears are small and close to the head.

Fort Collins, CO: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station: 48‚Äì52. Habits Black- tailed prairie dogs are diurnal. Above-ground activity is reduced when rain or snow is falling and during days when the temperature exceeds 100 ¬∞F (38 ¬∞C). During the winter months, black-tailed prairie dogs do not fully hibernate. They continue to leave the burrow to forage, but will enter a state of torpor at night to conserve energy. Torpor is categorized by a drop in metabolism, heart rate and respiration similar to hibernation, but is involuntary and shorter in duration. On average, black-tailed prairie dogs will lose twenty percent of their body weight during the fall and winter seasons when they go through bouts of torpor. As winter progressed, the amount of time spent in torpor increases. Between different colonies the overall time spent in torpor varies, independent of prairie dog body mass. This may be due to weather during the previous growing season. As black-tailed prairie dogs receive most of their water from their diet, in years with poor rainfall, the black-tailed prairie dogs spend more time in torpor. Habitat Black-tailed prairie dogs are native to grassland habitats in North America. They inhabit shortgrass prairie, mixed-grass prairie,Clippinger, Norman W. 1989.

Number 67. Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan. =Landscape-scale habitat characteristics= At Paignton Zoo, Devon, England Black-tailed prairie dogs inhabit grasslands, including short- and mixed-grass prairie, sagebrush steppe, and desert grasslands. Shortgrass prairies dominated by buffalo grass (Buchloe dactyloides), blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), and western wheatgrass (Pascopyron smithii), and mixed-grass prairies that have been grazed by native and non-native herbivores are their preferred habitat. Slopes of 2% to 5% and vegetation heights between 3 and 5 in (7‚Äì13 cm) are optimal for detecting predators and facilitating communication. In the Great Plains region, black-tailed prairie dog colonies commonly occur near rivers and creeks. Of 86 colonies located in Mellette County, South Dakota, 30 were located on benches or terraces adjacent to a creek or floodplain, 30 occurred in rolling hills with a slope more than 5¬∞, 20 were in flat areas, and six were in badland areas. The slopes of playa lakes in the Texas Panhandle and surrounding regions are used as habitat for the black-tailed prairie dog.Pruett, Alison L.; Boal, Clint W.; Wallace, Mark C.; Whitlaw, Heather; Ray, Jim. 2004. Playa lakes as habitat reserves for black-tailed prairie dogs. In: Wallace, Mark C.; Britton, Carlton, eds. Research Highlights ‚Äì 2004: Range, wildlife, and fisheries management. Volume 35. Lubbock, TX: Texas Tech University: 17. Colonies in Phillips County, Montana, were often associated with reservoirs, cattle salting grounds, and other areas affected by humans. Black-tailed prairie dogs tolerate \\"high degrees\\" of disturbance over long periods of time. New colonies are rarely created on rangeland in \\"good\\" to \\"excellent\\" condition; however, continuously, long-term, heavily grazed land reduces habitat quality due to soil erosion.Rickel, Bryce. 2005.

Overgrazing may occur subsequent to their colonization.Stobodchikoff, C. N.; Robinson, Anthony; Schaack, Clark. 1988. Habitat use by Gunnison's prairie dogs.

Black-tailed prairie dogs were associated with areas intensively grazed by livestock and/or areas where topsoil had been disturbed by human activities in sagebrush- grassland habitat on the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge and Fort Belknap Agency, Montana. Roads and cattle trails were found in 150 of 154 black-tailed prairie dog colonies, and colonies were located significantly closer to livestock water developments and homestead sites than randomly located points. =Soil= National Zoo in Washington, DC Black-tailed prairie dog distribution is not limited by soil type, but by indirect effects of soil texture on moisture and vegetation. Colonies occur in many types of soil, including deep, alluvial soils with medium to fine textures, and occasionally gravel. Soil not prone to collapsing or flooding is preferred. Though they do not select specific types of soil to dig burrows, silty loam clay soils are best for tunnel construction. Surface soil textures in colonies near Fort Collins, Colorado, varied from sandy loam to sandy clay loam in the top 6 in (15 cm), with a sandy clay loam subsoil. In northern latitudes, colonies commonly occur on south aspects due to the dominance of grasses over shrubs and increased solar radiation during winter. Burrows usually occur on slopes more than 10¬∞.Koford, Carl B. 1958. Prairie dogs, whitefaces, and blue grama. Wildlife Monographs No. 3. Washington, DC: The Wildlife Society. Black- tailed prairie dogs mix the soil horizons by raising soil from deeper layers to the surface. This may significantly affect the texture and composition of soil at different layers. Their feces, urine, and carcasses also affect soil characteristics. =Home range and population density= The home range and territorial boundaries of black-tailed prairie dogs are determined by the area occupied by an individual coterie. Coteries typically occupy about 1.0 acre (0.4 ha). Population density and growth are influenced by habitat quality and are restricted by topographic barriers, soil structure, tall vegetation, and social conditions. Urbanization and other types of human development may restrict colony size and spatial distribution. Most plains habitats support at least 13 black-tailed prairie dogs/ha. =Cover requirements= Two adults Burrows created by black-tailed prairie dogs serve as refuges from the external environment and are one of the most important features of their colonies. Burrows are used for breeding, rearing young, and hiding from predators, and are maintained from generation to generation, and serve as stabilizers on the physical and social aspects of the colony. Black-tailed prairie dog nests are located underground in burrows and are composed of fine, dried grass. Nest material is collected throughout the year by both sexes and all age classes. Tunnel depths in central Oklahoma were typically 50‚Äì60 in deep.Wilcomb, Maxwell Jeffers, Jr. 1954. A study of prairie dog burrow systems and the ecology of their arthropod inhabitants in central Oklahoma. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma. Dissertation. Most colonies contain 20 to 57 burrows/acre. The three types of burrow entrances are: dome mounds, rimmed crater mounds, and entrances without structures around them. Entrance features may prevent flooding and/or aid in ventilation. Dome mounds consist of loosely packed subterranean soil spread widely around the entrance of the burrow, and tend to be vegetated by prostrate forbs. Rimmed crater mounds are cone-shaped and constructed of humus, litter, uprooted vegetation, and mineral soil. Black-tailed prairie dogs compact the soil of these mounds with their noses, creating poor sites for seedling establishment.Cincotta, Richard P.; Uresk, Daniel W.; Hansen, Richard M. 1989. Plant compositional change in a colony of black-tailed prairie dogs in South Dakota. In: Bjugstad, Ardell J.; Uresk, Daniel W.; Hamre, R. H., tech. coords. 9th Great Plains wildlife damage control workshop proceedings; 1989 April 17‚Äì20; Fort Collins, CO. Gen. Tech. Rep. RM-171. Fort Collins, CO: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station: 171‚Äì177. Rimmed crater mounds may be used as wallowing sites for American bison. Burrow entrances without structures around them are usually located on slopes more than 10¬∞. The density of burrow openings depends on both substrate and duration of occupation of an area. Vegetation heights between 3 and 5 in (7‚Äì13 cm) and a slope of 2¬∞ to 5¬∞ are optimal for detecting predators and facilitating communication among black-tailed prairie dogs. Grazing cattle keep vegetation short in the vicinity of colonies, reducing susceptibility to predators and potentially expanding colony size. Black-tailed prairie dogs were rarely seen feeding more than 16 ft (5 m) from colony edges in Wind Cave National Park. Diet Cynomys ludovicianus gathering grass Black-tailed prairie dogs are selective opportunists, preferring certain phenological stages or types of vegetation according to their needs. When forage is stressed by grazing, drought, or herbicides, they change their diets quickly. Grasses are preferred over forbs, and may comprise more than 75% of their diets, especially during summer. Western wheatgrass, buffalo grass, blue grama and sedges (Carex spp.) are preferred during spring and summer. Scarlet globemallow (Sphaeralcea coccinea) and Russian thistle (Salsola kali) are preferred during late summer and fall, but are sought out during every season. During winter, plains prickly pear (Opuntia polyacantha), Russian thistle, and underground roots are preferred. Shrubs such as rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus spp.), winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata), saltbush (Atriplex spp.), and sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) are also commonly eaten. Water, which is generally not available on the short-grass prairie, is obtained from vegetation such as plains prickly pear. Koford estimated one black-tailed prairie dog eats about 7 lb (3 kg) of herbage per month during summer. Cutworms, grasshoppers, and old or fresh American bison scat are occasionally eaten. For a detailed list of foods eaten by black-tailed prairie dogs by month, and ratings of those foods' forage value to cattle and sheep, see.Kelso, Leon H. 1939. Food habits of prairie dogs. Circ. No. 529. Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Agriculture. 1‚Äì15 For a complete list of vegetation preferred by the black-tailed prairie dog, see. Social organization Two black-tailed prairie dogs grooming themselves Black-tailed prairie dogs live in colonies. Colony size may range from five to thousands of individuals, and may be subdivided into two or more wards, based on topographic features, such as hills. Wards are usually subdivided into two or more coteries, which are composed of aggregates of highly territorial, harem-polygynous social groups. Individuals within coteries are amicable with each other and hostile towards outside individuals. At the beginning of the breeding season, a coterie is typically composed of one adult male, three to four adult females, and several yearlings and juveniles of both sexes. After the breeding season and prior to dispersal of juveniles, coterie size increases. =Dispersal= Reasons for dispersal include new vegetative growth at colony peripheries, shortage of unrelated females in a coterie, harassment of females by juveniles, and probably an innate genetic mechanism responding to increased density within a colony. Males typically leave the natal territory 12 to 14 months after weaning, during May and June, but dispersal may occur throughout the year. Females generally remain in their natal coterie territories for their lifetimes. Intercolony dispersers moved an average distance of 1.5 mi (2.4 km) from their natal site. Roads and trails may facilitate black-tailed prairie dog dispersal. =Hearing= Black-tailed prairie dogs have sensory adaptions for avoiding predators. Black-tailed prairie dogs have very sensitive hearing at low frequencies that allows them to detect predators early, especially while in their burrows. Black-tailed prairie dog hearing can range from 29 Hz to 26 kHz, and can hear as low as 4 Hz. =Communication= Constantine Slobodchikoff and others assert that prairie dogs use a sophisticated system of vocal communication to describe specific predators.Slobodchikoff, C. N. (2002) \\"Cognition and Communication in Prairie Dogs\\", In: The Cognitive Animal (pp. 257-264), M. Beckoff, C. Allen, and G. M. Burghardt (eds) Cambridge: A Bradford Book. According to them, prairie dog calls contain specific information as to what the predator is, how big it is, and how fast it is approaching. These have been described as a form of grammar. According to Slobodchikoff, these calls, with their individuality in response to a specific predator, imply prairie dogs have highly developed cognitive abilities. He also asserts prairie dogs have calls for things that are not predators to them. This is cited as evidence that the animals have a very descriptive language and have calls for any potential threat. Debate exists over whether the alarm calling of prairie dogs is selfish or altruistic. Prairie dogs possibly alarm others to the presence of a predator so they can protect themselves. However, the calls possibly are meant to cause confusion and panic in the groups and cause the others to be more conspicuous to the predator than the caller. Studies of black-tailed prairie dogs suggest alarm calling is a form of kin selection, as a prairie dog's call alerts both offspring and kin of indirect descent, such as cousins, nephews, and nieces. Prairie dogs with kin close by called more often than those that did not. In addition, the caller may be trying to make itself more noticeable to the predator. However, a predator seems to have difficulty determining which prairie dog is making the call due to its \\"ventriloquistic\\" nature. Also, when a prairie dog makes a call, the others seem not to run into the burrows, but stand on the mounds to see where the predator is, making themselves visible to the predator.Hoogland, J.L. (1995) The Black- tailed Prairie Dog: Social Life of a Burrowing Mammal, Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press Perhaps the most conspicuous prairie dog communication is the territorial call or \\"jump-yip\\" display. A prairie dog will stretch the length of its body vertically and throw its forefeet into the air while making a call. A jump-yip from one prairie dog causes others nearby to do the same. The instigator of the jump-yip 'wave' uses the jump-yip to assess the vigilance or watchfulness of others in the colony - a longer jump-yip wave indicates watchful neighbors and leads to increased foraging by the instigator. Reproduction and development Six-week-old black-tailed prairie dog Two juveniles at the Rio Grande Zoo Age of first reproduction, pregnancy rate, litter size, juvenile growth rate, and first-year survival of the black-tailed prairie dog vary depending on food availability. =Mating= Minimum breeding age for the black-tailed prairie dog is usually two years, but yearlings may breed if space and food are abundant. In Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota, 40% (213 individuals) of yearling females copulated and 9% successfully weaned a litter. The mating season occurs from late February through April, but varies with latitude and site location of the colony. Estrus occurs for only one day during the breeding season. =Reproductive success= In Wind Cave National Park, the mean percentage of adult females that weaned a litter each year was 47% ¬± 14%. Reproductive success and survival may be greater in young colonies that have space for expansion. In a young colony (five years) with space for expansion, in Wind Cave National Park, 88% females were pregnant and 81% of young weaned, compared to an old colony (30 years) with no room for expansion, where 90% of females were pregnant and 41% of young were weaned. =Gestation period and litter size= Black-tailed prairie dog gestation is 34 days. Parturition occurs underground. Information about litter size at time of birth is unavailable, but the mean litter size observed above ground ranges from 3.0 to 4.9 young/litter. Only one litter is produced each year.Hoogland, John L.; Angell, Diane K.; Daley, James G.; Radcliffe, Matthew C. 1988. Demography and population dynamics of prairie dogs. In: Uresk, Daniel W.; Schenbeck, Greg L.; Cefkin, Rose, tech coords. 8th Great Plains wildlife damage control workshop proceedings; 1987 April 28‚Äì30; Rapid City, SD. Gen. Tech. Rep. RM-154. Fort Collins, CO: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment station: 18‚Äì22. =Development= In captivity, black-tailed prairie dog pups open their eyes at 30 days old. Pups are altricial and remain below ground for up to seven weeks to nurse. Maturity is complete at 15 months old. Lifespan of the black-tailed prairie dog in the wild is unknown, but males more than 3 years old experience high mortality. Females may live longer than males. According to Hoogland and others, lifespan is about 5 years for males and 7 years for females. Mortality Major mortality factors include predation, disease, infanticide, habitat loss, poisoning, trapping, and shooting. Survival for the first year was 54% for females and less than 50% for males in Wind Cave National Park. Primary causes of death were predation and infanticide. Infanticide partially or totally eliminated 39% (361 individuals) of all litters. Lactating females were the most common killers. Mortality of young was highest due to heavy predation during the winter and early spring following birth. Mortality increases with dispersal from a colony or coterie. Sylvatic plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, can quickly eliminate entire black-tailed prairie dog colonies. Once infected, death occurs within a few days. Black-tailed prairie dogs are also susceptible to diseases transmitted by introduced animals.Brown, David E.; Davis, Russell. 1998. Terrestrial bird and mammal distribution changes in the American Southwest, 1890‚Äì1990. In: Tellman, Barbara; Finch, Deborah M.; Edminster, Carl; Hamre, Robert, eds. The future of arid grasslands: identifying issues, seeking solutions: Proceedings; 1996 October 9‚Äì13; Tucson, AZ. Proceedings RMRS-P-3. Fort Collins, CO: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station: 47‚Äì64. =Predators= The most common predators of black-tailed prairie dogs are coyotes (Canis latrans), American badgers (Taxidea taxus), bobcats (Lynx rufus), golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), ferruginous hawks (Buteo regalis), red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), and prairie rattlesnakes (Crotalus viridis). Although now very rare, black-footed ferrets (Mustela nigripes) were once a major predator of the black-tailed prairie dog.Hillman, Conrad N. 1968. Life history and ecology of the black-footed ferret in the wild. Brookings, SD: South Dakota State University. Thesis. Ecological role and threats Black-tailed prairie dogs have been called \\"ecosystem engineers\\" due to their influence on the biotic and abiotic characteristics of their habitat, landscape architecture, and ecosystem structure and function. Research suggests black-tailed prairie dogs are a keystone species in some, but not all, geographic areas. Black-tailed prairie dogs enhance the diversity of vegetation, vertebrates, and invertebrates through their foraging and burrowing activities and by their presence as prey items. Grasslands inhabited by black-tailed prairie dogs support higher biodiversity than grasslands not occupied by them. Hundreds of species of vertebrates and invertebrates are associated with black-tailed prairie dog colonies. Vertebrate species richness on their colonies increases with colony size and density. West of the Missouri River in Montana, 40% (100 species) of all vertebrate fauna in prairie habitats rely on black-tailed prairie dog colonies for food, nesting, and/or denning. Rare and declining species, such as the black-footed ferret, swift fox (Vulpes velox), mountain plover (Charadrius montanus), and burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) are associated with colonies. Because their foraging activities keep plant development in a suppressed vegetative state with higher nutritional qualities, herbivores, including American bison, pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), and domestic cattle often prefer foraging in black- tailed prairie dog colonies. Animals that depend on herbaceous cover in sagebrush habitat, such as mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and sage grouse (Centrocercus spp.), may be deterred by the decreased vegetative cover on black-tailed prairie dog colonies. For a list of vertebrate species associated with black-tailed prairie dog colonies, see. Biodiversity in shortgrass prairies may be at risk due to the reductions in distribution and occurrence of black-tailed prairie dog. Threats include fragmentation and loss of habitat, unregulated eradication or control efforts, and sylvatic plague. As a result of habitat fragmentation and prairie dog eradication programs, colonies are now smaller and more fragmented than in presettlement times. Agriculture, livestock use, and other development have reduced habitat to 2% of its former range. Fragmented colonies are more susceptible to extirpation, primarily by sylvatic plague. The effect of roads on black-tailed prairie dogs is debatable. Roads may either facilitate or hinder their movement, depending on the landscape setting. Roads may be easy routes for dispersal, but those with heavy automobile use may increase mortality. Roads, streams, and lakes may serve as barriers to sylvatic plague. Conservation status Kissing prairie dogs Black-tailed prairie dogs are frequently exterminated from ranchland, being viewed as pests. Their habitat has been fragmented, and their numbers have been greatly reduced. Additionally, they are remarkably susceptible to plague. In 2006, all eight appearances of plague in black-tailed prairie dog colonies resulted in total colony loss. Studies in 1961 estimated only of occupied black-tailed prairie dog habitat in the United States. A second study in 2000 showed . However, a comprehensive study between 10 states and various tribes in 2004 estimated in the United States, plus an additional in Mexico and Canada. Based on the 2004 studies, the US Fish and Wildlife Service removed the black-tailed prairie dog from the Endangered Species Act Candidate Species List in August 2004.Black-tailed prairie dog United States Fish and Wildlife Service Interactions with domestic livestock A black-tailed prairie dog eating a peanut While black-tailed prairie dogs are often regarded as competitors with livestock for available forage, evidence of impacts on rangelands are mixed. Some research suggests they have either neutral or beneficial effects on rangeland used by livestock; however, their effects on rangelands are not uniform. In Cimarron National Grassland in southwest Kansas and adjacent private lands in Baca County, Colorado, some vegetational differences were detected between areas colonized by black-tailed prairie dogs and uncolonized areas, although not all differences were consistent between sample years. Species richness and diversity indices did not differ among colonized and uncolonized sites in either year, nor did the amount of bare ground. The authors conclude while prairie dogs alter shortgrass prairie such that the vegetation of colonies tends to be distinct from adjacent uncolonized areas, \\"prairie dogs do not substantially alter the essential character of shortgrass vegetation\\". Cattle neither significantly preferred nor avoided black-tailed prairie dog colonies in a study in the shortgrass steppe of northeastern Colorado. Cattle used colonies in proportion to the colony's availability, and grazed as intensively on colonies as on areas not occupied by black-tailed prairie dogs. Competitive interactions between black-tailed prairie dogs and domestic livestock for preferred forage species are unclear. Several studies suggest black-tailed prairie dogs avoid eating many plants that livestock prefer, and prefer many plants livestock avoid. Conversely, on shortgrass prairie in Colorado, cattle and black-tailed prairie dogs had a 64% similarity in annual diets. Some changes in plant composition brought about by black-tailed prairie dogs may benefit livestock by encouraging an increase in plants more tolerant of grazing, such as needleleaf sedge (Carex duriuscula), sixweeks grass (Vulpia octoflora), and scarlet globemallow. Grazing by black- tailed prairie dogs may also improve the nutritional qualities of some plants. On a shortgrass prairie near Fort Collins, Colorado, plant species diversity was greater inside black-tailed prairie dog colonies than outside of colonies, and perennial grasses such as buffalo grass and forbs increased. While black- tailed prairie dog colonies at Wind Cave National Park typically had lower levels of plant biomass and were dominated by forbs, plants growing on prairie dog colonies had higher leaf nitrogen concentrations than plants in mixed- grass prairie outside colonies. Foraging by black-tailed prairie dogs does not significantly affect steer weights. While forage availability and use by cattle decreased in black-tailed prairie dog foraging areas, steer weight was not reduced significantly in either of two years of study at the USDA's Southern Great Plains Experimental Range near Woodward, Oklahoma. Nutrient cycling, increased soil fertility, and subsequent changes in forage quality partly compensated for reduced forage availability. Pet trade Black-tailed prairie dogs were the most common prairie dog species collected in the wild for sale as exotic pets, until this trade was banned in 2003 by the United States federal government.

During that year, Muhammad and his followers migrated from Mecca to Yathrib (now Medina). This event, known as the Hijra, is commemorated in Islam for its role in the founding of the first Muslim community (ummah). In the West, this era is most commonly denoted as AH ( , 'in the year of the Hijra') in parallel with the Christian (AD), Common (CE) and Jewish eras (AM) and can similarly be placed before or after the date. In predominantly Muslim countries, it is also commonly abbreviated H (\\"Hijra\\") from its Arabic abbreviation hƒÅ æ (). Years prior to AH 1 are reckoned in English as BH (\\"Before the Hijra\\"), which should follow the date.. Because the Islamic lunar calendar has only 354 or 355 days in its year, it slowly rotates relative to the Gregorian calendar year. The year CE corresponds to the Islamic years AH - . AH 1440 corresponds to 20182019 in the Common Era. Definition The Hijri era is calculated according to the Islamic lunar calendar and not the Julian or Gregorian solar one. It thus does not begin on January 1, 1 CE, but on the first day of the month of Muharram, which occurred in 622 CE. Its Julian equivalent was April 19.Fazlur Rehman Shaikh, Chronology of Prophetic Events (London: Ta-Ha Publishers Ltd., 2001), p. 157. The date of the Hijra itself did not form the Islamic New Year. Instead, the system continues the earlier ordering of the months, with the Hijra occurring around the 8th day of Rabi al-Awwal, 66 days into the first year. History =Predecessors= By the age of Muhammad, there was already an Arabian lunar calendar, with named months. Likewise, the years of its calendar used conventional names rather than numbers: for example, the year of the birth of Muhammad and of Ammar ibn Yasir (570 CE) was known as the \\"Year of the Elephant\\".Hajjah Adil, Amina, \\"Prophet Muhammad\\", ISCA, Jun 1, 2002, The first year of the Hijra (622-23 CE) was named the \\"Permission to Travel\\" in this calendar. =Establishment= 17 years after the Hijra, a complaint from Abu Musa Ashaari prompted the caliph Umar to abolish the practice of named years and to establish a new calendar era. Umar chose as epoch for the new Muslim calendar the hijrah, the emigration of Muhammad and 70 Muslims from Mecca to Medina.The Beginning of Hijri calendar Paul Lunde, Saudi Aramco World Magazine (November/December 2005), retrieved 1/1/2019 Tradition credits Othman with the successful proposal, simply continuing the order of the months that had already been established, beginning with Muharram. Adoption of this calendar was then enforced by Umar.  Formula  Different approximate conversion formulas between the Gregorian (AD or CE) and Islamic calendars (AH) are possible:Islamic and Christian Dating Systems AH = 1.030684 √ó (CE ‚àí 621.5643) CE = 0.970229 √ó AH + 621.5643 or AH = (CE ‚àí 622) √ó 33 √∑ 32 CE = AH + 622 ‚àí (AH √∑ 32) Given that the Islamic New Year does not begin January 1 and that a Hijri calendar year is 11 days shorter than a Gregorian calendar year, there is no direct correspondence between years of the two eras. A given Hijri year will usually fall in two successive Gregorian years. A CE year will always overlap two or occasionally three successive Hijri years. For example, the year 2008 CE maps to the last week of AH 1428, all of 1429, and the first few days of 1430.Islamic Crescents' Observation Project, Visibility of Muharram Crescent 1430 AH Similarly, the year 2041 CE will correspond with the last few days of AH 1462, all of 1463, and the first week of 1464.

Early life Samedbey Mehmandarov was born on October 16, 1855 in Lankaran, Azerbaijan in a noble family originally from Shusha. He graduated from 2nd Constantine Military School in St. Petersburg in 1875, was conferred the rank of podporuchik and assigned to 1st Turkestan artillery brigade. In the course of military service he was promoted to poruchik in 1877 and seconded two years later to 2nd artillery brigade in St. Petersburg. Active duty In 1885 shtabs-kapitan Mehmandarov was assigned to 38th artillery brigade in the Caucasus, where he served 9 years. In 1894, 38th artillery brigade was transferred to Poland, where he became a member of court martial. In 1898, captain Mehmandarov was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and appointed the commander of 1st battery of 3rd artillery battalion. The same year, Mehmandarov‚Äôs battery was moved to Transbaikal region and took part in China Relief Expedition in 1901. For the services in battle Mehmandarov was conferred the rank of colonel. In 1903 he completed a course in Tsarskoye Selo Officer's Artillery College. When the Russo-Japanese War broke out in 1904, Mehmandarov was appointed the commander of 7th Eastern Siberia artillery battalion. During the siege of Port Arthur he was the commander of the Eastern Front Artillery. For the services in battle he was promoted to major general and decorated with the Order of Saint George of IV degree. After the capitulation of the fortress the garrison was in Japanese captivity. When Japanese commanders allowed the captured Russian officers to return home in exchange to signing an obligation not to fight against Japan, Mehmandarov refused and preferred to stay with his soldiers. Upon his return from captivity Mehmandarov was appointed the commander of 7th East Siberian Artillery Brigade in 1906, and became the commander of 3rd Siberian Army Corps artillery a year later. In 1908, he was conferred the rank of lieutenant- general. In 1910, he was appointed the commander of 1st Caucasus Division; in 1913 he became the commander of 21st Infantry Division and in this position entered World War I within 3rd Caucasus Army Corps. Under Mehmandarov‚Äôs command the division earned the reputation of one of the best in the Russian Army, and 81st Apsheron and 83rd Samur regiments especially distinguished themselves. He was decorated with the Order of Saint George of III degree for the battles of 27 ‚Äì 29 September 1914, and Saint George Sword decorated with diamonds for the battle near Ivangorod on 14 February 1915. The latter was a very rare military award, only eight Russian commanders received it during the entire course of the World War I. On December 11, 1914 Mehmandarov was appointed the commander of 2nd Caucasus Army Corps. Mehmandarov‚Äôs corps was engaged in the fiercest battles with German troops and during the whole war had not surrendered to the enemy a single piece of ordnance. On 22 March 1915 Samedbey Mehmandarov was promoted to the rank of the General of the Artillery. He was decorated with British, French and Romanian orders. Azerbaijan Democratic Republic S.

While the consensus among physicists is that gravity will attract both matter and antimatter at the same rate that matter attracts matter, there is a strong desire to confirm this experimentally- although simple algebra shows that the presence of two photons with positive energies following electron/positron annihilations observed frequently in nature is extremely strong evidence that antimatter has positive mass and thus would act like regular matter under gravity. Antimatter's rarity and tendency to annihilate when brought into contact with matter makes its study a technically demanding task. Furthermore, gravity is much weaker than the other fundamental forces, for reasons still of interest to physicists, complicating efforts to study gravity in systems small enough to be feasibly created in lab, including antimatter systems. Most methods for the creation of antimatter (specifically antihydrogen) result in high-energy particles and atoms of high kinetic energy, which are unsuitable for gravity-related study. In recent years, first ALPHA and then ATRAP have trapped antihydrogen atoms at CERN; in 2012 ALPHA used such atoms to set the first free-fall loose bounds on the gravitational interaction of antimatter with matter, measured to within ¬±7500% of ordinary gravity, not enough for a clear scientific statement about the sign of gravity acting on antimatter. Future experiments need to be performed with higher precision, either with beams of antihydrogen (AEGIS) or with trapped antihydrogen (ALPHA or GBAR). In addition to uncertainty regarding whether antimatter is gravitationally attracted or repulsed from other matter, it is also unknown whether the magnitude of the gravitational force is the same. Difficulties in creating quantum gravity models have led to the idea that antimatter may react with a slightly different magnitude.  Theories of gravitational attraction  When antimatter was first discovered in 1932, physicists wondered about how it would react to gravity. Initial analysis focused on whether antimatter should react the same as matter or react oppositely. Several theoretical arguments arose which convinced physicists that antimatter would react exactly the same as normal matter. They inferred that a gravitational repulsion between matter and antimatter was implausible as it would violate CPT invariance, conservation of energy, result in vacuum instability, and result in CP violation. It was also theorized that it would be inconsistent with the results of the E√∂tv√∂s test of the weak equivalence principle. Many of these early theoretical objections were later overturned. Note: errata issued in 1992 in volume 216. = The equivalence principle = The equivalence principle predicts that the gravitational acceleration of antimatter is the same as that of ordinary matter. A matter- antimatter gravitational repulsion is thus excluded from this point of view. Furthermore, photons, which are their own antiparticles in the framework of the Standard Model, have in a large number of astronomical tests (gravitational redshift and gravitational lensing, for example) been observed to interact with the gravitational field of ordinary matter exactly as predicted by the general theory of relativity. This is a feature that has to be explained by any theory predicting that matter and antimatter repel. This is also the prediction Jean-Pierre Petit made in an article published in 2018: \\"In addition, the Janus model predicts that the antimatter that will be created in the laboratory in the Gbar experimenthttps://home.cern/fr/news/news/experiments/new-antimatter-gravity- experiments-begin-cern will behave like ordinary matter in the Earth's gravitational field.\\" The antigravitation described in the Janus model is produced by antimatter of 'negative' masses (the antimatter produced in laboratories or by cosmic rays has only positive masses), and is fully compliant with general relativity and Newtonian approximations. = CPT theorem = The CPT theorem implies that the difference between the properties of a matter particle and those of its antimatter counterpart is completely described by C-inversion. Since this C-inversion does not affect gravitational mass, the CPT theorem predicts that the gravitational mass of antimatter is the same as that of ordinary matter. A repulsive gravity is then excluded, since that would imply a difference in sign between the observable gravitational mass of matter and antimatter. = Morrison's argument = In 1958, Philip Morrison argued that antigravity would violate conservation of energy. If matter and antimatter responded oppositely to a gravitational field, then it would take no energy to change the height of a particle- antiparticle pair. However, when moving through a gravitational potential, the frequency and energy of light is shifted. Morrison argued that energy would be created by producing matter and antimatter at one height and then annihilating it higher up, since the photons used in production would have less energy than the photons yielded from annihilation. However, it was later found that antigravity would still not violate the second law of thermodynamics. = Schiff's argument = Later in 1958, L. Schiff used quantum field theory to argue that antigravity would be inconsistent with the results of the E√∂tv√∂s experiment. However, the renormalization technique used in Schiff's analysis is heavily criticized, and his work is seen as inconclusive. In 2014 the argument was redone by Marcoen Cabbolet, who concluded however that it merely demonstrates the incompatibility of the Standard Model and gravitational repulsion. = Good's argument = In 1961, Myron L. Good argued that antigravity would result in the observation of an unacceptably high amount of CP violation in the anomalous regeneration of kaons. At the time, CP violation had not yet been observed. However, Good's argument is criticized for being expressed in terms of absolute potentials. By rephrasing the argument in terms of relative potentials, Gabriel Chardin found that it resulted in an amount of kaon regeneration which agrees with observation. He argues that antigravity is in fact a potential explanation for CP violation based on his models on K mesons. His results date back to 1992. Since then however, studies on CP violation mechanisms in the B mesons systems have fundamentally invalidated these explanations. =Gerard 't Hooft's argument = According to Gerard 't Hooft, every physicist recognizes immediately what is wrong with the idea of gravitational repulsion: if a ball is thrown high up in the air so that it falls back, then its motion is symmetric under time-reversal; and therefore, the ball falls also down in opposite time-direction.G. 't Hooft, Spookrijders in de wetenschap (in Dutch), DUB (2014) Since a matter particle in opposite time-direction is an antiparticle, this proves according to 't Hooft that antimatter falls down on earth just like \\"normal\\" matter. However, Cabbolet replied that 't Hooft's argument is false, and only proves that an anti-ball falls down on an anti-earth - which is not disputed.M.J.T.F. Cabbolet, 't Hooft slaat plank mis over spookrijders (in Dutch), DUB (2014)  Theories of gravitational repulsion  As long as repulsive gravity has not been refuted experimentally, one can speculate about physical principles that would bring about such a repulsion. Thus far, three radically different theories have been published. =Kowitt's theory= The first theory of repulsive gravity was a quantum theory published by Mark Kowitt. In this modified Dirac theory, Kowitt postulated that the positron is not a hole in the sea of electrons-with- negative-energy as in usual Dirac hole theory, but instead is a hole in the sea of electrons-with-negative-energy-and-positive-gravitational-mass: this yields a modified C-inversion, by which the positron has positive energy but negative gravitational mass. Repulsive gravity is then described by adding extra terms (mgŒ¶g and mgAg) to the wave equation. The idea is that the wave function of a positron moving in the gravitational field of a matter particle evolves such that in time it becomes more probable to find the positron further away from the matter particle. =Santilli and Villata's theory= Classical theories of repulsive gravity have been published by Ruggero Santilli and Massimo Villata. Both theories are extensions of general relativity, and are experimentally indistinguishable. The general idea remains that gravity is the deflection of a continuous particle trajectory due to the curvature of spacetime, but antiparticles now 'live' in an inverted spacetime. The equation of motion for antiparticles is then obtained from the equation of motion of ordinary particles by applying the C, P, and T-operators (Villata) or by applying isodual maps (Santilli), which amounts to the same thing: the equation of motion for antiparticles then predicts a repulsion of matter and antimatter. It has to be taken that the observed trajectories of antiparticles are projections on our spacetime of the true trajectories in the inverted spacetime. However, it has been argued on methodological and ontological grounds that the area of application of Villata's theory cannot be extended to include the microcosmos. These objections were subsequently dismissed by Villata. =Cabbolet's theory= The first non-classical, non-quantum physical principles underlying a matter-antimatter gravitational repulsion have been published by Marcoen Cabbolet. He introduces the Elementary Process Theory, which uses a new language for physics, i.e. a new mathematical formalism and new physical concepts, and which is incompatible with both quantum mechanics and general relativity. The core idea is that nonzero rest mass particles such as electrons, protons, neutrons and their antimatter counterparts exhibit stepwise motion as they alternate between a particlelike state of rest and a wavelike state of motion. Gravitation then takes place in a wavelike state, and the theory allows, for example, that the wavelike states of protons and antiprotons interact differently with the earth's gravitational field. =Analysis= Further authors have used a matter-antimatter gravitational repulsion to explain cosmological observations, but these publications do not address the physical principles of gravitational repulsion.  Experiments  =Supernova 1987A= One source of experimental evidence in favor of normal gravity was the observation of neutrinos from Supernova 1987A. In 1987, three neutrino detectors around the world simultaneously observed a cascade of neutrinos emanating from a supernova in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Although the supernova happened about 164,000 light years away, both neutrinos and antineutrinos seem to have been detected virtually simultaneously. If both were actually observed, then any difference in the gravitational interaction would have to be very small. However, neutrino detectors cannot distinguish perfectly between neutrinos and antineutrinos. Some physicists conservatively estimate that there is less than a 10% chance that no regular neutrinos were observed at all. Others estimate even lower probabilities, some as low as 1%. Unfortunately, this accuracy is unlikely to be improved by duplicating the experiment any time soon. The last known supernova to occur at such a close range prior to Supernova 1987A was around 1867. =Fairbank's experiments= Physicist William Fairbank attempted a laboratory experiment to directly measure the gravitational acceleration of electrons, with hopes of attempting the same method for positrons. However, their charge-to-mass ratio is so large that electromagnetic effects overwhelmed attempts to measure the impact of gravity on electrons. Fairbank was never able to attempt the experiment with positrons. It is difficult to directly observe gravitational forces at the particle level. For charged particles, the electromagnetic force overwhelms the much weaker gravitational interaction. Even antiparticles in neutral antimatter, such as antihydrogen, must be kept separate from their counterparts in the matter that forms the experimental equipment, which requires strong electromagnetic fields. These fields, e.g. in the form of atomic traps, exert forces on these antiparticles which easily overwhelm the gravitational force of Earth and nearby test masses. Since all production methods for antiparticles result in high-energy antimatter particles, the necessary cooling for observation of gravitational effects in a laboratory environment requires very elaborate experimental techniques and very careful control of the trapping fields. =Cold neutral antihydrogen experiments= Since 2010 the production of cold antihydrogen has become possible at the Antiproton Decelerator at CERN. Antihydrogen, which is electrically neutral, should make it possible to directly measure the gravitational attraction of antimatter particles to the matter Earth. In 2013, experiments on antihydrogen atoms released from the ALPHA trap set direct, i.e. freefall, coarse limits on antimatter gravity. These limits were coarse, with a relative precision of ¬±100%, thus, far from a clear statement even for the sign of gravity acting on antimatter. Future experiments at CERN with beams of antihydrogen, such as AEgIS, or with trapped antihydrogen, such as ALPHA and GBAR, have to improve the sensitivity to make a clear, scientific statement about gravity on antimatter. Recent experiments with positronium in LHe https://www.laserfocusworld.com/lasers-sources/article/14073257/bubbles-of- positronium-in-liquid-helium-could-make-a-gammaray-laser-possible could be the first step in this line of research, in this case being able to stabilize antimatter may lead eventually to a way for its properties to be studied, specifically its properties in a gravitational field. It has been suggested that a material capable of holding a proton/antiproton pair in the same way might be more useful as protons are substantially more massive than electrons and any gravitational effects would be magnified by several orders of magnitude up to a point where detection is trivial using a cooled accelerometer or other quantum displacement sensor. Also an antimatter catalyzed fusion reactor would be massively simplified if positronium were produced and stored at a separate location though this would also cause problems with transport as positrons are typically produced \\"hot\\" at high relative velocities eg by collision of particles with gold foil. The antimatter reactor cited would be a variant of the Farnsworth-Hirsch fusor where positronium is accelerated into the core by potential well and electron diverted along a magnetic field line. https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2018/09/positron-catalyzed-fusion- propulsion.html See also *Fifth force *Dark energy *Dark matter References Category:Antimatter Category:Gravity Category:Anti-gravity ","title":"Gravitational interaction of antimatter"},{"id":"3404702","text":"Wagner model is a rheological model developed for the prediction of the viscoelastic properties of polymers.

During his reign, the Sumerian empire was attacked repeatedly by Amorites. As faith in Ibbi-Sin's leadership failed, Elam declared its independence and began to raid as well. Ibbi-Sin ordered fortifications built at the important cities of Ur and Nippur, but these efforts were not enough to stop the raids or keep the empire unified. Cities throughout Ibbi-Sin's empire fell away from a king who could not protect them, notably Isin under the Amorite ruler Ishbi-Erra. Ibbi-Sin was, by the end of his kingship, left with only the city of Ur. In 1940 BCE, the Elamites, along with \\"tribesmen from the region of Shimashki in the Zagros Mountains\\"Stiebing, p. 79 sacked Ur and took Ibbi-Sin captive; he was taken to the city of Elam where he was imprisoned and, at an unknown date, died. Amorite invasion The Amorites were considered a backward people by Mesopotamian standards; Ibbi-Sin's 17th year was officially named \\"Year the Amorites, the powerful south wind who, from the remote past, have not known cities, submitted to Ibbi-Sin the king of Ur.\\" However, despite his father Shu-Sin having built a \\"wall of Martu\\" across Mesopotamia against Amorite incursions, these were penetrated early in Ibbi-Sin's reign. Scholars have suggested that, by the reign of Ibbi-Sin, the empire was already in decline due to long-term drought ‚Äì in fact, the same drought that helped to take down the Akkadian Empire c. 2193 BCE may have been responsible for the fall of Ur III. > Studies of Persian Gulf sediments indicate that the stream flow of the > Tigris and Euphrates was very low around 2100‚Äì2000 BCE. [...] Any damage to > the agricultural system by enemy raids, bureaucratic mismanagement, or an > inattentive ruler would result in food shortages In years seven and eight of Ibbi-Sin's kingship, the price of grain increased to 60 times the norm, which means that the success of the Amorites in disrupting the Ur III empire is, at least in part, a product of attacks on the agricultural and irrigation systems. Invasion by Elam These attacks brought famine and caused an economic collapse in the empire, paving the way for the Elamites under Kindattu to strike into Ur and capture the king. The Lament for Sumer and Ur describe the fall of Ur and the fate of Ibbi-Sin: Year names All the year names of Ibbi-Sin are known, documenting the major events of his reign.

The current stadium was opened on June 23, 1967 to host the Saskatchewan Huskies football team. There was previously a Griffiths Stadium 200 metres to the east of the current location from October 3, 1936 until the new site was opened. In 2005, the University of Saskatchewan received a $5 million donation from PotashCorp to improve the facilities to meet the requirements of hosting the 2006 Vanier Cup. In recognition of this donation, the University of Saskatchewan renamed the fields surrounding the stadium Potash Corp Park. Improvements included Next Generation FieldTurf, expanded seating capacity (to 4,997), improved washroom facilities, and improved dressing room facilities. The 2006 Vanier Cup was a sellout of 12,567 fans, with temporary seating added for the event. The Saskatchewan Huskies football team of the Canada West Universities Athletic Association (CWUAA) of CIS are the only current resident of the facility. It has previously been used by soccer teams and the Saskatoon Hilltops of the CJFL. Griffiths Stadium also hosted the 2004 and 2005 Mitchell Bowl games, the 1998 and 1989 Churchill Bowls, as well as numerous Hardy Trophy games. On June 23, 2010, it was announced that the Graham Huskies Clubhouse, which was originally built in 2006 with a dressing room, meeting room and offices for the coaching staff, will be expanded with a new two-storey building to the east of the current clubhouse. Thanks to a $3 million donation from Ron and Jane Graham, who donated $1.2 million to construct the original clubhouse, and $160,000 from David Dub√© and Heather Ryan, who have funded many things Huskie Football (including the gameday fireworks, championship flags, inflatable mascots, and team jerseys), the Huskies will have a new building that will include a gym, multiple meeting rooms, coaches offices, and a rooftop viewing deck.Graham Huskies Clubhouse: What's Inside? The first-floor training center will be outfitted with six lifting stations, including an Olympic lifting platform, a lifting power cage, and dumbbell stations as well as a number of cardio areas. There will also be a narrow Field-Turf track, about 25 meters long, which will allow for some winter speed training and agility work. When players are working out, they will be using brand new equipment and have an incredible view of Griffiths Stadium through large windows. The second floor will be used for meetings. There is one small permanent meeting room and one large permanent meeting room. The large room will sit approximately 100 people. This room can be divided into three smaller meeting rooms, allowing the Huskies to meet as a team or in individual groups. Players and coaches will be able to watch game film together or on their own. There will be a mechanical and film center on the third floor and there are plans for a rooftop patio which can be used during Griffith Stadium events. With this addition comes a new work flow for the Huskies and their coaches. A new video scouting system has been purchased and the team will have 11 stations to view video (up from five this year). There will be new HD TVs, projectors, cameras and the same film software capabilities that NFL teams use. The clubhouse will get some new furniture and an upgraded sound system, among other details. Griffiths Stadium was expanded in August and September 2011, adding 1,174 seats. Funding for the new seats will be provided by University of Saskatchewan Alumni David Dube and his wife Heather Ryan. Ten rows of seats were added to the east side stands between the 30 yard lines. These seats are premium seats which are wider, have more leg room, featuring armrests and cup holders. These seats are modeled after stadium seats in NFL stadiums.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 18, 2005. Plot =The First D'oh-El= When Reverend Lovejoy cannot attend the Christmas sermon due to a horrible train wreck on his train set, Ned Flanders immediately takes over. However, when he gets a paper cut and faints, Homer decides to lead the sermon and tells the story of the first Christmas. Mary (Marge) tells Joseph (Homer) that she is pregnant, even though she is a virgin. The angel Gabriel (Lisa) appears to them and explains that Mary is going to give birth to the Son of God. The three wise men (Dr. Hibbert, Principal Skinner, and Professor Frink) tell King Herod (Mr. Burns) that they are going to give gold, frankincense, and myrrh (which Frink is re- gifting) to the King of the Jews. When Herod assumes the gifts are for him, the men explain to him that they are for the infant. Herod becomes angry and plots to kill the baby. At the Bethlehem Inn, the innkeeper (Moe) tells Mary and Joseph that he has plenty of rooms available with brand new carpeting. However, when Mary's water breaks, he forces them to stay in the barn. Mary successfully gives birth to baby Jesus (Bart), and the three wise men, along with the two shepherds (Lenny and Carl) come to see the baby. Joseph is upset because he is not Jesus's father, and when he drinks some wine, the baby turns it into water. When the infant keeps crying, Mary gives him to Joseph. He entertains him by hurting himself and one of the wise men (Skinner). When baby Jesus finally falls asleep, Herod and his troops find the manger that they are staying in. They escape and trick the soldiers by putting Jesus' halo on a duck. On top of the hill, Joseph cuts down a spruce tree, and as it rolls down, the soldiers get caught in it. The soldiers, along with Herod, are arranged like ornaments on the tree, and the duck, still wearing the halo, stands on top of the tree. Mary calls it a Christmas tree, and Homer concludes his service. =I Saw Grampa Cussing Santa Claus= When Bart and Lisa find Grampa trying to stick a bear trap on top of the chimney, Grampa tells them that he is trying to get his revenge on Santa Claus. When Bart asks why, Grampa recalls how, back in World War II, he and his brother Cyrus (not mentioned before or since this episode aired) were fighting off Japanese planes, accompanied by Mr. Burns, when Cyrus got shot down. Shortly after, Grampa and Burns have their plane's wings shot off and are stranded on an island. After a few months, they see a plane in the sky, and Burns shoots it down. However, when they go over to investigate, they see that it is actually Santa Claus. They build him a new sleigh and gather up all the presents. When Santa is about to leave, Burns knocks him unconscious with a coconut and flies away in the sleigh, intent on keeping all the presents for himself. Grampa catches up to him on Prancer, who has been left behind because Santa could not find him, and jumps on board the sleigh. After he beats Burns with a tricycle, he gives the sleigh back to Santa. As Santa leaves, he tells Grampa that he will be back in a few days. However, he never returns, and Grampa has to get off using a jet ski he made out of coconuts. Bart and Lisa believe that it is just another one of Grampa's far-fetched tales, but when they hear a thump in the den, they find that Santa is there. He tells them that Cyrus did not die, but instead crashed into Tahiti. Santa takes Grampa there, and they meet up with Cyrus and his fifteen wives. Santa explains to Grampa that he did not come back for him on the island due to his procrastination and eventually feeling embarrassed about it. When Abe comments on Cyrus's fifteen wives and the sex he must have, Cyrus points out that they are wives, not girlfriends. =The Nutcracker...Sweet= After the children of Springfield Elementary perform The Nutcracker, everyone begins to go about their business singing to the tune of the songs from the play. This is done after mentioning that these songs are in the public domain and thus can be (and are) played constantly for free. After the opening number (sung to the tune of \\"Marche\\"), Moe continues his holiday tradition of attempting suicide (done to the tune of \\"Dance of the Flutes\\"), first by hanging himself with popcorn string which breaks under his weight, next by riding a sleigh into open traffic only to have all the cars swerve and miss him, and then by shooting himself in the head with a revolver that sends a \\"Merry Christmas\\" flag out through his other ear. In a fourth attempt, Moe asks Barney to kill him instead of buying him a present, but Barney has already gotten him a wool hat and Moe gives up on the idea for now. That evening, Marge tells Homer that he will like the present that she got him. Having forgotten to buy her anything and not wanting to upset her, Homer tells her that his present for her is outside; he then frantically rushes out to find a gift (sung to the tune of \\"Trepak\\"). Every store is closed, and all Apu has at the Kwik-E-Mart is some jerky made out of trout. Homer searches in garbage cans, gutters, trees, and he even chases down Milhouse, but he cannot find anything. When he gets home, Marge gives Homer his present (done to \\"Pas De Deux\\"). He opens it and sees that it is another present with a tag that reads, \\"To Marge, From Homer.\\" Marge tells him that she knew that he would forget to give her a present, so she gave him one to give to her. He gives it to her and she unwraps it, and Homer sees that it is a picture of him dressed up as Santa with Marge on his lap. They hug and kiss, and Moe unsuccessfully attempts suicide a fifth time by riding a sleigh toward a fully loaded tractor-trailer.  Reception  Don Payne was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Writing in Animation at the 59th Writers Guild of America Awards for his script to this episode.

Life and career Caddell with Jimmy Carter in November 1977 Caddell was born in Rock Hill, South Carolina and graduated from Harvard University. He worked for Democratic presidential candidates George McGovern in 1972, Jimmy Carter in 1976 and 1980, Gary Hart in 1984, Joe Biden in 1988, and Jerry Brown in 1992. He also worked for Colorado Senate candidate Andrew Romanoff in 2010. Caddell persuaded Carter to focus in 1976 on the \\"trust factor\\", rather than divisive political issues in the 1976 campaign, a strategy which led, narrowly, to victory. The Arkansas political scientist and pollster Jim Ranchino declared the then 26-year-old Caddell \\"the best pollster in the business.\\"The Blytheville, Arkansas, Courier News, June 11, 1976, p. 3 According to researchers, Caddell had wide influence in the Carter White House, and was the chief advocate of what later became known as Carter's \\"malaise speech\\".Heath, Diane J.: \\"Staffing the White House public opinion apparatus\\", \\"Public Opinion Quarterly, Smith, R: \\"Size of the Moon\\", 62:2 (1998) Caddell served as a consultant to various movies and television shows, most notably the movies Running Mates, Air Force One, Outbreak, In the Line of Fire, and the serial drama The West Wing. He was also a marketing consultant on Coca-Cola's disastrous New Coke campaign. Alt URL In 1988, Caddell left Democratic consulting firm Caddell, Doak and Shrum after what The Washington Post described as an \\"acrimonious lawsuit\\". Republicans would often cite Caddell's tirades against the Democratic Party when they spoke on the floor of the House and the Senate. Alt URL Caddell's analysis on polls and campaign issues often put him at odds with the leadership of the Democratic Party. He was criticized by Media Matters for America and Salon columnist Steve Kornacki for predicting negative consequences for the Democratic Party. He called environmentalism \\"a conspiracy 'to basically deconstruct capitalism.'\\" Caddell was a regular guest on Fox News, and at the time of his death was listed as an official \\"Fox News Contributor\\". This earned him the label of a \\"Fox News Democrat\\" by critics such as liberal online opinion magazine Salon. He also frequently appeared on the conservative Web site Ricochet.com, discussing politics. According to online magazine Slate, Caddell was involved in identifying people willing to participate in the 2012 anti-Obama documentary The Hope and the Change, produced by Steve Bannon and Citizens United. In the 2016 election cycle, Caddell exerted considerable influence in his capacity as advisor to Republican contributor Robert Mercer, who was a major fundraiser for the successful candidacy of Donald Trump.

Early years Wallace was born in Bury and educated at Bury Grammar School. He formed his first band, The Jaguars, at school, before going on to join The Warriors with Jon Anderson in his pre-Yes days. (Wallace later played with Yes once in November 1968 during Bill Bruford's hiatus from the band). From The Warriors, Wallace went on to join Big Sound. In the 1960s, Big Sound worked in Denmark, Norway and Sweden as a backing band of Danish rock musician Nalle. The Big Sound and The Warriors had been mates, and had gigged together in the Storyville Club, Frankfurt, Cologne and Copenhagen. The Big Sound's drummer and bass player left, after which Ian and The Warriors bass player, Dave Foster, joined the band. When the Big Sound split at the end of 1967 during a tour of Norway, some members, including Wallace, moved to London to back other artists such as Sandie Shaw, David Garrick, Marv Johnson and Lou Christie. Prime years Wallace later joined Vivian Stanshall's BiG GrunT, and then The World with Neil Innes before King Crimson. He appeared on the album Islands in 1971, and on the live album Earthbound in 1972, as well as a number of later archival releases. In May 1972, at the end of a U.S. tour, he and fellow Crimson members Mel Collins and Boz Burrell left the band and went to work for Alexis Korner's Snape. Wallace subsequently worked with Steve Marriott's All-Stars and was invited to join Bob Dylan's band in 1978 and accompanied Dylan during his tour of Japan. Wallace's heavy drum style was the driving force behind the pop-heavy album Street-Legal. He toured again with Dylan in the early 1990s. In 1977 he also worked briefly with Foreigner subbing some dates after their regular drummer, Dennis Elliott, injured his hand. Other notable work includes Ry Cooder in 1979 and Don Henley in the 1980s and 1990s. Wallace's studio and live credits also include El Rayo-X with David Lindley, Bonnie Raitt, Joe Walsh, Bob Dylan, Johnny Hallyday, Keith Emerson, Roy Orbison, Jackson Browne, the Traveling Wilburys, Eric Clapton, Jon Anderson, Alvin Lee, Crosby, Stills and Nash, the Quireboys, Brian Eno, Larry Coryell, Stevie Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham, Steve Marriott, Al Kooper, Tim Buckley, Lonnie Mack, Procol Harum (1993 tour), and Warren Zevon. Later years and death Following a move to Nashville, Tennessee in 1998, Wallace worked as a producer and player. Among his later studio recordings there were sessions with Kim Richey, Tim Krekel, Rick Vito, Dean Dillon, Rosie Flores, Jessi Alexander, producer Gary Nicholson, Steve Ripley, Jan Pulsford, Tim Hinkley, Charlie Taylor, Rodney Crowell and the legendary songwriter Dan Penn. He also performed live with T. Graham Brown, the Nashville Chamber Orchestra, Rick Vito, Jessi Alexander, and Billy Burnette, the latter in a quartet that included bassist Dave Roe (Johnny Cash) and Kenny Vaughan (Lucinda Williams). In 2003, he joined the 21st Century Schizoid Band, and released his only solo album, Happiness With Minimal Side Effects. In 2005 he formed the Crimson Jazz Trio with Tim Landers on bass and Jody Nardone on piano, which released King Crimson Songbook Volume One in November 2005 and King Crimson Songbook Volume Two in early 2009. On 10 August 2006, Wallace was diagnosed with esophageal cancer. He chronicled his illness in his online blog in the hope his story would encourage others with similar symptoms to pursue treatment. He died, aged 60, with his wife, Marjorie Pomeroy, at his side.Crimson Jazz Trio Selective discography =The Warriors= Single : *1964: You came along/Don't make me blue - Decca Records Albums : 2003: The Warriors : Bolton Club 1965 - VoicePrint 2003: The Warriors '65 =The World= *1970: The World ‚Äì Lucky Planet =King Crimson= *1971: Islands *1972: Earthbound *1998: Live at Jacksonville, 1972 *2000: Live at Summit Studios: Denver, 03/12/1972 *2001: Live in Detroit 1971 *2002: Ladies of the Road *2003: Live in Orlando, 1972 *2017: Sailors' Tales 1970-1972, 27-disc boxed set =Snape= *1973: Accidentally Born in New Orleans *1974: Snape Live on Tour in Germany =David Lindley and El Rayo-X= *1981: El Rayo-X *1982: Win This Record *1983: El Rayo Live *1985: Mr Dave =Johnny Hallyday= *1995: Lorada *1996: Destination Vegas *1996: Lorada Tour *2003: √Ä La Cigale *2003: Live at the Aladdin Theatre =The Wallace/Trainor Conspiracy= *1998: Take A Train =Crimson Jazz Trio= *2005: King Crimson Songbook, Volume One *2009: King Crimson Songbook, Volume Two =21st Century Schizoid Band= *2006: Pictures of a City: Live in New York =Solo= *2003: Happiness With Minimal Side Effects =Collaborations= *1972: Billy Burnette ‚Äì Billy Burnette *1973: Jackson Heights ‚Äì Bump & Grind *1973: Alvin Lee & Mylon LeFevre ‚Äì On the Road to Freedom *1973: Esther Phillips ‚Äì Black-Eyed Blues *1974: Alexis Korner ‚Äì Alexis Korner *1974: Big Jim Sullivan ‚Äì Big Jims Back *1974: Alvin Lee ‚Äì In Flight *1975: Alvin Lee ‚Äì Pump Iron! *1975: Labi Siffre - Remember My Song *1976: Steve Marriott ‚Äì Marriott *1978: Bob Dylan ‚Äì Street-Legal *1979: Bob Dylan ‚Äì Bob Dylan At Budokan *1981: Ronnie Wood ‚Äì 1234 *1982: Don Henley ‚Äì I Can't Stand Still *1983: Jon Anderson ‚Äì Animation *1983: Stevie Nicks ‚Äì The Wild Heart *1984: Don Henley ‚Äì Building the Perfect Beast *1986: Graham Nash ‚Äì Innocent Eyes *1986: Jackson Browne ‚Äì Lives in the Balance *1986: Bonnie Raitt ‚Äì Nine Lives *1988: Traveling Wilburys ‚Äì Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 *1989: Roy Orbison ‚Äì Mystery Girl *1990: London Quireboys ‚Äì Little Bit of What You Fancy *1991: Jump in the Water - Jump in the Water *1995: Alvin Lee & Ten Years After ‚Äì Pure Blues *1995: Joe Walsh ‚Äì A Future to This Life: Robocop - The Series Soundtrack *1997: Humble Pie - The Scrubbers Sessions *2000: Billy Burnette ‚Äì Are You With Me Baby *2000: Alvin Lee & Ten Years After ‚Äì Solid Rock *2001: Rodney Crowell ‚Äì The Houston Kid *2003: Bob Dylan ‚Äì Street-Legal [Remastered] *2005: Fission Trip ‚Äì Fission Trip, Volume One *2005: Adrian Belew ‚Äì Side One *2006: Skye Edwards - Mind How You Go *2007: Traveling Wilburys ‚Äì Traveling Wilburys *2007: Steve Marriott's All Stars ‚Äì Wham Bam References External links * Exclusive interview with Ian Wallace * Crimson Jazz Trio official website Category:1946 births Category:2007 deaths Category:English rock drummers Category:King Crimson members Category:People from Bury, Greater Manchester Category:Music in the Metropolitan Borough of Bury Category:Musicians from Manchester Category:Deaths from esophageal cancer Category:Deaths from cancer in California Category:Procol Harum members Category:English session musicians Category:People educated at Bury Grammar School Category:Progressive rock drummers Category:Streetwalkers members ","title":"Ian Wallace (drummer)"},{"id":"3404866","text":"Constructivist teaching is based on constructivist learning theory. Constructivist teaching is based on the belief that learning occurs as learners are actively involved in a process of meaning and knowledge construction as opposed to passively receiving information. History Constructivist approach teaching methods are based on constructivist learning theory. Scholars such as Ernst von Glasersfeld trace the origin of this approach to the philosophies of Immanuel Kant, George Berkeley, and Jean Piaget. There are those who also cite the contribution of John Dewey such as his works on action research, which allows the construction of complex understanding of teaching and learning. Dewey and Piaget researched childhood development and education; both were very influential in the development of informal education. Dewey's idea of influential education suggests that education must engage with and enlarge exploration of thinking and reflection associated with the role of educators. Contrary to this, Piaget argued that we learn by expanding our knowledge by experiences which are generated through play from infancy to adulthood which are necessary for learning. Both theories are now encompassed by the broader movement of progressive education. Constructivist learning theory states that all knowledge is constructed from a base of prior knowledge. As such, children are not to be treated as a blank slate, and make sense of classroom material in the context of his or her current knowledge.Constructivism as a Paradigm for Teaching and Learning The development of constructivist models of teaching are specifically attributed to the works of Maria Montessori, which were further developed by more recent by theorists such as David A. Kolb ,and Ronald Fry, among others. These theorists have proposed sensory and activity-based learning methods. It was Kolb and Fry who were able to develop a methodology for experiential learning that involves concrete experience, observation and reflection, forming abstract concepts, and testing in new situations. Activities The constructivist method is composed of at least five stages: inviting ideas, exploration, proposition, explanation and solution, and taking action. The constructivist classroom also focuses on daily activities when it comes to student work. Teaching methods also emphasize communication and social skills, as well as intellectual collaboration. This is different from a traditional classroom where students primarily work alone, learning through repetition and lecture. Activities encouraged in constructivist classrooms include: * Experimentation: Students individually perform an experiment and then come together as a class to discuss the results. * Research projects: Students research a topic and can present their findings to the class. * Field trips: This allows students to put the concepts and ideas discussed in class in a real-world context. Field trips would often be followed by class discussions. * Films: These provide visual context and thus bring another sense into the learning experience. * Class discussions: This technique is used in all of the methods described above. It is one of the most important distinctions of constructivist teaching methods.Strategies for Constructivist Teaching * Campus wikis: These provide learners with a platform for curating helpful learning resources. Constructivist approaches can also be used in online learning. Tools such as discussion forums, wikis and blogs can enable learners to actively construct knowledge. Because existing knowledge schemata are explicitly acknowledged as a starting point for new learning, constructivist approaches tend to validate individual and cultural differences and diversity. Assessment Traditional testing is only one facet of constructivist assessment of student success. Assessment also consists of personal, thorough interpretation of students' performance in the context of what their out-of- school life. Non-traditional constructivist assessment strategies include: *Oral discussions. The teacher presents students with a \\"focus\\" question and allows an open discussion on the topic. *KWL(H) Chart (What we know, What we want to know, What we have learned, How we know it). This technique can be used throughout the course of study for a particular topic, but is also a good assessment technique as it shows the teacher the progress of the student throughout the course of study. *Mind Mapping. In this activity, students list and categorize the concepts and ideas relating to a topic. *Hands-on activities. These encourage students to manipulate their environments or a particular learning tool. Teachers can use a checklist and observation to assess student success with the particular material. *Pre-testing. This allows a teacher to determine what knowledge students bring to a new topic and thus will be helpful in directing the course of study. Arguments against constructivist teaching techniques Critics have voiced the following arguments against constructivist based teaching instruction: * A group of cognitive scientists has also questioned the central claims of constructivism, saying that they are either misleading or contradict known findings.Applications and Misapplications of Cognitive Psychology to Mathematics Education * One possible deterrent for this teaching method is that, due to the emphasis on group work, the ideas of the more active students may dominate the group's conclusions. While proponents of constructivism argue that constructivist students perform better than their peers when tested on higher-order reasoning, the critics of constructivism argue that this teaching technique forces students to \\"reinvent the wheel\\". Supporters counter that \\"Students do not reinvent the wheel but, rather, attempt to understand how it turns, how it functions.\\" Proponents argue that students--especially elementary school-aged children--are naturally curious about the world, and giving them the tools to explore it in a guided manner will serve to give them a stronger understanding of it. Mayer (2004) Should There Be a Three-Strikes Rule Against Pure Discovery Learning? , Mayer, 2004, American Psychologist, 59(1), 14‚Äì19 developed a literature review spanning fifty years and concluded \\"The research in this brief review shows that the formula constructivism = hands-on activity is a formula for educational disaster.\\" His argument is that active learning is often suggested by those subscribing to this philosophy. In developing this instruction these educators produce materials that require learning to be behaviorally active and not be \\"cognitively active\\". That is, although they are engaged in activity, they may not be learning (Sweller, 1988). Mayer recommends using guided discovery, a mix of direct instruction and hands-on activity, rather than pure discovery: \\"In many ways, guided discovery appears to offer the best method for promoting constructivist learning.\\" Kirchner et al. (2006) agree with the basic premise of constructivism, that learners construct knowledge, but are concerned with the instructional design recommendations of this theoretical framework. \\"The constructivist description of learning is accurate, but the instructional consequences suggested by constructivists do not necessarily follow.\\" (Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark, 2006, p. 78). Specifically, they say instructors often design unguided instruction that relies on the learner to \\"discover or construct essential information for themselves\\" (Kirchner et al., 2006, p75). For this reason they state that it \\"is easy to agree with Mayer's (2004) recommendation that we \\"move educational reform efforts from the fuzzy and nonproductive world of ideology‚Äîwhich sometimes hides under the various banners of constructivism‚Äîto the sharp and productive world of theory-based research on how people learn\\" (p. 18). Finally Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark (2006) cite Mayer to conclude fifty years of empirical results do not support unguided instruction. Specific approaches Specific approaches to education that are based on constructivism include the following: = Constructionism = An approach to learning based on the constructivist learning ideologies presented by Jean Piaget (Harel & Papert, 1991). In this approach, the individual is consciously engaged in the construction of a product (Li, Cheng, & Liu, 2013). The utilization of constructionism in educational settings has been shown to promote higher-order thinking skills such as problem-solving and critical thinking (Li et al., 2013). = Guided instruction = A learning approach in which the educator uses strategically placed prompts, cues, questions, direct explanations, and modeling to guide student thinking and facilitate an increased responsibility for the completion of a task (Fisher & Frey, 2010). = Problem-based learning = A structured educational approach which consists of large and small group discussions (Schmidt & Loyens, 2007). Problem-based learning begins with an educator presenting a series of carefully constructed problems or issues to small groups of students (Schmidt & Loyens, 2007). The problems or issues typically pertain to phenomena or events to which students possess limited prior knowledge (Schmidt & Loyens, 2007). The first component of problem-based learning is to discuss prior knowledge and ask questions related to the specific problems or issues (Schmidt & Loyens, 2007). Following the class discussion, there is typically time in which students individually research or reflect on the newly acquired information and/or seek out areas requiring further exploration (Schmidt & Loyens, 2007). After a pre-determined amount of time (as outlined by the educator), students will meet in the same small groups that were composed prior to the class discussion (Schmidt & Loyens, 2007). In the first meeting, groups will spend between one and three hours further discussing the problems or issues from class in addition to presenting any new information collected during individual research (Schmidt & Loyens, 2007). Following the first meeting, students will independently reflect on the group discussion, specifically in comparing thoughts regarding the problems or issues in question (Schmidt & Loyens, 2007). Typically, groups will meet a second time to critically analyse individual and group thoughts and discussions and will attempt to synthesize the information in order to draw conclusions about the given problem or issue (Schmidt & Loyens, 2007). Within the educational setting, problem-based learning has enabled students to actively construct individual understandings of a topic using both prior and newly acquired knowledge (Schmidt & Loyens, 2007). Moreover, students also develop self- directed and group learning skills which ultimately facilitates the comprehension of the problems or issues (Schmidt & Loyens, 2007).  Inquiry-based learning  An educational approach associated with problem- based learning in which the student learns through investigating issues or scenarios (Hakverdi-Can & Sonmez, 2012). In this approach, students pose and answer questions individually and/or collaboratively in order to draw conclusions regarding the specific issues or scenarios (Hakverdi-Can & Sonmez, 2012). Within the educational setting, inquiry-based learning has been beneficial in developing student inquiry, investigation, and collaboration skills, in turn, increasing overall comprehension of the issue or scenario (Hakverdi-Can & Sonmez, 2012). Effective essential questions include student thought and research, connect to student's reality and can be solved in different ways (Crane, 2009). There are no incorrect answers to essential questions, rather answers reveal student understanding(Crane, 2009).  Anchored instruction  An educational approach associated with problem- based learning in which the educator introduces an 'anchor' or theme in which students will be able to explore (Kariuki & Duran, 2004). The 'anchor' acts as a focal point for the entire task, allowing students to identify, define, and explore problems while exploring the topic from a variety of different perspectives (Kariuki & Duran, 2004). = Cooperative learning = A variety of educational approaches focusing on individuals working together to achieve a specific learning outcome (Hsiung, 2012).  Reciprocal Peer Teaching  A cooperative learning approach wherein students alternate roles as teacher and learner (Krych, March, Bryan, Peake, Wojciech, & Carmichael, 2005). The utilization of Reciprocal Peer Teaching (RPT) in educational settings has been effective in the development of teamwork, leadership, and communication skills in addition to improving students' understanding of course content (Krych et al., 2005).  Jigsaw  A highly structured cooperative learning approach which is implemented in four stages: introduction, focused exploration, reporting and re-shaping, and integration and evaluation. In the introduction stage, the class is divided into heterogeneous 'home' groups consisting of between three and seven students (Karacop & Doymus, 2013). Upon establishing the 'home' groups, the teacher will discuss the subtopics pertaining to the subject matter (Karacop & Doymus, 2013). In the focused exploration stage, each student within all 'home' groups selects one of the subtopics (Karacop & Doymus, 2013). Students from each 'home' group that have selected the same subtopic will form a 'jigsaw' group (Karacop & Doymus, 2013). It is in the 'jigsaw' group that students will explore the material pertaining to the subtopic and will prepare for teaching it to their 'home' group, the reporting and re-shaping stage (Karacop & Doymus, 2013). The approach concludes in the fourth stage, integration and evaluation, wherein each of the 'home' groups combine the learning of each subtopic together to create the completed piece of work (Karacop & Doymus, 2013).

Its 15 research institutions (including the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul) work to facilitate not only individual research but also cooperative partnership activities with academia, industry, and government. The university also has 65 sister universities in 19 different countries. The university specializes in globalization and localization under the university's motto of 'truth, freedom, and creation'. History Founded in 1946 as Kookmin College in Seoul, the tumultuous Korean War years created a situation in which it was more advantageous to move south than to stay in the Seoul area. In 1952 Kookmin College was rechristened Haein College and then in 1956 the college relocated to Korea's southern coast and has been in the city of Masan since that time. In 1961 the institution was renamed Masan College. In 1970, the Hanma foundation took over the college and in 1971 decided to rename the college again, so the signs were changed to read ‚ÄúKyungnam College.‚Äù In 1982 the institution attained university status and the name was officially changed to ‚ÄúKyungnam University.‚Äù Notable alumni * Ahn Se-ha, actor Faculty, staff, students Kyungnam University maintains a teaching staff of over 900 professors, lecturers, adjuncts, and instructors.

The line from Lilydale to Warburton was slightly over long. The last train ran on Sunday, 1 August 1965, although the official closure was on 29 July 1965.  Services  Throughout its life the Warburton line had both passenger and goods services (passenger services generally running as a shuttle between Lilydale and Warburton stations), although passenger services dwindled during the later years.  Current status  Although the track was dismantled in the 1970s, the Warburton line right-of-way is intact, except for a short section leased to Mount Lilydale Mercy College. All the bridges are still in place, except the one that previously crossed the Maroondah Highway. A new bridge, allowing the highway to be safely crossed by cyclists and pedestrians, was completed in 2011.

Biography =Early career= Peter began his career in 1960 with the band Johnny King and The Raiders, composed of the late Johnny King on vocals, Graham (Wes) Douglas and Roger Collins on guitar, Peter on bass and his brother Michael on drums. There is no record of any recording anywhere, single or album. This training lasted at least a year then the Giles brothers left to join the group Dave Anthony and the Rebels, besides the singer Dave Anthony (real name Anthony Head) it also included the pianist and guitarist Al Kirtley, Peter on bass and Michael on drums. In those years, bands formed and separated quickly, Peter and Michael found themselves playing with The Dowlands from 1961 to 1963, during that time they produced 8 singles which are found on a compilation album released in 1998 entitled All My Loving. They are also called The Dowland Brothers & the Soundtracks and are made up of singer Alan Barry (civil name Bowery), brothers David and Gordon Dowland on guitar, Gordon Haskell on vocals and guitar (who would sing later with King Crimson on the albums In the Wake of Poseidon and Lizard) and of course Peter Giles on bass and Michael on drums. Following which, the Giles brothers played with two rather obscure bands, The Sands and The Interns during the year 1963, and then formed Trendsetters Limited with which they had recorded 4 singles, during their stay with this band which changed its name to The Trend. They were Geoff Robinson on guitar, Al Kirtley on piano, Peter on bass, Michael Blakesley on trombone and Michael on drums. In 1966, when the band split up, Peter and his brother then opted for another band called The Brain, which released two singles in 1967. = From Giles, Giles and Fripp to King Crimson = In that same year, 1967, the brothers published an ad in a newspaper looking for a keyboardist who sings, to form a new band, except that it is a guitarist who did not sing who introduced himself, Robert Fripp. They formed the trio Giles, Giles & Fripp, and produced a single album The Cheerful Insanity of Giles, Giles and Fripp. Demo recordings from the same time were later released as The Brondesbury Tapes with multi-instrumentalist Ian McDonald and singer Judy Dyble (ex ‚Äì Fairport Convention). Following the departure of Peter Giles to other avenues and Judy Dyble to form the Trader Horn duo with keyboardist and singer Jackie McAuley, formerly of the group Them, Michael Giles and Fripp recruited guitarist-bassist-singer of Dorset Greg Lake and the songwriter Peter Sinfield, so King Crimson was born, who produced their first album \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" in 1969. After a tour in America, Ian McDonald and Michael Giles were disillusioned and left the band to record an album, McDonald and Giles , released in 1971, on which Peter Giles plays bass. Subsequently, Fripp reformed a new version of King Crimson with Gordon Haskell singing on one song \\"Cadence and Cascade\\" and Greg Lake singing for the other songs of the album \\"In The Wake Of Poseidon\\". Michael Giles is also present on drums to help Fripp with Peter on bass. Other musicians are Mel Collins on saxophone and flute and Keith Tippett on piano. = 21st Century Schizoid Band = Subsequently Peter Giles appeared on Todd Dillingham's album \\"Vast Empty Spaces\\" in 1994 with Mike Wedgwood, Andy Ward and Anthony Aldridge. He returned to music in 2002 with the group 21st Century Schizoid Band who produced 4 albums with former Crimson musicians, Ian McDonald, Mel Collins on saxophones and keyboards and Michael Giles on drums. He will be replaced in 2003 by another former Crimson, Ian Wallace. In 2009, the compilation album The Giles Brothers 1962 ‚Äì 1967, on which are found the majority of the singles engraved by the bands with which they played during these years. One of the songs of the band The Brain, One in a Million was covered by Giles, Giles & Fripp on their 1968 album. As of 2009, Giles was producing an album of original material with his wife Yasmine, under the banner of Aluna. This was slated for worldwide release later that year.

History The Coker Community was founded in 1841 by John Coker (1789‚Äì1851) on of land he had been awarded for his service in the Texas revolutionary war. James Harrison Coker (1827‚Äì1892), son of Joseph Coker, John Coker's brother, was the first teacher at the Coker School, and his daughter Sarah Jane Coker (1860‚Äì1930) was the midwife there. Sarah Jane was married to Zachary Taylor Autry who was a Texas Ranger and early settler of Northern Bexar County, Texas. In the 1880s a Methodist circuit rider named Arthur Everett Rector visited the community about once a month; services lasted all day while horses, wagons, and oxen were tethered nearby. Mr. Rector once performed a wedding at the church and was paid $5 and a pig. The first wooden built church was constructed there in 1885. The people of the community made their living by farming. The present day rock church was constructed by the community members in 1937. A family member can be found under the name of Andie Coker, currently residing in Round Rock, Texas.

He is one of the earliest Stick, NS/Stick, and bowed guitar players. He helped popularize the NS/Stick and a technique of using a carabiner as a slide and tapping device. A native of Wilmington, Delaware, Schiff moved to Las Vegas, Nevada immediately after high school in 1974. At age 19 he quickly developed a reputation and within five months got his first break when hired to be the 'house bassist' for the Flamingo Las Vegas and Hilton Hotel Showrooms. There, he played for such artists as Elvis Presley, Tina Turner, Peggy Lee, Sammy Davis, Jr., Ann-Margret, Perry Como, and The 5th Dimension, as well as others. Schiff purchased his first Chapman Stick in 1975 and quickly adapted to it, creating his own style of playing. Gradually, around the time he was making the move to Los Angeles in 1977, he began using it during live dates and recording sessions for various artists including Eddie Money, Lana Lane, Dwight Yoakam, Erik Norlander and Sheryl Crow. He met screenwriter and director Patrick Sean Duncan who hired him to score the films Live From Death Row and Family Values. He can be seen briefly in both of those films since Pat Duncan cast him in films he directed, placing him in odd scenes. In 2000, Emmett Chapman and Ned Steinberger developed the first prototype NS/Stick. Schiff was given one of the first two prototypes to try out. He developed many new techniques on it including \\"tapping while plucking\\" and \\"slide technique\\" using a carabiner while tapping. The song \\"Cerebral Man\\", which he wrote along with Tully Winfield, was recorded by Pat Benatar on her album entitled Wide Awake in Dreamland for which he received a gold album in 1988. The song \\"With Every Word\\" recorded by Nia Peeples on her self-titled album was also written by Schiff and Winfield. Schiff currently plays NS/Stick in the band Rocket Scientists.

The community was originally called \\"Bethesda\\" but was later called \\"Concrete\\" because of the old rock church built in 1852 that once stood on the site and was also used as a school and meeting hall for the Bethesda Masonic lodge. The New Berlin road ran past the old rock church, and on Sundays the road was lined with ox carts carrying both whites and blacks to the church. The church was the site of many old-fashioned camp meetings with both whites and blacks attending. The community was founded by James Henry Newton, who owned a plantation on the north bank of Cibolo Creek. The lumber as well as other supplies to construct the buildings were hauled by slaves with ox teams from Port Lavaca. Lumber was so scarce that the homes of the first settlers were built of logs and the floors were made of flat stones. The land for the Concrete Cemetery which is all that presently remains on the site was donated as a public cemetery by James Newton in 1856, and the first recorded burial was of his brother Joel Wooton Newton on January 16, 1856. Concrete Cemetery is also the burial site of Claiborne Rector, who fought in the Texas Revolution. In the early 1860s, the growth of nearby La Vernia and New Berlin led to a decline in population. After the old rock church was damaged in a hurricane, it was decided to rebuild in nearby La Vernia where it still stands and is known as the Brahan lodge site of the oldest Masonic lodge in Texas.

In those cases it nearly always refers to a certain, often quite distant, ancestor's place of origin or residence; for example, Ludwig van Beethoven \\"from Bettenhoven\\" and Rembrandt van Rijn \\"from the Rhine\\". Van is also a preposition in the Dutch and Afrikaans languages, meaning \\"of\\" or \\"from\\" depending on the context (similar to de and di in the Romance languages). Van also exists as a surname in its own right, but as such it's very rare. In surnames, it can appear by itself or in combination with an article (compare French de la, de l'). The most common cases of this are van de, van der and van den, where the articles are all current or archaic forms of the article de \\"the\\". Less common are van het and van 't, which use the similar but grammatically neuter article het. The contraction ver-, based on van der, is also common and can be written as a single word with the rest of the surname; an example being Johannes Vermeer (van der meer \\"of the lake\\").  Related prepositions  The preposition \\"van\\" is the most widely used preposition in Dutch surnames, but many others are also used, although not always recognized as such if the whole surname is written as a single word. Just as \\"van\\" all these prepositions used to indicate geographical locations: * te -- meaning \\"at\\" (or/of towards), (or ter and ten, being the old dative forms), e.g., ter Beek (of the stream) * thoe/thor -- being the old forms of te as in Thorbecke (meaning at the brook) * aan -- meaning \\"at\\" or \\"aside\\" (also in combination aan de, aan den, aan het, aan 't), e.g., aan de Stegge (meaning aside the road) * op -- meaning \\"on\\" (also in combination op de, op der, op den, op ten, op 't, op het), e.g., as in Op den Akker (on the field) * in -- meaning \\"in\\" (also in combination in de, in den, in der, in het, in 't), in 't Veld (in the field) * bij -- meaning \\"at\\" (exclusively in combination bij de, bij 't): Bij 't Vuur (at the fire) * uit -- or archaic uyt (uijt), meaning \\"out\\" or \\"from\\" (also in combination uit de, uit den, uit het, uyt de, uyt den, uijt de, uijt den, uijt ten), e.g. Uytdehaage (from The Hague or from the hedge). * over -- meaning \\"over\\" or \\"from the other side\\" (also in combination over de), as in Overeem (from the other side of the river Eem) * onder -- meaning \\"under\\" or \\"below\\" or \\"at the bottom\\" (also in combination onder de), Onderdijk, Onderwater * achter -- meaning \\"behind\\" (also in combination achter de) Achterberg (behind the mountain) * bezuiden -- meaning \\"south of\\": Bezuidenhout (south of the woods) * boven -- meaning \\"above\\" or \\"up\\": Bovelander (up in the land) * buiten -- meaning \\"outside\\" or \\"in the country\\": Buitenhuis (outside the house) * voor -- meaning \\"in front of\\", (also in combination voor de, voor den, voor 't, voor in 't) * zonder -- meaning \\"without\\": Zonderland (without land) or Zondervan (without van, e.g. without a surname beginning with van) Apart from these prepositions the prefix \\"de\\" (not a preposition but an article, meaning \\"the\\") is also very common. They indicate a property, quality or origin, as in \\"de Lange\\" (the tall one), \\"de Korte\\" (the short one), \\"de Kleine\\" (the little one), \\"de Groot\\" (the big one), \\"de Zwart\\", \\"de Wit\\", \\"de Rode\\" (the one with black, white, red hair or skin), \\"de Rijke\\" (the rich one).

For Dutch people of French (usually Huguenot) origin whose ancestors never modified their surnames to fit Dutch norms, the prefix \\"de\\" is a preposition similar in meaning to \\"van\\".  Spelling conventions  = Collation and capitalisation = Collation and capitalisation of names differs between countries: *In the Netherlands and Suriname, names starting with \\"van\\" are filed under the initial letter of the following name proper, so Johannes van der Waals is filed under \\"W\\", as: \\"Waals, Johannes van der\\" or \\"van der Waals, Johannes\\".taaladvies.net The \\"v\\" is written in lower case, except when the surname is used as standalone (when the first name or initials are omitted), in which case it is capitalised, as in \\"de schilder Van Gogh (\\"the painter Van Gogh\\").woordenlijst.org, line 16.B In compound terms like \\"de Van Goghtentoonstelling (\\"the Van Gogh exhibition\\") the \\"v\\" is capitalised, unless the connection between the person and the concept is or has become very weak.woordenlijst.org, line 16.D *In Belgium, any surnames beginning with \\"Van\\" or \\"van\\" are filed under \\"V\\". So for example Eric Van Rompuy is listed under the \\"V\\" section, not under the \\"R\\". The lowercase spelling in a name from the Netherlands is respected but not necessarily differentiated in alphabetical ordering and its Dutch style capitalization for certain usages is generally unknown and thus not followed. The painter's full name, however, having become commonplace, is usually spelled Vincent Van Gogh in Belgium. In Flemish surnames the \\"V\\" is always capitalized though a following interjected \\"de\\", \\"den\\" ('the') or \\"der\\" ('of the', 'from the') usually stays lowercase. * In South Africa the Afrikaans surname Van der Merwe would be listed under the \\"v\\" section as is done in Belgium (see below) and not under \\"m\\" as in \\"Merwe, J. van der\\", however South Africa follows the same capitalisation convention as the Netherlands (thus, one would refer in English or in Afrikaans to a \\"Jan van der Merwe\\" when the first name is included, but simply to \\"Van der Merwe\\" when the first name is omitted). *In anglicised versions of Dutch names (as in Dick Van Dyke, George Vancouver, Martin Van Buren), the \\"van is almost always capitalised in the United States, but in the British Isles some families of Dutch origin continue to use the Dutch form (e. g. Caroline van den Brul). * Some scientific terms derived from names have become words in their own right, such as vanderwaalsstraal (\\"van der Waals radius\\"). In English, The American Chemical Society Style Guide recommends writing \\"van der Waals\\", \\"VandenHeuvel\\" and \\"van't Hoff‚ÄìLe Bel\\".pubs.acs.org, ACS Style Guide. Chapter 9: \\"Gammar and Spelling\\". *Where the word \\"Van\\" is not of Dutch origin, such as in the Vietnamese middle name Wen or Van (as in D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh, Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu), there is no reason to use a lower case \\"v.\\" = Concatenation = In some names, usually those of the Flemish/Belgian ones, and also some of the names of people from outside the Low Countries (with Dutch-speaking immigrant ancestors), the prefixes are concatenated to each other or to the name proper and form a single-worded or two-worded surnames, as in Vandervelde or Vande Velde. Prominent examples include \\"Vandenberg\\" and \\"Vanderbilt\\". Nobility  The German \\"von\\" is a linguistic cognate of the Dutch \\"van\\", however, unlike the German \\"von\\", the Dutch \\"van\\" is not indicative of the person's nobility or royalty. Van has a history of being used by commoners and nobility alike to simply signify ancestral relation to a particular place, (e.g. Willem van Oranje \\"William of [the] Orange [family]\\"; Jan van Ghent \\"John [who hails] from Ghent\\").

It connects major points such as Newport Beach, University of California, Irvine, Boomers, Colonel Bill Barber Park, Irvine Civic Center, The Crossroads Shopping Center, Woodbridge High School, Woodbridge Community Park, Atria Senior Residential Area, Windrow Community Park, Irvine Medical Complex, and ultimately, Irvine Spectrum Center. It also runs through the majority of Irvine's neighborhoods such as Westpark, Woodbridge, and Oak Creek. The path begins where the San Diego Creek empties into Upper Newport Bay. The Bay itself makes for a pleasant ride with a Class 2 bike lane on the Eastern shore along a quiet road, some busy streets in the South and a section of Class 1 path to the east. Main trail San Diego Creek Trail as it passes under Jamboree Road at the Newport Back Bay One entry point is Bayview Way, which is just off Jamboree Road between route 73 and the bridge over San Diego creek. Riders can enter the path here and proceed North back to Jamboree Road and then East across the bridge, then take the ramp under the bridge. Heading North, the path passes through a wetlands area until it parallels University Drive with University of California Irvine on the opposite side. Access is continuous along this stretch, although public parking is not. University Drive veers East and the path and creek continue due North, with the wetlands giving way to a concrete-bottom storm drain. The path passes under Main Street and Alton Parkway, each of which includes an access ramp. Ultimately the path reaches a fork in the creek near Colonel Barber park, which has excellent public restrooms and water available. The path crosses to the opposite side on a bridge and continues on the Eastern branch of the creek, leading under more underpasses with street access at Harvard Avenue and Culver Drive. From here the path passes through the residential center of Irvine, with townhomes, more municipal parks and a lawnlike slope around the creek. There are several at-grade crossings of relatively quiet avenues. At one point there is another bridge that crosses the creek and is part of another bike trail that runs perpendicular to the creek trail, running through the central park of Irvine and frequented by a large number of pedestrians. San Diego Creek Trail Tunnel under E. Yale Loop near Woodrow Community Park in Irvine, CA The creek path continues to the East and culminates in a landscaped section that includes two short bike tunnels as it passes through Windrow Park. The last tunnel emerges on the East side of Jeffrey Road without clear signage. Making a sharp left curve, the trail runs concurrent south with Jeffrey Road to the car bridge over the creek, where there is an entrance to the continuation of the path separating from Jeffrey Road. The path runs past Oak Creek community until it reaches the Irvine Medical Complex and the industrial park outskirts of Irvine, crossing under Sand Canyon Avenue and Laguna Canyon Road. The path continues for a short stretch on the South side of the creek and dead-ends. It is possible to cross over to the North side of the creek and continue to the Highway 133 underpass, and emerge into the Irvine Spectrum Center. Alternate return path There is an alternate return path that includes Class 2 bike lanes, a Class 1 path through the hills above Irvine, and a Class 1 path built as part of the planned subdivisions of older Irvine. Access is South on Old Laguna (Road?), which leads through quiet industrial park areas to a bridge over Interstate 405, and on to an area of newly developed town homes all on relatively safe Class 2 bike lanes (with the possible exception of a narrow bridge). Turning right at Quail Hill Parkway leads to a traffic circle; to the left at the circle, uphill, is the start of the new Class 1 path. The Class 1 path begins on a very long uphill stretch, followed by a long pleasant downhill ride through a pretty canyon area, part of an affluent land development named Shady Canyon. Ultimately the path leads to an entrance guard house, and continues to the left on a section of Class I path (not documented here). Taking the sidewalk to the right of the guard house leads back to surface roads. Taking the first right on Sunnyhill (Road?) leads to a crossing into a small park, where there is a sidewalk / bike path that heads back uphill. This ends on a downhill street which leads to an intersection. Turning left at the intersection and using the sidewalk, which doubles as a bike path, leads downhill to the entrance to another Class 1 bike path, which snakes downhill on a narrow greenway passing under streets in special tunnels, reminiscent of a roller coaster ride. Caution is warranted, as this is in a residential section and there are pedestrians. Riders may also find it helpful to carry a map of this section of Irvine, since there is no signage for this part of the path and the first gap in the greenway can be confusing. At the base of the hill the path emerges into a wetlands area along University Drive: *A right turn leads back north to Interstate 405, which has a recently completed section of Class 1 trail that crosses I405 to Jeffrey Road, which intersects San Diego Creek some distance to the north of I405. *A left turn leads south through the wetlands crossing Culver Drive at grade, into another municipal park. The dedicated Class I path continues ending at a diagonal crossing of Harvard Avenue. In a very short distance, behind the Evangelical Church, is one of the ramp entrances to the creek path. Turning left here leads back south to Newport Bay and the end of the San Diego Creek Path. Peters Canyon branch Hicks Canyon Trail and Peters Canyon Trail Connection North of where they connect to the San Diego Creek Trail Peters Canyon bike trail is a medium length Class I facility that branches from the San Diego Creek trail in Irvine. Though not yet 100% complete, it is possible to make a 100% Class 1 trip from San Diego Creek to the terminus of the trail in Peters Canyon. The first section is actually a detour that begins at the corner of Barranca Pkwy and Harvard Ave. Cyclists coming up the San Diego trail from the south will note the branch between the channel of the San Diego Creek and Peters Canyon Wash. This is soon followed by the trail crossing the San Diego on a small bridge, and finally the Harvard Ave underpass. After going through the underpass exit onto Harvard Ave. The detour for Peters Canyon is north on Harvard. Cyclists have two options. There is a Class I trail on the East side of Harvard that resembles a sidewalk. It does not have any signs marking it as a bike path, but the Irvine Bikeways maps shows it as such. The alternative is a high-quality Class II trail running alongside on Harvard Avenue. After several at grade street crossings the trail arrives at the railroad tracks just north of Edinger Ave. There is a Class I trail to the right before the tracks which proceeds northeast toward Sand Canyon Rd. To continue on Peters Canyon cross the tracks and pick up the Class I bike trail to the left, crossing Harvard Ave. (Take care here as there is no traffic light.) This trail parallels the railroad for a short distance before turning sharply right parallel to Peters Canyon Wash. The trail along the wash used to terminate near the 5 freeway and there is still a sign warning that the trail terminates. However, the trail is now open. The trail actually descends into the wash under the 5 with the water in the wash restricted to a narrow concrete ditch that is part of the concrete block comprising the trail. Needless to say, this trail will be very sensitive to rain event closures. Rising back out of the wash, the trail reaches Bryan Ave. Taking the underpass, the cyclist should make a hairpin right onto the Bryan Ave exit ramp. A Class I trail does continue on the East side of the wash and includes several branches to the East into Irvine. However, the Peters Canyon trail crosses the wash and the 261 Freeway to the West on the overpass which has a dedicated Class I facility. Turning right, the Peters Canyon trail continues on the West side of the wash. You will note that there is a future provision here for the trail to continue South on the West side of the wash. Indeed, between this point and the railroad tracks the observant cyclist will have noted several completed and uncompleted sections on the opposite side of the wash. Traveling North the Peters Canyon trail runs parallel to an equestrian trail. From this point on, wherever the signs are insufficient to determine direction of the trail, as occurs in one or two spots, the cyclist may use the equestrian trail as a guide. The trail follows the wash and the 261 for a short distance until passing under Irvine Ave in a tunnel. It then turns West winding its way through a condominium community ultimately emerging alongside Jamboree Rd. Traveling gently up hill there are several at grade street crossings until the trail enters a park and then turns under Jamboree Rd to emerge on the other side. Some more at grade crossings are encountered until the trail turns West and North winding its way toward Peters Canyon Park finally entering the park terminating near the Lower Peters Canyon Reservoir. Combined with the San Diego Creek trail, starting at Newport Bay the total distance to Peters Canyon Park is approximately 15 miles and has a vertical rise of about 350 feet. The trail is fully Class I except for at grade street crossings and in excellent condition. There are signs and stencils on the San Diego Creek trail and the Peters Canyon trail marking the both collectively as 'Mountains to Sea Trail'. Entry points / parking *Bayview Way, just off Jamboree Road between route 73 and the bridge over San Diego creek, is a quiet dead end with generally ample parking next to the Class I portion of the path around the Bay and is the start of the San Diego Creek Bike Trail. *California Avenue at University of California *Mesa Road at University of California *Access ramp at Campus Drive at University of California *Access from intersection with Harvard Avenue and University Drive *Access from both south and north ends of Harvard between Michelson Drive and University Drive *Access ramp at Michelson Drive near Boomers *Access from the Freeway Trail *Access ramp at Coronado Avenue *Access ramp at Main Street *Access ramp at Alton Parkway *Colonel Barber park, which has restrooms and water *Access (Planned Peters Canyon Trail Connector) from Barranca Pkwy before Harvard Avenue *Access ramp at Harvard Avenue *Access ramp at Paseo Westpark *Access ramp at Culver Drive *Access ramp at West Yale Loop *At-grade access at Lake Road *Access from intersection with Woodbridge Trail *At-grade access at Creek Road *Access ramp at East Yale Loop *Access from Windrow Community Park *Access from Jeffrey Road, both north and south ends between Barranca Parkway and Alton Parkway *Access ramp from Valley Oak Drive *Access ramp from Sand Canyon Avenue *Access from intersection with another trail leading to Irvine Medical Complex *Access ramp from Laguna Canyon Road *Access ramp from Alton Parkway *Access from Spectrum and Pacifica intersection, where the trail ends Trail Closure: Signs on entry points to the Peters Canyon trail state that the trail will be closed from July 18, 2011 to Jan 01, 2012.

The term \\"rng\\" (pronounced rung) is meant to suggest that it is a \\"ring\\" without \\"i\\", i.e. without the requirement for an \\"identity element\\". There is no consensus in the community as to whether the existence of a multiplicative identity must be one of the ring axioms (see the history section of the article on rings). The term \\"rng\\" was coined to alleviate this ambiguity when people want to refer explicitly to a ring without the axiom of multiplicative identity. A number of algebras of functions considered in analysis are not unital, for instance the algebra of functions decreasing to zero at infinity, especially those with compact support on some (non-compact) space.  Definition  Formally, a rng is a set R with two binary operations called addition and multiplication such that * (R, +) is an abelian group, * (R, ¬∑) is a semigroup, * Multiplication distributes over addition. Rng homomorphisms are defined in the same way as ring homomorphisms except that the requirement is dropped. That is, a rng homomorphism is a function from one rng to another such that * f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) * f(x ¬∑ y) = f(x) ¬∑ f(y) for all x and y in R.  Examples  All rings are rngs. A simple example of a rng that is not a ring is given by the even integers with the ordinary addition and multiplication of integers. Another example is given by the set of all 3-by-3 real matrices whose bottom row is zero. Both of these examples are instances of the general fact that every (one- or two-sided) ideal is a rng. Rngs often appear naturally in functional analysis when linear operators on infinite-dimensional vector spaces are considered. Take for instance any infinite-dimensional vector space V and consider the set of all linear operators with finite rank (i.e. ). Together with addition and composition of operators, this is a rng, but not a ring. Another example is the rng of all real sequences that converge to 0, with component-wise operations. Also, many test function spaces occurring in the theory of distributions consist of functions decreasing to zero at infinity, like e.g. Schwartz space. Thus, the function everywhere equal to one, which would be the only possible identity element for pointwise multiplication, cannot exist in such spaces, which therefore are rngs (for pointwise addition and multiplication). In particular, the real-valued continuous functions with compact support defined on some topological space, together with pointwise addition and multiplication, form a rng; this is not a ring unless the underlying space is compact. = Example: The even integers = The set of even integers forms a rng \\\\mathbb R = \\\\\\\\{2x x \\\\in \\\\mathbb Z\\\\\\\\} It is closed under the operations of addition and multiplication and has an additive neutral element (namely, 0), but it does not have a multiplicative identity element. Notably, the even integers do not contain multiplicative idempotent, nilpotent or weakly invertible elements. =Example: Quinary sequences= The rng of Quinary sequences is the direct sum of infinitely many copies of \\\\mathbb Z_5 :\\\\mathcal T=\\\\bigoplus^\\\\infty \\\\mathbb Z_5 With componentwise(when one sequence is longer, fill the remaining space in the shorter one with zeros) addition and multiplication. It exemplifies many unique properties, such as a lattice of idempotents without an upper bound. Also, every element x has a Weak inverse, an element y such that xyx=x and yxy=y, namely, the element with all three‚Äôs and two‚Äôs swapped. In addition, for every finite subset of \\\\mathcal T, there exists an idempotent e which functions as a identity for the entire subset, namely, the sequence with ones everywhere there exists a sequence in the subset who has a non-zero element there.  Properties  Ideals and quotient rings can be defined for rngs in the same manner as for rings. The ideal theory of rngs is complicated by the fact that a nonzero rng, unlike a nonzero ring, need not contain any maximal ideals. Some theorems of ring theory are false for rngs. A rng homomorphism maps any idempotent element to an idempotent element; this applies in particular to 1R if it exists. If R and S are rings, a rng homomorphism whose image contains a non-zero-divisor maps 1R to 1S.  Adjoining an identity element (Dorroh extension)  Every rng R can be turned into a ring R^ by adjoining an identity element. The most general way in which to do this is to formally add an identity element 1 and let R^ consist of integral linear combinations of 1 and elements of R. That is, elements of R^ are of the form :n * 1 + r where n is an integer and . Multiplication is defined by linearity: :(n1 \\\\+ r1) * (n2 \\\\+ r2) = n1n2 \\\\+ n1r2 \\\\+ n2r1 \\\\+ r1r2. More formally, we can take R^ to be the cartesian product and define addition and multiplication by :(n1, r1) + (n2, r2) = (n1 \\\\+ n2, r1 \\\\+ r2), :(n1, r1) * (n2, r2) = (n1n2, n1r2 \\\\+ n2r1 \\\\+ r1r2). The multiplicative identity of R^ is then . There is a natural rng homomorphism defined by . This map has the following universal property: :Given any ring S and any rng homomorphism , there exists a unique ring homomorphism such that . The map g can be defined by . In a sense then, R^ is \\"the most general\\" ring containing R. There is a natural surjective ring homomorphism which sends to n. The kernel of this homomorphism is the image of R in R^. Since j is injective, we see that R is embedded as a (two-sided) ideal in R^ with the quotient ring R^/R isomorphic to Z. It follows that :Every rng is an ideal in some ring, and every ideal of a ring is a rng. Note that j is never surjective. So even when R already has an identity element the ring R^ will be a larger one with a different identity. The ring R^ is often called the Dorroh extension of R after the american mathematician Joe Lee Dorroh, who first constructed it. The process of adjoining an identity element to a rng can be formulated in the language of category theory. If we denote the category of all rings and ring homomorphisms by Ring and the category of all rngs and rng homomorphisms by Rng, then Ring is a (nonfull) subcategory of Rng. The construction of R^ given above yields a left adjoint to the inclusion functor . This means that Ring is a reflective subcategory of Rng with reflector .  Properties weaker than having an identity  There are several properties that have been considered in the literature that are weaker than having an identity element, but not so general. For example: * Rings with enough idempotents: A rng R is said to be a ring with enough idempotents when there exists a subset E of R given by orthogonal (i.e. for all in E) idempotents (i.e. for all e in E) such that . * Rings with local units: A rng R is said to be a ring with local units in case for every finite set r1, r2, ..., rt in R we can find e in R such that and for every i. * s-unital rings: A rng R is said to be s-unital in case for every finite set r1, r2, ..., rt in R we can find s in R such that for every i. * Firm rings: A rng R is said to be firm if the canonical homomorphism given by is an isomorphism. * Idempotent rings: A rng R is said to be idempotent (or an irng) in case , that is, for every element r of R we can find elements ri and si in R such that r = \\\\Sigma_i r_i s_i. It is not hard to check that these properties are weaker than having an identity element and weaker than the previous one. * Rings are rings with enough idempotents, using A ring with enough idempotents that has no identity is for example the ring of infinite matrices over a field with just a finite number of nonzero entries. The matrices that have just 1 over one element in the main diagonal and 0 otherwise are the orthogonal idempotents. * Rings with enough idempotents are rings with local units just taking finite sums of the orthogonal idempotents to satisfy the definition. * Rings with local units are in particular s-unital; s-unital rings are firm and firm rings are idempotent.  Rng of square zero  A rng of square zero is a rng R such that for all x and y in R.See Bourbaki, p. 102, where it is called a pseudo-ring of square zero. Some other authors use the term \\"zero ring\\" to refer to any rng of square zero; see e.g. and . Any abelian group can be made a rng of square zero by defining the multiplication so that for all x and y;Bourbaki, p. 102. thus every abelian group is the additive group of some rng. The only rng of square zero with a multiplicative identity is the zero ring {0}.Bourbaki, p. 102. Any additive subgroup of a rng of square zero is an ideal. Thus a rng of square zero is simple if and only if its additive group is a simple abelian group, i.e., a cyclic group of prime order.Zariski and Samuel, p. 133.  Unital homomorphism  Given two unital algebras A and B, an algebra homomorphism :f : A ‚Üí B is unital if it maps the identity element of A to the identity element of B. If the associative algebra A over the field K is not unital, one can adjoin an identity element as follows: take as underlying K-vector space and define multiplication ‚àó by :(x,r) ‚àó (y,s) = (xy + sx + ry, rs) for x,y in A and r,s in K. Then ‚àó is an associative operation with identity element (0,1). The old algebra A is contained in the new one, and in fact is the \\"most general\\" unital algebra containing A, in the sense of universal constructions.

Early life and education Reid was born in Aberdeen in 1841. He developed an early passion for drawing, which led to his being apprenticed in 1854 for seven years to Messrs Keith & Gibb, lithographers in Aberdeen. In 1861 Reid took lessons from an itinerant portrait-painter, William Niddrie, who had been a pupil of James Giles, R.S.A., and afterwards entered as a student in the school of the Board of Trustees in Edinburgh. Samuel Smiles (1891) by George Reid Career Reid returned to Aberdeen to paint landscapes and portraits for any trifling sum which his work could command. His first portrait to attract attention, from its fine quality, was that of George Macdonald, the poet and novelist, now the property of the University of Aberdeen. His early landscapes were conscientiously painted in the open air and on the spot. But Reid soon came to see that such work was inherently false, painted as the picture was day after day under varying conditions of light and shade. Accordingly, in 1865 he proceeded to Utrecht to study under Alexander Mollinger, whose work he admired for its unity and simplicity. This change in his method of viewing nature was looked on as revolutionary by the Royal Scottish Academy, and for some years his work found little favour in that quarter; but other artists gradually adopted the system of tone-studies, which ultimately prevailed. Reid went to Paris in 1868 to study under the figure painter Yvon; and he worked in 1872 with Jozef Isra√´ls at the Hague. From this time forward Reid's success was continuous and marked. He showed his versatility in landscape, as in his Whins in Bloom, which combined great breadth with fine detail; in flower-pieces, such as his Roses, which were brilliant in rapid suggestiveness and force; but most of all in his portraits, which are marked by great individuality, and by fine insight into character. His work in black-and-white, his admirable illustrations in brushwork of Edinburgh and its neighbourhood, and also his pen-drawings, about which it has been declared that \\"his work contains all the subtleties and refinements of a most delicate etching,\\" must also be noted. Elected Associate of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1870, Reid attained full membership in 1877, and took up his residence in Edinburgh, at 17 Carlton Terrace on Calton Hill,Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1889-90 in 1882. In 1891 he was elected President - a post which he held until 1902 - receiving also the honour of knighthood, and he was awarded a gold medal at the Paris Exhibition of 1900. In later life he lived at 22 Royal Terrace on Edinburgh's Calton Hill.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1905-6 He died in Somerset on 9 February 1913.

Boyer also spent four seasons with the Taiy≈ç Whales of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). In his 16-year big league career, Boyer hit 162 home runs, with 654 runs batted in (RBI), and a .242 batting average, in 1,725 games played. Early life Born in Cassville, Missouri, Boyer grew up in Alba, Missouri as one of fourteen children. All seven boys in the family played professional baseball, with two of his older brothers also reaching the major leagues: Cloyd was a pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals in the early 1950s, and Ken became an All-Star third baseman for the Cardinals. Early career Boyer was originally scouted by the New York Yankees while he was still high school. But because the Yankees had already signed two other highly touted \\"bonus babies\\" (Frank Leja and Tommy Carroll) prior to scouting Boyer, the team decided that they couldn't sign him due to the rules in which bonus babies had to be on the Major League roster for their first two professional seasons. Knowing Boyer might become a potential star, the general manager of the Yankees, George Weiss contacted the general manager of the Kansas City Athletics, Parke Carroll, whom the Yankees had a friendly relationship with, to sign Boyer with the final intention of eventually acquiring him (by trade or sale of his contract). In , Boyer broke into the major leagues as a utility infielder, at age 18. With no minor league experience, he played a total of 124 games for the Kansas City Athletics from 1955 to 1957. On June 4, 1957 the Athletics traded Boyer to the Yankees to complete a deal that had been made prior to the start of the season. On February 19, the Athletics had dealt five players, including pitchers Bobby Shantz and Art Ditmar to the Yankees for seven players, most notably Irv Noren and Billy Hunter. The trade also involved three players to be named later, two going to the Yankees, and one to the Athletics. One of the players to be named was Boyer, fulfilling Weiss' original intent of making Boyer a Yankee. The Yankee years After joining the Yankees, Boyer spent the better part of three seasons in their farm system until he was called up late in . He became the Yankees' regular third baseman in , beating out three others (including Gil McDougald, who had announced in spring training that this, his tenth season in the majors, would be his last) for the starting job. He batted .242 with 14 home runs and 46 RBIs as the Yankees won the pennant. However, he had a humbling moment in the first game of the World Series against the Pittsburgh Pirates. With two runners on base and the Yankees trailing 3‚Äì1 in the second inning, manager Casey Stengel, never confident in Boyer's hitting, replaced him with pinch-hitter Dale Long, who flied out to right fielder Roberto Clemente. The Yankees didn't score in the inning and lost 6‚Äì4, ultimately losing the Series in Game 7 on Bill Mazeroski's home run off Ralph Terry in the bottom of the ninth. Boyer didn't play in the Series again until Game Six. After the Series, the Yankees fired Stengel. Ralph Houk replaced him as manager and he had a confidence in Boyer that Stengel did not. Houk saw something special in Boyer's defensive prowess, and he gave him the opportunity to play every day. Boyer in 1962 The team (with Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, Elston Howard, Yogi Berra and Moose Skowron), which defeated the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series, was considered by many as the best ever, with sluggers Mantle and Maris chasing Babe Ruth's record of 60 home runs (Maris eventually broke the record on the final day of a 162-game season) and pitcher Whitey Ford winning 25 games and losing four. Boyer batted only .224 during the regular season, but more than made up for it with his defense in an infield that also featured the double play duo of Tony Kubek at shortstop and Bobby Richardson at second base. In the first game of that World Series, Boyer displayed his defense by making two spectacular plays ‚Äî one on a Gene Freese ground ball in the second inning, in which he backhanded the ball and threw Freese out from his knees, and another on a Dick Gernert ground ball in which he dove to his left and threw Gernert out, also from his knees. Boyer's offensive numbers improved in : career bests in batting average .272, home runs (18) and runs batted in (68). He also came within nine assists of the third base record of 405 set by Harlond Clift of the St. Louis Browns. Once again, the Yankees won the World Series, this time in seven games over the San Francisco Giants. In Game One of the Series, Boyer's seventh-inning home run off starter Billy O'Dell broke a 2‚Äì2 and gave the Yankees the lead for good; they won the game 6‚Äì2 in what would be the last of Whitey Ford's World Series-record 10 victories. The Series ended with Bobby Richardson catching Willie McCovey's line drive with runners on second and third. If just a few feet to either side, Richardson could not have gotten his hands on it, and the Giants would have scored two runs and won the Series. In Boyer batted .251 with 12 home runs and 54 RBIs as the Yankees won another pennant, however, they were swept in the World Series by the Los Angeles Dodgers, the first time this had ever been done to a Yankee team in a World Series. Dodger ace Sandy Koufax won the first and fourth games, striking out a series record 15 batters in the opener. Boyer was the only Yankee regular not to strike out against Koufax. During each of Ralph Houk's first three seasons as Yankee manager (1961‚Äì1963), Boyer led all American League (AL) third basemen in putouts, assists, and double plays, finishing ahead of rival Brooks Robinson ‚Äî yet Robinson, not Boyer, won the Gold Glove Award each year. After the 1963 season, Houk was promoted to general manager and Yogi Berra replaced him as field manager. Early on, the team slumped under Berra, especially Boyer, who batted .218 on the season. As Berra's managing improved, the team improved with it and won its fifth straight pennant by one game over the Chicago White Sox and two over the third place Baltimore Orioles. The Yankees faced the St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series with Clete playing against his brother Ken. The Yankees lost in seven games, but not before Ken and Clete became the first brothers to hit home runs on opposing teams in a World Series game. In the 7th inning of that seventh game, Ken homered off Yankee pitcher Steve Hamilton and exchanged nods with Clete. Clete returned the favor in the 9th after homering off Cardinal ace Bob Gibson. After the 1964 Series, Houk unceremoniously fired Berra (in mid-season the management, dissatisfied with Berra's work, made up their mind to fire him at the end of the season no matter what the Yankees did) and replaced him with Johnny Keane, who had managed the Cardinals to the World Series victory over the Yankees. In spring training of Boyer was involved in a fight in a Fort Lauderdale bar with a male model, Jerome Modzelewski. During the season, he did bat .251 with a career- tying 18 home runs, but the Yankees slumped to sixth place, their lowest finish in 40 years. In the Yankees fired Keane two weeks into the season, and Houk returned as manager. However, Houk's second managerial stint was far less successful than his first. With their talent and farm system both depleted, the Yankees finished dead last ‚Äî the first time they had done so since . After a season in which he hit .240 with 14 home runs, Lee MacPhail, who replaced Houk as general manager, traded Boyer to the Atlanta Braves for Bill Robinson, that year's Minor League Player of the Year. During the off-season in 1964, Boyer appeared as an imposter on To Tell the Truth. Post-Yankee days In Boyer had his best offensive season. Playing in hitter-friendly Atlanta Stadium, he established career highs in home runs (26) and RBIs (96) in a lineup that featured the likes of Hank Aaron, Joe Torre, Felipe Alou, and Mack Jones; Boyer batted cleanup behind Aaron. He also continued his mastery of the glove, leading National League (NL) third baseman in fielding both in 1967 and . In the latter year, he finally won the Gold Glove Award that had eluded him in his Yankee years; with brother Ken having won the award five times, the Boyers became the first brothers to win a Gold Glove. On August 31 of that year, Clete fell victim to Morganna, the famed buxom \\"Kissing Bandit.\\" Prior to the kiss, he had been mired in a 1-for-17 slump; in that very at-bat, Boyer drove in a run with a single. He got two more hits later in the game, then eight more hits in his next 15 at-bats. In the 1969 season the Braves won the Western Division title (both leagues now had Eastern and Western Divisions, after each expanded from 10 teams to 12) for their first post-season berth since losing to the Yankees in the 1958 World Series as the Milwaukee Braves. However, the team lost in the playoffs to the eventual World Champion New York Mets. Boyer continued to sparkle at third base until he was released by the Braves on May 28, 1971, after a bitter feud with General Manager Paul Richards and manager Lum Harris over mismanagement. (Boyer has complained that the organization didn't teach the players the proper fundamentals. Richards countered that Boyer was a troublemaker. Boyer left Major League Baseball and resurfaced in Japan, where he played professionally for the Taiy≈ç Whales, from to . While playing in Japan, Boyer‚Äô s roommate was Sadaharu Oh. After retiring following the 1975 season, he was the defensive coach for the Whales in 1976. Afterwards, Boyer returned to the Major Leagues as a third-base coach with the Yankees and the Oakland Athletics, mostly with former teammate Billy Martin as manager. Legacy Boyer's teammates recognized his defensive ability. \\"When I think of Clete, I think of the outstanding defensive third basemen in baseball,\\" Richardson said. \\"I know Brooks Robinson got all the Gold Gloves, and he's every bit deserving of the Hall of Fame, but Clete was as good as anyone who ever played the game.\\" Richardson and Boyer remained friends after their careers ended. Kubek, also a lifelong friend of Boyer, thought he was as good at playing third base as Graig Nettles, Brooks Robinson, and Mike Schmidt. In 1986, Cletus Seldin, who later became a champion boxer, was named after Clete Boyer, as Seldin's grandparents were close friends with Boyer. In 2000, Boyer opened a restaurant named \\"Clete Boyer's Hamburger Hall of Fame\\" in Cooperstown, New York, just a few miles south of the Baseball Hall of Fame. The restaurant features sandwiches and hamburgers named after various Yankees' immortals such as: \\"Yogi's Special meatball sub\\", \\"the Mickey Mantle Cheeseburger Deluxe\\", \\"the Reggie Veggie Burger\\", \\"the Bobby Richardson Cheeseburger\\", \\"the Roger Maris Hamburger Deluxe\\", and \\"the Whitey Ford Blue Cheese Burger\\". Boyer could often be found at the restaurant chatting with visitors and graciously signing photos and other memorabilia. Death Boyer died on June 4, 2007 in an Atlanta area hospital from complications following a brain hemorrhage. Brother Ken Boyer (1964 National League MVP), former St. Louis Cardinal, predeceased Clete in 1982. Boyer's family had his cremated remains placed in a New York Yankees urn.

It was used by the Royal Navy when on patrol looking for German auxiliary cruisers and others ships that had been disguised by Axis forces. Under this system, a patrolling warship or aircraft would individually identify a suspect ship via the Admiralty in London; this step became necessary and was introduced after a German-held British ship in October 1942 was twice passed off by the Allies as still being British when challenged. German auxiliary cruiser Atlantis was disguised as the Norwegian MV Tamesis and the Dutch MVs Abbekerk and Brastagi at various times during commerce raiding. Background German auxiliary cruisers prowled the Atlantic and Indian Oceans searching for Allied merchant ships. Axis merchant ships overseas when the war began were used to refuel these auxiliary cruisers, pocket battleships, and long-range U-boats. Any Allied merchant ships captured by German ships could be similarly used for resupply. These Axis-crewed ships pretended to be neutral or Allied merchant ships if they encountered Allied patrols. Allied warships patrolling for Axis ships were given a list of Allied ships they were likely to see, and the list was periodically updated by radio signals from shore. Through the first half of the war, Allied warships frequently encountered Allied ships not on their lists. Only half of British ships correctly answered a challenge with their secret code, and foreign ships were even less likely to respond appropriately. The lists often contained misspelled names or former names of renamed ships. Implementation The check-mate system became fully operational on 8 June 1943. From that date the Allies estimated the daily position of every independently routed ocean-going merchant ship in the world. The check-mate system required the Allied patrol aircraft or warship to identify each newly encountered ship with a Merchant Ship Description Code and a Merchant Ship Silhouette Characteristics Register in comparison to their list of anticipated contacts and the secret signal. If identification was uncertain, the Allied patrol could make a plain language radio query to shore and expect a reply within a few minutes. The query format was: * EMERGENCY CHECK (stranger's code letters) (alleged name) (position - by lettered coordinates) Possible replies were: * MATE TRUE (the ship could be there), * MATE FALSE (the identified ship could not be at that location), or * MATE DOUBTFUL (requiring further investigation by the patrol) References Category:History of the Royal Navy ","title":"Check-mate system"},{"id":"3405068","text":"The XM307 Advanced Crew Served Weapon (ACSW) was a developmental 25 mm belt- fed automatic grenade launcher with programmable airburst capability. It is the result of the OCSW or Objective Crew Served Weapon project. It is lightweight and designed to be two-man portable, as well as vehicle mounted. The XM307 can kill or suppress enemy combatants out to 2,000 meters (2,187 yd), and destroy lightly armored vehicles, watercraft, and helicopters at 1,000 meters (1,094 yd). The project was canceled in 2007. Overview The system was under development by General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products for the U.S. Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM). As a part of the Small Arms Master Plan (SAMP) program, it is intended to either replace or supplement the Mk19 automatic grenade launcher and the M2 heavy machine gun. It fires 25 mm point-detonating and air burst style ammunition, including HE, and HEAT at a cyclic rate of 260 rounds per minute and has an effective range up to 2 kilometers. The primary feature of the XM307 is its attenuated recoil system. The weapon controls recoil to a degree that a large tripod and heavy sandbags are not required to effectively employ this weapon. Because of its reduced recoil impulse and light weight, other mounting options are possible, such as small unmanned vehicles and aircraft. The XM307's airburst rounds make it much easier to bypass walls protecting enemies that could cause collateral damage if fired upon directly. Operators do not have to shoot through the wall, just through an opening or over the top to kill the people behind the cover, leaving the structure of the building intact. An additional feature of the XM307 is that it can be converted into the XM312, a 12.7 mm (.50)-caliber version for infantry and light anti-armor support in under two minutes (1 minute, 42 seconds). 25mm Training Practice projectile.

Service history Originally named Katherine, she was renamed Liberty to honor the patriot cause. She sailed to Fort Ticonderoga on 13 May 1775 and filled out her crew. Later that day she got underway for Fort Crown Point where she arrived at sunset the following day. On 16 May she pushed on toward St. Jean, the British shipyard on the lake. North of Isle La Motte, the schooner was becalmed, but General Benedict Arnold with a party of 35 men pressed on in small boats. After rowing all night the raiders surprised the fort and captured the sloop George, mounting six 6-pounders. Liberty and the prize, renamed , gave the Americans undisputed control of the entire lake. The two ships, reinforced by new vessels built at Skenesboro, supported the Continental forces during the Canadian campaign, and prepared to defend the lake when the British assumed the offensive.

Sailcloth encompasses a wide variety of materials that span those from natural fibers, such as flax, hemp or cotton in various forms of sail canvas, to synthetic fibers, including nylon, polyester, aramids, and carbon fibers in a variety of woven, spun and molded textiles. History Volunteer wins the America's Cup in 1887 with cotton sails =Western traditions= Doek is Dutch for cloth, which evolved into the English word \\"duck\\" in reference to sail canvas. Duck was typically made from cotton or linen (flax), with some use of hemp. These natural fibers have poor resistance to rot, UV light and water absorption. Linen is stronger, but cotton is lighter. Linen was the traditional fiber of sails until it was supplanted by cotton during the 19th century. At first cotton was used as a matter of necessity in the United States as it was indigenous and the supply of flax was periodically interrupted by wars such as the War of 1812, during which demand for sailcloth for military use was high. As sail size grew linen was too heavy to be practical so cotton became more popular. Cotton did not substantially replace linen worldwide until the end of the age of sail; however, in some cases the strength of linen was preferred for some types of sails. It was not until the late 20th century that natural fibers were replaced by synthetics in mainstream use. Cotton sailcloth is still used for sportswear, upholstery and draperies. The traditional width for carded cotton sailcloth in the US was 23 inches (58 cm) while the British standard was 24 inches (61 cm). =Other traditions= The wa proa of the Caroline Islands traditionally used pandanus matting as sailcloth. Modern fibers Comparison of attributes of sailcloth fibers The characteristics of a sail are due to design, construction and the attributes of the fibers, which are woven together to make the sail cloth. The following sections discuss the attributes of fibers assuming a good design and careful construction. According to Mahr, there are six key factors in evaluating a fiber for suitability in weaving a sail-cloth: *Initial modulus ‚Äì The ability to resist stretching. Higher resistance is better for upwind sails. *Breaking strength ‚Äì Measured as a force per cross sectional area of fiber. Higher is better for sails. *Creep ‚Äì Describes the long term stretch of a fiber or fabric. A material with creep may have a superior modulus, but lose its shape over time. *Resistance to ultraviolet light ‚Äì Strength loss from exposure to the Sun‚Äôs UV rays measured by a standardized exposure test. *Flex strength ‚Äì Strength lost due to bending, folding, or flogging, which is frequently measured with an industry standard 50 fold test. *Cost-effectiveness ‚ÄìBoth the initial cost and its durability of the material define its cost-effectiveness over time. There is no perfect solution since in most cases the increase of one attribute generally results in the decreased attractiveness of another. Reduced stretch generally also reduces the flexibility causing a trade-off of performance for durability. Solving both problems generally sends the price out of range for most sailors. =Nylon= Spinnaker, made of nylon because of its light weight and high strength. Nylon is used in spinnakers because of its light weight, high tensile strength, superior abrasion resistance and flexibility. However, it has a low modulus allowing too much stretch to be suitable for upwind sails. Nylon is more susceptible to UV and chemical degradation than polyesters and its physical properties can change due to moisture absorption. =Polyester (PET)= Polyethylene terephthalate, the most common type of polyester, is the most common fiber used in sailcloth; it is also commonly referred to by the brand name Dacron. PET has excellent resiliency, high abrasion resistance, high UV resistance, high flex strength and low cost. Low absorbency allows the fiber to dry quickly. PET has been replaced by stronger fibers for most serious racing applications, but remains the most popular sail cloth due to lower price and high durability. Dacron is the brand name of Dupont‚Äôs Type 52 high modulus fiber made specifically for sailcloth. Allied Signal has produced a fiber called 1W70 polyester that has a 27% higher tenacity than Dacron. Other trade names include Terylene, Tetoron, Trevira and Diolen. =PEN fiber (Pentex)= PEN (Polyethylene naphthalate), commonly known by Honeywell's trade name \\"Pentex\\", is another kind of polyester fiber, which stretches only 40% as much as standard PET fibers, but about twice as much as Kevlar 29. Because it only shrinks about a third as much as a good PET, PEN can not be woven as tightly; thus, woven PEN must be impregnated with resin making sails prone to damage from improper use and handling. PEN is better suited for making laminated sailcloth, where the fibers are laid straight for strength and are bonded to sheets of film for stability (e.g., PET film often called by one of its trade names Mylar), or as a taffeta outer layer of a laminate, protecting a PET film. PEN laminates are an economical alternative for higher performance sail. =Kevlar= Aramid (Kevlar) sails, showing the typical color of the fabric. Kevlar, an aramid fiber, has become the predominant fiber for racing sails, since it was introduced by DuPont in 1971. It is stronger, has a higher strength to weight ratio than steel, and has a modulus that is five times greater than PET, and about twice as high as PEN. There are two popular types of Kevlar: Type 29 and Type 49, the latter having a 50% higher initial modulus than Type 29 but a lower flex loss. DuPont has developed higher modulus Types 129, 149 and 159, but these have seen little use in sails, since generally as the modulus increases the flex strength decreases. DuPont has recently introduced Kevlar Edge, a fiber developed specifically for sails with 25% higher flex strength and a higher modulus than Kevlar 49. Kevlar, along with other aramid fibers, have poor UV resistance (Kevlar loses strength roughly twice as quickly in sunlight as PET) and rapid loss of strength with flexing, folding and flogging. Minimal flogging and careful handling can greatly extend the life of a Kevlar sail. =Technora= Technora is an aramid, which is produced in Japan by Teijin, has a slightly lower modulus strength than Kevlar 29 but a slightly higher resistance to flex fatigue. The fiber‚Äôs lower UV resistance is enhanced by dying the naturally gold fiber black. Technora is most often used as bias support (X-ply) in laminate sailcloth. =Twaron= Twaron is an aramid, which is produced in The Netherlands by Teijin, is chemically and physically similar to DuPont‚Äôs Kevlar. Twaron HM (High modulus) has similar stretch properties to Kevlar 49, greater tensile strength and better UV resistance. Twaron SM is similar to Kevlar 29. Like Kevlar, the fiber is a bright gold color. =Spectra= Spectra is an ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) made by Honeywell, which offers superior UV resistance (on par with PET), very high initial modulus numbers (second only to high modulus Carbon Fiber), superior breaking strength, and high flex strength. However, it also exhibits permanent and continuous elongation under a sustained load (AKA: creep). This results in a change in shape as the sail ages. Because of this Spectra is only used in spinnakers on high performance boats where the sails are replaced regularly. =Dyneema= Equivalent to Spectra, Dyneema is an extremely strong fiber produced by the Dutch company DSM. It is often used by European sailcloth manufacturers, is available in a wider variety of yarn sizes than Spectra, and is growing in popularity. Dyneema DSK78 set a new standard combining the typical high strength to weight ratio, excellent low stretch, abrasion, and UV resistance but added three times better creep performance compared to Dyneema SK75 and nearly two times better than Dyneema SK90. =Certran= Hoechst Celanese produces Certran polyethylene similar to Spectra, with about one half the modulus rating of Spectra. It has similar properties to Spectra including superior resistance to flex fatigue and UV degradation but also exhibits creep. =Zylon (PBO)= PBO (Poly (p-phenylene-2, 6-benzobisoxazole)) is liquid crystal polymer developed by Japan-based Toyobo under the trade name Zylon. It is a gold fiber with an initial modulus that is significantly higher than other high modulus yarns, including aramids. Among PBO's desirable properties are high thermal stability, low creep, high chemical resistance, high cut and abrasion resistance, and excellent resistance to stretch after repeated folding. PBO is also quite flexible and has a soft feel. But PBOs have poor resistance to both UV and visible light. =Vectran= Carbon fiber mainsail, showing grey-scale hues typical of the material. Vectran is a polyester-based high performance LCP (liquid crystal polymer) produced by Ticona. It is naturally gold in color and has a modulus similar to Kevlar 29, but has less strength loss with flex. This is a benefit in endurance applications and for cruising sails where durability is key. Additional advantages of Vectran fiber has a 0.02% creep at 30% of max load after 10 000 hours, high chemical and abrasion resistance and high tensile strength. The UV endurance is inferior to PET and PEN, but the degradation levels off after roughly 400 hours of exposure, while the Aramids and Spectra continue to degrade. =Carbon fiber= Carbon fiber is a high modulus synthetic fiber made from carbon atoms. It is virtually unaffected by UV exposure and provides exceptionally low stretch. Variants can balance along a continuum from brittle with no-stretch to extreme durability/flexibility with only slightly more stretch than aramid sails. Weaving Combed singles yarn sailcloth in high counts is used for spinnaker and head sails. The count often is 148 by 160 and the fabric is finished at wide with a length-to-mass ratio of about 13.10 m/kg (6 yd/lb). The quality and weight of the weave can be more critical than the choice of fibers, since a poor weave can lead to high stretch and poor sail form. Weight is described in ounces, for example \\"an 8 oz. cloth\\". This means that an area of weighs . Sailcloth is woven in two forms: balanced and unbalanced. The yarns in balanced cloth are the same diameter and weight in lengthwise (the \\"warp\\") and across the width of the cloth (the \\"fill\\"). Unbalanced means a heavier yarn is used in one direction. Most moderns sails are \\"crosscut\\", which is an unbalanced technique where the heavier yarns is in the fill. This allows greater loads to radiate up from the clew (back lower corner) along the leech (back edge). This is especially true of mainsails and high aspect jibs. Woven sail cloths have an inherent problem with stretch resistance. In a weave the warp and fill yarns pass over and under one another. As load is applied the yarns attempt to straighten out, this results in the fabric stretching, commonly referred to as \\"crimp\\". Fibers which are resistant to stretching cannot be woven as tightly as more flexible fibers such as PET, thus the cloth is more affected by crimp. Films Films are thin sheet material extruded from synthetic polymers and are typically used along with woven cloth in a laminate (see laminates below). =PET= PET film is the most common film used in laminated sailcloth. It is an extruded and biaxially oriented version of PET fiber. In the US and Britain, the most well-known trade names are Mylar and Melinex. =PEN Film= PEN film is extruded and biaxially oriented version of PEN fiber. Just as PEN fiber is stronger than PET fiber, PEN film is stronger than PET film. However, PEN film is rarely used in standard sailcloth styles because it shrinks more rapidly than PET, is less resistant to abuse, and reduces the working life of the sail. Scrim and strands Strands are combined from fibers; these are frequently narrow flat bands or ribbons of high strength material. Scrim is a loose weave or lattice of strands, typically bonded where they cross to maintain the grid pattern. Strands and scrims are used to strengthen or reinforce sailcloth (see laminates below). Laminated sailcloth  In the 1970s sailmakers began to laminate multiple materials with different characteristics to synergize the qualities of each. Using sheets of PET or PEN reduces stretch in all directions, where weaves are most efficient in the direction of the threadlines. Lamination also allow fibers to be placed in a straight, uninterrupted paths. There are four main construction styles: =Woven-film-woven = Film is sandwiched in between two layers of woven taffeta, the film provides most of the stretch resistance and the taffeta enhances tear and abrasion resistance. The high-end versions of this method use a woven Spectra or Kevlar taffeta. In some newer styles, off threadline aramid yarns, are also laid into the laminate. In some cases the second layer of taffeta is eliminated for cost and weight savings =Film-scrim-film or film-insert-film (film-on-film) = In this construction, a scrim or strands (inserts) are sandwiched between layers of film. Thus load-bearing members are laid straight, which maximizes the high modulus of the fibers, where a woven material will have some inherent stretch to the weave. Laminating film to film around the strands creates a very strong and dependable bond reducing the amount of adhesive needed. In high quality cloth, the strands or scrim are tensioned during the lamination process. The drawbacks are: film is not as abrasion or flex resistant as a weave, it does not protect the structural fibers from UV rays. In some cases UV protection is added. =Woven-film- scrim-film-woven = Woven fabric with high UV and abrasion protection is added to the film-on-film. This combines the best of the above, but is costly, heavy, and stiff. This is an attractive method to combine high modulus fibers with poor UV resistance. =Woven/scrim/woven = Wovens on both sides of a scrim without the film layer. The problem is getting enough high modulus yarn into the sandwich, and still being able to get a good bond, because, dissimilar fabrics don‚Äôt often bond well. This technique is more experimental than practical, but may yield results in time.

Between 1669 and 1676 he served as a governor of Dutch Malabar and employed twenty-five people on his book Hortus Malabaricus, describing 740 plants in the region. As Lord of Mydrecht, he also played a role in the governance of the Cape colonies. Many plants such as the vine Entada rheedii are named for him.  Biography  Van Rheede was born into a family of noblemen that played a leading role in the political, administrative and cultural life of the province of Utrecht. His mother, Elisabeth van Utenhove, died in 1637 while his father, Ernst van Rheede, Council at the Admiralty of Amsterdam, died when he was four. Hendrik Adriaan, the youngest of seven children, left home at the age of fourteen. In 1656 he joined as a soldier in the Dutch East India Company (V.O.C., Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie) and served alongside Johan Bax van Herenthals (who would also take an interest in natural history). Van Rheede served under Admiral Rijcklof van Goens in campaigns against the Portuguese on the west coast of India in erstwhile Dutch Malabar. He gained rapid promotion becoming an ensign. In 1663, during a siege of Cochin, he was ordered to arrest the queen there and this act saved her life from the massacre of the royal family. The subsequent king of Cochin maintained cordial relations with him and Van Rheede was the Dutch captain who mediated with the Kingdom of Cochin. In 1665 he was appointed as commander in Jaffna and had Johan Nieuhof locked up for smuggling pearls.Heniger (1986):22. In 1669 Van Rheede seems to have been forced to resign from the Dutch East India Company by Van Goens.Ram (2005) The resignation was made as he opposed the repressive measures of Van Goens and instead favoured negotiation, but in 1670 he is appointed as commander of Dutch Malabar. In 1671 he fought with the Zamorin of Calicut. In 1672 he had to deal with the former VOC-employee Fran√ßois Caron, then serving the French East India Company. In 1677 Van Rheede moved to Jakarta, being appointed in the Counsel of India. He stayed for about six months but the conflict with Van Goens grew fiercer. He returned to Amsterdam in June 1678. Since 1680 he could call himself Lord of Mijdrecht (Mydrecht). In 1681 he signed a contract with the botanists Jan Commelin and Johannes Munnicks and began work on the manuscript of the Hortus Malabaricus. In 1684 he was empowered by the \\"directors\\" (Council of Seventeen) of the Company to inspect the Cape Colony, Ceylon and Dutch India to combat corruption within their employees.Adams (1996) He appointed Isaac Soolmans to accompany him. They visited Simon van der Stel in Cape of Good Hope, and Groot Constantia; the area Groot Drakenstein was named after him.Mentzel (1944):61. Van Rheede recommended measures for forestry and viniculture. Rheede, the Lord of Mydrecht, also made rules on how slaves would be treated and he decreed that slave children had to be taught to read and write with any flogging requiring permission. In 1687 Governor Van der Stel opened this region to farmers. Van Rheede was a bachelor, but had adopted a girl from Malabar with an unknown Dutch father.Heniger (1986):87, 90. He met with Van Goens junior, an ambitious administrator on his way to Batavia. Both men didn't like each other at all. Some time before Van Goens had given orders‚Äîafraid for competition anywhere else in the world‚Äîto extirpate all the acclimatizating cinnamon trees which were destined for the Amsterdam Municipal Garden. It is possible that the rare trees for the Grand Pensionary Gaspar Fagel were then also destroyed.Heniger (1986):72. Van Rheede sailed to Colombo and after two months to Bengal. He visited many VOC trading posts, especially around Hooghly. His next destination was the Coromandel and he stayed for one year in Nagapattinam. In 1690 he founded a seminary in Jaffna. Then he went to Tuticorin and the Malabar. In the end of November 1691 he sailed to Dutch Suratte, but died at sea, off the coast of Bombay on December 15, 1691. Some authors suggest that he was poisoned by VOC employees while others that he was sick already for a while.Heniger (1986):81. Van Rheede was buried at Surat on 3 January 1692 in the presence of his daughter Francine and many notables. Among the attendants was also Van Rheede's secretary Hendrick Zwaardecroon, the future Governor- General of the Dutch East Indies.

Since 1660, the Dutch East India Company had encouraged publication of scientific work and the documentation of the useful plants by Van Rheede would help in the fight against local diseases. The first volume of the Hortus Malabaricus was published in 1678, a compendium of the plants of economic and medical value in the south Indian Malabar region, was undertaken when \\"Jonkheer\\" Hendrik van Rheede was the Dutch Governor of Cochin and continued for the next three decades. It was published in twelve volumes and in four languages: Latin, Sanskrit, Arabic and Malayalam.Fournier (1987) Mentioned in these volumes are plants of the Malabar region which in his time referred to the stretch along the Western Ghats from Goa to Kanyakumari. The ethno-medical information presented in the work was extracted from palm leaf manuscripts by a famous practitioner of herbal medicine named Itty Achuden. Achuden was an vaiydan (\\"healer\\") of the local Ezhava tradition (that has in recent times been included under the label of Kerala Ayurveda). The compilations were edited by a team of nearly a hundred including physicians, professors of medicine and botany, amateur botanists (such as professor Arnold Seyn, Theodore Jansson of Almeloveen, Paul Hermann, Johannes Munnicks, Jan Commelin, Abraham Poot, the translator of a Dutch version), Indian scholars and vaidyas (physicians) of Malabar and adjacent regions, and technicians, illustrators and engravers, together with the collaboration of company officials, clergymen (Johannes Casearius and Father Mathew of St. Joseph). He was also assisted by the King of Cochin and the ruling Zamorin of Calicut. Carl Linnaeus made use of Rheede's work, noting in the preface of his Genera Plantarum (1737) that he did not trust any authors except Dillen in Hortus Elthamensis, Rheede in Hortus Malabaricus and Charles Plumier on American plants and further noted that Rheede was the most accurate of the three.Mueller-Wille & Reeds (2007) Many of Linneaeus' specific epithets based on Rheede originate from Malayalam names. While visiting the Cape in 1685, van Rheede considered a work on African plants of economic importance, Hortus Africanus, but this idea was never realized.

Formed in December 1941 at Nhill, Victoria, it relocated to Bairnsdale in mid-1942, and then to East Sale the following year. No. 1 OTU's primary role was to train aircrew for multi-engined aircraft operations. At its peak of activity in August 1944, it was operating over 130 aircraft, the most numerous being Bristol Beauforts. Its aircraft and personnel also conducted transport missions in New Guinea and maritime patrols in southern Australian waters. Following the end of hostilities, the unit was disbanded in December 1945. History alt=Two twin-engined military aircraft in flight During World War II, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) established several operational training units to convert recently graduated pilots from advanced trainers to combat aircraft, and to add fighting ability to the flying skills they had already learned.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 167‚Äì168, 364 No. 1 Operational Training Unit (No. 1 OTU) was formed at Nhill, Victoria, on 8 December 1941, under the control of Southern Area Command. Its inaugural commanding officer was Wing Commander A.I.G. Carr. The unit's purpose was to train pilots, air observers and wireless air gunners for multi-engine aircraft operations. The first courses commenced on 22 December. After preliminary training, pilots went through a six-week conversion to Lockheed Hudsons and Bristol Beauforts, while observers and gunners underwent instruction on Airspeed Oxfords and Avro Ansons. Their training included bombing, gunnery, navigation, evasive action, ship recognition and maritime reconnaissance.RAAF Historical Section, Units of the Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 65‚Äì67 Nhill was always meant to be a temporary location for No. 1 OTU, whose home was to be East Sale, also in Victoria. As accommodation at East Sale would not be available until October 1942, the school's 1,630 personnel were relocated to Bairnsdale in June and July. The base's living quarters, recreational buildings and 88 tents could not fully accommodate this influx, so the RAAF rented hotels in Bairnsdale for 320 airmen. On 10 December 1942, No. 1 OTU Detached Flight, consisting of 15 Hudsons and 108 personnel including air and maintenance crews, was sent to North-Eastern Area Command to help fulfill urgent transport requirements in New Guinea.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 662‚Äì664 This force joined a military Douglas DC-2 and eleven civil aircraft pressed into service to form RAAF Special Transport Flight, which operated out of Wards Airfield from 14 December 1942 to 11 January 1943. The Hudsons flew 645 sorties, carrying some 1,100 troops and almost 800 tons of equipment. Two of the Hudsons were lost, one to enemy action and one to friendly fire, and several were damaged. alt=Three men writing at desks, while another man supervises By April 1943, No. 1 OTU's complement had grown to 2,411 personnel. Over a four-day period beginning 20 April, the unit relocated to East Sale, using 110 tenders in 535 trips along the Princes Highway. Its fleet of aircraft included 55 Beauforts, 35 Oxfords, 25 Hudsons, 14 Fairey Battles and one de Havilland Tiger Moth. Training courses commenced at the new base the day after the move was completed. One of the students on the first course at East Sale was future Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. Group Captain Bill Garing served as commanding officer from August 1943 to February 1944. He set an Australian record on 19 January 1944, when he landed a Tiger Moth atop the Mount Wellington, to retrieve an injured stockman. Garing also took measures to allay concerns among crews regarding the Australian-built Beaufort, which appeared to have a mysterious fault that caused many fatalities.Page, Wings of Destiny, p. 310 By the time No. 1 OCU moved to East Sale, it had suffered 47 accidents involving Beauforts. Garing organised an aerobatic display by a Beaufort for the benefit of students, and an open day at the base on 16 October 1943; he also ordered extensive ground testing on the aircraft. Accidents continued to occur, however, and it was ultimately through the efforts of Wing Commander Charles Learmonth immediately prior to his death in a Beaufort off the Western Australian coast that the nature of the problem was recognised and overcome. As well as maintaining its training program, No. 1 OTU was required to periodically release instructors, students and aircraft for maritime patrols to protect Australian shipping lanes.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 140 In April 1943, six Hudsons were attached to No. 32 Squadron at Camden, New South Wales, for convoy escort and anti-submarine duties.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 144 A year later, four Beauforts were deployed to Mount Gambier, South Australia, to carry out a two-day escort for the Dutch transport ship Van Ruys. Beauforts from No. 1 OTU were also ordered to locate and destroy the German U-Boat U-862, which had shelled the Greek tanker Illosis off Kingston, South Australia, on 9 December 1944. Although the submarine was not sunk, it was apparently frightened off by the presence of the Beauforts and aircraft from other RAAF units in the vicinity.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 350 No. 1 OTU's intensive training regime included night flying, so that it operated almost round the clock. Flying effort reached a peak in August 1944, when 132 aircraft made 2,479 flights, instructing 221 students. The unit had by this time logged over 100,000 flying hours. It trained a total of 2,150 aircrew on Beauforts during the war, and suffered 147 aircraft accidents on instructional and operational fights in Australia and New Guinea, resulting in the loss of 131 aircrew killed or missing. Post-war demobilisation saw the disbandment of all the RAAF's operational training units; No. 1 OTU was dissolved in December 1945.

He was Speaker of the House of Commons from 1780 to 1789. Origins and early life Charles Wolfran Cornwall was born on 15 June 1735, the only son of Jacobs Cornwall and Elizabeth Forder, and baptised at St Thomas' church in Winchester ten days later. His parents were second cousins, both being great-grandchildren of Humphrey Cornewall, and he was given the names of two other family members: his paternal grandfather Admiral Charles Cornewall and his maternal great- grandfather Captain Wolfran Cornewall. Jacobs Cornwall died the following year, on 8 August 1736. Despite the naval associations of his namesakes, young Charles Wolfran was raised for a career in the law. He began his education at Winchester in 1748, going on to New College, Oxford. before started a legal training at Lincoln's Inn in 1755. In 1756, his uncle Sir Robert de Cornwall died childless, leaving him a considerable estate. Perhaps because of this inheritance, he does not appear to have had any considerable amount of legal practice, though he was called to the bar at Gray's Inn in 1757 and became a bencher there in 1770. Instead, he dedicated himself to politics. Political career Cornwall's entry into political life was aided by his connection with his cousin,Technically, his second cousin once removed Charles Jenkinson, an association to be much strengthened when he married Jenkinson's sister Elizabeth on 17 August 1764. In 1763 he wrote to his future brother-in-law: \\"A seat in Parliament is my first object, without that I would not choose to engage in any department of public business.\\" However, he was persuaded instead to become a Commissioner for examining the German Accounts. Occupying this post from 1763 to 1765, he gained a good knowledge of Treasury procedures. After leaving this post, he began to drift away from Jenkinson politically and move into the circles of the Marquess of Rockingham and of the Earl of Shelburne. The latter was able to satisfy Cornwall's parliamentary ambitions by securing him the seat of Grampound in the election of 1768. He became a frequent speaker in opposition to the government on a variety of subjects, but specialising in issues concerning the East Indies. In 1773, he declined an offer from Lord North of a post in Bengal to supervise and regulate the activities of the East India Company. Unlike many of his Opposition colleagues, he supported the government response to the American Revolution, stating in the House on 19 April 1774: \\"We ill hold the title of mother country if we are to do what America says we must do, or desist from doing what America says we must not do.\\" Encouraged by this difference in view, an annual pension of ¬£500 (), and a seat on the Treasury Board, he crossed the floor to become part of the Government in 1774. In the election of that year, he was elected to represent Winchelsea, a rotten borough in the gift of the Treasury. He would represent the seat for ten years before transferring to the neighbouring Treasury seat of Rye. In 1775, he sold the estate at Berrington, which had belonged to his family for ten generations, to fellow MP Thomas Harley. Harley would go on to have Berrington Hall rebuilt by Henry Holland, and its grounds remodelled by Capability Brown. On 22 September 1780 he was appointed Justice in Eyre north of the Trent, a sinecure with a salary of ¬£100 (). Speaker of the House Speaker Fletcher Norton had offended George III when giving an address to the King in 1777. Consequently, when the new parliament sat in 1780 the government was determined to replace him, citing grounds of his ill health over the vocal objections of Norton himself. Cornwall was proposed by George Germain and seconded by Welbore Ellis, and elected to the chair on 31 October 1780. The King wrote that he was \\"a very respectable person for the office of Speaker.\\" Shortly afterwards Cornwall was made a member of the Privy Council. When in the chair, Cornwall would alleviate the tedium of long debates by drinking draughts of porter that were brought to him from Bellamy's - a refreshment house in Old Palace Yard. This unusual habit was noted in the Rolliad: > There Cornewall sits, and, oh unhappy fate! > Must sit for ever through the long debate > Save, when compelled by Nature's sovereign will, > Sometimes to empty, and sometimes to fill. > Painful pre-eminence! he hears, 'tis true, > Fox, North, and Burke, but hears Sir Joseph too. Like sad Prometheus, > fasten'd to his rock, > In vain he looks for pity to the clock; > In vain the effects of stength'ning porter tries, > And nods to Bellamy for fresh supplies; > While vulture-like, the dire Mahon appears, > And, far more savage, rends his suff'ring ears. On 27 February 1786, Cornwall used his casting vote to defeat a Government proposal on the fortification of Portsmouth and Plymouth, when the vote was tied at 169 members for and against. This was an early example of what would later become known as Speaker Denison's rule. According to Nathaniel Wraxall, \\"Cornwall possessed every physical quality requisite to ornament the place - a sonorous voice, a manly as well as an imposing figure, and a commanding deportment;\\" though he went on to criticise his drinking. According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography \\"though he never achieved distinction as speaker, his frequent and well-informed interventions from the chair demonstrated initiative and judgement. He called MPs to account for unparliamentary behaviour and ruled on procedural matters, such as allowing the innovation of parliamentary questions in May 1783.\\" During parliamentary recesses he took up residence at the Master's House of the Hospital of St Cross near Winchester, his own house in Barton Priors proving too small for a Speaker's retinue. Death Cornwall was the first Speaker of the House of Commons to die in office. He sat in the Speaker's chair for the last time on 29 December 1788, before falling ill with a \\"feverish cold.\\" He remained absent from the House for two days, but expected to return soon. On 2 January 1789 the Commons Journal records that \\"the Clerk at the Table acquainted the House that we was extremely sorry to inform them that Mr Speaker died this morning.\\" An autopsy was carried out where \\"a large quantity of cold water was found in his stomach; and one of his collar bones turning with a sharp point to his lungs, had formed an abscess and occasioned his death.\\" He was buried in the chapel of the Hospital of St Cross with a monument by John Francis Moore. The majority of his estate was left to his wife for the rest of her life, and then (as the couple had no children) to the children of his distant cousin Sir George Cornewall.

Charles Frederick succeeded his father as Grand Duke when the latter died in 1828. His capital, Weimar, continued to be a cultural center of Central Europe, even after the death of Goethe in 1832. Johann Nepomuk Hummel made his career in Weimar as Kapellmeister until his death in 1837. Franz Liszt settled in Weimar in 1848 as Kapellmeister and gathered about him a circle that kept the Weimar court a major musical centre.

The INF began in 1877 as a breakaway from the Ancient Order of Foresters after political disagreements. The INF grew rapidly and soon became the largest friendly society in Ireland. It supported Irish nationalism and its constitution called for \\"government for Ireland by the Irish people in accordance with Irish ideas and Irish aspirations\\". By 1914 the order had spread worldwide and had a quarter of a million members in over 1,000 branches. The influx of Irish labour into Scotland in the 19th century saw the movement gain a foothold, first in the west and later as far as the east coast. They were also prominent in Australia.Irish National Foresters, Freeman's Journal (Sydney), 4 Sept 1897, p. 17.

A son of Adarnase II of Tao-Klarjeti, Sumbat received the province of Klarjeti as an appanage where he ruled with the title of mampali, which seems to have passed on to Sumbat and his progeny after the extinction of the line of Guaram Mampali. He also bore the Byzantine title of antipatos patrician (antipatrikios, Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œçœÄŒ±œÑŒøœÇ œÄŒ±œÑœÅŒØŒ∫ŒπŒøœÇ). Sumbat had a residence at Artanuji (modern Ardanu√ß, Turkey), which towards the end of the 9th century began to develop into a thriving trading centre. Hence comes his territorial epithet Artanujeli (·Éê·É†·É¢·Éê·Éú·É£·ÉØ·Éî·Éö·Éò), i.e., \\"of Artanuji\\". Sumbat is referred to as \\"the Great\\" by Constantine Porphyrogenitus, author of De Administrando Imperio, where his name is rendered as Symbatius. Apart from Klarjeti, Sumbat must also have possessed Adjara and Nigali, since the latter two appear among the possessions of his son David (died 943). Sumbat also had a younger son Bagrat (died 900). The Art Museum of Georgia in Tbilisi possesses a late 9th-century reliquary cross whose donation inscription refers to Khosrovanush, wife of Sumbat, and her sons Bagrat and David.

It is the third film starring Spede in a contemporary comedy after X-Paroni and Millipilleri. The film's release coincided with the 50th anniversary of the Finnish declaration of independence which is also referenced in the film. Plot summary The film is set to a frame-narrative about a film director and producer making a marketing film about Finland, using the visit of the son of a wealthy hair-creme tycoon, William Njurmi (Pasanen), as the premise. For the first two thirds, the film's events take place according to a conversation between the producer, director and a random Finnish tax-payer frozen by the narrator at the beginning of the film. William Njurmi, born and raised in the USA, is visiting the home of his ancestors who were Finnish. After an expansive tour and excessive time spent at a sauna Njurmi escapes the Finnish welcoming committee, runs into the woods and gets mistaken for a deer. He also walks in on an exercise held by the Finnish Armed Forces. Later, Njurmi runs into an inventor living in the woods (played by Spede's frequent collaborator Simo Salminen) named Simo. After Njurmi is almost forced to marry a farm-girl by her redneck in-laws he is saved by Simo. Though Njurmi is open about his identity Simo remains in disbelief until Njurmi returns to the Commerce Council but not before the pair steal a car and tour the country, effectively covering every tourist location in Finland. Becoming fed up with the Commerce Council Njurmi replaces himself with his body-guard, a stereotypical Italian mobster named Luigi (Esko Salminen) with full rights to use Njurmi's name and wealth whilst he and Simo continue to go about Finland unrecognised. It is at this point that the director and producer from the beginning of the film, removing their wigs and revealing themselves to be bald, turn out to be undercover agents for a party that is never identified during the film. Meanwhile, Luigi is constantly harassed by the Finnish Commerce Council who are trying to get a sizable donation often pleading pitifully. Eventually Luigi gives them a check but not before he has seen traditional Finnish winter-sports and dated the Miss Finland. Eventually Luigi is caught double- timing by his wife effectively terminating his role from the rest of the film. The film itself ends with Will and Simo being chased by the agents and fighting them off as they do. The chase ends at the Olympic Stadium in Helsinki where after Njurmi and Simo fight off dozens of agents Njurmi decides to marry a Finnish girl who just conveniently shows up. However the woman is also an agent, revealed when she removes her wig too. Afterwards Simo runs into the scene where Luigi had dumped Miss Finland into a swimming pool when his wife showed up. Simo then breaks the fourth wall by talking to the narrator asking \\"What the heck is going on?\\". He is then given a very brief and somewhat inaccurate explanation of the plot. However, Simo seems to have no trouble understanding and after saving Miss Finland from the swimming pool, he tells her they will go off to get married. The movie ends with Simo winking at the camera as the frame freezes and the words \\"Happy End\\" appear on screen. Production The film was Spede's second to be directed by Jukka Virtanen, with him also playing the role of the secret agent pretending to be a film- director within the film, and the second written co-operatively between Pasanen, Virtanen and Ere Kokkonen. Kokkonen also plays the role as his cohort pretending to be a film producer. Recurring actors from Spede's previous films include Simo Salminen, Marita Nordberg and Leo Jokela.

The station joined the network in December 2005, and is currently the second- newest station on the network, after Simonside, which opened in March 2008. The station is located to the west of the site of the former Backworth station, which closed to passengers in June 1977. The station was indirectly replaced by the nearby Shiremoor, which was purpose-built for the network, and opened in August 1980. Northumberland Park is located a short walk away from the nearby Cobalt Business Park, which can be also reached using Go North East's 19 bus. This route also serves Silverlink Retail Park, Royal Quays and the Shields Ferry. The station was used by 311,714 passengers in 2017‚Äì18, making it the fifth-least-used station in North Tyneside.  Facilities  Step-free access is available at all stations across the Tyne and Wear Metro network, with a lift providing step-free access to the island platform at Northumberland Park. The station is equipped with ticket machines, sheltered waiting area, seating, next train information displays, timetable posters, and an emergency help point. Ticket machines are able to accept payment with credit and debit card (including contactless payment), notes and coins. The station is also fitted with smartcard validators, which feature at all stations across the network. The station serves as a park and ride, and is served by a multi-storey car park with 393 spaces, plus 12 accessible spaces. There is also the provision for cycle parking, with 5 cycle lockers and 5 cycle pods available for use. A small bus interchange is also available at the station, providing frequent connections in and around North Tyneside and south east Northumberland.  Service and frequency  Northumberland Park is served by the , which operates between South Shields and St. James with an end-to-end journey time of 83 minutes. Services from platform 1 operate towards South Shields, with the first train departing at 05:49 (05:51 on Saturday and 06:43 on Sunday). Services from platform 2 operate towards St. James via Whitley Bay, with the first train departing at 05:15 (05:34 on Saturday and 06:19 on Sunday). Trains run frequently across the network, at intervals of up to every 12 minutes (Monday to Saturday daytime), and every 15 minutes (evening and Sunday), with the last trains departing at around midnight. Additional trains run during morning and evening peak hours (Monday to Friday) between Pelaw and Monkseaton. This provides up to 10 trains per hour through the station at peak times. Journey times from Northumberland Park are: Future developments As of May 2020, proposals exist for the reinstatement of a passenger service between Newcastle and Ashington, as part of the Northumberland Line project. The service would utilise the single-track line, which is currently used by freight services to and from North Blyth and Lynemouth. It is expected that additional platforms would be constructed at Northumberland Park, in order to accommodate the new rail service. Later phases would see additional stations added, as well as line-speed and capacity improvements elsewhere on the line. The North East Joint Transport Committee's bid for ¬£377 million of funding from the UK Government's ¬£1.28 billion Transforming Cities Fund, submitted on 20 June 2019, includes ¬£99 million to fund the reintroduction of passenger services between Newcastle and Ashington, while further work is ongoing to secure additional public and private investment for the project. As of February 2020, Northumberland County Council has agreed a further ¬£10 million in funding to progress the proposals, with the possibility of construction beginning as early as June 2022, for a September 2023 opening.

He is best known for his narrative cantatas ‚Äì works he has written for orchestra and choir based on Irish mythology. The Children of Lir, released in September 1993, remained at number one in the Irish classical charts for a full year. It was the first cantata written in the Irish language since the work of Paul McSwiney in the late 1800s. The BBC later produced an hour long documentary on the piece. Famine Remembrance, a commissioned piece to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Irish Famine, was premiered in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral in 1996. In June 2007, the piece was performed at the opening of Toronto's Ireland Park with the President of Ireland as special guest.Official website, patrickcassidy.com; accessed 29 November 2014.

Bleichr√∂der was born in Berlin. He was the eldest son of Samuel Bleichr√∂der, who founded the banking firm of S. Bleichr√∂der in 1803 in Berlin. Gerson first joined the family business in 1839.Fritz Stern, Gold and Iron: Bismarck, Bleichr√∂der and the Building of the German Empire (Vintage Books: New York, 1977) p. 9. In 1855 upon the death of his father, Gerson became the head of the banking firm.Fritz Stern, Gold and Iron: Bismarck ' Bleichr√∂der and the Building of the German Empire, p. 9. The bank maintained close contacts with the Rothschild family; the banking house of Bleichr√∂der acted as a branch office in Berlin of the Rothschilds' bank. Traditionally, the Rothschilds represented the banking interests of the Austrian-controlled German Confederation in Europe.Fritz Stern, Gold and Iron: Bismarck, Bleichr√∂der and the Building of the German Empire, p. 15. In the conflict between the rapidly rising and expanding nation of Prussia and the \\"pro- Austrian\\" German Confederation, the Rothschild Bank was largely caught in an uncomfortable position in the middle of the conflict.Fritz Stern, Gold and Iron: Bismarck, Bleichroder and the Building of the German Empire, p. 15. Meeting Bismarck Since 1851, Otto von Bismarck had been serving as the Prussian ambassador to the German Confederation headquartered at Frankfurt-am- Main, a free city of the Confederation in what is now western Germany.Jonathan Steinberg, Bismarck: A Life (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2011) p. 110. However, in March 1858, Bismarck was appointed ambassador to the Russian Empire.Jonathan Steinberg, Bismarck: A Life, p. 146. In one of his last actions before leaving Frankfurt for St. Petersburg, Russia, Bismarck consulted Baron Mayer Carl von Rothschild for the name of a banker in Berlin to whom he could turn for personal as well as Prussian state business.Fritz Stern, Gold and Iron: Bismarck, Bleichr√∂der and the Building of the German Empire, p. 17 Just why Bismarck would turn to the Rothschild Bank to supply him with the name of a competing bank to whom Bismarck and the Prussian nation could turn may not be as hard to understand as first thought. Everyone in Frankfurt knew that the Prussian nation would have to distance themselves from the Rothschild Bank given the Rothschilds' close diplomatic relations with Prussia's main rival‚ÄîAustria-Hungary. Yet neither Bismarck nor the Prussian nation wanted to burn their bridges and totally alienate the Rothschilds.Fritz Stern, Gold and Iron: Bismarck, Bleichr√∂der and the Building of the German Empire, p. 17. What better way to avoid this fissure with the Rothschilds than to ask the Rothschilds to provide the name of an alternative bank. Rothschild gave the name of Gerson Bleichr√∂der, who took over Bismarck's private banking transactions as well as the transfer of credits and/or placing of loans on behalf of the Prussian state and the German Empire. Thus, Bleichr√∂der became intimately involved with not only Bismarck but also with the inner dynamics of the unification of Germany. Unification of the German States Over the decades since the life of Bismarck, it has become an article of faith among German historians that Bismarck, himself, was the agent most responsible for the unification of Germany under the Prussian throne. This proposition, based on the \\"Great Man Theory\\" of history has been effectively challenged by recent historians. Importantly, German economic historian Helmut B√∂hme argued that the Zollverein customs union of northern Germany, not Bismarck, was the most important agent in unifying Germany. Consider the largely German-speaking territory in the middle of Europe at the end of the Napoleonic Era. There was no single German state. Rather there was a vast patchwork of small principalities, dukedoms and kingdoms. As the largest and most powerful of the German-speaking states in middle Europe, the Austrian Empire assumed the role of leader of all the German-speaking states of middle Europe. The Congress of Vienna in 1815 established the German Confederation which organized nearly all of the German-speaking states under the control of the dual authority of Austria and Prussia.H. W. Kock, A History of Prussia (Dorset Press,: New York, 1978), p. 207. However, Prussia was clearly the weaker power in this dual authority within the German Confederation. Economically, the Austrian Empire based itself on the landowning aristocracy. This landowning aristocracy required the Austrian state to maintain high tariffs against the cheap imports of raw farm products. This kept prices of food products within the Austrian Empire higher than in other areas of Europe. Prussia, because of its location near the Baltic Sea was an up-and-coming power in Europe based on the new economy of trade, commerce and manufacturing.H. W. Kock, A History of Prussia, p. 85. As an economy based largely on trade, the Prussian economy thrived only when barriers to trade were reduced‚Äîbarriers like high protective tariffs on imports from other countries. Accordingly, Prussia united with other German states in 1818 to form a customs union‚Äîthe Zollverein. The states which joined the Zollverein were other German states who profited from trade and who thus favored low tariffs or even \\"free trade\\". Generally, the states that joined the Zollverein were located in the northern part of the German-speaking region of Europe. The Zollverein was a Prussian-dominated economic union of German- speaking states. Because of the rising power of the Zollverein, Frederick William IV (1795-1861),Jonathan Sperber, Bismarck: A Life, p. 557. king of Prussia from the death of his father in 1840H. W. Kock, A History of Prussia, pp. 226-227. until 1861, began to entertain visions of a new political union of German states which would grow out of the Zollverein. The Austrian- controlled German Confederation had been disbanded during the Revolution of 1848. Frederick William IV's chief minister from April 25, 1849 until November 1850, was General Joseph von Radowitz.Alan Palmer, Bismarck (Charles Scribner's Sons Publishers: New York, 1976) p. 40. Radowitz now sought to establish a new Prussian-dominated union to replace the old German Confederation. In October 1850, an agreement was made to have an assembly of all German states meet in the city of Erfurt, Germany to form this \\"Prussian Union.\\"Alan Palmer, Bismarck, p. 40. At the time of the Erfurt Union, Bismarck did not have any use for the proposed union of German states under Prussian leadership.Alan Palmer, Bismarck, p. 40. Just why Bismarck of all people would refuse to support a unification in Germany under Prussian leadership in 1850 and just ten years later become the chief spokesman for just such a Prussian- led union of German states is curious, but as strong as the Zollverein was in 1850, the customs union, by 1860, had become much more influential over the economies of its members. Between 1850 and 1860, the members of the Zollverein adopted a common currency, a common postal system and a common commercial code.William T. Couch et al. \\"Germany\\" contained in Collier's Encyclopedia: Volume 9 (P. F. Collier and Son Pub.: New York, 1959) p. 61. Later the Zollverein signed various reciprocal treaties with nations outside the customs union, culminating in the signing of a reciprocal treaty with France in 1862.William T. Couch,\\"Germany\\" contained in Collier's Encyclopedia: Volume 9, p. 61. From this position of power, the Zollverein brought about the rapid industrialization of northern Germany and became a prime reason for Prussian involvement in the Second Schleswig-Holstein War of 1864. As result of that war, two predominately German-speaking duchies, Schleswig and Holstein were ceded by Denmark and annexed by Prussia and Austria.H. W. Koch, A History of Prussia, pp. 256-257. Another war, the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, and the dramatic military defeat of Austria at the Battle of Sadowa, resulted in both Schleswig and Holstein being ceded to Prussia alone. Neither of these duchies had much in the way of mineral wealth or industry. Even as late as the middle of the twentieth century, both duchies remained predominately rural with only 24% of the total population living in the main cities of Kiel ( 1950 pop. 218,335) and Lubeck (1950 pop. 133,021).James K. Pollock, et al., Germany in Power and Eclipse (D. Van Nostrand Publishing Co.: Toronto, Canada, 1952) p. 350. However, the duchies were to have a great impact on the industrialization of northern Germany because of their location and topography. As early as 1784, a canal had been operating across the \\"neck\\" of the Jutland Peninsula on which Denmark is located. This canal was known as the Eider Canal because it largely followed the winding Eider River across the Jutland Peninsula. The Eider Canal saved a great deal of time and money in eliminating the need of ships to sail the long and dangerous way around the Jutland Peninsula to deliver cargo from the Baltic Sea to the North Sea or vice versa. However, by 1860, shipping had gone from sail to steam and the Eider canal had been largely outdated. Accordingly, rebuilding of the Eider Canal or construction of a new canal was drastically needed. After the annexation of Schleswig by Prussia, the Prussian government set about improving the Eider Canal by building a new canal along a shorter, more direct route and by widening the canal to fit modern ships.James K. Pollock et al., Germany in Power and Decline, p. 115 Commercial pressure encouraged the development of the new canal which, when completed in 1887, was named the Kaiser Willhelm Canal. Indeed, the economic motivation behind the canal most probably was the main motivation for the war on Denmark in the first place. The Schleswig-Holstein War of 1864 was the first of three wars which are credited with bringing about the unification of Germany into a single state under the authority of the Prussian crown. The second war was the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and the third and final war was the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. In January 1871, a ceremony was held in Versailles which made William I of Prussia the German Emperor of the now unified German Empire.Alan Palmer, Bismarck, p. 159. This, then, is the background of the building of the German Empire against which the relationship of Gerson Bleichr√∂der and Otto von Bismarck played itself out. Banker for Bismarck and the Prussian State Gerson von Bleichr√∂der Gerson Bleichr√∂der served Bismarck at several crucial points during the period of time that Bismarck was the chief minister to the Prussian king. As a result of the Schleswig War of 1864, Prussia and Austria, as joint victors in that war, were awarded the two German-speaking duchies of Schleswig and Holstein on August 1, 1864.Fritz Stern, Gold and Iron: Bismarck, Bleichr√∂der and the Building of the German Empire, p. 50. Prussia annexed the more northern duchy of Schleswig, while Austria was given annexation control over the more southern duchy of Holstein.Jonathan Sperber, Bismarck: A Life, p. 226. Austria did not share any border with the newly acquired duchies, but the duchy of Holstein was located between Schleswig to the north and Prussian-controlled territories to the south. Austria sought to create difficulties for its up- and-coming rival‚ÄîPrussia‚Äîby entertaining the idea of inviting the heir of the deposed House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg‚ÄîDuke Frederick VIII of Augustenburg‚Äîback to administer the Holstein duchy.Jonathan Sperber, Bismarck: A Life, p. 227. This solution was intolerable to Prussia because the Duke of Augustenburg was related to the royal family of Denmark. The fear was that this would have brought Danish troops right back to same frontier that they had occupied prior to the war. Furthermore, the Prussian-annexed Schleswig duchy (where the Prussian government was intending to upgrade the Kiel Canal) would be isolated from the rest of Prussian Germany. Accordingly, a plan was developed for Prussia to purchase all Austrian \\"rights\\" to the duchies before any transfer of those rights could be made to Duke Frederick. The deal had a good chance of succeeding because the Austria Empire was in financial trouble at the time. Gerson Bleichr√∂der opened secret negotiations with Moritz Ritter von Goldschmidt to pay a large sum of money to Austria for any and all rights to the two duchies of Holstein and Schleswig.Jonathan Sperber, Bismarck: A Life, p. 227. In the end, the administration of Holstein was not settled until 1866, after the Austro-Prussian War. Meanwhile, Bismarck still faced the problem of raising money to pay for the Schleswig-Holstein War. To be sure, the victory in that war had brought glory to Bismarck and the Prussian nation. However, the elected United Prussian Diet which had the authority to raise public funds to pay for the war was still dragging its feet about paying for the Schleswig War despite the glory to the Prussian nation. Furthermore, Bismarck as a monarchist had long detested elected parliaments of all kinds and he especially hated going \\"hat in hand\\" to the United Diet to beg for money. Accordingly, Gerson Bleichr√∂der developed several plans by which money could be raised without going to the United Diet. For instance there was the Preussische Seenhandlung, a bank that had been founded by Frederick the Great in 1772, that still operated as an independent institute under the Prussian throne.Jonathan Sperber, Bismarck: A Life, p. 230. Money could be raised by the king independently of the Diet by either selling shares of the bank or by arranging a bond issue through the bank. In the summer of 1865, the Rothschild Bank, working through Gerson Bleichr√∂der, underwrote an entire public offering of bonds against the government shares of Seehandlung.Jonathan Sperber, Gold and Iron: Bismarck, Bleichr√∂der and the Building of the German Empire, p.231. Furthermore, much of the railroad- building in Germany had been done with public funds. In exchange for the public funds the government had taken part ownership in the railways. Consequently, by 1860, the government had a large investment in all the railroads in Germany. One of these railroads was the Cologne-Minden Railroad. Gerson Bleichr√∂der just happened be the banker for the Cologne-Minden Railroad and sat on the Board of Directors of the railroad.Fritz Stern, Gold and Iron: Bismarck, Bleichr√∂der and the Building of the German Empire, p. 62. Once again the government could sell its shares in this railroad or establish a loan with the government shares as collateral. In the end the government shares in the Cologne-Minden Railroad were sold to raise money independently of the United Diet.Jonathan Sperber, Bismarck: A Life, p. 230. The spectacular victory of the Prussian Army at the battle of Sadowa (K√∂nnigr√§tz), on July 3, 1866 during the Austro-Prussian War, changed the entire face of Europe. Many of the small German states flocked to the banner of Prussia by joining the new Prussian-led North German Confederation which was formed in April 1867. No longer merely an economic union like the Zollverein, the North German Confederation had a constitution and a democratically elected Reichstag based on universal popular sovereignty.Fritz Stern, Gold and Iron: Bismarck, Bleichr√∂der and the Building of the German Empire, p. 93. Inside the North German Confederation, the German nation was completely integrated under Prussian rule. However, the three large south-German states of Bavaria, W√ºrttemberg and Baden remained outside of the Confederation.Fritz Stern, Gold and Iron: Bismarck, Bleichr√∂der and the Building of the German Empire, p.121. These German states hoped to remain independent of the Confederation and had looked to Austria for protection from forced absorption into the Prussian-dominated Confederation. However, since the utter defeat of the Austrians at the battle of Sadowa, the three south- German states had begun to look to an alliance of Austria and France as their only protection. Thus, war clouds rose again as Prussia began to see France as the major obstacle to unification of all Germany under the Prussian throne. It has been a matter of dispute between recent German historians as to whether Bismarck wanted war with France or not. Some historians feel that Bismarck was forced into a war he did not want.Alan Palmer, Bismarck, p. 133. Others view Bismarck as actively pushing war with France continuously from the time of the Battle of Sadowa. The reason there are no clear historical records to resolve this conflict is that whatever Bismarck's views on war with France, he insisted on keeping his views very much private. What contacts he had with France regarding the political situation were made in a furtive way. Once again he turned to Gerson Bleichr√∂der to handle these back-channel communications with the French government. During July 1870, Bleichr√∂der was in frequent contact with the Rothchilds in Paris‚Äîbankers to Napoleon III and the French government‚Äîto ascertain Napoleon's true intentions with regard to war.Fritz Stern, Gold and Iron: Bismarck, Bleichr√∂der and the Building of the German Empire p. 132. As the chief banker for Bismarck and the Prussian state, Gerson Bleichr√∂der was also in a position to help several influential German families in their hour of need. In 1868, an ambitious 915-mile railroad project in Rumania, which would link the Rumanian capital, Bucharest, with all other major parts of the country, was touted to investors by financier Bethel Henry Strousberg.Keith Hitchins, Rumania: 1866-1947 (Clarendon Press: Oxford, England, 1994) p. 199. However, in 1871, while construction of the railway was underway, the consortium headed by Strussberg went into bankruptcy.Keith Hitchins, Rumania: 1866-1947, p. 199. In order to help a few prominent German families out of their rash and speculative investments in the Strussberg consortium, the entire Strussberg consortium was purchased out of bankruptcy by another consortium headed by Gerson Bleichr√∂der and supported by Otto von Bismarck.Alan Palmer, Bismarck (Charles Scribner's Sons Publishers: New York, 1976) p. 204. As a result, Gerson Bleichr√∂der became an accepted part of even non-Jewish and often anti-Semitic German society. He became a partner at the investment bank of Ladenburg Thalmann. Bleichr√∂der and his family were made Prussian nobles on 8 March 1872, in Berlin. Bleichr√∂der was only the second Jew in Prussia to be ennobled. Bleichr√∂der was preceded only by Abraham Oppenheim, another banker close to the regime, ennobled four years earlier. The German-American historian Fritz Stern wrote a double-biography of Otto von Bismarck and Gerson von Bleichr√∂der, Gold and Iron: Bismarck, Bleichr√∂der, and the Building of the German Empire .

It features one of the most famous appearances by Vesa-Matti Loiri outside his Uuno Turhapuro persona also created by Pasanen. The film also features a famous cameo of the Finnish pop- star Danny. The film is often considered as one of Spede's greatest, due to its human-story. It also features plenty of his zany comedy most of which takes place in Pasanen's character's fantasies (reflected off the sets at which he is working). Plot The plot concerns the character of Mikko Syv√§rivi (Pasanen) who works as a night-watchman and also becomes an assistant at a Finnish Television Company. His first day at work starts out quite humorously as he is mistaken as a minister in the Finnish parliament by an urging reporter Antti Vasa (Loiri) who takes him to a live TV-interview. Unfortunately due to the incident Vasa is demoted in to reporting on indifferent news-items with a minimal news-crew and often allowed to ask one question. Mikko on the other hand is also an urging writer who tries his luck comprising a comedy-show and even a police-drama. After catching Vasa breaking into a store in the middle of the night (in the hopes of covering the actions of the local police) he decides to help Vasa with his reports eventually getting him back on the show where started out. Mikko also tries to impress a girl at the cafeteria and is even offered to stay at her (all girl) dormitory. At the latter half of the movie Vasa turns Mikko's bumbling in to a hit comedy-act which comprises him of injuring himself on various types of doors. The fame naturally gets to him in the end and ruins his relationship with the cafeteria girl. He also sabotages his own success by going on stage with a new gag which is met with a chilling silence as the audience leaves. Mikko then goes back to being just an assistant but seems content with the outcome by the end of the film. Production Simo Salminen plays himself in the role of a popular TV-comedian, parodying Spede. In the film, he has his own comedy-show called Simovisio, a reference to Spede's own show Spedevisio. Ilkka Lipsanen, credited by his stage-name Danny, appears in the film. He performed the role of the singing and narrating bard in Spede's Noin 7 Veljest√§. Jukka Virtanen wrote the lyrics for the soundtrack. He also appears in the film's fictional live-broadcast play Rohkea Roomalainen (The Brave Roman - actually, a fragment of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar) as Brutus. Director Ere Kokkonen also cameos as a TV director in the film. Correctly translated the film's title is The Amazing Hesitations of the TV-man. N√§k√∂radio (vision radio) is an outdated expression for television. Siekailut comes from siekailla, an old word meaning to hesitate and which sounds a lot like seikkailu, meaning adventure.

Lucky is currently operated by Save Mart Supermarkets in Northern California. In 1998, Lucky's parent company, American Stores, was taken over by Albertsons, and by 1999 the Lucky brand had disappeared. On January 23, 2006, SuperValu, CVS Pharmacy and an investment group led by Cerberus Capital Management announced they had agreed to acquire Albertsons for $17.4 billion. Existing Albertsons stores were divided between Supervalu and the Cerberus-led group; the Cerberus-acquired stores became Albertsons, which then sold its Northern California and Northern Nevada stores to Save Mart Supermarkets. In 2006, both SuperValu and Save Mart began re-branding some Albertsons locations as Lucky stores, using the old logo. However, the same year, Grocery Outlet, an unrelated Northern California retailer, also began branding some of its stores as Lucky, claiming that Albertsons had given up rights to the Lucky trademark when it retired the brand in 1999.See also Grocery Outlet Inc. v. Albertson's Inc., 497 F.3d 949 (9th Cir. 2007). In January 2009 a federal judge ruled against Grocery Outlet, finding that Albertsons had continued to use the name Lucky even after the re-branding of its stores. SuperValu positioned Lucky as \\"'true neighborhood stores,' meaning they meet the unique needs of communities by providing the right products and assortment at the right price.\\"SuperValu:Lucky History =Beginning= An original Lucky refrigerator magnet bearing its trademark \\"Lucky means low prices\\" slogan Lucky Stores was founded by Charles Crouch as Peninsula Stores Limited in 1931 with the acquisition of Piggly Wiggly stores in Burlingame, San Mateo, Redwood City, Palo Alto and San Jose. By 1935, seven more stores had been added, including the company's first stores in the East Bay, in Berkeley and Oakland. Lucky had a big influence in transitioning from small store to supermarket. Its first flagship store opened in 1947 in San Leandro, California. It featured a coffee shop and other conveniences. Also known as \\"Lucky #50\\", this store was managed for years by San Leandro native Anthony (Tony) Minniti. Mr. Minniti was known for his old-fashioned approach that emphasized customer service. Tony enjoyed having a personal rapport with many customers over the years, and maintained a highly profitable store during his tenure. After his retirement, the store's customer base (and profitability) declined over time. It was the last Lucky Store to be re-branded after the takeover by Albertsons. Due to dwindling profits, it later closed in 2005. Lucky grew by acquisition in many markets including Big Bear Stores and Mayfair (Seattle), Jim Dandy and Food Basket (Southern California), Kash n' Karry (Florida), and Eagle Food Centers (Illinois). Many chains were operated under their old names for several years after their takeovers. Lucky stores in the Seattle market were sold to Associated Grocers in 1985. Lucky lacked a distribution center in Washington State and felt that it was impractical to continue to serve the market from Californian distribution and manufacturing facilities. Associated Grocers would rename the stores from their co-op owned stores and other independent markets.Lucky Stores said it agreed to sell 25 outlets. October 24, 1985 =Subsidiaries= Gemco, Lucky's membership department store Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Lucky Stores operated the Gemco department stores in California, Nevada, Phoenix, Tucson, and Houston and Memco in the Chicago and Washington, D.C., areas. In 1983 Lucky closed five Houston-area Gemco discount stores. The Memco stores in the Chicago metropolitan area were converted to Eagle Food Centers and subsequently closed. Lucky acquired Hancock Fabrics in 1972. Due to a 1986 hostile takeover bid by Asher Edelman, many Gemco stores were sold to Dayton-Hudson or closed, while Hancock Fabrics was sold as a public company and Kragen Auto Parts was sold to form CSK Auto. Lucky also owned 22 Mays Drugs in Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin. A lot of them were next to Eagle Food Stores. They were closed or sold in the late '70s. The Mays Drugs stores in Iowa were sold in 1980 to Revco Discount Drug Stores of Twinsburg, Ohio. Lucky Stores operated 22 Houston-area Eagle Supermarkets until March 1985, when it was decided to exit the market altogether. Twenty stores were sold to competitors and two were closed. Eagle Supermarkets had a 6 percent share of supermarket sales in Houston one year earlier. That put it behind Kroger, Safeway, Randalls, and Fiesta Mart, but ahead of Rice Food Markets and Gerland's Food Fair. =Marketing= During the 1980s and 1990s, TV personality Stephanie Edwards was a spokeswoman appearing in television commercials for Lucky stores. The marketing department was known as LuGem Advertising until 1986, located within the distribution center in Buena Park, CA. =Acquisition by American Stores and Albertsons= By 1988, Lucky became a part of American Stores Company, along with Jewel-Osco, Acme Markets, Alpha Beta, Buttrey Food & Drug, Osco Drug, Sav-on Drugs, and Star Market. The Alpha Beta stores in Northern California became Lucky Stores. A number of Southern California branches were sold to Ralphs. Some Lucky Stores with pharmacies changed their name to Lucky- Sav-on as part of the merger. In 1998, American Stores was bought out by Albertsons, which became briefly the largest grocery retailer in the United States, but became second after Kroger acquired Fred Meyer the following month. In the year that followed, all Lucky Stores took the Albertsons name, and the Lucky brand was phased out, in order to avoid confusion. In Central California, many Lucky Stores were bought by Save Mart Supermarkets and now operate as Save Mart. One store in Livermore, CA, survived this act. Return Supervalu-owned) at 1000 E. Valley Blvd. in Alhambra, California =Grocery Outlet return= In 2006, Berkeley, California-based Grocery Outlet closed its Rocklin, California, location, only to re-open the store with the Lucky name and the classic Lucky logo. On April 1, 2005, the Sacramento Bee, interviewing Grocery Outlet President and COO Bob Tiernan, reported that the \\"company believes the Lucky brand has value. And the new store format, with an 'every day low pricing' strategy, reminds us of Lucky\\". Grocery Outlet lawyer Peter Craigie noted that Albertsons has indicated its belief that it continues to own the Lucky brand. However, Grocery Outlet believes that Albertsons' failure to utilize the brand means the company has effectively surrendered the trademark. Grocery Outlet has preemptively filed a lawsuit against Albertsons seeking a declaration from Albertsons that the company has surrendered the brand. On the next day, April 2, Albertsons filed a request for a temporary restraining order for Grocery Outlet's usage of the Lucky mark. At the same time, on the Albertsons homepage, the Lucky trademark reappeared, seemingly as evidence for the mark's use. The request was denied by the District Court on April 5. Albertsons had argued that it did not intend to abandon the Lucky brand and that Lucky shopping carts still remained at some of its stores. District Judge Jeffrey White ruled that Albertsons failed to demonstrate that the use of the Lucky brand demonstrated unfair competition and that the burden to prove otherwise was wholly the responsibility of Albertsons. On July 20, the District Court ruled in Albertsons' favor, granting a preliminary injunction preventing Grocery Outlet from using the Lucky name. Grocery Outlet asked the judge to put the order on hold and appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The appeals court upheld the ruling in favor of Albertsons on August 9, 2007.GROCERY OUTLET INC.

It is also the capital and largest city on the island of Anjouan as well the former home of former Comorian president Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi. It now houses a deep water port, an ancient citadel, and narrow streets with many shops and small crafts. The population in 2010 stood at 25,471.  History  Mutsamudu was likely founded in the first half of the second millennium. It grew into a prosperous Swahili port, funneling traffic between the Swahili ports of Mozambique and Madagascar. Later Arab, Persian, Indian, Somali, and Malagasy sailors and traders settled in the town. By the 1700s, it was the most prosperous town in the Comoros Archipelago. During an expedition along the Swahili Coast in 1773, the commissioner Frederick Holtzappel visited the town. He expressed his admiration, noting that the houses were built with stone, whitewashed inside and out, had plank painted ceilings, and were thatched with coconut leaves. He also observed several two-story houses belonging to the \\"Turkified\\" elite. There were numerous public baths in town, and all of the elites had baths in their houses. According to Holtzappel, the men wore white linen gowns and turbans, as well as silk clothing and daggers with silver sheaths.

The medina from the 15th century is located between them. The citadel was constructed in 1786 with help of the British to protect the city from Malagasy slave raisers. It was badly damaged in 1950 at the landfall of a cyclone.Ouledi, Ahmed, and Mahmoud Ibrahime, Les Comores Au Jour Le Jour: Chronologie. Moroni: Komedit, 2007. Mutsamudu enjoys marine tropical weather. The main temperature range extends from 27¬∞C to throughout the year. The hottest period in Mutsamudu is from the month of December to the month of April. Comparatively cooler weather is experienced from the month of May to the month of November. There is significant rainfall in most months of the year, wettest month is January. The entire Comoros islands are regularly swept by violent winds and sometimes by tropical cyclones with significant human and material damage. The most important of tropic cyclones recorded in Comoros occurred in 1950 and damaged the Mutsamudu citadel. Cyclone Elinah in 1983 and Cyclone Feliksa killed a few people but affected thousands of people's lives.  Economy  Mutsamudu is the only deep water port of the Union of Comoros, constructed in 1982. Three quarters of its cargo consists of transhipment for containerized cargoes destined to the two other islands. The main import products shipped from the port are rice, cement, sugar, flour and petroleum products. Main export products are ylang ylang, cloves and vanilla.

It was the capital of the island in the past while the present capital of Anjouan is Mutsamudu.  History  In ancient times, Domoni was the capital of the Nzwani sultans. According to archaeological finds the town was established in the 12th century. Domoni was already a flourishing centre for trade in the 15th century with Africa, Persia, Arab countries, and India. Archaeological artifacts were traded with Japan. Ibn Majid Ibn, a navigator who travelled in this area frequently and who had guided Vasco da Gama to India, confirmed this port as a major trading centre. It was ruled in the 16th century by many chiefs (known as Feni) who controlled different parts of the island. Until the end of the 18th century, it was the capital of the Anjouan sultanate. It is home to a significant chirazienne (Shirazi) population who are descents of Sunni aristocratic immigrants from Shiraz, Persia, between the 14th and 18th centuries. Infighting among the chiefs of Anjouan resulted in their making an appeal to Europeans to broker a peace deal. Following this, Comoros initially became a French Protectorate in 1886, and in 1909, the French made it a part of their country. In 1975 the three islands formed a Republic of the Comoro Island. The first president of the Republic was Ahmed Abdallah, who hailed from Domoni and whose mausoleum is also located there. There were upheavals in the political dispensation in 1997 and again a rebellion in 2008 which was put down. Mwenye Fani, who took the name Abdallah I when he became Sultan, transferred the capital from Domoni to Mutsamudu. Domoni is the birthplace of the first president of the Comorian Islands, Ahmed Abdallah, and of president Tadjidine ben Sa√Ød Massonde. The third president was also resident of Domoni. Geography and climate Domoni is located on the east coast of Anjouan. Domoni is located on the east coast of Anjouan, also known as the island of Nzwani. Domoni is one of the three major towns of the island; the other two are Bambao and Mutsamdu, the latter is the capital of the island, in the western Indian Ocean. It is connected by road to Domoni, about away. Ngadzale-Ahajo lies to the southwest and Limbe and Koni-Djojdo lie to the northwest. The Ajajo River flows into the sea to the south.Google maps, accessed 29 March 2015. The airport on the island is in the village of Quani, to the north of Mutsamdu. The population of the town is 15,351. Bambao is away to the north. The old town is divided into three neighbourhoods: Hari ya muji, Maweni and Momoni. The weather data in relation to temperature and rainfall is for the period 2000 to 2012. The maximum and minimum average temperatures recorded are in December and in August respectively. The average annual rainfall recorded is with a maximum of in December and a minimum of in July. Landmarks  Oil slicks and trash has affected the aesthetic quality of the seafront area. Protective walls built as fortifications around the town were meant to prevent attacks by Malagasy pirates. A tower in the wall fortifications is in a state of ruin. The first stone building in Domoni was built in the mid-13th century. The old houses built by Shirazis, who had migrated from Persia, are still seen in the town. The first mosques built were during the eleventh and twelfth centuries and reconstructed in the 13th century and enlarged substantially in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. One such mosque was the Mkiri wa Shirazi or the Shirazi Mosque. The mosques in the town are built in stone masonry over raised foundations. While most mosques have one mihrab oriented towards Mecca, the Shirazi Mosque is distinguished by having two mihrabs. The town's Friday mosque has the tallest minaret on the island, which is rectangular in shape.The middle section of the town, known as Hari ya Muzhi, was the centre of activity from the 16th century onwards. It is the zone where the main plaza, the Friday mosque and a large number of mansions of the town are located. The mausoleum of president Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane, who was assassinated in 1989 by a presidential guard, is white in colour and includes four tall minarets. The town is known for its palaces and mansions of the 16th and 18th centuries, with a maze of houses with richly carved Swahili carved wooden doors. The doors in mansions have lintels in stone relief work. The stone buildings in the town often have a thatched roof over their terraces. Culture The town is renowned for its high quality wooden carvings. Delicate embroidery is made by local craftsmen. A colourful sight seen in the town is of women dabbing sandalwood paste on each other's faces while sitting on the staircase of the houses. Domoni's culture is described in two works by academics from Kansas State University, Marriage in Domoni by Martin Ottenheimer and Music of the Comoro Islands - Domoni by Martin and Harriet Ottenheimer. Women create music by using coconut shells, gongs, and sticks, as well as playing the tari (frame drum); men play on different musical instruments such as the fumba, dori, and msindio (drums), along with the gabus (lute), mzumara (double reed), nkayamba (rattle), and ndzedze (box zither). Wedding ceremonies feature a performance, a type of bullfight, evidence of the historical presence of the Portuguese at Domoni. The town has witnessed scenes of religious intolerance. Incidents of religious harassment of Christians in the premises of mosques in Domoni have been reported. In April 2001 leaders of the Christian community were questioned and threatened by Islamic religious groups. In one incident the father of a Christian leader had to pay a fine and the family live in exile from Domoni for a month.

Discussion This opening was tried by some hypermodern players such as Aron Nimzowitsch and Efim Bogoljubov, but it has never become very popular. The move 1...Nc6 is a fairly committal move which blocks Black's c-pawn; usually Black delays playing it until White's setup is clear. Most games featuring 1.d4 Nc6 transpose to another opening. After 2.e4 the Nimzowitsch Defense arises. After 2.Nf3 d5 a variation of the Queen's Pawn Game is possible. After 2.c4 d5 the opening is a Chigorin Defense. There are some lines which are unique to 1.d4 Nc6, most importantly 2.d5 which chases the knight away, usually to e5. The opening resembles an Alekhine's Defence but on the opposite side of the board. In an opening book by Sid Pickard, this variation was called the Bozo‚ÄìIndian Defense ‚Äì \\"Bozo\\" being a combination of the prefixes \\"Nimzo\\" and \\"Bogo\\".

As the show's title suggests, Hanna-Barbera intended the show to air on its affiliated stations in a morning timeslot before school. The show's title was inspired by the song \\"Shake, Rattle and Roll\\". After its single season on the air in syndication, Wake, Rattle, and Roll moved exclusively to The Disney Channel under the title Jump, Rattle, and Roll, with the title adjustment due to its repeats not being confined to mornings. Jump, Rattle, and Roll ran on The Disney Channel from October 7, 1991 to 1994, becoming the only Hanna-Barbera animated series ever to air on that network.The Disney Channel Magazine, Vol. 12, no. 5, August/September 1994: pp. 24-25, 32.The Disney Channel Magazine, Vol. 12, no. 6, October/November 1994: p. 36. It has also been screened on Network Ten in Australia while the animated segments were broadcast on ITV in the UK as part of the short running Saturday morning children's programme TV Mayhem, becoming the first series to debut on ITV during TV Mayhem. Plot The series was about a boy named Sam Baxter (played by R. J. Williams) and his robot D.E.C.K.S. (voiced by Rob Paulsen; built from old audio/video equipment and a Sony U-Matic videotape head; the name was an acronym for Digital Electronic Cassette-Headed Kinetic System) and their adventures in the basement, which has a time machine that can bring back historical figures. In some cases, Sam and D.E.C.K.S. occasionally have remote fights in which they each have a remote control and start pressing buttons changing each other from Hanna-Barbera stars to famous movie stars. Basement tech Sam's grandpa Dr. Lester T. Quirk (played by Avery Schreiber) is a brilliant inventor and is constantly supplying Sam and DECKS with sci-fi technology to add to their basement bedroom: * People Processor ‚Äì A teleporter used to send or retrieve people to and from anywhere in the world. Sometimes, it could even send people through time. * Mondo-View ‚Äì A supercomputer that was used for several reasons on the show. For example, Sam is able to talk to Grandpa Quirk anywhere in the world. * Debbie Detector ‚Äì A video monitor used by Sam and DECKS to communicate with Sam's older sister Debbie (played by Terri Ivens) which lessens the amount of time Debbie spends in the basement. It often makes an alarm sound when she approaches. Cartoon segments After a short live- action skit, D.E.C.K.S. would turn on the television screen on his torso and display an animated short. There are two new Hanna-Barbera series made exclusively for this program. =Monster Tails= Monster Tails is about a group of pets who live in a castle in Transylvania with their guardian Igor Jr. (voiced by Charlie Adler), the son of Igor (Iggy for short). Each of them had a similar personality to their masters, who were in Hollywood making movies: * Frankenmutt (voiced by Frank Welker) ‚Äì The Frankenstein Monster's dog. He has incredible strength, organ-playing abilities, and the brain of a genius (literally). * Elsa (voiced by Pat Musick) ‚Äì The Bride of Frankenstein's dog. Elsa has the brain of a parrot and a crush on Frankenmutt. * Catula (voiced by Charlie Adler) ‚Äì Count Dracula's cat. Although Catula is arrogant, he is a master of magic and transformations (usually). * Mumphrey (voiced by Frank Welker impersonating Woody Allen) ‚Äì The Mummy's dog, who is a constant insomniac. * Dr. Veenie (voiced by Jonathan Winters) ‚Äì Dr. Jekyll's dog, who is a brilliant scientist. But whenever he sneezes, he transforms into the super-strong (but berserk) Mr. Snyde (who is like Dr. Jekyll's evil alter ego, Mr. Hyde). * Angel (voiced by Pat Musick) ‚Äì The Creature from the Black Lagoon's goldfish. Angel is a ghost because she was eaten by a shark and tends to shout at certain times. Monster Tails was also shown in the U.K., on Channel 4's The Big Breakfast in 1993.

Each vehicle had a different theme, specific to its drivers; e.g., Yogi & Boo Boo's truck resembled a giant picnic basket on wheels.

It is to date the highest-grossing Finnish comedy and not too surprisingly the most well known in the Turhapuro series. It remains Finland's most seen domestic film made since 1968 , however the official statistics by the Finnish Film Foundation began in 1972, so all figures before that are estimates (although believed to be true). Thus this film is the most seen domestic film in the years with official statistical records (1972 - today), and 7th in the Top 20 of all time. Plot Uuno is forced to complete his mandatory military service when it is revealed that he only spent one day in the army in his youth. As is typical of the Turhapuro series, his family and friends become closely tied in with these events. His friends H√§rski Hartikainen and S√∂rsselss√∂n return to the army for a refresher course and by chance Uuno's father-in-law, Councillor Tuura is made the Finnish Defence Minister. As Uuno's superiors in the army learn of the high position of his father-in-law, they incorrectly deduce that Uuno has been sent to seek flaws in the leadership and conduct of the army. They try to bribe the completely oblivious Uuno with promotions to have him keep his mouth shut. Within one week, Uuno has been promoted from private to major. In one of the most memorable scenes, Uuno's wife, Elisabeth, dresses as Uuno and substitutes him for a day as Uuno has an apparently urgent meeting (at a restaurant) and while becoming lost in the woods with a malfunctioning radio, Tuura accidentally declares war on Sweden, causing him to be court-martialed with Uuno as his defense attorney.

It was made up from several previous bus operators including North Western (in Merseyside, Cheshire and Lancashire), most of MTL North (formerly Merseybus), the Bee Line Buzz Company (in Greater Manchester), and most of what was once Crosville Motor Services (in Cheshire and Wales). In January 2009, the Welsh depots were separated into a new division named Arriva Buses Wales, with the remainder of the division reverting to its previous title of Arriva North West. History From Autumn 1997, Cowie Group plc was renamed Arriva plc and like Stagecoach and FirstGroup a consistent corporate image was introduced for its many and different bus operations. Outside of London this was a corporate livery of aquamarine with a Cotswold stone (cream) swoop, Arriva branding and a strap- line of the region the bus was operating in. For the former North Western operation this strap-line was serving the North West. In Spring 1998 Arriva decided to give an Arriva identity to the many companies which comprised Arriva Passenger Services and as a consequence North Western Road Car Co. Ltd became Arriva North West Ltd with the associated Bee Line and Liverline operations becoming Arriva Manchester Ltd and Arriva Merseyside Ltd respectively.British Bus Publishing - \\"Arriva Bus Handbook 2008\\" History section. Apart from the adoption of the Arriva corporate identity, not too much was different between Arriva North West and North Western as the 1990s drew to a close. In late Summer 1998, Arriva North West (rather than GMPTE) became responsible for the management of the bus station at the new Trafford Centre shopping mall. In 1999 Arriva North West made its first major acquisition of Winsford based Nova Scotia Travel which allowed it to strengthen its operations from its Winsford depot considerably in and around the former Vale Royal borough of Cheshire. However the Nova Scotia acquisition would soon prove a minor event for Arriva North West's future development which significantly changed as a consequence of the impending bankruptcy and sale of Merseyside's largest bus operator MTL Trust Holdings. Acquisition of MTL Trust Holdings Ltd On 18 February 2000 Arriva plc acquired Merseyside's largest bus operator MTL Trust Holdings Ltd. The former Merseybus operation and the many companies which were acquired or created by MTL were amalgamated by Arriva North West into a 'new' Arriva Merseyside Ltd with the former Arriva Merseyside Ltd (Liverline) becoming Arriva Liverpool Ltd. As a consequence of Arriva's acquisition of MTL, the management of the Arriva North West depot at Winsford was transferred to Arriva Midlands North. Arriva's acquisition of MTL significantly increased its presence within Merseyside's bus market with the effect that Aintree based CMT Buses remained its only meaningful competitor. This concerned the Competition Commission who ordered Arriva North West to sell one of its depots in order to avoid a public inquiry over its purchase of MTL. Gillmoss depot in north Liverpool was the depot chosen to be sold, although its sale became a rather protracted affair. In early 2001 the Go- Ahead Group seemed ready to purchase Gillmoss, considering it to have similar characteristics to its Go North East operation. However, at the 11th hour, this deal broke down and instead Go Ahead acquired Arriva Croydon & North Surrey Ltd merging it into its established Metrobus operation. Arriva North West put a proposal to the Competition Commission for substantial investment in Gillmoss if the Commission withdrew its stipulation that Arriva had to sell the depot. However the Competition Commission did not accept this proposal and a buyer for Gillmoss had to be found. Gillmoss was eventually purchased on 15 July 2001 by two former MTL managers - Dominic Brady and Ian Campbell who formed Glenvale Transport (GT). Furthermore, the Competition Commission stipulated Arriva North West couldn't compete with GT's core service network in North Liverpool and Kirkby for three years. GT began expanding its service network against Arriva North West and in June 2003 acquired CMT Buses, further strengthening its position in Liverpool, in particular. By 2004 the Competition Commission ban against Arriva North West competing with GT was over and gradually copycat services were introduced on most of GT's routes. GT, ¬£7 million in debt and with an aging bus fleet, was taken over on 11 July 2005 by the Stagecoach Group who renamed it Stagecoach Merseyside. Relations between Arriva and Stagecoach on Merseyside seem reasonably cordial and from 2005 both operators gradually withdrew most of the competing services against each other leaving Stagecoach to become the main operator in North Liverpool and Kirkby and Arriva North West & Wales the dominant operator in most of the rest of Merseyside. Further developments and acquisitions Arriva North West became responsible for the management of Arriva Cymru Ltd from 25 February 2002, and to reflect this, the name for this division of Arriva became Arriva North West and Wales. Arriva North West and Wales expanded further when the Crewe, Macclesfield and Winsford depots of Arriva Midlands North Ltd were transferred to it on 1 February 2003 and this has enabled Arriva North West and Wales to assume control of much of what was Crosville Motor Services with the exception of the Rock Ferry - Birkenhead, Chester and Ellesmere Port (now closed) depots which are part of First Chester & The Wirral. Arriva North West has also pursued acquisitions and on 2 August 2004 Liverpool based independent Merseyline Travel of Garston was acquired, perhaps to strengthen Arriva Merseyside's competitive moves against GT before it was acquired by Stagecoach. In Greater Manchester it acquired one of the major independent operators in that region Blue Bus of Bolton enabling a good strategic fit with the Arriva Manchester operation and expansion into Bolton, Salford and Wigan. Some of the operations of KMP of Llanberis were acquired by Arriva in August 2008 and merged with Arriva Cymru. This removed competition along the route between Llandudno and Bangor. The rest of KMP was acquired by independent Padarn Bus in April 2009. From 1 January 2009, the Wales operations were split from Arriva North West and became Arriva Buses Wales with a separate Managing Director. From 23 July 2011, Skelmersdale Depot was closed down, losing 19 jobs. All services (apart from service 313 Skem-Wigan) transferred to the other depots.

Discrimination  A widely reported case in 2008 concerned a gothic couple, Dani Graves and his fianc√©e Tasha Maltby, who wears a dog collar and lead. A driver had refused them travel and made comments to them, allegedly saying \\"We don't let freaks and dogs like you on.\\" The company confirmed the couple were refused travel on two occasions due to \\"fears for passenger safety\\". In a statement the company addressed the issue, claiming that the dog lead was potentially dangerous. Arriva also said they would be writing to Mr Graves \\"to apologise for any distress caused by the way this matter was handled\\". In January 2017, a wheelchair user was denied access to a Arriva Yorkshire bus by the driver, because a pushchair was occupying the wheelchair space. The incident occurred days after the Supreme Court ruled that drivers should prioritise the space for wheelchair users.  Fleet  the fleet consisted of 334 buses.

She selected watercolor for this genre for technical reasons. Much of her work from that period consisted of creations, which were hardly bigger than a large postage stamp. To paint such tiny pictures, she used a magnifying glass and a brush, which consisted of three hairs. Today her works are larger, around 5\\" by 3.5\\" or smaller in size, but still classifiable as miniatures. Magda Szabo uses a special varnish to coat the surfaces of her paintings.

He was the first person to open teachings and spread the art of Liuhebafa in public, and was a prominent fighter and instructor who influenced many of the masters of his generation.  Biography  Wu Yihui was originally from Tieling in northeast China, but later lived in Beijing. He was from a scholarly and official family, and a man of good nature who had strong martial art talents. He was also well versed in calligraphy and painting, enjoying social life and travel. Wu Yihui was born on November 30, 1887. In 1896, began private studies in Henan's Kaifeng. In 1900, began learning Liuhebafa. The following year, he entered school in Beijing to continue his studies. That year, he was formally apprenticed to Liuhebafa masters Yan Guoxing and Chen Guangdi. In 1903, he entered the Beiyang Military School to prepare the first phase. He graduated from Baoding Military Academy in 1907 and was dispatched to the Beiyang Army, where he was appointed to staff officer of the first division. In 1915, he worked in the division of inventory of government industry in Beijing. He became a director of administration and taught literature in a middle school in Kaifeng in 1921. He worked as a teacher and an officer at South Senior High School in Shanghai in 1928, and the following year he was appointed to the Shanghai Xuhui College teaching literature and martial arts. In 1932, he became the martial arts instructor at the Shanghai Youth Association teaching Liuhebafa. In 1935, he attended the first martial arts examination. He was appointed to head of education of the Central Martial Arts Academy by General Zhang Zhijiang in 1936, and in the same year attended the second martial arts examination. The next year, when the Japanese war began, he moved with the Central Martial Arts Academy first to Vietnam's Burma, later settling in Yunnan's Kunming. In 1944, he was appointed commissioner of the natural resources committee, as well as the chief of the factory's military security brigade. He taught Liuhebafa in Shanghai in 1945. In 1947, he was appointed head of the natural resources committee of the Tianjin Iron and Steel Factory, as well as the machine factory manager. He became an associate instructor at the National Martial Arts Instructor Training Institute in 1949. He also became the chairman of the martial arts assembly. In 1951, he taught Liuhebafa to the workers' union club of the Shanghai Electricity Company. In 1957, he was appointed by Mayor Chen Yi to the Shanghai Literature and History Institute as the first librarian. Wu Yihui died on March 29, 1958 at his home in Shanghai. *Note: As a Chinese custom, some add 3 years onto the age of the departed to show longevity. It is for this reason that some records incorrectly show that Wu died in 1961, even though his family confirmed that it was indeed 1958. Wang Xiangzhai, the creator of Yiquan, made a public statement regarding Wu Yihui in 1928 saying, \\"I have traveled across the country in research, engaging over a thousand people in martial combat, there have been only 2.5 people I could not defeat, namely Hunan's Xie Tiefu, Fujian's Fang Yizhuang and Shanghai's Wu Yihui.\\" Wang Xiangzhai and Wu Yihui were known to be close friends. When Wu started teaching Liuhebafa Wang instructed 4 of his students to study under Wu. They were: Han Xingqiao, Zhang Changxin, Zhao Daoxin, and Gao Zhen Dong. These 4 students later became known as the \\"4 Diamond Warriors\\" of Yiquan.

Belgica and it registered to the Belgian Football Association in 1910 to receive the matricule n¬∞375. Between 1914 and 1924 the football team from this sports club was not active. At its come-back the club changed its name to Belgica F.C. Edegem. In 1930 Belgica played its first season in the second division. In its third season at that level, the club won its league and thus played in the first division from 1933, finishing 12th on 14. The next season the club was 14th and then played in the second division until World War II. The club had meanwhile changed its name in 1936 to K.F.C. Belgica Edegem. After World War II, the club played at lower levels in the Belgian football league system. It merged with K.V.V. Edegem Sport in 1967 to become K.V.V. Belgica Edegem Sport.

A Form-Based Code (FBC) is a means of regulating land development to achieve a specific urban form. Form-Based Codes foster predictable built results and a high-quality public realm by using physical form (rather than separation of uses) as the organizing principle, with a lesser focus on land use, through municipal regulations. A FBC is a regulation, not a mere guideline, adopted into city, town, or county law and offers a powerful alternative to conventional zoning regulation. Form-Based Codes are a new response to the modern challenges of urban sprawl, deterioration of historic neighborhoods, and neglect of pedestrian safety in new development. Tradition has declined as a guide to development patterns, and the widespread adoption by cities of single-use zoning regulations has discouraged compact, walkable urbanism. Form-Based Codes are a tool to address these deficiencies, and to provide local governments the regulatory means to achieve development objectives with greater certainty. Scope Form-Based Codes address the relationship between building facades and the public realm, the form and mass of buildings in relation to one another, and the scale and types of streets and blocks. The regulations and standards in Form-Based Codes, presented in both diagrams and words, are keyed to a regulating plan that designates the appropriate form and scale (and therefore, character) of development rather than only distinctions in land-use types. This is in contrast to conventional zoning's focus on the micromanagement and segregation of land uses, and the control of development intensity through abstract and uncoordinated parameters (e.g., floor area ratios, dwelling units per acre, setbacks, parking ratios) to the neglect of an integrated built form. Not to be confused with design guidelines or general statements of policy, form-based codes are regulatory, not advisory. Form- Based Codes are drafted to achieve a community vision based on time-tested forms of urbanism. Ultimately, a Form-Based Code is a tool; the quality of development outcomes is dependent on the quality and objectives of the community plan that a code implements.  History  Form-Based Codes are part of a long history of shaping the built landscape. Such efforts go back to the urban designs of Hippodamus of Miletus, the planning of cities in ancient China, and Roman town planning. The Laws of the Indies, promulgated by the Spanish Crown starting in the 16th century, established some basic urban form requirements for colonial towns in the Americas. William Penn when planning Philadelphia in the 17th century did not shy from precise urban form requirements when he said, \\"Let every house be in a line, or upon a line, as much as may be.\\" During the 18th century, Baroque urban design commonly brought buildings to the fronts of their lots with common facade treatments. Baron Haussmann, appointed by Napoleon III to oversee the redevelopment of Paris in the 19th century, stipulated precise ratios of building heights to street widths; disposition and sizes of windows and doors on building facades; consistent planting of street trees; and standardization of material colors to bring unity and harmony to the public environment. =Emergence= Regulating urban form is a challenge in modern democracies. Design guidelines adopted by municipalities, without legal enforceability, often invite capricious observance, thus failing to produce the comprehensive changes required to produce satisfying public places. When public planning exercises fail to produce predictable results, citizens often rebel against any development. In addition, from early in the twentieth century to the present, attempts at regulating the built landscape have usually been done for reasons that neglect community form, that are more concerned with the uses of property and impacts of scale than the form that development takes. And a planning profession that in recent decades has focused on policy, neglecting design, encouraged an abstract intellectual response to problems that are largely physical in nature. The development of modern Form-Based Codes was started by architects, urban designers, and physical planners frustrated by the ineffectiveness of past criticisms of sprawl development and the failure of critics to propose realistic alternatives. These professionals, used to thinking physically about community problems, began the search for systematic physical solutions in the 1970s. Architect Christopher Alexander published A Pattern Language in 1977, a compendium of physical rules for designing humane buildings and places. Ian McHarg developed systematic mapping tools to encourage deliberate development patterns sensitive to local environmental conditions. Traditional Neighborhood Development ordinances were drafted beginning in the early 1990s as sets of development regulations to promote traditional neighborhood forms in new development projects. TND ordinances were typically adopted as an optional regulatory procedure that developers could request in place of conventional zoning. But their design regulations were not mapped to parcels or streets in advance, so lacked predictability of outcomes; TND ordinances proved to be an instructive effort, but showed few results. Meanwhile, the accelerating scale of worldwide urban growth and the rapid expansion of the extent of cities heightened the need for regulatory tools better equipped to deal with such growth. The first serious attempt at creating a modern form-based code was done in 1982 to guide the development of the Florida resort town of Seaside by the husband and wife design team of Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk. Realizing that designing an entire town would be an overwhelming task and would in the end lack the visual serendipity that only comes from myriad creative minds at work, they created a design code that established basic physical standards mapped to parcels, and then invited developers and architects to put their own distinctive stamp on their projects‚Äîbut operating within those standards. The Seaside Code proved very successful; the resulting development of the town of Seaside is widely recognized as one of the most important and appealing planning efforts of the post-World War II era. Duany/Plater-Zyberk's codes and the work of subsequent form-based code practitioners are not top-down mandates from imperial designers as in the baroque era or the wishful thinking of design guidelines that lack enforceability, but are instead legal regulations adopted by units of local government. As regulations they possess police power; violators of the regulations can be cited, and their invocation or retraction must go through a legislative process. As such, the community plays a more forceful role in shaping its physical future. Form-based codes produce more consistent and predictable patterns of development in relationship to the public realm than typically achieved through conventional zoning regulations. = Recent developments = Although the Seaside code was commissioned by a private developer, most current codes are commissioned by counties and municipalities. Since Seaside, the scale of Form-Based Coding projects has grown. Form-Based Coding can be applied at many scales, from a two-block main street to a county-wide region. An early Form-Based Code was adopted for downtown West Palm Beach in 1995. A significant code for a major urban arterial, the Columbia Pike in Arlington County, Virginia, was adopted in 2003 (Ferrell Madden Associates). A regional FBC was adopted in 2006 by St. Lucie County, Florida (Spikowski Associates, Dover-Kohl Partners). Duany/Plater-Zyberk has drafted a model FBC that is also a transect-based code that can be calibrated for local needs‚Äîthe SMARTCODE. Its first attempted customization was done for Vicksburg, Mississippi in 2001 (Mouzon & Greene). The lessons learned there led to the first California adoption of a citywide Form-Based Code for the City of Sonoma in March 2003 (Crawford Multari & Clark Associates, Moule & Polyzoides), followed on June 16, 2003, by the first SmartCode adopted in the U.S., for central Petaluma, California (Fisher and Hall Urban Design, Crawford Multari & Clark Associates). SmartCodes are now being calibrated for Miami, Florida and Hurricane Katrina ravaged communities in Mississippi and Louisiana, along with cities as diverse as Taos, NM, Michigan City, IN, Jamestown, RI, Lawrence, KS, New Castle, DE, and Bran, Romania. Planetary climate change that must be mitigated by changes in the human environment will no doubt be an inducement to form-based and transect-based coding in the future. The Cincinnati Form-Based Code adopted in 2013 is designed to be applied citywide in an incremental way, neighborhood by neighborhood. The code establishes transect zones and specifies standards for transects, building types, frontage types, walkable neighborhoods, and thoroughfares that can be adapted to each neighborhood. Beaufort County, South Carolina adopted one of the first multijurisdictional Form-Based Codes at the end of 2014: In 2010, the County, the City of Beaufort and the City of Port Royal came together to hire Opticos Design, Inc. in Berkeley, California to draft the code. Because of the growing number of consultants advertising themselves as capable of writing FBCs but with little or no training, in 2004 the non-profit Form-Based Codes Institute was organized to establish standards and teach best practices. In addition, SmartCode workshops are regularly scheduled by PlaceMakers.com, SmartCodePro.com, and SmartCodeLocal.com. In Spring 2014, a new graduate-level studio dedicated to Form-Based Coding was launched at California State Polytechnic University. ‚ÄúForm-Based Codes in the Context of Integrated Urbanism,‚Äù is one of the only full courses on the subject in the country. The course is taught by Tony Perez, Director of Form-Based Coding at Opticos Design; it is expected to be repeated for Spring 2015. Components Form- Based Codes commonly include the following elements: * Regulating Plan. A plan or map of the regulated area designating the locations where different building form standards apply, based on clear community intentions regarding the physical character of the area being coded. * Public Space Standards. Specifications for the elements within the public realm (e.g., sidewalks, travel lanes, on-street parking, street trees, street furniture, etc.). * Building Form Standards. Regulations controlling the configuration, features, and functions of buildings that define and shape the public realm. * Administration. A clearly defined application and project review process. * Definitions. A glossary to ensure the precise use of technical terms. At a minimum, a Form-Based Code, written to enable or preserve a specific urban form, consists of building form and public space standards keyed to a regulating plan. An urban design is the intention or goal, the form-based code is the regulatory tool to achieve it. Form-based codes also sometimes include: * Architectural Standards. Regulations controlling external architectural materials and quality. * Landscaping Standards. Regulations controlling landscape design and plant materials on private property as they impact public spaces (e.g. regulations about parking lot screening and shading, maintaining sight lines, insuring unobstructed pedestrian movements, etc.). * Signage Standards. Regulations controlling allowable signage sizes, materials, illumination, and placement. * Environmental Resource Standards. Regulations controlling issues such as storm water drainage and infiltration, development on slopes, tree protection, solar access, etc. * Annotation. Text and illustrations explaining the intentions of specific code provisions. = Building Form Standards = Building attributes that can be regulated in a Building Form Standard, in this case for a hypothetical street in a neighborhood center The types of buildings that make for a lively main street are different from the types of buildings that make for a quiet residential street. Building Form Standards are sets of enforceable design regulations for controlling building types and how they impact the public realm. These Standards are mapped to streets on a Regulating Plan. Building Form Standards can control such things as: the alignment of buildings to the street; how close buildings are to sidewalks; the visibility and accessibility of building entrances; minimum and maximum buildings heights; minimum or maximum lot frontage coverage; minimum and maximum amounts of window coverage on facades; physical elements required on buildings (e.g. stoops, porches, types of permitted balconies); and the general usage of floors (e.g. office, residential, or retail). These regulations are less concerned with architectural styles and designs than in how buildings shape public spaces. If a local government also wishes to regulate the quality of architecture‚Äîfor example to preserve the historic appearance of a neighborhood‚Äîthen Architectural Standards should be drafted in addition to Building Form Standards. = Public Space Standards = An example of a Public Space Standard for public streets from the SmartCode 9.0 Public Space Standards control the physical form of squares, parks, the public right-of-way of streets, and other public spaces. Public spaces are typically under the control of public works, parks, and highway departments. Streets, being the most common public spaces in a community, are the most frequently regulated. Public Space Standards for streets are typically described with dimensioned cross-sections and/or plan views showing travel lane widths, sidewalk widths, street tree and street lamp placement, locations of transit lanes, and the placement of architecture. Plan view diagrams may also be included showing spacing of street trees and lamps, and the radii of the curves of street corners. Identification How does one determine if a development regulation is a form-based code and a well-crafted one? Form-based codes generally receive affirmative answers to all of the following questions: * Is the code's focus primarily on regulating urban form and less on land use? * Is the code regulatory rather than advisory? * Does the code emphasize standards and parameters for form with predictable physical outcomes (build-to lines, frontage type requirements, etc.) rather than relying on numerical parameters (floor-area ratios, density, etc.) whose outcomes are impossible to predict? * Does the code require private buildings to shape public space through the use of building form standards with specific requirements for building placement? * Does the code promote and/or conserve an interconnected street network and pedestrian-scaled blocks? * Are regulations and standards keyed to specific locations on a regulating plan? * Are the diagrams in the code unambiguous, clearly labeled, and accurate in their presentation of spatial configurations? FBCI quiz  Implementation  How are form-based codes incorporated into a local government's development regulations? There are three basic ways: Mandatory codes. This is the most common adoption approach. It has the most regulatory \\"teeth\\"‚Äîcompliance is required. But it is the most ambitious of the approaches, making the new code a seamless part of, or a complete replacement for, the existing zoning ordinance. The form-based code can be adopted as a new zoning district or as an overlay district. Unique to California and a few other states with appropriate enabling legislation, form-based codes can be contained within a planning document called a \\"specific plan,\\" which can completely override the zoning ordinance for a given geographic area. Since it stands apart from the zoning ordinance, it can be more creative in its format, giving the coder greater freedom in designing for user-friendliness through page layout, diagrams, and illustrations. Also, the urban design plan and the implementing regulations are bundled together, greatly improving user comprehension. But since the specific plan is not securely integrated within the existing zoning ordinance, it may be more politically vulnerable to retraction. Example adopted codes: *Winter Springs Town Center District Code, Winter Springs, Florida *Farmers Branch Station Area Form-Based Code, Farmers Branch, Texas *Central Petaluma Specific Plan and SmartCode, Petaluma, California Optional (parallel) codes. An optional or parallel form-based code serves as an alternative to, but doesn't replace, a present zoning ordinance. Compliance is voluntary. The developer has the choice of complying with the form-based code or the zoning ordinance, but it must be one or the other. This approach makes sense when compliance with the zoning ordinance is so difficult and time-consuming that most development is stymied. Thus a developer has the option of following a form-based code that will streamline and simplify his development process. But, for a local government to maintain two different sets of development regulations for one area is added work which can be significant if the area is extensive. Also depending on the area being regulated, if some developers are choosing the form-based code and others nearby are not, the possibilities for integrated place-making can be compromised. Example codes: *Columbia Pike Form-Based Code, Arlington County, Virginia *Pike Road SmartCode, Pike Road, Alabama *Pass Christian SmartCode, Pass Christian, Mississippi Floating-zone codes. Floating zones are most often written to facilitate master-planned suburban communities and are called PUDs (planned unit developments). However, floating-zone codes are now being written as form-based codes to facilitate urban development. A floating-zone form-based code does not contain a regulating plan but includes instructions and standards for developers to follow when they prepare a regulating plan for their property (e.g. maximum block dimensions, street types, building types, open space accessibility, sidewalk widths.) This distinguishes floating-zone codes from the other two approaches‚Äìdevelopers rather than the local government create the regulating plans and the urban designs that they facilitate, but the local government sets the standards. Floating-zone codes allow local governments to establish urban form standards for development without incurring the expense of developing urban design and regulating plans. Developers are given the freedom, within clear parameters, to prepare regulating plans for their property that are likely to meet government approval. A developer submits his or her regulating plan for approval through the rezoning process. Upon rezoning, the floating zone replaces the prior zoning for that property and the regulating plan becomes binding. Example codes: *Miami-Dade County TND District, Miami-Dade County, Florida *Towns, Villages, Countryside Land Development Regulations, Saint Lucie County, Florida *Flowood SmartCode, Flowood, Mississippi *Montgomery SmartCode, Montgomery, Alabama (not to be confused with the mandatory SmartCode for downtown) Initially a local government may wish to adopt a form-based code for its entire jurisdiction following one approach, but find this too ambitious with short-term resource and political limitations requiring a more focused effort. Instead it may wish to follow one approach for a smaller area, and then phase in other areas using the same or different approaches as needed. Or a floating-zone code could be adopted for large areas awaiting the public resources coming later that would allow the local government to draft its own regulating plans. Whatever approach is followed‚Äîor combination of approaches‚Äîsimplicity and consistency helps at the permit desk where the code is implemented.

A Great Britain and England international representative , Cummins also played for Ireland at , and played his entire professional career with the Leeds Rhinos, with whom he won the 1999 Challenge Cup Final. Background Francis Cummins was born and grew up in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, England. was the captain of both St. John Fisher's school team (1988‚Äì93) which were regular finalists in the Yorkshire Cup, and St. John Fisher's ARLFC. St. John Fisher's school team has produced some notable English rugby league talents over the years including Francis Maloney, Ryan Sheridan, Matt Diskin, Adrian Flynn and Tommy Gallagher. His sporting heroes growing up were former Leeds star Garry Schofield, and ex-Manchester United, and England football captain, Bryan Robson. When playing at St. John Fisher, his preferred position was , and he was also the designated goal-kicker. Francis represented England schoolboys when he was 15 years old. =Professional playing career= Cummins played for Leeds throughout his whole career between 1993‚Äì2005. Cummins has also played on several occasions for Great Britain, and also Ireland at international level. He is the youngest player ever to appear in a Rugby League Challenge Cup at Wembley Stadium, London. He was aged just 17 years and 200 days when Leeds lost to Wigan in 1994, although Francis did score a memorable length-of-the-field try during the match. Francis made his d√©but for England in 1995 against France at Gateshead when he scored a hat-trick of tries, he then played for Emerging England in 1998 against Wales. He made his Great Britain d√©but later that year playing in the last two Tests against New Zealand. Cummins played for Leeds Rhinos as a in their 1998 Super League Grand Final loss to the Wigan Warriors. In 1999 he gained two more caps for Great Britain in the Tri-Series against Australia and New Zealand. Unfortunately, injury struck in 2000 and Francis made the tough decision to pull out of that year's World Cup. He was later to rate this as the worst moment of his career. In 2000 Francis Cummins married Katy and has three children. 2001 saw Francis revert to playing for Ireland, making his d√©but in France. He continued this in 2003 when he played as a in both matches for Ireland in the European Nations Cup. Francis set a new club record for consecutive appearances for Leeds Rhinos at the end of the 2003's Super League VIII with a total of 178 appearances. He is the seventh highest try scorer in the history of the club with total of 188 tries at the end of 2004, making him the most prolific try scorer in the past twenty years of the club. Francis Cummins' Testimonial match at Leeds Rhinos took place in 2004. =Post playing= Following his retirement from playing for the Leeds Rhinos in 2005, Cummins subsequently continued the 12 year association when he became assistant coach at the Leeds Rhinos in 2006. In 2010 Francis decided to leave Leeds Rhinos and take the opportunity as the assistant coach at West Yorkshire rivals, the Bradford Bulls for the upcoming season. After a two-year period as assistant coach to Mick Potter, Cummins was appointed as head coach of the Bradford Bulls in September 2012. He was sacked on 16 July 2014.

There is some confusion in dating Bagrat's death. According to the 11th-century chronicler Sumbat Davitis-Dze, Bagrat died on April 20, Easter Sunday of the year 129 of the Georgian era (i.e., 909). However, Easter Sunday in 909 fell on April 16; the year that would coincidence with the given date would be 900.Toumanoff, Cyril (1961), \\"The Bagaratides of Iberia from the Eighth to the Eleventh Century\\". Le Mus√©on 74: Bagrat was a younger son of Sumbat I, founder of the Klarjeti line of the Bagratids. Upon Sumbat‚Äôs death in 889, he succeeded his father as prince of Klarjeti, while his elder brother (and likely a legitimate successor to Sumbat), David, appear as a ruler of some less important territory north of Klarjeti ‚Äì Adjara and Nigali. Like Sumbat, Bagrat had the epithet of Artanujeli (\\"of Artanuji\\") and ruled with the title of mampali, having a thriving commercial town of Artanuji as his residence. In 891, he became involved in the dynastic feud among the Bagratids and helped Adarnase IV to defeat Gurgen I. On Bagrat's death Artanuji seems to have been retrieved by his brother David, while the rest of his territory was further divided between his four sons, who soon started quarrelling amongst themselves. Bagrat had four sons: *Prince Adarnase II *Prince Gurgen I *Prince Ashot *Prince David, died in 922 According to Constantine Porphyrogenitus's De Administrando Imperio Bagrat also had a daughter who was married to her relative Sumbat II of Klarjeti.

It has a long history in reference to Chinese martial arts. It was developed in 1949 in an effort to standardize the practice of traditional Chinese martial arts, yet attempts to structure the various decentralized martial arts traditions date back earlier, when the Central Guoshu Institute was established at Nanking in 1928. \\"Wushu\\" is the Chinese term for \\"martial arts\\" (Ê≠¶ \\"Wu\\" = military or martial, Ë°ì \\"Shu\\" = art). In contemporary times, Wushu has become an international sport through the International Wushu Federation (IWUF), which holds the World Wushu Championships every two years; the first World Championships were held in 1991 in Beijing. The World Kungfu Championships are held every four years subset International Wushu Federation, as well. Competitive Wushu is composed of two disciplines: taolu (Â•óË∑Ø; forms) and sanda (Êï£Êâì; sparring). But it has other disciplines, like self defense, breaking hard objects, and other related practices, that are not performed in competitions. Taolu involves martial art patterns, acrobatic movements and techniques for which competitors are judged and given points according to specific rules. The forms comprise basic movements (stances, kicks, punches, balances, jumps, sweeps, and throws) based on aggregate categories of traditional Chinese martial art styles, and can be changed for competitions to highlight one's strengths. Competitive forms have time limits that can range from 1 minute, 20 seconds for some external styles, to over five minutes for internal styles. Sanda (sometimes called sanshou) is a modern fighting method and a full contact sport. Sanda contains boxing, kicks (kickboxing), and wrestling. It has all the combat aspects of wushu. Sanda appears much like kickboxing, boxing or Muay Thai, but includes many more grappling techniques. Sanda fighting competitions are often held alongside taolu. History In 1958, the government established the umbrella organization to regulate martial arts training. The Chinese State Commission for Physical Culture and Sports took the lead in creating standardized forms for most of the major arts. During this period, a national Wushu system that included standard forms, teaching curriculum, and instructor grading was established. Wushu was introduced at both the high school and university level. This new system seeks to incorporate common elements from all styles and forms as well as the general ideas associated with Chinese martial arts. Stylistic concepts such as hard, soft, internal, external, as well as classifications based on schools such as Shaolin, Taiji, Wudang and others were all integrated into one system. Wushu became the government sponsored standard for the training in martial arts in China. The push for standardization continued leading to widespread adaptation. In 1979, the State Commission for Physical Culture and Sports created a special task force to teaching and practice of Wushu. In 1986, the Chinese National Research Institute of Wushu was established as the central authority for the research and administration of Wushu activities in China.Wu Bin, Li xingdong and Yu Gongbao(1992), \\"Essentials of Chinese Wushu\\", Foreign Language Press, Beijing, Changing government policies and attitudes towards sports in general led to the closing of the State Sports Commission (the central sports authority) in 1998. This closure is viewed as an attempt to partially de-politicize organized sports and move Chinese sport policies towards a more market-driven approach. p.15 As a result of these changing sociological factors within China, both traditional styles and modern Wushu approaches are being promoted by the International Wushu Federation., archived from the original on 2007-06-14. Contemporary taolu events A Jian dual event (choreographed) Wushu events are performed using compulsory or individual routines in competition. Compulsory routines are those routines that have been already created for the athlete, resulting in each athlete performing basically the same set. Individual routines are routines that an athlete creates with the aid of his/her coach, while following certain rules for difficulty. In addition to events for individual routines, some wushu competitions also feature dual and group events. The dual event, also called duilian (ÂØπÁªÉ), is an event in which there is some form of sparring with weapons, or without weapons or even using bare hands against weapons. The dual event is usually spectacular and actions are choreographed beforehand. The group event, also known as jiti (ÈõÜÈ´î), requires a group of people to perform together and smooth synchronization of actions are crucial. Usually, the group event also allows instrumental music to accompany the choreography during the performance. The carpet used for the group event is also larger than the one used for individual routines. Previously, international wushu competitions most often used compulsory routines, while high-level competitions in China most often used individual routines. However, after the 2003 Wushu World Games in Macau it was decided to opt for individual routines in international competition with nandu (Èõ£Â∫¶; difficulty movements) integrating a maximum 2-point nandu score into the overall maximum score of 10. This was decided as part of the major taolu rules for competition revision by the IWUF which also standardized deduction content. There is some controversy concerning the inclusion of nandu in wushu because many of the movements created for the specific events are not originally movements used in those styles. In addition the number of injuries which have resulted from the inclusion of these nandu have caused many people to question their inclusion. Those who support the new difficulty requirements follow the assertion that they help to progress the sport and improve the overall physical quality of the athletes. The 2003 rules revision has also helped standardize taolu judging effectively, in an attempt to have it regulated similarly to the olympic sports of gymnastics or skating. =Barehanded= Ch√°ngqu√°n (Èï∑Êã≥ or Long Fist) refers to long-range extended wushu styles like ChƒÅqu√°n (Êü•Êã≥), Huaquan (ËèØÊã≥), Hongquan (Ê¥™Êã≥; \\"flood fist\\"), and Shaolinquan (Â∞ëÊûóÊã≥), but this wushu form is a modernized style derived from movements of these and other traditional styles. Changquan is the most widely seen of the wushu forms, and includes speed, power, accuracy, and flexibility. Changquan is difficult to perform, requiring great flexibility and athleticism, and is often practiced from a young age. Nanquan (ÂçóÊã≥ or Southern Fist) refers to wushu styles originating in south China (i.e., south of the Yangtze River, including Hongjiaquan (Hung Gar) (Ê¥™ÂÆ∂Êã≥), Cailifoquan (Choy Li Fut) (Ëî°Êùé‰ΩõÊã≥), and Yongchunquan (Wing Chun) (Ë©†Êò•Êã≥). Many are known for vigorous, athletic movements with very stable, low stances and intricate hand movements. This wushu form is a modern style derived from movements of these and other traditional southern styles. Nanquan typically requires less flexibility and has fewer acrobatics than Changquan, but it also requires greater leg stability and power generation through leg and hip coordination. This event was created in 1960. Taijiquan (Â§™Ê•µÊã≥, T'ai Chi Ch'uan) is a wushu style mistakenly famous for slow, relaxed movements, often seen as an exercise method for the elderly, and sometimes known as \\"T'ai chi\\" in Western countries to those otherwise unfamiliar with wushu. This wushu form (42 form) is a modern recompilation based on the Yang (Ê•ä) style of Taijiquan, but also including movements of the Chen (Èô≥), Wu (Âê≥), Wu (Ê≠¶), and Sun (Â≠´) styles. Competitive contemporary taiji is distinct from the traditional first form for styles it draws from, in that it typically involves difficult holds, balances, jumps and jump kicks. Modern competitive taiji requires good balance, flexibility and strength. The traditional second forms however like cannon fist, are more difficult than the modern forms, but are less known and usually taught to advanced students. =Short weapons= A dao Dao (ÂàÄ or broadsword) refers to any curved, one-sided sword/blade, but this wushu form is a Changquan method of using a medium-sized willow-leaf-shaped dao (Êü≥ËëâÂàÄ). Nandao (ÂçóÂàÄ or Southern Style broadsword) refers to a form performed with a curved, one sided sword/blade based on the techniques of Nanquan. The weapon and techniques appears to be based on the butterfly swords of Yongchunquan, a well known Southern style. In the Wushu form, the blade has been lengthened and changed so that only one is used (as opposed to a pair). This event was created in 1992. Jian (Âäç or sword) refers to any double-edged straight sword/blade, but this wushu form is a Changquan method of using the jian. Taijijian (Â§™Ê•µÂäç or Taiji sword) is an event using the jian based on traditional Taijiquan jian methods. =Long weapons= Gun (Ê£ç or cudgel) refers to a long staff (shaped from white wax wood) as tall as the person standing upright, but this wushu form is a Changquan method of using the white wax wood staff. Nangun (ÂçóÊ£ç or Southern cudgel) is a Nanquan method of using the staff. This event was created in 1992. A Nangun should be as tall as a person holding a fist above his head. There are several basic steps and techniques that must be included in an Optional Southern cudgel event. The basic steps are bow stance, empty stance, dragon riding stance (ÂºìÊ≠•„ÄÅËôõÊ≠•„ÄÅÈ®éÈæçÊ≠•). The basic techniques in Southern Cudgel are cleft stick, collapse stick, twisted stick, roll press stick, defend stick, hit stick, uphold stick, throw stick (ÂäàÊ£ç„ÄÅÂ¥©Ê£ç„ÄÅÁµûÊ£ç„ÄÅÊªæÂ£ìÊ£ç„ÄÅÊ†º Ê£ç„ÄÅÊìäÊ£ç„ÄÅÈ†ÇÊ£ç„ÄÅÊããÊ£ç). Qiang (Êßç or spear) refers to a flexible spear with red horse hair attached to the spearhead, but this wushu form is a Changquan method of using the qiang. Other taolu routines The majority of routines used in the sport are new, modernized recompilations of traditional routines. However, routines taken directly from traditional styles, including the styles that are not part of standard events, may be performed in competition, especially in China. These routines generally do not garner as many points as their modern counterparts, and are performed in events separate from the compulsory routine events. Among these, the more commonly seen routines include: *Baguazhang (ÂÖ´Âç¶Êéå) ‚Äì Eight-Trigrams Palm *Bajiquan (ÂÖ´Ê•µÊã≥/ÂÖ´ÊûÅÊã≥) ‚Äì Eight Extremes Fist/Boxing *ChƒÅqu√°n (Êü•Êã≥) ‚Äì Cha Fist/Boxing *Chu≈çji«éo (Êà≥ËÖ≥/Êà≥ËÑö) ‚Äì Poking Feet *Ditangquan (Âú∞Ë∫∫Êã≥) ‚Äì Ground-Prone Fist/Boxing *FƒÅnziqu√°n (ÁøªÂ≠êÊã≥) ‚Äì Tumbling Fist/Boxing *Houquan (Áå¥Êã≥) ‚Äì Monkey Fist/Boxing *Huaquan (ËèØÊã≥/ÂçéÊã≥) ‚Äì Hua Fist/Boxing *Nanquan (ÂçóÊã≥) ‚Äì Southern Fist *P√†o Chu√≠ (ÁÇÆÊç∂) ‚Äì Cannon Punch *Piguaquan (ÂäàÊéõÊã≥) ‚Äì Chop- Hitch Fist/Boxing *Shequan (ËõáÊã≥) ‚Äì Snake Fist/Boxing *T√°n Tu«ê (ÂºπËÖø) ‚Äì Spring Kick *Tang Lang (Ëû≥ËûÇÊã≥) ‚Äì Praying Mantis Fist/Boxing *Tongbeiquan (ÈÄöËÉåÊã≥) ‚Äì Through-the-Back Fist/Boxing *Wing Chun (Ë©†Êò•Êã≥/ÂíèÊò•Êã≥) ‚Äì Eternal Spring *Xing Yi Quan (ÂΩ¢ÊÑèÊã≥) ‚Äì Shape-Intent Fist/Boxing *Ying Zhao Pai (È∑πÁà™Êã≥/Èπ∞Áà™Êã≥) ‚Äì Eagle Claw Fist/Boxing *Zui Quan (ÈÜâÊã≥) ‚Äì Drunken Fist/Boxing =Traditional weapons routines= There is also a traditional weapons category, which often includes the following: *Shuangshoujian (ÈõôÊâãÂäç/ÂèåÊâãÂâë) ‚Äì Two-Handed Sword *Jiujiebian (‰πùÁØÄÈû≠/‰πùËäÇÈû≠) ‚Äì Nine Section Whip *Sanjiegun (‰∏âÁØÄÊ£ç/‰∏âËäÇÊ£ç) ‚Äì Three Section Staff *Shengbiao (Áπ©Èè¢/Áª≥Èïñ) ‚Äì Rope Dart *Dadao (Â§ßÂàÄ) ‚Äì Great Sword *Pudao (Êí≤ÂàÄ/ÊâëÂàÄ) ‚Äì Horse Knife *Emeici (Â≥®ÂµãÂà∫) ‚Äì Emei Daggers *Shuangdao (ÈõôÂàÄ/ÂèåÂàÄ) ‚Äì Double Broadsword *Shuanggou (ÈõôÈàé/ÂèåÈí©) ‚Äì Double Hook-sword Sanda (sparring) The other major discipline of contemporary Chinese Wushu is Êï£Êâì S«énd«é, or ËøêÂä®Êï£Êâì (Y√πnd√≤ng S«énd«é, Sport Free-Fighting), or Á´û‰∫âÊï£Êâì (J√¨ngzhƒìng S√†nd«é, Competitive Free-Fighting) meaning: A modern fighting method, sport, and applicable component of Wushu / Kung Fu influenced by traditional Chinese boxing, of which takedowns and throws are legal in competition, as well as all other sorts of striking (use of arms and legs). Chinese wrestling methods called Shuai Jiao and other Chinese grappling techniques such as Chin Na. It has all the combat aspects of wushu. Sanda appears much like Kickboxing or Muay Thai, but includes many more grappling techniques. Sanda fighting competitions are often held alongside taolu or form competitions. Sanda represents the modern development of Lei Tai contests, but with rules in place to reduce the chance of serious injury. Many Chinese martial art schools teach or work within the rule sets of Sanda, working to incorporate the movements, characteristics, and theory of their style. Chinese martial artists also compete in non-Chinese or mixed combat sports, including boxing, kickboxing and Mixed Martial Arts. Sanda is practiced in tournaments and is normally held alongside taolu events in wushu competition. For safety reasons, some techniques from the self- defense form such as elbow strikes, chokes, and joint locks, are not allowed during tournaments. Competitors can win by knockout or points which are earned by landing strikes to the body or head, throwing an opponent, or when competition is held on a raised lei tai platform, pushing them off the platform. Fighters are only allowed to clinch for a few seconds. If the clinch is not broken by the fighters, and if neither succeeds in throwing his opponent within the time limit, the referee will break the clinch. In the U.S., competitions are held either in boxing rings or on the raised lei tai platform. Amateur fighters wear protective gear. \\"Amateur Sanda\\" allows kicks, punches and throws. A competition held in China, called the \\"King of Sanda\\", is held in a ring similar to a boxing ring in design but larger in dimension. As professionals, they wear no protective gear except for gloves, cup, and mouthpiece, and \\"Professional Sanda\\" allows knee and elbow strikes (including to the head) as well as kicking, punching and throwing. Some Sanda fighters have participated in fighting tournaments such as K-1, Muay Thai, boxing and Shoot Boxing. They have had some degree of success, especially in Shoot Boxing competitions, which is more similar to Sanda. Due to the rules of kickboxing competition, Sanda fighters are subjected to more limitations than usual. Also notable competitors in China's mainstream Mixed Martial Arts competitions, Art of War Fighting Championship and Ranik Ultimate Fighting Federation are dominantly of wushu background. Sanda has been featured in many style-versus- style competitions. Muay Thai is frequently pitted against Sanda as is karate, kickboxing, and Tae Kwon Do. Although it is less common, some Sanda practitioners have also fought in the publicly viewed American Mixed Martial Arts competitions. Competitions Major international and regional competitions featuring wushu include: * World Wushu Championships * World Junior Wushu Championships * World Games * World Combat Games * Asian Games * East Asian Games * European Wushu Championships * National Games of China * South Asian Games * Southeast Asian Games * Mediterranean Games * Lusofonia Games Wushu is not a Summer Olympic sport; the IWUF has repeatedly backed proposals for Wushu to be added to the Olympic programme, most recently as one of eight sports proposed for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. However, it failed to reach the final shortlist, and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) ultimately voted for the re-inclusion of wrestling instead. Wushu was formally introduced into the Olympics as an exhibition sport in Berlin, in 1936, under Chancellor Hitler's request. In March 2015, IWUF executive vice president Anthony Goh stated that the Federation was planning to propose Wushu again for the 2024 Summer Olympics. As part of new IOC rules allowing host committees to accept proposals for new sports to be added to the programme (allowing the addition of sports of local interest to the Olympic programme under an \\"event-based\\" model), in June 2015, Wushu was shortlisted again as part of eight sports proposed for inclusion in the 2020 Games in this manner. However, it did not make the final shortlist of five. On 8 January 2020, it was announced by the IOC that Wushu will be added to the 2022 Summer Youth Olympics.https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/stories/news/detail/dakar-2022-baseball5-wushu- new-sports/ Owing to its cultural significance in China, the IOC allowed the organizers of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing to hold a Wushu tournament in parallel with the Games as a separate event‚Äîthe first time that the IOC has allowed such an event. =Notable practitioners= * Wu Bin (Âê≥ÂΩ¨/Âê¥ÂΩ¨) ‚Äì Jet Li's coach in the Beijing Wushu Team, training more wushu champions than any other coach in China. * Jet Li (ÊùéÈÄ£Êù∞/ÊùéËøûÊù∞) ‚Äì possibly the most famous wushu practitioner in the world.

A demo and shareware version of the game entitled The Dungeon of Doom were released in 1986 and 1987 respectively to promote the game. Both were released for Mac OS, and were compatible with versions as late as System 7. Objective The player controls a single character trapped in an underground dungeon. If the character attempts to take the stairs from the dungeon, a message appears: \\"A force prevents you from escaping to the surface. Maybe the Orb will set you free...\\" Like this message, much of the game's story and mechanics are vague or undocumented. Most of the player's information comes from a window called Rumors, which contains 26 short, cryptic statements. The dungeon is divided into 40 floors, each with one staircase going up and one going down. The floor plan of each level is randomly generated, but remains unchanged throughout a single game. Though each level is about the same size, the complexity of the floor plans becomes more maze-like as the character descends to deeper dungeon levels. There are also items, including weapons, armor, magical rings, scrolls, potions, wands, food items, and jewels placed randomly throughout the dungeon's floors. Progress through the dungeon is hindered by monsters who, depending on the circumstances, have varying levels of hostility towards the character. The character must also eat periodically to avoid starvation. The monsters become more powerful and resistant to attack as the player progresses deeper into the dungeon. Characters Screenshot from The Dungeon Revealed The player begins the game by creating a new character from one of seven classes: knight, fighter, sage, wizard, alchemist, jeweler, and jones. Each class has a different set of attributes, parameterized similarly to Dungeons & Dragons, although the physical classes of knight and fighter are best as players will constantly have to fight to stay alive, whereas the ability to assess a potion, scroll, ring etc. is not especially useful and the nature of multiple items can be discovered using the very common identify scroll. Each attribute affects the character's abilities in a number of ways, many of which are undocumented. Characters with a high intelligence attribute, for example, have a higher probability of success when casting magic spells from a scroll, as well as an improved ability to map the dungeon. In addition, each class has an increased likelihood of being able to identify a certain type of item. Characters can improve their ability scores throughout the game, both temporarily and permanently, through the use of potions and scrolls. Each class, with the exception of \\"Jones\\", also has the unique ability to assess one type of object. Alchemists, for example, can accurately identify the potions they find in the dungeon, and therefore avoid drinking those with harmful effects, wizards wield wands more effectively, and so forth. All classes can reach the highest levels in each ability by obtaining a variety of scrolls and potions that raise strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution, and charisma. Strength controls a character's ability to attack, intelligence and wisdom, the ability to read and understand scrolls successfully, dexterity, the ability to wield weapons and throw objects, constitution the ability to withstand attack, and charisma, the ability to increase the odds a defeated monster will leave behind a useful item. The main objective of the game is to retrieve the orb of Carnos, located on the 40th level and guarded by a powerful boss monster called \\"The Dark Wizard\\", who can be beaten relatively easily by standing in the staircase, reflecting all spell attacks. The 40th level also contains a second orb, made of plastic, which can only be identified using an \\"identify scroll\\". Reception Macworld named The Dungeon of Doom the \\"Best Implementation of Rogue and 2-D Maze Game\\" as part of its Shareware and Public Domain Game Awards in 1987.

Early life Born in Beaumont, Texas, Binaggio moved with his family to Kansas City, Missouri, at an early age. Binaggio grew up in the city's North Side, which was then heavily populated by Sicilian and Italian immigrants. It isn't known when first Binaggio fell in with the mob; when he did join them, he rose quietly to prominence. In December 1930, in Denver, Colorado, Binaggio was arrested for the first time at age 21. The police raided a Denver apartment that Binaggio shared with Anthony Gizzo and Tony Casciola, two well- known Kansas City Mafiosi. Searching the apartment, police found a mini-cache of firearms and charged the three with weapons violations. The charges were later reduced to vagrancy and Binaggio was released on bond. As it turns out, Binaggio had been part of a team sent to Denver by then Kansas City boss John Lazia to aid the Denver crime family in a \\"war\\" with the crime family from Pueblo, Colorado. In 1931, Binaggio was again arrested in Denver for vagrancy. Binaggio earned his prominence in the Kansas City family by earning a lot of money from liquor and gambling. On July 20, 1931 Binaggio was arrested in Kansas City following a shootout that killed a Bureau of Prohibition agent and two others. Prohibition agents and local police had raided the mob-run Lusco- Noto Flower Shop at 1039 E. Independence Avenue looking for evidence in a recent \\"spot\\" killing. The building was also the headquarters of Joe Lusco, a lieutenant of Lazia. During the raid, a shootout started, followed by a fire. Binaggio, who was in the flower shop during the raid, was arrested and taken in for questioning. However, the police determined that he hadn't taken part in the shootout and released him with a vagrancy charge. Rise to power After the Lusco-Noto shootout, Lazia took Binaggio under his wing. Lazia had established a political club, the North Side Democratic Club, in order to increase his mob's power in Kansas City. This led to Binaggio's involvement with the local and State political scene that would last until his death in 1950. In 1934, Lazia was assassinated and his underboss Charles \\"Charley the Wop\\" Carrollo ascended to the crime throne. At some point, Binaggio became Carollo's underboss. In 1939, Carollo was caught up in a citywide clean-up campaign and was sent to prison for income tax evasion. This opened the way for Binaggio to become the Kansas City mob's boss in October 1939. The Kansas City crime family had always enjoyed a violent reputation. It started back to the turn of the 20th century when the Black Hand version of the Mafia terrorized the city's North Side. The violence had reached a peak during and immediately following the Lazia years (1928‚Äì1934), but things had remained relatively quiet under Carollo's rule. This would change under Binaggio as several unsolved mob slayings occurred on his watch. In November 1941, Binaggio was speeding down Broadway near his Armour Boulevard apartment when he struck and killed a 50-year-old man while crossing the street. Binaggio was arrested and charged with manslaughter, but a coroner's jury refused to indict him. Following this incident, Binaggio was always accompanied by his driver, Nick Penna. Binaggio and the local mob continued to get rich through their gambling and liquor interests. From the 1930s on, the mob had also been making money through a nationwide narcotics ring. However, this ring was broken up by a major Bureau of Narcotics investigation that netted mafiosi in Kansas City, St. Louis, Tampa, Florida, and other cities. Binaggio himself escaped being linked to this drug ring. However, one of his main lieutenants, Joe DeLuca, was sent to prison when a low-level member of the ring, Carl Caramusa, turned state's evidence. In 1945, Caramusa was found murdered on a Chicago street. Binaggio and the Pendergast Machine In the early 1940s, Binaggio turned his attention to politics. He formed his own political club, the First Ward Democratic Club and slowly began taking over wards in and near Kansas City's North Side. In the process, Binaggio became a major rival of Jim Pendergast, the nephew of former Kansas City political boss Tom Pendergast, and his Democratic faction. Binaggio's goal was to elect his candidate to the Missouri Governorship. In 1944, Binaggio's first candidate was defeated in the primary election by the Pendergast candidate. In 1948, Binaggio was more successful. He backed the Democratic nominee Forrest Smith and used his mob connections to help Smith win the election. Binaggio had approached the National Commission of La Cosa Nostra for a loan between $200,000 and $2,000,000 for Smith's election campaign. If he won, the payback would be Smith helping the mob open Missouri to gambling. Binaggio reportedly received the money at the home of Charles Fischetti, a major Chicago Mafioso. At that time, Kansas City was subservient to Chicago in the mob hierarchy. Using mob money and manpower, Binaggio managed to get Smith elected Governor. The 1948 election also brought President Harry Truman, a Missouri native, reelection to the White House. To celebrate this victory, Binaggio chartered a private railroad car for transportation to the inauguration ceremony in Washington, D.C. However, Truman was a staunch Pendergast supporter and he made it abundantly clear that Binaggio was not welcome at the ceremony. Doublecross Despite the election of Binaggio's candidate as government, his gambling plan was doomed to failure. Binaggio's strategy had been to take control over both the Kansas City and St. Louis police departments. Once that control was achieved, mob gambling operations would be safe in both cities. In the late 1930s, both departments had been taken over by the State due to mass corruption within the ranks. Both departments were ruled by separate Boards of Police Commissioners that were appointed by the Governor. By controlling the Governor, Binaggio hoped to get candidates of his choosing appointed to the Police Boards. With Smith's election, every part of the plan seemed in place. However, to Binaggio's chagrin, Smith pulled the rug out from under him. Smith made initial appointments to each Police Board, but refused to give a consensus to Binaggio's candidates. Binaggio was denied a majority on both boards. Unable to control the police forces in Kansas City or St. Louis, the syndicate was forced to fold up their new gambling establishments. The crime bosses in Chicago were not happy with the developments in Missouri and they blamed Binaggio for it. They warned Binaggio to fix it, or else. Binaggio desperately tried to bribe one of the Kansas City police commissioners and threatened others, but with no effect. At some point, the Commission decided to make Binaggio pay for his failure to deliver. The reward for failure On the night of April 5, 1950, Binaggio and his underboss, Charles \\"Mad Dog\\" Gargotta (a notorious enforcer within the Kansas City family), were called to meet some unknown persons at the First Ward Democratic Club near downtown Kansas City. Binaggio left his driver/bodyguard, Nick Penna, at the Last Chance saloon, at a tavern owned by the mob, saying that he would return in a few minutes. Binaggio and Gargotta then borrowed a car and drove off to the Democratic Club. Shortly after 8 P.M., residents in apartments above the Democratic Club heard several shots. Eight hours later, a cab driver going to a nearby cafe noticed that the club door was open; he also heard water running inside. The police were called and they found the bodies of Charles Binaggio and Charles Gargotta inside the club. Binaggio was seated at a desk and Gargotta was lying inside the front door. Both men had been shot in the head four times with separate .32 caliber revolvers. The police theorized that Gargotta had been trying to escape the club when he was shot in the back of the head. As for the running water heard by the cabbie, it came from a broken toilet and was unrelated to the hit. Some people theorized that Binaggio and Gargotta were murdered by St. Louis gunmen; others said the hitmen came from Chicago. However, it is most likely that the two mob bosses were killed by members of their own crime family under orders from the Mafia Commission in New York. The probable organizer of the hit was Gizzo, who no doubt received the leadership of the Kansas City family as a reward. In any case, the murderers were never found. Over 1,200 mourners attended Binaggio's funeral service at Holy Rosary Church and 10,000 people watched the funeral procession to the cemetery. Binaggio was buried in Mount Saint Mary's Cemetery in Kansas City, Missouri.

Seinemeyer was born in Berlin, where she studied at the Stern Conservatory with Ernst Grenzebach. She made her debut at the Deutsche Opernhaus in 1918. She joined the Dresden Semperoper in 1924, and began appearing at the Vienna State Opera in 1927. On the international scene, she sang at the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires, as Agathe in Der Freisch√ºtz, Sieglinde in Die Walk√ºre, Elisabeth in Tannh√§user and Eva in Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg in 1926, and at the Royal Opera House in London in 1929, as Eva, Elsa in Lohengrin and Sieglinde. Besides the great Wagner heroines, she also played an important role in the renaissance of Verdi's operas in Germany, winning considerable acclaim as Leonora in La forza del destino, Elisabeth de Valois in Don Carlos, and the title role in Aida. She was also admired as Marguerite in Faust, Maddalena in Andrea Ch√©nier, and the title role in Tosca. She took part in the creation of Ferruccio Busoni's Doktor Faust in Dresden in 1925. Her voice is notable for her flawless management of register breaks, resulting in a seamless stream of tone from top to bottom. The voice has a very rich, enveloping sound, discernable even despite the limitations of the extant acoustic recordings. In some of these she partners the tenor Tino Pattiera, with whom she often appeared on stage. One of the greatest German singers of her generation, her career was cut short when she died of leukemia in Dresden a few weeks short of her 34th birthday. Very shortly before her death, she married the conductor (1893‚Äì1984). She is buried in the Stahnsdorfer Friedhof close to Berlin.

He is said to have meditated motionless for a year in a standing posture (kayotsarga) and that during this time, climbing plants grew around his legs. After his a year of meditation, Bahubali is said to have attained omniscience (Kevala Gyana). Bahubali's other names are Kammateswara, Gommateshwara because of the Gommateshwara statue dedicated to him. The statue was built by the Ganga dynasty minister and commander Chavundaraya; it is a monolith (statue carved from a single piece of rock) situated above a hill in Shravanabelagola in the Hassan district, Karnataka state, India. It was built circa 981 A.D. and is one of the largest free-standing statues in the world. Legends The ƒÄdi purƒÅ·πáa, a 9th-century Sanskrit poem, deals with the ten lives of the first tirthankara, Rishabhanatha and his two sons Bharata and Bahubali. It was composed by Jinasena, a Digambara monk. =Family life= According to Jain texts, Bahubali was born to Rishabhanatha and Sunanda during the Ikshvaku dynasty in Ayodhya. He is said to have excelled in studying medicine, archery, floriculture, and the knowledge of precious gems. Bahubali had a son named Somakirti (also known as Mahabala). When Rishabhanatha decided to become a monk, he distributed his kingdom among his 100 sons. Bharata was gifted the kingdom of Vinita (Ayodhya) and Bahubali got the kingdom of Asmaka from South India, having Podanapur as its capital. After winning six divisions of earth in all directions (digvijaya), Bharata proceeded to his capital Ayodhyapuri with a huge army and divine chakra-ratna‚Äîspinning, disk-like super weapon with serrated edges. But the chakra-ratna stopped on its own at the entrance of Ayodhyapuri, signalling to the emperor that his 99 brothers have yet not submitted to his authority. Bharata's 98 brothers became Jain monks and submitted their kingdoms to him. Bahubali was endowed with the final and superior body of extraordinary sturdiness and strength (vajra- ·πõ·π£abhanƒÅrƒÅcasa·πÉhanana) like Bharata. He hurled open defiance at the chakravartin and challenged him to a fight. The ministers on both sides gave the following argument to prevent war; \\"The brothers themselves, cannot be killed by any means; they are in their last incarnations in transmigration, and possess bodies which no weapon may mortally wound in warfare! Let them fight out the issue by themselves in other ways.\\" It was then decided that to settle the dispute, three kinds of contests between Bharata and Bahubali would be held. These were eye-fight (staring at each other), water-fight (jala- yuddha), and wrestling (malla-yuddha). Bahubali won all the three contests over his elder brother, Bharata. = Renunciation = Sculpture depicting Bahubali's meditation in Kayotsarga posture with vines enveloped around his body (Photo: Badami caves) After the fight, Bahubali was filled with disgust at the world and developed a desire for renunciation. Bahubali abandoned all possessions-kingdom, clothes, ornaments-to become a monk and began meditating with great resolve to attain omniscience (Kevala Gyana). He is said to have meditated motionless in a standing posture (kayotsarga) for a year, during which time climbing plants grew around his legs. However, he was adamant and continued his practice unmindful of the vines, ants, and dust that enveloped his body. According to Jain text ƒÄdi purƒÅ·πáa, on the last day of Bahubali's one year long fast, Bharata came in all humility to Bahubali and worshiped him with veneration and respect. A painful regret that he had been the cause of his elder brother's humiliation had been disturbing Bahubali's meditation; this was dispersed when Bharata worshipped him. Bahubali was then able to destroy the four kinds of inimical karmas, including the knowledge obscuring karma, and he attained omniscience (kevala gyana). He was now revered as an omniscient being (Kevali). Bahubali finally attained liberation (moksha) and became a pure, liberated soul (siddha). As per texts, he was one of the first Digambara monks to have attained moksha in the present half-cycle of time.(Avasarpi·πáƒ´).  Statues  There are five monolithic statues of Bahubali measuring more than 6 m (20 feet) in height in Karnataka: * 17.4 m (57 feet) at Shravanabelagola in Hassan District in 981 AD * 12.8 m (42 feet) at Karkala in Udupi District in 1430 AD * 11.9 m (39 feet) at Dharmasthala in Dakshina Kannada District in 1973 AD * 10.7 m (35 feet) at Venur in Dakshina Kannada District in 1604 AD * 6 m (20 feet) at Gommatagiri in Mysore District in 12th Century AD = Shravanabelagola = The monolithic statue of Bahubali at Shravanabelagola, located from Bangalore, was carved from a single block of granite. The statue was commissioned by the Ganga dynasty minister and commander Chavundaraya; it is tall and is situated above a hill in Shravanabelagola, in the Hassan district of Karnataka. It was built in and around 981 A.D. and is one of the largest free-standing statues in the world. The statue is visible from away. Shravanabelagola has remained a centre of pilgrimage (tirtha) for the Jains. The statue is bathed at an interval of every 12 years and this event is celebrated as Mahamastakabhisheka. = Karkala = Bahubali monolith of Karkala Karkala is known for its monolithic statue of Gomateshwara Bahubali, which is believed to have been built around 1432 and is the second-tallest statue in the State. The statue is built on an elevated platform on top of a rocky hill. It was consecrated on 13 February 1432 by Veera Pandya Bhair Arasa Wodeyar, scion of the Bhair Arasa dynasty , feudatory of the Vijayanagar Ruler. =Dharmastala= Bahubali monolith of Dharmastala A high statue with a pedestal that weighs about is installed at Dharmasthala in Karnataka. = Venur = Bahubali monolith of Venur Venur is a small town in Dakshina Kannada district, Karnataka state, situated on the bank of the Gurupura River. Thimmanna Ajila built a colossus of Gommateshwara there in 1604 AD. The statue at Venur is the shortest of the three Gommateshwaras within around it. It stands in an enclosure on the same pattern as that of the statue at Shravanabelagola. The Kings of Ajila Dynasty ruled here from 1154 to 1786. = Gommatagiri = Bahubali monolith of Gommatagiri, Mysore Gommatagiri is an acclaimed Jain centre. The 12th-century granite statue of Bahubali, also known as Gomateshwara, is erected atop a tall hillock called 'Shravana Gudda'. The Jain centre attracts many pilgrims during the annual Mahamastakabhisheka in September. The statue at Gommatagiri is very similar to the Gommateshwara statue in Shravanabelagola, except that it is smaller. Historians attribute the statue to an early Vijayanagar period. = Kumbhoj = -high monolith of Bahubali at Kumbhoj Kumbhoj is the name of an ancient town located in Kolhapur district, Maharashtra. The town is about eight kilometers from Hatkanangale, about twenty seven kilometers from Kolhapur. The famous Jain pilgrimage centre where a -high statue of Bahubali is installed is from the Kumbhoj city. = Aretipur = There is a -high statue of Bahubali at Aretipur, Near Kokrebellur Village of Madur Taluk Mandya district. In 2016, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) excavated another -high statue of Bahubali made in the 3rd ‚Äì 9th centuries in Aretipur. ASI has also excavated an 8th-century statue of Bahubali in Aretipur, Maddur, Mandya, Karnataka, that is wide and tall. In literature Poem by Boppanna The life-story of Bahubali has been discussed in many works. = Sanskrit = * The ƒÄdi purƒÅ·πáa composed by ƒÄchƒÅrya Jinasena. The Gommateshvara statue built by Chavundaraya was influenced by description in this book. * Bahubali charitra written in the 9th century A.D. = Kannada = * A 10th-century Kannada text based on the Sanskrit text was written by the poet Adikavi Pampa. * A poem dated 1180 was composed by a Jain poet named Boppanna (also known as Sujanottamsa), in praise of Bahubali. = Rajasthani = * Bharateshwara Bahubali Ghora composed by Vajrasena Suri in 1168, is a poem with 48 verses describing the battle between Bharata and Bahubali.

In cardiology, a ventricular escape beat is a self-generated electrical discharge initiated by, and causing contraction of, the ventricles of the heart; normally the heart rhythm is begun in the atria of the heart and is subsequently transmitted to the ventricles. The ventricular escape beat follows a long pause in ventricular rhythm and acts to prevent cardiac arrest. It indicates a failure of the electrical conduction system of the heart to stimulate the ventricles (which would lead to the absence of heartbeats, unless ventricular escape beats occur). Causes Ventricular escape beats occur when the rate of electrical discharge reaching the ventricles (normally initiated by the heart's sinoatrial node (SA node), transmitted to the atrioventricular node (AV node), and then further transmitted to the ventricles) falls below the base rate determined by the rate of Phase 4 spontaneous depolarisation of ventricular pacemaker cells.C. Andreasen, et al. (2006) Mosby Elsevier, Mosby's Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing & Health Professions 7th edition, p1951 An escape beat usually occurs 2‚Äì3 seconds after an electrical impulse has failed to reach the ventricles. This phenomenon can be caused by the sinoatrial node (SA node) failing to initiate a beat, by a failure of the conductivity from the SA node to the atrioventricular node (AV node), or by atrioventricular block (especially third degree AV block). Normally, the pacemaker cells of the sinoatrial node discharge at the highest frequency and are thus dominant over other cells with pacemaker activity. The AV node normally has the second fastest discharge rate. When the sinus rate falls below the discharge rate of the AV node, this becomes the dominant pacemaker, and the result is called a junctional escape beat. If the rate from both the SA and AV node fall below the discharge rate of ventricular pacemaker cells, a ventricular escape beat ensues. An escape beat is a form of cardiac arrhythmia, in this case known as an ectopic beat. It can be considered a form of ectopic pacemaker activity that is unveiled by lack of other pacemakers to stimulate the ventricles. Ventricular pacemaker cells discharge at a slower rate than the SA or AV node. While the SA node typically initiates a rate of 70 beats per minute (BPM), the atrioventricular node (AV node) is usually only capable of generating a rhythm at 40-60 BPM or less. Ventricular contraction rate is thus reduced by 15-40 beats per minute.D.D. Costa, W.J. Brady, J. Edhouse (March 2002), BMJ Publishing Group Ltd., ABC of clinical electrocardiography, British Medical Journal: 324:535-538. If there are only one or two ectopic beats, they are considered escape beats. If this causes a semi-normal rhythm to arise it is considered an idioventricular rhythm. The escape arrhythmia is a compensatory mechanism that indicates a serious underlying problem with the SA node or conduction system (commonly due to heart attack or medication side effect), and because of its low rate, it can cause a drop in blood pressure and syncope. Diagnosis An electrocardiogram can be used to identify a ventricular escape beat. The QRS portion of the electrocardiogram represents the ventricular depolarisation; in normal circumstances the QRS complex forms a sharp sudden peak. For a patient with a ventricular escape beat, the shape of the QRS complex is broader as the impulse can not travel quickly via the normal electrical conduction system. The first 2.5 seconds show a normal cardiac cycle. This is followed by a period of delayed sinus activity which initiates a takeover response by the ventricular pacemaker cells resulting in a ventricular escape beat. Two escape beats are shown between 5-8 seconds. Ventricular escape beats differ from ventricular extrasystoles (or premature ventricular contractions), which are spontaneous electrical discharges of the ventricles. These are not preceded by a pause; on the contrary they are often followed by a compensatory pause. Management =Cilostazol= Third degree AV block can be treated with Cilostazol which acts to increase Ventricular escape rate =Ouabain= Ouabain infusion decreases ventricular escape time and increases ventricular escape rhythm. However, a high dose of ouabain can lead to ventricular tachycardia.

Founded in 1902, it is the flagship institution of higher learning in Guizhou province. With over 30,000 students, Guida is one of the largest universities in southwest China. The university was selected to participate in Project 211, a government initiative which provided significant funding to elevate the research standards and faculty hiring resources of rising universities across China. In 2017, the university was recognized by the Chinese Ministry of Education as a Double First Class University, with Double First Class status in certain disciplines which the government seeks to elevate to \\"world-class\\" status. History The predecessor of the modern Guizhou University was known as the Guizhou Institute of Higher Learning (), which was founded in 1902. The institute evolved into the Provincial Guizhou University (), National Guizhou College of Agriculture and Engineering (), and finally National Guizhou University (). In 1997, the Guizhou Agricultural College, Guizhou Institute of Arts, and Guizhou Agricultural Cadre-Training School were merged into NGU to form Guizhou University. In 2004, the Guizhou University of Technology merged into Guizhou University to complete the current Guizhou University. In 2005, the University was invited as a member of Project 211 by the Ministry of Education. Guizhou University established a sister school relationship with the Presbyterian College in Clinton, South Carolina; the latter offers a Chinese language program for the fifteen American students every year.  Disciplines The university consists of 39 colleges and offers programs of study in 11 academic divisions leading to associate, baccalaureate, master's, and doctoral degrees. These include: *Agriculture *Administration *Economics *Education *Engineering *History *Law *Liberal arts *Medicine *Philosophy *Sciences International cooperation and Peace Corps involvement In 1989 Guizhou Agricultural College, then a separate university, began hosting VSO teachers in the Foreign Language Department. The following year, Guizhou University began hosting foreign teachers from the AISH programme in Australia and visiting teacher programmes in both New Zealand and the University of Alabama. Simultaneously, VSO teachers from the UK and the Netherlands were recruited to work in other Guiyang institutes of higher education including the school of fashion and the catering college, both experiencing booms concurrent with Guiyang's emergence from relative obscurity. These teachers taught in both the undergraduate and post-graduate programmes at each institution. In 2005, eight years after Gui Nong (Guizhou Agricultural College) was merged with Gui Da (Guizhou University), Guizhou University began hosting United States Peace Corps Volunteers. The volunteers teach at both the undergraduate and graduate level in the School of Foreign Languages. In Malaysia, Guizhou University partnered with Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman.  Campus  Guizhou University has nine campuses situated in different locations around the city of Guiyang. The administrative center is located on the North Campus on the Huaxi River, Huaxi District of Guiyang.

The flats and by extension the forest ends at Forest Gate directly to the south. It now falls wholly within the boundaries of London Borough of Redbridge and London Borough of Waltham Forest, though until 1994 two parts of it were in the London Borough of Newham - one of these was the section between Aldersbrook Road and Capel Road east of the junction between Aldersbrook Road and St Margaret's Road, whilst the other was the strip running along Capel Road between its junctions with Centre Road (the A114) and Ridley Road.http://www.lgbce.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/11905/661.-london- borough-of-newham-and-its-boundaries-with-redbridge-lb,-waltham-forest- lb,-hackney-lb,-tower-hamlets-lb-and-greenwich-lb.pdf Geography Wanstead Flats is surrounded by the heavily built-up areas of Leytonstone (Waltham Forest) to the west, Wanstead (Redbridge) to the north with Manor Park (Newham) and Forest Gate (Newham) to the southeast and south respectively. To the north-west it is connected by way of Bush Wood to Leyton Flats, and to more northerly reaches of Epping Forest. Roads and houses almost completely surround Wanstead Flats. To the east a low wall and high railing separate it from the City of London Cemetery and Crematorium. Three roads actually cross the Flats, effectively dividing it into four sections. The greater part of the whole area of some is flat, open grassland on the river gravel of the Taplow Terrace, which overlays the London Clay. History Though historically part of a royal forest, the nature of the area encouraged people to turn out cattle and other animals to graze upon this unenclosed land. This practice was eventually recognised and granted as the right of common pasture. Certain landowners and occupiers still have this right, granted them as part of the Epping Forest Act 1878, and cattle grazed freely until 1996 when the BSE crisis forced their removal. It is probable that continued grazing on this and similar areas of the Forest helped to maintain the open aspect which they have today. Although the campaign to prevent enclosure before 1878 is well known, less well known is the campaign organised by local people to prevent the building of houses for 7000 people on part of Wanstead Flats in 1946/47. In March 2010 the area surrounding Alexandra Lake was cordoned off following the deaths of more than 80 wild birds. Two men, Mark Page and Terrance Webb, were subsequently arrested on suspicion of illegally dumping chemical pesticides near the lake. The two men each admitted two counts of using a pesticide without approval and two counts of theft.Daily Telegraph: Men arrested over suspected poisoning of 80 birds and dog at wildlife spotNewham Recorder: Two quizzed over dead birds and dog = London 2012 police hub = On 16 November 2010, a planning application was submitted by the Metropolitan Police to the London Borough of Redbridge to build a police hub on Wanstead Flats. This planning application was granted, and subsequently a Parliamentary Order (the Legislative Reform (Epping Forest) Order 2011) allowed the police to erect a \\"muster, briefing and deployment centre\\" on Wanstead Flats from 23 June 2012 to 20 September 2012, for the purposes of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The Centre was removed after the Games had ended. = July 2018 fire = On 15 July 2018, a heatwave and dry conditions led to a huge grass fire on Wanstead Flats, which became the largest incident of its kind ever dealt with by the London Fire Brigade. = 2020 Temporary Mortuary = The easternmost section of the flats, between Aldersbrook Road and Forest Drive, was used to site a temporary mortuary in response to the 2020 Coronavirus crisis. Construction started in early April 2020. Features Alexandra Lake, Wanstead Flats =Water= Much of the land is liable to a degree of flooding after heavy rain, but also to considerable and quite rapid drying-out in periods of low rainfall. Drainage from the grassland should help to maintain usually three permanent open waters. The largest of these, with two islands to its credit, is Alexandra Lake. Its local name the Sandhills Pond may be attributed to the sandy nature of the low gravel mounds by its banks. The next in size is Jubilee Pond, which until 2002 was known as the Model Yacht Pond or Dames Road Pond. Until renovation in 2002 this had stone banks, and, as its name implied, was in the past used for model boating. Lack of repair and a water supply meant that for many years the pond was often dry. The smallest water is the round pond by Capel Road, Angel Pond. This was named after Lewis Angell, the first borough engineer of West Ham, who was responsible for the construction of the pond during the winter of 1893‚Äì94. The spelling soon became corrupted, as early postcards show. This is a circular muddy hollow which can dry out completely in hot weather. The only other semi-permanent pond is that by Lake House Road known as the Cat and Dog Pond, presumably because it only exists when it has been raining 'cats and dogs'. There are some drainage ditches, but few hold water for much time. The only running water used to be a year-round spring that was the source of one of the 'marshy' areas dominated by rushes that exist in some of the more poorly drained parts of the Flats. The spring, however, is now usually dry. During a period of lake creation at the turn of the 19th/20th century (when, for example, Alexandra Lake was created as part of a job creation scheme for the unemployed) it is said that the hollow at the junction of Aldersbrook Road and Centre Road was dug. It was supposed to have been a lake, but was not completed. =Plants= Scattered over the area are some thickets of gorse and broom, as well as a number of small woods and copses. Most of these were planted towards the end of the 19th century as a response to efforts by the Epping Forest Committee to break up what was perceived as a monotonous area of grassland. Together with the many trees lining the roadsides and some avenues, they add greatly to the diversity of tree species to be found. Older than these is an avenue of trees in the NW portion of the Flats, running from close to Ferndale Road in Leytonstone to Bush Wood. This is known as Evelyn's Avenue, planted by John Evelyn (author of Sylva, or a discourse of Forest- trees) on the instructions of Sir Josiah Child after he had purchased the estate. It formed one of a number of such avenues radiating from Wanstead House. Consisting of sweet chestnuts and forming one of the main approaches to Wanstead House, much of this is still visible after 300 years. Access Looking south towards Forest Gate Nearly all the perimeter of Wanstead Flats has a ditch, often with a bank, to prohibit vehicular access. The only vehicles normally allowed are service vehicles and bicycles. Horses may be taken onto the Flats and are supposed to keep to bridle paths marked by posts. There is considerable pedestrian traffic because of the large number of people living nearby and the availability of the area for activities such as the flying of model aircraft and kites, bird watching, botanising and the exercising of people and dogs. Portions of the Flats are also maintained as football pitches. Fishing in Alexandra Lake is no longer undertaken and model boating in the old Model Yacht Pond ceased when the pond no longer retained water. The area near the petrol station on Aldersbrook Road (where the sports rooms are) was used in the 1940s to house German prisoners of war. At the pointed junction of Blake Hall Road and Aldersbrook Road is a deep dip in the grass area. This was a World War II bomb crater. After the raid a wrecked United Dairies Milk lorry was found in the crater. A weekly parkrun event is held on the western section of the flats, with the start at the Harrow Road Pavilion. The course is a two lap figure-of-eight, on a mixture of woodland paths and the edge of the football pitches.

He later became a naturalized American. Schorr is recognized as the greatest Wagnerian bass-baritone of his generation, arguably of the entire 20th century, and was particularly famous for his profound portrayals of Wotan in Der Ring des Nibelungen and Hans Sachs in Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg. He was celebrated, too, for his appearances as Don Pizarro in Beethoven's Fidelio. His voice was powerful, steady, and rich-toned, with a beautiful mezza voce. He placed a special emphasis on maintaining a smooth, legato line in his singing, with no trace of Sprechgesang. Towards the end of Schorr's career, his extreme top notes became somewhat 'wooden', however, as the result of many years of strenuous usage. Biography The son of a cantor (hazzan) Mayer Schorr, who reportedly had a fine voice himself, Schorr was born in Oradea [Nagyvarad at the time]. He studied in Brno and Vienna with Adolf Robinson. He made his stage debut in Graz, singing there in 1912-1916. Afterwards he worked in Prague (1916‚Äì1918), Cologne (1918‚Äì1923), Berlin (State Opera Unter den Linden, 1923‚Äì1931). He also made acclaimed appearances in London at Covent Garden (1924‚Äì1931), at New York's Metropolitan Opera (1924‚Äì1943) and the Bayreuth Festival (1925‚Äì1933). Schorr emigrated to the United States in 1931. He lived in New York City and performed regularly at the Metropolitan Opera until 1943. Some of the outstanding Wagnerian singers that he appeared with during his career included Frida Leider, Lotte Lehmann, Elisabeth Rethberg, Lauritz Melchior, Kirsten Flagstad, and Helen Traubel. After his retirement from performance he worked as a director and gave concerts. He also taught singing privately. One of his students was mezzo- soprano Nell Tangeman. He died in Farmington, Connecticut.  Recordings  Schorr made a number of recordings both in Europe and America by both the acoustic and electrical processes. Although some of them, particularly those recorded in America, were produced after he had passed his artistic zenith, these records still prove Schorr's vocal strength and solidity, his clear diction, his excellent breathing, and the great emotional expressiveness of his interpretations. Most of his records are available on CD transfers issued by various companies, including a number of live operatic performances dating from the 1930s.

He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-fast bowler. After several years of minor counties cricket for Wiltshire, Sillence made his List A debut in May 1999, when he appeared in the NatWest Trophy against the Northamptonshire Cricket Board. His contribution was decisive as he hit 82, the top score of the innings, to help his side record a two-wicket victory. However, his two further List A games for the county, in September 1999 and May 2000, were unsuccessful as he could manage only 0 and 7. In 2000 Sillence played often for Wiltshire during those two seasons, and also had a few games with the Worcestershire Second XI with little success. In August he had an excellent run for Wiltshire, scoring 35, 106*, 32, 57, 74 and 150 in successive innings. That last knock was the final time he was to play for Wiltshire, as he was immediately called up by Gloucestershire's second team and remained with them for the rest of the season, continuing to play for the seconds throughout most of the following summer. In 2001 he also made his first-class debut, playing a single game against Sussex and making an immediate impact by taking 5‚Äì97 in the first innings, his maiden victim at this level being the opposing captain, Chris Adams. However, he failed to impress with the bat: he made only 0 and 6, and in both innings his method of dismissal was identical: caught Montgomerie, bowled Kirtley. 2002 saw Sillence make his maiden first-class century as he hit 101 (from number nine in the order) against Derbyshire, though the second-highest of his seven innings was only 33, while with the ball he took 4‚Äì35 against West Indies A in a one-day match in late July, then in the last County Championship match of the season he took 5‚Äì63 against Durham. He remained with Gloucestershire for three more seasons, making 92 (again from number nine) in the Championship against Warwickshire in August 2004, but first-team opportunities grew increasingly thin on the ground, until by 2005 he could manage only a single appearance. In October of that year Sillence signed a two-year contract with Worcestershire, and bided his time until then by spending the winter in Australia, playing for Casey-South Melbourne in Victorian Premier Cricket. Back in England, the 2006 season began promisingly for Sillence as he was picked for a series of Worcestershire's pre-season minor matches against other counties. He was not particularly successful, however, and after a C&G; Trophy to forget against Nottinghamshire (0 with the bat; 3‚Äì0‚Äì21‚Äì0 with the ball) he was sent to captain the second team against Leicestershire seconds. He immediately showed his ability by scoring 152 out of a Worcestershire total of 265, although he did not bowl a single ball. Sillence returned to the first team immediately thereafter, managing to establish himself as a first-choice player, and in June recorded career-best figures of 7‚Äì96 in the first innings against Somerset. (He had been given an excellent platform by Worcestershire's own first innings of 618, which included a stand of 330 between Ben Smith and Graeme Hick, a county record against these opponents.) He kept his place for the mid-season Twenty20 Cup, and afterwards contributed a number of useful innings, most notably in a 50-over game against West Indies A, when his 97-ball 94 set up a narrow nine-run win. Sillence played 10 first-class matches in 2007 but took only 15 wickets, at the end of the season he was released by Worcestershire.Worcestershire release three players Sillence has also played as Longton C.C.'s professional in the North Staffs and South Cheshire League Premier Division 'A', substituting for Bruce Martin, a New Zealander who proved unable to appear because of UK visa regulations.

She was married to Sun Liang, the second emperor of Wu. Life Lady Quan was the daughter of Quan Shang (ÂÖ®Â∞ö). Her mother is the daughter of Sun Gong, the grandson of Sun Jing. Her relative Quan Cong married Sun Luban, a daughter of Wu's founding emperor Sun Quan. When she was young, she looked pretty and was favoured by Sun Luban. Every time Sun Luban entered the palace, she took Lady Quan to visit her father. When a succession struggle between Sun Quan's sons Sun He and Sun Ba was ongoing, Sun Luban, who had a feud with Sun He's mother, urged her father to arrange a marriage between Lady Quan and Sun Liang (another of Sun Quan's sons born to Lady Pan) because Sun Liang and his mother were becoming increasingly favoured by Sun Quan. Around 250, the succession struggle between Sun He and Sun Ba concluded when Sun Quan deposed Sun He from his position as crown prince and forced Sun Ba to commit suicide. Sun Liang was designated as the new heir apparent to the Wu throne.(Â≠´‰∫ÆÂÖ®Â§´‰∫∫ÔºåÂÖ®Â∞öÂ•≥‰πü„ÄÇÂ∞öÂæûÁ•ñÊØçÂÖ¨‰∏ªÊÑõ‰πãÔºåÊØèÈÄ≤Ë¶ãËºíËàá‰ø±„ÄÇÂèäÊΩòÂ§´‰∫∫ÊØçÂ≠êÊúâÂØµÔºåÂÖ®‰∏ªËá™‰ª•ËàáÂ≠´ÂíåÊØçÊúâÈöôÔºå‰πÉÂã∏Ê¨äÁÇ∫ÊΩòÊ∞èÁî∑‰∫ÆÁ¥çÂ§´‰∫∫Ôºå‰∫ÆÈÅÇÁÇ∫Âó£„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 50. In 252, Sun Liang ascended the throne upon the death of his father. In January 253, he instated Lady Quan as the empress. Following that, Empress Quan's family and relatives rose to power as six members of the Quan clan (including Quan Shang) were enfeoffed as marquises and assumed high offices in the Wu government and military forces. This was regarded as a phenomenon because since the founding of Wu in 229, there had never been a case of waiqi (Â§ñÊàö; relatives of the emperor's wives) playing prominent roles in the Wu political scene. In 257, when Zhuge Dan (a general from Wu's rival state Cao Wei) started a rebellion in the Wei-controlled Shouchun (Â£ΩÊò•; around present-day Shou County, Anhui), he requested help from Wu so Sun Liang ordered the Quans to lead troops to Shouchun to assist Zhuge Dan. However, the rebellion was suppressed by Wei forces and Zhuge Dan was killed, while four of the Quans surrendered and defected to Wei, thereafter the Quans' influence in Wu weakened drastically.(Â§´‰∫∫Á´ãÁÇ∫ÁöáÂêéÔºå‰ª•Â∞öÁÇ∫ÂüéÈñÄÊ†°Â∞âÔºåÂ∞ÅÈÉΩ‰∫≠‰æØÔºå‰ª£ÊªïËÉ§ÁÇ∫Â§™Â∏∏„ÄÅË°ûÂ∞áËªçÔºåÈÄ≤Â∞ÅÊ∞∏Âπ≥‰æØÔºåÈåÑÂ∞öÊõ∏‰∫ã„ÄÇÊôÇÂÖ®Ê∞è‰æØÊúâ‰∫î‰∫∫Ôºå‰∏¶ÂÖ∏ÂÖµÈ¶¨ÔºåÂÖ∂È§òÁÇ∫‰æçÈÉé„ÄÅÈ®éÈÉΩÂ∞âÔºåÂÆøË°ûÂ∑¶Âè≥ÔºåËá™Âê≥ËààÔºåÂ§ñÊàöË≤¥ÁõõËé´Âèä„ÄÇÂèäÈ≠èÂ§ßÂ∞áË´∏ËëõË™ï‰ª•Â£ΩÊò•‰æÜÈôÑÔºåËÄåÂÖ®Êáå„ÄÅÂÖ®Á´Ø„ÄÅÂÖ®ÁÖí„ÄÅÂÖ®ÂÑÄÁ≠â‰∏¶Âõ†Ê≠§ÈöõÈôçÈ≠èÔºåÂÖ®ÁÜàË¨ÄÊ≥ÑË¶ãÊÆ∫ÔºåÁî±ÊòØË´∏ÂÖ®Ë°∞Âº±„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 50.

It is based on the novel Seemabaddha by Mani Shankar Mukherjee. It stars Barun Chanda, Harindranath Chattopadhyay, and Sharmila Tagore in lead roles. The film was the second entry in Ray's Calcutta trilogy, which included Pratidwandi (The Adversary) (1970) and Jana Aranya (The Middleman) (1976). The films deal with the rapid modernization of Calcutta, rising corporate culture and greed, and the futility of the rat race. The film won the FIPRESCI Award at the 33rd Venice International Film Festival, and the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in 1971. Plot Tutul and Shyamal at race course Shyamal (Barun Chanda) is an ambitious sales manager in a British fan manufacturing firm in Calcutta, where he is expecting a promotion shortly. He is married to Dolan and lives in a company flat. He aspires to become the company director. His sister-in-law, Tutul (Sharmila Tagore), arrives from Patna to stay with them for a few days. She is given a tour of the life they lead and the many upscale spaces they inhabit‚Äîthe restaurants, the beauty parlours, clubs and race courses. Tutul, whose father Shyamal had once been a student under, greatly admires him and his idealism. Secretly she is envious of her sister's marriage with him. Life goes on smoothly for Shyamal until he learns that a consignment of fans meant for export is defective just before the shipment of a prestigious order. The problem is that the fans were painted with a flaw. The company is under a contract requiring the shipment be delivered on time. There is a clause permitting delay in case of civil disturbance. To escape blame, Shyamal hatches a plan with the labour officer to provoke a strike at the factory. A factory watchman is badly injured, a false riot is organised, and a lock-out is declared. The delay caused by the strike and riot are used by the company to allow strikebreakers to make needed repairs. For his \\"efficient\\" handling of the crisis, Shyamal is promoted, and there is congratulations all around. However, he has fallen in the eyes of Tutul and himself. He is finally at the top, both successful‚Äî and desolate.

The school is managed by the Methodist Church, Hong Kong. History School building Wa Ying College was founded as Wa Ying Middle School (Chinese name ËèØËã±‰∏≠Â≠∏) by the Methodist Church in 1913 in Foshan of Guangdong, China. The school quickly established itself as one of the three most prestigious middle schools in pre-World War II southern China. During the War, the school relocated to Hong Kong in Tung Chung Fort, Tung Chung, Lantau Island and later moved to Shatin. It returned to Foshan after the War. In 1951, after the Communist Party of China came into power in mainland China, the Foshan-based Wa Ying Middle School was confiscated by the state owing to the People's Republic of China's atheist Communist ideology, under which religious organizations-run schools are not allowed to operate. The Foshan No.1 Middle School (Âª£Êù±ÁúÅ‰ΩõÂ±±Â∏ÇÁ¨¨‰∏Ä‰∏≠Â≠∏; pinyin Guangdong sheng Foshan shi Diyi Zhongxue, abbrev ‰ΩõÂ±±‰∏Ä‰∏≠; pinyin Foshan Yizhong), was formed after the authorities merged the former Wa Ying Middle School with the public run Foshan Middle School (‰ΩõÂ±±‰∏≠Â≠∏; pinyin Foshan Zhongxue) and sited at the former Wa Ying Middle School. In 1969, alumni of Wa Ying Middle School based in Hong Kong handed a proposal to the Chinese Methodist Church to re- establish the school in Hong Kong, then out of the People's Republic of China's control. The alumni pledged to raise funds to start the building project and entrusted the school to the Church as in the past. With less than 400 alumni, nearly $300,000 was raised. In addition to a loan of $250,000 and a subsidy of two million dollars granted from the Hong Kong Government, the dream of resuming the school came true. Construction work began at its present site at Ho Man Tin in 1970. In September 1971, named Wa Ying College in English while keeping the Chinese name of its Foshan predecessor, started with 18 teachers and 12 classes. The school gradually expanded to up to 31 classes by the 1983-84 academic year. The school campus has undergone a number of renovations over the years, with the most recent at the late 2005. Reputation and achievements Wa Ying College is considered a school with an excellent reputation both district-wide and territory-wide. All Form 1 student intakes are band 1 primary school graduates and competition for a place at Wa Ying is highly intense, the admittance ratio for the year 2007-2008 is 14:1. In the past HKAL era, a majority (regularly 85%+) of its Form 7 graduates were admitted to universities in Hong Kong every year. Since the new HKDSE exam has been put into practice, more than 60% of Wa Ying College's Form 6 graduates were admitted to local universities in both two cycles. The school's policies are also known to be highly progressive. Since its re-founding in Hong Kong in 1971, all teachers have been involved in the school's administrative work and the making of school policies through the system of functional committees. The school also pioneered school counseling practices in Hong Kong by introducing social workers into the school and setting up peer counseling schemes . Most of the student welfare affairs have been managed by the democratically elected Wa Ying College Student Union since 1992. The two subjects, Hong Kong Local History and Liberal Studies, were also introduced into the school curriculum long before they became fashionable in Hong Kong education. In the upcoming introduction of new Senior Secondary Curriculum, Wa Ying College is one of the pioneer schools that offers Design and Applied Technology (DAT) as a technology-based elective, while most other schools offer the more common electives such as Finance and Information Technology related subjects at the initial stage . And this brave take proved to be a huge success as in the first HKDSE exam cycle, the highest achieving DAT candidate was a student from Wa Ying College. However, due to the school's policy that no elective course should be offered with less than 10 students, no more DAT class has been opened after the first HKDSE exam cycle, despite some capable students with potential in the subject show great interest in reading the subject and intense opposition to the school's policy every year. The school's teachers and students enjoy a very close-knit relationship together and there is a well known saying of \\"A Wa Yinger for once, A Wa Yinger for life\\" (‰∏ÄÊó•ËèØËã±‰∫∫Ôºå‰∏ÄÁîüËèØËã±‰∫∫„ÄÇ) among Wa Ying's students and alumni.

Childhood and education Almaraz was born in Mexico City, but his family moved when he was a young child, settling in Chicago, Illinois, where his father owned a restaurant for five years and worked in Gary steel mills for another four. The neighborhood Almaraz and his brother were raised in was multicultural, which led him to appreciate the melting pot of American culture. During his youth in Chicago, the family traveled to Mexico City frequently, where Almaraz reports having his \\"first impression of art\\" that \\"was both horrifying and absolutely magical\\", in other words \\"Sublime\\". A painting of John the Baptist in the Mexico City cathedral appeared as a gorilla to his young eye and frightened him, but it also taught him \\"that art can be something almost alive.\\" When Almaraz was nine his family moved to Los Angeles on a doctor's recommendation that his father seek a warm climate to assuage his rheumatism, and also as a result of family problems, first settling in Wilmington, later moving to the then-rural Chatsworth, where they lived in communal housing with other Mexicans. The family then relocated to a Mexican \\"colony\\" of the nearly-all-white Beverly Hills, and still later to the barrio of East Los Angeles. Almaraz's interest in the arts, nascent in Chicago, blossomed after his family moved to California, and the sense of mobility developed after so many moves later allowed him to connect with migrant farmworkers and their children. He graduated from Garfield High School in 1959 and attended Los Angeles City College, studying under David Ramirez, and took summer classes at Loyola Marymount University. Loyola offered him a full scholarship, but he declined it in protest of the University's support of the Vietnam War and stopped professing the Catholic faith altogether. He attended California State University, Los Angeles but became discouraged by the structure of the art department there, \\"because there was no place for an artist.\\" While at CSULA, Almaraz began attending night courses at the Otis College of Art and Design, then known as Otis Art Institute, studying under Joe Mugnaini. Almaraz studied arts at UCLA. In 1974, he earned an MFA from the Otis Art Institute (known as Otis College of Art and Design). Career A sketch of Carlos Almaraz holding a child. Carlos Almaraz, 1976 . Carlos Almaraz and Elsa Flores papers, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. In 1961, Almaraz moved to New York city, with Dan Guerrero, the son of Lalo Guerrero. He left after six months to take advantage of a scholarship offered him by Otis Art Institute. He returned to New York and lived there from 1966 to 1969, where he struggled as a painter in the middle of the new wave movements of the era. While in New York, he also wrote poetry and philosophy. Almaraz's poems and philosophical views have been published in fifty books. After returning to California, Almaraz almost died in 1971, and was given the last rites. It has been said that he had an experience with God during his convalescence. By 1972, he was already involved with Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers (UFW). In 1973, he was one of four artists who formed the influential artist collective known as Los Four. In 1974, Judithe Hern√°ndez, who was a friend and classmate from graduate school at Otis Art Institute became the fifth member and the only woman in Los Four. With the addition of Hern√°ndez, the collective exhibited and created public art together for the next decade and have been credited with bringing Chicano art to the attention of mainstream American art institutions. He also painted for Luis Valdez's Teatro Campesino. Some of his murals are heavily influenced by the actos from Teatro Campesino. His \\"Echo Park\\" series of paintings, named after a Los Angeles park of the same name, became known worldwide and have been displayed in many museums internationally. On November 12, 1978, Almaraz wrote \\"Because love is not found in Echo Park, I'll go where it is found\\". While Almaraz may not have found love at Echo Park, he certainly found inspiration to produce paintings there: he lived close to the park, having a clear view of the park from his apartment's window. Another of Almaraz's works, named \\"Boycott Gallo\\", became a cultural landmark in the community of East Los Angeles. During the late 1980s, however, \\"Boycott Gallo\\" was brought down. Almaraz was married to Elsa Flores, Chicana activist and photographer. Together, the pair produced \\"California Dreamscape\\". He exhibited his work at the Jan Turner Gallery starting in the mid-1980s in Los Angeles through his passing. Carlos Almaraz died in 1989 of AIDS-related causes. He is remembered as an artist who used his talent to bring critical attention to the early Chicano Art Movement, as well as a supporter of Cesar Ch√°vez and the UFW. His work continues to enjoy popularity. In 1992 the Los Angeles County Museum of Art honored him with a tribute featuring 28 of his drawings and prints donated by his widow. Flores continues to represent his estate. An exhibition of his paintings, pastels, and drawings from the 70s and 80s opened in September 2011, in conjunction with the Getty Research Institute's \\"Pacific Standard Time: Art in LA 1945-1980\\". Almaraz will also be featured in corresponding \\"Pacific Standard Time\\" exhibitions, including \\"MEX/LA: Mexican Modernism(s) in Los Angeles 1930-1985\\" at the Museum of Latin American Art, \\"Mapping Another L.A.: The Chicano Art Movement\\" at the Fowler Museum.http://pacificstandardtime.org/exhibitions His and Flores's papers are preserved at the Smithsonian.

Then in the 1975‚Äì76 season, while rehearsing Wozzeck, she was \\"discovered\\" by Herbert von Karajan, who was then looking for his new Salome. She was summoned to Berlin to audition for the role. Karajan liked what he heard and invited her to portray the role at the 1977 Salzburg Festival.

It is currently playing in the Promotion A, i.e. the fourth level in the Belgian football league system. The club underwent 5 merges and changed its name many times. It achieved its best ranking in 1925 and 1929 with a 5th place in the first division. History The club was founded in the late nineteenth century with the fusion between Athletic Club Gantois (Gantois means \\"from Ghent\\" in French), F.C. Gantois and Sport P√©destre Gantois. The new club named Racing Club de Gand registered to the Belgian Football Association in the late 1890s and received the matricule n¬∞11. It took part to the 1898‚Äì99 and 1899‚Äì1900 seasons in the first division B. Back in 1908 at the top level, the club finished last (12th) and played two seasons in the second division. It lost the final of the first Belgian Cup in history in 1912. From 1911 to 1935 R.C. de Gand played in the first division (except in 1922‚Äì23 and 1930‚Äì31 when it was in the second division) and so did its rivals K.A.A. Gent between 1913 and 1929. The club had meanwhile changed its name to R.R.C. de Gand in 1925. In 1952 the club played in the first division again but this time for its last season at this stage, as of 2005. Three years later it was relegated to the third division from which it would never be promoted. In 1987 R.R.C. Gent (as it was named since 1969, i.e. the name of the city was put to Dutch) merged with F.C. Heirnis Gent to become R.R.C. Heirnis Gent. It then changed back briefly to R.R.C. Gent in 1999 and merged with K.V.V. Standaard Meulestede in 2000 to become R.R.C. Gent- Zeehaven. In 2002 the club merged with K.F.C. Oostakker and changed its name to K.R.C. Gent-Zeehaven. Finally in 2016 the club changed its name to K.R.C. Gent.

Nicolo Impastato was an admitted member of the Mafia who was born near Palermo, Sicily and became a Mafioso while still in Sicily. He fled to the U.S. in 1927 during Benito Mussolini's campaign to eradicate the Mafia in Sicily. He eventually settled in Kansas City, Missouri, where he was taken in by the local Mafia family which was then headed by Frank \\"Chee Chee\\" DeMayo. Impastato reportedly quickly developed mob contacts in several U.S. cities. His brother, Vito Impastato, was also a known Mafia member who resided in Springfield, Illinois. As a member of the Kansas City Cosa Nostra organization, Impastato became known primarily for his role as a go-between with the KC and Tampa, Florida crime families. He was sent to Tampa in 1939, probably at the behest of KC mob boss Charles Binaggio to coordinate the transfer of heroin between the two cities. The heroin was smuggled into the country via Cuba after having been shipped there by cargo ship from Italy or France. The heroin originated in the Middle East and Asia. Impastato interacted with the Antinori's, prominent members of the Tampa family, which was led at the time by James Lumia. It was believed that Impastato and his cohort James DeSimone also performed various enforcement tasks for the Tampa family. In 1941 the KC family reportedly received a shipment of bad heroin from the Antinori's. Kansas City, and the other crime families around the country that had received portions of the bad heroin (KC distributed it to other cities), demanded a refund on their money for the shipment, estimated to have been about $25,000.00 worth. The Antinori's refused and on October 23, 1940 Ignacio Antinori, the patriarch of the family, was killed by a shotgun blast to the head while seated at a table in the Palm Garden Inn in Tampa. His sons, Joe and Paul, continued leading the smuggling ring after his murder. The downfall of the narcotics ring came in April 1942 when the Bureau of Narcotics received a tip on the Kansas City part of the operation. They conducted raids on a bar at Armour and Troost, and at the residence of Felipo Pernice at 425 S. Montgall in Kansas City, where they seized heroin secreted in coffee bags that had been hidden in a compartment in the basement of the house. Several of the ring's members were rounded up, including Joseph DeLuca, a Binaggio lieutenant that was in charge of the KC part of the ring. The Feds scored a break when they managed to \\"turn\\" one of the lower level \\"mules\\", Carl Caramusa. They also turned Thomas Buffa, a St. Louis mobster involved in the ring. Both Caramusa and Buffa testified in the 1943 trials related to the drug ring. Most of the mobsters charged were convicted, including Impastato, who received a two-year term in Federal prison. The mob didn't forget about Caramusa and Buffa. On June 21, 1945, Caramusa was killed by a shotgun blast while changing a tire on his car in front of his daughter who was seated on the front porch of their new home. An initial attempt to kill Buffa failed, and he fled the Midwest. In March 1946, he was tracked down and shot to death in Lodi, California. As for Impastato, he was deported back to Sicily following his release from prison. He died in September 1979.

Early life De Menil was born Dominique Isaline Zelia Henriette Clarisse Schlumberger, the daughter of Conrad and Louise Delpech Schlumberger. She studied physics and mathematics at the Sorbonne and developed an interest in filmmaking, which took her to Berlin to serve as script assistant on the Josef von Sternberg production of The Blue Angel. She also published articles on film technology in the French journal La revue du cin√©ma.Schlumberger, Dominique. ‚ÄúLes divers proc√©d√©s du film parlant.\\" Le revue du cin√©ma 2, no. 9 (April 1930): 43‚Äì52. In 1930 she met the banker Jean de Menil (who later anglicized his name to John), and they were married the next year. Raised a Protestant, Dominique converted to Roman Catholicism in 1932. The de Menils' Catholic faith, especially their interest in Father Yves Marie Joseph Congar's teachings on ecumenism, would become crucial to the development of their collecting ethos in the coming decades. They had five children: Marie- Christophe (who was married to Robert Thurman and was the grandmother of artist Dash Snow), Adelaide (a photographer who is the widow of anthropologist Edmund Snow Carpenter), George de Menil (an economist), Fran√ßois (a filmmaker and architect), and Philippa (co-founder of the Dia Art FoundationGlueck, Grace. ‚ÄúThe de Menil Family: The Medici of Modern Art.‚Äù New York Times Magazine, May 18, 1986: 28‚Äì46, 66, 106, 113. and the leader of a Sufi order in Lower Manhattan). Following the outbreak of World War II and the Nazi occupation of France, the de Menils emigrated from Paris to the United States of America. They maintained residences in New York and France but settled in Houston, where John would eventually become president of Schlumberger Overseas (Middle and Far East) and Schlumberger Surenco (Latin America), two branches of the Houston-based oilfield services corporation. Collecting art John and Dominique de Menil began collecting art intensively in the 1940s, beginning with a purchase of Paul C√©zanne's 1895 painting Montagne (Mountain) in 1945. With the guidance of the Dominican priest Marie-Alain Couturier, who introduced the de Menils to the work of artists in galleries and museums in New York, they became interested in the intersection of modern art and spirituality. They ultimately amassed more than 17,000 paintings, sculptures, decorative objects, prints, drawings, photographs, and rare books.La rime et la raison: Les collections M√©nil (Houston‚ÄìNew York). Exhibition catalogue. Paris: Galeries nationales du Grand Palais, 1984. De Menil with gallery model, Houston, 1973 The de Menils were particularly interested in modern European art, and a core strength of the collection was the many Cubist, Surrealist, and other Modernist works they acquired. By the 1960s the de Menils had gravitated toward the major American post-war movements of Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art, and Minimalism.The Menil Collection: A Selection from the Paleolithic to the Modern Era. New York: Abrams, 1987. Rev. ed., 1997. Over the years the family enjoyed close personal friendships with many of the artists whose work they collected, including Victor Brauner, Max Ernst, Jasper Johns, Yves Klein, Ren√© Magritte, Robert Rauschenberg, Dorothea Tanning, and Andy Warhol. The de Menils, however, did not limit their acquisitions to modern art, and their eclectic tastes became a hallmark of their collecting practices. As modernists, they recognized the profound formal and spiritual connections between contemporary works of art and the arts of ancient and indigenous cultures, broadening their collection to include works from classical Mediterranean and Byzantine cultures, as well as objects from Africa, Oceania, and the Pacific Northwest.Van Dyke, Kristina. African Art from The Menil Collection. Houston: Menil Foundation; New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2008. De Menil credited dealer and adviser John Klejman with shaping their tastes in African and Oceanic objects, saying that he \\"made buying African art very tempting.\\"Dominique de Menil, Quoted in Browning 1983, 37 They bought more than two hundred pieces from Klejman's New York Gallery. Influenced by the teachings of Father Couturier and Father Congar, the de Menils developed a particular humanist ethos in which they understood art as a central part of the human experience. Their collection was motivated by their shared interest in the many ways individuals over different cultures and eras reveal through art their understanding of what it means to be human. Art patron After moving to Houston, the de Menils quickly became key figures in the city's developing cultural life as advocates of modern art and architecture. In 1949 they commissioned the architect Philip Johnson to design their home in the River Oaks neighborhood in Houston. One of the first International Style residences in Texas, it generated controversy not only by standing out amongst the mansions of River Oaks but also by pairing Johnson's clean, modernist lines with a bold color palette and eclectic interior design by Charles James.Middleton, William. ‚ÄúA House That Rattled Texas Windows.‚Äù New York Times, June 3, 2004. The de Menils filled their home with art and hosted many of the leading artists, scientists, civil rights activists, and intellectuals of the day.

Marrero, La.: Hope Haven Press, 1949. in the 1950s and 1960s the de Menils promoted modern art through exhibitions held at the Contemporary Arts Association (later the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston), such as Max Ernst's first solo exhibition in the United States, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, to which they gave important gifts of art.Brennan, Marcia, Alfred Pacquement, and Ann Temkin.

In 1954 they founded the Menil Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to the \\"support and advancement of religious, charitable, literary, scientific and educational purposes.\\"Menil Foundation - Handbook of Texas Online Retrieved May 18, 2010. Strake and Jones Halls, designed by Philip Johnson, University of St. Thomas, Houston That same year they provided the University of St. Thomas, a small Catholic institution in Houston, with funding to build Strake Hall and Jones Hall, designed by Philip Johnson per their recommendation. In an effort to provide a strong art history curriculum in Houston for students and adults, they founded the Art Department at the University of St. Thomas in 1959, inviting Jermayne MacAgy to teach courses and curate exhibitions held at Jones Hall. They established the university's Media Center in 1967. The de Menils often personally recruited faculty members for the departments and brought many renowned artists and art historians to Houston, including Marcel Duchamp, Roberto Matta, and James Johnson Sweeney, whom they convinced to serve as museum director for the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston from 1961 to 1967. After Jermayne MacAgy's death in 1964, de Menil took over her classes and became the chairperson of the Art Department at the University of St. Thomas, curating several exhibitions over the next few years. After being met with increasing resistance by the more traditional Basilian clergy at the University of St. Thomas, in 1969 the de Menils moved the Art Department‚Äîincluding the art history faculty‚Äîand Media Center to Rice University, where they founded the Institute for the Arts to manage the exhibition program at Rice Museum. Notable exhibitions at Rice Museum organized with the help of the de Menils were \\"The Machine as Seen at the End of the Mechanical Age\\", curated by Pontus Hulten for the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and \\"Raid the Icebox 1 with Andy Warhol\\"Blake Gopnik, Warhol: A Life as Art London: Allen Lane. March 5, 2020. p. 601, an exhibition of objects selected by Warhol from the storage vaults of the Museum of Art at Rhode Island School of Design. At Rice the de Menils also cultivated their interest in film, working with such noted filmmakers as Roberto Rossellini, who made several trips to Houston to teach Rice University students and create television documentaries.Hugetz, Edward, and Brian Huberman. \\"The Memory of Rossellini in Texas.\\" In Roberto Rossellini, 107‚Äì15. Rome: Edizione Ente Autonomo Gestione Cinema, 1987. Published by the Ministero del Turismo e della Spettacolo for the multimedia project \\"Rossellini in Texas\\", October 1987. The de Menils supported Rice University Professor of Astrophysics, Donald D. Clayton for a two-week residence in Rome in June‚ÄìJuly 1970 for daily work with Rossellini conceiving a film about cosmology that did not advance to filming but that was published in 1975 as a personal memoir of a life discovering our universe.Donald D. Clayton, \\"The Dark Night Sky: a personal adventure in cosmology\\" Quadrangle/The New York Times Book Co. (New York 1975) Other filmmakers who visited the Media Center included Ola Balogun, Bernardo Bertolucci, James Blue, Jim McBride, and Colin Young. John and Dominique de Menil also shared an interest in photography, inviting photographers to come to Houston to document events in the city and exhibit their work. They commissioned Henri Cartier-Bresson to photograph the 1957 American Federation of Arts convention, held in Houston that year, and worked with photographers such as Frederick Baldwin and Wendy Watriss, who went on to establish FotoFest, and Geoff Winningham, who served as head of the Photography Department at Rice Media Center. Photography became an important component of the collection, which includes works by Eve Arnold, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Danny Lyon, Hans Namuth, and Eve Sonneman. Civil and human rights In addition to becoming known as collectors and patrons of art, John and Dominique de Menil were vocal champions of human rights worldwide. Their actions in Houston focused upon the Civil Rights Movement in particular. In 1960 they launched the ambitious scholarly research project \\"The Image of the Black in Western Art,\\" directed by art historian Ladislas Bugner. An ongoing project that seeks to catalogue and study the depiction of individuals of African descent in Western art, it is now under the aegis of Harvard University.Bugner, Ladislas, ed. The Image of the Black in Western Art. 4 vols. New York: William Morrow; Houston: Menil Foundation, 1976 to present. After Dominique de Menil's death the photographs and books assembled to support this research were donated to the Warburg Institute in the University of London. Their most controversial action on behalf of civil rights was their offer of Barnett Newman's Broken Obelisk as a partial gift to the city of Houston in 1969, on the condition that it be dedicated to the recently assassinated Martin Luther King Jr.Richard, Paul. ‚ÄúWhy Not Dedicate Art to King, De Menil Asks City Council.‚Äù Houston Chronicle, August 20, 1969.

J. ‚ÄúInstitute of Religion Accepts Controversial ‚ÄòBroken Obelisk.‚Äô‚Äù Houston Chronicle, August 26, 1969. The de Menils had originally made plans to build the Rothko Chapel in 1964 when Dominique de Menil commissioned a suite of meditative paintings by Mark Rothko for an ecumenical chapel intended for the University of St. Thomas as a space of dialogue and reflection between faiths. After undergoing revisions by several architects, including Philip Johnson, Howard Barnstone, and Eugene Aubry, the non-denominational Rothko Chapel was dedicated on Menil Foundation property in 1971 in a ceremony that included members of various religions.Barnes, Susan J. The Rothko Chapel: An Act of Faith. Houston: Rothko Chapel, 1989. It was established as an autonomous organization the next year and began hosting colloquia, beginning with \\"Traditional Modes of Contemplation and Action,\\" which brought together religious leaders, scholars, and musicians from four continents.Ibish, Yusuf, and Peter Lamborn Wilson, eds. Traditional Modes of Contemplation and Action. Tehran: Imperial Iranian Academy of Philosophy, 1977. The de Menils also organized exhibitions that promoted human and civil rights, including \\"The De Luxe Show,\\" a 1971 exhibition of contemporary art held in Houston's Fifth Ward, a historically African-American neighborhood. Coordinated by civil rights activist and later U.S. Congressman Mickey Leland, it was one of the first racially integrated art shows in the United States.Butterfield, Jan. ‚ÄúThe Deluxe Show.‚Äù Texas Observer, September 24, 1971. In 1986, de Menil deepened her involvement in social causes, establishing the Carter-Menil Human Rights Foundation with former president Jimmy Carter to \\"promote the protection of human rights throughout the world.\\" The Foundation offered the Carter‚ÄìMenil Human Rights Prize, sponsored by the Rothko Chapel, to organizations or individuals for their commitment to human rights. She also established the √ìscar Romero Award, named after the slain El Salvadoran bishop. Plans for a museum Southeast corner of the Menil Collection, Houston Plans to create a museum to house and exhibit John and Dominique de Menil's collection began as early as 1972 when they asked the architect Louis I. Kahn to design a museum campus on Menil Foundation property in the Montrose neighborhood of Houston near the Rothko Chapel. Kahn did produce some preliminary drawings, but the project was suspended in 1973 after John de Menil's and Kahn's deaths less than a year apart.Elliott, Clare. The Menil Collection: Art Spaces. London: Scala; Houston: Menil Foundation, Inc., 2007. In the 1980s de Menil again began looking for an architect to design the museum, eventually commissioning Renzo Piano, a renowned Italian architect known for his provocative Centre Georges Pompidou building in Paris, to come up with a design that would fit her vision for the museum. \\"I dreamed of preserving some of the intimacy I had enjoyed with works of art,\\" she wrote. \\"We would show only portions of the Collection at a time, but displayed in generous and attractive space... The public would never know museum fatigue and would have the rare joy of sitting in front of a painting and contemplating it... Works would appear, disappear, and reappear like actors on a stage.\\" Piano's understated design for the Menil Collection echoed the architecture of the surrounding bungalows, which had been painted gray by the Menil Foundation, and featured a roof of canopy leaves that allowed filtered natural light to fill the galleries.Ingersoll, Richard. ‚ÄúPianissimo: The Very Quiet Menil Collection.‚Äù Texas Architect 37 (May/June 1987): 40‚Äì47. The result was a museum that appeared \\"small on the outside, but...as big as possible inside.\\"Tomkins, Calvin. ‚ÄúThe Benefactor.‚Äù The New Yorker, June 8, 1998: 52‚Äì67. Dedicated on June 7, 1987, the Menil Collection exhibits objects from John and Dominique de Menil's collection, including selections of African Art, a vast collection of Surrealist pieces, and the work of a number of contemporary American artists such as Jackson Pollock, Barnett Newman, Clyfford Still, Robert Motherwell, Cy Twombly, and Mark Rothko. It also features temporary exhibitions. It is often cited as one of the most significant privately assembled art collections, alongside the Barnes Foundation and the J. Paul Getty Museum.Holmes, Ann, and Patricia C. Johnson. Articles in Zest section ‚ÄúThe Menil Opens.‚Äù Houston Chronicle, June 7, 1987. The nearby Cy Twombly Gallery, opened in 1995, houses more than thirty of Twombly's paintings, sculptures, and works on paper. Designed by Renzo Piano, the permanent gallery echoes some of the architectural features of the Menil Collection, such as the use of diffused natural light, while retaining its own, separate identity. The Menil campus also includes the Byzantine Fresco Chapel. When de Menil learned that a group of 13th-century Byzantine frescoes had been stolen from a chapel in Lysi, Cyprus, and cut up by smugglers, she paid the ransom and funded their restoration. In return for her efforts, the Holy Bishopric of Cyprus allowed the works to remain in Houston on a 20-year loan.Carr, Annemarie Weyl, and Laurence J. Morrocco. A Byzantine Masterpiece Recovered:The Thirteenth-Century Murals of Lysi, Cyprus. Austin: University of Texas Press, 1991. The frescoes‚Äîa dome with Christ Pantokrator and an apse depicting the Virgin Mary Panayia‚Äîwere installed in a reliquary-like space interior where they were displayed until March 2012, at which time they were returned to the Church of Cyprus. The building was designed by architect Francois de Menil and mimics the original Lysi chapel.Giovannini, Joseph. ‚ÄúModern Reliquary: In a New Houston Museum, Francois de Menil Crafts an Authentic Setting for Two Byzantine Frescoes.‚Äù Architecture 86 (April 1997): 68‚Äì75. De Menil's final project was a 1996 commission of three site-specific light installations by Minimalist sculptor Dan Flavin for Richmond Hall, a former Weingarten's grocery store in Houston. The Dan Flavin installation consists of two horizontal green fluorescent lights on the eastern and western sides of the building's exterior, two sets of diagonal white lights on the foyer walls, and a large work in the main interior space featuring pink, yellow, green, blue, and ultraviolet lights. Also on display in Richmond Hall are four examples of Flavin's \\"monuments\\" to V. Tatlin, created between 1964 and 1969. De Menil died in Houston on December 31, 1997.

An all-rounder, he is a left-handed batsman and right-arm off-spinner, who played county cricket for Warwickshire before moving to Worcestershire after the 2006 season. Ali has represented England in all formats of the game. He won Warwickshire's NBC Denis Compton Award in both 2004 and 2005 and Worcestershire's NBC Denis Compton Award in 2009. His off spin is marked by a strongly spun off break and a well-concealed arm ball. He was named one of the Cricketers of the Year in the 2015 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. Moeen was part of the England squad that won the 2019 Cricket World Cup. On 8 September 2020, in the third Twenty20 International (T20I) match against Australia, Ali captained England for the first time in a T20I match. Early life Ali was born in Birmingham. He is of Pakistani descent; his grandfather migrated to England from Mirpur. His grandmother, Betty Cox, was of British origin. He can understand Urdu and Punjabi. He became known fondly as ‚Äòthe beard that's feared‚Äô at New Road. Ali's father worked as a taxi driver, and as a psychiatric nurse. He grew up on the same street as fellow cricketers Kabir Ali (his first cousin), Naqash Tahir, and Rawait Khan. His brothers Kadeer and Omar are also cricketers. Career =Warwickshire= Ali signed for Warwickshire aged just 15, hitting a half-century for the county's Second XI a few days before his 16th birthday. After more games at this level in 2004, and a first outing for England Under-19s against their Bangladeshi counterparts he spent the succeeding winter playing for the Under-19s on their tour of India. 2005 saw Ali make his first-class debut, against Cambridge University in May. He impressed with the bat, making 57 not out in his only innings, and sent down two overs for 15 runs. Playing that summer against Sri Lankan Under-19s, he starred in the final \\"Test\\" by making 52 not out and 100 not out (the latter innings from 56 balls) and claiming seven wickets. He was then selected for the 2006 Under-19 Cricket World Cup, which was held in Sri Lanka, and was immediately promoted to captain by coach Andy Pick. He made three half- centuries in the tournament, and took seven wickets. Ali received additional opportunities for his county in 2006, playing his first List A games. The first of these came against Derbyshire, where he dismissed Steffan Jones to claim his maiden first-team wicket. He also took his first wickets in first- class cricket, and his first three victims were all Test players: Stuart Law, Dominic Cork and Dave Mohammed. With the bat he scored 68 on his County Championship debut against Nottinghamshire, then equalled that score against Durham. Ali's opportunities were somewhat limited, however, and Alex Loudon took his place in the side. In July 2006, with the expiry of his Warwickshire contract only months away, Ali brushed off rumours of a move to Worcestershire, saying \\"I don't know anything about it\\", but in September it was announced that Ali would indeed be leaving to join that county. The player himself said that he had been impressed by Worcestershire and felt it gave him the best prospects of furthering his career. =Worcestershire= He made his debut for Worcestershire in their ten-wicket win over Loughborough UCCE on 25 April 2007. Ali's highest first-class score of 250, scored against Glamorgan at New Road, featured a partnership of 219 with Matt Pardoe. At the end of the 2010 season Worcestershire secured promotion to the first division of the County Championship. After he was overlooked by the England Lions and England Performance Programme at the end of the 2010 English season, Moeen opted to play club cricket in Bangladesh at the suggestion of Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan. Shakib played for Worcestershire as their overseas player in 2010 and the link with the club led to Moeen representing Mohammedan Sporting Club in the Ispahani Premier Division. 2011 season During the 2011 season, Moeen spent three weeks as Worcestershire's acting captain while the usual club captain, Daryl Mitchell, was injured. Though he had captained England Under-19s, it was the first time he filled the role for his county. As he was inexperienced, Moeen approached senior players Vikram Solanki and Ben Scott for advice. Pakistan off-spinner Saeed Ajmal was Worcestershire's overseas player for a short time in 2011 and while at the club he encouraged Moeen to try bowling the doosra. Moeen had to wait until July before registering his first century of the season, and his first since September the previous year. His innings of 158 runs from 244 balls against Somerset was in vain as Worcestershire succumbed to an innings defeat. The following month Moeen twice scored a century in the Clydesdale Bank 40 only for Worcestershire to lose, against Sussex and the Netherlands. In the first match against Sussex he passed his previous best score of 136 in List A cricket, scoring 158 runs from 92 balls. In Worcestershire's first season back in the first division, Moeen scored 930 runs in the County Championship, making him the club's second-highest run scorer in the competition behind Solanki. Moeen average 33.21 runs per innings and scored a single century. On the back of his performances for Worcestershire, Moeen was included in the 13-man England Development squad which trained in late 2011. 2012 season In February 2012, before the start of the English season, Worcestershire's director of cricket Steve Rhodes commented that Ali's doosra was \\"not too difficult to pick at the moment but he's learning a few tricks and he's got other things up his sleeve. It's a work in progress\\". 2013 season After the departure of former he met a cricket coach England international Vikram Solanki at the end of the 2012 season Ali was handed a new 5-year contract. After performing well, including five consecutive 50s, Ali was called up to the England Lions where he scored 61 runs against Australia with many calling for him to be selected for the full side. Moeen averaged 62 in Division 2, totalling 1375 runs altogether ‚Äì the highest of any batsmen in first-class cricket and finished with 4 centuries and 8 fifties as well as 28 wickets. He was awarded county cricket's MVP award beating Samit Patel on the final day of the season and was also named PCA player of the year. Ali was also called up to the England development squad ahead of their Australian Ashes tour. International career Moeen Ali playing for England in 2014 =2014= Ali was included in the English Squad for the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 in Bangladesh. Before the tournament, the squad played the West Indies in a limited overs series, and Ali made his ODI debut against the West Indies on 28 February 2014.

In the first Test against India, Ali took four wickets in the match, as well as scoring 14 with the bat. In the second match he made scores of 32 and 39, but could not prevent England from losing to go 1‚Äì0 down in the series. In the third test against India at the Ageas Bowl, he took his first 5 wicket haul in test cricket, finishing with 6‚Äì67 in India's second innings. He followed this up by taking figures of 4‚Äì39 in the fourth test, taking the prized wicket of MS Dhoni. This helped England win the game and take a 2‚Äì1 series lead. Ali only played a small part in the final match of the series, making 14 with the bat as England steamrolled India to win the series 3‚Äì1. Ali did not play in the first three ODIs against India. However, he was selected for the fourth match of the series and hit a quick fire 67. However, this was not enough to prevent a nine wicket defeat for England. In the final match of the series Ali took 2‚Äì34 to help England win their first match of the series. In the first ODI of the seven-match series in Sri Lanka, Ali hit 119 off just 87 balls although it was not enough to prevent a defeat for England.

In the first innings, Ali took figures of 1‚Äì47, and was run out for a duck. In the West Indies' second innings his bowling figures were 3/51, and he was not required to bat in England's second innings as they went on to secure a nine wicket victory to lead the series 1‚Äì0. In the third Test Moeen made 58 in the first innings. However, he was disappointing with the ball, taking just one wicket. Moeen took 1‚Äì54 in the second innings as the West Indies won to level the series at 1‚Äì1. In the first Test against New Zealand, Moeen scored 58 in England first innings to help them fight back to post 389. He then took three wickets in New Zealand's innings.

Wrist band controversy Moeen Ali wore \\"Save Gaza\\" and \\"Free Palestine\\" wristbands in connection with the Gaza conflict during day 2 of the third Test match of the 2014 series against India. The ICC code bars players from \\"conveying messages which relate to political, religious or racial activities or causes\\". According to the ECB, Moeen's stance was \\"humanitarian, not political\\" and a spokesman stated that \\"the ECB do not believe he has committed any offence.\\" Although Moeen had been cleared by the ECB to wear the bands, the decision was overruled by the match referee, David Boon. Charity work Ali is an Ambassador of StreetChance, a programme providing free weekly cricket coaching sessions in deprived areas in the UK, run by the Cricket Foundation and Barclays Spaces For Sports. In January 2015, he joined Orphans in Need, an international NGO, as a Global Brand Ambassador and carried the charity's logo on his bat. Speaking after his stint at the crease, Moeen Ali said, ‚ÄúI enjoy coming back to the community where I grew up playing tapeball cricket. It keeps you grounded.

Biography Jurinac was born in Travnik, Bosnia-Herzegovina (then part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia), the daughter of a Croatian father (a doctor) and a Viennese mother. She studied at the Zagreb Academy of Music, and with Milka Kostrenƒçiƒá. Her voice was pitched exactly between soprano and mezzo. Her repertoire included Poppea, Elisabetta (Don Carlos), Desdemona (Otello), Elisabeth (Tannh√§user), Ilia, Iphigenia, Jen≈Øfa, Leonora (La forza del destino), the Composer (Ariadne auf Naxos), Marie (Wozzeck), Pamina (The Magic Flute), Mimi, Butterfly and Tosca. In many operas, her repertoire included more than one major role: Cherubino and Countess Almaviva, Donna Anna and Donna Elvira, Fiordiligi and Dorabella, Amor and Eurydice, Leonore and Marzelline (Fidelio), Marina and Fyodor (Boris Godunov); Octavian and the Marschallin. She also played supporting roles in The Ring of the Nibelung: Woglinde, Gutrune and several of the Norns.G√∂tterd√§mmerung: Orchestra Sinfonica e Coro Della Radio Italiana directed by Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler, - 1953, Roma. Recording RAI - Radiotelevisione Italiana - published by EMI Records (C) 1972. She d√©buted as Mimi at Zagreb in 1942. In the following two years she sang the Countess, Freia, and Isabella in the premi√®re of Werner Egk's Columbus. In 1943, she was summer student of Anna von Mildenburg at the Salzburg Mozarteum. She appeared in the first Croatian sound movie, Lisinski (1944). In 1944, the Vienna State Opera engaged her, where she was first nicknamed \\"Sena\\". Conductor Karl B√∂hm's secretary suggested it because she feared the pronunciation of \\"Srebrenka\\" would cause difficulties for many Austrians. Because of the war, and the consequential closing of the opera three days after her arrival, she was unable to sing at the Vienna State Opera until 1946, when her first role was Cherubino. In the first year at the Staatsoper, she sang more than 150 performances. She remained associated with the company for almost four decades, receiving an honorary membership of the company with the title of Kammers√§ngerin. In the autumn of 1947, she appeared at Covent Garden with others of the Vienna company, singing Dorabella. Her Salzburg Festival d√©but was in 1947. She appeared at La Scala as Cherubino, and became established as one of the Wiener Ensemble (together with Irmgard Seefried, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Christa Ludwig, Lisa della Casa, Anton Dermota and others). In 1951, she recorded Richard Strauss's Four Last Songs, shortly after Kirsten Flagstad had sung the world premiere in London. She often visited England, where between 1951 and 1956 she sang the principal Mozart soprano roles at Glyndebourne, recording both the Countess in Figaro and Ilia in Idomeneo. She appeared regularly at Covent Garden between 1959 and 1963, singing Leonore in Fidelio under Otto Klemperer in 1961. Her American d√©but was in the title role of Madama Butterfly, in San Francisco in 1959. Her portrayal of Octavian is preserved in the Paul Czinner film of Der Rosenkavalier, conducted by Herbert von Karajan with Schwarzkopf as the Marschallin. Her final operatic performance was as the Marschallin at the Vienna State Opera in November 1982. She continued to give recitals and master classes, and served on the juries of international singing competitions. Jurinac was married twice. Her first marriage was to the Italian baritone Sesto Bruscantini from 1953 to 1956. The marriage ended in divorce. In 1965, she married Josef Lederle, and the marriage lasted until his death in 2005. She left no immediate survivors.

Crusader was heavily armed and was used in a \\"gunboat diplomacy\\" role when the United States needed to place political pressure on Paraguay. After completing that mission, she returned to the United States to participate as a gunboat in the blockade of the Confederate States of America. Construction and commercial start Originally named Chowan the ship was launched in 1857 in Murfreesboro, North Carolina. Four months later, its draftsman and builder, John K. Kirkham filed papers at the Hertford County Court for a lien for payment of $4,996 owed to him by the North Carolina and New York Steamship Company. She was seized by Sheriff John A. Vann. In February 1858, a jury awarded $2,287.36 to Kirkham and the court ordered that the ship be sold at auction on 4 May. Chowan was purchased by John W. Southall and Capt. Thomas W. Badger and renamed Southern Star. In early 1858 she was towed to Delaware where she was fitted with engines. She then steamed to Norfolk in September 1858 under her own power for final outfitting for hauling freight between the West Indies and ports along the east coast of North America.  The Paraguay expedition and purchase by the Navy The US Navy approached its owners and chartered the vessel in October 1858 to be part of a 19 ship squadron military-diplomatic expedition to Paraguay to settle grievances growing out of an unprovoked attack on Water Witch by Paraguayan forces in 1855. Commissioned 27 October 1858, Commander A. M. Pennock in command, Southern Star sailed 2 November for Asunci√≥n, Paraguay, arriving 25 January 1859. Her mission accomplished, she departed from Montevideo, Uruguay, 22 March to return to Norfolk's Gosport Navy Yard. Satisfied with her performance, she was purchased by the Navy for $49,000 and renamed Crusader. She was outfitted as a gunboat at Gosport with four 12-pound cannons and numerous lighter arms. On 11 June 1859, Lieutenant John N. Maffitt was assigned as her first commanding officer as Crusader. She left the Brooklyn Navy Yard for naval service in August 1859.  Suppressing the slave trade  Crusader cleared Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 7 October 1859 for duty with the Home Squadron in the suppression of the slave trade in West Indian waters until 7 February 1861, returning to New York City 16 February. She made national headlines when on 23 May 1860 she intercepted a slave ship carrying 450 Africans, the first of the four slave traders and one pirate ship she apprehended.  Civil War operations  Following another tour of duty in the Gulf of Mexico from 16 March to 28 August 1861, during which she captured two vessels to prevent their sale for use as Confederate privateers, she was placed out of commission 17 September 1861 for repairs. = Assigned to the South Atlantic blockade = Crusader sailed 18 January 1862 to join the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. She cruised off the South Carolina coast until 10 August. With E. B. Hale she conducted a successful expedition up the South Edisto River on 28 April to capture a Confederate battery, the officers and men of both ships earning a commendation from the Secretary of the Navy for their courageous conduct. On a similar raid Crusader and Planter drove off a band of Confederates from Simmons' Bluff and destroyed their camp on 21 June. = Assigned to the North Atlantic blockade = After repairs at New York, Crusader put to sea 22 September 1862 to join the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. She was diverted to duty in the Chesapeake Bay and inland waters of Virginia and served in this area until the end of the war. She captured five vessels with valuable cargoes and destroyed four others.  Post-war decommissioning  Crusader was decommissioned at Washington Navy Yard 13 June 1865 and sold there 20 July 1865.

He was famous for his classical and sensual lyrics, and it is believed that he composed over thousand songs in his lifetime. Early life and career He was born in Harmelah (Herm√™le), a small village near the city of Bukan, northwestern Iran. Zirek was born to Abdulla Zirek and Amina, the title of his name was Erlume from his father which means, \\"clever\\" in Kurdish and some contribute it to his fathers talents and abilities that he showed during his work in the Xan of the Agha of Herm√™le. Hassan had also a brother and sister, Hussein and Mina. He was only 5 years old when his father died. His mother remarried shortly after his father's death leaving Hassan emotionally broken down. At the age of 12 he began to work for the Agha of Herm√™le, at which his voice was a major source for the entertainment of the people in the villages. After one year he left the village he was born in, and headed to the main Kurdish-inhabited cities and worked in restaurants. He showed his singing talents in his early age. In 1953, at the age of 27, he left Harmelah and recorded a great number of songs in Kurdish for the Kurdish section of the Baghdad broadcasting station. Most of his songs were remade version of Kurdish folklore songs and he was very talented in it. After the Iraq's Revolution in 1958, Zirek was expelled from Iraq. He moved to Tehran where he was employed by Tehran Radio Station. This is where he met his wife Medya Zendi. After spending few years in his native Iran and recording some of his unbeatable hits, Zirek was again forced to leave in 1960. Instead of Baghdad, this time he made his way to northern Iraq (i.e. present-day Iraqi Kurdistan), where he worked with the Kurdish Fine Art Groups. As an artist who is known to have his home packed on his back, Zirek was forced to leave northern Iraq in 1967. Departing there, this time he went to Saqqez in Iran where he lived up to his death. In 1971 Zirek was hospitalised and was diagnosed with stage four cancer. He spent countless nights at the hospital in Urmia and Bukan. Hassan Zirak died at the age of fifty. His body is buried around his native city Bukan, on Nalashkenah (Kurdish: Nalishk√™ne) mountain one of the most famous mountains of the region which lies close to the city. Although Hesen Zirek was an illiterate musician and had an unbearable and short life, he composed around 1500 songs, most of which were composed, worded and sang simultaneously (free style folk singer). Zirak is considered as one of the most popular and well known singers among the Kurdish people in all of Northern and Eastern Kurdistan. Hassan Zirek Hassan Zirak has songs with other famous singers like Mamle, Mala Hussain Abdulzada, Osman Bukani, and Ahmed Shamal. The song \\" Mal√Æ Babim Be Wefa \\" is one of the songs that Hassan Zirak recorded along with Mamle and Mala Hussain Abdulzada in 1960 with the help of \\" Kirmansha Musical Group \\". Besides his native Sorani Kurdish, he also sang in other languages such as Azeri, Turkish, and Persian.

She sang professionally for more than thirty years, with a repertoire that ranged from operetta to contemporary works. After retiring from the stage, she started teaching. Mespl√© was the archetype of a light coloratura soprano: technically secure, musically distinctive, and with a charming stage presence. When she developed Parkinson's disease in the mid-1990s, she responded by writing a book about her career and the development of her illness.  Biography  Born Madeleine Mespl√© in Toulouse on 7 March 1931, she came from a modest family background. Her father Pierre was an accountant and her mother Yvonne (Sesquiere) a secretary.\\"Mady Mespl√©, French Soprano With a Silvery Voice, Dies at 89,\\" The New York Times, June 18, 2020. She took up music at the age of four, and her mother's recognition of her promise, confirmed by a teacher, led her to attend the music conservatory of her native city from the age of seven. She studied piano and voice, graduating with a gold medal. She played the piano in a local ballroom orchestra for a while and later left for Paris for complementary voice lessons with French soprano Janine Micheau. Mespl√© made her professional debut in Li√®ge in January 1953, in the title role of Lakm√© by Delibes, a role with which she remained closely associated throughout her career, singing it an estimated 145 times. Lakm√© was also her debut role at La Monnaie in Brussels in 1954. She quickly established herself in the standard lyric and coloratura roles of the French repertoire, such as Olympia in The Tales of Hoffmann, Philline in Mignon, Leila in Les p√™cheurs de perles, Juliette in Rom√©o et Juliette, Oph√©lie in Hamlet, the title roles of Dinorah and Manon, and Sophie in Werther. She made her debut at the Aix-en-Provence Festival in 1956, as Z√©mire in Gr√©try's Z√©mire et Azor. The same year she first sang at the Op√©ra- Comique, again as Lakm√©. Her Palais Garnier debut took place in 1958, as Constance in Poulenc's Dialogues des Carm√©lites. There in 1960, she took over from Joan Sutherland in a new production of Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor. Other Italian roles included Amina in Bellini's La sonnambula, Rosina in Rossini's Il barbiere di Siviglia, Norina in Donizetti's Don Pasquale and Gilda in Verdi's Rigoletto. She sang only a few German roles: the Queen of the Night in Mozart's Die Zauberfl√∂te, Sophie in Der Rosenkavalier, and Zerbinetta in Ariadne auf Naxos, both by Richard Strauss. Mespl√© also enjoyed a successful career abroad, appearing at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, the Royal Opera House in London, La Scala in Milan, the Metropolitan Opera in New York, where she appeared as Gilda, and Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires. During the 1960s, Mespl√© appeared frequently on French television and started exploring works by contemporary musicians. Charles Chaynes composed his Four Poems of Sappho for her, and in 1963 she appeared as Kitty in the French premiere of Gian Carlo Menotti's The Last Savage. She was also the first to sing the French version of Henze's Elegy for Young Lovers in 1965, and Pierre Boulez chose Mespl√© for his performances of Schoenberg's Jacob's Ladder. During the 1970s she added operettas to her repertoire, especially by Jacques Offenbach, such as La Vie parisienne, Orph√©e aux enfers and La Grande-Duchesse de G√©rolstein, opposite R√©gine Crespin. Mespl√© retired from the stage in 1985 and turned to teaching at the √âcole Normale de Musique de Paris and at the Music Conservatory of Lyon. After her retirement, she continued to perform recitals until the early 1990s. Mespl√© left a discography encompassing opera, operetta, and m√©lodies, including complete opera and operetta recordings of rarely performed works such as Auber's Fra Diavolo and Manon Lescaut, Lecocq's La fille de Madame Angot, Planquette's Les cloches de Corneville, Ganne's Les saltimbanques, Messager's V√©ronique, and Hahn's Ciboulette. She recorded Lakm√©, alongside Charles Burles and Roger Soyer, conducted by Alain Lombard. The archetype of the light French coloratura soprano, Mady Mespl√© was noted for her technical security, musical refinement and charming stage presence. Her voice was particularly recognisable for its quick vibrato, intensely focused intonation, the instrumental-like quality of her runs and an amazing upper register extending easily to high A-flat. The French baritone Ludovic T√©zier tweeted after her death: \\"\\". (\\"Mady Mespl√© has flown away, lightly as elegance\\".)

Early life Hobart Edward Freeman was born in Ewing, Kentucky, and grew up at St. Petersburg, Florida, where he became a successful businessman after studying at Bryant and Stratton Business Institute, despite being a high school dropout.\\"Biblical Thinking and Confession: The Key to Victorious Living 365 Days a Year\\" By Hobart E. Freeman, Faith Publications, Warsaw IN 197?, back cover. He also contracted polio,John F. MacArthur in Charismatic Chaos says that (p237) \\"Hobart Freeman's theology did not let him acknowledge that polio had left one of his legs disfigured and lame. 'I have my healing' is all he would say when anyone pointed out the rather conspicuous inconsistency between his own physical disabilities and his teaching.\\" and in later years \\"... walked stiffly ... with an obvious limp.\\" \\"Never Far From Home\\" by Cindy Barnett, Selah Publishing Group, Surprise, Arizona, page 72 Freeman was converted to Christ in 1952 at the age of 31, and baptized into a congregation within the Southern Baptist Convention. Shortly before Freeman received \\"the baptism in the Holy Spirit\\", he survived a heart attack. He \\"claimed\\" his healing, disposed of his medications, and almost immediately suffered a series of angina attacks, which eventually subsided.\\"Biblical Thinking and Confession: The Key to Victorious Living 365 Days a Year\\" By Hobart E. Freeman, Faith Publications, Warsaw IN nd, pages 49 & 50\\\\. Note: The word \\"claimed\\" in this context does NOT mean he claimed that he was healed, but rather that he claimed the promise of healing that he believed was in the atonement. As such, the word is used in a theological sense rather than in an everyday sense. Freeman felt called to the ministry, and educated at the Georgetown College with a Bible and History major, and then at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary (A.B., Th.M.) with an Old Testament major. In 1961, he earned a Doctorate of Theology from Grace Theological Seminary in Winona Lake, Indiana with a thesis entitled \\"The Doctrine of Substitution in the Old Testament\\",Co-authors of this thesis included Richard Michalak, Charles Ware, George Brost, George A Brost and Kevin Magde. and was appointed a professor of Hebrew and Old Testament Studies, and Philosophy and Ethics. Teaching and preaching According to John Davis, Freeman came to be deeply influenced by Kenneth E. Hagin, John Osteen, Kenneth Copeland, T.L. Osborn and E.W. Kenyon, who were leaders of the Word of Faith Movement.\\"Freeman: Mystic, Monk, or Minister?\\" by John Davis, Warsaw (Indiana) Times Union 27 September 1983, page 1a However Freeman explicitly rejected their Doctrine of Identification, which asserted that Jesus died spiritually,\\"Did Jesus Die Spiritually? Exposing the JDS Heresy\\" by Hobart E. Freeman, Faith Publications, Warsaw n.d. and he also repeatedly warned his congregation about the leaders and their teachings.\\"Died Jesus Die Spiritually?\\" by Hobart Freeman, tape number 332, n.d. Freeman's opposition to that doctrine was confirmed by Daniel McConnell.\\"A Different Gospel: A Historical and Biblical Analysis of the Modern Faith Movement\\" by Daniel R. McConnell, Hendrickson Publishers Peabody MA 1988 page 131 However McConnell also described Freeman as a \\"renegade preacher of the Faith movement\\"\\"A Different Gospel: A Historical and Biblical Analysis of the Modern Faith Movement\\" by Daniel R. McConnell, Hendrickson Publishers Peabody MA 1988 page xix who \\"eventually broke with the other Faith teachers\\".\\"A Different Gospel: A Historical and Biblical Analysis of the Modern Faith Movement\\" by Daniel R. McConnell, Hendrickson Publishers Peabody MA 1988 page 82. While the exact details continue to be debated, it is not unreasonable to include Freeman within the orbit of the Word of Faith Movement, as he also taught that healing was \\"promised in the atonement\\",Healing in the Atonement by Hobart Freeman, tape number 115, nd and in Faith for Healing, where he also taught that \\"Confession brings possession, for what you confess is your faith speaking.\\" \\"Faith for Healing\\" by Hobart E. Freeman, Faith Ministries and Publications, Warsaw IN nd page 10 These latter ideas aroused much opposition within the seminary, and Freeman was asked to leave in 1963.However Freeman said, while giving his testimony, that he was asked to leave the seminary due to his conservative view of scripture. See \\"Testimony of Hobart Freeman\\" by Hobart Freeman, tape number 111, n.d. Freeman established his own congregation, subsequently known as Faith Assembly, with Melvin Greider Melvin Lee Greider (b.23 April 1936 d.16 April 1980) served in the US Navy and became a biker and alcoholic before he converted to Christ. He died of a heart attack, and was buried in Oak Grove Cemetery, which is located at the intersection of Epworth Forest and County Road 975 East in Tippicanoe Township. See Tippecanoe Township Cemeteries Online in 1963 in his own home at Winona Lake in nearby Kosciusko County. And for many years, worked 15‚Äì16 hours a day, seven days a week with seemingly indeflatable energy,\\"Biblical Thinking and Confession: The Key to Victorious Living 365 Days a Year\\" By Hobart E. Freeman, Faith Publications, Warsaw IN 197?, page 21. and at one point visited Israel.\\"Biblical Thinking and Confession: The Key to Victorious Living 365 Days a Year\\" By Hobart E. Freeman, Faith Publications, Warsaw IN 197?, pages 51 and 52. Within a few years, Freeman established a house church at Claypool in a \\"pink house next to the water tower\\", where the meetings followed a simple format: > After much singing and what sounded like people quoting the Bible, a tall > lanky man, who looked remarkably like Billy Graham, walked stiffly to the > front with an obvious limp. He was the pastor, Dr. Hobart Freeman, and he > commanded everyone's attention. He had a Ph.D. in theology, and he was > teaching the last in a series of messages on the book of Revelation. He > spoke for an hour or more about the end of the world and the new heavens and > the new earth. He spoke with the conviction that all these things were going > to happen just like the Bible said. ... That night ... [the] singing was > even livelier than early that morning, and the message was about faith. This > church believed that God would really answer their prayers if they just > believed. The pastor told stories of people being healed of sickness and > being protected in storms by commanding the winds to stop. He believed that > his leg would be healed from the polio he had had years before. ... At the > end of the service, we went to the front for prayers ....Never Far From Home > by Cindy Barnett, Selah Publishing Group, Surprise, Arizona, 2005, p72 From there the church moved to a three-car garage, then on to an old sheep barn near North Webster where they had been holding a coffeehouse ministry on Friday nights. The barn was owned by a burly, whiskery biker, Melvin Greider nicknamed Mack, a former alcoholic who had become a Christian, and was named the \\"Glory Barn\\" by Freeman. This ministry attracted hundreds of people, including some misfits but most were normal, serious-minded young adults. The local people referred to the Glory Barn in derision and spread exaggerated rumours about what was done there.Never Far From Home by Cindy Barnett, Selah Publishing Group, Surprise, Arizona, 2005, p81 This was not the opinion of those who sat under this ministry: > As we sat under Dr. Freeman's ministry, we saw his genius as a teacher. His > theology was as solid as a Baptist minister, but he had the fire of a > Pentecostal maverick like Smith Wigglesworth or William Branham. And he had > the guts of the early martyrs. His manner was bookish, but he was such a > skilled teacher that he kept our attention long enough to teach us biblical > theology in terms we could understand. We eventually heard him teach on > every passage in the Bible, and he backed up his positions, putting them in > the context of church history and current events. All the reasoning was so > logical it appealed to our minds as well as our hearts. Eventually both the upper and lower levels of the Glory Barn were filled to overflowing. The floorboards bent and shook dangerously as the congregation danced \\"charismatic jigs\\" to the praise songs. They would travel long distances and stand in long lines early each Sunday morning to ensure a good seat. The many young assistant pastors had reserved seats up front.Never Far From Home by Cindy Barnett, Selah Publishing Group, Surprise, Arizona, 2005, p84 These young pastors travelled and spoke at meetings over a wide area. There was a worldwide following through his tapes and books.Never Far From Home by Cindy Barnett, Selah Publishing Group, Surprise, Arizona, 2005, p86 There were some 15,000 in daughter congregations elsewhere in Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan, Missouri, Tennessee and Florida, as well as in England, Australia, Canada, Switzerland and Germany. Freeman also began teaching college-level classes on Saturday mornings covering Old and New Testament theology, Christian ethics, church history and even Hebrew.Never Far From Home by Cindy Barnett, Selah Publishing Group, Surprise, Arizona, 2005, p83 In 1978 after conflict with the owner, Freeman took the congregation to a large circus tent just north of Warsaw and then on to another near Goshen throughout that summer and autumn. There was little protection from the wind and rain or the heat and cold. The nursery was a row of vans for the mothers and babies. Portable toilets were the only facilities. By winter a meeting hall had been built near North Webster in a cornfield belonging to one of the congregation.Don Nei has been suggested as the donor of the land for the new building, but no source was cited. There were large bathrooms, a nursery for the mothers and babies, and a meeting room large enough to hold 2,000 people which was often overflowing. It wasn't fancy for the floors were cement, and the walls were bare.Never Far From Home by Cindy Barnett, Selah Publishing Group, Surprise, Arizona, 2005, p85, 105At the end of the summer of 1980 there was an epidemic of whooping cough that seemed to go through all the families of the congregation.Never Far From Home by Cindy Barnett, Selah Publishing Group, Surprise, Arizona, 2005, p109 Like many charismatic congregations, the work of the Holy Spirit was emphasized - with claims of prophesy, miraculous healings, testimonies, speaking in tongues and believers being slain in the Spirit.Never Far From Home by Cindy Barnett, Selah Publishing Group, Surprise, Arizona, 2005, p85, 105 Freeman's teaching emphasized the deeper life in the Spirit, overcoming all things, separation from the world and its ways, trusting only in God for all things, the crucified life, and the true meaning of discipleship, as seen in the topics covered by his teaching tapes and literature. The authority of Freeman's teaching was regularly reinforced by his \\"prophecies\\", published with meeting notices. Hobart Freeman - Prophecy to the Congregation - 15 January 1984. Freeman's teaching also generated a social dimension. A sense of community care, cohesion, exclusiveness, superiority and persecution grew with the breadth, authority and enthusiasm of his teaching. Those with divergent doctrines, beliefs or practices either conformed or were excluded. Outside interactions grew less and were sometimes severed over these issues. Evangelical outreach shrivelled. So while legalism was denounced from the pulpit, it was practiced amongst the congregation to the extent that it has been described as \\"cultist tendencies\\".Never Far From Home by Cindy Barnett, Selah Publishing Group, Surprise, Arizona, 2005, p78, 81, 85, 86, 87 These teachings were comprehensive and logical, including the roles of women, music, jobs, medical science, government, the military, education, birth control, sports and holidays. Christmas was condemned as a pagan festival. A woman's role in the home as a wife and mother was seen to be the most noble and worthiest of callings. Children were regarded as a blessing from God and birth control was actively discouraged.Never Far From Home by Cindy Barnett, Selah Publishing Group, Surprise, Arizona, 2005, p74, 83, 86, 101, 110, 111 This led to a certain degree of uniformity within the congregation: > People outside Faith Assembly joked that we all looked alike. A typical > Faith Assembly family on their way to church consisted of a man, who was > probably a construction worker, carrying a notebook and Bible under one arm > and a diaper bag over his shoulder. He would be walking with his wife, who > would be wearing a denim skirt and carrying a baby, with several other kids > in tow. They would drive a van. Christianity Today reported that \\"According to Freeman's faith-formula theology, God is obligated to heal every sickness if a believer's faith is genuine. Faith must be accompanied by positive confession, meaning that believers must claim the healing by acknowledging that it has taken place.\\"Christianity Today, November 23, 1984 This understanding was more or less accepted by the pastorate, with the wife of one recalling that \\"Dr. Freeman taught that it was always God's will to heal in response to our faith, and that God would do it without the aid of doctors or medicine.\\" \\"Never Far From Home\\" by Cindy Barnett, Selah Publishing Group, Surprise, Arizona, 2005 page 86. In consequence, doctors and medicine came to be disparaged and reviled.John F. MacArthur in Charismatic Chaos says that (p237) \\"Freeman and the Faith Assembly congregation utterly disdained medical treatment, believing that modern medicine was an extension of ancient witchcraft and black magic. To submit to a doctor's remedies, Freeman believed, was to expose oneself to demonic influence.\\" In a more mild but troubled manner, Cindy Barnett in Never Far from Home says that (p153) \\"I had struggled for years with what Dr. Freeman had taught about divine healing. It wasn't that I doubted God would heal, but I questioned the way medical science was put down and discouraged. I was always trying to build up my faith, looking at it from every angle, reading books, and asking God about it. I would stare out the window wondering where all this would lead.\\" Hobart Freeman did write that \\"... we must practice thought control. We must deliberately empty our minds of everything negative concerning the person, problem, or situation confronting us ...\\" \\"Biblical Thinking and Confession: The Key to Victorious Living 365 Days a Year\\" by Hobart E. Freeman, Faith Publications, Warsaw IN nd page 20. The first part of this quotation was deleted in the subsequent edition. And he continued writing that \\"Sickness often can only be overcome by maintaining a positive confession of God's promises in the face of all apparent evidence to the contrary.\\" \\"Biblical Thinking and Confession: The Key to Victorious Living 365 Days a Year\\" by Hobart E. Freeman, Faith Publications, Warsaw IN nd page 49. Effectively Hobart Freeman had come to advocate faith in \\"faith\\", not faith in God. Controversy From the beginning, Freeman's congregation was the subject of controversy. At a meeting of the County Board of Health on October 23, 1974, Barbara Clouse, the Health Nurse for Kosciusko County was concerned that the Glory Barn was a major health problem and it would only get worse. She detailed her concerns, saying that: > Diabetics were not taking their insulin and pregnant women were receiving no > pre-natal or post-natal care. ... They are laying dead babies and live > babies next to each other on the altars and praying over them to get the > live babies to bring life back to the dead ones. There was one woman in our > county praying over a baby for four days before the funeral home got hold of > it.Warsaw (Indiana) Times Union, 24 October 1974 Clouse's concerns were later supported by local hospital statistics for 1975/6, which suggested that women from the congregation who gave birth at home were over 60 times more likely to die than those who gave birth at hospital under medical supervision. Later assessment by the US Department of Health and Human Services supported this conclusion. Epidemiologic Notes and Reports Perinatal and Maternal Mortality in a Religious Group -- Indiana by Anon, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (1 June 1984), 33(21):297-298. See also The Faith Assembly: A Study of Perinatal and Maternal Mortality by C. Spence, T.S. Danielson and A.M. Kaunitz, Indiana Medicine 1984 (March): 180-183. Deaths of several women, infants and babies were reported, and the local media blamed Freeman's teachings as medical treatment had been declined or refused.Warsaw (Indiana) Times Union, 10 July 1976 Deaths continued to be reported to the frustration of county law enforcement officials.Warsaw (Indiana) Times Union, 10 March 1980 Shortly after they were publicized, the old Glory Barn burnt down in the early hours of July 4, 1980. Six people escaped from the burning two-story barn. Two youngsters, Joel and Lee, suffered burns before they were rescued from their bedrooms by their father Brendan Wahl. The boys' mother, Peggy Wahl (n√©e Nusbaum), also claims to have been involved in their rescue, along with their daughter Penny who was not injured. Fire brigades from North Webster, Syracuse and Cromwell fought the blaze for some two hours until dawn, and the fire was subsequently investigated by the Noble County Police and Indiana State Fire Marshal. North Webster fire officials described the fire as of \\"suspicious origin\\".Warsaw (Indiana) Times Union, 7 July 1980 To date no culprit has been charged. In May 1983, the Chicago Tribune ran a story on David Gilmore whose 15-month-old son, Dustin Graham, had died five years previously from an easily treatable form of meningitis. Following church teaching, Gilmore and his wife had relied solely on prayer for their son's healing. Gilmore said he knew of twelve other children who had died under similar circumstances. The Tribune further identified fifty-two deaths from Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Kentucky which, they asserted, were attributable to church teaching. A few months later, ABC television's Nightline reported that pregnant women following church teaching died at a rate eight times the national average and their children at three times. Nightline further identified nineteen states and five countries where deaths had occurred which, they asserted, were attributable to church teaching.A Surgeon's View of Divine Healing by Paul Brand and Philip Yancey, Christianity Today, 25 November 1983. Eventually, Hobart Freeman was charged with aiding and abetting one of these deaths by what was described as \\"negligent homicide\\".Faith Assembly leader is sought for aiding, inducing homicide\\", Madison Courier, 18 October 1984, p.3d-f.\\" At least ninety members of the congregation died during Freeman's ministry,Jim Quinn and Bill Zlatos \\"Assembly's Message Ominious\\" Fort Wayne (Indiana) News- Sentinel, 2 June 1984, page 1 which Daniel McConnell described as tragic and preventable.Daniel R. McConnell in A Different Gospel - A Historical and Biblical Analysis of the Modern Faith Movement says that (p81) \\"For sheer volume of death and tragedy, none can match the record of Hobart Freeman, pastor of Faith Assembly, Wilmot, Indiana. Estimates of the number of preventable deaths associated with Faith Assembly itself are as high as 90. The number of deaths nationwide caused by Freeman's teaching on healing is not known.\\" McConnell continues to say that (p96) \\"Besides Faith Assembly, Freeman ministered throughout the South in a network of sister churches based on his teaching. Although not to the same extent, these churches also experienced deaths due to non-treatment of sickness. The author is personally familiar with a tragic death as far south as Alabama in a church which practiced Freeman's teaching.\\" Death Two weeks before this matter was to come to court, Freeman died at his Shoe Lake home of bronchial pneumonia and congestive heart failure complicated by an ulcerated gangrenous leg, which in the weeks preceding had forced him to preach sitting down. He had refused all medical help,\\"Faith Preacher Hobart Freeman Dies\\" by Steven Lawson, Charisma February 1985, page 110. even to the removal of the bandages so his leg could be cleaned.Interview with Mrs June Freeman, Winnona Lake (Indiana) 1994 Previously in Faith for Healing, Freeman had said that \\"To claim healing for the body and then to continue to take medicine is not following our faith with corresponding action ... When genuine faith is present, it alone will be sufficient for it will take the place of medicines and other aids.\\" \\"Faith for Healing\\" by Hobart E. Freeman, Faith Ministries and Publications, Warsaw IN nd page 11 Freeman's death was not reported for at least 13 hours due to an all- night prayer vigil for his resurrection. He was buried in a pine box with no public viewing and no graveside or memorial service.\\"Faith Assembly Mourns Death of Leader\\" by Kathy Muckle, Warsaw (Indiana) Times Union 10 December 1984, page 1 For some time afterwards, his wife, June Freeman (d. 29 January 2000), left his suit over the end of the bed, expecting him to one day walk in and have need of it. She soon came to accept his death as the will of God, and encouraged the congregation to persist in their faith. June Freeman - Letter to the Congregation - 1 January 1985 Legacy In June 1985, Jack Farrell, one of the two assistant pastors hand-picked by Hobart Freeman, quit the congregation, telling \\"The Body\\" during the Sunday sermon, that they were still \\"in bondage\\" to their late pastor.Warsaw (Indiana) Times Union, 10 September 1985 Some of the congregation also grew disillusioned and left.Discussion Group Others remained under the ministry of one or more of Freeman's successors. These successors include Joe and Jim Brenneman,Joseph Brenneman ministers at Faith Assembly in Warsaw, Indiana and through Faith Ministries and Publications. Steve Hill,Stephen J. Hill married Pamela Freeman, the eldest daughter of Hobart Freeman on 6 June 1971 in Kosciusko County, Indiana, and now ministers under the name of S.J. Hill from Charlotte, North Carolina. Jerry Ervin, Bruce Kinsey (d. 14 June 2008), Jim Mansfield, Gary Wilson, Terry Knafel, Jim Trout, Ron Moerchen, Don Mishler, Joe Duncan, Stan Hill, Tom Hamilton, Jim Oswalt, Dave Hardy, Harry Albright, Bill Garner, Jerry Reeder, Mark Yotter, Rick McCleay, Jeff Barnett Jeff and his wife Cindy Barnett minister at the Genesis Church in Seymour, Indiana. and Tim Neely.Timothy Neely ministers at the Bread of Life Assembly in Goshen, Indiana. Not all are today generally acknowledged to be faithful to Freeman's ministry. Continuing congregations include groups at Larwill, Goshen and Indianapolis Indiana, Grand Centre/Cold Lake Alberta and Shelbyville Kentucky.Personal observations In March 2015, Joshua Wilson, son of former Faith Assembly members, and Jack Pennington, a freelance filmmaker from Winston-Salem NC, announced their plans to film a documentary they called Children of Faith Assembly, which was promoted on the blog Friendly Atheist.Friendly Atheist - A Survivor of the Faith Assembly Cult Talks About Growing Up Under the Gaze of Crazed Preacher Hobart Freeman However it was never produced.

In this case the sine waves generated by the ANS are printed onto five glass discs using a process that Murzin (an optical engineer) had to develop himself. Each disc has 144 individual tracks printed onto it, for a total of 720 microtones (discrete pitches), spanning 10 octaves. This yields a resolution of 1/72 octave (16.67 cents). The modulated light from these wheels is then projected onto the back of the synthesizer's interface. These are arranged in a continuous swath vertically, with low frequencies at the bottom and high frequencies at the top. An example of score on glass plate The user interface consists of a glass plate covered in non-drying opaque black mastic, which constitutes a drawing surface upon which the user makes marks by scratching through the mastic, and therefore allowing light to pass through at that point. In front of the glass plate sits a vertical bank of twenty photocells that send signals to twenty amplifiers and bandpass filters, each with its own gain adjust control. It is akin to a ten-octave equalizer with two knobs per octave. The ANS is fully polyphonic and will generate all 720 pitches simultaneously if required (a vertical scratch would accomplish this). The glass plate can then be scanned left or right in front of the photocell bank in order to transcribe the drawing directly into pitches. In other words, it plays what one has drawn, similar to how a score is written. This process can be aided with a gear-motor drive (similar to an engineering lathe) or it can be moved manually. The scan speed is adjustable down to zero. The speed at which the score scans has no relation to pitch but serves only as a means of controlling duration. Murzin named his invention in honour of the composer Alexander Nikolayevich Scriabin (ANS): Scriabin (1872-1915) was an occultist, theosophist, and early exponent of color-sound theories in composition. The synthesizer was housed in the electronic-music studio situated above the Scriabin Museum (just off of the Arbat in central Moscow) before moving to the basement of the central university on the corner of Bolshaya Nikitskaya. It was saved from the scrapheap thanks to Stanislav Kreichi, who persuaded the university to look after it. The ANS was used by Stanislav Kreichi, Alfred Schnittke, Edison Denisov, Sofia Gubaidulina, and other Soviet composers. Edward Artemiev wrote many of his scores of the movies of Andrei Tarkovsky with the help of the ANS. Of particular note is Artemiev's score of Tarkovsky's Solaris in which the ANS was used to abstract, sci-fi effect akin to ambient music. PC power supplies have replaced the old ones (February 2006) After several years at the Theremin Center, the ANS (there is only one--the original was destroyed and this is the improved version) is now located in the Glinka State Central Museum of Musical Culture in Moscow. Recordings An album of works by the composers mentioned above, called \\"Musical Offering\\" was released on Melodiya (C60 30721 000) in 1990--although the recordings date from the 1960s and 1970s. Recordings by Stanislav Kreichi--\\"Ansiana\\" and \\"Voices and Movement\\"--as well as earlier works (\\"Electroshock Presents: Electroacoustic Music\\") that used the synthesizer are available on Electroshock Records. A soundtrack of the film Into Space (1961) in collaboration with Edward Artimiev remains unreleased. In 2002, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a program about the ANS by Isobel Clouter as part of her Soundhunter series. In 2004, the British experimental group Coil released CoilANS, a boxed set of experimental drone music performed on the ANS. The Norwegian artist Zweizz released a cassette in 2007 on which side B is made entirely out of ANS recordings. The British experimental group T.A.G.C. utilized sounds generated on the ANS on two compositions that were released in 1996 on the Deepnet compilation album.

Biography Born in San Rafael, California to John Franklin Boyd (part-owner of the Bodie, California gold mine) and Louise Cook Arner, Louise grew up in Marin County and the hills of Oakland playing and competing with her two older brothers, Seth and John. The Boyds were leading citizens of the era and their children's early years, though privileged and relatively carefree, included a well-rounded education that was punctuated every summer by an extended stay on their ranch in the Oakland Hills. It was here where Louise and her brothers rode horses, explored Mount Diablo, fished, hunted, camped, and generally led a rugged and adventurous life. When Louise was a teenager, both of her brothers died from heart disease within a few months of each other. Her parents were devastated and began to lean heavily on Louise for care and comfort. It was at this time that the Boyds bequeathed to the City of San Rafael their former gatehouse and some of the family property as a memorial to their two sons. The Victorian-style building is now offices for the City of San Rafael. After her brother's deaths, Louise traveled extensively with her parents making numerous trips to Europe. In the spring of 1919, Louise took a train to Buffalo, N.Y., purchased a touring car and drove across the United States at a time when there was no highway system and roads were often gravel and dirt. This would be the first of many cross-country trips that she would take and detail in her many journals. Upon her parents death in 1919 and 1920, Louise inherited the family fortune after caring for her parents in the last few years of their lives. With her inheritance, Louise Boyd could control her own destiny and indulge her intrepid spirit developed during her active California childhood. She began to travel in the early 1920s, and on a trip to Norway in 1924 she cruised out to sea and saw the Polar Ice Pack for the first time. This experience proved instrumental in her life and she immediately began planning her own Arctic adventure. In 1925, she was presented to the King and Queen of England and soon after, in 1926, she chartered the supply ship Hobby which had been used by famous explorer Roald Amundsen, for a hunting and filming trip to the Arctic accompanied by her friends the Count & Countess Ribadavia. She gained international notoriety for her exploits (and hunting of polar bears) and was dubbed by newspapers around the world, as the, ‚ÄúArctic Diana‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Girl Who Tamed the Arctic‚Äù. The Count of Ribadavia published a book with photographs by Louise in 1927 titled, Chasses Et Aventures Dans Les Regions Polaires. Boyd chartered the Hobby, a supply ship of Troms√∏ for her trips in 1926 and 1928 In 1928, Boyd was planning a second pleasure trip aboard the Hobby when it was learned that the famous Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen had recently disappeared in his own attempt to find and rescue the Italian explorer Umberto Nobile. Louise offered her services and the ship to the Norwegian government to search for Amundsen, saying, ‚ÄúHow could I go on a pleasure trip when those 22 lives were at stake?‚Äù Although she traveled about 10,000 miles (16,100 km) across the Arctic Ocean she found no trace of him. Nevertheless, the Norwegian government awarded her the Chevalier Cross of the Order of Saint Olav. \\"She was the first American woman to receive the order and the third woman in the world to be so honored.\\" Boyd is primarily known for leading a series of scientific expeditions to the east and north coast of Greenland in the 1930s. Louise photographed, surveyed and collected hundreds of botanical specimens, having corresponded and learned from her good friend, Alice Eastwood of the California Academy of Sciences. The American Geographical Society published her findings and photographs from the 1933 and 1935 expeditions in a book titled The Fiord Region of East Greenland. An area near the Gerard de Geer Glacier was later named Louise Boyd Land. In August 1934, after being elected as a delegate to the International Geographical Congress in Warsaw, Poland, Louise set out on a 3-month journey across the Polish countryside photographing and recording the customs, dress, economy and culture of the many ethnic Poles, Ukrainians, Byelorussians and Lithuanians. The journey, by car, rail, boat and on foot took her first from Lviv to Kovel (these towns are in Ukraine today), and then to Kobrin ‚Äì Pinsk ‚Äì Kletsk ‚Äì Nesvizh ‚Äì Slonim (these towns are in Belarus today). She finished the journey in Vilno. Her travel narrative was supplemented with over 500 photographs and published by the American Geographical Society in 1937 as Polish Countrysides.American Geographical Society Special Publication No. 20 ‚ÄúPolish Countrysides‚Äù Photographs And Narrative by Louise A. Boyd with a contribution by Stanislaw Gorzuchowski, New York, American Geographical Society Broadway at 156th Street, 1937 With the outbreak of World War II, the knowledge she had gained in the course of her six previous expeditions to Greenland and the Arctic became of strategic significance and sensitivity. The United States government requested that she not publish the book she was writing about her later 1937 and 1938 expeditions and asked her to lead, for the Department of Commerce National Bureau of Standards, a geophysical expedition along the west coast of Greenland and down the coast of Baffin Island and Labrador. She was appointed as the Bureau's consulting expert on a dollar a year basis. At her own expense, she chartered and outfitted the schooner Effie M. Morrissey. This schooner, owned and commanded by captain Robert Bartlett, had been successfully running yearly scientific expeditions to the Arctic since 1926. The principal purpose of the 1941 Bureau of Standards expedition was to obtain data on radio-wave transmission in the Arctic regions traversed. The ionosphere, geomagnetism and aurorae were studied. The Effie M. Morrissey sailed from Washington DC on June 11, 1941, with Louise Boyd leading a scientific party of four men (including a physician) and a crew of eleven under the command of Capt. Bartlett. The expedition returned to Washington DC on November 3, 1941 with valuable data.U.S. Department of Commerce, Technical News Bulletin of the National Bureau of Standards, Washington, December 1941, Number 296. During the remainder of the war, Boyd worked on secret assignments for the U.S. Department of the Army and she was awarded, in 1949, a Department of Army Certificate of Appreciation. Her earlier book that had been held from publication, The Coast of Northeast Greenland, was published after the war, in 1948. Later in life Louise Boyd was an active and well-known Marin figure and hostess while serving as a member of the Executive Committee of the San Francisco Symphony. She also accumulated many academic honors receiving an honorary law degree from the University of California, Berkeley and from Mills College. She was also the second woman ever to receive the Cullum Medal of the American Geographical Society and in 1960 was the first woman to be elected to their board. She was also made an honorary member of the California Academy of Science. Near the end of her life, Louise experienced financial difficulties and had already spent much of her fortune outfitting and chartering her many explorations. Eventually she had to sell the family home in San Rafael and all her furniture. She died in San Francisco on September 14, 1972. The present day Marin History Museum was located in the old Boyd Estate Gatehouse in San Rafael, California from the 1950s to the mid 2010s.

Throughout the year, courses for adults include the University Foundation Course, English language courses, advanced English with academic subjects and Liberal Arts courses for Gap Year students from US universities. In the summer months, adults, teenagers and younger students can study English language courses on three separate sites. The school is consistently listed in the Top 20 IB Schools in the UK School League Tables from Education Advisers Ltd.https://www.best- schools.co.uk/uk-school-league-tables/ib-schools-large-cohort/ UK School League Tables History The school was founded in 1952 by Anne Dreydel OBE and Pamela Morris, and grew out of a scheme to establish links between British and European students after the Second World War.The Daily Telegraph. 28 July 2007. Its mission is to advance international education and understanding. The original name was The Oxford English Centre for Foreign Students, which later became St Clare's Hall, and then St Clare's, Oxford. Since 1953 the College grew quickly to encompass a wide range of nationalities and programmes, both at university and pre-university level and in English Language. In the mid-50s, students came mostly from around a dozen Western European countries, as well as the UK. Over 40 different nationalities are represented in its current IB student body. Links with universities in the USA date back to the 1960s. Formal agreements by which American university students could gain credit towards their US degrees by studying abroad at St Clare's started up in the 1970s. Such courses gradually replaced the University of London external degrees that had previously been taught. In 1977 the College introduced the International Baccalaureate Diploma for pre-university students ‚Äì only the 41st school in the world to do so. There are only 13 other institutions in the world who have taught the IB longer than St. Clare's. \\"A\\" levels were gradually phased out as the IB became established, and the College is now the longest established IB school in England (source ISA). There are currently over 3,700 IB world schools. The College campus has grown with the increase in student numbers. As a registered charity, profits are re-invested in the College to facilitate expansion and development. From its original base on 141 Banbury Road, the College grew to allow more teaching space and a wider range of subject choices. Early homestay arrangements were largely replaced with residential accommodation, as new houses in the area were acquired and refurbished. In 1999, the College bought the Oxford Academy English Language School in Bardwell Road, which became the centre for all adult courses. The main campus building and reception is located at 139 Banbury Road, in the Summertown suburb of North Oxford. The college has completed a number of significant building projects including a new ¬£1.3 million student residence for 24 students and wardens apartments in 2010; a ¬£3.4 million building housing 3 science laboratories and 3 Mathematics classrooms in 2014; and an art studio and student residence in the grounds of one of the existing student houses in 2015. Campus St Clare's is located in the North Oxford Conservation Area on two sites ‚Äì the Banbury Road Campus (No. 139, between Lathbury Road and Moreton Road) and the Bardwell Road Campus (No. 18). It occupies 27 Victorian and Edwardian houses to which purpose-built facilities have been added. At the Banbury Road Campus these include a library building, a careers and higher education information centre, four science laboratories completed in 2014, an art studio completed in 2015 and music studio, dining room and caf√©. Adult students are based at the International College for adult students located at the Bardwell Road Campus which is made up of classrooms, common room, dining room, activities office, secluded gardens and student bedrooms. Students live in college houses close to the college, under the care of residential staff. Adult students are also able to choose to live with local hosts in Oxford. International Baccalaureate Diploma St Clare's is a co-educational day and residential sixth form college. Having offered the International Baccalaureate Diploma for over 35 years, St Clare's is the 41st school in the world to run IB, and is the longest-established provider of the International Baccalaureate Diploma in England. Over 150 different nationalities are represented, of which about 15% are from Britain. St Clare's also provides a Pre-IB course which is an excellent preparation for the full IB Diploma. During the Summer, St Clare's offers an IB Introduction course for those wishing to experience a two-week taster of the IB programme. The college is authorised to run IB Teacher Workshops for both new and experienced teachers in co-operation with the International Baccalaureate Organisation (IBO). In May 2018, for the 12th time in 13 years, we have a student gaining 45 points, a result gained by only 0.2% of students around the world. The average IB score was 36, which compares very favourably to the world average of 30. Referring to the International Baccalaureate Diploma programmes, in the most recent Ofsted inspection, the College was awarded \\"outstanding\\", the highest rating, for the quality of its boarding, something that fewer than 10% of boarding schools achieve in the UK. St Clare's offers a wide range of languages to study at A1 Literature level. Students must study six subjects, three at Higher Level and three at Standard Level. Every student must study one subject from Groups 1 - 5. The sixth subject option can be chosen either from group 6 or from one of the previous groups. Extra-curricular activities There is a large variety of activities students may choose from. All of these can be a part of the CAS component of their IB course. Although there are many more, listed below are some popular examples: * St. Clare's Union (debating society) * Model United Nations * Clarity magazine * Girls football * Boys football * Boys basketball * Table Tennis * Tennis * Chess club * Student council * Choir & vocal group * Duke of Edinburgh English Language courses A range of adult English Language courses are run throughout the academic year from September to June. Courses run from 4 weeks to 12 months; 21 lessons per week, as well as one-to-one tuition. Courses include, General English for Everyday Use; IELTS and Cambridge examination preparation; English plus Academic Subjects and Combined English, where students mix classes with private lessons. Students wishing to apply to university in the UK, USA and Europe take the 28/35-week University Foundation course. Students with advanced level English are able to study a unique programme which combines English language classes with academic subjects taught at university level. These academic subjects are a part of the Liberal Arts Programme for American students who are taking a Gap Year as part of their US degree. University Foundation Course Students wishing to apply to UK universities study the University Foundation Course, an in-depth preparation for university entrance, from September to June for 35 weeks or late October to June for 28 weeks. In spring 2013, the college was awarded \\"exceeds expectation\\" by the Independent Schools Inspectorate Educational Oversight for Private Further Education Colleges in its Inspection Report. Graduates of the school's University Foundation Course have gone on to study at various UK universities as well as institutions in the US and Europe. These include Utrecht University, University of Barcelona, University of Edinburgh, Oxford Brookes University, University of Madrid, School of Oriental and African Studies, Maastricht University, Royal Holloway, University of London, Moscow State University, Goldsmiths, University of London and Queen Mary, University of London. Summer courses Shorter English Language courses from 2 and 3 weeks up to 6-week courses are offered during the summer from June to August. These short holiday courses combine English classes, with an extensive activities and excursions programme. Students live in college accommodation or with local hosts. The College is able to offer courses for three different age groups on three separate sites. Age ranges are adults age 17+, teenagers age 15‚Äì17 and juniors age 10‚Äì15. For teenagers with an advanced level of English there are three more academic style courses; Art in Oxford, using the new art studio built in 2015, Business in Oxford and Science in Oxford, using the new science laboratories built in 2014. Scholarships Scholarships applications for studying the IB Diploma programme are considered in February each year. Students must attend a Scholarship Day where they sit tests, have interviews with teachers and the Principal and parent financial information is reviewed. The College does not offer Scholarships for any other course.

The name Protoceratopsidae is derived from the Greek for \\"first horned face\\". Protoceratopsids have so far been found in rocks from the Late Cretaceous, dating to between about 99.6 and 70.6 million years ago.Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2011) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages, Winter 2010 Appendix. Although ceratopsians have been found all over the world, protoceratopsids are only known from Asia, with most specimens found in China and the Nemegt Basin in Mongolia. As ceratopsians, protoceratopsids were herbivorous, with constantly replacing tooth batteries made for slicing through plants and a hooked beak for grabbing them. Protoceratopsids were relatively small, between 1-2.5 m in length from head to tail. Their bony frill and horns were much smaller than more derived members of Ceratopsia. Protoceratopsids were likely slow runners and tended to move at a walk or a trot. Their legs may have been straight, creating an upright posture, but there are some theories that they were splayed out to the side, contributing to their slowness. There is evidence that Protoceratops formed groups. Specimens of juveniles and young adults are often found in groups, although adults tend to be solitary. The nature of these groups is not completely known, though herds of young likely formed for protection from predators, and adults are believed to have come together for communal nesting. Phylogeny The taxon Protoceratopsidae was introduced by Walter W. Granger and William King Gregory in May 1923 as a monotypic family for Protoceratops andrewsi. Granger and Gregory recognized Protoceratopss close relationship to other ceratopsians, but considered it primitive enough to warrant its own family, and perhaps suborder. Protoceratopsidae was later expanded to include all ceratopsians that were too advanced to be psittacosaurids, but too primitive to be ceratopsids. In 1998, Paul Sereno defined Protoceratopsidae as the stem-based clade including \\"all coronosaurs closer to Protoceratops than to Triceratops\\". Sereno's definition ensures that Protoceratopsidae is monophyletic, but probably excludes some dinosaurs that have been traditionally thought of as protoceratopsids (for example, Leptoceratops and Montanoceratops). The latter genera are now often classified in a mostly North American family Leptoceratopsidae. Sereno (2000) included three genera in Protoceratopsidae: Protoceratops, Bagaceratops, and Graciliceratops. Derived characters shared by these dinosaurs include a narrow strap-shaped paroccipital process, a very small occipital condyle, and an upturned dorsal margin of the predentary. In Protoceratops and Bagaceratops (and also in the non-protoceratopsid Leptoceratops), there is a blade-shaped parietal sagittal crest (Sereno 2000: 505). Several other more recently recognized genera may also be protoceratopsids. In 2003, Vladimir Alifanov named, but did not define, a new ceratopsian family Bagaceratopidae to include Bagaceratops, Platyceratops, Lamaceratops and Breviceratops. However, applying Sereno's phylogenetic definition, Alifanov's Bagaceratopidae appears to be a subclade of Protoceratopsidae. Physiology =Anatomy= Protoceratopsids have a frill and rostral bone characteristic of all ceratopsians. Their snout is particularly wedge-shaped with tall and narrow nostrils situated high on it. The antorbital fenestra is unusually small, and the antorbital fossa sits high on the skull with a slit connecting it to a sinus in the maxilla. This sinus is unique to Protoceratopsidae. Protoceratopsids may have had cheeks to hold food in their mouths. They have very well-defined maxillary and dentary ridges where the muscles in the cheek would have connected, and a number of foramina dotted the maxilla which allowed branches from the trigimenal nerve to reach the tissues attached to the maxilla, indicating that such tissues were likely muscular. The end of the upper jaw was likely not fleshy but instead covered by a horn-like material, and the upper and lower jaws curved in towards each other. Compared to more derived ceratopsians, protoceratopsids had a deep and wide oral cavity, though more narrow than in predecessors like Psittacosaurus, which may have aided in breathing or thermoregulation. In Protoceratopsidae, the nasal cavity, which was ancestrally one large cavity, was split into two by the hard palate. This splitting likely happened to accommodate the deeper oral cavity. The vertebral column of protoceratopsids was S-shaped, and the vertebrae had unusually long neural spines, with spines on caudal vertebrae that were five times as tall as the centrum. The neural spines on the caudal vertebrae were longer in the middle of the tail than at the base, increasing the tail's height and flattening it. The middle of the tail was rigid and straight. The entire tail was quite horizontally flexible, but vertical movement was limited. The neck had limited mobility, especially in the lateral direction. The neck allowed individuals to bend their necks up and down so that they could reach food. Based on the size of its sclerotic ring, Protoceratops had an unusually large eye among protoceratopsids. In birds, a medium-sized sclerotic ring indicates that the animal is a predator, a large sclerotic ring indicates that it is nocturnal, and the largest ring size indicates it is a nocturnal predator. Eye size is an important adaptation in predators and nocturnal animals because a larger eye has increased sensitivity and resolution. Because of the energy necessary to maintain a larger eye and the weakness of the skull that corresponds with a larger orbit, Nick Longrich argues that this structure may have been an adaptation for a nocturnal lifestyle. Protoceratopss mouth structures and general abundance indicate it was not a predator, so if it were also diurnal, then it would have been expected to have a much smaller sclerotic ring size. =Sexual Dimorphism= Protoceratopsids are generally accepted as having been sexually dimorphic with respect to the width and height of the skull and the frill that covers the neck. This frill was likely used in mating displays. A larger frill gave an advantage in head-pushing competitions in which individuals would push against each other's heads to display dominance. The frill may have been brightly colored and used in head-bobbing displays similar to those of modern-day iguanas and chameleons to attract a mate. Leonardo Maiorino and his team used geometric morphometrics to analyze the dimorphism in Protoceratops andrewsi and concluded that there is no difference in male and female structures. Alternatively, Dodson's analysis of structure sizes in large Protoceratops found that they were dimorphic. The length and width of the frill, parietal fenestra, and external nares, the nasal height, the skull width, the orbit height, and the coronoid process height all varied with sex. =Growth= There are three phases in the life cycle of a protoceratopsid: juvenile, subadult, and adult. Juveniles are roughly one third the size of an adult and have an underdeveloped frill and nasal bump. They have not developed epijugals. Nests containing juveniles have been found indicating that they received some level of parental care. In the subadult stage, individuals are two thirds the size of an adult, and the frill and quadrates grow wider. The epijugal begins forming. As an adult, the frill becomes even larger, the epijugal is fully formed, and a small nasal horn develops. Environment Protoceratops likely lived in deserts. Specimens are often found in sandstones. Because the posture of some animals is preserved, it is likely that they were buried during a sandstorm or a dune collapse. If Protoceratops was nocturnal, it could avoid the hottest parts of the day and survive in an arid environment without highly developed cooling mechanisms. On the other hand, Tereschenko proposed that protoceratopsids were actually aquatic, using their laterally-flattened tails as a paddle to aid in swimming. According to Tereschenko, Bagaceratops was fully aquatic while Protoceratops was only partially aquatic. Biogeography Ceratopsians originated in Asia and had two major dispersal events. The first was the migration of Leptoceratopsidae's ancestor through Europe and into North America. The second dispersal was 15 million years later, this time of Ceratopsidae's ancestors across the Bering Land Bridge into North America between 120Ma and 140Ma. Protoceratopsids are found in Asia but not North America. See also * Timeline of ceratopsian research References *Alifanov, V.R., 2003.

He was portrayed by Jacob Young from 2003 to 2011, prior to Ryan Bittle taking over the role in 2013. Bittle was cast as the new JR on Prospect Park's continuation of All My Children. Background The character was originally born onscreen on July 3, 1989 to Dixie Cooney and her estranged ex-husband, Adam Chandler. In March 2004, the character's birth year was revised to July 3,1983. He is a member of both the powerful and wealthy Chandler and Cooney families, being the son of Adam Chandler and great-nephew of Palmer Cortlandt. The writers characterized JR as caring, but ruthless if betrayed, explaining the latter by way of his difficult upbringing. The character's softer personality has been attributed to his mother, Dixie Cooney, as well as to his son, AJ, and true love Babe Carey (who was killed off by the series in 2008). Credited as significantly complex,Jacob Young TV Guide Interview, TV Guide (2005-03-22). Retrieved on 2007-12-18 he has been cited as a television anti-hero, and \\"bad boy,\\" and his struggles with family, romantic partners, and alcohol addiction have been documented in literature. Character creation Actor Jacob Young, who had been on The Bold and the Beautiful (Rick Forrester) and General Hospital (Lucky Spencer) prior to joining All My Children, stated that he had good instincts, but that he \\"was young and kind of doe-eyed to the world\\" then. It was not until the actor stepped into the All My Children role of JR Chandler that his acting range became more focused. He started to use tools he learned in classes and felt that his acting became more refined because of it. With his portrayal of JR, he explained how this factored in: \\"They twisted JR in a completely different direction,\\" he stated. \\"They started off with JR not respecting his father and having a lot of elements of his mother in him. He was much more soft. Then they started toying with it and couldn't believe what was coming out of me. I'd always been the nice, honorable guy; I'd never been the character who was stirring the pot.\\" JR's rich lifestyle was something that Young noted not being familiar with, stating that the JR persona did not come to him until he would put on the suit. \\"They put me in these nice designer suits, and I suddenly feel like a million bucks. Then I take that million-buck feeling and go a little sinister with it.\\" One aspect of JR's personality are \\"devious tones\\" sometimes present in his dialogue. \\"When the character is in a good mood and has the upper hand, he has all these one- liners,\\" Young relayed. When working with former All My Children co-star Alexa Havins (ex-Babe Carey), Young would often shock Havins with the character's words. To make sure she was unaware of how he was going to deliver a crass line, he would keep it hidden [during rehearsal]. \\"You can break the wording down and make it a little more offensive,\\" he cited. \\"And I try to nail that because that's what JR's supposed to do.\\" The writers were looking for an actor who could truly radiate the essence of Adam Chandler's son, and felt that taking JR down the path of darkness would help with that. Young, the actor chosen as best suited for the part, detailed the transition: \\"They wanted it to be 'like father, like son,' so I watched David Canary's (Adam) mannerisms and delivery. I tried to mold those into my own, enough to where I could be his son. They started writing my dialogue like his. He has some one- liners that are pretty funny. David is as big a goofball as I am onset. He's like, 'Here's my boy!' We have a great dynamic together.\\" Young's portrayal of JR propelled the character into one of the show's more popular and hated characters. Storylines =1989‚Äì2011= JR is born in 1989 as the son of Adam Chandler and Dixie Cooney. Throughout his life, he has been involved with Amanda Dillon, Kendall Hart, Annie Lavery, and mainly linked to Babe Carey and Marissa Tasker. JR and Babe - who have been married three times to eachother - produce a son, AJ Chandler, in 2004 and are involved in a three-way baby switch storyline. Bianca Montgomery's daughter Miranda Montgomery is switched to Babe and JR, while their own child is given to Kelly Cramer (of One Life to Live). Kelly's recent pregnancy ends in a stillbirth and given to Bianca. Eventually the truth is revealed and Miranda goes back to Bianca, while AJ is returned to Babe/JR, and finally Kelly Cramer deals with the death and the situation. In 2009, Babe dies from injuries of a tornado and JR later gets involved with Babe's twin sister and AJ's aunt Marissa Tasker, who he later married. They divorce in 2010, and in 2011, Marissa starts dating Bianca. That same year, his mother is revelaed to be alive, along with his uncle, Stuart Chandler. A devastated JR becomes drunk and arrives with a gun at Brooke and Adam's party, where a shot is heard. =2013= It is revealed that JR has been in a coma for five years. On the night that changed Pine Valley five years ago (the ABC series finale), the drunken JR was about to shoot someone, but David Hayward intervened; JR pulled the trigger and shot someone in the house, while David shot JR and put him in a coma. It is revealed on May 2, 2013 that JR shot and killed Marissa Tasker, his ex-wife (David's daughter).

From 1882 until 1884 the club was known as Serpentine after the road near its original ground. In 1884 a dispute prompted a relocation to Waterloo and so the club's name was changed. The club returned to the Blundellsands area in 1892 and has remained there ever since. The team is currently known as Firwood Waterloo after its title sponsor. They play in myrtle green, white and scarlet hooped shirts, green shorts and green socks. Their badge features a Lancastrian red rose with a black griffin in the centre.

It includes notable characters from the comic strip as well as cartoons, and movies centered on the Garfield character, and is organized by what medium they appeared in first. Comic strip =Garfield= First Appearance: June 19, 1978 Garfield is the strip's title character. He is a lazy, fat orange tabby. He also appears to be more anthropomorphic and/or humanoid-like as the series passes by and there are more strips being made. He is usually depicted eating or sleeping. His favorite food is lasagna. Hates Mondays, spiders and raisins. Loves bullying Odie and mailing Nermal to Abu Dhabi for being annoying. Garfield also hates Nermal but sometimes likes him. His girlfriend is Arlene, who does not appear at all in Garfield and Friends, but Garfield and Friends has some episodes and specials of female cats as his love interest from time to time. =Jon Arbuckle= First Appearance: June 19, 1978 Jonathan Q. \\"Jon\\" Arbuckle is the owner of Garfield and Odie. It is said several times that he is a cartoonist. He has an eccentric, sometimes childish behavior, and he is frequently seen doing unusual acts to alleviate his boredom. When going out on a date, he dresses in loud, mismatched clothes. He has attempted to date several women, many of whom have turned him down. That was before it is revealed that Liz (see below), actually likes him, and now frequently go out on dates. =Odie= First Appearance: August 8, 1978 Odie is a yellow beagle, also owned by Jon. He was initially owned by Jon's roommate, Lyman (see below), but later became Jon's dog. Odie is often punted or pushed off the table by Garfield though Odie sometimes gets him back. He is almost always shown to be dumb, but there are several strips in which he seems to be smart and clever. =Dr. Liz Wilson= First Appearance: June 26, 1979 Dr. Elizabeth \\"Liz\\" Wilson is Garfield's veterinarian and a long-time crush of Jon Arbuckle. Although she has a deadpan, sardonic persona, she finds Jon's outlandish and goofball behavior endearing on occasion. Jon often attempts to ask her out on a date, but rarely succeeds; however, in an extended story arc from June 20 to July 29, 2006, Liz finally admitted she was in love with him which led to Liz becoming established as the 4th main character. The two have since become a couple. In the film Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties, Jon asks Liz to marry him and she accepts; they become engaged. However, this is not mentioned in or connected to the strips. Even though Garfield rarely sees her at the veterinary clinic, Liz nags Garfield to lose weight and reject junk food at home. However, Liz still does bring food that Garfield likes to the house and Garfield happily benefits from this. On Garfield and Friends, Liz was voiced by Julie Payne, occasionally appearing in the first two seasons. In the live-action/animated movies, she is played by Jennifer Love Hewitt. Her first albeit brief television appearance was on the second TV special Garfield on the Town. In a few of the July 2007 strips, Garfield became jealous of Liz, until they became friends on July 24. In one strip, it is revealed that her mother's name is Betty. In The Garfield Show, she is once again voiced by Julie Payne, who is shown to be kinder and more sympathetic. Liz's parents have made a couple of appearances on The Garfield Show as well. According to two Garfield Comic Strips, Liz's birthday is said to be January 13th. These are shown in January 13, 2017 and January 13, 2018. =Arlene= First Appearance: December 17, 1980 Latest Appearance: October 9, 2020 Arlene is the name of a beautiful, sweet-natured, loving pink stray cat who likes Garfield. The gap in her teeth is often the subject of her romantic interest's ridicule. In many strips, she is seen meeting with Garfield on a wooden fence silhouetted in the moonlight, although she still makes plenty of appearances during the daytime. Often she is depicted as being more moral than Garfield, particularly in more recent television or media adaptions of the comics; she serves as a conscientious voice of guidance for her love interest and will persuade him to choose the proper decisions. However, she still questions their relationship at times, due to Garfield's lack of a feminine side and rudeness. She is aggravated by Garfield's teasing and gluttony, but still holds affection for him. Arlene and Garfield are the counterpart to Dr. Liz Wilson relationship with Jon Arbuckle. In the Garfield film, she appears as a purple-ish Russian Blue cat, voiced by Debra Messing. She is also voiced by Grey DeLisle in Garfield Originals. =Pooky= First Appearance: October 23, 1978 Latest Appearance: August 30, 2020 Pooky is Garfield's teddy bear and best friend that Garfield discovered stuffed in a drawer. Garfield sometimes communicates with Pooky as if he were a living animal; he can also be over- protective of Pooky. Once, Garfield tried to \\"protect\\" Pooky from a present from Jon to Pooky, a miniature accordion. When Pooky lost an eye, Garfield requested a new eye for Pooky as his Christmas present. Garfield is not shy to show his love for Pooky, often grabbing it in hugs. This causes Jon to be a bit envious that the teddy bear is better-loved than him. He occasionally asks for hugs from Garfield, which Garfield refuses. In one comic strip in particular, Jon asks \\"Can I have a hug like that?\\" to which Garfield sighs, gives Pooky to Jon and leaves without saying a word. Certain strips have shown Pooky as sentient. In one instance we see Pooky rollerblade past Jon, who assumes Garfield is playing a prank. However, we then see Garfield at the other end of the room, implying that Pooky is skating under his own power. Either that or Garfield pushed Pooky on the skates, then ran to the other end of the room or Garfield had somebody else to do so and Garfield went to the other side of the room. In another strip, Jon wonders what Garfield dreams about when he sleeps with Pooky on his lap. The last panel shows Pooky dreaming that Garfield is sleeping in his lap. In yet another instance, Garfield gets amnesia, and when Jon shows him Pooky in an attempt to jog his memory, Garfield scoffs at a cat owning a teddy bear. Pooky, along with Jon and Odie, was shown shedding a tear, something that would be impossible for an inanimate object although this may have been done for comedic effect. =Nermal= First Appearance: September 3, 1979 Latest Appearance: August 23, 2020 Nermal is a small grey tabby cat whom Garfield is jealous of. He proclaims himself as \\"the world's cutest kitten\\". Nermal was first introduced as Jon's parents' kitten, but this idea was quickly dropped. He frequently made unannounced visits into Garfield's home, where he flaunted his cuteness and became the focus of Jon's attention for the entire duration of his visit, much to Garfield's exasperation. Nermal especially did this on Garfield's birthdays to remind him of his advancing age. In frustration, Garfield frequently expressed his desire to send Nermal to Abu Dhabi. He also frequently hurled Nermal through the door, leaving a hole in the shape of his body (sometimes repeatedly). This was never shown in either show, most likely because it was considered inappropriate for a children's show, but in one episode of The Garfield Show, he threw Nermal out the dog door and over a fence into a trash can in another. Although Garfield once ceased attacking Nermal after having a nightmare where a hulking cat introduces himself as a full-grown Nermal and proceeds to brutalize Garfield, this has not actually happened. Nermal once mentioned that he is going to stay cute and small forever because he is a midget; \\"I think small,\\" he once quipped, \\"and the coffee and cigarettes don't hurt.\\" Another time Garfield caught Nermal \\"in the act\\" was when he sneaked up on a mortified Nermal wearing a facial mask and said \\"I thought so.\\" His first television appearance was on the Garfield and Friends episode \\"School Daze\\", and his last was on \\"The Feline Philosopher\\"; on the show, he became a recurring cast member. Desir√©e Goyette regularly provided Nermal's voice on the series, which confused viewers to think that he was a female due to the feminine voice. A running gag on the show featured Garfield mailing (or trying to mail) Nermal to Abu Dhabi, which once resulted in himself getting mailed instead. Garfield even had his own song called \\"Abu Dhabi\\", which he uses to tell Nermal all about the United Arab Emirates and how he will love it there (or rather, Garfield will love it for having Nermal on the other side of the world). When Garfield is spared a trip to Abu Dhabi himself (a stuffed cat was sent to the UAE instead), Jon demands Garfield stop threatening to send Nermal to Abu Dhabi. Garfield promises this, then makes attempts to mail Nermal to the North Pole after that. In Garfield: The Movie, Nermal is portrayed by an adult Siamese cat in the neighborhood, and is voiced by David Eigenberg. Unlike his portrayals in previous media, Nermal is Garfield's friend and Nermal makes no attempt whatsoever to brag about being cute and Garfield is only mildly annoyed with him. Nermal is voiced by Jason Marsden in The Garfield Show, and the films Garfield Gets Real, Garfield's Fun Fest, and Garfield's Pet Force. Brittany Ross voices Nermal in Garfield Originals. =Lyman= First Appearance: August 7, 1978 Last Appearance: As a regular: April 24, 1983 (Cameo in the 10th anniversary strip: June 19, 1988) (Appearance as photograph on Jon's newspaper: April 2, 2013) Lyman was Jon's friend, roommate, and Odie's original owner during the strip's early years. Lyman first appeared on August 7, 1978. His last appearance in the comic strip was on Garfield's 10th birthday, though he had stopped appearing regularly by the end of 1981. He was removed from the Sunday splash panel in March 1982. According to Davis, Lyman's original purpose was to be someone who Jon could talk to and express other ideas, since Garfield and Odie could not speak for themselves. However, Davis later discovered ways for Garfield and Odie to communicate with Jon nonverbally, and Lyman was no longer needed. When asked about Lyman's disappearance, Davis once jokingly replied, \\"Don't look in Jon's basement!\\" But Lyman has nevertheless made a few modern appearances. He appears in the \\"Scary Scavenger Hunt\\" I and II games at Garfield.com, in which he both helps and scares the player throughout the game; he is also seen behind the front desk at the Book Nook at the same website. He also has a cameo on the front page of a newspaper that Jon is reading in the comic of April 2, 2013. Lyman predated Garfield; a character with the same name and function, but in insect form, appeared in Davis's previous strip Gnorm Gnat as the title character's straight man. In The Garfield Show episode \\"Long Lost Lyman\\" (season 3), an effort is made to explain what became of the character in-continuity. Lyman is said to have left Odie with Jon before moving away to work as a wildlife photographer in a distant jungle. When Jon learns that Lyman disappeared while searching for a mythical Bigfoot-like creature, Jon, Garfield, and Odie travel to the jungle to find him. The \\"Long Lost Lyman\\" version of Lyman has round eyes resembling Jon's rather than the dot-eyes of his traditional comics design and is voiced by Frank Ferrante. =Family= Mom First Appearance: February 13, 1980 Latest Appearance: November 6, 2011 (at Garfield title) (mentioned December 10, 2011) Mrs Arbuckle is Jon's mother who lives on a farm and is known to be a great cook, offering a wide variety of food for Jon to eat when he visits, especially her ability to create dozens of potato-based dishes. Based on Jim Davis' mother, Jon's mother is also known for sending him and Garfield cooked meals in packages; Jon also reveals in one sketch that his mother was his date for his senior prom. Garfield seems to both love and hate her, enjoying the vast amounts of food she cooks but despising the homemade sweaters and winter clothes she sends him at Christmas. In September 1979, Jon's Mom and Dad left Nermal with him for the week while they went on vacation, yet in November 1984, Jon's Mom claimed that they had not been off the farm since 1953. In the Garfield and Friends episode Feeling Feline, she appears in a speaking line along with Jon's dad (no speaking parts) in Jon's dream. In A Garfield Christmas Special, she was voiced by Julie Payne, who now voices Liz in The Garfield Show. She is Garfield's human mother. She often says \\"Eat, eat, eat.\\" in an episode of the Garfield show, she comes for a wedding, after Garfield tries to get into Vito's pizzeria after he got banned from the pizzeria. Dad First Appearance: February 13, 1980 Latest Appearance: December 10, 2011 Mr Arbuckle is Jon's father who tends the family farm. In his sole animated appearance, A Garfield Christmas Special, he was voiced by Pat Harrington, Jr. and as proved in one strip, has only very rarely been off the farm. He is based on Jim Davis' father, James William Davis. Also, every Christmas he reads the Christmas story \\"Binky, the Clown Who Saved Christmas\\" to everyone. In The Garfield Show, he is voiced by Frank Welker. Doc Boy First Appearance: May 17, 1983 Latest Appearance: November 6, 2011 (at Garfield title) (mentioned July 23, 2015) Doc is Jon's brother who lives on a farm with his mother and father. It remains unknown if he is Jon's older, younger, or twin brother. Nicknamed \\"Doc Boy\\", he often insults Jon, calling him a \\"cappuccino sipping city slicker\\" and a \\"geek in bunny pajamas\\", and worse. One example of his name calling to Jon is when he sends Christmas cards and gifts to Jon that read the word \\"Sissy\\" on them. In one comic strip, Jon gets a letter from 'his brother' (Doc Boy) which is in secret code. Jon says that makes him remember his childhood, and solves the code. It reads, \\"Whoever reads this is a poo-poo head.\\" (which Jon reads out to Garfield) and Garfield says \\"They've gone so far\\". But he is seen to sometimes get along with Jon well, since he plays games with Jon such as \\"Touch the Udder\\" and even sometimes helps out with Jon's projects, remodeling, and surprises for Garfield. He hates being called \\"Doc Boy\\" but puts up with it although he is sometimes seen being angered when his parents even call him \\"Doc Boy\\". Like Garfield, Jon, and Odie, Doc Boy believes in Santa Claus and is seen to either call Jon during Christmas or even stay up to see Santa Claus in excitement. He and Jon are known for competing with each other over who is uglier in their family memory photos to which they compete whenever they look at memory books with their mother. Although he is about the same age as Jon, he is already starting to go bald. He is very immature and has a bad sense of fashion. He was mentioned a few times to have a girlfriend, although it was noted that she is incredibly ugly, as when he showed her picture to Jon and Garfield, Jon looked at it in shock while Garfield commented \\"That is one shiny golden tooth\\". Another example is when Doc Boy was waiting for his girlfriend to show up while Jon was looking at the corral and Jon commented \\"Look at that ugly holstein over there\\", on which Doc Boy angrily said \\"That's my date.\\" This character is based on Jim Davis' real-life brother, David \\"Doc\\" Davis. In A Garfield Christmas Special, he was voiced by David Lander. Doc Boy also appears in The Garfield Show, with Lander reprising his role, but only in six episodes. Grandma First Appearance: January 25, 1982 Latest Appearance: November 6, 2011 (at Garfield title), April 24, 2005 (mentioned December 21, 2009) Jon and Doc Boy's tough, eccentric but kind, caring and loving grandmother. She loves Jon, Garfield, and Odie, and occasionally makes appearances throughout the series. She clearly adores Garfield and loves it when he is in her lap and she is stroking him. Grandma is one of the few people that Garfield liked from the outset-she kicked Odie just like Garfield did. The most is revealed about her in A Garfield Christmas Special, where it is revealed that her husband has died and she talks about her life with him. In the strip, Grandma was originally depicted as an elderly woman, wearing a plain dark dress and her hair in a tight bun; her animated appearances outfit her as an energetic elderly lady in a sweater and jeans; sometimes, she is also seen riding a motorcycle. In A Garfield Christmas Special and Garfield's Thanksgiving, she was voiced by Pat Carroll. Several of her lines from the Christmas special were taken directly from her first week in the newspaper strip. She is Garfield's human great-grandmother. Aunt Gussie First Appearance: August 14, 1981 Aunt Gussie is Jon's aunt. She first appeared August 14 through August 15, 1981, baby-sitting Garfield while Jon took a vacation. She didn't know Garfield stowed away in Jon's suitcase.http://garfield.com/comic/1981-08-15 She later appeared on November 8 through November 12, 1983, when she became mean and had glasses. She was supposed to baby-sit Garfield on the week of April 25, 1988 while Jon was having his tonsils removed, but she did not show up. Garfield, as a result, has a disdain for Aunt Gussie, remarking that she \\"used to double-date with Lizzie Borden.\\" She has a crush on John Travolta. Garfield's mother Garfield's mother first made appearances in the animated specials Garfield on the Town and Garfield: His 9 Lives, as well as a few cameos in the comic strip (including a December 1984 story which was a loose adaptation of Garfield on the Town). Sandi Huge provided her voice in the specials. She also appeared once on Garfield and Friends in an episode called \\"The Garfield Rap.\\" Garfield's grandpa First Appearance: November 10, 1980 Garfield's grandpa first appeared in the strip on November 10, 1980. Garfield was excited to see him, but Grandpa showed similar characteristics to Garfield, immediately asking \\"Where's the refrigerator?\\" Grandpa tells stories to Garfield, including how he weighed 5 pounds, 6 ounces at birth. Grandpa was not there for Garfield's birth, but \\"heard the scream.\\" Grandpa has a very sarcastic personality which is very similar to Garfield's. =Minor recurring characters= Irma First Appearance: June 9, 1979 (first mention by name October 19, 1979) Latest Appearance: November 9, 2019 (mentioned March 3, 2020) Irma is the waitress and owner of \\"Irma's Diner\\", a diner occasionally visited by Jon and Garfield. Irma is a model waitress, when she isn't abusing her customers or shaving her legs at the counter. But then the food isn't much either. Irma is often shown to be behaving oddly, for instance, her idea of a \\"Chicken Surprise\\" is putting on a chicken mask and yelling \\"SURPRISE!!\\" Irma is not particularly intelligent either, for instance, in one strip, Jon is deciding what to eat and decides to have the same thing the man next to him is eating, \\"I'll have what he's having\\", Irma replies by sliding the man's meal directly in front of Jon. Another example is Jon tells Irma that his potato is bad and she begins \\"Spanking\\" it. In another strip, Jon asked Irma why there was a hair in his soup. Irma replies by asking him how he knows that it is not one of his. Jon pulls out the rest of the hair and it turns out that there is a red roller stuck to the hair. He says to Irma that he uses smaller rollers. Jim Davis revealed in Garfield at 25 that he borrowed Irma's name, but not her personality, from his aunt. Herman Post First Appearance: July 19, 1978 Jon Arbuckle's mailman. Garfield constantly torments him by ripping off his pants and leaving him shredded and scratched, and he perpetually tries to find a way to deliver the mail safely, but rarely succeeds. He did, however, succeed in delivering the mail safely by folding the mail into paper airplanes and throwing them at the house, to which Garfield replied \\"NO FAIR!\\". Another, time in which the mail man succeeded was in a Splash screen which had him in a gi and a black belt and Garfield in a defeated position He also wore a knight's armor to discourage Garfield. He can be seen with either yellow, white, or brown colored hair. He was on Garfield and friends for the first four seasons. In The Mail Animal He was even fired because the postmaster thought he was being weak, only to have Garfield treat him worse, resulting in the postmaster begging Post to return to work. In The Garfield Show episode \\"Mailman Blues\\", he goes on vacation in Hawaii while his replacement Stu does the job for him, but before Herman Post goes on vacation, he warns Stu about Garfield, describing him as a \\"monster\\". While Herman Post is on his vacation, Garfield torments Stu. However, Stu quits, and Herman returns early only after receiving a raise. He reveals that this happens every year. It is shown that this has been recurring for 13 years, so it can be presumed that the postmaster from The Mail Animal may have been the first occurrence, even though the two episodes aired roughly 20 years apart. Jon usually refuses to acknowledge Garfield in tormenting Herman, excluding one instance. In one strip, Jon was the one who startled him, reasoning that a sick Garfield asked him to fill in for him in his place. In both series, however, Jon attempts to punish Garfield for his mischief. In Garfield and Friends, the mailman was voiced by Gregg Berger. Binky the Clown First Appearance: September 17, 1986 A television personality noted for his extremely loud and piercing greetings, most notably \\"HEEEEEEEY, KIDS!\\". He appears to be a parody of Bozo the Clown, and in the cartoons shares an exaggerated raspy voice with the Bob Bell portrayal of Bozo (much in the same way Krusty the Clown from The Simpsons does; Krusty's voice was likewise based on Bell's). In Garfield's Halloween Adventure, the character made his first appearance as well as animated appearance and was given a voice. He was first mentioned on March 13, 1985 in the comic strips, previously, other different clown characters were seen. Binky was first seen in the comics on September 15, 1986, then appeared in person on September 17, 1986. On Garfield and Friends, Binky became more of a regular, and would modify his greeting to suit who it was he was greeting, such as \\"HEEEEEEEY, CAT!\\" He also had his own segment on the show during the second and third seasons, called Screaming with Binky, in which he showed up in the midst of a certain activity and performed his trademark greeting, ruining said activity. Most of these segments were cut in syndication, but have been restored for the DVD releases. Like Jon, Binky was voiced by Thom Huge. His first television appearance was on Peace & Quiet. His last was on The Feline Philosopher. Binky apparently owns a small restaurant that Jon and Garfield occasionally eat at called \\"Binky Burger\\". In the Garfield show he was mentioned twice: First in season 2's \\"Blasteroid\\", Jon asks Garfield if he wants to watch Binky, but refuses saying it's in his contract that Binky's not allowed on this show. Then, in season 3's \\"Cupid Cat\\", Garfield states Doc Boy looked just like Binky, and breaks the Fourth Wall by asking the audience if anyone remembered Binky, which he doubts by saying \\"I didn't think so\\". Also Binky once mugged uncle roy, a cartoon character only mentioned in the strips. Garfield chews the fat Squeak First Appearance: October 30, 1984 Squeak is a little grey mouse who is a semi-regular character. Since Garfield is too lazy to be bothered with mousing, he and Squeak have become good friends. Squeak is part of a family of other mice. He first was in the comic strips in the late 1980s. On Garfield and Friends, the same character was named Floyd and voiced by Gregg Berger; a common running gag in the cartoons is his continuous complaints over not appearing often. The character returned to the name Squeak for The Garfield Show, with Berger reprising his role. The Big Vicious Dog First Appearance: September 12, 1995 A dog that often enjoys barking ferociously at Garfield, next to a \\"Beware of Dog\\" sign, hence the name he's been given by several fans. Then he calms down, and the strip continues in a normal way. His rear end is rarely seen. He is also known as Chain Dog. =Neighbors= Hubert and Reba * Hubert and Reba are an elderly couple who live near Jon. Hubert is often portrayed as an older man, while Reba is often either unseen or tending to household chores. The couple made an appearance in Here Comes Garfield. In the animated cartoon, Hubert is portrayed as hostile towards Garfield and Odie (which is not entirely without justification as Garfield tore up their yard and knocked a bunch of flowers and dirt on Hubert's head), calling the animal shelter personnel to remove them. In the strips, Hubert is less hostile towards Garfield. Mrs. Feeny Mrs. Feeny is an unseen character in the comic strip, tormented by Garfield. For this reason, she regularly calls Jon to complain about him. She also tends to get revenge on Jon for Garfield's pranks. She owns a small pet dog, a regular victim of Garfield's abuse. She also, at one point, had a Weimaraner dog that Garfield had epoxied to a cross-town bus; and she had a bird named Mr. Sweety Wings who was another victim of Garfield's. Mrs. Feeny (originally spelled Feeney) was one of several neighbors, which included a Mrs. Woonduck; a Mrs. Nostrum and a Mrs. Peebrik who had been calling and complaining to Jon about Garfield's abusive behavior of their dogs. She has a husband who is also a victim of Garfield's pranks and abuses. In one instance, Mrs. Feeny called Jon complaining over Garfield shipping him and her dog to Wisconsin to work as clowns. Ellen Ellen (first mentioned in November 9, 1990) is a local woman whom Jon often tried to go out with. Originally, she was also an unseen character in the strip as well; most Ellen strips originally centered on Jon speaking to Ellen on the telephone, attempting to ask her out on a date. In a 2006 story, Ellen appeared in the strip after Jon convinced her to go on a date because she had amnesia and couldn't remember how much she despised him. She was persuaded to go on a date with him, and on July 20, 2006, the strip finally showed her as a blonde woman with a striped dress. =Others= Guido and Fluffy Guido and Fluffy were 2 cats who help Garfield escape from the city pound in a comic strip of January 1981. In the TV special Here Comes Garfield, Fluffy was a dog instead of a cat, and Guido's name is \\"Eddie\\". Wheezer Wheezer is Jon's old school friend. He calls Jon \\"Carp Face\\". Wheezer visited Jon at his house April 23, 1990 through April 29, 1990. The two reminisce about their embarrassing high school memories. Later in the comic, Jon saw Wheezer at his high-school reunion.  Frank  First Appearance: January 23, 1980 Frank is a Garfield character that only appears in one comic released on 23 January 1980. In it when Jon welcomes Frank to Garfield he attacks Frank as he says \\"some people rub me the wrong way.\\" He returns as a waiter later in the comic strip.  Frank (spider)  First Appearance: September 27, 1997 Frank (spider) is a spider who appears twice by name. It is a generic black spider who appears with a buddy spider. In one of them Frank (spider) is with Estelle, another spider.  Stretch  First Appearance: June 19, 1984 Stretch is Garfield's rubber chicken, who was given to Garfield on his 6th birthday. It only appeared for five days after, yet makes cameo appearances from time to time, mainly used as a weapon against Jon. Cartoons =Garfield and Friends characters= Cactus Jake Cactus Jake is the foreman of the Polecat Flats ranch, and a friend of Jon. He was seen only in the TV series and had a habit of calling Garfield \\"Garfunkel\\". Whenever Garfield wore a cowboy outfit, Jake always believed that he really was a cowboy named \\"Shorty\\" (Jon would always recognize \\"Shorty\\" as Garfield, however). Jake's voice was provided by Pat Buttram. First appeared: Polecat Flats. Last appeared: The Multiple Choice Cartoon. Last appearance (mentioned): Stairway to Stardom. The Buddy Bears The Buddy Bears are a trio of singing bear cubs who encourage viewers to \\"always agree with the group\\" (similar to The Get Along Gang). Their names are Bobby (tallest), Billy, and Bertie (shortest). They were voiced by Lorenzo Music, Thom Huge, and Gregg Berger with sped up voices. One of Garfield's goals and main way of defeating them when they interfered in his life was to make them disagree, thereby introducing strife into their affected harmony. One notable effort involved making them decide on which two toppings to put on pizza, for, as Garfield stated as the episode ended, \\"No two people can agree on which two toppings a pizza should have.\\" Garfield disliked their mindless agreement, stressing that their love of harmony and cooperation was not right, and says that they should express their honest opinions and think independently and critically. Mr. Burnside Mr. Irving Burnside is Jon's next-door neighbor, who is constantly annoyed by Garfield stealing his food and would take it out on Jon. Early on in the sixth season, he was pushed so far as to rent his house out. Shortly after moving, Burnside found out that without Garfield stealing his food, he and his wife Alice were getting overweight, so they agreed to move back. He is voiced by Gregg Berger. Penelope Pussycat Penelope Pussycat served as another love interest for Garfield, appearing only in the show's last three seasons, quickly becoming a regular even with only three episodes being labeled by their titles as \\"Penelope episodes\\". She is a beige pussy cat with a cute mole on the right side of her face near her mouth. Penelope lives in an Italian restaurant, which is no doubt one of the main reason that Garfield goes out with her, since this wasn't revealed till the second \\"Penelope episode\\". The fact that Garfield enjoys eating more than being with her annoys Penelope, but she willingly goes out with him anyway, because as she says, \\"I don't care what we do as long as we do it together.\\" She was replaced by Arlene in The Garfield Show. She is voiced by Victoria Jackson. =The Garfield Show characters= Eddie Gourmand A chef who's usually seen in a televised cooking show. His show nearly got canceled because most people find it tedious, though its ratings improved when a cake monster invaded the studio. He opened a theme park made of cheese which wasn't well-liked. He once became violent and used a rolling pin in an attempt to strike Garfield that tasted one of his dishes. He was fired from his job once by Mr. Station Manager Sir for showing the viewers what unhealthy foods to eat, but he was rehired after Mr. Station Manager Sir's new show got the least ratings. The reason for his morbid obesity comes from his horrible childhood years. He is voiced by Frank Welker. Hercules A lonely Chihuahua who lives in Garfield's neighborhood. He, along with some other dogs, helped save Vito and the pizzeria from a blaze. He is voiced by Jason Marsden and Wally Wingert. Catzilla Catzilla was a wild feline descended from saber-toothed cats.

In certain episodes, Vito's Pizza is sometimes in trouble, such as in \\"Love and Lasagna\\", where Brent Mogul tries to tear it down for a tanning salon until Garfield and Odie save the store. In other episodes, Garfield's love of Vito's food causes trouble. He also appears in the Garfield comic book as Jon and Garfield's preferred provider of pizza. Al and Pete Two incompetent members of animal control. Al's eyes are never seen because they're always hidden behind his hat. Replaced in a one-off episode by a T3000 terminator animal controller until assisted in getting their jobs back by Garfield. Mr. Allwork An egotistical businessman who has the tendency to sue everybody for no reason and buy many companies to become a multi-billionaire. He has a son named Jack who he rarely spends time with until Jon convinced him to. He served as the main villain in the second full-length episode, \\"Unfair Weather\\". He is voiced by Jack Riley. Dr. Thaddeus Bonkers A mad scientist who loves to do experiments. His first appearance was in \\"Virtualodeon\\", where by watching Virtualodeon, Garfield gets sucked into the TV. He returns in \\"Night of the Bunny Slippers\\", and \\"Me, Garfield and I\\". Drusilla and Minerva Jon's annoying and twin nieces, they love to dress and give makeovers to animals particularly Garfield. Garfield and Odie once used the outfits they provided in order to track down thieves who took spare ribs. When Nermal kidnaps Pooky to blackmail the orange tabby into becoming a servant, Garfield summons Drusilla and Minerva to mess with Nermal. In one of their most recent appearances, it is revealed that they can't tell each other apart due to how single minded they are. They are voiced by Laura Summer. Aunt Ivy Jon's bossy aunt, who expects her relatives to wait on her hand and foot. She stays with Jon twice, first after her power line is destroyed by a fallen tree branch then when her house is being rid of mice. While she expects any of her demands to be met, but refuses any request others ask of her no matter how reasonable. While Garfield hates her like everyone else, he likes having her visit because \\"Compared to Aunt Ivy, he actually seems easy to live with.\\" Jonah A pessimistic Black cat who appeared in the episode \\"Black Cat Blues\\". He constantly crosses character's paths, giving those bad luck, because he's upset about breaking up with his girlfriend. This stops when Garfield gets them back together. He also appears at \\"Garfield's Party in The Big Sleep\\" as one of the characters who was kicked out of Nermal's \\"Eating and Sleeping for Hibernation\\" party. Evil Space Lasagnas Living Lasagnas who want to conquer Earth but are afraid of Garfield after witnessing his prodigious appetite for lasagna as food. They appear in 3 episodes; Pasta Wars, Blasteroid, and Cuter than Cute. In Pasta Wars, A group of these lasagnas attempt to assess the risks of conquering Earth, only to come across Garfield eating his birthday lasagna. In Blasteroid the lasagnas pluck a meatball asteroid from orbit of their planet, \\"Parma\\", and launch it toward Earth. And in Cuter than Cute, They send a warrior named Spumoni, disguised as a cute kitten, to find the weakness of Garfield. This backfires majorly as they attempt to bring the wayward Spumoni, they also bring Garfield.

Neferkitty Leader of an ancient tribe of cats that once tried to take over the world and were banished to another dimension. Garfield tricks her into entering the human world alone where she is forcibly adopted by Liz's annoying niece Heather who renames her \\"Fuzzbutton\\" much to her chagrin. Since then she swears vengeance on Garfield and Odie. Mrs. Cauldron Mrs. Cauldron is Jon's next-door neighbor who is actually a witch, first seen in \\"Which Witch\\". Since season 2, Garfield has always suspected who she really was, claiming in \\"Bewitched - Familiar Familiar (Part 1)\\" that \\"No one can survive an entire episode with Drusilla and Minerva. Mrs. Cauldron has 2 nieces: her oldest, Winona who briefly had crushes on Jon and Doc Boy and Abigail, who is a witch-in-training. She is voiced by June Foray.

She is another version of Liz Wilson. Other * ' often appear in the comic strip. Garfield, who despises spiders, whacks them with newspapers. However, sometimes the spiders do manage to outwit Garfield. Guido, a house spider, usually appears to annoy Garfield. * Birds often appear as Garfield hunts and (usually) eats them, usually by lying in ambush near the birdbath, or lying on the ground waiting for birds to land on him. Whenever Jon brings a bird, usually a canary, in as a third pet, Garfield will attempt to eat them, often successfully. * Fish are frequently brought in by Jon also as an attempt to add a third pet to the house and are quickly eaten by Garfield. Apparently he enjoys these and the canaries Jon also brings so much he has requested these as pizza toppings. * ' Jon's house is also inhabited by mice, many of whom make cameo appearances in the strip. They are often portrayed as living their own social lives in their mouse holes. Although Jon wants Garfield to get rid of the mice, Garfield spares the mice and is even a friend of them. Though he comes from a family of expert mouse-catchers, (his mother, father and grandfather for example), Garfield thinks that eating mice is disgusting. As he once famously put it, \\"Show me a cat that's a good mouser, and I'll show you a cat with bad breath.\\" As a result, the mice generally have the run of the house. On at least three occasions, the mice have been given names: one named Squeak has appeared sporadically since the 1980s, and one named Herman Vermin in the late 1990s, which is mentioned in some strips. There is also one mouse named Stretch, similar to Garfield's rubber chicken, though only appeared in one strip. In Garfield and Friends, a mouse named Floyd appeared regularly as a friend of Garfield, normally once a season (which he often complained about). Unlike the other mice, Floyd had a pink nose and white pupils like Garfield had. Squeak is featured in The Garfield Show, where he is shown as the leader of a gang of mice. Like his comics counterpart, he is Garfield's friend. * Clive is Garfield's invisible friend, who lives in a room in the attic. In the same game Garfield tries to help him get the toys back in their closets by type (toy cars, toy monsters, toy robots). * Other animals appear in the strip. There was a frog named Herbie seen twice in the strip. His last time in the strip was a Halloween strip when all the animals that were eaten by Garfield was seen in a nightmare. * In a few comics in 1996, Jon had a parrot who talks. Once in the strip, Jon was watching TV until his parrot was about to be eaten by Garfield, so Jon screamed his name. It is now presumably deceased. * Guard Dogs appear in the neighborhood with \\"Beware of dog\\" signs, which they make jokes to. =Inanimate characters= * RX-2 is a talking bathroom scale which insults Garfield when he steps on it. Garfield usually destroys the scale, or threatens to do so, when it insults him. Only made one appearance in an episode of Garfield and Friends and also appeared in Garfield's Thanksgiving. * Garfield's alarm clock often \\"speaks\\" by means of thought bubbles. Garfield often destroys his alarm clock by smashing it. * Plants also speak with by means of thought bubbles. Garfield often eats or stomps on them, much to Jon's annoyance.

Secular ethics refers to any ethical system that does not draw on the supernatural, and includes humanism, secularism and freethinking. A classical example of literature on secular ethics is the Kural text, authored by the ancient Tamil Indian philosopher Valluvar. Secular ethical systems comprise a wide variety of ideas to include the normativity of social contracts, some form of attribution of intrinsic moral value, intuition-based deontology, cultural moral relativism, and the idea that scientific reasoning can reveal objective moral truth (known as science of morality). Secular ethics frameworks are not always mutually exclusive from theological values. For example, the Golden Rule or a commitment to non- violence, could be supported by both religious and secular frameworks. Secular ethics systems can also vary within the societal and cultural norms of a specific time period. Tenets of secular ethics Despite the width and diversity of their philosophical views, secular ethicists generally share one or more principles: *Human beings, through their ability to empathize, are capable of determining ethical grounds. *The well-being of others is central to ethical decision-making *Human beings, through logic and reason, are capable of deriving normative principles of behavior. *This may lead to a behavior preferable to that propagated or condoned based on religious texts. Alternatively, this may lead to the advocacy of a system of moral principles that a broad group of people, both religious and non-religious, can agree upon. *Human beings have the moral responsibility to ensure that societies and individuals act based on these ethical principles. *Societies should, if at all possible, advance from a less ethical and just form to a more ethical and just form. Many of these tenets are applied in the science of morality, the use of the scientific method to answer moral questions. Various thinkers have framed morality as questions of empirical truth to be explored in a scientific context. The science is related to ethical naturalism, a type of ethical realism. In How Good People Make Tough Choices: Resolving the Dilemmas of Ethical Living, Rushworth Kidder identifies four general characteristics of an ethical code: ::1. It is brief ::2. It is usually not explanatory ::3. Can be expressed in a number of forms (e.g. positive or negative, single words or a list of sentences) ::4. Centers on moral valuesKidder 2003. 82 =Humanist ethics= Humanists endorse universal morality based on the commonality of human nature, and that knowledge of right and wrong is based on our best understanding of our individual and joint interests, rather than stemming from a transcendental or arbitrarily local source, therefore rejecting faith completely as a basis for action. The humanist ethics goal is a search for viable individual, social and political principles of conduct, judging them on their ability to enhance human well-being and individual responsibility, thus ultimately eliminating human suffering. The International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU) is the world-wide umbrella organization for those adhering to the Humanist life stance. :Humanism is a democratic and ethical life stance, which affirms that human beings have the right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives. It stands for the building of a more humane society through an ethic based on human and other natural values in the spirit of reason and free inquiry through human capabilities. It is not theistic, and it does not accept supernatural views of reality.Humanism's Unfinished Agenda Humanism is known to adopt principles of the Golden Rule. =Secular ethics and religion= There are those who state that religion is not necessary for moral behavior at all.Is Atheism Consistent With Morality?, paper (2001) by Mark I. Vuletic The Dalai Lama has said that compassion and affection are human values independent of religion: \\"We need these human values. I call these secular ethics, secular beliefs. There‚Äôs no relationship with any particular religion. Even without religion, even as nonbelievers, we have the capacity to promote these things.\\"Interview with the Dalai Lama, The Progressive (January 2006), scroll to Question: Apart from Buddhism, what are your sources of inspiration? The Dalai Lama: Human values. Those who are unhappy with the negative orientation of traditional religious ethics believe that prohibitions can only set the absolute limits of what a society is willing to tolerate from people at their worst, not guide them towards achieving their best. In other words, someone who follows all these prohibitions has just barely avoided being a criminal, not acted as a positive influence on the world. They conclude that rational ethics can lead to a fully expressed ethical life, while religious prohibitions are insufficient. That does not mean secular ethics and religion are mutually exclusive. In fact, many principles, such as the Golden Rule, are present in both systems, and some religious people, as well as some Deists, prefer to adopt a rational approach to ethics. Examples of secular ethical codes =Humanist Manifestos= The Humanist Manifestos are three manifestos, the first published in 1933, that outline the philosophical views and stances of humanists. Integral to the manifestos is a lack of supernatural guidance. =Alternatives to the Ten Commandments= There are numerous versions of Alternatives to the Ten Commandments =Girl Scout law= The Girl Scout law is as follows: :I will do my best to be :::honest and fair, :::friendly and helpful, :::considerate and caring, :::courageous and strong, and :::responsible for what I say and do, :and to :::respect myself and others, :::respect authority, :::use resources wisely, :::make the world a better place, and :::be a sister to every Girl Scout. =United States Naval Academy honor concept= \\"Midshipmen are persons of integrity: They stand for that which is right. :::They tell the truth and ensure that the full truth is known. They do not lie. :::They embrace fairness in all actions. They ensure that work submitted as their own is their own, and that assistance received from any source is authorized and properly documented. They do not cheat. :::They respect the property of others and ensure that others are able to benefit from the use of their own property. They do not steal.\\" =Minnesota Principles= The Minnesota Principles were proposed \\"by the Minnesota Center for Corporate Responsibility in 1992 as a guide to international business activities\\": # Business activities must be characterized by fairness. We understand fairness to include equitable treatment and equality of opportunity for all participants in the marketplace. # Business activities must be characterized by honesty. We understand honesty to include candor, truthfulness and promise-keeping. # Business activities must be characterized by respect for human dignity. We understand this to mean that business activities should show a special concern for the less powerful and the disadvantaged. # Business activities must be characterized by respect for the environment. We understand this to mean that business activities should promote sustainable development and prevent environmental degradation and waste of resources.Kidder 2003. 83‚Äì84 =Rotary Four-Way Test= The Four-Way Test is the \\"linchpin of Rotary International's ethical practice.\\" It acts as a test of thoughts as well as actions. It asks, \\"Of the things we think, say, or do\\": #Is it the truth? #Is it fair to all concerned? #Will it build goodwill and better friendships? #Will it be beneficial to all concerned? =Military codes= As the United States Constitution prohibits the establishment of a government religion, US military codes of conduct typically contain no religious overtones. West Point Honor Code The West Point honor code states that \\"A cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do.\\" The non-toleration clause is key in differentiating it from numerous other codes. Nature and ethics Whether or not the relationships between animals found in nature and between people in early human evolution can provide a basis for human morality is a persistently unresolved question. Thomas Henry Huxley wrote in Evolution and Ethics in 1893 that people make a grave error in trying to create moral ideas from the behavior of animals in nature. He remarked: Famous biologist and writer Stephen Jay Gould has stated that \\"answers will not be read passively from nature\\" and \\"[t]he factual state of the world does not teach us how we, with our powers for good and evil, should alter or preserve it in the most ethical manner\\". Thus, he concluded that ideas of morality should come from a form of higher mental reason, with nature viewed as an independent phenomenon. Evolutionary ethics is not the only way to involve nature with ethics. For example, there are ethically realist theories like ethical naturalism. Related to ethical naturalism is also the idea that ethics are best explored, not just using the lens of philosophy, but science as well (a science of morality). Key philosophers and philosophical texts =Valluvar= Valluvar (a theist who wrote a secular text) statue in SOAS, University of London. Thiruvalluvar, a South Indian poet-philosopher and the author of the Kural, a non-denominational Classical Tamil work on secular ethics and morality, is believed to have lived about the 1st century BCE to 5th century CE. While others of his time chiefly focused on the praise of God, culture and the ruler of the land, Valluvar focused on the moral behaviors of the common individual. Valluvar limits his theistic teachings to the introductory chapter of the Kural text, the \\"Praise of God.\\" Throughout the text thereafter, he focuses on the everyday moral behaviors of an individual, thus making the text a secular one. Even in the introductory chapter, he refrains from mentioning the name of any particular god but only addresses God in generic terms as \\"the Creator,\\" \\"the truly Wise One,\\" \\"the One of eight-fold excellence,\\" and so forth. Translated into about 40 world languages, the Kural text remains one of the most widely translated non-religious works in the world. Praised as \\"the Universal Veda,\\" it emphasizes on the ethical edifices of non-violence, moral vegetarianism, casteless human brotherhood, absence of desires, path of righteousness and truth, and so forth, besides covering a wide range of subjects such as moral codes of rulers, friendship, agriculture, knowledge and wisdom, sobriety, love, and domestic life. =Holyoake= Holyoake, agnostic George Jacob Holyoake's 1896 publication English Secularism defines secularism thus: \\"Secularism is a code of duty pertaining to this life, founded on considerations purely human, and intended mainly for those who find theology indefinite or inadequate, unreliable or unbelievable. Its essential principles are three: (1) The improvement of this life by material means. (2) That science is the available Providence of man. (3) That it is good to do good. Whether there be other good or not, the good of the present life is good, and it is good to seek that good.\\"Holyoake, George J. (1896). English Secularism. Chicago: The Open Court Publishing Company. Holyoake held that secularism should take no interest at all in religious questions (as they were irrelevant), and was thus to be distinguished from strong freethought and atheism. In this he disagreed with Charles Bradlaugh, and the disagreement split the secularist movement between those who argued that anti-religious movements and activism was not necessary or desirable and those who argued that it was. =Nietzsche= Nietzsche, atheistFriedrich Nietzsche based his work on ethics on the rejection of Christianity and authority in general, or on moral nihilism. Nietzsche's many works spoke of a Master-Slave Morality, The Will to Power, or something stronger that overcomes the weaker and Darwinistic adaptation and will to live. Nietzsche expressed his moral philosophy throughout his collection of works; the most important of these to secular ethics being The Gay Science (in which the famous God is dead phrase was first used), Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Beyond Good and Evil and On The Genealogy of Morals. =Kant= Kant, theist (disputably Christian) On ethics, Kant wrote works that both described the nature of universal principles and also sought to demonstrate the procedure of their application. Kant maintained that only a \\"good will\\" is morally praiseworthy, so that doing what appears to be ethical for the wrong reasons is not a morally good act. Kant's emphasis on one's intent or reasons for acting is usually contrasted with the utilitarian tenet that the goodness of an action is to be judged solely by its results. Utilitarianism is a hypothetical imperative, if one wants _____, they must do ______. Contrast this with the Kantian ethic of the categorical imperative, where the moral act is done for its own sake, and is framed: One must do ______ or alternatively, one must not do ______. For instance, under Kantian ethics, if a person were to give money to charity because failure to do so would result in some sort of punishment from a god or Supreme Being, then the charitable donation would not be a morally good act. A dutiful action must be performed solely out of a sense of duty; any other motivation profanes the act and strips it of its moral quality. =Utilitarianism= John Stuart Mill, developer of Jeremy Bentham's utility-based theory Utilitarianism (from the Latin utilis, useful) is a theory of ethics that prescribes the quantitative maximization of good consequences for a population. It is a form of consequentialism. This good to be maximized is usually happiness, pleasure, or preference satisfaction. Though some utilitarian theories might seek to maximize other consequences, these consequences generally have something to do with the welfare of people (or of people and nonhuman animals). For this reason, utilitarianism is often associated with the term welfarist consequentialism. In utilitarianism it is the \\"end result\\" which is fundamental (as opposed to Kantian ethics discussed above). Thus using the same scenario as above, it would be irrelevant whether the person giving money to charity was doing so out of personal or religious conviction, the mere fact that the charitable donation is being made is sufficient for it to be classified as morally good.

The complex, parts of which were over 100 years old, was located on Dort Highway, stretching along Robert T. Longway Boulevard past Center Road. The plant produced numerous automotive components, including instrument panels, instrument clusters, spark plugs, filters, air meters, fuel pumps and other parts. Flint East once employed nearly 14,000 people, but by 2007, the number was down to nearly 1,100 hourly workers. The plant closed entirely in November 2013 and the remaining buildings were razed. In 2017, Phoenix Investors, a Wisconsin-based commercial real estate firm, purchased the land. Delphi's Flint Technical Center was also located on the site. In March 2007, it was announced that the company's technical centers, including Flint, would be consolidated to a single facility in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Hourly workers at the plant were represented by UAW Local 651. History After losing control of Champion Ignition Company, Albert Champion founded the AC Spark Plug Company in 1908 in a Buick building in Flint, Michigan. It was purchased by General Motors Corporation in 1909 to supply the growing automobile company, and AC Spark Plug moved a few years later to a factory at Harriet Street and Industrial Avenue. The Dort Motor Car Company began building automobiles on the east side of the city in 1915, in a factory that would later be part of Flint East. In 1924, an economic downturn weakened the company and J. Dallas Dort's health began to fail, and the company folded and the complex was sold to AC Spark Plug in 1925. AC Spark Plug continued operations in both the Harriet Street and Dort Highway facilities until 1975, when the Harriet Street plant was closed and razed. In 1987, AC took over the former Chevrolet facilities on Chevrolet Avenue in Flint, naming that complex Flint West, and the Dort Highway facility became Flint East. The following year, AC Spark Plug and Rochester Products Division merged, becoming AC Rochester. For a time, the division's headquarters remained at Flint East, but soon moved to the Great Lakes Tech Center on the old Fisher #1 site. Further consolidation among GM's divisions led to the division being renamed AC Delco Systems in 1994, and in 1995, the entire Automotive Components Group became Delphi Automotive Systems. In 1998, fearing a strike over a $200 million investment that had not materialized, GM began to pull critical dies from the Flint Metal Fab plant on the other side of town, to be shipped to another plant. The UAW workers at the plant immediately went on strike to protest the move. Mostly in response to this, but also because of fears that their own work would be moved elsewhere, workers at Flint East went on strike a week later on June 11. Since Flint East was the sole source of some parts for almost the entire company, within two weeks, virtually all of General Motors was shut down. On July 28, GM agreed to the investment to Flint Metal Fab and to keep Flint East open until at least 2000. The union agreed to cooperate on efforts to increase productivity at both plants. The strike cost GM an estimated US$2.8 billion. Shortly after the strike, it was announced that Delphi would be spun off in 1999 into what is now Delphi Corporation, and Flint East was for a time part of Delphi's Energy and Engine Management Systems division. In 2002, ongoing financial problems caused the plant to be placed in the Automotive Holdings Group, a collection of under performing plants that Delphi felt needed to be fixed, sold, or closed. Delphi declared bankruptcy in October 2005, and announced plans to close or sell 21 of its 29 US plants by Jan 1, 2008, including Flint East. Spark plug production, already greatly reduced, ended in early 2006. The plant has since been razed since early 2010 according to Flint-based newspaper The Flint Journal and WJRT-12, an ABC affiliate. Under an agreement reached by Delphi, General Motors, and the UAW in June 2007, Flint East and two other plants would remain open, but operated by GM or a third party designated by GM. Four other UAW-represented plants would be kept by Delphi, four sold, and at least ten others closed under the agreement. =Flint Faience Tile= In 1921, Champion founded the Flint Faience Tile Company in a building adjacent to the Harriet Street factory, firing decorative tiles in the same kilns as spark plugs. This was done so they could avoid shutting down the kilns when they were finished with spark plug production, because repeated cycles of cooling and reheating would damage the kilns. When AC expanded its operations to the former Dort Motor complex, Flint Faience moved to a new building there. The northwest portion of the plant still has these tiles along the outside, visible from Dort Highway and Davison Road. In 1933, General Motors closed the tile operation because of increased demand on the kilns for spark plugs.

Several effects control the motion of the fluid, including momentum (inertia), diffusion and buoyancy (density differences). Pure jets and pure plumes define flows that are driven entirely by momentum and buoyancy effects, respectively. Flows between these two limits are usually described as forced plumes or buoyant jets. \\"Buoyancy is defined as being positive\\" when, in the absence of other forces or initial motion, the entering fluid would tend to rise. Situations where the density of the plume fluid is greater than its surroundings (i.e. in still conditions, its natural tendency would be to sink), but the flow has sufficient initial momentum to carry it some distance vertically, are described as being negatively buoyant.Turner, J.S. (1979), \\"Buoyancy effects in fluids\\", Ch.6, pp.165--&, Cambridge University Press Movement Usually, as a plume moves away from its source, it widens because of entrainment of the surrounding fluid at its edges. Plume shapes can be influenced by flow in the ambient fluid (for example, if local wind blowing in the same direction as the plume results in a co-flowing jet). This usually causes a plume which has initially been 'buoyancy-dominated' to become 'momentum-dominated' (this transition is usually predicted by a dimensionless number called the Richardson number). = Flow and detection = A further phenomenon of importance is whether a plume has laminar flow or turbulent flow. Usually there is a transition from laminar to turbulent as the plume moves away from its source. This phenomenon can be clearly seen in the rising column of smoke from a cigarette. When high accuracy is required, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can be employed to simulate plumes, but the results can be sensitive to the turbulence model chosen. CFD is often undertaken for rocket plumes, where condensed phase constituents can be present in addition to gaseous constituents. These types of simulations can become quite complex, including afterburning and thermal radiation, and (for example) ballistic missile launches are often detected by sensing hot rocket plumes. Similarly, spacecraft managers are sometimes concerned with impingement of attitude control system thruster plumes onto sensitive subsystems like solar arrays and star trackers. Another phenomenon which can also be seen clearly in the flow of smoke from a cigarette is that the leading-edge of the flow, or the starting-plume, is quite often approximately in the shape of a ring-vortex (smoke ring).Turner, J. S. (1962). The Starting Plume in Neutral Surroundings, J. Fluid Mech. vol 13, pp356-368 Types Pollutants released to the ground can work their way down into the groundwater, leading to groundwater pollution. The resulting body of polluted water within an aquifer is called a plume, with its migrating edges called plume fronts. Plumes are used to locate, map, and measure water pollution within the aquifer's total body of water, and plume fronts to determine directions and speed of the contamination's spreading in it.Fetter, C.W. Jr 1998 Contaminant Hydrogeology Plumes are of considerable importance in the atmospheric dispersion modelling of air pollution. A classic work on the subject of air pollution plumes is that by Gary Briggs.Briggs, Gary A. (1975). Plume Rise Predictions, Chapter 3 in Lectures on Air Pollution and Environmental Impact Analysis, Duanne A. Haugen, editor, Amer. Met. Soc. A thermal plume is one which is generated by gas rising above heat source. The gas rises because thermal expansion makes warm gas less dense than the surrounding cooler gas. Simple plume modeling Quite simple modelling will enable many properties of fully developed, turbulent plumes to be investigated.Scase, M. M., Caulfield, C. P., Dalziel, S. B. & Hunt, J. C. R. (2006). Time-dependent plumes and jets with decreasing source strengths, J. Fluid Mech. vol 563, pp443-461 # It is usually sufficient to assume that the pressure gradient is set by the gradient far from the plume (this approximation is similar to the usual Boussinesq approximation). # The distribution of density and velocity across the plume are modelled either with simple Gaussian distributions or else are taken as uniform across the plume (the so-called 'top hat' model). # The rate of entrainment into the plume is proportional to the local velocity.Morton, B. R., Turner, J. S., and Taylor, G.I. (1956), Turbulent gravitational convection from maintained and instantaneous sources, P. Roy. Soc. Lond., vol. 234, pp.1--& Though initially thought to be a constant, recent work has shown that the entrainment coefficient varies with the local Richardson number.Kaminski, E. Tait, S. and Carazzo, G. (2005), Turbulent entrainment in jets with arbitrary buoyancy, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 526, pp.361--376 Typical values for the entrainment coefficient are of about 0.08 for vertical jets and 0.12 for vertical, buoyant plumes whilst for bent-over plumes, the entrainment coefficient is about 0.6. # Conservation equations for mass (including entrainment), and momentum and buoyancy fluxes are sufficient for a complete description of the flow in many cases,Woods, A.W. (2010), Turbulent plumes in nature, Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech., Vol. 42, pp. 391--412 For a simple rising plume these equations predict that the plume will widen at a constant half-angle of about 6 to 15 degrees. Gaussian plume modelling Gaussian plume models can be used in several fluid dynamics scenarios to calculate concentration distribution of solutes such as a smoke stack release or contaminant released in a river. Gaussian distributions are established by Fickian diffusion, and follow a gaussian (bell-shaped) distribution. For calculating the expected concentration of a one dimensional instantaneous point source we consider a mass M released at an instantaneous point in time, in a one dimensional domain along x. This will give the following equation:Heidi Nepf. 1.061 Transport Processes in the Environment. Fall 2008. Massachusetts Institute of Technology: MIT OpenCourseWare, https://ocw.mit.edu License: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA. C(x,t)=\\\\frac{M}{\\\\sqrt{4\\\\pi Dt} }\\\\exp\\\\left (\\\\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{4D(t-t_0)}\\\\right ) where M is the mass released at time t=t_0 and location x=x_0, and D is the diffusivity \\\\left [\\\\frac{\\\\text{m}^2}{\\\\text{s}}\\\\right ].

The species was first described by Johann Siegfried Hufnagel in 1766. It is found from North Africa west through South Europe and Central Europe. In the north it is in parts of Ireland, Scotland, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Estonia. Further east the range stretches from southern Russia and Asia minor to the Caucasus. This species has a wingspan of 38‚Äì46 mm. The forewings are dark brown, often variegated with paler and reddish patches and usually with prominent whitish postterminal fascia. The hindwings are very distinctive, pale straw coloured with a broad blackish band at the margin. Technical description and variation Wingspan 38‚Äì46 mm. Forewing grey brown with darker dusting and suffusion; veins towards termen pale grey; a slight rufous tinge longitudinally along both folds, more conspicuous at the outer edge of reniform stigma; inner and outer lines black, conversely pale edged; the submarginal obscurely pale, indented on each fold, and preceded by a dark shade; the three stigmata black edged, their centres more or less tinged with rufous, the orbicular and reniform with an obscure pale ring; hindwing straw yellow with a broad fuscous terminal border, broadening at apex; in the form texta Esp. the forewing is darker and duller, with the paler markings all obscured.Seitz, A.

The S&D; had formally taken over by the time an extension eastwards to Saltburn was completed in August 1861 - this diverged from the original line just short of the existing terminus (part of which remained in use for goods traffic) and so a new through station had to be constructed. This was built in a similar style to that used by G T Andrews elsewhere on the NER, with an impressive frontage and overall roof. However it also had only a single platform (a configuration popular elsewhere on the S&D; and NER), which led to congestion and delays during the summer months when traffic levels were at their heaviest. A second platform outside the train shed was eventually provided for westbound services by the LNER in 1935.NERA Tour Middlesbrough to Saltburn Tour Today the original train shed is no longer used, a replacement eastbound platform having been constructed alongside it at the end of the 1980s. The level crossing here utilised motorised wooden boom gates that swung out across the road for many years, but these latterly became increasingly unreliable and prone to failure in high winds.

A movie directed by Sandip Ray has been made based on the story (released in December 2008). An extensive shoot schedule at Hong Kong during May 2008 takes Feluda movies to a new height. The book was published by Ananda Publishers in 1983. Plot summary A famous painting by the Italian maestro Tintoretto is gifted to the Niyogi family by the aristocratic Italian Cassini family. However, not everyone is aware of the value of the painting. One of the family members(disguised) steals it, and international buyers are interested in it. Feluda chases the criminals all the way to Hong Kong. There was a surprise waiting for him there. Eventually, Feluda (with the help of a relative stranger, who turns out to be a Niyogi family member) succeeds in solving the mystery. =Feluda and the former Maharajas= The native princes play an interesting part in the history of British India. Though under the protection of the British Raj, they had a certain amount of power within their domain. Apart from patronizing cricket in India, many of them were involved in promoting social and cultural activities in India. In 'Tintorettor Jishu' we meet the (fictional) former Maharaja of Bhagwanagarh, Mr. Bhudev Singh. Another former Maharaja Suraj Singh appears in 'Golapi Mukta Rahashya'. The young prince of Rupnaryangarh plays an important role in 'Eber Kando Kedarnathe'.

Criminal law in some countries or for some conspiracies may require that at least one overt act be undertaken in furtherance of that agreement, to constitute an offense. There is no limit on the number participating in the conspiracy and, in most countries, no requirement that any steps have been taken to put the plan into effect (compare attempts which require proximity to the full offense). For the purposes of concurrence, the actus reus is a continuing one and parties may join the plot later and incur joint liability and conspiracy can be charged where the co-conspirators have been acquitted or cannot be traced. Finally, repentance by one or more parties does not affect liability (unless, in some cases, it occurs before the parties have committed overt acts) but may reduce their sentence. An unindicted co-conspirator, or unindicted conspirator, is a person or entity that is alleged in an indictment to have engaged in conspiracy, but who is not charged in the same indictment. Prosecutors choose to name persons as unindicted co-conspirators for a variety of reasons including grants of immunity, pragmatic considerations, and evidentiary concerns. England and Wales =Common law offence= At common law, the crime of conspiracy was capable of infinite growth, able to accommodate any new situation and to criminalize it if the level of threat to society was sufficiently great. The courts were therefore acting in the role of the legislature to create new offences and, following the Law Commission Report No. 76 on Conspiracy and Criminal Law Reform,Report on Conspiracy and Criminal Law Reform [1976] EWLC 76 (1 January 1976) the Criminal Law Act 1977 produced a statutory offence and abolished all the common law varieties of conspiracy, except two: that of conspiracy to defraud, and that of conspiracy to corrupt public morals or to outrage public decency. Conspiracy to defraud Section 5(2) of the Criminal Law Act 1977 preserved the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud.Criminal Law Act 1977 Section 5(2) Conspiracy to defraud was defined in Scott v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis per Viscount Dilhorne:Scott v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis (1974) UKHL 4; [1975] AC 819, 839 Conspiracy to corrupt public morals or to outrage public decency Section 5(3) Criminal Law Act 1977Criminal Law Act 1977 Section 5(3) preserved the common law offence of conspiracy to corrupt public morals or of conspiracy to outrage public decency. Conspiracy to corrupt public morals is an offence under the common law of England and Wales.Shaw v Director of Public Prosecutions [1962] AC 220, [1961] 2 WLR 897, [1961] 2 All ER 446, 125 JP 437, 105 Sol Jo 421, 45 Cr App R 113, HL; Knuller (Publishing, Printing and Promotions) Ltd v Director of Public Prosecutions [1973] AC 435, [1972] 3 WLR 143, [1972] 2 All ER 898, 136 JP 728, 116 Sol Jo 545, 56 Cr App R 633, HL Conspiracy to outrage public decency is an offence under the common law of England and Wales.Knuller (Publishing, Printing and Promotions) Ltd v Director of Public Prosecutions ; [1973] AC 435, [1972] 3 WLR 143, [1972] 2 All ER 898, 136 JP 728, 116 Sol Jo 545, 56 Cr App R 633, HL (Lords Diplock and Reid dissenting) Section 5(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1977 does not affect the common law offence of conspiracy if, and in so far as, it can be committed by entering into an agreement to engage in conduct which tends to corrupt public morals, or which outrages public decency, but which does not amount to or involve the commission of an offence if carried out by a single person otherwise than in pursuance of an agreement.Criminal Law Act 1977, section 5(3) One authority maintains that conspiracy to \\"corrupt public morals\\" has no definitive case law, that it is unknown whether or not it is a substantive offence, and that it is unlikely that conspirators will be prosecuted for this offence. These two offences cover situations where, for example, a publisher encourages immoral behavior through explicit content in a magazine or periodical, as in the 1970 case of Knuller (Publishing, Printing and Promotions) Ltd v Director of Public Prosecutions, which ultimately was decided in 1973 by the House of Lords. In the 1991 case of R v Rowley,R v Rowley, [1991] 4 All ER 649 the defendant left notes in public places over a period of three weeks offering money and presents to boys with the intention of luring them for immoral purposes, but there was nothing lewd, obscene or disgusting in the notes, nor were they printed by a newsmagazine at the behest of Rowley, which would have invoked the element of conspiracy. The judge ruled that the jury was entitled to look at the purpose behind the notes in deciding whether they were lewd or disgusting. On appeal against conviction, it was held that an act outraging public decency required a deliberate act which was in itself lewd, obscene or disgusting, so Rowley's motive in leaving the notes was irrelevant and, since there was nothing in the notes themselves capable of outraging public decency, the conviction was quashed. =Statutory offence= This offence was created as a result of the Law Commission's recommendations in their Report, Conspiracy and Criminal Law Reform, 1976, Law Com No 76. This was part of the Commission's programme of codification of the criminal law. The eventual aim was to abolish all the remaining common law offences and replace them, where appropriate, with offences precisely defined by statute. The common law offences were seen as unacceptably vague and open to development by the courts in ways which might offend the principle of certainty. There was an additional problem that it could be a criminal conspiracy at common law to engage in conduct which was not in itself a criminal offence: see Law Com No 76, para 1.7. This was a major mischief at which the 1977 Act was aimed, although it retained the convenient concept of a common law conspiracy to defraud: see Law Com No 76, paras 1.9 and 1.16. Henceforward, according to the Law Commission, it would only be an offence to agree to engage in a course of conduct which was itself a criminal offence. Section 1(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1977 provides: Section 1A (inserted by the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998, s5) bans conspiracies part of which occurred in England and Wales to commit an act or the happening of some other event outside the United Kingdom which constitutes an offence under the law in force in that country or territory. Many conditions apply including that prosecutions need consent from the Attorney General. Exceptions * Under section 2(1) the intended victim of the offence can not be guilty of conspiracy. * Under section 2(2) there can be no conspiracy where the only other person(s) to the agreement are: Mens rea There must be an agreement between two or more persons. The mens rea of conspiracy is a separate issue from the mens rea required of the substantive crime. Lord Bridge in R v Anderson ‚Äì quoted in R v Hussain said:Hussain R. v (2005) EWCA Crim 87 (07 June 2005) at paragraph 125 Lord Bridge in R v Anderson also said: It is not therefore necessary for any action to be taken in furtherance of the criminal purpose in order for a conspiracy offence to have been committed. This distinguishes a conspiracy from an attempt (which necessarily does involve a person doing an act) see Criminal Attempts Act 1981. Things said or done by one conspirator Lord Steyn in R v Hayter said:R v Hayter [2005] UKHL 6 (3 February 2005) at paragraph 25 =History= According to Edward Coke, conspiracy was originally a statutory remedy against false accusation and prosecution by \\"a consultation and agreement between two or more to appeal or indict an innocent man falsely and maliciously of felony, whom they cause to be indicted and appealed; and afterward the party is lawfully acquitted\\".Conspiracy, 1 Encyclopedia of Crime and Justice 241-2 (2d ed. 2002); James Burke, Sandord Kadish,Dan M. Kahan In Poulterer's Case, 77 Eng. Rep. 813 (K.B. 1611), the court reasoned that the thrust of the crime was the confederating of two or more, and dropped the requirement that an actual indictment of an innocent take place, whereby precedent was set that conspiracy only need involve an attempted crime, and that the agreement was the act, which enabled subsequent holdings against an agreement to commit any crime, not just that originally proscribed. Conspiracy to trespass In Kamara v Director of Public Prosecutions,Kamara v Director of Public Prosecutions [1974] AC 104, [1973] 3 WLR 198, [1973] 2 All ER 1242, 117 Sol Jo 581, 57 Cr App R 880, HL nine students, who were nationals of Sierra Leone, appealed their convictions for conspiracy to trespass, and unlawful assembly. These persons, together with others who did not appeal, conspired to occupy the London premises of the High Commissioner for Sierra Leone in order to publicize grievances against the government of that country. Upon their arrival at the Commission, they threatened the caretaker with an imitation firearm and locked him in a reception room with ten other members of the staff. The students then held a press conference on the telephone, but the caretaker was able to contact the police, who arrived, released the prisoners, and arrested the accused. In this case the Court felt that the public interest was clearly involved because of the statutory duty of the British Government to protect diplomatic premises. Lauton J. delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal dismissing the appeal from conviction.lawjournal.mcgill.ca: \\"Conspiracy and Sedition as Canadian Political Crimes\\", v23 1977 Conspiracy to corrupt public morals and conspiracy to outrage public decency These offences were at one time tied up with prostitution and homosexual behaviour. After the Second World War, due to the fame of several convicts, the Wolfenden report was commissioned by government, and was published in 1957. Thereupon came the publication of several books, both pro and contra the report. Of these books we can isolate two representatives: Lord Devlin wrote in favour of societal norms, or morals, while H. L. A. Hart wrote that the state could ill-regulate private conduct. In May 1965, Devlin is reported to have conceded defeat. The Street Offences Act 1959 prohibited England's prostitutes from soliciting in the streets. One Shaw published a booklet containing prostitutes' names and addresses; each woman listed had paid Shaw for her advertisement. A 1962 majority in the House of Lords not only found the appellant guilty of a statutory offence (living on the earnings of prostitution), but also of the \\"common law misdemeanour of conspiracy to corrupt public morals\\".Shaw v. D.P.P. [1962] A.C. 220 (H.L.). In the case of Knuller (Publishing, Printing and Promotions) Ltd v. D.P.P. which was decided 1973 in the House of Lords,[1972] 2 All E.R. 898 (H.L.) and [1973] 435 A.C. the appellants were directors of a company which published a fortnightly magazine. On an inside page under a column headed \\"Males\\" advertisements were inserted inviting readers to meet the advertisers for the purpose of homosexual practices. The appellants were convicted on counts of # conspiracy to corrupt public morals, and # conspiracy to outrage public decency. The appeal on count 1 was dismissed, while the appeal on count 2 was allowed because in the present case there had been a misdirection in relation to the meaning of \\"decency\\" and the offence of \\"outrage\\". The list of cases consulted in the ratio decidendi is lengthy, and the case of Shaw v. D.P.P. is a topic of furious discussion. Conspiracy to effect a public mischief In Withers v Director of Public Prosecutions,Withers v DPP [1974] 3 WLR 751, HL which reached the House of Lords in 1974, it was unanimously held that conspiracy to effect a public mischief was not a separate and distinct class of criminal conspiracy. This overruled earlier decisions to the contrary effect. The Law Commission published a consultation paper on this subject in 1975.The Law Commission. Codification of the Criminal Law: Conspiracies to effect a public mischief and to commit a civil wrong. Working Paper No 63. 1975. para. 4 to 30 Conspiracy to murder The offence of conspiracy to murder was created in statutory law by section 4 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. Northern Ireland =Common law offence= See conspiracy to defraud#Northern Ireland. =Statutory offence= See Part IV of the Criminal Attempts and Conspiracy (Northern Ireland) Order 1983 (S.I. 1983/1120 (N.I. 13)). United States Conspiracy has been defined in the United States as an agreement of two or more people to commit a crime, or to accomplish a legal end through illegal actions.Conspiracy Law & Legal Definition, USLegal, Inc.\\"Conspiracy\\" Defined & Explained, The 'Lectric Law Library A conspiracy does not need to have been planned in secret to meet the definition of the crime. Conspiracy law usually does not require proof of specific intent by the defendants to injure any specific person to establish an illegal agreement. Instead, usually the law requires only that the conspirators have agreed to engage in a certain illegal act. Under most U.S. laws, for a person to be convicted of conspiracy, not only must he or she agree to commit a crime, but at least one of the conspirators must commit an overt act (the actus reus) in furtherance of the crime. However, in United States v. Shabani the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that this \\"overt act\\" element is not required under the federal drug conspiracy statute, 21 U.S.C. section 846. The conspirators can be guilty even if they do not know the identity of the other members of the conspiracy.See United States v. Monroe, 73 F.3d 129 (7th Cir. 1995), aff'd., 124 F.3d 206 (7th Cir. 1997). California criminal law is somewhat representative of other jurisdictions. A punishable conspiracy exists when at least two people form an agreement to commit a crime, and at least one of them does some act in furtherance to committing the crime. Each person is punishable in the same manner and to the same extent as is provided for the punishment of the crime itself. One example of this is The Han Twins Murder Conspiracy case, where one twin sister attempted to hire two youths to have her twin sister killed. One important feature of a conspiracy charge is that it relieves prosecutors of the need to prove the particular roles of conspirators. If two persons plot to kill another (and this can be proven), and the victim is indeed killed as a result of the actions of either conspirator, it is not necessary to prove with specificity which of the conspirators actually pulled the trigger. (Otherwise, both conspirators could conceivably handle the gun, leaving two sets of fingerprints and then demand acquittals for both, based on the fact that the prosecutor would be unable to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, which of the two conspirators was the triggerman). A conspiracy conviction requires proof that (a) the conspirators did indeed conspire to commit the crime, and (b) the crime was committed by an individual involved in the conspiracy. Proof of which individual it was is usually not necessary. It is also an option for prosecutors, when bringing conspiracy charges, to decline to indict all members of the conspiracy (though the existence of all members may be mentioned in an indictment). Such unindicted co-conspirators are commonly found when the identities or whereabouts of members of a conspiracy are unknown, or when the prosecution is concerned only with a particular individual among the conspirators. This is common when the target of the indictment is an elected official or an organized crime leader, and the co-conspirators are persons of little or no public importance. More famously, President Richard Nixon was named as an unindicted co-conspirator by the Watergate special prosecutor, in an event leading up to his eventual resignation. =Conspiracy against the United States= Conspiracy against the United States, or conspiracy to defraud the United States,¬ß 923, 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 371‚ÄîConspiracy to Defraud the United States, U.S. Department of Justice's United States Attorneys' Manual. is a federal offense in the United States of America under . The crime is that of two or more persons who conspire to commit an offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States. =Conspiracy against rights= The United States has a federal statute dealing with conspiracies to deprive a citizen of rights secured by the U.S. Constitution.Title 18, U.S.C., Section 241 ‚Äì Conspiracy Against Rights =Unindicted co-conspirators= The United States Attorneys' Manual generally recommends against naming unindicted co- conspirators, although their use is not generally prohibited by law or policy. Some commentators have raised due-process concerns over the use of unindicted co-conspirators. Although there have been few cases on the subject, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals addressed these concerns in 1975 United States v. Briggs. President Richard Nixon The term unindicted co-conspirator was familiarized in 1974 when then U.S. President Richard Nixon was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in indictments stemming from the Watergate Investigation. Nixon was not indicted, because of concerns about whether the United States Constitution allowed the indictment of a sitting President (see Executive privilege). Japan The United Nations special rapporteur Joseph Cannataci wrote a letter to the Japanese Prime-Minister, Shinz≈ç Abe, expressing concerns about Anti-Conspiracy Bill. Hajime Yoshikawa is opposed to the Anti-Conspiracy Bill. Tadashi Shimizu is against the passed Anti- Conspiracy Bill. An opposition party recently accused the prime minister of influencing a government decision to fund and approve a veterinary school at a university owned by Mr Abe's friend. Edward Snowden said \\"This is the beginning of a new wave of mass surveillance in Japan, not well explained focuses on terrorism and everything else that's not related to terrorism ‚Äì things like taking plants from the forestry reserve, And the only real understandable answer (to the government's desire to pass the bill)...is that this is a bill that authorizes the use of surveillance in new ways because now everyone can be a criminal. \\" And Snowden said it should include strong guarantees of human rights and privacy and ensure that those guarantees are \\"not enforced through the words of politicians but through the actions of courts.\\" \\"This means in advance of surveillance, in all cases the government should seek an individualized warrant, and individualized authorization that this surveillance is lawful and appropriate in relationship to the threat that's presented by the police,\\" he said. International law Conspiracy law was used at the Nuremberg Trials for members of the Nazi leadership charged with participating in a \\"conspiracy or common plan\\" to commit international crimes. This was controversial because conspiracy was not a part of the European civil law tradition. Nonetheless, the crime of conspiracy continued in international criminal justice, and was incorporated into the international criminal laws against genocide. Of the Big Five, only the French Republic exclusively subscribed to the civil law; the USSR subscribed to the socialist law, the U.S. and the U.K. followed the common law; and the Republic of China did not have a cause of action at this particular proceeding. (In addition, both the civil and the customary law were upheld.) The jurisdiction of the International Military Tribunal was unique and extraordinary at its time, being a court convened under the law of nations and the laws and customs of war.

Family and early life Reynolds was born in Killellan, County Leitrim in 1920. His father Patrick Reynolds was elected as a Cumann na nGaedheal Teachta D√°la (TD) for Leitrim‚ÄìSligo at the September 1927 general election, but was fatally shot during the 1932 general election campaign. The election in Leitrim‚ÄìSligo was postponed, and his mother Mary won the seat, serving the D√°il for 29 years. He was educated locally, receiving only a primary school education before his father's death forced him to leave school and join the family business. He built the business successfully, transforming the hardware shop which he had inherited from into one of the largest builders' suppliers and hardware merchants in the north west. With his wife Tess, he had two sons, Gerry and Peter, and two daughters, Ita and Regina. Gerry continued the family's political tradition, serving like his father as a Fine Gael TD and senator. Political career Reynolds was first elected to Leitrim County Council in 1943, and served as a councillor for more than 40 years, taking a particular interest in rural electrification and group water schemes. He was the longest- serving chairman of the council, holding the office for 12 years from 1967 to 1979. He was first elected to the 17th D√°il at the 1961 general election, as a TD for the Roscommon constituency. He was re-elected at the 1965 general election, but at the 1969 general election he was defeated in the new Roscommon‚ÄìLeitrim constituency. He was then elected to the 12th Seanad by the Administrative Panel. The 1960s proved to be a fallow period for Fine Gael as the party was out of power for the entire decade, but at the 1973 general election a Fine Gael‚ÄìLabour Party coalition government came to power and Reynolds was elected to the 20th D√°il for Roscommon‚ÄìLeitrim. In 1976, he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education and the Public Service. In spite of this appointment, Reynolds lost his D√°il seat at the 1977 general election. Following this defeat, he secured election to the 14th Seanad on the Industrial and Commercial Panel, which re-elected him to the 15th Seanad in 1981, the 16th Seanad in 1982 and 17th Seanad in 1983. He was elected on 23 February 1983 as Cathaoirleach of the 17th Seanad, succeeding Tras Honan. He held the office until he stepped down from the Seanad at the 1987 election. Reynolds died on 27 December 2003, aged 83, and was buried in his home town of Ballinamore, County Leitrim. Tributes in the Seanad after his death described him as a traditionalist or conservative, but praised his warmth, fairness and integrity, and the Irish Independent described his hospitality as \\"legendary\\".

Event B is simultaneous with A in the green reference frame, but it occurred before in the blue frame, and will occur later in the red frame. Events A, B, and C occur in different order depending on the motion of the observer. The white line represents a plane of simultaneity being moved from the past to the future. In physics, the relativity of simultaneity is the concept that distant simultaneity ‚Äì whether two spatially separated events occur at the same time ‚Äì is not absolute, but depends on the observer's reference frame. Description According to Einstein's special theory of relativity, it is impossible to say in an absolute sense that two distinct events occur at the same time if those events are separated in space. If one reference frame assigns precisely the same time to two events that are at different points in space, a reference frame that is moving relative to the first will generally assign different times to the two events (the only exception being when motion is exactly perpendicular to the line connecting the locations of both events). For example, a car crash in London and another in New York appearing to happen at the same time to an observer on Earth, will appear to have occurred at slightly different times to an observer on an airplane flying between London and New York. Furthermore, if the two events cannot be causally connected (i.e. the time between event A and event B is less than the distance between them divided by the speed of light), depending on the state of motion, the crash in London may appear to occur first in a given frame, and the New York crash may appear to occur first in another. However, if the events are causally connected, precedence order is preserved in all frames of reference. History In 1892 and 1895, Hendrik Lorentz used a mathematical method called \\"local time\\" t' = t ‚Äì v x/c2 for explaining the negative aether drift experiments. However, Lorentz gave no physical explanation of this effect. This was done by Henri Poincar√© who already emphasized in 1898 the conventional nature of simultaneity and who argued that it is convenient to postulate the constancy of the speed of light in all directions. However, this paper does not contain any discussion of Lorentz's theory or the possible difference in defining simultaneity for observers in different states of motion. This was done in 1900, when Poincar√© derived local time by assuming that the speed of light is invariant within the aether. Due to the \\"principle of relative motion\\", moving observers within the aether also assume that they are at rest and that the speed of light is constant in all directions (only to first order in v/c). Therefore, if they synchronize their clocks by using light signals, they will only consider the transit time for the signals, but not their motion in respect to the aether. So the moving clocks are not synchronous and do not indicate the \\"true\\" time. Poincar√© calculated that this synchronization error corresponds to Lorentz's local time.. See also the English translation. In 1904, Poincar√© emphasized the connection between the principle of relativity, \\"local time\\", and light speed invariance; however, the reasoning in that paper was presented in a qualitative and conjectural manner. Albert Einstein used a similar method in 1905 to derive the time transformation for all orders in v/c, i.e., the complete Lorentz transformation. Poincar√© obtained the full transformation earlier in 1905 but in the papers of that year he did not mention his synchronization procedure. This derivation was completely based on light speed invariance and the relativity principle, so Einstein noted that for the electrodynamics of moving bodies the aether is superfluous. Thus, the separation into \\"true\\" and \\"local\\" times of Lorentz and Poincar√© vanishes ‚Äì all times are equally valid and therefore the relativity of length and time is a natural consequence.. See also: English translation. In 1908, Hermann Minkowski introduced the concept of a world line of a particle *Various English translations on Wikisource: Space and Time in his model of the cosmos called Minkowski space. In Minkowski's view, the na√Øve notion of velocity is replaced with rapidity, and the ordinary sense of simultaneity becomes dependent on hyperbolic orthogonality of spatial directions to the worldline associated to the rapidity. Then every inertial frame of reference has a rapidity and a simultaneous hyperplane. Thought experiments =Einstein's train= Einstein imagined a stationary observer who witnessed two lightning bolts simultaneously striking both ends of a moving train. He concluded that an observer standing on the train would measure the bolts to strike at different times. Einstein's version of the experiment presumed that one observer was sitting midway inside a speeding traincar and another was standing on a platform as the train moved past. As measured by the standing observer, the train is struck by two bolts of lightning simultaneously, but at different positions along the axis of train movement (back and front of the train car). In the inertial frame of the standing observer, there are three events which are spatially dislocated, but simultaneous: standing observer facing the moving observer (i.e., the center of the train), lightning striking the front of the train car, and lightning striking the back of the car. Since the events are placed along the axis of train movement, their time coordinates become projected to different time coordinates in the moving train's inertial frame. Events which occurred at space coordinates in the direction of train movement happen earlier than events at coordinates opposite to the direction of train movement. In the moving train's inertial frame, this means that lightning will strike the front of the train car before the two observers align (face each other). =The train-and-platform= The train-and-platform experiment from the reference frame of an observer on board the train Reference frame of an observer standing on the platform (length contraction not depicted) A popular picture for understanding this idea is provided by a thought experiment similar to those suggested by Daniel Frost Comstock in 1910The thought experiment by Comstock described two platforms in relative motion. See: . and Einstein in 1917.Einstein's thought experiment used two light rays starting at both ends of the platform. See: , Chapter IX It also consists of one observer midway inside a speeding traincar and another observer standing on a platform as the train moves past. A flash of light is given off at the center of the traincar just as the two observers pass each other. For the observer on board the train, the front and back of the traincar are at fixed distances from the light source and as such, according to this observer, the light will reach the front and back of the traincar at the same time. For the observer standing on the platform, on the other hand, the rear of the traincar is moving (catching up) toward the point at which the flash was given off, and the front of the traincar is moving away from it. As the speed of light is finite and the same in all directions for all observers, the light headed for the back of the train will have less distance to cover than the light headed for the front. Thus, the flashes of light will strike the ends of the traincar at different times. The spacetime diagram in the frame of the observer on the train. The same diagram in the frame of an observer who sees the train moving to the right. Spacetime diagrams It may be helpful to visualize this situation using spacetime diagrams. For a given observer, the t-axis is defined to be a point traced out in time by the origin of the spatial coordinate x, and is drawn vertically. The x-axis is defined as the set of all points in space at the time t = 0, and is drawn horizontally. The statement that the speed of light is the same for all observers is represented by drawing a light ray as a 45¬∞ line, regardless of the speed of the source relative to the speed of the observer. In the first diagram, the two ends of the train are drawn as grey lines. Because the ends of the train are stationary with respect to the observer on the train, these lines are just vertical lines, showing their motion through time but not space. The flash of light is shown as the 45¬∞ red lines. The points at which the two light flashes hit the ends of the train are at the same level in the diagram. This means that the events are simultaneous. In the second diagram, the two ends of the train moving to the right, are shown by parallel lines. The flash of light is given off at a point exactly halfway between the two ends of the train, and again form two 45¬∞ lines, expressing the constancy of the speed of light. In this picture, however, the points at which the light flashes hit the ends of the train are not at the same level; they are not simultaneous. Lorentz transformation The relativity of simultaneity can be demonstrated using the Lorentz transformation, which relates the coordinates used by one observer to coordinates used by another in uniform relative motion with respect to the first. Assume that the first observer uses coordinates labeled t, x, y, and z, while the second observer uses coordinates labeled t', x', y', and z'. Now suppose that the first observer sees the second moving in the x-direction at a velocity v. And suppose that the observers' coordinate axes are parallel and that they have the same origin. Then the Lorentz transformation expresses how the coordinates are related: : t' = \\\\frac{t - {v\\\\,x/c^2}}{\\\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}\\\\ , : x' = \\\\frac{x - v\\\\,t }{\\\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}\\\\ , : y' = y\\\\ , : z' = z\\\\ , where c is the speed of light. If two events happen at the same time in the frame of the first observer, they will have identical values of the t-coordinate. However, if they have different values of the x-coordinate (different positions in the x-direction), they will have different values of the t' coordinate, so they will happen at different times in that frame. The term that accounts for the failure of absolute simultaneity is the v x/c2. A spacetime diagram showing the set of points regarded as simultaneous by a stationary observer (horizontal dotted line) and the set of points regarded as simultaneous by an observer moving at v = 0.25c (dashed line) The equation t' = constant defines a \\"line of simultaneity\\" in the (x', t' ) coordinate system for the second (moving) observer, just as the equation t = constant defines the \\"line of simultaneity\\" for the first (stationary) observer in the (x, t) coordinate system. From the above equations for the Lorentz transform it can be seen that t' is constant if and only if t ‚Äì v x/c2 = constant. Thus the set of points that make t constant are different from the set of points that makes t' constant. That is, the set of events which are regarded as simultaneous depends on the frame of reference used to make the comparison. Graphically, this can be represented on a space-time diagram by the fact that a plot of the set of points regarded as simultaneous generates a line which depends on the observer. In the space-time diagram, the dashed line represents a set of points considered to be simultaneous with the origin by an observer moving with a velocity v of one-quarter of the speed of light. The dotted horizontal line represents the set of points regarded as simultaneous with the origin by a stationary observer. This diagram is drawn using the (x, t) coordinates of the stationary observer, and is scaled so that the speed of light is one, i.e., so that a ray of light would be represented by a line with a 45¬∞ angle from the x axis. From our previous analysis, given that v = 0.25 and c = 1, the equation of the dashed line of simultaneity is t ‚Äì 0.25x = 0 and with v = 0, the equation of the dotted line of simultaneity is t = 0. In general the second observer traces out a worldline in the spacetime of the first observer described by t = x/v, and the set of simultaneous events for the second observer (at the origin) is described by the line t = vx. Note the multiplicative inverse relation of the slopes of the worldline and simultaneous events, in accord with the principle of hyperbolic orthogonality.  Accelerated observers  Roundtrip radar-time isocontours. The Lorentz- transform calculation above uses a definition of extended-simultaneity (i.e. of when and where events occur at which you were not present) that might be referred to as the co-moving or \\"tangent free-float-frame\\" definition. This definition is naturally extrapolated to events in gravitationally-curved spacetimes, and to accelerated observers, through use of a radar-time/distance definition that (unlike the tangent free-float-frame definition for accelerated frames) assigns a unique time and position to any event. The radar-time definition of extended-simultaneity further facilitates visualization of the way that acceleration curves spacetime for travelers in the absence of any gravitating objects. This is illustrated in the figure at right, which shows radar time/position isocontours for events in flat spacetime as experienced by a traveler (red trajectory) taking a constant proper-acceleration roundtrip. One caveat of this approach is that the time and place of remote events are not fully defined until light from such an event is able to reach our traveler.

A conspiracy may also refer to a group of people who make an agreement to form a partnership in which each member becomes the agent or partner of every other member and engage in planning or agreeing to commit some act. It is not necessary that the conspirators be involved in all stages of planning or be aware of all details. Any voluntary agreement and some overt act by one conspirator in furtherance of the plan are the main elements necessary to prove a conspiracy. A conspiracy may exist whether legal means are used to accomplish illegal results, or illegal means used to accomplish something legal.Conspiracy Law & Legal Definition \\"Even when no crime is involved, a civil action for conspiracy may be brought by the persons who were damaged.\\" In the law of tort, the legal elements necessary to establish a civil conspiracy are substantially the same as for establishing a criminal conspiracy, i.e. there is an agreement between two or more natural persons to break the law at some time in the future or to achieve a lawful aim by unlawful means. The criminal law often requires one of the conspirators to take an overt step to accomplish the illegal act to demonstrate the reality of their intention to break the law, whereas in a civil conspiracy, an overt act towards accomplishing the wrongful goal may not be required. Etymologically, the term comes from Latin con- \\"with, together\\", and spirare \\"to breathe\\".  Civil conspiracy in United States business litigation  Business litigation often involves the use of conspiracy lawsuits against two or more corporations. Often joined in the lawsuit as defendants are the officers of the companies and outside accountants, attorneys, and similar fiduciaries. In many states, officers and directors of a corporation cannot engage in a conspiracy with the corporation unless acting for their private benefit independent of any benefit to the corporation. Civil conspiracy law often takes the form of antitrust lawsuits, usually litigated in federal court, where the plaintiff seeks treble damages for overpayments caused by price-fixing above the market rate. The federal Sherman Antitrust Act provides both civil and criminal penalties. Other agreements among businesses and their agents for group boycotts, to monopolize, and to set predatory prices with intent to drive a small competitor out of business, would be actionable. Conspiracies in violation of the federal securities laws such as the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 form another area where intense civil and criminal lawsuits occur over the existence or non-existence of an alleged conspiracy. Both the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice bring legal actions for conspiracies to violate the securities laws. For example, a regional bank called PNC Financial Services Group Inc. through a subsidiary agreed, in June 2003, to pay $115 million in civil fines and restitution to settle the SEC's allegations of securities fraud. The subsidiary was accused of conspiracy to violate securities laws by transferring $762 million in troubled loans and investments to off-balance- sheet entities in 2001. In that case, the Justice Department deferred prosecution of PNC, citing its cooperation in a related investigation. Similarly, the civil litigation against the tobacco companies to recover health care costs, alleges a conspiracy under the Medical Care Recovery Act, , et seq. (Count One), the Medicare Secondary Payer provisions of Subchapter 18 of the Social Security Act, (b)(2)(B)(ii) & (iii) (Count Two), and the civil provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (\\"RICO\\"), to deceive the American public about the health effects of smoking. Often the modern civil law of conspiracy is described in \\"plain language\\" jury instructions. The standard California jury instruction for conspiracy is governed by Rule 2.1050 of the California Rules of Court, The new California jury instructions are designated as the ‚Äúofficial instructions for use in the state of California.‚Äù It is not mandatory for the California judges to use them; but it is strongly encouraged. Some of the \\"plain language\\" California civil instructions about conspiracy read as follows with fictional names placed in the blanks in the jury instruction form: = California \\"Plain Language\\" jury instructions on conspiracy: essential factual elements = > A conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a > wrongful act. > Such an agreement may be made orally or in writing or implied by the conduct > of the parties. > Plaintiff Smith, Inc., claims that it was harmed by Defendant Jones Corp. > for refusing to sell widgets to Plaintiff Smith, Inc. with intent to > unreasonably injure competition and that Defendant Brown & Associates is > also liable for the harm because it was part of the conspiracy with Jones > Corp. to unreasonably injure competition under the California antitrust > laws. The facts of each case can vary widely as to exact nature of the underlying scheme. In the above example, a common fact pattern could be that widgets are necessary equipment needed for Smith, Inc. to manufacture its product, and Brown & Associates is a competitor of Smith, Inc. How the conspirators entice one another into the scheme also varies with each case. One fact pattern for the above example would be Brown & Associates promises Jones, Corp. (the supplier of widgets) to give Jones part of the additional profits that Brown hopes to make if Smith, Inc goes out of business because it lacks the necessary widgets.  English law  The tort of conspiracy requires there to be knowledge of the relevant circumstances and of the agreement made. Thus, as a precondition to corporate liability, it must be possible to attribute the relevant employee's or agent's knowledge to the corporation. There are two possible legal approaches: *as a matter of agency law, the acts and omissions constituting the alleged conspiracy must have been carried out within the actual or ostensible authority of the agent; or *as a matter of vicarious liability the acts and omissions must have been carried out in and during the course of the employment. There is little difficulty when the claim is that the company either conspired with a second company or with at least two natural persons. The requisite knowledge can be attributed under either head as appropriate. But there is a problem under the first heading when fraud is involved because there is a clash of authority. Lloyd v Grace, Smith & Co [1912] AC 716 held that a Principal may be liable where the Agent commits a fraud within actual or apparent authority, whereas in In re Hampshire Land Company [1896] 2 Ch 743, it was held that the knowledge and, sometimes, the conduct of an Agent acting fraudulently so as to cause loss to the Principal will not be imputed to the Principal. In theory, vicarious liability may be of more assistance in that it is attributing the wrong done by one (natural) person to another (fictitious) but, in Belmont Finance Corporation v Williams Furniture Ltd [1979] Ch 250, the Hampshire Land agency line of authority was preferred. Belmont, a company in liquidation, sued a number of defendants, including the majority of its own directors, for conspiracy to procure Belmont to buy shares in another company at a gross overvalue. The purpose of this plan was to fund the acquisition of shares in Belmont itself by some of the defendants. Foster J. struck out the claim on the basis that Belmont was itself a party to the conspiracy. On appeal, Buckley LJ. said: :But in my view knowledge should not be imputed to the company, for the essence of the arrangements was to deprive the company improperly of a large part of its assets. As I have said, the company was a victim of the conspiracy. I think it would be irrational to treat the directors, who were allegedly parties to the conspiracy, notionally as having transmitted this knowledge to the company. Because Belmont could only be a party to the conspiracy if knowledge was imputed, the Court of Appeal insulated it from the knowledge of its directors even though those directors, with that knowledge, made relevant decisions at board meetings and attached the company seal to the relevant documents. To that extent, liability in conspiracy is different from the standard vicarious liability situations in which, say, a company will be deemed to know that vehicles or machinery have not been properly maintained or that a service has been negligently delivered.

It is native to western Atlantic coastal waters, but has become established as an invasive species in European and western Asian regions. Three species have been named in the genus Mnemiopsis, but they are now believed to be different ecological forms of a single species M. leidyi by most zoologists. Description and ecology Mnemiopsis have a oval-shaped and transparent lobed body, with four rows of ciliated combs that run along the body vertically and glow blue-green when disturbed. They have several feeding tentacles. Unlike cnidarians, Mnemiopsis does not sting. Their body comprises 97% water. They have a maximum body length of roughly and a diameter of . It is euryoecious, tolerating a wide range of salinity (2 to 38 psu), temperature (), and water quality. Mnemiopsis is a carnivore that consumes zooplankton including crustaceans, other comb jellies, and eggs and larvae of fish. Many of its predators are vertebrates, including birds and fish.Others are members of gelatinous zooplankton such as Beroe ctenophores and various Scyphozoa (jellyfish). The comb jelly has the capacity for self- fertilization, as they are hermaphroditic. They have gonads that contain the ovary and spermatophore bunches in their gastrodermis. It carries 150 eggs along each meridional canal. Eggs and sperm are released into the water column where fertilization takes place. The spawning commences at late evening or at 1:00 or 2:00 a.m. The spawning eggs develop a thick outer layer within a minute of encountering seawater. As many as 10,000 eggs are produced from large specimens in areas with abundant prey. Egg production can start when the animals reach about 15 mm in length. Egg production increases with ctenophore size, and it is unclear when senescence occurs. It has a transient anus, which means that it appears only during defecation. There is no permanent connection between the gut and the rear of the body. Instead, as waste accumulates, part of the gut starts to balloon out until it touches the outer layer, or epidermis. The gut then fuses with the epidermis, forming an anal opening. Once excretion is complete, the process is reversed and the anus vanishes. The animals defecate at regular intervals: once an hour in the 5-centimetre-long adults, and once every 10 minutes or so in the larvae. The species moves so slowly that it is referred to as \\"sea walnut\\". As an invasive species =1980s ‚Äì Black Sea= Mnemiopsis leidyi was introduced in the Black Sea in the 1980s, where only one species of comb jelly, the small sea gooseberry Pleurobrachia pileus occurred until then. The most likely cause of its introduction is accidentally by merchant ships' ballast water. The first Black Sea record was in 1982. By 1989, the Black Sea population had reached the highest level, with some 400 specimens per m¬≥ of water (>10 animals/cubic foot) in optimal conditions. Afterwards, due to depletion of foodstocks resulting in lower carrying capacity, the population dropped somewhat. In the Black Sea, M. leidyi eats eggs and larvae of pelagic fish. It caused a dramatic drop in fish populations, notably the commercially important anchovy Engraulis encrasicholus (known locally as hamsi, hamsiya, hamsa, etc.), by competing for the same food sources and eating the young and eggs. Biological control was tried with Beroe ovata, another comb jelly, with some degree of success; it appears as if a fairly stable predator-prey dynamic has been reached. =1999 ‚Äì Caspian Sea= In 1999 the species was introduced in the Caspian Sea via the Unified Deep Water System of European Russia. The establishment of this population let to a 60% reduction in the number of sprat, which in turn led to a reduction in the population of sturgeon and seals. =2006 ‚Äì North and Baltic Seas= Since then, the species has apparently spread throughout the Mediterranean basin and the northwestern Atlantic. In 2006, it was first recorded in the North Sea, and since October 17, 2006 in the western Baltic Sea, namely the Kiel Fjord and The Belts. Up to 100 animals per cubic metre were counted in the Baltic, whereas the population density in the North Sea was at a much lower 4 animals/m¬≥ at most. M. leidyi at the Monterey Bay Aquarium One year later, the Baltic population of M. leidyi was found to have spread east to the Gotland Basin and the Bay of Puck. The impact of the species on the already heavily stressed Baltic ecosystem is unknown. The species overwinters in the deep waters where the temperature does not drop below ; the fact that the Baltic is heavily stratified, with the waters above and below the halocline mixing little, is believed to aid its survival. Apart from the widespread P. pileus, three comb jelly species occasionally drift into the Baltic from the North Sea but do not seem to be present as a stable population of significant size: Bolinopsis infundibulum, Beroe cucumis and Beroe gracilis. The second species might potentially be used for biological control. The route of dispersal of M. leidyi to the North Sea/Baltic region is unknown. It might have occurred naturally by drifting individuals, or with ballast water of ships, either from its natural range or from the Black Sea, via the Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic. At least technically possible given the species' euryhaline habits is an alternative route of dispersal through continental Europe, being carried with ballast water in ships travelling from the Black Sea to the Rhine Estuary via the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal. The latter route is known to be the point of entry into continental Europe for numerous invasive freshwater neozoons from the Ponto-Caspian region, such as the zebra mussel, the quagga mussel, the amphipods Dikerogammarus villosus and Chelicorophium curvispinum, and the polychaete Hypania invalida. Genomics Both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of Mnemiopsis leidyi have been sequenced, providing insight into the evolutionary position of Ctenophora (comb jellies). In the original 2013 paper reporting the nuclear genome sequence, phylogenetic analysis of the presence and absence of genes, introns, and amino acid alignments suggested that the comb jelly is the sister lineage to the rest of all animals. However, a 2015 study applied different methodologies and found support for Porifera as the sister group to all other animals, and confirmed findings from the original study that amino acid alignments gave mixed support for this hypothesis. The position of Ctenophora and Porifera is currently being actively debated. Its mitochondrion shows several interesting features. It is 10 kilobases in length making it the smallest animal mitochondrial DNA sequence known to date. It has lost at least 25 genes, including MT-ATP6 and all the tRNA genes. The atp6 gene has been relocated to the nuclear genome and has acquired introns and a mitochondrial targeting presequence. All tRNA genes have been genuinely lost along with nuclear-encoded mitochondrial aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. The mitochondrial rRNA molecules possess little similarity with their homologs in other organisms and have highly reduced secondary structures. The genome of Mnemiopsis leidyi appears to lack recognizable microRNAs, as well as the nuclear proteins Drosha and Pasha, which are critical to canonical microRNA biogenesis. It is the only animal thus far reported to be missing Drosha. MicroRNAs play a vital role in the regulation of gene expression in all non- ctenophore animals investigated thus far except for Trichoplax adhaerens, the only known member of the phylum Placozoa.

Initially, they were formed as local defensive organisations opposed to the Protestant Peep o' Day Boys; however, by 1790 they had become a secret oath-bound fraternal society made up of lodges. By 1796, the Defenders had allied with the United Irishmen, and participated in the 1798 rebellion. By the 19th century, the organisation had developed into the Ribbonmen. Into the 21st century, some commentators on ad- hoc nationalist political violence in Ireland will still refer to it generically as Defenderism.History Ireland letter, vol.17, 2009 Origin and activities The Defenders were formed in the mid-1780s by Catholics in response to the failure of the authorities to take action against the Protestant Peep o' Day Boys who launched nighttime raids on Catholic homes under the pretence of confiscating arms which Catholics were prohibited from possessing under the terms of the Penal Laws. Having seen the fighting between the Nappach Fleet, Bunker's Hill Defenders, and the Bawn Fleet, between 1784 and 1785 go largely unpunished, they were encouraged to form their own grouping. At Grangemore, near Ballymacnab, County Armagh, an area that had previously suffered from a Peep o' Day Boys raid, such a grouping was founded and became known as the Defenders. Supplied with arms purchased from a Protestant shopkeeper in Armagh, they embarked on night-watches and patrols keeping an eye out for Peep o' Day Boys. The Defenders started out as independent local groups, defensive in nature, however by 1790 they had merged into a widespread secret oath-bound fraternal organisation consisting of lodges, associated to a head-lodge led by a Grand Master and committee. The Defenders were greatly influenced by Freemasonry, and were made up of the lower class of Catholics. Each member had to swear an oath, which despite the penal laws which they were subject to, included the swearing of obedience to King George the Third, his successors, and the government. The oath itself was revised several times, but kept its central character whilst focusing more on loyalty and solidarity. By 1786 the Peep o' Day Boys and Defenders were opposed to each other and involved in confrontations. Escalation of conflict Conflict between the two groups spread from nighttime to daytime with fights at fairs, markets, and races etc. Throughout the rest of the 1780s fierce fighting predominated parts of County Armagh. Magistrate's who were largely anti-Catholic and Protestant juries acquitted Peep o' Day Boys who were brought to trial whilst convicting and punishing Defenders. The government eventually sent the military in to try to end the trouble. Whilst successful in quelling daytime fighting, they failed to have an effect on nighttime disturbances. More troops were dispatched into the most troublesome areas. In 1788, Lord Charlemont's re-organised Volunteer companies in County Armagh became involved in the conflict as Peep o' Day Boys joined their ranks. Despite being recreated to impartially end the trouble without the need of government troops, the new Volunteers only made things worse as they engaged in sectarian activities. Several clashes occurred between the Defenders and the Peep o' Day Boys at times backed up by the Volunteers. By 1789 the disturbances took on a different character focusing on religion itself, with both sides perpetrating atrocities, trying to outdo the other in their barbarism. Militia Act 1793 Catholic Emancipation from 1778 onward had removed some of the penal restrictions imposed upon Catholics, who were now allowed to vote and join grand juries. However, the declaration of war by revolutionary France against Great Britain in February 1793 was also followed by the passing of the Militia Act which was a form of partial conscription. Wealthier Catholics such as the young Daniel O'Connell joined the Militia as it was proof of their gradual acceptance into the establishment, but it was harder for poorer rural Catholics whose help was needed on a family farm. Although the terms of the Act stipulated that conscripts would serve in Ireland, it was widely believed that men would be sent abroad and the resultant opposition saw thousands taking the Defender oath. Members were usually sworn in catechisms, one such oath went: \\"The French Defenders will uphold the cause. The Irish Defenders will pull down British laws.\\" The Defenders did not have a centralised leadership but were organised in loosely connected local cells and were limited by their lack of firearms.p.26, A Flame now Quenched: Rebels and Frenchmen in Leitrim 1793‚Äì98, Liam Kelly (Dublin 1998) They sought to obtain them by launching raids on the big and small houses of the Ascendancy. In January 1793 the 'Annual Register' reported that forty farms had been raided for weapons near Dundalk, County Louth. However County Leitrim saw the most Defender activity with raids on Carrick-on-Shannon and Manorhamilton before eventual defeat at Drumkeerin in May 1793. Despite the ensuing wave of repression, the Leitrim Defenders again rose in open rebellion in 1795 and hundreds of soldiers had to be poured into the county to defeat them.p.31-46, A Flame now Quenched: Rebels and Frenchmen in Leitrim 1793‚Äì98, Liam Kelly (Dublin 1998) Battle of the Diamond In September 1795 the Peep o' Day Boys, backed up by some Volunteer companies, and Defenders would clash in the short Battle of the Diamond, near Loughgall in County Armagh. The result was around 30 Defenders being killed. The aftermath of the battle saw the Peep o' Day Boys retire to James Sloan's inn in Loughgall, where they would found the Orange Order. Society of United Irishmen The Society of United Irishmen had early identified the Defenders as potential allies and leading members such as James Hope had regularly travelled throughout the country organising cells and distributing propaganda such as the Northern Star newspaper. Defender cells were easily transformed into United Irish cells and those who held dual membership were often referred to as being \\"up and up\\". The precise role of the Defenders as an organisation during the rebellion is therefore hard to assess but Colonel Foote, commander of the British force and one of its few survivors of the battle of Oulart Hill referred to the victorious rebels as \\"Defenders\\" as opposed to United Irishmen in his official account of the defeat. The Defenders of County Down withdrew support before the United Irish defeat at the Battle of Ballynahinch on 12 June 1798, as their leader John Magennis had received good local information on the size and placing of the British forces. Magennis had also suggested a night attack which Munro would not allow.Proudfoot L. (ed.) Down History and Society (Dublin 1997) chapter by Nancy Curtin at p.289. The Defenders were also absent as a group from the earlier Battle of Antrim. The Defenders were usually depicted as subject to residual sectarianism, ultra-Catholic, guilty of anti-Protestantism and having only paid at best lip service to the non- sectarian ideals of the United Irishmen. While this was undoubtedly true of a proportion of Defenders, Catholic priests were not immune to their wrath as in Athlone in 1793 where a priest who preached in favour of the Militia Act was almost hanged to death.J.

He was born in W√ºrzburg to Ernest-Augustus Haus and Marie-Barbe Stang. He died in Ghent, Belgium. Haus attended school through to university in W√ºrzburg. He achieved a doctor's rank in philosophy on 3 January 1814, two days before turning eighteen. Three years later, on 26 April 1817, he was proclaimed summa cum laude doctor in civil law and in canonical law. Around 1817, King William I of the Netherlands enacted the creation of three universities in the southern provinces of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands: in Ghent, in Li√®ge and in Louvain (former Catholic University). As a consequence of the disturbances brought by the French revolution to teaching in these provinces, the personnel necessary for correct operation of these universities was missing. The government was obliged to search for staffing abroad and mainly in Germany. The thing was facilitated because lessons were to be given in Latin, so knowledge of the national languages was not required. The rector of the University of W√ºrzburg, consulted by a Dutch diplomat, designated several candidates, including Jacques-Joseph Haus. A royal decree of 26 August 1817 named him professor in criminal law and in natural rights to the Ghent University. Biography =Professor Jacques-Joseph Haus= Jacques-Joseph Haus taught criminal law and natural right until 1835. From 1835 to 1850 he taught Roman law. From 1850 onwards he taught Pandects as well as criminal law. Meanwhile, he also taught the Encyclopaedia of right, the Public law and political history of Europe. He was rector of the Ghent University in 1827‚Äì1828, 1833‚Äì1834, 1835‚Äì1838 and 1864‚Äì1867. He continued teaching until a heart disease at the end of 1880. Since 1833 he was registered with the Bar of the Court of Appeal of Ghent, but never practised as a lawyer. =The Belgian Penal law= Jacques-Joseph Haus is particularly known as theorist and renovator of Belgian penal law. He appeared as such by his work in three volumes, published in 1835 with the title: Observations sur le projet de r√©vision du Code p√©nal. This great work is at the same time a critic of the project of revision deposited on 1 August 1834 by the Belgian government and was a counterpart project explained in 516 articles. This work could not miss drawing the attention to its author. The project of the government was withdrawn and in 1848 a new commission was established with as mission presenting a new project. Jacques-Joseph Haus, who was part of this commission, was appointed as reporter. As such the commission prepared a preliminary draft and wrote all the reports and exposed reasons for discussion for the government. His work underwent only very light modifications, so that one can say that Jacques-Joseph Haus is the true author of the Belgian Penal law. This law was published only in 1867, whereas the Ghent University celebrated its fiftieth anniversary. Haus, who was rector, was the only survivor of the first team of professors. With this occasion, colleagues and alumni offered his marble bust by Paul de Vigne. King Leopold II of Belgium appointed him grand officier de l‚ÄôOrdre de L√©opold and offered to him a sapphire ring, the royal figure surrounded of brilliances. On proposal of the government he was granted unanimously great naturalization on 12 and 13 May 1870. At the time a distinction extremely rare and very flattering. In 1840, he had obtained ordinary naturalization. Alberic Rolin wrote in the Liber memorialis of the Ghent University (p. 303), Jacques-Joseph Haus was an unquestioned authority in criminal right. He was part of the commission who prepared a new criminal law and took part in setting up a new military Penal law. The Portuguese government charged him with working out a new Penal law. A national association made up in 1866 in England, for advancing social sciences, asked him to set up a project for an international law. Since 11 January 1847 he was member of the royal Academy of Belgium and had an active role in its work. He was grand officier de l‚ÄôOrdre de L√©opold, grand-officier de la Couronne de ch√™ne du Luxembourg, chevalier du Lion n√©erlandais and chevalier de l‚ÄôOrdre de St-Jacques et de l‚Äô√âp√©e du Portugal. =Principal works= His principal works include, *Elementa doctrinae juris philosophicae sive juris naturalis (1824) *Observations sur le projet de r√©vision du Code p√©nal *Expos√© des motifs du Code p√©nal belge (3 vol. 1850) *Cours de droit criminel (1861) *Du principe de l‚Äôexpiation consid√©r√© comme fondement de la loi p√©nale (1865) *De la peine de mort, son pass√©, son pr√©sent, son avenir (1867) *Principes fondamentaux du droit p√©nal belge (2 vol. 1874) Family Jacques-Joseph Haus married Angelique Roelandts (4 February 1787, Aalter - 12 November 1863, Ghent) in Ghent on 13 September 1820.

Career Eug√©nie Vallin was born at Montalieu-Vercieu, a small town about 30 miles east of Lyon. She studied at the Lyon Conservatoire and later in Paris. At first she had no intention of performing opera, preparing herself for a career on the concert platform. In 1911 she was chosen by Claude Debussy to sing the part of the celestial voice in the first performance of his Le martyre de Saint S√©bastien. She continued her association with Debussy, giving the premi√®re of his Trois po√®mes de St√©phane Mallarm√© in 1914 at the Salle Gaveau in Paris, accompanied by the composer. She also worked extensively with other contemporary composers, including Albert Roussel, Joaqu√≠n Nin-Culmell, and Reynaldo Hahn; the latter two accompanied her in recordings of their own works. She was first persuaded to sing opera in 1912, appearing in a number of roles at the Op√©ra-Comique, including Mica√´la (in Carmen), Mim√¨ (in La boh√®me), Clara in Les cadeaux de No√´l, and the title role in Louise. She went on to make her d√©but at the Teatro Col√≥n, as Marguerite (in Faust) in 1916, returning there regularly over the next 20 years. She made other d√©buts at Milan's La Scala (in 1916), Rome (1917), the Paris Op√©ra, as Tha√Øs, (1920) and San Francisco opera (1934). The range of roles which she undertook was unusually varied in their vocal requirements: Manon, Charlotte (in Werther), Juliette (in Rom√©o et Juliette), Marguerite (in Faust), Mignon, Zerlina (in Don Giovanni) and M√©lisande. She also sang the trio of heroines in The Tales of Hoffmann. Vallin had a great affection for French operetta, and performed works by Lecocq, Mass√©, and Chabrier; she even ventured into music hall during the 1930s, singing at the Alhambra in Paris. Such was her popularity in her native country that she also appeared in a 1937 film, La fille de la Madelon. Vallin worked with most of the leading French singers of her era, including the renowned tenor Georges Thill, whom she disliked. Her voice was that of a good-sized lyric soprano, well balanced but strongest in its middle and lower registers; but, at her peak, she was also capable of singing high coloratura, as recordings of arias by Bellini and Donizetti illustrate. Her tone was cool and clear, with exemplary enunciation. Louise, Charlotte and Manon became her signature roles. Her performances were described by the critic Andr√© Tubeuf as the \\"epitome of good singing but also of good taste\\". Sound technique supported both her versatility and the durability of her career; as late as 1946, when she was 60, she sang the Countess (in Le nozze di Figaro) and she continued singing and recording into the 1950s. Between 1953-59, she was a guest professor at the Conservatory in Montevideo. Death She died in 1961, aged 75, at La Sauvag√®re, her estate at Millery, near Lyon. Recordings Ninon Vallin left a considerable output of 78-rpm recordings, dating from 1913 until the early 1950s, which can be heard on CD reissues. Many of them consist of operatic arias but there are also notable discs of French m√©lodies by Faur√©, Chausson and Hahn. Among the complete or semi-complete opera recordings in which she featured were: * Louise (abridged); conducted by Eug√®ne Bigot in 1935; * Werther; conducted by Elie Cohen in 1931, with Georges Thill as the tenor lead, in what is still considered to be the finest, most idiomatic recording of this work; and * Les noces de Jeannette, conducted by Laurent Halet in 1922.

It is an anthology series: each episode has a self-contained story and its own cast. As the title suggests, each story is a thriller of some variety, from tales of the supernatural to down-to-earth whodunits. Background The series was created by Brian Clemens, who also scripted the majority of the episodes and story-lined every installment. It was produced by John Sichel (the first 3 series), John Cooper (series 4) and Ian Fordyce (the final two series) for Associated Television (ATV) at their Elstree studios north of London. The series evolved from Clemens' previous work, in particular two films in a similar style: And Soon the Darkness (1970) and Blind Terror (aka See No Evil, 1971); the latter shares plot similarities with the Thriller episodes The Eyes Have It and The Next Voice You See. Original music, including the theme-tune, was supplied by Clemens' regular collaborator Laurie Johnson. The original UK title-sequence featured still-shots of locations in the story, devoid of people, shot through a fisheye lens, bordered in bright red and set to Johnson's eerie, discordant theme-music. With an eye to the American re-broadcast market, most episodes, especially from the second season onwards, featured at least one American principal character, portrayed by an American actor. After originally being screened late at night in the U.S. under the ABC Wide World of Entertainment billing from 1973, some episodes were retitled for U.S. syndication in 1978, and all had additional opening sequences shot with new titles and credits but without the original cast and, for this reason, often only featuring menacing figures seen from the neck down. These title sequences were used in Britain when the series was repeated on regional ITV stations in the 1980s, and are also included as extras on the Complete Series box set. When the series was re-broadcast as part of The CBS Late Movie however, the original title-sequences and music were restored. The stories were often set in the London commuter belt. A particular trademark of the series' storytelling was to hook the viewer with a simple yet totally baffling situation, of the kind seen in films such as Les Diaboliques (1955). Come Out Come Out, Wherever You Are took place at a creaky country-house hotel: a female guest begins asking about her missing travelling-companion who the owner claims was not with her upon arrival the previous evening and whom none of the other guests initially recall seeing. One episode, Screamer, concerns a rape-victim who murders her attacker, only to then see the man stalking her everywhere. Perhaps the most ingenious episode is the Dial M for Murder style The Double Kill, in which a man hires a hitman to kill his wife, but makes a fatal error in his otherwise meticulous planning. Other memorable episodes include: Someone at the Top of the Stairs, one of a handful of forays into the supernatural, in which two female students move into a boarding-house and begin to notice that none of the other residents ever go out or receive any mail; and I'm The Girl He Wants to Kill, in which a witness to a murder finds herself trapped in a deserted office-block overnight with the killer, and is forced to play a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with him to survive (there is barely any dialogue throughout its second half). Brian Clemens' own favourite episode, A Coffin for the Bride (US: Kiss Kiss, Kill Kill), featured a performance from a young Helen Mirren. Following a worldwide audit during 2003-04 by the then copyright-holders Carlton, almost all the original UK PAL fisheye-titled 2\\" videotapes of Thriller were located and transferred onto modern digital tape by the British Film Institute, with subsequent restoration-work by BBC Resources. One exception was the story Nurse Will Make It Better; however, this too exists in PAL/original format on the later 1\\" videotape format as a dub from the original master-tape (this version was broadcast on the satellite-channel Bravo in 1996).

Correspondingly, the Routhian is the function which replaces both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian functions. As with the rest of analytical mechanics, Routhian mechanics is completely equivalent to Newtonian mechanics, all other formulations of classical mechanics, and introduces no new physics. It offers an alternative way to solve mechanical problems. Definitions The Routhian, like the Hamiltonian, can be obtained from a Legendre transform of the Lagrangian, and has a similar mathematical form to the Hamiltonian, but is not exactly the same. The difference between the Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, and Routhian functions are their variables. For a given set of generalized coordinates representing the degrees of freedom in the system, the Lagrangian is a function of the coordinates and velocities, while the Hamiltonian is a function of the coordinates and momenta. The Routhian differs from these functions in that some coordinates are chosen to have corresponding generalized velocities, the rest to have corresponding generalized momenta. This choice is arbitrary, and can be done to simplify the problem. It also has the consequence that the Routhian equations are exactly the Hamiltonian equations for some coordinates and corresponding momenta, and the Lagrangian equations for the rest of the coordinates and their velocities. In each case the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian functions are replaced by a single function, the Routhian. The full set thus has the advantages of both sets of equations, with the convenience of splitting one set of coordinates to the Hamilton equations, and the rest to the Lagrangian equations. In the case of Lagrangian mechanics, the generalized coordinates , ... and the corresponding velocities , and possibly timeThe coordinates are functions of time, so the Lagrangian always has implicit time-dependence via the coordinates. If the Lagrangian changes with time irrespective of the coordinates, usually due to some time-dependent potential, then the Lagrangian is said to have \\"explicit\\" time-dependence. Similarly for the Hamiltonian and Routhian functions. , enter the Lagrangian, :L(q_1,q_2,\\\\ldots,\\\\dot{q}_1,\\\\dot{q}_2,\\\\ldots,t)\\\\,, \\\\quad \\\\dot{q}_i = \\\\frac{d q_i}{dt} \\\\,, where the overdots denote time derivatives. In Hamiltonian mechanics, the generalized coordinates and the corresponding generalized momenta and possibly time, enter the Hamiltonian, :H(q_1,q_2,\\\\ldots,p_1,p_2,\\\\ldots,t) = \\\\sum_i \\\\dot{q}_ip_i - L(q_1,q_2,\\\\ldots,\\\\dot{q}_1(p_1),\\\\dot{q}_2(p_2),\\\\ldots,t) \\\\,, \\\\quad p_i = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{q}_i}\\\\,, where the second equation is the definition of the generalized momentum corresponding to the coordinate (partial derivatives are denoted using ). The velocities are expressed as functions of their corresponding momenta by inverting their defining relation. In this context, is said to be the momentum \\"canonically conjugate\\" to . The Routhian is intermediate between and ; some coordinates are chosen to have corresponding generalized momenta , the rest of the coordinates to have generalized velocities , and time may appear explicitly; where again the generalized velocity is to be expressed as a function of generalized momentum via its defining relation. The choice of which coordinates are to have corresponding momenta, out of the coordinates, is arbitrary. The above is used by Landau and Lifshitz, and Goldstein. Some authors may define the Routhian to be the negative of the above definition. Given the length of the general definition, a more compact notation is to use boldface for tuples (or vectors) of the variables, thus , , , and , so that :R(\\\\mathbf{q},\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\zeta}, \\\\mathbf{p}, \\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\zeta}}, t) = \\\\mathbf{p}\\\\cdot\\\\dot{{\\\\mathbf{q}}} - L(\\\\mathbf{q}, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\zeta}, \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{q}}, \\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\zeta}},t) \\\\,, where ¬∑ is the dot product defined on the tuples, for the specific example appearing here: :\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\cdot\\\\dot{{\\\\mathbf{q}}} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i\\\\dot{q}_i \\\\,. Equations of motion For reference, the Lagrangian equations for degrees of freedom are a set of coupled second order ordinary differential equations in the coordinates :\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{q}_j} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial q_j} \\\\,, where , and the Hamiltonian equations for degrees of freedom are a set of coupled first order ordinary differential equations in the coordinates and momenta :\\\\dot{q}_i = \\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial p_i} \\\\,,\\\\quad \\\\dot{p}_i = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial q_i} \\\\,. Below, the Routhian equations of motion are obtained in two ways, in the process other useful derivatives are found that can be used elsewhere. =Two degrees of freedom= Consider the case of a system with two degrees of freedom, and , with generalized velocities and , and the Lagrangian is time- dependent. (The generalization to any number of degrees of freedom follows exactly the same procedure as with two). The Lagrangian of the system will have the form : L(q, \\\\zeta, \\\\dot{q}, \\\\dot{\\\\zeta}, t) The differential of is : dL = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial q}dq + \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\zeta}d\\\\zeta + \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{q}}d\\\\dot{q} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\zeta}}d\\\\dot{\\\\zeta} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial t}dt \\\\,. Now change variables, from the set (, , , ) to (, , , ), simply switching the velocity to the momentum . This change of variables in the differentials is the Legendre transformation. The differential of the new function to replace will be a sum of differentials in , , , , and . Using the definition of generalized momentum and Lagrange's equation for the coordinate : :p = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{q}} \\\\,,\\\\quad \\\\dot{p} = \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{q}} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial q} we have : dL = \\\\dot{p}dq + \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\zeta}d\\\\zeta + p d\\\\dot{q} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\zeta}}d\\\\dot{\\\\zeta} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial t}dt and to replace by , recall the product rule for differentials,For two functions and , the differential of the product is . and substitute : pd\\\\dot{q} = d(\\\\dot{q} p) - \\\\dot{q}dp to obtain the differential of a new function in terms of the new set of variables: : d(L-p\\\\dot{q}) = \\\\dot{p} dq + \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\zeta}d\\\\zeta - \\\\dot{q} dp + \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\zeta}}d\\\\dot{\\\\zeta} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial t}dt \\\\,. Introducing the Routhian : R(q,\\\\zeta,p,\\\\dot{\\\\zeta},t) = p \\\\dot{q}(p) - L where again the velocity is a function of the momentum , we have : dR = -\\\\dot{p} dq - \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\zeta}d\\\\zeta + \\\\dot{q}dp - \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\zeta}}d\\\\dot{\\\\zeta} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial t}dt\\\\,, but from the above definition, the differential of the Routhian is : dR = \\\\frac{\\\\partial R }{\\\\partial q}dq + \\\\frac{\\\\partial R }{\\\\partial \\\\zeta}d\\\\zeta + \\\\frac{\\\\partial R }{\\\\partial p}dp + \\\\frac{\\\\partial R }{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\zeta}}d\\\\dot{\\\\zeta} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial t}dt \\\\,. Comparing the coefficients of the differentials , , , , and , the results are Hamilton's equations for the coordinate , : \\\\dot{q} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial p} \\\\,,\\\\quad \\\\dot{p} = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial q} \\\\,, and Lagrange's equation for the coordinate :\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\zeta}} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial \\\\zeta} which follow from : \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\zeta} = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial \\\\zeta} \\\\,,\\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\zeta}} = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\zeta}} \\\\,, and taking the total time derivative of the second equation and equating to the first. Notice the Routhian replaces the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian functions in all the equations of motion. The remaining equation states the partial time derivatives of and are negatives :\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial t}=-\\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial t}\\\\,. =Any number of degrees of freedom= For coordinates as defined above, with Routhian :R(q_1,\\\\ldots,q_n,\\\\zeta_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\zeta_s, p_1, \\\\ldots,p_n , \\\\dot{\\\\zeta}_1 , \\\\ldots,\\\\dot{\\\\zeta}_s,t) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i\\\\dot{q}_i(p_i) - L the equations of motion can be derived by a Legendre transformation of this Routhian as in the previous section, but another way is to simply take the partial derivatives of with respect to the coordinates and , momenta , and velocities , where , and . The derivatives are : \\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial q_i} = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial q_i} = - \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{q}_i} = - \\\\dot{p}_i : \\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial p_i} = \\\\dot{q}_i : \\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial \\\\zeta_j} = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\zeta_j} \\\\,, : \\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\zeta}_j} = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\zeta}_j} \\\\,, : \\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial t} = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial t} \\\\,. The first two are identically the Hamiltonian equations. Equating the total time derivative of the fourth set of equations with the third (for each value of ) gives the Lagrangian equations. The fifth is just the same relation between time partial derivatives as before. To summarize The total number of equations is , there are Hamiltonian equations plus Lagrange equations. Energy Since the Lagrangian has the same units as energy, the units of the Routhian are also energy. In SI units this is the Joule. Taking the total time derivative of the Lagrangian leads to the general result :\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\frac{d }{d t}\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\dot{q}_i\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{q}_i} + \\\\sum_{j=1}^s \\\\dot{\\\\zeta}_j\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\zeta}_j} - L\\\\right)\\\\,. If the Lagrangian is independent of time, the partial time derivative of the Lagrangian is zero, , so the quantity under the total time derivative in brackets must be a constant, it is the total energy of the system :E = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\dot{q}_i\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{q}_i} + \\\\sum_{j=1}^s \\\\dot{\\\\zeta}_j\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\zeta}_j} - L\\\\,. (If there are external fields interacting with the constituents of the system, they can vary throughout space but not time). This expression requires the partial derivatives of with respect to all the velocities and . Under the same condition of being time independent, the energy in terms of the Routhian is a little simpler, substituting the definition of and the partial derivatives of with respect to the velocities , :E = R - \\\\sum_{j=1}^s \\\\dot{\\\\zeta}_j\\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\zeta}_j} \\\\,. Notice only the partial derivatives of with respect to the velocities are needed. In the case that and the Routhian is explicitly time-independent, then , that is, the Routhian equals the energy of the system. The same expression for in when is also the Hamiltonian, so in all . If the Routhian has explicit time dependence, the total energy of the system is not constant. The general result is :\\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\dfrac{d}{dt}\\\\left(R - \\\\sum_{j=1}^s \\\\dot{\\\\zeta}_j\\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\zeta}_j} \\\\right)\\\\,, which can be derived from the total time derivative of in the same way as for . Cyclic coordinates Often the Routhian approach may offer no advantage, but one notable case where this is useful is when a system has cyclic coordinates (also called \\"ignorable coordinates\\"), by definition those coordinates which do not appear in the original Lagrangian. The Lagrangian equations are powerful results, used frequently in theory and practice, since the equations of motion in the coordinates are easy to set up. However, if cyclic coordinates occur there will still be equations to solve for all the coordinates, including the cyclic coordinates despite their absence in the Lagrangian. The Hamiltonian equations are useful theoretical results, but less useful in practice because coordinates and momenta are related together in the solutions - after solving the equations the coordinates and momenta must be eliminated from each other. Nevertheless, the Hamiltonian equations are perfectly suited to cyclic coordinates because the equations in the cyclic coordinates trivially vanish, leaving only the equations in the non cyclic coordinates. The Routhian approach has the best of both approaches, because cyclic coordinates can be split off to the Hamiltonian equations and eliminated, leaving behind the non cyclic coordinates to be solved from the Lagrangian equations. Overall fewer equations need to be solved compared to the Lagrangian approach. The Routhian formulation is useful for systems with cyclic coordinates, because by definition those coordinates do not enter , and hence . The corresponding partial derivatives of and with respect to those coordinates are zero, which equates to the corresponding generalized momenta reducing to constants. To make this concrete, if the are all cyclic coordinates, and the are all non cyclic, then :\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial q_i} = \\\\dot{p}_i = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial q_i} = 0 \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad p_i = \\\\alpha_i \\\\,, where the are constants. With these constants substituted into the Routhian, is a function of only the non cyclic coordinates and velocities (and in general time also) :R(\\\\zeta_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\zeta_s,\\\\alpha_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\alpha_n,\\\\dot{\\\\zeta}_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\dot{\\\\zeta}_s,t) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\alpha_i\\\\dot{q}_i(\\\\alpha_i) - L(\\\\zeta_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\zeta_s,\\\\dot{q}_1(\\\\alpha_1),\\\\ldots,\\\\dot{q}_n(\\\\alpha_n),\\\\dot{\\\\zeta}_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\dot{\\\\zeta}_s,t) \\\\,, The Hamiltonian equation in the cyclic coordinates automatically vanishes, :\\\\dot{q}_i=\\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial \\\\alpha_i}=f_i( \\\\zeta_1(t),\\\\ldots,\\\\zeta_s(t), \\\\dot{\\\\zeta}_1(t),\\\\ldots,\\\\dot{\\\\zeta}_s(t), \\\\alpha_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\alpha_n,t) \\\\,,\\\\quad \\\\dot{p}_i=-\\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial q_i}=0\\\\,, and the Lagrangian equations are in the non cyclic coordinates :\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\zeta}_j} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial \\\\zeta_j} \\\\,. Thus the problem has been reduced to solving the Lagrangian equations in the non cyclic coordinates, with the advantage of the Hamiltonian equations cleanly removing the cyclic coordinates. Using those solutions, the equations for \\\\dot{q}_ican be integrated to compute q_i(t). If we are interested in how the cyclic coordinates change with time, the equations for the generalized velocities corresponding to the cyclic coordinates can be integrated. Examples Routh's procedure does not guarantee the equations of motion will be simple, however it will lead to fewer equations. = Central potential in spherical coordinates = One general class of mechanical systems with cyclic coordinates are those with central potentials, because potentials of this form only have dependence on radial separations and no dependence on angles. Consider a particle of mass under the influence of a central potential in spherical polar coordinates :L(r,\\\\dot{r},\\\\theta,\\\\dot{\\\\theta},\\\\dot{\\\\phi}) = \\\\frac{m}{2}(\\\\dot{r}^2 + {r}^2\\\\dot{\\\\theta}^2 + r^2 \\\\sin^2\\\\theta\\\\dot{\\\\phi}^2) - V(r) \\\\,. Notice is cyclic, because it does not appear in the Lagrangian. The momentum conjugate to is the constant :p_\\\\phi = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\phi}} = mr^2\\\\sin^2\\\\theta\\\\dot{\\\\phi}\\\\,, in which and can vary with time, but the angular momentum is constant. The Routhian can be taken to be :\\\\begin{align} R(r,\\\\dot{r},\\\\theta,\\\\dot{\\\\theta}) & = p_\\\\phi\\\\dot{\\\\phi} - L  & = p_\\\\phi\\\\dot{\\\\phi} - \\\\frac{m}{2}\\\\dot{r}^2 - \\\\frac{m}{2}r^2\\\\dot{\\\\theta}^2 - \\\\frac{p_\\\\phi\\\\dot{\\\\phi}}{2} + V(r)  & = \\\\frac{p_\\\\phi\\\\dot{\\\\phi}}{2} - \\\\frac{m}{2}\\\\dot{r}^2 - \\\\frac{m}{2}r^2\\\\dot{\\\\theta}^2 + V(r)  & = \\\\frac{p_\\\\phi^2 }{2mr^2\\\\sin^2\\\\theta} - \\\\frac{m}{2}\\\\dot{r}^2 - \\\\frac{m}{2}r^2\\\\dot{\\\\theta}^2 + V(r) \\\\,. \\\\end{align} We can solve for and using Lagrange's equations, and do not need to solve for since it is eliminated by Hamiltonian's equations. The equation is :\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{r}} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial r} \\\\quad\\\\Rightarrow\\\\quad-m\\\\ddot{r} = -\\\\frac{p_\\\\phi^2}{mr^3\\\\sin^2\\\\theta} - mr\\\\dot{\\\\theta}^2 + \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial r} \\\\,, and the equation is :\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\theta}} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} \\\\quad\\\\Rightarrow\\\\quad -m(2r\\\\dot{r}\\\\dot{\\\\theta} + r^2\\\\ddot{\\\\theta}) = -\\\\frac{p_\\\\phi^2\\\\cos\\\\theta}{mr^2\\\\sin^3\\\\theta} \\\\,. The Routhian approach has obtained two coupled nonlinear equations. By contrast the Lagrangian approach leads to three nonlinear coupled equations, mixing in the first and second time derivatives of in all of them, despite its absence from the Lagrangian. The equation is :\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{r}} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial r} \\\\quad\\\\Rightarrow\\\\quad m\\\\ddot{r} = mr\\\\dot{\\\\theta}^2 + mr\\\\sin^2\\\\theta\\\\dot{\\\\phi}^2 - \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial r} \\\\,, the equation is :\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\theta}} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} \\\\quad\\\\Rightarrow\\\\quad 2r\\\\dot{r}\\\\dot{\\\\theta} + r^2\\\\ddot{\\\\theta} = r^2 \\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\dot{\\\\phi}^2\\\\,, the equation is :\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\phi}} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\phi} \\\\quad\\\\Rightarrow\\\\quad 2r\\\\dot{r}\\\\sin^2\\\\theta\\\\dot{\\\\phi} + 2r^2 \\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\dot{\\\\theta}\\\\dot{\\\\phi} + r^2\\\\sin^2\\\\theta \\\\ddot{\\\\phi}=0 \\\\,. =Symmetric mechanical systems= Spherical pendulum Spherical pendulum: angles and velocities. Consider the spherical pendulum, a mass (known as a \\"pendulum bob\\") attached to a rigid rod of length of negligible mass, subject to a local gravitational field . The system rotates with angular velocity which is not constant. The angle between the rod and vertical is and is not constant. The Lagrangian isThe potential energy is actually :V=mg\\\\ell(1-\\\\cos\\\\theta)\\\\,, but since the first term is constant, it can be ignored in the Lagrangian (and Routhian) which only depend on derivatives of coordinates and velocities. Subtracting this from the kinetic energy means a plus sign in the Lagrangian, not minus. :L(\\\\theta,\\\\dot{\\\\theta},\\\\dot{\\\\phi}) = \\\\frac{m\\\\ell^2}{2}(\\\\dot{\\\\theta}^2 + \\\\sin^2\\\\theta \\\\dot{\\\\phi}^2) + mg\\\\ell\\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\,, and is the cyclic coordinate for the system with constant momentum :p_\\\\phi = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\phi}} = m\\\\ell^2\\\\sin^2\\\\theta \\\\dot{\\\\phi} \\\\,. which again is physically the angular momentum of the system about the vertical. The angle and angular velocity vary with time, but the angular momentum is constant. The Routhian is :\\\\begin{align} R(\\\\theta,\\\\dot{\\\\theta}) & = p_\\\\phi \\\\dot{\\\\phi} - L  & = p_\\\\phi \\\\dot{\\\\phi} - \\\\frac{m\\\\ell^2}{2}\\\\dot{\\\\theta}^2 - \\\\frac{p_\\\\phi \\\\dot{\\\\phi}}{2} - mg\\\\ell\\\\cos\\\\theta  & = \\\\frac{p_\\\\phi \\\\dot{\\\\phi}}{2} - \\\\frac{m\\\\ell^2}{2}\\\\dot{\\\\theta}^2 - mg\\\\ell\\\\cos\\\\theta  & = \\\\frac{p_\\\\phi^2 }{2m\\\\ell^2\\\\sin^2\\\\theta} - \\\\frac{m\\\\ell^2}{2}\\\\dot{\\\\theta}^2 - mg\\\\ell\\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\end{align} The equation is found from the Lagrangian equations :\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\theta}} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad - m\\\\ell^2\\\\ddot{\\\\theta} = -\\\\frac{p_\\\\phi^2 \\\\cos\\\\theta}{m\\\\ell^2\\\\sin^3\\\\theta} + mg\\\\ell\\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\,, or simplifying by introducing the constants :a = \\\\frac{p_\\\\phi^2}{m^2\\\\ell^4}\\\\,,\\\\quad b = \\\\frac{g}{\\\\ell} \\\\,, gives :\\\\ddot{\\\\theta} = a\\\\frac{\\\\cos\\\\theta}{\\\\sin^3\\\\theta} - b \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\,. This equation resembles the simple nonlinear pendulum equation, because it can swing through the vertical axis, with an additional term to account for the rotation about the vertical axis (the constant is related to the angular momentum ). Applying the Lagrangian approach there are two nonlinear coupled equations to solve.

The principal moments of inertia are about the top's own axis, about the top's own axes, and about the top's own -axis. Since the top is symmetric about its -axis, . Here the simple relation for local gravitational potential energy is used where is the acceleration due to gravity, and the centre of mass of the top is a distance from its tip along its -axis. The angles are cyclic. The constant momenta are the angular momenta of the top about its axis and its precession about the vertical, respectively: :p_\\\\psi = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\psi}} = I_3\\\\dot{\\\\psi} + I_3\\\\dot{\\\\phi} \\\\cos\\\\theta :p_\\\\phi = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\phi}} = \\\\dot{\\\\phi}(I_1\\\\sin^2\\\\theta + I_3\\\\cos^2\\\\theta) + I_3\\\\dot{\\\\psi}\\\\cos\\\\theta From these, eliminating : :p_\\\\phi - p_\\\\psi\\\\cos\\\\theta = I_1\\\\dot{\\\\phi}\\\\sin^2\\\\theta we have : \\\\dot{\\\\phi} = \\\\frac{p_\\\\phi - p_\\\\psi\\\\cos\\\\theta}{I_1\\\\sin^2\\\\theta}\\\\,, and to eliminate , substitute this result into and solve for to find :\\\\dot{\\\\psi} = \\\\frac{p_\\\\psi}{I_3} - \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\left(\\\\frac{p_\\\\phi - p_\\\\psi\\\\cos\\\\theta}{I_1\\\\sin^2\\\\theta}\\\\right) \\\\,.

Although the equation is highly nonlinear, there is only one equation to solve for, it was obtained directly, and the cyclic coordinates are not involved. By contrast, the Lagrangian approach leads to three nonlinear coupled equations to solve, despite the absence of the coordinates and in the Lagrangian.

Top: If the radial coordinate and angular velocity vary, the trajectory is a helicoid with varying radius but uniform motion in the direction. Bottom: Constant and means a helicoid with constant radius. Consider a classical charged particle of mass and electric charge in a static (time-independent) uniform (constant throughout space) magnetic field . The Lagrangian for a charged particle in a general electromagnetic field given by the magnetic potential and electric potential is :L = \\\\frac{m}{2} \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{r}}^2 - q \\\\phi + q \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{r}} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\,, It is convenient to use cylindrical coordinates , so that :\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{r}} = \\\\mathbf{v} = (v_r, v_\\\\theta,v_z) = (\\\\dot{r},r\\\\dot{\\\\theta},\\\\dot{z}) \\\\,, :\\\\mathbf{B} = (B_r,B_\\\\theta,B_z) = (0,0,B)\\\\,. In this case the electric potential is zero, , and we can choose the axial gauge for the magnetic potential :\\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\mathbf{B}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{r} \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{A} = (A_r,A_\\\\theta,A_z) = (0,Br/2,0)\\\\,, and the Lagrangian is :L(r,\\\\dot{r},\\\\dot{\\\\theta},\\\\dot{z}) = \\\\frac{m}{2} (\\\\dot{r}^2 + r^2\\\\dot{\\\\theta}^2 + \\\\dot{z}^2) + \\\\frac{qB r^2\\\\dot{\\\\theta}}{2} \\\\,. Notice this potential has an effectively cylindrical symmetry (although it also has angular velocity dependence), since the only spatial dependence is on the radial length from an imaginary cylinder axis. There are two cyclic coordinates, and . The canonical momenta conjugate to and are the constants :p_{\\\\theta} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot {\\\\theta}} = mr^2\\\\dot {\\\\theta} + \\\\frac{qBr^2}{2} \\\\,,\\\\quad p_z = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot {z}} = m\\\\dot{z} \\\\,, so the velocities are :\\\\dot {\\\\theta} = \\\\frac{1}{mr^2}\\\\left(p_\\\\theta - \\\\frac{qBr^2}{2}\\\\right) \\\\,,\\\\quad \\\\dot{z} = \\\\frac{p_z}{m}\\\\,. The angular momentum about the z axis is not , but the quantity , which is not conserved due to the contribution from the magnetic field. The canonical momentum is the conserved quantity. It is still the case that is the linear or translational momentum along the z axis, which is also conserved. The radial component and angular velocity can vary with time, but is constant, and since is constant it follows is constant. The Routhian can take the form :\\\\begin{align} R(r,\\\\dot{r}) & = p_{\\\\theta}\\\\dot{\\\\theta}+p_z\\\\dot{z} - L  & = p_{\\\\theta}\\\\dot{\\\\theta}+p_z\\\\dot{z} - \\\\frac{m}{2}\\\\dot r^2 - \\\\frac{p_\\\\theta\\\\dot{\\\\theta}}{2} - \\\\frac{p_z\\\\dot{z}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2}qBr^2\\\\dot{\\\\theta} \\\\[6pt] & = (p_\\\\theta - qBr^2 )\\\\frac{\\\\dot{\\\\theta}}{2} - \\\\frac{m}{2}\\\\dot r^2 + \\\\frac{p_z\\\\dot{z}}{2}  [6pt] & = \\\\frac{1}{2mr^2} \\\\left(p_\\\\theta - qBr^2 \\\\right)\\\\left(p_\\\\theta - \\\\frac{qBr^2}{2} \\\\right) - \\\\frac{m}{2}\\\\dot{r}^2 + \\\\frac{p_z^2}{2m} \\\\[6pt] & = \\\\frac{1}{2mr^2} \\\\left(p_\\\\theta^2 - \\\\frac{3}{2}qBr^2 + \\\\frac{(qB)^2r^4}{2} \\\\right) - \\\\frac{m}{2}\\\\dot{r}^2 \\\\end{align} where in the last line, the term is a constant and can be ignored without loss of continuity. The Hamiltonian equations for and automatically vanish and do not need to be solved for. The Lagrangian equation in :\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{r}} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial r} is by direct calculation :-m\\\\ddot{r} = \\\\frac{1}{2m}\\\\left[\\\\frac{-2}{r^3} \\\\left(p_\\\\theta^2 - \\\\frac{3}{2}qBr^2 + \\\\frac{(qB)^2 r^4}{2} \\\\right) + \\\\frac{1}{r^2}(- 3qBr + 2(qB)^2r^3)\\\\right] \\\\,, which after collecting terms is :m\\\\ddot{r}=\\\\frac{1}{2m}\\\\left[\\\\frac{2p_{\\\\theta}^2}{r^3}-(qB)^2 r\\\\right] \\\\,, and simplifying further by introducing the constants :a = \\\\frac{p_{\\\\theta}^2}{m^2} \\\\,,\\\\quad b = - \\\\frac{(qB)^2}{2m^2} \\\\,, the differential equation is :\\\\ddot{r} = \\\\frac{a}{r^3} + br To see how changes with time, integrate the momenta expression for above : z = \\\\frac{p_z}{m}t + c_z \\\\,, where is an arbitrary constant, the initial value of to be specified in the initial conditions. The motion of the particle in this system is helicoidal, with the axial motion uniform (constant) but the radial and angular components varying in a spiral according to the equation of motion derived above. The initial conditions on , , , , will determine if the trajectory of the particle has a constant or varying . If initially is nonzero but , while and are arbitrary, then the initial velocity of the particle has no radial component, is constant, so the motion will be in a perfect helix. If r is constant, the angular velocity is also constant according to the conserved . With the Lagrangian approach, the equation for would include which has to be eliminated, and there would be equations for and to solve for. The equation is :\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{r}} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial r} \\\\quad\\\\Rightarrow\\\\quad m\\\\ddot{r} = mr\\\\dot{\\\\theta}^2 + qBr\\\\dot{\\\\theta} \\\\,, the equation is :\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\theta}} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} \\\\quad\\\\Rightarrow\\\\quad m(2r\\\\dot{r}\\\\dot {\\\\theta} + r^2\\\\ddot {\\\\theta}) + qBr\\\\dot{r} = 0 \\\\,, and the equation is :\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{z}} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial z} \\\\quad\\\\Rightarrow\\\\quad m\\\\ddot{z} = 0 \\\\,.

Albritton had a number of similarities with all- time great Jesse Owens. Both were born in Alabama, Albritton in Danville and Owens in nearby Oakville; both attended East Technical High School in Cleveland, Ohio; both attended the Ohio State University and were coached by Larry Snyder; both were members of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity; both competed in the 1936 Summer Olympics. As a sophomore at Ohio State, Albritton won the National Collegiate Athletic Association championship in 1936. In 1936, Albritton and Cornelius Johnson both cleared 6 ft 9 in (2.07 m) to set a world record at the Olympic Trials, becoming the first blacks to hold the world record in the event. Albritton was second to Johnson at the 1936 Summer Olympics, with a height of 6 ft 6 in (2.00 m). He claimed the silver medal in a jump-off after he and two other jumpers cleared the same height. Albritton and Johnson were snubbed by Hitler when they went to collect their medals. Albritton won or tied for seven National Amateur Athletic Union outdoor titles from 1936 to 1950. He was AAU outdoor champion in 1937, 1946, and 1947 and tied for three national collegiate titles, in 1938, 1945, and 1950. Albritton later became a high school teacher and coach. He served in the Ohio House of Representatives for six terms. In 1980, he was inducted into the USA Track and Field Hall of Fame.

Early and private life She was born in Dublin in 1921. She was educated locally before attending the Haslem School of Dress Designing. She subsequently worked as a dressmaker. Political career Glenn first became involved in politics when she contested the constituency of Dublin North-Central at the 1973 general election, as a Fine Gael candidate, but was unsuccessful. In 1974, she was elected to Dublin City Council for the Drumcondra local electoral area. She was again an unsuccessful candidate for Dublin Finglas constituency at the 1977 general election. Glenn was eventually elected to D√°il √âireann on her third attempt, as a Fine Gael TD for the Dublin Central constituency at the 1981 general election. She lost her seat eight months later in the first general election of 1982, but regained it in November 1982. She was the first woman elected to the Fine Gael national executive, the first woman member (in 270 years) of the Dublin Port and Docks Board and the first woman Chair of the Eastern Health Board. Glenn was known for her strong social conservative views. In 1983, she was one of eight Fine Gael TDs to defy the party and vote against the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition's proposed wording to the Pro- Life constitutional amendment on abortion. The government's wording included a negative prohibition, namely that nothing in the constitution should be interpreted as granting a right to abortion. Glenn, along with Joe Doyle and other colleagues endorsed the Fianna F√°il alternative wording that granted a \\"right to life to the unborn, with due regard to the equal right of the mother\\". On legislation to make contraception available to people over 18, she said \\"What man wants anything to do with a girl who has been used and abused by any man who comes along with condoms?\\".Irish Times, 9 November 1984 She was fiercely against the legalisation of divorce. The proposal to legalise divorce was defeated in a referendum in 1986. (The constitutional change was passed nine years later in the Fifteenth Amendment). Glenn was famously quoted as saying that women voting in favour of divorce would be like \\"turkeys voting in favour of Christmas\\".The Women's Movement and Women Politicians in the Republic of Ireland, 1980‚Äì2000, Frances Gardener and Mary O'Dowd, editors, The Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing, Vol. V, Irish Women's Writing and Traditions, p. 233. Glenn was very hostile to communism, and in 1984 she and her husband travelled to Taiwan to attend a congress of the World Anti- Communist League.\\"Alice Glenn is to address the annual congress of the right- wing World Anti-Communist League there, as the foremost anti-Communist public representative in Ireland\\". \\"Alice's Mission To Taiwan\\", Irish Independent, 23 June 1984, (p.6). Glenn also supported the Contra forces in Nicaragua. \\"Glenn was a member of the World Anti-Communist League and in the 1980s supported the CIA-backed Contras against Nicaragua's elected government.\\" Glenn failed to be renominated by a Fine Gael selection convention in Dublin Central in November 1986. She resigned from the party and fought the 1987 general election as an independent candidate but failed to be elected polling 4% of the vote and losing her deposit. She retired from politics following the loss of her Dublin City Council seat in 1991. Death She died on 16 December 2011, the day before her 90th birthday. She had suffered a long illness.

Born in Paris, his career lasted from 1924 to 1953, peaking during the 1930s. Career A pupil of the Neapolitan tenor Fernando De Lucia (1860‚Äì1925), Thill made his opera debut at the Paris Op√©ra in 1924, and he continued to appear there and at the Op√©ra-Comique for several decades, undertaking a busy schedule of performances. In addition, he sang throughout Europe and in South America, receiving the acclaim of audiences and critics at La Scala, Milan, the Rome Opera, the Verona Arena, the Vienna State Opera, the Teatro Col√≥n, Buenos Aires, and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London. He also gave 14 performances, of seven roles, across two seasons (1931‚Äì1932), at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City; but he had difficulty fitting in with the unfamiliar American cultural environment, experiencing health difficulties, and he was less well received by the Met's patrons as a consequence. His voice began to show signs of decline during the 1940s and he retired from the stage in 1953. He died in 1984 in Draguignan. Chronologically, Thill's operatic repertoire ranged from Gluck to Puccini and embraced works by Gounod, Massenet, Berlioz, Meyerbeer, Wagner, Verdi and Leoncavallo, among others. He also gave song recitals and was a frequent visitor to the recording studio. He cut many 78-rpm discs of French, Italian and German operatic arias and duets, and participated in the recording of an entire performance of Massenet's Werther by French Columbia Records. The finest of his 78s, dating from 1927 to circa 1940, display the gleaming tone of his voice at its superlative best, as well as demonstrating his spotless taste, stylish phrasing and pellucid diction. Thill also appeared in several film clips and French-language motion pictures, including Louise (1939), based on Gustave Charpentier's opera. It was directed by Abel Gance and featured Grace Moore as Thill's co-star. Privately, Thill, while a dedicated musician, enjoyed a convivial off-stage lifestyle, and he later blamed his propensity to burn the candle at both ends for shortening the span of his vocal prime.  Selected Recordings on CD  Many of Thill's 78-rpm records are available on CD reissues by EMI and the Preiser label. Naxos Records has produced a two-CD set featuring his singing of six Massenet arias plus his recording of the complete role of Werther, in Massenet's opera of the same name, which he made in January 1931. On it, he partners Ninon Vallin and Germaine F√©raldy, with the Chorus and Orchestra of the Paris Opera: Elie Cohen, conductor. (Naxos Historical 8.110061-62.)

Bridges describes his theory in thorough detail in his 1921 book Milton's Prosody. With his definition of poetic elision, Bridges is able to demonstrate that no line in Paradise Lost contains an extra unmetrical syllable mid-line; that is, any apparent extra mid-line syllable can be explained as an example of Bridges's elision. Milton's elision in Paradise Lost Bridges identifies the following kinds of elision: # vowel elisions # elision through H # poetic elision of semi-vowels # elision through R # elision through L # elision through N =Vowel elisions= Bridges identifies two basic types of vowel elision # the y-glide #the w-glide The y-glide Bridges identifies three situations where this could occur: #where the first syllable is stressed, such as in riot #where the second syllable is stressed, such as in humiliation #where neither vowel is stressed, such as in Michael The w-glide Bridges identifies three situations where this could occur: #where the first syllable is stressed, such as in ruin #where the second syllable is stressed; he finds no indisputable example of this in Paradise Lost but suggests fluctuats in IX.668 may be an example. #where neither vowel is stressed, such as in virtuous =Elision through H= Bridges identifies several places where Milton apparently glides through a consonantal H. For example: : For still they knew, and ought to have still remembered (X.12) :In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sing (XI.579) =Poetic elision of semi-vowels= Bridges identifies that words such as schism, prism, chasm, spasm are usually counted as monosyllables, despite the fact that in spoken language we vocalize the m separately; that is, as though prism were written pris'm. =Elision through R= Bridges states that if two unstressed syllables are separated by an r then there may be elision. =Elision through L= Bridges states that if two unstressed syllables are separated by an l then there may be elision. =Elision through N= Bridges states that if two unstressed syllables are separated by an n then there may be elision. Milton's later relaxation of the rules of elision Bridges notes that the Milton's concept of elision is broadened in Paradise Regained and Samson Agonistes. Specifically, he observes the following types of elision: *through an M (where preceding and succeeding syllables are unstressed) *via synaloepha of a final vocalic y with an initial consonantal y *from a short unaccented i, where the following vowel is unstressed, through the following consonants: through a T (4 instances) through a M (1 instance) through a F (1 instance) through a D (1 instance) through a SH (1 instance) through a ST (1 instance) These last two, Bridges describes as \\"quite abhorrent to the style of Paradise Lost\\" Notes # See page 47 of Milton's Prosody.

He played in forty six Tests for England, between 1954 and 1968. In those Test, Parks scored 1,962 runs with a personal best of 108 not out, and took 103 catches and made 11 stumpings. The cricket writer, Colin Bateman, commented \\"Parks was a gifted batsman and a most effective wicketkeeper\\". Bateman added \\"although he never suggested he was in the same class as Godfrey Evans before him or Alan Knott after, Parks had safe hands and was a good stopper\\". Life and career He came from a cricketing family. His father Jim Parks senior was a prolific all-rounder for Sussex, and played once for England in 1937. Parks was an attacking batsman, athletic fieldsman and a spin bowler who made his first-class debut for Sussex in 1949. By 1958, and with Sussex struggling for a reliable stopper, Parks made a successful switch to wicketkeeping. Parks describes the unusual circumstances in which he first began keeping wicket: > \\"It came about by accident. I didn't keep wicket at the start of my career. > I was a specialist batsman. A couple of years after that, Sussex were > playing against Essex in a Championship game at Chelmsford, when our > wicketkeeper, Rupert Webb got injured. There we were in the Chelmsford > dressing room before the start of play and we suddenly realised we've got no > wicketkeeper. Robin Marlar, the Sussex captain, looked at me and said > \\"You're doing it\\". I didn't have any kit and so had to borrow Essex keeper > Brian Taylor's gloves.\\" Prior to that, in 1954, Parks had been picked, purely as a batsman, for one Test against Pakistan at the age of 22. He made little impact and had to wait until early in 1960 to score an unbeaten century, batting at number seven, to help England gain a draw and clinch the series whilst touring the West Indies. He then remained England's first choice wicket-keeper through to the mid 1960s. In the 1965-66 Ashes series he made 290 runs (48.33) and hit his fair share of boundaries, but a missed stumping off Peter Burge in the Second Test cost England a chance of regaining the urn. Parks captained Sussex from 1967 to 1968, before he was succeeded by Mike Griffith. He left Sussex following the 1972 season, and joined Somerset on a three-year contract. He retired from first-class cricket in 1976. In 739 first-class matches, he scored 36,673 runs at an average of 34.76, with 51 hundreds and 213 fifties. He took 1,087 catches and made 92 stumpings. He also took 51 wickets, with a personal best of 3 for 23. He later worked for Whitbread, and as a marketing manager for Sussex County Cricket Club. Parks has also managed an Old England cricket team for several years. His son, Bobby, played county cricket for both Hampshire and Kent.

Wing On in Shanghai Wing On also had a branch in Shanghai, opened in 1918 on Nanking (Nanjing) Road by the Kwok brothers with their cousin, George Kwok Bew, who had recently moved to Shanghai from Sydney. The Kwok brothers had initially worked for George's fruit and vegetable business, Wing Sang & Co., in Sydney before starting their own fruit and vegetable business. Wing On was the second of the \\"Four Great Companies\\", which were large department stores modelled on Australian precedent established by Cantonese migrants returning from Australia. The Four Great Companies brought the model of modern department stores with egalitarian service pioneered by Anthony Hordern & Sons to Shanghai and quickly became the focal points of Shanghai's commercial district. Three of the \\"Four Great Companies\\" - Wing On, Sincere and The Sun, were founded by former partners of Wing Sang & Co. The store occupied two prominent buildings. The distinctive original building stood opposite from the (then) Sincere Department Store. An extension was built next to it in the 1930s, one of the first modern \\"skyscrapers\\" of Shanghai. After the Communist revolution in China, the store was partnationalised in 1956, then fully nationalised in 1966 and renamed \\"East is Red Department Store\\", after which it was no longer connected to Wing On in Hong Kong and traded under various names. The 1930s extension building housed a separate \\"Overseas Chinese Store\\", which, for many years, was one of the few places in Shanghai where people with overseas connections could spend their foreign exchange certificates to buy goods not available to ordinary Chinese consumers. In 2005, the department store in the original 1918 building resumed the Chinese version of the Wing On name (). However, the store is owned by a separate company from Wing On, called \\"Yongan Department Store Co Ltd\\", a state-owned company. This company does not use the \\"Wing On\\" name in its English translations.http://www.yongan.sh.cn/about1.asp The exterior of the original store was restored to its appearance during the Wing On period.

The store has also changed its market orientation, focusing almost exclusively on domestic Chinese branded clothing targeted at visitors from other parts of China, with a small department in watches and other accessories.

Prehistory and ancient times  While modern Oradea is first mentioned later, recent archaeological findings, in and around the city, provide evidence of a more or less continuous habitation since the Neolithic. The Dacians and Celts also inhabited the region. After the conquest of Dacia, the Romans established a presence in the area, most notably in the Salca district of the city and modern day BƒÉile Felix.E. J. Brill. Rumanian Studies, Vol. 3. Brill Publishers, Leiden, 1976.  Middle Ages  According to the Gesta Hungarorum the territory was ruled by a legendary ruler Menumorut ‚Äì having its citadel centered at Bihar ‚Äì at the end of the 9th and beginning of the 10th centuries, until the Hungarian land-taking.Oradea on Britannica The first documented mention of Oradea's name was in 1113 under the Latin name, Varadinum (\\"v√°r\\" means fortress in Hungarian). In the 11th century when St. King Ladislaus I of Hungary founded a bishopric settlement near the city of Oradea, the present Roman Catholic Diocese of Oradea. The city flourished during the 13th century in particular. The Citadel of Oradea, the ruins of which remain today, was first mentioned in 1241 during the Mongol invasion of Europe. The 14th century was one of the most prosperous periods in the city's life. Statues of St. Stephen, Emeric and Ladislaus (before 1372) and the equestrian sculpture of St. Ladislaus (1390) were erected in Oradea. St. Ladislaus' statue was the first proto-renaissance public square equestrian in Europe. Bishop Andreas B√°thori (1329‚Äì1345) rebuilt the cathedral in Gothic style. From that epoch dates also the Hermes, now preserved at Gy√∂r, which contains the skull of King Ladislaus, and which is a masterpiece of the Hungarian goldsmith's art.  Early modern  Georg von Peuerbach worked at the Observatory of Varadinum, using it as the reference of prime meridian of the Earth in his Tabula Varadiensis, published posthumously in 1464. Oradea was used for maps and navigation as the prime meridian between 1464 and 1667. In 1474, the city was attacked by the Turks. It was not until the 16th century that Oradea began growing as an urban area. The Peace of V√°rad was concluded between Ferdinand I and John Z√°polya on February 4, 1538, in which they mutually recognized each other to be king. In the 18th century, the Viennese engineer Franz Anton Hillebrandt planned the city in the Baroque style. Beginning in 1752, many landmarks were constructed such as the Roman Catholic Cathedral and the Bishop's Palace, presently the Muzeul »öƒÉrii Cri»ôurilor (\\"The Museum of the Cri»ô-es land\\"). After the Ottoman invasion of Hungary in the 16th century, the city was administered at various times by the Principality of Transylvania, the Ottoman Empire, and the Habsburg Monarchy. In 1598, the fortress was besieged and, on August 27, 1660, Oradea fell to the Turks and became the capital of the Varat Province. This eyalet included Varat (Oradea), Salanta, Debre√ßin (formerly part of Budin and Eƒüri Eyalets), Halma»ô, Sengevi and Yapƒ±»ômaz sanjaks. The siege is described in detail by Szal√°rdy J√°nos in his contemporary chronicle. The city was seized by the Habsburg-led German- Hungarian-Croatian forces in September 1692.  Late modern  The Hungarian Revolution of 1848 played an important role in the city's history. It was the home of the largest Hungarian arms factory while Debrecen was the temporary seat of the Hungarian government. In the second half of the 19th century, literary nicknames for the town included \\"Hungarian Compostela\\", \\"Felix civitas\\", \\"Paris on the River Pece\\", \\"the City of Tomorrow\\", \\"Athens on the K√∂r√∂s\\", and \\"the City of Yesterday\\". These nicknames are not widely used today, although \\"Paris on the River Pece\\" is still utilized sometimes.  Twentieth century  As a consequence of Hungary's role in World War I, the Treaty of Trianon awarded Oradea to the Kingdom of Romania. Over 90% of the city's population was Hungarian then. Under the Second Vienna Award brokered by Germany and Italy in 1940, North Transylvania was returned to Hungary, including Oradea, but, being on the losing side again, had to relinquish claims to it under the Treaty of Paris which concluded on February 10, 1947. In 1925, the status of municipality was given to Oradea, dissolving its former civic autonomy. Under the same ordinance, its name was changed from Oradea Mare (\\"Great\\" Oradea) to simply Oradea. In the past, ethnic tensions sometimes ran high in the area, but the different ethnic groups now live together in harmony in general , thriving on each other's contributions to modern culture. There are many mixed Romanian-Hungarian families in Oradea, with children assimilating into both of their parents' cultures and learning to speak both languages .  After the Romanian revolution  After December 1989, Oradea aimed to achieve greater prosperity along with other towns in Central Europe. Both culturally and economically, Oradea's prospects are inevitably tied to the general aspiration of the Romanian society to freedom, democracy and a free market economy, with varied initiatives in all fields of endeavor. Due to its specific character, Oradea is one of the most important economic and cultural centers of Western Romania and of the country in general, and one of the great academic centers, with a unique bilingual dynamic.  Jewish community  The chevra kadisha was founded in 1735, the first synagogue in 1803, and the first communal school in 1839. Until the beginning of the 19th century, Jews were not permitted to do business in any other part of the city. Even then they were required to withdraw at nightfall to their own quarter. In 1835, permission to live at will in any part of the city was granted to them. The Jewish community of Oradea was divided into an Orthodox and Neolog congregations. While the members of the Neolog community still retained their membership in the chevra kadisha, they began to use a cemetery of their own in 1899. By the early 20th century, the Jews of Oradea had won prominence in the public life of the city; there were Jewish manufacturers, merchants, lawyers, physicians, and farmers. The chief of police (1902) was a Jew and in the municipal council, and the Jewish element was proportionately represented. The community possessed, in addition to the hospital and chevra kadisha, a Jewish women's association, a grammar school, an industrial school for boys and girls, a yeshiva, and a soup kitchen to name a few. The following are among those who have held the rabbinate of Oradea: * Naftali Hirtz Lifchovitz (Orthodox); * Joseph Rosenfeld (Orthodox); * David Joseph Wahrmann (Orthodox); * Aaron Landesberg (Orthodox); * Moricz Fuchs (Orthodox); * Alexander Rosenberg (Neolog: removed to Arad); * Alexander Kohut (Neolog: removed to New York, 1885; died, 1894); * Leopold Kecskem√©ty (Neolog). According to the Center for Jewish Art: > The Oradea Jewish community was once the most active communities, both > commercially and culturally, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In 1944, 25,000 > Oradean Jews were deported to concentration camps, thus decimating this > vital community. Three hundred Jews reside in Oradea today.

It lies within the boundaries of the historic county of Roxburghshire. It has a hotel, post office, award-winning butcher, garage, fish and chip shop, bookshop and caf√© and several convenience stores. There is also a golf course next to the River Tweed, a cricket club, football club, rugby club and tennis club. The village is mostly known for being on the route of St Cuthbert's Way, a long distance footpath linking Melrose Abbey ( northwest) to the Holy Island of Lindisfarne off the Northumberland coast in north east England. The name commemorates Saint Boisil, an Abbot of Melrose. The village has an annual gypsy fair, originally a focus for the trade of horses. This fair once attracted Gypsies from most parts of Scotland, northern England and Ireland. However, today it is little more than a two-day get-together on the village green. Fair day is on 18 July each year. It remains a popular opportunity for many locals to have their fortunes predicted. History The Romans came to this area almost two thousand years ago, leaving Dere Street and the nearby fort of Trimontium as evidence of their occupation. Following the departure of the Romans, the area came under the sway of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. In the 7th century Northumbria was ruled by the pagan leader Oswald who, upon converting to Christianity, established, with the help of St Aidan, a monastery at Lindisfarne. Under his leadership a monastery was built at Old Melrose. One of the monks from this new religious centre was Boisil,Britannia Biographies: St Boisil, Prior of Melrose and it was he who gave his name to the village and parish of Saint Boswells. It is suggested that some of the dwellings were on the flat haugh below Benrig - a good site but prone to flooding, which may explain why they eventually moved to the higher ground at Lessudden (the place of Aidan) and the present site of St Boswells. St Boswells gave its name to a settlement in southwest Saskatchewan, Canada. The settlement was founded in the early 20th century, and flourished up to the mid-1930s. With depopulation after World War Two it failed in the 1960s and is no longer in existence. Lessuden Lessuden village, as it was then known, consisted of one long street, now Main Street, and a narrow back-road which ran along Braeheads, on the high banks of the river. Several paths connected Braeheads to the main street. The form of the old village remains pretty much today as it was in times gone past. It probably was not much different in 1544 when the army of Henry VIII of England under the Earl of Hertford razed the Border Abbeys and caused destruction of dwellings in the village including Lessuden House, which was later rebuilt. Nearby this house stood the original village church called St Mary's which was established in the 12th century in the reign of David I. Through time the worshippers moved to a church erected at Benrig near St Boisil's Chapel which, with repeated repairs and reconstructions, stood until 1952 when it was finally demolished. The worshippers from Benrig moved to the church in the village which itself has a history. In 1843, after a period of theological disaffection. One third of all ministers in the Church of Scotland walked out of the Assembly, mainly on the question of patronage, and formed the Free Church. A congregation was formed in St Boswells and originally met in a barn behind the old smiddy until a new church could be built in 1844. The re-unifications of 1900 and 1929 brought separated groups together again as one congregation and they worshipped in the building which has been variously known as St Boswells Free Church, the United Free Church, St Modans and now, St Boswells Parish Church. The building, still standing, was renovated in 1959. Employment For many generations the main source of employment in the parish was agriculture. The village lands were divided into two parts‚Äîinfield and outfield. The infield was cultivated for the growing of crops and the outfield was pasture. Crops grown included wheat, barley and peas. Turnips were a successful later addition. The scrubland and clay soil of the parish meant much hard work re-claiming land, drainage work, and liming. Wheat and barley were taken by cart to Dalkeith, Peebles and Melrose for the making of bread and beer, and carts returning from Dalkeith brought lime for the soil. Improvement in farm implements led to changes in farming and large-scale industrialization put an end to much traditional farm work. An interesting note to the agricultural heritage of the community is that there was resistance from the village residents in the late l9th century to the removal of pig-sties from private homes and it is on record that there were eight farms in the village which were required to be registered as dairies. Apart from agriculture and related industries, village life comprised many other trading activities necessary to a self-sufficient community. Joiners, plumbers, builders, drapers, bakers, butchers, fishmongers, publicans, carters, undertakers and bankers all managed to make a living from premises within the village boundaries. Modern life, ease of travel and changes in the nature of economic thinking have inevitably led to the depletion of local businesses. Village life The 19th century saw many changes in St Boswells. The water-fountain in Main Street erected by Lord Polwarth of Mertoun is a remnant of the first public water system fed from Clintmains by lead pipes. Paraffin street lamps introduced in 1870 were replaced by gas-lamps in 1912. Electric street-lighting came in 1929. Two cast iron oil lamps, dated 1902, erected to commemorate the Coronation of King Edward V11 can still be seen on brackets attached to the end of the Public Hall. They were renovated and repainted in 2016 and long-lasting LED bulbs were fitted. The old school at the top of Weirgate Brae was pulled down and a new one built in 1836 at what is now Hamilton Place. One of the builders of the schoolhouse was John Smith of Darnick who also sculpted the William Wallace Statue at Bemersyde House near Dryburgh. Mertoun Bridge was built to replace the old ford across the river, and population growth led to the building of the sandstone houses at West Croft and Jenny Moore's Road. The Public Hall was officially opened in 1896 and came to be used not only as a venue for public events, but also as a depository for village paraphernalia and as a storeroom for equipment belonging to the village fire-brigade. The hall still sees good use today by many community groups. A great boon for the economy of the village was the building of the Kennels in 1836 for the Duke of Buccleuch's pack. The hunting season brought many visitors and this led to the building of the Buccleuch Arms Hotel. At this time the local smiddy showed good business sense by moving from the east end of the village to the present location at the west end, in order, we can suppose, to be nearer the Kennels which, at one time, stabled as many as fifty horses. Many of the roads in the area originated as paths for walking or riding to the Auld Kirk at Benrig, or as access roads to farms and fields. The main roads to Melrose, Jedburgh and Kelso operated a turnpike system which meant that the horse-drawn coaches, some of which ran on a daily basis, had to pay road-tax at the various tollhouses, one of which can still be seen at Mertoun Bridge. One of the biggest changes in country life was the arrival of the railway in 1849. The initial building of the rail track, then operation and maintenance of the line meant new jobs for some and loss of jobs for others. The Waverley Line ran to the west of St Boswells and the nearest station was at Newtown. One local business which did not lose out to the railway was operated by the Henderson brothers who ran a horse-drawn cab service to and from the station which was much used for both passengers and goods delivery. When times changed the brothers were envied by many when they purchased a Model T Ford, one of the first cars to be seen in the parish. The railway line was closed in 1969, but there is now public discussion about the possibility of its revival. The village green, still of considerable size, was once even bigger and old maps show it stretching as far as the tennis courts and up the west side of the A68 to behind the Kennels and across the cricket pitch. Originally common pasture land, its size and uses have changed from time to time and it has been used for sports, games, picnics, festivities and even military encampment. Perhaps the best known use of the Green is the historic St Boswells Fair which is held on the 18 July every year. The fair used to be held on the flat haugh below Benrig but in 1743 the river level rose as a result of heavy rains and the Fair was flooded. With wet feet but undampened spirits, a decision was made to move the venue to the Green, and it has been held there ever since. Originally a sheep fair and a wool market, it came to be a selling point for cattle and horses. It was not uncommon for a thousand horses to change hands over the period of the Fair. Gypsies came in their brightly decorated wagons from other parts of Scotland, England and even Ireland. It was a time for merriment and fun making, with kiosks, booths and campfires offering a change from daily routine for local residents. The tradition continues and the Fair is still held on the same date every year, but in a greatly reduced form. The civic awareness which inspired the planting of a Lime tree avenue on the Green to commemorate events such as Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1898, the Boer War, the coronation of George V & Queen Mary in 1911 and the Buccleuch Golden Wedding in 1909 has given us a pleasant place to walk and think and be at peace. Cast iron plaques commemorating historical events from the end of the 19th and early 20th Century can still be seen on some of the trees. Four plane trees were planted on little hillocks, at the crossroads of the A68 and the A699, by Mrs. Dalrymple in 1900. They commemorate four victories in the Boer War - Ladysmith, Mafeking, Kimberly and Pretoria. They all had plaques with the names on them but only the Mafeking plaque remains. The war years saw much activity in the village and the area was virtually taken over by the Army for various uses. There was a munitions factory at Charlesfield. Stores and fuel dumps were round every corner. The soldiers, many of whom were billeted in the Kennels, had support from the Home Guard, air raid wardens and voluntary ambulance drivers. Canteen facilities and first aid were provided by local organisations. Residents of the village, men and women, young and old, were united in their support of the war effort. The River Tweed It is not possible to speak of St Boswells village without thinking of the river which bends and twists on its swift flowing course north of the village. Famous for its salmon and brown trout it has given satisfaction to anglers over the years. Many of the local houses were built of stones from the river bed. The riverside walks are at all times pleasant and sometimes spectacular. Walkers on St Cuthbert's Way through the village on pilgrimage from Melrose to Lindisfarne see the same view of the Eildon Hills as was seen by such men as Modan who established a religious cell at Dryburgh; Aidan who brought twelve young monks from Lindisfarne to Old Melrose as missionaries; Cuthbert who became prior and bishop and Boisil who, after a life of holiness and healing gave his name to the village and parish of St Boswells. Sports St Boswells is one of the Borders' more active villages regarding organised sport. Perhaps unusually for Scotland, part of the Green was given over to cricket. The present Club was constituted in 1895 and the current pitch, a gift from the Duke of Buccleuch used since the 1920s. About the same time the Curling Club was also formed. Using water from the Laret Burn, a pond was constructed just beyond the Green just about where the tennis courts now stand. Perhaps the winters really were more severe in days gone past because ice did form and games went ahead. Trees were planted at strategic points to prevent the sun's rays melting the ice. The pond was closed in 1964 and the club moved to Kelso indoor rink. The cricket team has seen the most success having a brief spell in the national league in 2006 and winning the Border League four times between 2004 and 2008. The football and rugby team haven't seen similar fortune, though - both clubs finishing bottom of their respective leagues in the 2005-06 season.

Born in Saint-Gille, Brussels, Wabbes began his career as an actor and after several other jobs, eventually opened an antiques and decoration shop in Brussels. At the end of his career, he was widely considered the most accomplished designer of the second half of the 20th century. A committed modernist, he started to create his own furniture and was chosen by several Belgian administrations to design and create functional furniture. All his works are based on the expression of pure quality with excellent materials (plain wood, metal). He is especially famous for his office desks, tables, and casts. Biography Jules Wabbes was the son of Henry, Justin, Gommire Wabbes (1874-1959), and Rachel Pintens, Londerzeel (1890-1946). The family came from Mechelen and practiced the profession of boatman or timber merchant. Wabbes was not very good at school and left school at the age of sixteen. He became a freelance photographer and established his studio at Chaussee de Charleroi in Brussels in his father's drugstore. After the Second World War, Wabbes opened an antique shop with Louise Carrey on Chaussee de Charleroi in Brussels. Wabbes was very talented with the placing and layout of interesting objects, and some customers asked for advice on placing the furniture which led him to begin with interior decoration. He liked old furniture and furniture pieces that were manufactured with recycled materials which included old beds and balconies in wrought iron. With his interests, he opened a restoration workshop and studied the construction techniques of old furniture. His friends in the art community encouraged Wabbes to move to contemporary designs. He married the designer, cartoonist, illustrator, and author of children's books known as Mary Wabbes on 3 February 1960, with whom he had four children: Sylvie, Marie, Julie, and Henry. Wabbes was awarded several prizes, notably the Milan Triennal fair, and he was considered at the time one of the most talented Belgian interior architects. In April 1965, he was appointed \\"Knight of the Order of the Crown\\" in Belgium. Jules Wabbes was a professor at the Institut Saint-Luc in Brussels in 1971 as a teacher of architecture students. Works The development of offices and businesses was Jules Wabbes's specialty. He also built boats, private homes, and student housing. In cooperation with Belgium's famous architect , Wabbes designed the furniture of the Foncolin building (Fonds colonial des Invalidit√©s) and the Glaverbel buildings in Brussels. Other works included the fittings of the Science Library for the Universit√© catholique de Louvain, and the interiors of Sabena airplanes. Wabbes did renovations of the new Embassy of the United States in the Hague, designed by Marcel Breuer, and the interiors of the United States Embassies in London, Brussels, Dakar, and Rabat. His first Slats furniture line stemmed from his desire to use a durable material. He chose wood at first but had problems with tension and cracks appearing on the surface. Wabbes determined the decorative value of a piece of furniture was by the ways of putting in each timber. Jules Wabbes was chosen by the Belgian airline Sabena to study the interior of their aircraft. He worked with Sabena engineers and visited the factories of Douglas Aircraft Company, Santa Monica in California and San Diego at Convair.

Early life in Germany Eitel was born in W√ºrttemberg, Germany. Eitel studied initially at the Theological Seminary, Sch√∂nthal. In 1860, he graduated from the University of T√ºbingen with Master of Arts (and Doctor of Philosophy in 1871). He was appointed vicar of the state Evangelical-Lutheran Church at Mossingen for the next 12 months. Canton and Hong Kong Adopting the Chinese name Ê≠êÂæ∑ÁêÜ (), he came to Lilang, Xin'an district in Guangdong, China under the Basel Mission. Facing refusal of permission to marry an ex-Catholic, he transferred to the London Missionary Society at Canton in April 1865 and took charge of the Boluo Mission and the Hakka villages outside Canton. The next year, he married Mary Anne Winifred Eaton of the Female Education Society and Lady Superintendent of the Diocesan Native Female Training School. In January 1870 he moved to Hong Kong while still having charge of the Boluo Mission. In 1875, he became Director of Chinese Studies. In 1878, he was appointed Supervisor of Interpreters and Translator to the Supreme Court though he resigned this post in 1882 after censure for accepting private payment for translation work he was required to do anyway. He had resigned from the London Missionary Society in April 1879. From March 1879 to 1896, Eitel served as Inspector of Schools of the Hong Kong Government. He was particularly vigorous in promoting education for girls and pursued a policy of private education over government- run schooling. He also served as Private Secretary to Governor Sir John Pope Hennessy for about two years from 1880 to 1881, again resigning under a cloud, the Governor accusing him of having exceeded his authority. Eitel left Hong Kong in 1896 to begin a new life as Pastor of St Stephen's Lutheran Church, Pirie Street, Adelaide, South Australia, in 1897. The next year, he was appointed part-time lecturer in German at the University of Adelaide, a post he held until he died. A Cantonese Dictionary Eitel published his Cantonese dictionary, Chinese Dictionary in the Cantonese Dialect in 1877. This expanded the work of James Legge on the Kangxi Dictionary. Eitel used his own system of Cantonese Romanization which was a minor refinement of the work of Elijah Bridgman in his pioneering 'Chinese Chrestomathy in the Canton Dialect' of 1841 and Samuel Williams' glossary dictionary Tonic Dictionary of the Chinese Language in the Canton Dialect written in 1856. His publication was intended to standardize the pronunciation of Cantonese by students in Hong Kong. His work was criticised by Wong Shik-ling in his book A Chinese Syllabary Pronounced according to the Dialect of Canton on the basis that it inherited inaccuracies from former works.

The most praised aspects of the game were its graphics, artificial intelligence of enemies, and outdoor environments. An official expansion pack, Descent 3: Mercenary, was released on December 3, 1999. The expansion pack includes a new series of missions, multiplayer maps, and a level editor. After its release on Microsoft Windows, the game was subsequently ported to Mac OS and Linux platforms. Gameplay first-person perspective, shoots enemies with the Plasma Cannon. The left frame depicts the currently selected primary weapon, the middle panel shows the ship's status, and the right frame displays the currently selected secondary weapon. Like its predecessors Descent and Descent II, Descent 3 is a six degrees of freedom shooter where the player controls a flying ship from a first-person perspective in zero-gravity. It is differentiated from standard first-person shooters in that it allows the player to move and rotate in any 3D direction. Specifically, the player is free to move forward/backward, up/down, left/right, and rotate in three perpendicular axes, often termed pitch, yaw, and roll. Aboard the ship, the player can shoot enemies, turn on the ship's afterburners to temporarily increase its acceleration and speed, and fire flares or turn on the ship's headlight to explore darkened areas. In the game's single-player mode, the player must complete a series of levels where multiple enemies controlled by the game's artificial intelligence will try to hinder the player's progress. The game primarily takes place inside labyrinthine underground facilities, but the player can occasionally travel over the surface of the planets where the facilities are buried to reach other nearby areas. The underground facilities are composed of a set of tunnels and rooms separated by doors. Most of them can be opened by either firing weapons at them or bumping into them, but others require special actions to be performed first before entry is allowed. For instance, some doors require special keys that must be collected. To finish a level and proceed to the next one, the player must complete a set of objectives that range from collecting items to activating switches, defeating enemies, and destroying objects. As the player progresses throughout the game, two additional ships become available for use. Each of the game's three ships offers a different balance of speed, weapons, and maneuverability. Within the levels, the player may collect power-ups that enhance the ship's weaponry. Weapons are categorized into three different types: primary weapons, secondary weapons, and countermeasures. Primary weapons range from a variety of laser weapons to the Plasma Cannon and the Napalm Cannon, which projects a stream of burning fuel. Secondary weapons include different types of missiles, while countermeasures range from proximity mines to portable turrets. Most primary weapons consume energy in different rate, but some, such as the Napalm Cannon, use their own type of ammunition. In contrast, all secondary weapons and countermeasures require their own ammunition suppliers. The player's ship is protected by a shield which decreases when attacked by enemies. If the shield is fully depleted, the player dies and must start the game again from a previous section of the fight without any collected power-ups. Nevertheless, the player can reclaim the missing power-ups from the ruins of the destroyed ship. Shield, energy, and ammunition suppliers are dispersed among the levels to help players increase their resources. The player can also collect equipment items which grant special powers. For example, the Quad Laser modifies the laser weapons to fire four shots at once instead of the standard two, while the Cloaking Device renders the player invisible to enemies for 30 seconds. During the game, the player may also deploy the Guide-Bot, an assistant that keeps track of the next objective and shows the player the way to a specific target. =Multiplayer= In addition to the single-player campaign mode, Descent 3 features an online multiplayer mode where numerous players can compete against each other in eight different game types. Notable game types include Anarchy, where the objective is to kill as many opponents as possible, Capture the Flag, where two to four teams compete against each other to capture opposing flags, and Monsterball, in which players must shoot and guide a ball into their opponents' goal. Aspects such as time limit, number of players, map to play on, and selection of what weapons are allowed, among others, can be customized to match player preference. The game also features an observer mode which allows players to watch a multiplayer game as a spectator and a co-operative mode that allows players to work together to complete campaign missions. Multiplayer games support the DirectPlay, IPX, and TCP/IP protocols. Online gameplay was also possible over Parallax Online, an online gaming service which kept track of players' statistics and rankings. Plot Descent 3 takes place in a science fiction setting of the Solar System where the player is cast as Material Defender MD1032, a mercenary working for a corporation called the Post Terran Mining Corporation (PTMC). The game begins moments after the events of Descent II, with the Material Defender escaping the destruction of a planetoid where he was clearing PTMC's robots infected by an alien virus. He was about to return to Earth to collect his reward, but a malfunction occurred with the prototype warp drive in the ship he was piloting, making it drift towards the Sun's atmosphere. At the very last moment, the Material Defender is rescued via a tractor beam by an organization known as the Red Acropolis Research Team. While the Material Defender recovers in the Red Acropolis station on Mars, the director of the team informs him that they have been investigating PTMC, and have uncovered a conspiracy: one of her acquaintances in the PTMC was killed by a robot, and when she contacted PTMC about it, they denied having ever employed such acquaintance, even though he had worked with them for years. The Red Acropolis had tried to notify the Collective Earth Defense (CED), a large police group, of the PTMC's actions, but they took no action, not daring to interfere with such a powerful corporation. The director also tells the Material Defender that, while he was clearing the mines during the events of Descent II, PTMC executive Samuel Dravis was actually testing and modifying the virus and deliberately tried to kill him by overloading the warp drive on his ship. After some persuasion and offers from the director, including a new ship and an AI assistant known as the Guide-Bot, the Material Defender accepts to help the Red Acropolis stop the virus. The Material Defender is first sent to Deimos to obtain information about the location of a scientist named Dr. Sweitzer who has evidence of the PTMC's actions. He is then rescued in the Novak Corporate Prison on Phobos. After recovering the evidence, the Material Defender delivers it to PTMC President Suzuki in Seoul before leaving with his reward. When the Material Defender arrives at the Red Acropolis Research Station, the director tells him that the PTMC president has been killed and that the Red Acropolis Research Team are now accused of being terrorists, resulting in the destruction of the then-abandoned station. After a series of missions, the Material Defender and the Red Acropolis Research Team manage to develop an antivirus and convince the CED that they are not terrorists. The CED suggest to broadcast the antivirus through their strategic platform orbiting Earth, but the results are unsuccessful. The Material Defender is then sent to Venus, where Dravis has been tracked by the Red Acropolis. In the ensuing confrontation in his stronghold, Dravis is mortally wounded by the Guide-Bot's flares and the Material Defender deactivates the virus, which disables all of the PTMC's robots. The game ends with the CED destroying the PTMC's orbital headquarters while the Material Defender returns to Earth. Development Descent 3 is the first project developed by Outrage Entertainment. The company was founded when Parallax Software, creators of previous Descent games, decided to split in two: Outrage Entertainment and Volition. Volition would focus on creating the combat space simulator FreeSpace games, while Outrage would continue with the Descent series. Development on Descent 3 began in November 1996 with a team of eight people. According to programmer Jason Leighton, one of the major problems during the game's development cycle was a lack of direction and control. He explained that the team had \\"No code reviews, no art reviews, [and] no way of saying, 'This is bad and we should be going in a different direction'\\". This \\"anarchistic\\" development environment worked for Descent and Descent II because they were developed by small groups that worked closely together and often in the same room. However, as Outrage started to grow from eight people to almost 20 by the end of the project, the developers did not introduce enough management to control the process. As Leighton recalls, \\"we literally had to build the team and company at the same time we started production on the game\\". Originally, Descent 3 was intended to support both a software and a hardware renderer, implying that the rendering process of the game could take place either in the CPU or dedicated hardware like a video card. However, about six months after starting development, the team decided to go with a hardware-only renderer because it allowed them to create \\"visually stunning\\" graphics and maintain a solid frame rate without worrying about the limitations imposed by the software renderer. This was a difficult decision since the team had to scrap many tools and software rendering technology that were already developed. In addition, computers with hardware acceleration were not common at the time the decision was made. As the developers noted, \\"We knew just by looking at our progress on the game under acceleration that we had a beautiful looking game with all the latest technologies ‚Äî but would anyone actually be able to play it?\\" Fortunately, as development progressed, hardware acceleration became more popular with each passing year. The game natively supports the Direct3D, Glide and OpenGL rendering APIs for graphics, and the A3D and DirectSound3D technologies for sound. The new technology also allowed the developers to create both indoor and outdoor environments; one of the biggest complaints of Descent II was the fact that it was considered too \\"tunnely\\". To this end, the developers created a new technology which featured an indoor portal rendering engine \\"hooked to a flight-sim-like terrain\\" engine, collectively called the Fusion Engine. The portal engine permitted designers to create small rooms with complex geometry. These rooms would later be linked together via shared dividing polygons called portals to create a portalized world for the player to fly through. In contrast, the terrain engine, which was initially planned for another game and whose function is to create more polygonal detail as players get closer to the ground and decrease polygons when they are farther away, gave designers the ability to create expansive outdoor terrains. Transitions between both engines were achieved using an external room (with its normal vectors inverted) that could be placed anywhere on the terrain map. With this technique, developers could create hybrid levels where the player could transit from indoor to outdoor areas in real-time and without loading screens. Leighton commented that whenever one of these transitions occurs, \\"the game code [switches] collision detection, rendering, and so on, to use the terrain engine\\". The company had no standardization of level design tools. Leighton said, \\"Some people used 3D Studio Max, some used Lightwave, and one designer even wrote his own custom modeler from scratch\\". This practice led to an inconsistent quality across the game's levels. For example, one designer would create structures with great geometry but bad texturing, while another would create the opposite. Once the structures were modeled individually, they were all imported into a custom editor, called D3Edit, so that the designers could \\"glue everything together\\". The D3Edit editor received constant updates because it initially did not feature an intuitive interface for designers. It was not until the last third of the development period that the editor improved significantly. As Leighton notes, \\"Even in the shipped game you can tell which levels were made early on and which were made near the end of the production cycle. The later levels are much better looking, have better frame rates, and generally have better scripts\\". Developers also considered the idea of shipping the game with a level editor based on the one they used to create the game's levels. However, due to the constant changes the developers made to their own editor, it was hard for them to design a more user-friendly one. In addition to the changes in the game's engine, the developers decided to improve the artificial intelligence to give each enemy a distinct behavior. According to Matt Toschlog, president of Outrage Entertainment and lead programmer of Descent 3, \\"It's very rewarding for the player to meet a new enemy, get to know him, learn his quirks, and figure out the best way to kill him. It's great when a game requires both thinking and quick reactions\\". Originally, the developers planned to add weather effects that would disorient the player's ship during gameplay, but this feature was ultimately not implemented due to time and technology constraints. Multiplayer games were heavily tested to ensure their network stability and support IPX, TCP, and DirectPlay. The actual development of the game took 31 months to complete, with the developers describing it as both a joyful and painful process due to in part of the almost nonexistent management and the rapidly evolving technology at the time. Marketing and release Descent 3 was presented at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 1998, where developers showed off a demonstration of the game. In the months leading to the game's release, the game's publisher, Interplay Productions, ran a program that allowed Descent fans to submit a digital photo of themselves along with a pilot name to the company. These photos would later be included in the game so that players could use them as their multiplayer profiles. Outrage also released two game demos that allowed customers to try the game before purchasing it. The second demo included a single-player level and several multiplayer matches which could be played through a matchmaking service provided by Outrage. From March to August 1999, Interplay held a Descent 3 tournament in the United States consisting of three phases where numerous players could compete against each other in multiplayer matches. The winner was awarded a prize of US$50,000. Descent 3 was initially released for Microsoft Windows on June 17, 1999. A level editor was released shortly afterwards, allowing users to create both single and multiplayer maps for the game. A Mac OS version of the game was released in November 1999. The Mac OS version was ported by programmer Duane Johnson, who previously worked on the 3dfx versions of the original Descent and Descent II. Descent 3 was also ported to Linux platforms by Loki Entertainment Software after an agreement with the game's publisher. The port, which features a multiplayer mode optimized for 16 players, was released in July 2000. In 2014, the game was released on the Steam digital distribution service. Reception Descent 3 received positive reviews from video game critics. The most praised aspects were its graphics, artificial intelligence of enemies, and outdoor environments. Erik Wolpaw of GameSpot felt that the game \\"improves in almost every conceivable way on its predecessors and reestablishes the series as the premier example of the play style it single-handedly pioneered\\", while Next Generation praised both its originality and faithfulness to its predecessors. IGN lauded the game's new engine, noting that the transition between indoor and outdoor environments is seamless. GameRevolution remarked that the addition of outdoor environments allows \\"greater use of the maneuvering capabilities, adds variety to the levels, and ensures that the game never gets dull or boring\\". The reviewer also acknowledged that the game's six degrees of freedom movement scheme may be difficult to master for some players, stating that the game \\"can be confusing, dizzying, and even nauseating. This is a game for the pro's\\". The music and sound effects received similar praise. GameSpot pointed out that \\"explosions erupt with lots of satisfying, floor-rattling bass, lasers ping nicely, flamethrowers emit appropriate rumbling whooshes, and there's plenty of ambient beeping, hissing, and mechanical humming\\". Game Revolution praised the graphics for their \\"modeling, colored lighting, incredible special effects, wonderful animation, [and] sheer overall feel\\". Victor Lucas of Electric Playground stated similar pros, but also admitted that the game's hardware requirements were relatively high. Criticism was leveled at the game's story. GameSpot considered it not compelling, while Jason Cross, writing for Computer Games Magazine, felt that it \\"really doesn't have much to do with actual gameplay\\". PC Gamer reviewer Stephen Poole also criticized the Guide-Bot's efficiency, remarking that sometimes it can get lost or trapped while leading the player to a destination. The gameplay was praised for its variety of weapons and enemies. Game Revolution said that each enemy is \\"unique both in ability, structure, and behavior so that each requires a specific combat approach\\". Maximum PC reviewer Josh Norem praised the levels for their interesting objectives, stating that the missions \\"vary widely, ranging from finding lost colleagues to defending strategic structures against enemy assaults\\". Computer Games Magazine praised the fact that the developers replaced the wire-frame automaps of previous Descent games with flat-shaded polygons because they \\"provide more detail and make it easier to recognize where you are and how to get where you want to go\\". The multiplayer was highlighted positively due to its replay value and variety of game types. Computer Games Magazine also credited its \\"rock-solid performance on standard dialup modems and easy connectivity\\", while GameSpot praised it for being \\"fun and stable\\". The game was a runner-up for GameSpy's Action Game of the Year and a nominee for GameSpots PC Action Game of the Year. =Sales= Despite positive reviews and the commercial success of its predecessors, Descent 3 was a commercial disappointment. According to PC Data, its sales in the United States were under 40,000 units by the end of September 1999, which drew revenues of roughly $1.7 million. A writer for PC Accelerator remarked that this figure was \\"not enough to keep publishers plugging at long, expensive development cycles in the hope of scoring a Half-Life\\". By the end of 1999, Descent 3s sales had risen to 52,294 units in the United States. Daily Radars Andrew S. Bub presented Descent 3 with his \\"System Shock Award\\" (named after the 1994 game of the same name by Looking Glass Studios), arguing that it was difficult \\"to find a better game that under-performed sales-wise, this year\\". Descent 3s sales were similarly low in the German market. It debuted in 27th place on Media Control's computer game sales rankings, and fell to 33rd, 56th and 78th over the following three months, respectively. Interplay blamed its underperformance in the region on stiff competition in the genre. Conversely, PC Players Udo Hoffman reported a German retailer's view that \\"the genre is no longer popular\\", and that demand for a mission pack was at \\"0.0 percent.\\" Expansion pack An expansion pack for Descent 3 was developed by Outrage and released for Microsoft Windows on December 3, 1999. The expansion, entitled Descent 3: Mercenary, introduces new features, a seven-level campaign, a fourth ship, and several multiplayer maps. It also includes the game's level editor. The expansion received mixed reviews from critics. IGN reviewer Rich Rouse praised Mercenary for its lasting appeal, stating: \\"With hordes of new missions and battlefields on the CD, as well as the included level creation package, you won't be uninstalling for a long time\\". In contrast, GameSpot editor Erik Wolpaw criticized the expansion for its bland level design and lack of new features. A compilation that includes both Descent 3 and its expansion pack was released on June 14, 2001.

The stone circle, a standing stone, and a cairn comprise a Scheduled Ancient Monument; the circle is in the guardianship of English Heritage. Description Corndon Hill above the Mitchells Fold stone circle As with most sites of this type, its true history is unknown. The name of the circle may derive from 'micel' or 'mycel', Old English for 'big', referring to the size of this large circle. Its doleritic stones came from nearby Stapeley Hill. Many of them are now missing and others are fallen. One example, reported in pagan magazine White Dragon, is that ‚ÄúThis circle was the site of vandalism by a local farmer in the summer of 1995 when several stones were uprooted by a mechanical digger. The stones were promptly righted and \\"planted\\" again and the culprit punished. Ongoing unsympathetic use by both local youth and townie pagans, such as the creation of numerous fire pits and the leaving of litter and broken glass after the festivals, does nothing for the atmosphere of this site.‚ÄùWhite Dragon Pagan Magazine dated 30 October 2004 In the beginning there may have been some thirty stone pillars. The survivors that still stand range in height from 10ins to , and stand in an ellipse NW-SE by The tallest is at the south- east end of the major axis, standing, perhaps by coincidence or design, close to the line of the southern moonrise. This pillar and a companion have been taken to flank an entrance about wide. Aubrey Burl has stated in his 2000 book A Guide to the Stone Circles of Britain, Ireland and Brittany that \\"There was a claim for a central stone and a very dubious eighteenth-century report that 'there was a stone across your two Portals, like those at Stonehenge, and that the stone at eighty yards distance was the altar.'\\" but that the \\"probability of a trilithon, otherwise unique to Stonehenge, at Mitchell's Fold, like an identical claim for Kerzerho in Brittany, should be regarded as rumour rather than reality.\\" Folklore Mitchell's Fold stone circle, 30 October 2004 As with most sites of this type, its true history is unknown. However, there is a traditional folkstory that a giant whose marvellous cow gave unlimited amounts of milk used the circle until a malicious witch milked the cow, using a sieve until it was drained dry, as a result of which it fled to Warwickshire where it became the Dun cow. As a punishment, the witch was turned into stone and surrounded by other stones to prevent her escaping. What became of the giant is unknown. Local folklore also suggests this is the actual place where King Arthur withdrew Excalibur from one of the stones in the circle and then became king of the Britains. Burl goes on to state that \\"An intriguing fact does exist however. Aerial photographs have revealed mediaeval ridge-and-furrow ploughmarks not only running up to the ring but also through it as though this 'prehistoric' megalithic ring might postdate the Middle Ages!\\" It does not. In the Middle Ages, the whole area was simply thoroughly farmed. In recent times, referred to as Yrvasnth (pron. Eer-Vasin-Ta), the site has been home to Germanic pagan revivalism and ritual. Other nearby prehistoric sites The only other known stone circles in Shropshire are the Hoarstones, only 1¬Ω miles northeast of the Fold, and the Whetstones, less than half a mile to the east of the Fold. So this area is a concentrated area of activity. Nearly all the latter's stones were blown up in the 1860s; now there is only a collapse of stones. When the last stone was uprooted in 1870 charcoal and bones were seen in its hole. The circle is north of Bishop's Castle, north of Corndon Hill over the Welsh border in the small village of White Grit and within a few miles of the Late Neolithic-Early Bronze Age picrite stone axe factory of Cwm- Mawr. To the south-east is a weathered cubical block on a small cairn. Along the path leading from the Fold which crosses Stapeley Common, home to the Cow Stone , or single standing Stone - Menhir and the Stapeley Hill Ring Cairn . Popular culture The circle features on the cover of the 2012 album 'Heathen Psalms' by Shropshire based pagan metal band Hrafnbl√≥√∞.

It was operated by the Indian Air Force (IAF) between 1977 and 1991. The Ajeet is a derivative of the British Folland Gnat light fighter aircraft. The Gnat, which had been procured in large numbers for the IAF and produced under license by HAL, had acquitted itself favourably during its Indian service, including in active combat roles during multiple conflicts with Pakistan, including the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. As such, the IAF had a positive attitude towards the type, despite observing shortcomings in maintainability and some subsystems. Thus, during 1972, the service issued a requirement calling for the development of an upgraded and more capable variant of the Gnat, leading to the development of the Ajeet by HAL. In the design phase of the Ajeet, HAL redesigned several aspects of the aircraft while seeking to improve both the reliability and effectiveness of several subsystems, such as the avionics and hydraulic systems. The adoption of a wet wing expanded the fighter's internal fuel capacity and freed-up several underwing hardpoints for other purposes, effectively increasing both the range and payload capability of the aircraft. On 6 March 1975, the first of two Ajeet prototypes, producing via the conversion of the final two licence-produced Gnat fighters, conducted its maiden flight. The satisfactory performance of these prototypes contributed to the issuing of a production order for the Ajeet. On 30 September 1976, the first production aircraft performed its maiden flight.Chopra 1977, p. 288. Introduced to service during the following year, the Ajeet had a relatively brief and unremarkable service life, equipping only a single IAF squadron and being withdrawn from service during 1991. Development =Background= During the 1950s, the government of India had came to an agreement with the United Kingdom to procure a large number of Folland Gnat fighters, a light combat-capable jet-propelled aircraft, for the Indian Air Force (IAF). In addition to the acquisition of British-built Gnats, the type was also manufactured under a licensing arrangement in India by aviation company Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). During its production run, in excess of 200 aircraft were constructed by HAL for the IAF; as much as 85 per cent of the airframe and 60 per cent of the engine were domestically produced. During 1958, the first Gnat fighter was accepted by the IAF into squadron service.Smith 1994, p. 159. During its service life with the IAF, the Gnat proved to be relatively successful when deployed for active combat missions. The type was used in both the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 and the follow-up Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 against neighbouring Pakistan. Operationally, it was used to conduct both low-level air superiority missions and to perform short range ground attack runs. Due to its effectiveness against Pakistani fighters, such the North American F-86 Sabre, the type was given the moniker of Sabre Slayer.Khan 2004, p. 137. The Gnat was ultimately operated by the IAF for several decades up until its retirement during the 1980s. According to aviation author Pushpindar Chopra, the design of the Gnat had both positive and negative attributes; while being inexpensive to construct and to operate, several of the onboard systems had been allegedly prone to low levels of reliability, particularly the control system of the aircraft, while some aspects had proved to be difficult to maintain.Chopra 1977, pp. 284‚Äì286. The reliability issues had been a known contributing factor to several accidents which had resulted in the total loss of individual Gnats and the deaths of several pilots. =Programme launch= Accordingly, while the Gnat had been determined to be effective as a combat aircraft, it was also viewed that there was room for improvement on the design of its subsystems. During 1972, the IAF therefore issued a formal requirement, calling for the development and production of an improved model of the Gnat. Although the original revision of the requirement had called for the type to be produced to function as an interceptor, it was subsequently modified to incorporate a secondary ground-attack role for the new model as well.Chopra 1977, pp. 286‚Äì287. According to a report by the Public Accounts Committee of the Indian Parliament, the IAF officials tasks with overseeing the programme lacked realistic concepts of what was involved in the development process nor firm ideas on what the aircraft was required for.Gupta 1997, p. 50. In response to the issuing of the original requirement, HAL set about designing their revision of the Gnat. Their work was greatly aided by an earlier decision to, upon the liquidation of Folland Aircraft during the 1960s, India had acquired many former assets of the company; the residual rights for the type had been transferred to the IAF while other items, such as the jigs and test apparatus, moved to HAL.Smith 1994, p. 160. Early on, the fledgling aircraft design received the name \\"Ajeet\\", Sanskrit for \\"Invincible\\" or \\"Unconquered\\". As the design developed, differences between the Ajeet and the original model of the Gnat that had served as its starting point became considerable. During the development process, deliberate efforts were made to rectify the encountered shortcomings and troubles discovered within the design of the earlier Gnat. In support of the development programme, HAL decided to modify the final pair of Gnats on the production line to serve as prototypes for the Ajeet. On 6 March 1975, the first of these prototypes conducted its maiden flight while the second prototype following on 5 November that year. The flight testing phase of the programme reportedly validated the success of the re-designed aircraft, leading to a production order being placed for the Ajeet. On 30 September 1976, the first production aircraft performed its maiden flight. Despite this, as late as 1979, additional development tasks and changing requirements were being added onto the programme; these were attributed by defense analyst Amit Gupta as having caused the Ajeet's associated costs to substantially rise as well as having led to setbacks in the programme's manufacturing effort. =Further development= During the late 1970s and early 1980s, HAL undertook work on a project intending to produce a training-oriented variant of the Ajeet. During 1982, this programme had progressed to the point where the initial flight of a prototype for evaluation purposes occurred. This sole aircraft was soon lost in a crash later that same year. The following year, a second prototype performed its maiden flight and was closely followed by a third. However, information on the Ajeet trainer programme was received with a lack of interest on the part of the Indian government. IAF Air Commodore Jasjit Singh observed that there was little need for a trainer version of the Ajeet as the original Gnat had already been developed into a training aircraft and therefore could have been acquired already if the IAF had the desire to do so.Singh 2013, The twin factors of the anticipated imminent phaseout of the Ajeet fighter and pessimism over the project's value from officials heavily contributed to the trainer initiative being curtailed without any further examples being produced. The two surviving aircraft were dispatched to briefly serve with the IAF's No.2 Squadron, where they were used until the phaseout of the Ajeet was completed during 1991. Design IAF Ajeet on undergoing cosmetic restoration, 2016 The HAL Ajeet was a jet-propelled light fighter, primarily intended to function as a low-level interceptor aircraft, while also being capable of ground-attack missions. Being a derivative of the earlier Gnat, the aircraft appeared to be visually similar to its predecessor; the presence of a pair of extra underwing hardpoints being amongst the only obvious distinguishing features from the older Gnat. In general, the Ajeet was equipped with a variety of more capable avionics and onboard systems than the original design.Chopra 1977, p. 288. However, the addition of these extra subsystems and features was not without consequence, as the Ajeet was less agile than the original Gnat.Kumar 2012, p. 373. One of the more significant changes made for the Ajeet was the addition of a wet wing, housing aviation fuel in the interior space within the wing. This had several effects on the overall design, including the substantial expansion of its internal fuel capacity and the freeing up of several underwing hardpoints that had been previously occupied by external fuel tanks, allowing for their use in the carriage of other equipment and armaments.Chopra 1977, p. 287. Furthermore, the carriage of even-greater payloads was also enabled via the installation of an additional pair of underwing hardpoints. Certain aspects of the aircraft were heavily redesigned from the Gnat, such as the much enhanced hydraulic systems, the improved landing gear arrangement, and refined control systems, to produce superior performance, compared to their original counterparts.Chopra 1977, pp. 287‚Äì288. The control surfaces were enhanced via the adoption of a slab tail configuration, which was unique to the Ajeet. It was also decided to outfit the aircraft with improved Martin-Baker GF4 ejection seats for improved survivability. Operational history During 1977, the HAL Ajeet was accepted into operational service with the IAF. However, only one squadron of the IAF ultimately operated the type, this being No.2 Squadron. According to political author Chris Smith, the lack of enthusiasm on the part of the IAF for the Ajeet was down to a change in attitudes; the service had allegedly become increasingly opposed to the use of single-engine aircraft while a preference for fighters capable of supersonic speeds had also grown, as such, the Ajeet contrasted poorly with these new priorities. However, according to military author Chris Smith, the Ajeet benefitted both from the positive combat reputation garnered by the Gnat, as well as for its relatively low radar cross-section (RCS). Having fallen out of political favour, less than a hundred Ajeets were ultimately procured and the whole programme was effectively terminated barely a decade following its initiation. Of those aircraft built, they had relatively short and uneventful careers, and were retired from IAF service during 1991. The Ajeet was never deployed in combat operations.

It is a common Palearctic species. Distribution The species occurs throughout almost the whole of Europe. In the north, the range extends to Middle Fennoscandia, in the east to the Urals. The species occurs in North Africa, Asia minor, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Caucasus, Central Asia to China, Korea and Japan (subspecies C. t. exigua (Butler, 1881)). It rises in the Alps up to 1600 m. Description This is a very variable species, both in size (wingspan 28‚Äì38 mm) and colour. The ground colour of the forewings varies from pale buff to dark or reddish brown with three narrow fascia. The area between the inner two fascia is sometimes much darker than the surrounding ground colour and is marked with stigmata, often quite indistinct. Melanic forms occasionally occur. The hindwings vary from pale cream to dingy brown. This moth flies at night from July to September and is attracted to light and sugar and sometimes to nectar-rich flowers. The larva is green with yellow lines and black and white spots. It feeds on a variety of plants, chiefly trees and shrubs (see list below) and also on the larvae of other Lepidoptera species, even occasionally its own species.

Conscripts were required to salute any officer they met, and the officer was required to return the salute. To harass the officer, the conscripts would gather in a group, the larger the better, and wait out of sight for an officer. When a British officer appeared some distance away, the conscripts would set out, one by one after the British officer's direction.

Biography  Gregory's father, James G. Gregory, was a doctor in Norwalk. She showed musical talent at an early age and was sent to Paris to receive a musical education when she was fifteen years old, and continued her study of music upon her return to the United States. She was invited by famous concert singer Katherine Tanner Fisk to return to Paris, live with her, and be trained as a professional singer. She remained in Paris with Mrs Fiske for a year. She was drawn gradually into public movements because of her interest in social justice. After returning to her home country, she decided to give up her singing ambitions. She became involved in local politics and the woman suffrage movement for which she was a fearless public speaker. Gregory decided to start a grassroots women's suffrage club in Connecticut, as she explains in her autobiography The Day Is Gone (page 100). The first meeting brought together herself and five other women. Gregory went on to become a key leader in the Connecticut Woman Suffrage Association through which she directed activities such as meetings, plays, and parades alongside Cromwell native Emily Miller Pierson. =She later (page 104, op. cit.) worked as assistant state organizer for the New Jersey Woman Suffrage Association during a referendum on woman suffrage in 1915 and was also active for the cause in the State of New York. = England = After a visit to England during the First World War, she settled in Patchin Place in New York City, where she formed close friendships with a group of young artists and writers. She worked for two years as a copywriter in an advertising agency, which position she left in order to earn her living as a freelance writer. She began contributing articles to such publications as The Freeman, The New Republic and The Dial, becoming Managing Editor of this last journal in February, 1924. Six months later, she married the English writer Llewelyn Powys, and in June 1925, resigned her position with The Dial to accompany her husband to England, where for five years they lived in a coastguard cottage on White Nothe, one of the wildest headlands of the Dorset coast. Her first novel, She Shall Have Music was published in 1926, followed by King Log and Lady Lea (1929) and Hester Craddock (1931), both of which were written in Dorset. She and her husband visited Palestine in 1928, and they spent the winter of 1930 in a house in the Berkshire Hills lent to them by Edna St. Vincent Millay and Eugen Boissevain. From there, they paid a visit to the West Indies. On their return to England, Llewelyn Powys suffered a relapse from an old illness, and in the winter of 1936, they went to Switzerland, where she wrote a book of essays, Wheels on Gravel (1938). In 1956, Alyse presented the author Rosemary Manning with a copy of Wheels on Gravel inscribed with a quotation from George Santayana: 'To understand oneself is the classic form of consolation, to elude oneself is the romantic'.Rosemary Manning, 'A Corridor of Mirrors' (London, The Women's Press Ltd., 1987), p.217 = Death of Powys = After Llewelyn Powys' death from tuberculosis in Switzerland in December 1939, Alyse went to live in a remote semi-detached house adjoining that occupied by Llewelyn's sisters, Gertrude and Philippa Powys, on Chaldon Down near East Chaldon, and wrote her autobiographical reminiscences, entitled The Day Is Gone, published in New York by E. P. Dutton (1948). She was a friend of many eminent people, including Florida Scott- Maxwell (who had been a pupil of Jung), Randolph Bourne, Van Wyck Brooks, Lewis Mumford, Amy Lowell, William Rose Ben√©t and his brother Stephen Vincent Ben√©t, Malcolm Elwin, Theodore Dreiser, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Marianne Moore and Sylvia Townsend Warner. She tended to remain in the shadow of her late husband (whose work and reputation she did much to promote), while continuing to contribute her own articles to a variety of journals up until the late 1950s. In 1957, Alyse Gregory moved into Velthams Cottage, Morebath, Devon, as the tenant of Mrs Rosamund Mary Rose (n√©e Rosamund Mary Trafford), at a rent of \\"one peppercorn a year (if demanded)\\". After the sudden death of her landlady on May 12, 1958, Velthams was bought at auction in 1960 by the writer Oliver Stonor, who had known Alyse previously; they were both present at local celebrations in East Chaldon on 7 or 8 May 1945, for the end of the Second World War in Europe, which took the form of a large bonfire near the Five Marys, a local group of prehistoric barrows. In her last years, many friends visited her, in spite of the rural isolation of Morebath, which had a railway station until 1966. Alyse had long been an advocate of voluntary euthanasia, and planned her own. She took a lethal overdose on 27 August 1967, and was cremated in Taunton, Somerset. Her last visitor on the day of her death was the author Rosemary Manning who described the visit in her autobiography A Corridor of Mirrors.Rosemary Manning, 'A Corridor of Mirrors' (London, The Women's Press Ltd., 1987), p.221 = Legacy = Excerpts from Gregory's diaries were published in 1973 under the title The Cry of a Gull.

It claims a history stretching back 6,000 years. There are two main parts of Salobre√±a; The first is The Old Town which sits atop a rocky prominence and is a cluster of whitewashed houses and steep narrow streets leading up to a tenth-century Moorish castle, called 'Castillo de Salobre√±a' and it is one of its main tourist attractions. The second part of Salobre√±a is new developments which spread from the bottom of the Old Town right to the beach. The whole town is almost surrounded by sugarcane fields on each side along the coast and further inland. Another tourist attraction in Salobre√±a is 'El Pe√±√≥n' (The Rock), which divides two of Salobre√±a's five beaches and juts out between Playa La Guardia and Playa de la Charca/Solamar and into the sea. History =Geological background= At the close of the last glacial maximum, the Motril-Salobre√±a plain on which Salobre√±a now stands was not yet land: rather it was a large bay studded with a number of dolomite crags which were islands, most prominently the formation now known as Monte Hacho (73m) and the headland on which Salobre√±a now stands (110m). The Guadalfeo river drained into the bay, running down the Tajo de los Vados gorge which separates the Sierra de Escalate to the north-east of Salobre√±a from the Sierra de Chaparral to the west. The river gradually filled the bay with silt comprising post-orogenic, miocenic, and quaternary material, producing a fertile alluvial plain, on which agriculture could begin by the Bronze Age. At this time, the outcrop on which the old town of Salobre√±a now stands had become a peninsula.Salobre√±a: Rutas y senderos / Countryside Paths and Walks, ed. by Juan Manuel P√©rez, trans. by Deborah Green (Salobre√±a: Ayuntamiento de Salobre√±a, 2009), , pp. 7-8, 16. Meanwhile, the rocky outcrop of the Pe√±on, which now juts from La Guardia beach into the sea, remained an island into the seventeenth century. A map of 1722 is the first evidence that the beach had reached it, making it a peninsula.Salobre√±a: Rutas y senderos / Countryside Paths and Walks, ed. by Juan Manuel P√©rez, trans. by Deborah Green (Salobre√±a: Ayuntamiento de Salobre√±a, 2009), , p. 23. =Ancient= Archaeological finds show human habitation around Salobre√±a at the rocky promontory known as the Pe√±on beginning in the Neolithic period, when the Pe√±on was still an island, with strata perhaps beginning as early as the palaeolithic period and continuing into the Bronze Age at the Cueva del Capit√°n (Captain's Cave) in the nearby hamlet of Lobres. Evidence of Bronze Age settlement from around 1500 BCE has also been found on the Salobre√±a headland and, slightly further inland again, Monte Hacho. Such settlements would have been characteristic of the settlement of easily defensible rocky headlands in the region at the time.Salobre√±a: Rutas y senderos / Countryside Paths and Walks, ed. by Juan Manuel P√©rez, trans. by Deborah Green (Salobre√±a: Ayuntamiento de Salobre√±a, 2009), , pp. 7-8. Salobre√±a is thought to have experienced contact with the Phoenicians around the eighth century BCE and then Greek and Punic culture around the sixth. At this time, its name is attested as Selambina. A major impact of Roman culture is, however, visible for the second century BCE, attested in widespread archaeological finds.Salobre√±a: Rutas y senderos / Countryside Paths and Walks, ed. by Juan Manuel P√©rez, trans. by Deborah Green (Salobre√±a: Ayuntamiento de Salobre√±a, 2009), , pp. 8-9. =Medieval= In 713 CE, the region of Elvira (roughly corresponding to the Province of Granada today) came under the Arab rule of M≈´sa bin Nusayr, and by the tenth century, a castle (·∏•i·π£n) at Salobre√±a is recorded in Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Musa al-Razi's Cr√≥nica del moro Rasis. Al-Razi also noted the introduction of the cultivation of sugar cane at Salobre√±a.Salobre√±a: Rutas y senderos / Countryside Paths and Walks, ed. by Juan Manuel P√©rez, trans. by Deborah Green (Salobre√±a: Ayuntamiento de Salobre√±a, 2009), , pp. 9-10.Carmen Trillo San Jos√© and Gari Amtmann, 'Un castillo junto al r√≠o Laroles: ¬ø≈†ant Afliy?', AyTM, 8 (2001), 305-23 (p. 309). The main crop of medieval Salobre√±a was sugar-cane, though other attested crops include cumin and bananas.Salobre√±a: Rutas y senderos / Countryside Paths and Walks, ed. by Juan Manuel P√©rez, trans. by Deborah Green (Salobre√±a: Ayuntamiento de Salobre√±a, 2009), , p. 10. By the eleventh century, Ibn Hayyan could refer to Salobre√±a as a medina ('town'), a denomination that became usual by the fourteenth century, when Salobre√±a was the seat of government for surrounding hamlets like V√©lez de Benaudalla, Molvizar, and Lobres.Jos√© Navas Rodr√≠guez and Jos√© Mar√≠a Garc√≠a-Consuegra Flores, 'La Salobre√±a isl√°mica: Configuraci√≥n de una madina Nazar√≠' (2013).Salobre√±a: Rutas y senderos / Countryside Paths and Walks, ed. by Juan Manuel P√©rez, trans. by Deborah Green (Salobre√±a: Ayuntamiento de Salobre√±a, 2009), , p. 10. In 1489, Granada came under Castilian rule, and Francisco Ramirez de Madrid became governor of Salobre√±a's fortress and town. The next year, the inhabitants of the town supported the resistance of Muhammad XII of Granada to Castilian rule, which speeded the increase of Castilian migration into the settlement. In 1568-69, the Moriscos of Salobre√±a participated in revolts.Salobre√±a: Rutas y senderos / Countryside Paths and Walks, ed. by Juan Manuel P√©rez, trans. by Deborah Green (Salobre√±a: Ayuntamiento de Salobre√±a, 2009), , pp. 10-11. =Modern= Sugar-cane remained key to the town's economy through the sixteenth century, returning to prominence in the nineteenth. In between, cotton became the dominant crop. The early-modern history of Salobre√±a is not well understood. In the nineteenth century, however, Salobre√±a was strategically important in the Spanish War of Independence, and also adopted new steam-technologies for sugar production pioneered in Cuba. The expansion of the town in the second half of the nineteenth century that was driven by a boom in sugar-cane production led to the demolition of the last remains of its medieval walls. By the 1970s, settlement was expanding from the outcrop on which the old town sits onto the alluvial plain below.Salobre√±a: Rutas y senderos / Countryside Paths and Walks, ed. by Juan Manuel P√©rez, trans. by Deborah Green (Salobre√±a: Ayuntamiento de Salobre√±a, 2009), , pp. 11-15. Today, the economy of the coastal plain around Salobre√±a is based on tourism and sugarcane agriculture, while the mountains are characterised by terraced agriculture with almond and, increasingly, sub- tropical fruit trees (with custard apples and avocado pears being the first to be introduced).Salobre√±a: Rutas y senderos / Countryside Paths and Walks, ed. by Juan Manuel P√©rez, trans. by Deborah Green (Salobre√±a: Ayuntamiento de Salobre√±a, 2009), , pp. 17-19, 28. The last remaining cane sugar factory in Europe was located along the coast just west of the village of La Caleta de Salobre√±a. It closed in 2006.http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/111572/0/Adios/ultima/azucarera/ Climate Beach and castle, photographed from the Pe√±on. Salobre√±a's climate is a Mediterranean, semi-arid climate, with annual rainfall of 500mm per year, and whose microclimate is sub-tropical. In the hotter months, average temperatures are around 24 ¬∞C, peaking in August around the mid 30 ¬∞C's during the day and mid 20 ¬∞C's at night and around 12 ¬∞C in the colder months. The annual average temperature is 17 ¬∞C.Salobre√±a: Rutas y senderos / Countryside Paths and Walks, ed. by Juan Manuel P√©rez, trans. by Deborah Green (Salobre√±a: Ayuntamiento de Salobre√±a, 2009), , p. 17.

Allergan, Inc. was formed in 1948, incorporated in 1950 and became a public company in 1970. It ceased operation in 2015 when it was acquired by Irish-based Activis plc (itself a 2013 U.S. tax inversion to Ireland), who then renamed the group as Allergan plc. Early history  The company traces its roots back to 1948 and pharmacist Gavin S. Herbert, who in 1950 established Allergan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Allergan focused on the discovery and development of novel formulations for specialty markets, as well as intimate collaboration with physicians and the scientific community. 1953 saw Allergan producing eye drops and formulating new products such as the first cortisone eye drop to treat allergic inflammation and the first ophthalmic steroid decongestant. Acquisitions Allergan became a publicly traded company in 1970 and was acquired by SmithKline for $259 million in 1980. After generating $756 million in revenue and $80 million in profit in 1988, Allergan was spun-off by SmithKline Beckman in 1989. In July 2002, the Allergan ophthalmic surgical and contact lens care businesses were spun-off to create a new company, Advanced Medical Optics. In 2003, Allergan's flagship product, Botox, was the focus of a high-profile lawsuit and media scrutiny. In March 2006, Allergan acquired Inamed Corporation for $3 billion. On March 1, 2013, the company acquired MAP Pharmaceuticals Inc., a development-stage company mainly researching the treatment of migraine and other oral drugs in Neurology for approximately $958 million. The principal products of this sub-company are under review with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In December 2013, the company sold its obesity intervention business to Apollo Endosurgery, Inc., for a cash payment of $75 million and a $15 million minority equity interest in Apollo Endosurgery. In November 2014 Actavis announced its intention to acquire Allergan, Inc., the manufacturer of Botox Completion of the deal would increase its market capitalization to $147 billion. On March 17, 2015, Abbvie, plc completed the acquisition of Allergan, Inc. in a cash and equity transaction valued at approximately $70.5 billion, and was folded into that company. The combination created a $23 billion diversified global pharmaceutical company with commercial reach across 100 countries. In June 2015, Abbvie, plc officially changed its name to Allergan, plc. In June Allergan, Inc. announced it would acquire Kythera Biopharmaceuticals for around $2.1 billion. The above information is incorrect. AbbVie acquired Allergan in 2019/2020. AbbVie has not changed its name. The above may be referring to the Actavis acquisition. =Attempted acquisition by Valeant Pharmaceuticals= On April 22, 2014, details were released by Valeant Pharmaceuticals and hedge fund CEO, Bill Ackman, about a $46 billion (CAD) offer presented to Allergan. Valeant proposed to exchange $48.30 in cash and 0.83 shares of Valeant per Allergan share. Allergan, Inc. stockholders would own 43 per cent of the combined company. This bid was rejected by Allergan as being too risky, claiming Valeant's business model of serial acquisitions and low organic growth being unsustainable. Soon after Valeant released a statement saying a new offer will be presented May 28, 2014, where it emerged that Valeant had increased their offer to $49.4 billion. On May 31 the offer was revised and increased to $53.3 billion. On June 18, Valeant began its tender offer for a hostile takeover of Allergan. In August 27, 2014, Valeant and Pershing Square Capital Management asked a Chancery Judge to set a trial for September 24, 2014 to decide on whether Valeant and Pershing had properly secured enough support from Allergan shareholders to force a meeting of investors to consider replacing a majority of the company's directors. On the same day Allergan announced that they had set a December shareholder vote to decide whether the company should replace part of the board of directors. In the afternoon of August 27, Bloomberg reported that Valeant and Pershing Square had won their case with the Chancery Judge setting an October 6 date for the aforementioned trial. On November 17, 2014, Actavis, plc announced it would acquire Allergan in a white knight bid for approximately $66 billion, putting an end to Valeant's hostile takeover attempt. Company Structure  Safety reports  In 2011, FDA reported issues in the investigation of safety of silicone gel-filled breast implants. However, the company announced later the reassurance to patients of the safety and exclusion of its drugs from the investigated breast implant devices, stating that all of its products are above safety standards around the world.

(Valladolid, Spain, May 15, 1933 ‚Äì San Salvador, El Salvador, November 16, 1989) was a scholar, philosopher, educator, sociologist and Jesuit priest. He was one of the victims of the 1989 murders of Jesuits in El Salvador. Biography Segundo Montes grew up in Valladolid, Spain, where he also went to secondary school until 1950. On August 15, 1950, he entered the novitiate of the Society of Jesus in Ordu√±a. After a year there, he moved to Santa Tecla in El Salvador under the mentorship of Miguel Elizondo, who described him as an adolescent who hit the football so hard against the wall of the Iglesia El Carmen that he rattled the roof tiles. When he fulfilled his studies in the novitiate in 1952, he followed the steps of other Jesuit students in Central America and moved to Quito to study classical humanities at the Catholic University. In 1954, he began studies in philosophy, fulfilling his licenciatura (licenciate) in 1957. He then returned to San Salvador to teach at the school Externado San Jos√©. In 1960, he returned to university to study theology. He started in O√±a, where he lived for a year. He later moved to Innsbruck, where he completed the three remaining years of studies. He was ordained a priest July 25, 1963. He returned to Externado San Jos√© as a teacher and was naturalised as a Salvadoran citizen. Segundo Montes spent most of his time in the school Externado San Jos√© or in Universidad Centroamericana \\"Jos√© Sime√≥n Ca√±as\\" (UCA). He worked for two periods in Externado; from 1957 to 1960 and 1966 to 1976. He taught physics for many years, and he was responsible for the laboratories in the school. He was a Prefect of Discipline and Administrative Director. In between 1973 and 1976, he was Rector of Externado San Jos√©, which was precisely a moment when the school was going through a deep identity crisis. The consequences of the Second Vatican Council and the Episcopal Conference of Medell√≠n had made Externado San Jos√© express a preference for the poor and to prioritize education that contributed to modify the social differences in El Salvador. This sort of discourse was not well received by the Salvadoran elites, who had been traditionally served by Externado San Jos√©. Segundo Montes handled this crisis in a constructive way. He was very popular among students and he had many friends. This changed, however, as the political environment in El Salvador became more polarized later in the 1970s. He was not singled out in propagandistic government pamphlets against critical intellectuals until towards the end of his life, when his name started figuring in the lists of Jesuits who were accused of being revolutionaries. His name was commonly the third one after Ignacio Ellacur√≠a and Ignacio Mart√≠n-Bar√≥. Gradually Segundo Montes started assuming more responsibilities in UCA as a lecturer in social sciences. For a period, he worked as a Dean in the Faculty of Natural Sciences. To prepare himself for academia, he travelled to Spain, and in 1978 he completed a PhD in Social Anthropology in Universidad Complutense in Madrid. His dissertation was about \\"compadrazgo\\" relationships in El Salvador. His field work included interviews that he performed on weekends in the western part of the country. He returned to teach Sociology in UCA, and starting in 1980, he was the head of the Department of Political Sciences and Sociology. Between 1978 and 1982, he was a member of the editorial board in the academic journal Estudios Centroamericanos (ECA). He was also a member of the editorial board of the Bolet√≠n de Ciencias Econ√≥micas y Sociales and the journal Realidad Econ√≥mico Social. He was a regular contributor to these journals. He also gave many lectures for national institutes, colleges, worker's unions, cooperatives and political parties. He was also a member of the board of directors in UCA. He headed the team of lawyers who put together UCA's law study program. Beginning in 1984, he headed the research project on Salvadoran refugees. Toward the end of the 1980s, he was the managing director of the human rights institution he founded: Instituto de Derechos Humanos de la UCA (IDHUCA), and before his death, he was preparing the program for the master's degree in sociology. A prolific writer, Segundo Montes left behind a series of articles and books. From 1982 and onwards he wrote at least one book a year. He wrote mostly in Spanish, and so far none of his works originally in Spanish have been translated to English. However, his research on refugees, displaced people and human rights made him well-known internationally. He visited Washington, D.C., on repeated occasions, to testify in the corresponding committees in the United States Congress, to defend the rights of Salvadoran refugees. His last trip to Washington was in early November 1989. In one of the halls of Congress, the organisation CARECEN (an organisation for the assistance of refugees) granted him a prize for defending the rights of Salvadorans.  Social anthropology  Segundo Montes did research and wrote on social stratification, land ownership, the possibilities for democracy and the military. His work on these issues is still a dominant influence on the theoretical frameworks employed by researchers to analyse Salvadoran society. His work is referenced in studies of power distribution and the effects of emigration on Salvadoran society. His published articles included an analysis of economic, political, and other motives for Salvadoran emigration to the United States. It addressed claims by the United States government that Salvadoran immigrants were economic refugees who therefore did not qualify for political asylum.Segundo Montes (1988). \\"Migration to the United States as an Index of the Intensifying Social and Political Crises in El Salvador\\", Journal of Refugee Studies 1988 1:107‚Äì126. The political implications of Montes' commitment to his ideas met strong opposition from the conservative religious and political forces in El Salvador. This opposition led to Montes' murder by the Salvadoran Army in 1989 at his residence in UCA along with five other fellow Jesuit priests (among them Ignacio Ellacur√≠a and Ignacio Mart√≠n-Bar√≥) and two employees. Their murders marked a turning point in the Salvadoran civil war (see History of El Salvador). It increased international pressures on the Salvadoran government to sign the Chapultepec Peace Accords with the guerrillas.

Edgardo was passionate about football, played in childhood Baby Football teams in the area and in his teens he played as goalkeeper for the Club Atl√©tico Cerro of Montevideo. He began his career as a referee in Uruguay in 1976. By 1977 he had his debut match in the Primera Divisi√≥n Uruguaya refereeing Cerro vs Hurac√°n. In 1980, he traveled to Mexico where he had contact with the Mexican Football Federation. He advanced in his refereeing, starting to referee international matches and finals in Mexico. Codesal represented Mexico, as a CONCACAF referee in the 1990 World Cup. Among his international posts, Codesal was CONCACAF's director of referees, head of refereeing for the FIFA Women's World Cup USA 1999, and member of the refereeing committee for the FIFA World U-20 Championship in Nigeria, the Confederations Cup in Mexico and the FIFA World U-17 Championship in New Zealand. =1990 World Cup= FIFA observers rated Codesal 8.5 for his refereeing performance at the 1990 World Cup. Codesal had refereed the Italy vs USA match in the first round (group A), won by Italy for 1-0. He refereed the quarter final between England vs Cameroon, awarding three penalties - one to Cameroon and two to England. England won 3-2 to move into the semi-finals.

Williams and David Edge (1996), \\"Central to social shaping of technology (SST) is the concept that there are choices (though not necessarily conscious choices) inherent in both the design of individual artifacts and systems, and in the direction or trajectory of innovation programs.\\" If technology does not emerge from the unfolding of a predetermined logic or a single determinant, then innovation is a 'garden of forking paths'. Different routes are available, potentially leading to different technological outcomes. Significantly, these choices could have differing implications for society and for particular social groups. SST is one of the models of the technology: society relationship which emerged in the 1980s with MacKenzie and Wajcman's influential 1985 collection, alongside Pinch and Bijker's social construction of technology framework and Callon and Latour's actor-network theory. These have a common feature of criticism of the linear model of innovation and technological determinism. It differs from these notably in the attention it pays to the influence of the social and technological context of development which shapes innovation choices. SST is concerned to explore the material consequences of different technical choices, but criticizes technological determinism, which argues that technology follows its own developmental path, outside of human influences, and in turn, influences society. In this way, social shaping theorists conceive the relationship between technology and society as one of 'mutual shaping'. Some versions of this theory state that technology affects society by affordances, constraints, preconditions, and unintended consequences (Baym, 2015). Affordance is the idea that technology makes specific tasks easier in our lives, while constraints make tasks harder to complete. The preconditions of technology are the skills and resources that are vital to using technology to its fullest potential. Finally, the unintended consequences of technology are unanticipated effects and impact of technology. The cell phone is an example of the social shaping of technology (Zulto 2009). The cell phone has evolved over the years to make our lives easier by providing people with handheld computers that can answer calls, answer emails, search for information, and complete numerous other tasks (Zulto, 2009). Yet it has constraints for those that are not technologically savvy, hindering many people in society who do not understand how to utilize these devices. There are preconditions, such as monthly bills and access to electricity. There are also many unintended consequences such as the unintended distraction they cause for many people. Not only does technology affect society, but according to SST, society affects technology by way of economics, politics, and culture (Baym, 2015). For instance, cell phones have spread in poor countries due to cell phones being more affordable than a computer and internet service (economics), government regulations which have made it fairly easy for cell phone providers to build networks (politics), and the small size of cell phones which fit easily into many cultures‚Äô need for mobile communication (culture).

It was set up to rescue the famous Double Maxim beer, which had ceased production when the Vaux brewery was closed in 1999. In 2019 Maxim Brewery supported the making of a short film 'A passion for Vaux' celebrating Sunderlands large lost but not forgotten brewery. Mark anderson Managing Director History The new company, Double Maxim Beer Company, was founded by ex-Vaux directors Doug Trotman, Mark Anderson and ex-Vaux head brewer, Jim Murray, and in 2000 re-launched Double Maxim. Brewing of the beer was initially contracted to Robinson's of Stockport. In 2003, the company bought the brand and recipes of a former Vaux subsidiary, Wards, and relaunched Wards Best Bitter, again to be brewed and bottled by Robinson's. A cask version was later launched, initially brewed by Jennings of Cockermouth and latterly Robinson's. A second Vaux ale was resurrected in 2005 in the form of Samson, again sold in 500ml bottles. Its fourth beer, Maximus, was created for (and won) entry in the internationally acclaimed Tesco Beer Challenge, in 2005. All of its beers are sold in 500ml bottles in the United Kingdom. The company achieved its aim of returning brewing to Sunderland in 2008, when the new Maxim Brewery was opened at Houghton-le-Spring. With the closure of Federation Brewery in 2010, the renamed Maxim Brewery was joined by 2 brewers ex Tyne Brewery. Maxim Brewery is now the biggest independent brewery in the North East of England. Along with the famous Double Maxim, Samson, Wards and Lambtons, the company also produces Swedish Blonde a 4.2% IPA style beer and Maximus a 6% strong Ale. Maxim was first brewed in 1901 to celebrate the return of the Maxim Gun detachment from the Boer War. It was commanded by colonel Ernest Vaux and the North East style Brown Ale is one of the oldest surviving beers in the United Kingdom. In 1938, the strength of the original Maxim beer was increased and it was renamed Double Maxim.

Yonge and Queen Streets overlooking various Eaton's buildings in the early 1920s. The Annex building can be seen in the middle behind Eaton's Main Store. The Annex building in the background on James Street, with City Hall in the foreground, May 1917. Eaton's Annex was a 10-storey building containing both retail and office space in Downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It opened in January 1913 and was located at the northwest corner of Albert Street and James Street, west of Eaton's Main Store and north of Toronto's (now former) City Hall. History Eaton's Santa Claus Parade in 1926, with views of City Hall (left) and the Main Store (right) in the foreground, the Annex building (behind City Hall) in the middleground, and Eaton's factory buildings in the background. By 1900, the Eaton's department store owned most of the land within the city blocks bordered by Yonge Street, Queen Street, Bay Street and Dundas Street. The land was eventually occupied by the Eaton's Main Store, the Annex building and various Eaton's warehouses and mail-order buildings. The Main Store and the Annex, however, were the only two buildings open to the public. The two buildings were connected by an underground passageway open to both employees and shoppers. It was the first underground pathway in Toronto open to the public, and it is often credited as a historic precursor to Toronto's current downtown PATH network. When the Annex building opened in 1913 as Eaton's House Furnishing Building, it contained Eaton's housewares and furniture departments. When these departments were moved to the new College Street store in 1930, the focus of the Annex's retail offerings was shifted to lower-cost items. While the Main Store catered to middle-class budgets, and the College Street store's offerings were more upscale, the Annex store was directed to Toronto's working classes. It offered many of the same departments and types of goods as Eaton's other two Toronto stores, but in cheaper varieties, and with less extensive in-store displays and customer service. As such, the Annex represented one of the first instances in Canada where a traditional, full-line department store operated a separate discount outlet or chain. The Eaton's Annex and some surrounding warehouses were destroyed by fire on May 9, 1977. The fire was described as \\"the first of its kind in downtown Toronto since the Great Fire of 1904\\". Although it destroyed a number of Eaton's buildings and damaged the nearby Church of the Holy Trinity, it did not significantly affect the newly constructed first phase of the Toronto Eaton Centre.Armstrong, Frederick. City in the Making. Toronto: Dundurn Press, 1988. . Page 327. Legacy Parts of the Annex building survive as Trinity Square. A portion of the Bell Trinity Square office complex currently occupies the former Annex site. The same underground passage that formerly linked the Annex and the Main Store now connects the Eaton Centre to the Bell Trinity Centre, and it is part of the PATH network. In honour of this store, a ski run at the Caledon Ski Club in Caledon, Ontario, was named \\"Eaton's Annex\\" after the Eaton family, who were original members of the private club.

Miguel Litt√≠n was not included in this list, instead, he found his name in another list of people who are banned from visiting Chile.

It was, importantly, also one of the first new theatres to abandon the traditional stage layout; instead a single tier of seats surrounded the stage on three sides. History The 20th-century theatre was the life's work of actor Bernard Miles with his wife, Josephine Wilson. His original Mermaid Theatre was a large barn at his house in the St. John's Wood area of London. This seated 200 people, and during 1951 and 1952 was used for concerts, plays and a celebrated opera production of Dido and Aeneas with Kirsten Flagstad, Maggie Teyte and Thomas Hemsley, conducted by Geraint Jones, which was recorded by HMV. For the third season in 1953 the Mermaid Theatre was moved to the Royal Exchange. Miles was encouraged to build a permanent theatre and, raising money from public subscriptions, and his revenues from publicity spots for the Egg Marketing Board; he oversaw the creation of the new building on land formerly occupied by a warehouse. This site was close to the location of an abortive attempt, in the Jacobean era, to build a theatre (named Porter's Hall) for the amalgamation of the Children of the Queen's Revels and Lady Elizabeth's Men. This project, undertaken by Philip Rosseter with distant backing from Henslowe and Alleyn, was ended because of complaints from the neighbourhood's residents. The new Mermaid Theatre opened on May 28, 1959 with a successful production of Lock Up Your Daughters and it was the venue for many other very successful productions, such as Cowardy Custard (often cited as responsible for the revival of interest in No√´l Coward's works) and including an annual staging of Treasure Island, with Miles reprising his role of Long John Silver, which he also played in a television version. The Mermaid Theatre also ran the Molecule Club, educating children about science. In July 1961 the poet and author Sylvia Plath read her poem \\"Tulips\\" at the Poetry at the Mermaid Festival, sponsored by the Arts Council of Great Britain. The programme notes that there were twelve commissioned poets at the festival, one of whom was Plath's husband, Ted Hughes. Other notable productions include the 1978 premi√®re of Whose Life Is It Anyway?, with Tom Conti and Rona Anderson.. The Royal Shakespeare Company sometimes transferred Stratford productions to the Mermaid, including a residency during 1987 which saw the staging of seven plays.https://cdn2.rsc.org.uk/sitefinity/press-resources/performance-history ---june-2016.pdf?sfvrsn=8 Gomba Holdings, a property company owned by Ugandan Asian businessman Abdul Shamji and his family, which claimed to have interests in the Garrick and Duchess theatres as well as Wembley Stadium, bought the theatre in the mid-1980s in the hope of redeveloping the Puddle Dock site. Bernard Miles' tenure as honorary artistic advisor was abruptly terminated and the theatre's importance declined. In 1989 Abdul Shamji was sentenced to 15-months in prison over his involvement in the Johnson Matthey bank collapse. Josephine Wilson died in 1990 and Bernard (by then Lord) Miles died in 1991, financially destitute. Marc Sinden was appointed artistic director in 1993, opening the Bernard Miles Studio as a second performance area, but left the next year.http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/facethefacts 3 August 1994 Actor Roy Marsden and Vanessa Ford took over the running of the theatre for a few months prior to its eventual closure and the termination of the Shamji family's ownership. After a further change of ownership the theatre was slated for demolition in 2002 as part of redevelopment plans. Already it had fallen into disuse, the buildings being used more often as a conference centre than a theatre. A preservation campaign by actors and other supporters attempted to reverse the decision. In April 2003 Ken Livingstone, the Mayor of London, ordered the council to block the demolition. As of March 2005 new plans had been submitted for the redevelopment of the site. Nothing materialised and the building continued to operate primarily as a conference centre. The BBC Concert Orchestra used it for occasional concerts, and the BBC recorded a popular weekly radio show, Friday Night is Music Night that showcased musicians such as the violinist Nigel Kennedy and singer Josh Groban. In 2006, music duo Pet Shop Boys played a mid-length set accompanied by the BBC Concert Orchestra and special guests including Robbie Williams, Francis Barber and Rufus Wainwright which was musically directed by Trevor Horn. The show was documented on the audio release entitled Concrete. Loss of theatre status, and redevelopment plans In September 2008 the Corporation of London City Planning Committee, against the advice of the Theatres Trust and noted actors, producers and artistic directors, granted a certificate that stripped the former playhouse of its theatre status. The move may save the developer ¬£6 million worth of Section 106 funding which it had previously agreed to pay in lieu if it closed the 600-seat Mermaid; the company could be released from the obligation because no theatrical productions have taken place for more than ten years. The existing plans would see the Puddle Dock building converted into a conference centre and fitness suite, plus offices, a nightclub and retail and restaurant space. Campaigners were concerned that the entire building might be demolished. The former chairman of the Save London's Theatres Campaign, John Levitt, called the decision ‚Äúa tragedy‚Äù and ‚Äúsheer meanness‚Äù. In 2018 the Mermaid Theatre still exists as a conference centre called The Mermaid London.

The Summons of the Lord of Hosts is a collection of the tablets of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, founder of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, that were written to the kings and rulers of the world during his exile in Adrianople and in the early years of his exile to the fortress town of Acre (now in Israel) in 1868. Bah√° ºu'll√°h claimed to be the Promised One of all religions and all ages and summoned the leaders of East and West to recognize him as the promised one. The Summons of the Lord of Hosts is the printing of five distinct tablets of this material. S√∫riy-i-Haykal (Tablet of the Temple) :See online text here The S√∫riy-i-Haykal () or Tablet of the Temple, is a composite work which consists of a tablet followed by five messages addressed to Pope Pius IX, Napoleon III, Tsar Alexander II of Russia, Queen Victoria, and Naser al-Din Shah Qajar. The messages were written while Bah√° ºu'll√°h was in Adrianople, and shortly after its completion, Bah√° ºu'll√°h instructed the Surih and the tablets to the kings be written in the form of a Haykal (temple), a five-pointed star, and added to it the conclusion: Shoghi Effendi, who described the tablet as one of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's most challenging works, writes about the S√∫riy-i Haykal, \\"words which reveal the importance He attached to those Messages, and indicate their direct association with the prophecies of the Old Testament\\", referring to the prophecy where Zechariah had promised the rebuilding of the Temple in the End of Times. In the Book of Zechariah it is recorded: Shoghi Effendi, in The Promised Day is Come (pp. 47‚Äì8), refers to this rebuilding of the temple as fulfilled in the return of the Manifestation of God in a human temple. Throughout the tablet, Bah√° ºu'll√°h address the Haykal (\\"the Temple\\") and explains the glory which is invested in it. Bah√° ºu'll√°h, in response to a question, has stated that the Haykal is the person of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. Adib Taherzadeh has written that \\"[i]t is fascinating to know that the One Who speaks with the voice of God in this Tablet is identical with the One spoken to.\\" Regarding the Haykal, Bah√° ºu'll√°h writes that it refers to the human or physical temple of the Manifestation of God (prophets of God). He states that the Manifestation of God is a pure mirror that reflects the sovereignty of God and manifests God's beauty and grandeur to mankind. In essence Bah√° ºu'll√°h explains that the Manifestation of God is a \\"Living Temple\\" and every time that Bah√° ºu'll√°h addresses the Haykal he shows a new facet of God's revelation. The Haykal, which represents the Manifestation of God who spreads the Word of God in the form of a human temple, has members each of whom symbolize one of the signs and attributes of God. To the eyes of the Haykal he asks it to not look at the world of creation, but instead to focus on the beauty of God. To the Haykal's ears Bah√° ºu'll√°h asks it to become deaf to the voices of the ungodly and to listen to the Word of God. To the tongue of the Haykal Bah√° ºu'll√°h states that it has been created to mention the name of God. To the hands of the Haykal Bah√° ºu'll√°h asks them to stretch out upon all humankind and hold within their grasp the reins of God. Finally, Bah√° ºu'll√°h states that from the heart of the Haykal knowledge will emerge and raise scientists who will bring about technological achievements. Another symbol used by Bah√° ºu'll√°h in describing the Haykal is through the four letters (H, Y, K, and L) that compose the word in Arabic. Bah√° ºu'll√°h in the tablet explains the spiritual significance of each letter: H is for Huwiyyah (Essence of Divinity), Y is for Qad√≠r (Almighty), K is for Kar√≠m (All Bountiful), and L is for Fadl (Grace). Regarding the five other messages to the rulers that form the pentacle of the S√∫riy-i-Haykal, Bah√° ºu'll√°h tells them he is the Manifestation of God for this day, and that they should accept his message. The message to Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, which is the longest message, was delivered to the Shah by Bad√≠ ª, a youth who was killed by the Shah shortly thereafter. S√∫riy-i-Ra'√≠s \\"Tablet of the Chief\\" Muhammad Isma ªil Kashani, a follower of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, in whose honour the S√∫riy-i Ra'√≠s was written. :See online text here The S√∫riy-i-Ra'√≠s (, Suriy-e Ra'is), or \\"Tablet of the Chief\\", which addresses Mehmed Emin √Çli Pasha, the Ottoman Prime Minister, was written in August 1868, when Bah√° ºu'll√°h and the other Bah√° º√≠s were being exiled from Adrianople to Gallipoli to their final destination of the prison city of Acre. The S√∫riy-i Ra'√≠s, written in Arabic, was revealed in honour of Muhammad Isma ªil Kashani, a faithful believer of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. In the tablet, Bah√° ºu'll√°h writes about √Çli Pasha's claimed abuse of civil power. In the tablet, Bah√° ºu'll√°h tells √Çli Pasha, whom he calls chief, to listen to the voice of God, and that no power on earth can prevent him from proclaiming God's message and from achieving his purpose. Bah√° ºu'll√°h further accuses √Çli Pasha of conspiring with the Qajar Empire's ambassador to harm him, and forecasts that because of this injustice he will find himself with a \\"manifest loss.\\" Furthermore, Bah√° ºu'll√°h compares √Çli Pasha with those who rose up against previous prophets, such as Nimrod against Abraham, Pharaoh against Moses, and the Sasanian emperor against Muhammad. Regarding √Çli Pasha's superior, Sultan Abd√ºlaziz, Bah√° ºu'll√°h prophesies that the Sultan will no longer control Adrinople: Another topic discussed in the tablet is that Bah√° ºu'll√°h glorifies his own revelation, and prophesies that it will encompass the entire earth. Regarding his revelation, he wrote: Bah√° ºu'll√°h also describes the nature of the soul. He explains that if the soul acquires spiritual qualities in this world it will move towards God. After physical death it will separate from the body and live in the worlds of God, but if the soul does not acquire spiritual attributes it will be far from God. Concerning the significance of the S√∫riy-i Ra'√≠s, Bah√° ºu'll√°h, in a later tablet, wrote that from the moment it was written, the world has been in constant tribulation and that an immense cataclysmic process has been set in motion, and he warns that only remedy is that people accept his message.Bah√° ºu'll√°h, Gleanings from the Writings of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, p. 38 Lawh-i-Ra'√≠s (Tablet of the Chief) :See online text here The Lawh-i Ra'√≠s () or \\"Tablet of the Chief\\", is also addressed to √Çli Pasha. Bah√° ºu'll√°h wrote this tablet in Persian shortly after his incarceration in Acre (August 1868) soon after the death of three of his followers. In the second tablet, to √Çli Pasha, Bah√° ºu'll√°h further rebukes √Çli Pasha for acts which Bah√° ºu'll√°h claims are cruel, and compares him to those who had opposed the prophets of the past. Bah√° ºu'll√°h states that √Çli Pasha's true motives are self, passion and power, and blames him for visiting a number of cruelties on innocent people including sending women and young children to prison. He also writes about the treatment that the Bah√° º√≠s were given when incarcerated in Acre, which he states was inhumane, including receiving no food and water, causing two deaths. Bah√° ºu'll√°h also informs √Çli Pasha that if he would change course and accept Bah√° ºu'll√°h's message, he would become transformed, but if he continues his ways God will chastise him from all directions. In this tablet Bah√° ºu'll√°h also states that while at Gallipoli he sent a message to the Sultan through a Turkish office asking for a face to face meeting where he could convey the truth of his message, and that he would be ready to produce anything the Sultan considered would be proof of the truth of his message. He stated that if in this meeting he fulfilled the Sultan's request, then the Sultan should release all the innocent prisoners. Bah√° ºu'll√°h states that the Sultan never accepted His request. Lawh-i Fu'√°d \\"Tablet of Fu'ad Pasha\\" :See online text here The Lawh-i Fu'√°d () or Tablet of Fu'√°d revealed in 1869 was addressed to SÕühaykÕüh K√°zim-i-Samandar, a native of Qazvin, and one the Apostles of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. The tablet was written in Arabic shortly after the death of Fu'√°d P√°sh√°, the foreign minister of Ottoman Empire, who was dismissed from his post in 1869 and died shortly thereafter in Nice, France. Mehmed Fuad Pasha was a close collaborator of Grand Vizir √Çli Pasha, who had exiled Bah√° ºu'll√°h to the prison city of Acre. In the tablet, Bah√° ºu'll√°h rebukes Fuad Pasha and states that God had taken his life as a punishment for inflicting suffering on Bah√° ºu'll√°h. Bah√° ºu'll√°h states that Fuad Pasha's soul will face the wrath of God in the afterlife. Bah√° ºu'll√°h in the tablet also foreshadows the downfall and the overthrow of both Sultan Abd√ºlaziz and the Grand Vizir √Çli Pasha. Soon thereafter, √Çli Pasha was dismissed from his post, and died in 1871. At this time, opposition to the Sultan started which led to his losing power in 1876, and being killed a few days later. Fulfillment of the prophecies in the Lawh-i Fu'√°d regarding the downfall of the Sultan and the Grand Vizer played an important role in the conversion of M√≠rz√° Abu'l-Fa·∏çl, one of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith's foremost scholars. Other topics discussed in the tablet include the spiritual consequences of the abuse of power as well as covenant-breaking. S√∫riy-i Mul√∫k \\"Tablet of Kings\\" :See online text here The S√∫riy-i Mul√∫k (), or the Tablet of Kings is a tablet written by Bah√° ºu'll√°h that was addressed collectively to the monarchs of the East and the West. The tablet was likely written in early 1868 in Arabic while he was in Adrianople. The tablet has three main themes: the responsibility of kings to accept his message, some general counsel for kings and rulers, and the consequences of not accepting his message. Bah√° ºu'll√°h discloses the character of his mission to the monarchs and tells them to accept his message. He states that he is the Manifestation of God for this age, and that his mission is to unite the human race. He also warns of the consequences of not following his advice. The tablet serves as a third stage of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's claim to the station of He whom God shall make manifest to the world. The first stage consisted of Bah√° ºu'll√°h telling those who accompanied him to Constantinople in the Garden of Ridv√°n; the second stage consisted of Bah√° ºu'll√°h announcing his station to all the members of the B√°b√≠ community in Adrianople through various tablets, and the final stage consisted of Bah√° ºu'll√°h proclaiming his claim to the world at large through its kings and rulers. In the tablet, Bah√° ºu'll√°h first rebukes the kings for their failure to follow the message of the B√°b, and then rebukes them further for not having accepted his own message: Bah√° ºu'll√°h also counsels the kings on the qualities which they must exhibit. These include not laying aside the Fear of God, and following the laws of religion. He states that countries should work towards reducing their differences. In this way, weapons can be reduced which would assure the safety of the world and save money for the governments which can be used for other purposes. He tells the monarchs to limit their extravagance, and instead to live in moderation, so that the burden on their citizens will be lessened, and he tells them to deal justly with everyone, especially the poor. Having counseled the rulers, Bah√° ºu'll√°h warns that if they do not follow his counsels God will chastise them from all directions. While the tablet is addressed to all the rulers of the world, he writes to some specific groups as well. To the Christians he writes that he is the return of Jesus: Bah√° ºu'll√°h also addresses Sultan Abd√ºlaziz, the only monarch addressed individually, and reproves him for entrusting the affairs of his empire to ministers whom he claims are not trustworthy. As for the ministers of the Sultan, Bah√° ºu'll√°h criticizes them for actions which he claims are power- hungry. As for the clergy of Constantinople he denounces them for not investigating Bah√° ºu'll√°h's message, and criticizes them as worshippers of \\"names\\" and lovers of leadership; he states that they are spiritually dead. To the philosophers of the world, Bah√° ºu'll√°h sends a warning to them not to become proud of their knowledge, and he states that the essence of wisdom and knowledge is the recognition of the Manifestation of God and his teachings. In a message to the French ambassador of Constantinople, Bah√° ºu'll√°h criticizes him for collaborating with the Qajar Ambassador to act against him, and claims that the ambassador was not following the teachings of Jesus Christ. As for the Qajar ambassador, Mirza Husayn Khan, Bah√° ºu'll√°h blames him for actions which Bah√° ºu'll√°h claims have caused injustice to himself.

Early life Williams was born in Utica, New York, son of publisher William Williams and wife Sophia, an elder of the First Presbyterian Church. At age 8 he was impressed by the departure to Ceylon as a printing missionary of a James Garrett who was associated with his father's printing business. He studied at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. There he assisted in the writing of a botanical manual by Senior Professor and co- founder Amos Eaton, published 1833. On graduation he was elected as a professor of the institute. China After a year's preparation, on 15 June 1833, just 21, he sailed for China to take charge of the printing press of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions at Guangdong, China. He arrived at Whampoa, Canton, aboard the Morrison on 25 October 1833. With the death of the pioneering missionary Robert Morrison the next year, he and Elijah Bridgman, who had arrived only three years ahead of Williams, were the only missionaries in the whole of China. He assisted Bridgman in the latter's Chinese Chrestomathy in the Canton Dialect, published in 1842, and Walter Medhurst in completing his English-Chinese Dictionary of 1848, two early works of Chinese lexicography. In 1837 he sailed on the Morrison to Japan. Officially this trip was to return some stranded Japanese sailors, but it was also an unsuccessful attempt to open Japan to American trade. On November 20, 1845 Williams married Sarah Walworth. From 1848 to 1851 Williams was the editor of The Chinese Repository, a leading Western journal published in China. In 1853 he was attached to Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry's expedition to Japan as an official interpreter. In 1855, Williams was appointed Secretary of the United States Legation to China. During his stay in China, he wrote A Tonic Dictionary Of The Chinese Language In The Canton Dialect (Ëã±ËèØÂàÜÈüªÊíÆË¶Å) in 1856. After years of opposition from the Chinese government, Williams was instrumental in the negotiation of the Treaty of Tientsin, which provided for the toleration of both Chinese and foreign Christians. Williams as depicted by the Japanese artist Hibata Osuke's 1854 sketches In 1860, he was appointed charg√© d'affaires for the United States in Beijing. He resigned his position on October 25, 1876, 43 years to the day that he first landed at Guangzhou in 1833. Around 1875, he completed a translation of the Book of Genesis and the Gospel of Matthew into Japanese, but the manuscripts were lost in a fire before they could be published. He returned to the United States in 1877 and became the first Professor of Chinese language and literature in the United States at Yale University. Williams was nominated as president of the American Bible Society on February 3, 1881. He died on February 16, 1884.

The film stars child actor Sabu, Conrad Veidt, John Justin, and June Duprez. It was distributed in the US and the UK by United Artists. Although produced by Alexander Korda's company London Films in London, the film was completed in California due to the outbreak of World War II. The Thief of Bagdad won the Academy Awards for Cinematography, Art Direction (Vincent Korda) and Special Effects (Lawrence W. Butler, Jack Whitney) and marks the first major use of bluescreening in film. It was also nominated for Original Music Score (Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa), the first time a British film score had been recognised at the Academy Awards. Although this production is a remake of the 1924 version, the two films have differences: the most significant is that the thief and the prince are separate characters in the 1940 version. The first portion of this version of The Thief of Bagdad is told in flashback, mimicking the style of the Arabian Nights. Plot Ahmad, the young, naive sultan of Bagdad is convinced by his evil Grand Vizier, Jaffar, to go out into the city disguised as a poor man to get to know his subjects (in the manner of his grandfather, Harun al-Rashid). Jaffar then has Ahmad thrown into a dungeon, where he meets the young thief Abu, who arranges their escape. They flee to Basra, where Ahmad meets and falls in love with the Princess (June Duprez). Jaffar journeys to Basra, for he too desires the Princess. Her father, the toy-obsessed sultan, is fascinated by the magical mechanical flying horse that Jaffar, a skilled sorcerer, offers; he agrees to the proposed marriage. Upon hearing this, the Princess, now deeply in love with Ahmad, runs away. Confronted by Ahmad, Jaffar magically blinds him and turns Abu into a dog; the spell can only be broken if Jaffar holds the Princess in his arms. The Princess is captured and sold in the slave market. She is bought secretly by Jaffar, but falls into a deep sleep from which he cannot rouse her. Ahmad is tricked by Jaffar's servant Halima into awakening the Princess. Halima then lures her onto Jaffar's ship by telling her that there is a doctor aboard who can cure Ahmad's blindness. Jaffar informs the Princess about the spell, so she allows herself to be embraced; Ahmad's sight is restored and Abu returned to human form. They pursue in a small boat, but Jaffar conjures up a storm that shipwrecks them. The Princess persuades Jaffar to return her to Basra; she tearfully implores her father not to force her into the marriage. Furious when the Sultan agrees, Jaffar presents him with another mechanical toy: the \\"Silver Maid\\", a many-armed dancing statue which stabs the Sultan to death. He then sets sail for Bagdad with the Princess. Abu awakes alone on a deserted beach and finds a bottle. When he opens it, an enormous genie appears and rewards the boy with three wishes. Abu wastes his first wish by wishing for sausages like his mother used to make. When he attempts to use his second wish to ask where Ahmad is, the genie cannot grant this, but instead flies him to the top of the highest mountain in the world, where he steals a large jewel, the All-Seeing Eye, which can show where Ahmad is. Then, for his second wish, the genie re-unites Abu with Ahmad. When Ahmad asks to see the Princess, Abu has him gaze into the All-Seeing Eye. There he sees Jaffar arranging for the Princess to inhale the fragrance of the Blue Rose of Forgetfulness, which makes her forget her love. In agony, Ahmad lashes out at Abu. During the ensuing argument, Abu unthinkingly wishes Ahmad to Bagdad. The genie, freed after granting the last wish, abandons Abu in the wilderness. Meanwhile, Ahmad appears in Jaffar's palace and is quickly captured, but the sight of him restores the Princess's memory. The furious usurper sentences them both to death. Abu, unwilling to watch further, shatters the All-Seeing Eye and is transported to the \\"land of legend\\", where he is thanked by the Old King for freeing its inhabitants. As a reward, he is given a magic crossbow and arrows and is named the king's successor. To save Ahmad, however, Abu steals the king's magic flying carpet and rushes to Ahmad's rescue. Abu's aerial arrival in Bagdad (which fulfills a prophecy cited a few times during the course of the film) sparks a revolt against Jaffar. Abu saves Ahmad, then kills the fleeing Jaffar with his crossbow. However, when Abu hears Ahmad telling the people of his plan to send Abu to school to train to become his new Grand Vizier, Abu flies away on the carpet to find fun and adventure.

Essentially behind Berger's back, British director Michael Powell was brought in to shoot various scenes‚Äîand Powell's scheduled work grew in amount and importance whilst, in the meantime, Korda himself did his best to undercut Berger on his own set; and while publicly siding with Berger on the issue of the music, he also undercut Berger's chosen composer (Oscar Straus) by bringing in Miklos Rozsa and putting him into an office directly adjacent to Berger's with a piano, to work on a score. Eventually, Berger was persuaded to walk away from the project, and American filmmaker Tim Whelan, who had just finished work on another Korda-produced movie (Q Planes) was brought in to help augment Powell's work. However, work was suspended with the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, for Powell was taken off the picture and put to work on a morale-boosting documentary, The Lion Has Wings. By the end of the year, Korda found himself running out of money and credit, and in the spring of 1940 he arranged to move the entire production to Hollywood (where some shots of the movie's young star Sabu had to be redone, for he had grown more than during the year since shooting had commenced). Powell had remained in England, and so direction was taken up in Hollywood by Menzies and Zoltan Korda during the summer of 1940‚Äîincluding shots of the heroes in the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, Bryce Canyon and the Painted Desert; the scenes in the Temple of the Goddess of Light, among the very last to be written, were done late in the summer, and the film was being edited and re-structured into the fall of 1940. Reception \\"Dashing, dazzling, and altogether magical, The Thief of Bagdad is an enchanting fantasy for children of all ages\\".The film was Korda's most successful in the US. The film was also a success in Europe selling 5,135,145 tickets in France becoming the seventh most attended film of the year. The New York Times reviewer Bosley Crowther enthused that the film \\"ranks next to Fantasia as the most beguiling and wondrous film of this troubled season\\". Crowther praised \\"its truly magnificent color\\" and the performances of all five main actors. Roger Ebert added The Thief of Bagdad to his \\"Great Movies\\" list, calling it \\"on a level with The Wizard of Oz\\". According to Ebert, \\"it maintains a consistent spirit, and that spirit is one of headlong joy in storytelling\\". He praised the performances of Sabu and Veidt (\\"perfectly pitched to the needs of the screenplay\\"), though he was less impressed with the chemistry between Duprez and Justin (\\"rather bloodless\\"). While its 1924 predecessor holds a 96% \\"fresh\\" rating from the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the 1940 Thief of Bagdad has a 100% rating based on 26 reviews, with an average score of 8.82/10. Its consensus states, \\"Dashing, dazzling, and altogether magical, The Thief of Bagdad is an enchanting fantasy for children of all ages\\". Influence Although it was a remake of a 1924 silent film starring Douglas Fairbanks, this film has been highly influential on later movies based on The Book of One Thousand and One Nights setting. For example, the Disney film Aladdin borrows freely from it, particularly the characters of the evil Vizier and the Sultan, both drawn with a marked similarity to the characters in The Thief of Bagdad. The villain Jafar is named after Jaffar, himself named after the historical (but not evil) vizier Ja'far ibn Yahya, who served Harun ar-Rashid. Like the sultan of the earlier film, Disney's Sultan is obsessed with toys. The thieving monkey Abu in the Disney cartoon is based on the boy played by Sabu.An episode from Aladdin: The Series also uses the Rose of Forgetfulness in the episode \\"Forget me Lots\\". Foster on Film ‚Äì Fantasy: The Thief of Bagdad Richard Williams, speaking about his film The Thief and the Cobbler, said that one of his interests was in creating an Oriental fantasy that did not copy from it. The Prince of Persia video game franchise also shares similar characteristics with the film.Jordan Mechner mentions that the Prince of Persia was \\"inspired by the Thousand and One Nights and by movies like the 1940 Thief of Bagdad in which an evil grand vizier has seized power and imprisoned the princess.\\" Larry Butler invented the first proper chroma key process for the special effects scenes in this film, a variation on the existing \\"traveling matte\\" process. This technique has since become the standard process for separating screen elements and/or actors from their backgrounds and placing them on new backgrounds for special effects purposes, and has since been used in thousands of films. This film later influenced the creation of the Malay film Abu Hassan Penchuri (\\"Abu Hassan the Thief\\", 1955) which was based in Baghdad. Home media The film was released on VHS by The Samuel Goldwyn Company. The film was released on DVD by MGM in 2002. The Criterion Collection released a two- disc DVD release in 2008 that includes a commentary track by filmmakers Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola, who are both longtime fans of the film (their comments were recorded separately and then edited together). It has been released on Region B-locked Blu-rays in Germany (Anolis Entertainment, 2012) and the UK (Network Distributing, 2015). The UK disc also includes image galleries and the original theatrical trailer. The German disc features the same extras, plus additional trailers, an audio commentary and a 53-minute documentary on the film's star, Sabu.

(Girls attended Marymount College.) The school's original campus was located on Pine Street in the city's west end. In the early 1980s, enrolment so exceeded the school's capacity that a second campus, located in the former St. Hubert School on Travers Street in the West-End neighbourhood, was launched for Grade 9 students. The school also used the site of the former Coll√®ge Sacr√©-Coeur on Notre-Dame Avenue. In 1986, the Catholic and public school boards traded redundant buildings and St. Charles College moved to a new campus in Garson, the site of the former Garson-Falconbridge Secondary School. In 1993, the boards traded buildings again, and the school moved to its present campus. At that time, the school also became co-educational, admitting female students for the first time. Renovations took place during 2014 and are now completed as of September 2015. Renovations included the new main office extension, cafeteria, and grade 7/8 classrooms/hallway. The school is known for its dominant sports teams such as Cards hockey, soccer, football, golf, and many more. The school is also known for its superior arts department. The arts department puts on three high quality performances for the public every year. Starting with its annual Christmas concert, musical production in May, and its spring concert. The school mascot is a cardinal and is a reference to the cardinals of the Vatican. In 2015, a Catholic priest complained about the prominence of the Cardinal logo on the building and the school board quietly decided to remove the sign from its prominent position. This has yet to be done, as there is little support in the community for such a move and the sign is symbol of pride among students and staff. On April 30, 2020, the Canadian Supreme Court rejected an appeal from the Basilian Fathers of Toronto to deny payment of nearly $2.5 million including $500,000 in punitive damages, to sex abuse victim Rod MacLeod.https://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/glad-he-is- gone-says-victim-as-pedophile-priest-hod-marshall-passes-away-at-92/ MacLeod, who was previously awarded this compensation by a jury in April 2018,https://www.sudbury.com/local-news/victim-of-abuse-by-sudbury-priest- awarded-25m-907564 was sexually abused by former St. Charles teacher Father William Hodgson Marshall.https://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/glad-he-is- gone-says-victim-as-pedophile-priest-hod-marshall-passes-away-at-92/ when he was a student at St. Charles in the 1960s.

The game could be considered a reverse form of dodgeball, because instead of trying to hit people in the middle with the ball, players attempt to keep the ball away from him or her. The game is played worldwide.  Rules  Keep Away is played by drawing a circle on the ground about ten feet in diameter. One person stands in the center (and is called it,the ‚Äòmonkey‚Äô the piggy, or the pickle) and the rest stand outside the circle. A player outside the circle must then throw the ball through the circle to another person outside the circle with the goal being to prevent the person who is it from getting to the ball. This continues until the person who is it catches the ball or otherwise gains possession due to a failed catch, deflection, etc. An intended recipient who fails to catch the ball replaces the person in the middle, unless they fail before the ball touches any part of their body. The ball cannot be torn out of any of the player's hands.  Variations  Like other children's games, this game has many variations to shape it in the manner they like to play. Some common variations are: * Playing with a larger area and the person who is it only has to touch the ball instead of catch it. * The ball must bounce at least once in the circle on a pass to prevent high lobbing passes which can give taller children an unfair advantage. * When the person who is it catches the ball, they must get outside the circle with the ball without getting tagged by the thrower to make them it. * The person outside the circle to last touch the ball becomes it instead of the last thrower. Thus the person who failed to catch the ball is it instead of the thrower. * People with the ball outside the circle cannot move until they throw it. * None of the people outside the circle can move around and must throw and catch from a constant position. * The people outside the circle must throw it within a certain amount of time, usually five seconds. This keeps the pace of the game high and prevents players from hogging the ball. * Playing with larger areas with multiple people being it and even multiple balls. * There isn't a circle; sometimes the one who is it tries to catch the ball while other players tackle the ball and pass to each other. * Similar to a Pickle, or \\"Rundown\\" in a game of baseball, two basemen throw a ball back and forth. A third player who is it remains safely touching a base, until they decides to make a play (run) for the other base. Either of the two basemen must physically tag the runner with the ball in hand to count the runner out. This is done by tossing the ball back and forth between the basemen, forcing the runner to change direction, while the basemen close the distance to the runner, until either the runner is safe at a base, or successfully tagged. When successfully tagged, the runner and the baseman exchange places, and the game continues. * When the \\"it\\" player catches the ball, then drops the ball, then the two other players can tackle the \\"it\\" person, or the it person can tackle the two other players to prevent them from getting the ball. You can also play this variation with basic American football rules and you could play with an American football.  Naming  The name of the game varies with region. In the United States, the descriptive name Keep Away seems to prevail, while Canadian children commonly call the game either Pig in the Middle (Western Canada) or Monkey in the Middle (Eastern Canada, parts of New England, and parts of the Midwest). In the UK, Australia and New Zealand the name Piggy in the Middle is used (almost) exclusively. The game is also common in German, called \\"Dummer Hans\\" (Silly John), in Turkey under a name which translates to Rat in the Middle, in Denmark where it is known as what translates into Butter blob, in the Netherlands they call it \\"Lummelen\\" or, less commonly, \\"Aap in het Midden\\" [lit: \\"Monkey in the Middle\\"] and Silly Johnny in Poland. In Egypt, the name of the game translates as The Indecisive Dog. Also in Iran, the name \\"Vasati\\" is used. In Greece, it is called \\"koroido\\" which translates into \\"sucker\\". In NYC it is also called \\"Saloojee\\" While the name Keep Away is self-explanatory, the origin of some of the other titles are less clear. Monkey in the Middle is likely to have arisen because the middle player jumps and waves his arms around like a monkey or ape. The names Piggy in the Middle and Pickle in a Dish are of unknown derivation. \\"Pickle in the middle\\" derives from the game of baseball. When the base runner is caught off base between two opposing players, one of whom has the ball, he is \\"in a pickle\\".  Other meanings  In America, the term pig in the middle is sometimes used as slang for being under pressure from both sides of a dispute. The similar term piggy in the middle means the same in the United Kingdom.  Appearances in media  *The British rock band The Rutles, featuring Eric Idle, released a single called \\"Piggy in the Middle\\", which is featured in the 1978 documentary film All You Need is Cash. *In The Adventures of Spot episode \\"Spot Goes to the Park\\", Spot and his friends play Monkey in the Middle. *In the Dexter's Laboratory episode \\"The Bus Boy\\", Gwen takes Dexter's pencil out of his shirt pocket and plays \\"Keep Away\\" with Becky. *In the Rugrats episode \\"Touchdown Tommy\\", Angelica Pickles plays Keep Away with the babies using a bottle of chocolate milk to pass from baby to baby, while Angelica is the person in the middle that is trying to grab the bottle of chocolate milk to drink. *In the video game Mario Party for the Nintendo 64, there is a mini-game called \\"Key-Pa-Way\\" where players have to keep a key away from mechanical enemies. *In the guide to daydreaming on Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide, Billy Loomer and Jerry Crony play \\"Keep Away\\" with Susan Crabgrass's bookbag. *In the Monk episode \\"Mr. Monk and the Election\\", Adrian reveals that he played a lot of \\"Keep Away\\" in middle school. Later, he solves the episode's murder investigation while playing keep away with Natalie's car keys. *in CONQUEST: The Chronicles of the Invaders, by John Connolly and Jennifer Ridyard, Ch. 57, people who need to bathe in a loch are playing piggy-in-the-middle with a bar of wet soap. *The Finnish metal band Waltari has a song called \\"Piggy in the Middle\\" off of their album So Fine!. *In the movie The Sandlot, the kids play pickle in the middle and Benny \\"pickles\\" the Beast to retrieve an autographed baseball.

The earliest civil disturbances were actions by the local indigenous population dealing with European settlers. Demonstrations and protests are linked to a range of issues over time. In the convict era, there were collective actions by convicts. Organised labour had to deal with issues on the Goldfields in the 1890s and 1900s with demonstrations and protest actions, while in Perth these occurred in the 1960s and 1970s over war and race issues. There are some incidents in the 19th century where the causes are less clear. A restricted press and limited means of some groups to gain avenues to express their grievances in a dominated society, means that some disturbances were suppressed literally and disguised in the public record. In some cases some smaller disturbances (alcohol-related fights) in the Goldfields (Kalgoorlie, Boulder and Coolgardie for instance) would not be considered full-scale riots, but nonetheless the charges found either in newspaper or police records would suggest a significance beyond a simple incidence of drunken behaviour.

It was founded in 1893 and closed in 1997 because of financial problems and mismanagement. All together Bremer Vulkan built about 1100 ships‚Äîincluding the ships of the predecessor Johann Lange Shipyard‚Äîof different types. It is remarkable that the Bremer Vulkan, with the exception of both World Wars, only built civilian ships; production of naval ships except during wartime first started in the 1980s. History Bremer Vulkan AG was founded 1893 in Vegesack-a suburb of the city of Bremen‚Äìby a group of investors and Bremen merchants and by overtaking the 1805 founded Johann Lange Shipyard. Two years later the Bremer Vulkan bought the Bremer Schiffbaugesellschaft ‚Äì former H. F. Ulrichs Shipyard which launched the first ship in 1839 - including all its modern shipbuilding facilities. The first director of the Bremer Vulkan became the engineer Victor Nawatzki (1855‚Äì1940). In the following years the Bremer Vulkan increased rapidly. By 1908 it covered an area of about and a water frontage of . Six slips equipped with modern electric travelling cranes were capable of building the largest vessels of that time. With an average annual delivery of about 40000 BRT it became the greatest civilian shipbuilding company in the German Empire, followed by Flensburger Schiffbaubetriebe in Flensburg, Joh. C. Tecklenborg in Bremerhaven and Vulcan Stettin in Stettin. The number of co-workers had increased from about 60 at the beginning up to about 3,300 in 1912. During World War I the Bremer Vulkan built warships. All together 11 minesweepers (M 39‚ÄìM 42 and M 54‚ÄìM 56, M 71‚ÄìM 74) and in cooperation with the Germaniawerft in Kiel some submarine hulls and 6 complete submarines (U-160‚ÄìU-163) were built for the Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial German Navy). After the war Bremer Vulkan continued its successful development. Different types of ships were built first mainly for German ship owners and with an increasing amount also for foreign ship owners later. An important progress was the change of ship propulsion from steam engines to diesel engines. In cooperation and under licence from MAN the Bremer Vulkan started the production of diesel ship- engines. During World War II, 74 different Type VII U-boats were constructed for the Kriegsmarine. The Vulkan facility was several times target of the bombing of Bremen in World War II. The greatest bombing attack happened in March 1943 by the US Air Force. By the so-called \\"precise bombing\\" many buildings and U-boats under construction as well as surrounding private buildings were destroyed or damaged. 116 people were killed and additional 118 injured. Despite the great destruction, production of U-boats could be continued within a few weeks. During the war about downstream from the BV- shipyard between the Bremen suburbs and Farge the submarine bunker Valentin was under construction. Here under management of the BV and beginning end of 1945 monthly 15 U-boats should be assembled from prefabricated sections. Those were delivered from the following shipyards Bremer Vulkan AG, Deschimag AG Weser in Bremen, Deschimag Seebeck AG in Bremerhaven and Blohm + Voss in Hamburg. However, the bunker was not finished before the end of the war and no U-boats were ever built there. The building itself still exists today and is partly used as a memorial to the many forced labourers from nearby concentration camps who worked and died there during construction of the bunker. Dr. Robert Kabelac ‚Äì director of the BV from 1935 to 1960 ‚Äì managed to avoid the dismantling of the BV after war as this happened to most other German shipyards. The company was allowed to resume shipbuilding already in 1949. Production could soon be continued, starting with repair of ships and locomotives and the construction of fishing vessels. Soon later the shipbuilding programme was enlarged and various types of ships were offered to the market as container/multi purpose cargo ships, passenger liners, passenger-cargo vessels, roll-on/roll-off ships, LNG and LPG tankers, supply ships, special-purpose ships, reefer vessels and others. By the end of the 1970s the BV became a world leader in container delivered capacity and in innovative container ship design. Beginning in the 1980s for the first time except wartimes of course also naval ships were built. As the general contractor the BV started in cooperation with other German shipbuilding companies the construction of frigates for the German Navy. In the 1980s the BV merged with other German shipbuilding companies and became the largest shipbuilding company in Germany. The new Bremer Vulkan Verbund AG or the so- called Vulkan Group consisted of the following divisions at that time:1 Division Shipbuilding, including the seven German shipyards Bremer Vulkan Werft (Bremen-Vegesack), Geeste Metallbau GmbH (Bremen), Flender Werft (L√ºbeck), Lloyd Werft, Rickmers Lloyd Dockbetrieb GmbH, Schichau Seebeckwerft (all in Bremerhaven) and Neue Jadewerft (Wilhelmshaven) Division Naval Shipbuilding Division Industry Division Electronic and Systems Technology Division Services After the German reunification in 1990 the Vulkan Group was enlarged by the Division Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, including the east German shipyards Matthias-Thesen Werft in Wismar and Volkswerft Stralsund in Stralsund. At that time Vulkan Group included all together about 22,000 co- workers in Germany, of that about 18,000 in the shipbuilding divisions. After 1996 bankruptcy because of financial problems and mismanagement, Bremer Vulkan closed the shipyard in Vegesack in 1997.

It began broadcasting in 1991. Earth & Sky was the creation of producers Deborah Byrd and Joel Block, who were also the hosts. Byrd had previously created the radio program Star Date that began broadcasting in the US in 1978, and Block was Star Date's original host. Earth & Sky presented 60- and 90-second radio spots (called \\"modules\\") on a wide variety of scientific topics, communicating through terrestrial radio as well as satellite radio and internet radio. Earth & Sky was aired one or more times daily on more than 1,000 commercial, NPR, and other public radio stations, 80 affiliate stations for the sight-impaired, and across 35 channels on both XM and Sirius satellite radio in the United States. Abroad, the programming iwas heard on American Forces Radio, Voice of America Radio, World Radio Network, and others. The information on Earth & Sky came directly from scientists. The journalists who produced the Earth & Sky radio program spoke to several scientists each day, dozens each week and hundreds each year. More than 500 scientists had joined Earth & Sky as volunteer advisers. Earth & Sky science advisers suggested content, gave feedback, recommended other experts, and reviewed scripts for accuracy before they were recorded for broadcast. Earth & Sky featured many fields of science. In 2006, it focused was on nanotechnology, women in science, observing the Earth, astrophysics and space, and the human world. The final episode of Earth & Sky was broadcast on June 2, 2013. President and co-founder Deborah Byrd said that although funding options existed to continue the radio program, a decision was made to stop producing the radio show in order to concentrate on the EarthSky.org website and social media.

Life and work Born in Berlin, Wolfram von Soden was a gifted student of the ancient Semitic languages who studied under the Jewish Assyriologist, Benno Landsberger at Leipzig. He received his doctorate in 1931 at age 23 with his thesis Der hymnisch-epische Dialekt des Akkadischen (The Hymnic-Epic Dialect of Akkadian). In 1936, he was appointed a professor of Assyriology and Arabic studies, a new position at the University of G√∂ttingen. While his mentor, Landsberger, was obliged to leave Germany due to National- Socialist racial policy, von Soden joined the Sturmabteilung in 1934. An ardent German nationalist, he never joined the NSDAP--the Nazi Party. Nonetheless, in 1944 the SA and its members were compulsorily integrated into the NSDAP, a fact that has led to certain American detractors portraying von Soden as a Nazi and anti-Semite, despite his personal ties to Landsberger. From 1939 to 1945, von Soden served in the military, primarily as a translator, and in 1940 this work prevented him accepting the offer of a chair in Ancient Near Eastern studies at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin. Von Soden published works that implicitly supported Nazi cultural and racial policy. Following the Second World War, von Soden's former activities as an involuntary member of the Nazi Party initially barred his reentry to the teaching profession. Because of his extraordinary abilities, however, and thanks to his Doktorvater, Benno Landsberger, who wrote in his support, von Soden was appointed to an academic position at the University of Vienna in 1954. In 1961, he accepted the offer of a professorship at M√ºnster, where he served as director of the Oriental Seminar until his retirement in 1976. At his death in 1996, he left his scholarly library to the newly revived Institute for Near Eastern Studies at the University of Leipzig, where he had earned his doctorate. Scholarship After World War II, von Soden became a prominent scholar in the world in ancient Semitic languages, and his scholarship greatly influenced his field the post World War II era. He was an integral member of the \\"history of religions\\" (Religionsgeschichte) school at Goettingen, and disproved the long-standing claim that the Babylonians had believed in their creator god, Marduk, as a \\"dying, rising god\\". Instead, he was able to show that the texts that purveyed this view were polemical Assyrian works deriding the chief god of their chief rival state. Von Soden's philological works, particularly the Akkadisches Handw√∂rterbuch (AHW), in which the Dutch scholar Rykle Borger assisted, laid the basis for the detailed philological contributions that later appeared in the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary. His Grundriss Akkadischer Grammatik (GAG) and the AHW remain the definitive foundational works of Assyriology today and establish von Soden as the dean of ancient Near Eastern Studies in the world. Charges that his work promoted the Nazi ideology primarily by denigrating Semitic cultural influences in the ancient Near East in favor of Indo-European or ‚ÄúIndo- Germanic‚Äù cultures, are refuted by his detailed work on the history and languages of the ancient Semitic peoples in his Einf√ºhrung in die Altorientalistik, translated into English by Dr. Donald G. Schley and published by Eerdmans in 1994 as The Ancient Orient: An Introduction to the Study of the Ancient Near East. So far was von Soden from a Nazi outlook that he made substantial contributions to Old Testament philology and history. Earlier works included Der Aufstieg des Assyrerreichs als geschichtliches Problem (1937, The Rise of the Assyrian Empire as an Historical Problem) and Arabische wehrsprachliche Ausdr√ºcke (1942, Arabic Military Terminology and Expressions). His Einf√ºhrung in die Altorientalistik contains an account of the sub-Saharan African origins of humanity and the dissemination of languages therefrom.

When the estimate is first calculated by sell-side analysts, the number is submitted to companies such as First Call to be averaged with other analysts' estimates for the consensus earnings estimate. As new information is made available and plugged into the spreadsheet, the calculation may change several times leading up to a company's actual earnings release. However, the analyst is generally not going to issue a new report and revise his or her published estimate with each new calculation, resulting in the analyst's true expectations differing from his or her published number. Therefore, when someone within the firm, an institutional client, or even a retail client asks the analyst his or her expectation for the company, the response is often different from the published estimate. This number then gets passed among trading desks and professional traders as the whisper number. Because the whisper number is the analysts' true expectation, it tends to be more accurate than the officially published consensus estimates. The Wall Street Journal found one website that gathers whisper numbers from research analysts and a Bloomberg News study found these same numbers to miss actual reported earnings by 21% while the officially published consensus earnings estimates missed actual results by an average of 44%. Furthermore, a joint study by the universities of Michigan, Indiana, and Purdue also found that whisper numbers were more effective at predicting actual earnings results than the consensus earnings estimates. Consequently, stocks have been shown to react to whisper numbers more so than the consensus earnings estimates. A 2002 research report found that stocks of companies that beat the whisper number had an average one day gain of more than 2% while the stocks of companies that beat the consensus earnings estimate but missed the whisper number gained approximately one-tenth of one percent on the first day of trading. Furthermore, the joint academic study found that a trading strategy based on whisper numbers either before the company's earnings release or after the actual report \\"significantly\\" outperformed the S&P; 500\\\\. In one example, Deckers Outdoor (DECK) reported earnings of $2.69 per share after the market closed on Thursday, February 28, 2008 and provided 2008 earnings guidance above the consensus estimates. The reported results were $0.35 per share above the consensus earnings estimate of $2.34 per share. A number of analysts had indicated in the days and weeks leading up to its earnings release that they expected the company to beat estimates and the Earnings Whisper (R) number was $2.70 per share. The stock gained more than $10 during the two weeks heading into the company's earnings release at least in part due to the expectations of the upside surprise, but on Friday, February 29, 2008, shares of Deckers Outdoor traded down approximately $10 after missing the whisper number by a penny.

(Infants: 0-1 year of age & Toddlers: 1‚Äì2 years of age). A preschool teacher provides care to children aged 2‚Äì4 years old within unlicensed childcare centres, licensed childcare centres, home based child care and after school programs. (*See the definition for ‚ÄúChildcare‚Äù on Wikipedia for further insight and understanding.) Attendance for children in Preschool is not mandated as it is not a publicly funded educational program accessible to all. There are costs involved and usually sought after by working parents until the child reaches school age. Some jurisdictions have implemented an Act aimed towards regulating childcare and bring cohesiveness to the field of childcare. Legislation provides a framework for the regulation of child care programs, including training requirements for staff, health and safety standards, staff-child ratios, space requirements, nutritional standards, and access to outdoors. Preschool teachers ensure the safety of the children in their care while creating a nurturing setting for children to develop their cognitive, social and emotional skills. Childcare settings also provide routines and structure in preparation for children‚Äôs future academic success once children age out of day-time child care and enters the elementary education system, either publicly funded or private system. system. ‚ÄúPreschool teachers‚Äù are also employed to care for children ages 5‚Äì12 years in an after school care setting. Licensing and qualifications for ‚Äúpreschool teachers‚Äù vary based on regions/countries. It is recommended (but not mandated) for ‚Äúpreschool teachers‚Äù to have post-secondary education (preferably in early years development). Some programs are accredited from a regulated and approved Institution while others are from private sector educational institutions. As the field of Child Care is evolving, it is recommended to check the legislation in your area for accurate and up-to-date information on policies, regulations and qualification requirements. Dependant upon the legislation in geographical areas, preschool teachers may require a license from their regulatory body the form of a Child Development Accreditation (CDA) or formal college education in early childhood or a related subject. The term \\"preschool\\" refers to instruction in non-public arenas such as licensed preschools, childcare centers, family day care centers, home day care centers, center-based programs, federal programs like Head Start, and full or part-day private child centers or day care centers sponsored by religious bodies. Preschool teachers must be able to work well and interact with young children, sometimes as young as 2 years 9 months. Preschool children have a short attention span and their worries are usually fairly simple. Most preschoolers are loving, affectionate, and playful, and like to play games, be read to, or play with toys. Therefore the Diploma programs provide an introduction into the stages of development and offers those who study this program insight into whether children are adequately developing as expected but do not provide qualifications for diagnosing children who are deemed exceptional.

Hut 8, by contrast, attacked Naval Enigma. Hut 6 was established at the initiative of Gordon Welchman, and was run initially by Welchman and fellow Cambridge mathematician John Jeffreys. Welchman's deputy, Stuart Milner-Barry, succeeded Welchman as head of Hut 6 in September 1943, at which point over 450 people were working in the section.Ralph Erskine, Barry, Sir (Philip) Stuart Milner- (1906‚Äì1995), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 2004. Hut 6 was partnered with Hut 3, which handled the translation and intelligence analysis of the raw decrypts provided by Hut 6. Location Hut 6 was originally named after the building in which the section was located. Welchman says the hut was 20 yards (18m) long by 10 yards (9m) wide, with two large rooms at the far end ‚Äì and no toilets. Staff had to go to another building. Irene Young recalled that she \\"worked in Room 82, though in typical Bletchley fashion there were not eighty-one rooms preceding it\\". She was glad to move from the Decoding Room \\"where all the operators were constantly having nervous breakdowns on account of the pace of work and the appalling noise\\" to the Registration Room which arranged intercepts according to callsign and frequency Young (1990) p 74 As the number of personnel increased, the section moved to additional buildings around Bletchley Park, but its name was retained, with each new location also being known as 'Hut 6'. The original building was then renamed 'Hut 16'. Personnel John Jeffreys was initially in charge of the Hut with Gordon Welchman until May 1940; Jeffreys was diagnosed ill in 1940, and died in 1944. Welchman became official head of section until autumn 1943, subsequently rising to Assistant Director of Mechanisation at Bletchley Park. Hugh Alexander, was a member February 1940 ‚Äì March 1941 before moving to become head of Hut 8. Stuart Milner-Barry joined early 1940 and was in charge from autumn 1943 to the end of the war. One codebreaker concerned with Cryptanalysis of the Enigma, John Herivel, discovered what was soon dubbed the Herivel tip or Herivelismus. For a brief but critical few months from May 1940, the \\"tip\\", in conjunction with operating shortcomings or \\"cillies\\", were the main techniques used to solve Enigma. The \\"tip\\" was an insight into the habits of the German machine operators allowing Hut 6 to easily deduce part of the daily key. In 1942, Welchman recruited fellow Marlborough Collegers, Bob Roseveare and Nigel Forward. Roseveare started in the Watch working on Luftwaffe messages before moving to the Quatch, a small backroom group that decoded non-current messages. In Hut 6 were the Machine Room, plus the Decoding Room and Registration Room with mainly female staff under Harold Fletcher, a school and university friend of Gordon Welchman.Briggs (2011), p 84-85Welchman (1982) p 103-4 In 2014 one of these female staff, Mair Russell- Jones, published a posthumous memoir of her work there.Robin Turner, \\"Bletchley Park uncovered: The secret life of the Welsh World War II codebreaker\\", Wales Online, July 27, 2014.

Just as processes that produce a product may vary, the process of obtaining measurements and data may also have variation and produce incorrect results. A measurement systems analysis evaluates the test method, measuring instruments, and the entire process of obtaining measurements to ensure the integrity of data used for analysis (usually quality analysis) and to understand the implications of measurement error for decisions made about a product or process. MSA is an important element of Six Sigma methodology and of other quality management systems. MSA analyzes the collection of equipment, operations, procedures, software and personnel that affects the assignment of a number to a measurement characteristic. A measurement systems analysis considers the following: * Selecting the correct measurement and approach * Assessing the measuring device * Assessing procedures and operators * Assessing any measurement interactions * Calculating the measurement uncertainty of individual measurement devices and/or measurement systems Common tools and techniques of measurement systems analysis include: calibration studies, fixed effect ANOVA, components of variance, attribute gage study, gage R&R;, ANOVA gage R&R;, and destructive testing analysis. The tool selected is usually determined by characteristics of the measurement system itself. An introduction to MSA can be found in chapter 8 of Doug Montgomery's Quality Control book. These tools and techniques are also described in the books by Donald Wheeler and Kim Niles. Advanced procedures for designing MSA studies can be found in Burdick et. al. Equipment: measuring instrument, calibration, fixturing. * People: operators, training, education, skill, care. * Process: test method, specification. * Samples: materials, items to be tested (sometimes called \\"parts\\"), sampling plan, sample preparation. * Environment: temperature, humidity, conditioning, pre- conditioning. * Management: training programs, metrology system, support of people, support of quality management system. These can be plotted in a \\"fishbone\\" Ishikawa diagram to help identify potential sources of measurement variation. Goals The goals of a MSA are: # Quantification of measurement uncertainty, including the accuracy, precision including repeatability and reproducibility, the stability and linearity of these quantities over time and across the intended range of use of the measurement process. # Development of improvement plans, when needed. # Decision about whether a measurement process is adequate for a specific engineering/manufacturing application. ASTM Procedures The ASTM has several procedures for evaluating measurement systems and test methods, including: * ASTM E2782 - Standard Guide for Measurement Systems Analysis * ASTM D4356 - Standard Practice for Establishing Consistent Test Method Tolerances * ASTM E691 - Standard Practice for Conducting an Interlaboratory Study to Determine the Precision of a Test Method * ASTM E1169 - Standard Guide for Conducting Ruggedness Tests * ASTM E1488 - Standard Guide for Statistical Procedures to Use in Developing and Applying Test Methods ASME Procedures The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) has several procedures and reports targeted at task-specific uncertainty budgeting and methods for utilizing those uncertainty estimates when evaluating the measurand for compliance to specification. They are: * B89.7.3.1 - 2001 Guidelines for Decision Rules: Considering Measurement Uncertainty Determining Conformance to Specifications * B89.7.3.2 - 2007 Guidelines for the Evaluation of Dimensional Measurement Uncertainty (Technical Report) * B89.7.3.3 - 2002 Guidelines for Assessing the Reliability of Dimensional Measurement Uncertainty Statements AIAG Procedures The Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG), a non-profit association of automotive companies, has documented a recommended measurement systems analysis procedure in their MSA manual.

It was first broadcast by Granada TV for ITV in 1999, following a pilot in 1997, and concluded in 2001 after three series. The show was written by Jed Mercurio, who had trained as a doctor and whose first series, Cardiac Arrest - written under the pseudonym 'John MacUre' - had attracted critical plaudits for its dark portrayal of life in a disintegrating British National Health Service. The filming of the school took place in Salford, Buile Hill High, Hope High, and Pendleton College, and the characters' homes were filmed in Langley.Dudley Chronicle, 15 May 1998 Later series featured location filming in Dudley, including a scene at Dudley Zoo.  Premise  The Grimleys follows the ups and downs of the dysfunctional Grimley family in their struggles with everyday life. Gordon Grimley (James Bradshaw) is an intellectual but feeble schoolboy who has a crush on his teacher, Miss Geraldine Titley (Amanda Holden; Samantha Janus in the pilot). His younger brother Darren (Ryan Cartwright), who also narrates the storyline and sets the scene, is fond of Gordon and sympathetic to his unrequited love for Miss Titley, but is frustrated by his brother's fey personality and his nickname, \\"The School Spanner\\". Their father Baz (Nigel Planer) was a bone- idle British Leyland car worker, who injured his back on his first day at the Longbridge plant and went on strike on the second. He has not moved from his armchair since then and spends his days watching television. He is particularly infuriated by Gordon's artistic leanings and is determined that he should do \\"a man's job\\" rather than go to university, unlike their hard- working mother Janet (Jan Ravens). Other domestic characters are their older sister Lisa Grimley (Corrieann Fletcher) and their Nan (Barbara Keogh), who seems to be obsessed with the \\"Grimley curse\\". The Grimleys' next-door neighbours are the Titleys, consisting of Geraldine, plumber uncle Reg (Paul Angelis) and his son Shane (Simon Lowe), a Bay City Roller lookalike and self- styled ladies' man with a clapped-out Vauxhall Viva car. To complicate matters further, Shane is dating Lisa, and Janet and Reg carry obvious torches for each other. Reg's sensitivity and surprisingly poetic tongue give rise to a question mark over Gordon Grimley's parentage, as does Shane Titley's oafish behaviour and idolisation of Baz Grimley. Many of the scenes are set in the Grimley brothers' school, alongside their sadistic PE teacher Doug \\"Dynamo\\" Digby (Brian Conley; Jack Dee in the pilot), who lives in a corner of the school gymnasium. Doug always takes both pride and pleasure in bullying his pupils, perhaps due to the behaviour of his thuggish father (Lewis Collins). Doug is dating Geraldine Titley, much to Gordon Grimley's chagrin, leading to increasing tensions between them. Also present is Amazonian gym mistress called Miss Thing (Ruby Snape), whom Digby seems to fancy. The show also stars Noddy Holder, the former lead singer of Slade, in the role of music teacher Neville Holder (his own real name), and there are a number of cameos including one by the glam rock singer Alvin Stardust as a pub landlord. This leads to a series of in jokes, such as Holder and Stardust bemoaning the lost opportunities of their youth over a pint of beer, and Holder's character being described as \\"not exactly Mr Rock 'n' Roll\\". Other guest stars were Bamber Gascoigne as the school's headmaster; Johnny Ball as a maths teacher in another school; Michael Cronin as \\"Bullet\\" Baxter (the role that he had played in Grange Hill); William Woollard as science teacher Mr Woollard; Elizabeth Berrington as a school inspector; Ron Atkinson as the manager of an opposing football team; Stephen Lewis playing a coach driver very similar to his character Inspector Blake in On The Buses; Jim Bowen as a militant trade unionist; and Pam Ayres as herself.  Series 3 changes  Series one and two features the same regular cast and runs in a continuous time frame, while series three is set later in the 1970s. Doug Digby's character is killed off in a gym accident in the first episode of the third series, and he is replaced in Geraldine Titley's affections by the scheming, manipulative woodwork teacher Dave Trebilcock (pronounced \\"Trebilco\\"), played by Craig Kelly. Geraldine has spent the time between the second and third series in a coma, which allows the series to shift its focus from the glam rock era to the punk era. Gordon is now working as a trainee teacher at the school, where he is bullied and insulted by the pupils, many of whom, including his brother, Darren, are dressed as punks. Their mother, meanwhile, has walked out on her husband and taken up with Neville Holder, who has now become the school's headmaster, leaving Gordon as the family's sole breadwinner.  Music  The theme music of the first series is \\"Bye Bye Baby\\" by the Bay City Rollers over the title credits and either \\"Mama Weer All Crazee Now\\" or \\"Cum On Feel the Noize\\", both by Slade, over the end credits. Noddy Holder performs an acoustic version of \\"Cum On Feel the Noize\\" over the end credits of the episode \\"The Road Not Taken\\". In the second series the end title credits vary between \\"Cum On Feel the Noize\\", \\"How Does It Feel?\\" and \\"Everyday\\", also by Slade. Holder performs an alternative Easter version of \\"Merry Xmas Everybody\\" during the episode \\"???\\", mimes \\"How Does It Feel?\\" on a piano in the episode \\"The Bionic Boy\\" and performs an acoustic version of \\"'Coz I Luv You\\" over the end credits of the Series 2 finale, \\"The Prime of Mr Doug Digby\\". \\"Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn't've)\\" by the Buzzcocks is the theme music of the third series, which also features the song \\"Jilted John\\" by Jilted John (Graham Fellows) with its refrain \\"Gordon is a moron\\" for a punk disco scene in which the members of the Blackpool punk band UFX appear opposite Amanda Holden. Episodes =Pilot (1997)= The pilot originally aired as the fourth installment of Comedy Premieres on 5 July 1997. =Series 1 (1999)= =Series 2 (2000)= =Series 3 (2001)=  Home media  Very few episodes of The Grimleys have been released for public purchase. Series 1 was released on VHS in 2000, both as a boxed set of the complete series and as two separate releases containing three episodes each. It was also released on a very rare DVD in 2007 (it is unknown if this DVD was official or a pirate release). Series 2, Series 3 and the finale have not been released. The pilot episode from 1997 was released on VHS in 2001, featuring a five-minute introduction to the series by Noddy Holder. In 2000 a two-disc soundtrack album was released and peaked at number 17 in the UK Compilation Chart. Another two-disc soundtrack album was released in 2001. The first album focused on glam metal and pop songs from the 1970s, and was titled Get Down and Get With it, Here Come the Grimleys. The second album featured punk, post-punk and new wave songs from the late 1970s, and was titled The Official Soundtrack to the Hit TV Show The Grimleys.  Logos  The pilot episode, shown in 1997, features a Grimleys logo on the opening titles that is never seen otherwise. Series one and two (as well as on the respective VHS releases and first soundtrack album) feature a green Grimleys logo showing the letters of \\"Grimleys\\" in platform shoes, with a lava lamp taking the place of the \\"I\\". A yellow silhouette of this logo made its way onto the cover of the VHS release of the pilot episode. As Nigel Planer left the cast between series two and series three, series three was given a new logo to go with its late 1970s punk concept. The new logo of The Grimleys featured the letters of the words in red on individual pieces of white paper, highly remisicent of (and most likely inspired by) how the words \\"Swindle\\" appear on the cover of The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle (an album of the Sex Pistols). Granada Productions' 1997‚Äì2001 endboard, reading simply \\"A Granada Production\\", is sometimes erroneously believed to be first used ever on the pilot episode.

A currency exchange was scheduled to last from 16 May until 22 July, but was eventually extended until 22 August. The somalo replaced the East African shilling at par and remained equal to it. It replaced the small amount of Italian lire in circulation at 1 Somalo = IT‚Ç§87.49. It was given an IMF parity of 124.414 mg fine gold, equal to one shilling sterling. Internationally, this currency became known as the Somali shilling when Somalia became independent on 1 July 1960. The Somalo/shilling was replaced at par on 15 December 1962 (along with the East African shilling circulating in British Somaliland) by the scellino (Somali shilling).History of the \\"Somalo\\" Following independence in 1960, the somalo of Italian Somaliland and the East African shilling (which were equal in value) were replaced at par in 1962 by the Somali shilling.

That effectively was a step to the end of the Cold War. Within the building, the flags of the United States and the Soviet Union are cross-hung to commemorate the meeting.  History  The house was built in 1909 and is located at F√©lagst√∫n. It was initially built for the French consul Jean-Paul Brillouin in Iceland, and was the exclusive residence of poet and businessman Einar Benediktsson (1864-1940) for twelve years (1913-1925). From 1925 to 1937 painter Louisa Matth√≠asd√≥ttir grew up in the house since her family resided there. In the 1940s and 1950s, it was home to the British Embassy in Reykjav√≠k. The city of Reykjav√≠k purchased the house in 1958, and restored it. From then on it has been used for formal receptions and festive occasions. On 25 September 2009, on the building's 100th birthday, H√∂f√∞i was damaged in a fire. All irreplaceable artifacts were saved. In 2015, Einar Benediktsson's statue, by √Åsmundur Sveinsson, was moved to a spot near H√∂f√∞i house. Construction The house was prefabricated in Norway and shows the influence of Jugendstil, it was shipped to Iceland and erected in 1909 for the French Consul, before permission for the house had been granted by the city planning department. At the time of construction it was the largest private estate in the city. Telecommunications history Before the house was built, the site was used to make the first radio communications between Iceland and the outside world on 26 June 1905, when contact was made with Poldhu in Cornwall, UK, with a Marconi antenna. Local legend The memoirs of one of the earliest occupants of H√∂f√∞i state that the house is inhabited by the spirit of a young woman. Accounts vary on who she is but most commonly she is either a suicide or drowning victim. John Greenway, who inhabited the house in 1952, insisted that it be sold and the British consulate moved elsewhere, because of what he called \\"bumps in the night\\". He even applied for special permission from the Foreign Office to do so. That same year the house was sold back to the Icelandic government. Popular local legends differ from the accounts of the house's inhabitants; the most popular of which is that the house is a Viking burial site. For this reason locals say the liquor cabinet of the house is frequently raided by spirits. The legend has even gained recognition by the Foreign Ministry who have officially stated that \\"We do not confirm or deny that the Hofdi has a ghost.\\" Gallery File:Hofdi house telecomms plaque reykjavik.JPGTelecomms commemoration plaque File:President Ronald Reagan says goodbye to Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev.jpgReagan and Gorbachev greet each other at H√∂f√∞i File:Gorbachev reagan plaque reykjavik.JPG Reagan Gorbachev plaque References Category:Houses in Iceland Category:Houses completed in 1909 Category:Buildings and structures in Reykjav√≠k Category:Diplomatic buildings Category:Cold War sites ","title":"H√∂f√∞i"},{"id":"3407122","text":"Somerset Somerset is a rural county in the southwest of England, covering . It is bounded on the north-west by the Bristol Channel, on the north by Bristol and Gloucestershire, on the north-east by Wiltshire, on the south-east by Dorset, and on the south west and west by Devon. It has broad central plains with several ranges of low hills. The landscape divides into four main geological sections from the Silurian through the Devonian and Carboniferous to the Permian which influence the landscape, together with water-related features. The low-lying areas of the North Somerset Levels and Somerset Levels have been subject to thousands of years of flooding and man's attempts to control the flow of water. In the north of the county the Limestone of the Mendip Hills dominates the landscape, while in the south the Blackdown and Quantock Hills rise out of the levels. The highest areas are on Exmoor. The wide variety of landscapes has led to several areas being designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest for geological reasons, and support a range of flora and fauna as can be seen from the List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Somerset.  Rock ages  The oldest rocks are of Silurian age (443‚Äì419 million years ago), the most southerly known outcrop of rocks of this age in Britain. They make up a sequence of lavas, tuffs (volcanic ash), shales and mudstones in a narrow outcrop to the northeast of Shepton Mallet, in the eastern Mendip Hills. Rocks from the Devonian (419‚Äì359 million years ago) are found across much of Exmoor, the Quantocks (including Hangman Sandstone and Cockercombe tuff), and in the cores of the folded masses of the Mendip Hills. Carboniferous Period (359‚Äì299 million years ago) rocks are represented by the Carboniferous Limestone that forms the Mendip Hills, rising abruptly out of the flat landscape of the Somerset Levels and Moors. The limestones are very fossiliferous, and contain evidence of the abundant marine life that existed at the time of their creation, including fossil crinoids (sea-lilies), corals and brachiopods. At the end of the Permian (299‚Äì252 million years ago) and Triassic periods, the Variscan orogeny resulted in the formation of several mountainous areas including Dartmoor in the south, Exmoor and the Quantocks, and the Mendips. In the Taunton area Permian (299‚Äì252 million years ago) red sandstones and breccia outcrop, although rocks of Triassic age (252‚Äì201 million years ago) underlie much of Somerset and form the solid geology of the Somerset Moors and Levels. There are no glacial deposits. Fault, on the coast of Somerset near Carhampton The Triassic rocks consist of red marls, sandstones, breccias and conglomerates which spread over the older rocks. The Dolomitic Conglomerate is an old shingle beach of Keuper Marl age. The Rhaetic Beds are full of fossils due to invasion of the Jurassic Sea. The Lias consists of clays and limestones, the latter being quarried and are famous for their fossils. Blue Lias was burnt locally to provide a source of lime for making lime mortar. It is still used as a decorative building stone. Blue Lias is believed to have been quarried on the Polden Hills as early as the 15th century and was quarried in Puriton from the early 19th century until 1973, when the local cement works closed.Dunning, R.W.

London: William Heinemann Ltd. . Page 143. Oxford Clay is the chief member of the Middle Oolite Series; and above this are the Upper Cretaceous rocks with Gault, Upper Greensand and Chalk. Alluvial flats and peat bogs occupy much of the centre of Somerset.  Coastline  Steep Holm In prehistoric times the coastline of Somerset was very different from the present one, the sea level at the last glacial maximum being several hundred feet lower than today so that the Bristol Channel was almost non-existent. The Bristol Channel has one of the largest tidal ranges in the world, up to at Burnham-on-Sea for example, behind only the Bay of Fundy and Ungava BayCharles T. O'reilly, Ron Solvason, and Christian Solomon. \\"Resolving the World's largest tides\\", in J.A Percy, A.J. Evans, P.G. Wells, and S.J.

The Severn Estuary: Landscape Evolution and Wetland Reclamation. London: Leicester University Press. . Chapter 2: \\"Creation of the Levels\\" This feature has meant that large areas of the county have been liable to flooding by the sea. Thus the present coastline is partly due to a belt of marine clay at the coast and partly due to seawalls built to reclaim areas previously flooded at high tide.Williams, Michael (1970). The Draining of the Somerset Levels. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. . Chapter 2: \\"Draining: The setting of the Somerset Levels\\". The coastline contains exposures of Devonian sediments and tectonics west of Minehead adjoining the classic exposures of Mesozoic sediments and structural features which extend eastward to the Parrett estuary forming cliffs along the coastline near Clevedon and near Minehead, with low sandhills near Burnham-on- Sea.Rippon (1997). The Severn Estuary: Landscape Evolution and Wetland Reclamation. London: Leicester University Press. . Chapter 1: \\"Introduction: a regional landscape study\\". There are sandy beaches mainly at Burnham-on-Sea, Brean and Weston-super-Mare. There are also storm ridges, salt marsh, and sand dunes.  Main river valleys  The main valleys between the hills are filled with alluvial deposits from the hills or sea. The county has many small rivers, most of which flow into the Bristol Channel. Many of the latter rivers now have clysts (the local name for a sluice) on them to control the sea, but formerly they were tidal for some way inland. The main exception to this is the River Parrett, which still has a tidal bore. However the Chew and the Frome flow into the Avon which forms most of the northern county boundary with Gloucestershire.Landranger Map 172: Bristol & Bath. Published in 2006 by the Ordnance Survey The Cale flows into Dorset through the Blackmore Vale, while the Exe flows into Devon.

Chapter 8 In: Blair, John (Edr) (2007). Waterways and Canal-Building in Medieval England. Oxford: Oxford University Press. . The River Axe rises from Wookey Hole Caves, due to water draining into the ground at swallet holes on top of the Mendips. The river passes through Panborough Moor, Wedmore Moor, Ox Moor, Stoke Moor and Mark Moor and reaches the sea at Uphill (near Weston-super-Mare) on Bridgwater Bay.Landranger Map 182: Weston-super-Mare. Published in 2005 by the Ordnance Survey The River Brue rises at Brewham, close to the county border with Wiltshire. It flows through Bruton and is joined by the rivers Pitt and Alham. The river then flows past East and West Lydford to Baltonsborough and then turns north to Street across Butts Moor, South Moor and Kennard Moor. Originally it then joined the Axe but now it flows west across Westhay Moor, Tealham and Tadham Moors, Chilton Moor, Mark Moor and Huntspill Moor. It is joined by the North Drain and the Hartlake river. In Huntspill Moor the Brue is linked to the man-made Huntspill river by the artificial Cripps river.Williams, Michael (1970). The Draining of the Somerset Levels. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. . The Brue reaches the sea near Burnham-on-Sea. River Brue near Glastonbury The River Cary originates in Castle Cary in the east of Somerset. It flows south-west through Cary Moor to Cary Fitzpaine. The river then turns north-west to the north of Somerton. It then used to turn south to join the Parrett but now passes through Somerton Moor and crosses Kings Sedgemoor in an artificial channel, the King's Sedgemoor Drain, joining the Parrett at Dunball north of Bridgwater. The River Parrett originates at Cheddington, Dorset, just over the border with Somerset. It enters Somerset at Haselbury Plucknett where it is joined by the Broad river. It passes to the east of South Petherton and flows north through Thorney Moor and Muchelney Level and it is then joined by the Isle and Yeo (Ivel) rivers. The Parrett flows through Langport and then through Middle Moor, Aller Moor to Burrowbridge where it is joined by the River Tone. It then passes through Earlake Moor, Hartlake Moor, Weston Level and South Moor. It continues north through Bridgwater, Horsey Level, past Pawlett Ham and Pawlett Level to the coast near Burnham-on-Sea. The River Tone originates at Beverton Pond on the Brendon Hills in the west of Somerset. It flows south into Clatworthy reservoir and then to GreenhamLandranger Map 181: Minehead & Brendon Hills.

It then flows south to Exebridge where it meets the Barle and passes into Devon.Landranger Map 192: Exeter & Sidmouth. Published in 2007 by the Ordnance Survey  Levels and moors  The view towards Brent Knoll from Glastonbury Tor The North Somerset Levels are to the east of Weston-super-Mare, while the Axe valley is separated by the Isle of Wedmore from the Brue valley. The latter is separated by the Polden Hills from the main wetland of the Parrett/Tone/Cary valleys. The Poldens are a low narrow ridge of Blue Lias with alternating bands of limestone and clay. Because of the nature of the Levels and Moors, the Poldens have a significant visual impact. The Somerset Levels run from the coast up to inland. These wetlands cover , most of which is no higher than above sea level. There are coastal marine clay deposits, and further inland there are many peaty areas. Dotted within this wetland landscape are slightly raised inter-glacial \\"islands\\" called burtles. These have been settled from the Mesolithic onward, with wooden causeways linking them to higher ground. There are also rocky outcrops, such as Brent Knoll and Glastonbury Tor which have also housed ancient settlements.Croft, Robert and Aston, Michael (1993). Somerset from the air: An Aerial Guide to the Heritage of the County. Taunton: Somerset County Council. . Chapter 4: \\"The Somerset Levels and Moors. The water levels in the moors and levels are controlled by a series of small narrow canals called rhynes (known as 'rhines' in Avonmouth and Gloucestershire - both are pronounced 'reens'). along with larger drains, gates and pumping stations. The rhynes are often used as field boundary ditches instead of hedges.Williams, Michael (1970). The Draining of the Somerset Levels. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. . Page 187. Some parts are allowed to flood in winter. The area is mainly used for grazing but some peat extraction is carried out.  Northern uplands  This is the area between the River Avon to the north and the Axe valley. The north of Somerset is dominated by the tableland of the Mendip Hills, an area of outstanding natural beauty, stretching from Frome in the east to Crook Peak in the west, with outliers of Bleadon Hill and Brean Down as well as Steep Holm in the Bristol Channel. The highest point is Black Down at . There is an escarpment facing south to the Levels and Moors while the dip slope to the north is broken up. Charterhouse Wireless Station in the Mendip Hills To the north of Bath are Lansdown, Langridge and Solsbury hills. These are outliers of the Cotswolds. Bath is noted for its thermal waters (48 ¬∞C) that are rich in calcium and sodium sulphates. The Old Red Sandstone is a series of red sandstones, marls and conglomerates. It rises as an anticline in the Mendips and appears in the Avon Gorge and at Portishead. Carboniferous Limestone, of marine origin, covers the sandstone and appears in the Avon Gorge and at Weston-super-Mare where it contains volcanic rocks. There are outlying hills at Worlebury, Middle Hope, the Failand Ridge, Broadfields Down, Portishead Down and Wrington Hill. The main geological component of the Mendips is Carboniferous Limestone. It represents the remnants of a much higher range of hills that existed hundreds of millions years ago. This has allowed the formation of features such as Cheddar Gorge, Ebbor Gorge and Burrington Combe. There are a wide variety of caves and swallet holes caused by dissolution of the rock by water. Further east there are Silurian volcanoes, Carboniferous Limestone outcrops, Variscan thrust tectonics, Permo-Triassic conglomerates, sediment-filled fissures, a classic unconformity, Jurassic clays and limestones, Cretaceous Greensand and chalk topped with Tertiary remnants including Sarsen Stones. These sediments have yielded a fairly rich fossil fauna of brachiopods and trilobites indicating that they were deposited in a shallow marine sea into which the lavas were extruded. The rocks are quarried at Moons Hill near Stoke St Michael for aggregate. Coal measures appear in the Radstock district, and surrounding Somerset Coalfield (largely concealed by Triassic and newer rocks). There are two series of coal-bearing sandstones and shales separated by Pennant Sandstone. Locally the beds are folded and faulted. There were mines in the Radstock and Nailsea areas but these have closed. This was one of the first areas in the world to undergo systematic geological study and mapping by John Strachey and William Smith in the 18th century. They observed the rock layers, or strata, which led Smith to the creation of a testable hypothesis, which he termed the Principle of Faunal Succession.As recounted in Simon Winchester, The Map that Changed the World (New York: HarperCollins, 2001), pp. 59-91. The Mendips were mined for lead, silver, coal, ochre, fuller's earth and zinc but this has finished. They were also quarried for stone, notably at Bath and Doulting. Today the Mendips are a major source of aggregates.  Southern uplands  Ham Hill summit and war memorial seen from Stoke-sub-Hamdon To the south of Somerset there is an upland with a series of rolling valleys and scarps, from Penselwood in the east to the Blackdown Hills, another designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in the west. This is a geologically complex area of clays, limestone and marl. The honey-coloured limestone at Ham Hill (also known as Hamdon Hill) is particularly important to geologists because of the assemblages of fossils which it contains, the sedimentary features which it displays and the way it relates to other rocks of equivalent age in the close vicinity. It has been quarried since Roman times at least. The Blackdowns are on the south-west border of Somerset, extending into Devon. They are composed of Upper Greensand. The scarp faces north and is steep and wooded, with a south facing dip slope. There is an open plateau, which is not as high as the Mendips. The Quantock Hills are a long broad ridge from the coast near Watchet in the north to near Taunton in the south. They reach high at Wills Neck and are separated from Exmoor and the Brendons by a rift valley. The Quantocks and the Brendon Hills at the eastern end of Exmoor are formed by thick sequences of slates and sandstones of Devonian age that were deposited by large deltas that built out into a shallow sea. Beach at Quantoxhead. The wave cut platform at low tide. The short 'cliff' shows the rock strata The Quantock Hills are largely formed by rocks of the Devonian Period, which consist of sediments originally laid down under a shallow sea and slowly compressed into solid rock. In the higher north western areas older Early Devonian rocks, known as Hangman Grits, predominate, and can be seen in the exposed rock at West Quantoxhead quarry, which were worked for road building. Further south there are newer Middle and Late Devonian rocks, known as Ilfracombe beds and Morte Slates. These include sandstone and limestone, which have been quarried near Aisholt. At Great Holwell, south of Aisholt, there is a limestone cave, which is the only one in the Devonian limestone of North Devon and West Somerset. The lower fringes around the hills are composed of younger rocks of the Triassic period, these are known as New Red Sandstone rocks which represent the deposits of large river systems that crossed a desert plain, and often contain irregular masses or veins of gypsum, which was worked on the foreshore at Watchet. The scarp is to the west with a dip slope to the east. The west side is cut by combes with broad valleys on the east. The hill tops are open heathland with woods on the slopes. Several areas have outcrops of slates and between St Audries and Kilve, younger rocks of the Jurassic Period can be found. This area falls within the Blue Anchor to Lilstock Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and is considered to be of international geological importance. At Kilve are the remains of a red brick retort, built in 1924, when it was discovered that the shale found in the cliffs was rich in oil. At Blue Anchor the coloured alabaster found in the cliffs gave rise to the name of the colour \\"Watchet Blue\\".  Exmoor  Exmoor in winter Exmoor is a dissected plateau of Devonian sedimentary rock, rising to at Dunkery Beacon. It extends into Devon but the majority of the area is in Somerset. Much of the area is a National Park. The landscape is one of rounded hills, with hogs-back cliffs at the coast due to geological movements. Because of high rainfall there are boggy areas and the part by the Chains is a Geological Conservation Review site recognised as being nationally important for its south-western lowland heath communities and for transitions from ancient semi-natural woodland through upland heath to blanket mire. The Chains provides palynological record of a mid to late Flandrian vegetation history on Exmoor. The pollen sequence in the peat is calibrated by radiocarbon dating. The Glenthorne area demonstrates the Trentishoe Formation of the Hangman Sandstone Group. The Hangman Sandstone represents the Middle Devonian sequence of North Devon and Somerset. These unusual freshwater deposits in the Hangman Grits, were mainly formed in desert conditions. As this area of Britain was not subject to glaciation, the plateau remains as a remarkably old landform. Quartz and iron mineralisation can be detected in outcrops and subsoil. The underlying rocks are covered by moors are supported by wet, acid soil. The highest point on Exmoor is Dunkery Beacon; at it is also the highest point in Somerset. Exmoor has of coastline, including the highest cliffs in England, which reach a height of at Culbone Hill. However, the crest of this coastal ridge of hills is more than from the sea. If a cliff is defined as having a slope greater than 60 degrees, the highest cliff on mainland Britain is Great Hangman near Combe Martin at high, with a cliff face of . Its sister cliff is the Little Hangman, which marks the edge of Exmoor. Exmoor's woodlands sometimes reach the shoreline, especially between Porlock and The Foreland, where they form the single longest stretch of coastal woodland in England and Wales. The Exmoor Coastal Heaths have been recognised as a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to the diversity of plant species present. The East Lyn River The high ground forms the catchment area for numerous rivers and streams. There are about of named rivers on Exmoor. The River Exe, from which Exmoor takes its name, rises at Exe Head near the village of Simonsbath, close to the Bristol Channel coast, but flows more or less directly due south, so that most of its length lies in Devon. The river and the Barle Valley are both designated as biological sites of Special Scientific Interest. Another tributary, the River Haddeo, flows from the Wimbleball Lake. The action of streams has cut combes through the hills down to the sea, which are now wooded, although much of Exmoor is open heathland. There is an outlier of Exmoor at North Hill near Minehead. Iron working was formerly carried out, probably from the Roman period onward. Because Exmoor was a royal forest, i.e. a hunting reserve, it was unpopulated in Medieval times. The first house on the moor was only built at Simonsbath in 1654. It was not until the 19th century that farms were built around the moor. The Brendon Hills are an eastern outlier of Exmoor with the same undulating landscape but separated from the main area by the valley of the River Avill. They reach a height of at Lype Hill. Iron ore mining was carried out from Roman times up to the early 20th century.

Such a system will be unable to load any additional programs, and since many programs may load additional data into memory during execution, these will cease to function correctly. This usually occurs because all available memory, including disk swap space, has been allocated. History Historically, the out of memory condition was more common than it is now, since early computers and operating systems were limited to small amounts of physical random-access memory (RAM) due to the inability of early processors to address large amounts of memory, as well as cost considerations. Since the advent of virtual memory opened the door for the usage of swap space, the condition is less frequent. Almost all modern programs expect to be able to allocate and deallocate memory freely at run-time, and tend to fail in uncontrolled ways (crash) when that expectation is not met; older ones often allocated memory only once, checked whether they got enough to do all their work, and then expected no more to be forthcoming. Therefore, they would either fail immediately with an \\"out of memory\\" error message, or work as expected. Early operating systems such as MS-DOS lacked support for multitasking. Programs were allocated physical memory that they could use as they needed. Physical memory was often a scarce resource, and when it was exhausted by applications such as those with Terminate and Stay Resident functionality, no further applications could be started until running applications were closed. Modern operating systems provide virtual memory, in which processes are given a range of memory, but where the memory does not directly correspond to actual physical RAM. Virtual memory can be backed by physical RAM, a disk file via mmap (on Unix-derivatives) or MapViewOfFile (on Windows), or swap space, and the operating system can move virtual memory pages around as it needs. Because virtual memory does not need to be backed by physical memory, exhaustion of it is rare, and usually there are other limits imposed by the operating system on resource consumption. As predicted by Moore's law, the amount of physical memory in all computers has grown almost exponentially, although this is offset to some degree by programs and files themselves becoming larger. In some cases, a computer with virtual memory support where the majority of the loaded data resides on the hard disk may run out of physical memory but not virtual memory, thus causing excessive paging. This condition, known as thrashing, usually renders the computer unusable until some programs are closed or the machine is rebooted. Due to these reasons, an out of memory message is rarely encountered by applications with modern computers. It is, however, still possible to encounter an OOM condition with a modern computer. The typical OOM case in modern computers happens when the operating system is unable to create any more virtual memory, because all of its potential backing devices have been filled or the end-user has disabled them. The condition may arise because of copy-on-write after fork().  Out of memory management  The kernels of operating systems such as Linux will attempt to recover from this type of OOM condition by terminating one or more processes, a mechanism known as the OOM Killer. Linux 4.6 (released in May 2016) introduced changes in OOM situations, improving detection and reliability., cgroup awareness in OOM killer was implemented in Linux kernel 4.19 released in October 2018, which adds an ability to kill a cgroup as a single unit. Per-process memory limits Apart from the system-wide physical memory limits, some systems limit the amount of memory each process can use. Usually a matter of policy, such a limitation can also happen when the OS has a larger address space than is available at the process level. Some high-end 32-bit systems (such as those with Physical Address Extension enabled) come with 8 gigabytes or more of system memory, even though any single process can only access 4 GB of it in a 32-bit flat memory model. A process which exceeds its per-process limit and then attempts to allocate further memory will encounter an error condition. For example, the C standard function for allocating memory, \`malloc()\`, will return NULL and a well-behaved application should handle this situation.

The architecture, construction, internal and external decoration, and the functions of the house reflect the culture and values of the Minangkabau. A Rumah Gadang serves as a residence, a hall for family meetings, and for ceremonial activities. In the matrilineal Minangkabau society, the Rumah Gadang is owned by the women of the family who live there; ownership is passed from mother to daughter. The houses have dramatic curved roof structure with multi-tiered, upswept gables. Shuttered windows are built into walls incised with profuse painted floral carvings. The term Rumah Gadang usually refers to the larger communal homes, however, smaller single residences share many of its architectural elements. In West Sumatra, traditional Rumah Gadang reflect the province‚Äôs Minangkabau people, and has become the symbol of West Sumatra and Minangkabau culture. Throughout the region, numerous buildings demonstrate the design elements of Rumah Gadang, including genuine vernacular timber masonry structures built for customary ceremonies, to the more mundane modern structure like those of government offices and public facilities. Today, Rumah Gadang architectural elements, especially its gonjong horn-like curved roof can be found in modern structures, such as governor and regencies office buildings, marketplaces, hotels, facade of Padang restaurants and Minangkabau International Airport. An istano basa, however, is the largest and most magnificent example of this traditional style. Background Location of West Sumatra home of the Minangkabau Sumatra is the sixth largest island in the world and since the time of Marco Polo has been referred to as the 'island of gold'. It is the most resource-rich island of Indonesia, including its tea, pepper and rubber plantations, and oil, tin and other mineral resources. Lying on the equator, Sumatra has a monsoonal climate and, although more rain falls between October and May, there is no extended rainless dry season. Despite large-scale deforestation, Sumatra still has millions of acres of unexploited rainforests that provide building materials. The great hardwood trees required for large scale construction are now, however, in strictly limited supply. Sumatra is home to one of the most diverse range of peoples in the Southeast Asian archipelago. This diversity is reflected in a range variety of often dramatic traditional homes known as rumah adat. The most common housing forms have traditionally been wooden and raised on piles, built of locally gathered materials, with steeply pitched, roofs. In addition to the Minangkabau's rumah gadang, the Batak of Lake Toba region build the boat-shaped jabu with dominating carved gables and dramatic oversize roofs, and the people of Nias build the fortified omo sebua houses on massive ironwood pillars with towering roof structures. The Minangkabau are indigenous to the highlands of central Sumatra. Their culture is matrilineal, with property and land being passed down from mother to daughter; religious and political affairs are the province of men. The Minangkabau are strongly Islamic, but also follow their own ethnic traditions, or adat. Minangkabau adat was derived from animistic and Hindu- Buddhist beliefs before the arrival of Islam, and remnants of animistic beliefs exist even among some practicing Muslims. As such, women are customarily the property owners; husbands are only tolerated in the house at certain times and under special conditions and must return to their sisters' house to sleep. Complementing this practice is the custom of merantau whereby many of the men will travel far afield for work, returning only periodically to their village of origin. Money earned on these trips is remitted for the building of contemporary rumah adat. Form The external walls of a rumah gadang are covered with motifs, each having a symbolic meaning A communal rumah gadang is a long house, rectangular in plan, with multiple gables and upsweeping ridges, forming buffalo horn-like ends. They normally have three- tiered projections, each with varying floor levels. They are broad and set on wooden piles that can reach as high as off the ground; sometimes with a verandah running along the front face of the house which is used as a reception and dining area, and as a sleeping place for guests. Unlike the Batak Toba homes, where the roof essentially creates the living space, the Minangkabau roof rests on conventional walls. Cooking and storage areas are often in separate buildings. A rumah gadang and rangkiang in 1910 The house is largely constructed of wood; an exception being the rear longitudinal wall which is a plain lattice woven in a chequered pattern from split bamboo. The roof is of a truss and cross-beam construction and is typically covered with thatch from the fibre of the sugar palm (ijuk), the toughest thatch material available and said to last a hundred years. The thatch is laid in bundles which can be easily fitted to the curved, multi-gabled roof. Contemporary homes, however, are more frequently using corrugated iron in place of thatch. Roof finials are formed from thatch bound by decorative metal bindings and drawn into points said to resemble buffalo horns -- an allusion to a legend concerning a battle between two water buffaloes from which the 'Minangkabau' name is thought to have been derived. The roof peaks themselves are built up out of many small battens and rafters. The women who share the house have sleeping quarters set into alcoves ‚Äì traditionally odd in number ‚Äì that are set in a row against the rear wall and curtained off by the vast interior space of the main living area. Traditionally, large communal rumah gadang will be surrounded by smaller homes built for married sisters and daughters of the parent family. It is the responsibility of the women's maternal uncle to ensure that each marriageable woman in the family has a room of her own. To this end he will build either a new house or, more commonly, annexes to the original one. It is said that the number of married daughters in a home can be told by the counting its horn-like extensions; as they are not always added symmetrically, rumah gadang can sometimes look unbalanced. Adolescent boys traditionally live in the village surau, a small mosque. =Architectural elements= Interior of the Pagaruyung Palace, showing the long common area of a rumah gadang. The two-level floor is a symbolic element specific to the palace. Each element of a rumah gadang has its own symbolic meaning, which is referred to in adat speech and aphorisms. The elements of a rumah gadang includes: * gonjong, hornlike roof structure * singok, triangular wall under the ends of gonjong * pereng, shelf under the singok * anjuang, raised floor at the end of one style of rumah gadang * dindiang ari, the walls on the side elevations * dindiang tapi, the walls on the front and back elevations * papan banyak, front facade * papan sakapiang, a shelf or middle band on the periphery of the house * salangko, wall enclosing space under a house that has been built on stilts Some symbolisms of the house, for example, relate to the gonjong reaching to god and the dindiang tapi, which is traditionally made of plaited strips of bamboo, symbolizing the strength and utility of the community which is formed when individual Minangkabau become part of the larger community instead of standing alone.The peaks of the roof are said to represent buffalo horns as well as reaching to god mentioned earlier. The pillars of the ideal rumah gadang are arranged in five rows which run the length of the house. These rows divide the interior into four long spaces called lanjar. The lanjar at the rear of the house is divided into bedrooms (ruang). According to adat, a rumah gadang must have at least five ruang, and the ideal number is nine. The other lanjar are used as a common area, called the labuah gajah (elephant road), for living and ceremonial events. A number of rice barns (rangkiang) ideally accompany a rumah gadang, with each having a different name and function. The rangkiang sitinjau lauik, contains rice for the family, particularly for adat ceremonies. The rangkiang sitangka lapa contains rice for donation to poor villagers and for times of famine in the village. The rangkiang sibayau-bayau contains rice for the daily needs of the family. =Ornamentation= An example of the carvings from a rumah gadang The Minangkabau traditionally embellish the wooden walls, pillars, and ceilings of the rumah gadang with bas-relief carved wooden motifs that reflect and symbolize their adat. The motifs consists of profuse floral designs based on a simple underlying geometric structure. The motifs are similar to those of the Minangkabau woven songket textiles, with colors thought to have been derived from Chinese brocades. Traditionally, the motifs do not show animals or humans in a realistic form, although some may represent animals, human beings, or their activities or behavior. The motifs are based on the Minangkabau concept of aesthetics, which is part of their view of their world (Alam Minangkabau) in which expression is always based upon the natural environment. A well-known adat aphorism says, 'nature is our teacher'. View of the external carvings of a rumah gadang. The inner side of the shutter is painted as they are visible when open. Ninety-four motifs have been observed on rumah gadang. Thirty-seven of them refer to flora, such as kaluak paku ('fern tendrils'), saluak laka ('interwoven rattan'), pucuak rabuang ('bamboo shoots'), areca-nut palms, and lumuik hanyuik ('washed-away moss'). Twenty-eight motifs refer to fauna, such as tupai tatagun ('startled squirrel'), itiak pulang patang ('ducks going home in the afternoon) which symbolizes co-operation and homecoming wanderers, and kumbang janti (golden bumblebee). The remaining twenty-nine motifs refer to humans and sometimes their activities or behavior, such as rajo tigo (three kings of the realm), kambang manih (sweet flower, used to describe an amiable girl) and jalo takambang (casting a net). =Variations= Minangkabau royal palace at Pagaruyung has three roofs which rise in tiers; the first two rise laterally and the top room transversally. Extensions at either side add a further two roof forms. The rumah gadang is built in one of two basic designs: koto piliang and bodi caniago. These forms reflect different two variations of Minangkabau social structure. The koto piliang design reflects an aristocratic and hierarchical social structure, with the house containing anjuang (raised floors) at each end to permit elevated seating of clan leaders during ceremonial events. The bodi caniago design reflects a democratic social structure, with the floors being flat and on one level. Large communal homes are entered through a doorway in the centre of the structure which is usually surrounded by a perpendicular porch with a triangular gable and upsweeping peaked ridge end. The variation with no entry porch is named bapaserek or surambi papek (\\"without veranda\\"). The larger and more opulent houses, have higher walls and multiple roofs, often with five elements inserted into each other, and supported by large wooden columns. Variations on the number of columns are known as the gajah maharam (\\"elephant kneeling\\"), which may have forty columns resulting in a shorter and stouter form, and the rajo babandiang ('design of grandeur') with fifty pillars and a more slender form. An additional six columns are required at each end for the anjuang of the Koto Piliang variation. A government building that contains elements of the rumah gadang style A Minangkabau traditional council hall, known as a balai adat, appears similar to a rumah gadang. This type of building is used by clan leaders as a meeting place, and it is not enclosed by walls, except for the anjuang of the Koto Piliang model. The Pagaruyung Palace is built in the traditional Minangkabau rumah gadang architectural style, but one unusual aspect is that it has three levels. In West Sumatra some modern government and commercial buildings, and domestic houses (rumah gedung), have adopted elements of the rumah gadang style. There has been a sizable Minangkabau settlement in Negeri Sembilan (now in Malaysia) since the seventeenth century, with the chief of the Minangkabau still ruler there. The Negeri Sembilan Minangkabau, however, have adopted the Malay-style roof construction, with continuous ridge piece thatched with lengths of palm-leaf attached to battens. Although this has meant the loss of the characteristic curved roof and has blunter eaves, it is still considered dignified and beautiful. More orthodox Islamic influence has also led to variations such as modifications to the interior layout, as women are more restricted to the rear of the house than in the case of the matrilineal Sumatran Minangkabau. Construction The construction of a house is subject to specific regulations, laid down by the ancestors and formalised in adat, that need to be observed if the house is to become a beautiful and pleasant building. The construction and maintenance of a rumah gadang is the responsibility of ninik mamak, the elder male blood- relatives of the matrilineal descent group that owns and builds it.

Originally paired with Central Park in the Dark as Two Contemplations in 1908, The Unanswered Question was revised by Ives in 1930‚Äì1935. As with many of Ives' works, it was largely unknown until much later in his life, and was not performed until 1946. Against a background of slow, quiet strings representing \\"The Silence of the Druids\\", a solo trumpet poses \\"The Perennial Question of Existence\\", to which a woodwind quartet of \\"Fighting Answerers\\" tries vainly to provide an answer, growing more frustrated and dissonant until they give up. The three groups of instruments perform in independent tempos and are placed separately on the stage‚Äîthe strings offstage. Composition The score of The Unanswered Question printed by Southern Music Publishing in 1953 lists the following three instrumental groups: * A woodwind quartet. The Foreword to the score states \\"If a large string orchestra is playing, the full treble woodwind choir may be used at the discretion of the conductor...\\"  Flute I  Flute II  Flute III (or Oboe)  Flute IV (or Clarinet) * A solo instrument, preferably a trumpet. The Foreword states \\"the trumpet should use a mute unless playing in a very large room, or with a larger string orchestra.\\"  Trumpet (or English Horn, or Oboe or Clarinet) * A string quartet or string orchestra (con sordini). The Foreword states that the group \\"if possible, should be 'off stage', or away from the trumpet and flutes.\\" It also states: \\"If more than four strings, a basso may play with the 'cellos (8va basso). The strings play ppp throughout with no change in tempo.\\"  Violin I  Violin II  Viola  Violoncello (8va Contrabass) The groups play in independent tempos, and typically require separate conductors. Ives provided a short text by which to interpret the work, giving it a narrative as in program music. Throughout the piece the strings sustain slow tonal triads that, according to Ives, represent \\"The Silence of the Druids ‚Äî who Know, See and Hear Nothing\\". Against this background, the trumpet poses a nontonal phrase ‚Äî \\"The Perennial Question of Existence\\" ‚Äî seven times, to which the woodwinds \\"answer\\" the first six times in an increasingly erratic way. Ives wrote that the woodwinds' answers represented \\"Fighting Answerers\\" who, after a time, \\"realize futility and begin to mock 'The Question'\\" before finally disappearing, leaving \\"The Question\\" to be asked once more before \\"The Silences\\" are left to their \\"Undisturbed Solitude\\". The piece ends with the strings \\"hum[ming] softly in the distance, like the eternal music of the spheres.\\" The strings twice repeat a pianississimo thirteen-bar progression, so slowly it has a static feel. It uses voice leading, passing tones, and ornamental notes in a manner reminiscent of a hymn or chorale. After the repetition, the strings' part varies in subtle ways that are difficult for the listener to detect. In contrast to this ever-changing but seemingly regular \\"Silence\\", the trumpet repeats the same \\"Question\\". It is the woodwinds' atonal answers that change in obvious ways, growing increasingly agitated and dissonant. After the woodwinds finally give up, the trumpet poses the question quietly one last time. History Ives composed The Unanswered Question, subtitled \\"(a Cosmic Landscape)\\" in Ives's work papers, in 1908 (though it is often erroneously dated 1906), and revised it in 1930‚Äì1935, at which time he included a 13-bar introduction, made the woodwind parts more dissonant, and added further dynamic and articulation indications. He also made a small but significant change to the \\"question motif\\", which had originally ended on the note that began it, but now remained unresolved. During 1930‚Äì1935 he also worked on a version of The Unanswered Question for chamber orchestra. The premiere performance of this version occurred on May 11, 1946 at McMillin Theatre, Columbia University in New York City, played by a chamber orchestra of graduate students from the Juilliard School and conducted by Edgar Schenkman (on-stage), with the strings led by Theodore Bloomfield (off-stage). The same concert featured the premieres of Central Park in the Dark and String Quartet No. 2. The original version of the work was not premiered until March 17, 1984, when Dennis Russell Davies and the American Composers Orchestra performed it at Symphony Space in New York City as part of the \\"Wall-to-Wall Ives\\" series.Mortensen 2005 In 1985, Paul Echols and Noel Zahler produced an edition of The Unanswered Question that included both the original version and the revised 1930‚Äì1935 edition. Echols and Zahler were fortunate in that sufficiently complete sources were available to work from for both scores. Notational and performative considerations In his essay \\"The Rhythmic Basis of American Music,\\" Elliott Carter noted that \\"the combination of different rhythmic planes involved Ives in complex problems of notation.\\" In The Unanswered Question, the strings and trumpet play at a tempo marked \\"Largo molto sempre\\", while the winds gradually accelerate, their bar lines going out of sync with those of the other instruments. (The tempo markings for the six \\"Answers\\" are: Adagio, Andante, Allegretto, Allegro, Allegro molto, and Allegro, accel to Presto.) In the Foreword to the score, Ives wrote that the wind's music \\"need not be played in the exact time position indicated. It is played in somewhat of an impromptu way...\\" He also noted: \\"'The Answers' may be played somewhat sooner after each 'Question' than indicated in the score, but 'The Question' should be played no sooner for that reason.\\" Regarding the ending of the piece, Ives wrote: \\"The flutes will end their part approximately near the position indicated in the string score; but in any case, 'The Last Question' should not be played by the trumpet until 'The Silences' of the strings in the distance have been heard for a measure or two. The strings will continue their last chord for two measures or so after the trumpet stops. If the strings shall have reached their last chord before the trumpet plays 'The Last Question', they will hold it through and continue after, as suggested above.\\" In terms of dynamics, the strings play ppp throughout, fading to pppp at the end. The trumpet plays p throughout, except for the last \\"Question\\", which is pp. The winds, however, gradually increase in loudness: dynamic markings for the six \\"Answers\\" are p, mp, mf, f < ff, f < ff, and ff < fff < ffff. Ives noted: \\"During some of the louder passages of the flutes, the strings may not be heard, and it is not important that they should be.\\" Views Linda Mack called The Unanswered Question \\"a study in contrasts. Strings intone slow diatonic, triadic chords; a solo trumpet asks the question seven times; the flutes try to answer the question, each time getting more and more agitated and atonal.\\" Leonard Bernstein added in his 1973 Norton Lectures which borrowed its title from the Ives work that the woodwinds are said to represent our human answers growing increasingly impatient and desperate, until they lose their meaning entirely. Meanwhile, right from the very beginning, the strings have been playing their own separate music, infinitely soft and slow and sustained, never changing, never growing louder or faster, never being affected in any way by that strange question-and-answer dialogue of the trumpet and the woodwinds.Bernstein 1967 Bernstein also talks about how the strings are playing tonal triads against the trumpet's non tonal phrase. In the end, when the trumpet asks the question for the last time, the strings \\"are quietly prolonging their pure G major triad into eternity\\".Bernstein 1976, 269 This piece graphically represents the 20th century dichotomy of both tonal and atonal music occurring at the same time. Another view of the piece was written by Austin Frey: > The 'cosmic landscape' of The Unanswered Question, a trumpet repeatedly > poses 'the eternal question of existence' against a haunting background of > strings, finally to be answered by an eloquent silence. By that work of > 1906, Ives was over half a century ahead of his time, writing in collage- > like planes of contrasting styles. In 1951, the Polymusic Chamber Orchestra, > conducted by Will Lorin, first recorded the piece.Swafford 1998 Henry and Sidney Cowell wrote: \\"Silence is represented by soft slow-moving concordant tones widely spaced in the strings; they move through the whole piece with uninterrupted placidity. After they have gone on long enough to establish their mood, loud wind instruments cut through the texture with a dissonant raucous melody that ends with the upturned inflection of the Question.\\" Emerson's 1847 poem \\"The Sphinx\\". Ives scholar Wayne Shirley believed that The Unanswered Question shared \\"imagery, structure, and worldview\\" with \\"The Sphinx\\" (1847) by American Transcendentalist poet Ralph Waldo Emerson, and that the title derived from a line from the poem: \\"Thou art the unanswered question\\". While at Yale, Ives wrote his senior essay on Emerson, and shortly after composing The Unanswered Question, he composed his Emerson Overture, parts of which were later incorporated into the Concord Sonata. Matthew McDonald noted that Ives \\"recalled how The Unanswered Question was one of several pieces that was 'played ‚Äî or better tried out ‚Äî usually ending in a fight or hiss...'\\" shortly after its composition. He concludes that \\"It is possible... to associate the Answerers with Ives's public, initially confused by, and ultimately dismissing and mocking, his music... We might... conceive of The Unanswered Question, then, as thickly veiled autobiography, in which Ives elevated the trope of the misunderstood artist to the loftiest heights imaginable, a struggle of cosmic proportions.\\" Reception and legacy Ives' biographer Jan Swafford called the piece \\"a kind of collage in three distinct layers, roughly coordinated\\". Aaron Copland, who often conducted the composition, considered it to be \\"among the finest works ever created by an American artist\\". Ives use of separate groups of instruments placed apart on the stage and playing in independent tempos influenced the work of American composer Henry Brant. The music was used in the 1972 short film directed by Donald Fox based on the tale \\"Young Goodman Brown\\" by author Nathaniel Hawthorne. It was also used in the 1998 film Run Lola Run. The music was used in The Thin Red Line (1998), performed by Orchestra of St. Luke's and conducted by John Adams. The part for strings was also used at the end of Terence Davies' biopic of Emily Dickinson, A Quiet Passion (2016). It is performed by the Brussels Philharmonic. Also used in Oliver Hermanus' film Moffie (2020) The introduction was reused by Owen Pallett for an alternative version of the song \\"The CN Tower Belongs to the Dead\\" as a B-side of the \\"Many Lives ‚Üí 49 MP\\" single; it is humorously called the \\"Many Ives version\\" as a clear reference to Charles Ives. This version is also played live with orchestras.Owen Pallett and Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra, \\"The CN Tower Belongs to the Dead\\", August 8, 2009. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AsaQXbHQto A version of the composition was also performed on the 2013 Fink album, Fink Meets the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra.

From Garri Bardin's letter at the We Are Here! online paper, 6‚Äì12 September 2012 (in Russian) Garri spent three years in the Soviet Army and in 1968 he finished the Actor's Faculty at the Moscow Art Theatre School and joined the N. V. Gogol Moscow Drama Theatre (modern-day Gogol Center) where he served till 1973. The director asked him to shorten his surname which was too long for theatre posters, and he adapted the Bardin stage name. Upon leaving the theatre he spent some time writing stories, plays and TV screenplays. He had been also voicing cartoons since 1967. Around the same time he sent a screenplay to Soyuzmultfilm and was suggested to direct the cartoon by himself despite the lack of education. From then on he worked as an animation director. Among his first shorts was A Tincan segment from the Happy Merry-Go- Round No. 8 anthology series (1976). In 1979 he directed A Flying Ship, a traditionally animated musical film loosely based on the old Russian fairy tale The Fool of the World and the Flying Ship. The film and the songs by Yuri Entin in particular gained popularity. Bardin then worked on several other hand-drawn films along with Entin. In 1983 he directed his first experimental stop motion cartoon for adults ‚Äî Conflict, a cold war allegory where two groups of matches enter a conflict which leads to a war. It was followed by several claymation comedy films, including Break!, a parody on a boxing match for which Bardin received a Golden Dove award at the 1986 Dok Leipzig.Break! awards at IMDb In 1987 he released two films: Marriage made of ropes and Fioritures made of aluminium wire for which he was awarded the 1988 Short Film Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival.

It is the largest known living bee species. It was believed to be extinct until several specimens were discovered in 1981. There were no further confirmed sightings until two were collected and sold on eBay in 2018. A live female was found and filmed for the first time in 2019. Description Female Wallace's giant bee is a black resin bee with well developed and large jaws. The species exhibits strong sexual dimorphism: females may reach a length of , with a wingspan of , but males only grow to about long. Only females have large jaws. M. pluto is believed to be the largest living bee species, and remains the largest extant bee species described. It is \\"as long as an adult's thumb\\". Wallace's giant bee is easily distinguished from other bees due to its large size and jaws, but also a notable white band on the abdomen. Distribution and habitat Wallace's giant bee has only been reported from three islands of the North Moluccas in Indonesia: Bacan, Halmahera and Tidore. Very little is known about its distribution and habitat requirements, although it is thought that it is restricted to primary lowland forests. The islands have become home to oil palm plantations that now occupy much of the former native habitat. This has caused the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to label this species as Vulnerable. Discovery and rediscovery The species was originally collected by Alfred Russel Wallace in 1858, and given the common name \\"Wallace's giant bee\\"; it is also known as the \\"giant mason bee\\". It was thought to be extinct until it was rediscovered in 1981 by Adam C. Messer, an American entomologist, who found six nests on the island of Bacan and other nearby islands. The bee is among the 25 \\"most wanted\\" lost species that are the focus of Global Wildlife Conservation's \\"Search for Lost Species\\" initiative. After 1981, the bee was not observed in the wild for the next 37 years. In 2018, two specimens were collected in Indonesia, one on Bacan in February and the other on Halmahera in September. They were subsequently sold on eBay, highlighting the lack of protection that is afforded to the rare species. In 2019, a single female was found by Clay Bolt, living in a termite nest in Indonesia. This specimen was filmed and photographed before being released. Ecology Wallace's giant bees build communal nests inside active nests of the tree-dwelling termite Microcerotermes amboinensis, which may have served to hide their existence even from island residents. The bee uses tree resin to build compartments inside the termite nest, which protects its galleries. Female bees leave their nests repeatedly to forage for resin, which comes frequently from Anisoptera thurifera. The bee's large jaws assist in resin gathering: the female makes large balls of resin which are held between the jaws. The association of the bee with the termite may be obligate.

Background While serving several sentences for rape, kidnapping, one count of first degree murder, and aggravated assault, Ehrlich Anthony Coker escaped from prison. He broke into Allen and Elnita Carver's home near Waycross, Georgia; raped Elnita Carver, and stole the family's vehicle. Coker was convicted of rape, armed robbery, and the other offenses. He was sentenced to death on the rape charge after the jury found two of the aggravating circumstances present for imposing such a sentence: the rape was committed by a person with prior convictions for capital felonies, and the rape was committed in the course of committing another capital felony, the armed robbery. The Supreme Court of Georgia upheld the death sentence.Coker v. State, 234 Ga. 555, Decision =Plurality= Justice Byron White Justice White wrote the plurality opinion,Coker, 433 U.S. at 586-600. on behalf of Justices Stewart, Blackmun, and Stevens. The Court's proportionality jurisprudence is informed by objective evidence, which comes from the laws enacted by state legislatures and the behavior of sentencing juries. The Court had found that it was always a minority of states that allowed the death penalty for rape.\\"A Cruel and Unusual Punishment\\", The Nation In 1925, 18 of 48 states, the District of Columbia, and the federal government authorized the death penalty for rape of an adult woman. In 1963, the figure was 17 of 50 states, almost all of them in the Southern and Western United States, as well as the District of Columbia and the federal government.Death As A Penalty For Rape By 1971, on the eve of the Court's Furman decision, the number of jurisdictions supporting the death penalty for rape of an adult woman had declined to 16 states and the federal government. When Furman forced the states to rewrite their capital sentencing laws, only three states (Georgia, North Carolina, and Louisiana) retained the death penalty for rape of an adult woman.Three more (Mississippi, Florida and Tennessee) authorized the death penalty for child rape. In 1976, the capital sentencing laws of North Carolina and Louisiana were struck down for a different reason. In response to the reversals, the legislatures of North Carolina and Louisiana did not retain the death penalty for rape. Thus, at the time of the Coker decision, only Georgia retained the death penalty for the crime of rape of an adult woman. At the time of decision, the Supreme Court of Georgia had reviewed 63 rape cases. Only six of these involved a death sentence. The Georgia court had set aside one, leaving five death sentences for rape intact from among all the rape convictions obtained since Furman. From the statistical evidence, the Court concluded that in at least 90% of rape cases, the jury did not impose a death sentence. The objective evidence, state death penalty laws, and behavior of juries, suggested that the death penalty for rape was rare.Coker, 433 U.S. at 596-597. But objective evidence does not dictate the outcome of the Court's proportionality analysis. The Court also brings to bear its estimation of how the death penalty in the circumstances in question would serve the goals of retribution and deterrence. Rape is a serious crime: \\"short of homicide, it is the ultimate violation of self.\\" It typically involves violence and injury, both physical and psychological, but the Court denied that it involves \\"serious\\" injury:Coker, 433 U.S. at 598. \\"Rape is without doubt deserving of serious punishment; but in terms of moral depravity and of the injury to the person and to the public, it does not compare with murder, which does involve the unjustified taking of human life.\\" In light of such facts, the Court concluded that death was an excessive punishment for \\"the rapist who, as such, does not take human life.\\" The fact that the jury had found that two aggravating factors applied to Coker's crime (his prior convictions and the fact that the rape was committed during the course of a robbery) did not change the Court's conclusion. The rape may have been committed during the course of another crime and by a hardened criminal, but the rape did not escalate into a killing.Coker, 433 U.S. at 599. Finally, even a deliberate killing does not merit a death sentence under Georgia law without the finding of aggravating factors.Coker, 433 U.S. at 600. =Concurring opinion= Justices Brennan and Marshall concurred in the judgment because the case struck down a death penalty, in keeping with their view that the death penalty is per se cruel and unusual punishment.Coker, 433 U.S. at 600-601. =Concurring/dissenting= Justice Powell concurred in the judgment, but he emphasized that the death penalty may be appropriate for rape if there are aggravating circumstances.Coker, 433 U.S. at 601-602 (Powell, J., concurring/dissenting). =Dissenting= Chief Justice Burger, joined by Justice Rehnquist, dissented because he believed that the proportionality principle the Court had engrafted onto the Eighth Amendment encroached too much on the legislative power of the states. Burger preferred to concentrate on the narrow facts of the case: was it proper for Georgia to impose the death penalty on Coker, a man who had escaped from prison while serving a sentence for murder and raped another young woman? \\"Whatever one's view may be as to the State's constitutional power to impose the death penalty upon a rapist who stands before the court convicted for the first time, this case reveals a chronic rapist whose continuing danger to the community is abundantly clear.\\" Burger defended a state's prerogative to impose additional punishment for recidivists, including a death sentence for prisoners who commit crimes. Congress had enacted an early three-strikes law, and the federal crime of assault on a mail carrier carried a stiffer penalty for a second such offense. Other states also carried harsher penalties for \\"habitual criminality.\\" He believed that \\"the Eighth Amendment does not prevent the State from taking an individual's 'well-demonstrated propensity for life- endangering behavior' into account in devising punitive measures which will prevent inflicting further harm upon innocent victims.\\" If the Court was serious about sanctioning the continued use of the death penalty, it should allow states to use it in appropriate circumstances. Furthermore, rape is a heinous crime: \\"A rapist not only violates a victim's privacy and personal integrity, but inevitably causes serious psychological as well as physical harm in the process. The long-range effect upon the victim's life and health is likely to be irreparable; it is impossible to measure the harm which results.\\" He disagreed with the Court's conclusion that there were no circumstances under which it was a proportional response to crime. Such a conclusion turned the Court into \\"the ultimate arbiter of the standards of criminal responsibility in diverse areas of the criminal law throughout the country.\\" That was an inappropriate role for the Court to assume in the American federal system. He felt that Furman had injected enough uncertainty into the debate over capital punishment; it was more expedient to allow subsequent legislative developments to evolve. Burger disagreed with the Court's assessment of the retribution and deterrence value of the death penalty for rape. He thought that the death penalty might deter at least one prospective rapist. It might encourage victims to report the crime. It might increase the general feeling of security among members of the community. The fact that the magnitude of the harm caused by the murderer is greater than that caused by the rapist was beside the point. The Eighth Amendment was not the Code of Hammurabi; if \\"innocent life and limb are to be preserved I see no constitutional barrier in punishing by death all who engage in... criminal activity which consistently poses serious danger of death or serious bodily harm.\\" Thus, the Court had no place dictating how the states might make law in the criminal arena. Aftermath The direct consequence was the overturning of the Georgia death sentences of Coker and five other rapists, including John W. Hooks, John W. Eberheart, Donald Boyer, and William J. Hughes. Florida, Mississippi, and Tennessee had capital rape statutes authorizing the death penalty or life imprisonment for the rape of children. The Tennessee Supreme Court overturned its child rape statutes in 1977 because of Woodson (1976). In 1977 Florida sentenced to death child rapist William H. Shue. The state's Supreme Court vacated the sentence in 1978 and ordered him returned to the Ocala Circuit Court for resentencing. While declining to rule on the overall question of capital punishment for child rape, the court said there had been no showing in Shue's case of \\"extraordinary cruelty or of violence or injury to the young victims.\\" The court noted that Judge Swigert had imposed the death penalty, although the jury that had convicted Shue had sentenced him to life imprisonment. Daniel Coler was sentenced to death in 1978 in Florida for the rape of his daughter as a child. Coler's death sentence was overturned in 1982 because the court found that irrelevant and prejudicial testimony had been introduced in his case, preventing a fair trial. The state said that it would not retry him, as the victim did not want to testify and the other chief witness had died in an auto accident. Coler was set free after 4 1/2 years on death row. On the basis of Coker, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that Florida capital child rape statutes were unconstitutional in the Robert L. Buford case of 1981 and the Lucious L. Andrews case in 1983. Before his sentence was overturned, Andrews was the last man on death row who had not murdered anyone. The Mississippi Supreme Court overturned Mississippi capital rape statutes in 1989, in its ruling in Leatherwood v. State. It dismissed Alfred D. Leatherwood's death sentence on another basis, the fact that the Louisiana capital aggravators were written to apply only to capital murder and not to rape. The main consequence of Coker was that the death penalty was largely restricted to crimes in which the defendant caused the death of another human being. Until Kennedy v. Louisiana, some states were testing the limit of this restriction by enacting death penalty statutes for repeat child rapists. In terms of the Court's capital punishment jurisprudence, Coker signaled the Court's commitment to employing a robust proportionality test for deciding when the death penalty would be an appropriate punishment. The Court would later use this same proportionality test to evaluate the propriety of the death penalty for felony murder (except for the actual killer), mentally retarded offenders, juvenile offenders, and eventually all nonhomicide crimes and crimes against the state. =Coker= Erlich Coker (his given name is also spelled as Ehrlech, according to the Georgia Department of Corrections; under the GDC ID 0000379279) is still serving multiple life sentences as of 2013 at the Phillips State Prison, Georgia.Offender Query =Kennedy case= Kennedy v. Louisiana was a decision by the Louisiana Supreme Court that reached the United States Supreme Court; its litigation expanded the Coker decision. On May 22, 2007, the Louisiana Supreme Court held that it is constitutional to impose the death penalty for rape if the victim is a child. Ruling on an appeal brought in the case of defendant Patrick Kennedy, Justice Jeffrey Victory wrote for the court that the Louisiana law allowing the imposition of the death penalty under those circumstances was consistent with Coker because an aggravating circumstance, the age of the victim, justified the death penalty. The case was struck down by the US Supreme Court in Kennedy v. Louisiana (2008), thus expanding Coker. The court ruled that the death penalty is unconstitutional in all cases that do not involve murder or crimes against the State.

His Japanese decorations included Order of the Golden Kite (1st class) and Order of the Chrysanthemum. Biography Hasegawa was born as the son of a samurai fencing master in the Iwakuni sub- fief of Ch≈çsh≈´ (present-day Yamaguchi Prefecture), Hasegawa served under the Ch≈çsh≈´ forces during the Boshin War from January until March 1868 during the Meiji Restoration which overthrew the Tokugawa shogunate. Upon the formation of the Imperial Japanese Army in 1871, Hasegawa was commissioned a captain. Later, as a major, he was given command of a regiment during the Satsuma Rebellion, and saw action at the relief of Kumamoto Castle on 14 April 1877. He traveled to France as military attach√© in 1885 to study European military strategy, military tactics and equipment. Upon his return to Japan the following year, Hasegawa was promoted to major general. During the First Sino- Japanese War, Hasegawa won distinction for valor on behalf of his 12th Infantry Brigade at the Battle of Pyongyang on 15 September 1894 and in skirmishes around Haicheng from December 1894 until January 1895. After the war, he was ennobled with the title of danshaku (baron) under the kazoku peerage system. During the Russo-Japanese War, Hasegawa was assigned to the First Army under General Kuroki Tamemoto as commander of the Imperial Guards Division in the spring of 1904. He later fought with distinction at the Battle of the Yalu on 30 April ‚Äì 1 May 1904, and was soon after promoted to general in June 1904. He was commander of the Korea Garrison Army from September 1904 until December 1908. In 1907, Hasegawa was elevated to the title of shishaku (viscount).Nussbaum, Louis-Fr√©d√©ric. (2005). \\"Hasegawa Yoshimishi\\" in . Hasegawa was appointed Chief of Staff of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff in 1912. He forced War Minister Uehara Y≈´saku to resign over Prime Minister Saionji Kinmochi's tight fiscal policy and attempted revision of the system whereby only active duty officers would be able to serve as Ministers of War and Navy. The collapse of Saionji‚Äôs government was known as the \\"Taish≈ç Political Crisis\\". In 1915, Hasegawa was awarded the title of field marshal, and was elevated to the title of hakushaku (count) in 1916. From October 1916, he served as the second Japanese Governor-General of Korea, and was later criticized for his military approach to the Samil Independence Movement. Hasegawa died in 1924.

Congruence between the orange and green ones is established by the facts that side BC corresponds to (in this case of congruence, equals in length) JK, CD corresponds to KL, DA corresponds to LI, and AB corresponds to IJ, while angle C corresponds to (equals) angle K, D corresponds to L, A corresponds to I, and B corresponds to J. In geometry, the tests for congruence and similarity involve comparing corresponding sides and corresponding angles of polygons. In these tests, each side and each angle in one polygon is paired with a side or angle in the second polygon, taking care to preserve the order of adjacency. For example, if one polygon has sequential sides a, b, c, d, and e and the other has sequential sides v, w, x, y, and z, and if b and w are corresponding sides, then side a (adjacent to b) must correspond to either v or x (both adjacent to w). If a and v correspond to each other, then c corresponds to x, d corresponds to y, and e corresponds to z; hence the ith element of the sequence abcde corresponds to the ith element of the sequence vwxyz for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\\\. On the other hand, if in addition to b corresponding to w we have c corresponding to v, then the ith element of abcde corresponds to the ith element of the reverse sequence xwvzy. Congruence tests look for all pairs of corresponding sides to be equal in length, though except in the case of the triangle this is not sufficient to establish congruence (as exemplified by a square and a rhombus that have the same side length). Similarity tests look at whether the ratios of the lengths of each pair of corresponding sides are equal, though again this is not sufficient. In either case equality of corresponding angles is also necessary; equality (or proportionality) of corresponding sides combined with equality of corresponding angles is necessary and sufficient for congruence (or similarity). The corresponding angles as well as the corresponding sides are defined as appearing in the same sequence, so for example if in a polygon with the side sequence abcde and another with the corresponding side sequence vwxyz we have vertex angle A appearing between sides a and b then its corresponding vertex angle V must appear between sides v and w.

This rural landmark with a length of is the longest bridge on the river. It was second longest bridge in Ireland and the third longest rail bridge in the British Isles. Designed by Sir Benjamin Baker and built by the firm of Sir William Arrol. It is known locally as Barrow bridge. Part of a development to improve cross-channel passenger services. Incorporating an 1887 viaduct, the steel truss single track bridge was built between 1902 and 1906 by English and Irish railway companies, it operated passenger services between Rosslare Harbour and Waterford until 2010. It is maintained by Iarnr√≥d √âireann, the Irish rail operator. This bridge is one of six rail bridges of 45 bridges on the Barrow. It spans the river just upstream from its confluence with another of the three sisters the River Suir. Close to Great Island Power Station near Cheekpoint. It is the last bridge on the river Barrow and opens approximately twice daily to permit shipping and yachts to pass upstream to New Ross. History It is an important element of the early twentieth-century transport heritage of Kilkenny and Wexford. Part of the development of the Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway. Built as a joint venture between the \\"Fishguard and Rosslare Railways & Harbors Company (FRR + H Co)\\" and the Great Southern and Western and Great Western. To improve cross- channel passenger services the Rosslare Strand to Waterford. After the Tay Bridge and Forth Bridge it was the third longest rail bridge in Britain and Ireland.. The New Ross branch had opened in 1887 and in 1904 it was extended from New Ross to Waterford, this allowed connection with the Great Southern and Great Western and the south of Ireland. It carried the railway from Waterford to Wexford and on to Rosslare Harbour. The line followed the left bank of the river Suir over its course through County Kilkenny. This route contains four bridges, the Barrow Viaduct and three single span over minor streams. The line was built from 1902 and the bridge was reopened by 1906. Design This elegant and pragmatic bridge represents a striking rural landmark on the River Barrow. Designed by the consulting engineer to the Rosslare & Waterford Railway, Sir Benjamin Baker. Baker had been responsible, with Sir John Fowler, for the design of the Forth Rail Bridge, and had designed the Keady viaduct and Tassagh viaduct. An 1887 viaduct built to designs prepared by Dixon (fl. 1887) and Alfred Thorne (fl. 1887-96) was incorporated the fabric of the 1906 railway bridge. The steel bridge was supplied and built by the building contractor Sir William Arrol Sir William Arrol and Co.. The Glaswegian firm were engineers and bridge builders, of Dalmarnock, Scotland. Arrol had also worked on the Forth Rail Bridge. A rural landmark on the Barrow it is of identical design to the Suir Viaduct. The track used 87lb bullhead rail. The timber sleepers were \\"laid in 45-foot lengths\\". The signalling system was Electric Train Staff (ETS) with lower quadrant semaphore signals. This single track was the longest railway bridge in Ireland at a length of . Description  This bridge is one of six rail bridges crossing the Barrow and is one of 45 bridges on the river. The single track steel railway bridge incorporated an earlier 1887 viaduct. On the rail line there is a short tunnel on the Kilkenny side and a tunnel of on the Wexford side. It stands above the high water mark, Each of its 13 main spans of are supported on twin cast iron piers. The two central spans are pivoted to allow boats to pass through, this is a swiveling single drum pier of , and the end spans are .

It connects Pont de Levallois ‚Äì B√©con station in the near northwestern suburbs to Gallieni in the east, where Paris's international bus station is located. After opening as the network's third line in 1904, it was the subject of a number of extensions, with a major restructuring occurring in the eastern section in 1971, with an extension to Gallieni and the conversion of the original terminal branch to Line 3bis. With a length of , Line 3 crosses Paris from west to east completely on the Rive Droite, serving the residential areas of the 17th arrondissement, the Gare Saint- Lazare, important stores and shopping centres, the area around the Place de l'Op√©ra, as well as the east of the city, around R√©publique station. In 2017, it carried 101.4 million passengers, making it the tenth busiest line of the M√©tro network. History =Chronology= *10 October 1904: The first portion of line 3 was opened between P√®re Lachaise cemetery and Villiers. Work took longer than expected because of existing infrastructure. *25 January 1905: The line was extended in the east from P√®re Lachaise to Gambetta. *23 May 1910: The line was extended westbound from Villiers to Pereire. *15 February 1911: The line was extended from Pereire to Porte de Champerret. *27 November 1921: The line was extended eastbound from Gambetta to Porte des Lilas. *24 September 1937: The line was extended from Porte de Champerret to Pont de Levallois. *1967: Line 3 was the first metro line to receive new MF67 rolling stock. It still uses this stock which has been recently renovated. *23 August 1969: Gambetta station is remodelled, absorbing nearby Martin Nadaud station. *23 March 1971: The branch between Gambetta and Porte des Lilas was separated from the line to become the independent Line 3bis. *2 April 1971: The line was extended from Gambetta to Gallieni. =A second east‚Äìwest axis= A 300-series Thomson at R√©publique in 1904 The infrastructure works for Line 3 were auctioned off in six sections on 24 May 1902. The concession was granted to the CMP by the municipal government of Paris on 13 March 1903, but the declaration of public utility was only granted on 26 February 1907. Op√©ra. The vault heading underneath Rue Auber is visible The works were rendered difficult due to the necessary displacement of existing underground infrastructure such as water, gas, and electricity lines, but also because the Line 3 was to cross a number of M√©tro lines, particularly at Op√©ra, where a special pit was built to house the intersection of Lines 3, 7, and 8. This masonry pit was and constructed fully so as to avoid any problems when building subsequent lines. Since the work was situated at the water table, it required concrete pillars made by sinking caissons with compressed air. The work lasted eleven months, from March 1903 to February 1904. Another difficult point of construction was the crossing of the Canal Saint-Martin. To build underneath it, the canal was dried and its vault hanged. In the area of the Place Gambetta, because of the instability of the subsoil, which consisted of waterlogged sand balls, made it necessary to drain the soil, a very delicate operation considering the number of buildings that could be destabilised. Then the side walls were built from masonry shafts that are dark from the outside. =Future plans= Although no funded plans for an extension of Line 3 currently exist, Line 3bis may be merged with Line 7bis to form a new line, possibly named Line 19, which Line 3 would then connect to.

It was founded in 1970 by psychologist David Weikart. The Perry Preschool study has been noted for its \\"large effects on educational attainment, income, criminal activity, and other important life outcomes, sustained well into adulthood\\". The philosophy behind HighScope is based on child development theory and research, originally drawing on the work of Jean Piaget and John Dewey. The curriculum was further developed to incorporate Lev Vygotsky's zone of proximal development and Jerome Bruner's related strategy of adult scaffolding. This method emphasizes the role of adults to support each child at their current developmental level and help them build upon it, under a model of \\"shared control\\" where activities are both child-initiated and adult-guided.Epstein, A. S. Essentials of active learning in preschool. HighScope Press, 2007 The adults working with the children see themselves more as facilitators or partners than as managers or supervisors.  Original Study  The original study was conducted from 1962-1967 in Ypsilanti, Michigan under guidance of psychologist David Weikart and Perry Elementary School principal Charles Eugene Beatty. It was intended to boost the cognitive skills of disadvantaged African American children. Families were randomly assigned to one of two groups: the intervention, and a control group. For 2 years during the regular school year (39 weeks a year), 3-4 year old children would come to a classroom for 2 and a half hours a day. Students worked on projects where \\"they planned tasks, they executed tasks, and then they reviewed the tasks collectively.\\" Teachers also visited the parents and tried to build the parents' engagement with their child. = Results = Results were initially disappointing. By the time children were 10, there wasn't much of a difference in how children in the two groups performed on tests of cognitive ability. Because the study was conducted in the 1960s, researchers have been able to follow the children who went through the Perry Preschool Program through adulthood. Economist and Nobel laureate James Heckman has found that adults from the treatment group were \\"much more likely to graduate high school, much more likely to make earnings, much more likely to go on to college, much less likely to commit crime.\\" Heckman also found multigenerational benefits of the program: children of participants in the program appear to have benefitted. According to Heckman, \\"We find some very strong effects. The children of the participants are healthier. The children of the participants are also earning more. They have better social and emotional skills, are more likely to graduate high school and go on to college, less likely to engage in the criminal justice system, so they're less likely to be incarcerated or even have ever been arrested.\\" = Analysis = Heckman finds that the work with the parents was an important distinguishing component of the program, particularly because the parents stay in the children's lives beyond the program's 2 year duration. He also finds that the quality of the teachers (and consequently the expense of the program) was a critical component that allowed it to succeed in comparison with other, less expensive interventions. Due to the results, the organization Social Projects that Work finds the study as a strong candidate for further research, but warns that the study was relatively small (128 subjects; 123 after dropouts).  Cost Effectiveness  James Heckman estimates that the Perry Project saved society $7 to $12 for every $1 invested, mostly due to reduced crime. HighScope itself reports that for every tax dollar invested in the early care and education program $7 are saved for tax payers by the time the participant is 27 years old, $13 are saved for tax payers by the time the participant is 40 years old, and that there is a $16 total return including increased income to the participants.An Economic Analysis of the Ypsilanti Perry Preschool Project,(Monographs of High/Scope Educ.

The 2011 census figure for the population (from the Office for National Statistics) is 661 people. History Situated between the villages of Welwyn and Knebworth, Woolmer Green was first settled in the Iron Age. The Belgae colonised the area in the 1st century BC, and later it was settled by the Romans. Many Roman artefacts have been found in the surrounding area with a bath house existing at nearby Welwyn. The village was at the junction of two thoroughfares, the Great North Road and another road called Stane Street (or Stone Street) from St Albans. The route of this road runs across the parish along the path of Robbery Bottom Lane, continuing on as a public bridleway to Datchworth and then Braughing, on its eventual way to another major Roman town, Camulodonum, Colchester. Thomas de Wolvesmere is recorded as having lived in a dwelling here in 1297, and his name is considered to have led to the current name of the village. In the Middle Ages part of the village was in Mardleybury Manor, part in Rectory Manor, with the northern part owing allegiance to Broadwater Manor or Knebworth. The village remains at the point where the Districts of North Hertfordshire, East Hertfordshire and Welwyn Hatfield meet. Apart from the trade generated by travellers, life in Woolmer Green was agricultural and feudal until the middle of the nineteenth century. Things started to change, however, when the railway arrived in 1850 (although the nearby station in Knebworth was not opened until 1884 after intervention from Viscount Knebworth). The village school, which was opened a few years after this, obtained much funding from the railway. In 1863, only a gunsmith and a shoemaker were listed in the trade directory. By 1898, when the population of Woolmer Green stood at 363 and that of Knebworth at 382, there were five shops including two beer retailers; no mention in the trade directory of the many 'front room shops'! This level of service persisted until recent years with a general store and Post Office, a baker, a small supermarket and a butcher. These have all now closed. The former Post office was later used as a hair salon, a furniture shop and a wedding dress and suit hire shop which was opened in early 2016. The main road through the centre of the village was the A1 - the Great North Road down which thousands of cattle and sheep were driven 'on the hoof' to London markets each year. The area around Knebworth and Woolmer Green provided what was probably the last overnight stop for the animals and their drovers before they reached London. The majority of the residents of Woolmer Green were dependent on farming and the 1879 harvest, which was the worst of the century, resulted in the leases of many farms in the area being relinquished, and thus labourers not being employed to work on them. At this time there was quite an influx of farmers from Scotland and Cornwall. They must have considered the prospects here to be better than their own, and indeed they were actively lured here by the owners of the local agricultural land, which at that time was largely owned by the big land-owning estates, particularly in this immediate area by the Knebworth Estate. The Woodcarver and his house With the development of motor traffic during the 20th century the village became well known to travellers to and from London on the A1. In particular travellers along the road could not have missed the eccentric and colourful cottage inhabited by the late Harry McDonald, who for many years adorned both the cottage and its garden with inventive carvings of animals and other objects. For a small fee visitors could walk through the garden with its nursery-rhyme and Middle Eastern themed sculptures, many of which were animated by handles, pumps, windmills and various levers. McDonald also carved several official local village signs, and sold his more academically carved work to passing visitors.http://www.hertsmemories.org.uk/content/herts-history/towns-and- villages/woolmer-green/harry-macdonald-the-woodcarver Harry McDonald arrived in Woolmer Green in 1937, having walked from his home town of Bradford in Yorkshire, seeking work. He became known as the Woodcarver of Woolmer Green. The Woodcarver of Woolmer Green: The Story of Harry McDonald. A.O.Head It was subject of a short British Pathe feature in 1955 narrated by Eamonn Andrews. The Woodcarvers Cottage, as it came to be known, was demolished after his death in 1971, although a commemorative plaque was erected in 2010. In 1982 a horse-drawn theatre production 'The Woodcarver Story' by Horse and Bamboo Theatre arrived in the village. They erected a marquee and over several nights performed a production about Harry McDonald's life. On the final night the entire cast and audience made a procession to McDonald's grave in the churchyard. Harry McDonald is buried at the nearby church of St Michael and All Angels. Woolmer Green independence Prior to the millennium year, 2000, Woolmer Green was part of the parish of Welwyn for local government purposes. In that year, however, the parish gained its independence from its neighbour, and the inaugural meeting of the Parish Council was held in May 2000. The first chairman of the new Woolmer Green Parish Council, Judith Watson, was instrumental in achieving the separation. The railway through Woolmer Green The boundary between Woolmer Green and Welwyn parishes is formed by the path of the East Coast Main Line railway. The small viaduct to the south of the Parish, at the end of Robbery Bottom Lane, follows the same basic design as the long Digswell Viaduct. It was designed by William Cubitt and built by Thomas Brassey between 1848 and 1850 for the sum of ¬£4,643. There are seven arches with a height above the roadway of 17m and a length of 60m. The viaduct and the bridges over London Road and Heath Road are all original, dating from when the railway was first built, although they have been strengthened and the parapets raised. Immediately to the south of the viaduct the railway enters the first of two tunnels (with a very short open section in the middle) between Woolmer Green and the station at Welwyn North. The first tunnel heading south was the site of a notorious accident in 1866. There was a temporary railway halt at Woolmer Green during the war which was used by soldiers, but nowadays the nearest station is just down the road at Knebworth, built in 1884 at the request of Viscount Knebworth. Until then the railway was used as a means of transferring manure from all the stables in London to a convenient place in the country. Chutes were constructed so that the manure could be shovelled down on to the roads and the local farmers then picked it up to use as fertiliser. Woolmer Green Village Hall The parish has an excellent modern Village Hall and adjoining sports field which are very actively used by the community. The hall was opened in November 1990 by local celebrity Barry Norman and is licensed for wedding ceremonies. The Village Hall is sometimes used for Fundraising Events. St Michael and All Angels Church Though Sunday services had been held in the school since 1878, many people in Woolmer Green wanted the village to have its own church. This was a wish particularly dear to the heart of the Revd Edwin Hoskyns, who was a curate at Welwyn when part of the school was consecrated as a church. The problem of finding a suitable site for the new church, which was to be dedicated to St Michael and All Angels, was soon solved when Lord Lytton presented the Church authorities with the plot of land at the junction of London Road and Mardleybury Road, which was to prove an ideal site with easy access for the majority of the villagers. The church was designed by Robert Weir Schultz (1860‚Äì1951), a modest example of late Arts and Crafts. The estimated cost was ¬£2500 and the contract was given to Mr E Lawrence of Datchworth. The foundation stone was laid in September 1899 by Lady Lytton who used a silver trowel for the task. It was originally felt that the church should have a tower but it proved impossible to raise the necessary funds. By October 1899 only ¬£1500 had been promised so the decision was taken that only the walls and the roof of the church should be built, and the internal fittings left to be proceeded with as the money came in. It was suggested in the Parish Magazine that the children of the parish should contribute towards the cost of the font: ‚ÄòEach can give very little, but the pennies and halfpennies of 350 children will quickly mount up, and all alike will feel they have a share in the new building.‚Äô The church was to be named St Michael and All Angels in the hope that it would be consecrated at Michaelmas, 29 September 1900. However, it was not until 3 November 1900 that the consecration of the church and burial ground took place. The people of the village no longer needed to ‚Äòmarry and bury‚Äô at Datchworth or Welwyn. The church screen is a significant example of late Arts-and-Crafts design and carving. It is said that the school bell was bought for the church in 1931 at a cost of ¬£10.

Damage estimates of $100,000 were reported, as well as one death and over 1,000 drug overdoses. After the festival the city of Sedalia only had a few weeks to clean up for the Missouri State fair, so helicopters were used for spraying lime over the fairgrounds as a precaution against the possible outbreak of disease. On the ground, bulldozers scraped up the topsoil, which was (reportedly) littered with discarded drug paraphernalia and gnawed cobs of corn from a neighboring field along with mountains of contaminated dirt and garbage which were hauled to the county landfills. Meanwhile, festival-goers crowded the Interstate 70 rest stops to catch up on sleep lost during the weekend. Tents, cots and sleeping bags were spread throughout rest stops all along the highway. In early September of that year, the city council banned future rock concerts in the city. Senate Committee report The Missouri Senate met in October 1974 and discussed the events of the music festival in the committee report. The report states that, \\"The Ozark Music Festival can only be described as a disaster. It became a haven for drug pushers who were attracted from throughout the United States.

The species was first described by Johann Siegfried Hufnagel in 1766. It is a common, sometimes abundant, European species. It is found in most of Europe except northernmost Fennoscandia and the southern parts of the Iberian Peninsula and Greece. The species is also found in Anatolia, Turkestan, Western Asia and Central Asia, Siberia and Mongolia. In the Alps it is found up to heights of 2,500 meters. The smaller subspecies sardoa is found on Sardinia and Corsica. This species has a wingspan of 46 to 54 mm, the forewings varying from pale greyish brown to almost black and cryptically patterned. All but the darkest individuals usually have an obvious black mark close to the dorsum and a pale zigzag subterminal line.

The district headquarter is Hassan. Hassan District contains the cities of Hassan,Arsikere,Channarayapatna, Belur, Holenarasipura,Sakleshpur,Alur and Arkalgud.  Governance  Current Member of Parliament from Hassan is Prajwal Revanna who is also one of the youngest Lok Sabha member and is grandson of former Prime Minister of India H. D. Deve Gowda. History Hassan district was the seat of the Hoysala Empire which at its peak ruled large parts of south India from Belur as its early capital and Halebidu as its later capital during the period 1000 - 1334 CE. The district is named Hassan after the Goddess \\"Haasanamba\\", the goddess and presiding deity of the town. The history of Hassan district is essentially the history of two of the well known dynasties that have ruled Karnataka, the Western Ganga Dynasty of Talkad (350 - 999 CE) and the Hoysala Empire (1000 - 1334 CE). In the 15th and 16th centuries, the Vijayanagar kings patronised Chennakesava of Belur as their family deity. It was also ruled by Adilshahis of Bijapur and Mughal Empire after decline of the Vijayanagar. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Hassan became a land of contention between the Keladi Nayakas of Shimoga and the Mysore Kingdom. It finally merged as an independent Mysore kingdom. =Modern= During the 14th century, invasions by the Sultanate of Delhi weakened the Hoysala state, and the district became part of the Vijayanagara Empire.Meyer, Sir William Stevenson. The Imperial Gazetteer of India. Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1908-1931. v. 13, p. 64. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the Vijayanagar kings patronised Chennakesava of Belur as their family deity. It was also ruled by Adilshahis of Bijapur and Mughal Empire after decline of the Vijayanagar. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Hassan became a land of contention between the Keladi Nayakas of Shimoga and the Mysore Kingdom. In 1648 the Mysore rulers built Channarayapatna fort by treaty with the sultans of Bijapur. A peace treaty was concluded between the Mysore and Keladi rulers in 1694. The district remained part of the Mysore Kingdom at the conclusion of the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War in 1799. Hassan District and its current boundaries date to the 1860s, when the Mysore Kingdom was organized into 8 districts, and the districts further divided into taluks.Meyer, Sir William Stevenson, et al. The Imperial Gazetteer of India. Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1908-1931. v. 18, p. 228. The district had a population of 518,987 in the 1871 census. A famine from 1876 to 1878 reduced the population to 428,344 by 1881. The population was 511,975 in 1891, and 568,919 in 1901. The 1901 census recorded 541,531 Hindus, 16,668 Muslims, 5035 Animists, 3795 Christians, 1874 Jains, and 16 others. The district had 14 towns, and 2546 villages.Meyer, Sir William Stevenson. The Imperial Gazetteer of India. Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1908-1931. v. 13, pp 64-65. Reserve forests were established in the 19th century, and covered an area of 185 square miles in the district. The forests, with their area in square miles, were: Kempuhole Ghat (16), Kaganeri Ghati (2), Kabbinale Ghat (23), Bisale Ghat (23), Vijayapur (5), Hirikalgudda (92), Doddabetta (3), Burdalbore (3), Hagare (3), Byaba (2), Sige-gudda (8), Baisur (1), Mallappan-betta (1), and Vantigudda (1). The state established five sandalwood forests, totaling three square miles: Kemmanbore (232 acres), Gubbi (428 acres), Gadagere (554 acres), Gubbi (1000 acres), and Nakalgud (185 acres).Rice, B.

XII. Edinburgh: William Blackwood and Sons, 1883, 1884; reprinted 2005 by the Lawbook Exchange Numerous former members of the UK armed forces had fought in the South American wars of independence against Spain. In those conflicts, trained officers of what was then regarded as the strongest military in the world successfully organised insurgents against Spain and caused major headaches for the Spanish expeditionary forces. Ultimately, Spain lost most of her territorial possessions in the Western Hemisphere and Anglo-Spanish relations were left strained for several decades. A law was passed in 181959 Geo. 3 c. 69 to prohibit British subjects from participating in foreign wars, but during the American Civil War it was found to be ineffective.Kenny, C. Outlines of Criminal Law (Cambridge University Press, 1936), 15th edition, p. 378 On 19 July 1870 Napoleon III of France declared war on the Kingdom of Prussia. The outbreak of hostilities put the UK in a delicate diplomatic position. Although relations between the UK and France had steadily improved since the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the UK's relations with Prussia were also close at the time due to the then-recent marriage of Queen Victoria's eldest daughter to Prussian Crown Prince Frederick. Following the French declaration of war public opinion in the UK was on the side of Prussia and her German allies, and in other European states (especially Italy) men attempted to volunteer in considerable numbers to fight on the Prussian side. In addition, contrary to the eventual result of the conflict, many neutral military observers thought the French Empire to be stronger than Prussia. Given such considerations, the British government was keen on maintaining neutrality in the conflict at all costs and wary of any actions by its subjects that might have antagonised Napoleon III. The Act made it a crime for any subject of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland to enlist themselves in the military of any foreign power at war with any state with which the UK was at peace. Failure The last successful prosecution occurred in 1896 in the Leander Starr Jameson trial. A Privy Council report claimed that no successful prosecutions came from the act, however this report must have predated the Jameson trial. Problems with evidence prevented the British government from convicting enlistees to the French Foreign Legion or those thousands who joined the fight against Francisco Franco in Spain.http://tcbh.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/10/1/52 The Privy Council has claimed the act to be an \\"antiquated piece of legislation...passed on the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian war.\\"http://www.oup.co.uk/pdf/1-84-174183-3.pdf Canada The British Foreign Enlistment Act of 1870 applied throughout the British Empire, although it was replaced by different legislation as time went on. The statute was not repealed in Canada until 1937 due to concerns that the statute would not allow for the Canadian government to successfully convict the Communist Party of Canada's ongoing effort to recruit Canadians for the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War. The Canadian Foreign Enlistment Act of 1937 was passed in April 1937 and formally applied to circumstances in Spain by an order-in- council in July 1937. An investigation was conducted, prosecutors were hired, and warrants were issued for the arrest of participants in the recruiting network, but ultimately there were no prosecutions under the statute. The Canadian Foreign Enlistment Act of 1937 remains a valid statute.

History  In 1965 the State of Victoria passed a law, the Psychological Practices Act, 1965, banning the use of the E-meter and teaching Scientology for money. Considering Scientology to be a form of psychology, it required anyone practising psychology to be registered with a newly established Victorian Psychological Council. However, since the Act's definition of psychology was broad enough to include the pastoral counselling traditionally done by priests and ministers of religion, any religious denomination recognised by the Australian government under the federal Marriage Act was exempted from its provisions. The Scientology organisation in Spring Street, Melbourne, closed in response to this law. Similar laws were later passed in Western Australia in 1968 (the Scientology Act) and South Australia (the Psychological Practices Act) in 1973. The Church changed its name to \\"Church of the New Faith\\" and remained active in these two States. In November 1968, two Australian Scientologists who had been working at Saint Hill, Ian and Judith Tampion, set up a mission of the Church of the New Faith in an inner suburb of Melbourne. They held meetings and sold books, but Scientologists in Melbourne would travel to Adelaide, South Australia for training. The Church of the New Faith was incorporated in Adelaide on 18 June 1969L. Ron Hubbard (1976) Modern Management Technology Defined p.78 In 1972, Western Australia repealed its Scientology Act. In January 1973, the newly elected federal Labor government recognised Scientology as a religious denomination under the Marriage Act, allowing Scientology ministers to conduct marriages and making them effectively exempt from the provisions of Victoria's Psychological Practices Act. The mission in Melbourne now became a fully functional Church offering training and counselling to the public. However, Victoria's law remained active, though the Victorian Scientology organisation was incorporated in South Australia. In 1980, the Victorian branch of the Church of the New Faith applied for exemption from payroll tax. (The Church had exemption already in all other states where it operated). The Commissioner of Pay-Roll Tax rejected the application. The Church appealed against the decision, and lost on 18 December 1980. The Church lodged a Victorian Supreme Court appeal against this on 24 February 1981, which the full Supreme Court rejected on 5 May 1982. Around this time, the Victorian Psychological Practices Act was becoming controversial, and was seen by many to be counter- productive. On 25 February 1981, officials of major religions urged repeal of the Act. Later, leading Churchmen including heads of Theological Colleges had signed a petition: \\"to remove all prohibitive sections aimed at members of the Church of Scientology purely on religious grounds. It further asks 'that in future no legislation be passed which discriminates against any minority because of its beliefs'\\".The Age newspaper (Melbourne), Sat 18 April 1981, page 3 The Victorian Minister for Health, Tom Roper, explained to the Legislative Assembly that the Act was not being enforced in much of Australia. The Church of Scientology was flourishing in spite of the legislation banning its practice. Roper urged the lawmakers that in the future they shouldn't single out a minority group for legislation \\"in the way the Psychological Practices Act discriminates against Scientology.\\"Hansard, Victoria, House of Assembly Pages 719‚Äì720, 3 June 1982. The Liberal and National Parties did not oppose the Labor Government's action to repeal the Psychological Practices Act. The Age (Melbourne), Fri 25 Jun 1982, p10 The Act was amended by the Psychologists Registration (Scientology) Act, 1982 to remove all references to Scientology on 24 June 1982 and was repealed in 1987. This did not, however, give the Church tax exempt status in Victoria. The Church appealed against the payroll decision to the High Court on 9 November 1982 and the case was accepted. They won the case (Church of the New Faith v. Commissioner of Pay- Roll Tax (Victoria)) in late 1983 and immediately started operating as the Church of Scientology once more, with confirmed status as a tax-exempt religion.. Subsequently in 2013, the UK Supreme Court affirmed the religious status of Scientology in that country, and credited the Australian High Court case judgment of Wilson and Deane as the \\"most helpful\\" of various international cases in defining the characteristics of religion. https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2013-0030-judgment.pdf paragraphs 40-49 and esp page 18 paragraph 57 Victoria's Psychological Practices Act was finally repealed by the Psychologists Registration Act, 1987.[web.archive.org/web/20070615021704/ Psychologists Registration Act, 1987] The South Australian Psychological Practices Act has remained in force and regulates the activities of hypnotists and psychologists in that State.

In its simplest sense, they might be considered texts that 'sum up' knowledge in a field, such as the compendiums of theology, philosophy and canon law. Their function during the Middle ages was largely as manuals or handbooks of necessary knowledge used by individuals who would not advance their studies any further. Features It was a kind of encyclopedia that developed a matter about Law, Theology or Philosophy most of all. Matters were divided in a more detailed way as it was in the tractatus (treatise), since they were divided into quaestiones (questions) and these ones were also divided into articles. The articles had the following structure: #Title of the article as a question and showing two different positions (disputatio). #Objections or arguments against one of the alternatives, specially the one that defended the author. #Arguments in favor of such an alternative, based on the Bible, the Holy Fathers and so on. #Solution, that includes arguments that combine faith and reason and that express the author's thought. #The sententia or answer to the question, that consists in the refutation of the initial objections against the author's solution.Mateu Ibars, Josefina.

Others consider that the first in point of time is \\"De Trinitate\\" by St. Hilary of Poitiers. The distinction has also been accorded to Radulfus Ardens, an eleventh-century theologian and preacher, a native of Beaulieu, author of a comprehensive \\"Speculum Universale\\", still in Manuscript. In this wide sense of the word, however, the encyclopedic treatises of St. Isidore of Seville, Rabanus Maurus etc., entitled \\"De Etymologiis\\" or \\"De Universo\\" might also be considered to be summaries of theology and philosophy. In the stricter sense of the word, \\"Summa\\" is applied to the more technical systematic compendiums which began to appear in the twelfth century. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the form was invented by the grammarian Peter Helias.Literary Forms of Medieval Philosophy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) An alternative title is \\"Sentences\\" (Latin Libri Sententiarum), the diminutive, \\"Summul√¶\\", being of later origin. What is peculiar to \\"summists\\" or \\"sententiaries\\", as the authors of these works are called, is the adoption of the method first suggested by Gerbert in his \\"De Rationali et Ratione Uti\\", and used by Abelard in his \\"Sic et Non\\", consisting in an exposition of contradictory views, the affirmative and negative. Progress towards the final form of the thirteenth- century \\"Summ√¶\\" is marked by the greater care which was taken, as time went on, to explain in a systematic manner the apparent contradiction among the conflicting opinions presented. Besides this method of exposition, the twelfth-century summists adopted dialectic definitely as a means of elucidating, not only philosophical, but also theological truth. Finally the summists adopted more or less unanimously a fixed division of the field of theology and philosophy, and adhered more or less closely to a definite order of topics. Here, of course, there was room for individual preferences in the matter of arrangement and sequence of problems, as we see when we compare with one another the \\"Summ√¶\\" even of the latest period of Scholasticism. The first great summist was Peter Lombard (died 1160), author of the Books of Sentences and surnamed \\"Master of Sentences\\". The order of topics in the Books of Sentences is as follows: In the first place, the topics are divided into res and signa, or things and signs. \\"Things\\" are subdivided into: the object of our happiness, God ‚Äî to this topic Peter devotes the first book; means of attaining this object, viz., creatures ‚Äî the topic treated in the second book; virtues, men and angels, that is, special means of happiness and subjects of happiness ‚Äî the topic of the third book; the fourth book is devoted to signs: the sacraments. How far Peter Lombard was influenced by earlier summists, such as Robert Pullen, Hugh of St. Victor and the author of the \\"Summa Sententiarum\\" which was immediately inspired by Abelard's work, historians have not determined. It is generally admitted that the Lombard was not entirely original. He deserves his renown as the first great summist chiefly because, in spite of the opposition which his work met during his lifetime, its influence grew greater in time, until in the thirteenth century it was universally adopted as a text. Notwithstanding all that hostile critics of Scholasticism have said about the dryness and unattractiveness of the medieval \\"Summ√¶\\", these works have many merits from the point of view of pedagogy, and a philosophical school which supplements, as Scholasticism did, the compendious treatment of the \\"Summ√¶\\", with the looser form of treatment of the \\"Qu√¶stiones Disputat√¶\\" and the \\"Opuscula\\", unites in its method of writing the advantages which modern philosophy derives from the combination of textbook and doctor's dissertation. The Summa Theologica of St. Thomas Aquinas, begun when Aquinas was Regent Master at the studium provinciale at Santa Sabina the forerunner of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum, is often considered the most perfect specimen of this kind of literature. The term \\"Summul√¶\\" was used, for the most part, to designate the logical compendiums which came to be adopted as texts in the schools during the thirteenth century. The best known of these is the \\"Summul√¶ Logicales\\" of Peter Hispanus, afterwards Pope John XXI. Dominican works Manuals of theology and more especially manuals, or summae, on penance for the use of confessors were composed in great numbers. The oldest Dominican commentaries on the \\"Sentences\\" are those of Roland of Cremona, Hugh of Saint Cher, Richard Fitzacre, Robert of Kilwardby and Albertus Magnus. The series begins with the year 1230 if not earlier and the last are prior to the middle of the thirteenth century.Mandonnet, Siger de Brabant, I, 53. The \\"Summa\\" of St. Thomas (1265‚Äì75) is still the masterpiece of theology. The monumental work of Albertus Magnus is unfinished. The \\"Summa de bono\\" of Ulrich of Strasburg (d. 1277), a disciple of Albert is still unedited, but is of interest to the historian of the thought of the thirteenth century.Grabmann, \\"Studien ueber Ulrich von Strassburg\\" in \\"Zeitschrift f√ºr Kathol. Theol.\\", XXIX, 1905, 82. The theological summa of St. Antoninus is highly esteemed by moralists and economists.Ilgner, \\"Die Volkswirtschaftlichen Anschauungen: Antonins von Florenz\\", Paderborn, 1904. The \\"Compendium theologic√¶ veritatis\\" of Hugh Ripelin of Strasburg (d. 1268) is the most widespread and famous manual of the Middle Ages.Mandonnet, \\"Des √©crits authentiques de St. Thomas\\", Fribourg, 1910, p. 86. The chief manual of confessors is that of Paul of Hungary composed for the Brothers of St. Nicholas of Bologna (1220‚Äì21) and edited without mention of the author in the \\"Bibliotheca Casinensis\\"IV, 1880, 191. and with false assignment of authorship by Raymund Duellius.\\"Miscellan.

The \\"Summa de Poenitentia\\" of Raymond of Pennafort, composed in 1235, was a classic during the Middle Ages and was one of the works of which the manuscripts were most multiplied. The \\"Summa Confessorum\\" of John of Freiburg (d. 1314) is, according to F. von Schulte, the most perfect product of this class of literature. The Pisan Bartolommeo of San Concordio has left us a \\"Summa Casuum\\" composed in 1338, in which the matter is arranged in alphabetical order. It was very successful in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The manuals for confessors of John Nieder (d. 1438), St. Antoninus, Archbishop of Florence (d. 1459), and Girolamo Savonarola (d. 1498) were much esteemed in their timeQu√©tif-Echard, \\"Script. Ord.

Law In the area of Law, the summa is a practical and didactic genre, that was developed from the methodology of the gloss. It was divided into two different literary genres: the summa (derived from the similia), and the questio legitima (derived from the contraria). The summa was born in the minor Law schools whose aim was to instruct their students with easy summaries of the Justinian codes. In order to achieve this goal, easy, simple and systematic summaries of whole works were made, and the literary genre of the summae in the legal area was born. The summae were developed specially in the civil law schools of Occitanie specially regarding Justinian's Institutiones. =Some important legal summae= *Azo of Bologna's Summa Codicis. *Summa Codicis written in Occitan and known as Lo Codi, translated into Latin by Riccardo Pisano. Theology and Philosophy The teaching of Theology and Philosophy during the Middle Ages had two different ways: lectio and disputatio: * The lectio (lesson) was very similar to a present class. The teacher commented the sentences and doctrines of famous and known authors, such as for instance, Aristotle's or Boethius' works, or Peter Lombard's sentences. * The disputatio (dispute) was more informal than the lectio, and was a real dialogue between teachers and disciples, where arguments in favour of or against any theses or subject were defended. These two school methods originated their literary forms: * From the lectio, the commentaria (commentaries) were born. And these ones brought the summae about, which were freer and more autonomous and systematic than the commentaria. * The disputatio originated the quaestiones disputatae (disputed matters), that gather the material of the disputes that were held every two weeks; and the quodlibeta (random questions), that gathered the disputes that were held in Christmas and Easter. This metodology of the disputationes was the technical model of the famous mediaeval summae.Merino, J.A. OFM. Historia de la filosof√≠a franciscana. Madrid.

It lies east-north-east of Derry, to which it serves as a sleeper village, and west-south-west of Limavady. Eglinton had a population of 3,679 people in the 2011 Census, an increase of 16% on the 2001 Census population of 3,165. It lies within Derry and Strabane district. The City of Derry Airport, also known as Eglinton Aerodrome and formerly as Londonderry Eglinton Airport,http://www.nats-uk.ead-it.com/aip/current/ad/EGAE/EG_AD_2_EGAE_en.pdf lies a short distance from the village. Eglinton still has an elegant church, former market house, trees around a green and four oaks which started life in Windsor Great Park. The River Muff flows through the village with the afforested Muff Glen being situated just south of the village. At an embankment of Lough Foyle, birdwatchers can find the feeding ground of many seabirds and waders on the mud flats at low tide.  History  The village of Eglinton was originally known as (the) Muff, and alternatively as (the) Moigh or Mough. These come and were the names of the townland in which the village began. The village was founded in 1619 by the Grocers' Company of London. As part of the Plantation of Ulster, James I had granted a large area (15,900 acres) of Faughanvale parish to the Grocers in 1609. The Grocers did not farm it themselves but leased this area to Edward Rone of Essex in 1615 with the stipulation that he built a bawn and 12 houses by 1619. The yearly rent being ¬£116-13s-4d. Rone died in 1618 but his brother-in-law Robert Harrington took over and by 1619 a castle and bawn and 8 houses were erected in the townland of Muff (now Eglinton) and by 1622 the stipulated building was completed The castle (really a castellated house and bawn with 4 flanker towers) was besieged in 1641 during the English Civil War by the insurgents under Colonel McDonnell and defended by the garrison during the winter of that year. It was relieved the following summer by troops from Derry but it afterwards fell into the hands of the parliamentarians by whom it was dismantled. During the Siege of Derry, the castle was briefly occupied by troops of King James while they were foraging for supplies. Eglinton Parish Church Faughanvale Presbyterian Church The ruins were standing and occupied until 1823 when the present Rectory was built on the site. The only remains of the castle today being the cellars under the rectory. The Church of Ireland was represented within the village by the Parish Church of Faughanvale which was built in 1626. It was later superseded by a new Parish Church constructed in 1821 with the ruins of the old church being extant within the adjacent graveyard. The Presbyterian Church was represented in the village with the building of the first church in 1730. Prior to this, the congregation formed part of the Glendermott Congregation in the city of Derry. The original church was built in the townland of Tullanee just east of the village. The existing much larger church, Faughanvale Presbyterian Church, was built in 1894 with the help of donations from fellow citizens of the congregation who had some time earlier emigrated to the United States. Nothing remains of the original church which stood in what is now the Presbyterian Church graveyard immediately to the rear of the new church. There were several other places called Muff at the time, especially one nearby in Donegal which created much confusion. The residents of the village resolved to afford of the opportunity to change the name. Therefore, on 19 August 1858, the village of Muff became Eglinton in honour of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the 13th Earl of Eglinton who was visiting the nearby Templemoyle Agricultural School at the time. The school was opened in 1826 aimed at teaching new agricultural methods but eventually closed in 1865. The building remained disused for many years before being converted into a nursing home in the 1990s. Main Street looking east Tom Gallaher (1840‚Äì1927), the miller's son of Templemoyle, was the founder of the famous tobacco firm of Gallahers, now the Gallaher Group. His relatives lived in The Glen House in the centre of Eglinton village until the 1950s. One of the oldest buildings, if not the oldest standing today, is Foyle Park House. Foyle Park was built in 1813 by David Babington who rented his land from the Worshipful Company of Grocers. The mansion was built when Babington started to make land improvements in the west of the village between 1805-1836 when he planted 172,000 trees, mainly to shelter the house. Babington used the house as a literary school for a while. When Babington's lease expired, the Grocers didn't renew the lease so the Literary School then closed its doors and Foyle Park then became the new Grocers' Hall. It was used as the Grocers' Hall until the 1870s when James Davidson, a customs and exports worker, bought the entire village from the Grocers' Company. This included the Foyle Park Estate. Davidson lived at Foyle Park and the Manor House. His son, James William Davidson then lived in Foyle Park after him. Davidson's grandson sold Foyle Park to H. Whiteside in 1920 and the house fell out of the Davidson family. The house was re-acquired by the family when Lt. Col. Kenneth Davidson bought the house back in the 1960s. The house remained with the family until it was finally sold off in 2011, after over 100 years of ownership. Another of the oldest buildings today is the Erasmus Smith schoolhouse built in 1814 beside the old national school of 1886 both now private residences. The Grocers did not resume active management of the estate until 1823 when they rebuilt the village. Among the buildings erected by the company in 1823-5 were the Rectory, a Courthouse or Market house ( an unusually well designed building by Nicholson which included a dispensary (the wall plaques outside the former courthouse are the Grocers and David Babingtons coat of arms)), a Manor house for the Grocers agent and the Glen house. All of which are still to be seen today. They also built a row of cottages for local widows which was known until quite recently as Widow's Row (now renamed Cottage Row) and tradesmen's houses along Main Street. The millers house opposite the Happy Landing public house became the old R.I.C. barracks until the present police station was built. The Grocers sold the village in 1874 to James Davidson from Brechin, Scotland; his descendants still reside in the manor house to this day. During the Second World War RAF Eglinton was home to many Royal Air Force and later to Royal Navy personnel. Many old buildings currently in a state of disrepair, evidence their presence, and can still be seen dotted around the outskirts of the village. The airfield was a major airfield for flights over the North Atlantic, their tasks included searching for U-boats and acting as air cover for convoys. Several aircraft crashed in the vicinity of the village and the nearby airfield with several pilots and aircrew being buried locally in the Parish Church and Presbyterian Church graveyards.

The song is derived from the Christian spiritual known as \\"When the Chariot Comes\\". It has been assigned the number 4204 in the Roud Folk Song Index. Background The first appearance of \\"She'll Be Comin' Round the Mountain\\" in print was in Carl Sandburg's The American Songbag in 1927. Sandburg reports that the negro spiritual ‚ÄúWhen the Chariot Comes\\", which was sung to the same melody, was adapted by railroad workers in the Midwestern United States during the 1890s. It is often heard today with responses that add on to the previous verse. The original song was published in Old Plantation Hymns in 1899. It ostensibly refers to the Second Coming of Christ and subsequent Rapture, with the she referring to the chariot that the returning Christ is depicted as driving. Typically, she would refer to the church itself, not a chariot since nowhere in the Bible is Christ on a chariot. Like many spirituals that originated in the African-American community, this was probably a coded anthem for the Underground Railroad. The secularized version that developed among railroad work gangs in the late 19th century has become a standard over the years, appearing in printed collections of children's music while also being performed by both children and adults in sing-alongs, particularly as a campfire song. Since the mid-1920s, \\"She'll Be Comin' Round the Mountain\\" has been recorded by numerous musicians, ranging from Tommy Tucker and Bing Crosby to Pete Seeger and Neil Young. Variations *The earliest known recordings of the song were by Henry Whitter on Okeh Records (OKeh 40063) in 1924 and Vernon Dalhart & Co. on Edison Records (Edison 51608) in 1925. *In the Reader's Digest Children's Songbook, published in 1985, the song is adapted with new words by Dan Fox and his son, Paul. The lyrics tell of the things \\"she\\" will do in increasing number up to ten, for example, \\"She'll be ridin' on a camel\\", \\"She'll be tuggin' on two turtles‚Äù, and \\"She'll be carvin' three thick thistles‚Äù.Simon, William L.

Retrieved on 21 September 2012. *On the album Doing It in Lagos: Boogie, Pop & Disco in 1980's Nigeria, the song is referenced by Danny Offia & The Friks in their song Funk With Me *The digital entertainment studio JibJab created a satire about George W. Bush's re- election, called \\"Second Term\\" using the tune of \\"She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain\\". *Neil Young & Crazy Horse recorded \\"Jesus' Chariot\\", a version of \\"When the Chariot Comes\\", on their 2012 album Americana. *The German song \\"Von den blauen Bergen kommen wir\\" shares the same melody, as does the song \\"Tante aus Marokko\\" and its Dutch equivalent, \\"Tante uit Marokko\\". These last two songs use similar themes from the original but personify the main character more literally as a woman riding on a camel with pistols. *A similar song is found in Norway (derived from Lorentzen's Danish version): \\"Du skal f√• min gamle sykkel n√•r jeg d√∏r (hvis jeg d√∏r).\\" The verses list all the \\"old\\" (gamle) things that \\"you\\" (du) can have \\"when/if I die\\" (n√•r/hvis jeg d√∏r). The \\"things\\" range from the lightly humorous to the scatological to the somewhat pornographic, with many also playing on religion. *Some sports fans at the University of Cambridge use this tune to sing \\"we would rather be at Oxford than St John's\\". *Funkadelic references the tune in their song \\"Comin' Round The Mountain\\". *\\"Ye Cannae Shove Yer Granny Aff A Bus\\" is a children's song to the same tune in Scotland. *The Scottish Football team Glasgow Rangers use the tune to sing \\"if you cannae do the bouncy, you're a tim\\" . *\\"There's a Skeeter on My Peter\\" is a dirty parody. Animation *The Peanuts cast performed the song in the 1977 film Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown. It was performed by The Winans in This is America, Charlie Brown in its episode titled \\"Building of the Transcontinental Railroad\\". *In the 1941 short animated film Timber, Donald Duck sings the song during both the opening and the closing scenes. *Mrs. Frizzle and Carlos sing the song while the class is travelling through Arnold Matthew's intestines in The Magic School Bus episode \\"For Lunch\\".

Krause (born December 8, 1938) is an American musician and soundscape ecologist. In 1968, he founded Wild Sanctuary, an organization dedicated to the recording and archiving of natural soundscapes. Krause is an author, a bio-acoustician, a speaker, and natural sound artist who coined the terms geophony, biophony, and anthropophony.Wild Sanctuary website ; accessed July 1, 2015. Biography Krause was born in Detroit, Michigan. From 1957, he worked as a recording engineer and producer in Ann Arbor while an undergraduate student. Krause joined The Weavers in 1963, occupying the tenor position originated by co-founder Pete Seeger until they disbanded in early 1964.Notes From the Wild, Krause 1996, Ellipsis Arts =Electronic music= Krause moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to study electronic music at Mills College. During this period Krause met Paul Beaver and together they formed Beaver & Krause.Into A Wild Sanctuary, Krause 1998, Heyday Books They also served as the Moog company's sales representatives on the U.S. West Coast. As such, they were able to exploit the growing fascination in the new synthesizer sounds among rock and pop musicians, an interest that was partly influenced by these artists' consumption of hallucinogenic drugs, and the increasingly generous advances they received from their record companies. In June 1967, Beaver & Krause set up a stall at the Monterey Pop Festival, where they introduced the Moog III to the musicians and attendees at the festival. The team played Moog synthesizer on the Monkees' song \\"Star Collector\\" (1967), one of the first pop group recordings to feature synthesizer. In 1967 they released The Nonesuch Guide to Electronic Music. It was the first West Coast recording to utilize Dolby A301 (without meters) noise reduction as an inherent part of their production. Beaver & Krause, individually or as a team, went on to sell Moog IIIs to musicians and perform on their recordings with the instrument. In November 1968 Krause was asked by George Harrison to demonstrate the synthesizer after performing on a session for Apple artist Jackie Lomax in Los Angeles. According to Krause, without his knowledge, permission, or compensation, Harrison made a recording of the demonstration and issued an unauthorized version as \\"No Time Or Space\\" on his Electronic Sound album the following year.Into A Wild Sanctuary, Krause 1998, Heyday Books Because of their studio work in Hollywood, New York City, and London, Beaver & Krause are credited with helping to introduce the synthesizer to pop music and film.Making Music, Sir George Martin, 1983, HarperCollins =Soundscape recording= Since 1979, Krause has concentrated on the recording and archiving of wild natural soundscapes from around the world. These recordings ‚Äì works of art and science commissioned primarily by museums, aquaria, and zoos for their dioramas and sound installations worldwide ‚Äì have been mixed into ambient tracks for numerous feature films, and downloadable field recording albums from the world's rare habitats.Wild Sanctuary, In 1985 Krause and a colleague, Diana Reiss, helped lure Humphrey the Whale, a migrating female humpback that had wandered into Sacramento River Delta and apparently got lost, back to the Pacific Ocean. As scientific co- directors of the operation, they used recordings of humpbacks feeding, recorded by two graduate students from the University of Hawaii, recordings that Krause modified to eliminate extraneous noise and add different characteristics to the audio tracks so that the whale would not habituate to the one audio short example that was provided by the students' graduate professor.Into A Wild Sanctuary, Krause 1998, Heyday Books Krause's 1988 CD album, Gorillas in the Mix (Rykodisc), is composed entirely from sampled animal sounds, played from sampling keyboards. Working in the field of soundscape ecology, a sub-category of ecoacoustics, Krause introduced a number of terms and concepts into the discipline to further define the sources of sound within the soundscape. They include geophony, the first sounds heard on earth consisting of non-biological natural sounds such as the effect of wind in trees or grasses, waves at the ocean or lakeshore, or movement of the earth. The second acoustic source is called biophony, the collective signature produced at one time by all sound-producing organisms in a given habitat. The third, and last of these elements is referred to as anthropophony, or human- generated acoustic signatures. In the final category, some sources represent controlled sound, such as music, theatre, or language. While a large percentage consists of incoherent or chaotic sound, referred to as noise. The first and last terms were implemented along with colleague, Stuart Gage, Professor Emeritus, Michigan State University.The Great Animal Orchestra: Finding the Origins of Music in the World's Wild Places, Krause 2012, Little Brown Krause was invited to present a TED Global talk at the 2013 Edinburgh conferencehttps://www.ted.com/talks/bernie_krause_the_voice_of_the_natural_world?language=en and the keynote talk at the first conference of the International Society of Ecoacoustics (ISE), a worldwide organization, meeting in Paris in June, 2014. In July 2014, the Cheltenham Music Festival premiered \\"The Great Animal Orchestra: Symphony for Orchestra and Wild Soundscapes,\\" a collaboration with friend and colleague, Richard Blackford, former Balliol College Oxford Composer-in-Residence. Performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales and conducted by Martyn Brabbins, the theme is based on Krause's 2012 book of the same title. The work integrates natural soundscapes into the orchestral textures of a major symphonic piece. The symphony was recorded and released on CD by Nimbus Records in September 2014.Introducing The Great Animal Orchestra Symphony, Michael McManus, 22 August 2014 Gramophone Magazine On April 3, 2015, Krause and Blackford premiered the score for their first ballet, \\"Biophony\\", performed by Alonzo King LINES Ballet at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco.

Phenylalanine is an amino acid obtained normally through the diet, but can be harmful if excess levels build up, causing intellectual disability and other serious health problems. In healthy individuals, it is metabolised (hydroxylated) into tyrosine, another amino acid, by phenylalanine hydroxylase. However, this enzyme requires tetrahydrobiopterin as a cofactor and thus its deficiency slows phenylalanine metabolism. High levels of phenylalanine are present from infancy in people with untreated tetrahydrobiopterin (THB, BH4) deficiency. The resulting signs and symptoms range from mild to severe. Mild complications may include temporary low muscle tone. Severe complications include intellectual disability, movement disorders, difficulty swallowing, seizures, behavioral problems, progressive problems with development, and an inability to control body temperature. It was first characterized in 1975.  Genetics  autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means two copies of a specific gene in each cell are altered in order for the individual to be afflicted. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the altered gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder. = Related genes = Mutations in the GCH1, PCBD1, PTS and QDPR genes directly cause BH4 deficiency. Additionally, mutations of the MTHFR gene (A1298C variant) and DHFR can interfere with the recycling of BH4 and lead to less severe, but still clinifically significant, deficiencies of BH4. BH4 is a compound that helps convert several amino acids, including phenylalanine, to other essential molecules in the body. It is also involved in the production of serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine ‚Äì neurotransmitters that transmit signals between nerve cells in the brain. THB deficiency can be caused by mutations in one of several genes, including GCH1, PCBD1, PTS, and QDPR. These genes control the production of hydroxylase enzymes that are critical for producing and recycling THB. If just one of the enzymes fails to function correctly because of a gene mutation, little or no BH4 is produced. As a result, phenylalanine from the diet builds up in the bloodstream and other tissues, potentially damaging nerve cells in the brain. Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency also disrupts the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, which affects the function of the central nervous system (CNS), and dysregulation of the nitric oxide cycle leads to a buildup of peroxynitrite, an inflammatory oxidant that further degrades BH4 and perpetuates a state of inflammation. Pathophysiology Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency can be caused by a deficiency of the enzyme dihydrobiopterin reductase (DHPR), whose activity is needed to replenish quinonoid-dihydrobiopterin back into its tetrahydrobiopterin form. Those with this deficiency may produce sufficient levels of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) but, since tetrahydrobiopterin is a cofactor for PAH activity, deficient dihydrobiopterin reductase renders any PAH produced unable to use phenylalanine to produce tyrosine. Tetrahydrobiopterin is a cofactor in the production of L-DOPA from tyrosine and 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan from tryptophan, which must be supplemented as treatment in addition to the supplements for classical PKU. Other underlying causes of tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency are: * 6-Pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) deficiency * Autosomal recessive guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH) deficiency * Pterin-4alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD) deficiency Diagnosis  Treatment  Treatment of THB deficiencies consists of THB supplementation (2‚Äì20 mg/kg per day) or diet to control blood phenylalanine concentration and replacement therapy with neurotransmitters precursors (L-DOPA and 5-HTP) and supplements of folinic acid in DHPR deficiency. Tetrahydrobiopterin is available as a tablet for oral administration in the form of tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride (BH4*2HCL). BH4*2HCL is FDA approved under the trade name Kuvan. The typical cost of treating a patient with Kuvan is $100,000 per year. BioMarin holds the patent for Kuvan until at least 2024, but Par Pharmaceutical has a right to produce a generic version by 2020. BH4*2HCL is indicated at least in tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency caused by GTPCH deficiency or PTPS deficiency.  Epidemiology  This condition is very rare; approximately 600 cases have been reported worldwide. In most parts of the world, only 1% to 2% of all infants with high phenylalanine levels have this disorder. In Taiwan, about 30% of newborns with elevated levels of phenylalanine have a deficiency of THB. Subclinical deficiency can be found in individuals with poor diet (including low intake of folate or vitamin C) or genetic mutations in the MTHFR genes, which are involved in BH4 synthesis and recycling.

In November 1997, Cowie was rebranded as Arriva, with new trading names introduced: *North East Bus became Arriva North East *Northumbria Motor Services became Arriva Northumbria *Tees & District became Arriva Tees & District *Teesside Motor Services became Arriva Teesside *United Motor Services became Arriva Durham County Gradually, the operations of Arriva North East and Arriva Northumbria were integrated, with common fleet numbering and management. All operations now run under the licence of Arriva Durham County. Fleet and operations A large part of the Arriva North East fleet is made up of vehicles manufactured by Alexander Dennis, Wrightbus and VDL. As of January 2020, Arriva North East has a fleet of over 500 buses. Most vehicles are branded in the interurban fleet livery, consisting of vehicles painted in an aquamarine livery with a cream semi-circle at the front, a dark blue skirt and yellow stripe. An Alexander Dennis Enviro 400, in former Coastliner branding, seen in Newcastle upon Tyne. Other brands include the former MAX (designed for inter-urban express services), and Sapphire (designed for premium, high-frequency services). The former interurban-branded fleet is being gradually replaced by the new corporate livery, this featuring an all- round aquamarine livery, and a white stripe at the front, with vehicles wearing the new Arriva logo. = Current depots = As of February 2020, Arriva North East has nine bus depots: * Alnwick: Lionheart Enterprise Park, Alnwick, Northumberland An outstation, for services operating in Northumberland, based at the Rothbury Motors depot in Alnwick. * Ashington: Lintonville Parkway, Ashington, Northumberland Opened in 2014, as a replacement for the former depot at Ashington. * Belmont: Belmont Business Park, Belmont, Durham, County Durham Opened in 2012, as a replacement for the former depot at Waddington Street (Durham). * Blyth: Bridge Street, Blyth, Northumberland * Faverdale: Faverdale North, Darlington, County Durham * Jesmond: Portland Terrace, Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear * Redcar: Ennis Road, Dormanstown, Redcar, North Yorkshire * Stockton: Boathouse Lane, Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham * Whitby: Fairfield Way, Stainsacre, North Yorkshire An outstation of the Redcar depot, for services operating in and around Whitby. = Former depots = Below is a list of former Arriva North East depots: * Ashington: In March 2014, all buses and employees transferred to the new depot on Lintonville Parkway, (a short walk from the original depot). The new depot was officially opened by Ashington's longest serving driver and engineer. The drivers' rest room and supervisor's office remained in the old depot building until November 2014, when a nearby derelict building was refurbished for the drivers' rest room. The supervisor's office was moved into a portacabin on the main area of the bus station. As of August 2015, the depot has been completely demolished. * Bishop Auckland (Go North East): In March 2006, Go North East announced that it was withdrawing services from Bishop Auckland, with the exception of three flagship routes (mainly those linking to Durham and Newcastle), which transferred to their Chester-le-Street depot. The bulk of its operations (but no vehicles), which had been taken over from OK Travel by Go-Ahead Northern in March 1995, were transferred to Arriva. The former Go North East depot in Bishop Auckland has since been demolished.Arriva North East / Nothumbria Fleetlist Jeff's Bus Lane 6 June 2012 * Bishop Auckland (The Eden): The Eden Bus Company was purchased by North East Bus in 1995, and operated from a base at West Auckland. This depot was subsequently closed, with operations being moved to the Bishop Auckland depot. taking on the function of a \\"low cost unit\\". Of the Eden fleet, only the Leyland Nationals served for any length of time after the take over, though some native United vehicles did carry Eden fleet names. By the time the Arriva identity appeared, the Eden brand had ceased to be used. The Eden name was subsequently purchased from Arriva, by Graeme Scarlett, who now operates a small fleet in a red and ivory livery. * Darlington: In May 2007, it was announced that Arriva North East would take over Stagecoach North East's operations in Darlington, pending approval by the Office of Fair Trading. By August 2007, all Stagecoach North East services, drivers and vehicles (except one) in Darlington were transferred to Arriva North East and the former Stagecoach fleet was repainted. In March 2008, all Darlington operations moved to the new Faverdale depot. The previous depot at Feethams then briefly operated as an administrative outpost, whilst the Tubwell Row offices were refurbished, before being closed and has been demolished. * Durham: In December 2012, Durham's Waddington Street depot was closed, following the completion of the new Belmont depot, (despite being only one minute away from Durham Bus Station). By July 2013, the former depot had been demolished, with the site being redeveloped for residential use.Go-ahead for housing plan on old bus depot site Sunderland Echo 16 November 2012 * Hexham: In March 2010, Arriva North East took over Go North East's Ashington depot (then located in Jubilee Industrial Estate), in exchange for the operation of Hexham depot.Anticipated acquisition by Go Ahead North East Limited of the bus operations of Arriva Northumbria Limited in Hexham, Northumnberland Office of Fair Trading 26 May 2010 Arriva jointly operates the Cross Pennine 685 service with Stagecoach in Cumbria & North Lancashire, with Arriva's buses operating from the depot at Jesmond. * Loftus: Arriva's Loftus depot closed in January 2009. Prior to this, services X3, X4 and 789 were transferred to the depot at Redcar. After the closure, services 56 and X56 were shared between Stockton and Whitby outstation, whilst Redcar further gained services 65, 65A and 828. * Richmond: A bus depot operated at Richmond until its closure in March 2006. From that date, the remaining routes in the area (X26, X27 and X28) were transferred to the Faverdale depot. At this time, most of the council supported services previously run by Arriva were taken on by Dales & District, with most running to the same timetables, and staffed by many of the drivers from the former Richmond depot.

The method was developed in 1983 by the staff members of Hoag Hospital and Newport Beach Fire Department located in California, and is currently widely used in the United States.START Adult Triage Algorithm. Radiation Emergency Medical Management: REMM (US Department of Health and Human Services). http://www.remm.nlm.gov/startadult.htm Classification First responders using START evaluate victims and assign them to one of the following four categories: * Deceased/expectant (black) * Immediate (red) * Delayed (yellow) * Walking wounded/minor (green) Lerner EB, Schwartz RB, Coule PL, et al. \\"Mass Casualty Triage: An Evaluation of the Data and Development of a Proposed National Guideline.\\" Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness 2(Suppl. 1) 2008, pp S25-S34. The colors correspond to triage tags, which are used by some agencies to indicate each victim's status, although physical tags are not necessary if patients can be physically sorted into different areas.Benson M, Koenig KL, Schultz CH. \\"Disaster Triage: START, then SAVE--A New Method of Dynamic Triage for Victims of a Catastrophic Event.\\" Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness 11(2) 1996, pp 117-124. Responders arriving to the scene of a mass casualty incident may first ask that any victim who is able to walk relocate to a certain area, thereby identifying the ambulatory, or walking wounded, patients. Non- ambulatory patients are then assessed. The only medical intervention used prior to declaring a patient deceased is an attempt to open the airway. Any patient who is not breathing after this attempt is classified as deceased and given a black tag. No further interventions or therapies are attempted on deceased patients until all other patients have been treated. Patients who are breathing and have any of the following conditions are classified as immediate: * Respiratory rate greater than 30 per minute; * Radial pulse is absent, or capillary refill is over 2 seconds; * Unable to follow simple commands All other patients are classified as delayed. Treatment and evacuation After all patients have been evaluated, responders use the START classifications to determine priorities for treatment or evacuation to a hospital. The most basic way to use the START classifications is to transport victims in a fixed priority manner: immediate victims, followed by delayed victims, followed by the walking wounded. More detailed secondary triage systems such as SAVE may also be used: in this case, the START classifications are used to determine the order in which victims should undergo secondary triage. START is not a system for determining resource allocation. The classification algorithm used in START does not depend on the number of victims or on the number of resources available to treat them, nor does using START alone provide any prioritization of patients within any of the four triage classes. Therefore, significant differences in implementation of treatment and evacuation may exist across different agencies using START.Navin M, Sacco W, and Waddell R. Operational Comparison of the Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment Method and the Sacco Triage Method in Mass Casualty Exercises. Journal of Trauma Vol. 69 No. 1 July 2010 pp.215-225. http://journals.lww.com/jtrauma/pages/default.aspx Modifications to START and similar triage systems Numerous agencies have developed modifications to START or new triage systems similar to START. One early proposed modification substituted the presence of a radial pulse for capillary refill in classifying patients as immediate. The Fire Department of New York uses a modified version of START with an orange or \\"urgent\\" classification intermediate in severity between immediate and delayed. =Modification for pediatric patients= START has also been modified to provide better treatment for children. One such modification is known as JumpSTART. There are several simple modifications to the adult version. The primary modification for use with pediatric patients is to change the \\"normal\\" respiratory rate: since children breathe faster than adults, JumpSTART assigns the immediate classification on the basis of respiratory rate only if the child's respiration is under 15 or over 45 per minute. Another change is in the apneic pediatric patient with a pulse the patient is given 5 breaths. If they resume breathing on their own, they are tagged as \\"immediate\\". If they do not resume breathing on their own, they are tagged as \\"deceased\\". Another needed bit of information is to decide who qualifies as a pediatric patient and who qualifies as an adult. This can quickly be decided by a rapid check for underarm hair development on boys, and breast bud or breast development on girls. If the age is known, the age cut off for child versus adult is 8 years old. =Similar triage systems= Other triage systems that are variations of or similar to START include Triage Sieve, Pediatric Triage Tape, and CareFlite Triage. Each of these systems uses four or five triage classes with the red, yellow, green, and black colors. Limitations There is no accepted measure to judge the appropriateness of any given system in mass casualty triage. Like many other triage systems, START suffers from implementation problems such as substantial amounts of overtriage. Frykberg ER. \\"Triage: Principles and Practice.\\" Scandinavian Journal of Surgery 94, 2005, pp 272-278 One of the major strengths of START, its simplicity, is also a major limitation. Since START was developed, consensus has emerged that triage should be more sophisticated, by incorporating resource limitations and capacity in determining how to prioritize patients.Lerner EB, Cone DC, Weinstein ES. \\"Mass Casualty Triage: An Evaluation of the Science and Refinement of a National Guideline.\\" Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness 5, 2011, pp 129-137.Argon NT, Ziya S, Winslow JE. \\"Triage in the Aftermath of Mass-Casualty Incidents.\\" Wiley Encyclopedia of Operations Research and Management Science.

On 6 November the revolutionary movement reaches Wilhelmshaven. Our picture shows the soldiers' council of the .\\" The Kiel mutiny () was a major revolt by sailors of the German High Seas Fleet on 3 November 1918. The revolt triggered the German revolution which was to sweep aside the monarchy within a few days. It ultimately led to the end of the German Empire and to the establishment of the Weimar Republic.  Background  By September 1918, Germany's military situation was close to hopeless. Kaiser Wilhelm II was advised to request the Entente for an immediate cease fire and put the government on a democratic footing, hoping for more favorable peace terms. On 3 October, the Kaiser appointed Prince Maximilian of Baden as the new imperial chancellor. In his cabinet the Social Democrats (SPD) also took on responsibility. The most prominent and highest-ranking was Philipp Scheidemann, a prominent leader of the SPD as undersecretary without portfolio. Morale in the High Seas Fleet Following the Battle of Jutland in 1916, many of the capital ships of the Imperial Navy had seen reduced activity outside the Baltic and had remained in harbor. Many officers and crewmen volunteered to transfer to the submarines and light vessels which still had a major part to play in the war. The discipline and spirit of those who remained, on lower rations, with the battleships tied up at dock-side, inevitably suffered. On 2 August 1917, 350 crewmen of the dreadnought staged a protest demonstration in Wilhelmshaven. Two of the ringleaders were executed by firing squad while others were sentenced to prison. During the remaining months of the war, secret sailors' councils were formed on a number of the capital ships. Richard Stumpf has written a book \\"Warum die Flotte zerbrach ‚Äì Kriegstagebuch eines christlichen Arbeiters (Why the fleet broke up ‚Äì war diary of a Christian worker)\\" of his war memories, explaining the conditions that lead to the demise of German Imperial Navy. This was later presented to German Weimar Republic parliament (Reichstag) commission and is discussed at Naval Academy M√ºrwik naval history classes.  Naval order of 24 October 1918  The plan to force a naval clash on the high seas In October 1918, the imperial naval command in Kiel under Admiral Franz von Hipper planned to dispatch the fleet for a final battle against the Royal Navy in the English Channel.This chapter and the whole article follow the doctoral thesis written by Dirk D√§hnhardt, and published 1978 as Revolution in Kiel.; details see under Literature. The naval order of 24 October 1918 and the preparations to sail triggered a mutiny among the affected sailors and then a general revolution which was to sweep aside the monarchy within a few days.   Sailors demonstrating at Wilhelmshaven The sailors' revolt started on the Schillig Roads off Wilhelmshaven, where the German fleet had anchored in expectation of a planned battle. During the night from 28 to 30 October 1918 some crews refused to obey orders. Sailors on board three ships from the Third Navy Squadron refused to weigh anchor. Part of the crew on and , two battleships from the First Navy Squadron, committed outright mutiny and sabotage. However, when, a day later, some torpedo boats pointed their cannons at these ships, the mutineers gave up and were led away without any resistance. Nevertheless, the naval command had to drop its plans as it was felt that the crew's loyalty could no longer be relied upon. The Third Navy Squadron was ordered back to Kiel.  Sailors revolt in Kiel  Sculpture in Kiel to remember the 1918 sailors' mutiny The squadron commander, Vizeadmiral Hugo Kraft, exercised a maneuver with his battleships in the Heligoland Bight. When it \\"functioned perfectly (tadellos funktionierte)\\" he believed he was master of his crews again. While moving through the Kiel Canal he had 47 sailors from the , who were seen as the ringleaders, imprisoned. In Holtenau (end of the canal in Kiel) they were brought to the Arrestanstalt (the military prison in Kiel) and to Fort Herwarth in the north of Kiel. The sailors and stokers sought to prevent the fleet from setting sail again and to achieve the release of their comrades. Some 250 met in the evening of 1 November in the Union House in Kiel. Delegations sent to their officers requesting the mutineers' release were not heard. The sailors were now looking for closer ties to the unions, the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) and the SPD. Thereupon the Union House was closed by police, leading to an even larger joint open-air meeting on 2 November, at the large drill ground (Gro√üer Exerzierplatz). Led by the sailor Karl Artelt, who worked in the repair ship yard for torpedo boats in Kiel-Wik,According to Dirk D√§hnhardt, Revolution in Kiel (p. 56) Artelt worked in the Torpedowerkstatt Friedrichsort. It seems D√§hnhardt made a mistake here: those sources which he refers to and in a report from the Bundesarchiv (German Federal Archive, Erinnerungsbericht Karl Artelts, Sign.: SGY 30/0022) show definitely that Artelt worked in the Torpedobootsreparatur-werkstatt or -werft (ship workshop or yard for the repair of torpedo boats) in Kiel Wik. Robert Rosentreter, Blaujacken im Novembersturm (p. 32) seems to have just copied D√§hnhardt's information, although he claims to refer to Artelt's statements from 1960. and by the mobilized shipyard worker Lothar Popp, both USPD members, the sailors called for a large meeting the following day at the same place. This call was heeded by several thousand people on the afternoon of 3 November with workers' representatives also being present. The slogan \\"Frieden und Brot\\" (peace and bread) was raised showing that the sailors and workers demanded not only the release of the imprisoned but also the end of the war and the improvement of food provisions. Eventually the people supported Artelt's call to free the prisoners and they moved in the direction of the military prison. Sublieutenant Steinh√§user, who had orders to stop the demonstrators, ordered his patrol to give warning shots and then to shoot directly into the demonstrators. Seven men were killed and 29 were seriously injured. Some demonstrators also opened fire. Steinh√§user was severely injured by rifle-butt blows and shots, but contrary to later statements, he was not killed.Hauptkrankenbuch Festungslazarett Kiel, Nr. 15918, Krankenbuchlager Berlin, zit. bei Dirk, D√§hnhardt, Revolution in Kiel. p. 66. After this incident, commonly viewed as the starting point of the German revolution, the demonstrators dispersed and the patrol withdrew. = Protesters take over Kiel = Wilhelm Souchon, the governor of the naval station, initially asked for outside troops but revoked his request for military assistance when his staff claimed the situation was under control. Souchon had been deployed to Kiel only a few days earlier on 30 October 1918 and therefore had to rely heavily on his staff. On 4 November, however, the request was renewed, resulting in six infantry companies being brought to Kiel. Some units stayed in the city quarter Wik and in the Marinestation der Ostsee. However, these troops also showed signs of disintegration and some joined the revolutionaries or went back.Dirk D√§hnhardt: Revolution in Kiel. Neum√ºnster 1978, S. 83 f. On the morning of 4 November groups of mutineers moved through the town. Sailors in a large barracks compound in a northern district of Kiel (Wik Garnison: Tirpitz Hafen) refused obedience: after a division inspection of the commander, spontaneous demonstrations took place. Karl Artelt organized the first soldiers' council, and soon many more were set up. The governor of the navy station had to negotiate and to order the withdrawal of the units. The imprisoned sailors and stokers were freed. Soldier and worker control Soldiers and workers brought public and military institutions under their control. When, against Souchon's promise, different troops advanced to quash the rebellion, they were intercepted by the mutineers and were either sent back or joined the sailors and workers. By the evening of 4 November, Kiel was firmly in the hands of approximately 40,000 rebellious sailors, soldiers and workers, as was Wilhelmshaven two days later. Late in the evening of the 4 November a meeting of sailors and workers representatives in the union house led to the establishment of a soldiers' and a workers' council. The Kiel 'Fourteen Points' of the soldier's council were issued: Plaque at the union house in Kiel saying that the workers' and soldiers' council gathered here during the sailors' mutiny and gave the decisive impulse for the proclamation of the first German republic Resolutions and demands of the soldiers' council: * The release of all inmates and political prisoners. * Complete freedom of speech and the press. * The abolition of mail censorship. * Appropriate treatment of crews by superiors. * No punishment for all comrades on returning to the ships and to the barracks. * The launching of the fleet is to be prevented under all circumstances. * Any defensive measures involving bloodshed are to be prevented. * The withdrawal of all troops not belonging to the garrison. * All measures for the protection of private property will be determined by the soldiers' council immediately. * Superiors will no longer be recognized outside of duty. * Unlimited personal freedom of every man from the end of his tour of duty until the beginning of his next tour of duty * Officers who declare themselves in agreement with the measures of the newly established soldiers' council, are welcomed in our midst. All the others have to quit their duty without entitlement to provision. * Every member of the soldiers' council is to be released from any duty. * All measures to be introduced in the future can only be introduced with the consent of the soldiers' council. These demands are orders of the soldiers' council and are binding for every military person. Dirk D√§hnhardt came to the following conclusion in his 1978 doctoral thesis: \\"The 14 points of Kiel were ... mainly an attack on the military system, political objectives were lacking widely.\\" D. D√§hnhardt: Revolution in Kiel. Karl Wachholtz Verlag, Neum√ºnster 1978, p. 91. D√§hnhardt attributes this on the one hand to the heterogeneous composition of the bodies, and on the other hand to the intention to first of all issue a catalogue of immediate measures. Spreads all over Germany During the following events, councils all over Germany oriented themselves on these 14 items. D√§hnhardt saw this political shortsightedness as a major reason for the dissolution of soldiers' councils after six months. Wolfram Wette from the German Armed Forces Military History Research Office noted: \\"... the Kiel signal ... did not point in the direction of a council state according to the Bolshevistic example. Instead it stood ... for the demand for the fastest possible ending of the war. Secondly it pointed ‚Äì starting with the 'Kiel 14 points' ‚Äì ... in the direction of a liberal, social and democratic political system, in which especially militarism ... should have no space any more.\\" Wolfram Wette: \\"Die Novemberrevolution ‚Äì Kiel 1918\\", in Fleischhauer und Turowski: \\"Kieler Erinnerungsorte\\", Boyens, 2006. On the same evening the SPD deputy Gustav Noske arrived in Kiel and was welcomed enthusiastically, although he had orders from the new government and the SPD leadership to bring the rising under control. He had himself elected chairman of the soldiers' council and reinstated peace and order. Some days later he took over the governor's post, while Lothar Popp from the USPD became chairman of the overall soldiers council. During the coming weeks Noske actually managed to reduce the influence of the councils in Kiel, but he could not prevent the spreading of the revolution to all of Germany. The events had already spread far beyond the city limits. Regarding Noske's role in Kiel, Wette noted: \\"What he [Noske] however did not bring about, and possibly because of his political basic position was not able and did not want to bring about, was the exemplary test of a future oriented republic reform programme. Such an experiment would have been quite possible in Kiel ‚Äì at any rate, in the military-political area. Attempts regarding persons and structures were there. Noske didn't foster and didn't utilize them, but suffocated them before they could develop.\\" Wolfram Wette: Als bei der Torpedo-Division der erste Soldatenrat gebildet wurde. In: Frankfurter Rundschau, 12 December 1988  Aftermath: German revolution of 1918‚Äì19  Other seamen, soldiers and workers, in solidarity with the arrested, began electing workers' and soldiers' councils modeled after the Soviets of the Russian Revolution of 1917, and took over military and civil powers in many cities. On 7 November, the revolution had reached Munich, causing Ludwig III of Bavaria to flee.

As well as preaching the Gospel, the missionaries taught the villagers a variety of trades and skills. Elim's thatchers continue to be renowned for their craftsmanship. The village is picturesque and has changed little over the years. It is filled with whitewashed cottages, fruit trees and fynbos. All the roads in the village lead to the thatch roofed church. The community, still mainly Moravian, consists of farmers, farm workers and artisans. Elim is becoming known for the export of fynbos, and as an emerging area in the production of wine.Atkin, Tim, The Observer (22 February 2009).

The lordship of Bouillon was in the 10th and 11th century one of the core holdings of the Ardennes-Bouillon dynasty, and appears to have been their original patrimonial possession.Murray, p. 10. The Bouillon estate was a collection of fiefs, allodial land, and other rights. The collection included e.g. the allod villages of Bellevaux, Mogimont, Senseruth, and Assenois, the advocacy of the monastery of Saint-Hubert and Ardennes, and the land to the south of Bouillon, formerly the land of the abbey of Mouzon, now held as a fief of the Archbishop of Reims. During the 10th and 11th century, the lords of Bouillon also held, for shorter or longer periods, the Duchy of Lower Lorraine, county of Verdun, margraviate of Antwerp, along with many lesser titles. List of the Lords of Bouillon : It is difficult to draw an exact list of the Lords of Bouillon, as the Lordship did not automatically follow the better documented ducal and comital titles held by the dynasty. : Since Bouillon is believed to be the patrimonial possession of the dynasty, one would believe the lordship was inherited by the oldest son.In the case of Godfrey the Crusader, he was the second son of Godfrey the Hunchback's sister. He inherited from his childless uncle, while the older brother Eustace inherited from their father. Based on this assumption, one can set up a tentative list of the Lords of Bouillon: * Godfrey the Captive (?, possibly until abt. 1002) * Frederick, son of above, (?, possibly abt. 1002-1005) * Godfrey the Childless, younger brother of Frederick, (?, probably 1005-1023) * Gozelo, younger brother of Frederick and Godfrey, (1023-1044) * Godfrey the Bearded, son of above, (1044-1069) * Godfrey the Hunchback, son of above, (1069-1076) * Godfrey the Crusader, nephew of Godfrey the Hunchback, (1076-1096) : sold to the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge See also *Duke of Bouillon  Notes   References  Category:Lists of French nobility Category:Lists of German nobility Category:Lists of nobility of the Holy Roman Empire Category:Lists of Dutch nobility Category:Lists of Belgian nobility Category:Lists of nobility of Luxembourg Category:People from Bouillon ","title":"List of Lords of Bouillon"},{"id":"3407706","text":"Environmental policy is the commitment of an organization or government to the laws, regulations, and other policy mechanisms concerning environmental issues. These issues generally include air and water pollution, waste management, ecosystem management, maintenance of biodiversity, the management of natural resources, wildlife and endangered species. For example, concerning environmental policy, the implementation of an eco-energy-oriented policy at a global level to address the issues of global warming and climate changes could be addressed. Policies concerning energy or regulation of toxic substances including pesticides and many types of industrial waste are part of the topic of environmental policy. This policy can be deliberately taken to influence human activities and thereby prevent undesirable effects on the biophysical environment and natural resources, as well as to make sure that changes in the environment do not have unacceptable effects on humans. Definition One way is to describe environmental policy is that it comprises two major terms: environment and policy. Environment refers to the physical ecosystems, but can also take into consideration the social dimension (quality of life, health) and an economic dimension (resource management, biodiversity). Policy can be defined as a \\"course of action or principle adopted or proposed by a government, party, business or individual\\".Concise Oxford Dictionary, 1995. Thus, environmental policy tends to focus on problems arising from human impact on the environment, which is important to human society by having a (negative) impact on human values. Such human values are often labeled as good health or the 'clean and green' environment. In practice, policy analysts provide a wide variety of types of information to the public decision making process. Environmental issues typically addressed by environmental policy include (but are not limited to) air and water pollution, waste management, ecosystem management, biodiversity protection, the protection of natural resources, wildlife and endangered species, and the management of these natural resources for future generations. Relatively recently, environmental policy has also attended to the communication of environmental issues.A major article outlining and analyzing the history of environmental communication policy within the European Union has recently come out in The Information Society, a journal based in the United States. See Mathur, Piyush. \\"Environmental Communication in the Information Society: The Blueprint from Europe,\\" The Information Society: An International Journal, 25: 2, March 2009 , pp. 119‚Äì38. In contrast to environmental policy, ecological policy addresses issues that focus on achieving benefits (both monetary and non monetary) from the non human ecological world. Broadly included in ecological policy is natural resource management (fisheries, forestry, wildlife, range, biodiversity, and at-risk species). This specialized area of policy possesses its own distinctive features. Rationale The rationale for governmental involvement in the environment is often attributed to market failure in the form of forces beyond the control of one person, including the free rider problem and the tragedy of the commons. An example of an externality is when a factory produces waste pollution which may be discharged into a river, ultimately contaminating water. The cost of such action is paid by society-at- large when they must clean the water before drinking it and is external to the costs of the polluter. The free rider problem occurs when the private marginal cost of taking action to protect the environment is greater than the private marginal benefit, but the social marginal cost is less than the social marginal benefit. The tragedy of the commons is the condition that, because no one person owns the commons, each individual has an incentive to utilize common resources as much as possible. Without governmental involvement, the commons is overused. Examples of tragedies of the commons are overfishing and overgrazing. Instruments, problems, and issues Environmental policy instruments are tools used by governments and other organizations to implement their environmental policies. Governments, for example, may use a number of different types of instruments. For example, economic incentives and market- based instruments such as taxes and tax exemptions, tradable permits, and fees can be very effective to encourage compliance with environmental policy.http://www.oecd.org/about/0,3347,en_2649_34281_1_1_1_1_1,00.html http://www.oecd.org/about/0,3347,en_2649_34295_1_1_1_1_1,00.html The assumption is that corporations and other organizations who engage in efficient environmental management and are transparent about their environmental data and reporting presumably benefit from improved business and organizational performance. Bilateral agreements between the government and private firms and commitments made by firms independent of government requirement are examples of voluntary environmental measures. Another instrument is the implementation of greener public purchasing programs.en_2649_34281_1_1_1_1_ 1,00.html Several instruments are sometimes combined in a policy mix to address a particular environmental problem. Since environmental issues have many aspects, several policy instruments may be required to adequately address each one. Furthermore, a combination of different policies may give firms greater flexibility in policy compliance and reduce uncertainty as to the cost of such compliance. Ideally, government policies are to be carefully formulated so that the individual measures do not undermine one another, or create a rigid and cost-ineffective framework. Overlapping policies result in unnecessary administrative costs, increasing the cost of implementation.\\"Instrument Mixes for Environmental Policy\\" (Paris: OECD Publications, 2007) 15‚Äì16. To help governments realize their policy goals, the OECD Environment Directorate, for example, collects data on the efficiency and consequences of environmental policies implemented by the national governments.‚ÄúEnvironmental Policies and Instruments,‚Äù http://www.oecd.org/department/0,3355,en_2649_34281_1_1_1_1_1,00.html The website, www.economicinstruments.com, provides database detailing countries' experiences with their environmental policies. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, through UNECE Environmental Performance Reviews, evaluates progress made by its member countries in improving their environmental policies. The current reliance on a market-based framework has supporters and detractors. Among the detractors for example, some environmentalists contend that a more radical, overarching approach is needed than a set of specific initiatives, to deal with climate change. For example, energy efficiency measures may actually increase energy consumption in the absence of a cap on fossil fuel use, as people might drive more fuel-efficient cars. To combat this result, Aubrey Meyer calls for a 'framework-based market' of contraction and convergence. The Cap and Share and the Sky Trust are proposals based on the idea. Environmental impact assessments (EIA) are conducted to compare impacts of various policy alternatives. Moreover, although it is often assumed that policymakers make rational decisions based on the merits of the project, Eccleston and March argue that although policymakers normally have access to reasonably accurate environmental information, political and economic factors are important and often lead to policy decisions that rank environmental priorities of secondary importance. The decision-making theory casts doubt on this premise. Irrational decisions are reached based on unconscious biases, illogical assumptions, and the desire to avoid ambiguity and uncertainty.Eccleston C. and Doub P., Preparing NEPA Environmental Assessments: A Users Guide to Best Professional Practices, CRC Press Inc., 300 pages (publication date: March 2012). Eccleston identifies and describes four of the most critical environmental policy issues facing humanity: water scarcity, food scarcity, climate change, and the population paradox.Eccleston C. and March F., Global Environmental Policy: Principles, Concepts And Practice, CRC Press Inc. 412 pages (2010). Research and innovation policy Synergic to the environmental policy is the environmental research and innovation policy. An example is the European environmental research and innovation policy, which aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development. Europe is particularly active in this field, via a set of strategies, actions and programmes to promote more and better research and innovation for building a resource-efficient, climate resilient society and thriving economy in sync with its natural environment. Research and innovation in Europe are financially supported by the programme Horizon 2020, which is also open to participation worldwide.See Horizon 2020 ‚Äì the EU's new research and innovation programme http://europa.eu/rapid/press- release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm UNFCCC research shows that climate-related projects and policies that involve women are more effective. Policies, projects and investments without meaningful participation by women are less effective and often increase existing gender inequalities. Women's found climate solutions that cross political or ethnic boundaries have been particularly important in regions where entire ecosystems are under threat, e.g. small island states, the Arctic and the Amazon and in areas where people's livelihoods depend on natural resources e.g. fishing, farming and forestry. History Though the Clean Air Act 1956 in response to London's Great Smog of 1952 was a historical step forward, and the 1955 Air Pollution Control Act was the first U.S. federal legislation that pertained to air pollution, the 1960s marked the beginning of modern environmental policy making. The stage had been set for change by the publication of Rachel Carson's New York Times bestseller Silent Spring in 1962 and strengthened the Environmental movement. Earth Day founder Gaylord Nelson, then a U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, after witnessing the ravages of the 1969 massive oil spill in Santa Barbara, California, became famous for his environmental work. Administrator Ruckelshaus was confirmed by the Senate on December 2, 1970, which is the traditional date used as the birth of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Five months earlier, in July 1970, President Nixon had signed Reorganization Plan No. 3 calling for the establishment of EPA. At the time, Environmental Policy was a bipartisan issue and the efforts of the United States of America helped spark countries around the world to create environmental policies.‚ÄúManaging the Environment, Managing Ourselves: A History of American Environmental Policy‚Äù During this period, legislation was passed to regulate pollutants that go into the air, water tables, and solid waste disposal. President Nixon signed the Clean Air Act in 1970 which set the US as one of the world leaders in environmental conservation. The world's first minister of the environment was the British Politician Peter Walker from the Conservative Party in 1970. The German \\"Benzinbleigesetz\\" reduced Tetraethyllead since 1972. In the European Union, the very first Environmental Action Programme was adopted by national government representatives in July 1973 during the first meeting of the Council of Environmental Ministers.Knill, C. and Liefferink, D. (2012) The establishment of EU environmental policy. In: Jordan, A.J. and C. Adelle (ed.) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA. Since then an increasingly dense network of legislation has developed, which now extends to all areas of environmental protection including air pollution control, water protection and waste policy but also nature conservation and the control of chemicals, biotechnology and other industrial risks. EU environmental policy has thus become a core area of European politics. The German Umweltbundesamt was founded in Berlin 1974. Overall organizations are becoming more aware of their environmental risks and performance requirements. In line with the ISO 14001 standard they are developing environmental policies suitable for their organization.Eccleston, Charles H. (2010). Global Environmental Policy: Concepts, Principles, and Practice. Chapter 7. . This statement outlines environmental performance of the organization as well as its environmental objectives. Written by top management of the organization they document a commitment to continuous improvement and complying with legal and other requirements, such as the environmental policy objectives set by their governments.  Environmental policy integration  The concept of environmental policy integration (EPI) refers to the process of integrating environmental objectives into non-environmental policy areas, such as energy, agriculture and transport, rather than leaving them to be pursued solely through purely environmental policy practices. This is oftentimes particularly challenging because of the need to reconcile global objectives and international rules with domestic needs and laws. EPI is widely recognised as one of the key elements of sustainable development. More recently, the notion of ‚Äòclimate policy integration‚Äô, also denoted as ‚Äòmainstreaming‚Äô, has been applied to indicate the integration of climate considerations (both mitigation and adaptation) into the normal (often economically focused) activity of government.Taskforce on Conceptual Foundations of Earth System Governance http://www.earthsystemgovernance.net/conceptual-foundations/?page_id=144 Environmental policy studies Given the growing need for trained environmental practitioners, graduate schools throughout the world offer specialized professional degrees in environmental policy studies. While there is not a standard curriculum, students typically take classes in policy analysis, environmental science, environmental law and politics, ecology, energy, and natural resource management. Graduates of these programs are employed by governments, international organizations, private sector, think tanks, advocacy organizations, universities, and so on. Academic institutions use varying designations to refer to their environmental policy degrees. The degrees typically fall in one of four broad categories: master of arts, master of science, master of public administration, and PhD. Sometimes, more specific names are used to reflect the focus of the academic program. Notable institutions include the Balsillie School of International Affairs, SIPA at Columbia, Sciences Po Paris, Graduate Institute Geneva, University of Oxford, University of Warwick, and University of British Columbia, among others.

It is the opposite of esotropia and usually involves more severe axis deviation than exophoria. People with exotropia often experience crossed diplopia. Intermittent exotropia is a fairly common condition. \\"Sensory exotropia\\" occurs in the presence of poor vision. Infantile exotropia (sometimes called \\"congenital exotropia\\") is seen during the first year of life, and is less common than \\"essential exotropia\\" which usually becomes apparent several years later. The brain's ability to see three-dimensional objects depends on proper alignment of the eyes. When both eyes are properly aligned and aimed at the same target, the visual portion of the brain fuses the forms into a single image. When one eye turns inward, outward, upward, or downward, two different pictures are sent to the brain. This causes loss of depth perception and binocular vision. The term is from Greek exo meaning \\"outward\\" and trope meaning \\"a turning\\". Signs and symptoms The earliest sign of exotropia is usually a noticeable outward deviation of the eye. This sign may at first be intermittent, occurring when a child is daydreaming, not feeling well, or tired. It may also be more noticeable when the child looks at something in the distance. Squinting or frequent rubbing of the eyes is also common with exotropia. The child probably will not mention seeing double, i.e., double vision. However, he or she may close one eye to compensate for the problem. Generally, exotropia progresses in frequency and duration. As the disorder progresses, the eyes start to turn out when looking at close objects as well as those in the distance. If left untreated, the eye may turn out continually, causing a loss of binocular vision. In young children with any form of strabismus, the brain may learn to ignore the misaligned eye's image and see only the image from the best-seeing eye. This is called amblyopia, or lazy eye, and results in a loss of binocular vision, impairing depth perception. In adults who develop strabismus, double vision sometimes occurs because the brain has already been trained to receive images from both eyes and cannot ignore the image from the turned eye. Additionally in adults who have had exotropia since childhood, the brain may adapt to using a \\"blind-spot\\", whereby it receives images from both eyes, but no full image from the deviating eye, thus avoiding double vision, and in fact, increasing peripheral vision on the side of the deviating eye. Causes The causes of exotropia are not fully understood. Six muscles control eye movement, four that move the eye up and down and two that move it left and right. All these muscles must be coordinated and working properly for the brain to see a single image. When one or more of these muscles does not work properly, some form of strabismus may occur. Strabismus is more common in children with disorders that affect the brain such as cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, hydrocephalus, and brain tumors. One study has found that children with exotropia are three times more likely to develop a psychiatric disorder in comparison with the general population.Mayo Clinic. \\"Eye Divergence In Children Triples Risk Of Mental Illness.\\" ScienceDaily 28 November 2008. 30 November 2008McKenzie J, et al \\"Prevalence and sex differences of psychiatric disorders in young adults who had intermittent exotropia as children\\" Arch Ophthalmol 2009; 127:743-47. Treatment A comprehensive eye examination including an ocular motility (i.e., eye movement) evaluation and an evaluation of the internal ocular structures allows an eye doctor to accurately diagnose exotropia. Although glasses and/or patching therapy, exercises, or prisms may reduce or help control the outward-turning eye in some children, surgery is often required. A common form of exotropia is known as \\"convergence insufficiency\\" that responds well to orthoptic vision therapy including exercises. This disorder is characterized by an inability of the eyes to work together when used for near viewing, such as reading. Instead of the eyes focusing together on the near object, one deviates outward. Consecutive exotropia arises after an initial esotropia. Most often it results from surgical overcorrection of the initial esotropia. It can be addressed with further surgery or with vision therapy; vision therapy has shown promising results if the consecutive exotropia is intermittent, alternating, and of small magnitude. (abstract, full text) (Consecutive exotropia may however also spontaneously develop from esotropia, without surgery or botulinum toxin treatment.) Because of the risks of surgery, and because about 35% of people require at least one more surgery, many people try vision therapy first. This consists of visual exercises. Although vision therapy is generally not covered by American health insurance companies, many large insurers such as AetnaClinical policy bulletins: Vision therapy, Number 0489, 4 June 2013, for review 13 June 2013 (downloaded 21 July 2013) have recently begun offering full or partial coverage in response to recent studies. Strabismus surgery is sometimes recommended if the exotropia is present for more than half of each day or if the frequency is increasing over time. It is also indicated if a child has significant exotropia when reading or viewing near objects or if evidence shows that the eyes are losing their ability to work as a single unit (binocular vision). If none of these criteria is met, surgery may be postponed pending simple observation with or without some form of eyeglass and/or patching therapy. In very mild cases, a chance exists that the exotropia will diminish with time. The long-term success of surgical treatment for conditions such as intermittent exotropia is not well proven, and surgery can often result in a worsening of symptoms due to overcorrection. Evidence from the available literature suggests that unilateral surgery was more effective than bilateral surgery for individuals affected with intermittent exotropia. The surgical procedure for the correction of exotropia involves making a small incision in the tissue covering the eye to reach the eye muscles. The appropriate muscles are then repositioned to allow the eye to move properly. The procedure is usually done under general anesthesia. Recovery time is rapid, and most people are able to resume normal activities within a few days. Following surgery, corrective eyeglasses may be needed, and in many cases, further surgery is required later to keep the eyes straight. When a child requires surgery, the procedure is usually performed before the child attains school age. This is easier for the child and gives the eyes a better chance to work together. As with all surgery, some risks occur. However, strabismus surgery is usually a safe and effective treatment.

It has a capacity of 11,026. History and layout The stadium is located in the neighbourhood of Spangen, where it was built in 1916 as Stadion Spangen based on a plan of the architects J.H. de Roos and W.F. Overeynder. The name \\"Het Kasteel\\" (The Castle) is derived from the small building with two small towers which backs onto the south-facing tribune (Kasteel Stand) of the stadium, which looks similar to a castle. This building is the only authentical remain of the original design. It was built in 1916. The castle building, which is currently located along the length of the pitch, was originally positioned behind one of the goals. A famous incident took place at het Kasteel in November 1970, when Feyenoord goalkeeper Eddy Treijtel took a goalkick and shot a passing seagull down from the air. The stuffed bird has been on display in the museum at Feyenoord's De Kuip stadion and not in Sparta's museum much to the annoyance of some prominent Sparta supporters.Vogelhits van keeper Eddy Treijtel - AD =1928 Olympic Games= For the 1928 Summer Olympics in neighboring Amsterdam, the venue hosted two football games. The first was on 5 June when host nation Netherlands defeated Belgium 3-1 while the second was three days later when the Dutch team tied Chile 2‚Äì2. Through the years, the stands of \\"Stadion Sparta\\" were often renovated and extended, but the most radical renovation took place in 1998 and 1999: the stadium was completely rebuilt according to a plan of the architects Zwarts & Jansma. During the renovation, the pitch was turned 90 degrees. At the same time, it was renamed ENECO-stadion, after its main sponsor. That name was soon replaced by the present Het Kasteel (\\"The Castle\\"), which had already been the popular nickname for the stadium ever since it was built. The Castle was bought in November 2004 by businessman Hans van Heelsbergen, the manager of the textile company Hans Textiel and also the chairman of Sparta Rotterdam. Van Heelsbergen opened in this building a Sparta museum (and an outlet of Hans Textiel). =Tonny van Ede Stand= The Tonny van Ede stand is on the north side of the ground and stands along the length of the pitch, opposite the Kasteel Stand. The most expensive tickets are to be found here. It houses the changing rooms as well as the corporate boxes, the ticket office and the boardroom. The players' tunnel runs from the centre of this stand onto the pitch between the two dugouts. The stand was named after one of Sparta's most famous sons, Tonny van Ede, in 2010. Main entrance at Tonny van Ede stand =Denis Neville Stand= The lowest priced tickets for home fans are to be found in the Denis Neville Stand. This is at the east end of the ground behind one of the goals. It houses the more vocal supporters of the club and is usually the first stand to sell-out. The stand was named in honour of one of Sparta's most successful managers, Denis Neville. =Bok de Korver Stand= Opposite the Denis Neville Stand, the Bok de Korver Stand is assigned as the family stand but also houses the away fans. Formerly known as the West Stand, it was named after Sparta legend Bok de Korver. =Kasteel Stand= Attached to the historic Kasteel building, the Kasteel Stand is on the south end of the ground and the club shop is based here as well as the Sparta Museum.

Its senior branch, extinct in 1501, held two of the last large fiefs acquired by the French crown, the counties of Auvergne and Boulogne, for about half a century. Its cadet branch, extinct in 1802, ruled the duchy of Bouillon in the Southern Netherlands from 1594, and held the dukedoms of Albret and Ch√¢teau-Thierry in the peerage of France since 1660. The name was also borne by Philippe d'Auvergne, an alleged collateral of the original Counts of Auvergne, and was adopted by the famous soldier Th√©ophile Corret de la Tour d'Auvergne, who descended from an illegitimate line of the family.  Senior line: counts of Auvergne and Boulogne  Personal coat of arms of the counts of Auvergne and Boulogne from the House of la Tour d'Auvergne. left left Although various La Tours are mentioned in the documents from the 11th and 12th century, the family history remains unclear until the 13th century, when they owned the lordship of la Tour in the county of Auvergne, hence the name. The medieval family was related through marriages to other notable families of the French south, including Ventadour, La Rochefoucauld, and Levis-Mirepoix. The la Tours d'Auvergne maintained close ties with the Avignon popes, and many of them became bishops and cardinals, particularly after 1352, when Guy de la Tour married Marthe Rogier of Beaufort, Popes Gregory XI's niece and Clement VI's grand niece. Their son (1375‚Äì1423) married a rich heiress, Marie I, Countess of Auvergne, in 1389, with their son succeeding as Count of Auvergne and Boulogne in 1437. Bertrand V's grandson Jean III de la Tour d'Auvergne (1467‚Äì1501) was the last medieval Count of Auvergne, Boulogne, and Lauraguais. By his marriage to Jeanne of Bourbon-Vend√¥me, he had two daughters: * The elder daughter, Anne de la Tour d'Auvergne, married John Stewart, 2nd Duke of Albany, but died childless. * The younger, Madeleine de la Tour d'Auvergne, married Lorenzino de Medici and gave birth to Catherine de' Medici, who inherited both Auvergne and Boulogne, when Anne died childless. Catherine also became Queen of France. John's elder sister, Jeanne de la Tour d'Auvergne, married Aymar de Poitiers. They were the grandparents of Diane de Poitiers, mistress of King Henry II of France. The cadet line of this family, extinct in 1497, also owned the lordship of Montgascon. Anne de la Tour d'Auvergne, the last of this line and heiress to this lordship, married three times: * firstly, in 1506, to Charles of Bourbon, Count of Roussillon. * secondly, in 1510, to John of Montmorency, lord of Chantilly. * thirdly, in 1518, to her distant cousin, Francis II de la Tour, Viscount of Turenne. For her issue by the last marriage, see below.  Junior line: viscounts of Turenne and princes of Sedan  Family de Beaufort-Turenne in the 14th and 15th century. Coat of arms of viscountcy of TurenneBertrand de La Tour d'Auvergne, owner of Olliergues and several other seigneuries, was the author of the junior line of the family. He died in 1329 and was buried in Clermont-Ferrand. His great grandson William de la Tour became bishop of Rodez and Catholic Patriarch of Antioch. The latter's nephew, Agne IV of Oliergues, married in 1444 his cousin, viscountess Anne of Beaufort, succeeding to the viscounty of Turenne upon her death. Among his children, the younger, Antony Raymond, lord of Murat, became the ancestor of the obscure line of la Tour-Apchier, which rose to prominence shortly before its extinction in the 19th century. Henri de la Tour (1555-1623), Marshal of FranceAgne IV's fifth and eldest surviving son, Anthony de la Tour, succeeded him as viscount of Turenne and had two children. The youngest, Gilles de la Tour, lord of Limeuil, had issue, including Isabeau of Limeuil, known as the mistress of Louis I de Bourbon, Prince de Cond√© and mother of his natural children. Francis II de la Tour d'Auvergne, viscount of Turenne (1497‚Äì1532) was the eldest son of Anthony de la Tour and husband of Anne de la Tour de Montgascon (see above). Their grandson, Henry de la Tour d'Auvergne (1555‚Äì1623), is remembered as a faithful adherent of Henri IV's Huguenot cause and Marshal of France. His first wife was Charlotte de la Marck, heiress to the principality of Sedan and to the duchy of Bouillon. Upon her death, Henry inherited her titles and dominions and remarried Elisabeth of Orange-Nassau, William the Silent's daughter. Hoping to succeed the Orange rulers of the Netherlands, their son and heir Frederic Maurice of the Tour d'Auvergne (1605‚Äì1652) remained in the Dutch service until his marriage to El√©onore-Catherine-F√©bronie de Wassenaar de Berg, which was effected against his family's wishes in 1634 and led to his conversion to Catholicism. Compromised in the Cinq-Mars conspiracy, he was pardoned on condition that he would exchange his principalities of Sedan, Jametz, and Raucourt - highly important strategically - for the titles of duke of Albret and duke of Ch√¢teau-Thierry in the French peerage. This exchange was formalized in 1651. Although Frederic Maurice was promised to take rank from the original creation of the duchy of Ch√¢teau-Thierry for Robert III of the Marck in 1527, this could never be effected due to vocal opposition of other dukes-peers. The younger brother of Fr√©d√©ric Maurice de La Tour d'Auvergne, Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, vicomte de Turenne, (1611‚Äì1675), is undoubtedly the most illustrious member of the family. Among the most successful generals in French military history. A grateful Louis XIV honored Turenne with burial at the royal necropolis at Saint-Denis and Napol√©on considered him to be the greatest military commander of all times.  Later history: Dukes of Bouillon and Albret  Frederic-Maurice's son, Godefroy Maurice de La Tour d'Auvergne (1641‚Äì1721), was the first member of his family to become a truly sovereign duke of Bouillon. This happened in 1678 when the Duchy of Bouillon was finally reconquered from the Spaniards by the Marshal de Cr√©quy. Apart from his ducal titles, Godefroy-Maurice also held the title of Count of √âvreux. He became the Grand Chamberlain of France in 1658 and governor of Auvergne in 1662. All these titles would remain in the La Tour d'Auvergne family for more than a century. The family were created Foreign Princes in France in 1651, this entitled them to the style of [Most Serene] Highness at the French court in which they lived. Louis Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, comte d'√âvreux, builder of √âlys√©e Palace. Portrait by Hyacinthe Rigaud (ca. 1720), now in the Metropolitan Museum Godefroy-Maurice's younger brother, Count Frederic Maurice de La Tour d'Auvergne (1642‚Äì1707), was a prominent general in the service of the Dutch. He married Henrietta von Hohenzollern (1648‚Äì1698), heiress to the marquessate of Bergen-op-Zoom, a title which passed to their children. After their line became extinct in 1732, Bergen devolved upon Count Palatine Johann Christian von Sulzbach (1700‚Äì1733), who had married an heiress, Marie Henriette Leopoldine de La Tour d'Auvergne, in 1722. Godefroy-Maurice's wife, Marie Anne Mancini (1649‚Äì1714), best remembered for her literary pursuits and for her patronage of La Fontaine, was a niece of Cardinal Mazarin. Their eldest son Louis married the heiress to the dukedom of Ventadour but predeceased his parents. The Duchy of Bouillon and other titles passed to their second son, Emmanuel Th√©odose (1668‚Äì1730), whose fourth wife was Louise Henriette Fran√ßoise de Lorraine. Another son, Fr√©d√©ric-Jules, Prince d'Auvergne (1672‚Äì1733), married an Irish adventuress. Charles Godefroy de La Tour d'Auvergne (1706‚Äì1771) was Emmanuel-Th√©odose's son and the 5th Duke of Bouillon. His wife was his brother's widow, Maria Karolina Sobieska, the granddaughter of King John Sobieski of Poland. Their only daughter, Marie Louise Henriette Jeanne de La Tour, was a famous adventuress and was guillotined in 1793. Although officially married to Jules de Rohan, Duke of Montbazon, she had an illegitimate son who died in infancy by her cousin, Charles Edward Stuart, Jacobite claimant to the thrones of England and Scotland. Her brother, Godefroy Charles Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne (1728‚Äì1792), was the 6th Duke of Bouillon. He married Louise de Lorraine, known prior to marriage as Mademoiselle de Marsan. He served with distinction in the Seven Years' War and was elected to the Royal Academy of Sculpture and Painting in 1777. In just three months, he squandered almost a million livres on his mistress, an opera singer, thus bringing his family to the verge of ruin. Although the 6th duke embraced the French Revolution enthusiastically, the Duchy of Bouillon was annexed by the Republic within three years after his death. His only son, Jacques L√©opold Charles Godefroy, incapacitated by a road accident, died in 1802, leaving no issue of his marriage to a Princess of Hesse-Rheinfels. As a consequence, the main line of the La Tour d'Auvergne family became extinct.  Bouillon Succession  In 1780, the 6th Duke of Bouillon developed a friendship with Philippe d'Auvergne, a British naval officer imprisoned in France. As a family legend had it, the Dauvergne family represented a collateral branch of the ancient Counts of Auvergne, which had moved to the island of Jersey sometime in the 13th century. In 1787, the 6th Duke recognized this legendary connection and adopted Philippe d'Auvergne, calling on him to succeed his own son in the case the latter were to die without male issue. In 1809 Napoleon endorsed an arrangement, whereby the La Tour estates and liabilities pertaining to the 1651 exchange devolved upon the French state. The 6th Duke's Ch√¢teau de Navarre and the H√¥tel d'√âvreux in Paris were bequeathed to the Empress Josephine and her relatives. The H√¥tel d'√âvreux was subsequently renamed the √âlys√©e Palace and currently serves as the official residence of the President of France. As for the Duchy of Bouillon, its citizens recognized Philippe d'Auvergne as their legitimate ruler and duke. The Congress of Vienna, however, awarded the sovereignty of the duchy to the King of the Netherlands, whereas the private property holdings of the former dukes were to be redistributed by special arbitration either to Philippe d'Auvergne or to an Austrian claimant, Charles-Alain- Gabriel de Rohan-Gu√©m√©n√©, who was the last duke's closest relative in the female line. The issue was eventually settled in Rohan's favor. Philippe d'Auvergne committed suicide September 16 or 18, 1816, in the Holmes Hotel, a small hotel located at Great Smith Street in Westminster. In 1817, Rohan was sued by other claimants to the La Tour d'Auvergne estate, including the duc de Bourbon, the duc de La Tremoille, the princesse de Bourbon-Cond√© and the princesse de Poix. All were related to the 7th duke of Bouillon on his maternal side. Seven years later, their claims were upheld by a court in Li√®ge, and Rohan had to step down as duke. In the 1820s, the La Tour name and inheritance were disputed between the families of La Tour d'Auvergne d'Apchier, which represented the last known surviving line of the La Tour d'Auvergne before its eventual extinction in 1896, and \\"La Tour d'Auvergne- Lauraguais\\", a family whose kinship to the Dukes of Bouillon is unestablished. From the latter family, Prince Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne-Lauraguais (1876‚Äì1914) married in 1904 Elisabeth Berthier de Wagram (1885‚Äì1960), daughter of the third Prince de Wagram and a descendant, in female line, of the Rothschild dynasty.

It takes its name from the fairy tale character Cinderella, which is about a girl who is mistreated by her stepsisters and stepmother. Evolutionary psychologists describe the effect as a byproduct of a bias towards kin, and a conflict between reproductive partners of investing in young that are unrelated to one partner. There is both supporting evidence for this theory and criticism against it. Background In the early 1970s, a theory arose on the connection between stepparents and child maltreatment. \\"In 1973, forensic psychiatrist P. D. Scott summarized information on a sample of \\"fatal battered-baby cases\\" perpetrated in anger ... 15 of the 29 killers ‚Äì 52% ‚Äì were stepfathers.\\"Daly & Wilson (1999), p. 33 Although initially there was no analysis of this raw data, empirical evidence has since been collected on what is now called the Cinderella effect through official records, reports, and census. For over 30 years, data has been collected regarding the validity of the Cinderella effect, with a wealth of evidence indicating a direct relationship between step-relationships and abuse. This evidence of child abuse and homicide comes from a variety of sources including official reports of child abuse, clinical data, victim reports, and official homicide data.Daly & Wilson (2007) Is the \\"Cinderella Effect\\" controversial? In Crawford & Krebs (Eds) Foundations of Evolutionary Psychology, pp. 383-400. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum. Studies have concluded that \\"stepchildren in Canada, Great Britain, and the United States indeed incur greatly elevated risk of child maltreatment of various sorts, especially lethal beatings\\". Powerful evidence in support of the Cinderella effect comes from the finding that when abusive parents have both step and genetic children, they generally spare their genetic children. In such families, stepchildren were exclusively targeted 9 out of 10 times in one study and in 19 of 22 in another.Crawford (2008), p. 387 In addition to displaying higher rates of negative behaviors (e.g., abuse) toward stepchildren, stepparents display fewer positive behaviors toward stepchildren than do the genetic parents. For example, on average, stepparents invest less in education, play with stepchildren less, take stepchildren to the doctor less, etc.Crawford (2008), p. 388 This discrimination against stepchildren is unusual compared with abuse statistics involving the overall population given \\"the following additional facts: (1) when child abuse is detected, it is often found that all the children in the home have been victimized; and (2) stepchildren are almost always the eldest children in the home, whereas the general ... tendency in families of uniform parentage is for the youngest to be most frequent victims.\\" Evolutionary psychology theory Evolutionary psychologists Martin Daly and Margo Wilson propose that the Cinderella effect is a direct consequence of the modern evolutionary theory of inclusive fitness, especially parental investment theory. They argue that human child rearing is so prolonged and costly that \\"a parental psychology shaped by natural selection is unlikely to be indiscriminate\\". According to them, \\"research concerning animal social behaviour provide a rationale for expecting parents to be discriminative in their care and affection, and more specifically, to discriminate in favour of their own young\\".Daly & Wilson (1999), p. 8 Inclusive fitness theory proposes a selective criterion for the evolution of social traits, where social behavior that is costly to an individual organism can nevertheless emerge when there is a statistical likelihood that significant benefits of that social behavior accrue to (the survival and reproduction of) other organisms whom also carry the social trait (most straightforwardly, accrue to close genetic relatives). Under such conditions, a net overall increase in reproduction of the social trait in future generations can result. The initial presentation of inclusive fitness theory (in the mid 1960s) focused on making the mathematical case for the possibility of social evolution, but also speculated about possible mechanisms whereby a social trait could effectively achieve this necessary statistical correlation between its likely bearers. Two possibilities were considered: One that a social trait might reliably operate straightforwardly via social context in species where genetic relatives are usually concentrated in a local home area where they were born ('viscous populations'); The other, that genetic detection mechanisms ('supergenes') might emerge that go beyond statistical correlations, and reliably detect actual genetic relatedness between the social actors using direct 'kin recognition'. The relative place of these two broad types of social mechanisms has been debated (see Kin selection and Kin recognition), but many biologists consider 'kin recognition' to be an important possible mechanism. Martin Daly and Margo Wilson follow this second mechanism, and expect that parents \\"discriminate in favour of their own young\\", i.e. their actual genetic relatives. =Daly and Wilson research= The most abundant data on stepchild mistreatment has been collected and interpreted by psychologists Martin Daly and Margo Wilson, who study with an emphasis in Neuroscience and Behavior at McMaster University. Their first measure of the validity of the Cinderella effect was based on data from the American Humane Association (AHA), an archive of child abuse reports in the United States holding over twenty thousand reports.Daly & Wilson (1999), p. 26 These records led Wilson and Daly to conclude that \\"a child under three years of age who lived with one genetic parent and one stepparent in the United States in 1976 was about seven times more likely to become a validated child-abuse case in the records than one who dwelt with two genetic parents\\".Daly & Wilson (1999), p. 27 Their overall findings demonstrate that children residing with stepparents have a higher risk of abuse even when other factors are considered. Explanation All organisms face trade-offs as to how to invest their time, energy, risk, and other resources, so investment in one domain (e.g., parental investment) generally takes away from their ability to invest in other domains (e.g. mating effort, growth, or investment in other offspring). Investment in non-genetic children therefore reduces an individual's ability to invest in itself or its genetic children, without directly bringing reproductive benefits. Thus, from an evolutionary biology perspective, one would not expect organisms to regularly and deliberately care for unrelated offspring. Daly and Wilson point out that infanticide is an extreme form of biasing parental investment that is widely practiced in the animal world. For example, when an immigrant male lion enters a pride, it is not uncommon for him to kill the cubs fathered by other males. Since the pride can only provide support for a limited number of cubs to survive to adulthood, the killing of the cubs in competition with the new male's potential offspring increases the chances of his progeny surviving to maturity. In addition, the act of infanticide speeds the return to sexual receptivity in the females, allowing for the male to father his own offspring in a timelier manner. These observations indicate that in the animal world, males employ certain measures in order to ensure that parental investment is geared specifically toward their own offspring. Unlike the lion, however, humans in a stepparenting situation face a more complicated tradeoff since they cannot completely disown their partner's offspring from a previous relationship, as they would risk losing sexual access to their partner and any chance of producing potential offspring. Thus, according to Daly and Wilson, stepparental investment can be viewed as mating effort to ensure the possibility of future reproduction with the parent of their stepchild. This mating effort hypothesis suggests that humans will tend to invest more in their genetic offspring and invest just enough in their stepchildren. It is from this theoretical framework that Daly and Wilson argue that instances of child abuse towards non-biological offspring should be more frequent than towards biological offspring. One would therefore expect greater parental responsiveness towards one's own offspring than towards unrelated children, and this will result in more positive outcomes and fewer negative outcomes towards one's own children than towards other children in which one is expected to invest (i.e., stepchildren). \\"If child abuse is a behavioral response influenced by natural selection, then it is more likely to occur when there are reduced inclusive fitness payoffs owing to uncertain or low relatedness\\". Owing to these adaptations from natural selection, child abuse is more likely to be committed by stepparents than genetic parents‚Äîboth are expected to invest heavily in the children, but genetic parents will have greater child-specific parental love that promotes positive caretaking and inhibits maltreatment. Daly and Wilson report that this parental love can explain why genetic offspring are more immune to lashing out by parents.Daly & Wilson (1988), p. 83 They assert that, \\"Child- specific parental love is the emotional mechanism that permits people to tolerate‚Äîeven to rejoice in‚Äîthose long years of expensive, unreciprocated parental investment\\". They point to a study comparing natural father and stepfather families as support for the notion that stepparents do not view their stepchildren the same as their biological children, and likewise, children do not view their stepparents the same as their biological parents.Buss (1996), p. 22 This study, based on a series of questionnaires which were then subjected to statistical analyses, reports that children are less likely to go to their stepfathers for guidance and that stepfathers rate their stepchildren less positively than do natural fathers. Daly and Wilson's reports on the overrepresentation of stepparents in child homicide and abuse statistics support the evolutionary principle of maximizing one's inclusive fitness, formalized under Hamilton's Rule, which helps to explain why humans will preferentially invest in close kin. Adoption statistics also substantiate this principle, in that non-kin adoptions represent a minority of worldwide adoptions. Research into the high adoption rates of Oceania shows that childlessness is the most common reason for adopting, and that in the eleven populations for which data was available, a large majority of adoptions involved a relative with a coefficient of relatedness greater than or equal to 0.125 (e.g., genetic cousins). It is also observed that parents with both biological and adopted children bias the partitioning of their estates in favor of the biological children, demonstrating again that parental behavior corresponds to the principles of kin selection. Methods In their 1985 Canadian sample, Daly and Wilson classify the frequencies of different living arrangements (two natural parents, one natural parent, one natural parent with one stepparent, or other) according to child age. This was accomplished by administering a randomized telephone survey. Records of child abuse from children's aid organizations as well as police reports on runaways and juvenile offenders were then used to determine whether children from stepparental living situations were overrepresented as abuse victims when compared to the demographic data gathered from the telephone survey data. The results indicate that the only living situation that has a significant correlation to increased child abuse is one natural parent and one stepparent in the same household. While rates of running away and crime were comparable for children living with stepparents and children of single-parents, abuse rates for children living with stepparents were much higher. Daly and Wilson examined several potentially confounding variables in their research, including socioeconomic status, family size, and maternal age at childbirth, however only minor differences between natural-parent and stepparent families with respect to these factors were found, indicating that none of these are major contributing factors to the observed Cinderella effect. =Attachment theory= Evolutionary psychologists have also suggested that one of the causes of stepchild abuse may be the lack of a parental attachment bond that the mother would normally form with her own child . An attachment bond will, in general, be more secure if formed before the age of two, and adoption can often disrupt the development of this bond. An infant who is fed by the primary parental figure, usually the mother, and has the mother present during severely physically painful events will have form a stronger parental attachment bond, and either a consistent omission of the mother from this process or an alteration between two people (the original mother and the adoptive mother) can cause either an insecure attachment or disorganized attachment from the parent to the child . As a result, it is highly recommended by most psychologists that the adoptive mother be present very early in the infant's life, preferably immediately after its birth, in order to avoid attachment disruptions and attachment disorders. This theory cannot be a whole explanation for the Cinderella effect, as psychological research has shown that secure attachment bonds can be developed between a parent and adopted child, and the quality of the relationship between parent and child will more often depend on the child's pre-adoption experiences, such as length of time in social care and previous trauma, more than characteristics of the parents. =Misunderstandings= It is sometimes argued that this evolutionary psychological account does not explain why the majority of stepparents do not abuse their partners' children, or why a significant minority of genetic parents do abuse their own offspring. However, their argument is based on a misunderstanding: the evolutionary psychological account is that (all else equal) parents will love their own children more than other people's children ‚Äì it does not argue that stepparents will \\"want\\" to abuse their partner's children, or that genetic parenthood is absolute proof against abuse. Under this account, stepparental care is seen as \\"mating effort\\" towards the genetic parent, such that most interactions between stepparent and stepchildren will be generally positive or at least neutral, just usually not as positive as interactions between the genetic parent and the child would be.Daly & Wilson (1999) Supportive evidence Strong support for the Cinderella effect as described by Daly and Wilson comes from a study of unintentional childhood fatal injuries in Australia. Tooley et al. follow the argument of Daly and Wilson to extend the Cinderella effect from cases of abuse to incidences of unintentional fatalities. Children are not only vulnerable to abuse by their parents, but they are also dependent on their parents for supervision and protection from a variety of other harms. Given that parental supervision is fundamentally correlated to incidences of unintentional childhood injury as shown by Wadsworth et al. and Peterson & Stern, Tooley et al. posit that selective pressures would favor an inclination towards parental vigilance against threats to offspring well-being. Tooley et al. further argue that parental vigilance is not as highly engaged in stepparents as genetic parents, therefore placing stepchildren at greater risk for unintentional injury. Based on data gathered from the Australia National Coroners' Information System, stepchildren under five years of age are two to fifteen times more likely to experience an unintentional fatal injury, especially drowning, than genetic children. Additionally, the study finds that the risks of unintentional fatal injury are not significantly higher for genetic children in single parent homes versus two-parent homes. This difference suggests that removing one biological parent from the home does not significantly increase risk to the children, but that adding a nonbiological parent to the home results in a drastic increase in the risk of unintentional fatal injury. Despite the fact that adding a stepparent to the home increases the available resources in terms of supervision in comparison to a single-parent home, risk of unintentional fatal injury still significantly rises. This higher risk of injury for stepchildren can be attributed to the fact that stepparents occupy the same supervisory role as a genetic parent, yet they have a lower intrinsic commitment to protecting the child and therefore are less likely to be adequately vigilant. The authors conclude that the Cinderella effect applies not only to purposeful abuse by stepparents, but is also relevant to explaining increased rates of accidental fatalities among stepchildren. Furthermore, a study of parental investment behaviors among American men living in Albuquerque, New Mexico, reveals a trend of increasing financial expenditures on genetic offspring in comparison to step-offspring, which also suggests that parents are less inclined to preserve the well-being of stepchildren. The study assesses paternal investment based on four measures: the probability that a child attends college, the probability that the child receives money for college, the total money spent on children, and the amount of time per week spent with children. Four different classifications of father-child relationships are examined and compared, including fathers living with their genetic children and stepfathers living with the stepchildren of their current mates. Though the study finds a clear trend of increasing investment in genetic children, the data also shows that stepfathers do still invest substantially in stepchildren. The authors explain the parental investment exhibited by stepfathers towards stepchildren as possibly motivated by the potential to improve the quality or increase the duration of the man's relationship with the stepchildren's mother. This studied corroborates the findings of Lynn White, that stepparents in general provide less social support to stepchildren than their genetic children.White (1994), pp. 109‚Äì137 Though the general trend of the data from this study supports the Cinderella effect, Anderson and colleagues note that the observed differences between investment in children and stepchildren might be slightly reduced by a few confounding factors. For example, the authors point out that stepparenting is a self-selective process, and that when all else is equal, men who bond with unrelated children are more likely to become stepfathers, a factor that is likely to be a confounding variable in efforts to study the Cinderella effect. Anderson and colleagues also conducted a similar study of Xhosa students in South Africa that analyzes the same four classifications of adult-child relationships, and this study offers similar results to those observed among men in Albuquerque. Additionally, a study of Hadza foragers in Tanzania by Marlowe also finds evidence of decreased care provided by men to stepchildren when compared with genetic children. The author uses the Mann-Whitney U-tests to evaluate most of the observed differences in care exhibited towards children and stepchildren, and finds that Hadza men spend less time with (U=96), communicate less with (U=94.5), nurture less, and never play with their stepchildren. Marlowe further argues that any care that is provided towards stepchildren is likely attributable to the man's mating efforts and not parental interest in the well-being of the stepchildren. In further support of the Cinderella effect as elaborated by Daly and Wilson, a study conducted in a rural village in Trinidad demonstrates that in households containing both genetic children and stepchildren, fathers devote approximately twice as much time to interaction with genetic offspring in comparison to stepchildren. Additionally, this study finds that the duration of the relationship between the stepfather and stepchildren is negatively correlated with the relative proportion of interaction time and positively correlated with the relative proportion of antagonistic interactions between the two. As a proportion of total time spent interacting with genetic and stepchildren, stepfathers are shown to have approximately 75 percent more antagonistic interactions with stepchildren. In this study, antagonistic interactions are defined as involving physical or verbal combat or an expression of injury. This includes, for example, spanking, screaming, crying, and arguing. The duration of the relationship between genetic fathers and children shows a positive correlation with both relative proportion of interaction time and antagonistic interaction. The author argues that these results show that in terms of time invested, men favor their children over stepchildren, and this preference is not attributable to the duration of the adult-child relationship, a factor which is sometimes believed to be a confounding variable in the Cinderella effect. Though this study does claim a significant increase in antagonistic behavior between stepparents and stepchildren and therefore supports the Cinderella effect, it also notes that only six percent of all the observed parent-child interactions were considered antagonistic, and that the researchers never noticed any blatant physical child abuse. Criticism = David Buller = Philosopher of science David Buller, as a part of his general critique of evolutionary psychology has reviewed Daly and Wilson's data. He argues that evolutionary psychology (EP) mistakenly attempts to discover human psychological adaptations rather than \\"the evolutionary causes of psychological traits.\\" Buller also argues that Daly and Wilson's 1985 Canadian sample included cases of sexual abuse as well as cases of unintentional omission, such as not buckling a child's seatbelt in the car. Buller asserts that unintentional omission does not fall under the realm of dangerous acts, and rather should be designated \\"maltreatment\\". He argues that since sexual abuse is not often accompanied by physical abuse, it is unreasonable to assume that it is motivated by the same kind of psychological mechanism as child homicide. Buller also points out that the conclusion that non-biological parents are more likely to abuse children is contradicted by the fact that even if the rate of abuse among stepparents was disproportionate, the lowest rate of child abuse is found among adoptive parents. Daly and Wilson respond to Buller's criticism by stating that Buller confuses the empirical statistical findings, which define the Cinderella effect, with the proposed theoretical framework, which offers an evolutionary explanation for the data. Buller also argues that Daly and Wilson's findings are inherently biased since they use data from official documents, and the officials collecting that data are trained to take special notice of stepparents versus biological parents. Furthermore, Buller states that since Daly and Wilson rely on official reports (such as death certificates) for their data, and that this data is inherently biased against stepparents. He cites a Colorado study, in which it was found that maltreatment fatalities were more likely to be correctly reported on death certificates when an unrelated individual was the perpetrator rather than when a parent was the perpetrator, suggesting that the data is empirically skewed to support the Cinderella effect. According to this study, by Crume et al., when the perpetrator of the murder was a parent, maltreatment was correctly noted on the death certificate only 46 percent of the time. Furthermore, they found that when the perpetrator was an \\"Other unrelated (including boyfriend)\\" individual, maltreatment was reported on the death certificate 86 percent of the time, significantly higher than for parents. Although these statistics seem to provide evidence of bias against stepparents, further review of the data undermines this conclusion. As Crume et al. and Daly and Wilson note, maltreatment was only likely to be reported on the death certificates 47 percent of the time in the case of \\"Other relatives (including step-parents),\\" which represents a marginal increase from the amount of parental maltreatment. Therefore, as Daly and Wilson respond to Buller's critique, this does not seem to be a significant source of error in studying the Cinderella effect and does not provide evidence for inherent bias in their data. = Temrin et al. Sweden study = The findings of Daly and Wilson have been called into question by one study of child homicides in Sweden between 1975 and 1995, which found that children living in households with a non-genetic parent were not at an increased risk of homicide when compared to children living with both genetic parents. The study, published in 2000 and conducted by Temrin and colleagues argued that when Daly and Wilson classified homicides according to family situation, they did not account for the genetic relatedness of the parent who actually committed the crime. In the Swedish sample, in two out of the seven homicides with a genetic and non-genetic parent, the offender was actually the genetic parent and thus these homicides do not support Daly and Wilson's definition of the Cinderella effect. Daly and Wilson attribute the contrasting findings of the Swedish study to an analytical oversight. Temrin and colleagues neglect to consider the fact that the proportion of children in living situations with a stepparent is not constant for all child age groups, but rather increases with age. After correcting for age differences, the Swedish data set produces results in accordance with the previous findings of Daly and Wilson. The Swedish sample does show, however, decreased risk to children living with a stepparent compared to the North American samples collected by Daly and Wilson, suggesting that there is some degree of cross- cultural variation in the Cinderella effect. =Alternative hypotheses= It has been noted by multiple researchers that child abuse is an intricate issue and is affected by other factors. Daly and Wilson state, however, that even if evolutionary psychology cannot account for every instance of stepparental abuse, this does not invalidate their empirical findings. Burgess and Drais propose that child maltreatment is too complex to be explained fully by genetic relatedness alone and cite other reasons for child maltreatment, such as social factors, ecological factors and child traits such as disability and age. However, they also note that these traits are simply indicative, and do not inevitably lead to child maltreatment. Temrin and colleagues also suggest that there may be other factors involved with child homicide, such as prior convictions, drug abuse problems, lost custody battles and mental health problems. In 1984, Giles-Sims and David Finkelhor categorized and evaluated five possible hypotheses that could explain the Cinderella effect: \\"social- evolutionary theory\\", \\"normative theory\\", \\"stress theory\\", \\"selection factors\\", and \\"resource theory\\". The social-evolutionary theory is based on the proposal that non-genetically related parents will invest less in costly parental duties, due to the fact that their genes are not being passed on by that individual. The normative theory proposes that, due to genetic repercussions, incest among genetically related individuals is a widespread taboo and would thus be less common among biological relatives. They propose that incest among stepfamilies would be less taboo, since there is no risk of genetic degradation. The stress theory proposes that increased stressors, which are inherently more common among stepfamilies, cause an increased risk of abuse. The selection factors theory proposes that individuals who are likely to be stepparents (divorcees) are likely to be inherently more violent due to emotional disturbances, aggressive impulses, and self-esteem issues. Due to this, stepparents as a group would have a higher proportion of individuals with violent-prone characteristics, which would suggest that the abuse is happening due to personality factors, rather than the stepparental relationship directly. Finally, according to resource theory, individuals who contribute resources are granted authority, while individuals that lack resources are denied authority and more likely to resort to violence to obtain authority. It is therefore hypothesized that stepparents who are able to contribute resources to a family and have those resources be accepted by the family are less likely to be abusive. However, this hypothesis had yet to be tested directly on stepfamilies. This paper of Giles-Sims and Finkelhor predates however practically all empirical studies on the Cinderella effect. =Ethical issues= Discussing the implications of this line of research, Australian psychologist Greg Tooley, author of a 2006 study confirming the existence of the effect, confessed that \\"it is certainly difficult to talk about because it is such a hot issue\\".Andrew Trounson, Children 'safer with biological parent' , The Australian, May 07, 2008 See also Notes References  * *  Further reading  * * Nigel Barber (June 1, 2009), Do parents favor natural children over adopted ones?, The Human Beast blog on Psychology Today, discussing:  Mindelle Jacobs (July 4, 2010), The Cinderella effect is not just a fairy tale, Edmonton Sun Category:Child abuse Category:Evolutionary psychology Category:Childhood Category:Abuse Category:Family Category:Foster care Category:Parenting Category:Kinship and descent Category:Cinderella ","title":"Cinderella effect"},{"id":"3407801","text":"ABC1 is the former name of the main television channel from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in Australia.

The fifth tropical cyclone, named storm, and hurricane of the 1961 Atlantic hurricane season, Esther developed from an area of disturbed weather hundreds of miles west-southwest of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands on September 10\\\\. Moving northwestward, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Esther on September 11, before reaching hurricane intensity on the following day. Early on September 13, Esther curved westward and deepened into a major hurricane. The storm remained a Category 3 hurricane for about four days and gradually moved in a west-northwestward direction. Late on September 17, Esther strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane with sustained winds of on September 18\\\\. The storm curved north-northeastward on September 19, while offshore of North Carolina. Esther began to weaken while approaching New England and fell to Category 3 intensity on September 21\\\\. The storm turned eastward early on the following day, and rapidly weakened to a tropical storm. Esther then executed a large cyclonic loop, until curving northward on September 25\\\\. Early on the following day, Esther struck Cape Cod, hours before emerging into the Gulf of Maine. Later on September 26, the storm made landfall in southeastern Maine, before weakening to a tropical depression and becoming extratropical over southeastern Quebec. The remnants persisted for about 12 hours, before dissipating early on September 27\\\\. Between North Carolina and New Jersey, effects were primarily limited to strong winds and minor beach erosion and coastal flooding due to storm surge. In New York, strong winds led to severe crop losses and over 300,000 power outages. High tides caused coastal flooding and damage to a number of pleasure boats. Similar impact was reported in Massachusetts. Additionally, some areas observed more than of rainfall, flooding basements, low-lying roads, and underpasses. Overall, damage was minor, totaling about $6 million (1961 USD). There were also seven deaths reported when a United States Navy P5M aircraft crashed about north of Bermuda. Meteorological history On September 10, the Television Infrared Observation Satellite observed an area of convection, or thunderstorms, to the southwest of the Cape Verde islands, suggesting the possibility of tropical cyclogenesis. At 18:00 UTC that day, a tropical depression formed and subsequently moved on a northwest trajectory. By the time the Hurricane Hunters reached the system on September 12, winds of hurricane force were recorded, and as such, the San Juan, Puerto Rico Weather Bureau began issuing warnings on Hurricane Esther. It was later estimated that the system attained tropical storm status on September 11, although the National Hurricane Center later noted that it could have attained hurricane status by this date, thus potentially being one of four simultaneous hurricanes, along with hurricanes Betsy, Carla, and Debbie. The only other such occasions were in 1893 and 1998. This also made Esther the first hurricane to be discovered by satellite imagery, although not the first to be imaged by one. After becoming a hurricane, Esther turned more to the west- northwest, influenced by the strengthening Bermuda High that built behind Hurricane Debbie well to the north. By September 13, the storm attained major hurricane status, which is a Category 3 on the current-day Saffir-Simpson scale with sustained winds of . By that time, the gale force winds extended about from the center, with hurricane-force winds spreading to the north. After maintaining winds of for about two days, Esther weakened slightly on September 16 while passing well north of the Lesser Antilles. On the next day, the hurricane passed about north of Puerto Rico. Late on September 17, the barometric pressure fell to in the center of Esther, and operationally the Hurricane Hunters estimated winds of . This was later lowered slightly to , which would be its peak intensity attained on September 18, making it a Category 4 hurricane. However, reanalysis as part of the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project concluded that Esther was in fact a Category 5 hurricane with winds of 160 mph (260 km/h) and a minimum pressure of ; this has now been officially incorporated into HURDAT.https://ams.confex.com/ams/33HURRICANE/webprogram/Paper339830.html Around the time of attaining peak winds, Esther began moving more to the northwest toward the east coast of the United States, influenced by a dissipating cold front that exited the coast on September 15\\\\. On September 20, the hurricane passed about east of Cape Hatteras while turning to the north-northeast while gradually weakening. It continued up the coastline, later passing about east of the Delmarva Peninsula. Another trough from the west steered Esther to the northeast and was expected to cause the storm to accelerate, potentially bringing it over Cape Cod. While turning, the hurricane passed about south of the eastern tip of Long Island, southeast of Block Island, and just south of Nantucket Island, while a Category 1 hurricane at the time. After the trough bypassed the hurricane, Esther slowed and turned to the east - away from land and over much cooler waters. It weakened to tropical storm status on September 22, and on that day the Weather Bureau discontinued advisories, remarking that Esther no longer had tropical characteristics. As a weakened tropical storm, Esther turned to the southeast and gradually executed a large loop. On September 24, it turned back to the west and subsequently turned back to the north, influenced by another approaching trough. Warmer waters allowed the storm to re-intensify slightly. As a result, the Boston Weather Bureau reissued advisories on the storm on September 25 while Esther was south of Nantucket. The storm crossed over eastern Cape Cod while gradually weakening, making a final landfall near Rockland, Maine, on September 26. After crossing into Canada, Esther became extratropical early on September 27 while continuing to the east-northeast. It was last noted at 06:00 UTC that day while over eastern Quebec. Preparations While Esther was becoming a powerful hurricane over the open Atlantic, the San Juan Weather Bureau office issued a small craft advisory for the Leeward Islands, United States Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Bahamas, and Bermuda. Because of uncertainty about the storm's future path, the Weather Bureau advised residents along the east coast of the United States to closely follow the storm. The agency later issued a hurricane watch from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to Norfolk, Virginia on September 18. In Norfolk, Virginia, between 10,000 and 15,000 people were evacuated to emergency shelters on September 19, but were able to return home the next day as Esther passed far to the east. Preparations for Esther were described by the National Weather Service's Norfolk bureau as \\"the most thorough ever seen here\\" at the time. Naval ships and aircraft carriers based in the city headed for open waters to endure the storm, while over 200 military airplanes were flown inland away from the coast. The National Weather Service, in anticipation of a possible landfall in the Carolinas, issued a gale warning and a hurricane watch from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to Norfolk, Virginia on September 18 (tropical storm warnings were not issued at the time). A hurricane warning was issued from Cherry Point, North Carolina to the Virginia capes on September 19, but was discontinued early on September 20 as the hurricane passed to the east. A hurricane watch was also issued from Cape May, New Jersey to the Massachusetts coast on September 19, and like the warning, was discontinued on September 20. As Esther began to parallel the coastline, a hurricane warning was issued for coastal areas from Long Island to Provincetown, Massachusetts on September 20, and were extended to Eastport, Maine early on September 21. All hurricane watches were discontinued on September 21 as Esther moved away from the New England coast, and all hurricane warnings were downgraded to gale warnings later that day as Esther passed near Nantucket and weakened to a tropical storm, and all warnings were discontinued on September 22 after the storm moved away from the coast. After Esther completed its anticyclonic loop over the northwestern Atlantic, a gale warning was again issued from Provincetown, Massachusetts to Eastport, Maine on September 25, and was discontinued the next day after Esther made its second landfall in Maine. Personnel on two offshore surveillance stations called the Texas Towers were evacuated; a third tower had collapsed during a storm in January 1961, prompting higher safety standards. Impact and aftermath A powerful hurricane, Esther produced high waves and strong swells across much of the western Atlantic, including along the north coast of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Bahamas. =North Carolina and Virginia= In North Carolina, the outer edges of Esther brought sustained winds of with gusts up to . A storm surge of was reported in Wilmington, North Carolina. The storm surge caused minor flooding and beach erosion in the Outer Banks, where road damage was extensive. Damage to property, however, was minimal, and the storm's effects in the Wilmington area were compared to those of \\"a good nor'easter\\" by the local weather bureau. Southeastern Virginia experienced tides above normal, which flooded some coastal highways in the Hampton Roads area. There was minor beach erosion in the Norfolk area due to turbulent seas. =Mid-Atlantic= Rainfall totals from Hurricane Esther Esther mainly produced heavy rainfall and gale-force wind gusts along the coasts of Maryland and Delaware. These areas also experienced storm surges of above normal. Wind gusts to were observed at Ocean City, Maryland, and storm surge flooding caused damage to the city's sea wall and boardwalk. Minor to moderate damage was reported along the New Jersey coast. A wind gust of was observed in Atlantic City. Winds downed trees and power lines and damaged apple crops. Storm surge resulted in minor beach erosion and wrecked some boats. Damage totaled less than $1 million. In New York, sustained winds of and gusts up to in Putnam and Rockland counties downed numerous trees, caused power outages, and damaged crops. Farther south on Long Island, the hardest hit areas were Nassau and eastern Suffolk counties. Wind gusts up to felled trees and power lines, leaving over 300,000 homes without electricity; minor structure damage was also reported. Downed power lines and minor flooding due to rainfall amounts of up to also caused public transportation delays on Long Island. Tides as high as damaged many pleasure boats. Minor flooding was reported in Queens and Brooklyn. Damage likely exceeded $3 million, with nearly one-third of that amount incurred to crops and property each. =New England= In Connecticut, sustained winds between and gusts between caused electrical and phone service outages, as well as generally minor property damage. There was also some loss to crops, especially apples and corn. Similar impact was reported farther east in Rhode Island, though winds were much stronger, with sustained winds of and a gust up to observed at Block Island. Tides ranging from above normal damaged small crafts and caused severe beach erosion, destroying a parking lot and washing out several roads. In south-central and northeastern Maine, precipitation totals between flooded basements, underpasses, and low-lying roads, resulting in traffic being delayed by detours. Strong winds were also observed in eastern Massachusetts, with the strongest wind gust being in Chatham. Despite gale and storm force wind gusts in eastern Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire, damage was minimal and consisted mainly of downed trees and isolated power outages. Rainfall totals ranged from in southern Maine to around in the Boston area. The storm separated Smith's Point from the rest of Nantucket Island, creating what came to be known as Esther's Island (which has since re-connected in 1988, re- separated, and re-connected again in 2009). In all, Esther caused an estimated $6 million (1961 USD) in damage. =Navy plane crash= While over open waters, Esther caused seven indirect deaths when a United States Navy P5M aircraft crashed about north of Bermuda. A merchant ship, the African Pilot, was in the area where the plane crashed when the captain of the ship received a message from the Bermuda Coast Guard that \\"We have aircraft in trouble in that vicinity...\\" The captain of the African Pilot diverted the ship in order to assist the Coast Guard's search for the lost plane. The heavy seas brought by Esther made search-and-rescue efforts difficult. In the end, only three of the ten crewmen were rescued; the other seven were declared lost at sea. The survivors told Coast Guard officials that during the storm, one of the engines of the plane failed, along with most of the electrical power; as a result, the crew was unable to drop the reserve tank or close the bomb bay doors automatically. Before the crew could close the bomb bay doors manually, the plane crashed in shark-infested waters and broke apart; three of the crewmen were able to get out of the downed plane, but the other seven were unable to escape. The three survivors were then attacked by sharks before being rescued. Project Stormfury Eye of Hurricane Esther viewed from a Weather Bureau plane Hurricane Esther was also one of the first targets of a Navy experiment in modifying or weakening hurricanes by seeding them. On September 16, a Navy plane flew into the eye of Esther about northeast of Puerto Rico, and dropped canisters of silver iodide into the storm. Note: This replaces a prior citation to an expired Google Cache entry accessed 2006-07-04; some details for this citation were taken from the reference list for the online article An overview of hurricanes . The hurricane appeared to weaken slightly in response to the seeding, reportedly by ten percent. This weakening was temporary, however, as the hurricane resumed strengthening shortly after. The aircraft returned the next day to seed again, but the seeding canisters fell outside the eyewall with no effect on its structure, and the hurricane continued to strengthen. Despite this result, the experiment was deemed a success, and led to the establishment of Project Stormfury.

Private life Sidney Smith was the son of Elliot Smith and Lavinia Barton. His brother in law was Addison Emery Verrill. Smith married Eugenia Pocahontas Barber in New Haven, Connecticut on June 29, 1882. The couple had no children, and Eugenia died on March 14, 1916. Smith suffered from hereditary glaucoma, rendering him partially sighted from 1906, and completely blind some years before his death. He died on May 6, 1926 of throat cancer.  Education and career  In his youth, Sidney Irving Smith became expert on the fauna around his home town, and an expert at making collections, particularly of insects. He studied at the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University, and received his Ph.B. in 1867. Yale University conferred upon him the honorary degree of M.A. in 1887. He stayed on at Yale, initially as an assistant, but from 1875 as the first professor of comparative anatomy, a post he retained until his retirement in 1906. Thereafter, Smith remained at Yale as professor emeritus. Having begun as an entomologist (being State Entomologist of Maine and Connecticut for a number of years), Smith changed relatively early in his career to the study of crustaceans, probably because of his work with the United States Fish Commission. He participated in many field excursions, sometimes in collaboration with Verrill or with Louis Agassiz. Smith was the chief zoologist during the dredging of Lake Superior carried out by the United States Lake Survey in 1871, and the dredging in the region of St. George's Banks in 1872 carried out by the United States Coast Survey. In 1884, Smith was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. Legacy Smith produced more than 70 original papers. His collections are now housed in the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale and at the National Museum of Natural History. Sidney Irving Smith was honoured in the specific epithets of a number of species.

It was divided into 100 cents. Until the 1940s, the plural in Dutch was cents, with centen appearing on some early paper money, but after the 1940s the Dutch plural became cent. History The Surinamese guilder was initially at par with the Dutch guilder. In 1940, following the occupation of the Netherlands, the currency (along with the Netherlands Antillean guilder) was pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of 1.88585 guilders = 1 dollar. The Surinamese guilder suffered from high inflation in the beginning of the 1990s. It was replaced by the Surinamese dollar on 1 January 2004 at a rate of 1 dollar = 1,000 guilders. To save cost of manufacturing, coins of less than 5 guilders (all denominated in cents) were made legal for their face value in the new currency. Thus, these coins increased their purchasing power by a thousandfold overnight. Coins Coin of 25 cents from 1976 Until 1942, Dutch coins circulated in Suriname. Starting that year, coins were minted in the United States for use in Netherlands Guiana, some of which also circulated in the Netherlands Antilles. These coins were in denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 25 cents. In 1962, coins were introduced bearing the name Suriname for the first time. These were in denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 25 cents and 1 guilder. The 1 cent was bronze, the 5-cent nickel-brass, the 10 and 25 cents were cupro-nickel and the 1 guilder was silver. Aluminium 1- and 5-cent coins were introduced in 1974 and 1976. In 1987, copper-plated steel replaced aluminium in the 1- and 5-cent coins and cupro-nickel 100- and 250-cent coins were introduced. Banknotes Banknote of 25,000 guilders of the final series of the Surinamese guilder. In 1826, the Algemene Nederlandsche Maatschappij (General Netherlands Company) issued - and 3-guilder notes. These were followed in 1829 by notes of the West Indies Bank in denominations of , 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 and 50 guilders. The Bank introduced 10, 15 and 25 centen and 25 guilder notes in 1837, followed by 100, 200 and 300 guilder notes in 1865. The Surinaamsche Bank introduced 50 guilder notes in 1901, followed by 10 guilders in 1915, 200 guilders in 1925, 50 guilders in 1926, 100 guilders in 1927, 5 guilders in 1935, guilders in 1940, 25 guilders in 1941, 1000 guilders in 1943 and 300 guilders in 1948. The government issued silver certificates (zilverbonnen) between 1918 and 1920 for , 1 and guilders. Further issues for 50 cents and 1 guilder were introduced in 1940. The 50-cent coin was issued until 1942, with guilders being introduced in 1950. The silver certificates were superseded in 1960 by muntbiljet for 1 and guilders, which were issued until 1985. In 1957, the Central Bank of Suriname took over paper money production, issuing notes for 5, 10, 25, 100 and 1,000 guilders. Five-hundred-guilder notes were introduced in 1982, followed by 250 guilders in 1988. Two-thousand-guilder notes were introduced in 1995, followed by 5,000 and 10,000 guilders in 1997 and 25,000 guilders in 2000. The last series of banknotes was introduced in 2000 in denominations of 5, 10, 25, 100, 500, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000 and 25,000 guilders.

Siege, attempted relief and capture of Simon De Montfort, Junior In April 1264 the encounter took place, as part of the Baron's War wherein Henry III of England besieged Simon de Montfort's supporters who were holed in at Northampton Castle. De Montfort (also recorded as de Montford, de Mountford etc.) mounted a rear-guard rescue attempt but on 6 April 1264 the castle fell and De Montfort's son (another Simon) was captured by the King's forces. Possible side-effect Participation of academics in the University of Northampton against the monarchy may have contributed to the abolition of the 1261‚Äì1265, short-lived, university. This was the third university in England, as followed Oxford and Cambridge, and the twenty-second in Europe. After being advised by bishops and magnates that Northampton was a threat to Oxford University, Henry III dissolved it in 1265 and signed a Royal Decree that banned the establishment of a university in Northampton. The decree was superseded by an Act authorising the University of Northampton to be established in the 21st century.

Harris (Harris I) was a lawsuit pertaining to the 2000 Presidential Election. Lawsuit There were two main issues: * Whether the county canvassing boards' authority to conduct manual recounts to correct \\"errors in the vote tabulation\\" extended to efforts to remedy situations where machines, though perhaps correctly functioning to detect properly marked ballots, did not count votes on certain ballots on which votes might be found under a manual inspection with an \\"intent of the voter\\" standard (Harris had ruled that it did not); and * How such recounts in the case at hand could be made to fit into the statutory scheme, which, as Harris interpreted it, contemplated a quick certification followed, if necessary, by an election contest during which a court (rather than the canvassing boards) would be empowered to correct errors. Regarding the first issue, the court ruled that, while Harris was generally entitled to deference in her interpretation of state laws, in this case the interpretation \\"contravene[d] the plain meaning\\" of the phrase \\"error in the vote tabulation\\" and so must be overturned. Regarding the second issue, the court ruled that the statutory scheme must be interpreted in light of the Florida state constitution's declaration that \\"all political power is inherent in the people,\\" with any ambiguities therefore construed \\"liberally.\\" Preventing the canvassing boards from continuing to conduct recounts beyond the seven-day timeframe (specified in the law, but with ambiguity as to how firm it was intended to be), would \\"summarily disenfranchise innocent electors [voters]\\" and could not be allowed unless the recounts continued for so long as to \\"compromise the integrity of the electoral process.\\" The court ordered counties to submit returns by November 26, until which time the stay of certification would stand.

Sandra Pointer-Jones wrote, \\"Beverly Watkins is a pyrotechnic guitar maven whose searing, ballistic attacks on the guitar have become allegorical tales within the blues community.\\" George Varga, reviewing her debut CD, observed that Watkins ‚Äúsings and plays with enough poise and verve to make musicians half her age or younger consider alternative means of employment.‚Äù Biography Watkins was born in Atlanta, Georgia in 1939. When she was about 12 years old, her family moved to Commerce, Georgia. She began playing music in school, and, in high school, she played bass for a band called Billy West Stone and the Down Beats. Around the year 1959, she was introduced to Piano Red, who had a daily radio show on WAOK, and she subsequently joined Piano Red and the Meter-tones, who played in a number of towns in the Atlanta area, and then Atlanta clubs such as the Magnolia Ballroom and the Casino, before starting to tour throughout the southeast, primarily at colleges. About the time the group renamed itself Piano Red and the Houserockers, they started touring nationally. The group had two successful singles: \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" and \\"Right String but the Wrong Yo-Yo\\". After recording \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" the group was known variously as Piano Red & The Interns, Dr. Feelgood & The Interns, and Dr. Feelgood, The Interns, and The Nurse. The group also included Roy Lee Johnson (composer of \\"Mr. Moonlight\\", later recorded by The Beatles), and Albert White. After the breakup of the band in about 1965, Watkins played with Eddie Tigner and the Ink Spots, Joseph Smith and the Fendales, and then with Leroy Redding and the Houserockers until the late 1980s. Subsequently she has been based in Atlanta, a well-known fixture at the Underground Atlanta. Watkins had a long and continuous musical career, and worked with artists including James Brown, B.B. King, and Ray Charles. However, like many roots musicians, she found it difficult to crack the airwaves, and achieved recognition much later in her career, after the advent of the internet made it possible for musicians not backed by major labels to be heard by a wider audience. She was re-discovered by Music Maker Relief Foundation founder Tim Duffy, who started booking her in package shows, and in 1998, with Koko Taylor and Rory Block, was part of the all-star Women of the Blues \\"Hot Mamas\\" tour. Her 1999 CD debut, Back in Business, earned a W. C. Handy Award nomination in 2000. Watkins was playing internationally (for example, the Main Stage at the Ottawa Blues Fest in 2004) as well as in her hometown Atlanta until temporarily sidelined by surgery in 2005, but recovered. She performed a set at the 2008 Cognac Blues Festival. Watkins died after a heart attack on October 1, 2019 at the age of 80.

Most of the village is now part of a living museum run by Manx National Heritage. There are also a number of private homes in the village, but their external appearance is controlled to maintain an older look. The village was also home to prominent Manx language speakers, Edward Faragher and Ned Maddrell.  Living museum  Much of the village forms a \\"Living Museum\\" dedicated to the preservation of the traditional Manx ways of life. Officially opened in 1938, the Cregneash Folk Village shows the typical way of life of a small Manx village in the 19th century. Many original Manx cottages have been preserved and exhibit Victorian farming and fishing equipment. Historically most of the cottages were thatched, and this is reflected on many of the cottages. A central museum holds a wealth of historical information, whilst many of the cottages in the village allow visitors to see rural activities performed by museum workers in traditional dress. Harry Kelly's cottage in the centre of the village typifies a Manx villager's home, where weaving or knitting often took place in the living area. In the workshop a blacksmith demonstrates some of the tools and techniques used to make horseshoes and other metal equipment of the time. Edward Faragher's (known in Manx as Ned Beg Hom Ruy or simply Ned Beg) cottage holds an exhibition about the Manx language, as Cregneash was an important location in the survival of the language around the start of the 20th century. Annual Manx festivals are held in Cregneash and it is home to a flock of the rare four-horned Loaghtan sheep. Due to the village's relative isolation from other urban areas on the Island, it is one of the 26 Dark Sky Discovery Sites on the Isle of Man. St. Peter's Church in the centre of the village was built in 1878 and still holds regular worship services on Sundays.  Manx language  Manx as a community language disappeared on most of the Isle of Man in the late 19th century. However it \\"lingered longer in the more remote areas, such as Cregneash\\" Many of the last remaining native speakers of Manx that were recorded in the mid-20th century were raised in Cregneash and the surrounding areas. Manx language poet and author Edward Faragher was born and raised in the village, and wrote extensively about his experiences there, particularly focusing on the practices and attitudes of the older generations of the 19th century: > I think it a great shame to Manx folk that cannot speak their native > language. No doubt the old people of Cregneish were not like some others of > their neighbours in the little sea-port towns, with the , knee breeches and > , but they were more innocent and kinder to one another; they all used to > help one another to get the crops down, and in the harvest helped each other > to cut the corn and stack it. There was no word about pay.'I have written a > little scitch of my life': Edward Faragher's 'A Sketch of Cregneish', Manx > Notes 33 (2004), edited by Stephen Miller Ned Maddrell, sometimes called the last native speaker of Manx, was brought up in the village. In the summer of 1947 Irish Taoiseach √âamon de Valera visited him at Harry Kelly's cottage in Cregneash as part of his trip to the Isle of Man. As a fluent speaker of Irish, he had a conversation with Ned Maddrell the youngest of the last remaining native speakers, with Maddrell speaking Manx and de Valera in Irish. Maddrell explained his views on the Manx language to de Valera: \\"I am a Manx nationalist‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt mean that we should cut adrift from the Empire, but I think we should preserve what is our own‚Ä¶‚Äù Recordings were later made by the Irish Folklore Commission of Maddrell speaking in Manx at his home in Glenchass near Port St Mary.  In the media  The historic village backdrop has been used in film and television shows. Waking Ned Devine was filmed on the Isle of Man and village scenes were shot in Cregneash, which stood in for the fictional Irish village of (Tullymore). The Manx short film Solace in Wicca was shot in various Manx National Heritage locations including Cregneash. The short film was the first production to be shot entirely in Manx Gaelic. Other films and television shows that were shot in Cregneash include Rocket's Island, Stormbreaker, Treasure Island, Keeping Mum, and Mindhorn.

Because of his work, Zhisheng has been disbarred and detained by the Chinese government several times, and severely tortured. He last disappeared in February 2009 and was unofficially detained until December 2011, when it was announced that he has now been imprisoned for three years. His commitment to defending his clients is influenced by his Christian beliefs and their tenets on morality and compassion.Finney, Richard and Ding Xiao (4 September 2007) \\"China's Urban Christians an Unknown Quantity For Beijing\\", Radio Free Asia. Retrieved 7 October 2007 Gao Zhisheng's wife Geng He speaking publicly to help her husband in 2011 Gao's memoir, A China More Just (2007), documents his \\"fight as a rights lawyer in the world's largest communist state.\\" In subsequent writing, he accuses the ruling Communist Party of China of state-sponsored torture and reports having been tortured by the Chinese secret police. He disappeared in February 2009. At the beginning of 2012, Gao's brother said he had received a court document saying his brother was in Shayar jail in Xinjiang. In 2014, it was reported that Zhisheng was released from jail and put under house arrest. He disappeared again in August 2017 in an apparent attempt to escape house arrest and was subsequently taken back into custody on his recapture in September.  Background  Gao was born and grew up in a house in Shaanxi Province with six siblings; his father died at the age of 40. He briefly worked in a coal mine. With his family not being able to afford elementary school, Gao said he sat listening outside the classroom window. Later, an uncle helped him attend secondary school, after which he qualified to join the People's Liberation Army. His unit was stationed at a base in Kashgar, in Xinjiang region, and he became a member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Later, he left the PLA and began working as a food vendor. In 1991, inspired by a newspaper article that mentioned a plan by Deng Xiaoping, then China's paramount leader, to train 150,000 new lawyers and develop the Chinese legal system, he took a course in law. Gao credited his excellent memory of titles and clauses for passing all his exams; he passed the bar in 1995. = Early career = In 1989, the legislature passed the Administrative Procedure Law, which gave Chinese citizens the right to sue state agencies for the first time. In the 1990s, Gao represented the family of a Xinjiang boy who became comatose after a doctor erroneously gave him ethanol intravenously; Gao won $100,000 in damages for a boy who had lost his hearing in another malpractice case. He acted on behalf of a private businessman who had taken control of and redressed a troubled state-owned company when the district government used force to reclaim it after it became profitable. The case went to the Supreme Court, with a verdict in favour of the businessman; however, according to Gao, he has been a victim of reprisals from Xinjiang leaders, who warned clients and court officials to shun him. = Zhi Sheng Law Firm = Gao was director, founder of the Beijing-based Zhi Sheng Law Firm, having moved to Beijing in 2000. In 2001, he was recognized by China‚Äôs Ministry of Justice as \\"one of the country‚Äôs 10 best lawyers\\" for his work in defending victims of medical malpractice and fighting for just compensation for dispossessed landowners. Over the following years, he defended a wide range of clients who had been victims of injustice. Gao‚Äôs committed involvement with such cases, he says, is strongly bound with the emphasis of his Christian identity on morality and compassion. One significant case he spearheaded was for fair compensation for a client whose home was expropriated for a building project connected with the 2008 Summer Olympics. However, Gao cites an internal document drafted by the central government he had read that instructed all district courts to reject cases involving such land disputes, which he said was \\"blatantly illegal\\", but which \\"every court in Beijing blindly obeyed.\\" Other cases include: * a land dispute case against Taishi village officials * a class-action lawsuit against local authorities over coercion in implementation of China‚Äôs family planning policies * winning a case for six factory workers from Guangdong province who had been detained for protesting exploitation by their employer.\\"The Stella Shoe Workers‚Äô Protest\\" .

Following the Beijing land compensation case, he entered what was to become a protracted battle over several hundred acres of farmland that Guangdong Province had seized to construct a university. Although Gao met with many legal impediments, he took his campaign to the people. He publicly accused Guangdong officials of \\"brazen murderous schemes\\", which stoked public anger and helped his clients obtain more generous compensation. In the summer of 2005, Gao defended fellow lawyer- activist Zhu Jiuhu, who was accused of \\"disturbing public order\\" while representing private investors in oil wells that were seized by the government in Shaanxi. He secured Zhu's release several months later through an intensive publicity campaign, although Zhu was barred from practicing law. The Beijing Judicial Bureau has prohibited him from acting in certain cases and clients, including Falun Gong, the Shaanxi oil case and an incident of political unrest in Taishi village in Guangdong. He refused to drop any of them, arguing that the bureau had no legal authority to dictate what cases he accepts or rejects. In 2005, he resigned from the Communist Party. Shortly after sending an open letter to the PRC leadership that accused the government of running extrajudicial \\"brainwashing base(s)\\" for dealing with Falun Gong practitioners, he received a visit from State Security agents. Gao's family was put under 24-hour police surveillance in the autumn of 2005. On 4 November, shortly after being warned to retract a second open letter he had written about his Falun Gong cases, Gao received a new summons from the judicial bureau accusing him of a \\"serious violation of the Law on Managing the Registration of Law Firms\\" for failing to promptly register a new business address following a move. He was ordered to suspend operations for a year. On appeal in late November, the bureau demanded that Gao hand over his personal law license as well as his firm's operating permit by 14 December, threatening use of force if he failed to comply; at that time, Gao had eluded being tailed by Security, and went to north-east China to take statements from Falun Gong practitioners who alleged torture at the hands of security forces. = Detentions = Amnesty International alleged on 17 January 2006 that Gao narrowly escaped an assassination attempt, planned as a traffic accident ordered by Chinese secret police. On 4 February 2006, Gao, together with Hu Jia and other activists, launched a \\"Relay Hunger Strike for Human Rights,\\" whereby different activists and citizens fasted for 24 hours in rotation. The hunger strike was joined by people in 29 provinces, as well as overseas, though several participants were arrested for joining. On 15 August 2006, after numerous death threats and continued harassment, Gao disappeared while visiting his sister's family. On 21 September 2006, he was officially arrested. On 22 December 2006, Gao was convicted of \\"subversion\\", and was sentenced to three years in prison, suspended, and placed on probation for five years. The sentence also deprived him of his political rights ‚Äì the freedom to publish or speak out against the government ‚Äì for one year. He had publicly confessed to a number of errors.

One month prior to his disappearance, Gao's wife and two children escaped China with the help of underground religious adherents. They arrived in the United States and were granted right of asylum ten days later. During his disappearance, in response to queries from his family about his whereabouts, police claimed he lost his way and went missing in September 2009.Fears grow over Chinese lawyer's disappearance, Toronto Star, 13 April 2009 For several months, Gao was not charged, and the Government never acknowledged his whereabouts, nor their involvement in his disappearance.

On 21 January 2010, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a cryptic statement that Gao was \\"where he should be,\\" and said he did not know Gao's whereabouts at a later press conference. During the visit to China by David Miliband in March, the Chinese foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, said that Gao had been sentenced on subversion charges, but denied he had been tortured. On 28 March 2010 Gao was found to be living near Wutai Mountain. Addressing a reporter by telephone, he said he was not in a position to be interviewed, but confirmed he had been sentenced and freed. A few days later, he met the media, appearing thinner and more subdued than in the past and said that he had abandoned his criticism of the government in the hope of reuniting with his wife and two children.

Halsall village is centred around St Cuthbert's Church and the war memorial. The church dates from the 14th century and the Rector is the Rev. Paul Robinson. The hall is to the south-west of the church; between them was a water-mill, taken down about 1880. Near the site of the water mill now stands the former Halsall Arms public house (now offices for business). There is a junior school, St Cuthbert's Church of England Primary School with around 140 pupils from age 4 to 11. The Saracen's Head is a large public house on the banks of the canal. There is also a garage, offices (in what used to be the Halsall Arms public house) and a red telephone box situated by the former post office. The church and much of the village stand on a rocky ridge, in marked contrast to the low-lying flat peat mossland between the ridge and the sand of Ainsdale and Birkdale. There are several listed buildings in Halsall including the Grade I listed church including Halsall Hall and a number of listed canal bridges amongst other structures. Halsall Hall still stands, but it has been subdivided into a number of dwellings. In 2011, the parish had a population of 2,057 and covered an area of . A natural curiosity of the district was the bituminous turf which was found in the Halsall moss. This was known as Lit- turf and could be burnt like a candle.  The Leeds to Liverpool Canal  Halsall is where the first sod was ceremonially dug (on 5 November 1770, by the Hon. Charles Mordaunt of Halsall Hall) for the commencement of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. A sculpture (\\"Halsall Navvy\\" by Thompson Dagnall) just across the bridge from the Saracen's Head pub now commemorates this. The canal in this area was partially fortified with pillboxes and anti tank measures as it formed part of Stop Line 14 in WW2.  Transport  The village has five bus stops, served by the 300 bus route, operated by Arriva North West, travelling from Liverpool to Southport (and the reverse). Halsall railway station on the Liverpool, Southport and Preston Junction Railway was in service between 1887 and 1938.  Culture  Halsall plays host to the annual scarecrow festival. The festival runs from June to July. The official route for the scarecrow festival was down the main road through the village but the scarecrows have spread to the surrounding areas. The scarecrow festival is not a competition.

Glenmalure is an important base for climbing in the Wicklow mountains, and particularly accessing the massif of Lugnaquilla, and contains one of the earliest An Oige youth hostels in Ireland. Glenmalure was also an important historical area and the site of the Battle of Glenmalure in 1580, as well as various events in the Irish Rebellion of 1798. Geography Glenmalure is a 20-kilometre long glacial valley in the southern sector of the Wicklow Mountains and is one of the longest glacial valleys in Ireland. A number of adjoining hanging valleys, most notably the Fraughan Rock Glen, feed into Glenmalure valley, that were formed by feeder glaciers in the last Ice Age. The valley runs from the north-west down to the south-east. Its western flank is dominated by the large massif of Lugnaquilla , the County Top for Wicklow, and the Provincial Top for Leinster. The steep walls of its eastern flank are the western slopes of Lugduff , and Mullacor , who also bound the neighbouring Glendalough valley. The head of the Glenmalure valley is bounded by a \\"boggy\\" horseshoe formed by Camenabologue , Table Mountain , and Conavalla . A number of ancient trails called Table Tracks run between Glenmalure valley, via the cols between Table Mountain and Conavalla mountain, to the Art O'Neill's cross area, thus crossing the \\"central spine\\" of the entrie Wicklow mountains range. Geology Glenmalure valley covers an area underlain by the late-Caledonian (405 Ma) Leinster Granite bedrock and wallrocks. This granite is part of the \\"Lugnaquillia Pluton\\", one of the five plutons that comprise the Leinster Granite, and various granite varieties occur along the valley. The wallrocks consist of various metasedimentary lithologies of the Ordovician Maulin Formation. The granite is cut by slightly younger quartz veins containing lead and zinc mineralization. The valley itself and the glacial features within it date from the last Ice Age. The base of the valley has a number of cross-valley moraines, as well as lateral moraines along the southwestern side of the valley. Recreation Glenmalure is a base for hill walking and mountain climbing activities in the area. The An Oige Glenmalure Youth Hostel, situated at the intersection with the Fraughan Rock Glen, is open during the summer months (no running water or electricity), and dates from 1903 when it was a hunting lodge; several notable figures have stayed in the premises, including Countess Markievicz, Maud Gonne, her son Sean McBride, Eamon De Valera, and W. B. Yeats. The 15‚Äìkilometre 5‚Äì6 hour Glenmalure Loop is described as \\"the most scenic circuit to Lugnaquilla\\". It starts in the Baravore car-park () at the head of the valley and summits Lugnaquilla via the cliff‚Äìfringed hanging valley, Fraughan Rock Glen (the Glen is entered via the path at the Glenmalure hostel); but returning via Cloghernagh , and down to the scenic Arts Lough , described as \\"one of the region's most beautiful sights\\", before descending back to the start of the Fraughan Rock Glen. History Glenmalure contained the stronghold of the Gabhail Raghnal branch of the O'Byrne clan at Balinacor. It was the site of the Battle of Glenmalure in 1580, when an English force unsuccessfully tried to take Balinacor,The Battle of Glenmalure, 25 August 1580: Cause and Course by Emmett O'Byrne.

It was the worst defeat suffered by an English army in Ireland; they were completely routed with losses of between 500 and 1,000 officers and men, including Sir Peter Carew the younger. A boulder near the Military Road crossroads is carved with an inscription commemorating Fiach MacHugh on one side and Michael Dwyer on the other side. South of this junction on the road to Rathdangan and Aughrim lies the ruin of Glenmalure Barracks, built by the British army in an attempt to capture rebels after the 1798 rebellion.

Established in 1987, the Alston/Bannerman Fellowship Program was founded on the belief that the most effective approach to achieving progressive social change is by organizing low-income people at the grassroots level. Many elements contribute to a community organization's success, but none are more important than the vision, commitment, talent and hard work of its organizers and leaders. Yet few resources are available to support them and, as a result, too many experienced organizers \\"burn-out\\" and too few younger ones see organizing as a viable long-term profession. The Program's founders decided that a practical contribution to strengthening community organizing would be to give organizers an opportunity to step back from their work for a period of reflection and renewal.

In 1843, he was appointed as Acting Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong and a member of the Executive and Legislative Councils, but died eight days later in Hong Kong from fever.  Early life  Morrison was born on 17 April 1814 in the Portuguese colony of Macau. He was the second son and third child of missionary Robert Morrison's marriage to Mary Morton. Morrison left Macau on 21 January 1815 with his mother and elder sister aboard a ship bound for England. They returned to Macau on 23 August 1820, but less than two years later his mother died and he was sent back to England to receive an education. Over the next four years, he was educated in Manchester and at Mill Hill Grammar School in London. When his father left for China on 1 May 1826, he took John Robert with him. He learned the Chinese language from his father, and attended the Anglo-Chinese College in Malacca between 1827 and 1830.  Career in China  From 1830, Morrison acted as translator for English merchants in Canton (Guangzhou), China. From 1832 to 1834, he accompanied American merchant and diplomat Edmund Roberts to Siam and Cochin China as his personal secretary and translator. Morrison also compiled a Chinese Commercial Guide to provide information on British trade in China and contributed to Karl G√ºtzlaff's Eastern Western Monthly Magazine, a publication aimed at improving Sino-western understanding. Morrison succeeded his father in 1834 and was appointed Chinese Secretary to the British East India Company on behalf of the British government. He was then involved in diplomacy during the Opium War from 1839 to 1842, which resulted in the Treaty of Nanking, which he translated. Along with interpreter Robert Thom, he assisted the British expedition up the Broadway River from Macau to Canton in 1841.Bernard, William Dallas; Hall, William Hutcheon (1847). The Nemesis in China (3rd ed.). London: Henry Colburn. p. 139.

Translation work  Apart from official duties, John Morrison continued his father's work of the English Protestant Church in Canton and supported those Chinese converts persecuted by the Chinese authorities. He revised his father's translation of the Bible and appealed to the London Missionary Society to continue its missionary work in Canton. In February 1838, he was made Recording Secretary of the Medical Missionary Society. In 1840, Walter Henry Medhurst, Karl G√ºtzlaff, Elijah Coleman Bridgman, and Morrison cooperated to translate the Bible into Chinese. The translation of the Hebrew part was done mostly by G√ºtzlaff from the Netherlands Missionary Society, with the exception that the Pentateuch and the book of Joshua were done by the group collectively. This translation, produced in a version of classical Chinese known as High Wen-li (), was completed in 1847 after John Robert's death and is well known due to its adoption by the revolutionary peasant leader Hong Xiuquan of the Taiping Rebellion as the basis for some of the reputed early doctrines of the organisation.  Death  Old Protestant Cemetery in Macau, next to his parents Morrison died on 29 August 1843 following a nine-day episode of \\"Hong Kong fever\\" (possibly malarial fever). This was the same outbreak in Hong Kong that took the life of fellow missionary Samuel Dyer.

Situated mostly within the boundaries of the City of Paris, it connects Porte de Clignancourt in the north and Mairie de Montrouge in the south, travelling across the heart of the city. Prior to 2013, when the southern terminus was changed from Porte d'Orl√©ans to Mairie de Montrouge, the line was sometimes referred to as the Clignancourt ‚Äì Orl√©ans Line. At in length, it connects to all of the lines of the M√©tro apart from the 3bis and 7bis branch lines, as well as all of the RER express lines. Further, it is the second-busiest M√©tro line after Line 1, carrying over 154 million passengers in 2004. Line 4 was the first line to connect the Right and Left Banks of Paris via an underwater tunnel, built between 1905 and 1907. Line 4 long ran the oldest cars in service on the system, the MP 59, which used rubber tyres to dissipate the braking power through resistance. Those trains were withdrawn from service during the course of 2011 and 2012 after 45 years (with some being in service for 50 years). They were replaced by the MP 89 CC stock from Line 1 when the latter line was automatised. (From :fr:Ligne 4 du m√©tro de Paris). In the first decade of the 21st century, Line 4 was extended for the first time since its initial construction, into the southern suburbs of Montrouge. It now serves the new southern terminus of Mairie de Montrouge. Construction of the extension began in 2008 and it opened to passengers on 23 March 2013 . The line is now being retrofitted for full automation, with completion expected in the early 2020s.

Line 4, opened in 1908, was the last line of the original concession of the Compagnie du chemin de fer m√©tropolitain de Paris and the first to cross the Seine underground (Line 5‚Äînow Line 6 at this point‚Äîcrossed the river on the Passy bridge, later renamed the Pont de Bir-Hakeim in 1906). The route was the subject of lengthy discussions that delayed the start of construction of the tunnel. It was originally planned as a straight line under the Rue du Louvre, under the Seine in line with the street, under the Institut de France, along the Rue de Rennes and then the Boulevard Raspail to the Porte d'Orleans. But as a result of the delay in beginning the extension of the Rue de Rennes as part of Haussmann's plan to the Seine‚Äîwhich was never carried out‚Äîand the outcry from the academics who refused categorically to agree to the line passing under the Institut de France, the route was eventually changed to cross further east through the Place du Ch√¢telet and the √éle de la Cit√©.Robert (1983), p. 71 The new route also has more coherence as a north‚Äìsouth route following the main traffic flows. A second modification of the route was also made: it was decided to make a temporary deviation via the major station of Gare Montparnasse to avoid a further delay in opening the line, which was eagerly awaited. This was made necessary by the delay in building the new Boulevard Raspail between Rue de Rennes and Boulevard du Montparnasse.Tricoire (1999), p. 187 Once the Boulevard Raspail was completed, it was planned to take the shorter route and bypass the Gare Montparnasse. To the south of the Vavin station the tunnel provides for the final route along the Boulevard Raspail. But the value in serving three major mainline stations by the line later led to the abandonment of this proposal.Robert (1983), p. 74 =A spectacular construction site= In 1905 construction was started by the company of L√©on Chagnaud‚Äîa former mason from Creuse (a department with a tradition of supplying building workers in France)‚Äîand line 4 became the first to cross the Seine underground. The method used for crossing under the river is that of metal caissons, twenty to forty meters in length mounted on the banks and sunken vertically in the river bed. The ends of the caissons were blocked and they were towed to their location before being ballasted with water and sunk in the riverbed. A chamber filled with pressurised air was built at the lower level of these caissons so that workers could excavate under the caissons. Each caisson gradually sank to its final position as the ground below it was removed. The northern stream of the Seine required three caissons, the southern stream two caissons. The crossing of the Seine also involved the freezing of saturated ground between the station of Saint-Michel and the Seine, under the line of the Chemin de Fer de Paris √† Orl√©ans (now RER line C) in 1908 and 1909. The installation of two refrigeration plants allowed the movement of brine cooled to ‚àí25 ¬∞C in dozens of tubes to stabilize the ground. The northern section was the first completed: it was opened on 21 April 1908 from Porte de Clignancourt to Ch√¢telet. The southern section was opened 30 in October 1909 from Porte d'Orleans to Raspail. The two sections were connected on 9 January 1910. However, the line was closed to traffic a few days later in January 1910, when the level of the Seine broke its banks during the worst flood of the century. On the morning of 24 January 1910, a significant inflow of water at the Seine crossing interrupted services between Ch√¢telet and Vavin, although services were restored later in the day. But the inflow increased and services were again halted in the afternoon. On 26 January Ch√¢telet station and the crossing under the river was completely flooded and slowly rose in the tunnel. On the night of 27 and 28 January, flooding reached R√©aumur ‚Äì S√©bastopol and eventually Gare de l'Est: The line at its minimum was reduced to operating between Clignancourt and Gare du Nord and between Vavin and Porte d'Orleans. The fall in the level of flooding during February allowed a gradual resumption of operations, but full service was not restored to 6 April after repair of extensive damage caused to the infrastructure.Robert (1983), pp. 74‚Äì78 During the politically turbulent 1930s, Line 4 had its own drama: on 27 July 1934, a package left in a carriage was carried into the office of its chief supervisor, located on the platform of Montparnasse. The package exploded, killing the chief supervisor and another officer and wounding four passengers. The assassins were never found.Robert (1983), p. 372 During World War II the most violent bombing Paris suffered was on the night of 20 and 21 April 1944 when the rail freight yard of la Chapelle and the main truck workshop at Rue Championnet were hit. The roof of the Simplon station was hit by a bomb and it collapsed on the tracks and platforms. After repairs the line was brought back into service a few days later.Robert (1983), p. 140 File:Malcuit - M√©tropolitain de Paris - Souterrain construit sur caisson √† air comprim√©.JPGPostcard explaining the construction of the crossing under the Seine by the use of pressurised sunken caissons Image:Paris - Les travaux du Metropolitain - Foncage d un caisson.jpgSinking of a caisson in the narrow (southern) stream of the Seine in 1906 Image:Paris - Les travaux du Metropolitain - Foncage du caisson central.jpgSinking of the central caisson in the northern stream of the Seine Image:Paris - Les travaux du Metropolitain place Saint-Michel.jpgSinking of the Saint-Michel station Image:Paris - Travaux du Metropolitain - Les fermes de la place Saint-Michel.jpgWork sites in the Place Saint-Michel and Boulevard Saint-Andre before the sinking =The rubber tyre metro and the deviation of the line= MP 59 rubber-tyred trains. The RATP was satisfied by experimentation with rubber tyres on Line 11 beginning in 1956. It therefore decided to equip lines 1 and 4 for rubber-tyre operations, which can increase line capacity by providing better acceleration and decelerations as a result of a much superior grip. In the early 1960s these two lines were the two busiest on the network, with loads of 140% of capacity during the evening peak. However, as this change alone was insufficient to overcome this saturation, the length of stations was lengthened from 75 to 90 metres, allowing the lengthening of train from five to six carriages. This work was carried out very quickly and, as early as October 1965, trains of six carriages traversed the line. On 3 October 1966, the first train composed of MP 59 electric multiple units operated on the line. The Line 4 trains were identical to those on Line 1, being composed of four motor and two trailers per train. The line's MP 59 fleet included 556 carriages, comprising 376 powered carriages and 180 trailers. On 17 July 1967, the last steel-wheeled train left the line to strengthen the service of other with a hundred cars built before 1914 scrapped.Robert (1983), pp. 157‚Äì158 In February 1971, line 4 was the second network after line 11 to be equipped with semi-automatic operation, with a system known as Grecque (\\"Greek\\"). This allowed trains once started by the driver to run automatically and stop at the next station.Sirand-Pugnet (1997), p. 43 Since its opening the only change of the route of the line took place in early October 1977 with the deviation of the line with the relocation of the station at Les Halles. During the excavation of the enormous Les Halles complex the station of Les Halles was relocated about ten metres further east to allow a shorter connection to Ch√¢telet ‚Äì Les Halles RER station. For this, three hundred and thirty meters of tunnel were built to join the old route. The changeover took place on three consecutive nights from 10 pm on Friday, 30 September 1977 to the beginning of services on Monday, 3 October. On the first night, the new track 2 was connected, on the second night, the new track 1 was built and on the last night it was connected.Sirand-Pugnet (1997), pp. 119‚Äì22 On 6 August 2005 at 4:42 pm, a fire on a train at Simplon due to the malfunction of a circuit breaker caused the evacuation of two MP 59 trains with 19 people mildly affected. The fire was extinguished by fire fighters at around 6:00 pm. =Extension to Montrouge and the MP 89= Transition of rolling stock from the MP 59 to the MP 89 took place during 2011 and 2012. Until 2013, Line 4 was one of a few lines (the others being semi-circular lines 2 and 6, as well as Line 14) that had never been extended beyond the \\"gates\\" of Paris. During the 1920s, a preliminary extension towards la Vache-Noire was planned but never carried out. Since that time, no other extension plan was brought up. In 2008, nearly a century after its opening, construction of a one-station extension towards Mairie de Montrouge began. The new station officially opened to passengers on 23 March 2013, allowing one to travel from Montrouge to Clignancourt in 30 minutes.http://www.ratp.fr/fr/ratp/c_5097/actualites/ La ligne 4 arrive √† Montrouge - RATP - Retrieved 3/23/2013 (In French) Mairie de Montrouge is a traditional two-tracked station. In addition to the Montrouge extension, there has recently been a much-needed refresh in rolling stock for Line 4, as the MP 59 trainsets were reaching the end of their useful lives. The automation of Line 1 and purchasing of new automated rolling stock (the MP 05) allowed the RATP to replace the MP 59 with the MP 89CC rolling stock from Line 1. Testing of the MP 89 during overnight hours took place in 2010, with the first train (#01) to be transferred to Line 4 in April, 2011 and enter service on 23 May 2011. A second train (#44) entered service on 10 September 2011. The first MP 59 train that was retired was #6049, which was pulled from service in April, 2011. As the MP 05 rolling stock began to debut on Line 1, the pace of transferring the MP 89CC stock from Line 1 to Line 4 increased to roughly 3 trains per month. Since January, 2012, the RATP kept this rate of transfer (increasing the rate to 4 trains during November and December) despite only being able to remove 2 MP 59 trainsets from service each month. During the course of 2011, the following trains were transferred from Line 1 to Line 4: #s 14, 20, 29, 30, 31, 34, 38, and 40. Train #s 03 through 25, 27 through 42, 43, 44, 48, 49, 51, and 52 were transferred during the course of 2012. #45 was transferred on 3 January 2013, marking the 47th train to be moved to Line 4. Between February and March 2013, #s 02, 46, 47, and 50 were transferred. The final MP 89CC train was be #26. The last MP 59 train to be pulled from service was #6021, which was withdrawn on 21 December 2012. Though many MP 59 trains operated on Line 4 for roughly 45 years, those trains that were brought over from Line 1 during the late 1990s have circulated throughout the Metro for about 50 years. Future =Southern Extension towards Bagneux= Mairie de Montrouge After the opening of Mairie de Montrouge, Line 4 will be extended further south by two stations: Barbara at the frontier between Montrouge and Bagneux (in Montrouge) and Bagneux - Lucie Aubrac. In October, 2011, the STIF announced that construction of the Bagneux extension will begin in 2014, with opening expected in 2019 .

Bagneux - Lucie Aubrac will also allow connection to the Red Line (now known as Line 15) of the Grand Paris Express network. =Northern Extension towards Saint-Ouen= An extension to the north to the \\"docks\\" of Saint-Ouen (an urban redevelopment project next to the Seine) via Mairie de Saint-Ouen (where Line 4 would connect to Line 13's St. Denis branch and the future northern extension of Line 14) was planned for phase 1 (2007‚Äì2013) of the Sch√©ma directeur de la r√©gion √éle-de-France (\\"Master Plan for the √éle-de- France region\\", SDRIF), which was adopted by resolution of the Regional Council of Ile-de-France on 25 September 2008. However no detailed studies have been carried out nor finance set aside for it. =Automation= The line is being converted to an automated system (like Line 1), with completion initially expected by 2019.http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single- view/view/ratp-cleared-to-automate-paris-metro-line-4.html The initial plans were to begin conversion some time after the completion of the Line 1 conversion, but due to high costs those plans were put on hold (From :fr:Ligne 4 du m√©tro de Paris). On 2 April 2013, the RATP confirmed that Line 4 would be fully automated, but stopped short of giving a timeline of the conversion.http://www.lefigaro.fr/societes/2013/04/02/20005-20130402ARTFIG00282-la- ratp-prepare-l-automatisation-de-la-ligne-4-du-metro-parisien.php La RATP pr√©pare l'automatisation de la ligne 4 du m√©tro parisien {In French} - Retrieved 3 April 2013 In January 2016, Siemens was awarded a ‚Ç¨70 million contract to fully automate Line 4. A mix of passenger and driverless trains will start in 2020 and the line will be fully driverless by 2022. Although rolling stock for the automated line has not yet been confirmed, it is highly speculated that Line 4 will initially see a mix of MP 89CA and MP 05 stock from Line 14 running alongside new MP 14 railcars. Rolling Stock Over the years, Line 4 has seen the following rolling stock. * M1: 1908-1930 * Sprague- Thomson: 1930 - 1967 * MP 59: 1967 - December, 2012 * MP 89CC: May, 2011 ‚Äì Present (From :fr:Ligne 4 du m√©tro de Paris) Workshops Until March, 2013; light maintenance of the MP 89CC rolling stock of Line 4 was handled within the station of Porte d'Orl√©ans (CDT). Platform 2 of the station (in the direction of Porte de Clignancourt contains inspection pits, which allow routine light maintenance work and troubleshooting of the first level. Both Porte d'Orl√©ans and Porte de Clignancourt also contain loop tracks where trains can be stored overnight (although many trains are stored within the main tunnels due to a lack of a sufficient garage). This protocol changed when a new garage located south of the new station Mairie de Montrouge opened. Track 3 of station Porte d'Orl√©ans will eventually be dismantled and covered over to make way for a new access point into the station. Second level maintenance is handled at the Saint-Ouen shops, located just to the north of the Porte de Clignancourt terminus (and its northern loops). The facility extends over an area of 34,000 sq meters and opened in 1908. The shops have been renovated and expanded over the years, including a recent extension to house MP 89CC trainsets that are undergoing routine maintenance (AMT). In addition to maintaining the MP 89CC trainsets, the Saint-Quen shops also handles heavy maintenance and overhaul of the MF 77 steel-wheel stock trains for lines 7, 8 and 13, as well as numerous auxiliary/service trains. The shop is also specialized in the review of electronic equipment of all network hardware. As of 2007, 60 officers are assigned to train maintenance and 220 to the maintenance of equipment. All heavy maintenance work for the MP 89CC trainsets are handled in the workshops of Fontenay, located just east of the Chateau de Vincennes terminus of Line 1.

Biography He was born on October 24, 1879, in Brasher Falls, New York, the son of a music director. At a young age he played the piccolo and cornet in his father's band, touring the U.S. east coast and Europe. After high school, he worked as a musical clown in a traveling circus until joining the Majestic Theater Orchestra in Utica, New York. At the Utica Conservatory of Music he was head of the brass instrument department. Drawn back to show business in the early part of the 20th century, he worked in vaudeville, producing a revue and serving as bandleader. In 1914, Rolfe turned his talents to the fledgling motion picture business, establishing his own production company, Rolfe Photoplays Inc. Although he filmed in California, Rolfe's productions were primarily made in and around Fort Lee, New Jersey, and distributed through an agreement with Louis B. Mayer's Metro Pictures Corporation. Rolfe's company produced more than 50 silent films, several of which were collaborations with director/screenwriter Oscar A. C. Lund, including the 1916 drama Dorian's Divorce starring Lionel Barrymore. He acquired Dyreda Art Film Company in 1915. His film company's last production was the 15-part mystery serial, The Master Mystery (1919), starring Harry Houdini. Mounting financial difficulties resulted in Rolfe Photoplays Inc. going out of business and before 1920 he was making a living producing and directing films for Metro Pictures and other small independent production companies such as A. H. Fischer, Inc., for which he produced Even as Eve and directed Man and Woman, both released in 1920. Rolfe's last directorial effort was A. H. Fischer's Miss 139 (1921), notable in that he managed to get a credible performance from star Diana Allen, the less than talented but dazzlingly beautiful former Ziegfeld Follies girl. She also starred in Man and Woman. B.A. Rolfe's The Master Mystery (1919) After leaving the film business, B.A. Rolfe quickly reestablished himself as a performing soloist, music instructor and vaudeville producer. He worked with Vincent Lopez in 1924 and 1925.[ AMG, B.A. Rolfe Biography] Inspired by Paul Whiteman, by 1926 he had assembled his own New York City dance orchestra to perform at a Broadway cabaret called the Palais D'Or. Soon billed as \\"B.A. Rolfe (Trumpet Virtuoso) and his Palais D'Or Orchestra,\\" by 1928 he was performing on radio and recording as \\"B.A. Rolfe and his Lucky Strike Orchestra\\" for Edison Records. Rolfe was an exclusive Edison artist from 1926 through October, 1929, when Edison suspended its recording operation. Rolfe made electrical transcriptions in the early 1930s and made two Vitaphone shorts in 1934 and in 1935. In 1935‚Äì36, Rolfe was the leader of The Goodrich Silvertown Orchestra. His radio broadcasts ran until the late 1930s during which time he and his orchestra played music with the sponsorship of Believe It or Not! on NBC. Rolfe also narrated the shows, providing an on-air description of a Robert Ripley tale of wonder. With the onset of World War II, Rolfe organized an all-female orchestra to perform patriotic songs. At the age of 76, he died of cancer in Walpole, Massachusetts.

Led by Richard Cobden and John Bright, it won a wide hearing for its argument that free trade would lead to a more equitable society, making essential products available to all. Its most famous activity was the Anti-Corn Law League that called for repeal of the Corn Laws that kept food prices high. It expounded the social and economic implications of free trade and laissez-faire capitalism. The Manchester School took the theories of economic liberalism advocated by classical economists such as Adam Smith and made them the basis for government policy. It also promoted pacifism, anti-slavery, freedom of the press and separation of church and state.Wallace (1960)  Manchester background  Manchester was the hub of the world's textile manufacturing industry, and had a large population of factory workers who were disadvantaged by the Corn Laws, the protectionist policy that imposed tariffs on imported wheat and therefore increased the price of food. The Corn Laws were supported by the land-owning aristocracy because they reduced foreign competition and allowed landowners to keep grain prices high. That increased the profits from agriculture as the population expanded. However, the operation of the Corn Laws meant that factory workers in the textile mills of northern England were faced with increasing food prices. In turn, mill owners had to pay higher wages, which meant that the price of finished goods was higher and the foreign trade competitiveness of their products was reduced.  Anti-Corn Law League  Mercantilism holds that a country‚Äôs prosperity is dependent on large exports, but limited imports of goods. At the beginning of the 19th century, trade in Britain was still subject to import quotas, price ceilings and other state interventions. That led to shortages of certain goods in British markets, in particular corn (grains usually requiring grinding, most often, but not always wheat). Manchester became the headquarters of the Anti-Corn Law League from 1839. The League campaigned against the Corn Laws, which it said would reduce food prices and increase the competitiveness of manufactured goods abroad. Manchester Liberalism grew out of that movement. That has led to the situation seen in modern Britain, where the country has become dependent upon imported food as part of a globalised interdependence. Manchester Liberalism has a theoretical basis in the writings of Adam Smith, David Hume and Jean-Baptiste Say. The great champions of the Manchester School were Richard Cobden and John Bright. As well as being advocates of free trade, they were radical opponents of war and imperialism, and proponents of peaceful relations between peoples. The \\"Little Englander\\" movement saw little benefit in paying taxes to defend colonies such as Canada, which contributed little trade to Manchester manufacturers and could not supply their main raw material of cotton. Manchesterism can therefore be seen as a belief in free and consensual relations amongst individuals and groups at all levels. Cobden's efforts to promote free trade were always instrumental in what he deemed the highest moral purpose, i.e. the promotion of peace on earth and goodwill among men.  Terminology  In March 1848, Conservative Benjamin Disraeli first used the term \\"the School of Manchester\\".W. H. Greenleaf, The British Political Tradition. Volume Two: The Ideological Heritage (London: Methuen, 1983), p. 41. According to historian Ralph Raico and as indicated by the German liberal Julius Faucher in 1870, the term \\"Manchesterism\\" was invented by Ferdinand Lassalle (the founder of German socialism) and was meant as an abusive term.Raico, Ralph (2004) Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th Century Ecole Polytechnique, Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee, Unit√© associ√©e au CNRS  See also  * Birmingham School, other contemporary school associated with British industrial capitalism * British Whig Party * Michel Chevalier * Thomas Thomasson  Notes and references   Further reading  * Bresiger, Gregory. \\"Laissez Faire and Little Englanderism: The Rise, Fall, Rise, and Fall of the Manchester School,\\" Journal of Libertarian Studies (1997) 13#1 pp 45‚Äì79. online * William Dyer Grampp, The Manchester School of Economics (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1960), the standard scholarly history * Wallace, Elisabeth. \\"The Political Ideas of the Manchester School,\\" University of Toronto Quarterly (1960) 29#2 pp 122‚Äì138 Category:Liberalism Category:Liberalism in the United Kingdom Category:Libertarianism in the United Kingdom Category:History of Manchester Category:Schools of economic thought ","title":"Manchester Liberalism"},{"id":"3408060","text":"Richway was the discount department store division of Atlanta-based Rich's. It was originally part of Rich's, and was later bought by Federated Department Stores when they purchased the Rich's chain. It was originally known as Richway, a Rich's Company with a more bluish logo than the later orange and black theme under Federated ownership. The sunrise logo means \\"Everything Under The Sun\\", the slogan used in advertisements from that period. The official name of the chain was later Richway Department Stores. A long tagline on commercials was \\"We don't look like a discount store, but our price tags give us away.\\" History =Beginning= Richway first opened in 1970 in metro Atlanta with suburban locations in Smyrna, Sandy Springs, Tucker and College Park. A location in Forest Park opened soon thereafter. These original locations were known for their distinctive raised-wedge skylights that are still found today, yet these were boarded/covered up and hidden by drop ceilings in most subsequent building uses. Richway stores were unusually large for their time, and ahead of their time with larger selections of merchandise than most discounters offered, but with a similar, more upscale line like Target. right =1970s and 1980s= Throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s, the chain spread across the Southeast U.S., with known locations in Georgia, North Carolina (Charlotte/Gastonia), South Carolina (three locations in Columbia), Florida (where it was added as a discount division of Burdines), and two locations in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The three locations in Columbia were part of three malls that opened on the same day in 1977 known as Decker Mall, Woodhill Mall, and Bush River Mall. Of these three malls, Decker Mall is now home to only an ExtraSpace storage facility in the old Richway/Gold Circle/Target building, Woodhill Mall was redeveloped as \\"The Shops at Woodhill\\", and the site of Bush River Mall, demolished in 2006 after being closed for seven years, is now home to a Walmart supercenter and a new strip mall. Richway also anchored the now-redeveloped Roswell Mall in Roswell north of Atlanta, which opened in 1974, another store with the retro skylights (now removed). The distinctive sunrise logo in its final and well-known form was designed by Robert Graham Sanderson, an art director for the chain in Atlanta. Mr. Sanderson also commissioned the famous \\"Black Santa\\" Richway catalogue cover painting. The Santa that the painting used for the cover artwork depicted had such a dark tan that some locals complained that Santa looked Black, claiming that it is well known that Santa is Caucasian of German descent. =Gold Circle and Target= In 1986, Federated Department Stores merged Richway with their discount division, Gold Circle, but retained the Richway name in some markets. Federated by then was in financial trouble and as a means to boost the company's profits, sold all Richway and Gold Circle stores to Kimco which in turn sold 31 of those stores to Dayton‚ÄìHudson Corporation (now Target Corporation) in 1988. The stores were closed, remodeled, and reopened in May 1989 as Target stores; they continued to operate as such until Target began to replace the older stores in the mid-1990s. The 1991 movie Career Opportunities was filmed at a Richway location converted into a Target store located at 4000 Covington Hwy. in Decatur, GA (location T378). That store closed in 1999, and moved five exits north on I-285 to La Vista Road. The former Richway/Target building on Covington Highway now houses a church. Sunshine Market occupies a former Richway in West Palm Beach, FL. Target located in Deerfield Beach Florida which was also a Richway rebuilt in the early 2000s. =Today= Today, most of the former Richway stores either sit abandoned or have been converted to other uses. In Georgia, three former Richway locations in Jonesboro, Riverdale, and Roswell became Value City locations after Target left for newly built stores, with all but Jonesboro (and a non-Richway/Target in Doraville) closed again since early 2008. The Richway in Forest Park is now the Scott Antique Market, still with the open wedge skylights. The Richway in north Marietta is today an office for Wellstar (which owns nearby Kennestone Hospital), since the Target moved a few miles northeast on Sandy Plains Road, not long after the Town Center at Cobb store opened in 1995. The Richway in College Park was converted to a Target in 1989, and closed in early 1998 after store #0778 in nearby Fayetteville opened. Today a new redevelopment is planned for the store. The store northeast of Austell has been vacant for years since a new Target opened just slightly further southwest on Austell Road at the East-West Connector, after that road opened in the late 1990s. The former Richway/Target store on Johnson Ferry Road in Sandy Springs, GA was purchased in 2009 by the newly formed City of Sandy Springs and the entire block has been torn down and redeveloped as'City Springs,' the City Hall of Sandy Springs and accompanying mixed-use development. The former store in Decatur, GA at 4000 Covington Highway was converted to a non-denominational church, Total Grace Christian Center and now is a Baptist church with various outreach ministries, Peace Baptist Church. There are at least two of the original Target conversions still operating. The Target store on North Druid Hills in Briarcliff Heights remains operational. The Smyrna Target store on Cobb Parkway south of Windy Hill Road is also still operating. The building was renovated for the second time in 2005 after an earlier renovation in the 1990s. It still retains the old Richway skylight triangles on the roof, with the left (north) part still bearing the CompUSA sign since its closure in mid-2007. The Sandy Springs store closed in early October 2008 for a new one farther south on Roswell Road, and has been demolished. Other Richways are sitting vacant where the surrounding area has fallen into decline and no reinvestment was made in the former buildings. The two Richways in Chattanooga (one at Northgate Mall and the other at Lee Highway) were converted into office/retail space while the Lee Highway store (which was also used for a flea market) has been demolished to make way for cargo space for the Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant. Several of the former stores located in the Charlotte area are still in use. Two stores on Charlotte's north side, at North Park Mall and Freedom Mall, have since been consolidated into a larger store in the University City area. The former North Park Mall location has sat abandoned for more than a decade, while the Freedom Mall location was demolished as part of the mall's conversion into government offices. The former Independence Boulevard location was demolished after the Target store relocated to Matthews. The site was rebuilt as a BJ's Wholesale Club but is vacant as of 2013; another on Tyvola Road was torn down after the Target store relocated to Carolina Pavilion. The site is now a Costco. The Gastonia location was used as a Target until 2011, when Target relocated to a newly built store nearby. In addition to the above-mentioned, two former Richway locations in Palm Beach County, Florida were also purchased and turned into Target stores. The Palm Beach Lakes Blvd. location was completely demolished (t-391) and a brand new state of the art Super Target now sits on that land. The location in Plantation, Florida was converted over to a Target store and had the fa√ßade updated in 2005 to reflect Target's changes in marketing approach, and to also expand the parking lot to include a parking garage. The Richway store on GA138/20 in Conyers, GA became a Target store and stayed in the former Richway location until October 2006 when it moved to a bigger location on GA20 south. The property was subdivided and part of it is now an LA Fitness center. The Richway store in Tamarac, Florida became a Target in 1989, but relocated in 2000. This store operated as a furniture store called Furniture Power. As of 2012, this building was converted to a charter school.

The movie is based loosely on the Penrod stories by Booth Tarkington. There was a 1953 sequel, By the Light of the Silvery Moon. Plot In a small Indiana town in the mid-1910s, the Winfield household ‚Äì banker father George, his wife Alice, their grown tomboyish daughter Marjorie, their mischievous precocious trouble- making son Wesley, and their exasperated housekeeper Stella ‚Äì have just moved into a larger house in a nicer neighborhood. No one but George is happy about the move, until Marjorie meets their new neighbor, William Sherman, home on a break from his studies at Indiana University. The two are immediately attracted to each other, which makes Margie change her focus from baseball to trying to become a proper young woman. Their resulting relationship is despite, or perhaps because of Bill's unconventional thoughts on life, including not believing in the institution of marriage, or believing in the role money plays in society. The road to a happy life between Margie and Bill is not only hindered by distance as Bill returns to school and Margie's attempts to learn feminine things, but also George's dislike of Bill because of their differing beliefs, the stuffy Hubert Wakely also trying to court Margie (he who is George's choice as an appropriate suitor for her), Wesley's continual meddling in his sister's life, and the onset of World War I. One of those issues may be overcome when Wesley receives a birthday gift from Aunt Martha that used to be his father old slingshot that he used to kill Aunt Martha's best hen. His father discovers the old slingshot after Wesley cracks a window with it, his father gets emotional after he sees it and everything is resolved in time for a happy ending.

His rugby league career spanned the 1950s, 60s and 70s. The Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame honours players who have shown exceptional skill at rugby league, all- time great coaches and referees, and other major contributors to the game who are Australian. It was officially established in 2002, to honour the many past greats of the game, who have played in the New South Wales/Sydney league competition, Australian rugby league competition, Super League competition and the National Rugby League. The first batch of players were inducted to the hall of fame in 2002 including legends of the sport such as Reg Gasnier, Johnny Raper and Wally Lewis. In 2003 another six members were added to the elite club, with six more added in 2004, 2005 and 2006. In 2007 there were three more inductees: three from pre-1940 and three from post World War II. There were thirty-five members of the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame up to the end of 2007. In 2018 the ARL took control of the concept of The Immortals, an accolade till that point administered by Rugby League Week. The ARL clarified the protocols of Immortal induction and the interplay with the Hall of Fame. It was confirmed that Immortals would continue to be inducted rarely & occasionally and would be selected from the overall pool of the Rugby League Hall of Fame. Inductees for the Hall of Fame would occur regularly - perhaps every year - with six new inductees in 2018. It was also confirmed that the 65 members of the NRL's Team of the Century (selected during the 2008 century celebrations) who were not in the Hall of Fame as at 2007, were all to be entered to the Hall of Fame. Effectively 65 players who had been selected for honour in 2008 were added to the Hall of Fame in March 2018; with a further new 6 added in July 2018.

The special featured stop motion clay animation and was produced and directed by Will Vinton. The special debuted alongside A Garfield Christmas and the two continued to be aired back to back in subsequent years. Synopsis The special is co-hosted by Rex (Johnny Counterfit), an erudite Tyrannosaurus rex, and Herb (Tim Conner), a dimwitted and bespectacled Styracosaurus with a gluttonous appetite. The two appeared in previous Will Vinton videos dating back to 1980 including Dinosaurs! - A Fun-Filled Trip Back in Time!, but this Christmas special is the first in which they have dialogue and contemporary personalities, vaguely parodying Siskel and Ebert respectively. Situated in a facsimile of London's Christmas Square, Rex and Herb introduce several stand-alone videos of Christmas carols and holiday standards and discuss the origins of each song relating to different holiday traditions around the world. Among the musical performances: * The Biblical magi sing the verses of \\"We Three Kings\\" traditionally, while their camels sing the chorus in the style of doo-wop. *At Notre Dame Cathedral, The Paris Bell-Harmonic, a group of anthropomorphic church bells who strike their own heads with chime hammers to achieve their respective notes, performs \\"Carol of the Bells.\\" The low C bell (the tonic) constantly dawdles and chimes out of tune, enraging the maestro, Quasimodo, who uses a slingshot on the bell to get the proper tone at the end. * A children's choir sings \\"O Christmas Tree\\", with the video depicting various scenes taking place inside of Christmas ornaments * \\"Angels We Have Heard On High\\" is set to a walrus couple doing an interpretive ice ballet while several luckless penguins watch. * At a black church in the countryside, a soul/jazz hybrid rendition of \\"Joy to the World\\" plays out in colorful scenes. (This segment, using stylized, flat animation resembling paintings and stained glass windows, is the only segment not rendered in Vinton's trademark Claymation.) * The California Raisins perform a cover of the Temptations' version of \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\\". Throughout the program, Rex futilely attempts to clarify the true pronunciation and meaning of the term \\"wassail', featured in the Christmas carol \\"Here We Come A-Wassailing\\". As the show progresses, Rex is accosted by different groups, all singing lyrically incorrect versions of the song. * \\"Here We Come A-Waffling\\", by a kennel of dogs selling waffles from a vendor's wagon. * \\"Here We Come A-Waddling\\", by a gaggle of straggling geese carrying baskets of goodies. * \\"Here We Come A-Wallowing\\", by a herd of slovenly pigs on a John Deere-style field wagon gorging themselves on an abundance of assorted fruits. Rex is convinced that his own pronunciation is correct, but he is continually questioned by the others including Herb when he is not busy excessively partaking of the various Christmas treats offered by each group; consulting the dictionary provides no meaningful help. Finally, near the program's end, a large truck loaded with cider-swilling Irish elves arrives in Christmas Square singing the correct version of the carol, validating Rex's theory much to his delight. When asked, one of the townies explains the real meaning of wassailing: going around the neighborhood singing Christmas carols, and getting treats and cordials. At the end, the entire cast performs \\"Here We Come A-Wassailing\\", and then \\"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\\" as the end credits roll. Production Filming took place in Portland, Oregon. Awards 1988‚ÄîPrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program given to Will Vinton (executive producer/director), David Altschul (producer) and Ralph Liddle (writer) Parody This special was spoofed as Christmas with the California Prunes in the 2003 Christmas episode of The Simpsons (\\"'Tis The Fifteenth Season\\") The Prunes sing \\"O Pruney Night\\" (a parody of \\"O Holy Night\\"), which includes the lines: :\\"O Pruney Night, the stars are slightly wrinkled :We are the fruit that your grandmother loves\\". (Lisa remarks that the song is \\"offensive to Christians and prunes!\\") Soundtrack & Video A companion soundtrack album was released by Atlantic Records in 1988 and was originally available on LP, cassette, and compact disc. The album contains six songs not featured on the special, including an alternate version of \\"Angels We Have Heard On High\\". The song \\"O Christmas Tree\\", as featured in the special, was excluded from the soundtrack. The special was released on the Hen's Tooth Video DVD Will Vinton's Claymation Christmas Plus Halloween & Easter Celebrations in 2003.

She publicly denounced Democratic Gubernatorial candidates Phil Angelides and Steve Westly for supporting the death penalty. She is also outspoken on other social issues, such as the environment and immigration. Barbara's outspoken criticism of Angelides and Westly resulted in her not being invited to a number of key Democratic Party events during the general election season .

He completed the course at Harrison Technical High School in Chicago in 1921, and entered the Naval Academy later that year. He graduated on 4 June 1925 and received his ensign's commission. His first assignment was three years in the armored cruiser Pittsburgh (CA-4). In early 1929, Voge returned to the United States from the Far East to attend the Submarine School at New London, Connecticut. After completing that course and qualifying for submarine duty, he spent the bulk of his remaining time at sea in submarines. January 1931 through June 1932: S-29 July 1932 to September 1933: war plans and intelligence training at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station. September 1933 through June 1935: Instructor in Marine Engineering at the Naval Academy. June 1935 until May 1937: Command of S-18 May 1937 through August 1937: Command of S-33 August 1937 through September 1939: Naval Ordnance Plant at Baldwin on Long Island September 1939 to late January 1940: A four-month tour of duty as commissioning executive officer of the destroyer Rowan (DD-405) In mid-February 1940, Commander Voge returned to the Asiatic Fleet and assumed command of the submarine Sealion (SS-195), based at Cavite in the Philippines, and commanded that submarine until the opening day of American participation in World War II. At the outbreak of hostilities on 8 December 1941 (West Longitude Time), Voge suffered the double ignominy of having his command caught in overhaul and, three days later, of losing her to enemy bombs while still at Cavite Navy Yard. Voge, however, quickly recovered from that blow, assumed command of Sailfish (SS-192) (formerly named Squalus) on 17 December, and led her on five successful war patrols during the first eight months of 1942. Until the Battles of Coral Sea and of Midway in May and June, respectively, only Pacific Fleet submarines like Sailfish were able to fight to impede the Japanese onslaught; and their war patrols provided the one bright spot for the Allied cause in the Pacific. In August 1942, upon the completion of his fifth war patrol in Sailfish, Voge received orders to join the staff of Commander, Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet, as operations and combat intelligence officer. He retained that position, in which he was promoted to Captain to date from 20 July 1943, until late in the war, when he was ordered to Washington, D.C., to serve in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. On 1 November 1946, Capt. Voge was retired from the navy and advanced to the rank of rear admiral. A little over two years later, Rear Admiral Voge died at the United Hospital at Port Chester, New York.

Filmed in the South Wales coalfield, the principal Welsh coal mining area, the film is about a seaman who joins a mining community. It includes their passion for singing as well as the dangers and precariousness of working in a mine. Plot David Goliath is an African-American sailor who deserts his ship when it arrives in Wales. He climbs onto the back of a freight train and meets Bert, who is work-shy and scoffs at David's determination to seek employment. The train arrives at a small, mining town and the two men briefly attempt to busk before being scolded by Mrs Parry for making unpleasant noise outside her shop. They stop outside a building where a male choir are rehearsing and David begins singing along. The choir conductor, Dick Parry, is determined to make David a member and offers to make him become a lodger at his house. Despite his wife, Mrs Parry, objecting to the idea, her protests are moot when their sons and daughters side with their father. Dick gets David a job as a miner to work along with him and his eldest son Emlyn, much to the racist objections of one of the workers, but Dick and David accidentally mine close to gas, causing a fire, in which many miners perish. Emlyn was not present at the site that morning and rushes into the mine as a rescuer; David carries Dick out of the fire but is unable to save him. A month later, Dick's choir appears at a competition but only David performs for Dick's memory. The mine has been closed since the disaster and the rest of the miners are forced to gather coal off the top of a spoil heap, but they are unable to receive the same amount of pay that the mine had made them and many have to accept social benefits. A year later, Mrs Parry is struggling with five children to care for and is visited by Mrs Owen‚Äîthe mother of Emlyn's fianc√©e, Gwen‚Äîwho snaps that Gwen is not allowed marry Emlyn because he cannot make enough money to look after her. Gwen later sneaks to the Parry house and tells Emlyn that she would marry him no matter his income, which gives Emlyn the idea to march to London and demand that the government reopens the mine. Emlyn takes David and two other miners and they walk to London, and arrive the day after Germany invaded Poland. The British government are too busy focusing on building up an army and reopen the mine to send the gatecrashers away. The team return to Wales and attempt to reopen the mine, but a large fire causes the mine to collapse and trap the team inside. Their candle flickers constantly, indicating the oxygen disappearing and David estimates they have an hour left until suffocation. One miner finds a weak rock and tries to break through with a pickaxe but he and David fail. Emlyn decides to leave the group to explode an exit through with dynamite, but, knowing that it could lead to another Parry's death, David sneaks away as the rest of their team pray and punches Emlyn unconscious, activating the dynamite and breaking through the rock. The other two miners wake up Emlyn, discovering David's lifeless body nearby and pray for David's soul, and the mine is reopened. The town sing in unison as the coal is transported through the mine.

Robeson's role was based on the real-life adventures of a Black miner from West Virginia who drifted to Wales by way of England, searching for work. After two years of refusing offers from major studios, Robeson agreed to appear in this independent British production, seeing (he told The Glasgow Sentinel) an opportunity to \\"depict the Negro as he really is‚Äînot the caricature he is always represented to be on the screen.\\" Filming was completed in September 1939 but producer Michael Balcon and director Pen Tennyson were forced to re-cut the ending of the film in the new jingoistic atmosphere following the outbreak of war. An ending in which the workers took control of the mine was replaced with a scene in which management agreed to make concessions to the miners. Critical reception Robeson's criticism of British and French appeasement and strident pro-Soviet statements (immediately after the signing of the Nazi-Soviet Pact) led to his (and by extension the film) being placed on a publicity blacklist by Lord Beaverbrook, proprietor of the Daily Express. However, the Monthly Film Bulletin described the film as a \\"moving and enthrallingly interesting story of courage, endurance and self- sacrifice,\\" praising it as \\"an outstanding achievement for all concerned\\" and singling out Pen Tennyson's \\"sensitive and skillful\\" direction and Robeson's \\"impressive presence\\" and \\"glorious voice\\". Variety disparaged the film as possessing \\"not much dramatic wealth\\" and compared it unfavourably with Carol Reed's The Stars Look Down. The reviewer also complained that Robeson \\"delivers only two songs and neither solo\\". The film critic Matthew Sweet declared in 2005 that if the film had been completed before the outbreak of war \\"it would have been the most uncompromisingly Marxist picture ever produced in Anglophone cinema\\". Significance In The Proud Valley, Robeson depicts a kind of Black hero rarely seen in Hollywood, one who fuses his political and artistic sensibilities in the image of a Black working man who achieves kinship across boundaries of race and nationality. Years later, Robeson would remark that, of all his films, this was his favorite because it showed workers in a positive light. The Proud Valley was the first film premiered on radio. An hour long edit of the film was broadcast on the BBC Home Service a week and a half before its London release.

The new name, Milleretta, means 'Miller's little one', referring to the Scottish geologist and stonemason, Hugh Miller. When Milleretta was first described, there was only one specimen known (specimen number BP/1/3821). As this was a juvenile specimen, there was uncertainty as to its classification. It wasn't until 1950 that an adult Milleretta was discovered by J.W. Kitching on Wildgebosch farm in New Bethesda, South Africa. This specimen (specimen number BP/1/2040) was found at the Dicynodon Assemblage zone. The finding at this zone established the same geographic range compared to other millerettids. Description The vertebrae of Milleretta have wide neural arches, a synapomorphy of their class, Parareptilia. It had spines coming off the neural arches. Horizontally orientated zygopophyses are present, as well as prominent transverse processes. BP/1/2040's adult vertebrae contrast those of the juvenile specimen only with the fused centrum and arch in the adult. The ribs are especially sturdy dorsally, along with caudal expansions that help overlap the next rib over posteriorly. These holocephalus ribs contain crenelations. The thick ribs give protection to the cavity, but decrease the amount of flexibility of the body and decrease swiftness. Eunotosaurus shares thick and overlapped ribs. However, the thick ribs are not a synapomorphy of the two taxon, as the ribs‚Äô thickness were acquired differently.Debraga, M. & Reisz, R. R. 196. The early Permian reptile Acleistorhinus pteroticus and its phylogenetic position. 1. Vert. Paleont., 16(3), 384‚Äì395. Milleretta had plesiomorphic vertebrae and made its ribs wider by growing its bone out the shaft to airfoil-like section. In contrast, Eunotosaurus‚Äô trunk vertebrae are stretched and it has ‚ÄúT‚Äù shaped ribs with double articulations. Not only are the centrum and arch fused, but the pubes and ischia are fused in its pelvic girdle. Alongside the fused bones, the dorsal blade on the ilium is expanded width-wise. The femur becoming fully ossified, complete formation of articular ends at the limbs, and expanding ribs occur as Milleretta become adults. There was a single row of teeth on the palatine.Thommasen, H. & Carroll, R. L. 1981. Broomia, the oldest known millerettid reptile. Palaeontology 24: 379‚Äì390.  Classification  First named in 1956, Millerettidae was a clade containing all reptiles closer to Milleretta rubidgei than to Macroleter poezicus. Millerettids were among the most basal members of the parareptile lineage.Durand, J.F. \\"Major African Contributions to Palaeozoic and Mesozoic Vertebrate Palaeontology.\\" Journal of African Earth Sciences 43.1-3 (2005): 53‚Äì82. Milleretta is considered the leased derived member of the family, relative to Milleropsis and Millerosaurus.Gow, C.E. 1972. The osteology and relationships of the Millerettidae (Reptilia, Cotylosauria). Journal of the Zoological Society of London, l67:219-264. Huge gaps are at their maximum between the period of Milleretta as ghost lineages show up. Something attributed to this family is the creation of the lateral temporal opening, which adult Milleretta managed to close completely. Eunotosaurus, which was also discovered in the Balfour Formation and lived around the same time as Milleretta, has sometimes been considered the sister taxon to Millerettidae.Cisneros J.C., Rubidge B.S, Mason R., and Dube C. 2008. Analysis of millerettid parareptile relationships in the light of new material of Broomiaperplexa Watson, 1914, from the Permian of South Africa, Journal of Systematic Palaeontology,6:4, 453-462, DOI: 10.1017/S147720190800254X The cladogram below displays the phylogenetic position of the Milleretta, from Ruta et al., 2011.  Paleobiology  The two specimens of Milleretta both lived at the end of the Late-Permian (Changsingian). The vast range of sharp teeth helped make it possible to chew the insects present at the time. The presumed great hearing of Milleretta helped them hunt prey by being able to better hear movement. The presumption comes from the two depressions located at the bases of the skull. At first, the depressions brought doubts to whether it was anapsid. More investigation concluded that the depressions were probably the eardrums. Milleretta probably lived in a forest-like environment due to the preserved forest-floor litter from the Karoo Basin located in South Africa.Knight,Cassi.2010. Late Permian Paleoenvironmental Factors Expounded Through Analysis of a Forest-Floor Paleosol Profile, Karoo Basin, South Africa. pp. 1‚Äì10. A recent examination of soil profiles shows that the environment in which Milleretta lived became more dry as time moved on. This change in climate may have been caused by the mass-extinction that happened in the region. Right now, there is still some uncertainty of what the conditions were like, one reason is potentially the lack of geochemical studies done in the region.

He was an accompanist on dozens of recordings by blues artists over five decades. He began his career as a drummer for Elmore James but was most famous as a blues vocalist and blues harp player. For nearly two decades he was the featured vocalist for Anson Funderburgh & the Rockets. Biography Myers was born in Laurel, Mississippi. He acquired juvenile cataracts at age seven and was left legally blind for the rest of his life, despite corrective surgery. He could make out shapes and shadows, but could not read print at all; he was taught Braille. He acquired an interest in music while a schoolboy in Jackson, Mississippi, and became skilled enough at playing the trumpet and drums that he received a nondegree scholarship from the American Conservatory of Music (formerly the American Conservatory School of Music) in Chicago. Myers attended school by day and at night frequented the nightclubs of the South Side. There he met and was sitting in with Jimmy Rogers, Muddy Waters, Howling Wolf, Little Walter, Hound Dog Taylor, Robert Lockwood, Jr., and Elmore James. Myers played drums with Elmore James on a fairly steady basis from 1952 until James's death, in 1963, and is credited on many of James's historic recordings for Chess Records. In 1956, Myers wrote and recorded what was to be his most famous single, \\"Sleeping in the Ground\\", a song that has been covered by Blind Faith, Eric Clapton, Robert Cray, and many other blues artists; it was also featured on Bob Dylan's Theme Time Radio Hour show on \\"Sleep\\". From the early 1960s until 1986, Myers worked clubs in and around Jackson and across the South in the (formerly) racially segregated string of venues known as the Chitlin' Circuit. He also toured the world with Sylvia Embry and the Mississippi All-Stars Blues Band. In 1986, Myers met Anson Funderburgh, from Plano, Texas, and joined his band, The Rockets. Myers toured all over the US and the world with the Rockets, enjoying a partnership that endured until the time of his death, from complications due to surgery for throat cancer, on July 17, 2006, in Dallas, Texas. Just before Myers died, he toured as a solo artist in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, with the Swedish band Bloosblasters. Legacy That same year, the University Press of Mississippi published Myers's autobiography, Sam Myers: The Blues is My Story. The writer Jeff Horton, whose work has appeared in Blues Revue and Southwest Blues, chronicled Myers's history and delved into his memories of life on the road. Awards Myers and the Rockets collectively won nine W. C. Handy Awards, including three awards in the category Band of the Year and the 2004 award for Best Traditional Album of the Year. In 2005, Myers's album Coming from the Old School was nominated in the category Traditional Blues Album of the Year. In January 2000, Myers was inducted into the Farish Street Walk of Fame in Jackson, Mississippi, an honor he shares with Dorothy Moore and Sonny Boy Williamson II. In 2006, just months before Myers died, the Governor of Mississippi presented him with the Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts, and he was named the state's Blues Ambassador by the Mississippi Arts Commission.

This is in contrast to algorithms that are compute- bound, where the number of elementary computation steps is the deciding factor. Memory and computation boundaries can sometimes be traded against each other, e.g. by saving and reusing preliminary results or using lookup tables. Memory-bound functions and memory functions Memory-bound functions and memory functions are related in that both involve extensive memory access, but a distinction exists between the two. Memory functions use a dynamic programming technique called memoization in order to relieve the inefficiency of recursion that might occur. It is based on the simple idea of calculating and storing solutions to subproblems so that the solutions can be reused later without recalculating the subproblems again. The best known example that takes advantage of memoization is an algorithm that computes the Fibonacci numbers. The following pseudocode uses recursion and memoization, and runs in linear CPU time: Fibonacci (n) { for i = 0 to n-1 results[i] = -1 // -1 means undefined return Fibonacci_Results (results, n); } Fibonacci_Results (results, n) { if (results[n] != -1) // If it has been solved before, return results[n] // look it up. if (n  0) val = 0 else if (n  1) val = 1 else val = Fibonacci_Results(results, n-2 ) + Fibonacci_Results(results, n-1) results[n] = val // Save this result for re-use. return val } Compare the above to an algorithm that uses only recursion, and runs in exponential CPU time: Recursive_Fibonacci (n) { if (n  0) return 0 if (n  1) return 1 return Recursive_Fibonacci (n-1) + Recursive_Fibonacci (n-2) } While the recursive- only algorithm is simpler and more elegant than the algorithm that uses recursion and memoization, the latter has a significantly lower time complexity than the former. The term \\"memory-bound function\\" has surfaced only recently and is used principally to describe a function that uses XOR and consists of a series of computations in which each computation depends on the previous computation. Whereas memory functions have long been an important actor in improving time complexity, memory-bound functions have seen far fewer applications. Recently, however, scientists have proposed a method using memory-bound functions as a means to discourage spammers from abusing resources, which could be a major breakthrough in that area. Using memory- bound functions to prevent spam Memory-bound functions might be useful in a proof-of-work system that could deter spam, which has become a problem of epidemic proportions on the Internet. In 1992, IBM research scientists Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor published a paper at CRYPTO 1992 titled Pricing via Processing or Junk Mail, (updated version of same) suggesting a possibility of using CPU-bound functions to deter abusers from sending spam. The scheme was based on the idea that computer users are much more likely to abuse a resource if the cost of abusing the resource is negligible: the underlying reason spam has become so rampant is that sending an e-mail has minuscule cost for spammers. Dwork and Naor proposed that spamming might be reduced by injecting an additional cost in the form of an expensive CPU computation: CPU-bound functions would consume CPU resources at the sender's machine for each message, thus preventing huge amounts of spam from being sent in a short period. The basic scheme that protects against abuses is as follows: Let be sender, be recipient, and be an e-mail. If has agreed beforehand to receive e-mail from , then is transmitted in the usual way. Otherwise, computes some function and sends to . checks if what it receives from is of the form . If yes, accepts . Otherwise, rejects . ~~The figure on the right depicts cases in which there were no prior agreements~~. The function is selected such that the verification by is relatively fast (taking a millisecond) and such that the computation by is somewhat slow (involving at least several seconds). Therefore, will be discouraged from sending to multiple recipients with no prior agreements: the cost in terms of both time and computing resources of computing repeatedly will become very prohibitive for a spammer who intends to send many millions of e-mails. The major problem of using the above scheme is that fast CPUs compute much faster than slow CPUs. Further, higher-end computer systems also have sophisticated pipelines and other advantageous features that facilitate computations. As a result, a spammer with a state-of-the-art system will hardly be affected by such deterrence while a typical user with a mediocre system will be adversely affected. If a computation takes a few seconds on a new PC, it may take a minute on an old PC, and several minutes on a PDA, which might be a nuisance for users of old PCs, but probably unacceptable for users of PDAs. The disparity in client CPU speed constitutes one of the prominent roadblocks to widespread adoption of any scheme based on a CPU-bound function. Therefore, researchers are concerned with finding functions that most computer systems will evaluate at about the same speed, so that high-end systems might evaluate these functions somewhat faster than low-end systems (2‚Äì10 times faster, but not 10‚Äì100 times faster) as CPU disparities might imply. These ratios are \\"egalitarian\\" enough for the intended applications: the functions are effective in discouraging abuses and do not add a prohibitive delay on legitimate interactions, across a wide range of systems. The new egalitarian approach is to rely on memory-bound functions. As stated before, a memory- bound function is a function whose computation time is dominated by the time spent accessing memory. A memory-bound function accesses locations in a large region of memory in an unpredictable way, in such a way that using caches are not effective. In recent years, the speed of CPU has grown drastically, but there has been comparatively small progress in developing faster main memory. Since the ratios of memory latencies of machines built in the last five years is typically no greater than two, and almost always less than four, the memory-bound function will be egalitarian to most systems for the foreseeable future.

He came to prominence in 1997 as the founder and frontman of Roni Size & Reprazent, a drum and bass collective. That year they won the Mercury Prize for their debut studio album New Forms. He resurrected Reprazent in 2008 with the release of a deluxe edition of New Forms on Universal. Early life Williams, son of Jamaican immigrants, grew up in the Bristol suburb of St. Andrews. He cites reggae as one of his early influences. He was expelled from school at the age of 16 and started attending house parties run by Bristol soundsystem The Wild Bunch (a predecessor of Massive Attack). He learned the basics about music production at his local youth club, the Sefton Park basement project, which provided record players, a mixing desk, drum machines and samplers. He worked with his brother's comprehensive collection of Studio One records and later set up a home studio, buying a sampler. His future musical partner, Krust, had been a member of the Fresh 4, whose \\"Wishing on a Star\\" reached the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart in late 1989. Williams, Krust, Suv and DJ Die founded Full Cycle Records. Aided by Chris Lewis, Roni Size founded the record label WTP (\\"Where's The Party At?\\") as part of Circus Warp. With Dave Cridge who also DJed for Circus Warp and ran Replay Records Bristol, the two would visit The Record Basement in Reading and in 1993, Full Cycle and Dope Dragon were established. RCA Records employee Bryan Gee was an early admirer. In 1994, when he founded V Recordings, the first releases were Krust's Deceivers EP as catalogue number V001 and Agility, the debut release of Roni Size and DJ Die, as V002. In 1997, Roni Size and Reprazent released their biggest single in Southeast Asia, specifically in the Philippines, with \\"Brown Paper Bag\\". Williams is an avid Bristol Rovers fan and turned out for them in the charity match vs rivals Bristol City on May Bank Holiday Monday, 2013. Musical style Much of the acclaim centred on Size's melding of the propulsive jungle beats accompanied by live drums and double bass. The band consists of Williams (compositions/programming), DJ Krust, Onallee (vocals), Dynamite MC and rapper Bahamadia (a former prot√©g√©e of Gang Starr). As a result, Reprazent's drum and bass is equally informed by hip hop, funk, soul and house. Career Following their mainstream breakthrough, Reprazent had a series of festival appearances in the summer of 1997 (including Tribal Gathering). Their New Forms LP won the Mercury Music Prize. The singles from the album all featured singer Onallee, whose call for the music in \\"Brown Paper Bag\\" is a signal ravers still respond to. The album went platinum, and Roni Size and his collaborators returned to the studio. Williams subsequently teamed up with DJ Die and Leonie Laws in Breakbeat Era, before returning to Reprazent to record the second album, October 2000's In the Mode, which included guest vocals from Zack de la Rocha of Rage Against the Machine and Method Man of Wu-Tang Clan. In 2001, he returned to the studio and started working with Tali, who had recently arrived from New Zealand on her album Lyric on My Lip. In this time, he also produced Touching Down ‚Äì released in October 2002. This, his first truly solo album, included 16 tracks segued into one hour's set. He came back to V Recordings in 2005 with the release of Return To V, which included vocal collaborations with artists such as Beverly Knight, Jocelyn Brown, Vikter Duplaix and Rodney P. Roni Size resurrected Reprazent in 2008 with the release of a deluxe edition of New Forms on Universal. The reformed band included original members Dynamite MC, Onallee and bass player Si John alongside Yuval Gabay (Soul Coughing), D Product, Jay Wilcox and Pete Josef. Roni Size and Reprazent toured in some of the biggest festivals in Europe, including Bestival, Glastonbury, Lovebox (festival), EXIT and Rock Herk. As a result, they were among the nominees for Best Dance Act from the UK Festival Awards. The band started 2009 with a tour of Australia as part of the Good Vibrations Festival. Following on from this, Roni Size and Reprazent returned to North America for the first time in seven years as one of the headliners at the 2009 Ultra Music Festival in Miami. They then went on to perform at Coachella,Evelyn McDonnell: Coachella: Roni Size and Reprazent bring back their beat Los Angeles Times Music Blog, 16 April 2009 appearing as the final act of the festival. In September 2009, Roni Size and Reprazent played a gig with an orchestra and choir to mark the re-opening of Bristol‚Äôs Colston Hall, collaborating with the BBC‚Äôs Nature's Great Events composer, William Goodchild. In addition to older material, the band played material from a forthcoming Reprazent album.

It documents the culture and competition surrounding two dance forms known as Clowning and Krumping. Rize was executive produced by Ishbel Whitaker, Barry Peele, Ellen Jacobson-Clarke, Stavros Merjos, and Rebecca Skinner. Rize was produced by Lions Gate Entertainment with a production budget of $700 thousand. It was released domestically on June 24, 2005 and grossed $3.3 million at the box office. Synopsis Rize is a documentary following an interview schedule of two related dancing subcultures of Los Angeles called Clowning and Krumping. The first series of interviews introduces, describes and develops the dance style known as Clowning. A descendant of 1980s breakdancing, Clowning is a contemporary street art all its own, characterized by speedy, flowing limbs, feverish shakes, hipness, and confounding athletic tricks. Tommy Johnson, better known by his alias Tommy the Clown, is a former drug dealer and a man with a mission. For Tommy, Clowning is more than an aesthetic pastime: In an area besieged by drive-by shootings, drug deals and unemployment; Clowning is his way of offering an optimistic alternative for youngsters, a means of self- expression and a chance to channel positive energy. The second series of interviews and footage explains how the dance style known as Krumping evolved from Clowning and matured into its own identity. Like Clowning, Krumping is characterized by free, expressive exaggerated, and highly energetic movement. The youths who started Krumping, known as Lil C' and Miss Prissy, saw the dance as a way for them to escape gang life and \\"to release anger, aggression and frustration positively, in a non-violent way.\\" The third section of the film depicts a dance battle called The Battle Zone which takes place between Clowns and Krumpers at the Great Western Forum in 2004. The film style and soundtrack draws creative ties between African dance rituals and the developing style of Krumping.  Production  The film Rize was written and directed by David LaChapelle. Working alongside LaChapelle were executive producers Ishbel Whitaker, Barry Peele, Ellen Jacobson-Clarke, Stavros Merjos, and Rebecca Skinner. Rize focuses on the African-American communities of Clowns and Krumpers in South Central Los Angeles. Most of these dancers are young, poor, and would be classified as \\"at risk.\\" Director David LaChapelle follows these dancers from rehearsal to Battlezone, an annual dance competition, alternating between footage of the dancing and interviews with the dancers and their families. The film is set in the outskirts of South Central Los Angeles‚Äìareas like Inglewood and Compton that have become synonymous in the American popular imagination with deviances of all kinds, due to representations in news media, music, and film. However, LaChapelle does not begin the film in the present day. Focusing instead on the history of racial conflict in South Central, including footage of the Watts riots of 1965 and the 1992 Rodney King riots. LaChapelle situates his film deliberately within a racially specific violence. The film is dedicated to a dancer named Quinesha (Lil Dimples) Dunford, who was killed with a 13-year old friend in a 2003 drive-by shooting, and not one of the dancers within the film is without a story like Quinesha's to tell.  Soundtrack  *Rize (soundtrack) The documentary features original material by Flii Stylz (\\"Rize\\", \\"I Krump\\", \\"Beastly\\", and \\"Recognize\\"), Christina Aguilera (\\"Soar\\"), and an entry by UK hip-hop star Dizzee Rascal (\\"Fix Up, Look Sharp\\"), as well as a number of traditional gospel songs, including the Edwin Hawkins Singers' \\"Oh Happy Day\\".  Reception  Rize received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 84% rating based on 91 reviews, with an average rating of 4.0/5. The site's consensus reads, ‚Äú The dances in Rize are electric even if the documentary doesn‚Äôt go that deeply into the performers‚Äô lives. Metacritic reports a 74 out of 100 rating based on 29 critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated ‚Äúthe most remarkable thing about Rize is that it is real.‚Äù Sid Smith of the Chicago Tribune stated that Rize is, ‚Äúa compelling, bittersweet hybrid of a movie, one celebrating an enormous and hitherto unsung underground talent, while suggesting that art goes only so far in solving the enormous challenges of the underprivileged life.‚Äù Robert Koehler of Variety gave the film an 80 out of 100 and stated that, ‚ÄúRize is an eye-popping lensing and an appreciation of social complexities combined for an entirely satisfying experience.‚Äù The movie was released in the United States, France, Australia, Germany, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Austria, among others.

Elder Wills and starring Paul Robeson. One of two elements pivotal to the plot is an opera composer named Gabriel Donizetti, presumably suggested by the historical opera composer Gaetano Donizetti. The other is a medallion that serves to identify Robeson's character as a descendant of an African monarch. Song of Freedom may best represent the opportunity Robeson was looking for to \\"give a true picture of many aspects of the life of the coloured man in the West. Hitherto on the screen, he has been characterized or presented only as a comedy character. This film shows him as a real man.\\" Robeson was also given final cut approval on the film, an unprecedented option at the time for an actor of any race. As in Sanders of the River, the film called for documentary scenes of West African traditional dances and ceremonies, but this time Robeson obtained a contract giving him final cut, so that the film's message would not be changed behind the doors of the editing room. Robeson plays Zinga, a black dockworker in England with a great baritone singing voice. He is discovered by an opera impresario, and is catapulted into great fame as an international opera star. Yet he feels alienated from his African past, and out of place in England. By chance, he is informed that an ancestral medallion that he wears is proof of his lineage to African kings, and he leaves fame and fortune to take his rightful place of royalty. Reunited with his people, he plans to improve their lives by combining the best of western technology with the best of traditional African ways. Although the film was not a box office success in the US, it was notably chosen in 1950 to open the convention of Ghana's Convention People's Party. The ceremonies were presided over by the future first prime minister of independent Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah, Robeson's friend from his London years.  Plot  The first part of the film's story takes place in the year 1700 on an island called Casanga off the west coast of Africa. The island has not yet attracted the attention of the slave traders on the mainland, but its people are suffering fierce oppression under their hereditary queen Zinga - a tyrant, despot, and mistress of cruelty. What first appears on screen is a grassland landscape in which men of an African tribe are patrolling, with haystacks and rugged hills in the background. Into this scene there comes a bare-chested young African, as strong as a bull, looking around him cautiously. Next we see the brutal Queen Zinga, wearing a leopard-skin dress, a straw hat, and a shell necklace on which hangs a medallion, a symbol of kingship. Laughing vigorously, she is teasing a man tied on a wooden column, who is supposed to be the king of Casanga. Zinga takes off the necklace and puts it on the man's neck, taunting him as a \\"one-second king\\" and trying to kill him straight away. Suddenly, a girl, apparently frustrated by the cruelty of the planned execution, rushes towards the queen, grabs the medallion, and runs off. Astonished, the queen orders her soldiers to catch the fleeing girl and to recover the medallion. However, with the help of the strong young man seen at the beginning of the film, she is able to escape from the soldiers and the two get onto a raft to row it to the mainland. Once there, they turn to a white slave-trader for help. The slaver happily accepts them into his camp and adds them to his chain. Then, along with all the other blacks the slaver has acquired, the couple is filled with anxiety and fear. Sent to England by boat to begin their new life, they are not sure what is in store for them. Time runs on and historical events unfold, such as the abolition of the slave trade in the British Empire in 1807. But not until 1838 did the slaves themselves become free from the oppressing situation and the social status for blacks start to improve. Chains and handcuffs are destroyed, ropes and whips are burned, and a seemingly brand new story begins, centring on John Zinga, a black dockworker in England with a great baritone singing voice. His singing impresses all his colleagues on the wharf. Children in his apartment block fall asleep soundly when he sings, but he himself doesn‚Äôt realize what use he can make use of his voice. In fact, what keeps hovering in his mind is the eagerness to discover his true origins and to help his own people, although he doesn‚Äôt know who they are. Zinga always considers himself out of place in London and is often blamed by his wife for being ‚Äònot satisfied‚Äô, but never does he change his mind. Finally, one day an opera impresario hears him singing and tries his best to find out about him. And in a pub, while Zinga is being invited by the owner to sing the song \\"Lonely Road\\", Gabriel Donizetti, the famous impresario, comes quietly in from the door and sits in the audience, watching, listening, and enjoying the beautiful song. \\"No more docker, but a great career\\" Donizetti promises Zinga, who is shocked and surprised since he thinks he can achieve his dream of travelling back to Africa by this chance. They shake hands with each other and Donizetti leaves a card for Zinga to come to his hotel room the next day. Zinga can‚Äôt wait to go. The next day he dresses in a suit, apparently for the first time since he both walks and acts in a lame and inappropriate way. Zinga's wife is also with him to deal with the hotel managers. In the end they find the way to Donizetti's room and he starts a series of tests and introduces several skills to help Zinga improve his singing. At first Zinga is reluctant to accept these instructions, like ‚Äòbreathing from the stomach‚Äô and ‚Äòsinging from the breast‚Äô, claiming that he knows how to sing. And he fights against singing in a suit, since he doesn‚Äôt feel ‚Äòfree‚Äô. His voice significantly lacks emotion compared to when he sings freely with friends and in a pub about his homeland in Africa. But after his wife's comforting, mainly focussing on the chance of travelling back to Africa, he is persuaded to follow those doctrinaire rules and techniques. After long training and practice, Zinga becomes an international opera star and succeeds in all kind of concerts and dramas. This brings him wealth and fame that he has never dreamt of. Yet he feels alienated from his African past, always being sarcastic towards his slave-born identity as his being referred as the Negro King. One day after a great performance, Zinga is instructed to give a speech about what he feels about his success. Not good at public speaking, he sings an old song derived from his long lost childhood memory that he barely remembers and into which has to put some words. In the song, he himself is regarded as a ‚Äòwanderer‚Äô and ‚Äòhears the cold felt by his people‚Äô. John has a feeling that by singing the song he may find out some information about his origins, which means much to him. The result does not fail him. The song is moving and invokes one of the audience's memories about the song. He comes to the dressing room at the back of the stage and talk to John about what he knows. John then finds out that his ancestor belongs to the island of Casanga, located on the west coast of Africa. The man from the audience, Pele, was the only white man to escape from the island since it was dominated by a brutal queen, and it is now ruled by a wicked witch doctor. And the song John sang was the secret song passed on by every king, regarded as the \\"Song of Freedom\\" of the Casanga people. Pele also tells Zinga the medallion hanging on his neck, which he got from his father and his father had from his great-grandfather, is the symbol of the kingship -----he, John Zinga, is the king of his people. Hearing that his people are still uncivilized on the island, Zinga's idea of going back to his homeland to help his people became even more fixed. At this time Donizetti happens to come in and tells John some good news - a new contract to work in the great New York City. Zinga refuses to go to New York to carry on his singing career, since he considers his people bigger than his success. Donizetti is mad about Zinga leaving his career, but cannot stop him from crossing the ocean to come to the little island in Africa. When Zinga arrives on the island he, his wife and a servant are not trusted by the aboriginals. Even though they have the same skin color and Zinga has the medallion which proves him the king, he and his fellows are still considered out-siders, strangers or even bad guys coming from the whites‚Äô country. That's far from Zinga's expectation, which lets him down for a time. His servant wants to resign and tell him to give up, even he himself thinks the place is too primitive and his people are too hard to change. But his wife stands by his side and encourages him ‚Äòthe worse things are, the more you can change‚Äô. Soon he cheers up and waits for his chance in a shabby dome. And it comes. Zinga finds out that the witch doctor locks patients up instead of treating them for the lack of medicine. The witch doctor also announces that when a person gets sick - no matter a fever or cancer - he's dead rather than ill. To deal with this inhuman act, Zinga gives the patient Penicillin and tries to heal them. Some of the people start to believe in Zinga. They tell him \\"I‚Äôm your man, but you can be no king.\\" But this doesn‚Äôt last long when the witch doctor began to form various rituals to cast the ‚Äòdisaster‚Äô the outsiders brought to the island. What's worse is that the people's trust in Zinga diminishes since the patients he tried to cure all die. To break the superstition Zinga interrupts the rites, attempting to show that no taboos are going to act on him, but is scolded by the crowds. Therefore, the witch doctor come up with a task of bringing the rain. He claims that by rituals he can always bring rains to the island, then the gods and ghosts will be satisfied and cast no disaster and diseases to the men and women; yet Zinga points out frankly that the cause of disease is the bacteria and germs in the river and he cannot bring rains but he can help saving the rain. And he begins to illustrate the amazing life brought by technology improvement from the other side of the ocean. With the help of his followers, more and more and people of the clan believe in him. The witch doctor is so angry that he jumps up and down to try to scare people from getting in touch with Zinga. While they are debating, Zinga's wife runs out and shouts to the witch doctor to support her husband. But that violates the taboo of not letting women join the ritual and the witch doctor feels perfectly justified to put Zinga's wife in the basement. Zinga, who tried to protect his wife, is also tied up by the army. They are going to execute both of them the next day. And by the moonlight, Zinga's wife sang miserably to him to show her dismay. Zinga's followers bring him his gun but he refuses it. He determines not to use force to hurt his people but to convince them in other way. Next day the ritual is being held. The witch doctor performs different kinds of tricks, such as fire swallowing to intimidate his people, so that Zinga's followers are afraid to rescue them. Both Zinga and his wife are tied to a wooden pole, waiting to be killed, just as hundreds of years ago, the evil in charge of the island won against the justice. Then the drums for the execution start, and the rhythm starts to sound increasingly familiar to Zinga. It's the Song of Freedom, the secret song passed on by each king of the island. He can‚Äôt help but start singing the Song and sings so well that the crowds turn astonishment to appreciation and admiration. He's the king!! Someone from the crowd shouts out and the people eventually believe he is the king and are willing to listen to him. Zinga wins against the witch doctor at last and achieves his dream. He goes back to America and frequently brings back medicine and technology of all kinds, helping his people to become civilized and educated. At the end of the movie, Zinga picks up his career as a singer again and performs the song he sang a long time ago, \\"Lonely Road\\" on a stage decorated as his little island, referring to his achieving his dream and the help he brought to his people, leading them to a better life. Cast Reception Writing for The Spectator in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a mixed review, describing the direction as \\"distinguished but not above reproach\\" and noting that \\"the story is sentimental and absurd, and yet a sense stays in the memory of an unsophisticated mind fumbling on the edge of simple and popular poetry\\". Greene praises Welch and the singing of Robeson, however he finds that \\"everything goes badly wrong when Zinga reaches Africa\\"‚Äîthe point in the film at which Greene finds the story to lose its believability. (reprinted in: ) Advertised as a \\"$500,000 epic\\" (an above-average sum for a British film in the mid-1930s), Song of Freedom did quite well at the box-office‚Äîexcepting in the southern states of the U.S.A.

It was co-written by Glenn Sudduth and Bill 'Bus' Busby (Sudduth wrote the chorus, Busby later wrote the verses). Its copyright is held by SPEBSQSA (now the Barbershop Harmony Society), as the authors donated the song.  History  Both Sudduth and Busby were members of an a cappella group called the Miamians. The group was having difficulty mastering diction, especially during slow, melodic songs. According to Sudduth, he got so fed up with the director's chiding that he decided to write a song that would require near- perfect diction. One week later, Sudduth returned to the Miamians with the chorus of Creole Cutie. The Miamians adopted Sudduth's song as a warm-up exercise. Busby later asked Sudduth if there were verses to the song he'd written. Sudduth allegedly said \\"There's no verses, but you're welcome to write them.\\" Sudduth and Busby later donated the entire song to the SPEBSQSA collection.  Performance  The song rose to fame thanks to a barbershop group called The Confederates, in which Busby sang baritone. The group shot to fame and success, winning the 1956 International Quartet Championship in Minneapolis, MN just three years after they formed. As Busby was a co-writer of Creole Cutie, the song became a regular feature in their set until they stopped performing in 1969. Creole Cutie is most known as a challenging song that is well known but rarely performed. It is instead used as a warm-up. Because of this usage, it remains one of the most widely known songs within the barbershop community.

The literal translation of this Punjabi word is \\"Humility\\", or \\"Benevolence\\". The other four qualities in the arsenal are: Truth (Sat), Contentment (Santokh), Compassion (Daya) and Love (Pyaar). These five qualities are essential to a Sikh and it is their duty to meditate and recite the Gurbani so that these virtues become a part of their personality. The importance given to Humility in Sikhism can be seen from the following Shabads from Guru Granth Sahib: * The fruit of humility is intuitive peace and pleasure. My True Guru has given me this gift. ((1)(Pause)) (Guru Granth Sahib Page 235 line 10264) * The God-conscious being shall never perish. The God- conscious being is steeped in humility.

(Guru Granth Sahib Page 1245 line 53551) * Humility is the word, forgiveness is the virtue, and sweet speech is the magic mantra. Wear these three robes, O sister, and you will captivate your Husband Lord.

In Sikh vocabulary, the word has a special connotation. It stands for the body of men and women who meet religiously, especially in the presence of the Guru Granth Sahib. It is sometimes analogous to Sat-Sangat (Fellowship of the seekers of truth) and Sadh-Sangat (Congregation of a Sadh or Sant). The word sangat has been in use since the time of Guru Nanak (1469-1539). In his days and those of his nine successors, sangat referred to the Sikh brotherhood established in or belonging to a particular locality. In Sikhism there is a strong push for one to be a part of the Sangat as well as to avoid Ku-Sangat (Undesirable Sangat). Alongside Sangat is also the tradition of Pangat. Use Sangat is used in the Janamsakhis, or traditional life-stories of Guru Nanak, as well as the hukamnamas, or edicts issued by the Gurus to their followers in different parts of the country. In the hukamnamas there are references to Sarbatt Sangat Banaras Ki (i.e. the entire Sikh congregation of Banaras (Varanasi)), Patna ki Sangat (i.e. the Sikhs of Patna) and Dhaul ki Sangat (the Sikhs of Dhaul). In the common and current usage, the word signifies an assembly of the devotees or believers. Such a gathering may be in a gurdwara, in a private residence or in any other place, but in the presence of the Guru Granth Sahib. The purpose is religious prayer, instruction or ceremony. The sangat may collectively chant the sacred hymns, or, as it more often happens, there may be a group of musicians to perform kirtan. At sangat there may be recitals of the holy writ with or without exposition, lectures on religious or theological topics, or narration of events from Sikh history. Social and political matters of interest for the community may as well be discussed. sangat is a Punjabi word it means company. In Sikh faith, the highest merit is assigned to meeting of the followers in sangat. This is considered essential for the spiritual edification and progress of an individual. It is a means of religious and ethical training. Worship and prayer in sangat count for more than isolated religious practice. The holy fellowship is morally elevating. Here the seeker learns to make himself useful to others by engaging in acts of seva, or self- giving service, so highly prized in Sikhism. The seva can take the form of looking after the assembly‚Äôs shoes for all must enter the presence of the Guru Granth Sahib barefoot; preparing and serving food in Guru ka Langar; and relieving the rigour of a hot summer day by swinging over the heads of the devotees large hand-fans. It is in the company of pious men that true religious discipline ripens. Those intent on blessings, bliss, and spiritual advantage must seek it. Guru Nanak Guru Nanak was the first guru. Though sangat has the freedom to discuss secular matters affecting the community, it is its spiritual core which imparts to it the status and authority it commands in the Sikh system. Guru Nanak said, ‚Äúsatsangat is where the Divine Name alone is cherished.‚Äù (GG, 72) This is where virtues are learned. ‚ÄúSatsangat is the Guru‚Äôs own school where one practises godlike qualities.‚Äù (GG, 1316) Attendance at sangat wins one nearness to God and release from the circuit of birth and death. ‚ÄúSitting among sangat one should recite God‚Äôs praise and thereby swim across the impassable ocean of existence.‚Äù (GG, 95) As satsangat is obtained through the Guru‚Äôs grace, the Name blossoms forth in the heart. (GG, 67-68) ‚ÄúAmid sangat abides the Lord God.‚Äù (GG, 94) ‚ÄúGod resides in the sangat. He who comprehends the Guru‚Äôs word realizes this truth. (GG, 1314) ‚ÄúDeprived of sangat, one‚Äôs self remains begrimed.‚Äù (GG, 96) ‚ÄúWithout sans ego will not be dispelled.‚Äù (GG, 1098) Says Guru Arjan in Sukhmani, ‚ÄúHighest among all works is joining the sangat and thereby conquering the evil propensities of the mind.‚Äù (GG, 266) Again, ‚ÄúAs one lost in a thick jungle rediscovers one‚Äôs path, so will one be enlightened in the company of the holy.‚Äù (GG, 282) Sangat, fellowship of the holy, is thus applauded as a means of moral and spiritual uplift; it is as well a social unit which inculcates values of brotherhood, equality and seva. Sangats sprang up in the wake of Guru Nanak‚Äôs extensive travels. Group of disciples formed in different places and met together in sangat to recite his hymns. As an institution, sangat had, with its concomitants dharamsal, where the devotees gathered in the name of Akal, the Timeless Lord, to pray and sing Guru Nanak‚Äôs hymns, and Guru ka Langar, community refectory, where all sat together to partake of a common repast without distinction of caste or status‚Äîsymbolized the new way of life emerging from Guru Nanak's teachings. At the end of his udasis or travels, Guru Nanak settled at Kartarpur, a habitation he had himself founded on the right bank of the River Ravi. There a community of disciples grew around him. It was not a monastic order, but a fellowship of ordinary men engaged in ordinary occupation of life. A key element in this process of restructuring of religious and social life was the spirit of seva. Corporal works of charity and mutual help were undertaken voluntarily and zealously and considered a peculiarly pious duty. To quote Bhai Gurdas: ‚Äúdharamsal kartarpur sadhsangati sach khandu vasaia‚Äù, Varan, XXIV. 11, i.e. in establishing dharamsal at Kartapur, with its sangat or society of the holy, Guru Nanak brought the heaven on earth. Sikh community These sangats played an important role in the evolution of the Sikh community. The social implications of the institutions were far-reaching. It united the Sikhs in a particular locality or region into a brotherhood or fraternity. A member of the sangat, i.e. every Sikh was known as bhai, lit. brother, signifying one of holy living. The sangat brought together men not only in spiritual pursuit but also in worldly affairs, forging community of purpose as well as of action based on mutual equality and brotherhood. Though sangats were spread over widely separated localities, they formed a single entity owning loyalty to the word of Guru Nanak. Sangats were thus the Sikh community in formation. In these sangats the disciples mixed together without considerations of birth, profession or worldly position. Bhai Gurdas, his Var XI, mentions the names of the leading Sikhs of the time of Guru Nanak and his five spiritual successors. In the first 12 stanzas are described the characteristics of a gursikh, or follower of the Guru. In the succeeding stanzas occur the names of some of the prominent Sikhs, in many cases with caste, class or profession of the individual. In some instances, even places they came from are mentioned. In these stanzas, Bhai Gurdas thus provides interesting clues to the composition, socially, of early Sikhism and its spread, geographically. Out of the 19 disciples of Guru Nanak mentioned by Bhai Gurdas, two were Muslims‚ÄîMardana, a mirasi, or bard, from his own village, and Daulat Khan Lodi, an Afghan noble. Bura, celebrated as Bhai Buddha, who was contemporary with the first six Gurus, was a Jatt of Randhava subcaste. So was Ajitta, of Pakkhoke Randhava, in present-day Gurdaspur district. Phirna was a Khaihra Jatt; Malo and Manga were musicians; and Bhagirath, formerly a worshipper of the goddess Kali, was the chaudhari, i.e. revenue official of Malsihan, in Lahore district Of the several Khatri disciples, Mula was of Kir subcaste, Pritha and Kheda were Soinis, Prithi Mall was a Sahigal, Bhagta was Ohri, Japu a Vansi, and Sihan and Gajjan cousins were Uppals. The Sikh sangat was thus the melting-pot for the high and the low, the twice-born and the outcaste. It was a new fraternity emerging as the participants‚Äô response of discipleship to the Guru. Sangats were knit into an organized system by Guru Amar Das who established manjis or preaching districts, each comprising a number of sangats. Guru Arjan appointed masands, community leaders, to look after sangats in different regions. Sangat was the precursor to the Khalsa manifested by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699. That was the highest point in the evolution of the casteless Sikh commonwealth originating in the institution of sangat. Ku-Sangat Encorugaing Sikhs to join the Sangat the Sikh Gurus also taught to avoid the, Ku-Sangat or anti Sangat, the company of egotistical people, slanderers, greedy people, and atheists which all is taught to ultimately lead to degradation.

Its name is a corruption of ak-lowahe, Creek for \\"muddy\\". The historical and original source of the Ocklawaha River is Lake Griffin, part of the Harris chain of lakes in Lake County, Florida. The river now receives discharge from the entire Harris Chain of Lakes, including Lake Eustis, Lake Harris, Lake Dora, Lake Beauclair and Lake Apopka, via a series of man-made canals and natural waterways including Haynes Creek, the Dead River, the Dora Canal, and the Apopka-Beauclair Canal. The addition of the man-made canals has increased both the discharge flow and amount of runoff pollution carried into the river. The Ocklawaha River watershed includes parts of the Green Swamp, most of Lake County, and portions of Marion, Alachua and Putnam counties. The largest of several large lakes in the Ocklawaha's watershed is the badly polluted Lake Apopka near Orlando. The Ocklawaha River is the principal tributary of the St. Johns River. The most important and well-known tributary of the Ocklawaha is the Silver River, which carries the discharge from Silver Springs. Another important tributary of the Ocklawaha is Orange Creek, which originates from Orange Lake, which is fed by Lochloosa Lake via Cross Creek and by Newnans Lake, via the Prairie Creek. From Prairie Creek, only half of its water is artificially diverted towards Orange Lake via the Camps Canal, the rest flows to its historic destination, Paynes Prairie.\\"Orange Creek\\" .

The river was used extensively in the 19th century and early 20th century for steamboat transportation, most famously the Hart Line operated by Hubbard L. Hart. Narrow steamboats were used to navigate the constrictive and winding river. In the 1870s, the route between Palatka and Silver Springs became very popular, and was travelled by prominent figures such as Harriet Beecher Stowe, Ulysses S. Grant, Thomas A. Edison and Mary Todd Lincoln to visit Silver Springs. The scenic trip up the river added a sense of adventure to a visit to Silver Springs. The popularity of the river route to Silver Springs declined after the arrival of railroad service to Ocala in 1881. The river and its source tributaries are navigable for most of their length. The Silver River is easily accessible and very popular with boaters. Orange Creek is navigable for most of its length by canoe. Aids to navigation along the main river and its source tributaries include: * Rodman Reservoir, where the river is impounded at Rodman Dam (later renamed the George Kirkpatrick Dam). The Cross Florida Barge Canal is navigable through the Buckman Lock with elevation changes of 19.2 feet. * The Burrell Lock and Dam on Haynes Creek. * The Dora Canal. * The Apopka-Beauclair Canal. Most non- canoe navigation ends with Lake Apopka. The river has suffered severe ecological damage in the 20th century from impoundment, fertilizer runoff, dredging, pollution and rerouting. In the 1960s and 1970s, Marjorie Harris Carr led the successful campaign to stop construction of the Cross Florida Barge Canal, which would have dammed the river at two points and created two artificial reservoirs to facilitate navigation along the canal; however, the river is still blocked by Rodman Dam. Florida Defenders of the Environment (FDE), which Carr co-founded in 1969, continues to push for the preservation and restoration of the Ocklawaha River. The river is a popular place to canoe, kayak and fish. The river forms the western boundary of the Ocala National Forest. Portions of the river remain mostly undisturbed by man. The natural landscapes and lush wildlife and growth of the outlying area are mostly hydric hammocks and flatwoods, with scrub pine ridges and sugar sandy soils. Wildlife is abundant, including wild turkey, white-tailed deer, and wading birds in this area. Outdoor recreational activities include hunting, fishing, wildlife viewing, hiking, horseback riding, and paddling, although there are few established trails. The Gores Landing unit of Ocklawaha River WMA consists of almost 3,000 acres (12 km¬≤) along the Ocklawaha River in eastern Marion County. The Ocklawaha River basin is a primary tributary of the St. Johns River Water Management District.

It is a listener supported/commercial radio station owned by the Pillar of Fire International. The station's target demographic is 25- to 54-year-olds. The Class B, 28,000-watt signal based in Bridgewater, New Jersey serves the New York City market along with northern and central New Jersey. The call letters for the station, like its AM counterpart which went off the air in 1984, were chosen to honor Bishop Alma White, who was the founder of the Pillar of Fire Church and Zarephath, the community of license. WAWZ began airing its current format as Star 99.1 on February 3, 2003. Its original format was traditional and classical music and church services. In later years inspirational contemporary Christian music and mostly syndicated Christian teaching and talk shows were added. In this format its tagline was WAWZ - Your Voice of Faith and Inspiration. In 2017, WAWZ updated their slogan to \\"Uplifting Star 99.1\\" influenced by the overwhelming response of their listeners who expressed how uplifting their music was for them. History The Old WAWZ-FM Logo WAWZ was founded in 1931The Founding and Operation of WAWZ Radio, V. Capolunghi, Masters Thesis, Kean University, 1977 by Bishop Alma White and the Pillar of Fire Church. Formerly headquartered in Denver, Colorado, the organization was given land in 1906, in Franklin Township, Somerset County, New Jersey. The station was first assigned a frequency on 1350 AM, sharing time equally with three other stations, WCDA, WBNX and WMSG. In later years, on 1380 AM, it shared time with WBNX in New York City. WAWZ was the second station owned by the Pillar of Fire Church. (KPOF in Denver was the first). On September 1, 1984, WAWZ sold its part-time AM operation to New York station WBNX (now christened WKDM.) On WAWZ's final day, they produced a special program recalling the station's 53 years of religious broadcasting, and by electrical transcription, once again featured the voice of Alma White.http://www.angelfire.com/nj2/piratejim/njamhistory8.html The station began broadcasting on FM on August 22, 1954.http://www.angelfire.com/nj2/piratejim/njfmhistory6.html The broadcast format was eighteen hours a day of classical music along with Pillar of Fire church services. By the late 1960s, WAWZ evolved into a Traditional Christian Music and Teaching station. They played traditional Christian music about 6 to 8 hours a day. The rest of the time they ran teaching and preaching programs by various Christian groups. They did not sell time in a traditional way but took a percentage of donations each ministry received from WAWZ's listening area. Overall, the format was similar to what Family Radio and BBN offered back then as well as being musically close. In 1980, there was a challenge to its license. The challenge alleged that the station did not serve the public good. Allen Lewis was hired as the new program director and it became a 24-hour station. For many years WAWZ carried teaching programs, talk shows, church services, and traditional Christian music. The station ran the tagline, WAWZ-Your Voice of Faith and Inspiration and featured mostly syndicated evangelical Christian teaching and talk shows and inspirational music. Local news, AP World News, public affairs programs and several call-in shows added a New Jersey feel to the station as it attempted to serve its license area it had just vigorously defended. Most of the schedule consisted of programming came from area church services and outside ministries via the state-of-the-art Chicago-based Moody Broadcasting Service satellite subscription. Among these was a local program called Search Light which served tri-state area prison inmates. The station ran Share-a-thons twice a year to solicit support from listeners. During the 1980s, WAWZ began moving from a conservative format of traditional hymns to more of a Christian MOR format which included softer music by contemporary Christian artists as well as the traditional music they were playing. By 1990 the music mix was about half traditional and half contemporary. By 1994 the music format was nearly all contemporary. However, the majority of the schedule consisted of non-musical programming. Major changes began on Thanksgiving Day in 2002, WAWZ began playing wall-to-wall traditional and contemporary as well as secular Christmas music. After Christmas, the station started airing hot adult contemporary Christian music with non-musical elements reduced to four hours per day. Finally on February 2, 2003, WAWZ renamed itself STAR 99.1. The station also began selling time to commercial advertisers, but as it remains owned by a 501C3 they continue to have an annual \\"Radiothon\\". But it has continued its all Christmas format since 2002. Playing mostly Christian themed holiday music. WAWZ's signal is among the strongest in NJ and can be heard through all of Central and Northern New Jersey and New York City and as far south as Ocean and Burlington counties as well as Eastern Pennsylvania. With its polished family-friendly contemporary sound, Star 99.1 aims its programming at Christians and nonbelievers alike.https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/11/nyregion/how-one-radio- station-made-the-conversion.html The National Religious Broadcasters honored WAWZ with Station of the Year awards in 2007 and 2008 and the National Association of Broadcasters honored them with the 2008 Crystal Radio Award for community service. On August 1, 2014 Pillar of Fire began a lease of WLIR-FM. WAWZ-FM, Zarephath, New Jersey (STAR 99.1) was broadcast on WLIR-FM as well as its translators as STAR 107.1. The lease ended in April 2015 and WLIR-FM reverted to the Christian formatted \\"Hope Radio\\" until early 2015 when the station was sold.  HD radio  WAWZ broadcasts in HD Radio with both its HD1, HD2, and HD3 channels providing Artist Experience data including song titles, artists, and albums on compatible radios. Over the years, 99.1 FM has hosted a variety of formats on its HD sub-channels. The current HD sub-channel formats are: * HD2 - Gospel songs (replaced Christian teaching subchannel in early 2016) * HD3 - The Energy (Christian Rock / Hip Hop) (Launched in 2007 launched to coincide with the station-sponsored annual youth festival, Autumn Blaze 2007). The Energy ceased transmissions in 2014 but resumed in early 2015. = Previous sub-channels = * HD2 - Christian teaching (The eight-hour block of teaching programs, signing on first in April 2006, resembled the station's mid-1990s format, including the use of the former tagline, WAWZ-Your Voice of Faith and Inspiration.)

While he has had many chances to play for the Leafs in the NHL, arguably outperforming Maple Leaf back-up Mikael Tellqvist during the 2005 training camp, he has still been relegated to the Marlies. Originally sharing the starting role with the Marlies with Tellqvist, the departure of Trevor Kidd as the prime back-up spot on the Leafs earned Tellqvist a promotion, with Racine earning the starting spot.

It was established in 2001 to contest elections to Derwentside District Council, later contesting elections to Durham County Council following the establishment of a unitary authority in 2013.  Background  Founded by former Councillor Bill Stockdale, the party benefited from the lack of organised opposition to the Labour Party from the main national political parties in Derwentside. Other officers are Ronald Weightman, nominating officer, and John Jopling, treasurer. According to its 2007 accounts, the party had 23 elected members and 22 general members. However, as of 2012 this was reduced to 9 Elected Members and 22 general members. The party describes itself as an association of like-minded people who formed a party participating in local governance without any specific particular political bias. Each member has their own politics personal but chooses not to reveal that to an elector.  Election results  = District Council elections = The party increased in strength following the 2003 local elections, gaining eight seats from the Labour Party in west and south Derwentside. At the final election to Derwentside District Council in 2007, the party gained a further 10 seats, bringing its total to 24 and reducing Labour's majority to three. = County Council elections = In March 2008, after feeling the Derwentside Independents could not offer a county-wide alternative to Labour, Councillor Bob Cook resigned from their ranks and joined the Liberal Democrats. He lost his seat at the subsequent local elections. A rival Durham County Council Independent Group led by John Shuttleworth formed in 2008. Following the 2013 elections, the Derwentside Independents Party had 8 councillors on the unitary Durham County Council. Their representation had fallen to 7 councilors by 2016. The party is part of one of two groups of independents on the county council, and forms part of the opposition to the ruling Labour Party. = UK Parliament elections = Its leader, councillor Watts Stelling, contested the 2005 general election in the constituency of North West Durham.

It is an interval in the domain of a posterior probability distribution or a predictive distribution.Edwards, Ward, Lindman, Harold, Savage, Leonard J. (1963) \\"Bayesian statistical inference in psychological research\\". Psychological Review, 70, 193-242 The generalisation to multivariate problems is the credible region. Credible intervals are analogous to confidence intervals in frequentist statistics,Lee, P.M. (1997) Bayesian Statistics: An Introduction, Arnold. although they differ on a philosophical basis: Bayesian intervals treat their bounds as fixed and the estimated parameter as a random variable, whereas frequentist confidence intervals treat their bounds as random variables and the parameter as a fixed value. Also, Bayesian credible intervals use (and indeed, require) knowledge of the situation-specific prior distribution, while the frequentist confidence intervals do not. For example, in an experiment that determines the distribution of possible values of the parameter \\\\mu, if the subjective probability that \\\\mu lies between 35 and 45 is 0.95, then 35 \\\\le \\\\mu \\\\le 45 is a 95% credible interval. Choosing a credible interval Credible intervals are not unique on a posterior distribution. Methods for defining a suitable credible interval include: *Choosing the narrowest interval, which for a unimodal distribution will involve choosing those values of highest probability density including the mode (the maximum a posteriori). This is sometimes called the highest posterior density interval (HPDI). *Choosing the interval where the probability of being below the interval is as likely as being above it. This interval will include the median. This is sometimes called the equal-tailed interval. *Assuming that the mean exists, choosing the interval for which the mean is the central point. It is possible to frame the choice of a credible interval within decision theory and, in that context, an optimal interval will always be a highest probability density set.O'Hagan, A. (1994) Kendall's Advanced Theory of Statistics, Vol 2B, Bayesian Inference, Section 2.51. Arnold, Contrasts with confidence interval A frequentist 95% confidence interval means that with a large number of repeated samples, 95% of such calculated confidence intervals would include the true value of the parameter. In frequentist terms, the parameter is fixed (cannot be considered to have a distribution of possible values) and the confidence interval is random (as it depends on the random sample). Bayesian credible intervals can be quite different from frequentist confidence intervals for two reasons: *credible intervals incorporate problem-specific contextual information from the prior distribution whereas confidence intervals are based only on the data; *credible intervals and confidence intervals treat nuisance parameters in radically different ways. For the case of a single parameter and data that can be summarised in a single sufficient statistic, it can be shown that the credible interval and the confidence interval will coincide if the unknown parameter is a location parameter (i.e. the forward probability function has the form \\\\mathrm{Pr}(x\\\\mu) = f(x - \\\\mu) ), with a prior that is a uniform flat distribution;Jaynes, E. T. (1976). \\"Confidence Intervals vs Bayesian Intervals\\", in Foundations of Probability Theory, Statistical Inference, and Statistical Theories of Science, (W. L. Harper and C. A. Hooker, eds.), Dordrecht: D. Reidel, pp. 175 et seq and also if the unknown parameter is a scale parameter (i.e. the forward probability function has the form \\\\mathrm{Pr}(xs) = f(x/s) ), with a Jeffreys' prior \\\\mathrm{Pr}(sI) \\\\;\\\\propto\\\\; 1/s ‚Äî the latter following because taking the logarithm of such a scale parameter turns it into a location parameter with a uniform distribution. But these are distinctly special (albeit important) cases; in general no such equivalence can be made.

Born in Gorbals, Glasgow, the son of engine driver Thomas Honeyman (1858-1934) and Elspeth Smith (1860-1937), Tom Honeyman studied medicine at Glasgow prior to service in the trenches during the First World War. He practised medicine in the East End of Glasgow, before moving to London to become an art dealer at the Lefevre Gallery. In London he met many great artists and when the Glasgow Corporation were looking for a new Director for their Kelvingrove Art Gallery they consulted Honeyman who eventually decided he might like the job. Taking up the post in 1939, he went on to make an enormous contribution to artistic and cultural life of Glasgow during his 15 years in the post. He greatly increased the profile of the Glasgow Art Galleries through clever publicity and successful exhibitions which, for example, brought queues to see Van Gogh's paintings. His art purchases were prudent and wise, buying works which have subsequently gained enormously in value. In 1952, Honeyman became famous for his purchase of Salvador Dal√≠'s Christ of St. John of the Cross. A controversial purchase at the time, both because of its exceptional cost (¬£8,200) and contemporary style, it hung for many years in the Kelvingrove where it still hangs. It is one of the jewels of the city's art collection and has proven commercially remunerative, with displays and reproduction fees covering the original cost several times over. His reputation was such that he was able to attract several major gifts to the gallery, including that of Sir William Burrell (1861-1958) in 1944. Yet, Honeyman was forced to leave his post in 1954 having lost the support of his political master, the new chairman of the Glasgow Corporation Art Committee. Passionate about the cultural life of Glasgow, Honeyman, with assistance from James Bridie, also founded the Glasgow Citizen's Theatre. He was also involved in setting up the Scottish Tourist Board. Honeyman wrote an autobiographical book, largely memoirs of his time as Director of the Art Gallery, called Art and Audacity (Collins, 1971). Honeyman was the recipient of the 1943 St Mungo Prize, awarded to the individual who has done most in the previous three years to improve and promote the city of Glasgow.

The term outlines one of the most important of Sikh principles and is a point that is repeated in the Sikh Scriptures. The Sikh concept of sarbat da bhala which means \\"blessings for everyone\\" or literally \\"may everyone prosper\\". This statement is repeated by all practising Sikhs at least twice daily as part of their Nitnem (daily prayers). This concept is central to Sikhism and forms a very important and essential role in the religious philosophy of the Sikh Gurus. The Ardas ends with the line: To put this in very concise and clear language, the term invokes the Sikh to request, pray and ask the Almighty for the well-being of all of humanity, prosperity for everyone in the worldwide community, global peace for the entire planet. A Sikh selflessly prays daily for \\"all to prosper\\"'. This gesture comes from the clear and pure teaching of Gurbani (Sri Guru Granth Sahib) and forms the Gurmat code of conduct. Gurbani tells us that there are \\"no others\\", \\"there is only One\\". The same \\"One God resides within all\\". We are \\"all the children of that One God\\". As the potter makes pots of different forms and colors from the same basic clay; and as the goldsmith moulds jewellery of various types, colors and shapes from the same single homogeneous material, gold; similarly, we are all born of the same One Light: \\"There is no difference\\". Accordingly, by instruction from the Gurus, the true Sikh begs for \\"the good for all beings\\" of the world.

Art was already embedded in his family life before he went to college, his father created paintings and drawings on religious themes, his mother made quilts and baskets, and his grandfather was a sculptor. Driskell attended Howard University in Washington, D.C., graduating with a bachelor's degree in art in 1955. He started off studying painting and history until meeting James A. Porter, acclaimed African-American art historian who took him under his wing and encouraged him to study art history. He was influenced by James V. Herring, another of his professors at Howard, and Mary Beattie Brady, the director of the Harmon Foundation, an organization that collected work by African Americans. Driskell would continue to work closely with Brady throughout his early career. In 1952 he married his wife Thelma Grace DeLoatch.

In 1966 he joined the faculty of Fisk University in Nashville, as professor of art and chairman of the department. During his time at Fisk, Driskell curated a number of shows highlighting black artists including Aaron Douglas, William T. Williams and Ellis Wilson. He was a rigorous scholar and due to his careful cataloging of African American works he began creating the archive and context for research into black art. After ten years at Fisk, he moved to the University of Maryland, College Park, in 1976. He chaired the department there from 1978 to 1983 and, in 1995, was named Distinguished University Professor of Art. Driskell retired from the University of Maryland in 1998. In 2001, he was honored with the naming of the David C. Driskell Center for the Study of Visual Arts and Culture of African Americans and the African Diaspora, which presents exhibitions on African American art and holds the Driskell archive . Driskell had a long relationship with the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture which began in 1953, the year he attended as a participant of the program. He was invited back as faculty in 1976, 1978, 1991, and 2004. He served on the Board of Governors from 1975-1989 and on the Board of Trustees from 1989-2001.

He curated over 35 exhibitions of work by black artists, including Jacob Lawrence, Romare Bearden, and Elizabeth Catlett. In 1976, Driskell mounted Two Centuries of Black American Art for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which was the highest-profile exhibition of its kind at a major U.S. museum, and according to ARTnews, \\"staked a claim for the profound and indelible contributions of black and African American art makers since the earliest days of the country.\\" This landmark exhibition later traveled to the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, and the Brooklyn Museum. The exhibition featured more than 200 works by 63 artists as well as anonymous crafts workers and cemented the essential contributions of Black artists to American Visual culture. Driskell's art collection has traveled to museums nationwide and includes work ranging from African tribal objects to contemporary works of art and \\"reflect the history of the black American experience\\". In 2000, about 100 works from his collection were presented at the High Museum of Art in an exhibition titled Narratives of African American Art and Identity: The David C. Driskell Collection. Driskell has advised notable figures including Oprah Winfrey and Bill Cosby on their art collections. He also selected works that appeared on The Cosby Show, and later wrote a book about the Cosby's collection \\"The Other Side of Color: The African American Collection of Camille O. and William H. Cosby, Jr.\\" In 1996 Driskell advised the White House on its purchase of Sand Dunes at Sunset: Atlantic City (1885) by Henry Ossawaa Tanner. It became the first artwork in the White House's collection by a Black artist. = Artistic Career = Driskell created works of art including painting, drawing, collage and printmaking, often combining them in the creation of mixed media work. His work is challenging to categorize due to the diversity of his artistic practice, having worked both abstractly and figuratively, and utilizing a wide range of materials including oil paint, acrylic, egg tempera, gouache, ink, marker, and collage, on paper and both stretched and unstretched canvas. The subject matter of his work ranges from portraits of jazz singers, African gods and rituals, urban life, to landscapes around his summer home in Maine. His work can be read in relationship to the Black Arts movement and Afrocentrism, but also reveals his engagement with art of various styles and time periods. His oeuvre reflects, \\"his openness to the times he is living in and his immediate circumstances, whether in his neighborhood or in nature,\\" John Yao writes for Hyperallergic on the occasion of his 2019 solo exhibition at DC Moore Gallery.

According to Gaudapada, the Absolute is not subject to birth, change and death. The Absolute is aja, the unborn eternal. The empirical world of appearances is considered unreal, and not absolutely existent. Gaudapada's perspective is based on the Mandukya Upanishad, applying the philosophical concept of \\"ajƒÅta\\" to the inquiry of Brahman, showing that Brahman wholly transcends the conventional understanding of being and becoming. The concept is also found in Madhyamaka Buddhism, as the theory of nonorigination. Etymology AjƒÅtivƒÅda: * \\"A\\" means \\"not\\", or \\"non\\" as in Ahimsa, non-harm * \\"JƒÅti\\" means \\"birth,\\" \\"creation\\" or \\"origination; it may refer to physical birth, but also to the arising of mental phenomena * \\"VƒÅda\\" means \\"doctrine\\" Taken together \\"ajƒÅtivƒÅda\\" means \\"the Doctrine of no- origination\\" or non-creation. The concept of \\"ajƒÅta\\" was borrowed by Gaudapada from Madhyamika Buddhism, which uses the term \\"anutpƒÅda\\": * \\"An\\" also means \\"not\\", or \\"non\\" * \\"UtpƒÅda\\" means \\"genesis\\", \\"coming forth\\", \\"birth\\" Taken together \\"anutpƒÅda\\" means \\"having no origin\\", \\"not coming into existence\\", \\"not taking effect\\", \\"non-production\\".Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, AnutpƒÅda Usage =Gaudapada= \\"AjƒÅtivƒÅda\\" is the fundamental philosophical doctrine of Gaudapada. According to Gaudapada, the Absolute is not subject to birth, change and death. The Absolute is aja, the unborn eternal. The empirical world of appearances is considered Maya (unreal as it is transitory), and not absolutely existent. Gaudapada borrowed the concept of \\"ajƒÅta\\" from Nagajurna's Madhyamaka philosophy. The Buddhist tradition usually uses the term anutpƒÅda for the absence of an origin or ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ. Yet, according to Comans, Gaudapada's perspective is quite different from Nagarjuna. Gaudapada's perspective is based on the Mandukya Upanishad. In the Mandukya Karika, Gaudapada's commentary on the Mandukya Upanishad, Gaudapada sets forth his perspective. According to Gaudapada, Brahman cannot undergo alteration, so the phenomenal world cannot arise independently from Brahman. If the world cannot arise, yet is an empirical fact, then the world has to be an unreal (transitory) appearance of Brahman. And if the phenomenal world is a transitory appearance, then there is no real origination or destruction, only apparent origination or destruction. From the level of ultimate truth (paramƒÅrthatƒÅ) the phenomenal world is mƒÅyƒÅ, \\"illusion\\", apparently existing but ultimately not real. In Gaudapada-Karika, chapter III, verses 46-48, he states that the quietened mind becomes one with Brahman and does not perceive of any origination: Acknowledgeing the strong Buddhist influences, but arguing for the need of an \\"unchangeable permanent reality,\\" Karmakar opinions that the ajativada of Gaudhapada has nothing in common with the Sunyavada concept in Buddhism.RD Karmarkar, Gaudapada's Karika, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages xxxix-xl While the language of Gaudapada is undeniably similar to those found in Mahayana Buddhism, Coman states that their perspective is different because unlike Buddhism, Gaudapada is relying on the premise of \\"Brahman, Atman or Turiya\\" exist and are the nature of absolute reality. =Ramana Maharshi= Ramana Maharshi gave a translation in Tamil of Gaudapada‚Äôs Mandukya Upanishad Karika, chapter two, verse thirty-two: According to David Godman, the ajata doctrine implies that since the world was never created, there are also no jivas within it who are striving for or attaining liberation. Ramana Maharshi regarded this as \\"the ultimate truth.\\" Levels of truth Advaita took over from the Madhyamika the idea of levels of reality. Usually two levels are being mentioned, namely sa·πÉv·πõti-satya, \\"the empirical truth\\",Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, sa·πÉv·πõti-satya and paramƒÅrtha-satya, \\"ultimate truth\\". According to Plott, The distinction between the two truths (satyadvayavibhƒÅga) was fully expressed by the Madhyamaka-school. In NƒÅgƒÅrjuna's M≈´lamadhyamakakƒÅrikƒÅ it is used to defend the identification of dependent origination (pratƒ´tyasamutpƒÅda) with emptiness (≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ): Shankara uses sublation as the criterion to postulate an ontological hierarchy of three levels:advaita-vision.org, Discrimination # (paramartha, absolute), the absolute level, \\"which is absolutely real and into which both other reality levels can be resolved\\". This experience can't be sublated by any other experience. # (vyavahara), or samvriti-saya (empirical or pragmatical), \\"our world of experience, the phenomenal world that we handle every day when we are awake\\". It is the level in which both jiva (living creatures or individual souls) and Iswara are true; here, the material world is also true. # (pratibhasika, apparent reality, unreality), \\"reality based on imagination alone\\". It is the level in which appearances are actually false, like the illusion of a snake over a rope, or a dream. It is at the level of the highest truth (paramƒÅrtha) that there is no origination. Gaudapada states that, from the absolute standpoint, not even \\"non-dual\\" exists. Advaita Vedanta and Madhyamaka Buddhism Many scholars, states Richard King, designate Madhyamaka Buddhism as Ajativada. The concept Ajati, he adds, exists in both Vedanta and Buddhism, but they are different in the following way: Ajativada in Madhyamaka refers to its doctrine that things neither originate nor is there cessation. This is also called the theory of non-origination of Madhyamaka.

He designed at least 18 original planes, some conversions of landplanes to seaplanes - and a parachute. The amphibious Fizir A.F.2 from 1931 Fizir was born in Ludbreg, a small town on the river Bednja, in the north of Croatia. In 1914, whilst still a senior student, he was offered his first job in Schwerin, where he worked in the construction of fighter aircraft for the German Fliegerkorps in the new Fokker-Flugzeugbau factory. From there he was sent to Budapest, in order to find and organize a Fokker subsidiary. Between 1918 and 1920, Fizir was employed in the automobile industry, where he gathered experience with internal combustion engines. In 1920 he returned to Ludbreg, and then moved to Petrovaradin. There he started to build his aircraft designs in his yard, at his own expense. Fizir FN on display in the Museum of Aviation in Belgrade With a biplane, which Fizir built in 1925, he won the first prize in the 1927 Little Entente contest, despite having an engine with only half the power of other competing designs. Other aircraft he produced were named after the engines used, such as the Fizir-Mercedes, Fizir-Wright, Fizir-Titan, Fizir-Kastor, Fizir-Gypsi, and the half-metallic Fizir-Jupiter. His successful designs, almost all wooden, were economic to produce, reflecting the low economic power of the pre-World War II Kingdom of Yugoslavia, wartime Croatia (Independent State of Croatia) and post-World War II Yugoslavia, and were highly regarded in Germany and France throughout the 1930s, 40s and 50s. He had a strong affiliation for trainers and seaplanes, having a vision of connecting the Adriatic islands with a regular seaplane service. His greatest success was the Fizir FN two-seater with dual controls, over 100 of which were built, which was in use as a trainer up to 30 years after World War II. Rudolf Fizir was awarded with the Paul Tissandier Diploma from the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale for achievements in aviation, and held the rank of (colonel) in the Croatian Battle Air Force. After World War II, Fizir worked as a motorcycle designer, and continued with aircraft construction in his retirement years. The road leading to Zagreb Airport was named in his honour.

His works tend to play heavily with opposite notions, such as love and death, platonism and sarcasm, sentimentalism and pessimism, among others, and have a strong influence of Musset, Chateaubriand, Lamartine, Goethe and ‚Äì above all ‚Äì Byron. All of his works were published posthumously due to his premature death with only 20 years old after a horse-riding accident. They acquired a strong cult following as years went by, particularly among youths of the goth subculture. He is the patron of the second chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters, and of the ninth chair of the Paulista Academy of Letters. Biography Azevedo was born into a wealthy family in S√£o Paulo, on September 12, 1831. Son of Law student In√°cio Manuel √Ålvares de Azevedo and Maria Lu√≠sa Azevedo (n√©e Mota), a popular myth says that he was given birth in the library of the University of S√£o Paulo Law School, but it actually happened on the house of his maternal grandfather, Severo Mota.√Ålvares de Azevedo ‚Äì Academia Brasileira de Letras He also had a sister and a younger brother, In√°cio Manuel J√∫nior, but he died prematurely in 1835. The death proved to be an early source of shock for the young √Ålvares. In 1833, √Ålvares moved with his family to Rio de Janeiro, and in 1840 he enrolled at the Col√©gio Stoll, in the bairro of Botafogo. In 1844 he temporarily returned to S√£o Paulo with his uncle, going back to Rio in the following year, where he enrolled at the Col√©gio Pedro II. There he learned English, French and German, and, being a very avid reader, got acquainted with the works of Lord Byron, Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand, Victor Hugo, George Sand, William Shakespeare, John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Manuel du Bocage, Dante Alighieri, Alfred de Musset, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Alphonse de Lamartine and Thomas Chatterton, which would heavily influence his writing style. While at school, Azevedo drifted towards the moderate liberalism of Lamartine and Fran√ßois Guizot. In his poem \\"Rex Lugebit\\" and in his \\"Speech delivered at the inaugural session of the Academy Society - Philosophical Essay, May 9, 1850\\", Azevedo condemns the despotic practices of the Brazilian government. Having graduated in 1846 from the Col√©gio Pedro II, he was admitted to the University of S√£o Paulo Law School in the following year, where he befriended poets Jos√© Bonif√°cio the Younger (the grandnephew of famous Brazilian statesman Jos√© Bonif√°cio de Andrada e Silva), Aureliano Lessa and Bernardo Guimar√£es. Alongside these poets and others, he founded the infamous \\"Sociedade Epicureia\\" (\\"Epicurean Society\\"), a mythical club heavily based upon Epicurean and bohemian thought, and also planned a work in conjunction with Lessa and Guimar√£es, the poetry book As Tr√™s Liras (The Three Lyres). However, the As Tr√™s Liras project never came to be; the only surviving part of it today is the book Lira dos Vinte Anos, published one year after Azevedo's death, in 1853. He also founded in 1849 the official magazine of the Sociedade Ensaio Filos√≥fico Paulistano, whose publication ceased in 1856. Because of his fragile health and the murky weather of S√£o Paulo, Azevedo contracted tuberculosis. He then abandoned college and moved to his grandfather's farm in Rio, where the weather was warmer, in order to mitigate his disease's symptoms; there he fell from a horse and fractured his iliac fossa. After an unsuccessful surgery, he died, on April 25, 1852, being only 20 years old. He was buried one day later at the Saint John the Baptist Cemetery; his last words before his death were reported to be \\"Que fatalidade, meu pai!\\" (\\"What a fatality, my father!\\"). Coincidentally, one of the last poems Azevedo wrote prior to his death was entitled \\"Se Eu Morresse Amanh√£\\" (\\"If I Died Tomorrow\\") ‚Äì the poem was read at his funeral by Manuel Ant√¥nio de Almeida, who also happened to be one of Azevedo's cousins. Another one of Azevedo's cousins, Maria Catarina de Abreu Sodr√©, eventually married famous novelist Joaquim Manuel de Macedo, who allegedly based the character Carolina of his novel A Moreninha on her.

It peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart and Irish Singles Chart in December 2005. In July 2006 the song became a moderate hit in Australia, reaching number 43 on the ARIA Singles Chart. As Nizlopi failed to earn any more significant hits after \\"JCB\\", they became a one-hit wonder. Lyrics The song is a reminiscence of childhood, based on singer Luke Concannon's memories; it is sung from the point of view of a young boy, travelling with his father on his JCB digger, listening to Christy Moore's song \\"Don't Forget Your Shovel\\". The song's lyrics refer to Luke's dyslexia; the resulting bullying; and characters such as B. A. Baracus, Bruce Lee, and Transformers, who would protect him against the bullies. The bypass mentioned in the song is the A46, as the band lived in Leamington Spa at the time and the A46 is known locally as \\"The Bypass\\". Release The single was originally released in the United Kingdom in June 2005, when it entered the charts at number 160. Following its release, the song gradually achieved a cult following on the Internet and at film festivals, in part due to the award-winning animated video by Laith Bahrani of Monkeehub. Mainstream coverage and airplay followed, and by 19 November, national newspapers were writing about the song's rise, and possible destiny as Christmas number one. The song entered the UK Singles Chart at number one in the week before Christmas but was pushed into second place on the Christmas charts by X Factor singer Shayne Ward. Both songs continued to hold their positions for the next four weeks. In Ireland, the song also reached number one the week before Christmas but lost the top position to a cover of Will Young's song \\"Leave Right Now\\" by Mario Rosenstock on Christmas week. It then returned to the top spot the week after, its last week at number one. The song stayed on the Irish chart for 16 more weeks. In Australia, \\"JCB\\" experienced moderate success, debuting at number 45 on 2 July 2006 and peaking at number 43 the next week. It then left the top 50. The standard single features the new B-side \\"Clear\\". The enhanced CD has a second new track \\"Helen\\", plus the JCB video. The hit record was produced by Gavin Monaghan, also known for his work with Scott Matthews, Robert Plant, Editors, Ocean Colour Scene, The Twang and The Holloways. Critical reception Bob Stanley of The Guardian retrospectively panned the song as one of the worst number one singles of the 2000s, commenting: \\"You wait for the punchline on Nizlopi's JCB Song before realising, to your horror, that the weedy singing and naive lyric is not a Hoxton parody of outsider art but is meant to signify sincerity.\\" He dismissed the song as resembling an attempt by Carter USM to write a ballad.

He is famous for creating the \\"Condorism\\" and revolutionizing Brazilian Romanticism and poetry. He is patron of the 38th chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters. Life Barreto was born in Vila de Campos do Rio Real (renamed \\"Tobias Barreto\\" in his honor in 1909), a town in the southern part of Sergipe. He learnt his first letters with Manuel Joaquim de Oliveira Campos, and he also studied Latin with priest Domingos Quirino. Barreto was so dedicated to the course that, in the future, he would become a Latin professor in Itabaiana. In 1861 he left for Bahia in order to attend a seminary; however, having soon realized that it was not his vocation, he quit. Between 1864 and 1865 he became a private tutor in many subjects. He also tried to become a Latin (and later Philosophy) teacher at the Gin√°sio Pernambucano, but was not successful at the institution. Barreto was an enthusiast of the German culture, such an interest being induced by the reading of Ernst Haeckel and Ludwig B√ºchner. Following Haeckel, he was a noted early Darwinian in Brazil. For this reason he established a German language- newspaper, Der Deutsche K√§mpfer (German for The German Fighter). It was short- lived and had little influence. Moving away to Escada, he married a colonel's daughter. He spent ten years there before returning to Recife. He died there in 1889 at a friend's house.

It takes place in hill towns of the Pays de Fayence between Nice and Aix-en-Provence in the South of France during the first two weeks of August. The festival features over 18 concerts including major choral and orchestral works, chamber ensembles, free lunchtime concerts and late night recitals in churches, chapels and in the open air. In a spirit of entente cordiale, the festival draws together people of all ages and from many countries and is designed to encourage intercultural friendship and understanding through a shared involvement in music-making. A collection of over 125 singers and players, ranging in age from 15 to 75, are assembled each year for a series of rehearsals and concerts. The 15th annual Musique Cordiale Festival took place from 5 - 17 August 2019. and there is a British offshoot, the Musique-Cordiale autumn weekend in Kent, also begun in 2005, which features 3 concerts in Faversham and Newnham, Kent, GB on 15, 16 & 17 November 2019. Artistic Director, Pippa Pawlik, studied the violin at the Royal College of Music in London and played professionally in London and Switzerland. With two young children, she then changed direction and worked in music promotion with record companies, international orchestras, festivals and artists from all over the world. Pippa now lives and works in Kent, having relaunched her PR business with clients in America, Germany and the UK. She also acts as a mentor, offering musicians career guidance, inspiration and brainstorming strategies. Om 5 May 2020, it was announced that, after 15 uninterrupted years of annual summer festivals, Musique Cordiale has had to CANCEL the 16th INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL, scheduled for 1-16 August 2020, because the COVID-19 situation in Europe - or at least a postponement till 2021 if that is possible. Choir & Orchestra MC Academy 2016 Concert in Bagnols-en-Foret, FranceOpera in the Open Air A choral tradition remains an integral part of Musique Cordiale and a major work for choir closes the festival each year. The choir is made up of excellent amateur and professional singers from ensembles including The Bach Choir, the London Symphony Chorus, Groupe Vocal Arp√®ge de Bordeaux and the Ensemble Equinox. The Festival Orchestra is a multi-generational ensemble made up of young professionals and established musicians from orchestras including the San Francisco Symphony, LSO, the OAE, the Tonhalle Zurich and the Oslo Philharmonic. Musique Cordiale acts as a platform for burgeoning soloists and orchestral players, offering them an opportunity to learn and perform works which they will later play on the international stage. Its Academy offers 6-8 talented players aged 15 - 19 the chance to study and play with professionals. Each year, Pippa invites accomplished conductors to direct the orchestra and the choir. The idyllic surroundings of the Pays de Fayence provide a unique setting for these musicians and singers to perform together in an informal, Proven√ßal environment. James Lowe, Chief Conductor of the Prussian Chamber Orchestra, Germany, and the Vaasa Sinfonia, Finland conducts and newly- appointed music director of the Spokane Symphony, conducting the Festival Orchestra and Graham Ross, Director of Music at Clare College Cambridge, conducting the Festival Choir and orchestra, both with imprssive line-ups of (mostly) young uo-and-coming soloists and musicians. Previous conductors include Tom Seligman, Errol Girdlestone, Tomas Netopil and Kevin Griffiths. Since 2005, performances have included Mozart‚Äôs C minor Mass and Requiem, Durufl√©‚Äôs Requiem, Bach‚Äôs Magnificat and B Minor Mass, Haydn‚Äôs Te Deum and Nelson Mass, Handel‚Äôs Dixit Dominus and Solomon, Dvorak‚Äôs Stabat Mater, The Monteverdi Vespers, Hayn's Seasons, The Messiah and Faur√©‚Äôs Requiem. 2019 featured a performance of Handel's Saul. Operas staged include Purcell‚Äôs Dido & Aeneas, Mozart‚Äôs Marriage of Figaro and Cosi fan Tutte, Puccini‚Äôs La Boh√®me and Rossini‚Äôs Barber of Seville.

Commissions and winter concerts Works specially commissioned for Musique-Cordiale and premiered at the festival in recent years include pieces by Graham Ross and Cecilia McDowall. In 2005 and 2016, Musique-Cordiale featured in a weekend of choral and instrumental performance as part of the October Canterbury Festival and its choir has also performed in an autumn weekend in Totnes, Devon.

Dark blue indicates areas designated in their entirety; light blue indicates areas that include designated communities. The French Language Services Act () (the Act) is a law in the province of Ontario, Canada which is intended to protect the rights of Franco- Ontarians, or French-speaking people, in the province. The Act does not give the French language full official language status in the province, which has no official language defined in law but is primarily an English-speaking province in practice. The Act, however, ensures that provincial government services are offered in French in 26 designated areas across the province with significant numbers of Franco-Ontarian residents. Preamble \\"Whereas the French language is a historic and honoured language in Ontario and recognized by the Constitution as an official language in Canada; and whereas in Ontario the French language is recognized as an official language in the courts and in education; and whereas the Legislative Assembly recognizes the contribution of the cultural heritage of the French speaking population and wishes to preserve it for future generations; and whereas it is desirable to guarantee the use of the French language in institutions of the Legislature and the Government of Ontario, as provided in this Act.\\" History Historically, the Franco- Ontarian community had been ignored or treated with contempt by the government of Ontario, most notably with the adoption in 1912 of Regulation 17, which forbade the use of French as a language of school instruction in Ontario. Regulation 17 was challenged in court by the activist organization ACF√âO, and was never fully implemented before its repeal in 1927. However, it was not until 1968 that the provincial government amended the Education Act to officially recognize the existence of French language schools in the province. Over the next number of years, the government began to offer a wider range of services in French. In 1970, a Coordinator of Bilingualism was appointed to oversee the development of French language government services. Over the next 16 years, a large number of service policies were adopted on a piecemeal basis by individual ministries, until the French Language Services Act was introduced in 1986. The Act The primary purpose of the Act was to consolidate and formalize government policies and regulations around the provision of French language services. The Act guaranteed francophones in 23 designated areas of the province a right to local French services from the provincial government. Two more cities were designated as French language service areas after the Act came into effect. Francophones living outside of the designated areas can receive services in French by accessing government services located in the designated areas or by directly contacting the head offices of government ministries. The provision and coordination of French language services is managed by the Ministry of Francophone Affairs. The French Language Services Act does not cover public agencies such as hospitals, nursing homes or the Children's Aid Society. However, these agencies may ask to be officially designated as providers of services in French by the Cabinet. Once designated, the agencies must provide French-language services just as the ministries do. Other partially funded provincial and municipal agencies may develop their own policies regarding French language services. For instance, Ontario public libraries within FLSA designated areas are not bound by the Act, however the Ontario Libraries Acts section 20 (b) states that public library boards \\"shall seek to provide library services in the French language, where appropriate\\". The Act also does not legislate any responsibilities upon individual municipalities to provide French language services, although a municipality may choose to do so of its own accord. The Act was introduced in 1986 by Bernard Grandma√Ætre, Minister of Francophone Affairs in the Liberal government of David Peterson, and passed successfully. It provided for a three-year implementation period, and the law officially came into effect on November 18, 1989.\\"En fran√ßais, s'il vous pla√Æt\\". Windsor Star, October 27, 1989.  Ensuring compliance  In 2007, the Office of the French Language Services Commissioner was the agency whose primary mandate was to ensure compliance with the French Language Services Act in the delivery of government services by means of independent investigations. The Commissioner received and handled complaints from the public with respect to inadequate French-language services from the Ontario government. Recommendations are outlined in a publicly available annual report to the Minister Responsible for Francophone Affairs. Under legislative changes that came into effect on May 1, 2019, the position of the French Language Services Commissioner was eliminated and all of his responsibilities were transferred to the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman now has a French Language Services Commissioner at the Deputy Ombudsman level, and a dedicated unit within their office for this work. The Ombudsman‚Äôs jurisdiction and powers of investigation now include ensuring that the rights of Ontarians and the obligations of government agencies are respected according to the French Language Services Act. Designated areas In order for an area to obtain designation, Francophones must make up at least 10% of its population, and urban centres must have at least 5,000 francophones. Previous to 2009, the definition of a francophone in Ontario included only native French speakers. This definition was broadened by the Government of Ontario in June 2009 \\"to better reflect the changing face and diversity of Ontario's Francophone communities.\\" The new Inclusive Definition of Francophones (IDF) now includes allophones, \\"those whose mother tongue is neither French nor English but have particular knowledge of French as an official language and use French at home, including many recent immigrants to Ontario for whom French is the language of integration.\\" Due to the 5,000 population threshold, large cities that are actually overwhelmingly anglophone (and may also have several widely spoken immigrant languages) with virtually no obvious francophone element due to very low percentages, such as Toronto (population 2,731,571) or Brampton (population 593,638) are nevertheless still subject to the Act. =Districts and counties= * Algoma District * Cochrane District * Nipissing District * Prescott and Russell United Counties * Sudbury District * Timiskaming District =Municipalities= * Brampton * Callander * Cornwall * Essa * Greater Sudbury * Greenstone * Hamilton * Ignace * Kingston * Lakeshore * Laurentian Valley * London * Manitouwadge * Marathon * Markham * Mississauga * North Glengarry * North Stormont * Ottawa * Pembroke * Penetanguishene * Port Colborne * South Glengarry * South Stormont * Tecumseh * Terrace Bay * Tilbury * Tiny * Toronto * Welland * Whitewater Region * Winchester * Windsor =Expansion of services= Brampton was designated as the province's 24th bilingual service centre in 2004, and the designation officially came into effect in March 2007. Kingston was designated as the 25th bilingual service centre in May 2006, and French services officially came into effect in 2009. Markham was designated as the 26th bilingual service centre in June 2015, and French services officially came into effect on July 1, 2018. Law application The Hawkesbury detachment of the Ontario Provincial Police became the first in Ontario to be fully operational in English and French in December 2012. Controversy The Act was controversial with anti- bilingualism advocates such as the Alliance for the Preservation of English in Canada, who alleged that it created a special entitlement for francophones at the expense of anglophone residents of the province as the requirement to provide bilingual services was perceived to discriminate against government employees who did not speak French. APEC also misrepresented or misunderstood the reality that the legislation did not cover municipal government services, and it began a campaign of persuading Ontario municipalities to declare themselves English-only. A number of smaller municipalities, especially in the Western Ontario region, did so during the implementation period. On January 29, 1990, the most famous such resolution was passed in Sault Ste. Marie, igniting a national controversy which in turn became a flashpoint in the Meech Lake Accord debate. (See Sault Ste. Marie language resolution.) On November 18, 1996, New Democrat MPP Gilles Bisson spoke in French in the Legislative Assembly to mark the 10th anniversary of the Act's passage. He was heckled by Progressive Conservative opponent Joe Spina, who yelled at Bisson to \\"Speak English!\\"\\"Spina comments raise ire again\\". Windsor Star, November 19, 1996.

For these processes, the consequence of the microscopic T-symmetry is: > Corresponding to every individual process there is a reverse process, and in > a state of equilibrium the average rate of every process is equal to the > average rate of its reverse process. History of microscopic reversibility The idea of microscopic reversibility was born together with physical kinetics. In 1872, Ludwig Boltzmann represented kinetics of gases as statistical ensemble of elementary collisions.Boltzmann, L. (1964), Lectures on gas theory, Berkeley, CA, USA: U. of California Press. Equations of mechanics are reversible in time, hence, the reverse collisions obey the same laws. This reversibility of collisions is the first example of microreversibility. According to Boltzmann, this microreversibility implies the principle of detailed balance for collisions: at the equilibrium ensemble each collision is equilibrated by its reverse collision. These ideas of Boltzmann were analyzed in detail and generalized by Richard C. Tolman.Tolman, R. C. (1938). The Principles of Statistical Mechanics. Oxford University Press, London, UK. In chemistry, J. H. van't Hoff (1884)Van't Hoff, J.H. Etudes de dynamique chimique. Frederic Muller, Amsterdam, 1884. came up with the idea that equilibrium has dynamical nature and is a result of the balance between the forward and backward reaction rates. He did not study reaction mechanisms with many elementary reactions and could not formulate the principle of detailed balance for complex reactions. In 1901, Rudolf Wegscheider introduced the principle of detailed balance for complex chemical reactions. He found that for a complex reaction the principle of detailed balance implies important and non-trivial relations between reaction rate constants for different reactions. In particular, he demonstrated that the irreversible cycles of reaction are impossible and for the reversible cycles the product of constants of the forward reactions (in the \\"clockwise\\" direction) is equal to the product of constants of the reverse reactions (in the \\"anticlockwise\\" direction). Lars Onsager (1931) used these relations in his well-known work, without direct citation but with the following remark: > \\"Here, however, the chemists are accustomed to impose a very interesting > additional restriction, namely: when the equilibrium is reached each > individual reaction must balance itself. They require that the transition > A\\\\to B must take place just as frequently as the reverse transition B\\\\to A > etc.\\" The quantum theory of emission and absorption developed by Albert Einstein (1916, 1917)Einstein, A. (1917). Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung [=On the quantum theory of radiation], Physikalische Zeitschrift 18 (1917), 121-128. English translation: D. ter Haar (1967): The Old Quantum Theory. Pergamon Press, pp. 167-183. gives an example of application of the microreversibility and detailed balance to development of a new branch of kinetic theory. Sometimes, the principle of detailed balance is formulated in the narrow sense, for chemical reactions onlyPrinciple of microscopic reversibility. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 2012. but in the history of physics it has the broader use: it was invented for collisions, used for emission and absorption of quanta, for transport processes and for many other phenomena. In its modern form, the principle of microreversibility was published by Lewis (1925). In the classical textbooks Vol. 10 of the Course of Theoretical Physics(3rd Ed). full theory and many examples of applications are presented. Time-reversibility of dynamics The Newton and the Schr√∂dinger equations in the absence of the macroscopic magnetic fields and in the inertial frame of reference are T-invariant: if X(t) is a solution then X(-t) is also a solution (here X is the vector of all dynamic variables, including all the coordinates of particles for the Newton equations and the wave function in the configuration space for the Schr√∂dinger equation). There are two sources of the violation of this rule: * First, if dynamics depend on a pseudovector like the magnetic field or the rotation angular speed in the rotating frame then the T-symmetry does not hold. * Second, in microphysics of weak interaction the T-symmetry may be violated and only the combined CPT symmetry holds. Macroscopic consequences of the time-reversibility of dynamics In physics and chemistry, there are two main macroscopic consequences of the time-reversibility of microscopic dynamics: the principle of detailed balance and the Onsager reciprocal relations. The statistical description of the macroscopic process as an ensemble of the elementary indivisible events (collisions) was invented by L. Boltzmann and formalised in the Boltzmann equation. He discovered that the time-reversibility of the Newtonian dynamics leads to the detailed balance for collision: in equilibrium collisions are equilibrated by their reverse collisions. This principle allowed Boltzmann to deduce simple and nice formula for entropy production and prove his famous H-theorem. In this way, microscopic reversibility was used to prove macroscopic irreversibility and convergence of ensembles of molecules to their thermodynamic equilibria. Another macroscopic consequence of microscopic reversibility is the symmetry of kinetic coefficients, the so-called reciprocal relations. The reciprocal relations were discovered in the 19th century by Thomson and Helmholtz for some phenomena but the general theory was proposed by Lars Onsager in 1931. He found also the connection between the reciprocal relations and detailed balance. For the equations of the law of mass action the reciprocal relations appear in the linear approximation near equilibrium as a consequence of the detailed balance conditions. According to the reciprocal relations, the damped oscillations in homogeneous closed systems near thermodynamic equilibria are impossible because the spectrum of symmetric operators is real. Therefore, the relaxation to equilibrium in such a system is monotone if it is sufficiently close to the equilibrium.

Fort Selkirk (1898) Fort Selkirk is a former trading post on the Yukon River at the confluence of the Pelly River in Canada's Yukon. For many years it was home to the Selkirk First Nation (Northern Tutchone). Archaeological evidence shows that the site has been in use for at least 8,000 years. Robert Campbell established a Hudson's Bay Company trading post nearby in 1848. In early 1852 he moved the post to its current location. Resenting the interference of the Hudson's Bay Company with their traditional trade with interior Athabaskan First Nations, Chilkat Tlingit First Nation warriors attacked and looted the post that summer on Saturday, August 21, 1852. It was rebuilt about 40 years later and became an important supply point along the Yukon River. It was essentially abandoned by the mid-1950s after the Klondike Highway bypassed it and Yukon River traffic died down. At age 28, under the command of Inspector John Douglas Moodie, Francis Joseph Fitzgerald was the first person of European descent to chart an overland route from Edmonton to Fort Selkirk, Yukon via northern British Columbia and the Pelly River (1897). The voyage took eleven months, having covered about 1,000 miles.

Both junior high and high school sides were combined in 2004 with the fusion of the CCSG (high school) with the junior high schools of Pauline-Vanier and Vision Jeunesse (both in Ottawa, ON). A school uniform is mandatory for the students. History In September 1979, CCSG opened with 71 students, in two classes of Grade 9 and one class of Grade 10. The administration, knowing that students want to follow their high school education at Samuel-Genest, created Grade 11 classes the next year, and a Grade 12 class in 1982. It was only in 1984 however that a Grade 13 was offered. Throughout those years, Samuel-Genest has moved from three different locations in Ottawa. First starting on Smyth Rd., then to Church St and finally on Carson's Rd. Concentrations =Concentration Scientifique= CCSG is known for its academic strength in the field of Science. It is the only high-school in the Ottawa region to offer a Concentration Scientifique (French for Scientific Concentration). =New concentrations= In the 2006-2007 school year, the school also launched 2 new programs, exclusively to Grades 7-8, which are Sam'Artiste (Artists Program) and Sam'Sportif (Sports program), in addition to the Sam'Enrichit program, affiliated to the 9-12 Scientific Concentration. It is expected that the Sam'Artiste and Sportif programs will be gradually expanded to Grades 9-12.

It is a small perennial herb or subshrub with dark gray-green oval- shaped leaves on hairy green stems that grow to a maximum height of one meter. It has bright purple or blue frilly flowers with thick yellow anthers at the center. The flowers close into spherical buds overnight. It bears small round green fruits which turn purple when ripe and resemble tiny eggplants. It is a tough shrub which can grow in rocky and clay soils and springs up in areas recovering from wildfires or other disturbances. Like most other members of genus Solanum, S. umbelliferum contains toxic alkaloids.

The race was created in 1961 by Jacques Marchand, the editor of L'√âquipe, to attract teams from the Soviet Union and other communist nations that had no professional riders to enter the Tour de France. Until 1967, it took place earlier the same day as some of the stages of the Tour de France and shared the latter part of each stage's route, but moved to September and a separate course from 1968 onwards. It became the Grand Prix de l'Avenir in 1970, the Troph√©e Peugeot de l'Avenir from 1972 to 1979 and the Tour de la Communaut√© Europ√©enne from 1986 to 1990.

The British were led by Sir Harry Smith,Smith, Sir Harry. ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Autobiography of Lieutenant-General Sir Harry Smith Baronet of Aliwal on the Sutlej.‚Äô‚Äô Publisher: John Murray, Albemarle Street 1903 while the Boers were led by Andries Pretorius. The British were victorious after one Boer opened fire too early and betrayed their position. Background Sir Harry Smith assumed the role of Governor of the Cape in 1847 and begun to unravel the work of the previous governor Sir Peregrine Maitland, who had reached agreements with the Basotho and the Griqua leaders which would help maintain British control of the region between the Vaal and Orange Rivers. Smith declared to the Griqua leader Adam Kok that all rent of their land to colonists would be given to the British Crown as opposed to the Griqua leaders getting half of it, while at the meeting with Basotho King Moshoeshoe, he declared while the white farmers would remain on the land in the area, the hereditary land rights of the native chiefs in the area would be maintained after a proclamation of the proposed Orange River Sovereignty. The Boers had an interest in land that stretched from Potchefstroom to Winburg and beyond. Smith had assured Andries Pretorius that he would not proclaim the land between the two rivers as British until the views of the Boers had been consulted and if less than 80 percent of them were in favour of the British action, Smith said he would not proceed with the proclamation. This Boer consultation period was never able to be completed by Pretorius. Without consulting the Voortrekkers concerning their interests in the territory, Sir Harry Smith annexed the land between the Vaal and Orange Rivers and Drakensberg on 3 February 1848 as British, calling it the Orange River Sovereignty. The Boers in Winburg upset by the British action appealed to Pretorius for help regain their independence and by June 1848 he raised a commando of around 1000 men. Pretorius responded by advancing on Winburg and ran the British magistrate Thomas Biddulph out of town and declared a republic. He then proceeded to chase away other British magistrates before he then headed to Bloemfontein where the British Resident Major Henry Warden was installed with 70 men of the Cape Corps. He appealed for help from the Basotho King Moshoeshoe I, but he remained neutral, so Warden retreated from Bloemfontein to the Orange River. Smith issued orders for a British force to be formed by Colonel George Buller and it reached King William's Town by 28 July and then left on 4 August after other units joined him and proceeded to Colesberg where more units joined as did Sir Harry Smith. By 25 August 1848, the British force had arrived at the Orange River crossing point. Reports came to Smith that the Boer Commando were within 16 km of the river crossing and were being watched by Boer patrols and when the British crossed the river by 26 August unopposed, headed in the direction of Bloemfontein while Pretorius' commando repositioned to oppose them around Boomplaats. Order of battle =British - Sir Harry Smith= * four companies Cape Mounted Rifles * two companies Rifle Brigade * two companies 45th Regiment * two companies 91st Highlanders Regiment * three field guns Royal Artillery * Sappers unit * Medical unit * 200-250 Griquas - Andries Waterboer and Adam Kok =Boers - Commandant-General Andries Pretorius= * 300-500 Boer commandos Battle Plan of the Battle of Boomplaats. On the morning of 29 August 1848, the British column stopped at a farm at Touwfontein for their morning meal and at this time Sir Harry Smith was told that Pretorius' force was 19 km away on low hills behind which was a river, across which was a farm called Boomplaats and a higher range behind it with the road heading through a pass. By early afternoon, British forces arrived at a flat plain in front of Pretorius' location in the hills and with Smith leading a reconnaissance party to a ridge where they were surprised by the Boers. He divided his forces for an attack with his left flank consisting of the Cape Mounted Rifles, the 45th Regiment in the centre and the Rifle Brigade on the right flank while 91st Regiment became his reserve. The 45th Regiment came under heavy fire but achieved their objectives when the reserve was called in to assist them. The Rifle Brigade on the right flank would also take their objectives. The Boers attempted to round the British left flank and attack the wagon train in the rear but were stopped by the Cape Mounted Rifles and the Boer hill positions were taken. The battle was said to have lasted about four hours with the Boers moving from ridge to ridge before Pretorius' forces retreated toward Winburg. The British forces followed for a few kilometers before darkness fell and continued the following day but the Boers were gone. A field hospital was set up later at the Boomplaats farmhouse for the casualties sustained in the fighting. Aftermath Boer casualties are recorded in memorials as 9 killed and 7 wounded while a British government notice of the time records the rebel casualties as 49 killed and possibly 150 wounded. British memorials record 16 killed and while other records mention as many as 45 wounded and 6 Griquas killed though and a high number of unrecorded wounded. Pretorius now retreated to safety to the lands across the Vaal River with a bounty of ¬£1000 announced for his capture while Henry Warden returned to Bloemfontein as the British Resident. Due to limited financial and military resources available to British in the Orange River Sovereignty they struggled to maintain control of the boundaries in this territory and saw the possibility of the Boers being used to maintain the security of the remaining British colonies if latter controlled them. By 17 January 1852, the Sand River Convention was signed by William S. Hogge and C.M. Owen on behalf of the British and Andries Pretorius on behalf of the Voortrekkers that resulted in the creation of a Boer republic north of the Vaal River and the eventual South African Republic. Negotiations concerning the Orange River Sovereignty soon followed. On the 23 February 1854, the Bloemfontein Convention was signed between the British government and Josias Hoffman and six former Voortrekkers that resulted in the British recognising the territory between the Vaal and Orange Rivers as an independent territory and would eventually become the Boer Orange Free State Republic.

Distin would subsequently lose most of his money on concert schemes and other ventures within a few years. In 1876, Henri Distin returned to the United States and set up a small business manufacturing cornets in New York.
